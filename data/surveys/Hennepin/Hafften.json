                "narrative": "<p>Haften Lake, a 43-acre, class 30 lake located 2.5 miles east of the city of Rockford, offers good panfishing and an occasional large pike.  The sport fish community consists of black crappie, bluegill, hybrid sunfish, largemouth bass, northern pike, pumpkinseed sunfish, and yellow perch.  An access owned and maintained by Greenfield Township is situated on the southeast corner of lake.  Haften Lake has low numbers of good-sized, fast growing northern pike.  Fifty-seven percent of sampled pike were over 26 inches.  The largest pike measured approximately 33.0 inches.  Although gill nets and trap nets do not effectively sample largemouth bass, one largemouth bass measuring 10.9 inches and weighing nearly 2/3 of a pound was sampled in a gill net.  Spring electrofishing may be needed to adequately assess bass numbers and size structure.  Haften Lake supports moderately abundant bluegill and black crappie populations while providing habitat for smaller populations of yellow perch, pumpkinseeds, and hybrid sunfish.  Of the 370 bluegills sampled using trap nets, approximately 34 and 63% of fish sampled were above 7.0 and 6.5 inches, respectively.  116 black crappies, averaging 7.5 inches, were sampled using both gill and trap nets.  Approximately 34% of the crappies sampled were above 8.0 inches, with no fish exceeding 9.5 inches.  The lone yellow perch measured 7.6 inches and weighed 0.2 pounds.    Black bullheads, yellow bullheads, common carp, bowfin, and golden shiners were sampled in varying numbers and lengths.  Three captured black bullheads averaged 14.1 inches and 1.5 pounds while seven brown bullheads averaged 12.5 inches and 1.1 pounds.  Gill netted yellow bullheads averaged approximately 11.0 inches while yellow bullheads captured in trap nets measured slightly under 12.0 inches.  One common carp (30.4 inches) and one bowfin (26.6 inches) were sampled in trap nets while one golden shiner was caught in a gill net.   </p>",

Most of the fish measured were between 5.5 and 8 inches. Black crappies were the second most abundant species. A majority of the black crappies sampled were captured in trapnets. Their mean length was only 6.9 inches. The mean weight per fish is average. The population of northern pike was found to be average for lake class 30. The mean weight per fish is low, even though over 70% of the northern pike were larger than 25 inches. Only two largemouth bass were sampled. One from each gear type. Black, brown, and yellow bullheads were all sampled in low to average numbers. Yellow perch, bowfin, carp, and pumpkinseed sunfish were sampled less than one per gillnet. Natural reproduction appeared to be poor. Only nine young of the year bluegills were captured in three one-quarter inch trapnets.</p>",
