Substrates are predominately sand, muck, and detritus with an abundance of aquatic vegetation.  Rhine Lake is susceptible to periodic winter kill.  Access to Rhine Lake can only be gained through private property.          Anglers on Rhine Lake can expect abundant northern pike of quality size.  Northerns caught during the assessment averaged 21.8 inches and 2.4 pounds.  Black crappie while less abundant were also of respectable size, averaging 8.6 inches.  Fishing pressure on Rhine Lake is very light.           Black bullheads were very abundant in the netting, likely a consequence of the species tenacity during winter kill situations.          Other species sampled during the assessment included; golden shiner, white sucker, brown bullhead , bluegill, pumpkinseed sunfish, Iowa darter, yellow perch, and painted turtle.</p>",
