AVERAGE BLUEGILL SIZE HAS REMAINED RELATIVELY CONSTANT SINCE 1975. BLACK CRAPPIE NUMBERS HAVE INCREASED DRAMATICALLY SINCE 1985, BUT AVERAGE SIZE HAS REMAINED RELATIVE LY CONSTANT SINCE 1980.  LARGEMOUTH BASS NUMBERS HAVE INCREASED AND WERE SAMPLED WELL ABOVE MEDIAN LEVELS.  NORTHERN PIKE NUMBERS CONTINUE TO DECLINE WHILE AVERAGE CAPTURED FISH SIZE INCREASED.  NORTH ERN PIKE WERE SAMPLED ABOVE MEDIANS FOR GILLNETS A AND BELOW MEDIANS FOR TRAPNETS.  THREE HYBRID MUSKIES WERE SAMPLED, INDICATING A GOOD SURVIVAL FROM THE 1988 STOCKING.  SLOW LMB GROWTH RATES ARE INDICATED FROM SCALE SAMPLES TAKING DURING THIS ASSESSMENT.  PUMPKINSEEDS AND HYBRID SUNFISH WERE ALSO SAMPLED AT ABOVE-MEDIAN LEVELS BUT IN DECREASED NUMBERS FROM PREVIOUS YEARS' SAMPLING.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Weaver Lake is a 149 acre, class 24 lake, located in the city of Maple Grove.  This lake is typical of small lakes with a Largemouth Bass-Bluegill-Northern Pike species composition.  An experimental introduction of Hybrid Muskellunge (Tiger Muskie) has been conducted in the past and provides a bonus fishery on Weaver Lake.  The Tiger Muskie stocking program began in 1984 and stocking continues every third year in the lake.  Northern pike and Largemouth bass are the dominant gamefish in Weaver Lake.  Both were sampled with relatively high abundance during this survey.  Northern pike average lengths were measured at a very respectable 25.2 inches while average weight was found to be 3.7 pounds per fish.  Forty-six percent of northern pike were over 25 inches long and 12% were greater than 30 inches in length.  Largemouth bass averaged 13.9 inches long and 1.4 pounds.  The majority of bass sampled were between one and six-years of age, however one 8-year old and one 11-year old fish were caught from the population.Weaver Lake has an abundant and diverse panfish community that includes bluegill, black crappie, pumpkinseed and hybrid sunfish.  Green sunfish are also present but in very low abundance and size.  Because panfish are so abundant in the lake their sizes tend to be fairly small.  Bluegill averaged 6.2 inches in length overall with very few (4%) individual fish reaching 7.0 inches in length.  The black crappie population averaged 7.4 inches long.  However, 60% of crappies measured were over 8.0 inches, and 16% were over 9.0 inches.  Several young black crappie were sampled during this survey.  These fish should be recruited into the fishery within the next few years and have the potential to provide anglers with a continued source of catchable sized crappies. A large population of yellow bullhead were sampled in Weaver Lake gill net and trap nets.  Yellow bullhead mean length was measured at 11.5 inches and mean weight was measured at 0.81 and 0.94 pounds for gill and trap net caught fish, respectively.  One brown bullhead and one black bullhead were sampled during this survey.  Seven bowfin (dogfish) were sampled in trap nets.  These averaged 5.3 pounds per fish and measured between 21.4 and 26.4 inches long (average = 23.8 inches).</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of nearshore fish species in Weaver Lake was conducted beginning on August 3rd, 2020 by Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program Staff. Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at 10 sampling stations, but two stations were sampled from the boat due to site conditions. Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample three stations, a 15-foot seine was used at four stations, and site conditions (soft sediment and deep water) prevented the use of seines at three stations. Nearshore sampling captured 20 species of fish including four species that are intolerant of disturbance (Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, and Iowa Darter) and one that is tolerant of disturbance (Green Sunfish). <br> \n <br> \nA concurrent summer trap net survey was conducted the week of August 3rd, 2020 by IBI Program Staff. Nine trap nets were set along the shoreline and in shallow offshore locations that encompassed multiple habitat types. Bluegill and Black Crappie comprised a majority of the trap net catch by number and biomass. Bluegill count per net was between the 50th and 75th quartile, while the Bluegill mean weight was below the 25th quartile for similar Lake Class 24 lakes. The Black Crappie count per net was between the 25th and 50th quartile, while their mean weight was between the 50th and 75th quartile for similar Lake Class 24 lakes. <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore and trap net data were combined with gill net data from a July 2018 survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based IBI (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment. In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g. Banded Killifish, Pugnose Shiner, and Rock Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g. Green Sunfish, Fathead Minnows, and Common Carp). The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.  <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Mississippi River-Twin Cities Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.</p>",

Almost of every 5 Northern Pike captured was 25.0\" or more in length. Hybrid Muskellunge are also being stocked every third year. Their growth rate in this system should provide the opportunity of catching fish that exceed 30 pounds in a relatively short period of time. Yellow perch were sampled in low numbers, but that is to be expected in a system with a high pike population. Largemouth Bass are also present and anglers report catching some quality size individuals on occasion. Bluegill and pumpkinseed sunfish were very abundant in the trap net catch and averaged 6.1 and 5.8 inches in length, respectively. The black crappie population appears to be down from 1990 levels and average only 6.9 inches in length. Large yellow bullhead are still common in the lake with some individuals captured in excess of 2 pounds each. Bowfin are also present in the lake, and probably contribute significantly to the control of the panfish population.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Weaver Lake is a 149-acre lake with a maximum depth of 57 feet. Weaver is located northwest of the City of Maple Grove, in northern Hennepin County. Public access is provided by a city-owned boat ramp located on the western shore, while the city park on the southeast shore offers shore fishing, swimming beach, and recreational area. The lake is subject to periodic small-scale fish die-offs typical for the lake type and region. Kills for Weaver have been recorded three times from 2005 through 2018. Eurasian Watermilfoil also remains present in Weaver Lake. <br> \n <br> \nWeaver is primarily managed for Bluegill, but includes catchable populations of hybrid (tiger) muskellunge, Largemouth Bass, Northern Pike, and Black Crappie. Tiger muskellunge were last stocked by private-permit in 2014 and 2016; DNR stockings of the fish ended in 2006. A Standard Survey (trap nets, gill nets, and boat electrofishing) was conducted on Weaver Lake during the week of 7/9/2018. During the survey, water clarity was moderate with 5 feet of visibility and low oxygen below 24 feet.  <br> \n <br> \nBluegill numbers in Weaver Lake were high, with 46.3/net. Bluegill averaged 5.0 inches with the largest measured at 7.9 inches. However, of the 417 Bluegill sampled, only 29% of those fish were larger than 6 inches. High numbers of small Bluegill are likely limiting growth potential. <br> \n <br> \nTiger muskellunge were sampled in low numbers (0.5/net) during the 2018 survey. Average size of fish sampled was 23.1 inches, with the longest measured at 28.2 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass were sampled during spring 2018 with nighttime boat electrofishing, the first time this type of sampling was conducted on Weaver Lake. Catch rates were high, with 73.3 fish/hour. Largemouth Bass averaged 10.9 inches with the largest measured at 20.0 inches. Nearly 30% of catchable-sized fish were over 15 inches, providing excellent angling opportunity. The Largemouth Bass population in Weaver Lake is healthy, with consistent reproduction and many year classes of fish. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike were sampled at moderate numbers (7.8/net) compared to similar lakes in the area. Average size of Northern Pike was 24.7 inches with the largest measured at 35.0 inches. New Northern Pike regulations (effective 2018) prohibit harvest between 22 and 26 inches, but allow a 10 fish limit outside of the protected slot, with not more than 2 of those 10 fish over 26 inches. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie were sampled with gill nets (14.8/net) and trap nets (4.1/net), within their historical range. Black Crappie averaged 7.3 inches with the largest measured at 10.8 inches. Of the 111 Black Crappie sampled, only 3% were greater than 10 inches. <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species sampled in low numbers were Black Bullhead, Brown Bullhead, Green Sunfish, Pumpkinseed, Yellow Bullhead, and Yellow Perch. <br> \n</p>",

Historically, this lake contained a largemouth bass-bluegill-northern pike species composition, very typical of other small lakes in class 24.  Hybrid muskellunge (tiger muskie) have been introduced to provide a bonus fishery.  Stocking began in 1984 and continues with fish being stocked every third year.  One tiger muskie 39 inches in length weighing 15 pounds was sampled during this survey. <br> \n    <br> \nNorthern pike were sampled in average abundance for a class 24 lake and displayed very good size with an average length of 28.7 inches and average weight of 5.6 pounds.  However, northern pike abundance is the lowest it has been in Weaver Lake since 1990.    <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass averaged 13 inches in length and weighed an average of 1.2 pounds.  The size of largemouth bass in Weaver Lake is very good.  This survey found an average abundance of largemouth bass compared to similar lakes.  However, abundance of largemouth bass in Weaver Lake is the lowest it has been since 1985, when none were sampled.      <br> \n <br> \nOne walleye measuring 24 inches and weighing 4.5 pounds was sampled.  This fish was likely introduced by a private citizen illegally, as MN DNR Fisheries staff has not stocked Weaver Lake with walleye.     <br> \n <br> \nWeaver Lake displayed a diverse panfish community that includes bluegill, black crappie, green sunfish pumpkinseed and hybrid sunfish.  Bluegills were very abundant.  An improved size structure was seen in this survey.  More than 86% were 6 inches or larger.  Nearly 25% were 7 inches or greater, compared to 4% in the pervious survey.  Average size also increased from 6.2 to 6.5 inches.  Black crappie numbers are average for this type of lake and showed no significant change from last survey.  Over 60% were larger than 8 inches, but less than 1% were larger than 10. <br> \n <br> \nYellow bullhead abundance has decreased to average levels.  The average weight of these fish is over 1 lb, above average.  Only one yellow perch was sampled, but this species has always been rare in Weaver Lake.  Common carp abundance was low.   One bowfin (dogfish) measuring 27.6 inches and weighing 6.53 pounds was caught.  Golden shiners were sampled at an average abundance.       <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Weaver Lake is a 152-acre lake with an average depth of 20.7 feet and a maximum depth of 57 feet. The lake is in the city of Maple Grove in north-central Hennepin County. Weaver is actively managed for Bluegill, with secondary emphasis on Northern Pike and Largemouth Bass. Weaver also supports catchable populations of Black Crappie. Public water access is provided by the City of Maple Grove on the west side of the lake off Minnesota Highway 101 (up to 10 vehicle/trailer parking spaces). <br> \n <br> \nA standard survey (9 trap nets/6 gill nets) was completed on Weaver Lake during the week of 7/11/2024 to monitor water quality and fish populations. Water color was green, with low-moderate water clarity, measured at 6.0 feet during the time of this survey. Dissolved oxygen was zero parts per million (ppm) at a depth of 28 feet, meaning fish would be unable to use water depths greater than 28 feet during mid-summer. <br> \n <br> \nModerate numbers of Bluegill were sampled with trap nets (36/net) near the expected catch rate of similar metro lakes. There were 324 Bluegill sampled in trap nets during the 2023 survey, with an average length of 5.4 inches, and the largest measured at 7.1 inches. Despite moderate numbers of Bluegill, growth remained slow, with less than 5% of fish sampled measured greater than 6.5 inches. Although Bluegill are abundant, relatively few large fish can be found. <br> \n <br> \nHigh numbers of Northern Pike were sampled with gill nets (9.3/net), above the expected catch rate of similar metro lakes. There were 56 Northern Pike sampled in gill nets during the 2023 survey. Average size of Northern Pike in the 2023 survey was 25.8 inches with the largest measured at 37.9 inches. The current population appears well balanced (a middle ground between high numbers of small fish and few numbers of large fish). Despite high numbers, multiple fish were sampled greater than 34 inches, demonstrating the potential for these fish to reach desirable sizes. Northern Pike numbers are high and their average and maximum size would rival some of the best opportunities found in the area. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass are present in Weaver Lake, although targeted boat-electrofishing did not occur during the 2023 survey. Incidental capture with trap and gill nets caught six Largemouth Bass, with an average length of 14.5 inches and the largest measuring 16.8 inches. Future surveys will include a targeted spring boat-electrofishing component. <br> \n <br> \nModerate numbers of Black Crappie were sampled with gill nets (6.0/net) and trap nets (2.4/net) near the expected catch rate of similar metro lakes. The Black Crappie population remains stable, with little variation in historic catch rates over the previous 30 years. There were 58 Black Crappie sampled during the 2023 survey, with an average length of 7.3 inches, and the largest measured at 11.9 inches. Despite the majority of small crappie, the presence of fish greater than 10 inches is an encouraging sign for the fishery. <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species sampled in low abundance were Black Bullhead, Brown Bullhead, Golden Shiner, Green Sunfish, Pumpkinseed, Tiger Muskellunge, Walleye, Yellow Bullhead, and Yellow Perch. <br> \n <br> \nEurasian Watermilfoil, a submersed invasive aquatic plant has been found in Weaver Lake and remains present. Eurasian watermilfoil can limit recreational activities on water bodies by forming mats on the water surface and alter aquatic ecosystems by displacing native plants. The most important action that you can take to limit the spread of milfoil and other aquatic invasive plants is to remove all vegetation from your watercraft before you move it from one body of water to another.</p>",
