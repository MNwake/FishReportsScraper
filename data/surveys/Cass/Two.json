                "narrative": "<p>Two Lake is located ten miles north of Pine River in central Cass County.  Two Lake is 45 acres, has 1.3 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 25 feet.  The littoral area comprises 92% of the total lake area.  There are no inlets, but there is one outlet which is a man-made channel to Hand Lake.  Shoreline development is located along the south shore.  Shoal water soils are 50% sand, 30% silt and 20% muck.  Secchi reading was 8 feet.  Total alkalinity was 27.5 p.p.m.  Several emergent and submerged aquatic plants were present, and the density ratings were sparse and moderate for all aquatic species.Test netting indicated good fish populations of northern pike, yellow bullhead and bluegill.  The average individual size of northern pike was only 0.7 pounds.  Spawning habitat is fair for northern pike and is good for centrarchids.  Black grub (Neascus spp.) and yellow grub (Clinostomum marginatum) were the only parasites found.  Northern pike had a high infection of Neascus spp.  According to a local resident, fishing was good last year for northern pike, largemouth bass and sunfish.  The man-made channel was constructed about 18 years ago.The lake has frequent winterkills.</p>",
