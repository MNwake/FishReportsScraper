Following a winter kill event, recolonizing game fish species often grow fast.  For example, black crappie in the gill net sample, mostly age 2, averaged 7.7 inches total length (TL) at the time of capture.  Additionally, crappie sampled incidentally to young of the year fish, in small mesh trap nets, at the end of the summer averaged 10.0 inches TL, and were age 2.  Trap net catch for black crappie averaged 8.3 fish per lift.  The species composition in Hoff Lake is characteristic of a winter kill lake that is not isolated from other bodies of water.  Early colonizing species (white sucker, golden shiner, and fathead minnows), species tolerant of low dissolved oxygen concentrations (carp, bullheads, green sunfish), and hybrid sunfish were the species most commonly found during this survey as well as previous surveys.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Gill nets, trap nets and shoreline seining were used to sample the Hoff Lake fish population during the 2004 summer.  Aquatic plant sampling and water quality monitoring were also conducted.  Hoff Lake has a history of winterkill with a partial kill occurring during the 2003-2004 winter.  Fish populations can fluctuate greatly depending on the frequency and severity of this phenomenon.  Hoff Lake is highly fertile and shallow.  Aquatic vegetation, mainly curlyleaf pondweed, was abundant until it died back in late June.  Other submergent aquatic plant species would be considered rare in this lake.  Much of the lakeshore is undeveloped and row crops dominate the lake's watershed.  Limited shore fishing is available on the south end of the lake near the public access.  High numbers of northern pike were gill netted in 2004.  Pike were 11.2-31.7 inches long averaging 23.4 inches.  The 2001 year class was particlarly strong.  Moderate numbers of black crappie were trap netted.  Black crappie were 4.2-12.3 inches long averaging 7.8 inches.  Approximately 45% of the sample 8 inches or longer.  Moderate numbers of white crappie were trap netted averaging 8.8 inches.  Low numbers of bluegill, yellow perch and largemouth bass were also sampled.  A few of the bluegill and yellow perch were keeper sized.  Black bullhead dominated the catch, as they have since the lake was first netted back in 1978.  Black bullhead were small, averaging 6.3 inches.  High numbers of carp were gill netted, averaging 15.5 inches.  Hoff Lake was used as a walleye rearing pond in 2004, with hopes of producing fingerlings for statewide stocking efforts.  Carry-over would then be available to anglers.  No walleye fingerlings were harvested that fall, but 2 young-of-the-year walleye were captured during shoreline seining.  Anglers may want to concentrate their efforts on northern pike and crappie when fishing this occassional winterkill lake.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A standard survey was conducted at Hoff Lake beginning on July 1, 2019, to monitor the lake's fish population.  Hoff is a class 43 lake and net catches were compared to other similar lakes around the state.  The 2015 MNDNR Fisheries lake management plan (LMP) listed Northern Pike as the primary management species at Hoff Lake.  Black Crappie were listed as secondary management species.  Hoff was managed as a boom and bust type fishery, with stocking not being necessary due to fish migration from upstream lakes (Cedar and Willie via Harden) and a downstream river (South Fork of the Crow).  In 2019, a total of 17 species plus Hybrid Sunfish were sampled in the gill nets (GN) and trap nets (TN).  Water clarity was poor with a secchi disk reading of 1.7 feet, due to brown sediments.  Hoff has a history of winterkill and a partial kill occurred in 2014.  Fish populations can fluctuate widely at Hoff based on winterkill frequency and severity.  Curlyleaf Pondweed, a non-native submersed aquatic plant, can be abundant in May and June at Hoff Lake, often reaching nuisance levels as was the case in 2019.  Shore fishing was limited to the public access on the south end of the lake.  <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled low numbers of walleye (8) for a catch rate of 1.3/net, which was below the normal range for this type of lake, but was by far the highest ever recorded at Hoff Lake.  Historic GN catch rates from 1978 to 2019 (n=5), were all 0.0/net, except 2019.  In 2019, gill netted walleye were 13.1 to 19.8 inches long averaging 17.0 inches.  Walleye were likely migrants from upstream lakes or the downstream South Fork Crow River.  Anglers might get a nice sized walleye at Hoff now and then, but don't expect good numbers or fast action.   <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled moderate numbers of Northern Pike (44) for a catch rate of 7.3/net, which was within the normal range for this type of lake.  The 2004 catch rate was similar at 11.3/net.  Historic GN catch rates from 1978 to 2019 (n=5) were highly variable, ranging from 1.0 to 46.0/net with an average of 15.2.  Historically, pike recruitment would be classified as moderate to high.  In 2019, gill netted Northern Pike were 10.1 to 31.8 inches long with an average of 23.0.  Hoff is part of the Northern Pike North Central Management Zone regulation area instituted in 2018, which has a 22 to 26 protected slot limit (PSL) in place.  A bag of 10 fish is allowed, with 8 below and 2 above the PSL.  The PSL regulation is designed to allow more harvest of abundant small pike and to shift the population size structure to more medium-sized fish.  Hoff typically is clear enough for dark house spearing.  Pike anglers could expect good action, but don't expect any trophy sized fish.     <br> \n <br> \nTrap nets sampled low numbers (34) of Black Crappie in 2019 for a catch rate of 3.8/net, which was within the normal range for this type of lake.  The 2004 Black Crappie TN catch rate was 8.4/net.  Trap net catch rates from 1978 to 2019 (n=6) were variable, ranging from 0.0 to 19.8/net averaging 9.7.  In 2019, trap netted Black Crappie were 3.7 to 13.2 inches long averaging 6.4 inches.  Approximately 29% of the TN sample was 8 inches or longer, indicating that some fishing opportunity was available to anglers.  Gill nets also sampled low to moderate numbers (35) of Black Crappie for a catch rate of 5.8/net, which was within the normal range for this type of lake.  Historic GN catch rates from 1978 to 2019 (n=5) were low to moderate, ranging from 0.0 to 11.2/net with an average of 6.1.  In 2019, the gill netted Black Crappie were 4.2 to 10.8 inches long averaging 5.9 inches.     <br> \n <br> \nTrap nets sampled high numbers of Bluegill (647) for a catch rate of 71.9/net which was above the normal range for this lake type and was the highest catch rate ever observed at Hoff.  The 2004 TN catch rate was the second highest on record (1.0/net).  Bluegill were the most abundant fish sampled in 2019 TN's.  Historic TN catch rates from 1978 to 2019 (n=6) were mostly low, ranging from 0.0 to 71.9/net, with an average of 12.2.  In 2019, trap netted Bluegill were 2.4 to 7.0 inches long averaging 5.1 inches.  Approximately, 14% of the TN catch was 6 inches or longer, indicating a mediocre size structure, but that some angling opportunity was available.  The reason for the increased recruitment in recent years was possibly due to a lack of severe winterkills since 2014.  Bluegill are intolerant of the low oxygen levels typically found in winterkill lakes.      <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled moderate numbers of Yellow Perch (73) for a catch rate of 12.2/net, which was within the normal range for this type of lake and was the second highest catch ever recorded at Hoff.  The 2004 GN catch rate was 2.3/net.  Historic GN catch rates from 1978 to 2019 (n=5) were variable, ranging from 2.3 to 25.0/net with an average of 10.3.  In 2019, gill netted Yellow Perch were small (5.2 to 6.7 inches long).  Perch were likely an important forage item for Northern Pike at Hoff Lake.   <br> \n <br> \nTrap nets sampled low numbers of Common Carp (4) for a catch rate of 0.4/net, which was below the normal range for this lake type, and the second lowest on record at Hoff.  Historic TN catch rates (n=6) from 1978 to 2019 were mostly low, ranging from 0.4 to 6.7/net with an average of 2.8.  Trap netted Common Carp were 20.0 to 26.6 inches long.  In 2019, gill nets also sampled low numbers of Common Carp (5) for a catch rate of 0.8/net.  Historic GN catch rates (n=5) were highly variable, ranging from 0.0 to 63.0/net with an average of 17.4.  In 2019, gill netted Common Carp were 17.7 to 26.3 inches long.  Bow fishermen should have luck shooting carp at Hoff Lake.  <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled high numbers (450) of Black Bullhead for a catch rate of 75.0/net, which was near the lake class median (75.6).  Black bullhead were the most abundant species sampled in the 2019 GN catch.  Historic GN catch rates from 1978 to 2019 (n=5) were all moderate to high, ranging from 72.0 to 248.2/net with an average of 143.9.  In 2019, gill netted Black Bullhead were 6.0 to 12.5 inches long averaging 8.6 inches, indicating a mediocre size structure.  In 2019, trap nets sampled moderate numbers (263) of Black Bullhead for a catch rate of 29.2/net which was within the normal range for this lake type.  Historic TN catch rates (n=6) were highly variable ranging from 20.0 to 632.3/net with an average of 188.7.  Black Bullhead tend to be abundant in lakes that experience winterkill, a condition that is the case at Hoff Lake. <br> \n <br> \nAdditional fishes sampled in the standard gear included; Bigmouth Buffalo, Bowfin (Dogfish), Brown Bullhead, Golden Shiner, Green Sunfish, Hybrid Sunfish, Largemouth Bass, Pumpkinseed Sunfish, White Crappie, White Sucker, and Yellow Bullhead.</p>",
