                "narrative": "<p>The fish community of Swenson lake is diverse with most preferred species well represented. The exception to this is probably the apparent loss of a Smallmouth Bass fishery. One smallmouth was observed while scuba diving, though none were captured.The Walleye population is good with a history of consistant natural reproduction observed through 1990. Growth is good with many 5 year old fish reaching about 17 inches in length. The largest Walleye sampled was 27 inches in length and the smallest about 14 inches. Northern Pike are abundant with consistant natural reproduction. The largest pike captured was 36 inches in length but most were in the 18-22 inch range.Largemouth Bass are abundant and most fish were captured by means of electrofishing or trap netting. The average length is about 10 inches but a few bass greater than 14 inches in length were captured. The largest bass was 18.9 inches in length.    Bluegill were also abundant with an average weight of 5 per pound. The largest Bluegill was 9.4 inches and the average was 6.4 inches in length. Pumpkinseed are also common and similar in size to Bluegills. Rock Bass are abundant, though most are small. Black Crappie are present but the only crappie captured was by electrofishing.   Yellow Perch were captured in high numbers in gillnets while trap net catches were low. The average size was about 7 inches, though perch as large as 10.5 inches were observed. Some Neascus (black spot) was found on perch and other fishes in some parts of the lake. </p>",
