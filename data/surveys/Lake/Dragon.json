Test nets in recent years and again in 1993 indicate Black Crappie are in low abundance with some quality fish present. The average size of Black Crappie observed in 1993 was 11.7\".     The lake is not known for being one of the better Walleye lakes in the Finland area however on occasion some good catches are taken. Walleye abundance is about average for this class of lake with fish in excess of 21\" uncommon. The average size of Walleye taken in test nets in 1993 was 14.0\" with 41% larger than 16.0\". The largest Walleye observed during the assessment was 19.3\". Natural reproduction has been maintaining the population since the last Walleye stocking in 1984.     The Northern Pike abundance is low compared to similar lakes and the average size is small (18.8\").</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Dragon Lake is located 10 miles northwest of Isabella off USFS Road 383 (Bandana Lake Road) in the Superior National Forest.  Public access is a 30 yard carry in after 0.4 miles down USFS 383H (Dragon Lake Access Road) with a small parking lot suitable for 2 or 3 vehicles.  There are 2 USFS backcountry campsites with picnic tables, fire rings and outdoor latrines near the access.  The lake is 79 acres with a maximum depth of 15 feet.  A standard survey was conducted the week of July 15, 2019 to evaluate current management goals and provide data to base future management.  Dragon Lake is primarily managed for Walleye and Black Crappie.  This survey sampled Walleye, Black Crappie, Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, Bluegill, and Yellow Perch.  No stocking occurs in Dragon Lake as all the fish populations are maintained through natural reproduction. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye gill net catch of 3.3/net was average compared to similar lakes.  The average weight and length of 1 pound and 12.7 inches are also considered average.  Trap net catch of 1.9/net is slightly above average while the average weight of 1.5 pounds would be considered normal. The largest fish sampled was 25 inches, 6 pounds, and was aged at 15 years old.  Ten different year classes were sampled.  Growth rate is average for the area. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie gill net catch of 1/net was normal but the average weight of just under a half pound is considered on the large side compared to similar lakes.  Trap net catch of 3.3/net with average weight of just under a half pound was normal for similar lakes.  While the catch was average compared to similar lakes it was by far the highest trap net catch rate ever on Dragon Lake.  The largest fish sampled was 12.9 inches long and weighed 1.1 pounds.  Seven year classes were sampled with the 2015 year class by far the strongest representing 78% of the catch; the average size of these age-4 fish was 9.4 inches.  Growth rate is average for the area.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike gill net catch of 5/net and average weight of 1.3 pounds are both in the normal range for similar lakes.  The largest fish sampled in all gear types was 25.3 inches long and weighed 3.8 pounds.  Growth rate is average for the area.  <br> \n <br> \nTwo Largemouth Bass were sampled in gill nets.  Both were about 14 inches long and 1.6 pounds.  Bass do not sample well in standard netting gear, and only a few fish have been sampled in past assessments.  Night electroshocking in a boat is the standard for assessing Bass populations but is not possible because of the lack of boat access.  Young-of-the-year largemouth bass are sometimes sampled in Dragon Lake and also in other lakes in the Little Isabella River system.  Area consensus is that all of the lakes on the Little Isabella River chain have Largemouth Bass present. <br> \n <br> \nTwo Bluegill were sampled in trap nets, both about 8 inches long and a little under half a pound. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch were caught in average numbers but size was rather small.  White Sucker were caught in average numbers and size.  Other fish sampled were Blacknose Shiner, Common Shiner and Fathead Minnow. <br> \n <br> \nDragon Lake provides decent opportunities for Walleye and Black Crappie angling. Northern Pike are generally small with an occasional nice fish.  In the Finland Area, Bluegill and Black Crappie fisheries tend to have low density populations with good growth rates and sporadic reproduction that can produce good angling when strong year classes mature.  Considering the current Crappie population is being sustained mainly by one year class.  Therefore, it is particularly important to consider some catch and release to help maintain the spawning stock needed to sustain the population.</p>",

Spring trap netting captured 46 crappie that ranged from 5.7 to 12.3 inches and had an average size of 8.9 inches and 0.4 pounds. Analysis of scale samples identified six unique year classes. Growth was average with fish reaching 8.8 inches at age-4. This indicates Dragon Lake currently supports a healthy population of Black Crappie with good numbers of moderate sized fish with a few larger individuals present.   <br> \n <br> \nWhile not specifically targeted during this survey a fair number of Northern Pike were sampled with spring trap nets. Average size was 18.2 inches and 1.5 pounds with 8% greater than 24 inches. The lake is not a destination for trophy pike, but anglers that fish the lake may encounter this top predator. <br> \n <br> \nSome adult Walleye were also captured during this assessment. Size distribution was similar to summer sampling which is typically used to describe Walleye populations in local lakes. More information can be found from the standard survey completed the week of July 15, 2019. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Dragon Lake lies within the Kawishiwi Watershed, which drains northward to Hudson Bay by way of the Rainy River. The lake is a 77 acre, moderately soft-water lake, and has a maximum depth of 14 feet. The immediate watershed of the lake is mostly moderately sloping sand and gravel forest land. Shoal water soils are mostly gravel, with some areas of mixtures of gravel with sand, boulder,  or rubble. Limited areas of sand or muck are also present. There is one inlet and one outlet.A thermocline was found on June 22, 1961, which extended from eight to twelve feet in depth. Dissolved oxygen levels on June 22 were sufficiently high for fish life at all depths. Moderate amounts of aquatic vegetation were found in depths to four feet.Spawning facilities are rated as \"good to excellent\" for Walleye, and \"fair\" for other species present.  Shoreline seining results indicate current natural reproduction of Black Crappie and Yellow Perch, and the presence of young-of-the-year Walleye.Test netting catches of Walleye were high when compared to state and watershed medians.  Most Walleye were between 13\" and 16\" in length, and most Black Crappie lengths between 10.5\" and 13.0\".From the information available, fishing pressure appears to be light on this lake.</p>",

The fish collected in DNR test nets during the 1999 lake survey were black crappie, northern pike, walleye, yellow perch, white sucker and rock bass.     Black crappie were sampled in average numbers compared to other lakes in this class.  The fish averaged 8.5 inches and ranged from 4.0 inches to 10.6 inches with a mean weight of 0.4 pound.     Northern pike, walleye and yellow perch were all collected in average numbers.  The northern pike averaged 17.8 inches (1.4 pounds) with fish up to 29.3 inches (7.4 pounds) collected.  Walleye averaged about 12.5 inches (0.8 pound) with fish up to 21.5 inches (3.5 pounds) sampled.  Although the average size of the walleye was small there were a fair number of fish in the 15 inch to 17 inch range sampled.  Yellow perch averaged 8.0 inches, however fish of acceptable size to anglers are not abundant.  Dragon Lake is not stocked, these fish populations are maintained through natural reproduction.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Dragon Lake is a 72 acre body of water located approximately 9.4 miles northwest of Isabella.  Located in the Superior National Forest, the shoreline and area surrounding Dragon Lake have little private development.  There are two access trails from a common parking area on the west end of the lake.  Both trails are gravel, with a steep carry-down route to the lake, suitable only for small boat or canoe.  There was parking for approximately 4 vehicles in an open area at the top of the hill, with a couple of rustic camp sites in the same area. <br> \n  <br> \nThe fish sample in 2010 consisted of black crappie, northern pike, walleye, white sucker and yellow perch.  Walleye were sampled in below average numbers for northeastern Minnesota lakes with similar characteristics, but within the range seen in previous investigations on Dragon Lake.  The size of the walleye sampled was above average at 1.6 pounds (15.7 inches); the largest walleye was 22.1 inches.  Fifty-nine percent of the total walleye catch was greater than 16 inches.  Walleye stocking was discontinued in 1985, when aging of walleye samples indicated no consistent increase in walleye numbers in stocked year-classes over un-stocked year-classes. <br> \n   <br> \nNorthern pike were sampled in below average numbers for the lake class.  The northern pike average size was 3.1 pounds (22.6inches); the largest northern pike was 34.6 inches.  Historically, the northern pike catch has been low with average size fish sampled.  The average size (3.1 pounds), in the 2010 sample, was the largest seen in any investigation.  Northern pike growth was slow at all ages sampled, compared to northern pike sampled in other Finland area assessments. <br> \n <br> \nThe black crappie trap net catch in 2010 was below average for lake class but within the range previously seen in Dragon Lake investigations.  The mean weight 0.58 pound was above average in the small sample size (5).  Generally, Dragon Lake samples have consisted of small numbers of large black crappie.  Natural reproduction appears to be sporadic and poor, as is the case in many of the Finland area lakes with black crappie populations.  Growth was slow in the 2010 sample, compared to other Finland area lakes, with an age-5 black crappie measuring 9.9 inches. <br> \n <br> \nThe yellow perch catch in 2010 was about average for the lake class, but higher than any recorded in previous investigations of Dragon Lake.  The yellow perch size  (0.11 pound) was below average for the lake class, but within the range (0.07 - 0.18 pound) seen in previous investigations.  The average length of yellow perch in 2010 was less than 6 inches; the largest yellow perch was 7.0 inches. <br> \n <br> \nDragon Lake is connected by the Little Isabella River, directly or indirectly, to six other lakes in the area.  The white sucker population in 2010 was high in Dragon Lake, similar to white sucker samples in previous investigations.  The lakes in the Little Isabella River system usually have high white sucker populations. <br> \n   <br> \nYoung-of-the-year largemouth bass are sometimes sampled in Dragon Lake and also in other lakes in the Little Isabella River system.  Largemouth bass adults are rarely caught in the standard sampling gear, because of the difficult access, typical electro-fishing gear cannot be used on Dragon Lake to properly assess the largemouth bass population. <br> \n</p>",
