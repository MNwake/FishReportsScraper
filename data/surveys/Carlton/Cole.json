                "narrative": "<p>Cole Lake is best known for the black crappie, northern pike, walleye and largemouth bass angling.  The 1994 survey confirmed average numbers of these species in Cole Lake.     Black crappie sizes ranged from 5.2 to 9.6 inches with an average length of 7.6 inches and 57% over 8 inches.  Northern pike average 22.7 inches with an occasional fish over 29 inches.     Walleye numbers have declined from previous investigations, yet were typical for this type of lake.  Both walleye fry and fingerlings were stocked periodically as the success of natural reproduction varied from year to year.  The fish sampled in 1994 averaged 19.3 inches with a range between 17 and 22 inches.    Cole Lake also has a good largemouth bass population although slow growing.  These bass averaged 10.9 inches with a range of 5.1 to 15.3 inches.     Bluegill, pumpkinseed and yellow perch were also present to round out the angler's catch.</p>",

There is a public access on the north side of Cole Lake off state highway 210.  Walleye and largemouth bass are the primary fish species.  The walleye population is maintained by stocking fingerling walleye biennially in even years.       Walleye abundance of 1.4 fish per gillnet was average for Minnesota lakes of this type.  Mean length was 19.7 inches and growth was average compared to other Duluth Area populations.  All aged fish correlated to stocked years.         Largemouth bass electrofishing catch rate of 15.6 per hour was below average (32.6 per hour) for Duluth Area bass populations.  Mean length was 12.3 inches and the largest fish captured was 20.4 inches.  Largemouth bass growth was average compared to other Duluth Area populations.     Northern pike abundance was above average for Minnesota lakes at 7.2 fish per gillnet.  Mean length was 21.3 inches; fifty-six percent were over 21 inches and one fish measured 33.3 inches.  Growth was average for Duluth Area populations.  Based on age distribution, northern pike successfully reproduced from 1998 to 2004.       Black crappie abundance was 1.1 fish/trapnet and was below average for Minnesota lakes of this type.  The mean length of black crappie was 10.6 inches and growth was slow for Duluth Area lakes.  Four year-classes were represented in 2005, with a majority of the fish from the 1998 year-class.      Bluegill abundance in 2005 was the highest ever recorded in Cole Lake (5.9 per trapnet) and was average for Minnesota lakes.  Mean length was 6.2 inches with 74% of bluegills 6 inches or greater and a maximum size of 8.9 inches.  Bluegill reproduction was consistent and growth was slow for Duluth Area lakes.  </p>",

There is a gravel, back-in public access on the north side of the lake off State Highway 210.  Cole was last assessed in 2005.  Cole was assessed during the summer of 2013 to evaluate the success of the walleye fry stocking program as well as update information on other fish populations.   <br> \n <br> \nCurrently, 200,000 walleye fry are stocked into Cole every even year.  Walleye abundance of 0.8 was down from 2005 (1.5) but remained average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Walleye average length was 22.8 inches but not enough individuals were sampled to evaluate stock density or growth.  Two year-classes were present (2000 and 2004) which corresponded to fingerling stocked year-classes.  Zero walleyes were captured from several recent fry stocked year-classes (2008, 2010 and 2012).   <br> \n <br> \nA total of 68 largemouth bass were sampled by electrofishing.  The largemouth bass catch rate was 79.7 fish per hour, which is much higher than what was found in 1994 (22.5) and 2005 (15.6).  Average length of sampled bass was 13.7 inches, and growth was slow when compared to other Duluth Area lakes.  All year-classes from 2001 to 2012 were represented except 2011.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike abundance of 5.8 per gillnet lift was down from 2005 (7.2) and was above average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Average length was 20.7 inches and growth was average when compared to other Duluth Area lakes.  All year-classes from 2005 to 2011 were represented, except 2006.  The 2009 and 2010 year-classes were strong, contributing to 83% of the overall catch.     <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie abundance of 1.0 per trapnet lift was down slightly from 2005 (1.1) and was below average when compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Black crappie average length was 8.0 inches and growth was slow when compared to other Duluth Area lakes.  All year-classes from 2005 to 2011 were represented except the 2007 year-class.   <br> \n <br> \nBluegill abundance of 10.9 per trapnet lift was average when compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type and was higher than 2005 (5.9).  Bluegill populations have been steadily increasing in Cole Lake since 1989, when 0.0 per lift were captured.  Average length of sampled bluegills was 5.6 inches and growth was very slow when compared to other Duluth Area lakes.  Age analysis revealed consistent recruitment with all year-classes represented from 2002 through 2010.  The 2006 year-class was strong, contributing to over 48% of the overall catch.     <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch abundance of 0.5 per gillnet lift was average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type and up from 2005 (0.0).  Average length of perch was 6.1 inches but not enough individuals were sampled to evaluate stock density or growth.  All year-classes from 2007 to 2010 were represented, except 2009.  .   <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species sampled include hybrid sunfish, pumpkinseed sunfish, brown bullhead and yellow bullhead. </p>",

Walleye and Largemouth Bass are the primary management species for Cole Lake.   <br> \n <br> \nWalleye fry have been stocked every other year into Cole Lake since 2008.  Prior to that, Walleye fingerlings were stocked biennially from 1998 through 2006.  Walleye abundance of 1.2 per gillnet lift was below average compared to other similar Minnesota Lakes.  Walleye average length was large at 22.6 inches and 4.1 pounds.  Eighty-six percent of Walleye aged corresponded to fingerling stocked year-classes.  Zero Walleye were captured from several recent fry stocked year-classes (2008, 2010, 2012 and 2014).    <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass were sampled during a spring electrofishing survey at a rate of 43.0 per hour.  Average length was 13.1 inches, but only 12% of the sample surpassed 16 inches.  One large specimen was captured that exceeded 19 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie abundance of 0.8 per trapnet lift was well below average compared to other similar Minnesota lakes.  Average size was 8.6 inches but fish up to 11.2 inches were sampled.  Bluegill abundance was above average at 24.6 per trapnet lift but size was small.  Average length was 5.5 inches and only two percent exceeded eight inches.  Yellow Perch were scarce and small. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike abundance of 5.3 per gillnet lift was above average compared to other similar Minnesota Lakes.  Average size was small at 22.1 inches and 2.3 pounds.   <br> \n</p>",

This catch rate, while adequate, represents the continuation of a decline since assessment started in 1956. YEP catch rate was 10  per GN which is at the state and local median. However, like the WAE, they have been in general decline since 1956 inspite of a recovery period between 1974 and 1983. NOP at 3 per GN and WTS at 1.4 per GN are at state and local medians and have exhibited some stability in the past. PMK and BLC have been average and stable until 1989 when their catch rates increased to 22.3 and 11.5 per TN, respectively.</p>",
