                "narrative": "<p>Devil's Lake is a 58.2 acre lake that has an average depth of 13.5 feet.  According to previous lake surveys, Devil's Lake has a history of infrequent partial winterkills dating back to 1951.  The most recent documented partial winterkills occurred during the winter of 1995/1996 and 1996/1997.  Local residents reported many dead northern pike and common carp along the shoreline during the Spring of 1997 and dead bluegills were were observed around the outlet during the winterkill.Various stocking has occurred preceding 1955.  Currently, stocking is not part of the lake management plan due to the lakes small size, lack of public access and its potential for infrequent winterkills.  Also, several fish species can enter the lake via the outlet channel to Fish Lake.In order to evaluate the present fish population status on Devil's Lake, a lake survey was conducted during the week of July 2, 1997.  Survey gear consisted of three gillnets, six trapnets, and shoreline seining (September 12, 1997).Northern pike lengths ranged from 16.2 to 27.2 inches with an average length of 21.6 inches.  The average weight of sampled northern pike was 2.4 pounds.  Growth rates were normal for this lake type.Yellow perch lengths ranged from 5.4 to 9.7 inches with an average length of 7.2 inches.  The average weight was 0.2 pounds.Bluegill lengths ranged from 6.2 to 8.3 inches with an average length of 6.9 inches.  For the first three years of life, most bluegills in Devil's Lake have above average growth and normal growth occurs from age four and older.Other fish that were found during the 1997 survey include;  white sucker, black, brown and yellow bullhead, bowfin, pumpkinseed sunfish, golden shiner, tadpole madtom, creek chub, and Iowa darter.Shoreline seining indicated successful natural reproduction for black bullhead, bluegill, brown bullhead, creek chub, golden shiner, northern pike, and yellow perch.Prepared by Audrey Posterick, Fisheries Specialist</p>",

Northern pike, although occasionally caught by anglers, were not taken at all. Largemouth bass were present in shoreline seining but not in the test nets. Hard data pertaining to the frequency or potential for winterkill is not available but evidence suggests that Devil's Lake suffers at least occasional winterkills. Populations are reestablished by survivors and by migration from Fish Lake. A small bluegill population (5.25/set) currently provides some angling success. Although not specifically indicated by test nets, a high carp population is suspected.</p>",

Devils Lake is a small, clear, shallow lake with a relatively regular shape, which places it in lake class 33. <br> \n <br> \nOnly one northern pike, 27.4 inches, was captured by the gill nets.  The northern pike gillnet catch was 2.3/set in 1998.   <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch were not present in the gillnet sample, but one was present in the trapnets.  The 1998 catch rate was at 18.7/gillnet. <br> \n <br> \nThe trapnet catch rates for bluegill and black crappie were 10.6 and 0.8 respectively, both within the lake class norm.  Black crappie were not present in the 1998 sample while bluegill abundance was much lower.  Black crappie size structure was fairly good with an 8.7 inch average and fish over 11 inches present.  Bluegill averaged 6.1 inches with 21% of the catch exceeding 7 inches. <br> \n <br> \nBlack bullheads dominated the gillnet catch at 73.5/net.  This abundance is very similar to the 1998 rate and well above the lake class norm.  Black bullheads averaged 9.9 inches and 0.6 pounds.  All measured bullheads exceeded 9 inches in length.    <br> \n <br> \nOther species present in order of abundance included: brown bullhead, bowfin (dogfish), freshwater drum (sheepshead), pumpkinseed sunfish, golden shiner, white sucker, and walleye. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",
