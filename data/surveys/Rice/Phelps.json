BLC WERE SAMPLED AT 43.7/TRAP NET IN 1992.  THIS IS UP FROM 2.25/TRAP NET SAMPLED IN 1991.  MOST FISH WERE 4 AND 5, AND MANY AGE 1 FISH WERE ALSO SAMPLED.  GROWTH OF BLC EXCEEDS THE STATE AVERAGE. BLG AVERAGED 5.5/TRAP NET IN 1992.  THIS IS DOWN FROM THE 9.3/TRAP NET SAMPLED IN 1991.  THE BLG GROWTH RATE IS SLOWER THAN THE STATE AVERAGE. THIS MAY REFLECT POOR ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS FOR BLG IN PHELPS LAKE.  NOP NUMBERS WERE DOWN IN 1992 COMPARED TO 1991.  ALL FISH SAMPLED IN 1992 WERE AGES 4 AND 5.  RECRUITMENT OF NOP HAS BEEN LIMITED IN PHELPS LAKE BECAUSE OF SEVERAL DRY YEARS.  THE GROWTH OF NOP IS GOOD, EXCEEDING THE STATE AVERAGE.  WAE WERE SAMPLED AT 22/GILL NET IN PHELPS LAKE AND AT 85.5/GILL NET IN CODY LAKE. MOST OF THE FISH WERE BETWEEN AGES 3 AND 5.  AGES OF THESE FISH DO NOT CORRESPOND WELL WITH PREVIOUS FINGERLING STOCKINGS.  THIS COULD BE A RESULT OF MIGRATION OF WAE FROM LAKE PEPIN OR FROM IMPROPER AGING.  HOWEVER, SINCE THE 1988 YEAR CLASS DOMINATED THE 1991 SURVEY AND WAS STRONGLY REPRESENTED IN THE 1992 SURVEY, AND DIFFERENT INDIVIDUALS AGED EACH SURVEY, MIGRATION MAY EXPLAIN THE PRESENCE OF THIS YEAR CLASS BETTER THAN IMPROPER ADING. THE WAE GROWTH RATE IS COMPARABLE TO THE STATE AVERAGE.  BLB WERE SAMPLED AT 339/TRAP NET IN 1992.  THIS IS UP FROM 197/TRAP NET SAMPLED IN 1991.  MOST OF THESE FISH WERE BETWEEN 4-8 INCH TOTAL LENGTH.  AS THESE FISH INCREASE IN BIOMASS, THEY WILL CONTINUE TO TIE UP MORE OF THE LAKE'S PRODUCTIVITY.  CARP HAVE ALSO SHOWN AN INCREASE IN ABUNDANCE IN PHELPS LAKE.  IN 1992, 9.5/TRAP NET WERE SAMPLED.  MOST OF THESE FISH WERE BETWEEN 10-16 INCHES TOTAL LENGTH.   PMK AND GSF WERE ALSO SAMPLED IN LOW ABUNDANCE.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Phelps Lake in Rice County is a 299 acre lake located east of Montgomery. A DNR-owned public access is located on the north side of the lake, across from the access to Cody Lake near the channel that connects Cody and Phelps. Phelps Lake was surveyed the week of August 11, 2010 to monitor the fish community. <br> \n <br> \nBlack bullheads were the most abundant fish in the assessment. Bullheads averaged 81 fish per gill net lift and 187 fish per trap net lift. Black bullheads ranged between 3.2 and 14.1 inches in length. Average length was 8 inches. <br> \n <br> \nCommon carp were the next most abundant fish in the assessment. Carp averaged 46 fish per gill net lift and 182 fish per trap net lift. 72 percent of carp sampled were under 10 inches. Carp ageing structures were not collected but presumably the majority of fish were young of the year and yearling carp responding to the winterkill vacancy. <br> \n <br> \nThe northern pike population was made up of young individuals. Pike averaged 18 fish per gill net lift and 1 fish per trap net lift. 62 percent of fish were under 15 inches in length, likely all young of the year fish. No fish were larger than 24 inches. Pike have been stocked into connected Cody Lake in 2007, 2008, 2009, and 2010. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch seemed to come through the partial winterkill of 2009-200 fairly well. Perch averaged 21 fish per gill net lift. Perch ranged between 3.5 and 11.7 inches, with an average of 9.3 inches. Reproduction appears successful as young of the year perch were observed in seine hauls for IBI survey. <br> \n <br> \nA young black crappie population will need time to build to fishable levels. Crappies averaged 17 fish per gill net lift. Crappies ranged from 3.9 to 6.7 inches, with a 4.5 inch average. With time and an absence of winterkill, bluegills and crappies should become more abundant. Also observed in the survey were brook stickleback, fathead minnow, green sunfish, tadpole madtom, and white sucker. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers can help maintain or improve the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest. Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for table fare, but encourages release of medium- to large-sized fish. Releasing these fish can help maintain balance in the fish community in Phelps Lake and provide anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future.  <br> \n <br> \nShoreline areas on the land and into the shallow water provide essential habitat for fish and wildlife that live in or near Minnesota's lakes. Overdeveloped shorelines cannot support the fish, wildlife, and clean water that are associated with natural undeveloped lakes. Shoreline habitat consists of aquatic plants, woody plants, and natural lake bottom soils.  <br> \n <br> \nPlants in the water and at the water's edge provide habitat, prevent erosion, and absorb excess nutrients. Shrubs, trees, and woody debris such as fallen trees or limbs provide good habitat both above and below the water and should be left in place. By leaving a buffer strip of natural vegetation along the shoreline, property owners can reduce erosion, help maintain water quality, and provide habitat and travel corridors for wildlife.</p>",

BLC AVERAGED 2.25/TRAP NET COMPARED TO 0.75/TRAP NET IN 1990. GROWTH IS GOOD FOR BLC, AT OR EXCEEDING THE STATE MEDIAN.  BLG AVERAGED 9.25/TRAP NET COMPARED TO 5.25/TRAP NET IN 1990.  BLG ARE REPRESENTED BY AGES 3 AND 4 COMPARED TO THE DOMINANT 2 YEAR OLDS IN 1990.  THE RECENT STOCKING APPEARS TO BE WELL REPRESENTED.  GROWTH IS GOOD AND SLIGHTLY EXCEEDS THE STATE MEDIAN.  BLB HAVE DECLINED FROM 6.33.50/ TRAP NET IN 1990 TO 197.50/TRAP NET.  GROWTH SEEMS TO BE SLOW FOR BLH WITH MANY FISH 6.0-7.0 INCHES COMPARED TO 5.0-6.5 INCH FISH PRESENT IN 1990. CARP INCREASED FROM 1.00/TRAP NET IN 1990 TO 26.75/TRAP NET.  CARP ARE DOMINATED BY A LARGE COHORT OF 9.0-12.0 INCHES FISH WHICH WERE NOT SAMPLED IN 1990.

                "narrative": "<p>Phelps Lake is a 299 acre lake located in Rice County east of the city of Montgomery. A public access is located on the north side of the lake, across the road from the Cody Lake public access. Phelps Lake is connected to Cody Lake by a channel going under the road that separates the two water bodies. Phelps Lake is a shallow lake with a maximum depth of only 8.0 feet. Based on lake characteristics, Phelps Lake is placed in Lake Class 43. Similar area lakes with this classification include Loon Lake (Blue Earth County), Rice Lake (Rice County), and Scotch Lake (Le Sueur County). Phelps Lake is managed for Bluegill, Yellow Perch, and Northern Pike, all of which are stocked as adults as needed either directly or indirectly (stocked into connected Cody Lake). Phelps Lake and Cody Lake experienced winterkills in the winter of 2013-14, after which Northern Pike, Yellow Perch, and Bluegill were immediately stocked to rebuild the population. Phelps Lake was surveyed the week of August 17, 2015 as part of a regular monitoring program conducted by Minnesota DNR. This survey was intended to assess the fish community by deploying four gill nets and nine trap nets, as well as recording water quality parameters. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill <br> \nWith a catch rate of 282.5 fish/trap net, Bluegill dominated the catch throughout the 2015 Phelps Lake survey. This was easily the highest Bluegill catch rate on record for Phelps Lake, as the second highest catch rate was 16.5 fish/trap net (2000). The 2015 catch rate was above the long-term average for Phelps Lake (45.6 fish/trap net). Despite the high catch rate, the Bluegill population was composed primarily of young, small individuals. About 85% of the aged Bluegills were either age-1 or age-2 and the average length of all Bluegills in both net types was only 4.4 inches. However, some large individuals were present, as the largest fish measured 9.2 inches. Adult pre-spawn Bluegill were stocked in Phelps Lake in 2014 to jump start the population after the winterkill during the winter of 2013-14. The large individuals observed in the 2015 survey were likely some of the adults that were stocked in 2014. The high catch of age-1 fish suggested that natural reproduction was successful. Bluegills will continue to be managed in Phelps Lake and stocked following winterkills to serve as a recreational fishery. Additionally, Bluegills are adept at predating on Common Carp eggs, so they will also aid in keeping Common Carp abundance at bay.  <br> \n <br> \n? <br> \nYellow Perch <br> \nYellow Perch were sampled at a rate of 13.7 fish/gill net, which exceeded the long-term average for Phelps Lake (7.4 fish/gill net). The length of Yellow Perch sampled in gill nets ranged from 4.7 to 11.7 inches and averaged 8.3 inches, which indicated that the Yellow Perch population was primarily composed of quality-length individuals. Pre-spawn Yellow Perch adults were stocked in 2014 to help rebuild the population after the winterkill of 2013-14. The presence of age-1 individuals suggested that the stocked population successfully reproduced. Typical of a post-winterkill situation, the Yellow Perch population had fast growth rates. The mean length was 4.6 inches at age-1, 8.6 inches at age-2, and 10.6 inches at age-3. In the event of a winterkill, Yellow Perch will be immediately stocked to rebuild the population.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike <br> \nThe 2015 Northern Pike catch rate was 0.5 fish/gill net, which was less than the long-term average for Phelps Lake (4.1 fish/gill net). The average length of Northern Pike from both gear types was 21.0 inches, indicating a small size structure.  Northern Pike were aged with scales and all fish from this survey were age-2. These fish likely resulted from the stocking event in connected Cody Lake in 2014, when Northern Pike fry were stocked in the spring and adults were stocked in the winter. Northern Pike fry are stocked in Cody Lake two of every three years, which also supplies Phelps Lake since fish can easily move from one lake to another through the channel near the public access. Northern Pike will also be stocked immediately following a winterkill. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Bullhead <br> \nBlack Bullheads were sampled in gill nets at a rate of 132.0 fish/net, which was the second highest gill net catch rate on record for Phelps Lake. This catch rate xceeded the long-term average for Phelps Lake (108.1 fish/gill net). These Black Bullheads ranged in length from 4.1 to 12.5 inches and averaged 7.8 inches, indicating a small size structure. Black Bullheads seldom completely succumb to winterkill, making it difficult to manage density levels. After the severe winterkill of 2013-14, Black Bullhead was likely the only fish species that remained in Phelps and Cody Lakes. <br> \n <br> \nOther Species <br> \nOnly one Common Carp was sampled in this survey, which suggested that Common Carp succumbed to winterkill in 2013-14. Common Carp have the ability to decrease aquatic vegetation density, decrease water clarity, and increase occurrence of blue-green algae blooms, so efforts to reduce abundance in Phelps Lake will continue. Other fish species sampled in the 2015 survey in low abundance included green sunfish (N = 7), Black Crappie (N = 1), Yellow Bullhead (N = 1), and hybrid sunfish (N = 3). <br> \n <br> \nAngling Summary <br> \nAt the time of this survey, the Yellow Perch population was worth the trip to Phelps Lake to catch the abundant, quality-sized fish. Also, keep in mind the extremely abundant, but young population of Bluegill that will be quickly growing into harvestable size. Shoreline angling opportunities exist on the north side of Phelps Lake along the road. Also, a fishing pier is available for use on the south side of Cody Lake, which is connected to and only separated from Phelps Lake by a road.  <br> \n <br> \nAnglers can play an important role in maintaining or improving a fish population by practicing selective harvest. Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for consumption, while encouraging the release of medium to large fish that may contribute to natural reproduction. This practice helps maintain balance in the fish populations and provides anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future. Additionally, smaller fish often taste better and have fewer contaminants than larger, older fish from the same water body. <br> \n <br> \nShoreline property owners also play an important role in the overall health of an aquatic ecosystem, including the fish population. Natural shorelines, including vegetation, woody debris, and bottom substrates, provide valuable habitat for fish and wildlife, help maintain water quality, and reduce bank erosion. Cattails and bulrushes are particularly beneficial for fish spawning, rearing, and feeding. By leaving natural shorelines unaltered or restoring them to natural conditions, shoreline property owners are doing their part to maintain or improve a healthy ecosystem in the lake and protect the resource for future generations. <br> \n <br> \n-Kip Rounds, Fisheries Specialist <br> \n</p>",
