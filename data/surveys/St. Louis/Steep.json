However, the composition changed; in 2018, Northern Pike were absent and Green Sunfish were present for the first time.  Cisco, Rock Bass, and White Sucker were present in both surveys, but sizes were small.  In 1965, 13,689 Ohrid Trout (Salmo letnica) were stocked as fingerlings, however, none were ever captured in any of the assessments. <br> \n <br> \nSteep is a beautiful lake for paddling, camping or swimming but better fishing can be found in some of the neighboring lakes.</p>",
