                "narrative": "<p>Elbow (Bass) Lake is a 189-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located in central Otter Tail County approximately two miles west of the city of Battle Lake, MN.  The immediate watershed consists primarily of agricultural land interspersed with hardwood woodlots.  Elbow Lake has a maximum depth of 46 feet and 42% of the lake is 15 feet or less in depth.  Main lake shoreline substrates consist primarily of sand and gravel.  The substrate in the north bay is predominantly muck.  The secchi disk reading, a measure of water clarity, was 16.0 feet in 2005.  Readings in previous surveys have ranged from 15.0 to 24.0 feet.  A DNR owned concrete public access is located on the northwest shoreline.  Elbow Lake is included in class 28 of the MN DNR lake classification scheme.     Moderate development exists around the lake.  Emergent vegetation (bulrush, cattails, and wild rice) exists in various areas throughout the lake.  Emergent plants are important because they provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines from erosion and can even absorb and breakdown pollutants from the water.  Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish species such as northern pike, largemouth bass and panfish.  They also are important nursery areas for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological importance, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit.     Elbow Lake can be ecologically classified as a bass-panfish type of lake and this is reflected in the assemblage of the fish community.  Elbow Lake contains good populations of northern pike, walleye, largemouth bass, black crappie, and bluegill.       The northern pike population has remained at a moderate density in all of the surveys conducted.  Pike are of good average size with 56% of the fish > 24 inches in length.  Pike ranged in length from 13.9 to 31.2 inches with an average length and weight of 24.2 inches and 3.4 pounds.     The black crappie catch rate has increased from previous surveys. Crappies ranged in length from 5.4 to 12.6 inches with an average length and weight of 9.1 inches and 0.5 pounds.  Sixty-four percent of the crappies were at least 9.0 inches in length.  The 2001 year class appears to be strong and should provide consistently good crappie fishing for several years.       The bluegill catch rate is down from previous surveys but is within the normal range for lake class 28.  The number of fish 7.0 inches or greater in length has increased from previous surveys.  Twenty-nine percent of the bluegills were at least 7.0 inches in length.       A spring electrofishing assessment in 2005 documented a high abundance of largemouth bass.  Bass ranged in length from 4.1 to 16.6 inches with an average length and weight of 10.7 and 0.8 pounds.  Age data indicate that bass reproduction is consistently good.  This is an indication that there is good largemouth bass spawning habitat present in the lake.      The walleye population remains fairly stable and the catch rate is equivalent to the upper limit of the normal range for lake class 28.  Walleye ranged in length from 15.8 to 29.0 inches with an average length and weight of 21.2 inches and 2.9 pounds. The strongest year classes have corresponded to years when walleye fingerlings and/or yearlings were stocked.  Beginning in 2006, the walleye fingerling stocking rate will be doubled.     Anglers can maintain the quality of angling by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large-size fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future.    </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>     Bass (Elbow) Lake is a 189-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located in central Otter Tail County approximately two miles west of Battle Lake, MN.  The immediate watershed is composed primarily of agricultural land interspersed with hardwood woodlots.  The maximum depth of Bass Lake is 46 feet; however, 42% of the lake is 15 feet or less in depth.    The secchi disk reading was 16.0 feet.  Previous secchi disk reading have ranged from 15.0 to 24.0 feet.   <br> \n     Moderate shoreline development exists around the lake.  Homes and cottages compose the majority of the development.  A DNR owned concrete public access is located on the northwest shoreline.  Main lake shoreline substrates consist primarily of sand and gravel.  The substrate in the north bay is predominantly muck.  Common cattail and hardstem bulrush are prevalent in the bay, but emergent vegetation is limited throughout the remainder of the lake.  Emergent plants are important because they provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines from erosion and can even absorb and breakdown pollutants from the water.  Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish species such as Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass and panfish.  They also are important nursery areas for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological importance, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit. <br> \n     Bass Lake can be ecologically classified as a bass-panfish type of lake and this is reflected in the assemblage of the fish community.  Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, Black Crappie, and Bluegill are the dominant gamefish species.  <br> \n     Northern Pike abundance is at a moderate level.  Age data indicate that pike reproduction is consistently good.  Pike ranged in length from 18.4 to 36.4 inches with an average length and weight of 23.4 inches and 2.9 pounds.  Pike attain an average length of 23.9 inches at four years of age. <br> \n     An abundant Black Crappie population exists.  Age data indicate that the 2012 year class is strong and should provide good crappie angling for several years.  Size structure is also good with 64% of the crappies measuring 10.0 inches or greater in length.  Black Crappies attain an average length of 10.8 inches at five years of age.        <br> \n     Bluegills are also very abundant.  Fifty-five percent of the Bluegills were 7.0 inches or greater in length.  Bluegills attain an average length of 7.4 inches at five years of age. <br> \n     A spring electrofishing assessment was conducted to analyze the Largemouth Bass population.  A moderately-high density Largemouth Bass population exists.  Age and length data indicate that bass reproduction is consistently good.  Bass ranged in length from 3.2 to 19.1 inches with an average length and weight of 11.7 inches and 1.2 pounds.  Bass attain an average length of 13.1 inches at five years of age. <br> \n     Anglers can maintain the quality of angling by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large-size fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future. <br> \n     Bass Lake is not listed as an infested water.  Aquatic invasive species are threatening Minnesota waters.  The non-native species can potentially harm water quality, water recreation, aquatic habitat, native species, and fish populations.  Anglers can help prevent the introduction and spread of invasive species by following watercraft transportation laws.  Anglers are required to remove all visible plants, mud, and other prohibited invasive species and drain all water from their boat prior to leaving the water access.     <br> \n </p>",

Few fish over 7.0 inches were sampled in this survey.  <br> \n     Shoreline seining and electrofishing indicated good natural reproduction of largemouth bass.  <br> \n     Yellow perch abundance declined from 61.7 per gill net lift in 1979 to 5.3 per gill net lift in 1988.  <br> \n     Walleye abundance increased from 1.0 per gill net lift in 1979 to 6.7 per gill net lift in 1988.

                "narrative": "<p>Elbow (Bass) Lake is a 189-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located in central Otter Tail County, approximately two miles west of the city of Battle Lake, MN.  It has a maximum depth of 46 feet and 42% of the lake is 15 feet or less in depth.  Main lake shoreline substrates consist primarily of sand and gravel.  The substrate in the north bay is predominantly muck.  The secchi disk reading, a measure of water clarity, was 24 feet in 2000.  Readings in previous surveys have ranged from 15.0 to 17.8 feet.  A public access is located on the northwest shoreline.  Elbow Lake is included in lake class 28 of the Minnesota DNR's lake classification scheme.     Moderate development exists around the lake.  Emergent vegetation (bulrush, cattails, and wild rice) exists in various areas throughout the lake.  Emergent plants are important because they provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines from erosion and can even absorb and breakdown pollutants from the water.  Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish species such as northern pike, largemouth bass and panfish.  They also are important nursery areas for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological importance, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit.     Elbow (Bass) Lake can be ecologically classified as a bass-panfish type of lake and this is reflected in the assemblage of the fish community.  Elbow (Bass) Lake contains good populations of northern pike, walleye, largemouth bass, black crappie, and bluegill.       The northern pike population has remained at a moderate density in all of the surveys conducted.  Pike are of good average size with 37% of the fish > 24 inches in length.  Pike ranged in length from 18.5 to 33.7 inches with an average length and weight of 23.3 inches and 3.1 pounds.     Black crappie numbers are up from previous surveys with many fish over 10.0 inches in length.  Sixty-three percent of the crappies sampled in a special spring crappie assessment were at least 10.0 inches in length.  Crappies in that assessment ranged in length from 4.5 to 13.4 inches with an average length and weight of 10.1 inches and 0.7 pounds.       Bluegill numbers are down from previous surveys but still exceed the normal range for lake class 28.  The number of fish 7.0 inches or greater in length has increased from previous surveys.  Twenty-four percent of the bluegills were at least 7.0 inches in length.       Largemouth bass are likely present in good numbers.  Suitable spawning habitat is prevalent throughout the lake.  Angler reports indicate that a high density largemouth bass population exists.  A spring electrofishing assessment would provide better data on the largemouth bass population.        The walleye population is currently higher than in previous years and equivalent to the upper limit of the normal range for lake class 28.  Walleye ranged in length from 11.9 to 22.4 inches with an average length and weight of 18.2 inches and 2.2 pounds.   The strongest year classes have corresponded to years when walleye fingerlings and/or yearlings were stocked.  Future DNR management will include walleye fingerling stocking on a biennial basis.     Anglers can maintain the quality of angling by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large-size fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future.    </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>     Elbow (Bass) Lake is a 189-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located in central Otter Tail County approximately two miles west of Battle Lake, MN.  The immediate watershed is composed primarily of agricultural land interspersed with hardwood woodlots.  The maximum depth of Bass Lake is 46 feet; however, 42% of the lake is 15 feet or less in depth.    The secchi disk reading during the 2023 survey was 14.7 feet.  Previous secchi disk readings have ranged from 15.0 to 24.0 feet.   <br> \n     Moderate shoreline development exists around the lake.  Homes and cottages compose the majority of the development.  A DNR owned concrete public access is located on the northwest shoreline.  Main lake shoreline substrates consist primarily of sand and gravel.  The substrate in the north bay is predominantly muck.  Common cattail and hardstem bulrush are prevalent in the bay; however, emergent vegetation is limited throughout the remainder of the lake.  Emergent plants are important because they provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines from erosion and can even absorb and breakdown pollutants from the water.  Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish species such as Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass and panfish.  They also are important nursery areas for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological importance, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit. <br> \n     A special gillnetting survey was conducted to analyze the Walleye and Northern Pike populations.  <br> \n     Northern Pike abundance has historically remained at a moderate level.  Age data from this survey and previous surveys indicate that Northern Pike reproduction is consistently good at a low to moderate level.  Pike ranged in length from 20.4 to 37.0 inches with an average length and weight of 25.8 inches and 3.7 pounds.  Pike attain an average length of 25.6 inches at five years of age. <br> \n     Walleye abundance remains low.  Walleyes ranged in length from 16.3 to 23.9 inches with a mean length of 19.5 inches and 2.5 pounds.  Walleyes attain an average length of 15.8 inches at four years of age. <br> \n     Previous special surveys have indicated that the Largemouth Bass and Black Crappie populations have been historically abundant with excellent size structures, consistently good reproduction, and above-average growth. <br> \n     Anglers can maintain the quality of angling by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large-size fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future. <br> \n     Elbow Lake is not listed as an infested water.  Aquatic invasive species are threatening Minnesota waters.  Aquatic invasive species can potentially harm water quality, water recreation, aquatic habitat, native species, and fish populations.  Anglers can help prevent the introduction and spread of invasive species by following watercraft transportation laws.   <br> \n</p>",
