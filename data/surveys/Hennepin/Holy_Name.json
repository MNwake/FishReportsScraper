They have now become the dominant species found in the lake. The black bullhead population is considered high for lakes similar to Holy Name. Their size, however, is relatively small with a mean weight per fish of 0.1 of a pound. Of the bullheads sampled 31% were between 4.5 and 6.5 inches, while 65% were between 8.0 and 10.5 inches.Bluegills and largemouth bass were stocked in 1988. That year a winterkill eliminated all but a few of the bluegills and bass. For four years the lake was also used as a walleye rearing pond but was dropped due to low returns of fingerling walleyes.</p>",
