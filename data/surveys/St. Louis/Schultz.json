Other species'abundances are between first and third quartile ranges and have growth rates comparible to local medians.  Pumpkinseeds have two strong year classes (IV and V) represented in the sample and show below local median growth rates.  Yellow perch are well represented from ages II through V and have above local median growth rates.  The mature walleye population (individuals up to 15 years old) had a mean sample length of 19.9 inches.  Historic netting trends indicate a decrease in white sucker abundance and an increase in both yellow perch and pumpkinseed abundance.  Walleye and northern pike CPUEs have remained relatively stable.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Schultz is a 215 acre lake with 87 acres (40%) of littoral area and a maximum depth of 48 feet.  The lake is located approximately 10 miles north of Duluth, MN.  There is no public access to Schultz Lake.  Schultz was last surveyed in 1992.  Schultz was assessed during the summer of 2012 to update information about fish populations and evaluate the success of the private walleye stocking program.   <br> \n <br> \nPermitted private stocking of fingerling walleyes has occurred on an intermittent basis since 2004.  Walleye abundance of 0.8 decreased from 1992 and was below average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Walleye mean length was 16.3 inches but not enough individuals were sampled to evaluate stock density or growth.  Age distribution showed a 40% correlation between age classes and years stocked suggesting some natural recruitment or immigration of walleye from Island Lake is occurring.  The recent increase in bass/panfish populations may be limiting walleye survival.   <br> \n <br> \nA total of 58 largemouth bass were sampled by electrofishing.  The largemouth bass catch rate was 113.5 fish per hour.  Mean length of sampled bass was 12.4 inches, and growth was slow when compared to other Duluth Area lakes.  All year-classes from 2002 to 2011 were represented except 2008.  The 2005 and 2006 year-classes were strong, contributing to 58% of the overall catch.  Prior to this assessment, largemouth bass had not been documented in Schultz Lake by DNR Fisheries. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike abundance of 1.3 per gillnet lift was down from 1992 (3.5) and was below average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Mean length was 22.0 inches and growth was average when compared to other Duluth Area lakes.  All year-classes from 2006 to 2011 were represented. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie abundance of 0.9 per trapnet lift was up from 1992 (0.5) and was average when compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Black crappie mean length was 7.3 inches but not enough individuals were sampled to evaluate stock density or growth.  Only one year-class (2006) was present in the sample.   <br> \n <br> \nBluegill abundance of 14.3 per trapnet lift was average when compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Bluegill were not sampled in 1992 and were scarce in 1956 (0.8).  Average length of sampled bluegills was 5.9 inches and growth was slow when compared to other Duluth Area lakes.  All year-classes from 2002 to 2009 were represented.   <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch abundance of 2.2 per gillnet lift was down from 1992 (23.8) and was below average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Average length of perch was 7.0 inches and growth was slow when compared to other Duluth Area lakes.  All year-classes from 2003 to 2010 were represented.   <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species sampled include Iowa darter, Johnny darter, bluntnose minnow, blacknose shiner, golden shiner, mottled sculpin, tadpole madtom, central mudminnow, white sucker, hybrid sunfish, pumpkinseed sunfish, black bullhead and rock bass.    <br> \n <br> \nSchultz Lake was included in an index of biotic integrity (IBI) assessment in 2012.  In addition to standard gillnets and trapnets, beach seines and backpack electrofishing equipment were used to index species richness of the nearshore lake habitat.</p>",
