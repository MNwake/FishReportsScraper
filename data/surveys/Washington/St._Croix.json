                "narrative": "<p>Lake St. Croix has a diverse fish community and offers angling opportunities for a variety of species.  Lake St. Croix is extremely popular to recreational boaters, and this use can conflict with angling use, especially on weekends. Since it is a Wisconsin-Minnesota border water, some regulations differ from statewide inland regulations.  Some of these are: it is legal to use two lines; a 15\" minimum size limit for walleye; a 14\" minimum size limit for smallmouth/largemouth bass and a limit of five; a limit of two northern pike (no size restrictions); a 36\" minimum size limit for muskellunge; and a 40 day season for lake sturgeon with a limit of one per season and 50\" minimum size limit.  Other differences from statewide regulations are found in the Minnesota Fishing Regulations.  There are consumption advisories for several species in Lake St. Croix - these are listed in the Minnesota Fish Consumption Advisory published by the MN Dept. of Health.  Marina operators and fishing guides reported poor angling success for walleye, sauger, and white bass among their clients in 1997.  Similar reports have been heard in past, but so have reports of good fishing.  Catfish angling was reported to be good in 1997.   Walleye catch in the 1997 survey increased from the most recent survey (1992) to near the historical average level.  Size ranged from 9 to 21 inches and averages 14 inches, with 45% over the 15 inch minimum size limit.  Sauger catch also increased from 1992 to near historical levels from the last two decades.  Lengths ranged from 9 to 15.5 inches and averaged 12.3 inches, but only 8% were over 15 inches.  Smallmouth bass had the highest gillnet catch rate since 1967.  Electrofishing catch rate was also favorable.  Size ranged from 6 to 20.5 inches, but average length was small (9.2 inches), and only 12% were over the 14 inch minimum.  Northern pike also had the highest gillnet catch rate since 1967 and their population has been gradually increasing over time.  Sizes ranged from 19 to 30 inches and averaged 26.5 inches.  Black and white crappie catch rates both increased from 1992, but are below historical levels.  Both are dominated by large sizes - black crappie averaged 9 inches and white crappie average 10 inches.  Bluegill are present, but in low numbers and an average size of 6 inches.  White bass had the lowest catch rate since 1967, but a large size structure (8 to 17 inches, with an average of 13.5 inches).  Fluctuation the white bass population level has been common in the past.  The channel catfish population is good and seems to be expanding.  Gillnet catch rates have increased in the past decade and the 1997 catch was the highest since 1967.  Size ranged from 9.5 to 25.5 inches with a 17 inch average.  Flathead catfish, largemouth bass, and lake sturgeon were also sampled, but in low numbers.  No muskellunge were sampled, but are stocked.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake St. Croix is considered by the Mn DNR to extend from Stillwater Minnesota to Prescott Wisconsin, a distance of approximately 23 miles. Since the lake is actually a wide area in the St. Croix River, riverine species such as freshwater drum and silver redhorse are abundant. Because the lake forms the border between Minnesota and Wisconsin, fishing regulations differ than those that apply to inland waters. Consult the current Minnesota Fishing Regulations for creel and size limits, along with other rules. The walleye catch has decreased since the 1997 assessment, and is below the long term average. Sizes ranged from 9.1 to 20.6 inches, with an average of 14.9 inches. Of the walleyes sampled, 50% exceeded the 15 inch size limit. Sauger were found to be abundant. Their catch is the highest since seen 1977. The average size sampled was 12.8 inches. Smallmouth bass were sampled in average abundance during this survey. Northern pike numbers are at their highest level recorded in this lake. Their population has continued to increase. The average size sampled was approximately 22 inches in length. The first muskellunge was caught since 1983 during this survey. Stocking began in 1975 with the Shoepac strain, changes to Wisconsin strain, and finnally to Leech Lake strain. Black crappie numbers increased in 2002 to the second highest level for this lake. White crappie numbers are also at high levels. Individuals from both species exceeded 11 inches. Bluegill were sampled at the third highest level for this lake. The average size sampled was 4.56 inches. White bass numbers increased since 1997, but are lower than average. Channel catfish were sampled in average abundance. Individuals up to 29 inches were captured. The average size caught was 15.8 inches. Numerous riverine species including; four species of redhorse, quillback, smallmouth and bigmouth buffalo, carp, mooneye, and longnose gar were also sampled.   </p>",

SIXTEEN GILLNETS, WHICH WERE SET BETWEEN 8/12/92, CAUGHT A TOTAL OF 477 FISH WEIGHING 650.7 LBS.  THE MOST COMMON SPECIES SAMPLED WAS CARP, WHICH MADE UP 22.2% OF THE CATCH BY NUMBER, FOLLOWED BY SLR (13.6%), CCF (12.2%), FRD (9.4%), WHB (7.8%), SHR (5.0%), SAR (4.2%), SNG (3.4%), YEP (2.9%), BIB AND MOE (1.9%) EACH, GLR (1.7%), NOP, SMB, BLC, AND WAE (1.3%) EACH. ALL OTHER SPECIES WERE SAMPLED AT LESS THAN 1% OF THE TOTAL CATCH BY NUMBER.  MAJOR GAMEFISH SPECIES SUCH AS MUE, NOP, WHB, BLG, SMB, WHC, BLC, YEP, SAR, AND WAE WERE ALL SAMPLED BELOW LOCAL OR STATEWIDE MEDIAN ABUNDANCE.  CCF ABUNDANCE WAS HIGH, AND IT WAS THE ONLY GAMEFISH SPECIES SAMPLED THAT WAS ABOVE LOCAL MEDIAN ABUNDANCE.  THERE HAVE BEEN NINE TEST NETTINGS FROM 1967 THRU 1992. HISTORICAL GILLNET RESULTS SHOW THAT THE 1992 CATCHES OF WHB, WHC, AND SAR WERE AT THE LOWEST LEVELS OF THIS PERIOD, WHILE BLC CATCHES WERE AT THEIR SECOND LOWEST LEVELS, AND WAES AT THEIR THIRD LOWEST LEVELS.  CARP WERE SAMPLED AT THEIR HIGHEST LEVEL HISTORICALLY, WITH GILLNET CATCHES OVER TWO TIMES THE LOCAL MEDIAN ABUNDANCE.  RED- HORSE SPECIES WERE HIGH IN ABUNDANCE WITH THE MOST COMMONLY CAUGHT BEING SLR, SHR, AND GLR, RESPECTIVELY.  GIS WERE SAMPLED AT THEIR LOWEST LEVELS HISTORICALLY.  WHILE THE 1988 SURVEY REPORTED THAT GIS MADE UP 40.9% OF THE GILLNET CATCH BY NUMBER, IN 1992 ONLY ONE GIS WERE SAMPLED IN A GILLNET AND NONE IN TRAPNETS.  TWENTY-TWO TRAPNET SETS USED FOR THE SURVEY CAUGHT A TOTAL OF 110 FISH WEIGHING 157.4  LBS.  CARP AND SLR WERE THE MOST COMMON FISH SAMPLED IN TRAPNETS.  CARP WERE SAMPLED ABOVE LOCAL MEDIAN ABUNDANCE.  BLC TRAPNET CATCHES WERE SAMPLED AT THEIR LOWEST LEVELS HISTORICALLY.  TWO MUE WERE SAMPLED AND DETERMINED TO BE AGE II AND FROM THE 1990 STOCKING.  THREE YEAR CLASSES OF SAR WERE SAMPLED WITH 58% BEING AGE II.  THERE WERE 4 YEAR CLASSES OF NOP, 3 YEAR CLASSES OF SMB, AND 2 YEAR CLASSES OF WAE SAMPLED.  ALL FISH EXHIBITED GOOD GROWTH FOR LOCAL AREA.  SHORELINE SEINING CONFIRMED YOY PRODUCTION OF GIS, WHB, YEP, BLG, BLC, AND WAE.</p>",

Highlights of this survey included capture of adult muskellunge, american eel and blue suckers.  Long nosed gar and short nosed gar appeared to be more abundant than in previous investigations of this lake. <br> \n\tSauger were caught in average abundance, with good growth rates, but no older fish sampled.  The oldest sauger aged was IV.  This appears typical for Lake St. Croix - saugers are quite short lived in this system.  Walleye were sampled at historical levels, with growth rates within the historical range.  Northern pike were taken in low numbers, but at a higher rate than earlier investigations of this lake.  Pike numbers appear to be increasing slowly.  Growth of pike was good.  Smallmouth bass were sampled at historical levels, and the fish aged exihibited normal growth for this lake.   <br> \n\tRedhorse species were abundant, but within historical levels. Drum, shad, carpsuckers, buffalo and white bass were also sampled at historical levels.   <br> \n\tCrappie and bluegill were sampled in low abundance - normal for this lake.  Growth of panfish species was above average for the area but at historical levels for this lake. <br> \n\tCatfish sampled in standard gear were taken at historical levels, although no \"trophy specimens\" were taken in this investigation.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Our goal in the 2014 and 2015 surveys was to determine if increased gill net effort and targeted net placement would catch more Walleyes and Saugers for a more detailed analysis of their respective populations and to determine if better locations could be selected for new standard sites to increase sampling efficiency of these popular sport fish.  An experimental survey design was developed to target Walleyes and Saugers to learn more about their respective populations in Lake St. Croix.  The Lake was divided into four segments with increased gill net sets in each segment.  Twenty gill nets were to be set in each segment, and two segments were to be netted in September each year, with all four segments being completed in two years.  At the end of the two year sampling period, net catches were to be evaluated to determine if certain locations could yield a higher catch of Walleyes and Saugers to develop new standard nets sites with higher catch rates of targeted species that would require less effort to duplicate in future sampling years.  Another experiment was conducted by suspending a small number of gill nets to determine if Walleyes and Saugers may be sampled higher in the water column, presumably while chasing bait fish such as Gizzard Shad. <br> \n <br> \nThe 12 gill nets with the highest catches of Walleyes and Saugers in the 2014 and 2015 surveys were selected for 2016 sampling.  Suspended gill nets were not used after 2014 as they were largely ineffective at catching Walleyes and Saugers.  A total of 451 fish were sampled represented by 22 different species.  Over 41% of the fish sampled were considered game fish species (those species which have defined creel limits).  The top five game fish species sampled were Sauger (45), White Bass (42), Channel Catfish (30), Yellow Perch (24), and Walleye (17).  Of the 264 non-game fish sampled, over 40% were Gizzard Shad, over 33% were Freshwater Drum, and over 16% were Silver Redhorse.  Although Freshwater Drum are considered a non-game species, they are frequently harvested from the St. Croix River and are commonly the most harvested non-game fish.  In fact, the most recent creel survey conducted on Lake St. Croix in 2013 estimated Freshwater Drum harvest almost tripled the Channel Catfish harvest during the open water season.  Freshwater Drum were also the most caught and released fish in the 2013 open water creel survey.  The remaining 10% of non-game fish sampled in this survey were gar, Smallmouth Buffalo, Common Carp, Trout-Perch, and other redhorse species. <br> \n <br> \nThe 2016 Walleye catch rate of 1.42 Walleyes/lift was above the average (1.04 Walleyes/lift) for the five gill net surveys from 1992-2009 but was below the catch rate from the 2014 and 2015 surveys (1.83 in 2014, 2.24 in 2015).  The 2016 Sauger catch rate was 3.75 Saugers/lift and very close to the 3.23 Saugers/lift average for 1992-2009 gill net surveys.  At this time, it does not appear that the new targeted net locations has resulted in a meaningful increase in Walleye or Sauger catch rates.  Results from the expanded netting in 2014 and 2015 were promising for Walleye catch rates, but declined in 2016. <br> \n <br> \nIn 2016, almost 59% of the Walleyes sampled were 15 inches or longer.  No Walleyes were sampled exceeding 20 inches.  The largest Walleye sampled in 2016 was 19.76 inches long and weighed 2.42 pounds.  Over 71% of the Saugers sampled were 12 inches or larger, and over 13% were 15 inches or larger.  The largest Sauger sampled was 18.78 inches long and weighed 2.09 pounds. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye ages ranged from 1 to 5 years old.  Minimum harvest length for Walleye in the St. Croix River is 15 inches.  In 2016, average length-at-age for 2-year-old Walleyes was 15.62 inches and was higher than the average length-at-age for Walleyes sampled in the 2014 and 2015 surveys.  The average length-at-age for 2-year-old Walleyes was 13.78 inches in 2014, and 15.01 inches in 2015.  The 2016 survey's length range of 2-year-old Walleyes was 14.45 inches to 16.97 inches and is very good growth when compared to Walleye growth rates in East Metro lakes.  For example, the average length-at-age for 3-year-old Walleyes sampled in White Bear Lake in 2016 (where Walleye are stocked as fingerlings in the fall) was 14.8 inches.  On the St. Croix River, over 33% of the 2-year-old Walleyes sampled were 15 inches or longer.  One of the five Walleyes aged as 1 year old reached the 15 inch minimum length limit.  Average length-at-age for all 1-year-old Walleyes was 12.13 inches.  The oldest Walleye sampled in the 2016 survey was 5 years old and 19.76 inches long. <br> \n <br> \nSauger ages ranged from 1 to 8 years old with 2 year olds the most common age-class.  Average length-at-age was 12.82 inches for 2-year-old Saugers.  Over 91% of the Saugers aged in this survey were 3 years old or younger.  The oldest Sauger sampled was 8 years old and was 18.46 inches long. <br> \n <br> \nUnpublished data from the 2012-2013 creel survey shows over half of the Walleyes harvested measured between 15 and 17 inches.  Date of catch was not analyzed, but based on the 2016 Walleye length-at-age data, over 50% of the fish harvested were 2 years old and roughly 36% of the harvest were 3-year-old Walleyes.  About 2% of the Walleyes harvested in that creel survey were below the 15 inch minimum length limit.  It does not appear the 15 inch Walleye minimum length limit affects Sauger harvest.  Over 61% of the Saugers harvested in the 2012-2013 creel survey were less than 15 inches long.  Again, not accounting for date of harvest for Sauger, about 67% of harvested Saugers were 13 to 16 inches long and are generally 2 to 3-year-old fish based on the 2016 length-at-age data. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie catch/lift was 0.66 in 2014, 0.84 in 2015, and 0.5 in 2016.  The average catch/lift for the last five surveys from 1992-2009 was 0.86.  Only six Black Crappies were sampled in 2016 and their lengths ranged from 5.71 to 8.62 inches.  White Crappie had a similarly low catch.  Five White Crappies were sampled in 2016 and their lengths ranged from 5.47 to 7.2 inches. <br> \n <br> \nThe Yellow Perch population appears stable.  The catch/lift was 1.69 in 2014, 1.97 in 2015, and 2 in 2016.  Most of the Yellow Perch sampled in those three surveys are less than 9 inches long with occasional specimens reaching 10 inches. <br> \n <br> \nThe 2016 White Bass catch was above the average and within the range expected for gill net catches from 1992-2015.  Almost 60% of the White Bass were 1 year old and the maximum age observed was 10 years old.  Average length-at-age 1 was 9.69 inches and ranged from 8.54 to 10.75 inches.  The largest White Bass sampled was 16.18 inches long and aged as 10 years old.  Nineteen of the 22 White Bass aged as 1 year old had reached the generally accepted 9 inch minimum harvestable length desired by anglers.  Of the aged White Bass in the 2016 survey, average length-at-age was 11.99 inches for 2 year olds, 13.82 inches for 3 year olds, and 14.3 inches for 4 year olds. <br> \n <br> \nThirty Channel Catfish (2.5/lift) were sampled in 2016.  This catch rate is slightly below the average of the last seven surveys from 1992-2015 (2.83/lift), but was within the range expected, especially when compared to historical data back to 1967.  Sixty percent of the Channel Catfish were at least 16 inches long, the minimum harvestable length generally accepted by anglers.  However, past creel surveys have shown that anglers frequently harvest Channel Catfish less than 16 inches.  Over 13% of the Channel Catfish sampled were at least 24 inches long.  The largest Channel Catfish sampled in this survey was 25.94 inches long. <br> \n <br> \nThree Lake Sturgeon were sampled in this survey (0.25/lift) and was near the average of 0.22/lift for 1992-2015 surveys.  Lake Sturgeon lengths ranged from 14.65 to 23.7 inches, none of which were tagged or aged.  At least one Lake Sturgeon has been sampled in every gill net survey since 1973.  A separate Lake Sturgeon tagging project was initiated in the St. Croix River in 2003 and through 2015, 659 Lake Sturgeon had been tagged with external Carlin Disc Dangler tags.  This tagging project has resulted in 39 recapture events by MNDNR personnel and 259 reported angler/commercial fisherman recapture events.  Additionally, an acoustic telemetry project was initiated in 2013 and through 2015, 20 Lake Sturgeon had been implanted with acoustic transmitters with an expected battery life of 10 years.  Both tagging projects are ongoing. <br> \n <br> \nFish were collected for contaminant testing in 2009 and 2015.  The 2009 testing updated data that were about 20 years old.  Samples from the St. Croix River were categorized as collected above or below Stillwater, MN.  Species collected were Bluegill, buffalo species, Common Carp, Channel Catfish, crappie species, Freshwater Drum, Mooneye, Northern Pike, redhorse species, Sauger, Smallmouth Bass, Walleye, and White Bass.  Generally speaking, the contaminants in fish flesh have decreased in the last 30 years, with most fish species being listed as \"one meal per week\" for the general population as well as women who are, or may become pregnant and children under age 15.  There are a few species (Common Carp, Northern Pike, Walleye, and White Bass) that are listed as \"one meal per month\" for women who are, or may become pregnant and children under age 15 in the portion of the St. Croix River downstream of Stillwater.  As of 2009, there were no \"one meal per month\" consumption advisories for the general population in the St. Croix River downstream of Stillwater.  However, after testing in 2015, Common Carp were added to the \"one meal per month\" category for the general population as well as women who are, or may become pregnant and children under age 15.  For a detailed and up to date list of meal advice by species in the St. Croix River, visit the Minnesota Department of Health website https://www.health.state.mn.us/communities/environment/fish/#waterbody. <br> \n <br> \nThe 2016 pilot survey of the revised net locations and reduced effort was disappointing.  The goal was to maximize the catch of both Saugers and Walleyes with minimal effort.  However, the low Walleye catch, similar to the standard surveys from 1992-2009, precludes much analysis because of the low sample size.  Catches in the 2014 and 2015 surveys were promising, and if the net locations used in those years had caught similar numbers of Walleye, data analysis would be more meaningful.  Although it is recommended to continue annual gill net assessments in Lake St. Croix, the number of gill nets may need to be increased if the low catch rates cannot be improved upon.  The 2017 survey should duplicate the 2016 survey, and the pilot survey should then be re-evaluated and adjusted as needed to effectively monitor and manage the Sauger and Walleye fishery.  Data collected from an ongoing acoustic telemetry project may help gill netting efforts.  Twenty Walleyes were implanted with acoustic transmitters in 2015, of which 10 had temperature and depth sensors.  Little data exists at this time but the expected battery life of the transmitters is 2.87 to 3.08-years.  This data could provide key insights to Walleye locations and depths throughout the year.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>This was the first attempt at assessing the muskellunge (MUE) population in Lake St. Croix.  Muskellunge are rarely seen during standard fisheries surveys.  Commercial fishermen occasionally see them during large seine haul operations.  Spring trap netting, electrofishing, and commercial seine haul monitoring were viewed as the best way to sample and assess the MUE population in Lake St. Croix.  Placing a Passive Integrated Transponder (PIT tag) into the fish would allow us to identify recaptured fish as PIT tags offer good long term retention. <br> \n <br> \nAll adult MUE sampled in 2012 were measured, received a PIT tag, and were released.  A total of 10 MUE were sampled in the various gears.  One juvenile MUE was gilled in a trap net lead and was released alive, but did not receive a PIT tag.  Nine adult MUE were sampled, two in trap nets, four by electrofishing, and three were captured in commercial seine hauls.  Adult MUE lengths ranged from 26.57-inches long to 48.35-inches long.  Ages, as determined by anal fin rays, ranged from 3-years-old to 13-years-old.  Five of the nine adults were males, one was a female, and three were unknown or not examined. <br> \n <br> \nAn increased presence on Lake St. Croix and increased cooperation with commercial anglers will expand the data set for Lake St. Croix MUE.  Not enough fish were sampled in 2012 to draw any conclusions about the MUE population, but future targeted MUE sampling efforts could yield better locations to increase catch rates.  An early ice out in March with a decrease in temperatures following ice-out may have had negative effects on the first attempt at spring MUE trap netting.  In addition, MUE sampled as by-catch while conducting other surveys will receive PIT tags.  Recaptured MUE could help us determine how much of Lake St. Croix they utilize and/or where they may congregate for spawning or where they congregate at other times of the year.  We may be able to exploit such congregations to get a better sample of the MUE population present in Lake St. Croix.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Our goal in the 2014 and 2015 surveys was to determine if increased gill net effort and targeted net placement would catch more Walleyes and Saugers for a more detailed analysis of their respective populations and to determine if better locations could be selected for new standard sites to increase sampling efficiency of these popular sport fish.  An experimental survey design was developed to target Walleyes and Saugers to learn more about their respective populations in Lake St. Croix.  The Lake was divided into four segments with increased gill net sets in each segment.  Twenty gill nets were to be set in each segment, and two segments were to be netted in September each year, with all four segments being completed in two years.  At the end of the two year sampling period, net catches were to be evaluated to determine if certain locations could yield a higher catch of Walleyes and Saugers to develop new standard nets sites with higher catch rates of targeted species that would require less effort to duplicate in future sampling years.  Another experiment was conducted by suspending a small number of gill nets to determine if Walleyes and Saugers may be sampled higher in the water column, presumably while chasing bait fish such as Gizzard Shad.  <br> \n <br> \nA total of 73 gill nets were set in 2014 and 2015, with a total of 2,538 fish sampled represented by 28 different species and one hybrid (Sauger/Walleye hybrid).  Almost 36% of the fish sampled were considered game fish species (those species which have defined creel limits).  The top five game fish species sampled were Sauger (241), Walleye (149), Yellow Perch (134), Channel Catfish (121), and White Bass (104).  Of the 1,629 non-game fish species sampled, almost 44% were Gizzard Shad and over 30% were Freshwater Drum.  Ninety-six percent of the Gizzard Shad sampled in the two years of this survey were sampled in 2015, most of which were young-of-the-year.  Although Freshwater Drum are considered a non-game species, they are frequently harvested from the St. Croix River and are commonly the most harvested non-game fish.  In fact, the most recent creel survey conducted on Lake St. Croix in 2013 estimated Freshwater Drum harvest almost tripled the Channel Catfish harvest during the open water season.  Freshwater Drum were also the most caught and released fish in the 2013 open water creel survey.  Much of the remaining non-game fish sampled in this survey were gar and redhorse species.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye catch rates were well above average from the previous five surveys.  The average number of Walleyes sampled/lift in the five previous surveys was 1.04.  The Walleye catch/lift was 1.83 in 2014 and 2.24 in 2015, which are the highest catch rates observed since 1973 (4.0 Walleyes/lift).  Sauger catch rates were above average in 2014 and below average in 2015, although not significantly in either case.  The average Sauger catch/lift from the five previous surveys was 3.23.  The Sauger catch/lift was 4.43 in 2014 and 2.26 in 2015.  In 2014, seven gill nets were set suspended 10-15-feet from the water's surface to see if Walleye and Sauger catch increased while chasing bait fish.  The Sauger and Walleye catch in the suspended nets was so low (three Walleyes and five Saugers in seven sets) that they were omitted from the sampling plan in 2015.  The 2014 gill net catch/lift could be further improved by removing the suspended net sets from the analysis.  This would increase the 2014 Walleye catch/lift to 2.18 and Sauger catch/lift to 5.36.  <br> \n <br> \nIn 2014, just over 39% of the Walleyes sampled were 15 inches or larger, and just over 6% were 20 inches or larger.  The largest Walleye sampled was 26.85 inches long and weighed 7.61 pounds.  Over 74% of the Saugers sampled were 12 inches or larger, and just over 19% were 15 inches or larger.  The largest Sauger sampled was 20.28 inches long and weighed 2.19 pounds. <br> \n <br> \nIn 2015, over 61% of the Walleyes sampled were 15 inches or larger, and over 21% were 20 inches or larger.  The largest Walleye sampled was 27.13 inches long and weighed 6.61 pounds.  Eighty-six percent of the Saugers sampled were 12 inches or larger, and over 32% were 15 inches or larger.  The longest Sauger sampled was 17.60 inches long and the heaviest weighed 1.98 pounds.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye ages ranged from 0 (young-of-the-year) to 11 years old.  On average, Walleyes reach the 15 inch minimum length limit for harvest at 3 years old.  Some 2-year-old individuals reach the 15 inch minimum length limit in the fall, but not all 3 year olds had reached 15 inches.  The largest Walleye sampled (27.1 inches) was aged as 11 years old.  Three Walleyes sampled in 2015 were aged as 11 years old.  The other two were only 22.0 and 22.2 inches long.  Over 64% of the Walleyes sampled in 2014 and 2015 combined were 3 years old or younger.  <br> \n <br> \nSauger ages ranged from 1 to 7 years old with 2 year olds the most common age class in 2014 and 3 year olds the most common age class in 2015.  This is the result of a solid year class from 2012 progressing through the system.  Average length-at-age-2 was 12.3 inches and 13.2 inches in 2014 and 2015, respectively.  Twelve inches is generally considered the minimum harvestable size Sauger desired by anglers.  Three Saugers were aged at 6 years old in 2014 and their lengths ranged from 15.2 to 20.3 inches.  Three Saugers were aged at 7 years old in 2015 and their lengths ranged from 16.2 to 17.6 inches.  Seventy-five percent of the Saugers sampled were 3 years old or younger. <br> \n <br> \nAge class data were combined into weighted averages for the 2014-2015 surveys to calculate total mortality rates for Sauger and Walleye.  Total mortality for age 2-5 Saugers was estimated to be 39.2%.  Total mortality for age 2-4 Walleyes was estimated to be 34.26%. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie catch/lift was 0.66 in 2014, 0.84 in 2015, and 0.75 when both years are combined.  The average catch/lift for the last five surveys from 1992-2009 was 0.86.  Ages 1 through 6 were represented in 2014 and ages 1 through 4 in 2015.  In both 2014 and 2015, Black Crappies were reaching 10 inches by age 3.  The largest Black Crappie sampled in 2014 was 12.4 inches and aged as 5 years old.  The oldest Black Crappie in 2014 was 6 years old and measured 11.9 inches.  In 2015, six Black Crappies were aged as 4 years old, the largest measuring 11.3 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nThe Yellow Perch population appears stable.  The 2014 survey captured 59 Yellow Perch resulting in 1.69/lift and the 2015 survey netted 75 Yellow Perch (1.97/lift).  This is slightly above the average catch/lift from 1992-2009.  In 2014, ages ranged from 1 to 5 years old.  The oldest and largest Yellow Perch sampled in 2014 was 10.1 inches long and 5 years old.  Similarly, in 2015, ages again ranged from 1 to 5 years old.  The oldest Yellow Perch sampled (5 years old) was 9.0 inches long and the largest was 9.8 inches long. <br> \n <br> \nThe 2014 survey had the lowest White Bass catch of any survey conducted since 1967.  Only 24 White Bass were sampled in that survey (0.69/lift).  The average catch/lift from 1992-2009 was 3.03.  It was not known if the later survey date was responsible for such a low White Bass catch rate.  Alternatively, the 2015 survey sampled 80 White Bass (2.11/lift), which is more typical of recent surveys.  In 2014, White Bass were aged and represented all ages from 1 through 9, except age 7.  The oldest and largest White Bass was 16 inches long and 9 years old.  Average length-at-age for age-1 White Bass was 9.6 inches and ranged from 8.6 to 10.9 inches in 2014.  In 2015, age-0 (young-of-the-year) through age-11 were all represented except age-9.  The oldest White Bass was aged as 11 years old (15.9 inches long).  The largest White Bass in 2015 was 18.3 inches long, but was aged as only 3 years old.  On average, White Bass reach the generally accepted 9 inch minimum harvestable length by age-1 or 2.   <br> \n <br> \nSixty-four Channel Catfish (1.83/lift) were sampled in 2014 and 57 (1.50/lift) in 2015.  These catch rates are below average from the last five surveys from 1992-2009 (3.30/lift), but is within the range expected, especially when compared to historical data back to 1967.  The largest Channel Catfish sampled was 30 inches long. <br> \n <br> \nLake Sturgeon catch is typically low in experimental gill nets, but at least one has been sampled in every survey since 1973.  Three Lake Sturgeon were sampled in the 2014 survey.  The 2015 survey had the highest catch rate (0.47/lift) for Lake Sturgeon in the last 48 years of gill net surveys.  Eighteen Lake Sturgeon were sampled in this survey and ranged in length from 10.4 to 35.6 inches long.  A pectoral fin ray was removed from most of the Lake Sturgeon for aging.  Ages obtained ranged from 1 to 15 years old, nine of which were 3 years old or younger.   <br> \n <br> \nThe intensive gill netting evaluation is complete and analysis of the 2014-2015 nets sets will determine net locations for a pilot 2016 gill netting survey.  The 2016 survey will include the best nets sets in order to collect as many target fish as possible with the least amount of effort that can be repeated on an annual basis.  This will likely be 12 gill net sets.  The pilot gill netting survey will then be evaluated to determine if adjustments need to be made or if the reduced effort will accomplish the target catch goals to effectively manage the Sauger and Walleye fishery. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Two gill net surveys were conducted on Lake St. Croix in 2021.  The standard survey schedule in mid-September was followed with a second survey utilizing the same net locations the first week of November.  These two surveys combined sampled 1,006 fish represented by 29 different species.  Over 60% of the fish sampled were considered game fish species (those species which have defined creel limits).  The top five game fish species sampled were White Bass (138), Sauger (102), Yellow Perch (98), Walleye (90), and Channel Catfish (82).  Of the 400 non-game fish sampled, 35% were Gizzard Shad, 15.5% were Silver Redhorse, and Freshwater Drum were 14%. <br> \n <br> \nThe 2021 Walleye catch rate of 3.75/lift was down 48% from the highest catch rate ever (7.17/lift) in 2020 but was still above average for the last four surveys in the new net locations established in 2016, and the second highest catch rate in the last 30 years.  Sauger catch rates have been highly variable the last 30 years but were relatively stable from 2016-2020 with an average catch rate of 3.36/lift.  The 2021 Sauger catch of 4.25/lift was well above the average from the last four surveys utilizing the new net locations. <br> \n <br> \nIn 2021, a slight increase in average weight for Walleyes was observed.  The reason for the slight increase in average weight can be explained by the strong 2018 year class progressing through the system.  Average length for all 90 Walleyes sampled was 15.9 inches, slightly above the average from 2016-2020.  Over 61% of Walleyes sampled were over 15 inches and almost 29% exceeded 18 inches.  The largest Walleye sampled in 2021 was 28.15 inches and 8.05 pounds which was the largest Walleye sampled in over 12 years.  Average weight (1.14 pounds) for Saugers was well above the average from the 2016-2020 surveys and, like Walleye, can be attributed to the strong 2018 year class.  Average length for all Saugers sampled was 14.73 inches, well above the average of 13.86 from 2016-2020.  Over 86% of the Saugers sampled were 12 inches or larger, and over 43% were 15 inches or larger.  The largest Sauger sampled was 20.39 inches and 3.53 pounds, the largest sampled in over 12 years. <br> \n <br> \nEighty-five of the 90 Walleyes sampled were aged using otoliths and ranged from 0 to 15 years old.  Minimum harvest length for Walleye in the St. Croix River is 15 inches.  Almost 57% of the Walleyes were 1 or 2-years-old (1-year-old, 23.3%; 2-years-old, 33.3%).  Over 24% of the Walleyes sampled were 3-years-old from the strong 2018 year class.  Growth rates are very good when compared to Walleye growth rates in East Metro lakes.  For example, the average length-at-age for 3-year-old Walleyes sampled in White Bear Lake in 2016 (where Walleye are stocked as fingerlings in the fall) was 14.8 inches.  On the St. Croix River, average length-at-age for 3-year-old Walleyes sampled since 2014 is 17.54 inches.  The oldest Walleye sampled in the 2021 survey was an astonishing 15-year-old male that was 24.17 inches.  Two other Walleyes were aged as 12 years old; one was a 22.36 inch male, the other was a 28.15 inch female. <br> \n <br> \nEighty-six of the 102 Saugers sampled were aged using otoliths.  Ages ranged from 1 to 8 years old with almost 53% being aged as 3 years old, which supports a strong 2018 year class.  An overwhelming majority (88.1%) were 3 years old or younger.  Twelve inches is generally considered the minimum harvestable size Sauger desired by anglers.  Average length-at-age was 13.32 inches for 2-year-old Saugers.  All Saugers at least 3 years old exceeded 12 inches.  The two oldest Saugers sampled were 8-year-old females.  One measuring 19.49 inches and 2.54 pounds, the other was 19.88 inches and 2.65 pounds. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie catch/lift (0.38) was below the average for the last four surveys from 2016-2020 (0.81) and last 11 surveys going back to 1992 (0.82).  The highest catch/lift since 1992 was 1.33 in 2018.  Nine Black Crappies were sampled in 2021, of which seven were collected in the November survey.  Their lengths ranged from 6.69 to 11.81 inches with an average of 9.56 inches.  Only four White Crappie were sampled in 2021, but that is about average.  Gill netting is not a good indicator of the crappie population present in the St. Croix River.  Creel survey data from the winter of 2012/2013 indicated Black Crappie as the primary target species for almost 59% of the anglers interviewed.  Black Crappie comprised 73.4% of all estimated fish harvested that winter.  White Crappie came in a distant second at an estimated 11.5% of all fish harvested.  The importance of crappie to the winter fishery on Lake St. Croix may warrant further sampling, such as spring trap netting, to evaluate a population of such importance to the winter creel. <br> \n <br> \n2021 had the second highest catch rate (4.08/lift) of Yellow Perch since fall gill netting began in 2014.  From 1992 to 2018, Yellow Perch catch rates ranged from 0.75 to 2.75/lift.  The highest catch rate observed was 7.17/lift in 2020.  Most (72.4%) of the Yellow Perch sampled were less than 8 inches.  Average length of the 98 Yellow Perch sampled in 2021 was 7.27 inches and the largest individual was 11.26 inches. <br> \n <br> \nThe 2021 White Bass catch (5.75/lift) was above average for the last four surveys from 2016-2020 and the highest catch rate observed since 1992.  Strong year classes in 2015, 2017, and 2020 have been represented well in each successive survey.  2021 appears to be a strong year class as well with young-of-the-year White Bass accounting for over 15% of the sample.  White Bass fishing should continue to be good the next few years as the strong year classes progress to larger sizes and is well documented in the last six surveys.  White Bass exhibit fast growth and reach the generally accepted 9 inch minimum harvestable length desired by anglers by age 1.  The average 1-year-old White Bass was 10.4 inches and the smallest was 8.98 inches.  All White Bass 2 years old and older were over 12 inches.  The largest White Bass sampled in 2021 was a 17.24 inch, 9-year-old female, and weighed 2.76 pounds.  All ages were represented from 0 to 9 years old, with five 9-year-old White Bass being sampled. <br> \n <br> \nIn 2021, the Channel Catfish catch (3.42/lift) was the highest observed since 2002 and the highest observed in the new fall gill net locations.  Average catch/lift from 2016-2020 was 2.21.  The catch has been relatively stable at low levels since 2009, following a steady decline from 1992-2009.  Almost 71% of the Channel Catfish sampled in this survey were at least 16 inches long, the minimum harvestable length generally accepted by anglers.  However, past creel surveys have shown that anglers frequently harvest Channel Catfish less than 16 inches.  Average weight of Channel Catfish was 2.85 pounds, the second highest average since 1992.  The two largest Channel Catfish sampled in this survey weighed 10.14 pounds, one measuring 29.45 inches, the other 29.96 inches. <br> \n <br> \nFour Lake Sturgeon were sampled in this survey (0.17/lift).  At least one Lake Sturgeon has been sampled in every gill net survey since 1973.  A separate Lake Sturgeon tagging project was initiated in the St. Croix River in 2003.  Through 2017, 714 Lake Sturgeon had been tagged with external Carlin Disc Dangler tags.  This tagging project has resulted in 43 recapture events by MNDNR personnel and 560 reported angler/commercial fisherman recapture events.  Tagging was suspended after the 2017 field season to re-evaluate project goals but tagged Lake Sturgeon continue to be caught and reported by anglers.  Additionally, an acoustic telemetry project was initiated in 2013 and through 2016, 20 Lake Sturgeon had been implanted with acoustic transmitters with an expected battery life of 10 years.  Telemetry data continues to be collected by a network of passive acoustic receivers. <br> \n <br> \nSmallmouth Bass are typically caught in such few numbers in Lake St. Croix gill net surveys that they rarely deserve mention.  However, the 2021 survey had the highest catch rate observed since standardized surveys began in 1992.  While 2.08 Smallmouth Bass/lift is still a low number, the average catch/lift (0.97) from the fall surveys from 2014-2021 is more than double the average catch/lift (0.41) in summer surveys from 1992-2009.  Fifty percent of the Smallmouth Bass sampled exceeded 14 inches with the largest being 19.29 inches and 3.86 pounds. <br> \n <br> \nWhile the surveys from 2016-2018 with revised net locations and reduced effort were disappointing, the large 2018 Walleye year class made 2020 the best gill net survey ever observed for Walleye in Lake St. Croix and the 2021 survey was the second best.  A second fall survey in November showed potential to be a replacement for the September survey.  In November, catch of non-target species declined 25%, while Sauger catch increased 62% and Walleye increased 50%.  Unfortunately, secondary target species like Channel Catfish and White Bass decreased 26% and 59% respectively.  Further comparisons between September and late October/early November gill net surveys should occur to determine if one survey later in the fall is sufficient to meet sample goals. <br> \n <br> \nIt is recommended to continue the annual September gill net assessment in Lake St. Croix with the current number of net sets (12) and net locations and follow up with a late October/early November survey.  Decreased by-catch and increased catch rates of primary target species would greatly increase efficiency.  As the strong 2018 year classes of Walleye and Sauger decrease over time, one survey may not be enough to meet target catch goals.  Survey timing will be re-evaluated following the 2022 surveys. <br> \n <br> \nThe fishing forecast again looks very promising for the next few years.  The strong 2018 and 2019 Walleye and Sauger year-classes continue to get larger, providing quality sized fish for the angler.  The fast-growing 2020 and 2021 White Bass year-classes should provide good numbers of harvestable White Bass and the strong 2015 year-class could produce numerous high-quality fish over 16 inches.  Channel Catfish numbers and size are improving and should provide a worthwhile target for anglers.  Yellow Perch continue to appear to be on the edge of providing some quality fishing but may need another year to grow to a more harvestable size.  The 2021 survey was the best sample ever for Smallmouth Bass.  A decent Smallmouth Bass fishery exists in Lake St. Croix, although the gill net surveys rarely reflect that.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A gill net survey was conducted on Lake St. Croix in 2023 and sampled 524 fish represented by 24 different species.  Over 67% of the fish sampled were considered game fish species (those species which have defined creel limits).  Composition of the top five game fish species sampled were 26.9% Yellow Perch, 17.9% White Bass, 14.7% Sauger, 13.9% Walleye, and 9.6% Smallmouth Bass.  Of the 171 non-game fish sampled, 24% were Silver Redhorse, 24% were Longnose Gar, 12.9% were Freshwater Drum, 12.3% were Shorthead Redhorse, and 8.2% were Mooneye. <br> \n <br> \nThe 2023 Walleye catch rate of 3.77/lift was up 1.6% from the 2022 survey and the second highest catch/lift in the last 30 years.  Sauger catch rates were highly variable over the last 30 years but have been relatively stable from 2016-2022 with an average catch rate of 3.29/lift.  The 2023 catch rate of 4 Saugers/lift was 96.1% higher than the 2022 catch rate of 2.04/lift.  The average length for all measured Walleyes was 15.69 inches, slightly above the 2016-2022 average of 15.56 inches.  Over 61% of Walleyes sampled were over 15 inches and over 14% exceeded 18 inches.  The largest Walleye sampled in 2023 was 21.38 inches and 3.58 pounds.  Average weight for Saugers was 1.12 pounds, significantly higher than the 0.91 average from the 2016-2022 surveys.  Average length for all Saugers sampled was 14.88 inches, well above the average of 14.01 inches from 2016-2022.  Almost 87% of the Saugers sampled were 12 inches or larger, and almost 54% were 15 inches or larger, both large increases from 2022.  The largest Sauger sampled was 18.23 inches and 2.24 pounds. <br> \n <br> \nOnly four Black Crappies were sampled in 2023 but their lengths ranged from 10.83 to 12.52 inches.  No White Crappie were sampled.  Gill netting is not a good indicator of the crappie population present in the St. Croix River.  The importance of crappie to the winter fishery on Lake St. Croix may warrant further sampling.  Tentative plans exist to target crappie using trap nets in the spring of 2024 to better assess the population. <br> \n <br> \nThe Yellow Perch population continues to improve.  2023 had the highest catch rate (7.31/lift) of Yellow Perch since fall gill netting began in 2014 as well as the highest catch rate in the last 31 years.  The increase in catch rate wasn't attributed to a large catch of small fish, rather a significant increase of larger, more desirable fish to the angler.  Just over half of the Yellow Perch sampled exceeded 8 inches and 6.3% exceeded 10 inches.  The Yellow Perch average length was 8.09 inches and the largest individual sampled was 12.52 inches which was the largest sampled since at least 2014.  Most of the Yellow Perch were aged using otoliths.  Ages ranged from 0 to 5 with over 73% of the Yellow Perch aged as 2 to 3-years-old.  The vast majority of Yellow Perch sampled were mature. <br> \n <br> \nThe 2023 White Bass catch rate (4.85/lift) decreased almost 52% from 2022 and was expected.  The dual surveys in 2021 and 2022 had significant decreases in White Bass catch from September to late October.  White Bass catch decreased 59% between the 2021 surveys and 57% between the 2022 surveys.  Although the later survey time frame resulted in fewer White Bass sampled, they were still the second most abundant fish sampled and comprised over 12% of all fish sampled.  Over 66% of the White Bass measured were 12 inches or larger.  The largest White Bass sampled in 2023 was a 17.2 inch, 10-year-old female, and weighed 2.76 pounds.  Sex and maturity data collected since 2014 shows over half of males are mature at age-1 and females mature at age-2. <br> \n <br> \nThe Channel Catfish catch (1.92/lift) was the lowest observed since 2015.  It is not clear if the later fall survey has any effect on the Channel Catfish catch rate.  A decrease of 26% was observed in the later fall survey in 2021, while there was a 15% increase in catch in the later fall survey in 2022.  Sixty-eight percent of the Channel Catfish sampled in this survey were at least 16 inches long.  Pectoral spines were removed from all 25 Channel Catfish sampled for aging.  One spine was not able to be aged accurately.  Ages ranged from 2 to 14-years-old with age-3 the most abundant age-class sampled.  The largest Channel Catfish sampled in this survey was 28.74 inches, 8.98 pounds, and aged as 14-years-old. <br> \n <br> \nTwo Lake Sturgeon were sampled in this survey (0.15/lift), both were tagged and released.  At least one Lake Sturgeon has been sampled in every gill net survey since 1973.  There are plans to increase targeted Lake Sturgeon sampling and tagging in the coming years.  A standardized large mesh gill net survey is also being planned to better categorize the existing Lake Sturgeon population and track changes over time. <br> \n <br> \nSmallmouth Bass are typically caught in such few numbers in Lake St. Croix gill net surveys that they rarely deserve mention.  However, the 2021, 2022, and 2023 surveys had the highest catch rates observed since standardized surveys began in 1992.  While 2.62 Smallmouth Bass/lift is still a low number, the average catch/lift (1.11) from the fall surveys from 2014-2022 is more than double the average catch/lift (0.41) in summer surveys from 1992-2009.  Catch rates appear to increase later in the fall as the catch increased 113% from the September 2021 survey to the November 2021 survey and experienced a similar increase of 133% from the September 2022 survey to the October 2022 survey.  All Smallmouth Bass sampled exceeded 9 inches and all were mature.  Almost 68% of the Smallmouth Bass sampled exceeded 14 inches with the largest being 19.17 inches and 4.03 pounds. <br> \n <br> \nThe 2024 fishing forecast looks average for Walleye, Sauger, White Bass, and Channel Catfish.  Yellow Perch could be a potential target for anglers as the quantity and quality have both improved and are the best that has ever been documented in Lake St. Croix.  Since Yellow Perch are not a typical angler target in Lake St. Croix, it is unknown how long it will take for anglers take advantage of that developing fishery.  Gill net surveys are not a good barometer for Smallmouth Bass.  However, this survey sampled the most Smallmouth Bass since 1992.  This may be partly due to the transition to netting later in the fall which appears to increase the catch of Smallmouth Bass.  One wildcard that could impact angler success is the Gizzard Shad population. Given the mild winter, survival of Gizzard Shad is expected to be higher than typical winters.  This could result in a larger than normal spawning population with the potential for a large year-class.  Abundant Gizzard Shad could make fishing difficult as they are the main forage for many predator species in Lake St. Croix.  However, the drivers for Gizzard Shad recruitment are not fully understood in Lake St. Croix. <br> \n</p>",

The only three MUE handled were during a commercial seine haul at Point Douglas in October.  All three fish were measured and weighed.  Lengths of the three MUE were 32.09, 37.64, and 45.28-inches long.  Weights were 5.93, 10.85, and 22.53-pounds, respectively. <br> \n <br> \nTwo of the three MUE were implanted with PIT tags.  One of the MUE sampled was a recapture from a 2012 seine haul at the same location.  In 2012, this fish was 34.92-inches long and weighed 8.2 pounds, and was aged as 6-years-old.  Upon recapture one year later, this fish was 37.64-inches long and weighed 10.85-pounds. <br> \n <br> \nAges from the other two MUE were 10-years-old for the 45.28-inch long fish and 4-years-old for the 32.09-inch long fish. <br> \n <br> \nMUE sampled in future years will continue to be measured and implanted with PIT tags.  As the number of MUE sampled and recaptured increases, we will learn more about preferred locations to better target the MUE population at large.  An acoustic receiver network is already deployed in the St. Croix, Minnesota, and Mississippi rivers.  Implanting acoustic transmitters into MUE would greatly speed the process of learning key habitats for targeted MUE sampling.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>The 2017 gill net survey was the second gill net survey utilizing 12 overnight gill net sets which were selected from extensive experimental netting effort conducted in 2014 and 2015.  A total of 453 fish were sampled represented by 21 different species plus one hybrid.  Over 46% of the fish sampled were considered game fish species (those species which have defined creel limits).  The top five game fish species sampled were White Bass (57), Sauger (40), Channel Catfish (24), Smallmouth Bass (24), and Walleye (20).  Of the 242 non-game fish sampled, over 48% were Gizzard Shad, over 18% were Freshwater Drum, and over 11% were Silver Redhorse. <br> \n <br> \nThe 2017 Walleye catch rate of 1.67 Walleyes/lift was well above the average for the five gill net surveys from 1992-2009.  If not for the extensive experimental netting conducted in 2014 and 2015, this would have been the highest Walleyes/lift since at least 1992.  The 2017 Sauger catch rate was 3.33 Saugers/lift and very close to the 3.23 Saugers/lift average for 1992-2009 gill net surveys.  Since 1992, Sauger catch rates have been highly variable ranging from a low of 1.13 Saugers/lift in 2009 to a high of 6.38 in 2002. <br> \n <br> \nIn 2017, average weight for Walleyes sampled was 1.86 pounds, well above the average (1.24 pounds) from 1992-2009.  The reason for the increased Walleye average weight can be explained by the lack of small Walleyes sampled.  Ninety percent of the Walleyes sampled were 15 inches or longer and 10% exceeded 20 inches.  The largest Walleye sampled in 2017 was 24.61 inches long and weighed 5.29 pounds.  Average weight (0.8 pounds) for Saugers was also above the average (0.66 pounds) from the 1992-2009 surveys.  Over 89% of the Saugers sampled were 12 inches or larger, and over 21% were 15 inches or larger.  The longest Sauger sampled was 18.58 inches long and weighed 1.03 pounds.  The heaviest Sauger sampled was 16.57 inches long and weighed 1.40 pounds. <br> \n <br> \nAll 20 Walleyes sampled were aged using otoliths and ranged from 2 to 12 years old.  Minimum harvest length for Walleye in the St. Croix River is 15 inches.  In 2017, average length-at-age for 2-year-old Walleyes was 15.51 inches and was higher than the average length-at-age for Walleyes sampled in the 2014 and 2015 surveys and slightly below the 2016 survey.  The average length-at-age for 2-year-old Walleyes was 13.78 inches in 2014, 15.01 inches in 2015, and 15.62 in 2016.  The 2017 survey's length range of 2-year-old Walleyes was 14.72 inches to 16.22 inches and is very good growth when compared to Walleye growth rates in East Metro lakes.  For example, the average length-at-age for 3-year-old Walleyes sampled in White Bear Lake in 2016 (where Walleye are stocked as fingerlings in the fall) was 14.8 inches.  On the St. Croix River, 75% of the 2-year-old Walleyes sampled were 15 inches or longer.  The oldest Walleye sampled in the 2017 survey was 12 years old and was only 20.12 inches long.  The largest Walleye sampled was 24.61 inches long and aged as 9 years old. <br> \n <br> \nThirty Saugers were aged using otoliths and 10 were assigned ages based on an age-length key.  Ages ranged from 1 to 6 years old with 2 year olds the most common age-class.  Average length-at-age was 13.03 inches for 2-year-old Saugers.  Twelve inches is generally considered the minimum harvestable size Sauger desired by anglers.  Over 82% of the Saugers aged in this survey were 3 years old or younger.  The oldest Sauger sampled was 6 years old and was 15.75 inches long.  The largest Sauger was 18.58 inches long and aged as 5 years old. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie catch/lift was 0.66 in 2014, 0.84 in 2015, 0.5 in 2016, and 0.83 in 2017.  The average catch/lift for the five surveys from 1992-2009 was 0.86.  Only 10 Black Crappies were sampled in 2017, which is average, and their lengths ranged from 6.18 to 10.39 inches.  Only one White Crappie was sampled in 2017 and measured 10.67 inches long. <br> \n <br> \nThe Yellow Perch population appears stable.  The catch/lift was 1.69 in 2014, 1.97 in 2015, 2 in 2016, and 1.5 in 2017.  Most of the Yellow Perch sampled in those four surveys are less than 9 inches long with occasional specimens reaching 10 inches.  Average length of the 18 Yellow Perch sampled in 2017 was 7.62 inches with the largest sampled measuring 8.74 inches long. <br> \n <br> \nThe 2017 White Bass catch (4.75/lift) was above the average for gill net catches from 1992-2016 (2.68/lift) and was the highest catch rate since 2006 (5.19/lift).  Most of the White Bass sampled since 2014 have been aged using otoliths.  Forty-four of the 57 White Bass sampled in this survey were aged and the 13 un-aged fish were assigned an age based on an age-length key.  Almost 60% of the White Bass were 1 year old in the 2016 survey.  Over 61% of the White Bass were aged as 2 years old, showing a strong 2015 year class progression.  The maximum age observed in 2017 was 11 years old.  The largest White Bass sampled was 15.83 inches long and aged as 8 years old.  The oldest White Bass, aged as 11 years old, was 15.31 inches long.  All 53 of the White Bass sampled aged as 1 year old and older had reached the generally accepted 9 inch minimum harvestable length desired by anglers.  Of the aged White Bass in the 2017 survey, average length-at-age was 12.88 inches for 2 year olds, 13.98 inches for 3 year olds, 14.84 inches for 4 year olds, and 15.07 inches for 5 year olds. <br> \n <br> \nTwenty-four Channel Catfish (2/lift) were sampled in 2017.  This catch rate is below the average of the last eight surveys from 1992-2016 (2.79/lift), but was within the range expected, especially when compared to historical data back to 1967.  Almost 71% of the Channel Catfish were at least 16 inches long, the minimum harvestable length generally accepted by anglers.  However, past creel surveys have shown that anglers frequently harvest Channel Catfish less than 16 inches.  Over 29% of the Channel Catfish sampled were at least 24 inches long.  The largest Channel Catfish sampled in this survey was 29.53 inches long. <br> \n <br> \nOne Lake Sturgeon was sampled in this survey (0.08/lift) and was below the average of 0.23/lift for 1992-2016 surveys.  At least one Lake Sturgeon has been sampled in every gill net survey since 1973.  A separate Lake Sturgeon tagging project was initiated in the St. Croix River in 2003 and through 2016, 684 Lake Sturgeon had been tagged with external Carlin Disc Dangler tags.  This tagging project has resulted in 41 recapture events by MNDNR personnel and 318 reported angler/commercial fisherman recapture events.  Additionally, an acoustic telemetry project was initiated in 2013 and through 2016, 20 Lake Sturgeon had been implanted with acoustic transmitters with an expected battery life of 10 years.  Both tagging projects are ongoing. <br> \n <br> \nFish were collected for contaminant testing in 2009 and 2015.  The 2009 testing updated data that were about 20 years old.  Samples from the St. Croix River were categorized as collected above or below Stillwater, MN.  Species collected were Bluegill, buffalo species, Common Carp, Channel Catfish, crappie species, Freshwater Drum, Mooneye, Northern Pike, redhorse species, Sauger, Smallmouth Bass, Walleye, and White Bass.  Generally speaking, the contaminants in fish flesh have decreased in the last 30 years, with most fish species being listed as \"one meal per week\" for the general population as well as women who are, or may become pregnant and children under age 15.  There are a few species (Common Carp, Northern Pike, Walleye, and White Bass) that are listed as \"one meal per month\" for women who are, or may become pregnant and children under age 15 in the portion of the St. Croix River downstream of Stillwater.  As of 2009, there were no \"one meal per month\" consumption advisories for the general population in the St. Croix River downstream of Stillwater.  However, after testing in 2015, Common Carp were added to the \"one meal per month\" category for the general population as well as women who are, or may become pregnant and children under age 15.  For a detailed and up to date list of meal advice by species in the St. Croix River, visit the Minnesota Department of Health website https://www.health.state.mn.us/communities/environment/fish/#waterbody. <br> \n <br> \nLike 2016, the 2017 survey of the revised net locations and reduced effort was disappointing.  The goal was to maximize the catch of both Sauger and Walleye with minimal effort.  However, the low Walleye catch, similar to the standard surveys from 1992-2009, precludes much analysis because of the low sample size.  Catches in the 2014 and 2015 surveys were promising, and if the net locations used in those years had caught similar numbers of Walleye, data analysis would be more meaningful.  Although it is recommended to continue annual gill net assessments in Lake St. Croix, the number of gill nets may need to be increased if the low catch rates cannot be improved upon.  The 2018 survey should duplicate the 2016 and 2017 surveys.  If Walleye and Sauger catch continue to be low, it is advised to re-set the nets in the best locations to increase numbers of Walleye and Sauger.  Data collected from an ongoing acoustic telemetry project may help gill netting efforts.  Twenty Walleyes were implanted with acoustic transmitters in 2015, of which 10 had temperature and depth sensors.  Little data exists at this time but the expected battery life of the transmitters is 2.87 to 3.08-years.  This data could provide key insights to Walleye locations and depths throughout the year.  However, early telemetry analysis shows a 26-36% reduction of Walleyes at large per year.  This could be due to mortality or fish residing in areas out of range of the passive acoustic receivers.  After telemetry data was downloaded in the fall of 2017, nine Walleyes were still being detected, one of which had traveled to Pool 4 of the Mississippi River.</p>",

A total of 566 fish were sampled represented by 22 different species.  Almost 55% of the fish sampled were considered game fish species (those species which have defined creel limits).  The top five game fish species sampled were Walleye (86), Yellow Perch (86), White Bass (46), Sauger (35), and Channel Catfish (22).  Of the 257 non-game fish sampled, 26.9% were Gizzard Shad, 26.1% were Freshwater Drum, and 17.5% were Silver Redhorse. <br> \n <br> \nThe 2020 Walleye catch rate of 7.17 Walleyes/lift was the highest catch rate ever observed and over five times above the average (1.39 Walleyes/lift) for the previous three surveys from 2016-2018.  Previously, the highest Walleyes/lift in the last 30 years was 2.24/lift in 2015.  The 2020 Sauger catch rate was 2.92 Saugers/lift, below the 3.5 Saugers/lift average for the 2016-2018 gill net surveys.  Since 1992, Sauger catch rates have been highly variable ranging from a low of 1.13 Saugers/lift in 2009 to a high of 6.38 in 2002 but have been relatively stable since 2016. <br> \n <br> \nIn 2020, average weight for Walleyes sampled was 1.21 pounds, which is slightly below the average from 2016-2018 (1.39 pounds) but within the range expected.  The reason for the decreased Walleye average weight is explained by the number of small Walleyes sampled.  Almost 47% of the Walleyes sampled were under the 15 inch minimum length limit.  Average length for all 86 Walleyes sampled was 14.69 inches and was the lowest average length observed from the previous five surveys since 2014.  Over 53% were over 15 inches and over 11% exceeded 18 inches.  The largest Walleye sampled in 2020 was 25.16 inches and 5.62 pounds.  Average weight (1.01 pounds) for Saugers was above the average (0.79 pounds) from the 2016-2018 surveys.  Average length for all Saugers sampled was 14.28 inches.  Almost 83% of the Saugers sampled were 12 inches or larger, and over 31% were 15 inches or larger.  The largest Sauger sampled was 19.06 inches and 2.43 pounds. <br> \n <br> \nSeventy-two of the 86 Walleyes sampled were aged using otoliths and ranged from 0 to 12 years old.  Minimum harvest length for Walleye in the St. Croix River is 15 inches.  Over 79% of the aged and assigned-age Walleyes were 1 or 2-years-old (1-year-old, 24.4%; 2-years-old, 54.7%).  Average length-at-age 2 exceeded 15 inches in 2015, 2016, 2017, and 2020.  Outside of one 15 inch Walleye sampled in 2016 aged as 1-year-old, all Walleyes less than 2-years-old have been under the 15 inch minimum length limit.  In 2020, all but one of the Walleyes that were at least 3-years-old were over 15 inches.  That one Walleye was 13.86 inches long and 3-years-old.  Growth rates are very good when compared to Walleye growth rates in East Metro lakes.  For example, the average length-at-age for 3-year-old Walleyes sampled in White Bear Lake in 2016 (where Walleye are stocked as fingerlings in the fall) was 14.8 inches.  On the St. Croix River, average length-at-age for 3-year-old Walleyes sampled since 2014 is 17.48 inches.  The oldest Walleye sampled in the 2020 survey was 12 years old and 25.16 inches. <br> \n <br> \nAll but one of the 35 Saugers sampled were aged using otoliths.  Ages ranged from 1 to 8 years old with 2 year olds the most common age-class, which is common.  Over 74% of the Saugers aged and assigned an age in this survey were 3 years old or younger.  Twelve inches is generally considered the minimum harvestable size Sauger desired by anglers.  Average length-at-age was 12.83 inches for 2-year-old Saugers and all Saugers at least 2 years old exceeded 12 inches.  The oldest Sauger sampled was 8-years-old and was 18.9 inches and 2.24 pounds. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie catch/lift (0.58) was below the average for the last three surveys for 2016-2018 (0.89) and last 10 surveys going back to 1992 (0.85).  The highest catch/lift since 1992 was 1.33 in 2018.  Seven Black Crappies were sampled in 2020 and their lengths ranged from 3.94 to 12.4 inches with an average of 7.6 inches.  Only one White Crappie was sampled in 2020.  Gill netting is not a good indicator of the crappie population present in the St. Croix River.  Creel survey data from the winter of 2012/2013 indicated Black Crappie as the primary target species for almost 59% of the anglers interviewed.  Black Crappie comprised 73.4% of all estimated fish harvested that winter.  White Crappie came in a distant second at an estimated 11.5% of all fish harvested.  The importance of crappie to the winter fishery on Lake St. Croix may warrant further sampling, such as spring trap netting, to evaluate a population of such importance to the winter creel. <br> \n <br> \n2018 had the lowest catch rate (0.75/lift) of Yellow Perch since fall gill netting began in 2014 and was also lower than all surveys dating back to 1992.  2020 was the complete opposite with 7.17 Yellow Perch/lift, which is the highest catch rate observed from the previous 10 surveys since 1992.  Most (88%) of the Yellow Perch sampled were less than 8 inches.  Average length of the 86 Yellow Perch sampled in 2020 was 6.92 inches and the largest individual was 9.53 inches. <br> \n <br> \nThe 2020 White Bass catch (3.83/lift) was above average for the last three surveys from 2016-2018.  Most of the White Bass sampled since 2014 have been aged using otoliths.  All but two of the 46 White Bass sampled in 2020 were aged with otoliths.  Strong year classes don't always track well between sampling years for White Bass.  However, when young-of-the-year White Bass are sampled in any number, that tends to indicate a strong year class.  Year classes from 2015 and 2017 were well represented in the 2020 survey and 2020 had the highest catch of young-of-the year White Bass observed when compared to the last five surveys.  White Bass fishing should be good the next few years as White Bass grow fast and reach the generally accepted 9 inch minimum harvestable length desired by anglers by age 1.  The smallest 1 year old White Bass sampled in 2020 was 10.87 inches.  The two largest White Bass sampled in 2020 were 15.91 inches.  One was an 8 year old male, the other was a 5 year old female. <br> \n <br> \nTwenty-two Channel Catfish (1.83/lift) were sampled in 2020.  This catch rate is below the average (2.33/lift) of the three surveys from 2016-2018 and also below the average (2.07) from the five most recent surveys from 2014-2018.  However, the catch has been relatively stable since 2009.  The number of Channel Catfish/lift seems to be lower in the fall gill net surveys versus the summer surveys, but was on a downward trend from 1992-2009.  Almost 41% of the Channel Catfish sampled were at least 16 inches long, the minimum harvestable length generally accepted by anglers.  However, past creel surveys have shown that anglers frequently harvest Channel Catfish less than 16 inches.  The largest Channel Catfish sampled in this survey was 23.62 inches. <br> \n <br> \nThree Lake Sturgeon were sampled in this survey (0.25/lift) and the catch rate was slightly above the average of 0.22/lift for the 2016-2018 surveys.  At least one Lake Sturgeon has been sampled in every gill net survey since 1973.  A separate Lake Sturgeon tagging project was initiated in the St. Croix River in 2003.  Through 2017, 714 Lake Sturgeon had been tagged with external Carlin Disc Dangler tags.  This tagging project has resulted in 43 recapture events by MNDNR personnel and 508 reported angler/commercial fisherman recapture events.  Tagging was suspended after the 2017 field season to re-evaluate project goals but tagged Lake Sturgeon continue to be caught and reported by anglers.  Additionally, an acoustic telemetry project was initiated in 2013 and through 2016, 20 Lake Sturgeon had been implanted with acoustic transmitters with an expected battery life of 10 years.  Telemetry data continues to be collected by a network of passive acoustic receivers. <br> \n <br> \nFish are tested for contaminants about every five years.  On occasion, fish are tested more frequently outside of the five year collection schedule.  The Minnesota Department of Health published updated consumption guidelines in September, 2020.  The St. Croix River is split into two categories based on the area of fish collection as collected above or below Stillwater, MN.  Generally speaking, the contaminants in fish flesh have decreased in the last 30 years, with most fish species currently being listed under the statewide safe-eating guidelines.  The most recent St. Croix River guidelines recommend no more than one meal/month of buffalo species and Channel Catfish downstream of Stillwater for the general population, and no more than one meal/month of White Bass upstream of Stillwater for the general population.  No fish species are categorized as \"do not eat\" for the St. Croix River.  For detailed and up to date site specific and statewide meal advice guidelines, see the list for \"pregnant women, women who could become pregnant, and children under age 15,\" and the companion list for \"men, boys age 15 and over, and women not planning to become pregnant,\" visit the Minnesota Department of Health website https://www.health.state.mn.us/communities/environment/fish/#waterbody. <br> \n <br> \nWhile the surveys from 2016-2018 with revised net locations and reduced effort were disappointing, the large 2018 Walleye year class made 2020 the best gill net survey ever observed for Walleye in Lake St. Croix.  Plans to conduct a second survey later in the fall to see if Walleye and Sauger catch rates improve are still being considered.  A second survey was not possible in 2018 because of boat trailer maintenance issues and conflicting field work.  The 2019 survey was cancelled due to high water and the no-wake restriction.  A second survey was not conducted in 2020 because of conflicting field work and the September survey was so good that additional Walleye were not needed. <br> \n <br> \nIt is recommended to continue the annual September gill net assessment in Lake St. Croix with the current number of net sets (12) and net locations.  The scheduled 2021 survey is anticipated to provide a fair number of Walleye.  If the Walleye catch is less than 5/lift, it will be recommended to conduct a second survey later in the fall if conflicting field work, staffing levels and water levels allow it.  A survey later in the fall may or may not provide higher Walleye catch rates.  Ideally, one survey would collect enough fish to allow for meaningful population analyses.  It may simply be that one survey needs more netting effort to provide the necessary numbers of fish. <br> \n <br> \nThe fishing forecast looks very promising for the next few years.  The 2018 and 2019 Walleye year-classes and the fast growing 2020 White Bass year-class should provide the best fishing opportunities.  While Lake St. Croix has not been a quality Yellow Perch destination, if the abundant 6-7 inch fish continue to grow, there may be a worthwhile Yellow Perch population for anglers to target around 2022-2023.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>The 2018 gill net survey was the third gill net survey utilizing 12 overnight gill net sets which were selected from extensive experimental netting effort conducted in 2014 and 2015.  A total of 379 fish were sampled represented by 22 different species.  Almost 42% of the fish sampled were considered game fish species (those species which have defined creel limits).  The top five game fish species sampled were Sauger (41), Channel Catfish (30), Black Crappie (16), Walleye (13), and White Bass (13).  Of the 220 non-game fish sampled, over 56% were Gizzard Shad, 20% were Freshwater Drum, and over 13% were Silver Redhorse. <br> \n <br> \nThe 2018 Walleye catch rate of 1.08 Walleyes/lift was just above the average (1.04 Walleyes/lift) for the five gill net surveys from 1992-2009.  This is the lowest Walleyes/lift since the new 12 net sites were adopted in 2016.  The 2018 Sauger catch rate was 3.42 Saugers/lift and very close to the 3.23 Saugers/lift average for 1992-2009 gill net surveys.  Since 1992, Sauger catch rates have been highly variable ranging from a low of 1.13 Saugers/lift in 2009 to a high of 6.38 in 2002. <br> \n <br> \nOnly 13 Walleyes were sampled and the average length was 14.98 inches.  Over 46% were over 15 inches long and over 38% exceeded 18 inches.  The largest Walleye sampled in 2018 was 23.66 inches long and weighed 4.63 pounds.  Over 95% of the Saugers sampled were 12 inches or larger, and over 24% were 15 inches or larger.  The largest Sauger sampled was 17.56 inches long and weighed 1.83 pounds. <br> \n <br> \nAll 13 Walleyes sampled were aged using otoliths and ranged from 0 to 9 years old.  Minimum harvest length for Walleye in the St. Croix River is 15 inches.  From 2015-2017, average length-at-age 2 exceeded 15 inches.  No 2-year-old Walleyes were sampled in 2018.  All Walleyes less than 2-years-old were under the 15 inch minimum length limit.  All but one of the Walleyes that were at least 3-years-old were over 15 inches.  That one Walleye was 14.45 inches long and 4-years-old.  Growth rates are very good when compared to Walleye growth rates in East Metro lakes.  For example, the average length-at-age for 3-year-old Walleyes sampled in White Bear Lake in 2016 (where Walleye are stocked as fingerlings in the fall) was 14.8 inches.  On the St. Croix River, average length-at-age for 3-year-old Walleyes sampled since 2014 is 17.53 inches.  The oldest Walleye sampled in the 2018 survey was 9 years old and was 23.66 inches long. <br> \n <br> \nAll 41 Saugers sampled were aged using otoliths.  Ages ranged from 1 to 6 years old with 3 year olds the most common age-class.  The 2015 year-class appears to have been strong as 2-year-old Saugers were the most abundant age-class in the 2017 survey and 3-year-olds were the most abundant age-class in the 2018 survey.  Over 78% of the Saugers aged in this survey were 3 years old or younger.  Twelve inches is generally considered the minimum harvestable size Sauger desired by anglers.  Average length-at-age was 13.69 inches for 2-year-old Saugers and all Saugers at least 2 years old exceeded 12 inches.  Two Saugers sampled were 6 years old and measured 17.48 and 17.56 inches long. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie catch/lift was 0.66 in 2014, 0.84 in 2015, 0.5 in 2016, 0.83 in 2017, and 1.33 in 2018.  The average catch/lift for the five surveys from 1992-2009 was 0.86.  Sixteen Black Crappies were sampled in 2018 and their lengths ranged from 4.06 to 10.79 inches with an average of 5.47 inches.  Six White Crappie were sampled in 2018, two of which were over 11 inches long (11.18 and 11.89 inches).  Gill netting is not a good indicator of the crappie population present in the St. Croix River.  Creel survey data from the winter of 2012/2013 indicated Black Crappie as the primary target species for almost 59% of the anglers interviewed.  Black Crappie comprised 73.4% of all estimated fish harvested that winter.  White Crappie came in a distant second at an estimated 11.5% of all fish harvested.  The importance of crappie to the winter fishery on Lake St. Croix may warrant further sampling, such as spring trap netting, to evaluate a population of such importance to the winter creel. <br> \n <br> \n2018 had the lowest catch rate (0.75/lift) of Yellow Perch since fall gill netting began in 2014 and was also lower than all surveys dating back to 1992.  The catch/lift was 1.69 in 2014, 1.97 in 2015, 2 in 2016, and 1.5 in 2017.  Most of the Yellow Perch sampled in those four surveys are less than 9 inches long with occasional specimens reaching 10 inches.  Average length of the nine Yellow Perch sampled in 2018 was 7.73 inches with the largest sampled measuring 9.49 inches long. <br> \n <br> \nThe 2018 White Bass catch (1.08/lift) was the lowest catch rate since 2014 (0.69/lift).  Most of the White Bass sampled since 2014 have been aged using otoliths.  All 13 of the White Bass sampled in this survey were aged using otoliths.  Although only 13 White Bass were sampled in this survey, it still shows evidence of a strong 2015 year class progressing through the system.  In 2016, almost 60% of the White Bass were 1 year old.  In 2017, over 61% of the White Bass were aged as 2 years old.  In 2018, almost 31% of the White Bass were 3 years old and was the most abundant age sampled.  The largest White Bass sampled was 16.42 inches long and aged as 7 years old.  The oldest White Bass, aged as 9 years old, was 15.12 inches long.  All 13 of the White Bass sampled were at least 1 year old and all had reached the generally accepted 9 inch minimum harvestable length desired by anglers.  Five of the White Bass sampled exceeded 15 inches in length. <br> \n <br> \nThirty Channel Catfish (2.5/lift) were sampled in 2018.  This catch rate is well below the average (3.3/lift) of the five surveys from 1992-2009, but was tied for the highest catch rate from the four previous surveys from 2014-2017.  Spines were not obtained from Channel Catfish for aging.  Half of the Channel Catfish sampled were at least 16 inches long, the minimum harvestable length generally accepted by anglers.  However, past creel surveys have shown that anglers frequently harvest Channel Catfish less than 16 inches.  Over 13% of the Channel Catfish sampled were at least 24 inches long.  The largest Channel Catfish sampled in this survey was 26.5 inches long. <br> \n <br> \nFour Lake Sturgeon were sampled in this survey (0.33/lift) and was above the average of 0.2/lift for 1992-2009 surveys as well as above the average of 0.22/lift for 2014-2017 surveys.  At least one Lake Sturgeon has been sampled in every gill net survey since 1973.  A separate Lake Sturgeon tagging project was initiated in the St. Croix River in 2003.  Through 2017, 714 Lake Sturgeon had been tagged with external Carlin Disc Dangler tags.  This tagging project has resulted in 43 recapture events by MNDNR personnel and 405 reported angler/commercial fisherman recapture events.  Tagging was suspended after the 2017 field season to re-evaluate project goals but tagged Lake Sturgeon continue to be caught and reported by anglers.  Additionally, an acoustic telemetry project was initiated in 2013 and through 2016, 20 Lake Sturgeon had been implanted with acoustic transmitters with an expected battery life of 10 years.  Telemetry data continues to be collected by a network of passive acoustic receivers. <br> \n <br> \nFish are tested for contaminants about every five years.  On occasion, fish are tested more frequently outside of the five year collection schedule.  The Minnesota Department of Health published updated consumption guidelines in April, 2018.  The St. Croix River is split into two categories based on the area of fish collection as collected above or below Stillwater, MN.  Generally speaking, the contaminants in fish flesh have decreased in the last 30 years, with most fish species being listed as \"one meal per week\" for the general population as well as women who are, or may become pregnant and children under age 15.  The most recent guidelines increased the number of \"one meal per month\" species for women who are, or may become pregnant and children under age 15 in the portion of the St. Croix River downstream of Stillwater.  Those species are buffalo 22 inches and longer, Common Carp, Channel Catfish, Freshwater Drum, Northern Pike 27 inches and longer, Walleye 19 inches and longer, and White Bass.  For the general population, buffalo 22 inches and longer and Common Carp are the only species listed as \"one meal per month.\"  No fish species are categorized as \"do not eat\" for the St. Croix River.  For a detailed and up to date list of meal advice by species in the St. Croix River, visit the Minnesota Department of Health website https://www.health.state.mn.us/communities/environment/fish/#waterbody. <br> \n <br> \nLike 2016 and 2017, the 2018 survey of the revised net locations and reduced effort was disappointing.  The goal was to maximize the catch of both Sauger and Walleye with minimal effort.  However, the low Walleye catch, similar to the standard surveys from 1992-2009, precludes much analysis because of the low sample size.  After the 2018 survey was completed, plans were being made to continue the survey for another week, but mechanical issues with the boat trailer and the remaining fall field work prohibited another week of sampling.  Catches in the 2014 and 2015 surveys were promising, and if the net locations used in those years had caught similar numbers of Walleye, data analysis would be more meaningful. <br> \n <br> \nAlthough it is recommended to continue annual gill net assessments in Lake St. Croix, the number of gill nets may need to be increased if the low catch rates cannot be improved upon.  It may also be advisable to attempt a survey later in the fall to see if catch rates increase with cooler water temperatures.  The 2019 survey should duplicate the 2016-2018 surveys.  However, an additional survey of the same net locations in mid-October to mid-November could provide some insight as to whether later surveys could increase the catch rates.  If Walleye and Sauger catch continue to be low, at the very least, the second survey would add to the sample to better reflect Walleye and Sauger length frequency, age and growth, and add power to the total mortality estimates. <br> \n <br> \nData collected from an ongoing acoustic telemetry project may help gill netting efforts.  Twenty Walleyes were implanted with acoustic transmitters in 2015, of which 10 had temperature and depth sensors.  One transmitter was recovered on shore in 2017 and was not implanted in a new fish.  The 19 remaining transmitters at large were all expected to cease transmissions on 10/30/18.  This data could provide key insights to Walleye locations and depths throughout the year.  However, early telemetry analysis shows a 26-36% reduction of Walleyes at large per year.  This could be due to mortality or fish residing in areas out of range of the passive acoustic receivers.  Detailed analysis may inform future sampling to increase catch and efficiency.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Although overall net catches were down, many species sampled in the nets were within their historical ranges since standard netting practices were adopted in 1992.  Of the 522 total fish sampled, 282 (54%) were considered to be game species.  The five most abundant game fish species sampled by number were yellow perch, white bass, bluegill, black crappie, and channel catfish.  Nongame species sampled were comprised mostly of the sucker family (62.9%), most of which were redhorse species.  Two species, silver redhorse and freshwater drum, were responsible for 62% of the nongame species sampled and 28.5% of all species sampled. <br> \nWalleye sampled ranged in size from 9.84 to 27.56-in long.  Based on back calculated length-at-age, the average walleye reaches the minimum harvestable size of 15-in by age 3, which generally agrees with past data.  The largest walleye was aged using otoliths and was aged as 15-years-old.  Sauger gill net catch per lift was 1.13, the lowest in recent sampling history.  Lengths ranged from 8.58 to 18.35-in long.  The oldest and largest sauger was aged as 5-years-old using otoliths. <br> \nOnly 13 smallmouth bass were sampled in the nets.  The 0.75 smallmouth bass per gill net lift was the highest value since standardized netting began in 1992.  However, electrofishing is the preferred method for assessing smallmouth bass populations.  The largest smallmouth bass sampled was 14.25-in long and weighed 1.36 lbs.  Based on the limited smallmouth bass data collected, legal harvestable size (14-inches) is not attained until after the fish reaches 4 years of age.  This generally agrees with past data. <br> \nWhite bass gill net catch per lift was 2.75 and within the recent historical range.  Lengths ranged from 7.09 to 15.83-in and the largest white bass weighed 1.85 lbs.  The oldest white bass, as determined by otoliths, were 6-years-old.  Mean length-at-capture was 12-in for 2-year-old fish.  White bass likely reach harvestable size, generally nine inches, before they reach their second winter. <br> \nChannel catfish number per gill net set was 1.75, the lowest it has been since the standard survey methods were adopted in 1992.  The highest number of channel catfish per gill net lift occurred in 1997 when it was 4.19.  A slow steady decline in catch per lift has been observed since then in 2002 and 2006.  Channel catfish length-at-age is highly variable and was no different in this survey.  Lengths overlapped considerably for channel catfish aged as 6-8 years old and those lengths ranged from 16.55 to 21.16-in long.  The 16-year-old channel catfish was only 21.47-in long.  The largest channel catfish sampled (26.69-in) was 9-years-old.  Additionally, four flathead catfish were sampled and the largest was 23.07-in long and weighed 4.73 lbs.  Spines were removed from all four flathead catfish and ages determined to be 5, 6, 8, and 9 years old. <br> \nForty bluegill were sampled, all in trap nets, which resulted in 1.74 bluegill per trap net lift.  This is within the range of recent surveys.  The largest bluegill sampled was 7.83-in long and weighed 0.38 lb.  Eighteen (45%) of the bluegill sampled were at least seven inches long.  Back-calculated mean length-at-age was comparable to recent surveys, if not a little faster after age 2.  A quality and fast growing 2006 year class greatly influenced these numbers. <br> \nForty-four yellow perch were sampled in gill nets (2.75/lift) and was the highest perch catch rate of recent fishery surveys in Lake St. Croix.  Most (86.3%) of the yellow perch sampled were below the minimum generally accepted angler harvest size of eight inches.  The largest yellow perch sampled was 11.26-in long, weighed 0.66 lb, and was caught in a trap net. <br> \nSmall numbers of both black crappie and white crappie were sampled in this survey.  Thirty total black crappie were sampled, 25 from trap nets.  Six white crappie were collected, all from gill nets.  This low catch of crappie is not unexpected as it is comparable to recent historical data.  The largest crappie sampled was a black crappie and was 9.84-in long, and three black crappie sampled weighed a half pound or more. <br> \nLow numbers of northern pike and lake sturgeon were also sampled and the catch rates were comparable to recent surveys.  Although muskellunge are stocked in both the St. Croix River and Lake St. Croix, none were sampled. <br> \n</p>",

An experimental survey design was developed to target Walleye and Sauger to learn more about their respective populations in Lake St. Croix.  The Lake was divided into four segments with increased gill net sets in each segment.  The segments were defined as follows:  Segment 1, the Stillwater Lift Bridge to the Railroad Bridge near Hudson, WI; Segment 2, the Hudson Railroad Bridge to Catfish Bar; Segment 3, Catfish Bar to the Kinnickinnic River Narrows; Segment 4, the Kinnickinnic River Narrows to the mouth of the St. Croix River near Prescott, WI.  Twenty gill nets were to be set in each segment, and two segments were to be netted in September each year, with all four segments being completed in two years.  At the end of the two year sampling period, net catches were to be evaluated to determine if certain locations could yield a higher catch of Walleye and Sauger to develop new standard nets sites with higher catch rates of targeted species that would require less effort to duplicate in future sampling years.  Another experiment was conducted by suspending a small number of gill nets to determine if Walleye and Sauger may be sampled higher in the water column, presumably while chasing bait fish such as Gizzard Shad. <br> \n <br> \nSegment 2 and Segment 4 were chosen for the first year of sampling, which began on September 22, 2014.  Prior to setting nets, temperature and dissolved oxygen profiles were taken for each segment to ensure that nets were not set in areas of low dissolved oxygen, which would reduce the catch of Walleye and Sauger.  Fall turnover had already occurred as dissolved oxygen was above 6 parts per million as deep as 50-feet and the temperature difference between the surface and 50-feet was less than two degrees Fahrenheit for both segments. <br> \n <br> \nTwenty gill nets were set in Segment 2 and 15 were set in Segment 4.  Five fewer nets were set in Segment 4 as a large number of fish were being sampled and the remaining locations to set nets were high traffic boat areas.  It was determined the 15 nets set in Segment 4 were sufficient.  A total of 793 fish were sampled represented by 23 different species and one hybrid (Sauger/Walleye hybrid).  Over 54% of the fish sampled were considered game fish species.  The top five game fish species sampled were Sauger (155), Walleye (64), Channel Catfish (64), Yellow Perch (59), and White Bass (24).  Of the 362 non-game fish species sampled, over 56% were Freshwater Drum.  Although Freshwater Drum are considered a non-game species, they are frequently harvested from the St. Croix River and are commonly the most harvested non-game fish.  In fact, the most recent creel survey conducted on Lake St. Croix in 2013 estimated Freshwater Drum harvest almost tripled the Channel Catfish harvest during the open water season.  Freshwater Drum were also the most caught and released fish in the 2013 open water creel survey.  Much of the remaining non-game fish sampled in this survey were Gizzard Shad, Mooneye, Gar species, and Redhorse species. <br> \n <br> \nCatch rates for Walleye and Sauger were above the average from the previous five surveys.  Walleye catch/gill net lift (1.83) was the highest observed since 1973 and Sauger was within the range of historical surveys (4.43/lift).  The mean number of Walleye sampled/lift in the five previous surveys was 1.04.  The mean number of Sauger sampled/lift in the five previous surveys was 3.23.  The number/lift for both species was within the range of past surveys, but the increased number of Walleye and Sauger collected was much higher than past surveys because of the increased number of nets.  A total of 64 Walleye and 155 Sauger were sampled.  However, the number of fish/lift could be misleading because of the poor suspended gill net catch.  Seven gill nets were set suspended 10-15-feet from the water's surface to see if Walleye and Sauger catch increased while chasing bait fish.  Only three Walleye and four Sauger were sampled in suspended gill nets.  Omitting the suspended nets, the Walleye and Sauger/gill net lift increased to 2.18 and 5.39, respectively. <br> \n <br> \nMean weight for Walleye sampled was 1.15-pounds and was below the unweighted mean weight from the five previous surveys (1.27-pounds), but within the range from those surveys.  Just over 39% of the Walleye sampled were 15-in or larger, and just over 6% were 20-in or larger.  The largest Walleye sampled was 26.85-in long and weighed 7.61-lbs.  Sauger mean weight (0.72) was slightly above the unweighted mean of the five previous surveys (0.66-lbs) and also within the range of those surveys.  Over 74% of the Sauger sampled were 12-in or larger, and just over 19% were 15-in or larger.  The largest Sauger sampled was 20.28-in long and weighed 2.19-lbs. <br> \n <br> \nAll 64 Walleye were aged using otoliths.  Ages ranged from 0 (young-of-the-year) to 10-years-old.  On average, Walleye reach the 15-in minimum length limit for harvest at 3-years-old.  Some 2-year-old individuals reach the 15-in minimum length limit in the fall.  The largest Walleye sampled (26.9-in) was aged as 9-years-old.  The oldest walleye sampled (10-years-old) was only 23.3-in long.  Over 84% of the Walleye sampled were 3-years-old or younger. <br> \n <br> \nThree of the 155 Sauger sampled were unable to be aged accurately.  Ages for the 152 Sauger ranged from 1 to 6-years-old with 2 and 3-year-olds being the most common age classes sampled (65 2-years-old, 41 3-years-old).  Mean length-at-age-2 was 12.3-in, which is generally considered the minimum harvestable size desired by anglers.  Three Sauger were aged at 6-years-old and their lengths ranged from 15.2 to 20.3-in. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie catch/lift was 0.66.  The mean catch/lift for the last five surveys since 1992 is 0.86.  Twenty of the 23 Black Crappie sampled had otoliths removed for aging.  Ages 1 through 6 were represented in this survey and 60% of those aged were 4-years-old.  Mean length-at-age-2 was 9.9-in and the largest Black Crappie sampled (12.4-in) was aged as 5-years-old.  The oldest Black Crappie was 6-years-old and measured 11.9-in.  There was little difference in mean length-at-age for ages 2 through 4 (2-years-old, 9.9-in; 3-years-old, 10.3-in; 4-years-old, 10.6-in). <br> \n <br> \nThe Yellow Perch population appeared to be expanding when the catch/lift increased from 1.44/lift in 2006 to 2.75/lift in 2009.  This survey captured 59 Yellow Perch resulting in 1.69/lift.  This is slightly above the mean catch/lift from 1992-2009.  After reviewing older survey data, prior to the new gill netting standard set forth in 1992, the Yellow Perch population appears to be stable.  The highest Yellow Perch catch/lift was 3.56 and occurred in 1988.  Fifty-three out of the 59 Yellow Perch sampled were aged using otoliths.  Ages ranged from 1 to 5-years-old.  The oldest Yellow Perch sampled (5-years-old) was 10.1-in long.  There was little difference in mean length-at-age for ages 2 through 4 (2-years-old, 8.2-in; 3-years-old, 8.2-in; 4-years-old, 8.5-in). <br> \n <br> \nThis survey had the lowest White Bass catch of any survey conducted since 1967.  Only 24 White Bass were sampled in this survey (0.69/lift).  The mean catch/lift since 1992 is 3.03.  It is not known if the later survey date is responsible for such a low White Bass catch rate.  All 24 White Bass were aged using otoliths and represented all ages from 1 through 9, except age 7.  The oldest and largest White Bass (16-in) was 9-years-old.  White Bass reach the generally accepted 9-in minimum harvestable length by age-1.  Mean length-at-age for age-1 White Bass was 9.6-in and ranged from 8.6 to 10.9-in. <br> \n <br> \nSixty-four Channel Catfish were sampled resulting in 1.83/lift.  This catch rate is below the mean from the last five surveys since 1992 (3.30/lift), but is within the range expected, especially when compared to historical data back to 1967.  Spines were not obtained from Channel Catfish for aging.  However, eight of the 64 Channel Catfish sampled were tagged with Carlin Disc Dangler tags as a continuation of a catfish tagging project that started in 2009.  The mean length of tagged Channel Catfish was 19.5-in with a minimum length of 14.6-in and maximum length of 31.3-in. <br> \n <br> \nThree Lake Sturgeon were sampled in this survey and ranged in length from 23.4 to 25.9-inches long.  All three were tagged with Carlin Disc Dangler tags and Passive Integrated Transponder (PIT) tags as a continuation of a Lake Sturgeon tagging project initiated in 2003. <br> \n <br> \nThis gill netting evaluation is to continue with Segments 1 and 3 scheduled to be sampled in September, 2015.  After the last two Segments are completed, data will be re-evaluated to determine future sampling methods and survey frequency.  It is recommended to discontinue the suspended gill net sets as overall fish catch was low and very few Walleye and Sauger were sampled in those nets.  Aging common game fish using otoliths will continue as that is the best methodology available to obtain accurate fish ages. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Two gill net surveys were conducted on Lake St. Croix in 2022.  The standard survey schedule in mid-September was followed with a second survey utilizing the same net locations the last week of October.  These two surveys combined sampled 984 fish represented by 27 different species.  Over 64% of the fish sampled were considered game fish species (those species which have defined creel limits).  The top five game fish species sampled were White Bass (218), Yellow Perch (113), Walleye (89), Channel Catfish (88), and Smallmouth Bass (50).  Of the 350 non-game fish sampled, 22.3% were Shorthead Redhorse, 18.3% were Gizzard Shad, 16.3% were Silver Redhorse, and Freshwater Drum were 15.7%. <br> \n <br> \nThe 2022 Walleye catch rate of 3.71/lift was down 1% from the 2021 survey but was still above the 2016-2021 average in the new net locations and was the third highest catch/lift in the last 30 years.  Sauger catch rates have been highly variable the last 30 years but were relatively stable from 2016-2020 with an average catch rate of 3.36/lift.  The 2021 Sauger catch of 4.25/lift was well above the average from the 2016-2020 surveys utilizing the new net locations but the 2022 catch of 2.04 Saugers/lift was well below the 2016-2021 average of 3.53/lift, down 52% from 2021. <br> \n <br> \nAverage length for all measured Walleyes was 15.45 inches, slightly below the 2016-2021 average of 15.58 inches.  Over 47% of Walleyes sampled were over 15 inches and almost 17% exceeded 18 inches, both down from the 2021 survey.  The largest Walleye sampled in 2022 was 24.92 inches and 5.51 pounds.  Average weight (0.91 pounds) for Saugers was almost identical to the average (0.90 pounds) from the 2016-2021 surveys.  Average length for all Saugers sampled was 13.86 inches, slightly below the average of 14.03 from 2016-2021.  Almost 76% of the Saugers sampled were 12 inches or larger, and almost 27% were 15 inches or larger, both decreases from 2021.  The largest Sauger sampled was 20.43 inches and 3.09 pounds and was the longest sampled in over 30 years. <br> \n <br> \nOnly four Black Crappies were sampled in 2022, of which three were collected in the October survey.  Only one White Crappie was sampled in 2022 and was 10.12 inches long.  Gill netting is not a good indicator of the crappie population present in the St. Croix River.  The importance of crappie to the winter fishery on Lake St. Croix may warrant further sampling, such as spring trap netting, to evaluate a population of such importance to the winter creel. <br> \n <br> \nThe Yellow Perch population appears to be improving to a point where it can be a more important component to the sport fishery.  2022 had the second highest catch rate (4.71/lift) of Yellow Perch since fall gill netting began in 2014.  The catch/lift decreased slightly (12%) from the September 2022 survey to the October 2022 survey.  In 2021, 72.4% of the Yellow Perch sampled were less than 8 inches with an average length of 7.27 inches and the largest individual was 11.26 inches.  In 2022, 56.7% of the Yellow Perch were less than 8 inches, the average length increased to 7.88 inches and the largest individual sampled was again 11.26 inches. <br> \n <br> \nThe 2022 White Bass catch (9.08/lift) was the highest catch observed for the second year in a row since 1992 and almost triple the average catch rate from 1992-2021.  The catch/lift decreased 57% from the September 2022 survey to the October 2022 survey.  Strong year classes in 2015, 2017, 2020, and 2021 have been represented well in each successive survey.  White Bass fishing should continue to be good the next few years as the strong year classes progress to larger sizes and is well documented in the last several surveys.  Over 73% of the White Bass measured were 12 inches or larger.  The largest White Bass sampled in 2022 was a 17.72 inch, 10-year-old male, and weighed 2.65 pounds.  Interestingly, that White Bass was immature, which is odd considering that over 50% of males sampled since 2014 mature at age-1 and all older males have been mature. <br> \n <br> \nIn 2022, the Channel Catfish catch (3.67/lift) was the highest observed since 1997 and the highest observed in the new fall gill net locations.  The catch has been trending up since 2015 following a steady decline from 1992-2015.  Catch/lift increased slightly (15%) from the September 2022 survey to the October 2022 survey.  Almost 55% of the Channel Catfish sampled in this survey were at least 16 inches long.  The two largest Channel Catfish sampled in this survey were 27.2 inches and 9.92 pounds, the other 27.44 inches and 8.71 pounds. <br> \n <br> \nOnly one Lake Sturgeon was sampled in this survey (0.04/lift).  Another Lake Sturgeon escaped the gill net as it was being retrieved.  At least one Lake Sturgeon has been sampled in every gill net survey since 1973. <br> \n <br> \nSmallmouth Bass are typically caught in such few numbers in Lake St. Croix gill net surveys that they rarely deserve mention.  However, the 2021 and 2022 surveys had the highest catch rate observed since standardized surveys began in 1992.  While 2.08 Smallmouth Bass/lift is still a low number, the average catch/lift (1.11) from the fall surveys from 2014-2022 is more than double the average catch/lift (0.41) in summer surveys from 1992-2009.  Catch rates appear to increase later in the fall as the catch increased 113% from the September 2021 survey to the November 2021 survey and experienced a similar increase of 133% from the September 2022 survey to the October 2022 survey.  Thirty-four percent of the Smallmouth Bass sampled exceeded 14 inches with the largest being 20.08 inches and 4.89 pounds which is the largest since 1997. <br> \n <br> \nWhile the surveys from 2016-2018 with revised net locations and reduced effort were disappointing, the large 2018 Walleye year class made 2020 the best gill net survey ever observed for Walleye in Lake St. Croix, 2021 survey was the second best, and 2022 the third best.  A fall survey in late October/early November appears to be a suitable replacement for the September survey.  In November 2021, catch of non-target species declined 25%, while Sauger catch increased 62% and Walleye increased 50% when compared to the September 2021 survey.  Unfortunately, secondary target species like Channel Catfish and White Bass decreased 26% and 59% respectively.  In October 2022, catch of non-target species declined 35%, while Sauger catch increased 106% and Walleye increased 87% when compared to the September 2022 survey.  Unfortunately, secondary target species like White Bass decreased 57% but the Channel Catfish catch increased 15% in 2022.  Other game species that appear to have altered catch rates between the fall surveys are Yellow Perch, which declines later in the fall, and Smallmouth Bass, which increases later in the fall. <br> \n <br> \nIt is recommended to continue the annual gill net assessment in Lake St. Croix with the current number of net sets (12) and net locations but change to a late October/early November survey schedule.  Decreased by-catch and increased catch rates of primary target species would greatly increase efficiency.  September can now be used to explore developing a standardized assessment for Lake Sturgeon as well as targeted sampling to increase the number of tagged Lake Sturgeon. <br> \n <br> \nThe overall fishing forecast looks promising for the next few years depending on the species.  The strong 2018 Walleye year-class does not appear to have persisted as the number of 4-year-old Walleyes sampled was relatively low, which is typical on Lake St. Croix.  Most Walleyes over the 15-inch minimum length limit that will be available to angler harvest will be from the 2019 and 2020 year-classes with the occasional older, larger fish.  Sauger numbers are not as strong as Walleye and have been relatively low since 2015.  Most of the Saugers sampled were from the 2020 year-class and will provide some harvest opportunities.  White Bass fishing could be the best it has been in decades.  The fast-growing 2021 and 2022 White Bass year-classes should provide good numbers of harvestable White Bass and the strong 2015, 2017, and 2020 year-classes could produce numerous high-quality fish over 14 inches and even over 16 inches.  Channel Catfish numbers and size continues to improve and should provide a worthwhile target for anglers.  The Yellow Perch population may have finally grown to a point where it may provide some increased harvest opportunities.  It will be interesting to monitor the Yellow Perch over the next few years to see if the fish continue to grow to larger sizes, potentially contributing more to the recreational fishery.  The 2022 survey, like the 2021 survey, was the best sample ever for Smallmouth Bass.  A decent Smallmouth Bass fishery exists in Lake St. Croix, although the gill net surveys rarely reflect that.</p>",
