                "narrative": "<p>Tait Lake is one of about two dozen Sentinel lakes in the State's Long Term Monitoring program.  This was the fifth (and final) standard survey done since 2009 to provide a good baseline against which long-term changes in the fish community could be assessed.  Surveys will be done less frequently in future years (probably one every five years, rather than every other year). <br> \n <br> \nTait Lake is managed primarily for Walleye, with Northern Pike as the secondary management species.  The current goal for the Walleye population, from the 2011 lake management plan, is to maintain a minimum gill net catch of 5.0 fish/set, with no size goal set.  The goal for Northern Pike is a minimum gill net catch of 2.0 fish/set, with some fish over 25 inches in length present. <br> \n <br> \nFair numbers of Walleye were present in 2017, and the Walleye gill net catch fell within the normal range for a lake of this class.  However, the catch was the lowest (by a small amount) ever seen in this lake, and failed to meet the long range goal from the 2011 plan.  The mean weight for Walleye taken in gill nets was also the lowest ever seen in this lake, and was low for a lake of this type as well.  Eleven year classes, all naturally produced, contributed to the catch, with a strong 2015 year class accounting for 39% of the combined gill and trap net catch.  Walleye growth had been a little faster than average.  Fish reached a mean length of 14.8 inches at the end of their fourth year, compared to an area average of 13.4 inches. <br> \n <br> \nThe adult Walleye population in Tait Lake was assessed by electrofishing done by the Fond du Lac band and the 1854 Treaty Authority in late April 2017.  As part of that sampling, 341 Walleye 10-inches or greater in length were given green tags and released.  Recaptures of some of those fish in our July survey allowed us to estimate that a total of 1,330 (plus or minus 739) Walleye 10 inches or larger were present in Tait Lake in the spring of 2017. <br> \n <br> \nFair numbers of Northern Pike were also present in 2017, including some larger fish.  However, the Northern Pike gill net catch was low for this lake historically, and for a lake of this type.  The catch goal from the 2011 plan was missed, but the size goal was met by the capture of several fish larger than 25 inches.  Eight year classes contributed to the catch, including fish as old as eight years.  Only the 2014 year class appeared to have been fairly strong.  Northern Pike growth had been slow; fish reached a mean length of 16.7 inches at the end of their third year, compared to an area average of 18.2 inches. <br> \n <br> \nForage for Walleye and Northern Pike was provided mainly by Yellow Perch, which appeared to have been abundant in 2017.  The gill net catch, while still within the normal range for a lake of this type, was the highest seen to date in Tait Lake.  From their lengths it appeared that several year classes had contributed to the catch (no aging was done).  The mean weight for Yellow Perch taken in gill nets was lower than means seen in several recent surveys of this lake, but there were some larger fish present. <br> \n <br> \nTait Lake continued to support modest numbers of mostly small Pumpkinseed and Bluegill in 2017.  Trap net catches for both species were similar to historic values for this lake, and fell within normal ranges for the lake type.  Very few fish of either species would have been large enough to have been of much interest to anglers. <br> \n <br> \nThe White Sucker gill net catch in 2017 was the lowest seen to date in Tait Lake, continuing a decline in numbers that has been evident since 1990.  A few of the White Sucker collected in 2017 were small enough to have taken by the larger Northern Pike in the system, supplementing forage provided by Yellow Perch. <br> \n <br> \nNo new (to this lake) fish species were taken in the 2017.  An angling report of a large Smallmouth Bass being taken from Tait Lake could not be confirmed by this survey; however, initial introductions of that species have often been missed by surveys, only becoming apparent after several years. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Walleye were fairly abundant in Tait Lake in 2011, and their size was typical for a lake of this class.  The walleye gill net catch was about average for a lake of this type, but was one of the lower catches seen in this lake historically.  The walleye population was entirely self-sustained.  Nine year classes contributed to the 2011 catch, with the strongest apparently produced in 2007 and 2010.  Walleye growth had been average for this area.  In the spring of 2011, the Fond du Lac band and the 1854 Treaty Authority captured and tagged walleye by electrofishing.  A total of 484 walleye were tagged.  That allowed us to estimate, based on the recapture of tagged fish during this assessment, that the lake supported about 1,600 walleye 10-inches or more in length in early May 2011. <br> \n <br> \nThe yellow perch catch was average for the lake class, but was one of the higher catches seen in this lake historically.  Yellow perch were the primary forage base for walleye and northern pike.  Many larger yellow perch (up to 12 inches in length) were collected in 2011, which should have provided some good fishing for anglers targeting the species. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike abundance was low in 2011, both for a lake of this type, and for this lake historically, but some larger fish were present.  Several year classes contributed to the catch, which included fish up to 10 years of age.  Growth of northern pike collected in 2011 had been somewhat slower than average for this area.   <br> \n <br> \nPumpkinseed sunfish were abundant but small in 2011.  The catch in trap nets was above average for a lake of this type, and was the second highest seen to date in this lake.  Very few of the sunfish taken would have been large enough to have been of interest to anglers; most were under five inches in length.  A few small bluegill were also collected in 2011.  All were one-year-old fish, and all were under four inches in length.  Bluegill have rarely been seen in Tait Lake. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>This was the last of four surveys of Tait Lake done to provide a starting point for monitoring this lake under the MNDNR Fisheries Long Term Monitoring (LTM) program (also known as SLICE).  Tait Lake is a Tier 2 lake in that program, and as such will be sampled less frequently now that the first round of surveys has been completed.  The next survey is scheduled for 2019. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye were fairly abundant in Tait Lake in 2015, and the population was entirely self-sustained.  The walleye gill net catch met the long range goal for walleye (5.00 fish/gill net set) from the current (2011) lake management plan.  Thirteen naturally produced year classes contributed to the 2015 catch, with moderately strong year classes apparently produced in 2011 and 2012.     Walleye as old as 15 years were collected.  Walleye growth had been close to average for this area, with four-year-old fish reaching a mean length of 12.5 inches by the end of their fourth year.  The lone 15-year-old fish was 23.7 inches long when captured in this survey. <br> \n <br> \nRecapture of walleye tagged by electrofishing in the spring of 2015 yielded a spring population estimate of 2,126 walleye 10 inches in length or larger.  That estimate was similar to estimates made for Tat Lake in 2011 and 2013.  Anglers fishing Tait Lake in the next few years can expect to see many walleye sporting tags, some with multiple tags.  Red tags were used in 2011, yellow in 2013, and orange in 2015.  There's no need for anglers to report catches of tagged fish in this lake, nor is there any need to treat those fish differently than any other walleye taken. <br> \n <br> \nFair numbers of northern pike were present in 2015, although few (if any) would have been trophy-sized fish.  Although the northern pike gill net catch in 2015 fell just under the normal range for the lake class, it was similar to many past catches in this lake.  The catch goal from the 2011 management plan (a minimum of 2.0 fish/gill net set) was not met in 2015, but the size goal in that plan (some fish over 25 inches present) was met. <br> \n <br> \nPumpkinseed were abundant but small in 2015.  The catch in 0.75-in trap nets was above the normal range for this type of lake, and was the second highest seen to date in this lake (only the 2013 catch was higher).  Very few of the pumpkinseed taken would have been large enough to have been of interest to anglers.   <br> \n <br> \nFair numbers of bluegill were present in 2015, although most were small.  The bluegill population in Tait Lake appeared to continue an expansion that started only recently.  Prior to 2011 bluegill had rarely been taken, but in 2011 a single 10.1-inch fish was caught during spring trap netting, and several smaller fish were collected in trap nets during a summer survey.  More bluegill were collected in 2013, with the 0.75-in-mesh trap net catch increasing to 0.75 fish/net, the highest seen to date in this lake.  That catch was equaled in 2015.   Most of the bluegill taken were one- or two-year-old fish under six inches in length.  Few fish were old enough and large enough to have been of interest to anglers; however, if those fish survive the winter, Tait Lake may provide some bluegill fishing opportunities over the next few summers. <br> \n <br> \nThe white sucker gill net catch in 2015 was the second lowest seen in this lake historically, but remained within the normal range for a lake of this type.  White sucker were probably not a significant forage species for northern pike in Tait Lake; most of the those seen in this survey would have been too large to have been taken by any but the largest northern pike. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Tait Lake is located about twelve miles north of the Town of Lutsen and is accessible via a US Forest Service administered boat launch located on the west end of the lake. The lake has been part of the MNDNR Sentinel Lakes program since 2009, which resulted in high frequency lake surveys through 2017 to provide baseline monitoring data necessary for tracking potential changes in the fish community. The lake management plan for Tait Lake was revised in 2020 and reduced the survey frequency to five years. Walleye were retained as the primary management species for Tait Lake with a long-range goal of maintaining a population with a minimum gill net catch of 5.0 fish/set. Northern Pike remained the secondary management species, with a long-range goal of maintaining gill net catch of 2.0 fish/set and the presence of some fish over 25 inches. This was the first of two surveys scheduled in the 2020 LMP to determine if long-range goals identified for the Walleye and Northern Pike populations were being met and to monitor for potential changes in the fish community. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye were first introduced into Tait Lake in 1939 and were stocked a few additional times between 1948 and 1967. Walleye gill net catches in Tait Lake since 1970 have ranged from 17.7 to 4.1 fish/set, with catches on the lower end of that range occurring in the last three surveys of the lake. Walleye appeared moderately abundant in 2022 and the gill net catch surpassed the goal set for the population. The gill net sample included fish from 6.9 to 27.4 inches, although the mean length of Walleye captured in that gear was only 12.7 inches. The 2022 Walleye catch in 0.75-inch-mesh trap nets was above average compared to similar lakes in this area but was typical for results from Tait Lake. Walleye sampled in trap nets tended to be larger with a mean length of 15.6 inches. The total Walleye sample included fish from 12 naturally produced year classes (age-1 through age-13). Walleye natural recruitment appeared very consistent, with no missing year classes between ages one and eight, and moderately strong representation from the 2018-2021 year classes. Walleye growth was slightly faster than average. Walleye sampled in 2022 averaged 14.2 inches at the end of their fourth year, compared to an area mean of 13.3 inches at that age. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike gill net catches in Tait Lake have varied considerably over the years but have generally been low compared to similar lakes in the area. The 2022 Northern Pike gill net catch fell within the typical range observed for the lake and met the catch goal identified for the population. The size goal was also met based on the capture of a couple fish larger than 25 inches in gill nets and trap nets; however, most of the Northern Pike sampled in 2022 were less than 22 inches. Six year classes contributed to the catch, including fish as old as age-7, although most of the fish sampled in 2022 were age-3. Growth rates of those fish had been about average; fish reached a mean length of 18.4 inches at the end of their third year, compared to an area mean of 18.1 inches populations in similar lakes. <br> \n <br> \nForage for Walleye and Northern Pike was provided mainly by Yellow Perch, which were present at average abundances in the 2022 gill net catch. The gill net and standard trap net samples included age-1 through age-3 Yellow Perch, although over 78% were age-2 fish that averaged 6.4 inches at capture. Historically, Yellow Perch samples from Tait Lake have included fair numbers of larger fish (> 9.0 inches) that are preferred by anglers, but fish of that caliber were not observed in 2022. Young-of-year (YOY) Yellow Perch were very abundant in 0.25-inch-mesh trap nets (1,782 YOY/set), indicating good reproductive success occurred in 2022.  <br> \n <br> \nTait Lake continued to support modest numbers of mostly small Pumpkinseed and Bluegill in 2022. Gill net and standard trap net catches for both species were comparable to historic values for this lake. The Bluegill sample included age-1 through age-3 fish, with age-2 fish reaching an average of 4.5 inches when sampled. Very few fish of either species would have been large enough to have been of much interest to anglers.  <br> \n <br> \nThe White Sucker gill net catch in 2022 was similar to catch rates observed in Tait Lake since 2000. A few of the White Sucker sample from 2022 were small enough to serve as forage for larger Walleye and Northern Pike. Additional species sampled in 0.25-inch-mesh trap nets deployed in 2022 included Blacknose Shiner and Golden Shiner, which also may have contributed to the available forage base for predator species. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Walleye were abundant in Tait Lake in 2009, and their size was typical for a lake of this class.  The walleye gill net catch was above average for a lake of this type, but was similar to past catches in this lake.  The walleye population was entirely self-sustained.  Eleven year classes contributed to the 2009 catch, with the strongest apparently produced in 2007 and 2005.  Walleye growth had been a little slower than average for this area. <br> \n <br> \nSlow walleye growth could not be expained by a lack of yellow perch.  The yellow perch catch was average for the lake class, but was one of the higher catches seen in this lake historically.  Yellow perch were the primary forage base for walleye and northern pike.  Yellow perch collected in 2009 were exceptionally large, with many fish over 10 inches in length. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike abundance and average size were low in 2009, both for a lake of this type, and for this lake historically.  The northern pike gill net catch was one of the lowest ever observed in this lake.  No northern pike over 21 inches in length or older than age 2 were taken in any gear.  Growth of two-year-old northern pike had been fast.   <br> \n <br> \nPumpkinseed sunfish were abundant but small in 2009.  The catch in trap nets was above average for a lake of this type, and was the highest seen to date in this lake.  Very few of the sunfish taken would have been large enough to have been of interest to anglers; most were under five inches in length. <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

Walleye collected ranged from five to 21 inches, with most between 12 and 18 inches.  Walleye growth rates were about average for the area, and growth of yellow perch and northern pike was also good.  White sucker were not unusually abundant.  A few pumpkinseed sunfish were found, but they were generally too small to be of much interest to anglers.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>The walleye catch in gill nets in the 2000 assessment was within the normal range for this lake class, and it was similar to catches observed in the past on this lake.  The walleye population was entirely self-sustained, with several strong year classes produced since 1994.  Most of the walleye collected were less 18 inches in length.  Walleye growth rates were about average for the area; five-year-old walleye collected in July averaged 16.3 inches in length.The northern pike catch was also normal for the lake class, and similar to past catches.  Over half the catch consisted of two-year-old fish, but northern pike as old as six years, and as large as 35 inches, were collected.  Northern pike growth rates were fairly fast, at least for younger fish.Good walleye and northern pike growth rates were due to the presence of average-sized populations of yellow perch and white sucker to provide forage.  In addition to providing forage, some of the yellow perch collected would have been large enough to have been of interest to anglers.Tait Lake supported small populations of panfish, but the fish were small and probably of little interest to anglers.  Bluegill were found in this lake for the first time in 2000; pumpkinseed sunfish have been present since at least 1990.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Walleye were fairly abundant in Tait Lake in 2013, although, as usual, most were under 20 inches in length.  The 2013 walleye gill net catch was similar to the catch observed in 2011, and fell  within the normal range for a lake of this class; however, the catch failed to meet the long range goal for walleye (5.00 fish/gill net set) from the current (2011) lake management plan, and was one of the lower catches seen in this lake historically.  The walleye population was entirely self-sustained.  Nine year classes contributed to the 2013 catch, and it appeared that a fairly strong year class had been produced in 2011.  The 2005 year class, which was strongly represented in 2009 and 2011 catches, remained a significant contributor to the 2013 walleye population.  Walleye growth had been close to normal for this area.  Four-year-old fish reached an average length of 13.4 inches by the end of their fourth year, compared to an area average of 13.8 inches. <br> \n <br> \nRecapture of walleye tagged in the spring of 2013 (yellow tags) yielded a spring population estimate of 1,981 walleye 10 inches in length or larger.  That was similar to an estimate made for Tait Lake in 2011.  <br> \n <br> \nThe northern pike gill net catch appeared to increase in 2013, compared to lower catches observed in 2009 and 2011.  Nevertheless, the 2013 gill net catch was just within the normal range for the lake class.  Catch and size goals from the 2011 management plan were met by the 2013 gill net catch:  the gill net catch exceeded 2.0 fish/net, and some fish over 25 inches in length were taken.  The mean weight for northern pike taken in gill nets was relatively high in 2013, compared to most past means in this lake.  Five natural year classes contributed to the total catch in the 2013 summer assessment, with none standing out as having been exceptionally strong.  Growth of older northern pike had been somewhat faster than average; four-year-old fish reached a mean length of 22.1 inches by the end of their fourth year, compared to the area average of 20.0 inches. Recapture of northern pike marked in the spring of 2013 yielded a spring population estimate of 338 fish 11.5 inches in length or larger. <br> \n <br> \nForage for walleye and northern pike may have been somewhat limited by lower-than-usual yellow perch numbers.  The yellow perch gill net catch fell short of the normal range for the lake class, and was one of the lower catches seen in this lake historically.  Although a few larger fish were present to provide some angling opportunities, most of the yellow perch taken were small two-year-old fish from a modest 2011 year class. <br> \n <br> \nPumpkinseed were abundant but small in 2013.  The trap net catch exceeded the normal range, and was the highest seen to date in this lake.  Very few of the pumpkinseed taken would have been large enough to have been of interest to anglers.  All of the fish taken in trap nets appeared to have been two- or three-year-old fish.  Growth had been about average for a lake in this area; fish reached an average length of 4.3 inches by the end of their third year. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill have rarely been taken in Tait Lake, but in 2011 a single 10.1-inch fish was taken during ice-out trap netting, and several smaller fish were collected in 0.75-in and 0.25-in-mesh trap nets during a summer assessment done that year.  More bluegill were collected in 2013, with the 0.75-in-mesh trap net catch increasing to 0.75 fish/net, the highest seen to date in this lake.  Most of the bluegill taken were two- or three-year-old fish under six inches in length, but a few fish old enough and large enough to have been of interest to anglers were present. <br> \n</p>",
