                "narrative": "<p>Additional Field Notes:  Supplemental sampling: A Pro-Am bass tournament was monitored on 9/15/91.  Selected data from the report by Terry Ebinger is included in this report.  Many gull, terns, and loons and great blue herons observed during netting.  Also osprey and bald eagles noted.Present Fish Population Status:  A statistically significant decrease in the northern pike catch was seen.  The catch (2.29/gill net) declined 29% since 1986 and became low for this lake class.  Catches in the previous three nettings ranged from 3.2-3.5 /gillnet, barely exceeding the lower quartile value of 3.0/gill net.  Growth remained good and similar to 1986.  Average size (3.8 lbs) remained large (3.7 lb in 1986).  Lengths ranged from 16-35 inches (median = 22\") compared to 17-34 inches (median = 23') in 1986. The walleye catch also showed a statistically significant drop from 8.21 to 5.71/gill net since 1986 (30%) but abundance remained average for the lake class.  Average size decreased from 2.1 lb (large) in 1986 to 1.9 lb (average).  Lengths ranged from 7-29\" (median = 16\")  in 1991 compared to 7-28\" (median 17\") in 1986.  Annual fingerling stocking complicated data analysis.  The 1989, 1986 and 1985 year classes were most abundant in the catch.  Only two of those (1989 and 1986) correspond to years with large numbers of stocked fish.  The 1986 netting showed a similar phenomenon.  Growth remained good for all ages sampled.   Largemouth bass numbers increased fivefold (2.57 /trap net) since 1986 (.54/trap net)  but 76% were age I+ fish and were slow growing.  A September bass tournament provided a good sample of bass ages III-X.  The 1986 year class was most abundant in the sample and contributed 26, 39 and 33% to the tournamnet catches in 1989-1991.  Growth was good for tournament caught bass.Bluegill numbers continued to climb from 69.0/trap net in 1986 to 91.34/trap net in 1991.  Median length remained at 5.5 inches and fish from 3.5-8.0 inches were sampled  (3.0-8.5\") in 1986.  The proportion of fish at least 7.0\" long (10.8%) was similar to 1986  (8.2%) when a combined gillnet-trapnet length frequency is used (as it was in 1986).  Average  size, however, dropped from .22 lb (average) in 1986 to .11 lb (small) in 1991.Yellow perch abundance (41.92/gill net) dropped a statistically significant 56% compared to 1986 (95.35/gill net).  The 1991 catch was still about 1.5 times greater than the upper quartile value for the lake class.  In 1986, median length was 6.5\"   (range = 4.5-10.0\").  It was 6.0\" (range 5.0-9.5\") in 1991.  Average size decreased 0.02 lb to 0.11 lb (small).  Cisco abundance more than  doubled (11.43/gill net) since 1986 (5.14/ gill net) and exceeded the upper quartile value.  Fish six and twelve inches long dominated the length frequency distribution.  Average size rose from 0.25 lb (small) to 0.50 (average) as well.</p>",

Three different gears were used:  1/4\" trap nets, boom shocker electrofishing, and new experimental small mesh gill nets.  While all methods produced perch, the experimental gill nets and electrofishing seemed to produce the best results.  <br> \n <br> \nThe gill nets caught 5,978 perch (398.5/net), ranging in size from 2.1\" to 7.5\".  The trap nets only caught 71 perch (4.7/net), with fish being a similar size at 2.1\" to 8.5\".  Young-of-the-year largemouth bass was the most abundant species in the trap nets at 90.5/net.  Electrofishing was done for 20 minutes, resulting in a catch of 131 perch or 393.0/hr.  These fish ranged from 1.9\" to 8.0\".   <br> \n</p>",

Two ? inch single frame trap nets were set in Gull Lake blocking off the downstream end of the Hole-in-the-Day outlet culvert.  Nets were fished from 4/13/2023 to 4/29/2023. All Northern Pike captured were marked with a left pectoral fin clip.    <br> \n <br> \nA total of 2,175 Northern Pike were captured, an average of 136 new fish per day. Lengths ranged from 8.9\" to 42.3\" with a mean length of 23.2\". Northern Pike at least 24\" in length made up 38% of the catch, with fish 30\" and over making up 4% of the catch. Northern Pike were captured during a summer gillnet survey and examined for fin clips.   Of the 40 fish captured during this survey, 3 were marked.  The population estimate for Northern Pike 400mm and greater was 25,787 fish (11,649-39,925, 80% CI). <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Gull is a 9,418 acre lake located about six miles north of Brainerd.  It is the largest and most downstream lake in the Gull chain of lakes.  Public accesses are present on the east, north and west sides.  Development is extensive with over 1,000 homes/cabins and 19 resorts with over 800 rental units present along the 8.1 miles of shoreline.  The lake has a maximum depth of 80 feet and about 30% of the lake is shallower than 15 feet.  It is a hardwater lake with low to moderate phosphorus fertility and water clarity which is about average for the area.  Shallow water soils are primarily sand and gravel with some areas of rubble and boulder sized rock present.  Silt and detritus are present in marshy areas.  The aquatic plant community is still fairly diverse.  Beds of emergent vegetation, like bulrush, are important because they help control erosion by reducing wave action, help water quality by recyling nutrients and help provide quality spawning sites for bass and panfish species.  Submergent plants also provide food and cover for a wide variety of aquatic species.  Local support for protecting critical habitat was instrumental to the recent establisment of the Grassy Point area as an aquatic management area.  Protecting habitat is an essential ingredient in maintaining a diverse fish population and a healthy aquatic environment.Walleye, northern pike and largemouth bass were the most abundant gamefish species taken in the 1996 test netting, while bluegill was the most abundant panfish found.  All were caught in numbers which are considered \"average\" when compared to catches in similar type lakes.Walleyes have been stocked on an almost annual basis since 1961.  In order to evaluate natural reproduction and stocking success, stocking was switched to every other year after 1993.  Fall electrofishing to sample young walleyes began in 1994.  The walleye catch in the summer netting remained in the \"average\" category and was similar to catch rates from the last three nettings, dating back to 1981.  Ten year classes were sampled and growth was good.  Walleyes averaged 16 inches and 1.9 lbs in the 1991 netting and 16 inches and 2.4 lbs in 1996.Northern pike were caught in \"average\" numbers in 1996.  The catch rate has been in the range of 2.3-3.5/gillnet since 1972 and was 5.1/lift in '96.  Five age classes were sampled and growth varied from good to fast.  Average size increased from 22 inches and 3.8 lbs. in 1991 to 25 inches and 4.6 lbs. in 1996.Largemouth bass were present in \"average\" numbers in 1996.  Past catches have varied between the average and the high abundance categories.  Five age classes of bass were sampled and growth varied from slow to good.Bluegills were caught in \"average\" numbers in 1996 after being caught in \"high\" numbers in the last two nettings.  Seven age classes were sampled and growth varied from slow to good.  About 7% of bluegills from trapnets were 7.0 inches or more in length in 1996, compared to 2% in 1991.  The black crappie catch was in the \"high\" category for the third straight netting.  Three age classes were sampled and growth was good.  A majority of crappies were from one year class (1994), a situation commonly seen with crappie populations.Forage species which are important to the lake's gamefish include yellow perch, white sucker and tullibee.  Perch numbers were in the \"average\" category in 1996.  Several age classes were sampled and growth varied between slow and good.  White suckers were also caught in \"average\" numbers.  Tullibees were caught in \"high\" numbers for the second straight netting.Other species sampled in the 1996 netting included bowfin (dogfish), burbot, common carp, rock bass, green sunfish, pumpkinseed, hybrid sunfish, common shiner and three bullhead species.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Gull Lake is a 9,418 acre lake located six miles north of Brainerd.  It is part of the Gull Lake Reservoir chain of lakes.  The lake has a maximum depth of 80 feet and about 30% of the lake is shallower than 15 feet.  Water clarity is excellent.  It is an extremely popular lake for both angling and other water-based recreational activities.The 2001 population assessment found northern pike present in good numbers.  Size ranged from 17.5-39.8 inches and 52.3% of pike sampled were at least 24 inches in length. Pike growth was good.  The walleye catch of 6.87/gill net is typical for the lake type and similar to the catch rate from 1996.  Historically, walleye catches have ranged from 2.88-8.21/net.  Sixteen age classes were sampled in 2001.  The 1999 (age 2) year class averaged 11.6 inches long in mid-July, 2001 and contributed 33% of the catch.  Fall electrofishing indicated a strong class of young-of-the-year was present in 2001.  Walleyes as large as 29.2 inches were sampled and 27% of the catch were at least 20 inches in length.  Fish aged 8 and older also conprised 33% of the walleye catch.  Fry stocked the past three years, along with natural reproduction has created an excellent outlook for walleye fishing in the future.  Fry stocking began in 1999 and has produced two strong year classes in the three years of stocking to date.Largemouth bass catches were typical for both the lake type and Gull Lake.  Size ranged from 5.3-17.6 inches, with numerous age classes present.  Black crappei numbers remain high and bluegill numbers moderate.  Recent catch rates are similar to 1996 results.  Yellow perch and tullibee remain abundant and catch rates were similar to those of 1996.  These two species provide an important and varied forage base for northern pike and walleyes and are responsible for their continued good growth rates.  If anglers use some restraint in harvest, the lake should provide excellent fishing for a variety of species for some time to come.</p>",

Walleye are currently stocked as fry every year with a provision to stock fingerlings if young-of-the-year (YOY) sampled during fall electrofishing are below 30/hr in 2 consecutive years.  Numbers were below average this survey (3.7/gill net) and down slightly from 2015 (4.7/gill net), however, fishing reports were positive, with a lot of 18-20\" walleyes harvested.  Size was good, however, with an average length of 17.1\" and 82% measuring 12\" or larger. <br> \n <br> \nThe northern pike numbers were average as well, at 4.7/gill net.  Size was good with an average length of 24.2\" and 51% measured 24\" or larger.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch are an important forage fish for this lake.  The 2016 catch was average for this type of lake (15.1/gill net), having rebounded to levels near the 2007-2010 surveys.  Average length was 6.4\". <br> \n <br> \nCrappies are not targeted in this type of survey which focuses on yellow perch, northern pike, and walleye.  However, Gull is known for quality sized crappies.  <br> \n <br> \nFollowing a robust public input process, muskellunge management in the Gull Chain was initiated in the fall of 2016 with the stocking of 2,000 fingerlings into Gull Lake.  A viable fishery can be expected to develop in roughly 8-10 years.   <br> \n</p>",

Average size was 16.6\", with 70% of the fish measuring at least 12.0\" in length. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike numbers (3.2/gill net) were also average.  Size was nice with an average length of 25.5\" and 40% of the fish above the 22-26\" protected slot.   <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch and Tullibee (Cisco) are important prey for predator species such as Walleye and Northern Pike.  Yellow Perch were sampled in average numbers at 12.1/gill net.  Average length was 6.5\", with 8% at least 8.0\" in length.  Tullibee (Cisco) were also sampled in average numbers at 2.0/gill net.   Average length was 13.6\". <br> \n <br> \nZebra mussels are present in Gull Lake.   Lake users are required to inspect and remove any aquatic plants and animals from their watercraft and trailers as well as pull the plug and drain all water from the watercraft, including bilges, livewells and baitwells. <br> \n</p>",

Night electrofishing to monitor the abundance of young-of-the-year (YOY), walleyes was done on September 17th and 18th, 2014.  The total sample time was 2 hours and 37 minutes, resulting in a YOY catch rate of 3.1/hr run-time.  Past YOY catch rates from fry stockings have ranged from 11.3 to 271.9 fish/hr.  YOY fish accounted for 31% of the total catch and ranged in size from 5.7\" to 7.1\", with a mean length of 6.2\".  The catch rate of walleyes age-1 and older was 6.9/hr run-time.  These fish ranged in size from 8.3\" to 26.8\" and had a mean length of 12.4\". <br> \n <br> \nElectrofishing data suggests that fry stocking has been successful in augmenting year class strength.  Strong year classes documented via electrofishing have also shown up later in gill net samples and in the angler harvest. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Yellow bullhead, pumpkinseed, bluegill, yellow perch and walleye net catches indicate above-average populations, since net catches are above the third quartile of the regional median for these species.  Northern cisco, northern pike, white sucker, brown bullhead, rock bass, and largemouth bass exhibited average populations, since net catches fell between the first and third quartile of the regional median.  Bowfin, shorthead redhorse, and green sunfish exhibited below-average populations with net catches falling below the first quartile of the regional median.  Carp trapnet catches were below the statewide median for this species.The northern cisco population is in excellent shape and has an excellent size range of 6.5 to 15.9 inches, with the median size group being the 7.0 to 7.4 inch group.  Thus, this species is providing an excellent forage base for northern pike and walleye.Northern pike net catches (1986- 3.2 gill net) have remained stable at least back to the 1972 lake survey.   Age classes present in the nets were II through VII, with 89% of the fish aged belonging to the II through IV age classes.  Age classes II and III exhibited above-average growth rates, while age classes IV through VII exhibited average growth rates when compared to the statewide average.  At annuli II northern pike average 17.6 inches and 30.8 inches at annuli VI.  The median size of northern pike in the nets was 22.9 inches and median weight 2.9 pounds.  The size range was from 17.3 to 24.8 inches.The carp net catches were low, but increased numbers have been observed by Conservation Officers and Fisheries personnel at Frampton Slough and Hole -in-the-Day Lake during the spring in recent years.Three species of bullheads (black, yellow and brown) are found in Gull Lake, with yellow bullhead being the most abundant since at least 1954.  Black and brown bullhead populations have changed very little since the 1954 netting.  Yellow bullheads have increased significantly.  The median size group of yellow bullheads to 10.0 to 10.4 inches.Bluegill net catches indicate an all-time high population, with the size comparable to the 1981 netting.  Age classes II through VII were present, with age class III predominant.  Age class III exhibited a slow growth rate while the other age classes exhibited average growth rates, when compared to statewide averages.  Annuli III fish average 3.5 inches and annuli VII fish 6.6 inches.  Size distribution was from 3.4 to 7.6 inches, with a median length of 5.7 inches, and weight of .13 pounds.Eight largemouth bass were aged, and age class II and III were equally abundant.  At annuli II they averaged 5.85 inches and at annuli III 8.48 inches.  Growth rate is considered average.Compared with past catch rates of black crappie on Gull Lake, the population is in good shape.  Age classes II and III were present, with age class III predominant and a length of 7.31 inches at annuli III.  Growth rates were average for all three age classes.  The 1986 yellow perch gillnet catch of 95.4  per net is 128% higher than any past netting, thus indicating a significantly above-average population for Gull Lake.  Age classes III through VI were present and exhibited average growth rates.  The size distribution is 4.5 to 10.4 inches with a median size of 6.2 inches and median weight of 0.14 pounds.The status of the walleye abundance is excellent, with net catches exceeding local, regional and state averages.  The catch per gill net in July of 1986 is an all-time high and is comparative in population abundance with the October, 1981 netting.  (Fall netting usually catches more walleyes per unit of effort than mid-summer nettings, thus, the 1986 population is probably higher).  The 1986 population is significantly higher than the population of the July, 1954 or 1972 nettings.  Walleyes aged showed age classes through IX present, with age classes II, IV and V dominant.  Age class II (year class 1984) was the largest (35 out of 95 fish aged), with 9.36 inches at annuli II.  Annuli IX walleyes (3 fish) were 25.13 inches.  The size range was well distributed from 7.3 to 28.3 inches, having a median size of 17.5 inches and weighing approximately 1.8 pounds.  Age class strength appears to have some correlation with the stocking rates and size of fingerlings stocked from 1980 on.  1984 had the largest stocking and also is the dominant year class.  Also, the other age class strengths have a simple, direct correlation with stocking rates. Special Problems and Concerns Affecting Fish or Fishing:  Gull Lake is a very important recreational lake in the central Minnesota area, and the number of homes and cottages has increased 49% in the last 14 years, causing an increased burden on the lake's eco-system.  Gull Lake's increase in recreational watercrafts each year result in increasing conflict with anglers.Additional Field Notes: Observed numerous loons, mallard and gulls, one adult bald eagle.  Heavy boat traffic after 10:00 am.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Gull Lake, at 9,418 acres, is one of the largest and most popular lakes in the Brainerd area.  The lake is heavily developed with 27.8 homes/cabins per shoreline mile and 19 resorts of various types and sizes as of 1996.  The maximum depth is 80' and about 30% of the lake is 15' deep or less.  Shallow water substrates consist primarily of sand and gravel, although areas of rubble and boulder are also common.  The aquatic plant community is quite diverse with 35 species present and is critical to maintaining healthy fish populations.  Emergent plants such as bulrush are important for shoreline protection, maintaining water quality, and provide essential spawning habitat for bass and panfish species.  Submerged plants provide food and cover needed by fish and other aquatic species.  \n\nThe 2007 walleye catch of 8.5/gill net is the highest to date on Gull lake.  Average length and weight were 14.6\" and 1.3 lbs.  Twelve different year classes were represented with age 2 and age 4 (2005 and 2003 year classes, respectively) accounting for 59% of the gill net catch.   These 2 year classes have accounted for much of the angler harvest in 2006 and 2007.  \n\nNorthern pike abundance was typical of past catches at 4.1/gill net in 2007.  Average length and weight were also similar at 25.8\" and 4.0 lbs.  The 2004 and 2003 year classes (age 3 and 4) were the strongest, accounting for 57% of all northern pike sampled.  These fish measured approximately 19\" to 27\".\n\nTullibee and yellow perch are important forage species for the lake's game fish.  The yellow perch catch was lower than past catches on Gull lake, but at 18.3/gill net was still average when compared to similar lakes.  Tullibee abundance was also the lowest to date at 0.5/gill net.  A lack of thermal habitat in 2007 resulted in large die offs of tullibee and is likely responsible at least in part for the recent decline in tullibee abundance.\n</p>",

Night electrofishing  to monitor the abundance of young-of-the-year (YOY), or Age-0, walleyes was done on September 27 and 28, 2010.  The total sample time was 3.5 hours, resulting in a YOY catch rate of 95.3 fish/hour.  Past YOY catch rates from fry stockings have ranged from 11.3 to 186.2 fish/hour, with a mean of 86.7/hour since 2001.  YOY fish accounted for 52% of the total catch and ranged in size from 4.2-6.9 inches with a mean length of 6.1 inches.  The catch rate of walleyes age-I and older was 89.3 fish/hour.  The 2009 year class was the strongest of these, accounting for 21% of the sample. <br> \n <br> \nElectrofishing data suggests that fry stocking has been successful in augmenting year class strength.  Fry stocking, along with natural reproduction, has been responsible for producing good year classes in ten of the twelve years since annual fry stocking began in 1999.  Since then, YOY fish have been sampled regularly.  Strong year classes documented via electrofishing have also shown up later in gill net samples and in the angler harvest. <br> \n</p>",

Numbers were down this year (3.6/net) and below average for this type of lake.  Size was decent however, with 72% of the fish measuring 12\" or larger. <br> \n <br> \nAnother popular species is largemouth bass.  Numbers looked healthy, with an electrofishing catch rate of 83.9/hr.  Average size was 10.7\", with 32% of the fish measuring 12\" or larger. <br> \n <br> \nThe northern pike numbers were average at 4.5/net.  Even with an average size of 24.7\" and 3.5 lbs, this was still below our goal of a 5 lb. average for this fast growing population. <br> \n <br> \nPanfish numbers looked good, but they were still down from previous surveys.  Black crappie were caught at the rate of 1.3/trap net and bluegill at 19.7/trap net.  Black crappie appeared to offer the better fishing opportunity, with 76% of the fish measuring 8\" or larger compared to only 12% of bluegill measuring 7\" or larger. <br> \n <br> \nGull Lake is designated as AIS (aquatic invasive species) infested waters because of zebra mussels.  Lake users should inspect and remove any aquatic plants and animals from their watercraft and trailers as well as pull the plug and drain all water from the watercraft, including bilges, livewells and baitwells. <br> \n</p>",

Fry survival appeared to be poor in all the Brainerd area lakes sampled this fall. Previous catch rates have ranged from 3.1/hr to 271.9/hr.  The YOY walleyes ranged in size from 5.6\" to 7.5\" with an average length of 6.6\".  The catch rate of walleyes age 1 and older was 10.4/hr.  These fish ranged in size from 9.6\" to 23.5\" with an average length of 15.0\".  One muskie measuring 19.8\" was also captured.  Muskies were stocked in the fall of 2016.</p>",

Two different gears were used:  boom shocker electrofishing, and new small mesh horizontal gill nets.  The gears were effective and efficient at catching perch between 2 to 6.5 inches, ages 0 to 3.  Standard survey nets do not routinely sample perch below 5.5 inches.  For both gears, length, age, sex, and maturity status were determined on a subsample of Yellow Perch and will be summarized in future reports.  More information is available from the Brainerd Area Fisheries Office.</p>",

Annual night electrofishing was conducted on October 1 & 2, 2018 to monitor the abundance of young-of-the-year (YOY) walleyes.  Fall electrofishing on Gull Lake is used to determine whether additional fingerling (4\"-6\") walleye stocking is needed.  Because YOY numbers were less than 30 per hour in two consecutive years (2017 and 2018), 28,050 fingerling walleyes were stocked in October 2018.  This is the first time that the fall fingerling contingency has been triggered.  The last time that fingerlings were stocked was 1997 when planned fingerling stockings were done in alternate years.  \n\nThe total sample time was 2 hours and 8 minutes, which resulted in a YOY catch rate of 6.6/hr run-time.  Previous catch rates have ranged from 3.1/hr run-time to 271.9/hr run time.  The YOY walleyes ranged in size from 7.1\" to 8.2\" with an average length of 7.7\".  The catch rate of walleyes age 1 and older was 5.2/hr run-time.  These fish ranged in size from 11.1\" to 19.5\" with an average length of 15.9\".  It takes roughly 3 years for walleyes in Round Lake to reach \"keeper\" size.  \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Walleye fry are stocked annually in Gull Lake (2,825,000/year).  Walleye fingerling stocking is on a contingency basis and was last done in 2018.  The gill net catch of 3.0/net was below average when compared to similar lakes.  Size was nice with an average length of 17.3\", and 80% measuring at least 12.0\" in length. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike were sampled in average numbers at 6.4/gill net.  Size was good with an average of 3.8 lbs and 25.6\".  Northern pike up to 38.0\" were captured.  Northern pike in the protected 22\"-26\" slot made up 39% of the catch, with 44% measuring at least 26.0\" in length.  Lakes in this part of the state have a new northern pike regulation enacted in 2018: possession limit of 10 with not more than 2 over 26\".  All from 22\"-26\" must be immediately released.  Please refer to the current Minnesota Fishing Regulations for additional information. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappies were sampled in average numbers in trap nets at 0.9/net.  Average length was 9.3\".  Only one crappie was sampled in gill nets.  For both gears combined 92% measured at least 8.0\" in length.  Bluegills were sampled in average numbers at 38.4/ trap net.  Most were on the small side, with an average length of 4.7\".  Only 5% were at least 7.0\" in length. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch and tullibee (cisco) are important prey for predator species such as walleye and northern pike.  Yellow perch were sampled in average numbers at 5.6/gill net.  Most were small with an average length of 6.7\".  A few individuals were larger than 8\" confirming the presence of some keeper-sized perch that have not been observed in Gull for some time.  Tullibee (cisco) were also sampled in average numbers at 2.7/gill net.   Average length was 14.1\". <br> \n <br> \nGull Lake is infested with zebra mussels.   Lake users are required to inspect and remove any aquatic plants and animals from their watercraft and trailers as well as pull the plug and drain all water from the watercraft, including bilges, livewells and baitwells. <br> \n</p>",

The 2020 gill net catch of 6.9/net was average when compared to similar lakes.  Size was nice with an average length of 16.6\" and 93% measuring at least 12.0\" in length.  The 2018 fingerling stocked year class made up 41% of the catch. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike were sampled in low numbers at 1.3/gill net.  Size was nice with an average of 3.8 lbs and 25.8\".  Northern Pike in the protected 22\"-26\" slot made up 25% of the catch, with 60% measuring at least 26.0\" in length.  Lakes in this part of the state have a new Northern Pike regulation enacted in 2018: possession limit of 10 with not more than 2 over 26\".  All from 22\"-26\" must be immediately released.  Please refer to the current Minnesota Fishing Regulations for additional information. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch and Tullibee (Cisco) are important prey for predator species such as Walleye and Northern Pike.  Yellow Perch were sampled in average numbers at 14.7/gill net.  Most were small with an average length of 6.3\". A few larger Yellow Perch are present, with 5% measuring at least 8.0\" in length and fish up to 11.6\" sampled.  Tullibee (Cisco) were also sampled in average numbers at 1.7/gill net.   Average length was 15.1\". <br> \n <br> \nZebra mussels are present in Gull Lake.   Lake users are required to inspect and remove any aquatic plants and animals from their watercraft and trailers as well as pull the plug and drain all water from the watercraft, including bilges, livewells and baitwells. <br> \n</p>",

Night electrofishing to monitor the abundance of young-of-the-year (YOY), walleyes was done on September 10th and 11th, 2012.  The total sample time was 2 hours and 38 minutes, resulting in a YOY catch rate of 36.8/hr run-time.  Past YOY catch rates from fry stockings have ranged from 11.3 to 271.9 fish/hour.  YOY fish accounted for 52% of the total catch and ranged in size from 5.2-7.3 inches with a mean length of 6.1 inches.  The catch rate of walleyes age-1 and older was 33.4/hr run-time.  These fish ranged in size from 7.9 to 22.4 inches and had a mean length of 10.5\". <br> \n <br> \nElectrofishing data suggests that fry stocking has been successful in augmenting year class strength.  Fry stocking, along with natural reproduction, has been responsible for producing good year classes in eleven of the fourteen years since annual fry stocking began in 1999.  Strong year classes documented via electrofishing have also shown up later in gill net samples and in the angler harvest. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A gill net survey was conducted on Gull Lake to evaluate the walleye, northern pike and perch populations.  Walleyes fry are stocked annually in Gull Lake (2,825,000/year).  Walleye fingerling stocking is on a contingency basis and was last done in 2018.  The gill net catch of 5.1/net was average when compared to similar lakes.  Size was nice with an average length of 18.1\" with 97% measuring at least 12\" in length.  Walleyes up to 26.5\" were sampled. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike were sampled at 2.9/gill net.  Size was nice with an average size of 4.0 lbs and 25.9\" with 59% of the catch measuring at least 24\" in length.  Northern pike up to 36.8\" were captured.  Lakes in this part of the state have a new northern pike regulation enacted in 2018: possession limit of 10 with not more than 2 over 26\".  All from 22\"-26\" must be immediately released.  Please refer to the current Minnesota Fishing Regulations for additional information. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch are an important forage species and were sampled in average numbers at 10.5/gill net.  Most were small with an average length of 6.8\".   <br> \n <br> \nGull Lake is infested with zebra mussels.   Lake users are required to inspect and remove any aquatic plants and animals from their watercraft and trailers as well as pull the plug and drain all water from the watercraft, including bilges, livewells and baitwells. <br> \n</p>",

The 2023 gill net catch of 5.4/net was average when compared to similar lakes.  Size was good with an average length of 17.8\" and 86% measuring at least 12.0\" in length.  The 2020 fingerling stocked year class made up 51% of the catch. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike were sampled in low numbers at 2.7/gill net.  Size was nice with an average of 3.8 lbs and 25.6\".  Northern Pike in the protected 22-26\" slot made up 33% of the catch, with 48% measuring at least 26.0\" in length. Starting in 2024 a new Northern Pike regulation is in effect on the Gull Chain of Lakes: all Northern Pike from 30-40\" must be immediately released with a possession limit of 2, only 1 over 40\". <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch and Tullibee (Cisco) are important prey for predator species such as Walleye and Northern Pike.  Yellow Perch were sampled in low numbers at 5.6/gill net.  Most were small with an average length of 6.6\".  Tullibee (Cisco) were sampled in average numbers at 1.9/gill net.   Average length was 11.6\". <br> \n <br> \nZebra mussels are present in Gull Lake.   Lake users are required to inspect and remove any aquatic plants and animals from their watercraft and trailers as well as pull the plug and drain all water from the watercraft, including bilges, livewells and baitwells. <br> \n</p>",

Night electrofishing to monitor the abundance of young-of-the-year (YOY), walleyes was done on September 14 and 15, 2011.  The total sample time was 3 hours and 10 minutes, resulting in a YOY catch rate of 271.9/hr run-time.  Past YOY catch rates from fry stockings have ranged from 11.3 to 186.2 fish/hour.  YOY fish accounted for 82% of the total catch and ranged in size from 4.8-7.1 inches with a mean length of 6.3 inches.  The catch rate of walleyes age-1 and older was 58.7/hr run-time.  These fish ranged in size from 7.6 to 20.2 inches and had a mean length of 10.4\". <br> \n <br> \nElectrofishing data suggests that fry stocking has been successful in augmenting year class strength.  Fry stocking, along with natural reproduction, has been responsible for producing good year classes in eleven of the thirteen years since annual fry stocking began in 1999.  Strong year classes documented via electrofishing have also shown up later in gill net samples and in the angler harvest. <br> \n</p>",

Gull Lake is located in the Crow Wing River watershed.  A nearshore survey was conducted to assess the populations of both game and non-game fish species.  Twenty four 100' long sampling stations were evenly spaced around the lakeshore.  Each station was then sampled by backpack electrofishing, and if conditions allowed with a 15' or 50' 1/8th inch seine. <br> \n <br> \nThe survey took place from August 11-28, 2017, with all 24 stations sampled by backpack electrofishing.  The 50' 1/8th inch seine was used at 10 stations and the 15' 1/8th inch seine was used at an additional 8 stations.  Obstacles prevented the use of seines at the other six sampling sites.  Twenty six species were sampled, including nine species that are intolerant of habitat disturbance:  Iowa darter, least darter, logperch, longnose dace, mimic shiner, pugnose shiner, blacknose shiner, mottled sculpin, rock bass, smallmouth bass, and banded killifish.  This nearshore survey will be used along with the gill net and trap net survey conducted on July 17-21, 2017 to calculate a Fish-Based Index of Biotic Integrity (FIBI) score.  The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health by the types of fish species present and comparing it to what is expected for this type of lake. <br> \n</p>",

Sampling stations were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at all 24 stations with five sites sampled from the boat. A 50-foot seine was used to sample 17 stations and conditions prevented the use of seines at seven sampling sites. Nearshore sampling captured a total of 25 native species of fish including 12 species that are intolerant of habitat disturbance and two tolerant species (Common Carp and Green Sunfish).   <br> \n <br> \nData from this targeted nearshore survey is combined with data from standard gill and trap netting surveys to calculate a Fish-based Index of Biological Integrity (FIBI) that describes the overall health of the lake. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment.  The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.   The FIBI score for Gull Lake based on this survey is above the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes.  Data from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Mississippi River-Brainerd Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Gull Lake is stocked annually with walleye fry.  A special assessment was done on July 19, 2010 to check the status of the walleye population, as well as related forage species and northern pike.  The walleye population looked good, at 7.3/net and an average length of 16.1\".  Twelve year classes were represented and 85% of the fish captured measured 12\" or longer. <br> \n <br> \nThe northern pike population looked healthy as well (4.2/net).  Average size was 24.3\" and 3.4 lbs.  The fish were fast growing and 45% were 24\" or larger. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch and tullibee (cisco), which are important forage fish for walleyes and northern pike, were also caught in good numbers for this type of lake.  Numbers have been higher in the past however.  A good number of perch over 8\" were caught  (21%) and sizes ranged from 5.4\" to 10.1\".  Tullibee sizes ranged from 7.5\" to 18.8\". <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species sampled included black crappie, bluegill, burbot, hybrid sunfish, largemouth bass, pumpkinseed, rock bass, white sucker, and yellow bullhead. <br> \n <br> \n*Note:  Zebra mussels are now in Gull Lake.  Please remember to follow all laws when entering and leaving Gull and connected lakes.  Pull all your drain plugs, inspect and clean your boat thoroughly, and dispose of unused bait before leaving this lake so these exotics aren't spread elsewhere.  It is also recommended to spray/rinse your boat with hot water (above 120 F) or let it dry at least five days. <br> \n</p>",

Night electrofishing was conducted on September 22 & 29, 2016 to monitor the abundance of young-of-the-year (YOY) walleyes.  The abundance of YOY walleyes can be an early indicator of the strength of the year class.  Walleye fingerlings are stocked when fall YOY are sampled below 30/hr in 2 consecutive years in accordance with the fisheries lake management plan.  The total sample time was 2 hours and 22 minutes, which resulted in a YOY catch rate of 44.4/hr.  Previous catch rates have ranged from 3.1/hr to 271.9/hr.  The YOY walleyes ranged in size from 5.9\" to 8.1\" with an average length of 7.1\".  The catch rate of walleyes age 1 and older was 7.6/hr.  These fish ranged in size from 9.9\" to 26.5\" with an average length of 13.9\".</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Walleye is the most popular species to target on Gull Lake.  Walleye are currently stocked as fry every year (2,825,000 fry).  Numbers were average this survey (6.0/gill net) and size was good, with an average length of 16.4\" and 89% measuring 12\" or larger.  A number of 2-year old walleye averaging 12.5\" are recruiting to the fishery. <br> \n <br> \nThe northern pike numbers were below average at 2.3/gill net.  Size was good, with an average length of 24.9\" and 53% measured 24\" or larger. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch and tullibee are important forage species for this lake.  The 2017 yellow perch catch was average for this type of lake (13.0/gill net).  Average length was 6.4\".  Tullibee numbers were also average (0.6/gill net), with an average size of 14.4\".  Due to tullibee being more common in pelagic (open) waters, our nets which sample the bottom six feet of the water column, may not accurately reflect their numbers.  Hydro acoustic surveys and recent results from the Jaycee's ice fishing tournament suggest their population may be much healthier than reflected in our standard survey nets. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass were sampled by night electrofishing at the rate of 126.7/hr.  This was the highest rate in the last 10 years.  Average length was 10.7\" and 36% were 12\" or larger. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie and bluegill numbers were high (2.2/trap net and 49.1/trap net, respectively), but size wasn't as impressive.  Average black crappie length was 8.4\", with 62% of the fish measuring 8\" or larger.  Average bluegill length was 5.4\", with only 9% of the fish measuring 7\" or larger. <br> \n <br> \nFollowing a robust public input process, muskellunge management in the Gull Chain was initiated in the fall of 2016 with the stocking of 2,000 fingerlings into Gull Lake.  A viable fishery can be expected to develop in roughly 8-10 years. <br> \n</p>",
