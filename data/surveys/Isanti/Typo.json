This is below the rate of 21 per net recorded in the last gill net survey in 1999, but still above average for Typo lake.  Black Crappies were sampled at rate of 29.5 per net in the gill nets and 2.2 per net in the trap nets. White Crappie were sampled at a rate of 1 fish per net in the gill nets and 3.33 fish per net in the trap nets.  These rates are average to above average for both species.  Northern Pike were sampled at a rate of 7.5 per gill net.  This is a significant increase from the last gillnet survey in 1999, and pike over 30 inches were sampled.   </p>",

The walleye population has increased dramatically (21/gillnet) since the last netting in 1995 (3.5/gillnet).  Lengths ranged from 8.4 to 24.3 inches with a 14.8 inch average.  Black and white crappie are present in moderate to high numbers.  Lengths for both species ranged from about 4.5 to 13.2 inches. Black crappies averaged 8.6 inches and white crappies averaged 9.5 inches.  Twelve inch plus fish were sampled for both crappie species, but were relatively sparse.  Bluegill are present in moderate numbers, with lengths between 4.4 and 8.6 inches and a 6.4 inch average.  Northern pike were sampled in moderate numbers with lengths ranging from 13.5 to 24.8 inches.  Black bullhead were abundant and averaged about 9 inches long.  Common carp were very abundant and averaged about 13.5 inches.  Yellow perch have been sampled in low to moderate past nettings, but only one was caught in 1999.    </p>",

The 2010 survey sampled 0.33 black bullheads per set which is the lowest catch recorded in the lake. Bluegills were found at their highest abundance for this lake. The average length sampled was 6.7 inches. Northern pike and walleye were sampled in low abundance. </p>",

Black crappies were the second most abundant species. Their numbers are also down since the last survey, but are still within the normal range for this type of lake. Crappies up to 15 inches were sampled. Bluegills were sampled in their highest abundace during the survey. The average length sampled was 7.5 inches. Over 80% of the bluegills captured exceeded 7 inches. Northern pike were taken in low numbers and were of average size. Walleyes numbers were low but those sampled were of a size anglers prefer.   </p>",
