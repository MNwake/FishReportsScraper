                "narrative": "<p>Northern pike, black bullhead, brown bullhead, pumpkinseed and hybrid sunfish are present in numbers significantly higher than local netting medians.  Bluegill were found in numbers significantly less than the local median.  Golden shiner and yellow perch were taken only in trap nets.  The 1974 lake survey was conducted from June 19-21, virtually the same time of year as this assessment.  Brown bullhead are present in similar numbers now (37.28/lift) as when surveyed in1974(52.0/lift).  Fish over 9\" made up the bulk of those taken in 1974 but are virtually unrepresented by this netting.  Black bullhead numbers in 1979(25.14/lift) are much higher than those found in 1974 (2.4/lift).  A shift in the dominance of smaller fish in the 1979 netting is evident.  Fewer northern pike were taken in 1979 (5.33/lift) than in the 1974 survey (12.00/lift).  The number per set of bluegills in 1974 was very high at 62.6 while in 1979 only 9.57 per lift were taken.It appears evident that a significant portion of the bluegill population was affected by the winterkill of 1978-79.  Pumpkinseed had catch ratess similar in both 1974 (13.2/lift) and 1979 (18.57/lift).  In 1974 black crappie were taken at 3.80 fish per trap net lift.  No black crappie were found in the 1979 netting.  Based on this netting and visual observations of dead fish along shore the species which appeared to have been most affected by the winterkill were bluegill, black crappie, and probably largemouth bass.  Northern pike were also affected since dead fish were observed, but the fairly large difference in the two catch rates may also be the result in part of poor reproductive success, and/or success of the stockings.</p>",

Black crappies were sampled in low numbers durung this assessment. Only 2 crappies sampled were larger than 10 inches. Walleyes from the 2002 stocking were sampled. Subsequent surveys and assessments will determine how well this species performs in this lake. Only one largemouth bass was captured due to the type of gear used during the assessment. Northern pike were sampled in average numbers for this type of lake. Sizes ranged from 15 to 36 inches, with an average of nearly 22 inches.</p>",

Snail Lake is primarily managed for Largemouth Bass and Northern Pike, with Walleye and Bluegill as secondary management species.  Walleye fry are stocked biennially at a rate of 2,000 per littoral acre (260,000 fry).  Snail Lake experienced a significant winterkill event during the winter of 2012-13, so additional Walleye fry, adult Black Crappie, and prespawn adult Largemouth Bass were stocked in 2014. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike catch rate was 15 fish per net in the gillnets, above average for class 38 lakes and a significant increase from the 7.75 fish pet net sampled in the last survey in 2004. Sampled Northern Pike ranged from 15 to 34 inches, with an average length of 21.79 inches.  over 51% of sampled pike were greater than 21 inches in length, 16% were greater than 25 inches, and 9% were greater than 26 inches.   The largest pike sampled in 2016 was 34.5 inches in length.  Two Walleyes were sampled in the trap nets at a catch rate of 0.22 fish per net.  This is below average for class 38 lakes.  Walleyes averaged 16.36 inches in length and were both from the 2013 fry stocking (age-3). <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass are typically not sampled effectively by gill nets or trap nets, however bass catch rate was 1.22 fish per trap net, above average for class 38 lakes.  Sampled bass ranged from 5 to 12.6 inches in length and the average Largemouth Bass sampled in 2016 was 10.48 inches long. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill catch rate was 33.44 fish per net in the trap nets, above average for class 38 lakes.  Sampled Bluegills ranged from 2.36 to 7.56 inches, and the average length was 4.9 inches.  Over 11% of Bluegills were greater than 6 inches in length and 4% were greater than 7 inches.  Pumpkinseeds, Green Sunfish, and hybrid Sunfish were all sampled at above average abundance.  Individuals greater than 8 inches were sampled of all three species.   <br> \n <br> \nBoth Black and Yellow Bullheads were sampled at average to above average abundances in the trap nets.  The average Black Bullhead was 7.77 inches in length, and the largest was 12.4 inches.  The average Yellow Bullhead was 8.49 inches in length and the largest was 14.17 inches. <br> \n</p>",

The high walleye catch rate may be due to the morphology of the lake basin which provides only limited areas of cool water habitat.  Northern pike were sampled at over 12 times the local median and exhibited average growth.  Recruitment was good with four age classes represented in the catch.  Bluegill catch rate was twice the local median.  Hybrid sunfish, green sunfish, and pumpkinseeds were above local median levels with most fish quite small.  Bullheads were sampled at levels below the local median.</p>",

Largemouth bass are present in moderate numbers, but were not adequately sampled by the gears used in this survey.  Pumpkinseed and hybrid sunfish were sampled in moderate numbers, with average lengths of 4.5 and 5.5 inches, respectively.  Brown, black, and yellow bullheads were sampled, with brown bullheads dominant.  Yellow perch were also sampled, but in low numbers.  </p>",
