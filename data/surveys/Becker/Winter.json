This was the first survey completed by Minnesota DNR staff. Species sampled during this assessment included Northern Pike, Black Crappie, Bullhead (Black and Brown), Golden Shiner, Largemouth Bass, and Yellow Perch.  <br> \n <br> \nThe most abundant gamefish found during the survey was Northern Pike. Sampled Northern Pike ranged in length from 14 to 22 inches and averaged 17 inches long. Black Crappie were also abundant, ranging in lengths from 11 to 12 inches long. Yellow Perch were present, but small with an average length of six inches.  <br> \n <br> \nA single Largemouth Bass was caught during this survey. Black Bullhead were extremely abundant in catch, averaging 34 fish per trap net. Additional species captured were Brown Bullhead and Golden Shiner. Based on the size of the fish observed, it is likely that Lost Lake experienced a winterkill sometime in the last 5 to 10 years, limiting the abundance and diversity of fish species in the lake.  </p>",
