                "narrative": "<p>Centennial Lake is an 8.6-acre lake located downtown Edina, Minnesota.  Plenty of available shoreline for public use provides a great opportunity for shore fishing.  The species of interest for anglers are bluegill and largemouth bass.  The Fishing in the Neighborhood Program (FiN) collaborates with other organizations to promote access, habitat restoration and community stewardship.  The collaboration at Centennial Lake has provided a unique fishing opportunity within a developed business area.  Some results of this collaborations included seventeen kid fishing events sponsored by MinnAqua and restoration of a buffer with native shoreland plants along the northern basin. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill sunfish are a great fish species to encourage youth fishing.  Bluegill sunfish captured during this assessment averaged 6.65 inches in length.  Bluegills sampled were considered to be above the quality length (6 inches) for bluegill sunfish.   <br> \n <br> \nOther species of interest present were the green sunfish, hybrid sunfish, pumpkinseed sunfish, black bullhead and golden shiner.  Green sunfish abundance was above average with lengths averaging 3.8 inches.  One hybrid sunfish was captured and measured 7.2 inches in length.  Pumpkinseed sunfish caught averaged 4.6 inches in length.  Black bullheads were caught with an average length of 8.2 inches with the largest measuring 10.4 inches.  The sixth species sampled in Centennial Lake was the golden shiner.  Golden shiners caught averaged 5.5 inches in length and are a great prey species for the largemouth bass present in Centennial Lake. <br> \n <br> \nMore information about Centennial Lake can be found at: http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/fishing/fin/kidsponds/centennial.html. <br> \n <br> \nFor more information about the FiN program or to see what FiN has done in your neighborhood, check out http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/fishing/fin/index.html. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Centennial Lake is an 8.6-acre lake located in downtown Edina, Minnesota and is managed by the Fishing in the Neighborhood (FiN) program.  Under the FiN program, Centennial Lake will continue to be stocked and utilized for urban fishing.  This lake consists of three small basins and test netting was conducted on two of the three basins.  A floating dock across the channel prohibited boat access to the third basin.  Two other surveys have been conducted on this lake in 2001 and 2006.  One access is located on the lake and is available for the park maintenance crew.  Available open shoreline and park facilities make this a great lake for public fishing. <br> \n <br> \nOne gill net and six trap nets were used in this assessment. Seven species were captured.  Adult bluegills have been stocked every year into Centennial Lake since 2001.  Largemouth bass and northern pike are stocked as well, however sources for these species are limited which results in year-by-year determination of stocking.  Three adult northern pike were captured during this survey.  They averaged 21.3 inches in length and one was measured to be 23.5 inches long. Average weight of these fish was 2.3 pounds. <br> \n <br> \nThere were no largemouth bass and only one bluegill sampled during this survey.  The bluegill sunfish captured was 6.3 inches in length. <br> \n <br> \nAnother game species captured during this survey was the black crappie. There were no black crappies captured in the 2006 survey however, during this survey there were 14 captured.  They were caught at an average of 7.5 inches in length. The largest black crappie captured was 9 inches long. <br> \n <br> \nOther sunfish species of interest were the green sunfish, hybrid sunfish and pumpkinseed sunfish. Green sunfish averaged 4 inches in length and were all below the quality size of 6 inches for this species.  Number of hybrid sunfish caught increased from the 2006 survey to 38 total fish being caught.  The average length of hybrid sunfish was 4.5 inches and the maximum length was 6.4 inches. Six pumpkinseed sunfish were caught, averaging 3.6 inches in length.  All pumpkinseed were below the quality length (6 inches) of this species. <br> \n <br> \nBlack bullhead catch rates decreased from the previous survey.  Average length was 8.7 inches, with the largest black bullhead caught measuring 9.5 inches in length.   <br> \n <br> \nStocking of fish has been conducted to provide angling opportunities for shore anglers.  These seven fish species will provide excellent opportunity for urban fishing at Centennial Lakes Park.   <br> \n <br> \nMore information about Centennial Lake can be found at: http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/fishing/fin/kidsponds/centennial.html. <br> \n <br> \nFor more information about the FiN program or to see what FiN has done in your neighborhood, check out http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/fishing/fin/index.html. <br> \n</p>",
