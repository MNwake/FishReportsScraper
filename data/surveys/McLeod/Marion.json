                "narrative": "<p>Lake Marion is a 594 acre lake north of Brownton in  McLeod County.  It is composed of two basins connected by a culvert.  Fisheries management activities focus on the south basin which is 416 acres with a maximum depth of 12 feet.  The north basin is 178 acres with a maximum depth of 4 feet.  Lake Marion has been chemically reclaimed several times, most recently in 1979.  A helixor aeration system is in operation, which may reduce winterkill frequency.  A fishing pier in the County Park and road access along the east shore parallel to Highway 15 provide additional shore angling opportunities.  Camping is also available in the County Park.   The lake has moderate water quality and diverse fish and aquatic vegetation communities.  An abundance of aquatic vegetation provides important fish habitat, but can make angling difficult at times.  The fish community in Lake Marion includes bluegill, black crappie, channel catfish, largemouth bass, northern pike, walleye, and yellow perch.   Panfish angling is usually good and accounts for much of the fishing pressure.   A fisheries survey conducted in 1996 sampled above normal numbers of black crappie for this lake type.  The large numbers of age 2 fish kept the average length at 7 inches (4.5-11.9 inches), but should provide good angling in the next several years.  Similarly, bluegill catches were above normal for this lake type with a short average length under 5 inches (3.2-8.6 inches).  Age 2 fish again were the largest group which should provide good angling in the near future.   Walleye numbers have been consistently above normal for this lake type since reclamation.  This population is maintained through stocking, though natural reproduction was documented in the 1994 year class.  Fry and fingerlings were stocked in alternate years through 1993, and fry were stocked in 1995 and 1996.  Average lengths were good at almost 17 inches with some fish over 25 inches being sampled.  The majority of fish were between 2 and 4 years old, but fish up to 8 years were also present.  This means good fishing now and over the next several years.  Yellow perch numbers have fluctuated and were below average, but within the normal range for this lake type in 1996.  Average length was 6 inches (4.7-7.0 inches).  The majority of fish were age 3, so yellow perch angling may be at its best the next couple of years, but may not be great.     Northern pike numbers in 1996 were the highest since reclamation and above average, but within the normal range for lakes of this type.  Numbers have historically been below average, but also within the normal range.  Average length was good at 25 inches (15.6-29.3 inches).  The majority of fish were age 3, so angling should be good in 1997.   Adults and fingerlings  were last stocked was 1985.  Good numbers of largemouth bass were sampled by electrofishing.  Average length was 10 inches (3.9-17.5 inches).  The majority of fish were age 2, so angling should be good for the next few years.  Channel catfish catches in gillnets and trotlines were good in 1996.  Average lengths were 19 (11.8- 32.6) and 28 (22.6-34.5) inches, respectively.  Trotlines sample larger fish than go gillnets.  Fish from both gear types were aged with the majority being 11-13 years.  Fingerlings are stocked annually or biannually.  The best angling for these fish is evenings in mid-summer.   </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Marion, McLeod County, is a 594 acre lake with a maximum depth of 12 feet.  During the August 7, 2000, population assessment fourteen species (including hybrid sunfish) were sampled.  The lake management plan lists bluegill, black crappie, and walleye as primary management species.  Northern pike, largemouth bass, and channel catfish are listed as secondary species.  A total of 517 bluegill were sampled by trap net for a catch rate of 57.4 per net.  Bluegill range in length form 3.0 to 8.0  inches and averaged 5.4 inches.  The catch rate was within the expected range for lakes of this type.  Bluegill were I to VII years old with seven year classes represented.  Growth was average for area lakes.  A total of 989 black crappie were sampled by gill net for a catch rate of 109.9 per set.  Black crappie ranged in length from 4.1 to 9.8 inches and averaged 6.1 inches.  The catch rate was above the expected range.  Black crappie were I to V years old with five year classes represented.  Growth was average.A total of 87 walleye were sampled by gill net for a catch rate of 9.7 per net.  Walleye ranged in length from 8.9 to 27.6 inches and averaged 18.2 inches.  Average weight was 2.3 pounds.  The catch rate was slightly above the expected range.  Walleye were I to VIII years old with eight year classes represented.  Growth was average.  Walleye fry (1,000 per littoral acre) are stocked on a two-out-of-three-year rotation.  Fall electrofishing has documented walleye natural reproduction.A total of 104 northern pike were sampled by gill net for a catch rate of 11.6 per set.  Northern pike ranged in length from 18.2 to 31.0 inches and averaged 23.1 inches.  Average weight was 2.7 pounds.  The northern pike catch rate was the highest ever recorded and above the expected range.A total of 40 largemouth bass were sampled by spring night-time electrofishing for a catch rate of 26.7 per hour of electrofishing.  Largemouth bass ranged in length from 3.6 to 19.4 inches and averaged 11.9 inches.  Growth was fast.    A total of 33 channel catfish were sampled in gill nets for a catch rate of 3.7 per net.  Channel catfish ranged in length from 14.9 to 32.5 inches and averaged 20.8 inches.  Average weight was 3.9 pounds.  Catch rate was similar to past surveys.  Channel catfish were I to XV years old with six year classes represented. Growth was similar to channel catfish in Lake Allie.  Channel catfish are stocked every-other-year at a rate of 10 yearlings per littoral acre.  Since the lake was reclaimed in 1979, partial winterkills have taken place despite aeration.  A creel survey conducted in 1995 and 1996 identified Lake Marion as a popular summer and winter fishery.  Most angling pressure was directed at panfish, black crappie, and walleye.  Lake Marion has a shore fishing area on the southeast side of the lake and a fishing pier at the county park on the east side.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>STATUS OF THE FISHERY: <br> \nLake Marion was chemically reclaimed October 1979 and this assessment was made to determine the current status of fish populations.  Most abundant species were walleye (6.0/gillnet) and channel catfish (9.2/gillnet).  Trapnetting took bluegill (24.33/set) and largemouth bass at 2.77/set.  Growth rates are exceptional and some age 1 bluegills measure 7.5 inches total length (TL).  Largest Largemouth bass was 12.1 inches TL (age 1).  A total of 321 channel catfish were marked with disc dangler tags for long-term growth studies.  Survival of stocked fish has been good.  A population estimate shows 83% of channel catfish survived from stocking December 1979.  Estimate equals 5,800 age 2 fish.  Walleye fry stocking appears to be successful noting the presence of age 0 and age 1 fish.  Older walleye are the result of rescue stocking from Hook Lake.  Fish not stocked, but taken in assessment nets, are black Bullhead (8.11/trapnet) white sucker (0.2/gillnet) and one white crappie.  During fall 1981, fishing pressure had begun to increase as fish became vulnerable to anglers.  Largemouth bass was most commonly sought by anglers.   <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A standard survey (summer gill netting and trap netting) was conducted on Lake Marion during the week of 8/10/2015, to monitor the fish population.  Water clarity was low, with a secchi disc reading of 1.5 feet.  The likely cause of the poor water clarity was an algal bloom.  Lake Marion dissolved oxygen  levels, measured in parts per million (ppm), were moderate with a dissolved oxygen concentration of 6.2 ppm from the surface down to a depth of 10 feet, while bottom oxygen was lower at 4.2 ppm.  Lake Marion is primarily managed for walleye, black crappie, and bluegill, but also supports populations of northern pike, largemouth bass, and channel catfish.  A fishing pier was available for anglers at the county park on the east side of the lake.  A popular shore fishing area, on the southeast side of the lake, was also present.  An aeration system is operated at Marion, during the winter, to reduce the frequency and severity of winterkill.  Winter anglers should use caution around the posted thin ice and open water area of the lake. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye gill net catches in Lake Marion averaged 6.1/net, which is within the normal range expected for Lake Marion.  Of the 43 walleye captured in gill nets, the average size was 17.6 inches with a maximum length of 24 inches.  Size structure and condition were good and were at expected levels.  Walleye fry are stocked into Lake Marion on a schedule of two out of three years to maintain walleye numbers.  Age analysis indicated seven different age classes of walleye, dating back to 2006.  All of the year classes present do not correlate to stocked years, suggesting that some natural reproduction may be occurring.  Walleye in Lake Marion appear to be sustaining a catchable population with the current stocking regime.  Catch rates, size structure, and condition are meeting or exceeding management goals and should provide good angling opportunity for anglers.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike gill net catches reached historic lows during 2015 sampling.  The catch rate was at or above the normal range between 1992 through 2003.  Since 2003, there has been a downward trend in catch rate, and in 2015, only one northern pike was caught in gill nets.  Age analysis was conducted on three fish (one from gill netting and two from trap nets).  The three fish were all at least five years or older.  Limited access to spawning areas and a possible decrease in submergent vegetation abundance and diversity appear to have contributed to the low numbers of pike in Lake Marion.  A more in-depth aquatic plant survey is scheduled for 2016.  <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie gill net catches averaged 6.7/net, which is within the normal range expected for Lake Marion.  Net catches for Black Crappie have been in the normal range for six of the past seven surveys.  Average size of crappie sampled in gill nets was 9 inches, with a maximum length of 10.5 inches. Trap nets also sampled an above average number (10/net) of black crappie which was within the normal range expected for Lake Marion.  Crappie caught in trap nets had a similar size structure to those caught in gill nets, with an average size of 9 inches, and a maximum length of 11 inches.  Size structure and condition appear to be above average for black crappie.  Age analysis revealed five year classes (from age 0 to 4) of black crappie.  This information suggests that black crappies are consistently reproducing and growing well in Lake Marion and should provide good angling opportunity in the future. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill trap net catches averaged 3.7/net, which was below the expected catch rate (10.8/net) for the third consecutive survey.  Five consecutive surveys, between 1987and 2000, produced bluegill net catches exceeding the high end of the expected range (29.5/net) for Lake Marion. There has been a noticeable change in the fish community in the previous fifteen years.  Six consecutive year classes were present in the 2015 sampling; however, very few fish (< 7) were present in each group. While overall numbers are down, bluegill size structure is up.  Average size of bluegill, found in trap nets were 6.5 inches, with a maximum length of 8.2 inches.  Although abundance of bluegill is limited, those remaining have desirable size structure and condition.  Any efforts to increase bluegill numbers in Lake Marion would likely begin with improving water clarity and aquatic vegetation abundance and diversity.  <br> \n  <br> \nLargemouth bass, in Lake Marion, were sampled with boat electrofishing in 2015.  Prior to 2015, there had been a trend of decreasing catches over the previous five surveys.  The 2015 sampling saw an increase in catch rate (13.4/hour) from a record low (7.8/hour) the previous survey.  Despite an increase in catch rates, age analysis still revealed concerns with the largemouth bass population.  Six year classes were aged, with the oldest being ten years old.  However, no bass were sampled below the age of four.  Despite low numbers of bass, size structure and condition appeared to be at desirable levels, with an average size of 15.9 inches and maximum length of 20.5 inches.  Currently, Lake Marion has a low density but high quality bass fishery. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch gill net catches averaged 26.7/net, which exceeded the upper end of the normal range that would be expected for Lake Marion.  Yellow perch in Lake Marion are not managed as a primary or secondary management species.  Very few times have substantial numbers of yellow perch exceeded eight inches.  Due to these factors, yellow perch in Lake Marion are treated as a forage species for other game fish and are not actively managed as part of the sport fishery. <br> \n <br> \nChannel catfish stocking was discontinued in 2008.  The two surveys following 2008, showed a decrease in catfish numbers, with two being netted during the 2015 sampling.  One of these catfish was 28.8 inches while the other was 18 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack bullhead net catches reached historic highs in 2015, with a gill net catch rate of 198/net. This rate was over double what would be expected for Lake Marion.  The average size of black bullheads, sampled in gill nets, was 9.7 inches with a maximum length of 11.1 inches.  During the previous twenty years, black bullhead numbers had been below 9.6/net. <br> \n <br> \nCommon carp gill net (2.3/net) and trap net (2.1/net) catches exceeded the average catch rate expected for Lake Marion.  Average size of carp captured in gill nets was 14 inches, with a maximum length of 28.4 inches.  Trap nets captured carp with an average size of 19.1 inches and maximum length of 27.2 inches. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Fall electrofishing was conducted at Marion Lake in 2017 to evaluate young of the year Walleye (YWAE) and yearling Walleye (YRLWAE) abundance.  Electrofishing sampled 308 YWAE for a catch rate of 154.0/hour, which was the second highest on record for Marion.  The 2017 year class would likely be considered strong.  The 2017 YWAE average length was 7.22 inches, which indicated that growth was fairly fast for this lake.  The latest Walleye stocking regime (520,000 fry two out of three years) was initiated in 1995.  Fall electrofishing catch rates from 1994 to 2017 (n=22) ranged from 0.0 to 396.0/hour with an average of 44.8.  Catch rates from stocked years (n=14) ranged from 0.7 to 396.0/hour with an average of 64.2.  Catch rates from non-stocked years (n=8) ranged from 0.0 to 31.1/hour with an average of 10.7.  With an average that was over five times higher during stocked years, fry stocking appears to be having a positive influence on YWAE abundance at Marion Lake.  A definitive answer could not be reached because of the inability to differentiate stocked fish from naturally reproduced fish during years when fry were stocked.  Natural reproduction, during non-stocked years, was documented 7 out of 8 times (88%).  None of those YWAE year classes were considered strong, with the largest non-stocked year catch rate being 31.1/hour.  This suggests that stocking is required to maintain a quality Walleye fishery at Marion Lake.  Electrofishing sampled 29 YRLWAE for a catch rate of 14.5/hour.  The YRLWAE average length was 12.0 inches, indicating fast growth.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A standard survey was conducted at Marion Lake beginning on August 6, 2019, to monitor the lake's fish population and to evaluate the 1995 Walleye fry stocking regime.  Marion is a class 42 lake and net catches were compared to other similar lakes around the state.  The 2016 MNDNR Fisheries lake management plan (LMP) listed Black Crappie and Walleye as the primary management species at Marion Lake.  Bluegill, Largemouth Bass, and Northern Pike were listed as secondary management species.  In 2019, a total of 12 species were sampled in the gill nets (GN), trap nets (TN), or by spring night-time electrofishing (EF).  The dissolved oxygen concentration was 2.0 mg/l, just off the bottom, indicating a mixed lake where fish could be found throughout all depths.  Water clarity was poor with a secchi disk reading of 3.0 feet, due to an algae bloom.  A fishing pier is available at the McLeod County Park on the lake's east shore.  A shore fishing area is also present on the southeast shore.  A winter aeration system is operated annually to potentially reduce the frequency and severity of winterkill at Marion Lake.  Marion has not had a severe winterkill for decades.  Winter anglers are advised to use caution when ice fishing on lakes with aeration systems and to stay clear of the open water area surrounded by \"thin ice\" signs.  <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled high numbers of Walleye (269) for a catch rate of 44.8/net, which was way above the normal range for this type of lake and the highest ever recorded at Marion.  The 2016 LMP's long-range goal for Walleye (>7.3/GN) was met.  Walleye were the most abundant fish sampled by GN in 2019.  The 2015 GN catch rate was much lower (6.1/net).  Catch rates from 1969 to 2019 (n=16), under various stocking regimes, were variable, ranging from 0.0 to 44.8/net and averaging 14.8/net.  In 2019, gill netted Walleye were 11.5 to 27.9 inches long averaging 14.0 inches.  Trap nets also sampled large Walleye, up to 27.8 inches in length.  Approximately 93% of the GN catch was 12 inches or longer, indicating that a quality population was present.  Gill netted Walleye were estimated to be age-2 to age-14 with ten year classes present.  The 2017 year class was ranked as strong, and was the strongest year class ever measured at Marion.  In 2019, the 2015 and 2016 year classes were considered to be moderate in size.  Growth was fast.  In 2019, non-stocked years accounted for 5% of the GN aged Walleye.  The contribution from natural reproduction during fry stocked years remained unknown, due to the inability to differentiate the two groups.  Gill net catch rates from 2000 to 2019 (n=7), during the 1995 stocking regime (520,000 fry 2 of 3 years), ranged from 2.6 to 44.8/net averaging 16.0/net, indicating a successful stocking strategy. Walleye anglers could expect plenty of action at Marion, but may need to try some different techniques since potentially abundant natural forage could slow the bite down. <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled low numbers (<5/GN) of Northern Pike (5) for a catch rate of 0.8/net, which was below the normal range for this type of lake, and the third lowest ever recorded at Marion.  The 2015 catch rate was also low at 0.1/net, following a fish kill of Northern Pike in 2013 (water temperature likely got too warm for this cool water fish).  The 2016 LMP's Northern Pike long-range goal (1.5 to 7.0/net) was not met.  Historic catch rates from 1969 to 2019 (n=16) were variable, ranging from 0.0 to 11.6/net averaging 4.5/net.  Historically, recruitment would be classified as low to moderate at Marion Lake.  Northern Pike were last stocked in 1985 at Marion.  In 2019 gill netted Northern Pike were 13.1 to 33.4 inches long with a mean of 24.5.  Trap nets also sampled low numbers (5) Northern Pike, ranging in length from 13.1 to 32.9 inches in length.  Low Northern Pike abundance over the last 7 years has likely helped Walleye flourish at Marion Lake.  Marion is within the Southern Management Zone regulation area for Northern Pike, which has a 24 inch minimum size limit (all fish less than 24 inches in length must be immediately released) in place.  The regulation is designed to increase pike abundance and improve the size of harvested fish.  Pike anglers should not expect a lot of action at Marion, but if you do catch one, it will probably be nice in size.   <br> \n <br> \nTrap nets sampled low numbers (24) of Black Crappie in 2019 for a catch rate of 2.7/net, which was just within the lakes normal range.  The 2016 LMP's long range goal (2.4 to 15.1/TN) was met.  The 2015 Black Crappie TN catch rate was 10.0/net.  Trap net catch rates from 1969 to 2019 (n=15) were highly variable, ranging from 0.0 to 66.2/net averaging 12.7/net.  In 2019, trap netted Black Crappie were 6.6 to 12.2 inches long averaging 9.8 inches.  Gill nets sampled moderate numbers (72) of Black Crappie for a catch rate of 12.0/net, which was within the normal range for this lake type.  Historic GN catch rates from 1969 to 2019 (n=16) were highly variable, ranging from 0.0 to 109.9/net averaging 18.9/net.  In 2019, gill netted Black Crappie were 7.1 to 13.1 inches long averaging 10.2 inches.  Approximately 49% of the GN catch was 11 inches or longer, indicating that a high quality population was present in 2019.  Size distribution tables indicated that at least three year classes were present, but recruitment was not consistent.  Crappie angling can be up and down on Marion, but anglers should have decent luck with a better than average sized fish being caught in 2020.   <br> \n <br> \nTrap nets sampled low numbers of Bluegill (14) for a catch rate of 1.6/net which was below the normal range for this type of lake and was the second lowest catch on record since the lake was reclaimed in 1979.  The 2016 LMP's Bluegill long-range goal (1.9 to 29.5) was not met.  Historic catch rates from 1969 to 2019 (n=15) were highly variable, ranging from 0.0 to 91.2/net, averaging 27.9/net.  The latest four TN catch rates (2007, 2010, 2015, and 2019) were all very low (<3.8/net), likely indicating that some type of ecological shift had occurred when compared to the 1981 to 2003 time period (17.7 to 91.2/net).  A vegetation survey was conducted in 2016 and data indicated a very marginal aquatic plant community.  In 2019, trap netted Bluegill were 3.7 to 9.1 inches long averaging 6.8 inches.  In 2019, gill nets also sampled low numbers of Bluegill (17) for a catch rate of 2.8/net, with fish ranging from 3.5 to 10.0 inches in length and exhibiting an average of 7.4 inches.  Approximately 38% of the GN catch was 8 inches or longer, indicating that at least a few quality sized fish were present in the population.  Low catch rates indicated inconsistent recruitment for this species.  Don't expect a lot of action if you are targeting Bluegill at Marion, but nice sized fish are a definite possibility. <br> \n <br> \nSpring night-time electrofishing targeting Largemouth Bass sampled low to moderate numbers (34) of fish for a catch rate of 17.0/hour.  The 2016 LMP's Largemouth Bass long-range goal (>8.5/hour) was met.  Historic EF surveys from 1992 to 2019 (n=9) were variable, ranging from 7.8 to 50.8/hour and averaging 18.5/hour, indicating a typical catch for Marion in 2019.  In 2019, EF Largemouth Bass were 9.9 to 19.5 inches long averaging 15.0 inches.  Approximately 21% of the catch was 18 inches or longer.  A marginal aquatic plant community likely continues to limit the Largemouth Bass population at Marion Lake.  Bass anglers should find some fish hanging out under the docks at Marion.  <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled moderate numbers of Channel Catfish (39) for a catch rate of 6.5/net, which was the third highest catch ever measured at Marion.  The 2015 GN catch rate (0.3/net) was much lower.  Historic GN catch rates from 1969 to 2019 (n=16) were generally low, ranging from 0.0 to 11.3/net averaging 3.0.  In 2019, gill netted Channel Catfish were 15.4 to 32.3 inches long averaging 20.3 inches.  The gill and trap net size distributions showed that recruitment was inconsistent, but most (85%) of the GN and TN fish were from 18.0 to 21.9 inches in length, likely indicating one strong year class.  Channel Catfish were last stocked in 2006, so the current population has resulted from natural reproduction.  Catfish anglers might expect decent action from some nice sized fish at Marion.         <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled moderate numbers of Yellow Perch (83) for a catch rate of 13.8/net, which was within the normal range for this type of lake.  Historic GN catch rates from 1969 to 2019 (n=16) were highly variable ranging from 0.0 to 542.8/net and averaging 52.1.  In 2019, gill netted Yellow Perch were 2.9 to 11.1 inches long averaging 8.3 inches.  Approximately 65% of the GN catch was 8.5 inches or longer, indicating that a fishable population is present.  Yellow Perch were aged and fish were found to be age-0 to age-4 with five year classes present.  Age-1, age-2, and age-3 fish accounted for 21%, 46%, and 25% of the GN aged fish, respectively.  No super-mega-jumbos, but a few keeper perch were occasionally available at Marion.  <br> \n <br> \nTrap nets sampled low to moderate numbers of Common Carp (25) for a catch rate of 2.8/net, which was within the normal range for this type of lake.  Historic TN catch rates (n=15) from 1969 to 2019 were variable, ranging from 0.0 to 6.8/net and averaging 1.6/TN.  Trap netted Common Carp were 22.0 to 29.1 inches long averaging 24.5 inches.  Gill nets sampled moderate numbers of Common Carp (26) for a catch rate of 4.3/net, which was above the normal range for this lake type.  Historic GN catch rates were variable, ranging from 0.0 to 18.5/net and averaging 2.9/net.  In 2019, gill netted Common Carp were 9.0 to 27.6 inches long averaging 24.3 inches.  Size distribution data indicated that multiple year classes were present.  Bow anglers targeting carp should have decent action at Marion but the water is not always clear enough for good sightings.   <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled low numbers of Black Bullhead (45) for a catch rate of 7.5/net, which was below the normal range for this type of lake.  The 2015 catch was significantly higher at 198.0/GN.  Historic GN catch rates from 1969 to 2019 (n=16) were highly variable, ranging from 0.0 to 198.0/net averaging 47.1/net.  In 2019, trap nets also sampled low numbers of Black Bullhead (7) for a catch rate of 0.8/net, which was below the normal range for this lake type.  Historic TN catch rates from 1969 to 2019 (n=15) ranged from 0.0 to 334.0/net averaging 36.7/net.    <br> \nAdditional fishes sampled in the standard gear included; Brown Bullhead, Golden Shiner, and Yellow Bullhead.  <br> \n</p>",

A total of 220 YOY were sampled for a catch rate of 220.0/hour, which was the second highest catch rate ever recorded at Marion and was within the lake's historical fourth quartile (> 44.5). The 2022 year appears strong in abundance. In 2022, the mean length for YOY was 6.4 inches, which was within Marion's historical second quartile (6.2 to 6.5), indicating moderate growth (within the inter-quartile range) for this lake. In 2022, 0 yearling were sampled, for a catch rate of 0.0/hour, which was within Marion's historical first quartile (0.0 to 0.0). The 2021 YOY catch rate was only 9.0/hour and these two catch rates suggest a weak 2021 Walleye year class.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A population assessment was conducted at Marion Lake in 2007.  A drought occurred during the summer of 2007 resulting in low lake levels.  An aerator is operated during the winter at Marion Lake and winterkill has not been reported for many years.  Marion is primarily managed for bluegill, black crappie and walleye.  <br> \n <br> \nA total of 86 walleye were gill netted for a catch rate of 9.6/net, which indicated that good numbers of fish were present for this type of lake.  The catch rate in 2005 was 12.8/net.  In 2007 gill netted walleye were 8.5-26.8 inches long averaging 14.4 inches.  Approximately 55% of the gill net catch was 13 inches or longer.  Walleye were 1-12 years old with 12 year-classes present.  Years when walleye were stocked accounted for 71% of the gill net catch, although some or all of that proportion could have come from natural reproduction.  Age 2 fish made up 38% of the gill net catch in 2007.  The current walleye stocking regime (1,000 fry/littoral acre two-out-of-three years) was initiated in 1995.  Gill net catches during the current regime (2000,2003,2005,2007) ranged from 2.6-12.8/net, averaging 8.7/net.     <br> \n <br> \nA total of 21 northern pike were gill netted for a catch rate of 2.3/net, which indicated that low numbers were present.  The catch rate in 2005 was 5.0/net.  Gill net catch rates for northern pike have been decreasing since the 2000 assessment.  In 2007, northern pike were 17.8-30.2 inches long averaging 22.5 inches.  Trap nets sampled northern pike up to 32.3 inches in length.  Northern pike were 1-6 with 6 year-classes present.  Anglers reported a summerkill of northern pike in 2006, which may have been linked to abnormally high water temperatures.   <br> \n <br> \nA total of 27 yellow perch were gill netted for a catch rate of 3.0/net, which indicated that low numbers were present.  The catch rate in 2005 was 55.9/net.  In 2007, yellow perch were 5.5-8.7 inches long averaging 6.8 inches.  Yellow perch were 2-4 years old with 3 year-classes present.   <br> \n <br> \nA total of 39 channel catfish were gill netted for a catch rate 4.3/net, which indicated that moderate numbers were present.  The catch rate in 2005 was 1.0/net.  In 2007, gill netted channel catfish were 11.0-30.9 inches long averaging 14.7 inches.  Channel catfish were 2-12 years old with 7 year-classes present.  Age 2 fish accounted for 78% of the fish that could be aged.  Since fish were not stocked in 2005, this indicated that channel catfish were capable of producing large year-classes naturally.  Only 14% of the age sample corresponded with stocked year-classes.  The old stocking regime of 10 yearlings/littoral acre every-other-year began in 1992 and ended in 2002.  A new regime (30 fingerlings/littoral acre every-other-year) began in 2004.   <br> \n <br> \nA total of 31 black crappie were trap netted for a catch rate of 3.4/net, which is typical for this type of lake.  The trap net catch rate in 2003 was 4.2/net.  Trap net catch rates for black crappie have been decreasing since the 1995 assessment.  In 2007, trap netted black crappie were 5.0-10.0 inches long averaging 7.8 inches.  A total of 286 black crappie were gill netted for a catch rate of 31.8/net, indicating that high numbers were present.  The gill net catch rate in 2005 was 9.9/net.  Gill net catch rates of black crappie have been up and down since the 1995 assessment, showing no obvious trend.  In 2007, gill netted black crappie were 3.6-10.8 inches long averaging 7.6 inches.  Approximately 35% of the gill net catch was 8 inches or longer.  Black crappie were 1-5 years old with 5 year-classes present.  Age 2 fish accounted for 73% of the gill net catch.   <br> \n <br> \nA total of 10 bluegill were trap netted for a catch rate of 1.1/net, which indicated that low numbers were present.  The 2007 catch rate was the lowest on record since the lake was reclaimed with rotenone in 1979.  The catch rate in 2003 was 17.7/net.  Bluegill catch rates have been decreasing since the 1996 assessment.  In 2007, bluegill were 2.8-7.0 inches long averaging 5.5 inches.  Bluegill were 1-4 years old with 4 year-classes present.   <br> \n <br> \nA total of 5 carp were trap netted for a catch rate of 0.6/net, which indicated that low numbers were present.  The catch rate in 2003 was 0.9/net.  In 2007, trap netted carp were 18.6-26.0 inches long averaging 22.7 inches. <br> \n <br> \nBlack bullhead were not sampled in gill nets or trap nets in 2007.  Trap net catch rates have been low at Marion Lake since the 1981 assessment. <br> \n <br> \nA total of 13 largemouth bass were captured during spring night-time electrofishing, for a catch rate of 9.2/hour, indicating that a fair sized population was present.  The catch rate in 2003 was 17.7/hour.  In 2007, electrofished largemouth bass were 8.5-18.7 inches long averaging 12.8 inches.  Trap nets sampled 4 largemouth bass up to 19.1 inches in length.  Largemouth bass were 2-7 years old with 5 year-classes present. <br> \n</p>",

Electrofishing sampled 55 YWAE for a catch rate of 81.5/hour, suggesting a strong year class.  The 2018 YWAE average length was 7.6 inches, indicating that growth was fast for this lake.  The latest Walleye stocking regime (520,000 fry every two out of three years) was initiated in 1995.  Fall electrofishing catch rates from 1994 to 2019 (n=24) ranged from 0.0 to 396.0/hour with an average of 44.5.  Catch rates from fry stocked years (n=15) ranged from 0.7 to 396.0/hour with an average of 65.4.  Catch rates from non-stocked years (n=9) ranged from 0.0 to 31.1/hour with an average of 9.8.  With an average that is over six times higher during stocked years, Walleye fry stocking is having a positive influence on YWAE abundance at Marion Lake.  However, a definitive answer cannot be reached because of the inability to differentiate stocked fish from naturally reproduced fish during years when Walleye fry are stocked.  Natural reproduction, during non-stocked years, was documented 8 out of 9 times (89%) at Marion.  None of the naturally reproduced YWAE year classes were considered strong, with the largest non-stocked year catch rate being 31.1/hour.  This suggests stocking is needed to maintain a quality Walleye fishery at Marion Lake.  Electrofishing sampled 0 YRLWAE for a catch rate of 0.0/hour, indicating that the 2018 year class was still weak (3.0/hour YWAE in 2018).  Age-0 Walleye were 6.4 to 9.7 inches long, while age-2 fish were 14.1 to 14.7 inches long.  </p>",

Growth rates in these fish is average for ages 1-3 and slightly below average for older ages.  Abundance of walleyes is considerably greater than local averages.  Gillnet catch rates for walleye 23.3 per set: or 6.3 times local values.  Northern pike are average in abundance and growth rates.  Ages I - III were represented.  Age I northern Pike made up 69% of the sample.  Yellow perch population are twice local values.  This represents a considerable drop in yellow perch from previous surveys.  The median length of yellow perch was 7.7 inches.  Largemouth bass catch rates have also dropped to below local values.  This probably is not representative of the status of largemouth bass, however: as largemouth bass are still regularly taken by fishermen.  Bluegills are abundant with normal growth rates.  Trap net catch rates of 64.75 are 4.1 times the local values.  About 96% of the bluegills sampled were ages I - IV.  Median length of bluegills was 6.2 inches.  Channel catfish population is also well represented at 11.3 per gillnet set.  This is well above local values.  Lengths of channel catfish were 13 to 18 inches.  Catfish between 16 and 20 pounds were reported by fishermen, which were larger than fish sampled by this survey.  Other species sampled at insignificant levels were hybrid sunfish, black crappies, black bullheads and carp.\n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A full resurvey was conducted at Marion Lake in McLeod County with netting begining on 8/04/03.  Spring nighttime electrofishing (EF), targeting largemouth bass, was conducted on 5/22/03.  Trotlines were also set during the week of netting, targeting channel catfish.  Marion Lake is 594 acres and has a maximum depth of 12 feet.  Aquatic vegetaion was sparse during the 2003 survey due to the lakes turbid nature.  A public access is located on the northeast side of the lake.  A fishing pier can be found in the county park on the eastern shore.  During the winter, an aeration system is operated to reduce the frequency and severity of winterkill.  Marion Lake is primarily managed for bluegill, black crappie and walleye.Net catches in 2003 indicated that there were moderate numbers of bluegill in Marion Lake when compared to similar lakes around the state.  Bluegill were 3.0-7.5 inches long averaging 5.4 inches.  Unfortunately, only 3% of the trap net sample was 7 inches or longer.  Good numbers of black crappie were caught in the gill nets, with those fish ranging in size from 4.7-9.9 inches.  Approximately 78% of the gill netted black crappie were 8 inches or longer.  A total of 25 largemouth bass were sampled during EF, which matched the average catch rate (17.7/hour) for the five assessments conducted at Marion Lake between 1992 and 2003.  Largemouth bass were 7.1-19.0 inches long, averaging 10.8 inches.  The 2003 EF catch rate indicates that there are moderate numbers of bass at Marion Lake when to compared to other lakes in Meeker and McLeod Counties.  The walleye catch rate (2.6/net) indicated fair numbers of fish present when compared to similar lakes across the state, but when only Marion Lake catch rates were compared the population appeared to be below the historical average (10.0/net).  Walleye fry are stocked two-out-of-three years at Marion.  After ageing scales taken from walleye and comparing year class strengths, it appears that stocking may be having a positive effect on wallleye abundance.  Natural reproduction of walleye has been documented multiple times at Marion and this makes drawing any strong conclusions on the effectiveness of stocking difficult.  Walleye gill netted in 2003 were 9.0-24.2 inches long, averaging 15.0 inches.  Gill nets are traditionally used to measured walleye abundance, but in 2003 good numbers of walleye were also sampled in trap nets (1.6/net).  Trap netted walleye averaged 21.8 inches, with the longest fish being 27.3 inches.  A similar situation occurred with northern pike in 2003.  Gill nets sampled 69 northern pike, ranging in size from 17.1-28.3 inches, averaging 21.2 inches and this indicates that there are good numbers present.  Trap nets sampled a high number of pike also, which is fairly unusual, ranging in size from 18.4-35.8 inches.  Either way you look at it there are lots of pike to be caught, including some nice ones.  A total of 15 channel catfish were sampled by gill net, ranging in size from 9.2-28.4 inches.  Trotlines sampled larger channel catfish, averaging 26.9 inches with a maximum length of 32.7 inches.  Some of larger catfish were over 14 years old.  The heaviest catfish caught was 15.3 pounds.  Channel catfish yearlings are stocked every-other-year.  The current fishery appeared to be fair to good for most fish species.     </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Marion is located in McLeod County and consists of two separate basins connected by a culvert.  Combined acreage for both basins is 594 acres.  The north basin (178 acres) is shallow, with few areas deeper than 4 feet.  Fisheries' management on Lake Marion concentrates on the south basin (416 acres), which  has a greater maximum depth (12 feet) and is better able to maintain fish populations.  Lake Marion was chemically reclaimed several times, most recently in 1979.  An aeration system is in operation on the lake, which may help reduce winterkill frequency.  Because of the aeration system, caution is advised when traveling on the lake in the winter.   A fishing pier in the County Park and a shore fishing access on the lakes east shore along State Highway 15 provide opportunities for anglers without boats.  Camping is also available in the County Park.  Lake Marion supports a diverse fish population that includes bluegill, black crappie, channel catfish, largemouth bass, northern pike, walleye and yellow perch.  However, an abundance of aquatic vegetation may make angling difficult at times.  Panfish angling can be quite good and accounts for much of the angling pressure.  Bluegill populations are consistently high and good size fish are present.  Black crappie numbers fluctuate but some nice fish are usually available.  The present age structure of black crappie is dominated by young fish that should provide good angling over the next several years.        Largemouth bass angling can be very good, with good numbers and a wide size range of fish.   Northern pike can also provide good action.  The most recent survey had gillnet catch rates above the lake class median.  Many of the northern pike sampled were age 2 and had an average length of 22 inches.  Walleye are abundant also.  The most recent survey had gillnet catches of walleye that were well above the lake class median.  Average length of walleye sampled was 15 inches and fish up to 25 inches were taken.  Although the walleye population is maintained through stocking, sampling suggests that natural reproduction occurs.  Channel catfish have been stocked in Lake Marion and can grow to a large size and provide a bonus to anglers.  Channel catfish over 10 pounds have been sampled.  The best angling for these fish usually occurs in the evenings in mid-summer.  A shore fishing access area on the east shore and a fishing pier in the county park are good places to try.                                    </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Marion is a moderate sized lake (520 acres) located south of the City of Hutchinson in McLeod County. It has 6.7 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of fifteen feet. A state-owned public access with a cement boat ramp and a good amount of parking is present on the east shore. A fishing pier is present at the Lake Marion Regional Park. A state-owned shore fishing area is present on the lake's southeastern shore. Water clarity is typically poor and aquatic vegetation is often sparse in abundance at Marion. A Targeted Survey (Spring Trap Netting) was conducted during May 2023. Trap nets were used to target Black Crappie and Bluegill.  <br> \n <br> \nVery low numbers of Bluegill were collected, and fish averaged 8 inches in length. The longest Bluegill captured was 10.1 inches. While catch rates will not be high for anglers, there is potential for a trophy. Marginal habitat (low amounts of submergent vegetation) is a limiting factor for Bluegill at Marion Lake. <br> \n <br> \nHigh numbers of Black Crappie were collected, averaging 9.5 inches in length. The longest Black Crappie collected was just over 14 inches. Approximately 71% of the Black Crappie sampled were 9 inches or longer, indicating that good numbers of keeper-sized fish were present.  <br> \n <br> \nPeople can have significant impacts on lakes and the fish populations they support. Over harvest, lakeshore development, removal of shoreline vegetation, and introductions of invasive species can all adversely affect fish populations. Aquatic invasive species (AIS) are typically moved from infested to non-infested waters by anglers, boaters and lakeshore owners, and can adversely impact lakes and fish populations. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants and animals from their watercraft and drain all lake water from their boat and bait buckets before leaving the lake. If you suspect an infestation of an invasive species in this lake, save a specimen and report it to a local DNR office.  Additional information on all of these topics can be found on the DNR website (www.dnr.state.mn.us) or by contacting the Hutchinson Area Fisheries office. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Marion is a moderate sized lake (520 acres) located near the City of Brownton in McLeod County. A large county-owned access with a single cement boat ramp is present on the northeast shore. Marion has almost 7 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 15 feet. A fishing pier is located at the county park on the eastern shore. A state-owned shore fishing area on the lake's southeast side is another popular place to angle. The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MNDNR) has divided Minnesota's lakes into 44 different classes based on physical and chemical characteristics. Marion is a class 42 lake and another similar lake in the Hutchinson Fisheries Management Area is Star Lake in Meeker County. An aeration system is operated during winter months to reduce the frequency and severity of winterkill at Marion Lake. Winter anglers are advised to stay far back from the open water and thin ice signs.   <br> \n <br> \nLake Marion is a classic shallow lake with little structure. The lake's turbid water makes it ideal for Walleye and the 2021 catch was extremely high this year, as it was in 2019. Walleye averaged 16 inches in length and maxed out at 29 inches this year, with many fish in the 14 to 20 inch length range. Trolling crankbaits or a bottom bouncer with a crawler are preferred methods but soaking a leech under a slip bobber will also catch Marion's Walleye.  <br> \n <br> \nCrappie were sampled in record high numbers in 2021. Many were small, but decent numbers of 8-to-13-inch fish were also present. It is tough to beat a crappie minnow under a bobber to catch a few of those good eating panfish.  <br> \n <br> \nDecent numbers of Yellow Perch were sampled and a few even reached 9 inches in length, but most were small. Channel Catfish are also present for anglers seeking this species. The longest catfish sampled in 2021 was 27 inches in length.  <br> \n <br> \nAnglers may also expect to get a few Northern Pike while fishing Marion. Their numbers were up from the 2019 survey, with the average pike measuring 22 inches and maximum length being 32 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nOther species that anglers may encounter include Black Bullhead, Bluegill, Common Carp, Largemouth Bass, and Yellow Bullhead.   <br> \n <br> \nPeople can have significant impacts on lakes and the fish populations they support. Overharvest, lakeshore development, removal of shoreline vegetation, and introductions of invasive species can all adversely affect fish populations. Aquatic invasive species (AIS) are typically moved from infested to non-infested waters by anglers, boaters and lakeshore owners, and can adversely impact lakes and fish populations. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants and animals from their watercraft and drain all lake water from their boat and bait buckets before leaving the lake. If you suspect an infestation of an invasive species in this lake, save a specimen and report it to a local DNR office.  Additional information on all of these topics can be found on the DNR website (www.dnr.state.mn.us) or by contacting the Hutchinson Area Fisheries office.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>STATUS OF THE FISHERY:\nMarion is a lake class 42 Lake and net catch data was compared to similar lakes around the state.  Important gamefish species captured in the nets included northern pike, channel catfish, bluegill, largemouth bass, black crappie, yellow perch and walleye.  Northern pike were abundant, with a gillnet catch of 7.3/net.  This ranks above the normal range for the lake class.  Nearly 85% of the northern pike were age 2, with few older fish.  Northern pike growth was good.  Many of the age 2 fish were 20 to 26 inches long.  Channel catfish numbers appear to be high.  The gillnet catch of 4.9 per net compares favorably to what would be expected of other large predators.  More than 75% of the channel catfish were age 7 or older.  Bluegill were abundant, with trapnet catches of 62/net.  This ranks above the normal range for the lake class.  Many age classes were represented in the sample, indicating stable reproduction.  Many of the bluegill are above 6 inches in length and should be acceptable to anglers.  Lake Marion does receive high fishing pressure for bluegill.  However, few fish were over 7 inches in length.  High fishing pressure may limit recruitment of bluegill to larger sizes.  Black crappie numbers in both gillnet and trapnets were within the normal range for the lake class.  Age 1 and 2 fish accounted for 75% of the black crappie sample.  Most of the crappie were less than 8 inches in length.  Yellow perch numbers were low at 3/gillnet.  This was below the normal range for the lake class.  Although yellow perch through age 5 were represented in the sample, none were larger than 8 inches long.  The low yellow perch numbers may be a result of predator abundance.  Walleye numbers were approximately twice the median value for gillnets and trap nets, but still within the normal range.  Walleye of age 2 through 7 were present in the sample.  Lake Marion has been stocked with walleye fingerlings and fry on an alternating basis.  Both methods appear to have been successful, with walleye numbers being evenly distributed over several age classes and stocking methods.  Natural reproduction has not been evaluated and its influences on walleye age class strength are not known.  Fall electrofishing was conducted in 1992 to try to begin to assess stocking and natural reproduction effects.  During the fall electrofishing, walleye and largemouth bass were collected.  Age 0 walleye were collected during the sampling.  These may have been the result of a spring fry stocking.  Fall electrofishing will be done again in 1993 to look for young of the year fish (no fry stocking scheduled).  Largemouth bass were collected at a rate of 4/hour.  This compares to a spring electrofishing catch rate of 15.1/hour.  Fall electrofishing may have been adversely affected by wind and resulting poor water clarity.  The spring electrofishing targeted largemouth bass only.  A total of 29 fish were captured, for a rate of 15.1/hour or 12.9/mile of shoreline fished.  This hourly catch rate was slightly below the median value (18.5/hour) of a total of 12 lakes sampled for largemouth bass in the spring of 1992.  \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A resurvey was conducted at Marion in 2010 to monitor the Lake's chemical, physical, and biological characteristics.  Near-shore seining and backpack electrofishing were conducted for a state-wide Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) initiative.  That analysis was done by Fisheries Research.  The number of gill nets set was reduced from 9 to 5, due to the high number of walleye being killed.  A commercial fishermen removed approximately 5,500 pounds of carp in May 2010.  An aeration system is operated during the winter to reduce the likelihood and severity of winterkill.  The lake was reclaimed with rotenone in 1979.  This normally eutrophic to hypereutrophic lake was unusually clear with a secchi disk reading of 5.6 feet on 8/9/2010.  Marion's lakeshed (4,730 acres) was dominated (79%) by row crop agriculture and residences made up the largest type of shoreline use (40%).  The lakeshed to lake ratio was 8:1.  All varieties of aquatic vegetation were ranked as rare, except for Filamentous Algae which was common.  All varieties of aquatic plants were rated as rare in 2003.  In the 1992 resurvey, several submergent varieties were classified as common or abundant.  All varieties of shoalwater substrates (sand, gravel, & rubble) were ranked as rare in 2010, except silt which was common.  The number of homes on the lake increased from 73 in 2003 to 77 in 2010.  <br> \n    <br> \nGill nets sampled 132 walleye for a catch rate of 26.4/net, which was above the normal range for this type of lake.  The 2010 catch rate was the second highest ever measured at Marion.  The 2007 catch rate was 9.6/net.  Walleye were 10.4 to 25.8 inches long averaging 13.4, in 2010.  Trap nets sampled walleye up to 26.2 inches in length.  Gill netted walleye were 2 to 15 years old with 9 year-classes present.  Age 2 (2008 year-class) fish made up the majority of the sample (78%) and averaged 11.9 inches at time of capture.  Approximately 7% of the aged fish corresponded with years when fry were not stocked, indicating that some natural reproduction was occurring.  The latest fry stocking regime (1,000/littoral acre two-of-three years) was initiated in 1995.  Catch rates from 2000 to 2010 (n=5) ranged from 2.6 to 26.4/net averaging 12.2.  Catch rates from 1969 to 1996 (n=8), under various stocking regimes, ranged from 0.0 to 36.6/net averaging 15.5/net.  In 2010, the growth rate of the strong 2008 year-class was slightly slower than the lake's historical average.     <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled 22 northern pike for a catch rate of 4.4/net, which was within the normal range for this type of lake.  The 2007 catch rate was 2.3/net.  Catch rates from 1969 to 2010 were variable ranging from 0.0 to 11.6/net averaging 5.3.  In 2010, northern pike were 14.3 to 32.2 inches long averaging 25.1.  Northern pike were young-of-the-year (YOY) to 5 years old with 6 year-classes present.  Age 2 fish made up 50% of the gill net sample.  Growth was moderate.   <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled 426 yellow perch for a catch rate of 85.2/net, which was above the normal range for this type of lake and the second highest catch rate ever measured at Marion Lake.  The 2007 catch rate was 3.0/net.  Catch rates (n=12) from 1969 to 2010 were highly variable ranging from 0.0 to 542.8/net averaging 60.9.  Yellow perch were 5.4 to 10.4 inches long averaging 7.9.  Approximately 11% of the gill net catch was 9 inches or longer.  Yellow perch were 1 to 3 years old with 3 year-classes present.  Age 2 fish made up 66% of the catch.  Growth was fast.  Standard shoreline seining sampled 5 YOY yellow perch. <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled 15 black crappie for a catch rate of 3.0/net, which was within the normal range for this type of lake.  The 2007 catch rate was 31.8/net.  Catch rates (n=13) from 1969 to 2010 ranged from 0.0 to 109.9/net averaging 21.8.  In 2010, black crappie were 5.9 to 11.3 inches long averaging 7.8.  Black crappie were 1 to 6 years old with 6 year-classes present.  Growth was moderate.  The trap net catch rate (4.1/net) was within the normal range for this type of lake.  The 2007 trap net catch rate was 3.4/net.  Catch rates from 1969 to 2010 (n=13) were highly variable ranging from 0.0 to 66.2/net averaging 13.7.  Trap netted black crappie were 2.5 to 11.4 inches long averaging 7.6.  Standard shoreline seining sampled 173 YOY black crappie. <br> \n <br> \nTrap nets sampled 21 bluegill for a catch rate of 2.3/net, which was within the normal range for this type of lake.  The 2007 catch rate (1.1/net) was also low.  Catch rates from 1969 to 2010 (n=13) were highly variable ranging from 0.0 to 91.2/net averaging 31.7.  In 2010, bluegill were 1.1 to 7.8 inches long averaging 5.1.  Trap netted bluegill were 1 to 3 years old with 3 year-classes present.  Growth was fast.  Shoreline seining collected 629 YOY bluegill.  Decreasing amounts of quality habitat (submergent vegetation) likely explains the decrease in abundance of bluegill in recent years. <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled 5 channel catfish for a catch rate of 1.0/net.  The 2007 catch rate was 4.3/net.  Catch rates from 1981 to 2010 (n=11) were variable ranging from 0.2 to 11.3/net averaging 3.8.  In 2010, channel catfish were 11.1 to 21.7 inches long averaging 17.4.  Channel catfish were 2 to 5 years old with 2 year-classes present.  Channel catfish stocking was discontinued following the 2006 fingerling stocking, when the production program was eliminated.  Presence of the 2008 year-class and 2 YOY captured during seining indicated that natural reproduction was occurring.     <br> \n  <br> \nSpring night-time electrofishing sampled 11 largemouth bass for a catch rate of 7.8/hr.  This was the lowest ever recorded at Marion Lake.  The catch rate in 2007 was similar at 9.2/hr.  Catch rates from 1992 to 2010 (n=7) were variable, ranging from 7.8 to 50.8/hr averaging 19.4.  The catch rates (n=5) from 1996 to 2010 indicated a downward trend for largemouth bass at Marion Lake.  Largemouth bass were 9.5 to 19.4 inches long averaging 13.6.  Largemouth bass were 2 to 10 years old with 5 year-classes present, indicating inconsistent recruitment.  Growth was moderate.  Standard shoreline seining sampled 1 YOY largemouth bass in late August.  The IBI seining in late June sampled 3,528 YOY largemouth bass.  Rarity of submergent vegetation likely explains the decrease in abundance of largemouth bass in recent years. <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled 4 carp for a catch rate of 0.8/net, which was within the normal range for this type of lake.  The 2007 catch rate was 1.2/net, sampling 11 fish.  Catch rates (n=13) from 1969 to 2010 were highly variable ranging from 0.0 to 18.5/net averaging 2.9.  Gill netted carp were 13.4 to 29.1 inches long averaging 21.7.  Trap nets sampled 17 carp for a catch rate of 1.9/net, which was within the normal range for this type of lake.  Catch rates (n=13) from 1969 to 2010 were variable ranging from 0.0 to 6.8/net averaging 1.4.  The 2007 catch rate was 0.6/net.  Trap netted carp were 15.6 to 31.1 inches long averaging 23.9.  <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled 2 black bullhead for a catch rate of 0.4/net, which was below the normal range for Marion's lake-class.  The 2007 catch rate (0.0/net) was also low.  Catch rates from 1969 to 2010 (n=13) were highly variable ranging from 0.0 to 190.5/net averaging 27.4.  In 2010, black bullhead were 10.4 to 11.2 inches long averaging 10.8.  Trap nets sampled 1 black bullhead (0.1/net).  The 2007 catch rate was 0.0/net.  Black bullhead have not been sampled in high numbers since the 1982 assessment (70.3/gill net). <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Marion is a moderate-sized lake (520 acres) located south of the City of Hutchinson in McLeod County. A county-owned access with paved parking and a single cement boat ramp is present on the northeast shore. There is a fishing pier present at the Marion Lake County Park on the east shore. A state-owned shore fishing area is present along State Highway 15 on the southeastern shoreline. Marion has approximately seven miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of fifteen feet. The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MNDNR) has divided Minnesota's lakes into 44 different classes based on physical and chemical characteristics. Marion is a class 42 lake and other similar waterbodies in the Hutchinson Fisheries Management Area are Star Lake in Meeker County and Otter Lake in McLeod County. Marion's 2021 lake management plan listed Walleye as primary management species, while Black Crappie and Yellow Perch were secondary species. An aeration system is typically operated during ice-covered months to provide a refuge area for fish during harsh winters. The most recent partial winterkill at Marion Lake occurred in 1984. Fish populations can fluctuate widely depending on the severity of the latest winterkill event. A Walleye jaw tagging exploitation study was initiated in the spring of 2023 (see separate targeted survey report for more details) and anglers are encouraged to call the Hutchinson Area Fisheries Office (320-753-0339) if they catch a tagged Walleye from Marion Lake. Netting was completed in 2023 to monitor the fish population. <br> \n <br> \nHigh numbers of Walleye were netted in 2023, and size was large. Walleye averaged 18 inches in length. The maximum length of Walleye sampled was just over 27 inches. An impressive 84% of the catch was 16 inches or longer. Ageing data indicated that natural reproduction of Walleye was substantial at Marion Lake. The oldest Walleye was age-15. Moderate numbers of Black Crappie were gill netted in 2023, and average size was impressive (10.3 inches in length). Approximately 85% of the gill net catch was 9 inches or longer. The longest Black Crappie gill netted was 13.8 inches in length. A spring panfish trap netting assessment was also completed at Marion in 2023, capturing high numbers of Black Crappie. Many of the spring survey crappie were over 9 inches in length and maximum length was 14.3 inches (see separate targeted survey report for more details). Very high numbers of Yellow Perch were gill netted and harvestable sized fish were present. Average length for gill netted perch was 7.0 inches. The longest perch sampled was 10.9 inches. Approximately 5% of the catch was 8 inches or longer. Yellow Perch play an important role as forage at Marion Lake. Unfortunately, this high amount of forage could lead to a tough Walleye bite for anglers.  <br> \nLow numbers of Northern Pike were gill netted this year with fish averaging 27.0 inches in length. Approximately 78% of pike netted were 24 inches or longer. Northern Pike regulations were revised at a statewide level beginning in 2018 to better accommodate regional differences in pike habitats, population abundances and size structures. Three management zones were established for Northern Pike, with their own bag limit and length limit restrictions. In the southern zone, where Marion Lake is found, anglers can keep two Northern Pike. The minimum size limit is 24 inches. All fish less than 24 inches must be immediately released. This zone regulation is meant to increase Northern Pike abundance and increase size of harvested fish.  <br> \n <br> \nAdditional fishes sampled in the 2023 gill nets included Black Bullhead and Common Carp.    <br> \n <br> \nPeople can have significant impacts on lakes and the fish populations they support. Overharvest, lakeshore development, removal of shoreline vegetation, and introductions of invasive species can all adversely affect fish populations. Aquatic invasive species (AIS) are typically moved from infested to non-infested waters by anglers, boaters and lakeshore owners, and can adversely impact lakes and fish populations. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants and animals from their watercraft and drain all lake water from their boat and bait buckets before leaving the lake. If you suspect an infestation of an invasive species in this lake, save a specimen and report it to a local MNDNR office. Additional information on all of these topics can be found on the MNDNR website (www.dnr.state.mn.us) or by contacting the Hutchinson Area Fisheries office.</p>",
