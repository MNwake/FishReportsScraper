                "narrative": "<p>Beaver Lake is a 65-acre, class 40 FiN lake that borders the cities of St. Paul and Maplewood.  Managed by Ramsey County, Beaver Lake County Park provides grills, playground, walking path, picnic shelter and tables, ample shorefishing, and a fishing pier.  The sport fish community consists of Black Crappie, Bluegill Sunfish, Channel Catfish, Hybrid Sunfish, Northern Pike, Pumpkinseed Sunfish, and Yellow Perch.  Fingerling and yearling Channel Catfish have been stocked every year from 1997 to 2009 (total number = 28,026 catfish) from 2012 -2014 another 6400 yearlings and in 2014 100 adults were stocked. Beaver Lake recently experience back to back winter kill events (2013 and 2014) with a severe event occurring in the winter 2013. The large predator community is still trying to recover from these 2 events.  <br> \nNorthern Pike and Channel Catfish provide anglers at Beaver Lake an opportunity to catch larger gamefish.  Northern Pike gill net catches stayed consistent the last 3 fish surveys (2000, 2005, and 2010) ranging from 5 to 6 pike/gill net but declined in 2015 to 1.5/gill net.  Gill netted pike averaged 21.6 inches and 2.24 lb. Beaver Lake has a history of providing a quality Largemouth Bass fishery however none were observed in any of the sampling gears during this survey. It is anticipated that Largemouth Bass adults will be stocked in 2016 to reestablish the Largemouth Bass community in Beaver Lake.   Channel Catfish have been a primary management species since 1997.  Two (2014 yearling stocking) channel catfish averaging 14.48 inches were sampled using gill nets.  Anecdotal angler information has revealed anglers were catching adult Channel Catfish prior to the winter of 2013, however many large dead catfish were observed after the recent winter kill events (2013-2014) and it appears that the large catfish are gone from the system at this time.   <br> \nPanfish numbers varied during 2015 fish survey.  Bluegill numbers (9.63/trap net) were down from 2010 survey (30.2/trap net).  Of the Bluegills (n=80) sampled using trap and gill nets, none were above 6.0 inches.   Black Crappie numbers are modest (4.5/gill net, 2.25/trap net).  Approximately 75% of the crappies sampled were 7.0 inches or longer, with one fish exceeding 10.0 inches. Yellow Perch numbers (25.5/gill net) are high and are an improvement from the 2005 gill net catch of 1.5/gill net.  Yellow Perch relative abundance ranged from 1 to 186 perch/gillnet in the 5 fish surveys prior to 2010 (1980, 1990, 1995, 2000, 2005, 2010).  The reestablishment of a decent Yellow Perch forage base should bode well for the predator populations of Beaver Lake. Other fish seen during this survey in low abundance were 3 Green Sunfish, 8 Pumpkinseed Sunfish, 1 Golden Shiner and 9 Black Bullheads.  <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

Current fisheries management consists of winter aeration and stocking of channel catfish and yellow perch on an annual basis.  Bluegill are stocked as needed.Black crappie were the most abundant fish caught during this assessment.  Most were small, with only 3.1% over 8 inches long.  Bluegill and pumpkinseed sunfish were present in average numbers with one-third of the fish over 6 inches long.  Yellow perch were caught in above average numbers, but below historic levels for this lake.  Less than one-fifth of the fish were 8 inches long or longer.Black bullhead numbers were the lowest ever for this lake.  One-fifth of the fish were at least 10 inches long.  Brown bullhead were present in average numbers with over half of the fish at least 10 inches long.Northern pike were caught in this lake for the first time since 1976.  Numbers were above average with several fish over 25 inches long.  Largemouth bass were sampled in average numbers.  A variety of sizes and ages were present, with the largest measuring 17.17 inches long.  Channel catfish were captured for the first time from this lake, with fish measuring 11.57-17.83 inches long.Golden shiner were abundant with all fish sampled measuring 6-9 inches.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Beaver Lake is a 65-acre, class 40 FiN lake that borders the cities of St. Paul and Maplewood.  Managed by Ramsey County, Beaver Lake County Park provides grills, playground, walking path, picnic shelter and tables, ample shorefishing, and a fishing pier.  The sport fish community consists of black crappie, bluegill, channel catfish, hybrid sunfish, largemouth bass, northern pike, pumpkinseed sunfish, and yellow perch.  Fingerling and yearling channel catfish have been stocked every year from 1997 to 2009 (total number = 28,026 catfish).  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike, largemouth bass, and channel catfish provide anglers at Beaver Lake an opportunity to catch large gamefish.  Northern pike gill net catches have stayed consistent the last 3 fish surveys (2000, 2005, and 2010) ranging from five to six pike/gill net.  Gill netted pike averaged 17.6 inches and 1.9 lb.  Sampled pike were essentially in two length groups: six pike were between 11 and 13 inches while five pike were between 22 and 26 inches.  Beaver Lake has a history of providing a quality largemouth bass fishery.  Two largemouth bass averaging 16 inches and 2.7 lb were caught in trap nets.  Channel catfish have been a primary management species since 1997.  Two age-6 (2004 yearling stocking) channel catfish averaging 16.9 inches were sampled using both gill and trap nets in 2010.  Anecdotal angler information has revealed anglers are catching adult channel catfish.   <br> \n <br> \nPanfish numbers varied during 2010 fish survey.  Bluegill numbers (30.2/trap net) were down from 2005 survey (86.0/trap net).  Of the 272 bluegills sampled using trap nets, approximately 63% were above 6.0 inches with no fish exceeding 7.5 inches.  Black crappie numbers were low (0.5/gill net, 0.9/trap net).  Approximately 75% of the crappies sampled were between 7.0 and 8.5 inches, with no fish exceeding 8.5 inches.  Similarly, yellow perch numbers (1.0/gill net) were low and consistent with the 2005 gill net catch of 1.5/gill net.  Yellow perch relative abundance ranged from 22 to 186 perch/gillnet in the four fish surveys prior to 2005 (1980, 1990, 1995, 2000).  The establishment of predator populations (largemouth bass and northern pike) may have led to decreases in perch numbers in 2005 and 2010.   <br> \n</p>",

Ramsey County Parks operates a park on the western shore of the lake that has parking, restrooms, picnic areas, a playground, a fishing pier and shorefishing structures. DNR Fisheries manages the lake for fishing, an aeration system operates most winters and yellow perch and northern pike are stocked as needed, while channel catfish are stocked annually.Bluegill were the most abundant fish in the 2005 netting survey. Most were small, with only 11.5% of the sampled fish over 6 inches and 1.2% over 8 inches. Black crappie numbers were low compared to previous surveys and only 2 of the 11 fish caught were over 8 inches long. Six yellow perch were sampled, and all were between 6 and 8 inches long.  Northern pike numbers were similar to the 2000 survey and appear to be a healthy population with fish sampled rangeing in age from Age I to VI. The average size was 18.8 inches with the largest measuring 24.7 inches. Largemouth bass were sampled in low numbers. However, one 20.5 inch long fish was sampled that was aged at over 12 years old. This fish probably was from the 1991 stocking of largemouth bass in Beaver Lake.Channel catfish were not captured during this survey. Based on the 2003 creel survey, they are surviving and growing. Anglers harvested them in low numbers and they were sampled during the 2000 lake survey.Black bullhead abundance was low relative to historical catch rates. </p>",
