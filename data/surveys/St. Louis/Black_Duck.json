THIS FOLLOWED WHAT APPEARED TO BE A RECOVERY, IN 1988, FROM A PREVIOUS LOW IN 1985.  IN 1990, A SINGLE YEAR CLASS, FROM 1987, DOMINATED THE ASSESSMENT CATCH. THE 1985 AND 1986 YEAR-CLASSES, WHICH SHOWED GOOD RECRUITMENT IN 1988, HAD ALL BUT DISAPPEARED FROM THE CATCH IN 1990.  GROWTH OF WALLEYE IN 1990 WAS SIMLIAR TO THAT OF 1988. ALTHOUGH YELLOW PERCH INDICES OF ABUNDANCE DECREASED FROM 1988 (E.G. 91 FISH/GILLNET IN 1990 VS. 106 FISH/GILLNET IN 1988), VALUES WERE STILL H HIGHER THAN THOSE IN 1985 (64.5 FISH/GILLNET). YELLOW PERCH PSD INCREASED FROM 31% IN 1988 TO 83% IN 1990.  YELLOW PERCH PSD IN THIS LAKE HAS BEEN UNSTABLE IN THE PAST, AND MAY BE RELATED TO THE UNFAVORABLE POPULATION STRUCTURE AND ABUNDANCE OF YELLOW PERCH AND WALLEYE.  PERCH REPRODUCTION WAS GOOD IN 1990. YOY CAUGHT IN SEINES INCREASED FROM AN AVERAGE OF 6 FISH/HAUL IN 1988 TO 124 FISH/HAUL IN 1990, A LEVEL SIMILAR TO THOSE OBSERVED PRIOR TO STOCKING OF NORTHERN PIKE IN 1984 AND 1985. NORTHERN PIKE INDEX OF ABUNDANCE INCREASED FROM APPROXIMATELY 1 FISH/GILLNET IN 1988 TO 1.75 FISH/GILLNET IN 1990, STILL DOWN FROM THE HIGH OF 6 FISH/GILLNET IN 1985, FOLLOWING STOCKING. INDICES OF WHITE SUCKER ABUNDANCE WERE ABOUT THOSE OBSERVED IN 1988. PUMPKINSEED SUNFISH INDEX OF ABUNDANCE DECREASED SHARPLY FROM A HISTORICAL HIGH OF 10.83 FISH/TRAPNET IN 1988 TO A HISTORICAL LOW OF 0.83 FISH/TRAPNET IN 1990. VERY NUMEROUS SMALLMOUTH BASS YOY WERE OBSERVED PASSING THROUGH SEINES.</p>",

Individuals up to 26.9 inches were sampled with the average length measuring 13.7 inches.  Two strong year classes from 1994 and 1996 made up the bulk of walleyes sampled with growth slower than the state index.  Northern pike numbers were low, however, with fast growth, the average length was 23.8 inches and fish over 30 inches were present.  A large population of young smallmouth bass were sampled in the spring of 1998.  Average length was 6.1 inches with only a few fish over 12 inches captured.  Bluegill numbers increased dramatically from past investigations, however, the current level of abundance was typical for this type of lake.  Average bluegill length was 7.1 inches accented by very rapid growth.  Yellow perch and white sucker catches remained above levels typically seen in this type of lake, while black crappie and pumpkinseed catches were about average.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Black Duck Lake is located approximately 10 miles north of the city of Orr. Black Duck is a productive class 5 lake with 1,250 surface acres and a maximum depth of 30 feet. Approximately 498 acres (40%) are less than 15 feet deep. Secchi depth during the 2022 survey was 10 feet, but the lake is prone to algae blooms that reduce clarity during the growing season. The outlet is the source of the Black Duck River, a tributary to the Ash River. There is a very diverse and healthy plant population, with both submergent and emergent vegetation. Boulder, rubble, gravel, and sand were the most common shoal water substrates. Excellent spawning habitat was reported for Walleye, Smallmouth Bass, and Bluegill. Centrarchids, Northern Pike, Walleye, White Sucker, and Yellow Perch represent the majority of a very diverse fish community. <br> \n <br> \nCurrent fishing regulations on Black Duck Lake for Walleye follows the statewide regulation. Northern Pike are in the Northeast Zone regulation. Black Crappie fishing regulation follows the statewide regulation. There is a special regulation reduced bag limit on Sunfish, which is set at a 10 fish daily limit. Smallmouth Bass fishing regulation are in the Northeast Zone regulation. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie trap-net catch rate was 1.7 fish per net, which was below average for similar lakes. Total length ranged from 3.9 to 13.9 inches and the mean length was 10.5 inches. Mean weight was 0.8 pounds, which was above average for similar lakes. A total of six year-classes were present, and ages ranged from 2-8 years. Black Duck Lake offers a good fishing opportunity with quality Black Crappie in the system.  <br> \n <br> \nBluegill trap-net catch rate was 2.3 fish per net which is well below average for similar lakes. Total length ranged from 3.8 to 9.4 inches and the mean length was 7.0 inches. Mean weight captured in trap nets was 0.4 pounds which was above average for similar lakes. A total of six year-classes were present, and ages ranged from 1 - 7 years. Black Duck Lake offers a good fishing opportunity with quality Bluegill in the system. <br> \n <br> \nNight electrofishing for Smallmouth and Largemouth Bass was not conducted in 2022 but will be conducted in spring 2023. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike gill net catch rate was 3.4 fish per net, which is above the average for similar class lakes. Catch rate was above the management goal of 3.2 fish per net for Black Duck Lake. Total length ranged from 19.3 to 35.1 inches and the mean length was 26.4 inches. Mean weight of Northern Pike captured in gill nets was 4.7 pounds which is well above average for similar lakes. Historically, growth rates for Northern Pike in Black Duck Lake have been some of the highest in the International Falls management area, which was true again in 2022. A total of five year-classes were present, and ages ranged from 1 - 7 years. Black Duck Lake offers good fishing opportunities for Northern Pike. With a lower density population there may not always be a fish on the line but there is a really good chances to catch Northern Pike in the mid-30\" range.   <br> \n <br> \nWalleye gill net catch rate was 7.8 fish per net which is above average for similar lakes. Catch rate was above the management goal of 5.0 fish per net for Black Duck Lake. Total length ranged from 7.8 to 28.8 inches and mean length was 16.4 inches. Average weight was 1.8 pounds which is above average for similar class lakes. A total of 13 year-classes were present, and ages ranged from 2-20 years. There are good numbers of Walleyes in Black Duck Lake, with the chance to catch Walleye over 26 inches. Black Duck Lake offers a good Walleye fishing opportunity.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch gill-net catch rate was 56.7 fish per net, which well above the average for similar lakes. Total length ranged from 2.7 to 12.9 inches and the mean length was 7.5 inches. Mean weight was 0.2 pounds, which is above average for similar lakes. Yellow Perch can offer an additional fishing opportunity but also offers great forage for Walleye and Northern Pike.  <br> \n</p>",

Black crappie, bluegill, northern pike, smallmouth bass, walleye, white sucker, and yellow perch are some of the species that are present in this very diverse fishery.  Early investigations of Blackduck Lake indicated an unbalanced fish community with low predator abundance and extremely high forage abundance.  Efforts to reshape the community have included northern pike and walleye stocking begining in 1956 and white sucker and yellow perch removal from 1965-1966.    <br> \n <br> \nIn 2007, black crappie trap-net abundance was 6.08 fish/set, which was well above most class 5 lakes.  Seven year-classes were present and age ranged from 1-7 years.  The 2005 year-class represented 79% of the sample.  Total length (TL) in trap nets ranged from 3.4-12.4 inches and the mean was 7.1.  Total length at age 4 was 9.1 inches; almost one inch greater than the area average of 8.2 inches.  The mean weight of black crappie captured in trap nets was below most class 5 lakes.  However, the mean weight in gill nets was above what is found in most class 5 lakes.   <br> \n <br> \nBluegill trap-net abundance was 8.25 fish/set, which was the second highest level recorded in Blackduck Lake.  Five year-classes were present and age ranged from 2-7 years.  The 2005 year-class composed 59% of the sample.  Total length in trap nets ranged from 3.2-8.9 inches and the mean was 5.0.  Total length at age 4 was 6.0 inches, which was greater than the statewide average of 4.7 for class 5 lakes.  The mean weight of bluegills captured in trap nets was well below what is found in most class 5 lakes.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike gill-net abundance was 5.83 fish/set, which was above most class 5 lakes.  Five year-classes were present and age ranged from 2-6 years.  Mean TL was 24.6 inches with a range from 18.7 to 36.8.  Historically, growth rates for northern pike in Blackduck Lake have been some of the highest in the International Falls management area, which was true again in 2007.  Total length at age 4 was 24.5 inches, which was almost one inch greater than the area average and much greater than the statewide median of 20.5 inches.  The mean weight of northern pike captured in gill nets was greater than what is found in most class 5 lakes. <br> \n <br> \nNight electrofishing was used to sample 603 smallmouth bass on May 31, 2007.  Smallmouth bass were sampled at a rate of 340 fish/hour of on-time, an increase from the 2002 rate of 222 fish/hour of on-time and similar to the 1998 rate of 348 fish/hour.  Mean TL was 8.3 inches in 2007 and remained similar to the mean length observed in 2002 (8.4 inches).  Total length ranged from 2.4 to 18.8 inches.  Ten year-classes were present and age ranged from 1-10 years.  Total length at age 4 was 8.1 inches, which was below the area average of 9.1 inches. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye gill-net abundance was 7.08 fish/set, which was above the median of 5.00 for class 5 lakes.  Nine year-classes were present and age ranged from 1-20 years.  All fish, except one, corresponded to years that were not stocked.  Total length ranged from 7.2-27.0 inches and the mean was 16.2.  Growth was similar to the area average, but slower compared to the previous population assessment.  Mean weight was 1.85 pounds, which was above most class 5 lakes. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch gill-net abundance was 41.17 fish/set, which was almost 3 times higher than what is found in 75% of the class 5 lakes.  Five year-classes were sampled and age ranged from 2-6 years.  Total length in gill nets ranged from 5.2-10.3 inches and the mean was 7.5.  Growth and mean weight were above average. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Blackduck Lake is located about 9 miles north of Orr, MN.  Yellow perch, white suckers, bass, panfish, and northern pike make up the majority of the very diverse fish community.  Early investigations of Blackduck Lake indicated an unbalanced fish community with low predator abundance and extremely high forage abundance.  Efforts to reshape the community have included northern pike and walleye stocking begining in 1956; and white sucker and yellow perch removal from 1965-1966.  Efforts to reshape the community have provided some positive benefits to the fishery, however, white sucker and yellow perch abundances in 2002 were the highest recorded since the removal project.   Black crappie trap-net abundance was 1.00 fish/set, which was below what was found in most lakes that have similar characteristics.  Conversely, gill-net abundance was 4.33 fish/set, which was much higher than what was found in similar lakes.  Five year-classes were present and age ranged from 2-6 years.  Length in trap nets ranged from 5.2-11.1 inches and the mean was 8.5.  Growth was faster than the average for other International Falls management area lakes.  Bluegill trap-net abundance was the second highest recorded in Blackduck Lake.  Five year-classes were present and age ranged from 2-7 years.  The 1998 year-class accounted for 82% of the sample.  Length in trap nets ranged from 3.7-9.4 inches and the mean was 6.0.  Growth was greater than the statewide average for this lake type.  Northern pike gill-net abundance was 2.67 fish/set, which was slightly below average for this lake type.  Seven year-classes were present and age ranged from 1-7 years.  The average length was 27.3 inches with a range from 7.6 to 40.4.  Historically, growth rates of northern pike in Blackduck Lake have been some of the highest in the International Falls management area, which was true again in 2002.  Length at age 4 was 28.2 inches, which was 4.5 inches greater than the area average and much greater than the statewide median of 20.5 inches.Night electrofishing was used to sample 249 smallmouth bass on June 03, 2002.  Smallmouth bass were sampled at a rate of 222 fish per hour of on-time, a decrease from the 1998 rate of 348 fish per hour.  Length ranged from 3.2 to 16.8 inches.  Ten year-classes were present and age ranged from 1-10 years.  Growth was slightly below the area average.Walleye gill-net abundance was 5.33 fish/set, which was average for this lake type.  Twelve year-classes were present and age ranged from 1-16 years.  Total length ranged from 7.2-27.5 inches and the mean was 17.4.  In 2002, average length at age 4 was 2 inches longer than what was found on average in other area lakes.  Average weight was 1.98 pounds.White sucker gill-net abundance was 20.17 fish/set, which was nearly twice as high as the previous investigation.  White sucker gill-net abundance has generally been higher than average when compared to similar lakes.    Yellow perch gill-net abundance was 109.58 fish/set, which was extremely high compared to similar lakes.  Six year-classes were sampled and age ranged from 3-8 years.  Length in gill nets ranged from 5.0-13.3 inches and the mean was 8.0.  Growth was average and mean weight was higher than most lakes of this type. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Black Duck Lake is located approximately 10 miles north of the city of Orr. Black Duck is a productive class 5 lake with 1,250 surface acres and a maximum depth of 30 feet. Approximately 498 acres (40%) are less than 15 feet deep. Secchi depth during the 2022 survey was 10 feet, but the lake is prone to algae blooms that reduce clarity during the growing season. The outlet is the source of the Black Duck River, a tributary to the Ash River. There is a very diverse and healthy plant population, with both submergent and emergent vegetation. Boulder, rubble, gravel, and sand were the most common shoal water substrates. Excellent spawning habitat was reported for Walleye, Smallmouth Bass, and Bluegill. Centrarchids, Northern Pike, Walleye, White Sucker, and Yellow Perch represent the majority of a very diverse fish community. <br> \n <br> \nCurrent fishing regulations on Black Duck Lake for Walleye follows the statewide regulation. Northern Pike are in the Northeast Zone regulation. Black Crappie fishing regulation follows the statewide regulation. There is a special regulation reduced bag limit on Sunfish, which is set at a 10 fish daily limit. Smallmouth Bass fishing regulation are in the Northeast Zone regulation. <br> \n <br> \nThis targeted spring nighttime electrofishing for Smallmouth Bass was conducted in 2023, as part of the completion of the standard survey conducted in 2022. Reported net catches were from the 2022 survey. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie trap-net catch rate was 1.7 fish per net, which was below average for similar lakes. Total length ranged from 3.9 to 13.9 inches and the mean length was 10.5 inches. Mean weight was 0.8 pounds, which was above average for similar lakes. A total of six year classes were present, and ages ranged from 2-8 years. Black Duck Lake offers a good fishing opportunity with quality Black Crappie in the system.  <br> \n <br> \nBluegill trap-net catch rate was 2.3 fish per net which is well below average for similar lakes. Total length ranged from 3.8 to 9.4 inches and the mean length was 7.0 inches. Mean weight captured in trap nets was 0.4 pounds which was above average for similar lakes. A total of six year classes were present, and ages ranged from 1 - 7 years. Black Duck Lake offers a good fishing opportunity with quality Bluegill in the system. <br> \n <br> \nSmallmouth Bass abundance was 233.4 fish per hour of On-Time, which was greater than the Black Duck Lake historic average of 231.3 fish per hour of On-Time. Total length ranged from 2.8 to 19.1 inches and the mean was 9.2 inches. Average weight was 0.3 pounds. Fourteen year classes were present, and ages ranged from 2-17 years. Black Duck Lake offers a good fishing opportunity with quality Smallmouth Bass in the system.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike gill net catch rate was 3.4 fish per net, which is above the average for similar class lakes. Catch rate was above the management goal of 3.2 fish per net for Black Duck Lake. Total length ranged from 19.3 to 35.1 inches and the mean length was 26.4 inches. Mean weight of Northern Pike captured in gill nets was 4.7 pounds which is well above average for similar lakes. Historically, growth rates for Northern Pike in Black Duck Lake have been some of the highest in the International Falls management area, which was true again in 2022. A total of five year classes were present, and ages ranged from 1 - 7 years. Black Duck Lake offers good fishing opportunities for Northern Pike. With a lower density population there may not always be a fish on the line but there is a really good chances to catch Northern Pike in the mid-30\" range.   <br> \n <br> \nWalleye gill net catch rate was 7.8 fish per net which is above average for similar lakes. Catch rate was above the management goal of 5.0 fish per net for Black Duck Lake. Total length ranged from 7.8 to 28.8 inches and mean length was 16.4 inches. Average weight was 1.8 pounds which is above average for similar class lakes. A total of 13 year classes were present, and ages ranged from 2-20 years. There are good numbers of Walleyes in Black Duck Lake, with the chance to catch Walleye over 26 inches. Black Duck Lake offers a good Walleye fishing opportunity.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch gill-net catch rate was 56.7 fish per net, which well above the average for similar lakes. Total length ranged from 2.7 to 12.9 inches and the mean length was 7.5 inches. Mean weight was 0.2 pounds, which is above average for similar lakes. Yellow Perch can offer an additional fishing opportunity but also offer great forage for Walleye and Northern Pike. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

Walleye up to 29.3\" long were sampled, with an average weight of 1.8 pounds.  A total of 10 age-classes were present in the sample, and a high catch of age-one walleye suggests the possibility of a strong 1994 year-class.  Northern pike abundance was average for a lake of this type, but growth rates were fast.  The largest northern pike measured was 35.5\" long, and weighed 12.0 pounds.  The average weight of all northern pike sampled was 3.6 pounds.  Black crappie and bluegill abundance remains low compared to similar lakes, while pumpkinseed were sampled in average numbers.  Abundance of yellow perch and white sucker was above average for lakes of this type.  A special effort was made to sample smallmouth bass by night electrofishing, and the high catch rates observed suggest a high density population.  Smallmouth bass up to 16.5\" long were sampled, with an average weight of 0.4 pounds.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Blackduck Lake is located about 9 miles north of Orr, MN. The lake is 1,185 acres and 42 percent is less than 15 feet deep.  Bass, northern pike, panfish, walleye, white sucker, and yellow perch represent the majority of a very diverse fish community.  Early investigations of Blackduck Lake indicated an unbalanced fish community with low predator abundance and extremely high forage abundance.  Efforts to reshape the community have included northern pike and walleye stocking beginning in 1956 and white sucker and yellow perch removal from 1965-1966.    <br> \n <br> \nIn 2012, black crappie abundance was third highest level ever observed in Blackduck Lake, but fell within the expected range for this lake type.  Only two year-classes were present and the 2010 year-class represented 90% of the sample.  The largest crappie captured in the 2012 fisheries investigation was 13.1 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nOverall, bluegill size and abundance were near the upper end of the expected range for this lake type.  The 2008 and 2010 year-classes were strong and represented 85% of the sample, which should provide great fishing and spawning stock in the near future. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike abundance was above average and size was well above average.  The mean weight of northern pike captured was 5.77 pounds, which was much greater than the top of the expected range (3.70 pounds) for this lake type.  The average length captured was 28.3 inches with a range from 22.5 to 37.8.  Historically, growth rates for northern pike in Blackduck Lake have been some of the highest in the International Falls management area, which was true again in 2012.  <br> \n <br> \nSmallmouth bass were abundant and should provide great fishing.  Fish up to 17.4 inches were caught and the average was 7.7 inches.  The average weight was about a half pound. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance was above the expected range for this lake type and the highest level observed in Blackduck Lake in several decades.  Ten year-classes were present and age ranged from 1-18 years.  The 2010 year-class represented 46% of the sample.  Length ranged from 7.2 to 26.9 inches and the average was 14.4.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch were extremely abundant; almost 7 times higher than the top of the normal range for this lake type.  Although, abundance was high in 2012, this level is not unheard of in Blackduck Lake and at times abundance has been much higher.  In 2012, size was generally small; the average size was less than 7 inches, but a few larger fish were captured (up to 10 inches).   </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Blackduck Lake is located about 9 miles north of Orr, MN. The lake is 1,250 acres and 40 percent is less than 15 feet deep.  Bass, Northern Pike, panfish, Walleye, White Sucker, and Yellow Perch represent the majority of a very diverse fish community.  Early investigations of Blackduck Lake indicated an unbalanced fish community with low predator abundance and extremely high forage abundance.  Efforts to reshape the community have included Northern Pike and Walleye stocking beginning in 1956 and White Sucker and Yellow Perch removal from 1965-1966.    <br> \n <br> \nIn 2017, Black Crappie abundance was below the expected range for this lake type.  Four year-classes were present and the age ranged from 2-6 years.  The largest crappie captured in the 2017 fisheries investigation was 12.8 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nBluegill abundance was below the expected range for this lake type.  Mean weight was within the expected range and the rate of growth was exceptionally fast.  The largest Bluegill captured during the survey was 9.9 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike abundance was within the expected range for this lake type.  The mean weight was 5.55 pounds, which was much greater than the top of the expected range (3.70 pounds) for this lake type.  The average length captured was 27.4 inches with a range from 16.4 to 38.2.  Historically, growth rates for Northern Pike in Blackduck Lake have been some of the highest in the International Falls management area, which was true again in 2017.  <br> \n <br> \nSmallmouth Bass were abundant and should provide great fishing.  Fish up to 18.4 inches were caught and the average was 8.0 inches.  The average weight was about a half pound. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance was above the expected range for this lake type and the second highest level observed in Blackduck Lake in several decades.  Length ranged from 7.3 to 28.0 inches and the average was 14.4.  Ten year-classes were present and age ranged from 1-15 years.  The 2013 year-class represented 37% of the sample and should continue to provide anglers with good Walleye fishing.    <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch were abundant; about 2 times higher than the top of the normal range for this lake type.  Although, abundance was high in 2017, this level is not unheard of in Blackduck Lake and at times abundance has been much higher.  In 2017, the average size was 7 inches and perch up to almost 12 inches were captured.   </p>",
