                "narrative": "<p>French Lake is an 816-acre lake located in Rice County northwest of Faribault. A DNR-maintained public access is located on the southeast side of the lake. The lake has a maximum depth of 56 feet with approximately 49% as littoral area. French Lake is considered eutrophic with generally poor water clarity and frequent algae blooms caused by elevated nutrient levels. Much of the shoreline has been altered for residential development, which negatively affects important nearshore fish habitat. French Lake is designated as an infested water body due to the presence of Eurasian Watermilfoil. The lake is primarily managed for Black Crappie, Bluegill, and Muskellunge and secondarily for Largemouth Bass and Walleye. The current management plan calls for stocking Muskellunge fingerlings annually at a rate of 1/littoral acre (n = 398). Currently Walleye fry are stocked at a rate of 1,000/littoral acre (n = 398,000) in even years.  <br> \n <br> \nFrench Lake is designated as a Tier-1 Lake and will be surveyed as part of a regularly scheduled monitoring program at a frequency of every 3 years. The 2020 targeted survey was completed the week of August 10, 2020 using 8 gill nets. Trap nets and spring boat electrofishing targeting Largemouth Bass were not completed due to COVID-19 restrictions. Water quality parameters were also measured. Results from this survey can be compared to historical standard surveys because standardized methods were used. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappies were abundant in 2020 with a total of 224 sampled with gill nets for a catch rate of 28.0/net, indicating high numbers were present. Since 1993, catch rates have varied from 21.2/net to 97.1/net with an average of 50.2/net. The previous catch rate in 2017 was 67.1/net. Lengths ranged from 4.0 to 12.7 inches with an average of 5.8 inches. Approximately 29% of the sample exceeded 8 inches in length and 8% exceeded 10 inches in length. Ages ranged from 1 to 9 years old with 7 year classes present. Over 93% of Black Crappies sampled were 1 or 2 year old fish. Growth was moderate with 8 inches exceeded by year 4 and 10 inches by year 5. Black Crappies are likely the most commonly targeted and harvested species in French Lake and the presence of two large young year classes in the 2020 survey should help support the fishery in coming years. <br> \n <br> \nOnly two Bluegills measuring 5.9 and 9.2 inches long were captured with the gill nets. Typically, Bluegills are better sampled with trap nets. <br> \n <br> \nA single large Muskellunge was caught and released without measurement in 2020. Historically, few are sampled with standard survey gill nets. Since 1993, the average catch rate was just 0.4/net. Targeted large-frame trap nets are used during the spring spawning season to assess the French lake Muskellunge population. The last such assessment occurred in 2017. <br> \n <br> \nNo Largemouth Bass were sampled with the gill nets in 2020. Again, due to COVID-19 restrictions, spring boat electrofishing was not completed as planned. <br> \n <br> \nTwo Walleyes measuring 16.0 and 16.1 inches were sampled in 2020 for a catch rate of just 0.3/net, indicating low numbers were present. This was easily the lowest catch rate since 1993 when catch rates varied from 0.3/net to 4.9/net with an average of 2.6/net. This was also the fourth consecutive survey since 2007 with declining Walleye catch rates. The fish were 5 and 6 years old and coincide with fingerlings and yearlings stocked in 2015. Future assessments will determine whether the switch to stocking Walleye fry starting in 2018 was successful or not, but to this point, Walleyes have proven to be difficult to manage at a high level in French Lake. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike were also sampled in very low numbers in 2020. Two Northern Pike measuring 21.7 inches and 33.8 inches were sampled for a catch rate of 0.3/net. They were 2 and 5 years old and growth was fast. French Lake is located in the Southern Northern Pike management zone. In order to harvest a Northern Pike the fish must be over 24.0 inches in length.  The daily bag limit in this zone is 2 Northern Pike per day. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch were the most abundant fish species in the 2020 survey with a total of 284 sampled with the gill nets for a catch rate of 35.5/net, which exceeded the lake class third quartile (27.9/net). Catch rates have varied from 12.0/net to 149.7/net with a mean of 42.7/net since 1993. The previous catch rate was 19.9/net in 2017. Lengths in 2020 ranged from 5.1 inches to 10.1 inches with a mean of 6.9 inches. Fish were age-1 to age-8 with 8 year classes present. The vast majority were either age-1 or age-2. Growth was moderate with quality size of 8 inches reached by around age-4. The French Lake Yellow Perch population provides a high quality prey base for predator game species and only rarely a harvestable target for anglers. <br> \n <br> \nFreshwater Drum were sampled at a rate of 7.8/net, indicating moderate to high numbers were present. This was the highest catch rate recorded from 1993-2020. During that time, catch rates have varied from 2.3/net to 7.8/net with an average of 3.6/net. Lengths ranged from 7.8 inches to 19.8 inches with an average of 12.7 inches. Freshwater Drum are often caught by anglers while targeting other species. For the open-minded angler, they offer an additional fishing target and are surprisingly good table fare. <br> \n <br> \nNo Black or Yellow Bullheads were sampled in 2020. Since 1995, both species have remained at almost undetectable levels in French Lake. <br> \n <br> \nOnly 3 Common Carp were sampled in 2020. Historically Common Carp are present but rare in French Lake fish surveys. Although detrimental to fish habitat and lake water quality, they likely do not negatively impact French Lake in any meaningful way due to their low numbers in the lake. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled in 2020 include Golden Shiner, White Bass, and White Crappie. <br> \n <br> \nWater clarity was poor with a secchi depth of just 2.0 feet. Dissolved oxygen and water temperature readings ranged from 6.7 ppm and 73.2 degrees Fahrenheit at the surface to 0.1 ppm and 65.1 degrees Fahrenheit at 27 feet. A thermocline was detected between 20 and 21 feet. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers can play an important role in maintaining or improving a fish population by practicing selective harvest. Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for consumption, while encouraging the release of medium to large fish that may contribute to natural reproduction. This practice helps maintain balance in the fish populations and provides anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future. Additionally, smaller fish often taste better and have fewer contaminants than larger, older fish from the same water body. <br> \n <br> \nShoreline property owners also play an important role in the overall health of an aquatic ecosystem, including the fish population. Natural shorelines, including vegetation, woody debris, and bottom substrates, provide valuable habitat for fish and wildlife, help maintain water quality, and reduce bank erosion. Cattails and bulrushes are particularly beneficial for fish spawning, rearing, and feeding. By leaving natural shorelines unaltered or restoring them to natural conditions, shoreline property owners are doing their part to maintain or improve a healthy ecosystem in the lake and protect the resource for future generations. <br> \n <br> \n- Sky Wigen, Fisheries Specialist <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>French Lake (816.0 acres) is located in Rice County near the Town of Faribault. Residential development has disturbed and altered the majority of French Lake's shoreline. In areas with residential development lawns are typically maintained to the water's edge and shorelines are altered with rock riprap or sand blankets, thereby disrupting the natural riparian buffer. A DNR owned access is located on the southeast corner of the lake but can be difficult to use when water levels are low due to the shallowness of the area. The sport fish community consists of Black Crappie, Bluegill, and Muskellunge which are the primary management species, and Walleye and Largemouth Bass, which are the secondary management species. Yellow Perch and Northern Pike are also present in French Lake but are not actively managed. Walleye and Muskellunge populations are maintained through stocking.  <br> \nA standard survey was conducted on 7 August 2023 to monitor fish populations in French Lake using 8 gill nets and 12 trap nets. Additionally, a targeted survey was conducted beginning 1 May 2023 to provide a Muskellunge population estimate. <br> \nFrench Lake has been designated a Waterville Management Area Tier-1 lake and will be surveyed every 3 years, including: spring day electrofishing to assess the Largemouth Bass population, fall night electrofishing to assess Walleye fry stocking, and spring targeted surveys in back-to-back springs every five years to assess the Muskellunge population. <br> \n <br> \nFrench Lake has historically produced quality Black Crappies. Since 1984, Black Crappie relative abundance has varied from 6.7/trap net in 1987 to 38.6/trap net in 1998. Relative abundance of Black Crappie in 2023 was the lowest on record at 2.6/trap net. Black Crappies were sampled effectively with gill nets and were captured at a rate of 17.8/gill net. Black Crappie scales and otoliths were used to estimate age and indicated the presence of 7 year classes in the French Lake sample (2015-2022). Age-3 (2020 year class) Black Crappies were the most abundant, accounting for 50% of Black Crappies sampled. Black Crappie size structure was small, indicative of a sample dominated by young fish (2020 year class). Black Crappie ranged from 4.3 to 13.0 inches and averaged 5.8 inches in gill nets. <br> \n  <br> \nBluegill relative abundance has been variable in French Lake ranging from 2.6/trap net in 1979 to 75.0/trap net in 2003. Bluegills were sampled at a rate of 16.8/trap net in 2023, which was lower than in 2017 (22.4/trap net). Bluegills ranged from 2.8 to 8.5 inches in length and averaged 5.9 inches in 2023. Six year classes of Bluegill were sampled in 2023 (2017-2022). Most Bluegills aged (45%) were from the 2020 year class (age-3). <br> \n <br> \nMuskellunge were sampled in low numbers during the 2023 standard survey. However, a successful targeted survey was conducted in the spring. Muskellunge relative abundance was 1.5/large trap net in 2023, compared to 0.9/large trap net 2022. Average length of Muskellunge sampled in 2023 was 39.3 inches and ranged from 29.0 inches to 49.5 inches. Population estimates from a mark-recapture study estimated 149 adult male Muskellunge and 58 adult female Muskellunge in the population. Muskellunge density in French Lake was approximately 0.25 adult fish per surface acre, or 1 fish for every 4 surface acres and falls within the range of average densities from ten lakes studied statewide in 2008 (0.13 to 0.35 fish/surface acre). <br> \n <br> \nWalleye relative abundance increased slightly from the 2020 survey, increasing from 0.3/gill net in 2020 to 0.6/gill net in 2023. Walleye ages were estimated using scales and otoliths. Two year classes of walleye were present (2021 and 2015 ). Although sample size was small, Walleye size structure was good. Walleyes ranged from 13.1 to 23.4 inches and averaged 20.7 inches in gill nets. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass are secondary management species on French Lake and were assessed using day-time electrofishing. Relative abundance of Largemouth Bass was 10.1/hour. Average length of Largemouth Bass sampled in 2023 was 12.7 inches and ranged from 5.6 to 16.7 inches. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike have historically been scarce in French Lake and the trend continued in 2023 with a relative abundance of 0.1/gill net. However, 9 Northern Pike we sampled using trap nets in 2023. All Northern Pike sampled in 2023 ranged from 9.1 to 36.3 inches in length. Seventy percent of all Northern Pike sampled exceeded the 24-inch minimum length limit. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch were sampled at a rate of 12.9/gill net in 2023. Yellow Perch exhibited small size structure, with no fish exceeding 10.0 inches. Yellow Perch ranged in length from 5.7 to 8.9 inches and averaged 6.7 inches. <br> \n <br> \nFreshwater Drum relative abundance has declined since its peak in 1979 (18.6/gill net). Relative abundance was 3.0/gill net in 2017 and had remained between 2.0/gill net and 4.0/gill net since 1994. However, in 2023, the relative abundance has increased to 16.4/ gill net. Freshwater Drum sampled with gill nets averaged 15.4 inches and ranged from 6.9 inches to 22.1 inches. Freshwater Drum sampled with trap nets averaged 20.2 inches and ranged from 14.2 inches to 24.0 inches. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Bullhead, Pumpkinseed and Golden Shiners were also present, but occurred in low numbers. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers can play an important role in maintaining or improving a fish population by practicing selective harvest. Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for consumption, while encouraging the release of medium to large fish that may contribute to natural reproduction. This practice helps maintain balance in the fish populations and provides anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future. Additionally, smaller fish often taste better and have fewer contaminants than larger, older fish from the same water body. <br> \n <br> \nShoreline property owners also play an important role in the overall health of an aquatic ecosystem, including the fish population. Natural shorelines, including vegetation, woody debris, and bottom substrates, provide valuable habitat for fish and wildlife, help maintain water quality, and reduce bank erosion. Cattails and bulrushes are particularly beneficial for fish spawning, rearing, and feeding. By leaving natural shorelines unaltered or restoring them to natural conditions, shoreline property owners are doing their part to maintain or improve a healthy ecosystem in the lake and protect the resource for future generations. <br> \n <br> \n-Tyler Fellows, fisheries specialist <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A full lake survey was conducted on French Lake, Rice County the week of August 13, 2007 to assess the fish community and aquatic habitat conditions.  The French lake fishery is managed for crappie, bluegill, muskellunge, walleye, and largemouth bass.  Stocking proposals include 600 muskellunge fingerlings annually, and 400 lbs of walleye fingerlings every 2 of 3 years. <br> \n <br> \nFrench Lake continues to support a healthy population of adult musky.  A separate spring assessment was conducted as they are better able to capture muskellunge than are summer assessments.  Population estimates suggest a stable population size and relatively good abundance when compared to other lakes.  Size distribution remains well balanced and includes good proportions of individuals exceeding 45 inches.  Maximum size continues to increase as two musky exceeding 53 inches were captured.  Despite the fisheries popularity with anglers the balanced size structure and increasing numbers of fish in excess of 45 inches suggest a low rate of exploitation. <br> \n <br> \nCrappie size has improved in size since the 2003 assessment.  More crappie 10 inches and larger were sampled including some 12 and 13 inch specimens.  Bluegill are still abundant but not many are over 7 inches and no 8 inch bluegill were observed. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike have historically been scarce in French, but the catch of about 2 per gillnet with an average length of 26 inches represents a population increase since the 2003 assessment.  Largemouth bass were not estimated to be in high numbers but some larger individuals are present. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch numbers are holding steady.  They, along with golden shiners and young freshwater drum are important forage species available to larger predators in French Lake.  Not represented in the August survey, but observed in the spring was a significant population of large bigmouth buffalo.  They, along with freshwater drum and common carp, represent a large fraction of the fish biomass in French Lake. <br> \n <br> \nWatershed land use is primarily agricultural.  The shoreline is largely lined with year-round or seasonal residences.  Improved watershed and shoreline management practices could improve the water quality and fish and wildlife habitat in the long-term. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>French Lake (816.0 acres; class 24) is located in Rice County near the Town of Faribault. Residential development has disturbed and altered the majority of French Lake's shoreline. In areas with residential development lawns are typically maintained to the water's edge and shorelines are altered with rock riprap or sand blankets, thereby disrupting the natural buffer. A DNR owned access is located on the southeast corner of the lake, but can be difficult to use when water levels are low due to the shallowness of the area. The sport fish community consists of Black Crappie, Bluegill, and Muskellunge which are the primary management species, and Walleye and Largemouth Bass, which are the secondary management species. Yellow Perch and Northern Pike are also present in French Lake, but are not actively managed. Walleye and Muskellunge populations are maintained through stocking. Walleye stocking will change from fingerling stocking three out of four years to fry stocking every-other-year (even years) beginning in 2018. Fry stocking will be assessed using fall night electrofishing. Muskellunge are stocked annually at a rate of 398 fingerlings per year. <br> \n <br> \nA standard survey was conducted on 7 August 2017 to monitor fish populations in French Lake using 8 gill nets and 12 trap nets. A standard survey is used for sampling a wide range of fish species during the summer months using standard methods (i.e. standard time of year, set sampling stations, taking water clarity readings and oxygen/temperature profiles, etc.) and gears (i.e. lake survey gillnets, trap nets, and spring electrofishing for Largemouth Bass). Future surveys will be conducted every 3 years, including: spring day electrofishing to assess the Largemouth Bass population, fall night electrofishing to assess Walleye fry stocking, and spring targeted surveys in back-to-back springs every five years to assess the Muskellunge population. <br> \n <br> \nFrench Lake has historically produced quality Black Crappies. Since 1984, Black Crappie numbers have varied from 6.7/trap net in 1987 to 38.6/trap net in 1998. Catch of Black Crappies in 2017 was high at 36.3/trap net and was an increase from 2012 catch (30.9/trap net). Black Crappies were also sampled very effectively with gill nets (67.1/gill net). Eight year classes were present in the French Lake sample (2008, 2010-2016). One year-old (2016 year class) Black Crappies were the most abundant, accounting for 87% of Black Crappies sampled. Black Crappie size structure was small, indicative of a sample dominated by young fish (2016 year class). Black Crappie ranged from 4.3 to 12.4 inches and averaged 6.0 inches in gill nets. Trap nets sampled slightly larger Black Crappies that ranged from 4.8 to 12.1 inches and averaged 7.3 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nThe Bluegill population has been variable in French Lake ranging from 2.6/trap net in 1979 to 75.0/trap net in 2003. Bluegills were sampled at a rate of 22.4/trap net in 2017, which was lower than in 2012 (30.8/trap net). Bluegills ranged from 2.9 to 8.5 inches in length and averaged 5.6 inches in 2017, compared to 5.9 inches in 2012. Only three year classes of Bluegills were sampled in 2017 (2010, 2012-2013). However, young Bluegill were abundant in the near-shore seines, which will hopefully translate to a successful year-class in 2017. The majority of Bluegills aged (87%) were from the 2013 year class (age-4). <br> \n <br> \nMuskellunge were sampled in low numbers (n=2) during the 2017 standard survey. However, a successful targeted survey was conducted in the spring. Muskellunge were sampled at a rate of 1.8/large trap net in 2017, compared to 1.1/large trap net in 2016. Mean length of Muskellunge sampled in 2017 was 41.3 inches and ranged from 18.5 inches to 50.8 inches. There were an estimated 104 adult male Muskellunge, 84 adult female Muskellunge, and 10 adult Muskellunge of unknown gender in the population in 2016-2017. Muskellunge density in French Lake was approximately 0.25 adult fish per surface acre, or 1 fish for every 4 surface acres and falls within the range of average densities from ten lakes studied statewide in 2008 (0.13 to 0.35 fish/surface acre). <br> \n <br> \nWalleye catch decreased slightly from the 2012 survey, dropping from 3.3/gill net in 2012 to 1.9/gill net in 2017, but still was within the long term range of catch rates (0.6 to 6.0/gill). Four year classes of Walleye were present (2013-2016). Although sample size was small, Walleye size was good. Walleyes ranged from 12.1 to 22.1 inches and averaged 16.8 inches in gill nets. Walleye growth was fast in French Lake as fish averaged 14.0 inches at age-2 and 16.5 inches at age-3. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass were assessed using day-time electrofishing. Largemouth Bass were caught at a rate of 34.1/hour, which was greater than the 2004 survey (10.0/hour). The average length of Largemouth Bass sampled in 2017 was 8.6 inches and ranged from 3.8 to 17.0 inches. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike have historically been scarce in French Lake and the trend continued in 2017 with only 1.7 caught per gill net. Northern Pike sampled with gill nets ranged from 18.4 to 39.6 inches in length. Only 8% of Northern Pike sampled were greater than 24 inches long. Northern Pike are not stocked in French Lake, any Northern Pike present are a result of natural reproduction or immigration. <br> \n <br> \nThe 2017 Yellow Perch catch (19.9/gill net) decreased from 2012 (23.0/gill net). Five year classes (2010, 2013-2016) were sampled, with age-3 and age-4 fish representing 75% of Yellow Perch. Yellow Perch were generally small, with no fish exceeding 10.0 inches. Yellow Perch ranged in length from 5.6 to 9.8 inches and averaged 7.6 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nFreshwater Drum catch has declined since its peak in the mid to late 1970s. Freshwater Drum were caught at a rate of 3.0/gill in 2017. Freshwater Drum sampled with gill nets averaged 14.1 inches total length and ranged from 8.6 inches to 22.1 inches. Freshwater Drum sampled with trap nets averaged 18.6 inches total length and ranged from 12.3 inches to 23.4 inches. <br> \n <br> \nPumpkinseed and Golden Shiners were also present, but occurred in low numbers. <br> \nAnglers can play an important role in maintaining or improving a fish population by practicing selective harvest. Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for consumption, while encouraging the release of medium to large fish that may contribute to natural reproduction. This practice helps maintain balance in the fish populations and provides anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future. Additionally, smaller fish often taste better and have fewer contaminants than larger, older fish from the same water body. <br> \n <br> \nShoreline property owners also play an important role in the overall health of an aquatic ecosystem, including the fish population. Natural shorelines, including vegetation, woody debris, and bottom substrates, provide valuable habitat for fish and wildlife, help maintain water quality, and reduce bank erosion. Cattails and bulrushes are particularly beneficial for fish spawning, rearing, and feeding. By leaving natural shorelines unaltered or restoring them to natural conditions, shoreline property owners are doing their part to maintain or improve a healthy ecosystem in the lake and protect the resource for future generations. <br> \n <br> \n-Brandon Eder, assistant area supervisor  <br> \n</p>",

BLUEGILL ARE REPRESENTED BY AGES 1-5 AND 7-8 WITH 2 AND 4 YEAR OLDS MOST ABUNDANT. BLACK CRAPPIE TRAP NET CATCH RATES INCREASED FROM 6.67 IN 1987 TO 20.91. BLACK CRAPPIE ARE DISTRI- BUTED FROM 3.5-10.4 INCHES WHICH IS FAVORABLE. AGES 1-5 WERE SAMPLED WITH 2-3 YEAR OLDS MOST ABUNDANT. WHITE CRAPPIE REMAIN LOW IN ABUNDANCE, AVERAGING 3.60/GILL NET COMPARED TO 1.40/GILL NET IN 1987. NORTHERN PIKE ABUNDANCE REMAINS STABLE, AVERAGING 3.40/GILL IN 1987 COMPARED TO 3.00/GILL NET. NORTHERN PIKE HAVE A FAVORABLE AGE DISTRIBUTION. WITH AGES 1-5 SAMPLED, WHICH INDICATES NORTHERN PIKE SUCCESSFULLY REPRODUCED IN THE LAKE DURING THE PAST 2 DROUGHT YEARS. WALLEYE CATCH RATES IMPROVED FROM 2.40/GILL NET IN 1987 TO 3.80/GILL NET. WALLEYE ARE REPRESENTED BY LARGE FISH WITH MANY 18.0-27.0 INCHES. WALLEYE SAMPLED DO NOT HAVE A STRONG CORRELATION WITH PAST STOCKING AND MAY BE ATTRIBUTED TO UNDER AGING THE 7 AND 8 YEAR OLDS AND POSSIBLE NATURAL REPRODUCTION. THE 1984 NETTING INDICATED RECRUIT- MENT FROM FRY STOCKED WALLEYE IN 1983. THIS SAME YEAR CLASS IS WELL REPRESENTED NOW AS 6 YEAR OLDS. MUSKELLUNGE SAMPLED IN 1987 WERE ALL RECENTLY STOCKED FINGERLINGS AVERAGING 2.00/TRAP NET. MUSKELLUNGE NOW AVERAGE 0.27/TRAP NET AND ARE REPRESENTED BY AGES 1-4 WITH 2 YEAR OLDS MOST ABUNDANT. SPRING NETTING IN 1989 CAPTURED 12 MUS- KELLUNGE IN TEN TRAP NETS THAT RANGED FROM 28.5- 35.5 INCHES. MUSKELLUNGE HAVE BEEN STOCKED ANNUALLY SINCE 1974. WHITE BASS IMPROVED FROM 0.60/GILL NET IN 1987 TO 3.10/GILL NET. WHITE BASS ARE FAST GROWING AND REPRESENTED BY LARGE FISH, 10.5-16.9 INCHES WHITE BASS SAMPLED ARE DOMINATED BY 5 YEAR OLDS WITH FEWER 2, 4, AND 6 YEAR OLDS. YELLOW PERCH HAVE DECLINED FROM 45.00/GILL NET IN 1987 TO 17.10/GILL NET, WHICH PROBABLY REFLECTS INCREASED PREDATION. YELLOW PERCH SIZE HAS DECLIN- ED WITH MOST FISH 5.0-6.9 INCHES. FRESHWATER DRUM AND BLACK BULLHEAD WERE SAMPLED IN MODERATE NUMBERS, AVERAGING 14.27/TRAP NET AND 11.27/TRAP NET RESPECTIVELY.

Game fish generally are of quality size, and it is the only designated muskie lake south of the metro area.  Bluegill abundance is slightly below average, but some fish over 8 inches were netted.  French Lake consistently produces large bluegills.  White crappie are few, but black crappie numbers are above average.  Black crappie are well distributed in size, and 30% of them are 9-11 inches.  Northern pike and walleye are not abundant, but size is good.  Anglers report that largemouth bass are moderately abundant and above average size.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>French Lake is situated in an agricultural watershed with small woodlots northwest of the city of Faribault in Rice County. Lakeshore development is moderate to intense.  French Lake is the only Muskellunge managed water in the nine county Waterville Fisheries Management Area and has been stocked with Muskellunge fingerlings since 1974.  Historically, French Lake was stocked with approximately 600 Muskellunge fingerlings of various strains, each fall.  Since 2014, French Lake has been stocked with 398 Leech Lake strain Muskellunge fingerlings annually. A decreased stocking rate serves several purposes including: decrease the cost of Muskellunge stocking in French Lake, provide more Muskellunge to be stocked in other Muskellunge managed waters throughout the state, and decrease the potential for growth reductions due to high abundance.  The stocking rate of 1.0 Muskellunge per littoral acre annually will be maintained at least until a more in-depth population assessment can be completed.   <br> \n <br> \nThe first phase of a two-year population assessment was conducted in April 2022. A total of 56 adult Muskellunge and 4 juvenile Muskellunge were sampled in 66 nets. Seventy-two percent of Muskellunge sampled were male, 23% were female, and 5% were of unknown gender.  <br> \n <br> \nThe average length of Muskellunge sampled in 2022 was 38.8 inches and ranged from 27.4 to 49.4 inches. The average length of Muskellunge appears to have leveled off and has hovered around 40 inches since 2002.  Maximum length appears to have reached its full potential in 2004 (54.0 inches) and has been near 50 inches in subsequent surveys.  Trophy length fish greater than 50 inches have always been rare in French Lake and only 3 have been sampled in each of the last three surveys.   <br> \n <br> \nMuskellunge sampled in 2022 were checked for tags as part of the recapture phase of the population estimate.  Eighteen Muskellunge were tagged and 35 Muskellunge were found with tags. Fourteen of the tagged fish found in 2022 were stocked in 2017 as fingerlings and fourteen were tagged as adults in 2016 or 2017.   <br> \n <br> \nManagement goals of more than 1 adult Muskellunge and Muskellunge over 50 inches present were not met during the 2022 survey. <br> \n <br> \n-Brandon Eder, assistant area fisheries supervisor <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>French Lake offers anglers a variety of good fishing opportunities for a variety of species.  Panfish such as bluegills and black crappies probably make up the majority of fish harvested from the lake.  Based on the results of the 1998 netting survey, black crappies were quite abundant with the average length of the crappies sampled in the trap nets being slightly less than 8 inches.  Bluegills were slightly less abundant and, as would be expected, somewhat smaller, averaging 6.7 inches in the trap nets.  Only a few bluegills over 8 inches and crappies over 10 inches were collected.  This likely indicates that anglers are keeping many of the larger panfish that they catch.     French Lake also provides good fishing for larger fish like muskellunge and walleyes.  The average size of walleyes collected in the 1998 survey nets was just over seventeen and a half inches and three pounds.   French lake is the only Minnesota lake south of the Minneapolis - St. Paul area that is managed for muskellunge fishing.  Angler reports and spring netting efforts indicate that muskellunge over 50 inches long are present in French Lake.     French Lake is heavily used by lake shore residents and others.  Many human activities have the potential to directly or indirectly harm the fish community in French Lake.  Several \"cluster\" septic systems have been installed around the lake in recent years reducing the amount of nutrients that reach the lake.  Several steep and erosive fields near the lake have been planted with grass or trees to reduce the amount of sediment and nutrients getting to the lake.  Shoreline developments which affect the plants near the waters edge and in the lake can destroy valuable fish spawning or feeding areas.  While some aquatic plants, such as curled pondweed, can be a nuisance for human use of the lake at some times of the year, the same plants are part of the habitat or home of numerous fish.      </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>French Lake is an 816-acre (398 littoral acres), hypereutrophic lake situated in an agricultural watershed with small woodlots northwest of the city of Faribault in Rice County. French Lake is classified as a class 24 lake with a Shoreline Development Index of 1.17. Lakeshore development is moderate to intense.  French Lake is the only Muskellunge managed water in the nine county Waterville Fisheries Management Area and has been stocked with Muskellunge fingerlings since 1974.  Historically, French Lake was stocked with approximately 600 Muskellunge fingerlings of various strains, each fall.  Since 2014, French Lake has been stocked with 398 Leech Lake strain Muskellunge fingerlings annually. A decreased stocking rate serves several purposes including: decrease the cost of Muskellunge stocking in French Lake, provide more Muskellunge to be stocked in other Muskellunge managed waters throughout the state, and decrease the potential for growth reductions due to high abundance.  The stocking rate of 1.0 Muskellunge per littoral acre annually will be maintained at least until a more in-depth population assessment can be completed.   <br> \n <br> \nThe second phase of a two-year population assessment was conducted in May 2023.  Large-frame trap nets were used to sample adult Muskellunge beginning on 1 May 2023 and ending on10 May 2023.  A total of 83 adult Muskellunge was sampled in 54 nets for a catch-per-unit-effort of 1.5 Muskellunge per net night.  Seventy-two percent (n = 60) of Muskellunge sampled were male and 28% (n = 23) were female. Muskellunge CPUE of 1.5 per trap night exceeded the management goal of at least 1 Muskellunge per trap night. <br> \n <br> \nThe average length of Muskellunge sampled in 2023 was 39.3 in and ranged from 29.3 in to 49.5 in. The management goal of fish greater than 50 in present was not met.  Average length of Muskellunge appears to have leveled off and has hovered around 40 inches in each survey since 2002.  Maximum length appears to have reached its full potential in 2004 and has been near 50 inches in subsequent surveys.  Trophy length fish have always been rare in French Lake and no fish over 50 inches were sampled in 2023. <br> \n <br> \nA population estimate was calculated following sampling in spring of 2023. We estimated 58 females and 149 males over 30 inches were present in French Lake in 2022. Also, there is strong evidence that large fingerlings had much higher probabilities of survival to 2022-2023 than small fingerlings. Future management goals should include an acceptable population range based on target Muskellunge density. <br> \n <br> \n-Brandon Eder, assistant area supervisor <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>French Lake (816.0 acres; class 24) is located in Rice County near the Town of Faribault. Residential development has disturbed and altered the majority of French Lake's shoreline. In areas with residential development, lawns are typically maintained to the water's edge and shorelines being altered with rock riprap or sand blankets, thereby disrupting the natural riparian buffer. A DNR owned access is located on the southeast corner of the lake, but can be difficult to use when water levels are low due to the shallowness of the area. The sport fish community consists of black crappie and bluegill, which are the primary management species, and walleye, muskellunge, and largemouth bass, which are the secondary management species. Walleye and muskellunge populations are maintained through stocking. Walleye fingerlings are stocked at a rate of 1 lb/littoral acre in 2 out of 3 years (2003, 2004, 2006, 2007, 2009, 2010, and 2012). Muskellunge are stocked annually at a rate of 600 fingerlings per year. A population assessment was conducted on 8-6-2012 to monitor the sport fish populations in French Lake using 8 gill nets and 12 trap nets.  <br> \n <br> \nA dissolved oxygen profile was taken on 8-6-2012 and ranged from 6.2 ppm at the surface to 0.6 ppm at 25.0 ft deep. Thermal stratification of the water column occurred between 16.0 and 18.0 ft of depth as indicated by a drop in temperature. <br> \n <br> \nFrench Lake has historically produced quality black crappies. Since 1984, black crappie catch rates have varied from 6.7/trap net in 1987 to 38.6/trap net in 1998. The 2012 catch rate (30.9/trap net) fell within this range and was high when compared to similar lakes. Black crappies were also sampled very effectively with gill nets, and were captured at a rate of 55.1/gill net, which is also very high when compared to similar lakes. Seven year classes of black crappie were present in the French Lake sample (2005-2011). Age-2 (2010 year class) black crappies were the most abundant, accounting for 46% of black crappies sampled. Age-4 (2008 year class) black crappies were the second most abundant, accounting for 21% of black crappies sampled. The oldest black crappies sampled were age-7 (2005 year class). Black crappie size structure was good as lengths ranged from 4.2 to 12.7 inches and averaged 8.2 inches for trap netted crappies. Gill nets captured smaller black crappies as they ranged in length from 4.3 to 11.3 inches and averaged 6.9 inches. Data from the survey indicated good growth of black crappies in French lake as lengths averaged 5.0 inches at age-1, 6.8 inches at age-2, 8.4 inches at age-3, 9.5 inches at age-4, 10.4 inches at age-5, 11.4 inches at age-6, and 11.8 inches at age-7.  <br> \n <br> \nThe bluegill population has been variable in French Lake ranging from 2.6/trap net in 1979 to 75.0/trap net in 2003. The 2012 catch rate was 30.8/trap net, which is slightly above average when compared to similar lakes. Although bluegill catch rates have decreased since 2003 (75/trap net) and 2007 (45.4/trap net), the size structure of trap netted bluegills appears to have increased. In 2007, bluegills ranged from 2.9 to 7.9 inches in length and averaged 4.9 inches, and in 2012, bluegills ranged from 0.7 to 8.3 inches in length and averaged 5.9 inches. Six year classes of bluegills were sampled (2006-2011) with age-5 bluegills being the most abundant (38% of the sample). Growth of bluegills in French Lake appears to be good, as bluegills averaged 3.7 inches at age-1, 4.8 inches at age-2, 5.6 inches at age-3, 6.7 inches at age-4, 7.4 inches at age-5, and 8.1 inches at age-6.  <br> \n <br> \nThe walleye catch rate slightly decreased from the 2007 survey, dropping from 4.9/gill net in 2007 to 3.3/gill net in 2012, but still was within the long term range of catch rates (0.6 and 6.0/gill net in 1979 and 1984, respectively). The 2012 catch rate of 3.3 walleye per gill net is good when compared to similar lakes. Three year classes of walleye were present and corresponded to 3 stocking events in 2006, 2009, and 2010. Although sample size was small, walleye size structure was good, with lengths ranging from 12.3 to 22.5 inches and averaging 15.7 inches in gill nets. Walleye grow fast in French Lake as they averaged 13.2 inches at age-2 and 15.8 inches at age-3.  <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass and muskellunge are secondary management species on French Lake; however their populations were not assessed because they are not effectively captured by the gears used in this survey. The muskellunge population will be assessed during early spring of 2013. Two muskellunge were sampled during this survey and they had lengths of 39.4 and 44.3 inches. One largemouth bass was sampled measuring 6.6 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nThe 2012 yellow perch catch rate (23.0/gill net) decreased from the 2007 catch rate (30.6/gill net) but still was good when compared to similar lakes. Five year classes (2004, 2007-2010) were sampled, with age-3 fish representing 60% of yellow perch. Yellow perch exhibited small size structure, with no fish exceeding 10.0 inches. They ranged in length from 3.9 to 9.9 inches and averaged 7.4 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike have historically been scarce in French Lake and the trend continued in 2012 with a catch rate of 0.4/gill net, which is low when compared to similar lakes. Trap netted and gill netted northern pike ranged from 21.7 to 34.7 inches in length.  <br> \n <br> \nFreshwater drum continued to be abundant in French Lake with the 2012 trap net catch rate (5.6/trap net). The 2012 catch rate is similar to the 2007 catch rate and is consistent with historical catch rates of freshwater drum in French Lake. Freshwater drum were relatively large, ranging in length from 17.1 to 23.4 inches and averaging 20.3 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nCommon carp, pumpkinseed, white crappie, golden shiner, white bass, and white sucker were also present in the 8-6-2012 assessment, but occurred in low numbers. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers can help maintain or improve the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for table fare, but encourages release of medium- to large-sized fish.  Releasing these fish can help maintain balance in the fish community and provide anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future.  <br> \n <br> \nShoreline areas on the land and into the shallow water provide essential habitat for fish and wildlife that live in or near Minnesota's lakes.  Overdeveloped shorelines cannot support the fish, wildlife, and clean water that are associated with natural undeveloped lakes.  Shoreline habitat consists of aquatic plants, woody plants, and natural lake bottom soils.  <br> \n <br> \nPlants in the water and at the water's edge provide habitat, prevent erosion, and absorb excess nutrients.  Shrubs, trees, and woody debris such as fallen trees or limbs provide good habitat both above and below the water and should be left in place.  By leaving a buffer strip of natural vegetation along the shoreline, property owners can reduce erosion, help maintain water quality, and provide habitat and travel corridors for wildlife. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>French Lake is a hypereutrophic lake situated in an agricultural watershed with small woodlots northwest of the city of Faribault in Rice County. French Lake is classified as a class 24 lake with a Shoreline Development Index of 1.17. Lakeshore development is moderate to intense.  French Lake is the only Muskellunge managed water in the nine county Waterville Fisheries Management Area and has been stocked with Muskellunge fingerlings since 1974.  Historically, French Lake was stocked with approximately 600 Muskellunge fingerlings, of various strains, each fall.  Since 2014, French Lake has been stocked with approximately 400 Leech Lake strain Muskellunge fingerlings annually. A decreased stocking rate serves several purposes including: decrease the cost of Muskellunge stocking in French Lake, provide more Muskellunge to be stocked in other Muskellunge managed waters throughout the state, and decrease the potential for growth reductions due to high abundance.  The stocking rate of 1.0 Muskellunge per littoral acre annually will be maintained at least until a more in-depth population assessment can be completed.   <br> \n <br> \nThe first phase of a two-year population assessment was conducted in April, 2016.  Large-frame trap nets were used to sample adult Muskellunge beginning on April 19, 2016 and ending on April 29, 2016.  A total of 76 adult Muskellunge was sampled in 67 nets.  Catch-per-unit-effort was 1.1 adult Muskellunge per net lift which was similar to recent surveys, but below the 18 year average.  The average length was 40.7 inches and ranged from 33.9 inches to 51.6 inches.  Fifty-one percent of Muskellunge sampled were male, 28% were female, and 21% were of unknown gender.  The average length of female Muskellunge was 43.2 inches and the average length of male muskellunge was 38.7 inches. <br> \n <br> \nTrends in French Lake Muskellunge size structure are difficult to discern due to changing sampling methods.  However, large frame trap nets have been used since 1998 allowing comparisons among surveys conducted since 1998.  The average length of Muskellunge appears to have peaked since 2002 and has hovered around 40 inches in each survey since 2002.  Maximum length appears to have reached its full potential in 2004 and has been near 53 inches in since.  The proportions of fish greater than 38 inches and 42 inches have also remained relatively constant since 2002.  Muskellunge over 50 inches have always been rare in French Lake and only one fish longer than 50 inches was sampled in 2016.   <br> \n <br> \nPopulation estimates on French Lake have also varied due to inconsistent collection methods.  Population estimates were conducted in 2002, 2004, 2007, 2010, and 2013.  Population estimates peaked in 2004 (731 adult Muskellunge) and were lowest in 2013 (296 adult Muskellunge).  It is important to standardize methods to determine if this decline is due to gear bias or if the population is truly decreasing. <br> \n <br> \nMethods used to conduct Muskellunge population estimates were altered in 2016 in an attempt to standardize methods and avoid ineffective electrofishing.  Future population estimates will be calculated based on surveys conducted in consecutive springs using only large frame trap nets as sampling gear.  The one year time-frame between sampling periods will eliminate net avoidance.  However, conducting the recapture portion of a population estimate one year removed from the mark portion requires a reliable, long-term marking solution.  Therefore, all Muskellunge collected in 2016 were implanted with a tag containing a unique numeric code.  Recapture of marked fish will take place in spring of 2017.  Population estimates calculated in 2017 will reflect the population of adult Muskellunge (greater than 30 in) in French Lake in 2016.  Also, beginning in fall 2016, all fingerling Muskellunge will be implanted with tags prior to stocking.  Unique markings on fish will aid in population estimates as well as provide information on recruitment, growth, and mortality. <br> \n <br> \nFrench Lake's novelty as the only Muskellunge lake in the Waterville area would suggest it receives a relatively high amount of muskellunge-targeted fishing pressure; however, no angler survey data is available to substantiate this assumption. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers can play an important role in maintaining or improving a fish population by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for consumption, while encouraging the release of medium to large fish that may contribute to natural recruitment.  This practice helps maintain balance in the fish community and provides anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future.  Additionally, smaller fish often taste better and have fewer contaminants than larger, older fish from the same water body. <br> \n <br> \nShoreline property owners also play an important role in the overall health of an aquatic ecosystem, including the fish population.  Natural shorelines, including vegetation, woody debris, and bottom substrates, provide valuable habitat for fish and wildlife, help maintain water quality, and reduce bank erosion.  By leaving natural shorelines unaltered or restoring them to natural conditions, shoreline property owners are doing their part to maintain or improve a healthy ecosystem in the lake and protect the resource for future generations. <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n-Brandon Eder, Assistant Area Fisheries Supervisor <br> \n</p>",

A nearshore survey was conducted to assess the populations of both game and non-game fish species.  Fourteen 100-foot long sampling stations were evenly spaced around the lakeshore.

The 50 foot seine was used at 12 stations and the 15 foot seine was used at an additional 2 stations. This nearshore survey will be used along with the gill net survey conducted in 2020 and trap net survey conducted in 2021 to calculate a Fish-Based Index of Biotic Integrity (FIBI) score.  The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health by the types of fish species present and comparing it to what is expected for this type of lake. French Lake was evaluated using Tool 2 (shallow) and scored 41 which was below the threshold for impairment of 45. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>French Lake is a fertile lake situated in an agricultural watershed with small woodlots northwest of the city of Faribault in Rice County. Lakeshore development is moderate to intense.  French Lake is the only Muskellunge managed water in the nine county Waterville Fisheries Management Area and has been stocked with Muskellunge fingerlings since 1974.  Historically, French Lake was stocked with approximately 600 Muskellunge fingerlings, of various strains, each fall.  Since 2014, French Lake has been stocked with 398 Leech Lake strain Muskellunge fingerlings annually. A decreased stocking rate serves several purposes including: decrease the cost of Muskellunge stocking in French Lake, provide more Muskellunge to be stocked in other Muskellunge managed waters throughout the state, and decrease the potential for growth reductions due to high abundance.  The stocking rate of 1.0 Muskellunge per littoral acre annually will be maintained at least until a more in-depth population assessment can be completed.   <br> \n <br> \nA targeted survey was conducted the week of April 10th, 2017 to assess the Muskellunge population. A targeted survey is generally used for sampling a specific kind of fish or time of year (i.e. spawning season, fall season, etc.) unlike a standard survey which samples a wider range of fish species during the summer months using standard methods (i.e. standard time of year, set sampling stations, taking water clarity readings and oxygen/temperature profiles, etc.) and gears (i.e. lake survey gillnets, trap nets, and spring electrofishing for Largemouth Bass). Results from this targeted survey should not be compared to results from standard surveys. <br> \n <br> \nThe second phase of a two-year population assessment was conducted in April, 2017.  Large-frame trap nets were used to sample adult Muskellunge beginning on April 10th, 2017 and ending on April 21st, 2017.  A total of 101 adult Muskellunge and 1 juvenile Muskellunge were sampled in 57 nets.  Sixty-five percent of Muskellunge sampled were male, 34% were female, and 1% were of unknown gender. <br> \n <br> \nThe average length of Muskellunge sampled in 2017 was 41.3 inches and ranged from 18.5 inches to 50.8 inches.  The majority of fish sampled in 2017 were between 38 and 42 inches long.  Average length of Muskellunge appears to have leveled off and has hovered around 40 inches since 2002.  Maximum length appears to have reached its full potential in 2004 (54.0 inches) and has been near 50 inches in subsequent surveys.  Trophy length fish greater than 50 inches have always been rare in French Lake and only 2 have been sampled in each of the last three surveys.   <br> \n <br> \nThe number of adult Muskellunge (over 30 inches long) in French Lake was estimated at 198.  Of those fish, 104 were male, 84 were female, and 10 could not be identified.  Muskellunge density in French Lake is approximately 0.25 adult fish per surface acre or 1 fish for every 4 surface acres.  Muskellunge density at French Lake falls within the range of average densities for lakes statewide. <br> \n <br> \nManagement goals of more than 1 adult Muskellunge and Muskellunge over 50 inches present were met during the 2017 survey. <br> \n <br> \n-Brandon Eder, assistant area supervisor <br> \n</p>",

WALLEYES HAVE IN- CREASED FROM 0.54/GILLNET TO 6.00/GILLNET IN 84 WITH SIX YEAR CLASS WALLEYES CORRESPOND TO A SUCCESSFUL FRY STOCKING. A TWO-YEAR STOCKING GAP OF 82 AND 81 WOULD SUPPORT THE ASSUMPTION OF POOR REPRODUCTION, WITH NO 81, 81 YEAR CLASSES BEING SAMPLED. OLDER WALLEYES IV-VIII+ YEAR CLASS SEEM TO MATCH STOCKING FAIRLY WELL. NORTHERNS INCREASED FROM 0.27/GILLNET IN 79 TO 4.5/GILLNET IN 84. THE NORTHERN POPULATION IS FROM REPRODUCTION STRONG I, II, AND III YEAR CLASSES. THE NORTHERN POPULATION IS FROM REPRODUCION WITH NO STOCKING OF NORTHERNS SINCE 1972. BLUEGILLS INCREASED FROM 2.60/TRAPNET IN 79 TO 15.91/TRAPNET IN 84. BLUEGILLS HAD 5 YEAR CLASSES PRESENT WITH 2 YR OLDS DOMINATING. SIGNIFICANT CHANGE HAS TAKEN PLACE IN THE CRAPPIE POPULATION SINCE 79. ONLY A FEW BLACK CRAPPIE WERE SAMPLED IN 79, AND TODAY A MODERATE POPULATION IS PRESENT, 17.18/TRAPNET. THE ABUNDANT WHITE CRAPPIE POPULATION (118.5/TRAPNET) IN 79 IS GONE WITH ONLY 7 WHITE CRAPPIE SAMPLED IN 84. ALMOST EQUAL MUSKIE CATCHES WER MADE IN 84 AS IN THE 79 SURVEY. TEN MUSKIES WERE CAPTURED IN 79 AND ELEVEN IN 84. MUSKIES CAUGHT IN 84 WERE SMALLER THAN IN 79, WITH ONLY TWO FISH 30 IN. OR LARGER CAPTURED. HALF THE MUSKIES SAMPLED IN 79 WERE 30 IN OR LARGER. INCRE- ASES WERE NOTED IN THE BLACK BULLHEAD, PERCH, DRUM AND BOWFIN NUMBERS. BLACK BULLHEADS INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY FROM 0.50/TRAPNET IN 79 TO 50.18/ TRAPNET IN 84. PERCH ALMOST TRIPLED FROM 33.72/ GILLNET IN 79 TO 94.5/GILLNET IN 84. SLIGHT IN- CREASE WAS NOTED IN DRUM NUMBERS, WHILE BOWFIN WERE SAMPLED FOR THE FIRST TIME, WITH FOURTEEN FISH CAPTURED./</p>",
