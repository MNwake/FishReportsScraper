Northern pike were sampled at a rate of 1.5 per gillnet lift.  Northern pike mean length was 25.4 inches while growth rate was average compared to other Duluth Area lakes.  Although only four adult largemouth bass were documented in the 1993 survey it is speculated their abundance is higher this would indicate.  Panfish trapnet catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) was below 4.0 per lift for all species.  Mean lenth for black crappie and bluegill was 8.2 and 7.0 inches, respectively.  Black crappie growth rate was average while bluegill growth rate was fast compared to other Duluth Area lakes.  Brown bullhead were also documented from the 1993 survey.</p>",
