BLB WERE CAPTURED IN NUMBERS 6.4 AND TIMES GREATER THAN THE LOCAL AND STATE MEDIAN FOR TRAPNETS, RESPECTIVELY.  IN GILLNETS, BLB WERE SAMPLED IN NUMBERS 35 AND 154 TIMES THE LOCAL AND STATE MEDIANS.  BLB WERE RATED AT 3.2 FISH/POUND.  BLG WERE SAMPLED IN NUMBERS BETWEEN 10 AND 13 TIMES GREATER THAN THE STATE AND LOCAL MEDIANS FOR GILLNETS AND TRAPNETS.  PSD WAS CALCULATED AT 21.1%, WITH RSD=9.2%.  TWO FISH MEASURED GREATER THAN 9 INCHES.  SCALE SAMPLES WERE COLLECTED FROM 35 BLG AND ANALYZED FOR AGE AND GROWTH DATA.  THIS DATA SHOWS THAT THE LAKE CONTAINS HIGH NUMBERS OF FISH OF AGES 1-3, WITH A FEW AGE 4 AND 5, AND A GOOD NUMBER OF AGE 6 FISH. NO FISH WITH MORE THAN 6 ANNULI WERE FOUND. GROWTH THROUGH AGE 3 WAS ABOVE AVERAGE, BUT AT OR BELOW AVERAGE FOR AGES 4-6.  GSF WERE ALSO ABUNDANT, SAMPLED IN NUMBERS FOUR TIMES THE STATE AND LOCAL MEDIANS FOR GILLNETS AND OVER 60 TIMES THE STATE AND LOCAL MEDIANS FOR TRAPNETS.  RSD WAS CALCULTED AT 36.6%, WITH ONE 7 INCH AND ONE 8 INCH FISH MEASURED.  HSF WERE CAPTURED IN NUMBERS SLIGHTLY ABOVE THE STATE AND LOCAL MEDIANS FOR GILLNETS, AND 14 TIMES THE LOCAL MEDIAN, 28 TIMES THE STATE MEDIAN FOR TRAPNETS.  RSD WAS CALCULATED AT 8.9%.  BLC WERE SAMPLED IN NUMBERS 0.75 TIMES THE STATE MEDIAN FOR GILLNETS; AND THREE AND 7.4 TIMES THE LOCAL AND STATE MEDIAN FOR TRAPNETS. BLC WERE RATED AT 3.6 FISH PER POUND, WITH A RSD= 6.1%. IN ADDITION, SEVEN CARP AND FOUR WTS WERE CAPTURED IN THE GILLNET AND TRAPNETS AND BST AND FHM WERE TAKEN IN THE SEINE HAULS.</p>",
