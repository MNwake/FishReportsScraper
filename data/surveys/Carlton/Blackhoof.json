There is no public access to Blackhoof Lake.   <br> \n <br> \nAngling opportunities for Largemouth Bass are notable in Blackhoof Lake with fish up to 18.1 inches sampled.  The Largemouth Bass electrofishing catch rate was 107.5 fish per hour, which is above average compared to other Duluth Area Largemouth Bass populations.  Average length of sampled bass was 11.2 inches. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike abundance of 7.0 per gillnet lift was average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Mean length was excellent at 27.0 inches, and the size structure of the population was good.  Northern Pike over 36 inches in length were sampled.  Anglers are encouraged to release large Northern Pike to preserve this unique resource.    <br> \n <br> \nPanfish population density was average compared to other similar Minnesota lakes.  Black Crappie average length was 9.2 inches and over 40% exceeded ten inches.  Bluegill averaged 5.8 inches with some quality fish available over 8 inches.  Yellow Perch were scarce and small.</p>",

Fish population investigations have been conducted in 1974 and 1998.     Abundance of all but one of the species sampled during the 1998 lake survey were outside expected ranges compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Northern pike, bluegill and pumpkinseed sunfish abundance, indexed with assessment nets, was low.  Yellow perch, black bullhead and white sucker abundance, indexed with assessment nets, was high.  Black crappie index netting values were within the expected range compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Size structure was poor for all sampled gamefish species.  Mean length of black bullhead and white sucker sampled in 1998 was 7.4 and 13.0 inches.  Only 2 of 74 fish aged from the 1998 lake survey were older than age III.  Yellow perch were growing very fast, reaching 7.6 inches at the beginning of their third year.</p>",
