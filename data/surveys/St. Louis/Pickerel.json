The lake is clear and relatively unproductive.  There are two small inlets and the outlet flows into Armstrong Lake to the north.  There is no public access on Pickerel Lake however, approximately 70% of the shoreline in in public ownership (county tax forfeit). <br> \n <br> \nFive species of fish were captured during the 2012 investigation; northern pike, bluegill, walleye, largemouth bass and yellow perch.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike abundance (5.5/gill net) was higher than in 1976, the only previous assessment on Pickerel Lake.  Pike lengths ranged from 12.9 to 29.1 inches with an average of 21.8 inches.  Growth rates exceeded Area standards. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill abundance (15.0/trap net) exceeded the median of all lakes in the same classification as Pickerel.  No bluegill were present at the time of the previous assessment in 1976.  Bluegill in the 2012 assessement were small ranging from 3.4 to 7.9 inches and averaging 5.1 inches.  Growth rates were extremely slow. <br> \n <br> \nA small number of largemouth bass were also caught during the 2012 assessment.  These bass ranged from 5.7 to 12.4 inches.  Largemouth were not present during the 1976 assessment. <br> \n <br> \nOnly one walleye was caught in 2012.  A low number were also present in 1976.  Pickerel Lake was stocked with small walleye fingerlings in 1974 and 1977 however, it is not known if this stocking was successful in creating a population or if walleye arrived in Pickerel Lake by some other means.    </p>",
