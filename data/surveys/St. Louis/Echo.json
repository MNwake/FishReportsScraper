                "narrative": "<p>Echo Lake is located approximately four miles north of Buyck, Minnesota.  Echo Lake is 1,054 acres and the entire lake is less than 15 feet deep.  Echo Lake is a Minnesota Sentinel Lake; thus, investigations will be used to determine how the lake is responding to factors such as climate change, watershed development, invasive species, and runoff.  <br> \n <br> \nSeveral species of panfish were caught.  Bluegill and rock bass were captured, but rarely.  Black crappie were captured more frequenty, but abundance was below the expected range for this lake and well below what has been found in recent years.  However, crappie will provide some good fishing and some very large fish are still present in Echo Lake.  Fish up to 12.1 inches were observed in the sample.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike abundance was within the typical range for this lake type.  The average weight was 2.8 pounds, which is above the typical range for this lake type.  Size in the sample ranged from 14.7-35.6 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nSmallmouth bass are present and should provide good fishing.  Fish up to 17.8 inches were captured during this investigation.  The average size has increased considerably in the past dozen years.     <br> \n <br> \nWalleye populations have exceeded the expected range for this lake in nearly every investigation conducted in the past forty years.  In 2009, walleye abundance was again high and exceeded the normal range for this lake type.  Many solid year-classes were observed, so the future of walleye fishing looks bright in Echo Lake.  The sample showed walleyes from 4.0-23.5 inches and the average was 12.0.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch are present but are likely more important as forage for predators than as a recreational fish for anglers.  Very few fish above 9 inches were captured.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>     Echo Lake is a 1,054 acre, class 16 lake, located approximately four miles north of Buyck, Minnesota.  Echo Lake is shallow and the maximum depth is 10 feet.  The public access located on the south side of the lake was used during the population assessment.   <br> \n     Several species of panfish were caught, including bluegill, black crappie, pumpkinseed, and rock bass.  Generally, numbers were low and sizes were small.  However, black crappies were a notable exception.  Black crappie abundance in trap nets was 9.25 fish/set, which was well above most class 16 lakes; but down from the record high of 16.8 fish/set observed during the investigation in 1996.  Age in trap nets ranged from 1-4 years.  Total length (TL) ranged from 3.6-10.7 inches in trap nets and 3.7-13.5 in gill nets.   <br> \n     Northern pike gill-net abundance was 10.33 fish/set, which was nearly three times the level observed in most class 16 lakes.  Five year-classes were present and age ranged from 2-6 years.  Total length ranged from 17.0-30.0 inches in gill nets and mean weight was above average.  Growth was below the area average.   <br> \n     We used electrofishing gear to capture smallmouth bass at a rate of 25.2 per hour of on-time, which was similar to the level observed in 1996.  However, average size has increased considerably; from 8.1 inches in 1996 to 13.2 inches in 2006.  Total length in 2006 ranged from 3.6-19.6 inches.   <br> \n     Walleye populations have greatly exceeded catch rates for other class 16 lakes during every investigation conducted in the four previous decades except in 2001.  Walleye gill-net abundance in 2001 was 5.5 fish/set, which was below the median of 8.00 fish/set for lake class 16.  In 2006, walleye abundance was 15.9 fish/set, which exceedes the third quartile for class 16 lakes.  Twelve year-classes were present and age ranged from 0-17 years.  Total length in gill nets ranged from 5.5-26.1 inches and the mean was 15.8.  Growth was similar to the area average and mean weight of walleyes captured in gill nets was well above average.   <br> \n     Yellow perch gill-net abundance was 3.44 fish/set, well below the median of 9.20 fish/set for class 16 lakes.  Four year-classes were present and age ranged from 2-5 years.  Total length ranged from 5.6-8.9 inches.  Growth was similar to the area average.    <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Echo Lake is a 1,142 acre lake in St. Louis County located approximately 4 miles north of Buyck, Minnesota. Echo is a shallow lake with a maximum depth of 10 feet and dark brown tinted water. There is a public access at a US Forest Service campground on the southwest side of the lake. Echo Lake is a Minnesota Sentinel Lake; thus, investigations will be used to determine how the lake is responding to factors such as climate change, watershed development, invasive species, and runoff. This 2019 investigation was part of a regular rotation of fisheries surveys in the International Falls Management Area. <br> \n <br> \nThe Black Crappie catch rate in 2019 was the second highest ever recorded in Echo Lake, and much higher than what would be expected for this lake type. Growth and average size were both within the expected range for Echo. The largest caught were over 13 inches. Crappie ages ranged from 1 to 10 years old, but a particularly strong 2015 year class (age 4 at the time of this survey) made up 80% of the sample. There are also Bluegill present, but in much lower abundance. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike catch rates were average for this type of lake. The sizes are relatively small, with an average of about 20 inches. Growth is also slower than in most other International Falls area lakes. The largest Northern Pike caught in 2019 was 27.5 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nSmallmouth and Largemouth Bass are most effectively sampled with electrofishing gear. Electrofishing could not be completed in 2019 due to an equipment failure, so a Bass survey could not be completed for this survey. Past surveys have shown that there is a fairly abundant Smallmouth Bass population at times, and a much less abundant Largemouth Bass population present in Echo Lake.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye are abundant in Echo Lake. Nearly every survey produces catch rates greater than the expected range for this type of lake, and the 2019 investigation was no different. There is steady recruitment of new year classes, so there are a wide range of ages and sizes of Walleye in Echo. The 2019 sample included Walleye from 7 to 28 inches and ages from 1 to 17 years old. The average size sampled was 13.5 inches. Growth of these fish was similar to other International Falls area lakes.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch are mainly a forage species in Echo. Abundance is fairly low, and the average size is about 6 inches. There are a few that grow over 8 inches. About 80% of the Yellow Perch sampled in 2019 were from the 2017 year class.   <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled during the 2019 survey included Pumpkinseed, Redhorse, and White Sucker. <br> \n</p>",

The bottom soils beyond this depth were 100% muck.Water lilies and various emergent aquatic plant species were common in all of the bays, and submerged aquatic plants were scattered along the shoreline.Walleye, perch, rock bass, and common suckers made up the bulk of the test net catches, and northern pike, redhorse, and pumpkinseeds were taken in low numbers.Spawning conditions were evaluated as being good for northern pike and walleye, and fair to poor for most species of centrarchids.  Shoal water seining during the survey indicated that some natural reproduction of perch, walleye, and rock bass had occurred in 1960.There was no designated public access at the time of the survey.</p>",

Bass, black crappie, northern pike, and walleye dominate the sport-fish community.  Echo Lake is a Minnesota Sentinel Lake; thus, this investigation is part of special sampling that will be conducted to determine how the lake is responding to factors such as climate change, watershed development, invasive species, and runoff.  <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie trap-net abundance of 3.00 fish/set exceeded what is found in similar lakes, but was well below the record high of 16.8 fish/set observed in 1996.  In 2008, total length (TL) in trap nets ranged from 4.1 to 13.7 inches and the mean was 9.6.  Several strong year-classes were present and age ranged from 1 to 8.  Growth was essentially the same as the area mean (8.3 inches at age 4). <br> \n <br> \nBluegill trap-net abundance of 1.25 was the highest ever recorded in Echo Lake.  Mean TL in trap nets was 4.6 inches with a range from 3.6 to 8.4.  Eighty-seven percent of the bluegill captured in trap nets were from the 2006 year-class.  <br> \n <br> \nNight electrofishing was used to sample a total of 59 largemouth and smallmouth bass during 2 sampling nights in early June.  Largemouth bass were captured at a rate of 14.8 fish per hour of on-time, which was considerably higher than the rate of 1.64 fish per hour observed in 2006.  Total length ranged from 6.8 to 20.1 inches and the mean was 9.9.  Although most largemouth bass were young, growth was greater than the area mean.   <br> \n <br> \nSmallmouth bass were captured at a rate of 20.2 per hour of on-time, which was similar to previous investigations.  Total length ranged from 5.4 to 18.4 inches and the mean was 9.7.  Mean weight was 0.66 lb., a decrease from 2006 (1.56 lb).  Age ranged from 2 to 11.  Total length at age 4 was 12.2 inches, which was much greater than the area mean (9.4 in). <br> \n <br> \nSmall-mesh (1/4 inch) trap nets were used to capture age-0 fish.  Three species were represented.  Yellow perch dominated the catch, followed by black crappie and largemouth bass.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Beach seining indocated that 1988 was a poor year for smallmouth bass.  Smallmouth bass were first observed in the lake in 1980 (YOY were captured in beach seining).  Smallmouth bass annual number per haul was 0.38 in 1988, down from 3.83 in 1987.  Adult smallmouth bass have yet to be sampled with the standard passive gear.  Walleye index of abundance increased based on the trapnet CPUE; it was 1.50 fish/trapnet in 1988 vs 0.90 fish/trapnet in 1987.  All species, except white sucker, showed an increase in abundance based on trapnet catches.  High water levels may have affected CPUE. Black crappie was captured in the lake; this is the first occurence of this species based on our records.The walleye length frequency distribution showed a more uniform pattern than past assessments.  Past length frequency distributions displayed a bimodal pattern due to the absence of significant walleye recruitment during the period 1981 through 1984.  The result of the failure of these year classes meant the decline and near collapse of the walleye fishery.  Since 1985, however, walleye recruitment has been good, resulting in three strong year classes.  In addition, 1988 year classes have experienced good growth.  Historically, comparing gill net catches from 1960 and 1972 with 1988 suggest that walleye and yellow perch indices of abundance are down.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Echo Lake is a shallow stained lake with relatively abundant fish populations.  Walleye catches were well above average for this type of lake, although they were about 30 to 50% lower than in the 1960s and 1970's.  Walleye sizes have not changed over the years; average lengths observed were 12.1\" in gill nets and 17.6\" in trap nets.  Strong 1994 and 1991 year classes supply a range of sizes for anglers.  Growth rates were slower than average for the state, possibly because of their high abundance.Black crappie were recently introduced, although not by the DNR.  Crappie abundance is fairly high for now, but may fall somewhat in the future following the pattern of many introduced species.  The population is represented by two strong year classes.  The older year class made up 58% of the sample, and ranged in size from 9\" to 11\".  The younger year class was age 1 and less than 5\".Northern pike catches were typical for this lake type.  Northern pike average length was 21.2\".  The length distribution has not changed much over the course of population assessments.Yellow perch abundance was within the normal range for this lake class, but only two young year classes were represented.  This appears to be a normal phase for yellow perch in Echo Lake.  Review of previous assessments showed sporadic year class strength.Bluegill, pumkinseeds, and rock bass were present in fairly low numbers.  The pumpkinseeds and bluegill were fairly small, although one hybrid sunfish measured 9.3\".  White suckers were commonly caught in the gill nets.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Echo is a 1,054 acre lake located approximately four miles north of Buyck, Minnesota.  Echo Lake is shallow and the maximum depth is ten feet.  The public access located on the south side of the lake was used during the population assessment.       Several species of panfish were caught, including bluegill, black crappie, pumpkinseed, and rock bass.  Generally, numbers were low and sizes were small.  However, black crappies were a notable exception.  Black crappie abundance in trap nets was 4.38 fish/set, which was well above most lakes of this type; but down from the record high of 16.8 fish/set observed during the previous investigation in 1996.  Age in trap nets ranged from 1-10, with several strong year-classes.  Total length (TL) ranged from 3.5-12.5 inches in trap nets and was similar for gill nets.       Northern pike gill-net abundance was 6.75 fish/set, which was much higher than most lakes of this type.  Seven year-classes were present and age ranged from 1-7 years.  Total length ranged from 14.3-32.0 inches in gill nets and mean weight was above average for this lake type.  Growth was below the average for lakes in the International Falls management area.       Walleye populations have greatly exceeded most lakes of this type during every investigation conducted in the four previous decades.  However, walleye gill-net abundance in 2001 was 5.5 fish/set, which was below most lakes of this type and much lower than the record high for Echo Lake (43.3 fish/set in 1972).  Eleven year-classes were present and age ranged from 0-10 years.  Total length in gill nets ranged from 4.9-22.5 inches and the mean was 17.0.  Growth was similar to the area average and mean weight of walleyes captured in gill nets was above most lakes of this type.       Yellow perch gill-net abundance was slightly below most lakes of this type.  Four year-classes were present and age ranged from 2-5 years.  Total length ranged from 4.8-10.6 inches.  Mean TL at age-4 was similar to the area average.        Shorthead redhorse, smallmouth bass, and white suckers were also captured in 2001.</p>",

Black crappie, northern pike, smallmouth bass and walleye provide an excellent sport-fishery.  Echo Lake is a Minnesota Sentinel Lake; thus, this investigation is part of special sampling that will be conducted to determine how the lake is responding to factors such as climate change, watershed development, invasive species, and runoff.  <br> \n <br> \nAnglers can expect good crapie fishing.  Black crappie abundance exceeded the expected range for this lake type and size is very good.  Mean weight in the sample was 0.65 pounds and maximum length was 13.8 inches with a mean of 10.0 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance was good and fell within the expected range for this lake type.  Total length ranged from 7.2 to 21.4 inches and the mean was 13.5.  Mean weight was 1.21 pounds.   <br> \n <br> \nOther species present in the trap-net catch were northern pike, pumpkinseed, rock bass, shorthead redhorse, white sucker and yellow perch.  </p>",

Bass, northern pike, panfish, and walleye dominate the sport-fish community.  Echo Lake is a Minnesota Sentinel Lake; thus, this investigation is part of special sampling that will be conducted to determine how the lake is responding to factors such as climate change, watershed development, invasive species, and runoff.  <br> \n <br> \nNight electrofishing was used to sample 15 smallmouth bass during a single sampling night in late May.  Smallmouth bass were captured at a rate of 7.3 per hour of on-time, which was well below the peak of 29.5 per hour recorded in 1996, but similar to catches in recent years.  In 2011, total length ranged from 7.1 to 18.4 inches and the mean was 13.1.  Mean weight was 1.30 pounds, which was within the range observed during recent investigations.  Six year-classes were sampled and age ranged from 3-8 years.  The 2006 year-class represented 27% of the sample.  Growth was above the area average. <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass were not captured during 2011 or 2010 investigations and only one was captured in 2009.  Conversely, in 2008, largemouth bass were captured at a rate of 14.8 fish per hour of on-time in Echo Lake.  Largemouth bass were recently discovered in Echo Lake and we plan to closely monitor this population for additional insight into the changes that occur over time. </p>",

In this investigation trap-nets were used to capture several species of panfish including black crappie, bluegill, pumpkinseed and rock bass. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie trap-net abundance was 6.08 fish/set which exceeded 75% of other similar lakes in the state.  Lengths ranged from 3.9 to 13.5 with a mean of 9.8 inches.  Mean weight was 0.60 lbs which is above 50% of other similar class lakes.  Six year classes were present with ages ranging from 4 to 9 years, however 48% of the aged fish in the sample came from the 2006 year class. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill trap-net abundance was 0.25/set, below 25% of other similar lakes.  Lengths ranged from 3.5 to 8.4 with a mean of 6.7 inches.  Mean weight was 0.36 lbs which is just under 75% if other similar class lakes.  All aged fish came from the 2006 year class.   <br> \n <br> \nOne pumpkinseed was captured leading to a trap-net abundance of 0.08/set.  The lone fish was 7.2 inches long and weighed 0.33 lbs.   <br> \n <br> \nRock bass trap-net abundance was 0.25/set, just above 25% of other similar lakes.  Lengths ranged from 7.4 to 9.1 with a mean of 8.4 inches.  Mean weight was 0.46 lbs which is above 75% of other similar lakes. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Echo Lake is located approximately four miles north of Buyck, Minnesota.  Echo Lake is 1,142 acres and the entire lake is less than 15 feet deep.  Echo Lake is a Minnesota Sentinel Lake; thus, investigations will be used to determine how the lake is responding to factors such as climate change, watershed development, invasive species, and runoff.  <br> \n <br> \nSeveral species of panfish were caught.  Bluegill and rock bass were captured, but rarely.  Black crappie were captured more frequently, abundance was within the expected range for this lake, but well below what was found in record years.  Crappie will provide some good fishing and some very large fish are present in Echo Lake.  Fish up to 13.7 inches were observed in the sample.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike abundance was slightly above the typical range for this lake type.  Many young fish are present.  The average weight was 1.4 pounds, which is near the low end of the typical range for this lake type.  Size in the sample ranged from 14.1-26.6 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nSmallmouth bass are present and should provide good fishing.  Fish up to 15.2 inches were captured during this investigation.  The average size has increased considerably in the past twenty years.     <br> \n <br> \nWalleye populations have exceeded the expected range for this lake in nearly every investigation conducted in the past forty years.  In 2014, walleye abundance was again high and exceeded the normal range for this lake type.  Many solid year-classes were observed, so the future of walleye fishing looks bright in Echo Lake.  The sample showed walleyes from 8.2-24.4 inches and the average was 13.8.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch are present but are likely more important as forage for predators than as a recreational fish for anglers.  Very few fish above 9 inches were captured.  </p>",

Smallmouth bass YOY first occurred in the seining hauls in 1980.  Smallmouth bass annual mean no./haul was 3.83 in 1987, up from 3.25 in 1986.  The comparison with the most recent completed population assessment (1986) is complicated due to the lack of standardization (assuming the assumption that sampling time affects CPUE is valid for this comparison).  Most species were down in CPUE from 1986:  northern pike, 43%; shorthead redhorse, 637%; rock bass 545%; and yellow perch 11%.  In 1986, the walleye length distribution displayed a bimodal pattern with few small fish.  The reason for this pattern was explained with the 1987 aging data which determines that the 1982 through 1984 year classes were not recruited to the fishery.  The result of the failure of these year classes meant the decline and near collapse of the walleye fishery.  The reason for the decline may have been the result of environmental conditions or interspecific competition (with smallmouth bass).  It has been demonstrated when smallmouth bass are introduced into lakes with established walleye populations, the walleye population may dfeclione as the bass population increases.  Predation of young walleye by bass may be a factor on walleye year class strength.</p>",
