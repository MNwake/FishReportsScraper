                "narrative": "<p>Lake Twelve is a 58 acre basin of moderately soft and fertile water assigned to lake class 21.  The maximum depth is 31 feet with 34 acres of  littoral area.  Substrates are predominately sand and silt with an adequate abundance of aquatic vegetation.  Shoreline development on Lake Twelve has increased to 29 homes.  A public access does not exist on Lake Twelve and all of the surrounding property is privately held.            A fisheries population assessment was conducted which included trapnetting and gillnetting on June 28th and June 29th and shoreline seining on September 7th, 2000.  Previous assessments were conducted in 1967 and 1984.          Northern pike were present in moderate abundance.  Northerns ranged in length from 10.2 to 45.5 inches and in age from 2 to 10 years.  Young northern pike were not present in the seine haul.  Good spawning habitat is present in the south end of the lake but overall the availability is only fair.  Northern pike were stocked as yearlings in 1966, the only stocking on record.          Black crappie were taken in the trapnets at a rate higher than normal for the lake type but below both previous catches.  Sampled crappie varied from 4.7 to 10.0 inches with 30% of the catch greater than 7 inches.  Crappie ranged in age from 2 to 11 years with the 1998 year class representing 55% of the catch.  The 321 fingerlings sampled in the seine hauls had a 1.6 inch average.          The trapnet catch of bluegill was in the normal range for the lake class.  Bluegill averaged 5.8 inches in length with more than half the catch being greater than 6.5 inches.  The average weight was 0.21 pounds.  Bluegill ranged in age from 1 to 10 years with the strongest year classes occurring in 1996 and 1998.  Young sunfish dominated the shoreline seining and averaged 1.3 inches.          Young of the year Largemouth bass were well represented in the shoreline seining.  Adult bass were not sampled in either the trapnets or gillnets, but 3 were caught in the seine hauls.  Night electrofishing was not conducted during the assessment.           Yellow perch were abundant in the netting but were not present in the seining.  All yellow perch were between 5.3 and 7.6 inches with a 6 inch average.           Other species present during the assessment were;  golden shiner, emerald shiner, white sucker, tadpole madtom, black bullhead, yellow bullhead, pumpkinseed, and painted turtle.             Lake Twelve is fairly developed for its size and has no designated public access.  Fishing pressure is light.  Anglers should expect good numbers of acceptable size bluegill and black crappies.  Northern pike, while not overly abundant, provide a trophy fishery with lengths of some individuals exceeding 45 inches. </p>",
