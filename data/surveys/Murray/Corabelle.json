                "narrative": "<p>Corabelle is a 107 acre lake with a maximum depth of 6 feet.  The lake is located near Iona in Murray County.  The lake is presently managed for northern pike as the primary species while yellow perch and black crappie are managed secondarily.The catch rate for northern pike was somewhat low for lakes similar to Corabelle.  Lengths of the northern pike sampled ranged from 7.3 to 27.9 inches and averaged 18.1 inches.The yellow perch population looks good for lakes similar to Corabelle.  Lengths of yellow perch ranged from 5.1 to 8.6 inches and averaged 6.1 inches.  Most of the perch were age 1 and 2.  Only two black crappie were sampled during the assessment both of which were 11.1 inches.There should be good bullhead fishing for those who like to eat and or catch bullhead.  Many of the bullhead sampled in our nets were 8.5 to 9.5 inches.To promote and maintain healthy fish populations, pollution and other inputs need to be controlled.   Fish habitats are directly affected by water quality.  Nutrient, sediment and other waste inputs can drastically alter the biological, chemical, and physical components of a lake.  It is paramount to maintain if not improve the current water quality of Corabelle Lake through watershed management to preserve this fishery for future generations.</p>",

Corabelle is managed primarily for northern pike while yellow perch and black crappie are managed secondarily.  Because of shallowness, only trap nets were used for the assessment. <br> \n <br> \nCorabelle has a good northern pike population in it.  Lengths of northern pike caught ranged from 26 to 34 inches and averaged around 30 inches.  Northern pike fingerlings were stocked in 2004 and 2007 and will be stocked again in 2011.  <br> \n <br> \nCorabelle also has a very good yellow perch population with the opportunity to catch some nice sized fish.  Lengths of yellow perch caught in the assessment ranged from 4 to 12.5 inches and averaged around 7 inches.  There were a fair number of yellow perch 8 inches and larger.  There are a lot of fish in the 4 to 6 inch range coming up in the population which should make perch fishing good for a while. <br> \n  <br> \nThere is a fair number of black crappie in Corabelle.  Lengths of black crappie caught in our trap nets ranged from 4 to 12 inches and averaged about 7.5 inches.  The lake was stocked with adult black crappie in 2003 and 2005 to try and establish a fishable population.  A lot of fish in the 4 to 6 inch range indicate that those stockings have been successful and should provide black crappie angling opportunities in the future.  There are also a few white crappie present in the lake.  You can usually tell the difference between the two because typically white crappie have vertical bars on the side of the fish. <br> \n  <br> \nCorabelle has an average black bullhead population.  Lengths of black bullhead caught in our trap nets ranged from 7 to 11 inches and averaged almost 9 inches.  So if you\u0019re hungry for a fresh meal of bullhead, Corabelle might be a good choice.  If bow fishing is your sport, you might want to give Corabelle a shot.  Numbers aren\u0019t extremely high but there are some nice carp to be arrowed.  Lengths of carp caught in our trap nets ranged from 18 to 27 inches with many over 22 inches. <br> \n <br> \nTo maintain a healthy fishery in Corabelle Lake, we need to promote Best Management Practices (BMP\u0019s) within the watershed to help reduce nutrients entering the lake.  High nutrients and sediments in a lake can cause algae blooms and reduce water clarity. <br> \n <br> \n  <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Corabelle Lake is a 107-acre lake located three miles south of the City of Iona in Murray County.  The lake's shallow maximum depth of 6.0 ft. and location in a highly agricultural watershed likely contribute to the poor water quality. Corabelle Lake is managed primarily for Northern Pike and secondarily for Yellow Perch and Black Crappie. A standard survey was conducted the week of July 26, 2021 to monitor fish populations using a gill net and trap nets.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike have occurred in low abundance in Corabelle Lake, with catch rates ranging from 0.6 per trap net in 2001 to 2.2 per trap net in 1996. The 2021 Northern Pike catch rate was 1.9 per trap net, which exceeds the long-term average of 1.3 per trap net and is the second highest catch recorded in Corabelle Lake.  With the current Northern Pike regulation of a 2 fish limit and need to be at least 24 inches for southern MN lakes, all of the sampled fish were of legal size to harvest.  Lengths of Northern Pike ranged from 25.4 to 36.7 inches and averaged 30.8 inches. One-hundred and four Northern Pike fingerlings were stocked in the fall of 2021 to supplement the existing population.   <br> \n <br> \nThe 2021 Yellow Perch catch rate was 247.0 per gill net, greatly exceeding the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (2.78 to 25.0 per gill net). Although very abundant, lengths of Yellow Perch were small, ranging from 4.4 to 12.1 inches and averaging 7.5 inches.  Eighty-seven percent of sampled Yellow Perch were less than 9.0 inches in length.  The Yellow Perch population in Corabelle Lake should provide a great angling opportunity after the perch have another year or two of growth.  <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie are a secondary management species in Corabelle Lake and have consistently occurred at a low abundance (less than 3.4 per trap net since 1996). Zero Black Crappie were caught in the 2021 survey.  In an effort to reestablish the Black Crappie population, 300 adults were stocked in 2012; however, it does not appear that this stocking and subsequent natural reproduction has been successful.  Management of Black Crappie on Corabelle Lake may be dropped in the near future.   <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled included Bigmouth Buffalo, Black Bullhead, Common Carp, Orangespotted Sunfish, White Sucker, and Yellow Bullhead.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Corabelle Lake was initially surveyed by the Section of Fisheries in 1996.  The lake is located within the Schoelberl Wildlife Management Area and covers 107 acres.  Although the immediate shoreline has some woodland areas, the surrounding shoreline and watershed are dominated by agricultural crops.  A fixed sill dam is located at the outlet on the north shore and water input is a function of field tiles and runoff.  The maximum depth of Corabelle Lake is approximately 6 feet and the primary bottom type is sand.  Although five species of aquatic vegetation are present in Corabelle Lake, aquatic vegetation is considered sparse.  The lake is relatively small and shallow and susceptible to winter fish kill events.  Because Corabelle Lake lacked a public access, active fisheries management has been limited in the past.  Currently, Corabelle Lake is a popular gathering location for many nearby residents and fishing interest appears to be increasing.  As a result, Murray County has acquired a public access on the south shore and applied for an aeration permit.  A fisheries management plan is currently being devised for Corabelle Lake with information obtained through the 1996 survey.Survey results indicate that Corabelle Lake supports healthy and self-supporting populations of northern pike and yellow perch.  These species appear to fare well in Corabelle Lake and are more tolerant than other gamefish to low dissolved oxygen levels which may occur during winter ice cover; therefore, both northern pike and yellow perch will be included in the future fisheries management plan for Corabelle Lake.  Northern pike numbers are above average compared to other lakes in our area.  Pike collected in our trapnets ranged in length from 18 to almost 30 inches with an average of approximately 23 inches.  Data collected in 1996 suggest that northern pike reproduce naturally in Corabelle Lake as northern pike were not officially stocked in the past.Yellow perch numbers are considered high compared to similar lakes in our area.  Perch collected in our trapnets ranged in length from 4 to 13 inches with an average of approximately 6 inches.  Although the population is dominated by smaller fish (less than 5 inches), a fair number of perch are of preferred size (10+ inches).  Yellow perch also appear to reproduce naturally in Corabelle Lake as perch were not stocked in the past.Corabelle lake also supports normal numbers of black bullhead.  Fish collected in our trapnets ranged in length from 4 to almost 12 ? inches with an average of approximately 7 ? inches.  Black bullhead were last stocked officially in the early 1950's.The carp numbers in Corabelle Lake are considered normal while white sucker numbers are considered high compared to similar lakes in our area.  Orangespotted sunfish were the only other fish species collected during our 1996 survey.To promote and maintain a healthy fish population, pollution and other inputs need to be controlled.  Fish habitat is directly affected by water quality.  Nutrient, sediment and other waste inputs can drastically alter the chemical and physical components of a Lake.  It is paramount to maintain if not improve the current water quality of Corabelle Lake through watershed management to preserve this fishery for future generations to enjoy.   </p>",

                "narrative": "<p> INTRODUCTION <br> \nCorabelle Lake is a 107-acre lake located 3 miles south of the City of Iona in Murray County. Corabelle Lake is shallow with a maximum depth of 6.0 feet. Corabelle Lake has a watershed-to-lake ratio of 4:1 which indicates that it has a relatively small watershed. Despite the small watershed, Corabelle Lake's water quality is poor as indicated by a secchi depth of 0.7 feet. The poor water quality is likely a result of nutrient runoff from adjacent agricultural fields. The primary management species in Corabelle Lake is northern pike, while yellow perch and black crappie are managed secondarily. The northern pike population is maintained through fingerling stocking one out of four years (2004, 2007, 2010, and 2014). Adult black crappies have also occasionally been stocked after suspected winterkills to maintain the spawning broodstock (2005 and 2012). The yellow perch population has been self-sustaining, with no stocking occurring in the recent past. A population assessment was conducted during the week of July 14, 2014 to monitor fish populations using nine trap nets.  <br> \n <br> \nNORTHERN PIKE <br> \nHistorically, northern pike have occurred in low abundance in Corabelle Lake, with catch rates ranging from 0.6 per net in 2001 to 2.2 per net in 1996. The 2014 catch rate was within this range as northern pike were captured at a rate of 0.7 per trap net, slightly below the long term average of 1.1 per trap net and down from the 2008 catch rate of 1.0 per trap net. Lengths of northern pike ranged from 24.2 to 31.7 inches and averaged 28.0 inches. Northern pike were chunky, weighing an average of almost five pounds.  <br> \n <br> \nYELLOW PERCH <br> \nThe yellow perch catch rate in 2014 (3.7 per trap net) was similar to the catch rate in 2008 (4.4 per trap net) and was within the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (0.3 to 3.8 per trap net). The 2014 catch rate of 3.7 per trap net is below the long term average of 7.3 per trap net; however, the long term average was highly influenced by high catch rates in the 1996 and 2001 surveys (10.3 and 10.8 per trap net, respectively). A winterkill assessment was done in April 2011, during which yellow perch were captured at a rate of 105.0 per trap net. The timing of the survey likely resulted in this high catch rate because nets were set when yellow perch were likely moving inshore to find spawning areas. In 2014, yellow perch were small, ranging in length from 4.7 to 6.6 inches and averaging 5.5 inches. In comparison, lengths during the 2011 winterkill assessment ranged from 3.2 to 11.1 inches and averaged 8.0 inches. Yellow perch are typically sampled more effectively with gill nets; however gill nets were not used in 2014 because of the shallowness of the basin. The time of year (mid-July) and the gear used (trap nets) in 2014 may be underestimating perch abundance and size structure in Corabelle Lake.  <br> \n <br> \nBLACK CRAPPIE <br> \nThe black crappie population has been increasing since the 2001 survey, from 0.2 per trap net in 2001 to 2.2 per trap net in 2008 to 3.4 per trap net in 2014. The 2014 catch rate was within the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (1.2 to 20.5 per trap net). Black crappies ranged in length from 4.3 to 5.3 inches and averaged 4.9 inches. The narrow range of lengths indicate the presence of one year class, likely age-2 fish, that were a result of the pre-spawn adult black crappies stocked in early May of 2012, following the partial winterkill during the winter of 2010. In a couple of years, crappies should attain a length that is acceptable to anglers.  <br> \n <br> \nOTHER SPECIES <br> \nThe black bullhead catch rate in 2014 (11.7 per trap net) remained unchanged from the 2008 catch rate (11.8 per trap net), and was significantly less than catch rates observed in 2001 and 1996 (44.9 and 52.8 per trap net, respectively). The 2014 catch rate was toward the low end of expected catch rates for similar lakes (11.5 to 132.6 per trap net). Black bullheads ranged in length from 4.1 to 11.9 inches and averaged 7.7 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nThe common carp population has remained stable in Corabelle Lake, with catch rates ranging from 1.2 per trap net in 1996 to 2.7 per trap net in 2008. The 2014 catch rate was within this range at 2.0 per trap net and was within the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (1.0 to 5.5 per trap net). Many lengths of common carp were present with lengths ranging from 8.7 to 28.2 inches and averaging 12.7 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nThe white sucker catch rate increased from 0.0 in 2008 to 4.8 in 2014. White sucker were between 14.6 and 19.0 inches in length.  <br> \n <br> \nThe 2011 winterkill assessment was the first time that bigmouth buffalo were captured in Corabelle Lake. In 2014, the bigmouth buffalo were still present and were captured at a rate of 0.6 per trap net (n=5). In 2011, bigmouth buffalo averaged 7.8 inches and in 2014 they averaged 24.5 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nOther species captured include orange spotted sunfish (n=90) and yellow bullhead (n=1). This is the first time that yellow bullhead have been sampled in Corabelle Lake (6.1 inches in length). <br> \n <br> \nPlants in the water and at the water's edge provide habitat, prevent erosion, and absorb excess nutrients.  Shrubs, trees, and woody debris such as fallen trees or limbs provide good habitat both above and below the water and should be left in place.  By leaving a buffer strip of natural vegetation along the shoreline, property owners can reduce erosion, help maintain or improve water quality, and provide habitat and travel corridors for wildlife. <br> \n <br> \nBest management practices within the watershed (no-till farming, cover crops, buffer strips, targeted fertilizer application, reduced or metered tiling) would help reduce nutrients entering the lake. High nutrient and sediment input can cause algae blooms and reduce overall water quality. Any improvements in the watershed are likely to have positive impacts on the fishery. <br> \n <br> \nPrepared by Jonah Dagel <br> \n</p>",
