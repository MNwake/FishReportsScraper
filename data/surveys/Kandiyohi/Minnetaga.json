                "narrative": "<p>A standard survey of Minnetaga was conducted during early July of 2016. A fall electrofishing survey was conducted on September 12, 2016 to assess young of year \"YOY\" (fingerling sized) Walleye abundance in Minnetaga. An initial fish survey was completed in 2007. Minnetaga is a moderate sized (791 acres), shallow (9 feet deep), turbid and productive lake located in Kandiyohi County. There are two public access sites along the east shore which include a newly completed state owned gravel boat ramp and a road right away access off the county gravel road. Low water levels can make large boat access difficult at the public sites. An Aquatic Management Area is located across the road along Lake Kasota. Moderate nutrient runoff inflows are common into Minnetaga during rain events from agricultural sources via the shoreline areas, tiles, and ditches. The outlet flows into Lake Kasota (6 feet deep) which connects to other shallow lakes (Little Kandiyohi and eventually Lake Wakanda). A swinging finger fish barrier is located on the downstream (Kasota side) culvert end of the outlet. Intense blue-green algae blooms can be common in Minnetaga during the summer months. Aquatic vegetation species present are limited mostly to sago pondweed, filamentous algae and water moss. The water clarity was poor (secchi disc=1.4 feet) for Minnetaga on June 13, 2016. The water is a brown stained color. Winterkills have been relatively uncommon in Minnetaga during recent years. A partial winterkill of gamefish may have occurred during the 2007 08 winter due to low oxygen conditions; however, there were no local reports of dead fish seen along the shore in the 2008 spring. Excellent Walleye fishing had occurred prior to January of 2013 on both Minnetaga and Kasota. Nearby, connected Lake Kasota and Lake Wakanda had significant winterkills of Common Carp and Walleye during late January or early February of 2013. No significant numbers of dead fish were noted on Minnetaga during the spring of 2014. Ice out trapnets captured Walleye that were 20+ inches in size from Minnetaga during the spring of 2013. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike numbers were low in 2016 (0.50 fish/gillnet) compared to then normal range of similar lakes. The 2007 Northern Pike catch rate was 6.00 fish/gillnet. The 2016 Northern Pike average size was large (7.91 pounds and 33.23 inches) from gillnets. Minnetaga has been a popular shore fishing area for catching large Northern Pike in the past. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch numbers were moderately abundant in 2016 (19.50 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes. The 2007 Yellow Perch catch rate was 28.50 fish/gillnet. The 2016 Yellow Perch average was moderate (0.32 pounds and 8.79 inches) from gillnets. There were abundant numbers of Yellow Perch 8.0 inches and larger in the 2016 survey catch. Yellow Perch growth rates were excellent. The 2013 year class comprised 69% of the 2016 Yellow Perch survey catch. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye numbers were abundant in 2016 (39.50 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes. The 2007 Walleye catch rate was 9.25 fish/gillnet. The 2016 Walleye average size was small (0.84 pounds and 12.24 inches) from gillnets. There were abundant numbers of Walleye 15.0 inches and larger in the 2016 survey catch. Walleye growth rates were average. The 2014 year class comprised 73% of the 2016 Walleye survey catch. Local anglers reported excellent success catching Walleye from shore during the 2016 fall. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye natural reproduction is generally insignificant in Minnetaga. Walleye movement in or out of Minnetaga is possible with connected Kasota and Wakanda Lakes. Walleye fry (about 770,000 fry per year) were recently stocked into Minnetaga from 2008 2012, 2014 and 2016. YOY Walleye abundance was low in 2016 (4.0 YOY/hour, 6.9 inches). YOY Walleye numbers were abundant (192.0 YOY/hour, 5.9 inches) in the 2014 fall electrofishing survey. No fall electrofishing surveys were conducted in 2011-2012 due to poor access and low water conditions. No yearling Walleye were captured in Minnetaga during 2014 or 2016. Walleye fry will be stocked in 2017 due to low YOY Walleye numbers in 2016.  <br> \n <br> \nBlack Bullhead numbers were low in 2016 (4.25 fish/trapnet, 21.50 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal ranges for similar lakes. The 2007 Black Bullhead catch rates were 3.67 fish/trapnet and 36.00 fish/gillnet. The 2016 Black Bullhead average size was moderate (0.42 pounds).  <br> \n <br> \nCommon Carp numbers were abundant in 2016 (15.17 fish/trapnet, 16.50 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal ranges for similar lakes. The 2007 Common Carp catch rates were 3.67 fish/trapnet and 7.25 fish/gillnet. The 2016 Common Carp average sizes were moderate from trapnets (4.20 pounds and 19.4 inches) and small from gillnets (1.96 pounds and 15.9 inches). <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species captured during 2016 included high numbers of White Sucker (32.00 fish/gillnet). Low numbers of Bigmouth Buffalo (0.17 fish/trapnet), Black Crappie (0.25 fish/trapnet) and Channel Catfish (0.08 fish/trapnet) were also caught in 2016. <br> \n <br> \nCurrent fish management activities on Minnetaga include monitoring winter dissolved oxygen levels, protecting aquatic vegetation through the permit process, assisting aquatic plant management and enforcement personnel in educating boaters and monitoring access sites for potential invasive species introductions, encouraging land owners to implement best management practices in the watershed, and stocking various fish species as warranted. All fish species will be sampled in 2021. Fall electrofishing surveys will be conducted during Walleye fry stocked years to assess the success or failure of the stockings. <br> \n </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Minnetaga is a moderate size (738 acres), shallow (9 feet maximum), and productive lake located in Kandiyohi County. An initial survey of Minnetaga was conducted during early July of 2007. The surrounding watershed area is primarily agricultural, in addition to smaller areas of hardwood trees and wetlands. Residential development is limited to three farm sites located along the shoreline area. Public access and parking is limited to a nearby township road right-of-away along the northwest shore and a narrow gravel access road along the west shore. Partial winterkills were historically frequent in Minnetaga, but have been infrequent in recent years. Water quality and clarity conditions are often poor in Minnetaga due to agricultural runoff via various small inlets. Water clarity was 1.0 foot on June 11 and July 16, 2007. Total phosphorus (0.211 ppm) and chlorophyll a (156 ppb) levels were high in Minnetaga during June of 2007. Intense blue-green algal blooms are common during the mid summer. The outlet flows into Kasota Lake. The nearby Lake Wakanda outlet connects into a chain of small shallow lakes, which includes Little Kandiyohi, Kasota, and Minnetaga. Walleye fry are stocked every other year in Wakanda. Aquatic vegetation emergent and submergent species/densities were limited in Minnetaga. Water moss and filamentous algae were the most frequently occurring and had the highest mean abundance ratings for all aquatic vegetation species. Shoalwater substrates were varied, which included abundant areas of sand with common to rare areas of gravel, rubble, and silt. Walleye fry have not been stocked into Minnetaga since 1995 (792,000 fry). Minnetaga is managed primarily for walleye, northern pike, and yellow perch. The west shore of Minnetaga has been a good shore fishing area for northern pike during the summer months after consecutive years with no winterkill. Anglers had some winter ice fishing success for walleye during late 1990's to early 2000's following the 1995 walleye stocking.  <br> \n <br> \nBlack bullhead numbers were low to moderate in 2007 (36.00 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes. The 2007 black bullhead average size was moderate (0.33 pounds and 8.19 inches) from gillnets.  <br> \n <br> \nCarp numbers were moderate in 2007 (7.25 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes. The 2007 carp average size was moderate (5.37 pounds and 22.72 inches) from gillnets.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch numbers were abundant in 2007 (28.50 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes. The 2007 yellow perch average size was moderate (0.25 pounds and 7.50 inches) from gillnets. Yellow perch catch rate of quality size (8.00 inches) and larger was high (8.25 fish/gillnet) in 2007. Yellow perch growth rates were within the  <br> \nSpicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-2, and above the normal ranges for ages 3-7. The 2004 and 2005 year classes comprised 57% and 25% of the 2007 yellow perch catch. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike numbers were moderate to high in 2007 (6.00 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes. The 2007 northern pike average size was moderate (2.80 pounds and 22.92 inches) from gillnets. Northern pike catch rate of quality size (21.00 inches) and larger was high (4.75 fish/gillnet) in 2007. Northern pike growth rates were above the Spicer Area normal range for age 1, within the normal ranges for ages 2-4, and below the normal range for age 5. The 2003 and 2004 year classes comprised 38% and 33% respectively of the 2007 northern pike catch. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye numbers were moderate in 2007 (9.25 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes. The 2007 walleye average size was large (3.13 pounds and 20.16 inches) from gillnets. The 2007 catch rate of quality size (15.00 inches) and larger walleye was high (9.25 fish/gillnet) in Minnetaga. Walleye growth rates were generally above the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-5. The 2002 and 2004 year classes comprised 59% and 27% respectively of the 2007 walleye catch. Walleye presence in Minnetaga could be from natural reproduction or immigration from connected Lake Wakanda. Walleye fry were stocked during 2002 and 2004 into Wakanda. Fall electrofishing results for Wakanda indicated moderate numbers of young of year \"YOY\" walleye (48.57 fish/hour) present in 2002, but low numbers present in 2004 (26.67 fish/hour). <br> \n <br> \nCurrent fish management activities on Minnetaga include monitoring the fish population on a periodic basis, monitoring winter dissolved oxygen levels, protecting aquatic vegetation through the permit process, participating in local watershed initiatives, acquiring and developing adequate public access, and stocking various fish species as warranted. The Minnetaga fishery will be sampled in the 2008 fall for YOY walleye abundance.  <br> \n</p>",

Minnetaga is a moderate size (791 acres), shallow (9 feet maximum depth), non-aerated, and productive lake located in Kandiyohi County. Minnetaga has potential for winterkill during extreme winters. A significant winterkill occurred on downstream Lake Kasota, but none on Minnetaga during February of 2019. A significant winterkill occurred on connected Kasota and Wakanda during January of 2013, but not on Minnetaga.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye fry (approximately 700,000-800,000 fry per year) were recently stocked into Minnetaga from 2008-2012, 2014 and 2016-2017. Approximately 1.2 million Walleye fry were stocked in 2018. Walleye fry stocked in Minnetaga were of Spicer strain during 2014, Pike River strain during 2016 and 2018, a mix of Pike River and Private strain during 2017 (702,931 fry). Walleye natural reproduction is sporadic at best in Minnetaga. Walleye movement in or out of Minnetaga has occurred with connected Kasota (not stocked) and Wakanda (fry stocked) Lakes which makes evaluations difficult using standard analysis.  <br> \n <br> \nAbundant YOY Walleye numbers (226.16 YOY/hour, 5.8 inches) and low Yearling Walleye numbers (6.92 fish/hour, 12.5 inches) were captured in the 2018 fall electrofishing survey. Low YOY Walleye numbers (16.36 fish/hour, 5.2 inches average) were captured in the 2017 fall night electrofishing survey. Abundant numbers of yearling or adult Walleye (30.00 fish/hour, 9.9 inches average) were captured in 2017. YOY Walleye abundance was low in 2016 (4.00 YOY/hour, 6.9 inches). Abundant YOY Walleye numbers (192.00 YOY/hour, 5.9 inches average length) were captured in the 2014 fall night electrofishing survey. No yearlings were captured in 2014. We observed abundant YOY Sunfish and adult Walleye in the 2018 fall electrofishing survey. <br> \n <br> \nAbundant numbers of adult Walleye were captured in the most recent 2016 summer survey (39.50 fish/gillnet, 12.2 inches average). The 2014 year class comprised 73% of the 2016 Walleye summer survey catch. Fall electrofishing surveys were not conducted in 2011 or 2012. YOY Walleye numbers (18.00 YOY/hour, 6.1 inches average length) were low in 2010.  <br> \n <br> \nThe Minnetaga fishery will be sampled in 2021 for all fish species. The next scheduled Walleye fry stocking is for 2018. Fall night electrofishing surveys will be conducted during Walleye fry stocked years to assess the success or failure of the stockings. <br> \n</p>",

No YOY walleye were captured in the 2009 fall electrofishing survey for Minnetaga. Yearling walleye numbers (39.00 fish/hour, 8.79 inches average length) were moderate in 2010. Yearling walleye presence in Minnetaga could be from 2009 fry stockings in Minnetaga or connected Lake Wakanda. Fall electrofishing results for Wakanda indicated high numbers of YOY walleye (234.00 fish/hour) present in 2009.

                "narrative": "<p>A standard survey of Minnetaga was conducted during late June and early July of 2021. A targeted survey is generally used for sampling a specific kind of fish or time of year (i.e., spawning season, fall season, etc.) unlike a standard survey which samples a wider range of fish species during the summer months using standard methodology (i.e., standard time of year, set sampling stations, taking water clarity readings and oxygen/temperature profiles, etc.) and gears (i.e., lake survey gillnets, trapnets and possibly spring electrofishing for Largemouth Bass). <br> \n <br> \nA standard survey of Minnetaga was first conducted during early July of 2016. An initial fish survey was completed in 2007. Minnetaga is a moderate sized (791 acres), shallow (9 feet deep), turbid and productive lake located in Kandiyohi County. There are two public access sites along the east shore which include a newly completed state-owned gravel boat ramp and a road right away access off the county gravel road. Low water levels can make large boat access difficult at the public sites. Water levels were low in 2020 and 2021. An Aquatic Management Area is located along the southwest shore. Moderate nutrient runoff inflows are common into Minnetaga during rain events from agricultural sources via the shoreline areas, tiles, and ditches. The outlet flows into Lake Kasota (6 feet deep) which connects to other shallow lakes (Little Kandiyohi and eventually Lake Wakanda). A swinging finger fish barrier is located on the downstream (Kasota side) culvert end of the outlet. Intense blue-green algae blooms can be common in Minnetaga during the summer months. Aquatic vegetation species present are usually limited mostly to sago pondweed, filamentous algae and water moss in Minnetaga. Submergent vegetation was sparse in 2021. The water clarity was poor (secchi disc=2.5 feet) for Minnetaga on June 13, 2016. The water was a brown-green stained color due in part to algae blooms in 2021.  <br> \n <br> \nWinterkill events have been relatively uncommon in Minnetaga during recent years. A partial winterkill of gamefish may have occurred during the 2007 08 winter due to low oxygen conditions; however, there were no local reports of dead fish seen along the shore in the 2008 spring. Excellent Walleye fishing had occurred prior to January of 2013 on both Minnetaga and Kasota. Nearby, connected Lake Kasota and Lake Wakanda had significant winterkills of Common Carp and Walleye during late January or early February of 2013. No significant numbers of dead fish were noted on Minnetaga during the spring of 2014. Ice out trapnets captured low numbers of Walleye that were 20+ inches in size from Minnetaga during the spring of 2013. Winter dissolved oxygen readings on most area shallow lakes were relatively high (>10.0 ppm) during January of 2019. High snowfall events and cold temperatures were the norm for February and early March of 2019. No winterkill was observed on Minnetaga unlike other nearby lakes like Wakanda and Lake Lillian. Ice out netting in 2019 confirmed the presence of various gamefish/panfish species present in Minnetaga. Dissolved oxygen levels were adequate on most area lakes during the 2020-21 winter. Minnetaga winter oxygen levels were marginal (2.6 ppm) during mid-February of 2022. Dissolved oxygen levels were variable during the 2021-22 winter due in part to low water levels, colder temperatures, variability in snow cover, and overabundance of submergent vegetation in some basins (i.e., Elizabeth). In 2021-22 winter, high snowfall cover coupled with low water and decaying of high submergent vegetation densities in some area lakes resulted in rapid declines of winter oxygen levels. These conditions may result in possible winterkill of fish in some area lakes in 2022. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike were absent in the 2021 gillnets. Northern Pike abundance in 2016 was low (0.50 fish/gillnet). The 2007 Northern Pike abundance was 6.00 fish/gillnet. One Northern Pike was captured in the 2021 trapnets (0.08 fish/trapnet, 22.17 inches). Minnetaga has been a popular shore fishing area for catching large Northern Pike in the past. Northern Pike possession limit regulations for Minnetaga in the North-central Zone are as follows: anglers can keep 10 Northern Pike, but not more than two pike longer than 26 inches; and all from 22 to 26 inches must be released. Northern Pike taken by spearing follow the same rules except one pike may be between 22 and 26 inches or two larger than 26 inches. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie abundance in 2021 was moderate in trapnets (3.92 fish/trapnet) and gillnets (2.33 fish/gillnet). Black Crappie average size was moderate in trapnets (0.52 pounds, 9.34 inches), but large in gillnets (0.96 pounds, 11.86 inches). <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch abundance in 2021 was low (4.33 fish/gillnet). The 2016 Yellow Perch abundance was moderate (19.50 fish/gillnet). The 2007 Yellow Perch abundance was 28.50 fish/gillnet. The 2021 Yellow Perch size was large (0.55 pounds and 10.29 inches) from gillnets. The Yellow Perch catch rate of quality size (10.00 plus inches) was 2.67 fish/gillnet in 2021. The largest Yellow Perch capture was 12.40 inches in 2021. Yellow Perch growth rates were generally above the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-7. The 2019 year class comprised 29% of the 2021 Yellow Perch survey catch. The 2015 year class comprised 17% of the 2021 Yellow Perch survey catch. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance in 2021 was high (40.33 fish/gillnet). The 2016 Walleye abundance was also high (39.50 fish/gillnet). The 2007 Walleye abundance was 9.25 fish/gillnet. The 2021 Walleye average size was moderate (1.03 pounds and 14.17 inches) from gillnets. The Walleye catch rate of quality size (15.00 plus inches) was 4.33 fish/gillnet in 2021. Walleye growth rates were below the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-3, within the normal ranges for ages 4-5 and above the normal ranges for ages 6-8. The 2018 year class comprised 86% of the 2021 Walleye survey catch. Local anglers reported excellent success catching Walleye during the 2016-17 and 2020-2021. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye natural reproduction is generally insignificant in Minnetaga. Walleye movement in or out of Minnetaga is possible with connected Kasota and Wakanda Lakes. Walleye fry (about 770,000 fry per year) were stocked into Minnetaga from 2008 2012, 2014 and 2016. Private strain Walleye (400,000 fish) were stocked in 2017. Approximately 1.1 million Pike River strain Walleye fry were stocked into Minnetaga during 2018. In 2021, 593,837 Spicer strain Walleye fry were stocked into Minnetaga. Walleye fry stocked in Minnetaga were of Spicer strain in 2014, but Pike River strain in 2016. Young of year \"YOY\" (fingerling sized) Walleye abundance was high (226.16 YOY/hour, 5.81 inches) in the 2018 fall electrofishing survey. YOY Walleye abundance was low in 2017 (16.36 YOY/hour, 5.19 inches) and 2016 (4.00 YOY/hour, 6.85 inches). YOY Walleye numbers were abundant (192.00 YOY/hour, 5.86 inches) in the 2014 fall electrofishing survey. No fall electrofishing surveys were conducted in 2011-2012 due to poor access and low water conditions.  <br> \n <br> \nBlack Bullhead abundance in 2021 was low (1.17 fish/trapnet). Black Bullhead abundance was also low in 2016 (4.25 fish/trapnet. The 2021 Black Bullhead gillnet catch rate was also low (1.67 fish/gillnet). The 2007 Black Bullhead catch rates were 3.67 fish/trapnet and 36.00 fish/gillnet. The 2021 Black Bullhead average weights were large from trapnets (1.22 pounds) and moderate from gillnets (0.59 pounds).  <br> \n <br> \nCommon Carp trapnet abundance in 2021 was high (4.42 fish/trapnet). The 2021 Common Carp gillnet abundance was moderate (2.33 fish/gillnet). Common Carp abundance in 2016 was 15.17 fish/trapnet and 16.50 fish/gillnet. The 2007 Common Carp catch rates were 3.67 fish/trapnet and 7.25 fish/gillnet. The 2021 Common Carp average sizes were large from trapnets (7.41 pounds and 24.80 inches) and moderate from gillnets (5.21 pounds and 20.97 inches). <br> \n <br> \nWhite Sucker abundance in 2021 was high (19.67 fish/gillnet). Bigmouth Buffalo abundance in 2021 was low (0.75 fish/trapnet). <br> \n <br> \nCurrent fish management activities on Minnetaga include monitoring winter dissolved oxygen levels, protecting aquatic vegetation through the permit process, assisting aquatic plant management and enforcement personnel in educating boaters and monitoring access sites for potential invasive species introductions, encouraging landowners to implement best management practices in the watershed, and stocking various fish species as warranted. All fish species will be sampled in 2026. Fall electrofishing surveys may be conducted during Walleye fry stocked years to assess the success or failure of the stockings. <br> \n</p>",
