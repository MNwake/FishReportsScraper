                "narrative": "<p>Jack Lake is a 142-acre lake with 2.50 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 110 feet located southeast of Walker, Minnesota. A county-owned public access is located on the west shore. The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MNDNR) has classified Minnesota lakes into 43 different classes based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics. Jack Lake is in Lake Class 23; lakes in this class are generally very deep and very clear. Other area lakes in this class include Baby, Mule, Grave, and Ponto. Jack Lake is connected to Leech Lake through an unnavigable wetland. Jack Lake is entirely within the Chippewa National Forest and Leech Lake Indian Reservation. A majority of the shoreline is publicly owned and undeveloped. The lake is primarily managed for Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, and Bluegill and secondarily for Black Crappie and Tullibee (Cisco). <br> \n <br> \nJack Lake has a moderate population of Northern Pike (6.7 fish per net) with an average length and weight of 22.2 inches and 2.4 pounds. Northern Pike ranged from 17 to 29 inches. Bluegill are abundant, but small in size with most fish below 6 inches; lengths ranged from 3 to 8.0 inches. Few Largemouth Bass were sampled as no electrofishing was conducted. Bass ranged in length from 7 to 19 inches, with an average length and weight of 14.1 inches and 1.9 pounds. Other species sampled included Black Crappie, Bowfin (Dogfish), Tullibee (Cisco), Hybrid Sunfish, Walleye, Yellow Bullhead, and Yellow Perch, Rock Bass, and Pumpkinseed.    <br> \n <br> \nPeople can have significant impacts on lakes and the fish populations they support. Harvest, lakeshore development, removal of shoreline vegetation, and introductions of invasive species can all adversely affect fish populations. Currently, no aquatic invasive species (AIS) have been identified in Jack Lake. AIS are moved from infested to non-infested waters by anglers, boaters, and lakeshore owners and can adversely impact lakes and fish populations. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access. If you suspect an infestation of an invasive species in this lake, save a specimen and report it to a local natural resource office. Additional information on all of these topics can be found on the DNR website (www.dnr.state.mn.us) or by contacting the Walker Area Fisheries office. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Jack Lake is a 201-acre lake with a maximum depth of 110 feet.  Approximately 22% of the lake is 15 feet or less in depth.  The lake is located three miles south and four miles east of Walker.  The lake is connected to Leech Lake through a unnavigable wetland.  The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different lake classes based on physical and chemical characteristics.  Jack Lake is in lake class 23.  Lakes in this class are typically small to medium in size, deep, and have good water clarity.  Other area lakes in the same lake class include Baby, Big Deep, Hay, and Ponto Lakes.  The lake is entirely within the Chippewa National Forest and Leech Lake Indian Reservation.  With the exception of three private parcels, the shoreline is publicly owned and undeveloped.  Cass County has a concrete public access on the west side off of Forest Road 2666.  The lake is known for bluegill, black crappie, largemouth bass, and northern pike fishing.Bluegill abundance was typical of other lakes in this lake class.  The average size of bluegill in the 1999 sampling was down from 1994.  Bluegill in this lake class grow slowly, slightly less than an inch a year.  To maintain or improve the quality, anglers need to use some restraint if large bluegill are really biting, releasing the larger bluegill and keeping the smaller ones for eating.  Quality size bluegill have disappeared from many lakes due to excessive harvest by anglers.Northern pike are abundant in Jack Lake.  As with bluegill, the average size of northern pike decreased compared to previous surveys.  Fish sampled showed a wide range of lengths and ages indicating that they were consistently spawning.  Two and three year old northern pike were the most common ages sampled.  Fish were growing at a rate that was typical of other similar area lakes.  At five years old, northern pike were 25 inches long.Though not abundant, walleye are present in Jack Lake.Small numbers of largemouth bass and black crappie were sampled, however, angling is reportedly good for these species.Other species collected include cisco, pumpkinseed sunfish, yellow perch, rock bass, and yellow bullhead.Because of quality habitat, the fish populations in Jack Lake can maintain their abundance without stocking.  However, angler harvest is decreasing the number of quality size northern pike and bluegill.  Anglers can help maintain or improve the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for table fare, but encourages release of medium to large size fish.  Releasing these fish will help maintain quality fish populations in Jack Lake and will provide anglers with opportunities to catch more and larger fish in the future.  Large fish can help maintain balance in the fish community.Shorelines-on the land and into the shallow water-provide essential habitat for fish and wildlife that live in or near Minnesota's lakes.  Overdeveloped shorelines can't support the fish, wildlife, and clean water that are associated with natural undeveloped lakes.  The combined effects of all lakeshore owners \"fixing up\" their property can destroy a lake's valuable shorelines.Shoreline habitat consists of aquatic plants, woody plants and natural lake bottom soils.  Plants in the water and at the water's edge provide habitat, prevent erosion and absorb excess nutrients.  Shrubs, trees, and woody debris such as fallen trees or limbs provide good habitat both above and below the water and should be left in place.  Natural lake bottom materials like silt or gravel are more ecologically productive than pure sand trucked in for a swimming beach.  A tidy lawn and a sandy beach make great spots for sunbathing and swimming but do little to provide habitat for fish and wildlife.  By leaving a buffer strip of natural vegetation along the shoreline, property owners can reduce erosion, help maintain water quality, and provide habitat and travel corridors for wildlife.Only if more lakeshore owners manage their shoreline in a natural condition can fish and wildlife populations on Minnesota lakes remain healthy and abundant.  More specific information on protecting or restoring shorelines and watersheds is available through DNR Fisheries offices.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Jack Lake is a 200 acre lake located approximately 7 miles east of Walker in the Chippewa National forest downUSFS trail #2666. Much of the land surrounding the lake is owned by the Indian Trust Lands and Cass County.Private ownership is limited and has resulted in little development on the Lake.  In order to maintain the waterquality and integrity of the fisheries, it would be important that the shoreline be maintained in this undevelopedstate.Northern pike historically have been sampled in relatively low numbers but have displayed an average size thatwould interest most anglers. Because of the extremely sharp drop offs surrounding Jack Lake, it is difficult tosample fish relative to their abundance. Age and growth analysis  revealed many year classes indicating adequatenatural reproduction. A considerable amount of classic spawning habitat was observed, especially on the north endof the lake. Northern pike growth was good when compared to other area lakes.Bluegill continue to be sampled at rates similar to previous surveys and have maintained a nice average size. This hasn't been the case on other area lakes where fishing pressure has reduced the average size of many fishspecies.Largemouth bass and black crappie were sampled in moderate numbers.  Local anglers report experiencing goodangling for both of these species with quality size fish of both species being caught. Spring trapnetting afterice-out could possibly be used to obtain better samples of these two important species.Other species sampled included: bowfin, cisco (tullibee), yellow bullhead, rock bass, pumpkinseed and yellowperch. All of these species were sampled at rates within historical ranges. No walleyes were captured in ourtestnets for 1994, however, anglers have stated they have seen them when out angling.Yellow bullhead was the only bullhead species captured in our nets and were captured in low numbers.  Yellowbullhead is a good indicator of good water quality when they are the only bullhead or the dominant bullhead inthe lake.To maintain and promote a healthy fish population on Jack Lake, lake shore residents and other users of the lakeshould protect fish habitat by preserving natural lake bottoms and aquatic vegetation.  Lake shore residents canalso help preserve Jack Lake's water quality by such actions as having a properly built and maintained septicsystem; by avoiding the use of lawn or garden chemicals near the lake; and by establishing a buffer strip ofnatural vegetation along their shoreline.  Anglers can help maintain fishing quality by practicing \"Catch andRelease\" of larger fish.    </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Jack Lake is a 142-acre lake located near Walker, Minnesota that has 2.50 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 110 feet.  There is a county-owned public access on the west shore.  The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MNDNR) has classified Minnesota lakes into 43 different classes based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics.  Jack Lake is in Lake Class 23; lakes in the class are generally very deep and very clear.   <br> \n <br> \nJack Lake has a good population of northern pike, ranging from 16 to 29 inches.  The abundance of northern pike caught compared favorably to other lakes in this class.  Jack Lake has an abundant population of bluegill.  Average length of these fish was about 6 inches, though bluegill about 8 inches were sampled. Pumpkinseed sunfish and rock bass numbers compared well with numbers found in other lakes of this class.   Other species present included black crappie, bowfin (dogfish), brown bullhead, burbot (eelpout), cisco (tullibee), hybrid sunfish, largemouth bass, walleye, yellow bullhead and yellow perch.    <br> \n <br> \nAnglers can help maintain or improve the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for table fare, but encourages release of medium- to large-sized fish.  Releasing these fish can help maintain balance in the fish community in Jack Lake and provide anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future.   <br> \n <br> \nShoreline areas on the land and into the shallow water provide essential habitat for fish and wildlife that live in or near Minnesota\u0019s lakes.  Overdeveloped shorelines can\u0019t support the fish, wildlife, and clean water that are associated with natural undeveloped lakes. Shoreline habitat consists of aquatic plants, woody plants and natural lake bottom soils. <br> \n <br> \nPlants in the water and at the water\u0019s edge provide habitat, prevent erosion and absorb excess nutrients. Shrubs, trees, and woody debris such as fallen trees or limbs provide good habitat both above and below the water and should be left in place.  By leaving a buffer strip of natural vegetation along the shoreline, property owners can reduce erosion, help maintain water quality, and provide habitat and travel corridors for wildlife.</p>",

THE CPUE OF NORTHERN PIKE WAS LOWER THAN MOST LAKES IN THE AREA. THE SAMPLE COLLECTED LACKED SMALL FISH, BUT LARGER FISH UP TO 30 INCHES WERE PRESENT. GROWTH RATES ARE NEAR AVERAGE. ALL THREE SPECIES OF BULLHEADS WERE COLLECTED BUT DO NOT APPEAR OVERLY ABUNDANT. ROCK BASS APPEAR TO BE FAIRLY ABUNDANT. BLUEGILL CPUE HAS INCREASED DRAMATICALLY FROM EARLIER ASSESSMENTS FROM NEAR 1.0/TN IN 1954 AND 1980 TO 60/TN IN 1988. JACK LAKE IS DIFFICULT TO TRAPNET BECAUSE OF ABUNDANT MANNER DURING THIS ASSESSMENT WHICH MAY BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE IN- CREASE IN TN CPUE. TWENTY-FIVE PERCENT OF THE MEASURED BLUEGILLS WERE GREATER THAN 7 INCHES IN LENGTH. GROWTH RATES WERE NEAR AVERAGE. LARGEMOUTH BASS WERE COLLECTED IN FAIR NUMBERS AND RANGED IN LENGTH FROM 5 TO 16 INCHES. ONLY ONE BLACK CRAPPIE WAS COLLECTED. YELLOW PERCH AND WALLEYE DO NOT APPEAR TO BE ABUNDANT - CPUE'S OF 5.6/GN AND 0.8/GN RESPECTIVE- LY. THE WALLEYE ARE THE RESULT OF NATURAL REPRO- DUCTION WITHIN JACK LAKE OR EMIGRATION FROM LEECH LAKE.</p>",

ACCORDING TO LOCAL REPORT, FISHING DURING THE SUMMER OF 1954 WAS POOR FOR ALL SPECIES EXCEPT ROCK BASS.  FISHING OBSERVED ON JACK LAKE WAS PRINCIPALLY TROLLING FOR NORTHERN PIKE.  ACCORDING TO LOCAL REPORT, THE LAKE AT ONE TIME (3-5 YEARS AGO) WAS NOTED FOR EXCELLENT BLUEGILL AND CRAPPIE FISHING WHICH HAS DWINDLED TO A VERY SMALL PORTION OF PAST HARVEST.  THE LAKE APPEARS TO BE USED VERY LITTLE BY ANGLERS.IN 1946, 80,000 WALLEYE FRY WERE STOCKED INTO JACK LAKE.  THERE ARE NO RECORDS OF FISH REMOVAL OPERATIONS ON THIS LAKE.NO RECORDS OF ANY SPECIAL REGULATIONS, SPECIAL PROJECTS OR ACTIVITIES BEING CARRIED ON IN CONNECTION WITH THIS LAKE.JACK LAKE IS A SMALL, DEEP HARDWATER LAKE OF LOW FERTILITY.  AT PRESENT IT SUPPORTS A SATISFACTORY NORTHERN PIKE AND ROCK BASS POPULATION COMBINED WITH A LARGE HARVESTABLE TULLIBEE POPULATION.IT IS PROBABLE THAT BOTH 1953 AND 1954 WERE YEARS OF GOOD NATURAL REPRODUCTION OF NORTHERN PIKE IN THIS LAKE.  THESE FISH WILL REACH CATCHABLE SIZE DURING 1955 AND 1956.THIS LAKE SHOWS NO PROMISE FOR MANAGEMENT FOR WALLEYES.BASS AND PANFISH POPULATIONS, OTHER THAN ROCK BASS, APPEAR LOW AND SHOULD RECEIVE MANAGEMENT EMPHASIS.</p>",
