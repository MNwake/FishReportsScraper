SHOWS A SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER CATCH IN 1981 THAN IN 1976. A PERMIT WAS ISSUED IN 1979 TO STOCK 12-16' NORTHERN PIKE IN SWEENEY LAKE. IT IS ASSUMED THAT THIS WAS DONE AND THAT THE FISH WOULD BE OF THAT YEAR CLASS. ASSUMING SUCH TO BE THE CASE, A SUBSTANTIAL NUMBER OF THE 1978 YEAR CLASS ( II ANNULUS) FISH WERE FOUND IN THE NETTING. A SLIGHTLY SMALLER NUMBER OF THE 1978 YEAR CLASS (III ANNULUS) FISH WERE ALSO FOUND. THESE FISH COULD BE ATTRIBUTED TO:  DIFFICULTIES IN AGING, A PRIVATE STOCKING IN 1980 WITHOUT PERMIT,  NATURAL REPRODUCTION, OR A 1979 STOCKING OF 2 YEAR CLASSES. GROWTH AT II AND III ANNULUS WAS FAST. CARP, BLACK BULLHEAD, PUMPKINSEED AND WHITE CRAPPIE NUMBERS PER TRAPNET LIFT INDICATE THAT LOW POPUALTIONS OF THESE SPECIES ARE PRESENT IN SWEENEY'S LAKE COMPARED TO LOCAL MEDIAN CATCHES WHITE SUCKER, YELLOW BULLHEAD, BLACK CRAPPIE AND YELLOW PERCH NET CATCHES INDICATE POPULATIONS AVG FOR THIS AREA. BLACK CRAPPIE CATCHES IN THE 1976 NETTING WOULD GIVE THE IMPRESSION OF A LOW POP. COMPARED TO LOCAL LAKES. IT CAN BE ASSUMED THERE HAS BEEN AN INCREASE IN THE POPULATION. THE 1981 LENGTH FREQUENCY DISTRIBUTION ALSO INDICATES THIS WITH MORE SMALLER FISH BEING PRESENT THAN IN 1976 WHEN NONE WERE. FROM A STATISTICAL VIEWPOINT, A SIGNIFICANT DECLINE IN THE YELLOW PERCH POP. CAN BE SAID TO HAVE OCCURRED, THIS IS PROBABLY EXPLAI- NED BY THE INCREASE IN THE NORTHERN PIKE POPULA- TION WHICH CAN BE EXPECTED TO FORAGE HEAVILY ON PERCH. AN APPARENT ANOMALY EXISTS IN THE GILLNET CATCH FOR SWEENEY LAKE. A CATCH OF EIGHT GIZZARD SHAD IN THE GILLNETS IS TOTALLY UNEXPECTED FOR THIS LAKE. THE SURVEY CREW MEMBERS WERE THOROUGHLY FAMILIAR WITH FISH IDENTIFICATION AND HAD SEEN CONSIDERABLE NUMBERS OF GIZZARD SHAD IN THEIR PRE- VIOUS WORK EXPERIENCE. WITH THE POSSIBILITY OF MISIDENTIFICATION RULED OUT, IT CAN ONLY BE ASSUMED THAT GIZZARD SHAD WERE ILLEGALLY INTRO- DUCED INTO THE LAKE BETWEEN 1976 AND 1981 BY A PERSON OR PERSONS UNKNOWN. NO CLOSE DIRECT CONNEC- TION VIA AN OUTLET EXISTS BETWEEN SWEENEY LAKE AND WATERS IN WHICH GIZZARD SHAD NORMALLY OCCUR. IT SEEMS UNLIKELY THAT THESE FISH WILL BE ABLE TO MAINTAIN A PERMANENT POPUALTION IN SWEENEY LAKE.</p>",
