                "narrative": "<p>Pickeral Lake is a Class 28 lake and is compared with similar lakes including Walker Brook, Falk, Lone, Lomond and Deep in Clearwater County.  These lakes are generally small, deep, have clear water, and a regular shoreline.  There are 125 lakes in this class with most in the north central lakes region.  This is primarily a bass, panfish lake.  Secondary management of walleye and northern pike is suggested in the 1984 lake management plan.Bluegill are very abundant with probably slow growing fish.  About 23% of the bluegill sampled were more than 6 inches in length with the largest at 8.1 inches.  Less than 1% were more than 8 inches in length.  Black crappie were sampled at 1.6 per trap net.  The mean for this lake class is 1.9  The size is smaller than average at 0.2 pounds per fish.  About 15% of the crappie sampled were greater than 10 inches in length with the largest at 10.5 inches.Largemouth bass are abundant though the average size sampled was 8.2 inches.  The largest bass captured was less than 15 inches in length.Walleye were sampled at low numbers with all of the fish aged at 7-9 years of age.  The mean weight was 2.8 pounds with the largest at 7.3 pounds and 27.3 inches in length.  Walleye may be from fingerling stocks in 1984 and 1986 though 1985 fish were aged.  The chance for aging error increases with older fish.Northern pike were sampled at about average numbers but they are larger than average with a 3.8 pound mean. The largest pike sampled was 31.4 inches in length and weighed 7.8 pounds.  Yellow perch are abundant with a mean length of 7.3 inches. About 30% of the perch were over 8 inches in length and 37% of the perch had yellow grub present with a few having neascus.Rock bass, pumpkinseed and hybrid sunfish are all found in high numbers though the size is generally small.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Pickerel Lake is a small (123 acres) deep (60 feet) lake located in southern Clearwater County.  There is a user developed access located on the east side of the lake located one mile north of state highway 113.  At the time of the survey, the road leading to the access was in poor condition with some of the road under water.  These conditions are the result of a water level increase of 10 feet since 1994.The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different lake classes based on physical and chemical characteristics.  Pickerel Lake is in lake class 28.  Other area lakes in the same lake class include Bungo, Deep, First, Johnson and Lomond Lakes.  Typically lakes in this lake class are small, deep, clear lakes with regular shaped shorelines.  The lake is managed for black crappie, largemouth bass, bluegill and northern pike.Because the water level has increased by approximately 10 feet since the previous assessment, there are many drowned trees along the shoreline providing much structure to fish.  This is excellent fish habitat for a multitude of fish species.Anglers can expect a low density population of northern pike that are of quality size.  In 2004 pike sampled displayed a wide range of lengths from 21 to 38 inches with an average length and weight of 27 inches and 5 pounds.  This is an excellent example of a population where \"fewer are better.\"  Low density pike populations tend to have better growth rates and more quality potential.  They are also more vulnerable to over harvest since the population is made up of fewer but larger fish.  Voluntary release of larger northern pike 24 inches and above is strongly encouraged.There is an abundant population of black crappie that are currently of small size.  Few crappie were sampled in 2004 longer than 10 inches.  Bluegill is another member of the sunfish family that are common in Pickerel Lake.  Historically, the lake has had a reputation of producing lots of small bluegill.  In 2004 no bluegill were sampled that were greater than 8 inches long.A dramatic rise in water level and flooding of shoreline timber has greatly increased structure for largemouth bass.  Specialized sampling determined that there is an abundant population of this popular species.  Bass sampled ranged in length from 7 to 16 inches with an average length of 12 inches.Yellow perch are abundant and are the most important forage for northern pike.  This species will be of little interest to anglers since few fish were sampled that were greater than 8 inches long.Other fish sampled include white sucker, brown bullhead, green sunfish, rock bass and hybrid sunfish.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Pickerel Lake is a 123-acre lake with a maximum depth of 60 feet located in southern Clearwater County.  The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different lake classes based on physical characteristics, water chemistry and fish community.  Pickerel Lake is in Lake Class 28 along with Bungo, Deep, First, and Lomond lakes in Clearwater County.  Lakes in this class are typically small, deep, infertile lakes with clear water and round basins.  During the 1990s and early 2000s the water level of Pickerel Lake rose approximately 10 feet, which flooded shoreline timber and inundated the public water access, which was located on the southeast shore of the lake at the end of Pine Island Lake Road north of State Highway 113.  Currently, the access is difficult for larger boats with little room to turn around or park and is more suited to smaller or non-motorized watercraft.  Most of the shoreline of the lake is undeveloped, with a small number of lakeside homes and cabins.  Pickerel Lake is managed for Black Crappie, Largemouth Bass, Bluegill, and Northern Pike.  Due to the low fertility of the lake, growth rates of most fish species are slow, which can limit the maximum size they are able to achieve.     <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie catch rates in both gill nets and trap nets (6.83/gill net and 3.38/trap net) were above average when compared to other lakes of similar size and type, indicating that Pickerel's crappie population is fairly abundant.  The average size of Black Crappie captured in trap nets (9.7 inches in length and 0.49 lbs/fish) was similar to that of other Class 28 lakes.  Black Crappie up to 11.77 inches in length were captured in the 2014 assessment.  The extensive flooded timber and aquatic vegetation found within the lake provides excellent habitat for all species present including Black Crappie.   <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass are abundant in the lake as well, with a gill net catch rate (2.5/gill net) above the normal range for Lake Class 28 lakes.  The average size of Largemouth Bass captured (11.94 inches in length and 1.04 lbs/fish) was also similar to other Class 28 lakes.  Bass up to 15.39 inches in length were captured in the assessment.  Largemouth Bass utilize Bluegill as their primary forage species in Pickerel Lake.   <br> \n <br> \nWhile Pickerel Lake has been known for an overabundant Bluegill population dominated by small fish, the 2014 assessment showed some improvement in the population since the previous assessment in 2004. The Bluegill catch rate of 21.13/trap net declined considerably from 2004 (35.56/trap net) and was within the normal range for lake class (14.25/gill net to 40.45/gill net).  Average size was also similar at 0.17 lbs/fish.  The largest Bluegill captured was 8.35 inches in length.  A majority of the Bluegill catch was between 5.5 inches and 7.0 inches in length.  Twenty percent of the Bluegill captured were greater than 7 inches in length.  Slow growth rates are a limiting factor in the production of quality-size Bluegill in Pickerel Lake. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike were captured at a rate of 6/gill net, which is just above the median value of 5/gill net for Lake Class 28 lakes.  Unlike many area lakes, Pickerel still holds a Pike population that is not dominated by lots of small \"hammer handle\" fish, although there has been a considerable decrease in average size of Northern Pike since the 2004 assessment.  In 2004, the average size of Pike captured was a very respectable 27.47 inches in length and 5.09 lbs/fish.  Average size declined to 21.9 inches in length and 2.7 lbs/fish in 2014.  The largest Northern Pike captured in the 2014 assessment was 35.63 inches in length.  Twenty five percent of Northern Pike captured in the assessment were greater than 24 inches in length. Unlike bass and panfish, Northern Pike grow quickly in Pickerel Lake, with growth rates above those measured in similar lakes, resulting in the potential to produce larger fish.   <br> \n <br> \nOther species of fish captured in the 2014 assessment of Pickerel Lake were Yellow Perch, Rock Bass, Hybrid Sunfish, White Sucker, and Brown Bullhead.      <br> \n</p>",
