                "narrative": "<p>Big Swan Lake is a 918 acre lake with a maximum depth of 45 feet.  Water clarity was fair for the end of July with a secchi disk reading of 5 feet.  The lake supports a diverse fish community that attracts anglers seeking walleye, northern pike, largemouth bass, bluegill, and black crappies.  Fish habitat varies from sunken islands to extensive vegetation beds with a signficant amount of the lakeshore remaining undeveloped.  Cattails and hardstem bulrush are common along the shore, while chara or muskgrass is the most abundant submerged plant species. Filamentous algae was also quite common around the lake.  The lake has up to 6 inlets and is the head of the Swan River.  Agriculture is a major land use in the lake's watershed.  Management goals for the lake focus on walleye, northern pike, and largemouth bass.     Several of Big Swan Lake's fish populations displayed significant changes from the last survey in 1996.  One change that occurred was in walleye abundance.  Abundance appears to have declined since the last survey, but remains within the normal range when compared to similar type lakes.  While a variety of sizes are available to anglers, the average size seen in the survey was 18 inches or just over 2 pounds.  Northern pike numbers continue to be high in Big Swan Lake which could be having a negative impact on the walleye and yellow perch populations.  A northern pike experimental regulation was implemented in 1997 restricting the harvest of fish over 24 inches in length.  The goal of the regulation was to improve size structure of the pike population while decreasing numbers.  While the pike population continues to be dominated by small pike, more fish exceeding 24 inches were sampled in 2000 than in 1996.  The average size of the pike seen in the 2000 survey was 22 inches as compared to 20 inches in 1996.       Big Swan Lake has been known to produce quality size bass up to 20 inches or 5+ pounds, however, the average size seen by most fishermen has been about 12 inches or 1 pound.  Bluegills displayed a significant increase in numbers since the last survey but remain within the normal range for this type of lake.  The average size seen in the summer survey was about 5 inches, however, bluegills up to 10 inches have been documented.  Fishermen target bluegills in mid-summer and early ice-up.  The summer survey also documented a significant increase in black crappie numbers.  Two strong year classes were produced in 1997 and 1998 and are from 5 to 9 inches in length.  These two year classes should provide good crappie fishing the next few years.  Yellow perch was one of the fish populations to show a decrease in numbers which could have a negative impact on the fish community in the lake.  Perch are an important food species for both northern pike and walleye.  They can also be instrumental in helping maintain a well balanced bluegill population with fast growing, quality individuals.  White suckers and tullibee are also present and provide an alternatve food source for the bigger predator fish.       Other fish species which can provide angling opportunities include black bullheads, bowfin or dogfish, brown bullheads, carp, hybrid sunfish, pumpkinseeds, rock bass, and yellow bullheads.  Although the yellow bullhead population increased in abundance, quality fish over 11 inches continue to be common.  The other two bullhead species also had individuals up to 14 inches in length measured.     Neascus or black spot was found on some northern pike, walleye, and yellow perch.  Neascus is a trematode or parasite that is usually found in the skin of the fish.  The life cycle of the parasite also includes snails and fish-eating birds, such as herons.  Skinning the fish removes most of the parasites and cooking will kill the rest.  Human cannot be infested.  No whitefish grubs or triaenophorus were found in the tullibees from the survey.     Compliance with the northern pike regulation is necessary for a quality and more balanced fish community.  Anglers are also encouraged to practice catch and release of the larger individuals in the other species to achieve a balanced fish community and potential for trophy fish.  Protecting and improving the water quality in Big Swan Lake should be a high priorty of the lake association and landowners around the lake.  Preservation of the emergent vegetation beds can improve water quality and protect valuable fish habitat.  Buffer strips along inlets and lakeshore property are encouraged to reduce nutrients entering the water.  Maintaining adequate septics, keeping grass clippings and raked leaves out of the lake, and the use of zero phosphorus lawn fertilizer will also help reduce nutrients entering the lake thus slowing algae and excess weed growth.     </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Big Swan Lake is a 918 acre lake with a maximum depth of 45 feet.  Water clarity was excellent at the time of survey, the best ever recorded for the lake at 18+ feet.  The good water clarity may be attributed to lack of rainfall since June.  The lake has up to 6 inlets with agriculture being the major land use in the watershed and lack of rain would reduce nutrients entering the lake via the inlets.      Big Swan Lake currently has a northern pike regulation which prohibits the possession of any northern pike over 24 inches.  The goal of the regulation is to improve the size structure of the pike population while decreasing numbers.  Northern pike numbers did show a decline from the last survey but continue to be high for the lake.  More big pike were seen in our survey and fishermen report seeing more big fish.  Size structure of the population looks good with over half of the pike caught in the survey over 24 inches or about 4 pounds with fish up to 35 inches seen.      Walleye numbers continue to be within the normal range for the lake type with a wide range of sizes available to the angler.  Average size in the survey was about 2.5 pounds with some trophy size fish up to 9 pounds observed.  Walleye stocking occurs in odd-numbered years and appears to be responsible for most of the fish in the population.  Some natural reproduction does occur but is believed to be insufficient to sustain the population at the desired level.  Big Swan Lake has been known to produce quality size largemouth bass up to 20 inches or 5+ pounds, however, the average size seen by most fishermen has been about 12 inches or 1 pound.      Yellow perch numbers rose slightly after a significant decline in 2000.  This is good news as they can be an important food species for both northern pike and walleye.  They can also be instrumental in helping maintain a well balanced bluegill population with fast growing, quality individuals.  The summer survey documented a significant decline in black crappie numbers from 2000 and most of the fish caught appeared to be from a single year class.  The present population level appears to be the norm for Big Swan Lake.  Two very strong years in 1997 and 1998 were responsible for the high crappie gillnet catch in 2000.  Bluegills have provided an important fishery for the area and while the fish averaged about 6 inches in the survey, bluegills up to 10 inches have been documented in the past.  It was common to see numerous fishing rigs at the access throughout the summer.      Other fish species present in the lake included black bullheads, bowfin or dogfish, brown bullheads, carp, hybrid sunfish, pumpkinseeds, rock bass, white sucker, and yellow bullheads.  Big Swan Lake would be an excellent choice for seeking quality size bullheads as fish over 11 inches were common in both the brown and yellow bullhead catches.    Compliance with the northern pike regulation is necessary for a quality and more balanced fish community.  Anglers are also encouraged to practice catch and release of the larger individuals of other species to achieve a balanced fish community and potential for trophy fish.  Protecting and improving the water quality in Big Swan Lake should be a high priority of the lake association and landowners around the lake.  Preservation of emergent vegetation beds can improve water quality and protect shorelines as well as valuable fish habitat.  Buffer strips along inlets and lakeshore property are encouraged to reduce nutrients entering the water.  Maintaining adequate septics, keeping grass clippings and raked leaves out of the lake, and the use of zero phosphorus lawn fertilizer will also help reduce nutrients entering the lake thus slowing algae and excess weed growth.  The Todd County Planning and Zoning office in Long Prairie has a good website which provides information for shoreland property owners.  (www.co.todd.mn.us/PlanningZoning/planning.htm)</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>      An ice-out assessment was conducted on Big Swan Lake to evaluate changes in the Northern Pike population due to long-standing protective regulations which will be up for review in 2017.  A 24-inch maximum regulation was implemented in 1997 and later modified in 2008 to a 24 - 36 inch protected slot with one over 36 inches allowed.  A six fish possession limit was added in 2013 after review of the regulation in 2012 and discussion with the Big Swan Lake Association.  Northern Pike data has been collected from thirteen ice-out assessments, four which were pre-regulation, 1993 to 1997, and nine after the regulation was enacted.  Methods have included a combination of lake survey trap nets, a modified lake survey trap net with two leads, standard 3' x 5' muskellunge trap nets, and large-frame trap nets.    <br> \n     This assessment included eight lake survey trap nets set in the lake and one to two nets set at the mouth of the inlet from Long Lake.  A double lead trap net was set at the mouth of the inlet on Monday, March 30 and lifted twice.  Later two nets were reset at the mouth of the inlet on Monday, April 6 with eight trap nets set in the lake on Tuesday, April 7.   Two of the nets were moved during the assessments and nets were removed after three lifts for a total of 34 lifts.  Scales and fin rays were taken from northern pike for age and growth data with a collection target of 100 males and 100 females.  Recaptured marked fish were not re-measured or counted.  Fish which were not used for aging were also marked for later identification.  There were thirteen males and two females recaptured during the 2015 ice-out assessment. <br> \n     Catches from the stream nets and lake nets were combined in the 2015 ice-out assessment.  A total of 440 Northern Pike were caught that ranged from 8.6 to 35.4 inches in length with a mean length of 20.6 inches and mean weight of 2.1 pounds.  One hundred ninety of the fish were females and 232 were males for a sex ratio of 1.2 M to 1 female.   Thirty-four percent (n=64) of the females exceeded 24 inches compared to 2% (n=5) of the males.    <br> \n        Ten year classes up to Age 11 were represented in the aged sample.  A strong year class from 2011 dominated the 2015 pike catch, comprising 41% of the total sample.  Female pike grew from 2.1 to 5.3 inches longer than males of the same age. <br> \n         The pike population in Big Swan Lake exhibited a trend of increasing size structure when looking at data from 2001 to 2005.  By 2001, the average length went from 18.7 inches (pre-regulation, 1997) to 21.6 inches and more 24-inch plus pike were observed.  The most desirable sample size structure was exhibited in the 2005 ice-out assessment.  Up to 50% of the total northern pike catch exceeded 24 inches with 41% of the female pike more than 30 inches in length and 2% of the females exceeding 36 inches.  Ice-out assessments after 2005 began showing a decline in Northern Pike quality.  While some quality pike are still being sampled in recent ice-out assessments, they represent a decreasing portion of the catches. (see attached Table 1.) <br> \n      Northern Pike gill net catches reflect some of the same results as ice-out assessments.  After the regulation was implemented in 1997, the pike gill net catch declined in both the 2000 and 2004 surveys.  The 2004 survey had the lowest Northern Pike catch (9.8/GN) for Big Swan Lake since 1958 and also displayed an improvement in the population size structure compared to earlier surveys.  The subsequent surveys in 2008 and 2012 showed an upward trend in pike abundance and a downward trend in pike quality.  (see attached Table 2.)  <br> \n      The 2012 Northern Pike gill net catch of 19.6/set (n=235) was both a significant increase from the 16.1/GN (n=193) catch of 2008 and a record high for Big Swan Lake.  The 2012 gill net catch was also more than twice the 75% quartile level of 9/GN for lake class 27.  Pike ranged from 13.7 to 34.8 inches in length with a mean length of 20.3 inches and mean weight of 2 pounds.  Fish exceeding 24 inches accounted for 15% (n=36) of the catch compared to 35% (n=67) in 2008 and 61% (n=71) in 2004.  Fewer female pike over 30 inches were caught in the 2012 survey, 3% (n=7), while in 2008, 6% (n=12) of the females exceeded 30 inches with 14% (n=17) in 2004.   <br> \n       Additional game fish species captured in the 2015 ice-out assessment included four Walleye and seven Largemouth Bass.  The Walleye ranged from 19.2 to 29.3 inches in length and the bass from 13.1 to 18.3 inches in length with four exceeding sixteen inches.   <br> \n       Ice-out assessments sometimes provide large catches of Black Crappie and Bluegill.  The 2015 assessment sampled 208 Black Crappie and 1,010 Bluegill.   All crappie were measured while Bluegill were subsampled.   The crappie ranged from 4.1 to 13.2 inches in length with 18% (n=38) more than nine inches in length.  Only two of the crappie exceeded 10.5 inches and those two were both over twelve inches in length.  The Bluegill measured between three and eight inches in length.  Small Bluegill dominated the catch as most (~76%) appeared to be between four and 5.5 inches with ~3% exceeding seven inches in length. <br> \n      Other fish species caught in the 2015 ice-out assessment included Bowfin, Brown Bullhead, Common Shiner,  Golden Shiner, Green Sunfish, hybrid sunfish, Pumpkinseed, Rock Bass, White Sucker, Yellow Bullhead, and Yellow Perch.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>     An ice-out assessment was conducted on Big Swan Lake to evaluate changes to the northern pike population after the implementation of a 24-inch maximum regulation in 1997.  The regulation was up for review in the fall of 2007 and the results of this and previous assessments was used to help determine whether to keep the regulation, modify it, or drop it entirely.  After a public input meeting in September 2007, the decision was made to modify the regulation to a 24 - 36 inch protected slot with one over 36 inches allowed.   This modified regulation will be in effect until March 1, 2013.  Northern pike data from ice-out assessments had been collected annually on Big Swan Lake three years prior to the regulation and in odd numbered years after the regulation went into effect.  Methods have included a combination of lake survey trapnets, modified lake survey with two leads, and large-frame muskie trapnets.  This assessment included two standard lake survey nets set at the mouth of the inlet from Long Lake before ice-out in the lake and 10 lake survey trapnets in the lake after ice-out.  The goal was to collect 100 scale samples from both male and female northern pike for age and growth analysis. Spines were also taken from the walleye for aging data.   All gamefish were measured along with the majority of black crappies and bluegills.  All other fish are identified and counted.  Lengths from recaptured fish were not included in the length frequency.  There were two northern pike recaptures and 8 walleye recaptures. <br> \n     The two stream nets were set in late March and lifted 3 times.  Two of the net lifts were not counted due to holes in the nets so data came from only 4 net lifts.  A total of 56 northern pike were caught which was the lowest catch for the stream sets. The sample size was inadequate for comparison and not indicative of the time and location.  The water level in the stream was low and unlike most springs, little flow was coming into the lake.  Catches of 231, 253, and 166 pike were collected in 2005, 2003, 2001, respectively.  Fish in the 2007 pike sample ranged from 9 to 35 inches in length with a mean length of 17.9 inches and modal length of 14 - 15 inches.  These were the smallest mean length and modal lengths recorded for stream samples.  Previous mean lengths ranged from 22.3 inches in 2001 to 25.6 inches in 2005 and modal lengths have been around 21 - 22 inches for the assessments.  Northern pike exceeding 24 inches in length comprised 12% (n=7) of the 2007 catch with 4% (n=2) over 30 inches in length.  These figures were also low when compared to previous assessments.  The assessment with the best size structure in the stream nets was 2005 which had 54% of the pike exceeding 24 inches with 25% exceeding 30 inches and 0.4% (n=1) more than 36 inches in length.   In 2003, 42% of the pike were over 24 inches with 8% over 30 inches in length.  In 2001, 27% of the pike measured over 24 inches with 8% over 30 inches.  None of the pike in the 2003 and 2001 stream catches exceeded 36 inches which is one of the desired outcomes of the regulation.  The 2007 stream nets the male pike outnumbered the females 3.5 to 1. <br> \n    Ice went out on Big Swan Lake in mid-April and 10 lake survey trapnets were set.  An evaluation of the walleye population was also desired so some nets were later moved to better walleye spawning habitat.  Northern pike netting can be difficult in the lake and catches have shown a wide variation in numbers, from 549 fish in 1999 to 45 fish in 2003.  The 2007 assessment netted 117 pike which was similar to the 122 pike catch in 2005.  The 2007 assessment did produce the largest northern pike caught to date at 38.4 inches with 3% (n=3) of the fish exceeding 36 inches.  Mean length for the sample was 21.8 inches which was shorter than the 24.3 inches in 2005 and 22.2 inches in 2003, but slightly better than the average length of 21 inches prior to the regulation.  The 2007 pike sample also displayed fewer fish over 24 and 30 inches than in 2005.  Northern pike exceeding 24 inches in length comprised 31% (n=36) of the catch with 8% (n=9) more than 30 inches compared to 44% (n=54) and 16% (n=19) in 2005, respectively.  However, only 2% (n=2) of the pike in the 2005 sample were over 36 inches in length.  Before the regulation, the 1995 assessment showed the most desirable population size structure with 23% of the sample exceeding 24 inches and 5% exceeding 30 inches.  No 36-inch pike were sampled in the spring assessments prior to 2005.  The sex ratio of female pike to male pike in the 2007 spring assessment was 0.9:1.  Ages 2 thru 9 were represented in the female portion of the catch and ages 2 thru 8 in the male portion.  Ages 2 thru 7 of the female sample displayed normal growth while the older fish showed fast growth.  Ages 2 and 3 of the male sample exhibited slow growth while the older fish displayed normal growth.  Two year classes from 2003 and 2004 accounted for 26% and 32% of the total catch, respectively.  A larger sample size is desired to show if real changes have occurred in the population. <br> \n     Since walleye are an important component of the fish community in the lake and data on the species would be needed for the public input meeting, extra effort was put into netting them.  A total of 107 walleye were netted which was the highest catch to date compared to catches of 50 walleye in both the 1999 and 1997 assessments.  Trophy size walleye over 28 inches in length have been sampled in all but three of the nine assessments.  In 2007, the fish measured from 15 to 30 inches in length with a mean length of 21.2 inches, a modal length of 20 - 21 inches, and 58% (n=62) of the walleye exceeding 20 inches.  Large adult fish have been prevalent in all of the assessments which would be expected for the time of year.  The 1999 assessment produced the lowest proportion of walleye over 20 inches (52%) while in the 2003 assessment all of the fish were over 20 inches (only 6 walleye caught).  When aging the spines, it was found that almost half of the male walleye were age four while the biggest age group for the females was  age six.  Ages 8 and 12 also accounted for major portions of the female sample.  While the strongest year classes came from stocked years, the presence of fish from non-stocked years indicates that some natural reproduction occurs. <br> \n     The lake nets also caught 511 black crappies which measured from 5 to 13.5 inches in length.  Mean length for the sample was 8.6 inches with a modal length of 5.5 - 6 inches.  Crappies exceeding 9 inches accounted for 47% (n=238) of the catch with 19% (n=96) more than 11 inches in length which indicates the lake supports a quality crappie fishery.  The bluegill catch totaled 702 fish between 3 and 9 inches in length with a mean length of 6 inches and modal length of 6.5 - 7 inches.  Bluegills over 7 inches in length made up 24% (n=165) of the sample while 4% (n=31) were over 8 inches in length.  A record number of largemouth bass was caught in the 2007 spring assessment, 210 bass were netted which was more than 4 times the previous record catch of 48 bass in 2003.  Trophy size bass over 18 inches have been observed in most of the spring assessments.  The bass catch in 2007  displayed some impressive features with fish measuring between 6 and 20 inches in length.  Mean length for the sample was 16 inches with a modal length of 16 - 17 inches.  PSD for the sample was 96 with an RSD of 86. <br> \n      Bowfin and white suckers were also very plentiful with 402 and 322 being caught, respectively.  The abundant sucker population likely provides an excellent prey base for the northern pike.  Yellow bullheads (n=204) were the most abundant of the three bullhead species, black bullheads (n=1) and brown bullheas (n=14). <br> \n      An area mean back-calculated length table was used to compare growth rates. <br> \nOther species caught included common carp, golden shiner, hybrid sunfish, pumpkinseed, rock bass, and yellow perch.  </p>",

AGE GROUPS II AND V DOMINATED THE CATCH COMPRISING 82% OF THE SAMPLE, AGE CLASS IV WAS CONSPICUOUSLY ABSENT IN THE SAMPLE AS 1500 POUNDS OF YEARLINGS WERE STOCKED IN 1988.  THE REASON FOR THE ABSENCE OF THIS YEAR CLASS IS UNKNOWN.  NO FISH WERE STOCKED CORRESPONDING TO AGE GROUPS III AND VI.  NORMAL GROWTH RATES WERE EVIDENT IN THE AGE GROUPS PRESENT.  NOP GILLNET CATCHES DID NOT CHANGE SIGNIFICANTLY EITHER AND REMAIN VERY HIGH AT 11.5/SET.  MEAN WEIGHT FELL FROM 2.21 LBS TO 1.97 LBS. AGE CLASSES I THROUGH VI WERE REPRESENTED AND DISPLAYED VARYING GROWTH RATES.  AGE GROUPS II DEMONSTRATED FAST GROWTH AND MADE UP 71% OF THE TOTAL CATCH.  YEP GILLNET CATCHES SHOWED A GROUPS II THROUGH VI WERE CAPTURED WITH AGE GROUPS II AND III COMPRISING 89% OF THE SAMPLE.  ALL AGE GROUPS HAD NORMAL GROWTH RATES.  THE BLG TRAPNET CATCH DECLINED ABOUT 50% FROM 84.38/SET TO 42.75/ SET.  MEAN WEIGHT REMAINED SMALL AT 0.10 POUNDS IN THE TRAPNETS, HOWEVER, GILLNET MEAN WEIGHT WAS 0.22 POUNDS.  ONLY 9% OF BLG CAPTURED WERE 7 INCHES OR LARGER.  AGE GROUPS I THROUGH VIII+ WERE PRESENT AND EXHIBITED NORMAL GROWTH RATES.  AGE GROUP III WAS THE PREVALENT CLASS MAKING UP 55% OF THE TOTAL CATCH.  THE TRAPNET CATCH FOR BLC ALSO FELL 50% SINCE 1986, HOWEVER, MEAN WEIGHT INCREASED FROM 0.22 POUNDS TO 0.38 POUNDS.  THE GILLNET CATCH IN CONTRAST ROSE FOR 1.50/SET. NORMAL GROWTH RATES WERE DISPLAYED BY THE AGE GROUPS PRESENT (II THROUGH V, VII).  AGE GROUPS II AND III ACCOUNTED FOR 73% OF THE FISH SAMPLED. LMB WERE EVALUATED BY SPRING ELECTROFISHING ALONG WITH THE SUMMER LAKE SURVEY NETTING.  ELECTRO- FISHING RESULTS SUGGESTED A RELATIVELY LOW POPULATION AS ONLY 12 FISH WERE CAPTURED.  (PSD 80) ALL AGE GROUPS I THROUGH VIII+ WERE PRESENT EXCEPT VI.  AGE CLASS II COMPRISED 55% OF THE TOTAL SAMPLE.  NORMAL GROWTH WAS EVIDENT.  THE NORTHERN CISCO GILLNET CATCH ROSE FROM 0.10/SET TO 1.30/SET SINCE 1986.  THIS IS THE HIGHEST SUMMER CATCH SINCE 1958.  ALL AGE GROUPS I THROUGH VI WERE FOUND EXCEPT FOR AGE IV.  AGE GROUP VI WAS PREDOMINANT MAKING UP 62% OF THE SAMPLE.  GROWTH RATES WERE FAST FOR AGE GROUPS II AND III, NORMAL FOR OTHER GROUPS.

                "narrative": "<p>     Big Swan Lake is a popular fishing lake west of the Town of Burtrum in Todd County.   The lake supports dense submerged vegetation as well as bulrush beds and a cattail fringe around the north basin and west shore of the south basin.  Big Swan Lake lies within an agricultural watershed, which after snow melt and rain events has been known to negatively affect water clarity in the lake.  The lake also has curly leaf pondweed, which adds to the mid-summer nutrient load.  Algae blooms during the summer are a common occurrence.  Coontail and flatstem pondweed were the most common submergent species found during the 2008 survey and sand the most common shallow water substrate.   Mats of filamentous algae and star duckweed were also common along shore.   <br> \n     The lake supports a diverse fish community that attracts anglers, including species such as walleye, northern pike, largemouth bass, bluegill, and black crappie.   There is a regulation on the lake prohibiting the possession of northern pike between 24 and 36 inches, with one over 36 inches allowed.  The goal of the regulation is to improve the size structure of the pike population while decreasing numbers.  Northern pike abundance, however, did show an increase since the last survey and appears to be at a record high.  Most of the pike observed in the survey were between 20 and 23 inches in length, however, fish over 36 inches are present.   <br> \n     Walleye stocking appears to sustain the fishery in Big Swan Lake and a wide range of sizes look to be available to anglers.  Average size in the survey was about 2 pounds but some trophy size fish have been observed.  Trophy size largemouth bass over 19 inches in length have also been observed in assessments, but the average size most anglers will catch is between 11 to 13 inches.  Yellow perch abundance appears to have increased since the last survey and although some anglers consider them to be pests, they can be an important food species for both northern pike and walleye.  Perch can also be instrumental in helping maintain a well-balanced bluegill population with fast growing, quality individuals.   <br> \n      Bluegill provide a popular summer fishery in the area at times.  Anglers report having good luck catching 6 to 7-inch bluegill and fish up to 10 inches have been found.  Winter seems to be the best time to find black crappies in Big Swan Lake.  Recent reports indicate the presence of a strong year class providing 8 to 10-inch crappie during the day thru the ice.  Both ice-out assessments and summer surveys have documented larger crappie over 12 inches.  Other panfish species in Big Swan Lake include pumpkinseed sunfish, rock bass, and hybrid sunfish. <br> \n     Big Swan Lake would also be an excellent choice for any angler seeking quality size bullhead.  All three species of bullhead are present in the lake and both the brown and yellow bullhead catches had individuals over 13 inches in length.  Bowfin or dogfish, common carp, and white sucker were also caught during the survey.  Carp numbers appear to be low at this time, while abundance of bowfin and white sucker was within the normal range when compared to similar type lakes. <br> \n     Along with the release of the larger northern pike, anglers are encouraged to catch and release the larger individuals of other species to achieve a balanced fish community and provide opportunity for trophy fish.  Improving the water quality in Big Swan Lake should be a high priority of the lake association and landowners around the lake.  Preservation of the emergent vegetation beds can help to improve water quality and protect shorelines as well as valuable fish habitat.  Buffer strips along inlets and lakeshore property would also help to reduce nutrients entering the lake.  Maintaining adequate septic systems, keeping grass clippings and raked leaves out of the lake, and the use of zero phosphorus lawn fertilizer are all ways for homeowners to help reduce added nutrients from entering the lake and contributing to excess algae and weed growth.   The Todd County Planning and Zoning Office in Long Prairie has a website which provides information for shoreland property owners. <br> \n(www.co.todd.mn.us/PlanningZoning/planning.htm) <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>       An ice-out assessment was conducted on Big Swan Lake to evaluate changes to the northern pike population due to a protective regulation.  A 24-inch maximum regulation was implemented in 1997 and later modified in 2008 to a 24 - 36 inch protected slot with one over 36 inches allowed.  The modified regulation will be in effect until March 1, 2013.  Northern pike data from ice-out assessments had been collected annually on Big Swan Lake three years prior to the regulation and in odd numbered years after the regulation went into effect.  Methods have included a combination of lake survey trapnets, a modified lake survey net with two leads, and large-frame trapnets.  This assessment included two lake survey trapnets set at the mouth of the inlet from Long Lake before ice-out on the lake and 12 lake survey trapnets in the lake after ice-out.  Lengths were taken from the gamefish as well as the black crappie and bluegill.  Scales and fin rays were collected from the northern pike for age determination.  All other fish species were identified and counted. <br> \n       The two stream nets were set in early April, laid down for the weekend after two lifts and reset.  The nets were again laid down after one lift and reset a day later for a total of eight lifts.  The stream nets captured 163 northern pike between 17.2 and 38.3 inches in length with a mean length of 22.9 inches.  The sex ratio for the fish was 1.3 males (n=91) to one female (n=72).  Sixty-one percent of the females (n=44) in the sample were more than 24 inches in length compared to only 2% of the males (n=2) with 11% (n=8) of the females exceeding 30 inches.  The lake nets captured only 83 pike which measured from 8.5 to 34.4 inches in length with a mean length of 20.7 inches.  Many of the female northern pike were ripe or already spent.   The sex ratio was 1.5 males (n=46) to one female (n=30).   Seven juvenile northern pike was also netted.  While a smaller portion of female pike were longer than 24 inches (50%; n=15), a greater portion were more than 30 inches (17%; n=5).  Six percent of the males (n=3) exceeded 24 inches in length.  When comparing the total catch from both gear types, 26% of the pike caught were more than 24 inches in length, 5% exceeded 30 inches, and 0.4% were over 36 inches.  By the end of the evaluation period, the goal is to have a catch where 20% of the female pike exceed 30 inches in length.  The long range lake management goal for Big Swan Lake is to have a spring trapnet catch with 40% or more the fish exceeding 24 inches in length and at least 5% more than 36 inches.   <br> \n       Of the assessments since implementation of the regulation, the 2005 netting produced the most desirable results.   A total of 353 northern pike were captured using two gear types.  The pike ranged from 9 to 37.2 inches in length.  Pike exceeding 24 inches in length accounted for 50% (n=179) of the catch, with 22% (n=77) of the fish more than 30 inches, and 0.8% (n=3) over 36 inches.  The 2005 assessment was also the first spring assessment to sample a northern pike over 36 inches in length.  Before 1997, the longest pike caught in the spring assessments was 33.1 inches.   In the 1995 assessment, where 62 northern pike were caught, 22% (n=14) of the fish were more than 24 inches in length with 5% (n=3) exceeding 30 inches.  Also before the regulation, it was rare to catch pike that were older than 6 years of age.  By 2003, fish up to 9 years of age were being sampled and 12% of the pike in the assessment were over 7 years of age.  Ages 1 thru 10 were represented in the 2009 spring assessment with the 2005 year class accounting for 37% of the sample. Only 3% of the fish were over 7 years of age.   The female northern pike were 1.4 to 5.2 inches longer than the males of the same age. <br> \n       The stream nets captured 14 walleye between 17 and 29 inches in length while the lake nets caught 31 walleye between 16 and 26 inches in length.  Walleye exceeding 20 inches accounted for 67% (n=30) of the combined catch.  Previous spring assessments have produced catches of six (2003) to 107 (2007) walleye.  The 2007 assessment included an effort to sample more walleye to evaluate the population size structure and gather data for the public input meeting on the pike regulation.  Large adult fish have been prevalent in all of the assessments which would be expected for the time of year.   The 2009 lake nets captured 79 largemouth bass which was second highest catch behind the 2007 catch of 210 bass.  Other catches have ranged from six bass in 1999 to 48 bass in 2003.  Fish in the 2009 sample measured from 7 to 19.5 inches in length with a mean length of 16.5 inches and modal length of 16 - 17 inches. <br> \n       The spring assessments can also produce good numbers of black crappie and bluegill.  The 2009 assessment caught only 49 crappies which was the third lowest catch of the 10 spring assessments.  Other catches have ranged from 43 crappie in 1994 to 560 crappie in 1997.  The black crappie in the 2009 assessment measured from 2.3 inches to 13.5 inches in length with a mean length of 9.3 inches.  Crappie exceeding 9 inches accounted for 53% (n=26) of the catch with 24% (n=12) more than 11 inches in length.  The 2009 bluegill catch of 172 fish was the fourth lowest of the spring assessments.  The 2005 assessment recorded only 11 bluegills while 702 were captured in 2007. The bluegill catch was dominated by small fish as only 18% (n=31) of the fish were over 7 inches and 3% (n=6) exceeded 8 inches in length.  Spring netting variability has not been a true test of crappie and bluegill abundance. <br> \n       Other fish species caught in the 2009 spring assessment included black bullhead, bowfin, brown bullhead, golden shiner, hybrid sunfish, pumpkinseed, rock bass, white sucker, yellow bullhead, yellow perch.  Both bowfin and white sucker have been abundant species in several of the ice-out assessments in Big Swan Lake.  Over one hundred bowfin have been caught in seven of the spring assessments  with the highest catch being 402 fish in the 2007 assessment.  There were 169 bowfin captured in the 2009 assessment.   White sucker have not been as abundant as the bowfin and the catch has been more variable between the assessments.  The highest catch was 322 sucker in 2007 and the lowest recorded was two sucker in 1995.  There were 93 white sucker netted in the 2009 assessment.  Bowfin and white sucker were not recorded in three of the assessments which suggests they were probably not counted. <br> \n       Spring ice-out assessments appear to be the most effective method for evaluating the northern pike population in Big Swan Lake, however, weather conditions in the spring can have a huge impact on netting results.  With cooler springs and late ice-out on lakes, most of the northern pike were found to have already spawned and the netting catches were typically low which was the case in both 2007 and 2009.  Low stream water conditions in 2007 also reduced the stream catch.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Big Swan Lake (DOW# 77-0023-00; Lake Class 27) is an 887 acre lake located near Burtrum, Minnesota. A Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MNDNR) owned concrete boat ramp is located on the southeast shore. Big Swan Lake has 8.11 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 45 Feet. The Lake is primarily managed for Walleye and Northern Pike and secondarily for Largemouth Bass, Bluegill, and Black Crappie. The lake was initially surveyed in 1958 and 33 fish sampling surveys or investigations have occurred since then with the most recent prior sampling in 2016 (standard survey). A targeted survey for Northern Pike was conducted on Big Swan Lake following ice out using trap nets. This survey was done in order to complete the evaluation of the Northern Pike special regulation on Big Swan Lake (24\"-36\" protected slot limit, 1 over 36\", 6 fish bag limit). The evaluation began in 1997 with a 24\" maximum regulation that was later modified in 2008 to a 24\"- 36\"protected slot with one over 36\" allowed. A six fish possession limit was added in 2013 after previous increases in gill net catch rates to nearly 20/net and review of the regulation in 2012. As of spring 2018 the 24\"-36\" protected slot limit, 1 over 36\", 6 fish bag limit was reclassified as a special regulation. <br> \n <br> \nA total of 266 Northern Pike were captured during the ice out survey with trap nets. The 2017 trap net catch rate was 11.57 fish/net night. The catch rate was similar to previous surveys in the last 10 years. The Proportional Size Distribution (PSD) from trap nets was 55 and the Proportional Size Distribution-Preferred (PSD-P) was 10. Size structure was unchanged from previous surveys showing no improvement from current regulation. However size structure has shown an improvement during the post regulation time period (2001-2017) compared to pre regulation time period (1993-1999). The percentage of 24\" (pre - 15%, post - 28%) and 30\" (pre -2%, post - 7%) fish has increased during the post regulation period with more incidences of 36\"+ fish.  The mean length of Northern Pike sampled was 21.98 inches with lengths ranging from 11.7 to 37.2 inches.  </p>",

LARGEMOUTH BASS WERE ALSO CAUGHT AT AVG RATES IN TRAPNETS AND GILLNETS BUT MORE ASSESSMENT IS NEEDED DUE TO BIAS OF NETTING METHODS. HIGH POPULATIONS WERE REFLECTED BY NET CATCHES FOR BOWFIN, NORTHERN PIKE, YELLOW BULLHEAD, PUMPKINSEED, AND BLUEGILL. HYBRID SUN- FISH CATCH RATES WERE ALSO ABOVE THE STATEWIDE MEDIAN CARP APPEARED TO BE IN VERY LOW NUMBERS. BLACK BULLHEAD AND ROCK BASS CATCHES WERE LOW IN TRAPNETS AND AVG IN GILLNETS. THIS SEEMS TO SUG- GEST LOW, POSSIBLY AVG, POPULATIONS PRESENT. TEN GILLNETS WERE SET IN JULY 1981 AND 1986. COMPARI- SON OF NET CATCHES FOR BOTH YEARS SHOWS NO SIGNI- FICANT CHANGE FOR NORTHERN PIKE, WALLEYE AND YELLOW PERCH POPULATIONS. NORTHERN PIKE AGED (78 OF 139 FISH REVEALED AGES I THROUGH IV. AGE II FISH WERE MOST PREVALENT AND EXHIBITED FAST GROWTH COMPARED TO STATEWIDE RATES. GROWTH RATES WERE AVG FOR AGES I, III, AND IV.  NO CHANGE IN POPULATION WAS DETECTED BY NET CATCHES. MEAN WEIGHTS WERE 1.5 AND 2.2 PDS IN 1981 AND 1986, RESPECTIVELY. LENGTHS RANGED FROM 12.0 - 25.9 INCHES IN 1981 AND 12.0 - 34.9 INCHES IN 1986. THE MEDIAN LENGTH GROUP INCREASED FROM 18.0 - 18.9 IN 1981 TO  19.0- 19.9 INCHES IN 1986. THE WALLEYE POPULATION SHOWED NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGE. LENGTHS RANGED FROM 9.5 TO 26.9 INCHES. YEAR CLASSES II, IV AND V WERE PRE- SENT, CORRESPONDING TO EVERY OTHER YEAR STOCKING OF FINGERLINGS. AGE VI FISH WERE ALSO PROBABLY PRESENT, BUT DUE TO EXTREME DIFFICULTY IN ACCURA- TELY AGING SCALES LARGER FISH WERE NOT AGED. GROWTH RATES WERE AVG FOR ALL AGES. MEAN WTS IN- CREASED FROM 1.6 TO 2.3 PDS. NORTHERN PIKE PREDATION MAY BE LOWERING THE RETURN OF STOCKED WALLEYES. YELLOW PERCH NUMBERS HAVE ALSO NOT SIGNIFICANTLY CHANGED. THE MEAN WEIGHT HAS DECREASED FROM 0.16 PDS TO 0.09 PDS. THE LENGTH FREQUENCY RANGED FROM 4.0 - 9.9 IN 1981 AND 3.5 - 7.9 INCHES IN 1986. THE MEDIAN LENGTH GROUP HAS DECREASED FROM 6.5 - 6.9 INCHES TO 6.0 - 6.4 IN 1986. THE WEIGHTED MEAN LENGTH HAS ALSO SHIFTED FROM 6.7 INCHES TO 5.7 INCHES. NET CATCHES SHOW A DISTINCT SHIFT TO SMALLER FISH. NO PERCH WERE TAKEN 8.0 INCHES OR GREATER IN 1986 WHILE 32% OF THE 1981 CATCH WERE FISH 8.0 INCHES OR GREATER. THIS MAY INDICATE PREDATION BY MORE LARGER NORTHERN PIKE AND WALLEYE NOW PRESENT THAN IN 1981. LARGEMOUTH BASS AGED (10 OF 10 FISH)  RE- VEALED AGE-CLASSES II, III AND IV PRESENT. GROWTH RATES WERE AVG IN ALL AGES. LENGTHS RANGED FROM 7.5 - 13.9 INCHES. BLACK CRAPPIE WERE EVIENCED BY A REDUCTION IN WT FROM 0.6 PDS TO 0.2 PDS. LENGTH FREQUENCY RANGES SHIFTED FROM 4.0 - 13.9 INCHES TO 4.5 - 10.9 INCHES AND MEDIAN LENGTH GROUPS FROM 10.0 - 10.4 INCHES TO 6.5 - 6.9 INCHES. ONLY 7% CRAPPIES MEASURED WERE 9.0 INCHES OR GREATER OPPOSED TO 56% IN 1981. BLUEGILL RANGED IN SIZE FROM 3.5 - 7.9 INCHES WITH A MEAN WT OF 0.1 PDS. ONLY 6.5% OF FISH MEASURED WERE 7.0 INCHES OR GREATER. THE TRAPNET CATCH RATE DRAMATICALLY INCREASED BY 1.083%. BLACK BULLLHEAD WEIGHTED MEAN LENGTHS DECREASED FROM 11.7 TO 9.3 INCHES AND MEAN WTS ALSO DECLINED FROM 1.3 TO 0.6 PDS. MEDIAN LENGTH GROUPS SHIFTED FROM 11.0 - 11.4 TO 9.0 -9.4 INCHES. YELLOW BULLHEAD WEIGHTED MEAN LENGTHS ALSO DECREASED, 10.6 TO 10.2 INCHES AND MEAN WEIGHTS DECLINED FROM 0.8 TO 0.6 PDS. MEDIAN LENGTH GROUPS SHIFTED FROM 10.5  - 10.9 TO 11.0 11.4 INCHES WITH A CORRESPONDING DECREASE IN MEAN WEIGHTS FROM 1.4 TO 1.0 PDS. THE WEIGHTED MEAN LENGTH ALSO SHIFTED FROM 12.8 TO 11.7 INCHES. COMMERCIAL REMOVAL (B PERMIT) WAS CONDUCTED IN 1981, 1982 AND 1986. THE PDS HARVESTED WAS 17,100; 3,700; AND 8,200 RESPECTIVELY. PUMPKINSEED CATCHES REFLECTED AN 85% INCREASE. LENGTHS RANGED FROM 3.0 - 7.4 INCHES. ROCK BASS NUMBERS APPEARED STABLE. LENGTHS RANGED FROM 6.0 - 10.4 INCHES. ROCK BASS 7.0 INCHES AND LARGER COMPRISED 81% OF THE CATCH.</p>",

Experimental/Special fishing regulations for Northern Pike have been in place on the lake since 1997, consisting of a 24 inch maximum size from 1997-2008, and a 24-36 inch protected slot from 2008-present.  The bag limit was increased to 6 fish in 2013. Only one pike over 36 inches is allowed.   The purpose of this trap net survey was to evaluate changes to the pike size structure since the regulations were enacted. <br> \n <br> \nMany of the fish captured during this survey were taken in nets set at mouth of the inlet from Long Lake.  Two trap nets are set at this site essentially blocking fish from travel up the inlet.  Eight nets were also set at sites throughout the lake basin.  The lake nets were set in ice-free locations and produced light catches of pike, presumably due to the late ice-out.   All Northern Pike, Walleye, Largemouth Bass, Bluegill, and Black Crappie were measured.   <br> \n <br> \nA total of 165 Northern Pike were netted in the 2022 ice-out assessment.  Similar ice-out efforts were conducted during 14 separate years from 1993 to 2017 producing sample sizes of 61 to 549 fish (mean=295).  The total number sampled is not a good indicator of population level due to variability in both effort and spring weather.  The catch in 2022 was characterized by 24% of the fish exceeding 24 inches and only 6 fish (3.6%) over 30 inches were observed.  Mean length was 22 inches.  Management goals aim for at least 30% of ice-out pike to exceed 24 inches and 15% of female pike to exceed 30 inches.  Only 7.2% of female pike were longer than 30 inches in 2022 ice-out nets.  The 2022 data provides further evidence that little change in pike size structure has occurred since 2007.  In the 7 ice-out assessments since 2007 the percentage of pike over 24 inches has ranged from 16-28% with a mean of 23.6%.  In the same time period the proportion of fish over 30 inches has ranged from 2.5-7% with a mean of 4.5%.  While the percentage of fish greater than 24 inches has been generally higher since enactment of the regulation, the prevalence of fish over 30 inches has not shown sustained improvement.  The largest pike sampled in 2022 was 35.8 inches and fish 34 inches or larger had been netted in all assessments since 2001. No pike larger than 34 inches were observed prior to 2001 in ice-out efforts.  <br> \n   <br> \nA gill net survey completed in 2020 showed a similar percentage (4%) of pike over 30 inches and 19% longer than 24 inches.  Assuming gill net catch rates represent pike densities, pike numbers in Big Swan Lake continue to show high variation but almost always remaining above what is considered normal for similar lakes.  Lowered pike numbers have not been maintained and suggest limited long-term impacts of cannibalism of small pike by large pike.    <br> \n <br> \nWalleye were not the target species for this assessment, however 52 Walleye were observed in 2022.  Walleye ranged from 16.1 to 27.2 inches.  The 2015 and 2017 ice-out trap nets which also did not target Walleye, caught 4 and 13 fish, respectively.   Past ice-out catches have ranged from 4 to 107 fish (mean=38). <br> \nThe lake sets in 2022 collected 81 Bluegills ranging from 3.3 to 9.1 inches in length with 20% exceeding 7 inches.  A large number (1,010) of Bluegills was sampled in the 2015 ice-out and the catch was dominated by small fish.  Less than 3% exceeded 7 inches and no 8 inch fish were captured.   <br> \n <br> \nIce-out trap net catches of Black Crappie are often highly variable due to abiotic factors and do not usually reflect changes in abundance.  Catches have ranged from 18-699 fish since 1993 with a mean of 150 crappies.  Trap nets provided the largest sample ever of Black Crappie (699 fish) in 2022.  Ice-out data is most useful in assessing crappie size structure.  In 2022 crappie ranged from 4.7 to 12.8 inches long with 10.4% greater than 10 inches.  Mean size was 8.3 inches. Management goals call for at least 30% of the ice-out sample to be over 10 inches and 13 inch fish to be present.  A total of 208 crappies were collected in 2015 trap nets ranging in length from 4.1 to 13.2 inches.  Only 2% exceeded 10 inches and mean size was 8.3 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nThirteen (13) Largemouth Bass ranging from 14.1 to 19.3 inches were measured during the 2022 ice-out assessment.  Mean length was 17.3 inches.   Bowfin were relatively common with the trap nets producing 70 fish.  Smaller numbers of Pumpkinseed, Rock Bass, Hybrid Sunfish, White Sucker and bullheads were noted.  Only 1 Yellow Perch was observed. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>     The first spring panfish assessment was conducted on Big Swan Lake in late May to evaluate the bluegill and black crappie populations which are frequently main target species for anglers.  The spring trap nets replaced the summer trap nets in the population assessment and along with the summer survey results were used to determine an IBI (Index of Biotic Integrity) score for Big Swan Lake.   A scheduled population assessment with gill nets was conducted in late July of 2012 to evaluate the game fish populations.  Eight standard lake survey trap nets were set and lifted twice in the 2012 panfish assessment.  One net was moved after the first lift to another location in an attempt to improve the panfish catch.  All fish species were identified and measured with scales taken from bluegill and crappie for age and growth data. <br> \n     The 2012 panfish assessment netted 321 bluegill (20.1/TN) which ranged from 2.4 to 9.3 inches in length.   Mean length for the catch was 6.6 inches with 52% (n=167) exceeding seven inches, 8% (n=25) more than eight inches, and 0.3% (n=1) over nine inches in length.    Summer gill nets can sometimes provide a significant sample of bluegill.   The 2012 summer gill nets caught 135 bluegill between 2.7 and 8.6 inches in length with a mean length of 4.9 inches.  Ten percent (n=13) exceeded seven inches with 5% (n= 6) more than eight inches in length.    The 2012 panfish catch met both lake management goals of having at least 20% of the spring sample exceed seven inches and the presence of nine-inch bluegill in the catch.  <br> \n      Ages 2 through 9 were represented in the 2012 panfish assessment with all of the age groups exhibiting fast growth when compared to an Area Mean Back-calculated Length table.  The dominant year class was from 2007 (Age 5) which accounted for 39% of the sample.  Spring panfish trap netting has shown to be useful in assessing bluegill abundance and quality. <br> \n      Spring ice-out assessments for northern pike have also provided some good catches of bluegill.  The highest was 702 bluegill in 2007 and the lowest, eleven in 2005 with an average of 286 bluegill in the 9 assessments from 1997 to 2012.  Only one of the assessments sampled fish over nine inches, 1997, and two of the assessments had catches with more than 20% of the fish exceeding seven inches; 24% in 2007 and 48% in 1997, however, only 48% of the bluegill were measured in the 1997 assessment and the results could be biased toward larger fish.  None of the bluegill in the 2012 ice-out assessment were measured. <br> \n      While summer gill nets and trap nets can catch bluegill, the catches tend to be dominated by smaller fish.  Gill nets in Big Swan Lake have had a greater portion of their catches exceeding seven inches than the summer trap nets and all of the eight-inch plus bluegill have been in gill net catches.   Seven-inch plus bluegill comprised 10% of the gill net catch in 2012, 25% in 2008, 20% in 2004, and 5% in 2000.  The 2000 summer trap net sample also had a low percentage (0.7%) of the fish exceeding seven inches compared to 6% in 2008.  Only one nine-inch plus bluegill has been recorded in a summer survey, a single 9.9 inch bluegill in a 2000 gill net. <br> \n      A catch of 28 black crappie was recorded in the 2012 panfish assessment.   The fish measured from 3.4 to 12.6 inches in length with a mean length of 8.2 inches.  Fish exceeding nine inches accounted for 43% (n=12) of the sample with 32% (n=9) more than ten inches in length and 7% (n=2) exceeding twelve inches.   The 2012 panfish assessment met both lake management goals of maintaining a spring crappie catch where at least 30% of the fish exceed nine inches and the presence of twelve-inch fish.   Ages 1, 2, and 4 through 8 were represented in the 2012 panfish assessment.   All of the age groups displayed fast growth when compared to an Area Mean Back-calculated Length table.  The dominant year class was from 2010 (Age 2) which accounted for 50% of the sample. <br> \n      The 2012 summer gill nets sampled 87 (7.2/GN) crappie which was more than twice the 75% quartile level of 2.7/GN for lake class 27.  The catch was dominated by smaller fish as the largest crappie was 11.9 inches in length and only 14% (n=12) exceeded nine inches.   The highest gill net catch of crappie was 283 fish in 2000.  That catch also was dominated by smaller fish as only 6% (n=16) of the fish were more than nine inches in length.  There were two crappie caught in the 2000 sample that were over twelve inches in length.   Ages 1 through 6 were represented in the 2012 gill net catch.   <br> \n      Ages 1 through 4 showed normal growth and the older fish fast growth when compared to the Area Mean Back-calculated Length table.   While the 2011 was the strongest year class (Age 1) in the 2012 gill net catch at 45%, as with the 2012 panfish trap net assessment, the 2009 year class also made a significant contribution to the 2012 gill net sample accounting for 42% of the catch.   <br> \n      Some of the spring ice-out assessments have been effective at catching black crappie.  The highest catch was 560 fish in 1997 and the lowest 43 in 1994 with an average catch of 188 crappie in the twelve assessments between 1993 and 2012.  The percentage of nine-inch plus fish has varied from 6% (2012) to 93% (1994) in the ice-out assessments.  Crappie exceeding twelve inches have comprised from 0% to 18% of the measured catches.  The largest crappie caught measured 14.6 inches, with ten of the twelve assessments from 1993 to 2012 catching fish more than twelve inches in length.  \t <br> \n      The 2012 ice-out assessment sampled 79 black crappie that measured from 5.6 to 13 inches in length.  Not all of the crappie were measured, however, all the unmeasured fish (n=67) were less than seven inches in length.   There were no crappie between seven and eleven inches of length caught in the ice-out assessment.  Five (6%) of the fish were over eleven inches.   <br> \n      Spring daytime electrofishing for largemouth bass in 2012 also provided another opportunity to assess the black crappie population in Big Swan Lake.   A total of 43 black crappie were netted in 1.7 hours of on-time for a catch rate of 25.2/hour.  The fish measured from 3.5 to 13.2 inches in length with a mean length of 10.6 inches.  Crappie exceeding nine inches accounted for 95% of the catch, with 70% more than ten inches, and 23% exceeding twelve inches.  Ages 1, 2, and 4 through 6 were represented in the 2012 electrofishing catch.  The dominant year class was from 2007 (Age 5) which accounted for 44% of the catch.  <br> \n      Game fish species that were netted in the 2012 panfish assessment included thirteen northern pike, eight largemouth bass, and three walleye.  Other fish species sampled included bowfin, brown bullhead, hybrid sunfish, pumpkinseed sunfish, rock bass, yellow bullhead, and yellow perch.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>   Big Swan Lake is a popular fishing lake west of the Town of Burtrum in Todd County.   Big Swan Lake lies within an agricultural watershed, which results in reduced water clarity especially following snow melt and rain events.  The lake also has curly leaf pondweed, which adds to the mid-summer nutrient loading.  Algae blooms during the summer months are a common occurrence.  Fishing structure includes weedlines, sunken bars and islands, as well as extensive bulrush beds. <br> \n     The lake supports a diverse fish community that attracts anglers, including species such as walleye, northern pike, largemouth bass, bluegill, and black crappie.   There is a regulation on the lake prohibiting the possession of northern pike between 24 and 36 inches, with one over 36 inches allowed.  The regulation will change in spring of 2013 to a bag limit of six pike, but, the slot limit will be retained.  The goal of the regulation is to improve the size structure of the pike population while decreasing numbers of smaller pike.  Northern pike abundance, however, has shown increases the last two surveys and appears to be at a record high.  Most of the pike observed in the survey were between 17 and 22 inches in length, however, fish over 30 inches were caught.   <br> \n     Walleye stocking appears to sustain the fishery in Big Swan Lake and a wide range of sizes look to be available to anglers.  Average size in the survey was about 2 pounds but some trophy size fish have been observed.  Larger largemouth bass up to 19 inches in length were observed in the spring electrofishing  assessment which is the method used to evaluate bass populations.  There also appears to be good numbers of bass between 15 and 17 inches.  Yellow perch abundance showed a decline again since the last survey and although some anglers consider them to be pests, they can be an important food species for both northern pike and walleye.  Perch can also be instrumental in helping maintain a well-balanced bluegill population with fast growing, quality size individuals.   <br> \n      Bluegill provide a popular summer fishery in the area at times.  Anglers report having good luck catching 6 to 7-inch bluegill and fish up to 9 inches have been found.  Winter seems to be the best time to find black crappies in Big Swan Lake.  Recent ice fishing reports indicate the presence of a strong year class providing 8 to 10-inch crappie during the day. Spring assessments, spring electrofishing, and summer surveys have documented larger crappie over 12 inches.  Other panfish species in Big Swan Lake include pumpkinseed sunfish, rock bass, and hybrid sunfish. <br> \n     Big Swan Lake would also be an excellent choice for any angler seeking quality size bullhead.  Two species of bullhead are present in the lake and both the brown and yellow bullhead catches had individuals over 13 inches in length.  Other fish species found in Big Swan Lake include white sucker, bowfin or dogfish, and common carp.  Suckers were caught during the summer survey while bowfin were observed in both the spring panfish and spring electrofishing assessment.  Carp were observed in the spring electrofishing assessment. <br> \n     Along with the release of the larger northern pike, anglers are encouraged to practice catch and release with the larger individuals of other species to achieve a balanced fish community and provide opportunity for quality size fish.  Improving the water quality in Big Swan Lake should be a high priority of the lake association and landowners around the lake.  Preservation of the emergent vegetation beds can help to improve water quality and protect shorelines as well as valuable fish habitat.  Buffer strips along inlets and lakeshore property would also help to reduce nutrients entering the lake.  Maintaining adequate septic systems, keeping grass clippings and raked leaves out of the lake, and the use of zero phosphorus lawn fertilizer are all ways for homeowners to help reduce added nutrients from entering the lake and contributing to excess algae and weed growth.    <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>     An ice-out assessment was conducted on Big Swan Lake to evaluate changes in the northern pike population due to a protective regulation.  A 24-inch maximum regulation was implemented in 1997 and later modified in 2008 to a 24 - 36 inch protected slot with one over 36 inches allowed.  The modified regulation is up for review in 2013.  Northern pike data from ice-out assessments had been collected annually on Big Swan Lake three years prior to the regulation and in odd numbered years after the regulation went into effect.  Methods have included a combination of lake survey trap nets, a modified lake survey trap net with two leads, standard 3' x 5' muskellunge trap nets, and large-frame trap nets.   This assessment included two standard 3' x 5' muskellunge trap nets set at the mouth of the inlet from Long Lake before ice-out on the lake and ten standard lake survey trap nets in the lake after ice-out.  Gamefish, along with black crappie and bluegill, were all measured.  Scales and fin rays were collected from northern pike for age determination as well as identification.  Scales were also collected from walleye in the lake trap nets for age and growth data.  Recaptured northern pike were not re-measured or re-counted.  All other fish species captured were identified and counted.   <br> \n      The two stream trap nets were set  in early April, pulled out for the weekend after two lifts and reset the following Monday.  The nets were then lifted twice more for a total of eight lifts.  The stream nets captured a total of 183 northern pike between 8.2 and 34.8 inches in length with a mean length of 22.2 inches and average weight of 2.6 pounds.  Pike exceeding 24 inches in length comprised 32% (n=58) of the catch.   Fifty-five percent of the female pike (n=55) were over 24 inches compared to 4% (n=3) of the males.  Nine of the females (9%) exceeded 30 inches in length.  The sex ratio of the stream catch was 0.8 males (n= 81) to one female (n=100).    <br> \n     The lake trap nets used during the 2011 spring assessment were lifted three times for a total of 29 sets.  One hundred forty (140) northern pike measuring from 7.8 to 35.1 inches in length were netted.  While the largest pike of the assessment was caught in the lake nets, on average, smaller fish comprised the majority of the catch.  Mean length of the catch was 21.6 inches with a mean weight of 2.3 pounds.  Pike exceeding 24 inches accounted for 21% (n=29) of the sample.  Forty-two percent of the females (n=27) were more than 24 inches compared to 3% (n=2) of the males.  Four of the females (n=6%) were more than 30 inches in length.  Sex ratio of the lake catch was 1.1 males (n=74) to one female (n=65).   <br> \n       By the end of the evaluation period on March 1, 2013, the goal was to have a catch were 20% of the females exceeded 30 inches in length.  The long range lake management goal for Big Swan Lake is to have a spring trap net catch with 40% or more of the fish exceeding 24 inches in length and at least 5% more than 36 inches.   When combining the two gear type catches, only 8% (n=13) of the female pike (n=165) were more than 30 inches in length.  When looking at the long range goal, fish exceeding 24 inches in the assessment comprised 27% of the catch with none of the fish exceeding 36 inches.   <br> \n       Of the assessments since implementation of the regulation, the 2005 netting produced the most desirable results.  A total of 353 northern pike measuring from 9 to 37.2 inches in length were captured using two gear types.   Fifty percent of the pike (n=179) were more than 24 inches in length, 41% (n=77) of the females exceeded 30 inches, and 0.8% (n=3) from the total catch were more than 36 inches in length.  The 2005 assessment was also the first spring assessment to sample a northern pike over 36 inches in length.  Before 1997, the longest pike caught in the spring assessments was 33.1 inches in length.   In the 1995 assessment, where 62 northern pike were caught, 22% (n=14) of the fish were more than 24 inches in length with 5% (n=3) exceeding 30 inches.  Also before the regulation, it was rare to catch pike that were older than 6 years of old.  By 2003, fish up to 9 years of age were caught with 12% of the pike in the assessment more than 7 years of age.   <br> \n      Ages 1 through 10 were represented in subsample of the 2011 pike catch which were aged.  The male pike were from Age 1 to 10 and the females Age 2 to 9.  Mean age of the males was 3.7 years and the females 4.8 years.  Age 6 males displayed slow growth while the other age groups exhibited normal growth rates.   Age 2 females showed fast growth while the other age groups showed normal growth.  The females average from 1.4 inches to 5.7 inches longer than the males of the same age.  Pike more than 7 years of age comprised 12% (n=24 of 201) of the aged subsample.  Year class strengths suggest consistent annual recruitment. <br> \n      The stream nets in the 2011 spring assessment caught seven walleye between 18 and 25 inches in length while the lake nets caught thirteen walleye between 6 and 26 inches in length.  Walleye exceeding 20 inches accounted for 75% (n=15) of the combined catch.  Previous walleye catches have varied from six (2003) to 107 (2007) in the spring assessments.  The 2007 spring assessment included extra effort targeting walleye to evaluate their population size structure and gather data for the public input meeting on the northern pike regulation.  Larger adult fish have been prevalent in all of the assessments which would be expected for the time of year.   <br> \n      Ages 5, 6, 8, 10, and 11 were represented in the 2011 lake walleye catch.  Four of the five males were Age 5 and the other Age 8.  The females were Ages 6, 8, 10, and 11.  The Age 5 males displayed fast growth and the Age 8 normal growth.  The Age 6 female (n=1) showed fast growth and the older age groups normal growth.  <br> \n      The 2011 lake trap nets sampled 22 largemouth bass.  The highest bass catch was 210 fish in 2007 and the lowest, six bass in 1997.  In 2009, 79 largemouth bass were sampled which was the second highest catch in the spring assessments.   Other catches have averaged about 25 bass.  The 2011 bass ranged from 10 to 19 inches with a mean length of 16.2 inches and modal length of 17 - 18 inches. <br> \n     Spring assessments on Big Swan Lake can also produce good numbers of black crappie and bluegill.   One hundred sixty-two (162) black crappie were netted in the 2011 assessment.  Assessments in 2007 and 1997 had crappie catches of 511 and 560, respectively, but catches in the other assessments averaged about 124 crappie.   Crappie in 2011 measured from 2.7 inches to 14.6 inches in length with an average length of 7.7 inches.   Modal length for the sample was 7.5 to 8 inches.  The 2011 bluegill catch of 268 fish was above the long term average of 185 bluegill but well below the high of 702 bluegill in 2007 and 487 bluegill in 2001.  The bluegill ranged from 3 to 8.7 inches in the 2011 assessment with an average length of 6 inches.  Modal length for the sample was 6 - 6.5 inches with 19% exceeding seven inches in length. <br> \n      Other fish species caught in the 2011 spring assessment included black bullhead, bowfin, brown bullhead, golden shiner, hybrid sunfish, pumpkinseed, rock bass, tadpole madtom, white sucker, yellow bullhead, and yellow perch.  Bowfin were quite common in the 2011 assessment (n=94) as they have been in most of the previous assessments.  Over one hundred bowfin were recorded in the seven assessments where they were counted, with 402 caught in the 2007 assessment.  <br> \n      An area mean back-calculated length table was used to compare growth rates for the northern pike and walleye.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Big Swan Lake supports a diverse fish community that attracts anglers seeking manyspecies including walleye, northern pike, largemouth bass, bluegill, and blackcrappies.  The lake also has a variety of fish habitats, from sunken islands toextensive vegetation beds.  Walleye numbers appear normal for the lake type.  Themost abundant walleye size group sampled was 14 - 15 inches in length, however,fish up to 28 inches were caught.  The lake does have a long history of walleyestocking, however, the practice will be re-evaluated as the strongest year classin the survey appears to be from natural reproduction.  Big Swan Lake historicallyhas had an abundant northern pike population and the current net catches indicatethe trend continues.  Anglers report catching many small northern pike.  Averagelength from the survey was 20 inches, however, one pike over 35 inches was caught,indicating the lake can produce larger fish.  An experimental northern pikeregulation (24\" maximum) is scheduled to begin May 10, 1997.  The northern pikepopulation exhibits good reproduction and fast growth and by limiting harvest tosmaller fish, competition will be reduced. Release of large fish will allow morepike to reach trophy size.  Big Swan Lake appears to have a quality largemouth bassfishery.  Assessments have sampled a fair number of bass over 16 inches.  An anglerreported catching a 5.25 pound - 20 inch bass in 1996, however the average basscaught by fishermen has been about two pounds.  Bluegills attract anglers duringall seasons of the year.  Bluegill numbers declined from the previous survey in1991, but appear normal for the lake type.  Fish up to ten inches have beenobserved and it was not uncommon for anglers to  catch good numbers of 6 to 8 inchbluegills.  Black crappies over 13 inches have been documented, although fish inthe 9 -10 inch range are more common.  Yellow perch numbers appear normal, howeverthey have declined since the last survey.  Perch are an important food fish for thewalleye and northern pike.  The tullibee present in Big Swan provide a food sourceattractive to larger northern pike and walleye.  Tullibees ranging from 8 to 18inches were sampled in the summer survey.  Big Swan Lake supports a diverse non-game fish community including black bullheads, bowfin, brown bullhead, carp,pumpkinseed sunfish, rock bass, white sucker, and yellow bullheads.  White suckernumbers have shown an increase and can provide an additional prey base for thenorthern pike and walleye.  Bowfin, pumpkinseed sunfish, and rock bass abundanceswere all normal for the lake type.  Yellow bullheads were the most abundant speciesof bullheads sampled, however, their numbers have declined since the 1991 survey. Most of the bullheads averaged from 11 to 13 inches in length.  Carp abundance isdifficult to assess with lake survey gear.Big Swan Lake has a predominantly agricultural watershed and a moderate amount ofdevelopment around the lake.  Best farming practices and responsible lakeshoremanagement, such as preservation of emergent vegetation beds, can improve waterquality and protect valuable fish habitat.   Compliance with the northern pikeregulation is necessary for a quality and more balanced fish community.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Big Swan Lake (DOW# 77-0023-00; Lake Class 27) is an 887 acre lake located near Burtrum, Minnesota. A Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MNDNR) owned concrete boat ramp is located on the southeast Shore. Big Swan Lake has 8.11 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 45 feet. DNR has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different classes based on physical, chemical and other characteristics. Big Swan Lake is in Lake Class 27; lakes in this class are generally very large, deep, have very hard water, and are regular shaped. <br> \n <br> \nBig Swan Lake is one of the better multi-species lakes in the Little Falls area. While numbers of Northern Pike, Walleye, and Largemouth aren't exceptionally high, the size structure for these species is very good. Northern Pike up to 37 inches, Largemouth Bass up to 19 inches, and Walleye up to 29 inches were sampled. Anglers may get both a quality and at times quantity aspect to their fishing trip. In addition a large year class of Black Crappie was present that averaged around 10 inches. This should provide a good harvest opportunity for anglers.  <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species that anglers can expect to encounter include Bluegill, Bowfin (Dogfish), Brown Bullhead, Common Carp, Green Sunfish, Hybrid Sunfish, Pumpkinseed Sunfish, Rock Bass, White Sucker, Yellow Bullhead, and Yellow Perch. <br> \n <br> \nPeople can have significant impacts on lakes and the fish populations they support. Harvest, lakeshore development, removal of shoreline vegetation, and introductions of invasive species can all adversely affect fish populations. Curly Leaf Pondweed has been identified in Big Swan Lake. AIS can be moved from infested to non-infested waters by anglers, boaters, and lake shore owners and can adversely impact lakes and fish populations. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access. If you suspect an infestation of an invasive species in this lake, save a specimen and report it to a local natural resource office. Additional information on all of these topics can be found on the DNR website (www.dnr.state.mn.us) or by contacting the Little Falls Area Fisheries office. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A survey using 12 gill nets was completed on Big Swan Lake from July 20-24, 2020. Fish species targeted in the survey were Walleye, Northern Pike and Yellow Perch.  <br> \n <br> \nBig Swan Lake is primarily managed for Walleye and Northern Pike. Walleye abundance has remained stable for the past 20 years. Each survey, conducted every four years, we find similar numbers of Walleyes in the gill nets, about 5 fish per gill net on average which is what we'd expect to see in lakes similar to Big Swan. The 2020 catch of 6.3/lift was the highest recorded since 1996. It appears that Walleyes were a bit larger back in the early 2000s compared to now but not by a large margin. The survey in 2016 saw a \"bump\" in large Walleyes for that year. The highest numbers of Walleye captured in this most recent survey measured 11-15 inches. These fish should recruit well to larger size classes and fishing should be good in 2021-2022. While not as abundant as 11-15 inch fish, Walleyes 16-22 inches were found in good numbers as well. These fish likely range in age from 4-8 years old. There is a long history of Walleye fry and fingerling stocking, dating back to 1946. Currently, Walleye fry are stocked in odd numbered years and fingerlings on even. Gill netting surveys indicate that fingerlings have provided a better return to the fishery than fry, but at a higher price tag. Due to mild winters, fingerling production in area ponds has become more difficult, therefore, while fingerling stocking will become the focus for Big Swan, fry will continue to be stocked as well to see if quality fishing opportunities can be maintained for a cost that's much less expensive.   <br> \n <br> \nA special Northern Pike harvest regulation was launched in 1997 to improve the average size of pike. The current regulation consists of a 24-36 inch protected slot limit and a 6 fish bag limit, only one pike may exceed 36 inches. Today, the results appear to be mixed. Comparative spring ice-out trap netting before the regulation and after the regulation show that the average sample percentages of pike larger than 24, 30 and 36 inches improved greatly by the mid-2000s. Pike size structure has declined since that peak but remains better than pre-regulation conditions.  Continued monitoring is warranted in order to ascertain the long-term effectiveness of this regulation.  At this time the overall abundance of pike is less than it was ten years ago, but still higher than we'd like to see. Research has shown that low-density pike populations comprised of larger-sized individual fish can be more desirable from an angling perspective and be beneficial to the entire fish community. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch, a preferred prey fish for pike and Walleye, have declined in abundance over the years. At this time, average size is less than six inches. It will be important going forward that Yellow Perch are able to sustain adequate abundance and size structure as they are directly connected to the overall health of the Walleye population and to a lesser extent, Northern Pike. No Cisco (Tullibee) were caught in the 2020 nets and they have not been observed since 2000. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>      An ice-out assessment was conducted on Big Swan Lake to evaluate changes in the northern pike population due to a protective regulation which was up for review in 2012.  A 24-inch maximum regulation was implemented in 1997 and later modified in 2008 to a 24 - 36 inch protected slot with one over 36 inches allowed.  Northern pike data from ice-out assessments had been collected annually on Big Swan Lake three years prior to the regulation and in odd numbered years after the regulation went into effect.  Methods have included a combination of lake survey trap nets, a modified lake survey trap net with two leads, standard 3' x 5' muskellunge trap nets, and large-frame trap nets.    <br> \n     This assessment included ten lake survey trap nets set in the lake and two nets set at the mouth of the inlet from Long Lake.  Nets at mouth of the inlet were set on Monday, March 19 and lifted seven times with one removed on the second to last day of the assessment for a total of 13 lifts.  The lake nets were set in the lake on Friday, March 23 and lifted three times with two of the nets removed on the second to last day for a total of 28 lifts.  Scales and fin rays were taken from northern pike for age and growth data with a collection target of 100 males and 100 females.  Recaptured marked fish were not re-measured or counted.  Fish which were not used for aging were also marked.  Only scales were taken from the fish that had been previously fin ray clipped in 2011. <br> \n     The stream nets caught a total of 175 northern pike that ranged from 10.3 to 36.2 inches in length with a mean length of 20.6 inches and mean weight of two pounds.  Sixty-one of the fish were females and 113 were males for a sex ratio of 1.8 M to 1 female.   Forty-one percent (n=25) of the females exceeded 24 inches compared to 0.9% (n=1) of the males.   Eight percent (n=5) of the female pike in the stream catch were more than 30 inches in length with 1.6% (n=1) exceeding 36 inches.   Ages 2 through 8 were represented in the stream sample.    <br> \n    The lake trap nets caught 338 northern pike of which 135 were females, 168 were males, and 35 were juveniles.  Sex ratio was 1.2 males to one female.   The fish measured from 7.6 to 33.2 inches in length with a mean length of 20 inches and mean weight of two pounds.    Fish exceeding 24 inches comprised 48% (n=65) of the female sample and 4% (n=7) of the male sample.  Six percent (n=8) of the female pike in the lake catch were more than 30 inches in length.  Ages 2 through 8 and 11 were represented in the lake sample with all age groups combined from the stream and lake catches displaying normal growth.     It was evident from the aging that two strong year classes were produced in 2009 and 2010 and accounted for significant portions of both the stream and lake catches.  The 2009 year class (Age 3) accounted for 40% of the combined catches and the 2010 year class (Age 2) 30%. <br> \n     The pike population in Big Swan Lake had shown an increasing improvement in size structure when looking at data from 2001 to 2005.  By 2001, the average length went from 18.7 inches (pre-regulation, 1997) to 21.6 inches and more 24-inch plus pike were showing up.  The most desirable sample size structure was exhibited in the 2005 ice-out assessment.  Up to 50% of the total northern pike catch exceeded 24 inches with 41% of the female pike more than 30 inches in length and 2% of the females exceeding 36 inches.  Ice-out assessments after 2005 began showing a decline in northern pike quality.  While some quality pike are still being sampled in recent ice-out assessments, they represent a decreasing portion of the catches. (see attached Table 1.) <br> \n      Northern pike gill net catches reflect some of the same results as ice-out assessments.  After the regulation was implemented in 1997, the pike gill net catch declined in both the 2000 and 2004 surveys.  The 2004 survey had the lowest northern pike catch (9.8/GN) for Big Swan Lake since 1958 and also displayed an improvement in the population size structure compared to earlier surveys.  The subsequent surveys in 2008 and 2012 showed an upward trend in pike abundance and a downward trend in pike quality.  (see attached Table 2.)  <br> \n      The 2012 northern pike gill net catch of 19.6/set (n=235) was both a significant increase from the 16.1/GN (n=193) catch of 2008 and a record high for Big Swan Lake.  The 2012 gill net catch was also more than twice the 75% quartile level of 9/GN for lake class 27.  Pike ranged from 13.7 to 34.8 inches in length with a mean length of 20.3 inches and mean weight of 2 pounds.  Fish exceeding 24 inches accounted for 15% (n=36) of the catch compared to 35% (n=67) in 2008 and 61% (n=71) in 2004.  Fewer female pike over 30 inches were caught in the 2012 survey, 3% (n=7), while in 2008, 6% (n=12) of the females exceeded 30 inches with 14% (n=17) in 2004.   <br> \n     Additional game fish species captured in the 2012 ice-out assessment included a total of 53 walleye and 88 largemouth bass.  The walleye ranged from 13.9 to 27.7 inches in length with 64% (n=34) of the combined net catches exceeding twenty inches in length.   The bass measured from 7.2 to 19 inches in length with 59% (n=52) exceeding sixteen inches.   <br> \nIce-out assessments sometimes can provide large catches of black crappie and bluegill.  The 2012 assessment sampled 79 black crappie and 227 bluegill.   All of the larger crappie were measured as well as eleven of the smaller ones.   While the crappie ranged from 5.6 to 13 inches in length, there were no crappie caught between seven and eleven inches.  All of the unmeasured crappie were less than seven inches in length.  None of the bluegill were measured since a panfish assessment was scheduled later in the spring. <br> \n      One of the more abundant roughfish species in the 2012 ice-out assessment was bowfin, although,  none were caught in the 2012 summer gill net survey.  Other fish species caught in the 2012 ice-out assessment included brown bullhead, burbot, common carp, common shiner, creek chub, golden shiner, hybrid sunfish, pumpkinseed sunfish, rock bass, white sucker, yellow bullhead, and yellow perch.   <br> \n      The 2012 summer gill net catch was not as diverse in terms of fish species caught, with eleven species represented compared to eighteen in the ice-out assessment.   Species not caught in the summer survey included bowfin, burbot, common carp, common shiner, creek chub, golden shiner, and hybrid sunfish. </p>",
