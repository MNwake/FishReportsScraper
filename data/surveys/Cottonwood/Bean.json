                "narrative": "<p>The Bean Lake northern pike population is just getting established.  It was first stocked with northern pikein March of 1992.  Based on the information collected during the summer of 1994, there were moderate numbers offish that were from 1 to 3years old.  These fish ranged in length from 15.9 to 27.9 inches. Only time will tell how successful northern pikewill be in Bean Lake.     The black crappie population is doing quite well.  Although the number of black crappies is low to moderate,there are some trophies.  Black crappie lengths ranged from 3.1 to 14.9 inches, with 78% of the fish 12 inchesor longer.  Give Bean Lake a try if you are interested in a wall-hanger black crappie.     The yellow perch population in Bean Lake is almost twice as high as other lakes similar to Bean Lake. Several year classes of yellow perch were collected and the fish ranged in length from 5.6 to 11.7 inches.  Theyellow perch have been doing well in Bean Lake and we hope that this trend continues in the future.     Don't overlook Bean Lake as a black bullhead fishery.  Those who enjoy fishing bullheads at times during theyear should find success on this lake.  Black bullhead lengths ranged from 5.3 to 13.1 inches but most of themwere just under 10 inches.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>INTRODUCTION <br> \n <br> \nBean Lake is located in Cottonwood County approximately 3 miles northwest of Storden.  The 141 acre lake has a maximum depth of 10 feet, a reduction of 2 feet since the 2008 population assessment.  Up until the fall of 2011 the water level in Bean Lake was rising until maximum depths approached more than 14 feet in June of 2011.  Local agricultural and highway drainage was significantly affected by the increased water level so a new water level was maintained with a new outlet established in the late fall of 2011.  Bean Lake has a watershed-to-lake ratio of 3-to-1 indicating a fairly small watershed.  The watershed of Bean Lake is characterized as highly agricultural with row crops and pattern tile drainage dominating the landscape.  As a result of the predominant agricultural landscape, inputs of excessive nutrients are common in Bean Lake.  One indicator of excessive nutrients and inputs is high alkalinity, usually greater than 200 ppm (280 ppm in 2014).  Additionally, high productivity leads to an increase in usage of oxygen in the lake (high Biological Oxygen Demand [BOD]).  High BOD, magnified by ice and snow cover in the winter eliminating or reducing the air water interface, led to aeration in 1991.  From 1991 to 2013 there were no reported or observed partial winterkills due to low dissolved oxygen; however, during the winter of 2013-2014 there was thick ice coupled with longer than usual periods of snow cover on the ice that caused low dissolved oxygen.  A fish kill was observed and documented in the late winter and early spring of 2014.  Due to severe winter conditions over an extended period during the winter of 2013-14, the aeration system on Bean Lake was unable to prevent a partial winterkill.  A winterkill assessment was conducted in the spring with trap netting and electrofishing which revealed only a partial winterkill as walleye, black crappie, black bullhead, and common carp were still present.  A population assessment with 2 gill nets and 9 trap nets was conducted in July of 2014 following restocking to gather further information on the recovery of the game fish populations and fish community as a whole.  <br> \n <br> \nWALLEYE <br> \n <br> \nWalleye were one of the species of fish that was impacted by the partial winterkill during the winter of 2013-2014.  However, 2 large fish over 20 inches were still present in the spring post winterkill sample which indicates some fish did survive.  To boost the recovery of the Walleye population 162,138 walleye fry were stocked in the spring.  During the population assessment in July, 15 Walleye were caught in 2 gill nets and 11 Walleye were caught in 9 trap nets.  The catch rate of 7.5 Walleye per gill net is a reduction from catch rates of 45.0 per gill net in 2002 and 25.3 per gill net in 2008.  However, the catch rate was still within the expected catch rate range of 2.3 to 18.1 fish per gill net.  The Walleye in the gill nets had an average length of 17.1 inches with an average weight of 2.1 pounds and the Walleye in trap nets had an average length of 22.7 inches with an average weight of 4.3 pounds.  In addition, there was a higher than average proportion of Walleye larger than 15 inches in the population compared to other lakes.  Six age groups of walleye were also observed indicating successful survival of past stocked walleye.  The Walleye in the gill net and trap net sample were also in excellent condition indicating adequate food is still available in the lake.  We observed more than 130 juvenile walleye in July shoreline seining indicating good survival of stocked walleye fry in the spring.  To further boost the number of walleye in Bean Lake the DNR stocked an additional 3,979 walleye fingerling (6-10 inches) in the fall.  Good survival of Walleye fry and stocking of additional walleye fingerling into Bean Lake coupled with a healthy remaining adult population of Walleye should create a fishable population of Walleye relatively soon.  Recovery of the population from the winterkill in 2013-2014 appears to be on track.  <br> \n <br> \nNORTHERN PIKE <br> \n <br> \nNo northern pike were sampled in the population assessment.  Additionally, no northern pike were sampled in the spring winterkill assessment.  The last time northern pike were sampled by the DNR was in 2002 when 6.5 northern pike were caught per gill net.  In the spring of 2014, 1,491 northern pike fingerlings were stocked into Bean Lake.  In near shore seining in July, six northern pike juveniles were caught indicating some survival of the stocked fingerlings occurred. It will be important to stock additional northern pike fingerlings in Bean Lake as they are available to the DNR to help the population fully recover.    <br> \n <br> \nYELLOW PERCH <br> \n <br> \nForty-two Yellow Perch were caught in gill nets and 26 Yellow Perch were caught in trap nets.  Yellow Perch caught in the gill nets and trap nets were most likely a result of a spring stocking of 4,124 Yellow Perch adults because no Yellow Perch were sampled during the post winterkill assessment.  Even so, catch rates of Yellow Perch were within expected ranges for both gill nets and trap nets.  The average length of Yellow Perch in the gill nets was 6.4 inches and the average length of Yellow Perch in the trap nets was 6.8 inches.  Additionally, the body condition of all the Yellow Perch caught was exceptional.  Also encouraging, the spring stocked Yellow Perch were also able to successfully reproduce; juvenile Yellow Perch were caught in July near shore seine sampling.  Historical catch rates of Yellow Perch from 1989 to 2002 ranged from 47 to 91 fish per gill net indicating high abundances of Yellow Perch in the past.  In 2008, the catch rate dropped dramatically to under 1 fish per gill net with only 1 per trap net which was linked to very high abundances of Walleye feeding heavily on the Yellow Perch population.  Due to the restocking effort following the winterkill and a lower density of Walleye in 2014, it appears the Yellow Perch population is staged to make a return to high abundances because high stocking success, good catch rates, successful reproduction, and exceptional health were all observed in 2014.  <br> \n <br> \nBLACK BULLHEAD <br> \n <br> \nBlack Bullhead did not appear to be affected greatly by the winterkill and were found to be abundant during winterkill netting in the spring of 2014.  Additionally, the gill net catch rate in 2014 was the second highest observed since 1989 at 309.5 fish per gill net.  The 2014 gill net catch rate is 2 times the upper normal value of 150.6 fish per gill net.  Black Bullhead in the gill nets and trap nets ranged in length from 5.8 to 7.4 inches indicating at least 1 highly successful age group.  The overall condition of Black Bullhead in the sample was lower than expected and may indicate poor health due to overpopulation.  No juvenile Black Bullhead were captured in near shore seining which may indicate that the currently overabundant population did not have successful reproduction or juveniles were quickly eaten by other species.   <br> \n <br> \nBLACK CRAPPIE <br> \n <br> \nOnly 1 10-inch Black Crappie was caught in the spring post winterkill sampling.  In July, 18 Black Crappie were caught in the population assessment trap nets. The catch rate of 2.0 fish per trap net was within the expected range of 1.2 to 20.5 fish per trap net, but was less than the 2008 catch rate of 4.3 fish per trap net and long term average catch rate of 3.9 fish per trap net. While the catch rate was down in 2014, the size structure was good with an average size of 11.0 inches (9.8 to 12.1 inches).  Additionally, the overall body condition of the Black Crappie population was excellent.  It appears that good adult stock available in the lake and should have a successful spawn in 2015 especially given the mild winter in 2014-2015.  <br> \n <br> \nCOMMON CARP <br> \n <br> \nCommon Carp were first observed in Bean Lake in 2008.  There is no known natural pathway for Common Carp to easily enter Bean Lake, so it is suspected that they made their way into Bean Lake through a bait bucket or by way of an illegal stocking.  In 2014, 3 common carp were captured; 2 in the gill nets (1.0 per net) and 1 in the trap nets (0.1 per net).  The catch rates in 2014 are down from initial catch rates in 2008, but the species appears to be firmly established in the lake.  There are no known eradication methods for Common Carp without killing the entire fish community in the lake.  Even when the fish poison rotenone is used to poison a lake and kill the fish community or when there is a winterkill, there is still a chance that the rotenone or winterkill will not kill 100% of the fish in the lake.  Therefore, it is highly likely that Common Carp will remain present in the lake.  Therefore, the DNR will be monitoring Walleye and Northern Pike populations and stocking them to keep them at abundances where adults of those species will prey upon juvenile Common Carp and keep them in check.  Future monitoring of the fish population with gill netting and trap netting in 2018 will help to monitor the Common Carp population.  <br> \n <br> \nOTHER SPECIES <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled in Bean Lake were Orangespotted Sunfish and Yellow Bullhead.  These species are common in southwestern Minnesota Lakes and usually are found in low abundances.  Occasionally, Orangespotted Sunfish can become a nuisance as they easily stunt when overpopulated and compete with managed species for food.  However, it appears that Orangespotted Sunfish and Yellow Bullhead are merely low density residents in Bean Lake that may actually add to the forage base for Walleye and Northern Pike.      <br> \n <br> \nSUMMARY <br> \n <br> \nBean Lake appears to be recovering quickly from a partial winterkill during the winter of 2013-2014.  Walleye stocking in the spring and fall of 2014 has helped to boost the existing adult population.  Additionally, Yellow Perch were reintroduced in the spring of 2014 and survival looks very good.  Continued monitoring of Bean Lake will be done in 2018 and supplemental stocking in 2015 and 2016 may be done to continue the recovery of the lake.  Walleye anglers may find good opportunities for fishing in 2015 and beyond due to good numbers and sizes of Walleye currently in Bean Lake.   <br> \n <br> \nPrepared by Nate Hodgins <br> \n</p>",

The 141 acre lake has a maximum depth of 10 feet and is situated in a highly agricultural watershed, resulting in nutrient rich, turbid water.  Bean Lake is managed primarily for Northern Pike and secondarily for Yellow Perch and Walleye.  Bean Lake was stocked with Lower Mississippi Strain Walleye fry in the spring of 2017, due to surplus production of this strain.  The Lower Mississippi strain was last stocked decades ago, but has persisted in several area lakes despite extensive stocking of Mississippi strain Walleye.  A daytime electrofishing survey was conducted on September 11, 2017 to determine if the fry stocking was successful.   <br> \n <br> \nYoung-of-the year Walleye were captured at a rate of 8.0 per hour electrofishing, which indicates that the fry stocking was unsuccessful.  In stocked years, the goal is to attain 30.0 per hour electrofishing.  <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>INTRODUCTION <br> \n <br> \nBean Lake is a typical shallow southern Minnesota Lake near the town of Storden in Cottonwood County, Minnesota.  The 141-acre lake has a maximum depth of 10 feet.  Bean Lake has a watershed acreage-to-lake acreage ratio of 3-to-1 indicating a fairly small watershed.  The watershed acres of Bean Lake are agricultural with row crops and pattern tile drainage dominating the landscape.  This altered hydrology leads to increased drainage which results in artificially increased water levels in lakes and streams following precipitation events.  As a result, highly erodible soils within and along the watercourses and farm fields can lead to inputs of excessive nutrients.  One indicator of excessive nutrients and inputs is high alkalinity, usually greater than 200 ppm (280 ppm in 2014 and unchanged at 280 ppm in 2020).  Additionally, high productivity leads to high biological oxygen demand (BOD, accumulation of bacteria and living organisms in the lake that use oxygen separate from fish).  Complications from a high BOD is magnified by ice and snow cover in the winter, eliminating or reducing the dissolved oxygen during winter.  To combat this, aeration was started in 1991 by a local sportsman's club.  From 1991 to 2013 there were no reported or observed winterkills due to low dissolved oxygen. However, during the winter of 2013-2014 there was thick ice (greater than 19 inches) coupled with longer than usual periods of snow cover on the ice that caused low dissolved oxygen.  A partial fish kill was observed and documented in the late winter and early spring of 2014, with some fish surviving.  Restocking of gamefish was coordinated by the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources and private stocking provided by Redrock Sportsman's Club.  The restocking effort was successful as determined by a 2014 survey.  A standard gill net and trap net survey with 2 gill nets and 8 trap nets was conducted in July of 2020 to monitor the fish community and continue to track the recovery of the fish population.  <br> \n <br> \nWALLEYE <br> \n <br> \nThirty-five Walleye between 16.9 and 20.9 inches (average = 18.6 inches) were caught in gillnets and 10 Walleye between 18.6 and 25.6 inches (average = 21.5 inches) were caught in trap nets.  The gillnet catch rate of 17.5 per gillnet was just below the upper normal range for similar lakes (18.06/gillnet).  The sizes of Walleye in the sample favored fish between 17 and 20 inches.  Thirty-five Walleye were assigned an age by reading their ear bone (otolith) under a dissecting microscope.  Thirty-four were age-3 and 1 was age-6.  The 2017 stocking of Lower Mississippi Strain Walleye (Lake Sarah Strain) resulted in a very strong year class (97% of aged fish).  Additionally, the health of the Walleye in the sample was good indicating they are finding adequate food.   Walleye angling should be good, if not excellent, on Bean Lake over the next several years. Most Walleye will be near the 20 inch statewide regulation so be cognizant to only harvest 1 fish over 20 inches as part of your daily bag.  Additionally, good numbers of Yellow Perch in the gill nets and trap nets should help feed larger Walleye which may create an opportunity to catch a Walleye over 25 inches over the next year or two.  Overall, the Walleye population has rebounded well from the partial winterkill in 2013-2014.   <br> \n <br> \nYELLOW PERCH <br> \n <br> \nFifty-one Yellow Perch were captured in 2 gill nets and 2 Yellow Perch were captured in 8 trap nets.  The gill net catch rate (25.5/gill net) was nearly identical to the upper normal range for similar lakes (25.0/gill net).  Yellow Perch in the gill net ranged in length from 6.5 inches to 12.7 inches with an average length of 8.7 inches.  The sizes of the Yellow Perch was well balanced with many fish 8 inches and bigger.  In addition, the health of the Yellow Perch in the gill nets and trap nets was excellent.  Angling for Yellow Perch in 2020 and 2021 could result in good numbers of fish larger than 9 inches. Particularly, ice angling could be good if the fish are actively feeding.   <br> \n <br> \nNORTHERN PIKE <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike are currently managed as the top predator for Bean Lake. Gill nets and trap nets in 2020 sampled 2 Northern Pike that were 29.3 inches and 35.4 inches.  While the numbers per net (0 per gill net and 0.25 per trap net) were low, the 2 Northern Pike that were sampled reflect a potential small population of large Northern Pike that should help to reduce numbers of small undesired species and keep Yellow Perch from becoming overabundant and stunted. Future stocking will occur to help boost numbers of Northern Pike. However, large Northern Pike could be caught on Bean Lake.  These large predators are beneficial to the Lake, so consider catch-and-release of Northern Pike if they are not foul hooked and they remain lively.  The Current regulation in Southern Minnesota is 2 Northern Pike over 24 inches for daily limit and possession limit.   <br> \n <br> \nOTHER SPECIES <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled on Bean Lake were Black Bullhead, Black Crappie, Common Carp, Green Sunfish, Orangespotted Sunfish, and Yellow Bullhead.  Black Bullhead were the most abundant of the species listed above, 51.5 were caught per gill net and 33.4 were caught per trap net.  Black Bullhead averaged 9.9 inches in the gill net sample and 11.9 inches in the trap net sample.  Black Crappie were caught at the highest abundance ever observed for Bean Lake with 12.5 per gill net and 0.4 per trap net.  The average length of Black Crappie in the gill net sample was 6.7 inches and 8.4 inches in the trap net sample.  While currently undersized for harvest, Black Crappie typically grow quickly and should be nearly 1 inch longer by summer 2021.  Common Carp, Green Sunfish, Orangespotted Sunfish, and Yellow Bullhead were all only caught in trap nets at rates less than 1 fish per trap net (Species = number/trap net; Common Carp = 0.5, Green Sunfish = 0.13, Orangespotted Sunfish = 0.25, and Yellow Bullhead = 0.25). <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Bean Lake is a shallow prairie lake located three miles northwest of Storden.  Fish can be difficult for anglers to catch in Bean Lake due to the abundant fathead minnow population.  The lake is managed for northern pike as the primary species with black crappie and yellow perch as secondary species.Yellow perch populations often fluctuate from year to year.  Spring weather conditions, water levels, and other species in the lake all effect the success of a given year class.  In contrast to many local lakes, Bean Lake generally has good yellow perch reproduction.  In 1998, yellow perch numbers were similar to four years ago and higher than 75% of the lakes similar to Bean Lake.  In addition to high numbers, the yellow perch were large, with 56% of the sample 10.0 inches or longer.  Yellow perch fishing should be good for the next few years. In 1998, black crappie continued to be low but there were some trophies.  Lengths ranged from 11.4 to 14.7 inches, with an average of 13.0 inches.  Nearly 86% of the black crappie sampled in 1998 were 12 inches or longer.  Black crappie in Bean Lake grow very fast, with fish exceeding 12 inches in just four years.  If you are looking for large crappie, Bean Lake is a good lake to try.Bean Lake generally supports a moderate to high population of black bullhead.  Black bullhead ranged from 5.0 to 9.8 inches, and averaged almost 7.0 inches.  If you enjoy bullhead fishing, you should have no problem finding them in Bean Lake.To promote and maintain healthy fish populations, pollution needs to be controlled.  Fish habitat is directly affected by water quality.  Nutrients, sediments and other waste can drastically alter the chemical and physical characteristics of a lake.  It is important to maintain, if not improve, the water quality of Bean Lake through watershed management.  Improved land use practices should insure that this fishery can be enjoyed by future generations.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Bean is a 141 acre lake located northwest of Storden in Cottonwood County.  The lake has 1.9 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 12.0 feet.  The lake is presently managed for northern pike as the primary species while yellow perch and black crappie are managed secondarily.Results from our netting in 2002 suggest that the northern pike population is in very good shape.  Lengths of northern pike sampled in trap nets ranged from 15.4 to 36.4 inches and averaged 20.3 inches.  Three different age groups were caught during the survey but the majority of fish were one and two years old.The yellow perch population is high when compared to other lakes like Bean Lake.  Lengths of perch ranged from 5.2 to 11.4 inches and averaged 7.9 inches.  Five consecutive age groups were caught during the survey which means the population is very good at taking care of itself.  Angling opportunities for yellow perch look good for the future.The black crappie population is down from previous years.  Only three crappie were sampled during the survey.  The three sampled were very large however, with the lengths ranging from 13.5 to 14.3 inches and averaging 13.9 inches.The surprise catch was the high number of walleyes sampled during the 2002 survey.  The reason for the surprise is because we do not have any documentation of walleye being stocked in Bean since 1983.  The fish were all one year old and ranged in length from 11.4 to 13.5 inches and averaged 12.5 inches.  The high number of walleyes should offer good angling opportunities in 2003 and 2004.The black bullhead population was high when compared to other lakes like Bean Lake.  Lengths of black bullhead sampled ranged from 4.2 to 9.5 inches and averaged 8.1 inches.To promote and maintain healthy fish populations, pollution and other inputs need to be controlled.  Fish habitats are directly affected by water quality.  Nutrient, sediment and other waste inputs can drastically alter the biological, chemical, and physical components of a lake.  It is important to maintain if not improve the current water quality of Bean Lake through watershed management to preserve this fishery for future generations to enjoy.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Bean Lake is a 141-acre lake with a maximum depth of 12 feet.  A helixor type aeration system was installed in 1991 and no known significant winterkill has occurred since then.  Bean has a watershed to lake ratio of nearly 60:1, which means significant agricultural drainage flows to the lake.  Because a vast majority of the watershed is dominated by row cropping, the productivity of the lake is quite high. Bean Lake is managed primarily for northern pike and secondarily for yellow perch and black crappie.  A population assessment was conducted during the week of August 18, 2008, which consisted of 3 gill net sets and 9 trap net nights. <br> \n <br> \nThe walleye population continues to dominate the fishery on Bean Lake.  It is possible that the high walleye population is limiting the yellow perch and northern pike abundance and positively impacting the black bullhead abundance.  The 2008 walleye catch rate in gill nets was 25.3 fish/gill net set, which was down from the 2002 survey of 45 fish/set.  The catch rate is still higher than the expected range for Windom Area lakes.  Total lengths of walleye sampled ranged from 13.5 to 23.8 inches and averaged 16.7 inches.  Although the DNR does not stock walleye in Bean Lake, the local sportsmen\u0019s club has purchased and been given permits to stock walleye fingerlings at least 2 times.  Given the lake\u0019s size and lack of defined in-lake structure, it may be possible to spend a few successful hours angling for walleyes.   <br> \n <br> \nBased on the survey numbers, it would appear the northern pike population is below expectations.  Only 4 northern pike were sampled in trap nets and 0 in gill nets during the 2008 survey.  Historically, catch rates in trap nets have ranged from 0.4 (2008 and1998) to 2.3 (1994).  Given the small sample size and the lengths of fish sampled, it is likely most of these fish are from the 2007 northern pike fingerling stocking.  Total lengths ranged from 22.1 to 26.4 inches with a mean of 23.4 inches.  Given the low yellow perch numbers, which is likely attributed to the high walleye abundance, it might be beneficial to cease northern pike fingerling stocking until the walleye abundance declines to a level where both species have adequate forage. <br> \n <br> \nThe yellow perch catch rate in gill nets was the lowest ever recorded during a survey on Bean Lake.  A total of 8 yellow perch were sampled and therefore not much information can be obtained from this limited sample.  The large walleye population may be limiting the yellow perch population and therefore stocking would not help their abundance.  There are adequate numbers of yellow perch in the lake to keep a presence of yellow perch. <br> \n <br> \nThe black crappie catch rate has rebounded since the 2002 survey (0.38 fish/set).  Total lengths ranged from 5.5 to 12.6 inches and averaged 8.4 inches.  It would seem that black crappie is the panfish of choice when angling on Bean Lake. <br> \n <br> \nThe black bullhead catch rate in gill nets has never been lower as 61.7 fish/gill net was sampled.  Historically the catch rates have ranged from 61.7 to 298.5 fish/set.  The catch rate in 2008 was within the expected range (30.3 to 150.6 fish/set).  The large walleye population abundance is likely keeping the bullhead abundance in check. <br> \n <br> \nCommon carp were first sampled in Bean Lake in 2008.  The 13 fish had total lengths that ranged from 14 to 17 inches.  It is unclear how these carp became established in the system as connections to other bodies of water are minimal.  It is possible they could have come into the lake via anglers bait buckets. <br> \n <br> \nOther species captured were pumpkinseed and yellow bullhead. <br> \n <br> \nEfforts to improve the health of the lake should focus on best management practices within the watershed.  Improvements and education in land stewardship will often have secondary benefits to the lake in the way of quality and quantity of habitat.  Generally, improvements in the quality and quantity of lake habitat will mean direct improvements of the fishery. <br> \n <br> \nReport by Ryan Doorenbos         <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

AT THE END OF THE FIRST YEAR AND 8.72 INCHES AT THE END OF THE SECOND YEAR WHICH ARE 2.3 AND 1.9 TIMES THE STATE MEDIANS RESPECTIVELY. SHORELINE SEINING DURING 1989 PRO- DUCED 69.1 YOY YELLOW PERCH PER ACRE SEINED. THE BLACK CRAPPIE TRAPNET CATCH INDEX WAS 5.8 FISH PER LIFT WHICH IS 2.2 TIMES THE STATE MEDIAN AND 3.2 TIMES THE LOCAL MEDIAN. THE LENGTH FRE- QUENCY DISTRIBUTION OF BLACK CRAPPIE SAMPLED HAD A RANGE OF 6.6 TO 13.8 INCHES INCHES WITH MOST FISH MEASURING BETWEEN 10.5 AND 13.9 INCHES WITH A MODE OF 12.0 INCHES. MEAN GROWTH INDICES FOR BLACK CRAPPIE WERE 1.3 TIMES THE STATE MEDIAN AT THE END OF THE FIRST YEAR, 1.8 AT THE END OF THE SECOND, 1.6 AT THE END OF THE THIRD AND 1.4 AT THE END OF THE FOURTH. AVERAGE WEIGHT OF THE BLACK CRAPPIE SAMPLED IN THE TRAPNETS WAS 1.1 LB PER FISH. SHORELINE SEINING DID NOT PRODUCE ANY YOY BLACK CRAPPIE. THE BLACK BULLHEAD TRAPNET CATCH INDEX WAS 265.2 FISH PER LIFT WHICH IS 1.2 TIMES THE STATE MEDIAN AND 3.4 TIMES THE LOCAL MEDIAN. THE LENGTH FRE- QUENCY DISTRIBUTION OF BLACK BULLHEAD SAMPLED HAS A RANGE OF 4.5 TO 11.0 INCHES WITH MODES AT 6.0 AND 9.0 INCHES. MOST OF THE BULLHEADS 8.5 INCHES AND LARGER WERE ATROPHIED AND NEAR DEATH. SHORE- LINE SEINING PRODUCED 36.8 YOY BLACK BULLHEAD PER ACRE SEINED. ONE BLUEGILL AND ONE LARGEMOUTH BASS WERE CAPTURED DURING THE SURVEY. BOTH FISH WERE FIVE YEARS OLD. SHORELINE SEINING DURING 1989 PRODUCED 25,735 FATHEAD MINNOW PER ACRE SEINED.</p>",
