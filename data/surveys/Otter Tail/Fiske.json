                "narrative": "<p>     Fiske Lake is a 250-acre eutrophic (fertile) lake located in south-central Otter Tail County approximately three miles southeast of Underwood, MN.  Fiske Lake is part of the Pomme de Terre River Watershed.  There is an intermittent, unnavigable inlet and outlet connected to Fiske Lake.  The immediate watershed is composed primarily of agricultural land interspersed with hardwood woodlots.  The maximum depth is 26 feet; however, 74% of the lake is less than 15 feet in depth.  The secchi disk reading during the survey was 7.6 feet.  Secchi disk readings during previous surveys ranged from 2.3 to 5.2 feet.  Periodic plankton and algae blooms throughout the summer months can influence secchi disk readings.     <br> \n     The majority of the shoreline of Fiske Lake remains undeveloped.  A DNR concrete public water access is located along the south shoreline of the lake.  Shoal water substrates consist primarily of sand and silt.  Stands of hardstem bulrush and common cattail are scattered along the entire lakeshore.  Emergent aquatic plants such as wild rice and bulrush provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat, and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms, and can actually absorb and break down polluting chemicals.  Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish such as northern pike, largemouth bass, and panfish.  They also serve as important nursery areas for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit.     <br> \n     Fiske Lake can be ecologically classified as a bass-panfish type of lake and this is reflected in the assemblage of the fish community.  Northern pike, largemouth bass, and bluegill are the dominant gamefish species in the fish community of Fiske Lake.  The prolificacy of these species can be attributed to the abundance of suitable spawning habitat that is available. <br> \n     A high-density northern pike population exists.  Age data indicate that pike reproduction is consistently good.  Pike ranged in length from 14.5 to 33.9 inches with an average length and weight of 22.3 inches and 2.7 pounds.  Pike attain an average length of 24.2 inches at five years of age. <br> \n     Data collected from a spring electrofishing assessment indicate that a balanced largemouth bass population exists.  Age data suggest that largemouth bass reproduction is consistently good.  Largemouth bass ranged in length from 6.3 to 20.3 inches with an average length and weight of 13.6 inches and 1.6 pounds.  Bass attain an average length of 14.0 inches at five years of age.  <br> \n     The bluegill population is moderately abundant.  Size structure is good with 56% of the bluegills in the trap net sample measuring 7.0 inches or greater in length.  Bluegills attain an average length of 7.4 inches at eight years of age.  <br> \n     Anglers can maintain the quality of fishing in Fiske Lake by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large-size fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future.       <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>     Fiske Lake is a 250-acre eutrophic (fertile) lake located in south-central Otter Tail County approximately three miles southeast of Underwood, MN.  Fiske Lake is part of the Pomme de Terre River Watershed.  The immediate watershed is composed primarily of agricultural land interspersed with hardwood woodlots.  The maximum depth is 26 feet; however, 74% of the lake is less than 15 feet in depth.  The secchi disk reading was 13.0 feet.  Secchi disk readings during previous surveys ranged from 2.3 to 7.6 feet.  Periodic plankton and algae blooms throughout the summer months can influence secchi disk readings.     <br> \n     The majority of the shoreline of Fiske Lake remains undeveloped.  A DNR concrete public water access is located along the south shoreline of the lake.  Shoal water substrates consist primarily of sand and silt.  Stands of hardstem bulrush and common cattail are scattered along the entire lakeshore.  Emergent aquatic plants such as bulrush and cattail provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat, and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms, and can actually absorb and break down polluting chemicals.  Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish such as Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, and panfish.  They also serve as important nursery areas for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit.     <br> \n     Fiske Lake can be ecologically classified as a bass-panfish type of lake and this is reflected in the assemblage of the fish community.  Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, Bluegill, and Black Crappie are the dominant gamefish species in the fish community of Fiske Lake.  The prolificacy of these species can be attributed to the abundance of suitable spawning habitat that is available. <br> \n     A high-density Northern Pike population exists.  Age data indicate that pike reproduction is consistently good.  Pike ranged in length from 16.3 to 29.0 inches with an average length and weight of 21.3 inches and 2.1 pounds.  Eleven percent of the Northern Pike sampled measured 24.0 inches or greater in length. Pike attain an average length of 24.6 inches at five years of age. <br> \n     Largemouth Bass are also very abundant.  Age data indicate that Largemouth Bass reproduction is consistently good.  Largemouth Bass ranged in length from 6.7 to 17.9 inches.  Fifteen percent of the bass were 15.0 inches or greater in length. Bass attain an average length of 14.5 inches at four years of age.  <br> \n     The Bluegill population is moderately abundant.  Thirty-one percent of the Bluegills were 7.0 inches or greater in length.  Bluegills attain an average length of 7.3 inches at six years of age.  <br> \n    Black Crappies ranged in length from 4.6 to 10.6 inches with an average length of 7.9 inches. Forty-four percent of crappies were 10.0 inches or greater in length. Black Crappies attain an average length of 10.3 inches at five years of age. <br> \n     Anglers can maintain the quality of fishing in Fiske Lake by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large-size fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future.      <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>     Fiske Lake is a 250-acre eutrophic (fertile) lake located in south-central Otter Tail County approximately three miles southeast of Underwood, MN.  Fiske Lake is part of the Pomme de Terre River Watershed.  The immediate watershed is composed primarily of agricultural land interspersed with hardwood woodlots.  The maximum depth is 26 feet; however, 74% of the lake is less than 15 feet in depth.  Historical secchi disk readings have ranged from 2.3 to 7.6 feet.   <br> \n     The majority of the shoreline of Fiske Lake remains undeveloped.  A DNR owned concrete public water access is located along the south shoreline of the lake.  The shoal water substrates consist primarily of sand and silt.  Stands of hardstem bulrush and common cattail are scattered along the entire lakeshore.  Emergent aquatic plants such as bulrush and cattail provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat, and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms, and can actually absorb and break down polluting chemicals.  Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish such as Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, and panfish.  They also serve as important nursery areas for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit.     <br> \n     A spring trapnetting survey was conducted to analyze the Black Crappie population.  Catch and length data indicate that a moderately abundant Black Crappie population with a high quality size structure exists in Fiske Lake.  Crappies ranged in length from 6.5 to 14.8 inches with an average length of 10.5 inches.  Seventy-four percent of the Black Crappies were 10.0 inches or greater in length and 12% were 12.0 inches or greater in length.  Black Crappies attain an average length of 10.2 inches at five years of age. <br> \n     Anglers can maintain the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large-size fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future.   <br> \n     Fiske Lake is not listed as an infested water.  Aquatic invasive species are threatening Minnesota waters.  The non-native species can potentially harm water quality, water recreation, aquatic habitat, native species, and fish populations.  Anglers can help prevent the introduction and spread of invasive species by following watercraft transportation laws.   <br> \n</p>",
