                "narrative": "<p>Teufer is a small (42 acre) relatively deep, productive lake approximately 2.5 miles east of Northome.  Fifty-five percent of the lake is less than 15 feet deep and the deepest spot is 52 feet. The deepest part of the lake is frequently void of oxygen both during the summer and winter.  The fish community has varied greatly through time, partly related to periodic partial fish kills.  However, the last partial fish kill was documented in 1986.  Teufer Lake is stocked with walleye fingerlings every other year. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye gill-net abundance in 2009 (5.00/net) was the second highest on record for Teufer Lake.  Walleye gill-net abundance has shown an increasing trend since 1993 corresponding to the same period that stocking has taken place in Teufer Lake. Age analysis of the 2009 catch indicated that all walleye captured corresponded to a stocked year-class. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye in the gill-net catch ranged in length from 10.6 to 21.30 inches.  The average length was 15.4 inches.  The average individual weight was 1.47 pounds.  Growth was average for the International Falls Management Area. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie trap-net abundance (11.11/net) exceeded the average of nine previous investigations on Teufer Lake.  Official records indicate that black crappie were not present in Teufer Lake prior to 1987.  Following introduction, the population rapidly increased, peaking in 1993.  Since then, abundance leveled off at a lower level however, the average size has improved.  Lengths of crappies in 2009 ranged from 4.92 to 12.28 inches with an average of 7.71 inches. <br> \n <br> \nMore largemouth bass were sampled during the 2009 investigation than any previous survey.  Bass were captured both in trap nets and by electrofishing.  Trap nets produced the highest catch ever of largemouth bass.  Electrofishing also produced more bass than average.  Several of these fish exceeded 16 inches in length.  The largest individual weighed 4.74 pounds.  <br> \n <br> \nOther species present in the 2009 catch include northern pike, yellow perch, golden shiner, pumpkinseed and white sucker.    <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Teufer is a small (39 acre) relatively deep, productive lake approximately 2.5 miles east of Northome.  Fifty-nine percent of the lake is less than 15 feet deep and the deepest spot is 52 feet. The deepest part of the lake is frequently void of oxygen both during the summer and winter.  The fish community has varied greatly through time, partly related to periodic partial fish kills.  However, the last partial fish kill was documented in 1986.  Teufer Lake is stocked with walleye fingerlings every other year. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye gill-net abundance in 2014 showed a decline from the last assessment in 2009 on Teufer Lake. However, walleye gill-net abundance had shown an increasing trend from 1993 to 2009 corresponding to the same period that stocking has taken place in Teufer Lake.  Age analysis of the 2014 catch indicated that all walleye captured corresponded to a stocked year-class. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye in the gill-net catch ranged in length from 10.04 to 18.03 inches.  The average length was 15.24 inches.  The average individual weight was 1.31 pounds.  Keeping in mind that only 9 fish were sampled, growth was very fast for the International Falls Management Area.   <br> \n <br> \nBluegills were sampled for the first time since 1984 and size was impressive. The average size captured was nearly 8.0 inches.  The trap net catch was 3.89 per net, above the 1st quartile of 1.44 but well below the median of 16.48.  Mean weight was between the median and 3rd quartile.  The average back-calculated length of bluegills at age 4 was 7.98 inches, which is more than 2 inches above the area average of 5.70.   <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie trap-net abundance (0.11/net) was the lowest since 1987 on Teufer Lake.  Official records indicate that black crappie were not present in Teufer Lake prior to 1987.  Following introduction, the population rapidly increased, peaking in 1993.  Since then, abundance leveled off at a lower level until this assessment.  The one crappie captured was aged at 8 years and 13.38 inches long. <br> \n <br> \nOne largemouth bass was sampled from a trap net during the 2014 investigation.  Electrofishing was not conducted in 2014.  <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Teufer is a class 8 lake located about 2.5 miles east of Northome, MN.  Fifty-five percent of the lake is less than 15 feet deep and the deepest spot is 52 feet.  The fish community has varied greatly through time, partly related to periodic partial fish kills.  However, the last partial fish kill was documented in 1986.        Black crappie were first documented by DNR staff in 1987.  In 2004, trap-net abundance was 13.11 fish/set, which was the second highest ever recorded.  Five year-classes were present and age ranged from 3-7 years.  Age-3 fish composed 67% of the sample, which should lead to good crappie fishing in the near future.  Total length in trap nets ranged from 6.5-10.0 inches and the mean was 7.5.  Growth was slower than the area average.    Largemouth bass were captured for the first time since 1974.  However, abudance in 2004 remained low (0.22 fish per trap-net set).Northern pike gill-net abundance was 13.33 fish/set, which was well above the third quartile of 5.10 fish/set for class 8 lakes.  Although northern pike were extremely abundant, size was still respectable.  Length ranged from 19.5 to 33.6 and the mean weight in gill nets of 2.89 pounds was above the third quartile of 2.21 pounds for class 8 lakes.  Four year-classes were present and age ranged from 3-6 years.  Growth rates were similar to area and statewide means.Pumpkinseed remained as one of the most abundant species sampled, as they have throughout the previous 18 years.  Trap-net abundance was 17.11, which was well above average for class 8 lakes.  Total length ranged from 3.5 to 6.4 inches.  The mean weight of 0.13 pounds was slightly above the third quartile of 0.10 pounds for class 8.  Walleye gill-net abundance was 2.67 fish/set, which was near the median of 2.83.  Scales and otoliths were used to determine that three year-classes were present and age ranged from 3-18 years.  All year-classes present corresponded to stocked years.  Total length ranged from 10.9-21.6 inches and the mean was 14.3.  Growth was below the area mean.  Mean weight in gill nets was 1.27 pounds, which was below the median value (1.52) for class 8 lakes.Yellow perch gill-net abundance was 116.67 fish/set, which was over 11 times higher than the third quartile of 10.25.  Six year-classes were sampled and age ranged from 2-7 years.  Age 4 fish composed 66% of the sample.  Total length in gill nets ranged from 5.2-9.4 inches and the mean was 6.7.  Total length at age 4 was 6.3 inches which was slightly below the area average of 6.6 inches.  Mean weight was nearly equal to the median for class 8 lakes. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Teufer is a 39 acre lake located in Koochiching County approximately 2.5 miles east of Northome, Minnesota. This small lake has a maximum depth of 52 feet and relatively good water clarity. There is a gravel boat access on the south side of the lake. Teufer is managed primarily for Walleye and is currently stocked with fingerlings in even numbered years. A standard fisheries survey was completed in 2019 as part of a regular rotation of surveys in the International Falls Management Area.  <br> \n <br> \nPanfish populations have fluctuated greatly since the first fisheries investigation in 1959. Bluegill were abundant in that first survey. By 1987, Bluegill had disappeared completely from the net catches and Black Crappie emerged in great numbers. By 2014, the Black Crappie population had declined and the Bluegill appeared in the net catches again. During this 2019 survey, Black Crappie were completely absent from the sample, and Bluegill were abundant. The average Bluegill measured approximately 6 inches and some up to 8.5 inches were caught.  <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass are also abundant in Teufer. Catch rates exceeded what would be expected for similar lakes, and they averaged slightly less than one pound. Smaller Largemouth are plentiful, but some larger fish over 18 inches are present. <br> \n  <br> \nThe Northern Pike population is good for a small lake. Abundance and size are above average for this type of lake. Pike averaged 22.5 inches and 2.5 pounds, with some fish up to nearly 30 inches in the survey gear.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye catch rates were within the expected range for Teufer. The average size was impressive at nearly 19 inches. The largest Walleye sampled was nearly 23 inches. Aging revealed that all Walleye were from stocked year classes, indicating that natural reproduction is probably not occurring.   <br> \n <br> \nThe Yellow Perch catch rate and average size were both impressive for this type of lake. Perch averaged nearly 7 inches and there were some up to nearly 11 inches. Growth appears to be faster than average International Falls area lakes.  <br> \n <br> \nOther species caught during this survey included Golden Shiner, Pumpkinseed Sunfish, and White Sucker.  <br> \n</p>",

The 1999 population assessment found high numbers of yellow perch averaging 6.4 inches in length.  Northern pike numbers also were high and they averaged 24.1 inches with a range from 18.6 to 30.0 inches.  Black crappie were plentiful even though they had declined from the previous investigation in 1993.  The average crappie measured 9.1 inches with a many individuals over 11 inches.  A few large, up to 26.1 inches, old walleyes were also sampled.</p>",

The average size of northern pike sampled was 2.0 pounds, which is near the average for lakes of this type.  Black crappie and pumpkinseed sunfish were both sampled in numbers considerably above what is commonly observed in similar lakes, suggesting a high density population of these species in Teupher Lake.  However, the size of both black crappie and pumpkinseed sunfish sampled was small, with average lengths of only 5.0\" and 4.4\" respectively.  Although walleye and largemouth bass have been reported in the past, neither of these species were sampled in this investigation.     </p>",
