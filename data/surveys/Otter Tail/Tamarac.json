                "narrative": "<p>Tamarack Lake is located in northwestern Otter Tail County approximately ten miles north of Pelican Rapids, MN.  Tamarack Lake is a 392-acre eutrophic (highly fertile) lake that is within the Otter Tail River watershed.  The maximum depth of Tamarack Lake is 11 feet.  The secchi disk reading during the 2001 lake survey was 6.0 feet.  Periodic plankton/algae blooms throughout the summer months can influence secchi disk readings.  Tamarack Lake is susceptible to periodic winterkill.  Dependent on the frequency of winterkill, fish community characteristics in this lake will be variable.  Tamarack Lake is included in lake class 42 of the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources' (DNR) lake classification scheme.  Tamarack Lake is located within the DNR's Fergus Falls Management Area.     Tamarack Lake is managed as a warm-water gamefish lake.  The majority of the shoreline of Tamarack Lake is developed.  The 1991 resurvey identified 99 homes/cottages on the lake.  A state owned public access is located off of state highway 34 along the south shoreline of the lake. The shoal water substrates consist primarily of sand and muck.  The only marsh areas on the lake are located in two small bays along the west shore of the lake.  Bulrush stands are located in the middle of the lake and along the northeast shore.  Cattails are scattered around the entire lake.  Emergent aquatic plants such as bulrush and cattails provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat, and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms, and can actually absorb and break down polluting chemicals.  They also serve as important nursery areas for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit.  To maintain the water quality and angling this lake has to offer, it is imperative to preserve the quality of the aquatic habitat.     Northern pike abundance increased since the 1996 survey, and exceeds the upper limit of the expected range for lake class 42.  Northern pike reproduction appears to be consistently good.  Northern pike ranged in length from 12.0 to 30.3 inches with an average length of 19.7 inches.  Pike attain an average length of 20.5 inches at five years of age which is below average compared to other class 42 lakes in the Fergus Falls Management Area.     The population of black bullheads in Tamarack Lake has substantially increased since the last survey in 1996.  The catch rates are well above the normal catch rates for lakes of this type.  The mean length of black bullhead in the sample was 5.0 inches.  A dramatic increase in black bullhead abundance sometimes indicates a degradation of water quality.  The abundance of yellow bullhead also increased from the 1996 survey and exceeds the normal range for lake class 42.       Bluegill abundance decreased since 1996 and falls below the normal range for class 42 lakes.  Data indicate that bluegill reproduction is inconsistent in Tamarack Lake.  The mean length of bluegills in the sample was 6.5 inches.       The black crappie catch rate remained unchanged from the 1996 assessment, and falls below the normal range for lakes of this type.  Black crappies were not sampled in the 1967 initial survey.  The suppression of the black crappie population may be linked to the excessive bullhead populations in Tamarack Lake.     Yellow perch abundance increased since 1996 and falls within the normal range for lake class 42.  The mean length of the perch in the gill net sample was 5.7 inches.  Historically, the yellow perch population in Tamarack Lake has been low but the catch rate in this survey was the highest ever recorded.     No walleyes were sampled in gill nets during this survey. The catch rate in 1996 was also very low.  Because of the tendency for this lake to winterkill, walleye abundance will most likely fluctuate.  Since 1997, Tamarack Lake has been stocked with 392,000 walleye fry on a biennial basis; however, none of these stockings have produced a viable year class.  Natural reproduction within the lake is unlikely due to the lack of suitable spawning habitat.    </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Tamarac Lake is located in northwestern Otter Tail County approximately ten miles north of Pelican Rapids, MN.  Tamarac Lake is a 392-acre eutrophic (highly fertile) lake that is within the Otter Tail River watershed.  The maximum depth of Tamarac Lake is 11 feet.  The secchi disk reading during the 2005 lake survey was 7.0 feet.  Tamarac Lake was susceptible to periodic winterkill; however, an aeration system has been installed and operated annually since 2003-2004 to help minimize winterkill.  Tamarac Lake is included in lake class 42 of the MN DNR lake classification scheme.  Tamarac Lake is located within the DNR's Fergus Falls Management Area.     Tamarac Lake is managed as a warm-water gamefish lake.  The majority of the shoreline of Tamarac Lake is developed.  A state owned public access is located off of State Highway 34 along the south shoreline of the lake. The shoal water substrates consist primarily of sand and muck.  The only marsh areas on the lake are located in two small bays along the west shore of the lake.  Hardstem bulrush stands are located in the middle of the lake and along the northeast shore.  Cattails are scattered around the entire lake.  Emergent aquatic plants such as bulrush and cattails provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat, and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms, and can actually absorb and break down polluting chemicals.  They also serve as important nursery areas for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit.  To maintain the water quality and angling this lake has to offer, it is imperative to preserve the quality of the aquatic habitat.     Northern pike abundance increased substantially since the 2001 survey, and exceeds the upper limit of the expected range for lake class 42.  Northern pike reproduction appears to be consistently good.  Northern pike ranged in length from 12.4 to 40.1 inches with an average length of 23.1 inches.  Pike attain an average length of 23.6 inches at six years of age which is below average compared to other class 42 lakes in the Fergus Falls Management Area.     The population of black and yellow bullheads in Tamarack Lake has substantially increased since the last survey in 2001.  The catch rates are well above the normal catch rates for lakes of this type.  The mean length of black and yellow bullheads in the sample was 5.7 and 7.2 inches, respectively.        Bluegill were not sampled in the 2005 survey.  The long-term trend has been a decline in bluegill abundance.  Data indicate that bluegill reproduction is inconsistent in Tamarack Lake.  In an effort to reestablish the bluegill population, the Tamarac Lake Association purchased and stocked 200 adult bluegill in 2005.  Adult bluegill were last stocked by the DNR after a winterkill in 1997.       The black crappie catch rate declined slightly from the 2001 assessment and is currently below the normal range for lakes of this type.  Black crappies were not sampled in the 1967 initial survey.  A summer kill of black crappie occurred in 2005 and likely was the result of columnaris disease.      Yellow perch abundance increased slightly since 2001 and falls within the normal range for lake class 42.  The mean length of the perch in the gill net sample was 6.1 inches.  Historically, the yellow perch population in Tamarack Lake has been low but the catch rate in the past two surveys have been the highest ever recorded.          Two walleye were represented in the gill net sample during this survey.  No walleye were sampled in the 2001 survey. The catch rate in 1996 was also very low.  Since 1997, the lake has been stocked with 392,000 walleye fry on a biennial basis; however, none of these stockings has produced a year class.  Due to the installation of an aeration system, management for walleye on Tamarac Lake will change from stocking walleye fry to stocking large walleye fingerlings or carry-over walleye on a biennial basis starting in 2007.  The Tamarac Lake Association stocked 1,500 walleye fingerlings in 2005.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>     Tamarac Lake is a 392-acre eutrophic (fertile) lake located in northwestern Otter Tail County approximately ten miles north of Pelican Rapids, MN.  The immediate watershed is composed primarily of agricultural land interspersed with hardwood woodlots.  The maximum depth of Tamarac Lake is 11 feet.  The secchi disk reading was 5.9 feet.  Previous secchi disk reading have ranged from 4.6 to 8.2 feet.       <br> \n     Tamarac Lake has a history of experiencing periodic winterkills which has corresponded to large fluctuations in gamefish abundance.  An aeration system was purchased for Tamarac Lake in 2002 to minimize the possibility of winterkill during severe winters; however, it was not operated during the winter of 2013 and Tamarac Lake experienced a significant winterkill.   <br> \n     The majority of the shoreline is developed.  Homes and cottages compose the majority of the development.  A DNR owned concrete public access is located off of County Road 34 along the south shoreline.  Main lake shoreline substrates consist primarily of sand and muck.  The only marsh areas on the lake are located in two small bays along the west shore of the lake.  Hardstem Bulrush stands are located in the middle of the lake and along the northeast shoreline.  Stands of Common Cattail are scattered around the entire lake.  Emergent plants are important because they provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines from erosion and can even absorb and breakdown pollutants from the water.  Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish species such as Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass and panfish.  They also are important nursery areas for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological importance, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit. <br> \n     Tamarac Lake can be ecologically classified as a bass-panfish type of lake and this is reflected in the assemblage of the fish community.  Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, Black Crappie, and Bluegill are the dominant gamefish species.  <br> \n     A very high-density Northern Pike population exists.  Age data indicate that pike reproduction is consistently good.  Pike ranged in length from 15.8 to 30.4 inches with an average length and weight of 20.0 inches and 1.6 pounds.  Pike attain an average length of 23.7 inches at four years of age. <br> \n     Bluegills are abundant.  Bluegills sampled via trap net ranged in length from 3.5 to 10.2 inches with a mean length of 6.3 inches.  Fifteen percent of the Bluegills were 7.0 inches or greater in length.  Bluegills attain a mean length of 6.7 inches at age-III.   <br> \n     Black Crappie and Largemouth Bass are present but are low in abundance.  The low catch rates are not surprising as the lake is still recovering from the 2013 winterkill.  Even though numbers are low, it is good to see the presence of these game fish species and that they are beginning to be re-established. <br> \n     Anglers can maintain the quality of angling by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large-size fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future. <br> \n     Tamarac Lake is not listed as an infested water.  Aquatic invasive species are threatening Minnesota waters.  The non-native species can potentially harm water quality, water recreation, aquatic habitat, native species, and fish populations.  Anglers can help prevent the introduction and spread of invasive species by following watercraft transportation laws.  Anglers are required to remove all visible plants, mud, and other prohibited invasive species and drain all water from their boat prior to leaving the water access.   </p>",

Other area lakes in this class are: Adley and Fish. <br> \n     The northern pike gill net catch rate was 6.5 per net, which is within the normal range for this lake class.  Average individual weight of northern pike was 1.2 pounds.  Recruitment appears to be inconsistent as 87% of the sample was from the 1989 and 1990 year classes.   <br> \n     The black bullhead gill net catch rate was 72.5 per net, which is within the normal range for this lake class; however, the catch rate of 362.5 per trap net is 4.5 times higher than the upper limit of the normal range.   <br> \n     Bluegill abundance was within the normal range at 18.8 per trap net lift.  Only 5% of the bluegills measured exceeded seven inches in length.  Bluegill growth rates were extremely variable, possibly due to fluctuations in year class strength. <br> \n     Largemouth bass abundance was within the normal range and recruitment appears to be consistent.   <br> \n     Walleyes were not represented in the gill net sample.  Walleye fry have been stocked seven out of the last ten years. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>     Tamarac Lake is a 392-acre eutrophic (fertile) located in northwestern Otter Tail County approximately ten miles north of Pelican Rapids, MN.  The immediate watershed is composed of agricultural land interspersed with hardwood woodlots.  The maximum depth of Tamarac Lake is 11 feet.  The secchi disk reading during the 2010 lake survey was 5.6 feet.  Previous secchi disk readings have ranged from 4.6 to 8.2 feet.  Tamarac Lake was susceptible to periodic winterkill; however, an aeration system has been installed and has operated annually since 2004 to minimize winterkill.  As a result, gamefish populations have stabilized.   <br> \n     The majority of the shoreline of Tamarac Lake is developed.  Homes and cottages compose a majority of the development.  A state owned public access is located off of County Road 34 along the south shoreline of the lake. The shoal water substrates consist primarily of sand and muck.  The only marsh areas on the lake are located in two small bays along the west shore of the lake.  Hardstem bulrush stands are located in the middle of the lake and along the northeast shoreline.  Stands of common cattails are scattered around the entire lake.  Emergent aquatic plants such as bulrush and cattails provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat, and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms, and can actually absorb and break down polluting chemicals.  They also serve as important nursery areas for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit.  To maintain the water quality and angling this lake has to offer, it is imperative to preserve the quality of the aquatic habitat. <br> \n     A very high-density northern pike population exists.  Northern pike reproduction is consistently good.  Northern pike ranged in length from 9.6 to 34.4 inches with an average length and weight of 19.4 inches and 1.6 pounds.  Pike attain an average length of 25.1 inches at five years of age. <br> \n     Bluegill abundance is increasing and is within the expected range for this type of lake.  Size structure is good as 84% of the bluegills were 7.0 inches or greater in length.  Bluegills attain an average length of 7.1 inches at four years of age. <br> \n     Black crappie abundance is also increasing and is within the expected range.  Black crappie reproduction appears to be consistently good as five consecutive year classes were sampled.  Thirteen percent of the crappies were 10.0 inches or greater in length.  Crappies attain an average length of 8.3 inches at four years of age. <br> \n     Walleye abundance has historically been very low.  Walleye abundance is likely limited by the high-density pike population via predation.      <br> \n     Anglers can maintain the quality of angling by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large size fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future.      <br> \n</p>",
