The landscape is covered primarily by large pines and other conifers. <br> \n <br> \nAccess is by portage from either Pine Creek from the west or Buck Lake from the east. Both portages are moderately difficult and are approximately 3/4 miles in length. There are two designated USFS campsites located on the lake. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass numbers in 2015 (7.3/gill net) were well above average (0.4/gill net) when compared to other similar lakes in this class. The average largemouth sampled was 14.5 inches long and about 8 or 9 years old. Thirty-three percent of the largemouth aged were older than 10 years and the oldest largemouth aged was 18 years old. The largest largemouth sampled was 18.4 inches long. Light fishing pressure and low harvest have likely contributed to the success of this largemouth bass population and anglers are encouraged to practice catch and release to foster their continued success. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike abundance in 2015 (5.0/gill net) was slightly above average when compared to other similar lakes in this class. The average pike sampled was 23.8 inches long and the largest pike was 29.1 inches. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill, hybrid sunfish and rock bass were sampled in relatively low numbers and small sizes. White sucker were also sampled. Yellow perch were observed in several stomach samples from pike and largemouth bass. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",
