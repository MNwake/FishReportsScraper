                "narrative": "<p>Hunt Lake is a 160-acre lake located approximately 2.5 miles southwest of the town of Shieldsville in Rice County. Hunt Lake has a maximum depth of 27 feet with approximately 84% of the lake less than 15 feet deep. A DNR owned concrete ramp is located on the north side of the lake off County Road 37. Hunt Lake is primarily managed for Black Crappie, Bluegills, and Largemouth Bass and secondarily for Largemouth Bass, Walleye and Northern Pike. The management plan calls for stocking winter rescue adult Northern Pike when available. The latest stocking events include Northern Pike adults in 2019 and Walleye fry in 2023. Hunt Lake experienced a light winterkill during the winter of 2022-2023.  <br> \n <br> \nA standard survey was completed the week of 24 July 2023 as part of a regular monitoring program conducted by the Minnesota DNR. This survey was intended to assess the fish community by deploying 6 gill nets, 9 trap nets, and boat electrofishing. Water quality parameters were also recorded. <br> \n <br> \nA total of 25 Black Crappie were sampled with gill nets for a catch rate of 4.2/net. Black Crappie ranged from 4.7 to 15.8 inches with an average of 6.4 inches. An additional 47 Black Crappie ranging from 4.3 to 15.9 inches were sampled with trap nets. Black Crappie were aged using otoliths and scales and ranged from age-1 to age-9 with 8 year classes present, indicating consistent recruitment. Age-1 accounted for 47% of the sample. As the young fish continue to grow, the size structure should improve and the presence of fish over 15 inches long hints at the potential for great Black Crappie angling in Hunt Lake. <br> \n <br> \nA total of 89 Bluegill were sampled with trap nets for a catch rate of 9.9/net. This was similar to the 2017 catch rate of 13.6/net. Bluegills in 2023 ranged from 3.0 to 8.7 inches with an average of 5.7 inches. Bluegill ages were determined using otoliths and scales and ranged from age-1 to age-5 with 5 year classes present. Forty-two percent of the population was age-3. The lack of older fish was likely responsible for the poor size structure which should improve over time. <br> \n <br> \nA total of 16 Largemouth Bass were sampled using daytime boat electrofishing for a catch rate of 16.8/hour. Largemouth Bass ranged from 3.6 to 19.2 inches with an average of 14.3 inches. Although not sampled in high numbers, there appeared to be a healthy Largemouth Bass population in Hunt Lake in 2023 and the length frequency distribution indicated consistent natural reproduction and recruitment. <br> \n <br> \nA total of 23 Northern Pike were sampled with gill nets for a catch rate of 3.8/net. Northern Pike lengths ranged from 21.7 to 35.8 inches and averaged 25.9 inches. Over 56% of Northern Pike sampled exceeded the 24-inch minimum length limit. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch continued to decline in 2023 with a total of 46 sampled with gill nets for a catch rate of 7.7/net. After an all-time high of 31.7/net in 2007, numbers fell to 17.0/net in 2013, 9.3 in 2017 before falling again in 2023. Yellow Perch in 2023 were small, ranging from 5.5 to 9.5 inches with an average of 7.0 inches. Yellow Perch are not a managed game species in Hunt Lake but are important prey for predator species and could periodically provide an additional angling opportunity. <br> \n <br> \nCommon Carp numbers remained low in 2023. Only two fish was sampled with gill nets for a catch rate of 0.3/net. Catch rates have varied from 0.2/net to 3.3/net with an average of 1.3/net since 1983. Like Northern Pike, Common Carp numbers may be limited due to a lack of connectivity to suitable spawning habitat. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Bullhead were the most abundant fish sampled with gill nets in 2023. A total of 81 were sampled with gill nets for a catch rate of 13.5/net. The catch rate in 2017 was 47.7/net. Catch rates have been highly variable ranging from 2.8/net to 313.2/net with an average of 77.7/net since 1983. Black Bullheads ranged in size from 5.5 to 15.2 inches with an average of 12.7 inches. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled in 2023 include Bigmouth Buffalo, Golden Shiner, White Crappie, and Yellow Bullhead. <br> \n <br> \nWater quality parameter measurements include water temperature, and dissolved oxygen readings. Parameters ranged from 81.7 degrees Fahrenheit and 13.1 ppm at the surface to 74.3 degrees Fahrenheit and 0.1 ppm at 10 feet. A thermocline was detected between 6 and 9 feet and dissolved oxygen was depleted at approximately 9 feet. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers can play an important role in maintaining or improving a fish population by practicing selective harvest. Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for consumption, while encouraging the release of medium to large fish that may contribute to natural reproduction. This practice helps maintain balance in the fish populations and provides anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future. Additionally, smaller fish often taste better and have fewer contaminants than larger, older fish from the same water body. <br> \n <br> \nShoreline property owners also play an important role in the overall health of an aquatic ecosystem, including the fish population. Natural shorelines, including vegetation, woody debris, and bottom substrates, provide valuable habitat for fish and wildlife, help maintain water quality, and reduce bank erosion. Cattails and bulrushes are particularly beneficial for fish spawning, rearing, and feeding. By leaving natural shorelines unaltered or restoring them to natural conditions, shoreline property owners are doing their part to maintain or improve a healthy ecosystem in the lake and protect the resource for future generations. <br> \n <br> \n-Tyler Fellows, fisheries specialist <br> \n</p>",

Yellow perch, golden shiner and black crappie were  the most common species in gill net catches.  Bluegill were abundant in trap nets with fewer yellow bullhead, black crappie, and freshwater drum. Bluegill up to 7.5 inches were captured, although, most were 4 to 7 inches.  Most black crappie were between 5 and 9 inches, with some larger 10 - 12.5 inches.  Yellow bullhead were large with some 12 to 15 inches.  Northern pike up to 35 inches were sampled.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Hunt Lake (190.0 acres) is located in Rice County near the Town of Shieldsville. Residential development has disturbed and altered much of the shoreline on the northwest, west, and southeast sides of Hunt Lake. Remaining natural shoreline is limited to the northeast corner and south shore of the lake. In areas with residential development, lawns are typically maintained to the shores edge, thereby disrupting the natural riparian buffer. A DNR owned boat ramp is located in the northeast corner of the lake. The sport fish community consists of black crappie, bluegill, largemouth bass, northern pike, and yellow perch. Hunt Lake experienced a partial winterkill during the winter of 2010 -2011. Sport fish populations still existed following the winterkill, but were present in low numbers. Northern pike fingerlings and adults have been stocked extensively, being stocked in 2003, 2007, 2009, and 2011. The current management plan calls for 201 pounds of adult northern pike to be stocked when available. Black crappie, bluegill, largemouth bass, and yellow perch populations are maintained through natural reproduction. A population assessment was conducted on 7-23-12 to monitor the sport fish community in Hunt Lake using 6 gill nets and 7 trap nets.  <br> \n <br> \nWater quality metrics were collected on 7-23-2012. Hunt Lake was experiencing an algae bloom as the water appeared green in color, and had a secchi depth of 1.0 ft. Dissolved oxygen ranged from 11.3 at the surface to 0.0 at 20.0 ft. Thermal stratification of the water column occurred between 14.0 and 16.0 ft of depth as evidenced by a drop in temperature from 77.9 to 72.3 degrees Fahrenheit. <br> \n <br> \nPrimary management species on Hunt Lake include bluegill and black crappie. Past bluegill catch rates in Hunt Lake have been highly variable, ranging from 0.3/trap net in 1983 to 54.8/trap net in 1988. In 2012, bluegill abundance was 14.3/trap net, which is low when compared to similar lakes. Four year classes were sampled (2007, 2008, 2009, and 2011), with age-4 bluegills representing 45% of the sample. Bluegill size structure was good, with fish ranging from 3.0 to 7.8 inches in length and averaged 5.9 inches. Bluegill growth was good, with mean length at age estimates being 3.5 inches at age-1, 6.0 inches at age-3, 6.9 inches at age-4, and 7.5 inches at age-5.  <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappies were captured at a rate of 23.7/gill net, which is high when compared to similar lakes Past black crappie catch rates have been variable with gill net catch rates ranging from 7.3/gill net in 2007 to 39.0/gill net in 1983. Gill netted black crappie size was small, ranging in length from 0.9 to 8.9 inches and averaging 7.2 inches. Three year classes were sampled (2009, 2010, and 2011), with age-3 (2009 year class) black crappies being the most abundant, representing 52% of the crappies in the sample. Black crappie lengths averaged 4.8 inches at age-1, 6.6 inches at age-2, and 7.6 inches at age-3.  <br> \n <br> \nSecondary management species on Hunt Lake include northern pike and largemouth bass. Historically, northern pike have occurred in low numbers in Hunt Lake, as catch rates had not exceeded 2.8/gill net dating back to the 1950's. In 2012, northern pike were very abundant, as they were captured at a rate of 13.5/gill net, which high when compared to similar lakes. Five year classes of northern pike were present in the sample (2006, 2008, 2009, 2010, and 2011), with age-2 and age-3 (2010 and 2009 year classes) northern pike representing 88% of the sample. Since northern pike were stocked as unknown age adults, it cannot be identified which stockings were successful or if natural reproduction has occurred.  <br> \n <br> \nThe 2012 yellow perch catch rate (17.0/gill net) decreased from the 2007 survey (31.7/gill net), but was more consistent with past catch rates, and was slightly above what is expected for similar lakes. Four year classes of yellow perch were sampled including 2007 (age-5), 2008 (age-4), 2009 (age-3), and 2010 (age-2). Yellow perch were small ranging in length from 6.1 to 9.8 inches and averaging 7.7 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nIn 2012, black bullheads were very abundant and were caught at a rate of 313.2/gill net, which is high when compared to similar lakes. Historical catch rates of black bullhead have been highly variable as catch rates have ranged from 2.8/gill net in 2001 to 130.0/gill net in 1988. The 2012 catch rate is the highest observed catch rate of black bullhead on Hunt Lake. The majority of black bullheads were small, as 85% of them were less than 7.0 inches in length.   <br> \n <br> \nPast surveys have indicated the presence of freshwater drum; however no drum were sampled in 2012.  One green sunfish was sampled, the first time their presence has been documented. Bigmouth buffalo, common carp, golden shiner, largemouth bass, walleye, white crappie, yellow bullhead, green sunfish, hybrid sunfish, and pumpkinseed were also present in this survey, but occurred in low numbers. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers can help maintain or improve the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for table fare, but encourages release of medium- to large-sized fish.  Releasing these fish can help maintain balance in the fish community and provide anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future.  <br> \n <br> \nShoreline areas on the land and into the shallow water provide essential habitat for fish and wildlife that live in or near Minnesota's lakes.  Overdeveloped shorelines cannot support the fish, wildlife, and clean water that are associated with natural undeveloped lakes.  Shoreline habitat consists of aquatic plants, woody plants, and natural lake bottom soils.  <br> \n <br> \nPlants in the water and at the water's edge provide habitat, prevent erosion, and absorb excess nutrients.  Shrubs, trees, and woody debris such as fallen trees or limbs provide good habitat both above and below the water and should be left in place.  By leaving a buffer strip of natural vegetation along the shoreline, property owners can reduce erosion, help maintain water quality, and provide habitat and travel corridors for wildlife. <br> \n</p>",

A fishery survey was conducted on Hunt Lake in late July 2001 to assess the fish community.  Freshwater drum and yellow perch were the most common species in gill net catches.  Bluegill, freshwater drum, and yellow bullhead were the most abundant species in trap net catches.  Bluegill up to 8 inches were captured, although most were around 4 to 7 inches.  Most black crappie were between 7 to 9 inches.  Yellow bullhead in Hunt Lake were large with an average length of 13 inches.  Northern pike up to 29 inches were caught during the survey.  </p>",

Dead fish were observed including Common Carp, Northern Pike, and Largemouth Bass however winterkill appears light as many gamefish species were sampled. Adult Bluegill and Yellow Perch were abundant, adult Northern Pike and Largemouth Bass were present. Young Black Crappies were abundant and 1 adult Black Crappie was sampled. Also abundant were Black Bullheads and Golden Shiners.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Hunt Lake is a 160 acre lake located approximately 2.5 miles southwest of the town of Shieldsville in Rice County. It has a maximum depth of 27 feet with approximately 84% of the lake classified as littoral area (less than 15 feet deep). A DNR owned concrete ramp is located on the north side of the lake off of County Road 37. The lake is primarily managed for Black Crappie and Bluegills and secondarily for Largemouth Bass and Northern Pike. The management plan calls for stocking winter rescue adult Northern Pike when available. The latest stocking events include Northern Pike adults in 2011 and 2009.  <br> \n <br> \nA standard survey was completed in 2017 as part of a regular monitoring program conducted by the Minnesota DNR. A standard survey is used for sampling a wide range of fish species during the summer months using standard methods (i.e. standard time of year, set sampling stations, taking water clarity readings and oxygen/temperature profiles, etc.) and gears (i.e. lake survey gillnets, trap nets, and spring electrofishing for Largemouth Bass). This survey was intended to assess the fish community by deploying 6 gill nets, 8 trap nets, and 84 minutes of boat electrofishing. Water quality parameters were also recorded. <br> \n <br> \nA total of 125 Black Crappie were sampled with gill nets for a catch rate of 20.8/net, which indicated high numbers were present. The previous catch rate was 23.7/net in 2012. Since 1983, catch rates have varied from 7.3/net to 39.0/net with a mean of 23.0/net. Lengths in 2017 ranged from 4.3 to 14.8 inches with an average of 6.4 inches. Only 4% of the catchable population exceeded 8 inches in length. An additional 135 fish ranging from 4.5 to 11.8 inches were sampled with trap nets. Fish ranged from 1 to 7 years old with 4 year classes present. One and three year old fish accounted for 88% of the sample. <br> \n <br> \nA total of 109 Bluegill were sampled with trap nets for a catch rate of 13.6/net, which indicated low to moderate numbers were present. This was similar to the 2012 catch rate of 14.3/net. Since 1983, catch rates have varied from 0.3/net to 54.8/net with an average of 21.2/net. Lengths in 2017 ranged from 3.0 to 6.4 inches with an average of 4.8 inches. Only 6% of the population was greater than 6 inches. Fish were mostly young with just 2% of the population older than 3 years. <br> \n <br> \nA total of 24 Largemouth Bass were sampled using boat electrofishing for a catch rate of 17.0/hour, which was similar to the only other electrofishing sample of 15.5/hour collected in 2007. Lengths ranged from 3.0 to 18.9 inches with an average of 10.9 inches. Approximately 67% of the population exceeded 15 inches in length. Although not sampled in high numbers, there appeared to be a healthy, self-sustaining Largemouth Bass population in Hunt Lake in 2017. <br> \n <br> \nA total of 23 Northern Pike were sampled with gill nets for a catch rate of 4.0/net, which indicated low to moderate numbers were present. The previous catch rate was 13.5/net in 2012. Before 2007, Northern Pike were relatively rare with an average catch rate of just 1.2/net. In the 3 samples since 2007, catch rates have increased to an average of 6.8/net. The adults stocked in 2009 and 2011 may be responsible for the higher catch rates in 2012 and 2017. Limited spawning habitat may have been responsible for the low catch rates prior to 2007. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch continued to decline in 2017 with a total of 56 sampled with gill nets for a catch rate of 9.3/net, which indicated moderate numbers were present. After an all-time high of 31.7/net in 2007, numbers fell to 17.0/net in 2013 before falling again in 2017. Overall since 1983, numbers have been relatively high with an average of 14.8/net. Fish were small in 2017, ranging from 5.2 to 9.1 inches with an average of 6.7 inches. Ages ranged from 1 to 6 years old with 5 year classes present. Approximately 68% of the sample was 2 years old. Yellow Perch are not a managed game species in Hunt Lake but are important food for predator species and could periodically provide an additional angling opportunity.  <br> \n <br> \nCommon Carp numbers remained low in 2017. Only one 21.7 inch fish was sampled with gill nets for a catch rate of 0.2/net, which was the lowest catch rate on record. Since 1983, catch rates have varied from 0.2/net to 3.3/net with an average of 1.5/net. Like Northern Pike, Carp numbers may be limited due to a lack of connectivity to suitable spawning habitat. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Bullhead were the most abundant fish sampled in 2017. A total of 286 were sampled with gill nets for a catch rate of 47.7/net, which indicated moderate to high numbers were present. The catch rate in 2012 was 313.2/net, which was easily the highest on record. Since 1983, catch rates have been highly variable ranging from 2.8/net to 313.2/net with an average of 77.7/net. A 2010 partial winterkill was likely responsible for the massive increase in Black Bullhead in 2012. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled in 2017 include Bigmouth Buffalo, Bowfin, Brown Bullhead, Golden Shiner, Pumpkinseed, White Crappie, Yellow Bullhead, and one possible hybrid crappie. <br> \n <br> \nWater quality parameter measurements include water temperature, and dissolved oxygen readings. Parameters ranged from 78.3 degrees Fahrenheit and 7.4 ppm at the surface to 63.3 degrees Fahrenheit and 0.0 ppm at 21 feet. A thermocline was detected between 11 and 15 feet and dissolved oxygen was depleted at approximately 11 feet. <br> \n <br> \n-Sky Wigen, fisheries specialist <br> \n</p>",
