                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of the nearshore fish community in Geneva Lake was conducted by Fisheries Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program Staff from 9-12 August 2021.  Fourteen sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 15-foot or 50-foot seine, where possible.  Backpack electrofishing was completed at all 14 sites with two sites sampled from the boat.  A 50-foot seine was used to sample 9 sites, a 15-foot seine was used at two sites, and soft sediments with abundant vegetation and deep water prevented the use of seines at three sampling sites.  Nearshore sampling captured 21 native species of fish including eight species that are intolerant of disturbance (Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, Mimic Shiner, Pugnose Shiner, Rock Bass, and Smallmouth Bass) and one species (Green Sunfish) that is tolerant of disturbance. <br> \n <br> \nA concurrent summer trap net survey was conducted on 9-11 August 2021 by IBI Program Staff.  Nine trap nets were set along the shoreline that encompassed multiple habitat types.  Bluegill comprised a majority of the trap net catch by number and Yellow Bullhead, Common Carp, and Bluegill comprised a majority of the catch by biomass.  The number of Bluegill sampled per net was above the 50% quartile for similar Lake Class 27 lakes and the average length was 5.4 inches, with 7% over 7 inches. <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore and trap net data were combined with gill net data from an August 2020 survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based IBI (FIBI) score.  The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment.  In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g., Blackchin Shiner, Iowa Darter, and Rock Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g., Black Bullhead, Fathead Minnow, and Green Sunfish).  The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake.  For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.   <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Long Prairie River Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Walleye gillnet catches increased from 5.1 fish/net in 1992 to 14.6 fish/net in 1996.  The normal rangeof mean catch rates from lakes with similar chemical and physical characteristics is 3.3 - 8.8fish/gillnet.  Gillnet catches have ranged from 2.0 to 9.5 fish/net in previous surveys dating back to1980.  Mean weight of fish captured in 1996 was 1.1 pounds.  Approximately one-third of the fish were15 inches in length or greater and 8% exceeded 20 inches.  There appears to be some correlation betweenrecent fingerling stockings and relative year class strength.  Northern pike catches averaged 5.0fish/gillnet.  Gillnet catches have been fairly consistent in surveys dating back to 1980, ranging from1.5 to 5.0 fish/net.   The normal range of mean catch rates from similar lakes is 2.8 - 9.0fish/gillnet.  Mean weight of fish captured in 1996 was 2.8 pounds.  Three-fourths of the fish capturedwere 21 inches in length or greater and 9% exceeded 28 inches.  Lake Geneva supports an abundantlargemouth bass population and is well-known for quality angling opportunities.  Night, DCelectrofishing yielded 105.5 stock-size fish per hour.  Only thirty minutes of sampling was completedbecause of the high catch rates.  Approximately 80% of the fish were 12 inches in length or greater and8% exceeded 15 inches.  Bluegill catches decreased from 44.4 fish/trapnet in 1992 to 11.4 fish/trapnetin 1996.  Trapnet catches ranged from 44.4 to 95.4 fish/net in previous surveys dating back to 1980. Gillnet catches also declined from 54.1 fish/net in 1992 to 10.7 fish/net in 1996.  Size structure ofthe bluegill population is poor.  Only one in four fish was 6 inches or greater.  The age classdistribution of bluegill captured in trapnets suggests poor recruitment during the cool summers of 1992and 1993.  Reduced catch rates are likely a result of these weak year classes.  This trend is apparentin other lakes within the Glenwood Management Area surveyed during 1996.  Yellow perch catches averaged24.0 fish/gillnet, similar to the catch rate of 29.1 fish/gillnet recorded in 1992.  Gillnet catcheshave ranged from 8.6 to 63.9 fish/net in previous surveys dating back to 1980.  Black crappie are noteffectively sampled with standard survey gear during summer months.  Black crappie catches averaged 0.6fish/trapnet and 1.4 fish/gillnet.  These catch rates are similar to catch rates recorded in previoussurveys.  Total length of the fish captured ranged from 6.3 to 7.9 inches.   </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Geneva is a 631-acre lake located on the eastern edge of the city of Alexandria and is part of the Alexandria Chain of Lakes.  A navigable connection exists to Lake Le Homme Dieu.  A connection also exists to Lake Victoria, but shallow water can make navigation difficult or impossible for some boats.  There are two public accesses on Lake Geneva.  The access on the east shoreline is steep and more difficult to use.  The access on the northwest shoreline is more user friendly.  There is also a handicap-accessible public fishing pier located near the public access on the northwest shore.  The fishing pier is located in a shallow bay that is a popular fishing spot for anglers throughout the open water season, particularly in the spring.  Boaters should be cautious of navigation hazards on the lake.  Several shallow bars extend into the lake.  Much of the shoreline on Lake Geneva has been developed.  A trend of increasing water clarity continues.  Water transparency was 21.0 feet at time of the 2016 survey.  <br> \n  <br> \nLake Geneva supports a modest Walleye fishery.  The fishery is maintained by some limited natural recruitment, fish movements among lakes, and supplemental stockings of Walleyes.  Gill net catch rates declined in 2016 to 3.4 Walleyes/net.  Average length of Walleye captures was 16.1 inches.  Age distribution of catches extended to age 8.  The largest Walleye captured measured 23.5 inches. <br> \n <br> \nLake Geneva supports abundant populations of Largemouth Bass, Northern Pike, and Bluegill.  Due to moderate fertility of the lake and high abundance of these fishes, growth rates are slow.  Fortunately, gamefishes in Lake Geneva live to be quite old, thus it does support some larger fish.  Bluegills over 8 inches were caught during the survey.  Largemouth Bass also grow slow but have been shown to live up to 19 years old in the Alexandria Chain of Lakes.  The largest bass caught during the survey was 18.3 inches.  Few Black Crappies are caught during summer surveys since larger fish move off-shore and are less vulnerable to capture in trap nets.  Low catch rates recorded in surveys does not accurately reflect abundance and size distribution.  Lake Geneva does support good crappie fishing.  Yellow Perch catches and average size of perch captured during surveys have declined over the last few surveys. Yellow Perch are preferred prey of Walleye, Northern Pike, and Largemouth Bass.  <br> \n <br> \nQuality fishing opportunities exist for many species in Lake Geneva.  Even modest harvest of older fish can degrade fishing quality.  Anglers are encouraged to practice selective harvest to help maintain and improve the quality of the Lake Geneva fishery.  Selective harvest practices encourage release of larger fish while encouraging harvest of more abundant smaller fish. Releasing medium to large fish will help restore and maintain fish community balance, as well as increase opportunities to catch large fish in the future. <br> \n <br> \nLake Geneva was designated as an infested water after the discovery of zebra mussels in 2009.  Minnesota statutes require all equipment be free of invasive species prior to leaving any access.  Recreational users should take necessary precautions to prevent the further spread of invasive species. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

However, the 1987 walleye fingerling stocking of 509 lbs was comprised of carry-over (age-1) fish from Lovers Lake. Lake Geneva may also receive fish runs from lakes Le Homme Dieu and Victoria. Northern pike appear to recruit well to desirable sizes. Twenty-eight percent were over 25 inches in length.  Yellow perch abundance has declined significantly from previous surveys. Although perch abundance has declined, they should still provide an adequate forage base for walleye and northern pike. Northern cisco and small centrarchids are also present in sufficient numbers to contribute to the forage base. Bluegill trapnet catch rate remains high at 52.2 fish/trapnet, but size structure and fishing quality is poor. Mean weight is very small. Previous creel survey data would suggest a quality largemouth bass and black crappie fishery.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Geneva supports an abundant and diverse community of aquatic vegetation.  Submergent vegetation grows to a depth of sixteen feet and dense beds of vegetation cover areas of the lake basin which are less than five feet in depth. This area less than five feet in depth comprises 75% percent of the littoral zone.  The abundance of submergent vegetation likely limits the feeding efficiency of predators.  Emergent vegetation covers approximately five percent of the surface area of the lake which is similar to the coverage reported in the 1980 lake survey.  Walleye catch rate averaged 5.1 fish/gillnet in 1992 which is within the normal range of mean catch rates (1.0-5.8 fish/gillnet) for lakes within lake classification 24.  Catch rates have ranged from 2.0 fish/gillnet to 9.5 fish/gillnet in four previous surveys dating back to 1966.  A long range goal of 10 fish/gillnet is stated in the lake management plan.  The mean weight of fish captured in gillnets was 1.6 pounds.  PSD and RSD-P were calculated at 46.3% and 17.1%, respectively. Cohorts of the 1989 year class (age 3) comprised 48% of the fish captured.  Fingerlings were stocked in 1989 and yearlings (1989 year class) were stocked in 1990.  Both of these stockings may have contributed to year class strength.  This large year class may have suppressed the mean growth rate of Walleye in Lake Geneva.  Age 3 fish (1989 year class) averaged 11.9 inches in length at time of capture.  This growth rate is less than the mean growth of Walleye in other area lakes within lake class 24.  Daytime AC electrofishing yielded 20.0 stock sized largemouth bass per hour.  Substock catch rate averaged 35.3 fish per hour.  This is the first electrofishing sample completed on Lake Geneva; therefore, there is no historic data to compare catch rates. PSD and RSD-P were calculated at 40% and 10%, respectively.  The catch rate and size structure recorded during electrofishing approximates the long range goals for the largemouth bass population stated in the lake management plan.  Largemouth bass growth in Lake Geneva is similar to the mean growth rate of largemouth bass in other area lakes within lake class 24 and is similar to the growth rates of largemouth bass in other lakes within the Alexandria chain.  Age 4 fish average 11.1 inches in total length at time of annulus formation.  Bluegill are abundant in Lake Geneva.  Bluegill catch rate averaged 44.4 fish/trapnet in 1992.  A similar catch rate of 52.2 fish/trapnet was recorded during the 1988 population assessment.  The normal range of mean trapnet catch rates from lakes within lake class 24 is 1.5 - 67.5 fish/trapnet.  Gillnet catch rate averaged 54.1 fish/net which is indicative of an abundant population. The normal range of mean gillnet catch rates is 1.5 - 13.0 fish/net.  The mean weight of fish captured in trapnets was 0.1 pounds and PSD was calculated at 24.9%.  Larger fish were captured in gillnets.  The mean weight of fish captured in gillnets was 0.2 pounds and PSD was calculated at 84.8%.  Bluegill growth in Lake Geneva is poor. The mean growth rate is slightly less than the mean growth rate of bluegill from other area lakes within lake class 24, however the mean growth rate is similar to other lakes within the Alex chain. Age 5 fish average 5.0 inches in total length at time of annulus formation.  The density of the bluegill population is likely suppressing growth rates. Dense beds of submergent vegetation in the shallow areas of the lake provide optimum spawning habitat and escape cover for bluegill.  Control of bluegill abundance by predatory fish may be limited by the expansive areas of aquatic vegetation.  Northern pike abundance is low.  Gillnet catches averaged 1.5 fish/net in 1992.  Catch rates have been historically low, ranging from 2.3-5.0 fish/net in previous surveys dating back to 1966.  The normal range of mean catch rates for lakes within lake class 24 is 3.0-10.2 fish/gillnet.  Previous surveys have noted a lack of suitable marsh spawning habitat for northern pike.  The size structure and age class distribution of fish captured in 1992 suggests only limited natural reproduction.  PSD and RSD-P were calculated at 100% and 25%, respectively.  Ages 4-8 were the only year classes represented in the catch.  Yellow perch catch rate rebounded from a low of 8.6 fish/gillnet in 1988 to 29.1 fish/gillnet in 1992.  Yellow perch catch rates in surveys prior to 1988 ranged from 42.0 to 63.9 fish/gillnet.  The normal range of mean catch rates for lake class 24 is 1.5 to 27.0 fish/ gillnet.  Mean weight of fish captured in 1992 was 0.2 pounds.  PSD was calculated at 28.7%.  The low catch rate recorded in 1988 may have been the result of sampling error or may have been a response to increased walleye abundance at that time. Black crappie catches averaged 0.1 fish/trapnet.  Catch rates have also been low in previous surveys.  Black crappie are not effectively sampled in trapnets during standard lake surveys because of habitat preferences during mid-summer months.  Lake Geneva seems to be a popular spot for crappie fishing in the spring.  Black Bullhead catches increased from 3.8 fish/ gillnet in 1988 to 15.3 fish/gillnet in 1992.  Yellow bullhead catch rates also experienced a similar increase. Catches increased from 11.4 fish/gillnet in 1988 to 22.5 fish/gillnet in 1992.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Geneva is a 631-acre lake located on the eastern edge of the city of Alexandria and is part of the Alexandria Chain of Lakes.  A navigable connection exists to Lake Le Homme Dieu.  A connection also exists to Lake Victoria, but shallow water can make navigation difficult or impossible for some boats.  There are two public accesses on Lake Geneva.  The access on the east shoreline is steep and is more difficult to use.  The access on the northwest shoreline is more user friendly.  There is also a handicapped accessible public fishing pier located near the public access on the northwest shore.  The fishing pier is located in a shallow bay that is a popular fishing spot for anglers throughout the open water season, but particularly in the spring.  Boaters should be cautious of navigation hazards on the lake. Several shallow bars extend into the lake.  Much of the shoreline on Lake Geneva has been developed.\n  \nA standard fisheries survey was completed during summer 2020 to provide updated information on the fish community of Lake Geneva.  Standard survey components typically include spring electrofishing, gill nets, and trap nets.  However, due to safety concerns during the COVID-19 pandemic, gill nets were the only component used in 2020.\n\nLake Geneva supports a modest Walleye fishery, which is supplemented with combined fingerling stockings by the  MN DNR and private user groups.  Gill net catches declined in 2020 to 1.9 Walleye/net.  Many of the Walleye caught were of quality size.  Average length was 18.6 inches.\n\nLake Geneva supports abundant populations of Bluegill, Largemouth Bass, and Northern Pike.  Due to moderate fertility of the lake and high abundance of these fishes, growth rates are average to below average.  Fortunately, gamefishes in Lake Geneva can live to be quite old, thus it does support some larger fish.  Forty-seven percent of the Bluegill caught during the survey were over 7 inches and fish up to 9 inches were observed.  Largemouth Bass also grow slow but have been shown to live up to at least 19 years old in the Alexandria Chain of Lakes.  The largest bass caught during the survey was 16.7 inches, but many larger bass are available.  Many of the Northern Pike caught in the survey were smaller, but several fish over 30 inches were observed.  Few Black Crappie are caught during summer surveys since larger fish likely suspend off shore.  Low Black Crappie catch rates recorded in surveys does not accurately reflect abundance and size distribution.  Lake Geneva does support good crappie fishing and fish up to 12.8 inches were observed in the most recent survey.  Adult Yellow Perch numbers have declined over the last few surveys.  Yellow Perch are preferred prey of Walleye, Northern Pike, and Largemouth Bass.  \n\nAdditional species sampled include, hybrid sunfish, Pumpkinseed, Rock Bass, Smallmouth Bass, White Sucker, and Brown and Yellow Bullhead.  The next standard fisheries survey is tentatively scheduled for 2024.\n\nQuality fishing opportunities exist for many species in Lake Geneva.  Even modest harvest of older fish can degrade fishing quality.  Anglers are encouraged to practice selective harvest to help maintain and improve the quality of the Lake Geneva fishery.  Selective harvest encourages the release of larger fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish.  Releasing medium to large fish will help restore and maintain fish community balance, as well as increase opportunities to catch large fish in the future.\n\nLake Geneva was designated as an infested water after the discovery of zebra mussels in 2009.  Minnesota statutes require all equipment be free of invasive species prior to leaving any access.  Recreational users should take necessary precautions to prevent the further spread of invasive species.\n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of nearshore fish species in Geneva Lake was conducted on August 8-10, 2022, by DNR Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program staff. Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake, and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at eight sampling stations, but two station was sampled from the boat due to site conditions. Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample six stations, a 15-foot seine was used at six stations, and site conditions prevented the use of seines at two stations. Nearshore sampling captured 23 species of fish including eight species that are intolerant of disturbance (i.e., Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, Mimic Shiner, Pugnose Shiner, Rock Bass, and Smallmouth Bass) and one that is tolerant of disturbance (i.e., Green Sunfish). <br> \n <br> \nA summer trap net survey was also conducted by IBI Program staff on August 8-10, 2022. Nine trap nets were set along the shoreline in locations that encompassed multiple habitat types. Trap net sampling captured 13 species of fish, including two that are tolerant of disturbance (i.e., Common Carp and Green Sunfish). Bluegill comprised a majority of the catch by number, whereas Yellow Bullhead and Bluegill comprised a majority by biomass.  <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore and trap net data were combined with gill net data from a 2020 survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based IBI (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment. In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g., Pugnose Shiner, Banded Killifish, and Blackchin Shiner), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g., Green Sunfish). The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.  <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Long Prairie Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Geneva is a 631-acre basin located on the eastern edge of the city of Alexandria.  It is part of the Alexandria Chain of Lakes and boaters can access other lakes within the chain via navigable channels.  Much of the shoreline has been residentially developed.  Water quality and clarity are considered good.  Seechi disk transparency averages about 10 feet during summer months.  The lake supports an abundant and diverse aquatic plant community.  These aquatic plants help to maintain water quality and clarity by competing with algae for the available nutrients in the lake.  Aquatic plants also provide spawning habitat and cover for many fish species, especially bass and panfish.  Lake Geneva is a popular recreational lake for pleasure boaters and anglers.  The lake supports a stable, well-balanced fish community.  Largemouth bass, bluegill, and black crappie, and northern pike are usually abundant and provide ample fishing opportunities.  A handicapped accessible public fishing pier is located in the northwest corner of the lake near the public access.  This shallow bay is a popular fishing spot for anglers in the spring.Walleye catches were relatively low in 2004, averaging 2.4 fish/net.  In comparison, gill net catches averaged 4.8 fish/net in 2000 and 14.6 fish/net in 1996.  The normal range of mean catch rates from lakes with similar physical and chemical characteristics is 3.3 to 8.8 fish/net.  Most of the fish captured in 2004 ranged from 15 to 25 inches in length.  Walleye fingerlings, yearlings, or adults were stocked in eight of nine years between 1995 and 2003, however the success of these stockings appears to be limited.    </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Geneva is a 631-acre lake located in Douglas County near the city of Alexandria.  This lake currently supports abundant populations of northern pike and largemouth bass and although less abundant, the walleye population maintains fish of larger sizes.  The Minnesota DNR operates two boat accesses, both with concrete ramps.  One is located on the southeastern shore.  The other is located in the northwest corner of the lake and can be accessed off state highway 29 northeast of Alexandria.  A handicapped-accessible fishing pier is also located at the northwest access.  Geneva Lake is a part of the Alexandria chain of lakes system that includes lakes Carlos, Le Homme Dieu, and Victoria.  Thus, access to Lake Geneva can also be gained via channels connecting these lakes.Lake Geneva has a maximum depth of 63 ft, but 42% of the lake is less than 15 ft.  The shoreline is primarily residential development with numerous cabins, lake homes, and cottages.  Dissolved oxygen measurements made in mid-July in 2000 indicated that most areas deeper than 20 ft did not have sufficient oxygen to maintain most gamefishes.  Thus, anglers fishing in midsummer should target the shallower waters.  Water clarity sometimes diminishes during summer months due to plankton-algae blooms.  Beds of aquatic vegetation are not extensive in Lake Geneva, butmost beds are located along the western shoreline.Lake Geneva is managed for northern pike, largemouth bass, walleye, bluegill, and black crappie.  Lake surveys are conducted about every four years to monitor the status of these populations. The most recent surveys were conducted in 1992, 1996, and 2000.  In the 2000 survey, northern pike and largemouth bass were abundant with catches exceeding those of other lakes with similar physical and chemical conditions.  One hundred and thirteen northern pike were captured during the 2000 survey.  They ranged in size from 17 to 32 inches.  Almost one-third of the captured northern pike exceeded 24 inches.  Seventy-seven largemouth bass were collected with nighttime electrofishing.  These bass ranged from 5.5 to almost 20 inches in length.  Anglers targeting bass should consider fishing the 5-10 ft flats along the southeast shoreline.  Walleye abundance has declined somewhat from the 1996 survey.  However, size of captured walleye was excellent.  The average weight of walleye sampled in gill nets was 1.8 lbs. and all walleye collected ranged from 8.5-28 inches long.  Almost one-fourth of the captured walleyes exceeded 20 inches in length and 3 lbs. in weight.  The DNR manages this quality-sized walleye fishery by supplementing natural reproduction with fingerling stockings.  Walleye fingerlings and yearlings were stocked in 1999 and 2000.  Walleye anglers should try fishing the steep drop-offs between 5 and 25 ft.  Black crappie were not as abundant in net catches as other species, but midsummer surveys are ineffective at sampling crappie populations.  Crappie anglers generally have good luck fishing on the pier at the northwest boat access and on a 5 ft flat that extends into the lake near the same boat access.       </p>",

It is part of the Alexandria Chain of Lakes and boaters can access other lakes within the chain via navigable channels. There are two public accesses on the lake.  One is located on the northwest side of the lake and the other on the east side. The access on the east shoreline is steep and it may be difficult for some to use. A handicapped accessible public fishing pier is located on the northwest corner of the lake near the public access. This shallow bay is a popular fishing spot for anglers throughout the open water season, particularly in the spring. Much of the shoreline has been developed. Water quality and clarity are fair. Secchi disk transparency was 5.5 feet during the 2008 survey. Lake Geneva supports an abundant and diverse aquatic plant community. These aquatic plants help to maintain water quality and clarity by competing with algae for available nutrients in the lake. Aquatic plants also provide spawning habitat and cover for many fish species, especially bass and panfish.  <br> \n <br> \nLake Geneva is a popular recreational lake for pleasure boaters and anglers. The lake supports a stable, well- balanced fish community. Largemouth bass, bluegill, black crappie and northern pike are usually abundant and provide ample fishing opportunities. Walleye are also present but abundance is relatively low and below expected levels for this type of lake. Mean weight was 2.0 lbs. Walleye have been stocked in nine of the last ten years with little change in catch rates. As noted earlier, Lake Geneva is part of the Alexandria Chain. Fish move from basin to basin. It is very plausible these fish have migrated into other basins.  <br> \n <br> \nCarp catches increased in 2008. An increase in carp abundance was also noted in other lakes in the Alexandria Chain. A heavy rain in June of 2003 provided ideal spawning conditions for this species and is likely responsible for increased abundance. This year class of carp were 14.0 to 20.0 inches in length at the time of the survey. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Geneva is a 631 acre lake located on the eastern edge of the city of Alexandria. It is part of the Alexandria Chain of Lakes.  Boaters can access other lakes within the chain via navigable channels. There are two public accesses on the shoreline of the lake. One is located on the northwest side of the lake and the other on the east side. The access on the east shoreline is steep and may be difficult for some to use.  A handicapped accessible public fishing pier is located off the northwest shoreline near the public access. This shallow bay is a popular fishing spot for anglers throughout the open water season, particularly in the spring.  Much of the shoreline has been developed.  <br> \n <br> \nA trend of increasing water clarity continues. Secchi disk transparency was 14.8 feet at time of the 2012 survey. Increased transparency may be linked to infestation and rapid expansion of zebra mussels. Although an aquatic vegetation survey was not conducted, lake survey crews noted a dramatic increase in submerged aquatic vegetation.  <br> \n <br> \nLake Geneva supports a stable, well- balanced fish community.  Bluegill and black crappie are abundant.  Northern pike and largemouth bass catches during 2012 survey describe significant declines in abundance of both predator populations.  While not as abundant, northern pike continue to support a quality fishery.  Twenty-three percent of gillnet captures in 2012 exceeded 28.0 inches in length.  The largest pike measured was 33.5 inches.   A sustained reduction in largemouth bass abundance is welcome and should result in faster growth and a larger average size.  Age distribution of largemouth bass caught by electrofishing in 2012 extended out to age 11.  The few old fish in the population sample exceeded 19.0 inches in length.  Average size of bass caught was 11.1 inches.   The first smallmouth bass capture occurred during the 2012 survey.   <br> \n <br> \nSignificant decreases in predator densities and an aggressive walleye fingerling stocking program have resulted in increased walleye abundance.   Gillnet catches averaged 12.4 walleye/gillnet during the 2012 survey.  Average size of walleye has declined from previous assessments due to greater recruitment of young fish into the population.  Average size of the walleye population sample was 12.0 inches.   Growth of walleye is strongly density-dependent.  At current density, it will take an additional year of growth for walleye to 15.0 inches in length. <br> \n <br> \n The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources designated Lake Geneva as infested water after the discovery of zebra mussels in 2009. Minnesota statutes require all equipment be free of invasive species prior to leaving any access.  Consult your current fishing regulations handbook for rules and regulations pertaining to the cleaning of equipment.  <br> \n</p>",
