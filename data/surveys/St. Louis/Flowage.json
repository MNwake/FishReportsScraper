                "narrative": "<p>Fish Lake is a 3,071 acre reservoir with 2,303 acres of littoral area and a maximum depth of 31 feet.  Fish Lake was impounded in 1912 and is managed as a storage reservoir within a system of hydroelectric generation facilities operated by Minnesota Power on the St. Louis and Clouquet Rivers.     Fish populations in Fish Lake have fluctuated greatly since initial investigations back in the 1950's.  Presently, there are very healthy populations of walleyes, northern pike, and yellow perch.  Catch rates for all three species are at or well above their respective third quartile values for lakes in this class and PSD values are fair to good for all three species.  The black crappie population is near the highest level in recent history.  An apparent strong 1998 year class should recruit to the creel by 2002 or 2003.  The bluegill population has also rebounded and has increased steadily since 1993, but the PSD values are not favorable at this time.  Strong 1997 and 1998 year classes should be available to anglers by 2002 or 2003.  Pumpkinseed sunfish are also doing well in Fish Lake at this time.  The catch is dominated by smaller fish (PSD = 15), however, many of these should be available to anglers in a few years.</p>",

Walleye gillnet catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) was 7.1 per lift, with 70% of the 131 measured fish longer than 15 inches.  Yellow perch gillnet CPUE was 12.3 per lift, with 28% longer than eight inches.  Although there are no quartile values for bullheads in lake class 7, they were common in gillnet samples at 31.3 per lift.  White sucker were also common in gillnet samples at 8.3 per lift.  Trapnet CPUE for black crappie was 2.9 per lift, with 93% of the 83 measured fish longer than eight inches.  Bluegill were sampled at a rate of 1.9 per trapnet lift, with 97% of the 39 measured fish longer than six inches.     Age and rate of growth analysis from the 1993 lake survey showed strong 1988 year classes for black crappie, bluegill and yellow perch, consistant recruitment for walleye and fast growth rates for black crappie and bluegill.  Walleye exhibited slightly fast growth rates compared to other Duluth Area lakes, reaching 15.0 inches at age IV.  Black crappie and bluegill were reaching 8.8 and 6.3 inches, respectively, at age IV.</p>",

Until recently, Fish Reservoir's Walleye population had been considered self-sustaining and had not been stocked with Walleye since 1989.  Fish Reservoir was stocked with 3 million Walleye fry in 2013, 2014 and 2015 to supplement natural reproduction and to initiate a study to help determine which factor(s) may be responsible for the decline in Walleye abundance.  In addition, a special harvest regulation (13\"-17\" harvest slot, one over 26\", possession limit 3) was enacted in December of 2012 to protect spawning stock biomass and reduce fishing mortality.  This special assessment was intended to index abundance and mean length of YOY and age-1 Walleye and add to the database that has been collected since 1994.   <br> \n <br> \nA total of 29 YOY Walleye with an average size of 5.9 inches were captured during the 2015 investigation for a catch rate of 28.2 per hour of electrofishing.  Previous catch rates have ranged from 0.0 to 366.6 YOY walleye per hour of electrofishing.  The low abundance of YOY Walleye captured suggests a below average year-class from 2015 is possible.  <br> \n  <br> \nA total of 43 age-1 Walleye with an average size of 9.2 inches were sampled in 2015 for a catch rate of 41.9 per hour of electrofishing.  Previous catch rates for age-1 Walleye have ranged from 0.0 per hour in 2009 to 72.8 in 2003.  The above average catch rate of age-1 Walleye observed in 2015 suggests that an above average year-class from 2014 is likely.   <br> \n <br> \nAnglers should expect improved catch rates of Walleye in 2016, with Walleye from the 2013 year-class entering the harvest slot.  In 2017, anglers should again see improved catch rates with a strong 2014 year-class entering the harvest slot.    <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Fish Lake Flowage is a 3,259-acre reservoir located near Duluth, Minnesota with 71% (2,303 acres) littoral area and a maximum depth of 36 feet. Minnesota Power owns a public access on the north side of the lake located near the end of Fish Lake Dam Road. The Minnesota DNR operates a public access located on the far west section of the lake off County Road #15.  Fish Lake was surveyed during the summer of 2020 to update information about fish populations and evaluate changes after implementation of the special Walleye angling regulation.  The Walleye fishery has been managed with a special angling regulation (13 - 17 inch harvest slot, one over 26 inches, with a possession limit of 3) since 2012. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye reproduce naturally in Fish and the lake had not been stocked since 1986, except fry stocking occurred from 2013 through 2015 as part of a research study designed to evaluate Walleye natural reproduction.  The study confirmed adequate spawning stock and reproductive potential exists to sustain the Walleye population without stocking.   <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance of 7.4 per gillnet lift was up from 2010 (5.7) and was average compared to other similar Minnesota lakes.  Walleye average length was 17.1 inches and growth was slightly below average compared to other Duluth Area lakes.  The proportion of adult Walleye that exceeded quality size (greater than 15 inches) was 67%, while the proportion that exceeded preferred size (greater than 20 inches was 25%.  The 2018 year-class appears strong, while other Walleye captured from the 2017 and 2019 year-classes confirms consistent natural reproduction. <br> \n <br> \nIn addition to Walleye, Fish offers quality angling opportunities for several species of panfish.  Bluegill abundance of 3.4 per trapnet lift was average when compared to other similar Minnesota lakes.  Average length of sampled Bluegill was 5.9 inches.  The proportion of adult Bluegill that exceeded quality size (greater than 6 inches) was 48%, while the proportion that exceeded preferred size (greater than 8 inches) was 17%.  Black Crappie abundance of 2.4 per trapnet lift was below average when compared to other similar Minnesota lakes.  Black Crappie average length was 7.2 inches. The proportion of adult Black Crappie that exceeded preferred size (greater than 10 inches) was 29%, while the proportion that exceeded memorable size (greater than 12 inches) was 4%.  The 2018 year-class is strong, (73% of the overall catch) and should provide good returns to anglers in coming years.  Yellow Perch abundance of 2.9 per gillnet lift was average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Yellow Perch average length was 6.4 inches but only one perch captured exceeded 10 inches in length.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike abundance of 5.3 per gillnet lift was above average compared to other similar Minnesota Lakes.  Northern Pike average length was small at 20 inches but a few preferred size fish (greater than 28 inches) were sampled.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Fish Lake Reservoir Lake is a 3,071 acre lake located near Duluth, Minnesota with 75% (2,303 acres) littoral area and a maximum depth of 36 feet.  Minnesota Power owns and operates a public access on the north end of the lake located at the end of Township Road #285.  The Minnesota DNR also operates a public access located off on the far west section of the lake off County Road #15.  Walleye, which are maintained entirely by natural reproduction, are the primary fish species.  Northern pike, black crappie, and bluegill are also important sport fish that are managed by the MN DNR.       Walleye abundance of 8.8 fish/gillnet was average for Minnesota lakes of this type.  Mean length was 14.3 inches and about 40% of the population was l5 inches or larger with a maximum size of 24.3 inches.  Growth was slow compared to other Duluth Area populations.  Walleye recruitment has been very consistent even after the MN DNR stopped stocking walleye fry in 1989.     Fond du Lac Division of Natural Resources and 1854 Authority tagged 2,572 adult walleye in April of 2005 in order to estimate walleye harvest in Fish Lake Reservoir.  A creel survey was conducted by the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources during the 2005-06 fishing season to gain information on pressure and fish harvest.  Eight tagged walleye were observed in the gillnets during the summer assessment.       Northern pike abundance was average for Minnesota lakes with a value of 3.4 fish/gillnet.  Mean length was 20.6 inches; forty-one percent were over 21 inches and one fish measured 29.6 inches.  Growth was average for Duluth Area populations.  Based on age distribution, northern pike successfully reproduced from 1998 to 2004.       Black crappie abundance was 2.2 fish/trapnet and was average for Minnesota lakes of this type.  The mean length of black crappie was 7.8 inches and 42% of the population was 10 inches or larger.  Growth was fast for Duluth Area populations and recruitment has been consistent.       Bluegill abundance was average for Minnesota lakes with an average of 3.5 fish/trapnet.  Mean length was 5.6 inches with 46% of bluegills 6 inches or greater and a maximum size of 8.5 inches.  Bluegill reproduction was consistent and growth was average for Duluth Area lakes.       Yellow perch abundance of 7.3 fish/gillnet was above average for Minnesota lakes.  Mean length was 6.7 inches and only 12% of fish were 8 inches or larger.  Growth was average compared to other Duluth Area populations.         Largemouth bass electrofishing catch rate of 6.4 per hour was below the average (32.6 per hour) for Duluth Area bass populations.  Mean length of the six fish captured was 10.2 inches and the largest fish was 12.7 inches.  Largemouth bass growth slow compared to other Duluth Area populations.     Fish Lake Reservoir has a reputation for producing excellent walleye, northern pike, and black crappie angling opportunities.  Although walleye abundance has decreased slightly compared to the 1999 survey (12.7 fish/gillnet), catch rates have remained within the normal range for Fish Lake Reservoir (7.0-15.3 fish/gillnet).  Walleye populations naturally fluctuate in response to environmental variables and fishing pressure.</p>",

A special harvest regulation (13\"-17\" harvest slot, one over 26\", possession limit 3) was enacted in December 2012 to protect spawning stock biomass and reduce fishing mortality.  This special assessment was intended to index abundance and mean length of YOY and age-1 Walleye and add to the database that has been collected since 1994.   <br> \n <br> \nA total of 18 YOY Walleye with an average size of 6.8 inches were captured during the 2018 investigation for a catch rate of 20.4 per hour of electrofishing.  Previous catch rates have ranged from 0.0 to 366.6 YOY Walleye per hour of electrofishing.  The low abundance of YOY Walleye captured suggests a below average year-class from 2018 is possible.   <br> \n <br> \nA total of 2 age-1 Walleye with an average size of 7.5 inches were sampled in 2018 for a catch rate of 2.2 per hour of electrofishing.  Previous catch rates for age-1 Walleye have ranged from 0.0 per hour in 2009 to 72.8 in 2003.  The low catch rate of age-1 Walleye observed in 2018 suggests that a below average year-class from 2017 is possible.   <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Fish Lake Reservoir Lake is a 3,071 acre lake located near Duluth, Minnesota with 75% (2,303 acres) littoral area and a maximum depth of 36 feet. Minnesota Power owns and operates a public access on the north side of the lake located at the end of Township Road #285. The Minnesota DNR also operates a public access located off on the far west section of the lake off County Road #15.  Fish was last surveyed in 2005.  Fish was surveyed during the summer of 2010 to update information about fish populations.   <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance of 5.7 per gillnet lift was down from 2005 (8.8) and but was still average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  The walleye abundance for 2010 was the lowest recorded of 11 investigations dating back to 1954.  Walleye average length was 15.2 inches and growth was average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  This represents a shift in growth patterns from what has historically been below average growth.  All year-classes from 1995 through 2009 were represented in the sample, except 1996 and 2000.  The 2005 and 2006 year-classes were strong, contributing to 63% of the overall catch.   <br> \n <br> \nThe last several years of fall young-of-the-year (YOY) walleye electrofishing, combined with the results of this assessment suggest that natural walleye recruitment in Fish Reservoir is currently in decline.  The decline in walleye recruitment is not fully understood but is hypothesized to be a result of increasing bass and bluegill populations. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike abundance of 4.3 per gillnet lift was the same as 2005 and above average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Average length was 19.5 inches and growth was average compared to other Duluth Area lakes.  All year-classes from 2002 to 2008 were represented. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie abundance of 6.9 per trapnet lift was up from 2005 (2.2) and was above average when compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Black crappie mean length was 9.3 inches and growth was average compared to other Duluth Area lakes.  Thirty-three percent of the black crappies captured in trapnets were greater than 10 inches in length.  All year-classes from 2002 to 2009 were represented.   <br> \n <br> \nBluegill abundance of 13.5 per trapnet lift was up from 2005 (3.5) and was above average when compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Average length of sampled bluegills was 6.7 inches and growth was average compared to other Duluth Area lakes.  All year-classes from 2000 to 2008 were represented.   <br> \n <br> \nA total of 64 largemouth bass were sampled with electrofishing equipment.  The catch rate of largemouth bass was 43.0 fish per hour of electrofishing.  The 2005 largemouth bass electrofishing catch rate was 6.4 fish per hour.  Largemouth bass average length was 13.5 inches and growth was fast compared to other Duluth Area lakes.  All year-classes from 2002 through 2008 were represented in the sample, with strong 2004 and 2006 year-classes.   <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch abundance of 11.1 per gillnet lift was down from 2005 (13.0) and was above average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Average length of perch was 6.6 inches.  Age and growth of yellow perch was not evaluated for this investigation. <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species sampled included pumpkinseed, rock bass, white sucker, channel catfish and hybrid sunfish.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Results of investigations conducted from 1954 to 1996 reveal a fishery that is subject to wide fluctuations in abundance of different species within the community.  Black crappie, pumpkinseed sunfish and black bullhead had peaks in sampling index values from the late 1960's to late 1970's and again from the late 1980's to mid 1990's.  Bluegill index netting revealed a peak in abundance only from the late 1980's to mid 1990's.  Walleye abundance indices fluctuated opposite those for black bullhead.  A similar relationship between walleye and black crappie, bluegill and pumpkinseed sunfish was less apparent, but still evident.     Walleye gillnet catch rate, which was at a historically low level of 7.1 per lift in 1993, increased to 11.5 in 1996.  Seventy four percent of the 222 walleye sampled in 1996 were less than IV years old, while the average weight of 0.9 per walleye was the smallest compared to other assessments.  Recruitment of walleye to the creel should increase dramatically in 1997 and 1998.     Panfish (black crappie, bluegill and pumpkinseed sunfish) abundance indices, which were high in 1988 and 1993, declined in 1996.  The strong 1988 black crappie and bluegill year class documented in 1993, was still available to sampling gear in 1996.  Mean length of black crappie and bluegill sampled by trapnets in 1996 was 10.3 and 7.8 inches.</p>",

Minnesota Power owns and operates a public access on the north side of the lake located at the end of Township Road #285. The Minnesota DNR also operates a public access located on the far west section of the lake off County Road #15.  Fish was last assessed in 2010.  A targeted survey was conducted on Fish during the summer of 2015 to update information about panfish and bass populations.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie abundance of 3.9 per trapnet lift was above average when compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Black Crappie average length was 8.9 inches and growth was average compared to other Duluth Area lakes.  Fifty-seven percent of the black crappies captured in trapnets were greater than 9 inches in length offering good angling opportunities.  All year-classes from 2009 to 2012 were represented.   <br> \n <br> \nBluegill abundance of 7.1 per trapnet lift was average when compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Average length of sampled Bluegills was 6.4 inches and growth was average compared to other Duluth Area lakes.  All year-classes from 2007 to 2013 were represented.   <br> \n <br> \nA total of 70 Largemouth Bass were sampled with electrofishing equipment.  The catch rate of Largemouth Bass was 34.7 fish per hour of electrofishing.  Largemouth Bass average length was 14.0 inches and growth was average compared to other Duluth Area lakes.  All year-classes from 2006 through 2014 were represented in the sample, with strong 2010 and 2011 year-classes.  Largemouth Bass were first sampled in Fish Reservoir in 2005.  A quality Largemouth Bass fishery has developed in moderate abundance with some fish exceeding 18 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch abundance of 2.7 per trapnet lift was above average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Average length of Yellow Perch was 6.7 inches and growth was average compared to other Duluth Area lakes.  Two missing year-classes (2008-2009) were evident from 2007 through 2013. <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species sampled included Black Bullhead, Walleye, Northern Pike, Pumpkinseed, Rock Bass and White Sucker.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>The purpose of this targeted gillnetting survey was to gather information to evaluate Walleye population dynamics in Fish Lake Reservoir.  In 2010, historic low Walleye gillnet catch rates were documented and annual fall young-of-the-year (YOY) and age-1 electrofishing rates have declined substantially since the mid-2000's.  Fish Lake Reservoir's Walleye population was considered self-sustaining before 2013, and had not been stocked with Walleye since 1989.  In June 2013, a research project was initiated that included stocking 3 million oxytetracycline (OTC) marked Walleye fry for three consecutive years.  The project includes several coordinated management actions including annual OTC fry stocking, annual fall gillnetting and annual fall YOY electrofishing assessments.  The objectives of this study were to determine if Walleye recruitment is failing due to pre or post-hatch mortality, estimate Walleye spawning stock biomass (SSB) and wild fry reproductive potential.  A special harvest regulation (13\"-17\" harvest slot, one over 26\", possession limit 3) was enacted in December of 2012 to protect spawning stock biomass and reduce fishing mortality.   <br> \n <br> \nA total of 222 Walleye were captured for an abundance of 14.8 per gillnet lift.  This sample included 143 sexually mature fish that ranged from 13.6 to 25.5 inches.  The population estimate of adult Walleye (fall 2015) was 9,943 fish which was similar to estimates obtained in 2013 and 2014.  Other Fish Reservoir population estimates estimated 46,199 Walleye in 1999, and 31,995 Walleye in 2005.   However, these population estimates used different methodologies and included immature fish as small as 10 inches so comparisons should be interpreted with caution. <br> \n <br> \nThe population estimate of mature female Walleye (fall 2015) was 3,835 fish.  The estimate of Walleye SSB was 12,229 lbs (3.75 lbs/acre).  When compared to other naturally reproducing Minnesota Walleye lakes, the SSB estimate of 3.75 lbs/acre suggests that there is currently ample spawning stock for a self-sustaining population.  This SSB density is higher than the 2 to 3 lbs/acre identified as optimal for the Red Lakes and above the population objectives for Leech Lake.  Fish Reservoir SSB is predicted to produce 407,140,097 eggs in 2016.  The hatch rate of 0.4% for Walleye eggs deposited in spring 2015 was within the range observed in other Minnesota lakes with walleye populations considered healthy.  Wild fry production for 2016 is estimated at 1,623,408 (550 fry per littoral acre).   <br> \n <br> \nWalleye average length was 16.7 inches and growth was average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  All year-classes from 1999 through 2014 were represented.  The 2013 (stocked) year-class was the strongest, comprising 27% of the overall catch.  The 2014 (stocked) year-class comprised 9% of the overall catch and may produce an above average year-class since this year-class had not fully recruited to the gear at the time of sampling.  The 2009 year-class was also relatively strong, comprising 18% of the overall catch (down from 31% in 2014).   <br> \n <br> \nAnglers should expect improved catch rates of Walleye in 2016, with fish from the strong 2013 year-class entering the harvest slot.  In 2017, anglers should again see improved catch rates with the 2014 year-class entering the harvest slot.  Ample spawning stock of Walleye will result in excellent catch and release angling for large Walleye, particularly from the 2009 year-class.</p>",
