                "narrative": "<p>Silver Lake is a small (114 acre), natural, prairie lake located three miles south of Hawley, MN.  It's the only lake in Clay County with no history of winterkill.  Since the lake is located on the far western edge of the lakes' area and is within 25 miles of the Fargo-Moorhead metropolitan area, it is subject to heavy recreational uses including water skiing, fishing, swimming, and jet skiing.  The lake's small size and lack of vegetative cover make it vulnerable to over-harvest of fish.Fish populations have improved greatly since Silver Lake was chemically reclaimed in 1985.  Prior to the treatment, the lake had become infested with undesirable fish like black bullhead and carp.  Walleye, bluegill, black crappie, largemouth bass, yellow perch, channel catfish, and spottail shiner were all reintroduced following treatment.  During the twenty years since then, northern pike, white sucker, and black bullhead have also found their way back into the lake.In 2004, northern pike catch rates were higher than the lake's historical average at 4.5 pike per gill net.  The mean size of these pike was a relatively large 23.7 inches and 3.6 pounds.  Northern pike grow rapidly in Silver Lake during their younger life stages.  Although the potential to grow extremely large pike is better in lakes with deep, cool, well-oxygenated waters with populations of tullibee (cisco), Silver Lake may produce pike over 30 inches regularly if they are not harvested first.  Anglers are encouraged to voluntarily release pike longer than 24 inches in length and to keep smaller ones for eating.Bluegills also have the potential to grow fairly large in Silver Lake.  Although they are not abundant, a few bluegills over nine inches were found.  Most of the bluegills sampled by experimental trap nets were young, small, and attributed to one strong year class (2002).  Natural reproduction of bluegills and other panfish is hindered in Silver Lake by the lack of aquatic vegetation which is used for spawning cover, as well as feeding and rearing areas.  Consequently, natural reproduction tends to be very sporadic.Walleyes, black crappie, largemouth bass, and channel catfish were all found at near average catch rates compared to the lake's historical data and to other similar lakes.  The walleye stocking rate was tripled in 1999 to take advantage of an abundant (at the time) yellow perch population and provide more fishing opportunity for this species.  Little natural reproduction of walleye exists in this lake.  Walleyes found in 2004 averaged about a pound and a half each and there was a relatively strong 2001 year class.It is hoped that gamefish populations will continue to help suppress populations of fish like black bullhead and white sucker.  Chemical treatment is an extremely expensive last resort.  Anglers are urged to make sure not to accidentally introduce unwanted fish or other invasive species into the lake by dumping minnow buckets or draining bilges or livewells after fishing other lakes.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Silver Lake is a small (114-acre), natural, prairie lake located three miles south of Hawley, MN.  It's the only lake in Clay County with no history of winterkill.  Since the lake is located on the far western edge of the lakes' area and is within 25 miles of the Fargo-Moorhead metropolitan area, it is subject to heavy recreational uses including water skiing, fishing, swimming, and jet skiing.  The lake's small size and lack of vegetative cover make it vulnerable to over-harvest of fish. <br> \n <br> \nFish populations have improved greatly since Silver Lake was chemically reclaimed in 1985.  Prior to the treatment, the lake had become infested with undesirable fish like black bullhead and carp.  Walleye, bluegill, black crappie, largemouth bass, yellow perch, channel catfish, and spottail shiner were all reintroduced following treatment.  During the twenty years since then, northern pike, white sucker, and black bullhead have also found their way back into the lake. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye and channel catfish fisheries are sustained by regular stocking.  Bluegill, black crappie, largemouth bass, and yellow perch reproduce naturally in Silver Lake.  Populations of these species would probably do better with the presence of emergent plant cover like bulrush, but they are maintaining modest populations. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike grow rapidly in Silver Lake during their younger life stages.  Although the potential to grow extremely large pike is better in lakes with deep, cool, well-oxygenated waters with populations of tullibee (cisco), Silver Lake produces pike over 30 inches regularly if they are not harvested first.  Anglers are encouraged to voluntarily release pike longer than 24 inches in length and to keep smaller ones for eating. <br> \n <br> \nIt is hoped that gamefish populations will continue to help suppress populations of fish like black bullhead and white sucker.  Chemical treatment is an extremely expensive last resort.  Anglers are urged to make sure not to accidentally introduce unwanted fish or other invasive species into the lake by dumping minnow buckets or draining bilges or livewells after fishing other lakes.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Silver Lake is a small (109-acre), natural, prairie lake located three miles south of Hawley, MN.  It's the only lake in Clay County with no history of winterkill.  Since the lake is located on the far western edge of the lakes' area and is within 25 miles of the Fargo-Moorhead metropolitan area, it is subject to heavy recreational uses including water skiing, fishing, swimming, and jet skiing.  The lake's small size and lack of vegetative cover make it vulnerable to over-harvest of fish. <br> \n <br> \nFish populations have improved greatly since Silver Lake was chemically reclaimed in 1985.  Prior to the treatment, the lake had become infested with undesirable fish like Black Bullhead and Common Carp.  Walleye, Bluegill, Black Crappie, Largemouth Bass, Yellow Perch, Channel Catfish, and Spottail Shiner were all reintroduced following treatment.  During the twenty years since then, Northern Pike, White Sucker, and Black Bullhead have also found their way back into the lake. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye and Channel Catfish fisheries were sustained by regular stocking, although catfish stocking has been suspended due to invasive species concerns in the source water (Red River).  Bluegill, Black Crappie, Largemouth Bass, and Yellow Perch reproduce naturally in Silver Lake.  Populations of these species would probably do better with the presence of emergent plant cover like bulrush, but they are maintaining modest populations.  Bluegills, in particular, seem to be holding their own with regular natural reproduction and the presence of fish over eight inches in length. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike grow rapidly in Silver Lake during their younger life stages.  Although the potential to grow extremely large pike is better in lakes with deep, cool, well-oxygenated waters and populations of Tullibee (Cisco), Silver Lake can produce pike over 30 inches regularly if they are not harvested first.  Anglers are encouraged to voluntarily release pike longer than 24 inches in length and to keep smaller ones for eating. <br> \n <br> \nIt is hoped that gamefish populations will continue to help suppress populations of fish like Black Bullhead and White Sucker.  Chemical treatment is an extremely expensive last resort.  Anglers are urged to make sure not to accidentally introduce unwanted fish or other invasive species into the lake by dumping minnow buckets or draining bilges or livewells after fishing other lakes.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of nearshore fish species in Silver Lake was conducted on July 31, 2017 by Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program Staff.  Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible.  Backpack electrofishing was completed at ten sampling stations, but one station was sampled from the boat due to site conditions.  Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample five stations, a 15-foot seine was used at four stations, and site conditions prevented the use of seines at one station.  Nearshore sampling captured seven species of fish including one species that is intolerant of disturbance (Banded Killifish). <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore data were combined with trap net and gill net data from a June 2014 survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based IBI (FIBI) score.  The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment.  In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g. Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, and Rock Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g. Black Bullhead, Common Carp, and Green Sunfish).  The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake.  For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.   <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Buffalo River Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Silver Lake has traditionally been managed as a bass/panfish lake.  However, largemouth bass, bluegill, and black crappie have historically not done well in the lake.  Even though the lake has not been vulnerable to winterkill, its fish community has tended to be dominated by undesirable rough fish species like carp, black bullhead, and bigmouth buffalo.  Periodic floods allowed migrations of those species from the Buffalo River into the lake.  Spawning habitat was also not favorable for northern pike or walleye and moderate populations were maintained only through stocking.     It was believed that naturally reproducing populations of popular gamefish and panfish species could be established if the over abundant rough fish were eliminated.  Consequently, in late 1985, Silver Lake was successfully treated with a fish toxin.  Two weeks of follow-up test netting in spring 1986 yielded no fish and the fish kill was believed to be complete.  Additionally, a small sheet piling dam and fish screen were constructed on the outlet to prevent immigration of fish from the Buffalo River in all but the most severe floods.  Bluegill, black crappie, largemouth bass, spottail shiner, and yellow perch broodstock along with walleye and channel catfish fingerlings were subsequently restocked in the lake.     Three years following the chemical treatment, things looked promising for bluegill and walleye and hopeful for black crappie and largemouth bass populations.  Test net catches of bluegill and walleye were at all-time highs and three consecutive naturally-reproduced year classes of bluegill were present.  Additionally, while bass and crappie numbers were not high, there were some caught in test nets that had been spawned and hatched in the lake.     Eight years after reclamation, the structure of the fish community has begun to revert to what it was before the treatment.  Yellow perch numbers have once again increased dramatically.  Walleye have decreased to \"normal\" numbers for similar lakes.  Bluegill have decreased to pre-treatment levels, lower than \"normal\" for lakes in the same ecological class.  Black crappie and largemouth bass are not even present in the most recent sample.  Black bullhead and white sucker have been reintroduced, probably through \"bait bucket\" transfer.     Speculation leads one to believe that there are at least three reasons for the recent lack of success of bluegill and black crappie in Silver Lake.  First, vegetative cover is nearly nonexistent.  Although the lake bottom is lined with filamentous algae and chara (muskgrass), there are few plants like bulrushes and pondweeds that are more beneficial to fish.  Those plants provide cover for spawning, for hiding young fish, and for feeding on various insects, crustaceans, etc.  Second, yellow perch numbers have greatly increased.  Perch act as a control on bluegill populations in many lakes.  Third, due to the nature of the lake, with its small size and lack of cover, fish populations may be susceptible to overharvest.     On the bright side, four channel catfish weighing an average of 3.7 pounds were caught in test nets in 1994.  Black bullhead have not become overabundant as they were ten years ago.  High numbers of perch mean plenty of walleye forage and good growth rates.  And of course, undesirable carp and bigmouth buffalo have not found their way back into Silver Lake.</p>",

The maximum depth is 39 feet, and there is a public access on the east side of the lake.  A Standard Survey was conducted in June 2019 using six gill nets and 9 trap nets to assess the status of the fish population within Silver Lake.  The fish community in Silver Lake is dominated by Bluegills and Northern Pike, with Largemouth Bass, Black Crappie, Walleye, and Channel Catfish among the other species present.   <br> \n <br> \nThe Northern Pike population is relatively low, with 4 fish per gill net.  Mean length of pike sampled during the 2019 assessment was 22.9. Inches.  Northern Pike up to 28.9 inches were sampled, and 29% of the pike sampled were longer than 24 inches.  Spawning habitat for Northern Pike is abundant in the Aquatic Management Area adjacent to Silver Lake when water levels are high.   <br> \n <br> \nWalleyes are stocked in Silver Lake, although the population is relatively low.  A total of 17 Walleyes were caught during the 2019 assessment, ranging in size from 19.7 to 26.1 inches.  Three Channel Catfish were sampled in 2019.  Catfish were last stocked in 2007, but a small remnant population exists.  Mean length of Catfish sampled was 35.3 inches.  Bluegills are abundant, and the average size of Bluegills sampled was 5.4 inches.  Bluegills up to 9.6 inches were sampled.   <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass and crappies are both popular targets for local anglers.  Bass up to 17.6 inches were sampled, and the mean length of Crappies was 8.0 inches.  Other species sampled include White Sucker, Yellow Perch, and Golden Shiner.  <br> \n <br> \nThe data from this survey will be combined with other assessments, including a shoreline habitat evaluation and a near-shore fish community assessment, to evaluate the overall health of the watershed.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Silver Lake is a 114 acre prairie lake located approximately 3 miles south of Hawley, MN.  Silver lake is the only lake in Clay County without a history of winterkill.  The lake's close proximity to the Fargo-Moorhead area make it a popular destination for fishing, water skiing, swimming, and jet skiing.Fish populations have been extremely variable, but Silver Lake historically contained large numbers of undesirable rough fish such as carp, bigmouth buffalo, and black bullhead.  In 1985, the lake was successfully reclaimed with a fish toxin, and a fish barrier was installed on the outlet channel to prevent immigration of rough fish from the Buffalo River.  It was anticipated that desirable populations of gamefish could be established with the elimination of the overabundant rough fish.  In 1986, Silver Lake was restocked with black crappie, bluegill, largemouth bass, spottail shiner, yellow perch, channel catfish and walleye.  A 1989 assessment showed that walleye and bluegill were abundant, and largemouth bass and black crappie were present and successfully reproducing.  By 1994, however, the structure of the fish community appeared to be declining.  Walleye and bluegill numbers had fallen dramatically, and black crappies and largemouth bass were not even sampled.  In addition, white suckers and black bullheads had been reintroduced from an unknown source, and yellow perch numbers had reached all-time highs.The current survey showed that walleye gillnet catch rate has declined slightly since 1994, although the average size has increased to 21 inches and 3.2 pounds.  After the reclamation, walleye fingerlings were stocked biennially at a normal rate for this lake class.  Local anglers have reported good fishing for the stocked year classes of walleyes in the past.  However, the small size of this lake and its proximity to a metropolitan area may make it vulnerable to overharvest.  Meanwhile, the yellow perch population has continued to expand to unprecedented levels.  The reason for the increase in perch numbers is debatable, but it is likely related to the decline in walleye abundance.  Recently, the walleye stocking rate for Silver Lake has been tripled to increase their abundance and in turn, help reduce the numbers of small yellow perch.Channel catfish were the most abundant large gamefish in the test nets.  Sampled catfish ranged in size from 16 to 28 inches and had an average weight of nearly 4 pounds.  The catfish population is the result of several stockings that have occurred since the reclamation.  A few northern pike were sampled in the latest survey, although they were not stocked following reclamation.  These fish ranged in length from 20 to 27 inches and were probably introduced by anglers in the past few years.The bass and panfish populations have not done well in Silver Lake.  Natural reproduction continues to be poor for largemouth bass and black crappies, although they are still present in limited numbers.  Bluegill numbers were up slightly in the 1999 survey, and reproduction appeared to be somewhat better for this species.  The lack of rooted aquatic vegetation in Silver Lake is probably limiting the reproductive success of bass and panfish.  Although filamentous algae and muskgrass (Chara) cover much of the lake bottom, there are few beneficial aquatic plants such as bulrushes and pondweeds.  Silver Lake is a good candidate for aquatic plant restoration efforts.  Establishing a more diverse aquatic plant community would provide spawning, feeding, and nursery areas for bluegill, black crappie and largemouth bass.</p>",
