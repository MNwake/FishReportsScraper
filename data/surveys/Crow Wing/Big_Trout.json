                "narrative": "<p>Big Trout is a 1,400 acre lake located at Manhatten Beach.  It is part of the Whitefish chain of lakes.  Maximum depth is 128 feet and about 27% of the surface area is less than 15 feet deep.  It has moderately hard water and low phosphorus fertility.  Water clarity is high compared to other area lakes.  It is one of two lakes in the Brainerd management area managed for lake trout.  Lake trout have been stocked regularly since 1979.Sport fish sampled in the 1995 lake survey included lake trout, northern pike, walleye, smallmouth bass, largemouth bass, bluegills, pumpkinseeds, rock bass and black crappies.Lake trout sampled in 1995 ranged from 1-9 years old and had good growth rates.  Trout ranged from 7.5-34.7 inches and averaged about 14.5 inches and 1.8 lbs..  A majority of the trout sampled were stocked as yearlings or adults in the spring of 1995, based on the presence of fin clips on many of the sampled fish.The catch of northern pike was average compared to similar type lakes and was similar to 1990 netting results.  Average length was 23.7 inches and weight averaged 3.2 lbs..  Growth was good or fast for all age classes.  The walleye catch remained \"low\" and was similar to 1990 results.  The average walleye sampled in 1995 was 21.9 inches long and wieghed 4.1 lbs..  Seven age classes were present in the sample of eight walleyes caught in 1995.Smallmouth bass were sampled in \"average\" numbers in 1995.  They ranged from 12.8-19.3 inches long and averaged 2.8 lbs..  Largemouth bass were caught in \"high\" numbers compared to similar type lakes but this was also similar to the 1990 catch.  Most largemouth were younger fish; nearly one-half were from the 1994 year class.  Largemouth bass sampled in 1995 were generally slow growing.As in 1990, bluegill numbers were high and average size was rather small (4.9\").  Few fish over 7.0 inches long were sampled.  Bluegill growth was slow for all ages sampled.  Pumpkinseeds and rock bass were also caught in high numbers in 1995.  Black crappies were caught in \"average\" numbers.  Crappie size was small (5.0\" average) and growth rate was slow.Forage fish showed variable abundances in 1995.  Yellow perch were caught in low numbers.  Perch catch has been slowly declining since 1950.  Tullibee numbers were in the \"high\" category in 1995 and have been slowly increasing since 1950.  Lake whitefish catches in 1990 and '95 were also high compared to earlier nettings and to similar type lakes.In general, results of the '95 netting were similar to the 1990 catches.  Top predators like northern pike and walleyes have rather low numbers but good growth and high average size.  Smallmouth bass numbers are average and largemouth bass numbers are high.  Numbers of panfish tend to be high and their average size is small and growth is slow.  There is a diverse forage base and when this is combined with high water clarity and good fish habitat, fishing can often be difficult.Lake trout provide a unique angling opportunity for central Minnesota anglers.  Most angling for lake trout is done during the winter season.  A creel survey done in January-March of 1995 provided a closer look at this fishery.  About 2,750 lake trout were caught during this two month season.  Of those, about 1,240 fish were harvested and the rest were released.  Average size of harvested trout was 13 inches and 0.9 lbs., while released trout averaged 9 inches and 0.2 lbs..  An estimated 1,698 angler trips were made during the season, averaging about 3.7 hours each.  Roughly 14% of angling parties lived within 10 miles of the lake and 2% were from outside of Minnesota.  Trout angling produced an estimated economic value of 77,700 dollars at Big Trout Lake during the 1995 winter trout season.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Big Trout Lake is very unique in that it is the only lake in Crow Wing County that is currently stocked with lake trout.  The deep nets set specifically for lake trout actually caught less (0.3/gill net) than the standard survey nets (0.5/gill net).  This is probably due to the fact that oxygenated water cold enough for lake trout (43-59F and greater than or equal to 5 ppm dissolved oxygen) was as shallow as 25 feet.  Fish ranged in size from 8.1\" to 27.5\", with 78% measuring 23\" or larger. Tullibee (cisco) and lake whitefish are two other cold water species caught in both standard nets and deep nets.   While both were caught in high numbers in our standard nets (5.2/gill net for tullibee and 2.1/gill net for whitefish), the size was small.  Average size for tullibee was 7.6\" and for whitefish was 12.2\".   The catch was similar in the deep nets for whitefish (2.4/gill net), but much higher for tullibee (20.7/gill net).   <br> \n <br> \nWalleyes are not stocked directly into Big Trout, but are stocked into connecting Whitefish Lake annually as fry, and every other year as fingerlings.  The 2018 walleye catch was low for this type of lake (1.8/gill net).  Average length was 16.4\" and 71% of the fish were 12\" or larger. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike numbers were average (7.0/gill net).  Average length was 21.7\" and 17% of the fish were 24\" or larger.  Lakes in this part of the state have a new northern pike regulation enacted in 2018: possession limit of 10 with not more than 2 over 26\".  All from 22\"-26\" must be immediately released.  Please refer to the current Minnesota Fishing Regulations for additional information. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass numbers for the Whitefish Chain, which includes Big Trout, were 68.8/hr run-time during night electrofishing.  Average length was 13.5\".  Five smallmouth bass were also netted while electrofishing.  All but one were over 17\". <br> \n <br> \nPanfish numbers were average for both black crappies (0.5/trap net, 0.7/gill net) and bluegills (16.8/net), but size was drastically different.  The average size of bluegills was only 4.3\" and 2% of the fish were 7\" or larger.  While only 14 crappies were netted in total, all but 2 were 10\" or larger. <br> \n</p>",

Big Trout is located in the Pine River watershed.  A nearshore survey was conducted to assess the populations of both game and non-game fish species.  Eighteen 100' long sampling stations were evenly spaced around the lakeshore.  Each station was then sampled by backpack electrofishing, and if conditions allowed with a 15' or 50' 1/8th inch seine. <br> \n <br> \nThe survey took place from August 20-24, 2018, with all 18 stations sampled by backpack electrofishing.  The 50' 1/8th inch seine was used at 11 stations and the 15' 1/8th inch seine was used at an additional 5 stations.  Soft bottom and heavy vegetation prevented the use of seines at the other two sampling sites.  Twenty four species were sampled, including 10 species that are intolerant of habitat disturbance:  Iowa darter, least darter, mottled sculpin, logperch, mimic shiner, blackchin shiner, blacknose shiner, rock bass, smallmouth bass, and banded killifish.  This nearshore survey will be used along with the gill net and trap net survey conducted on July 23-26, 2018 to calculate a Fish-Based Index of Biotic Integrity (FIBI) score.  The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health by the types of fish species present and comparing it to what is expected for this type of lake. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Big Trout Lake is a 1,400 acre lake located at the town of Manhattan Beach, Minnesota.  It is part of the Whitefish chain of lakes.  Maximum water depth is 128 feet and about 27% of the surface area is 15 feet deep or less.  It has good water clarity compared to other area lakes.  It is one of two lakes in the Brainerd management area managed for lake trout.  Lake trout have been stocked regularly since 1979.Sport fish sampled in the 2000 netting included lake trout, northern pike, walleye, smallmouth bass, largemouth bass, bluegills, pumpkinseeds, rock bass and black crappies.Lake trout sampled in 2000 ranged from 4-8 years old and had good growth rates.  Trout ranged from 9.3-31.7 inches and averaged about 14.5 inches.  A majority of the trout sampled were stocked as yearlings or adults in the spring of 1997.  Fish from more recent stockings were not sampled however.The catch of northern pike was average to similar type lakes.  Average length was 23.9 inches and mean weight was 3.3 pounds.  Growth was good for all age classes.  The walleye catch remained low and was similar to the 1995 results.  The average walleye sampled in 2000 was 19 inches long and weighed 2.4 pounds.  Four age classes were present in the sample of 9 walleye caught in 2000.Smallmouth bass were sampled in low numbers in 2000.  Only one fish was sampled in 2000 and it was 16 inches long and weighed 2.5 pounds.  Also, two young-of-the-year smallmouth bass were sampled via shoreline seining.  Largemouth bass were caught in high numbers compared to similar lake types but this was also similar to recent nettings.  Growth was good.  Ninety-one percent of the catch came from the 1996, 1997 and 1998 year classes.As in 1995 and 1990, bluegills were high in number and the average size was rather small at 4.8 inches.  Few fish over 7 inches were sampled.  Bluegill growth was slow overall.  Rock bass were caught in high numbers and black crappie were caught in average numbers.  Crappie average size was 8.5 inches and growth was good.Forage fish showed variable abundances in 2000.  Yellow perch were caught in low numbers.  The perch catch has been slowly declining since 1950.  Tullibee numbers were in the average category in 2000 and have been slowly increasing since 1950.  Lake whitefish catches in 2000, 1995 and 1990 were also high compared to earlier nettings and to similar lake types.In general, results of the 2000 netting were similar to the 1995 catches.  Top predators like northern pike and walleyes have rather low numbers but good growth and large average size.  Smallmouth bass numbers are low and largemouth bass numbers are high.  Numbers of panfish tend to be high and their average size is small.  There is a diverse prey base and when this is combined with high water clarity and good fish habitat, fishing can often be difficult.Lake trout provide a unique angling opportunity for central Minnesota anglers.  Most angling for lake trout is done during the winter season.  A creel survey done in the winter of 1995 provided a closer look at the fishery.  About 2,750 lake trout were caught during this two month long season of which 1,240 fish were harvested and the remaineder were released.  Average size of the harvest trout was 13 inches and 0.9 pounds, while released trout averaged 9 inches and 0.2 pounds.  An estimated 1,698 angler trips were made during the season, averaging 3.7 hours each. </p>",

Maximum water depth is 128 feet and about 27% of the surface area is 15 feet deep of less.  Water clarity was 17.0 feet in mid-July, 2005.  It is one of two lakes in the Brainerd management area managed for lake trout.  Lake trout have been stocked regularly since 1979.In 2005, catch rates of lake whitefish, largemouth bass, bluegill, green sunfish and pumpkinseed were high compared to similar type lakes.  Catches of walleye, yellow perch, brown bullhead and yellow bullhead were in the low category compared to similar type lakes.In general, results in 2005 are similar to 2000.  Top predators like northern pike and walleyes have low to moderate numbers and good growth and average size.  Largemouth bass numbers were high.  Numbers of panfish tend to be high and their average size is small.  Crappies have average abundance and good average size, at present.  There is a diverse prey base and when this is combined with high water clarity and good fish habitat, fishing can often be difficult.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Big Trout Lake is the only lake in the Brainerd management area that is stocked with lake trout.  Big Trout covers 1,342 Acres, and is 128 feet deep.  The littoral area, less than 15 ft deep, covers 27% of the lake.  Water clarity is good with a secchi depth of 18 ft.  A public boat access is located on the eastern shore, or boaters can access through a channel from Whitefish Lake.  The lake is heavily developed with 237 homes, 2 resorts, and 2 youth camps along its 8.5 miles of shoreline.  A 2010 survey of the plant community found 41 native species, and one invasive plant (curlyleaf pondweed).  Protection of aquatic vegetation, especially emergent vegetation, is important for maintaining good water quality.  Also vegetation is critical for fish spawning areas as well as providing cover for fish. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike were captured at the highest rate to date at 7.2/gillnet.  Average length was 20.6 inches and weighing 2.1 lbs.  Northern pike up to 34.4 inches were captured.  Northern pike over 24 inches made up 19% of catch. <br> \n <br> \nWalleyes are not stocked directly into Big Trout, but are stocked into connecting Whitefish Lake annually as fry, and every other year as fingerlings.  The walleye gillnet catch of 0.7/net was low, but the average size was nice at 22.1 inches and weight at 4.2 lbs.  Walleye up to 28.4 inches were caught.   <br> \n <br> \nBoth largemouth and smallmouth bass are present in Big Trout.  Largemouth bass were sampled throughout the Whitefish Chain, including Big Trout, by a spring electrofishing survey.  They were caught at a rate of 112.5/hr.  More data can be found in the Whitefish lake report. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill numbers were above average, but their size leaves something to be desired.  Average length was 4.9 inches, and only 5% were over 7 inches.  The black crappie gillnet catch was average.  All black crappies from gillnets were over 9 inches.  All crappies captured in trapnets were from the 2010 year class and were less than 4 inches in length. <br> \n <br> \nTullibee (Cisco) numbers at 12.5/gillnet were well above average.  Nearly all (98%) of tullibee (cisco) were between 6 and 8 inches in length.  At this size they are a valuable forage species for walleye, northern pike, and lake trout.  Lake whitefish were also caught at above average numbers at a rate of 1.9/ gillnet.  They averaged 1.7 lbs, and would be of interest to anglers.   <br> \n <br> \nNo lake trout were sampled in this survey, though they are present in the lake and are stocked into Big trout every other year.  Other fish species present in this survey included smallmouth bass, rock bass, pumpkinseed sunfish, hybrid sunfish, brown bullhead, yellow bullhead, bowfin, greater redhorse, and green sunfish. <br> \n</p>",

The dissolved oxygen and temperature profiles were measured on August 15, 2013 to monitor habitat for lake trout and other coldwater fishes.  Optimal conditions for lake trout (6 to 13 C, greater than or equal to 5 ppm DO) occurred in about 30 vertical ft from about 29 ft down to 59 ft.  Additional oxygenated water cooler than optimal for lake trout was found to a depth of 85 ft.  The TDO3 value was 4.5 C and was the lowest TDO3 value ever recorded for Big Trout Lake.  A metalimnetic increase in oxygen was found in 2013.  In the two years with the least amount of optimal habitat for lake trout (2008 and 2009) there was no metalimnetic increase in oxygen.  Any further reductions in hypolimnetic oxygen below that observed in August 2008 and 2009 would make summertime survival of lake trout unlikely.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Big Trout Lake is the only lake in the Brainerd Fisheries Area that is currently being stocked with lake trout.  The dissolved oxygen and temperature profiles were measured on September 8, 2016 to monitor habitat for lake trout and other coldwater fishes.  Optimal conditions for lake trout (6 to 13 C, greater than or equal to 5 ppm DO) occurred in about 13 vertical ft in a discontinuous pattern from a depth 35 ft to 41 ft, at 65 ft, and from 69 ft down to 73 ft.  Much of the hypolimnion had DO concentrations around 4.7 to 4.9 ppm.  The TDO3 value was assumed to be approximately 6.3 C (DO less than 3 ppm was not measured, 3.1 ppm at 6.4 C was the minimum measured).  Further reductions in hypolimnetic oxygen below that observed in September 2016 (as well as August 2008 and 2009) would make summertime survival of lake trout unlikely.   <br> \n <br> \nBig Trout Lake is normally stocked with about 20,000 lake trout fingerlings in odd-numbered years.   <br> \n</p>",
