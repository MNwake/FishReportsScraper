                "narrative": "<p>Additional Notes: one Great Blue Heron was sighted.Present Fish Status:  Leavitt Lake is located one mile east of Outing in southeastern Cass county.  Leavitt Lake is 177 acres, has 2.9 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 60 feet.  Intensive shoreline development is scattered around the entire lake.  Shoal water soils are : 50% marl, 30% clay and 20% sand.  Secchi reading was 10 feet.  Total alkalinity was 92.0 ppm.  Several emergent, floating-leaved and submerged aquatic plants were found; the plants had density ratings ranging from sparse to lush with 55 percent of the plants having a sparse density rating.Test netting indicated a poor fish population.  Northern cisco and yellow bullheads were the only fish species caught in moderate numbers.  No northern pike were caught in the test nets.  Spawning habitat is poor for northern pike, walleye and centrachids.  Yellow grub (Clinostomum marginatum) was the only parasite found and was found only on yellow perch.Leavitt Lake probably will never be a good fish lake because of the limited littoral area and poor spawning habitat for northern pike, walleyes, and centrarchids.  The small littoral area limits the production of food for the various fish species.  These lakes which are deep and have a limited littoral area are usually sterile, and most of the recreation on the lake is in the form of boating, water skiing or swimming.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of nearshore fish species in Leavitt Lake was conducted on July 5-6, 2023, by Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program staff. Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake, and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot seine. Nearshore sampling captured fourteen species of fish including four species that are intolerant of disturbance (i.e., Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Rock Bass, and Northern Sunfish) and zero that are tolerant of disturbance. <br> \n <br> \nA concurrent summer trap net survey was also conducted by IBI Program staff. Nine trap nets were set along the shoreline in locations that encompassed multiple habitat types. Trap net sampling captured eight species of fish, including one that is intolerant of disturbance (i.e., Rock Bass) and one that is tolerant of disturbance (i.e., Green Sunfish). Bowfin and Bluegill comprised a majority of the catch by biomass, but overall catches were very light. <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore and trap net data were combined with gill net data from the week of June 13, 2022 to describe the fish community and provide a fish-based IBI (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment. In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g., Blackchin Shiner, Least Darter, and Rock Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g., Black Bullhead and Green Sunfish). The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.  <br> \n <br> \nIBI Program staff also conducted an assessment of lakeshore habitat on September 26, 2023, following the Score the Shore survey protocols. The assessment consisted of 30 survey sites evenly spaced 200 meters around the lake. Assessments were made in three habitat zones: Shoreline Zone (the shore-water interface to the top of the natural bank), Shoreland Zone (land-ward from shoreline to development structure or 100 feet), and Aquatic Zone (lake-ward 50 feet of shoreline). The average lakewide habitat score was 70.8 (+/- 4.0) out of 100 possible. A score of 70.8 indicates the lakewide shoreline condition is moderate overall. Approximately 73 percent of the sites were developed, with a mean score of 63.9 (+/- 4.6) indicating shoreline habitat quality of developed sites is poor, while undeveloped sites had a mean score of 90.0 (+/- 2.2) with high habitat quality. <br> \n <br> \nResults from this survey indicate that the fish community in Leavitt Lake is healthy as indicated by an FIBI score that exceeds the exceptional use threshold determined for similar lakes. These results will be considered when the biological health of the lake is assessed during the Pine River Watershed assessment process, which will be completed in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.</p>",

Another lake resident contends that walleye and crappie fishing was better in the past.  Local residents constitute the majority of the angling pressure.  Most of the cabins are situated in the trees back from the shoreline and give the lake the impression of  being less developed than it really is.  A number of small, spring-fed tributaries enter the lake on the north side.  Three of these were sampled with the Coffelt Backpack shocker to investigate the possibility of inhabitation by brook trout.  Brook trout were absent and very few minnows were captured.  One loon was observed.Present Fish Population Status:  Northern pike and yellow perch catch rates have declined since the 1985 netting.  Walleye have increased from 1.33/lift in 1985 to 2.00/lift in 1990.  Species that exhibit high numbers are black bullhead, pumpkinseed, rock bass, bluegill and black crappie.  Growth rates were average for all species aged.Also, a single brook trout was sampled in a gill net.</p>",

A nearshore survey was conducted to assess the populations of both game and non-game fish species.  Ten 100' long sampling stations were evenly spaced around the lakeshore.  Each station was then sampled by backpack electrofishing, and if conditions allowed with a 15' or 50' 1/8th inch seine. <br> \n <br> \nThe survey took place July 18, 2022, with all 10 stations sampled by backpack electrofishing.  The 50' 1/8th inch seine was not used and the 15' 1/8th inch seine was used at 6 stations.  Thirteen species were sampled, including five species that are intolerant of habitat disturbance: Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Least Darter, Northern Sunfish, and Rock Bass. This nearshore survey will be used along with the gill net and trap net survey conducted the week of June 13th, 2022, to calculate a Fish-Based Index of Biotic Integrity (FIBI) score.  The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health by the types of fish species present and comparing it to what is expected for this type of lake.</p>",

The water has a brown tint bog stain color with a secchi disc reading of 6.0 feet. The northern pike catch rate in gill nets was low compared to similar lake types, but higher than past nettings. The average size was 21.3 inches with fish up to 35.8 inches observed. The walleye population is low and only two fish were observed. Black crappie numbers were similar to past surveys with modest numbers observed and sizes ranging from 4.50 to 9.7 inches present.  The average size was small at 6.2 inches.  Bluegills were present in good numbers with 30 percent of the fish greater than 7.0 inches.  <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Leavitt is a 130 acre lake located about one mile northeast of the city of Outing.  There is a public access on the southwest end of the lake.  It is a lake with moderately hard water, moderate phosphorus fertility and water clarity somewhat below average for the area due to bog staining.  Maximum depth is about 60 feet and roughly 29% of the lake is less than 15 feet deep.  Shallow water soils are predominantly sand and marl, with limited amounts of gravel, rubble sized rock and muck.  Diversity of the aquatic plant community is somewhat limited.  The scattered bulrush beds provide important spawning habitat for bass and panfish species.  Submergent species, which grow to a depth of at least ten feet in the lake, provide an important source of food and cover for a variety of fish species.Northern pike were caught in low numbers in 1996 in comparison to similar type lakes, but the catch rate was similar to those from previous nettings.  A number of age classes were sampled and growth was good.Walleyes were caught in \"average\" numbers compared to similar type lakes.  The catch remains  below desireable levels and is similar to most previous survey catches.  As a result, walleye stocking has been discontinued.Largemouth bass continued to be sampled in low-average numbers, similar to previous catches.  Bass are probably more abundant than net catches indicate because they are often difficult to sample with stationary nets.  Bluegills were caught in \"average\" numbers in 1996.  Bluegill growth was slow, but about 14% of the catch was at least 7.0 inches long, similar to results seen in the 1990 netting.  Black crappies were found in high numbers in 1996 for the third straight time.  About 71% of the crappie sample was from the 1991 year class.  Crappie growth was slow through at least age five.Major forage species sampled in 1996 included yellow perch, tullibees and white suckers.  All were taken in numbers considered to be \"average\" and catches were similar to those seen in previous nettings.</p>",

The water has a brown tint bog stain color with a Secchi disc reading of 5.0'.  Leavitt is a long narrow lake with sharp drop-offs along much of the shoreline. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappies were sampled in average numbers, when compared to similar lakes, at 2.7/gill net, and high numbers in trap nets (6.2/net).  They ran a little bit on the smaller side with an average length of 6.8\" in gill nets and 7.0\" in trap nets.  For both gears combined 18% were at least 8.0\" in length.  Bluegills were sampled in average numbers at 10.3/net.  Average length was 6.3\", with 45% at least 7.0\" in length. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass were sampled by a spring electrofishing survey at a rate of 29.0/hr run time.  Average length was 12.8\", with 62% at least 12.0\" in length. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike were sampled in low numbers at 1.3/gill net.  Average length was 18.9\", with 25% in the protected 22\"-26\" slot.  The largest Northern Pike sampled was 23.3\". <br> \n <br> \nThree Walleyes were captured in gill nets and ranged from 14.7\"-18.7\" in length.  Walleyes were also sampled by the spring electrofishing survey at a rate of 19.0/hr run time.  Average length was 8.9\" with fish ranging from 5.2\"-15.2\".  All Walleyes are from natural reproduction or were stocked fish that migrated upstream from Roosevelt. <br> \n <br> \nOne 42.5\" Muskie was sampled in the spring electrofishing survey.  Muskies are stocked into nearby Roosevelt Lake which is downstream of Leavitt. <br> \n <br> \nNo invasive species have been discovered in Leavitt, but they are in the area.   Lake users are required to inspect and remove any aquatic plants and animals from their watercraft and trailers, as well as pull the plug and drain all water from the watercraft, including bilges, livewells and baitwells. <br> \n</p>",
