                "narrative": "<p>Spring is a 32 acre lake with 26 (81%) littoral area and a maximum depth of 25 feet.  Spring Lake is located eight miles northeast of Barnum, MN off the Spring Lake Road.  Spring Lake can be accessed by trailer on the south end, off the Spring Lake Road.  Fish population investigations have been conducted in 1974 and 1999.     Northern pike abundance indexed with assessment nets was 17.5 per lift in 1999.  This index value was much higher than other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Size and growth of northern pike were poor.  Mean length of sampled northern pike was 18.8 inches and length at the beginning of their fourth year of life was 20.7 inches.  No sampled northern pike were older than age IV.     Yellow perch abundance indexed with assessment nets was 10.0 per lift in 1999.  This index value was average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Size of sampled yellow perch was small but growth was fast.  Mean length was 6.6 inches and length at the beginning of their second year of life was 5.2 inches.  No sampled yellow perch were older than age III.     Bluegill abundance indexed with assessment nets was 1.1 per lift in 1999.  This index value is very low compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Size of sampled bluegill was small but growth was fast.  Mean length was 4.2 inches and length at the beginning of their second year of life was 3.5 inches.  No sampled bluegill were older than age II.     Pumpkinseed sunfish abundance indexed with assessment nets was 12.7 per lift in 1999.  This index value was high compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Size of sampled pumpkinseeds was small with a mean length of 4.5 inches.     Other species sampled during the 1999 lake survey include white sucker and central mudminnow.  Black crappie, which were sampled during the 1974 investigation, were not sampled in 1999.  Conversely, bluegill and pumpkinseed sunfish, which were not sampled in 1974, were sampled in 1999.  The absence of fish older than age IV in the 1999 sample and the species composition dominated by northern pike, yellow perch and pumpkinseed sunfish would suggest Spring Lake was subject to a low-winter oxygen event in the mid 1990's.</p>",

The lake is located 8 miles northeast of Barnum, MN and can be accessed by trailer off the county road along the south shore.  Black crappie adults were stocked in 2001.  Primary management species are northern pike and black crappie.     Northern pike abundance of 20.0 per gillnet lift was well above average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Mean length of 20.2 inches was small.  Growth was slow with length at age four of 20.0 inches.  Analysis of age distribution revealed a strong 2001 year-class and all years from 1998 through 2002 represented.     Black crappie abundance of 2.1 per trapnet lift was average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Mean length of 5.1 inches was small.  Analysis of age distribution revealed 24 of 25 sampled crappie were born in 2002.     Bluegill abundance of 10.3 per trapnet lift was average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Mean length of 4.5 inches was small.  Growth was fast with length at age two of 3.1 inches.  Analysis of age distribution revealed a strong 2002 year-class and only three year-classes represented.     Pumpkinseed sunfish abundance of 12.0 per trapnet lift was above average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Mean length of 4.2 inches was small.</p>",
