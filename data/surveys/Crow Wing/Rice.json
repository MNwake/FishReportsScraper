It is part of Rice Reservoir which is formed by the Potlatch Paper Company dam on the Mississippi River at Brainerd.  The lake has moderately-hard water and moderate phosphorus fertility.  Water clarity is below average for the area.  About 47% of the lake is shallower than 15 feet.  Shallow water soils are primarily sand and gravel.  Development included over 100 homes/cabins, three resorts and a city park (with a fishing pier and a public access).  The aquatic plant community is rather diverse.  Emergent vegetation can provide important spawning habitat for bass and panfish species.  Shallow, marshy areas are important for northern pike spawning.  Submergent vegetation grew to a depth of about 12 feet in 1994.  These plant species provide cover and feedeing areas for a wide variety of fish species.The fish community sampled in the '94 netting was also quite diverse.  Northern pike, walleyes and smallmouth bass were the most abundant gamefish sampled.  Northern pike were caught in \"average\" numbers compared to similar type lakes.  Four age classes were sampled and the 1991 year class was most abundant.  Growth was good.  Average length was 24 inches and average weight 2.1 lbs..  Walleyes were caught in \"average\" numbers.  Six age classes were sampled and growth appeared good.  Average length was 14 inches and average weight 1.5 lbs..Smallmouth bass, first sampled in '94, were caught in \"high\" numbers compared to similar type lakes.  Sampled fish ranged from 13-17 inches and averaged 2.5 lbs. in weight.  Largemouth bass were present but were only sampled, as young fish, in shoreline seine hauls.Sunfish species sampled included bluegills, pumpkinseeds and rock bass.  All were caught in \"average\" numbers.  Bluegills were slow growing until age five.  About 17% were 7.0 inches or more in length.  Black crappies were caught in \"low\" numbers in trapnets but in \"average\" numbers in gillnets.  The yellow perch catch rate was \"high\" compared to similar type lakes.Other species sampled in '94 included bigmouth buffalo, white suckers, shorthead redhorses, silver redhorses, black bullheads, brown bullheads, yellow bullheads and bowfin (dogfish).</p>",

Nets were lifted and reset daily through May 12.   <br> \n <br> \nSeven captures of six muskellunge occurred during the netting with one recapture.  The six individual muskellunge captured in this survey ranged from 40.2 to 46.1 inches in length with a mean length of 43.6 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nA special fishing regulation requires all muskellunge caught from the Mississippi River from the Blandin Dam in Grand Rapids downstream to the Coon Rapids Dam including Rice Lake must be immediately released.   <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Rice Lake is a 322 acre impoundment of the Mississippi River created by a dam owned by the City of Brainerd.  Because of this, not only will anglers find typical lake species but there are also riverine species present as well.  Smallmouth bass is the primary management species while walleye, northern pike, and muskellunge are secondary management species. <br> \n <br> \nThe smallmouth bass catch rate was 0.7/gill net, which is above average for lakes similar to Rice.  The average length of these fish was an impressive 17.5\".  Fish as large as 18.4\" were sampled with all of the smallmouth bass measuring greater than 12\".  Electrofishing was also conducted to sample both largemouth and smallmouth bass.  Although only 1 smallmouth bass was sampled (15.8\"), largemouth bass were sampled at a rate of 15.5 per hour.  The average size of these largemouth bass was 13.7\".  Rice Lake gives anglers in the Brainerd Lakes area an opportunity of fishing for both largemouth and smallmouth bass on the same body of water. <br> \n <br> \nThe walleye catch rate was 2.0/gill net, which is just slightly below average for lakes like Rice.  Average length was nearly 15\" and largest was close to 23\".  About 67% of the walleyes sampled were 12\" or larger.  There were 6 year classes represented with 24 % coming from the 2011 year class. <br> \n <br> \nThe northern pike catch rate was 3.6/gill net.  This is slightly below average for lakes similar to Rice.  The average length was a respectable 24.4\".  Also, 53% were 24\" or larger. <br> \n <br> \nGrowth rates of both walleyes and northern pike are above average in Rice due to a decent forage base of yellow perch.  The yellow perch catch rate was 16.2/gill net, which is above average for lakes like Rice.  Although most of them don't attain sizes preferred by anglers, many are the perfect size forage for the walleye and northern pike of Rice Lake. <br> \n <br> \nPanfish are another option for anglers.  Black crappie catch rates were above average at 6.1/gill net.  The average size was just over 8\" with fish up to nearly 11\" measured.   Forty-one percent of the black crappies were 9\" or larger.  The bluegill catch rate was 12.4/trap net, which is a little below average.  The bluegill average size was 6.3\" with the largest being 8.7\".  Twenty-one percent of bluegill were 7\" or larger. <br> \n <br> \nBecause of the riverine influence on Rice Lake, channel catfish are available to anglers.  The catch rate was 1.1/gill net while the average size was 18.2\".  <br> \n <br> \nMuskellunge offer another unique fish anglers may try for.  Although none were sampled during the survey, there are angler reports of fisherman catching them in Rice Lake as well as the Mississippi River.  Muskellunge were stocked in the Mississippi River in 1980 and again starting in 2006. <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species sampled include bowfin (dogfish), brown bullhead, greater redhorse, hybrid sunfish, rock bass, shorthead redhorse, silver redhorse, and yellow bullhead. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Rice Lake is a 434-acre reservoir located on the northeast side of Brainerd in Crow Wing County.  The reservoirs dam is 0.5 miles downstream from the state highway 25 (Mill Avenue) bridge.  A public access is located on the south side of Rice Lake, in Lum Park.  Rice lake has a maximum depth of 25 feet and 47% of the lake is 15 feet deep or less.  Two exotic species have been confirmed to be present.  The aquatic plant curly-leaf pondweed has been present for many years, and zebra mussels were found in 2005.  In 2007 zebra mussels were extremely abundant, and were located in all areas of the lake.  Lake users should take extreme precaution and clean and drain all boat livewells and any item  (minnow buckets etc.) that will be transported off the lake. The potential to transport these species to other waters is greater. The northern pike catch rate of 4.33/gill net is within range of the previous five surveys of 0.33/gill net (1985) to 6.56/gill net (2004).  Size ranged from 18.0 to 31.4 inches, with an average of 23.0 inches.  A total of 31% were 24.0 inches or greater.   Age classes one thru six were present.  Growth rate was good.  The 2004 survey, along with the 2007 survey were the best ever for size and number on this lake.  <br> \n <br> \nThe river system's smallmouth population continues to grow; in Rice Lake proper the catch rate of 2.22/gill net was an all-time high for this lake.  Size ranged from 6.4 to 19.0 inches.  A total of 45 % were 12.0 inches or greater. <br> \n <br> \nThe walleye catch rate of 3.89/gill net is an all-time high for this lake.  Past surveys ranged from 1.17/gill net (1985) to 2.92/gill net (1967).  Sizes ranged from 7.8 to 25.5 inches and averaged 13.9 inches.  Age classes one thru eight were present.  These are all naturally reproducing fish. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie catch rate of 10.78/gill net is higher than previous nettings.  Sizes ranged from 4.5 to 10.4 inches with an average of 6.4 inches.  A total of 16% were 8.0 inches or greater.  Age classes one and two dominated the catch.  Bluegill was present in moderate numbers and ranged in size from 4.6 to 9.4 inches.  A total of 67% were 7.0 inches or greater.   Three channel catfish were captured in 2007.  They ranged in size from 18.4 to 23.1 inches.  This was the first confirmation of this species being present above the Brainerd dam. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Rice Lake is a 322 acre impoundment of the Mississippi River created by a dam owned by the City of Brainerd.  Because of this, not only will anglers find typical lake species, but there are also riverine species present as well.  One of those species that has really taken off is Channel Catfish.  The catch rate in 2021 of 32.7/net was up considerably from the previous survey in 2014 (1.1/gill net).  Average size was 16.8\", with fish ranging from 9.5\" to 24.5\".   <br> \n <br> \nAnother fish species that you won't find a lot of places in the Brainerd Area is Smallmouth Bass. They were caught in above average numbers (1.3/gill net) for this type of lake.  Average length was 12.9\" and 58% were 12\" or larger.  Fish up to 17.8\" were caught.  Night electrofishing was done for both Largemouth and Smallmouth Bass.  While only one Smallmouth Bass was captured, Largemouth were captured at the rate of 36.4/hour.  This was up from the previous survey in 2014 (15.5/hour).  Average length was 13.6\" and 85% were 12\" or larger. <br> \n <br> \nPanfish are popular on Rice in both the winter and open water seasons.  In 2021, new regulations were adopted for the Mississippi River from the Brainerd Dam upstream to Highway 6, including Rice Reservoir, that reduces the daily possession limit to 5 for crappie and sunfish. This new regulation is intended to protect and improve panfish sizes on this stretch of water.  The average size of Black Crappies in this survey was 8.2\", with 59% measuring 8\" or larger.  Bluegill average size was 7.5\", with 28% of the fish 7\" or larger. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye were caught in average numbers (2.6/gill net) for this type of lake.  Average length was 13.0\" and 64% of the fish were 12\" or larger. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike numbers were low at 1.3/gill net.  Average size was 23.4\", with 33% of the fish within the 22-26\" protected slot and 33% over 26\".  Muskellunge offer another unique fish that anglers may try for.  Although none were sampled during the survey, there are angler reports of fisherman catching them in Rice Lake as well as the Mississippi River.  Seven fish were caught in a special Muskellunge assessment in the spring of 2017 on this stretch of the reservoir. <br> \n</p>",

It is formed by the Potlatch Paper Company dam on the Mississippi River.  A public access is located on the south side in Lum Park.  Rice Reservoir has a maximum depth of 25 feet and 47% of the lake is 15 feet deep or less.  During the 1994 survey, 111 homes/cabins, three resorts, and a city park (with a fishing pier and a public access) were located on the lake.  The aquatic plant community consisted of 31 species of which wild celery was the most abundant.  Aquatic plants are important in providing food, cover, and spawning habitat for fish and other aquatic species.  The shallow water substrate was predominately sand.The walleye catch rate was average numbers in 2004 when compared to similar lakes (2.7/gill net).  Average size was 13.8\" and 1.2 lbs.  Growth was slow. Fifty percent of the fish were 12\" or larger.The northern pike catch rate was average when compared to similar type lakes and the highest to date (6.6/gill net).  The 2001 year class represented 41% of the fish with most of these fish measuring 18.0\" to 26.9\".  Size averaged 22.0\" and 2.5 lbs.  These fish had fast growth and 27% of the fish were 24\" or larger.The smallmouth bass catch went up from 0.7/gill net in 1994 to 2.0/gill net in 2004.  Average length and weight was 16.0\" and 2.4 lbs.  The 1998 and 2000 year classes accounted for 73% of the fish.  Growth was normal and 94% of the fish were 12\" of larger.The black crappie catch rate was above average and the highest to date (10.1/gill net).  Average length was 6.3\" and only 6% of the fish were 8\" or larger.  The 2002 and 2003 year classes represented 91% of the fish.  Growth was normal.The bluegill trap net catch rate was below average (4.6/trap net).  This was down from the 1994 catch of 25.7/trap net.  Average length was 5.7\" and 20% of the fish were 7\" or larger.  The bluegill gill net catch rate was 4.9/gill net.  Average length of these fish was 6.8\" and 27% were 7\" or larger.  Combing both types of nets showed that 64% of the fish were from the 2001 year class.  Growth was fast.The yellow perch catch rate was average (12.1/gill net), however, it was the lowest catch rate to date.  Average length was 6.5\" and 7% were 8\" or larger.  The 2000 and 2002 year classes represented 77% of the fish.  Growth was normal.Other fish species captured included bowfin (dogfish), greater redhorse, hybrid sunfish, largemouth bass, pumpkinseed, rock bass, shorthead redhorse, silver redhorse, white sucker, and yellow bullhead.</p>",
