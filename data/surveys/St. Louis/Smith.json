No black crappie were taken in 1990.  Their abundance was high in 1978, but, information is based on low sampling effort (2 trapnets).</p>",

Smith does not have a developed public access but can be accessed across Highway #44 right-of-way.  Fish population investigations have been conducted in 1952, 1971, 1978, 1990 and 2000.     Walleye abundance indexed with assessment nets was 8.3 per lift.  This index value was typical compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Size of walleye was small and growth rates were slow.  Mean length of sampled walleye was 13.2 inches and length at the beginning of their fifth year of life was 13.3 inches.  From a sample of aged walleye it was determined that 52% were born in 1997 and seven year classes were represented from 1992 to 1999.     Yellow perch abundance indexed with assessment nets was 16.7 per lift.  This index value was above average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Size of yellow perch was small and growth rates were fast.  Mean length of sampled yellow perch was 6.4 inches and length at the beginning of their fifth year of life was 7.7 inches.  A sample of aged yellow perch showed that 66% were born in 1998 and no perch were older than age V.     Northern pike abundance indexed with assessment nets was 3.0 per lift.  This index was typical compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Size and growth of sampled northern pike was average.  Mean length was 21.4 inches and length at the beginning of their fifth year of life was 23.1 inches.  A sample of aged northern pike showed that 72% were born in 1997 or 1998 and no northerns were older than age VI.     Black crappie, pumpkinseed sunfish and white sucker were all sampled in low numbers relative to other lakes of similar type.  Mean length of pumpkinseed sunfish was 5.0 inches.  Rock bass abundance index was above average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Mean length of rock bass was 6.3 inches.     Other fish species sampled during the lake survey included johnny darter, largemouth bass, shorthead redhorse and tullibee.  A total of five young-of-the-year (YOY) largemouth bass were recorded from shoreline seine samples.  Mean length of YOY largemouth bass was 1.6 inches.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Smith (Lower Pequaywan) Lake is a 193-acre lake with 74 (38%) littoral acres and a maximum depth of 51 feet. The lake is located about 14 miles northeast of Two Harbors, MN but there is no public access to the lake.  Walleye is the primary management species and Northern Pike is the secondary management species.  Smith was last surveyed in 2000.  Smith was surveyed during the summer of 2020 to update information about fish populations and gather information about coldwater fish species presence and abundance.   <br> \n <br> \nWalleye reproduce naturally in Smith and the lake has not been stocked since 1970.  Walleye abundance of 4.8 per gillnet lift was down from 2000 (8.3) but was still average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Walleye average length was 16.7 inches and growth was slow compared to other Duluth Area lakes.  The proportion of adult Walleye captured that exceeded quality size (greater than 15 inches) was 80%.  The 2015 year-class was strong, contributing to over 50% of the overall catch.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike abundance of 7.2 per gillnet lift was up from 2000 (3.0) and above average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Northern Pike average length was 21.2 inches but no preferred size fish (greater than 28 inches) were captured. <br> \n <br> \nSpring bass sampling was suspended during 2020 due to the pandemic.  However, both Largemouth and Smallmouth Bass are present in Smith.  Smallmouth Bass abundance of 1.2 per gillnet lift was average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  The proportion of adult Smallmouth Bass captured that exceeded quality size (greater than 14 inches) was 86%, while the proportion captured that exceeded memorable size (greater than 17 inches) was 14%.   <br> \n <br> \nIn addition to Smallmouth Bass, Smith Lake offers quality angling opportunities for Black Crappie.  Black Crappie abundance of 1.9 per trapnet lift was up from 2000 (0.6) and average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Black Crappie average length was large at 9.1 inches and growth was fast compared to other Duluth Area lakes.  The proportion of adult Black Crappie captured that exceeded preferred size (greater than 10 inches) was 75%, while the proportion captured that exceeded memorable size (greater than 12 inches) was 17%.   <br> \n <br> \nBluegill abundance of 13.8 per trapnet lift was average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Bluegill were not sampled in any previous surveys dating back to 1952, but have now become well-established with numerous year-classes and consistent reproduction documented.   <br> \n <br> \nTwo specialized vertical gillnets (VGNs) designed to sample fish throughout the entire water column were also deployed during the survey.  A VGN is a series of seven different size meshes (range, 0.375-1.5 inch) set side-by-side that extend from the water's surface to within one meter of the bottom over the deepest areas of the lake.  A VGN samples the open-water fish community that exists above and beyond traditional bottom-set gillnets.  A single Cisco was captured at each VGN station for an abundance of 1.0 per lift, with an average length of 7.2 inches.  One Cisco was also captured in the standard gillnets for an abundance of 0.2 per lift which was below average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.</p>",
