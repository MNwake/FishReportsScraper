AN ABUNDANT CISCO POPULATION (15.3/GILLENT LIFT) IS AVAILABLE FOR FORAGE.  THE CISCO RANGED IN LENGTH FROM 7 TO 14 INCHES, INDICATING DIFFERENT AGE CLASSES.  BLG ABUNDANCE (10.75/TRAPNET LIFT) FELL BETWEEN THE FIRST QUARTILE AND THE MEDIAN.  THE SIZE DISTRIBUTION SHOWS MANY AGE CLASSES WITH AGE 4 (7.0-7.4 INCHES) BEING THE MOST ABUNDANT. GROWTH WAS GOOD FOR ALL AGES.  THE RSD-7 WAS 47 AND THE RSD-8 WAS 19.  BLC WERE CAPTURED AT A RATE OF 2.0/TRAPNET LIFT, WHICH FELL BETWEEN THE MEDIAN AND THE THIRD QUARTILE.  GROWTH WAS GOOD AT ALL AGES, WITH A 9 INCH FISH BEING 4 YEARS OLD.  RKB AND PMK WERE OTHER CEN THAT WERE CAPTURED.  NO LMB WERE CAUGHT.  NO YEP WERE CAUGHT IN THE GILLNET, BUT SIX WERE CAUGHT IN THE TRAPNET, FOR A RATE OF 1.5/LIFT.  NO BLHS WERE CAUGHT.</p>",
