Willard Lake has been a designated trout since 1956.  The only type of trout that has been stocked has rainbow trout.The population assessment was conducted because of angler complaints of poor fishing.  A total of five rainbow trout were sampled.  These trout ranged in length from 7.3 to 10.2 inches and had an average length and weight of 9.2 inches and 0.3 pounds.  All five trout were one year old fish. </p>",

A county owned carry-in public access is located on the north shore of the lake.  Willard Lake is one of five lakes in the Walker Fisheries Management Area designated as a stream trout lake and stocked annually with rainbow trout.  The trout population in Willard Lake depends upon stocking because rainbow trout do not naturally reproduce in this lake.  The rainbow trout catch rate increased in 2003 when compared to the 2002 survey.  The 2003 catch rate (20.0 per lift) met the long-range goal of 10 to 20 fish per lift.  Two year-classes of rainbow trout were captured with a mean length of 11 inches and the lengths ranged from 8 to 14 inches.  Since 1998, Fisheries personnel have been sampling zooplankton, the tiny animals on which Willard Lake rainbow trout feed.  The quantity of zooplankton available in Willard Lake is relatively low and biologists are currently investigating the annual fluctuation in trout survival by examining the food supply.</p>",

The trout population in Willard Lake depends upon stocking because rainbow trout do not naturally reproduce in this lake.

The rainbow trout catch rate increased in 2002 when compared to the 2001 survey.  This catch rate (17.5/lift) fell between the long-range management goal of 10 to 20 per lift.  The average length of sampled rainbow trout was 9 inches.  Biologists at the Walker Fisheries office are currently investigating the annual fluctuation in trout survival by examining the food supply.</p>",

A county owned carry-in public access is located on the north shore of the lake.  Willard Lake is one of five lakes in the Walker Fisheries Management Area designated as a stream trout lake and stocked annually with rainbow trout.  The trout population in Willard Lake depends upon stocking because rainbow trout do not naturally reproduce in this lake.  No rainbow trout were captured in 2004, however several black crappie and bluegill were sampled.  It is highly likely that black crappie and bluegill were illegally stocked into Willard Lake.  This is unfortunate because it will compromise our ability to provide trout fishing opportunities in this lake.  Since 1998, Fisheries personnel have been sampling zooplankton, the tiny animals on which Willard Lake rainbow trout feed.  The quantity of zooplankton available in Willard Lake is relatively low and biologists are currently investigating the annual fluctuation in trout survival by examining the food supply.</p>",

The only species of trout stocked in Willard Lake has been rainbow trout.During the 1994 assessment a total of 10 rainbow trout were sampled for a catch-per-unit-of-effort of 5.0/gillnetlift. This catch was considerably lower than catches recorded in 1992 (14.5/lift) and 1988 (15.0/lift). The 1994sample ranged in length from 5.7 - 9.8 inches and had a mean length of 8.1 inches.  All the rainbow trout areprobably one year old fish with anglers harvesting most trout before they can reach age 2.No other species of fish was sampled in the gill nets.

No rainbow trout were collected during the 2001 gill net survey.  This observation is consistent with previous assessments when no or very few rainbow trout were collected.

A county owned carry-in public access is located on the north shore of the lake.  Willard Lake is one of five lakes in the Walker Fisheries Management Area designated as a stream trout lake and stocked annually with rainbow trout.  The trout population in Willard Lake depends upon stocking because rainbow trout do not naturally reproduce in this lake.  No rainbow trout were captured in 2005; however, several black crappie were sampled.  The black crappie were likely illegal introductions by the public.   Since 1998, Fisheries personnel have been sampling zooplankton, the tiny animals on which Willard Lake rainbow trout feed.  The quantity of zooplankton available in Willard Lake is relatively low and biologists are currently investigating the annual fluctuation in trout survival by examining the food supply.</p>",
