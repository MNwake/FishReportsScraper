THE BASS POPULATION APPEARS TO BE FIRMLY ESTABLISHED AS SEVERAL YEAR CLASSES WERE OBSERVED AND ANGLER CAUGHT FISH OF UP TO FOUR POUNDS WERE REPORTED.  A LOW POPULATION OF WAE EXISTS IN THE LAKE.  BECAUSE THERE IS NO HISTORY OF WAE STOCKING IN BALDY LAKE IT IS SUSPECTED FISH FROM DOCK LAKE MAY HAVE EMIGRATED DURING YEARS OF HIGH WATER.  FIVE AGE GROUPS WERE SAMPLED SUGGESTING NATURAL REPRODUCTION IS OCCURRING WITHIN THE POPULATION.  BLGS WERE RELATIVELY ABUNDANT BUT EXHIBITED SLOWER THAN NORMAL GROWTH. IT APPEARS BLGS PROVIDE THE FORAGE BASE REQUIRED TO SUPPORT LMB AND WAE POPULATIONS.  NOP WERE CONPICUOUSLY ABSENT FROM THE SAMPLE AND HAVE NEVER BEEN RECORDED IN PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS.  IN THE ABSENCE OF A NOP POPULATION WAES APPEAR TO BE SUSTAINING THEIR NUMBERS WITHIN A VERY LIMITED ENVIRONMENT.</p>",
