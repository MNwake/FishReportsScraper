                "narrative": "<p>Thirteen species of fish were captured during mid-summer assessment netting.  Total biomass of combined trap net and gill net catches are described by percent for all species captured: northern pike (33%), walleye (21%), bluegill (16%), white sucker (12%), yellow bullhead (6%), largemouth bass (3%), black crappie (3%), brown bullhead (2%), tullibee (2%), pumpkinseed (1%), rock bass (1%), hybrid sunfish (<1%) and yellow perch (<1%).A gill net CPUE for northern pike of 1.3 falls below the first quartile of 2.3, a value established for this lake class.  An historical mean catch rate of 2.5/gillnet, calculated from four previous assessments dating back to 1954, infers low northern pike abundance and may be inherent in this lake.  Due to the small sample size (N=12), any interpretation of cohort strength, growth, or size structure of the northern pike population would have little or no value and will not be included for this species.Walleyes have been stocked in Antler Lake on four occasions during the past eight years.  Two cohorts (age IV and age VI) were sampled, both of which correspond to stocked years.  No individuals were sampled from the other two years that were stocked, although, only 140 fingerlings were stocked in January, 1987 and 223 yearlings were stocked in October, 1990.  No walleyes aged were determined to be from years when stocking did not occur.  The gill net CPUE for this assessment of 1.3 falls within the first and third quartile of 0.9 and 4.8.  Growth of age IV and age VI fish corresponds with state averages and can be considered normal for lakes in this area.A trap net CPUE of 25.3 for bluegill is slightly higher than the lake class median value of 17.2 but within the first and third quartile of 9.8 and 38.7, respectively.  Growth of this species is slow, as indicated by calculated mean total length at last annulus formation of the following age groups:  Age IV-3.6\" (N=11), Age V-4.3\" (N=5), Age VI-5.2\" (N=6), and Age VII-5.4\" (N=6).Yellow perch abundance was very low at 0.2/gillnet below the first quartile of 1.7.  This species has never been abundant historically.Black crappie were sampled at a gill net CPUE of 0.9 and a trap net CPUE of 1.0, both at lake class medians.  Growth rates of this species appear to be good but the sample size was too small to have much value.Tullibee, white sucker, and rock bass were sampled at numbers between the first quartile and the lake class medians.Yellow and brown bullhead, although reported to have been a problem in the past, were not sampled in the gill nets.  They were, however, captured in low numbers in the trap nets, within the first quatile range.Although the lake is reported to be a good largemouth bass lake only six individuals were sampled in this assessment, this is below the first quartile.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Antler Lake is a class 23 lake located nine miles southeast of Big Fork, MN.  Antler Lake has an inlet from Little Antler Lake on the northeast shore and has a small navigable outlet to Beaver Lake on the southeast shore.  There is a public access on the northwest side of the lake.  The 2002 lake management plan indicates northern pike as the primary species of management with bluegill and black crappie as secondary species.  The 2012 assessment also included additional sampling of near shore fish species in order to calculate an Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) score. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie were sampled with trap nets at a rate of 5.9 fish/net, well above the 3rd quartile value of 2.2 fish/net.  The trap net sampled fish ranged from 4.3 to 10.2 inches and had a mean length of 6.2 inches.  Six age-classes from 2 to 7 years old were identified from scales.  The 2010 year class dominated the sample and may help to improve fishing in a few years.  However, growth was poor compared to other class 23 lakes with fish averaging 8.2 inches after five years of growth. <br> \n <br> \nTrap-net catch rates for bluegill have been above the lake class median of 19.8 fish/net in five of seven assessments.  In 2012, the trap-net catch of 25.7 fish/net was below average for this lake.  Bluegill lengths ranged from 3.5 to 8.0 inches and had a mean length of 5.4 inches.  Six age-classes were identified from scales ranging from age 4 to age 9.  Growth rates were poor compared to other class 23 lakes; mean back-calculated length-at-age 5 was 4.0 inches compared to the lake class median of 5.1 inches. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike gill-net catch rates have ranged from 1.3 to 3.3 fish/net since 1954.  In 2012, northern pike gill-net catch was 3.2 fish/net which was below the lake class median of 5.0 fish/net.  The gill net sampled fish had a moderate size structure, ranging from 19.3 to 28.9 inches with a mean length of 24.4 inches.  Seven year-classes were identified from cliethra and scales ranging from age 3 to 9.  Northern pike averaged 20.8 inches by age 4 which was similar to the statewide average of 20.5. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye did not occur naturally in Antler Lake and the stocking that occurred sporadically from 1969 to 1989 only made modest improvements in the population.  Walleye numbers in Antler Lake have always been low due to the low productivity of the lake.   Catch rates have ranged from 0 fish to a high of 1.6 fish/net 1987.  In 2012, the catch was 0.3 fish/gill net and was below the 1st quartile value of 1.0 fish/net.  The sampled fish ranged from 23.2 to 25.2 inches and had a mean length of 24.0 inches.  Age and growth information was not collected from these three individuals. <br> \n <br> \nTullibee gill-net catch rates have ranged from 0.1 in 2000 to 8.5 fish/net in 1977.  In 2012, the catch was 3.7 fish/net and the second highest since 1982.  The sampled fish ranged from 6.9 to 12.4 inches and had a mean length of 8.7 inches.  Age and growth information was not collected.  Triaenophorus was observed in approximately 50% of the fish. <br> \n <br> \nOther species observed during the population assessment included brown bullhead, hybrid sunfish, largemouth bass, pumpkinseed sunfish, rock bass, white sucker, yellow bullhead, and yellow perch.  Additional species observed during IBI sampling included bluntnose minnow, Johnny darter, mottled sculpin, and tadpole madtom. <br> \n <br> \nIn order to maintain or improve fish and wildlife populations, water quality and habitat must be protected.  People often associate water quality problems with large-scale agricultural, forestry, urban development or industrial practices in the watershed.  In reality, the impact of land use decisions on one lake lot may be relatively small, yet the cumulative impact of those decisions on many lake lots can result in a significant decline in water quality and habitat.  For example, removing shoreline and aquatic vegetation, fertilizing lawns, mowing to the water's edge, installing beach sand blankets, failing septic systems and uncontrolled run-off, all contribute excess nutrients and sediment which degrade water quality and habitat.  Understanding these cumulative impacts and taking steps to avoid or minimize them will help to insure our quality fisheries can be enjoyed by future generations.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Antler Lake is 306 acres and is located 9 miles southeast of Bigfork, MN.  Water clarity was excellent with a secchi depth reading of 17 ft at the time of the survey.  Antler Lake is a very clear lake with low productivity which results in relatively light abundance of game fish compared to other lakes with higher productivity.  The lake has a public access on the northwest shore.  Northern pike gill-net catch was 2.3/set which is near the low end of the expected range for similar lakes.  Size structure was good with fish up to 28 inches in length sampled.  Low abundance of northern pike is often related to good size structure.  The population consisted of several age classes with fish up to age nine.  Growth was slightly faster than statewide averages for ages one to five and markedly slower than statewide averages for ages six to nine.  The walleye gill-net catch was 0.8/set which was slightly below the expected range for similar lakes.  The population was characterized by large old fish.  Walleye varied in length from 20 to 29 inches and all fish were aged between seven and 11 years old.  Walleye grew faster than statewide averages until age seven when growth was slower than statewide averages.  Walleye did not occur naturally in Antler Lake and were stocked in various years from 1969 to 1989.  Although walleye were first stocked in 1969, they were not sampled in assessment nets until 1987.  The 2000 assessment evaluated a period of natural reproduction and resulted in a slightly lower catch rate compared to years when walleye were stocked.  The limited natural reproduction which has occurred over the years suggests walleye stocking is necessary to maintain the walleye population.  Because Antler Lake has low productivity, very few walleye survive to reach catchable size and the cost benefit of continued walleye stocking will be need to be evaluated.  Black crappie gill-net catch was 1.0/set and trap-net catch was 1.7/set.  Both catch rates are within the expected range of similar lakes.  Size structure in the trap nets was good with fish up to 10 inches sampled.  Black crappie abundance has historically been low with catch trap-net catch rates varying from 1.0 to 5.0/trap net.  Largemouth bass are difficult to sample in traditional gears such as trap nets and gill nets.  With these cautions in mind, the gill-net catch was 0.2/set and which was slightly lower than the expected range of similar lakes.  Trap-net catch was 0.8/set which was within the expected range of similar lakes.  Size structure was poor with fish in both gears varying in length between five and 13 inches.  Growth was very slow with growth averaging less than 85% of statewide averages.Bluegill trap-net catch was 9.8/set which was within the expected range of similar lakes.  Size structure was poor with a no fish sampled greater than 8 inches.   Bluegill abundance has declined from historical abundance which has varied from 13 to 81/trap net.  Forage species such as tullibee, white sucker, and yellow perch were virtually absent in this assessment.  The tullibee gill-net catch was 0.1/set, white sucker gill-net catch was 0.2/set, and no yellow perch were sampled.  In addition, secondary forage species such as bluegill also appear to be declining.  The apparent lack of suitable forage may be a limiting factor for growth and production of predator species such as walleye and northern pike.  Yellow perch have been stocked in the past to increase the forage base, however, the effects were short lived and a long term increase in their abundance was not realized.  Stocking additional predator species such as walleye in a population with a limited forage base is generally unsuccessful.Lakeshore owners may affect fish populations not only through fishing, but also through land use practices.  It is important to leave a 30 to 50 ft buffer of native vegetation along the shoreline to prevent lawn wastes and sediment from entering the lake.  In addition, lakeshore owners should avoid using fertilizers.  However, if fertilizers must be used lakeshore owners should consider a brand containing no phosphorous.  Nonfunctioning septic systems can also lead to water quality problems.  Good water quality and fish populations are the direct result of good land use practices.</p>",
