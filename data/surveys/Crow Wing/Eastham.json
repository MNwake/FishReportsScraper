Bowfin, pumpkinseed, bluegill and black crappie abundances were average for the lake class.  Northern pike (9.5/gillnet) was abundant, similar to 1967 (8.0/gillnet).  Size was average, at 2.48 lb. ages 2-5 were sampled and growth was good.  Largemouth bass were sampled only by shoreline seine in 1967 and were not sampled in 1992.  Pumpkinseed abundance (4.0/ trapnet) was average and equal to 1967.  Pumpkinseeds averaged 0.19 lb and most were 6.0-6.9 inches long (as in 1967).  Bluegill (23.5/trapnet) abundance was average in 1992 compared to high in 1967 (65.8/trapnet).  Ages 2-7 were sampled and had good growth.  About 55% of measured fish were at least 7.0 inches long (54% in 1967).  Average size was 0.28 lb., large for the lake class.  Black crappie abundance (6.25/trapnet) remained average (9.2/ trapnet) in 1967).  Ages yoy (young of year) and 2-6 were sampled.  Growth was good.  Size (0.30 lb) was average for the lake class.  Yellow perch catch (1.0/ gillnet) was low in 1992, while 1967 abundance (6.0 gillnet) was in the average catch category. Bowfin abundance (1.5/trapnet) and size (4.03 lb) was average.  Yellow bullhead abundance (16.25/trapnet) was high, while that of brown bullhead (0.25/trapnet) was low.  Black bullhead was sampled in 1967 but not in 1992.</p>",
