                "narrative": "<p>Little Elk Lake is a 353-acre general development lake located three miles northwest of Zimmerman in northeastern Sherburne County. A small dam is located at the outlet on the south end of the lake adjacent to the public access. Little Elk Lake has a maximum depth of 15 feet and an average summer water clarity of about three feet. A standard summer survey was conducted in 2017 to monitor changes in the fishery from the last survey completed in 2012. In addition to the summer survey, a targeted Bluegill assessment was conducted in June and an Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) survey was conducted in August. <br> \n <br> \nEmergent and floating-leaf vegetation covered two percent of the lake and six percent of the shoreline in July, consisting primarily of cattail and yellow waterlily. Submerged vegetation was not surveyed this year, but coontail and flat-stemmed pondweed were the dominant species found in 2012. <br> \nIn 2009, the stocking strategy changed to strictly fingerling stocking every other year, after repeated fry stocking attempts produced poor results. The catch for Walleye in 2017 was higher than 2012 and was within the range of expected values for similar lakes. Walleye ranged from 12 to 26 inches with an average length of 18 inches. Eight year classes were represented and 71% of the catch were four years old or younger. These year classes coincided with fingerling stocking done in 2013 and yearling stocking in 2015. <br> \nThe gill net catch for Northern Pike was similar to recent surveys and was within the expected range for the lake class. Northern Pike ranged from 15 to 31 inches with an average length and weight of 23 inches and 3 pounds. Forty three percent of the pike sampled were longer than 24.0 inches four percent were longer than 30 inches. <br> \nLargemouth were sampled by day-time electrofishing on May 30, 2017. A total of 56 Largemouth Bass were collected in 1.67 hours of on-time equating to a catch rate of 33.5/hour. This is lower than the Sauk Rapids area average of 43.3/hour. Largemouth Bass ranged from 5 to 19 inches with an average length of 11 inches.  <br> \nThe catch of Yellow Perch was similar to 2012 and below the expected range of values. Yellow Perch ranged in length from 5 to 8 inches with an average length of 7 inches. <br> \nThe trap net catch of Bluegill was lower than 2012, but still above the range of expected values for lakes similar to Little Elk. Bluegill ranged in length from 3 to 9 inches with an average length of six inches. The catch for Black Crappie was higher than 2012 and within the range of expected values for the lake class. Black Crappie were abundant and small with an average length of six inches. <br> \nOther species sampled during the survey included: Bigmouth Buffalo, Black Bullhead, Common Carp, Golden Shiner, Green Sunfish, Hybrid Sunfish, Pumpkinseed, White Sucker and Yellow Bullhead. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Little Elk Lake is located in northeastern Sherburne County, three miles northwest of Zimmerman.  It has a surface area of 353 acres.  Most of the lake is less than eight feet deep, with a maximum depth of 15 feet.  A public access is located along the south shore, and has a boat ramp.  A survey was conducted in 2002 to assess fish populations, and included fall electrofishing and summer netting (trap nets, gill nets, and seines).  Catch rates were compared to lakes with similar characteristics as a way to evaluate the fish populations of Little Elk Lake.  Results were also compared to past surveys of Little Elk Lake (most recently in 1993) to track changes over time.  The survey also included water chemistry analysis, watershed mapping, and an aquatic plant survey.Little Elk Lake's walleye population has been supplemented by stocking fry in alternate years, since natural reproduction within the lake or in Battle Brook is probably limited.  In 2002, the catch rate of walleye was within the expected range for a lake like Little Elk.  Average size (2.6 pounds) was higher than normal, and walleyes ranged from 17 to 27 inches in length.  Fry were stocked most recently in 2000 and 2002, but no evidence of survival of those year classes was seen.  To compensate for these years of low survival, the lake will be stocked again with fry in 2003.As with the walleye, northern pike were larger than average in 2002 (4.5 pounds), and abundance also appeared to be within the normal range.  Northern pike appear to grow quickly in Little Elk Lake and reach large sizes.  Two fish that were sampled in 2002 measured over 37 inches.  Yellow perch appeared to be abundant in 2002 as well as in 1993, and this has probably helped maintain good rates of growth for both northern pike and walleye.Black crappie and bluegill both appeared to have good numbers, but average size was low.  Most of the crappie were from the 1999 and 2000 year classes, and should provide for good angling in the next few years.  The largemouth bass population was sampled by electrofishing in the fall.  Forty-eight bass were captured in one hour of sampling, near the average for the area.  Although many of the bass were small, a few were nearly 19 inches in length.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Little Elk Lake is located in Sherburne County, northwest of Zimmerman. The lake has a surface area of 362 acres and a maximum depth of 15 feet. The watershed is large and consists primarily of agriculture, forest, and wetlands. A small dam is located at the outlet on the south end of the lake and a public access is adjacent to the dam. A small resort is located on the west side of the lake. The last survey was in 2002. <br> \n <br> \nWater quality is poor and only 15 aquatic plant species were found, including Eurasian milfoil, an invasive species. Very little emergent vegetation was present. Curly-leaf pondweed (invasive) was abundant in early June and found growing at or near the surface in 34% of the lake area. An additional 2% of the lake had been chemically treated in the spring to control curly-leaf pondweed. A heavy algal bloom was present in late July, limiting water clarity to one foot. Efforts to improve water quality in Little Elk Lake are recommended and will benefit the fishery as well. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike numbers were higher than 2002, but within the expected range for similar lakes. Average length was 25 inches, the largest individual was 33 inches, and 57% of northern pike were longer than 24 inches. Average weight was 3 pounds. Growth was fast; northern pike grew to 24 inches in three years and most were two or three years old. The fishery could benefit if anglers kept small pike (< 24 inches) and released larger ones. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye fry were stocked with good success in the past, but poor results in recent years led to the current plan for fingerling stocking every other year. The 2012 catch was much lower than 2002 and below the expected range for the lake class. Prior walleye catches have been much higher due to successful fry stocking. Future surveys will hopefully show improving results from fingerling stocking. Average length and weight were 19 inches and two pounds;  the largest walleye caught was 24 inches. Thirty six percent of walleye caught were longer than 20 inches. Growth was fast; most walleye were age four and reached 18 inches in four years. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass were sampled by daytime electrofishing in May. The catch rate of 37/hr is similar to the Montrose median of 38/hr. Average length was 13 inches and the largest individual was 19 inches. Forty-three percent of adult bass were longer than 15 inches. 2002 results were nearly the same, but the average size (10 inches) was smaller. <br> \n <br> \nThe black crappie catch was the highest recorded and far above the expected range for lakes similar to Little Elk. However, mean length (6.2 inches) and weight were low; the largest black crappie was 10 inches long. Most fish were two years old and growth was fast, growing over five inches in two years. However, older fish had slow growth. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill numbers were higher in 2012 than 2002, but within the expected range for similar lakes. Mean length was 5 inches and the largest bluegill was less than eight inches long. Most bluegill were two or three years old and growth was average, reaching 5 inches in three years. <br> \n <br> \nThe yellow perch catch was lower than expected for similar lakes, much lower than in 2002, and the lowest ever recorded from Little Elk Lake. Average length was 6 inches and the largest individual was 7 inches. Other species captured included: black, brown, and yellow bullheads, bowfin, common carp, golden shiner, pumpkinseed, shorthead redhorse, and white sucker.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted Bluegill assessment was conducted on Little Elk Lake from June 6 7, 2017. Targeted surveys using trap nets around spawning time can give a more accurate picture of Bluegill size structure than standard surveys conducted later in the summer. <br> \n <br> \nA total of 671 Bluegill were caught; lengths ranged from 3.5 to 9.3 inches with an average length of 6.7 inches. The size structure of a fish population is typically described using terms such as Proportional Stock Density (PSD) and Relative Stock Density (RSD). For Bluegill, PSD is the percentage of fish longer than three inches that are also longer than six inches. RSD 8 is the percentage of fish longer than three inches that are also longer than eight inches. Little Elk Lake PSD was 95 and RSD 8 was 1. So 95% of Bluegill were six inches or longer and 1% were eight inches or longer. These results seem better than average for overall size, but poor for larger Bluegill. Recent targeted Bluegill surveys in the Sauk Rapids Area have found a PSD range from 26 to 95 and an RSD 8 range from 0 to 54. Bluegill in the standard survey in late July were smaller; mean length was 6.2 inches, PSD was 77, and RSD-8 was 0. <br> \n <br> \nPumpkinseed (n=10) and Hybrid Sunfish (n=4) were caught in low numbers. A total of 588 Black Crappie were also caught; lengths ranged from 5.9 to 12.4 inches with an average length of 7.5 inches. Black Crappie likely finished spawning in May and were not targeted in the current survey. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill grow slowly in the Sauk Rapids Area, taking up to eight years to reach eight inches. Anglers are encouraged to limit their harvest of larger Bluegill (> 8 inches) and keep smaller fish for a meal. This can help prevent stunted populations of small fish and keep larger Bluegill in the system. <br> \n</p>",

The lake has a maximum depth of 15 feet with an average depth of 7 feet and water clarity of 1.5 feet. A standard summer survey was competed in 1982 to update fisheries data last collected in 1978.\n\nNorthern Pike population was average at 3.2/gill net. Six age classes were sampled with age four to five being the most abundant all ages overall had average growth. All Walleye sampled coincided with fry stockings in 1978 and 1979 following a winterkill. Walleye abundance and growth were above average for the area. Largemouth Bass abundance was adequate and natural reproduction was evident by seining. Bluegill abundance remained high, but had decreased from 1978. Walleye age two to five were sampled and had average growth. Black and White Crappie abundance was high.\n</p>",

A standard survey was completed in 1988 to update fisheries data last collected in 1982.\n\nThe Northern Pike population was average (6.0/gill net). Seven age classes were sampled with age two to four being the most abundant and all had good growth.\n\nWalleye abundance was twice the state average at 6.2/gill net. Only age one and two Walleye were sampled in gillnets with age 2 predominant. Age one Walleye coincided with a 1987 fry stocking. Growth was good.\n\nLargemouth Bass were present, but no young of year were sampled by shoreline seining. \n\nBluegill abundance was low and had declined from 1982. Age two to four were sampled and showed good growth.\n\nBlack Crappie abundance remained high at 63.8/trap net. Age one and four fish were abundant in the catch and growth was slower for older fish than younger fish. White Crappie abundance was low and had declined from 1982. Forage species appear to be adequate. \n\nYellow Perch abundance (6.2/gill net) was average, but had declined from 1982.\n\nWhite Sucker abundance was about average for the area, but had declined from 1982. Black Bullhead abundance remained high and had increased from 1982 and most measured less than six inches in length. Common Carp abundance was about average.\n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of the nearshore fish community on Elk Lake was conducted on August 14, 2017 by Fisheries Lake IBI program staff. Sampling stations were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at all ten stations with one site sampled from the boat. Soft sediments with abundant emergent vegetation in deep water prevented the use of seines at one sampling site. Nearshore sampling captured 10 native species of fish including Johnny Darter, Spotfin Shiner, and Largemouth Bass.   <br> \n <br> \nData from this targeted nearshore survey is combined with data from a standard gill and trap netting survey in July 2017 to calculate a Fish-based Index of Biologic Integrity (FIBI) score that describes the overall health of the lake. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment.  The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. The FIBI score for Elk Lake based on this survey is just below the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes.  Data from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Mississippi River-St. Cloud Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.   For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Little Elk Lake is a 362-acre lake located in Sherburne County near Zimmerman. The lake has a maximum depth of 15 feet with an average depth of 7 feet.  A standard survey was completed in 1993 to update fisheries data last collected in 1988.Walleye catch rate (15.2/gill net) significantly increased from 1988 (6.2/gill net). The majority of Walleye caught (93%) were one or two year olds which corresponded with the two most recent fry stockings. Walleye sampled in the gill nets ranged in length from 7.9 to 26.8 inches with an average length of 15.1 inches. Walleye average weight (1.4 pounds) also increased reaching nearly the state average for the lake class (1.5 pounds). Yellow Perch catch rate (26.3/gill net) increased significantly from 1988 (6.2/gill net). Yellow Perch sampled ranged in length from 5.1 to 10.3 inches and averaged 7.1 inches. Northern Pike catch rate (1.0/gill net) significantly decreased from 1988 (6.0/gill net), however, the average weight (5.0 pounds) increased to over twice the state average (2.3 pounds). Northern Pike sampled ranged in length from 19.4 to 34.1 inches and averaged 26.3 inches. Pike sampled aged between two to six years old, but no dominant year class was present. Northern Pike growth rate was fast for fish age one to four and average for age five to six.Black Crappie catch rates significantly decreased in both gill net and trap net sampling, however, the average weight (0.5 pounds) increased to above the state average for the lake class (0.3 pounds). Black Crappie sampled ranged in length from 4.1 to 14.0 inches.Bluegill catch rate (21.7/trap net) significantly increased from 1988 (4.5/trap net). Bluegill sampled ranged in length from 3.6 to 8.5 inches and averaged 5.3 inches.</p>",
