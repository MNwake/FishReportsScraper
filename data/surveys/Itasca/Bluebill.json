                "narrative": "<p>Bluebill (Rice) Lake is a small bass-panfish lake located southeast of Marcell, MN.  The lake has 136 acres, all of which are less than 15 feet (littoral area-100%) in depth.  The maximum depth is 14 feet with a Secchi disk reading of 5.5 feet (light bog stain).  Bluebill is in lake class #37.     From the northern pike sampled in the gill nets it appears that Bluebill Lake has a small population of small fish.  All of the fish sampled in this gear were aged between 2 and 4 years old.  These fish ranged in length from 15.6 to 21.6 inches and had a mean weight of 1.4 pounds.  However, four northern pike sampled in the trap nets had a mean weight of 9.0 pounds.  These fish ranged in length from 31.5 to 38.4 inches.  Growth was comparable with the statewide averages.     Because the West Fork of the Prairie River flows through this lake, walleyes are present, although in small numbers.  Three were sampled in the gill nets at 0.8/net.  They ranged in length from 21.1 to 24.7 inches.  Two were aged at 7, one at 9 years old and had a mean weight of 4.3 pounds.  Growth rates were within 15% of the statewide averages.     Black crappie were sampled at 1.3/gill net and 1.6/trap net, both below the 1st quartile for this lake class.  They ranged in length from 3.7-11.3 inches in the trap net and 5.8-9.3 inches in the gill net.  Growth was slightly slower than the statewide averages but within 15% for all ages.     Bluegill were not sampled in the gill nets in this assessment, however, they were sampled below the 1st quartile in the trap nets.  The bluegill ranged in length from 3.7-10.0 inches and had a mean length of 6.3 inches.  Growth for age 1 and 2 bluegill was similar to the lake class averages but exceeded those averages by 15% for age 3-9.  A four year old bluegill in Bluebill Lake is 7 inches.        Low yellow perch numbers were observed.  Only 0.8/gill net and 0.4/trap net were sampled in this assessment.       Typical of summer netting few largemouth were sampled.  Only one was sampled in this assessment.     Other species sampled were white sucker, pumpkinseed sunfish and rock bass.               </p>",
