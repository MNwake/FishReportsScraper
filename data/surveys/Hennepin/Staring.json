                "narrative": "<p>Northern Pike remain the most abundant predator species in Starring Lake.  2002 catch rates were 10.5 fish/net which is above average for regional lakes.  Average northern pike length was 21.7 inches and average weight was 2.9 pounds.  Thirty-nine percent of northern pike captured were over 24 inches in length with 5 individual fish being greater than 30 inches (10.8%).  The largest northern pike sampled during this survey was 35.8 inches long.The bluegill population in Starring Lake was measured at its lowest abundance level since the 1980 survey.  Only 70 bluegill were captured in 7 trap nets during this survey. Despite the decline in abundance, Starring Lake bluegill maintained an average size of 6.4 inches in length and weighed 0.24 pounds which compares favorably to previous surveys.  Sixty-seven percent of bluegill were over 6.0 inches and 47% were over 7.0 inches in length.Pumpkinseed and hybrid sunfish, as well as both black and white crappie are also present in the lake but at very low abundance levels.  Black crappie were found to be of respectable size (average 8.7 inches) and weight (0.36 pounds).Yellow perch were found to be extremely abundant in Starring Lake during the 2002 survey and were sampled at an historically high catch rate for this lake.  Yellow perch average length was 6.4 inches (range of 5.4 to 8.1 inches), while average weight was measured at 0.05 pounds each (20 fish/pound).The black bullhead population was also sampled at historically high abundance levels for Starring Lake.  However, black bullhead average size was very small.  Bullheads sampled in gill and trap nets averaged 0.17 pounds.  Mean length for bullheads in gill nets was 6.8 inches while bullheads from trap nets measured 7.1 inches long. Common carp and freshwater drum populations were also sampled with moderate frequency and with average sizes in Starring Lake. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Staring (Starring) Lake is a productive, 155-acre, Class 43 lake located in Eden Prairie.  It is bordered by Staring Lake Park, operated by the City of Eden Prairie.  There is a DNR Parks and Trails-owned boat launch on the north side of the lake.  Staring is primarily managed for Northern Pike, and secondarily managed for Bluegill and Largemouth Bass.  In 2015, a Standard Survey was conducted to assess the gamefish populations.   <br> \n <br> \nThe 2015 catch rate of Northern Pike, 13.5 fish per gill net, exceeded the 75th percentile for this Lake Class.  This is a significant increase from the last survey, in 2008, when 4.8 fish per gill net were sampled.  Thirty-eight percent of the fish exceeded 21 inches, and 9% exceeded 28 inches.  The average Northern Pike was 21.0 inches and 2.34 pounds.  The largest fish was 34.8 inches long and 10.28 pounds.  <br> \n <br> \nThe 2015 catch rate of Bluegill in the trap nets, 5.4 per net, has noticeably decreased since the 2008 survey, when 34 fish per net were caught.  Thirty-seven percent of the fish exceeded 6 inches, and none of the fish exceeded 8 inches, though 22% of trap-net-caught Bluegill were at least 7 inches.  The average trap-netted Bluegill was 5.2 inches and 0.15 pounds.   <br> \n <br> \nPassive sampling gears, such as trap nets and gill nets, are not effective methods for collecting Largemouth Bass, so the data presented for this species is not indicative of relative abundance.  Electrofishing is the typical method for Largemouth Bass assessments but was not conducted during this survey.  Eight small bass were collected in the trap nets, ranging in length from 5.1 \u0013 8.2 inches, with an average weight on 0.14 pounds.  One large fish was collected in a gill net, and it was 18.3 inches and 3.61 pounds.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie abundance was high in 2015.  The catch rate of 22.0 fish per gill net exceeded the third quartile for this Lake Class, and is an increase from the 2008 catch rate of 10.3 fish per gill net.  Many small fish were present in the sample; 12% of the Black Crappie exceeded 8 inches, and 3% exceeded 10 inches.  The average fish was 5.24 inches long and 0.11 pounds.  The largest Black Crappie was 14.1 inches and 1.30 pounds.  <br> \n <br> \nThe catch rate of Yellow Perch, 11.7 fish per gill net, was between the median and 75th percentile for this Lake Class.  Size structure is skewed toward smaller individuals; 19% of the fish exceeded 8 inches, and the largest fish was 9.02 inches and 0.42 pounds.  <br> \n <br> \nBlack Bullhead numbers are currently low; the 2015 catch rate of 14.3 per gill net was below the first quartile.  The fish tend to be larger; 63% of the sample exceeded 9 inches.  The average Black Bullhead was 9.4 inches and 0.62 pounds.  The largest fish was 11.8 inches and 1.23 pounds.   <br> \n <br> \nOther fishes sampled in low abundance included Common Carp, Freshwater Drum, Pumpkinseed, hybrid sunfish, White Sucker and Yellow Bullhead.   <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Staring Lake is 167-acres (146 littoral acres) with a maximum depth of 16 feet. Staring is located south of Eden Prairie in southern Hennepin County. Public water access is provided by DNR Parks and Trails on the north side of the lake off of Staring Lake Pkwy (up to 6 vehicle/trailer parking spaces). Staring is primarily managed for Northern Pike, but supports catchable populations of Largemouth Bass, Bluegill, and Black Crappie.  <br> \n <br> \nA Standard Survey (9 trap nets/4 gill nets) was conducted on Staring Lake during the week of 6/14/2021 to assess the fishery. During the 2021 survey, Staring was productive (brown stained water), with moderate water clarity, measured at 8 feet. Dissolved oxygen was 6.1 parts per million (ppm) at 12 feet during the survey period. Invasive plant species Eurasian Watermilfoil and Brittleleaf Naiad have been found in Staring Lake and remain present. <br> \n <br> \nRecord high numbers of Northern Pike were sampled with gill nets (13.8/net). Although catch rates were at record highs, size structure also remained high. There were 54 Northern Pike sampled in gill nets, with an average size of 26.6 inches and the largest measured at 37.4 inches. Northern Pike size indices describe a balanced population (an intermediate between high numbers of small fish and few numbers of large fish). Northern Pike growth rates were fast compared to the statewide average, with an average length of 25 inches by age 5. Furthermore, recruitment and mortality were stable, indicated by 7 consecutive years without a missing age class and a total annual mortality around 23%. Northern Pike in Staring Lake appear to be thriving with high numbers, fast growth, consistent recruitment, and low mortality. As a reminder, anglers can keep 10 northern pike on Staring Lake, but not more than two pike longer than 26 inches; and all from 22 to 26 inches must be released. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass are present in Staring Lake, although targeted boat-electrofishing did not occur during the 2021 survey. Incidental capture with trap and gill nets caught 8 Largemouth Bass, which averaged 9.3 inches, and the largest measured at 12.6 inches. <br> \n <br> \nExtremely high numbers of Bluegill were sampled with trap nets (170.7/net), over eight times the expected catch rate. There were 1,536 Bluegill sampled in trap nets during the 2021 survey, with an average length of 5.4 inches and the largest measured at 7.5 inches. High Bluegill densities and competition among individuals are likely reducing growth potential and keeping sizes low. <br> \n <br> \nModerate numbers of Black Crappie were sampled with gill nets (7.8/net) and trap nets (2.0/net). There were 49 Black Crappie sampled during the 2021 survey, with an average length of 8.2 inches and the largest measured at 13.8 inches. Size indices reveal a balanced population. Although abundances may be limited, this likely contributed to reduced competition and increased growth, allowing Black Crappie in Staring Lake to reach sizes greater than 12 inches. <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species sampled in low abundances were Black Bullhead, Brown Bullhead, Common Carp, Freshwater Drum, Golden Shiner, Green Sunfish, Pumpkinseed, Walleye, White Sucker, Yellow Bullhead, and Yellow Perch.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of nearshore fish species in Staring Lake was conducted on June 21, 2022, by Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program staff. Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake, and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at ten sampling stations. Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample eight stations and site conditions prevented the use of seines at two stations. Nearshore sampling captured ten species of fish including no species that are intolerant of disturbance and three that are tolerant of disturbance (i.e., Black Bullhead, Common Carp, and Green Sunfish). <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore data were combined with trap net and gill net data from a June 2021 survey to describe the fish community and provide a fish-based IBI (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment. In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g., Blackchin Shiner, Iowa Darter, and Rock Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g., Black Bullhead, Common Carp, and Fathead Minnow). The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.  <br> \n <br> \nResults from this survey indicate that the fish community in Staring Lake is healthy as indicated by an FIBI score above the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes. These results are similar to previous survey findings, which indicated that Staring Lake is fully supporting aquatic life use. These results will be considered when the biological health of the lake is assessed during the Lower Minnesota River Watershed assessment process, which will be completed in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency. <br> \n <br> \nIBI Program staff also conducted an assessment of lakeshore habitat on June 22, 2022, following the Score the Shore survey protocols. The assessment consisted of 32 survey sites evenly spaced 100 meters around the lake. Assessments were made in three habitat zones: Shoreline Zone (the shore-water interface to the top of the natural bank), Shoreland Zone (land-ward from shoreline to development structure or 100 feet), and Aquatic Zone (lake-ward 50 feet of shoreline). The average lakewide habitat score was 97.0 (+/- 1.0) out of 100 possible, which indicates that lakeshore habitat quality is high overall. Approximately 15 percent of the sites were developed with a mean score of 91.3 (+/- 4.3), while undeveloped sites had a mean score of 98.0 (+/- 0.8).</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Staring Lake is a productive, 155-acre lake located in Eden Prairie.  It is bordered by Staring Lake Park, operated by the City of Eden Prairie.  There is a state owned boat launch on the north side of the lake.  The fish community in Staring Lake has been dynamic over the years.  The previous population assessment documented a fish community declining in quality with an excess of rough fish.  While there is still an abundance of rough fish currently in the lake, the panfish population has shown an increase in abundance in 2008. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill are the most abundant species in Staring Lake and their abundance (34 per trap net) is considered high compared to similar lakes across the state.  Bluegill abundance is higher than the previous assessment in 2003 (10 per trap net), however mean weight is down from 0.24 pounds in 2003 to 0.18 pounds in 2008.  In the current assessment, mean length was 5.4 inches, the longest was 7.1 inches, and only 13% were longer than 6 inches.  Ages 2 through 6 were represented in the sample and 50% were age 4.  Growth is slower than average compared to similar lakes in the West Metro Area.     <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie abundance was moderately high in both trap (10.3 per net) and gill nets (10.3 per net).  Both gear types showed moderate increases compared to the previous survey in 2003 (1.8 per gill net, 2.4 per trap net).  Mean weight and length of trap net fish were 0.23 pounds and 7.6 inches.  In trap nets, 27% were longer than 8 inches and 4% were greater than 10 inches, the largest measured black crappie was 12.8 inches.  Ages 1 through 7 were represented in the sample and 92% were either age 3 or 4. Growth is slower than average compared to similar lakes in the West Metro Area.       <br> \n <br> \nIn the previous two surveys (2002, 1995) a total of 3 white crappie were collected.  Since then, the population has increased to levels seen in prior decades.  In the 2008 assessment, 5.6 white crappie were captured per trap net (45 total), which is moderately high compared to similar lakes in the state.  Mean length and weight of white crappie was 7.8 inches and 0.23 pounds, with the longest measuring 12.6 inches.  Eighty-four percent were longer than 8 inches and 4% were longer than 10 inches.  Ages 2 through 6 were represented in the sample, 57% were age 2 and 32% were age 3.  Growth is slower than average compared to similar lakes in the West Metro Area.     <br> \n <br> \nIn 2008, northern pike catch (4.8 per gill net) was lower than it has been the past two assessments in 2002 (10.5) and 1995 (10.5).  Despite this, pike abundance is still considered moderately high compared so similar lakes in the state.  Average weight of northern pike has increased from 2.7 pounds in 1995 and 2.9 pounds in 2002 to 4.2 pounds in 2008.  The longest measured pike was 34.9 inches and the average length was 26.7 inches.  Sixty-two percent were greater than 21 inches and 34% were greater than 28 inches.  Ages 4 through 8 were represented in the sample; 69% were either age 5 or 6.  Growth is slower than average compared to other similar lakes in the West Metro Area. <br> \n  <br> \nYellow perch abundance peaked in 2002 with a catch of 88.5 per gill net, however, 2008 yellow perch abundance (0.83 per gill net) was lowest since 1975 (6 prior surveys).  Perch abundance is considered low compared with other class 43 lakes.  Mean yellow perch size also decreased since 2002 from a mean size of 6.8 inches and 0.34 pounds to 5.8 inches and 0.09 pounds in 2008.  All 5 collected were slow growing, between 5.0 an 6.5 inches in length, and were age 3.         <br> \n <br> \nPassive sampling gears, such as trap nets and gill nets, are not effective methods for collecting largemouth bass, so the data presented for this species is not indicative of relative abundance.  Electrofishing is the typical method for largemouth bass assessments but was not conducted during this survey.  That said, 7 largemouth bass were collected in trap nets averaging 15.3 inches and 2.16 pounds.  The longest measured bass was 18.5 inches.    <br> \n <br> \nBlack bullhead numbers are currently low and have decreased from 228.0 per gill net in 2002 to 12.3 per gill net in 2008.  Common carp numbers are moderately high and have increased from 2.25 per gill net in 2002 to 10.0 per gill net in 2008.  Freshwater drum numbers have remained stable for the past few assessments, abundance is considered moderately low compared with similar lakes in the state.  Bigmouth buffalo, pumpkinseed, and yellow bullhead were sampled in low abundance.   <br> \n</p>",
