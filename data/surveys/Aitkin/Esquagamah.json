                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of nearshore fish species in Esquagamah Lake was conducted on 8/6/2019 by DNR Fisheries staff.  Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot seine or 15-foot seine, where possible.  Backpack electrofishing was completed at all fourteen sampling stations.  Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample three stations, a 15-foot seine was used to sample eight stations, and site conditions prevented the use of seines at three stations.  Sampling captured 19 species of fish including two species that are intolerant of disturbance (i.e., Iowa Darter and Rock Bass) and one species that is tolerant of disturbance (i.e., Black Bullhead). <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore data were combined with trap net and gill net data from August 2019 to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based IBI (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment.  In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g., Rock Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g., Common Carp and Black Bullhead).  The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake.  For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.   <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Mississippi River (Brainerd) Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.</p>",

This survey was completed in addition to the standard population assessment conducted the week of August 4, 2014.  Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake (14 stations) and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible.  Species information was gathered as part of a statewide project to evaluate the fish Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) for Minnesota lakes.  <br> \n <br> \nBackpack electrofishing was completed at all 14 stations, but one site was sampled from the boat due to unstable footing.  A 50-foot seine was used to sample 1 station, a 15-foot seine was used at 8 stations, and site conditions prevented the use of seines at 5 sites.  Nearshore sampling captured two intolerant fish species; Iowa darter, and rock bass.  <br> \n <br> \nEsquagamah Lake has been previously defined as a lake class 27 based on the Schupp lake classification used by MnDNR; however, classification for this lake was less clear than most, and alternatively it may more resemble a class 29 or 31 lake.  This is important when evaluating the IBI data.  If it is recognized as class 27, then it falls within Group 2 lakes for evaluating IBI data.  If it is recognized as class 29 or 31, then it falls into Group 4 lakes.  IBI scoring will be determinant upon the classification and will be available at a later time.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Esquagamah Lake is located 10 miles west of Palisade and is a popular destination for many anglers in western Aitkin County. There is a state owned public access with concrete log ramp located just off of Aitkin County Road 3. The lake supports a wide variety of habitats that are conducive to several species of game fish. There are a several offshore beds of submerged and emergent vegetation that provide excellent habitat for fish and wildlife. Anglers can expect to find fishable populations of Walleye, Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, Black Crappie, and sunfish.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye catch (4.1/gill net) was essentially unchanged from the last survey conducted in 2014. Sizes ranged from 7 to 25\", with an average length of approximately 15\". The Walleye fishery is supported by fingerling stocking and this strategy appears to be supporting a healthy Walleye population. No natural reproduction of Walleye was evident.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike numbers have decreased in every survey since 1986, and were down to 1.4/gill net in 2019. Size structure is healthy as indicated by an average length of 23.4\", with 41% longer than 24\" and individuals up to 33\" sampled. Catch and release of pike over 24\" is encouraged to maintain a favorable size structure for this lake.  <br> \n <br> \nEsquagamah Lake is known for its high abundance of Black Crappie, and catches have varied from 10 to 83/net in survey history. The 2019 catch of 19.2/net was a decrease from a high catch in 2014 and falls below the long term average of 37.8. It's not uncommon for crappie lakes to fluctuate widely in abundance based on year class strengths. The average size of the crappies was about 7\" with about 13% longer than 9\". Anglers targeting Black Crappie can find success both in summer and winter months.  <br> \n <br> \nThe Bluegill population has varied little over the history of surveys on Esquagamah Lake. Abundance, growth rates, and size structure of the population are all favorable compared to other lakes in the area. Anglers are encouraged to exercise selective harvest, and release the larger individuals, to maintain these quality opportunities. History has shown it is difficult, if not impossible, to regain these attributes once they are lost. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass trap net and gill net catches were both within the expected range for this type of lake. Spring electrofishing, which is a better tool for monitoring bass populations, was done in 2019 as well. The catch rate indicates a fairly abundant population (61.9/hr) with an average size of 13.7 inches and a maximum size of 19.5 inches. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Esquagamah Lake, located 10 miles west of Palisade, is a popular destination for many anglers in western Aitkin County.  Esquagamah has a variety of habitats that support a wide variety of game fish.  Anglers can fish shallow weedy bays with their thick beds of lily pads and coontail or those large expanses of hardstem bulrush that harbor good populations of bluegill and largemouth bass.  The bluegill population has a strong year class of fish that are about six inches long, but the knowledgeable angler can still find some individuals that are of memorable size.  Anglers can move out to the off shore beds of submerged vegetation and find some good fishing for northern pike and black crappie. Northern pike, while not plentiful, come in a wide range of sizes including some trophy sized individuals. The abundant black crappie population provides good angling for both summer and winter anglers.  Esquagamah has never been noted for having large black crappie like several neighboring lakes, but if what you are looking for is a lake where you can catch enough fish to take home for a meal, Esquagamah is an excellent choice.Offshore structure provides some excellent walleye fishing.  Walleye were introduced in 1987, and while their abundance is average for this lake type, a wide range of sizes are available from 10 inches up to some owall hangerso.  The average walleye sampled was a respectable 17 inches. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Esquagamah Lake is located 10 miles west of Palisade and is a popular destination for many anglers in western Aitkin County.  There is a state owned public access with concrete log ramp located just off of Aitkin County Road 3.  The lake supports a wide variety of habitats that are conducive to several species of game fish.  There are a several offshore beds of submerged and emergent vegetation that provide excellent habitat for fish and wildlife.  Anglers can expect to find fishable populations of walleye, northern pike, largemouth bass, black crappie, and sunfish.   <br> \n <br> \nWalleye catch (4.0/gill net) was lower than the last assessment conducted in 2009 (7.3/gill net).  Sizes ranged from 9 to 27\" with an average length approaching 15\".  The walleye fishery is supported by fingerling stocking and this strategy appears to be supporting a healthy walleye population.  No natural reproduction of walleye was evident.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike numbers have decreased in every survey since 1986, and were down to 1.5/gill net in 2014.  Size structure is healthy with an average length of 26.2\", 60% were longer than 24\", and individuals up to about 33\".  Catch and release of pike over 24\" is encouraged to maintain a favorable size structure for this lake.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie numbers have increased since the late 1990's and 2000's and are well above average in abundance for this type of lake.  The average size of the crappies was about 7\" with a very small percentage (1%) longer than 9\".  Anglers targeting black crappie can find success both in summer and winter months.   <br> \n <br> \nThe bluegill population has varied little over the history of surveys on Esquagamah Lake. Abundance, growth rates, and size structure of the population are all favorable compared to other lakes in the area.  Anglers are encouraged to exercise selective harvest, and release the larger individuals, to maintain these quality opportunities.  History has shown it is difficult, if not impossible, to regain these attributes once they are lost. <br> \n <br> \nFew largemouth bass were caught in 2014, with tradition survey gear, although the largest fish was over 18\".  A spring electrofishing survey targeting largemouth bass was not conducted in 2014, however a survey conducted in 2009 found good numbers of bass in a wide variety of sizes.  <br> \n</p>",

Bowfin, White Sucker, Yellow Bullhead, Brown Bullhead, Pumpkinseed, Bluegill, Largemouth Bass and Yellow Perch are between the first and third regional quartiles Rock Bass are below the first regional quartile. Catch indices for Brown Bullhead and Black Crappie are above the area third quartile while the catch rate for Rock Bass is below the areas first quartile, Bowfin Northern Pike, White Sucker, Yellow Bullhead, Pumpkinseed, Bluegill, Largemouth Bass, and Yellow Perch are between the first and third area quartiles. Northern Pike ranged from two to seven years of age. Fifty five percent of the fish aged were three and four years old and could be from a stocking in 1984. Growth, the first, third and fourth increments are normal. The growth increments, the second and fifth years are twenty five and twenty six percent slower than normal respectively. Pumpkinseed ranged from three to six years of age. Forty seven percent of the sample aged were three years old and thirty three percent were four years old. The growth increments for ages one through six were all normal. Bluegill ranged from one to five years of age. Thirty eight percent of the sample aged were two years old. Ages three and five each made up twenty one percent of the sample aged. Growth for the first increment is fifty three percent faster than normal with the increments for ages two through five being normal. Black Crappie ranged from two to five years of age. Thirty four percent of the sample was age three and thirty six percent age four. Twenty percent of the sample aged was age two. Growth through the first increment is twenty nine percent faster than normal with growth for the second through fourth increments being sixteen percent, forty percent and twenty seven percent slower than normal respectively. Black Crappie of all ages showed slow growth for 1985. The growth increments for the same age fish in different years compare as follows:  second, down thirty percent; third, down seventeen percent; fourth, down nine percent. Northern Pike showed a significant increase in abundance from 1.77 per gillnet in 1980 to 7.0 per gillnet in 1986. The range of length has in- creased since 1980. In 1980 the largest Northern Pike sampled was twenty five inches long while in 1986 the largest Northern Pike was thirty six inches. With 9.4 percent of the sample being greater than twenty six inches. The mean length of Northern Pike less than twenty five inches sampled in 1980 was 19.7 inches while in 1986 it was 19.8 inches. Pumpkinseed showed a significant decrease in abundance from 1980 to 1986. The range of lengths sampled increased in 1986 with thirty percent of the fish being greater than 6.9 inches while in 1980 none of the Pumpkinseeds sampled were greater than 6.9 in. The mean length increased from 5.6 inches in 1980 to 6.4 inches in 1986. Within the range of length of Pumpkinseeds in 1986 would be 6.0 inches. This increase in mean length can be seen in the fact that in 1980 twenty three percent of the sample were 5.0 to 5.4 inches long while in 1986 there were no fish sampled in that length group. Bluegill abundance decreased from 19.5 per trap net in 1980 to 10.5 per trap net in 1986. The range of lengths sampled has not changed since 1980 but the mean length has increased from 5.4 in in 1980 to 6.4 inches in 1986. The increase in mean length is a result of an increase in fish greater than 6.9 in. In 1980 only one percent of the sample was greater than 6.9 inches while in the 1986 sample forty five percent of the fish were greater than 6.9 inches. The length frequency less than 6.9 inches is virtually the same, with a mean length of 5.5 inches, for both samples black crappie abundance has not changed since 1980. The length frequency table shows no significant change in length groups present in the sampled. The mean length of the samples however did increase from 6.6 inches in 1980 to 7.4 inches in 1986. This increase in mean length can be seen in the shift in the samples of fish from 6.0 - 6.9 inches in 1980 to 7.5 to 8.4 inches in 1986. The abundance of yellow perch in gillnets has apparently stabilized since 1980 at approximately 6.5 per lift. This is after an apparent significant decrease in abundance from previous surveys in 1949 and 1970. The range of length frequencies and the mean length have not changed significantly since 1980.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>The Section of Fisheries currently groups lakes in Minnesota into 43 different lake classes. Esquagamah Lake is one of the lake class 27 lakes, which typically are moderate in size and water clarity, have comparatively simple shapes, and have relatively hard water. Net catches may be compared to catches in previous surveys in this lake and to catches from similar lakes. Several species have fluctuated in abundance across the survey periods yet are currently abundant enough to provide good fishing. Anglers on Esquagamah Lake can target several species of fish, including walleyes, northern pike, bluegills and black crappies.    An average number of walleyes were caught in the gill nets in this survey.  Walleyes varied in size, ranging from 7.8 to 24.7 inches long. The fish averaged 15.3 inches and 1.5 pounds in the gill nets. Age analysis of walleye bony structures indicates that all of the walleyes came from stocked year classes and that each stocking has been successful. Fingerling stocking was initiated in 1987.    Black crappies are still abundant and small, despite a drop in abundance in the gill nets from the previous survey. Recruitment, or production of new fish, is relatively consistent. Black crappies averaged 7.1 inches in this survey and over a third of the fish were between 6.5 and 7.5 inches long. Growth is still somewhat slow, however any further drop in abundance may lead to increased growth and subsequently to larger crappies in a couple of years.    The bluegill catch was normal for this lake type but down slightly from the previous survey. Angling catch may be less than in 1992 but the fishing should remain satisfactory. Bluegills continue to grow well, the fish averaged a respectable 5.9 inches long and ranged up to 9.6 inches long.    Northern pike catches were near the low end of normal in this survey. The fish were mostly less than 24 inches long and less than 5 years old. Two 36 inch or larger northern pike were caught in the trap nets. Recruitment, though relatively consistent, is generally low. Lack of larger northern pike in the gill nets may indicate low recruitment from 5 to 10 years ago, short-term changes in northern pike activity patterns, or high angler harvest of larger pike. Northern pike growth is normal, probably because northern pike can prey on a broad range of fishes in the lake, including black crappies, white suckers, small walleyes and yellow perch.    The yellow perch population is currently lower than normal and growth is also slow. Only one strong year class is evident. The perch are too small to appeal to anglers.    The largemouth bass were not adequately sampled in this survey, presumably because bass are difficult to sample with fisheries gill nets and trap nets.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Esquagamah Lake is located 10 miles west of Palisade and is a popular destination for many anglers in western Aitkin County.  The public access is located just off of County Road 3.  Esquagamah Lake supports a wide variety of habitats that are conducive to several species of game fish.  The lake has a mean depth of 13 feet and a maximum of 31 feet found in the northwest bay of the lake.  There are a several offshore beds of submergent and emergent vegetation that provide excellent habitat for fish as well as good places for anglers to target them. Anglers on Esquagamah can expect to find fishable populations of walleye, northern pike, largemouth bass, black crappie and sunfish.   <br> \n <br> \nThe walleye catch rate from the 2009 netting showed improvement from last survey and was at 7.3 per net with an average size of nearly 16 inches.  Walleye fingerlings are stocked in alternating years and this strategy appears to be supporting a healthy walleye population.  No natural reproduction of walleye appears to be evident.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike numbers have decreased in every survey since 1986 and in 2009 were just shy of 2 per net with an average length of 23 inches.  Thirty-six percent of northern pike in the survey were 26 inches or longer with individuals out to around 31 inches.  Catch and release of pike over 24 inches is encouraged to maintain a favorable size structure for this lake.   <br> \n <br> \nBass appear to be increasing in abundance in Esquagamah Lake. A spring electrofishing survey targeting largemouth bass was conducted in 2009 and a good number of bass were caught in a wide variety of sizes. The average length was 14.2 inches, and the largest over 18 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nAlthough black crappie numbers have decreased substantially since the late 1980's and early 1990's, but they are still well above average in abundance for this type of lake.  This decrease in density appears to have resulted in a better size distribution.  In 2009, 33 of 155 crappie were over 9 inches, compared to only 6 of 359 crappie in the 1986 assessment. Anglers targeting black crappie can find success both in summer and winter months with fish averaging around 8 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nBluegill sunfish populations have varied little over the history of surveys on Esquagamah.  Abundance, growth rates, and size structure of their population are all very reasonable for the area.  Anglers are encouraged to exercise selective harvest, and release the very largest individuals to maintain these quality attributes.  <br> \n</p>",
