                "narrative": "<p>Mound Lake is a relatively small, scenic lake in southeast Todd County which supports a diverse fish community and offers many angling opportunities.  The lake has excellent water clarity with secchi disk reading of 18 feet in August which allows the growth of aquatic vegetation down to 20 feet.  The most common submerged plants, plants which grow primarily under the water surface, in Mound Lake were northern water milfoil and coontail which are both native to Minnesota.  For more indepth information, a vegetation report was conducted in June of 2005 and can be found at the DNR website under Lakefinder. \" Aquatic Vegetation of Mound Lake, Todd County by Donna Perleberg\".  Though only 273 acres in size, the lake offers a shoreline diversity ranging from heavy residential development on the south and east shores, to steep slopes covered by mixed hardwoods on the north shore, to quiet isolated bays good for watching wildlife.  Sand was the most common shallow water bottom type found around the lake.      There appeared to be several changes to the fish communtity since the last survey in 1999.  Northern pike numbers showed a decrease as did black crappie abundance.  With the decrease in pike numbers, size structure of the population appears to have improved.  More northern pike over 24 inches were observed in the summer catch and some trophy size fish near 40 inches have been netted in other DNR assessments on the lake.  Harvest of the smaller pike is encouraged to maintain a healthy pike population of fast growing individuals by reducing competition for food.    Mound Lake had been known for it's quality black crappie population but numbers appear to have seriously declined since the last survey with no crappies being netted in the summer survey and far fewer in the spring assesment.  Local residents reported a good crappie bite in the winter of 2004 - 05 which may negatively affected the population.  While there are still some of the quality crappies left, the numbers were down from previous surveys.  Crappie growth has been excellent but it will take some time for the population to rebound as few young crappies were observed.    Both largemouth and smallmouth bass are present in Mound Lake with the largemouth being the more abundant species.  Average size of the largemouth bass was between 12 to 13 inches but bass up to 18 inches were netted in the spring and fish up to 20 inches have been observed in past assessments.  The smallmouth bass that have been caught were between 15 and 19 inches.  The species was first documented in the lake in 2003 and abundance appears to be increasing.    Walleye abundance appears to be normal when compared to similar type lakes but local residents report catching few.  Average length seen in the lake survey was about 19 inches but fish up to 29 inches have been observed as well as ones down to 13 inches.  Walleye fingerlings are stocked in the lake in even numbered years which seems to be sustaining the population.  With the clear water, anglers may have more luck fishing at night.    Yellow perch numbers continue to be low which may have been a contributing factor in the decrease in northern pike numbers.  An abundant perch population is desirable as it may increase survival of walleye fingerlings and promote fast growth rates for both northern pike and walleye.  If anglers are not harvesting perch for a meal, releasing the fish immediately back into the water is encouraged.  It is hoped that the perch population may rebound if the northern pike numbers continue to stay down for a period of time.    Bluegill abundance is hard to discern from the lake survey as the gear type used was not meant for panfish.  An earlier spring netting did show some quality size fish up to 9 inches but average size was about 6 inches.  Other species sampled during the survey included rock bass, hybrid sunfish, pumpkinseed, brown bullheads, and yellow bullheads.  Some very nice size bullheads over 11 inches of both species were observed.  Bowfin, white sucker, golden shiners, and green sunfish are also known to be present in the lake as they were netted in the spring assessment.    Neascus or black spot was common on many of the northern pike, walleye, yellow perch, and rock bass.  Neascus is a trematode or parasite that is usually found in the skin of the fish.  The life cycle of the parasite includes snails and fish-eating birds, such as herons and bitterns.  Skinning the fish removes most of the parasites and cooking will kill the rest.  Humans cannot be infested.    Proper land use practices are encouraged in the watershed and by lakeshore owners to protect and maintain the good water quality and fish habitat in Mound Lake.  Protecting fish habitat is important to help sustain the quality and balance of the fish communtity.

A total of 179 crappies were sampled in 1.9 hours for a catch rate of 95.2 fish/hour. Measured crappies ranged from 4.5-13.8 inches, the mean length was 8.7 inches. Twenty-eight percent of the sample exceeded 10 inches and five percent exceeded 12 inches. These proportions are less than past averages however, length frequency data indicate multiple strong year classes that are likely to provide quality fishing in the near future.  </p>",

YELLOW PERCH seem to be abundant in the small sizes, but almost rare in the larger sizes (probably due to the high population of small northern pike.)  WALLEYE there appears to be some natural reproduction on the north shore.  There seems to have been a good 1979 year class and no stocking took place that year.

                "narrative": "<p>Mound Lake is a 269 acre bass/panfish lake located near Burtrum, MN.  Daytime electrofishing was performed on May 29 and June 3, 2020 to provide additional pre-regulation data for the 5 fish bag limit on Black Crappie which was implemented on March 1, 2020.  The goal of the reduced bag limit is to improve the Black Crappie size structure.  Mound Lake has a history of producing large crappies in the 14-15 inch range which is relatively uncommon for smaller lakes in central Minnesota.  Angling pressure on crappie in the lake appears to have increased in recent years, especially during the spring.  Access based vehicle counters have documented this heavy pressure.  Spring trap netting was used for evaluating the crappie population until 2015 when spring electrofishing was initiated as an assessment tool.  The 2020 spring sampling occurred over the course of two days straddling the pre-spawn and spawning periods.  Future evaluations relating to the 5 crappie bag limit may incorporate a combination of trap netting and electrofishing depending upon the results obtained.  <br> \n  <br> \nSpring Electrofishing appeared to be moderately efficient in terms of numbers of crappie sampled with 213 fish captured in under 1.5 hours of on-time.   Black Crappie appeared to be in primarily a pre-spawn stage during the May 29 sampling and most were located in relatively deep water.  There was more evidence of active spawning during the June 3 effort. Spring electrofished crappie ranged from 6.4 - 13.3 inches in length with 79% of the fish in the 8.0-9.9 inch range.  Only 2.3% of the fish exceeded 12 inches and average size was 9.26 inches.  Fish over 10 inches comprised 16% of the catch in 2020.  Past spring electrofishing assessments produced similar catches in terms of numbers, however more desirable size structures were evident.  The percentage of crappie over 10 inches was 62% in 2015, 58% in 2017 and 30% in 2018.  Proportions of fish greater than 12 inches ranged from 5.2-6.4% during these same assessments.  Crappies greater than 13 inches continue to be present though fish in excess of 14 inches have not been observed since 2011. <br> \n <br> \nPrevious spring trap net surveys were conducted in 1995, 1997, 1999, 2001, 2003, 2005, 2008 and 2011.  Trap nets have provided variable sample sizes ranging from 57 to 361 fish, likely due to variations in timing and effort expended.  Crappies over 15 inches were captured during the 2003 and 2005 spring trap net assessments. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>The current fish community structure of Mound Lake exhibits many desirablecharacteristics.  The northern pike population has stabilized at a low levelallowing for a significant increase in the gillnet catch of yellow perch.  Thispositive response in the forage base should be beneficial to predator fishpopulations.  The size structure of the northern pike population continues toimprove as population density remains low.  In 1993 over 60% of the northern pikegillnet catch exceeded 21 inches.  The walleye gillnet catch fell from 10.5/set in1988 to 4.5/set in 1993, however the population is within the normal range for lakeclass 25.  Mound Lake does have good winter fishing for walleye at times.  Thepopulation seems to be maintained by stocking even though the lake does have arocky north shore.  Largemouth bass populations are difficult to assess usingstandard lake survey gear, but the high gillnet catch (7.33/set) noted in the 1993may indicate a large population.  Electrofishing assessment will be required toaccurately characterize the largemouth bass population.  Black crappie trapnetcatches were low but within the normal range for lake class 25.  Growth rates ofblack crappie are excellent and large fish (12-16 inches) are commonly reported byanglers.  The bluegill trapnet catch also fell within the normal range and wasdominated by small, slow growing individuals.  A continued increase in the perchpopulation may help to limit bluegill recruitment leading to and improvement inbluegill growth rates.  Mound Lake has not had much development since the 1983survey.  The central north shore is steep terrain and presently undeveloped by thetwo landowners.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Mound Lake is a relatively small, scenic lake in southeast Todd County which supports a diverse fish community and offers many angling opportunities.  The lake has good water clarity with a secchi disk reading of 13.5 feet in August.  Though only 273 acres in size, the lake offers shoreline diversity ranging from  heavy residential development on the south shore, to steep slopes covered by mixed hardwoods on the north shore, to quiet isolated bays good for watching wildlife.   Fishing structures include drop-offs, weedlines, bays, points, an island, and sunken bars.  Purple loosestrife was found on the north shore of the lake and monitoring will occur to see if it spreads.     Several of the fish populations showed dramatic changes since the 1993 survey, one of which was northern pike.  Northern pike numbers have increased and are above the desired level for the lake.  Most of the pike anglers can expect to see will be less than 20 inches in length, however some trophy size pike near 40 inches were observed in DNR nets.  Harvest of the smaller pike is encouraged to maintain a healthy pike population of fast growing individuals by reducing competition for food.       Walleye numbers were normal when compared to similar lakes.  The fish observed in the summer survey ranged in size from 10 to 25 inches with most of fish from 18 to 20 inches in length.  Being a clear water lake, walleye fishing may be more successful at night.  Winter fishing for walleye has been good at times.  Although walleye fingerlings are stocked in the lake in even years, natural reproduction also contributes to the population.  Abundant pike numbers can decrease survival of walleye fingerlings and juveniles.     Mound Lake has a good largemouth bass population in both size and numbers.   While most of the bass were from 8 to 10 inches, some trophy size fish have been documented.  Growth rates appeared normal until age 4 and slow thereafter.  Releasing the larger bass is encouraged to help maintain a quality fishery for the future.     A species of special concern in Mound Lake are yellow perch.   The population has decreased since 1993 which may be a result of the increase in northern pike numbers.  An abundant perch  population is desired as it may increase survival of walleye fingerlings and promotes fast growth rates in northern pike and walleye.  If anglers are not harvesting perch for a meal, releasing the fish immediately back into the lake is encouraged.     Black crappies provide a popular spring and winter fishery in Mound Lake.  An early ice-out assessment conducted in 1999 displayed an excellent size structure in the crappie population.  Fish exceeding 10 inches in length were common with some individuals measuring up to 13.5 inches.  Crappies in Mound Lake displayed fast growth and attain \"keeper\" size or 9 inches in about 3 years.       The bluegill population appears to be dominated by small fish.  Fish just over 7 inches were measured in the summer survey, but the majority were less than 6 inches in length.  Other sunfish species in the lake include pumpkinseeds and hybrid sunfish.  All the pumpkinseeds and hybrid sunfish observed were less than 7.5 inches in length.  Mound Lake appears to have an abundant rock bass population.  Some of the rock bass measured almost 11 inches.     Other species sampled during the survey included black, brown, and yellow bullheads, and bowfin or dogfish.  Large bullheads up to 14 inches were found in both the brown and yellow bullhead populations.  White suckers are known to be in the lake from spring assessments.     Neascus or black spot was common on many of the fish species in Mound Lake.  Neascus is a trematode or parasite that is usually found in the skin of the fish.  The life cycle of the parasite also includes snails and fish-eating birds, such as herons and bitterns.  Skinning the fish removes most of theparasites and cooking will kill the rest.  Humans cannot be infested.     Proper land use practices are encouraged in the watershed and by lakeshore owners to protect and maintain good water quality and fish habitat in Mound Lake.  Protecting fish habitat is important to help sustain the quality and balance of the fish community.            </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>     Mound Lake is a relatively small, scenic lake in southeast Todd County which supports a diverse fish community and offers many angling opportunities. The lake has excellent water clarity with a secchi disk reading of 23 feet in August.  Black Crappie are the primary management species for Mound Lake and the lake has a reputation of producing quality size fish.   Angler reports suggest finding the large crappie in Mound Lake can be a real challenge. Walleye abundance appears normal when compared to similar type lakes and the population is sustained through stocking along with some natural reproduction. Most of the Walleye caught in the summer survey were less than 12 inches in length although fish up to 30 inches have been documented in previous surveys.  With the clear water, anglers may want to target Walleye at night.  <br> \n       Northern Pike numbers are at the management goal and within the normal range when compared to similar type lakes. The population appears to be dominated by small fish as most of the pike caught averaged 1.8 pounds or 20 inches.   Mound Lake supports an abundant Largemouth Bass population that is also dominated by small fish. Most of the Largemouth Bass observed in the various 2013 sampling techniques were less than 15 inches in length, but some quality size fish over 19 inches were observed. Smallmouth Bass are also present but numbers appear to be low.  <br> \n       The 2013 summer survey produced some of the lowest Bluegill catches for Mound Lake which may not be representative of the true population.  Bluegill average length in the summer survey was about 6 inches but some fish up to eight inches were observed. Other sunfish species such as Pumpkinseed, hybrid sunfish, Green Sunfish, and Rock Bass were also caught.  Yellow Perch numbers are presently lower than desired. Higher perch abundance is desirable as it may increase survival of young Walleye and promote good growth rates for both Northern Pike and Walleye.  It is hoped that the perch population may rebound if Northern Pike numbers continue to stay down for a period of time.  Some quality size Yellow Bullhead up to 13 inches were measured in the summer survey. <br> \n        Proper land use practices are encouraged in the watershed and by lakeshore owners to protect and maintain the good water quality and fish habitat in Mound Lake. Protecting fish habitat is important to help sustain the quality and balance of the fish community.  Anglers are encouraged to harvest the smaller Northern Pike under 24 inches and release the larger ones to help maintain a more balanced fish community. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Mound Lake (DOW# 77-0007-00; Lake Class 25) is a 269 acre lake located near Burtrum, Minnesota. A Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MNDNR) owned concrete boat ramp is located on the southwest shore. Mound Lake has 5.21 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 57 feet. Lake is in Lake Class 25; lakes in this class are generally deep, have hard water, clear, and are an irregular shape. <br> \n <br> \nMound Lake is one of the top Black Crappie lakes in the Little Falls area. In addition to good numbers of crappie, fish up to 13 inches were found. Many \"eater\" sized crappie were also seen with many between 9-11 inches. Mound Lake has also been historically one of the better small Walleye lakes in the Little Falls area. While numbers were down in the last survey, anglers should still have some success on Walleye of all sizes. Anglers may also find some decent sized Largemouth Bass and Northern Pike. Bass up to 18 inches and pike up to 30 inches were seen in the last survey.  <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species that anglers can expect to encounter include Bluegill, Brown Bullhead, Golden Shiner, Hybrid Sunfish, Pumpkinseed Sunfish, Rock Bass, Smallmouth Bass, Yellow Bullhead, and Yellow Perch. <br> \n <br> \nPeople can have significant impacts on lakes and the fish populations they support. Fish harvest, lakeshore development, removal of shoreline vegetation, and introductions of aquatic invasive species (AIS) can all adversely affect fish populations. Curly Leaf Pondweed has been identified in Mound Lake. AIS can be moved from infested to non-infested waters by anglers, boaters, and lake shore owners and can adversely impact lakes and fish populations. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access. If you suspect an infestation of an invasive species in this lake, save a specimen and report it to a local natural resource office. Additional information on all of these topics can be found on the DNR website (www.dnr.state.mn.us) or by contacting the Little Falls Area Fisheries office. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>    Spring night electrofishing has been conducted on Mound Lake in even numbered years since 1994 to assess the largemouth bass population.  Mound Lake is a largemouth bass and black crappie reference lake for the statewide experimental regulation project.  The effort in 2006 netted 97 largemouth bass for a catch rate of 75.6/hour on-time which was down from the record high catch of 142/hour in 2004.  All of the electrofishing efforts on Mound Lake have typically produced catch rates above the Area Mean of 48.2/hour.  Other night electrofishing efforts have produced catches ranging from 70 to 128 bass per hour. <br> \n    Bass in the 2006 electrofishing sampling measured from 6 to 16 inches  with a modal length of 12 - 13 inches, average length of 11.2 inches, and a PSD of 53.  The modal length was similar to that seen in 4 of the previous 6 electrofishing effort with the remaining two being below that.  The average length has shown little variation between assessments, staying between 10.7 and 11.7 inches.  The PSD has ranged from 28 to 64 in the previous assessments for an average of 49.    Ages 2 - 8 were represented in the 2006 spring electrofishing catch with all of the age groups displaying normal growth when compared to an Area Mean Back-calculated Length Table.  Year class strengths suggest good consistent recruitment. <br> \n    All of the previous surveys sampled largemouth bass over 17 inches with the most (n=4) being caught in 1998.  Some bass up to 20 inches have been documented in the assessments.   The 2004 assessment sampled a smallmouth bass.  Spring electrofishing has proven to be a very effective method for sampling largemouth bass in Mound Lake and will be used in conjunction with lake surveys as the reference lake status has been completed.  Management goals for the lake are to maintain catch rates at over 60 bass per hour with a PSD of 40 - 60.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A standard survey using six gill nets and nine trap nets was completed the week of August 7, 2023. This survey is part of regular, long-term assessment netting conducted on Mound Lake every six years. Standardized water quality measurements were also completed. The latest data show adequate dissolved oxygen to support fish down to a depth of 32 feet; the water clarity reading was 23.5 feet. The fishery in 2023 can be summarized as having low Walleye abundance, average pike abundance, and very few Yellow Perch. Bluegill were captured in low to moderate numbers and there were no crappies caught in trap nets. The gill net catch suggests crappie remain abundant in the lake and some large fish are present. Sampling during the spring will yield more accurate information and is scheduled for 2024. Electrofishing was not completed during this survey but past electrofishing is extensive and indicated a healthy Largemouth Bass fishery exists. <br> \n <br> \nMound Lake is primarily managed for Black Crappie and secondarily for Walleye, Northern Pike, and Largemouth Bass. A 5 fish bag limit for crappie was enacted in 2020 as quality within the crappie population showed a decline. Spring trap netting and electrofishing in 2024 will provide updated information regarding this parameter. Largemouth Bass size structure may be lower than the management goal based on 2017 data however more electrofishing in 2024 is warranted to better determine population size structure. Improved Walleye catch rates are needed to meet goals while pike abundance is within management goals.   <br> \n <br> \nNetted Walleyes in Mound Lake typically range from 15-24 inches with the average around 18 inches. The catch rate has been lower the last two surveys than the long-term average (1983-2011). Stocking over the years has had mixed results. Prior to 2006, fingerlings stocked resulted in good returns as adults 2-4 years later. For the past 15 years, this hasn't been the case, despite heavier average loads of fingerlings being stocked. Future management strategies are currently being discussed.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike abundance in Mound Lake has been moderate and not at a level that negatively impacts other game or prey fish species. Gill netting catch rates dating back to 1983 average less than 6 fish/gill net which is on par with other lakes similar in character. Most of the pike sampled were between 14 and 21 inches. Four percent of the sample measured greater than 24 inches. The management goal aims to maintain abundance at less than 8.5 fish/gill net with 35% exceeding 24 inches.    <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>     Mound Lake is a relatively small, scenic lake in southeast Todd County which supports a diverse fish community and offers many angling opportunities.  The lake has excellent water clarity with a secchi disk reading of 14 feet in August.  Black crappie are the primary management species for Mound Lake and the lake has a reputation of producing quality size fish.  Crappie are abundant and grow fast with fish over ten inches being common in a 2011 spring assessment and fish from 13 to 15 inches are often sampled.   Angler reports suggest finding the large crappie in Mound Lake is a real challenge.  Walleye abundance appears normal when compared to similar type lakes and the population is sustained through stocking along with some natural reproduction.  Most of the walleye caught in the summer survey were more than 17 inches in length with some up to 30 inches observed.  With the good water clarity, anglers will likely have to target walleye at night.  Northern pike numbers are at the management goal and within the normal range compared to similar type lakes.  The population appears to be dominated by small fish as most of the pike caught were between 20 and 22 inches or about two pounds.  Mound Lake supports an abundant largemouth bass population that is also dominated by small fish.  Most of the largemouth bass observed in the various 2011 sampling techniques were less than 15 inches in length, but some quality size fish over 18 inches were observed.  Smallmouth bass are also present but numbers appear to be low.  Although the summer bluegill catch was not that high, the  2011 spring assessment caught almost 800 fish.  Bluegill between six and seven inches were common in the spring assessment with some quality fish up to eight inches observed.  Yellow perch numbers are presently lower than desired.  Higher perch abundance is desirable as it may increase survival of young walleye and promote good growth rates for both northern pike and walleye.  It is hoped that perch population may rebound if northern pike numbers continue to stay down for a period of time.  Both brown and yellow bullheads were caught in the various 2011 assessments.  Yellow bullhead are the more abundant of the two species.  Yellow bullhead over ten inches in length were common in the summer assessment with some up to 13 inches measured. <br> \n     Proper land use practices are encouraged in the watershed and by lakeshore owners to protect and maintain the good water quality and fish habitat in Mound Lake.  Protecting fish habitat is important to help sustain the quality and balance of the fish community.  Anglers are encouraged to harvest the smaller northern pike under 24 inches and release the larger ones to help maintain a more balanced fish community. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>    Spring trapnet assessments have been conducted periodically on Mound Lake since 1995 to assess changes in the black crappie population.  The lake was used as a reference lake for the evaluation of black crappie and largemouth bass experimental regulations in the past.  The black crappie netting was effective as 304 (15.2/set) were caught over the three day assessment period.  It was the second highest catch rate for crappie after the 1995 rate of 18/trapnet. The last crappie assessment in 2005 produced a catch rate of only 1/trapnet despite much effort.  Only 60 black crappie were netted in 2003, but the netting period was much shorter, producing a catch rate of 4/trapnet.  The 2008 sample size was similar to those recorded in the first three assessments, 1995, 1997, 1999, where larger catches were recorded, (n=361, 234, and 328, respectively). <br> \n    The black crappie in the 2008 assessment ranged from 5.6 to 13.4 inches in length with a mean length of 10 inches.  As is common with the larger sample sizes, a larger portion of the catch was comprised of smaller fish.  Those crappie exceeding 10 inches made up 44% (n=136) of the sample with 2% (n=7) of the crappie more than 12 inches in length.  Assessments in 2003 and 2005 provided smaller samples of 60 and 57 fish, respectively.  Crappie over 10 inches accounted for over 90% of the catches in 2003 and 2005, while fish over 12 inches made up 90% of the sample in 2003 and 68% in 2005.  The lake management goal for Mound Lake is to have at least 40% of the spring black crappie catch exceed 10 inches in length and at least 10% exceed 12 inches.  Ages 2 thru 5 were represented in the 2008 spring assessment with all of the age groups displaying fast growth when compared to an Area Mean Back-calculated Length Table.  Mound Lake has historically had some of the faster black crappie growth rates in the Little Falls Area. <br> \n     The 2008 assessment produced the second lowest bluegill catch (n=273) in the spring crappie assessments after the 2003 catch of 219 bluegill.  The average catch in the other assessments was approximately 656 bluegill.  Only twenty-six of the bluegill in the 2008 assessment were measured and they ranged from 4 to 8.3 inches in length.  Most of the unmeasured bluegill were less than 5 inches in length.  The number of smaller fish may have been related to the timing of the assessment.   <br> \n      The 2008 catches were lowest recorded for both northern pike and walleye in spring crappie assessments.  Only four northern pike and six walleye were caught which was likely due to the late spring and spawning having been completed.  The pike measured from 23 to 30.5 inches and the walleye between 19 and 28 inches.  The largemouth bass catch (n=33), however, was above average when compared to the previous assessments.  The fish measured from 9 to 18 inches in length with am mean length of 14 inches and modal length was 14 - 15 inches. <br> \n     Other fish species sampled and counted included bowfin, brown bullhead, golden shiner, green sunfish, hybrid sunfish, pumpkinseed sunfish, rock bass, white sucker, and yellow bullhead. <br> \n     The spring trapnet assessments are an effective method of sampling black crappie in Mound Lake as 5 of the 7 assessments have caught good numbers of crappie.  While the percent of crappie exceeding 12 inches in the 2008 assessment did not meet the management goal, the goal had been surpassed in the previous four assessments. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>     Mound Lake has a reputation of producing big crappie and the species provides an important fishery for the area.  The lake was used as a reference lake for the evaluation of black crappie and largemouth bass experimental regulations in the past.  Spring trap net assessments have been conducted periodically on Mound Lake since 1995 to assess changes in the black crappie population.  Scales were collected from the crappie for age and growth data during this assessment. <br> \n     Ten standard lake survey trap nets were set in 2011 over a four day period and lifted three times for a total of 30 lifts.  The trap nets caught 230 black crappie for a catch rate of 7.7/set.  The crappie ranged from 5.8 to 14.4 inches in length with an average length of 9.5 inches.  Smaller size crappie dominated the catch as only 40% (n=91) of the fish exceeded nine inches.  Crappie more than ten inches in length accounted for 30% (n=70) of the sample with 12% (n=27) exceeding 12 inches in length.  Three of the results from the 2011 spring assessment met the lake management goals for black crappies while one was below the desired outcome.   Desired goals include a trap net catch of six or more crappie per trap net lift along with at least 40% of the crappie over ten inches and 10% over 12 inches.  It is also desired to have at least five year classes represented in the spring trap net catch. <br> \n     A strong year class was evident in the 2011 crappie assessment where the 2008 year class accounted for 66% of the aged sample.  The strong year classes, 2008 and 2007 (22%) of younger fish were responsible for the low percentage of fish over ten inches.  Six year classes were represented in 2011 aged sample, Ages 2 through 6 and 8.  All of the age groups displayed fast growth when compared to an area mean back-calculated length table. <br> \n     Catch rates have varied in past spring crappie assessments from 1.3/trap net (n=56; 2005) to 18.1/trap net (n=361; 1995).  Strong year classes have been responsible for several of the high catch rates such as in 2008 when the 2005 year class accounted for 88% of the sample.  The crappie catch rate for that assessment was 15.2/trap net (n=304) but there were only 4 year classes represented.   Catches were also high in 1997 (n=234) and 1999 (n=328) with rates of 7.8/TN and 8.2/TN, respectively.  The 1994 year class accounted for 59% of the sample in 1997 and in 1999 there were two strong year classes from 1997 and 1996.  There were six year classes represented in 1997 and seven in 1999.  In 2005 and 2003, when catch rates were lower, 1.3/TN and 4/TN, respectively, more year classes were represented, nine in 2005 and seven in 2003.   <br> \n     The proportion of crappie that exceeded ten inches in length ranged from 9% (1997) to as much as 98% (2003) of the catches.  Ninety percent (n=54) of the 60 crappie caught in 2003 were more than 12 inches while in 1995 when the catch was 361 crappie, only 0.6% (n=2) of the fish were over 12 inches.  Six of the eight spring crappie assessments have had catches where over 40% of the fish have exceeded 10 inches.   Five of the assessments have had catches where more than 10% of the fish have been over 12 inches. <br> \n     Spring crappie assessments have also provided opportunities to evaluate other fish populations in the lake.  The 2011 bluegill catch was comparable to past spring catches in that most of the fish have been small.  Catches have ranged from 219 bluegill in 2003 to 1,022 in 2001.  All of the bluegill over seven inches (n=53 or 7%) were measured in 2011 while smaller bluegill were subsampled for measuring.   Modal length for the 2011 sample was 5.5 - 6 inches which was similar to the catches in 2005 and 1995 when 508 and 767 bluegill were caught, respectively.  Other bluegill catches have had modal lengths that ranged from 4 - 4.5 inches (1999) to 5 - 5.5 inches (2003 and 1997).  Most of the spring assessments have recorded few bluegill over seven inches.  The greatest proportion was 12% in the 2005 crappie assessment while most of the other assessments have had from 2 to 8% of the catch exceed seven inches. <br> \n     Spring trap nets have consistently been more effective at catching bluegill than the summer trap nets in Mound Lake.  The highest number caught in the summer trap nets was 157 fish in 1978.  Like in the spring assessments, few of the bluegill in the summer trap nets exceeded seven inches in length.  Gill nets in Mound Lake have sometimes caught some of the bigger individuals recorded for the lake. <br> \n     The 2011 largemouth bass catch of 56 was the second highest for a crappie assessment behind the 2005 catch of 60 bass.  The bass measured from 6.7 to 18.7 inches in length in 2011 with a mean length of 13.6 inches.  Largemouth bass up to 20 inches have been measured in previous spring crappie assessments.  A summer survey conducted in August of 2011 sampled 30 largemouth bass in the gill nets and 16 in the trap nets.  The catches, 5.2/GN and 1.8/TN, suggest an abundant population as both rates were above their respective 75% quartiles of 1.2/GN and 1.1/TN.  The average size bass in both gear types was much smaller, 10.8 inches in the gill nets and 7.8 inches in the trap nets.  <br> \n      The spring bass electrofishing also indicated an abundant largemouth bass population.  The 160 bass per hour catch rate was the highest to date for the lake.  The catch rate, however, might not be comparable to past results since the electrofishing was conducted during the day with a newer, more efficient electrofishing boat and two netters.    Mean size from the electrofishing sample was smaller, 9.7 inches, when compared to the spring assessment sample.   In previous electrofishing efforts conducted at night (n=7), the mean length has been higher, ranging from 10.7 to 11.7 inches. <br> \n     Walleye catches have been highly variable in the spring assessments, where catches have ranged from six to 103 walleye.  Eighteen walleye between 18.7 and 27.5 inches were caught in the 2011 spring assessment.  The 2011 summer survey caught 27 walleye between 11.3 and 29.6 inches.  The summer catch rate, 4.5/GN, was within the normal range for the lake class.  Mean length in the summer catch was shorter than the spring catch, 19.2 inches compared to 21.7 inches. <br> \n     Northern pike catches have also been highly variable in the spring assessments.  The highest catch was 289 pike in 1999 and the lowest 4 in 2008.  The 2011 catch of 11 pike was the second lowest of the eight spring assessments.  The pike in the 2011 spring assessment ranged from 8.8 to 32.7 inches and 16.7 to 29.6 inches in the 2011 summer assessment.  However, the 2011 spring assessment sample produced a shorter mean length, 19.7 inches, compared to 21.5 inches in the summer assessment.  Spring assessments in Mound Lake have typically sampled more pike over 30 inches than summer surveys with the largest northern pike being 37.5 inches in the 1999 spring assessment. <br> \n     Other fish species sampled in the 2011 spring assessment included bowfin, brown bullhead, golden shiner, green sunfish, hybrid sunfish, pumpkinseed, rock bass, white sucker, yellow bullhead, and yellow perch.   <br> \n     The spring assessments are an effective method of sampling black crappie in Mound Lake as six of the eight assessments have caught good numbers of crappie.  While the percent of crappie exceeding 10 inches in the 2011 assessment did not meet the management goal, that goal was surpassed in six of the previous assessments.   The lake continues to produce large black crappie and display good growth.</p>",
