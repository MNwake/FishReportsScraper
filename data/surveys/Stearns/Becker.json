Ten sampling sites were evenly spaced around the shoreline and each site was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining, except two sites where dense vegetation prevented seining. <br> \n <br> \nNear shore sampling captured 23 species of fish, including five species that are intolerant of poor water quality or habitat disturbance (Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, and Pugnose Shiner). The near shore fish survey data were combined with gill net and trap net data from an August 2018 standard survey to describe the fish community and provide a fish based Index of Biotic Integrity (FIBI) score based on expectations for similar lakes. An FIBI uses fish community data as a measurement of lake health. The FIBI score for Becker Lake was 93.8 which was well above the impairment threshold (FIBI > 36) using Tool 7. <br> \n <br> \nThis survey is contributing to a watershed assessment process in coordination with the MN Pollution Control Agency. Becker Lake is located in the Sauk River Watershed. <br> \n</p>",

The lake is relatively shallow but winterkill has been prevented with the use of an aeration system since about 1989.  Becker Lake was observed to be popular with anglers.  During this assessment 10-20 angling boats were observed on the lake each day.Northern pike were the most abundant predator taken in gill nets.  Northerns were captured at a rate of 17.0/gill net which was more than twice the third quartile value for lake class 42.  The fish averaged 20 inches in length and two pounds in weight.Walleye (3.5/gill net) and yellow perch (13.0/gill net) were both present at expected numbers.  Apparently some walleye migrate into Becker Lake from the Sauk River and the connecting lakes of the Horseshoe Chain since walleye have never been stocked in Becker Lake.Channel catfish appear to be increasing in abundance in Becker Lake as well as the connecting waters.  The gill net catch was just 2.0/lift but the average weight was 5.8 pounds.  One angler seeking panfish was observed to catch a large channel catfish during the assessment.The trap net catches of bluegill, black crappie and even yellow bullhead were on the \"low end\" of the expected range.  This might be because of the shallowness of the net sets and the extensive beds of submerged vegetation present.  Bluegill were caught at a rate of 4.3/trap net, ranged in size from 3.3 - 7.2 inches but averaged only 4.9 inches, 0.1 pound.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Becker Lake is located west of Richmond in Stearns County and is part of the Sauk River Chain of Lakes, formed by a dam in Cold Spring. Becker Lake has a surface area of 176 acres and a maximum depth of 20 feet. The watershed is large and primarily covered in row crops and pasture. The lake is not directly connected to the Sauk River and has better water quality and more aquatic vegetation than most lakes in the chain. Most of the lake is shallow and it has a history of winterkills. The previous lake survey was in 2003. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike are the primary management species and pike catches have been higher in Becker Lake than in other lakes in the chain. The 2013 catch was much higher than in 2003 and higher than expected for lakes similar to Becker Lake. Northern Pike ranged in length from 12.5 to 28.5 inches with an average length and weight of 19.5 inches and 1.7 pounds. Growth was average, reaching 19 20 inches at age three. Only seven percent of Northern Pike were longer than 24 inches <br> \n <br> \nWalleye are not stocked in Becker Lake, but can migrate from the Sauk River and a stocked population in nearby Horseshoe Lake. Only four Walleye were caught in the survey, ranging from 15 to 26 inches. Largemouth Bass were sampled by day time boat electrofishing in the spring and the catch rate was below the Montrose area average. Largemouth Bass ranged in length from 7.4 to 16.1 inches with an average length of 11.7 inches. Twenty five percent were longer than 15 inches. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie numbers were low, but similar to 2003 and within the range of expected values for similar lakes. Black Crappie lengths ranged from 4.3 to 10.8 inches with an average length and weight of 7.6 inches and 0.28 pounds. Growth was average; Black Crappie reached 8 inches at age 3. The Bluegill catch rate was within the range of expected values for similar lakes, but higher than previous surveys. Bluegill lengths ranged from 2.8 to 9.2 inches with an average length and weight of 5.4 inches and 0.16 pounds. Growth was fast; Bluegill reached 6.2 inches at age three. <br> \n <br> \nOnly four yellow perch were caught in 2013 and three in 2003, but previous catches have been much higher. High Northern Pike numbers have likely reduced Yellow Perch abundance. The Channel Catfish catch increased from 2003 to 2013, but was lower than other lakes in the chain. Other species caught included: Bowfin, Common Carp, Golden, Shorthead, and Silver Redhorse, Green, Hybrid, and Pumpkinseed Sunfish, Brown and Yellow Bullhead, and White Sucker. <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Becker Lake is located near Richmond, in south-central Stearns County.  This 176-acre lake is part of the Sauk River Chain of lakes, which was formed by the construction of a dam on the Sauk River at Cold Spring.  Becker Lake is more removed from the influence of the river than other lakes in the chain, and this is reflected in the greater water clarity and more abundant submersed plants.  A fisheries survey was conducted in 2003 on the entire Sauk River Chain.Becker Lake is managed primarily for northern pike, and appears to support a higher density of northern pike than the rest of the Sauk River chain.  Higher water clarity and the greater abundance of submerged plant growth likely aid in foraging, and the extensive  marshy area in the lake's northwest arm offer favorable spawning habitat.  The catch rate of northern pike in 2003 was down from 1995, but still above the median for lakes similar to Becker.  Mean weight increased to 3.2 pounds, and most of the individuals sampled were 21-25 inches.Walleye are not stocked in Becker Lake, but the direct connection to Horseshoe Lake and the Sauk River allow for migration.  The catch rate of walleye in 2003 was similar to what was found in the other lakes in the chain, and mean weight (1.8 pounds) was in the normal range.  No yellow perch were sampled by gill nets in 2003, a decrease from 1995.  This decline in catch was also seen in the other lakes in the Sauk River Chain, and may be related to higher densities of walleye than in the past.Largemouth bass were sampled by electrofishing at a rate roughly half the median catch rate for Montrose area lakes, but similar to the other lakes in the chain.  Most of the fish were 12-16 inches, and the largest was 18 inches.  Smallmouth bass were sampled on other lakes in the chain in 2003, but not on Becker Lake.The catch rate of bluegill in 2003 was near the average for lakes similar to Becker, and double the rate reported in 1995.  Mean weight (0.18 pounds) was within the expected range, and higher than in 1995 (0.11 pounds).  The catch rate of black crappie was low in 2003; mean weight (0.13 pounds) was also low.  These values are similar to the 1995 survey.In 2003, channel catfish did not appear as abundant in Becker Lake as the rest of the Sauk River chain.  Catfish were also sampled in 1990, 1995, but in low numbers.  During the same time period, catch rates of catfish increased in the rest of the chain, which may provide better catfish habitat.  Bullhead, carp, redhorse, and white sucker were also sampled during the 2003 survey.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Becker Lake is a 176 acre lake located near Richmond in Stearns County. It is part of the Sauk River Chain of Lakes, formed by a dam in Cold Spring. Becker Lake has a maximum depth of 20 feet and had a Secchi reading of 4.5 feet in mid-August. The watershed is large and the primary land uses are agriculture and pasture. A public access is located on the Sauk River just east of Becker Lake.  <br> \n <br> \nEmergent vegetation is common in the lake, predominantly waterlilies. Submergent vegetation is also abundant, but has not been surveyed recently. The lake has a history of winterkills and was last surveyed in 2013. Anglers can expect good fishing for Northern Pike and panfish. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike numbers have greatly increased since 2013 and were far above the expected range of values for lakes similar to Becker. Lengths ranged from 11.0 to 30.7 inches with an average length and weight of 19.6 inches and 1.8 pounds. Only four percent of Northern Pike were longer than 26 inches. <br> \n <br> \nBass electrofishing was not conducted due to rapidly increasing spring water temperatures. Only one Largemouth Bass was caught during summer netting. Largemouth Bass numbers in 2013 were below average. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye numbers were low compared to other lakes in the Sauk River Chain, but within the expected range of values for similar lakes and near the long term average for the lake. Walleye are not stocked in Becker Lake but can easily immigrate from nearby Horseshoe Lake and the Sauk River. Lengths ranged from 19.8 to 21.3 inches with an average length and weight of 20.2 inches and 2.8 pounds. <br> \n <br> \nThe Bluegill catch was much higher than 2013 and above the expected range of values for similar lakes. Lengths ranged from 3.2 to 8.2 inches with an average length of 5.6 inches. Only three percent of Bluegill were longer than eight inches. Black Crappie numbers were low and below the expected range of values. Historical catches have also been low. Lengths ranged from 7.4 to 10.8 inches with an average length of 9.1 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nFew Yellow Perch were captured in 2018, and catches in 2013 and 2003 were also low. However, historical catches have been much higher. High Northern Pike numbers have likely reduced Yellow Perch abundance.  <br> \n <br> \nThe Channel Catfish catch was higher than 2013 and reflects an abundant population in the rest of the chain of lakes. Catfish were large; lengths ranged from 3.5 to 25.6 inches with an average length and weight of 21.2 inches and 3.9 pounds. <br> \n <br> \nOther species captured in the survey included: Bowfin, Hybrid Sunfish, Pumpkinseed, Shorthead Redhorse, Silver Redhorse, White Sucker, and Yellow Bullhead. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Becker Lake is a 176-acre lake located near Richmond in Stearns County. It is part of the Sauk River Chain of Lakes (SRCL), formed by a dam in Cold Spring. Most of the lake is shallow and it has a maximum depth of 20 feet. The lake has a history of winterkill, and an aeration (bubbler type) system was installed in 1989 and effectively eliminated winterkill; however, the system was removed in 2010. The watershed is large and primary land uses are agriculture and pasture. The lake is not directly connected to the Sauk River and has better water quality and a more diverse aquatic plant community than most lakes within the chain. A public access is located on the Sauk River just east of Becker Lake. A targeted survey using only gill nets was conducted in 2021 to update fisheries data last collected in 2018. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers can expect good fishing for Northern Pike, Catfish, Walleye, and panfish. <br> \nNorthern Pike numbers have greatly decreased since 2018, but are still plentiful. The pike sampled ranged in lengths from 16 to 31 inches with an average length and weight of 21 inches and 2 pounds. Of the 16 fish sampled, only one was longer than 26 inches. Anglers are encouraged to harvest small pike (<22 inches) and release the medium-sized pike (>26 inches) to help increase the size structure of the population. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye numbers in 2021 were significantly higher than 2018 and were the highest on record for Becker Lake. Walleye numbers were also high compared to other lakes within the Sauk River Chain as well. Walleyes are not stocked in Becker Lake but can easily swim in from nearby Horseshoe Lake and the Sauk River. Walleye sampled ranged in length from 13 to 24 inches with an average length and weight of 16 inches and 1.5 pounds. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie are not abundant in Becker Lake and historical catches have been low as well. Only one Black Crappie was caught in 2021. No Bluegill were caught in the gill nets in 2021, but trap net data from 2018 showed an abundant Bluegill population with an average length of 6 inches with a few fish up to 8 inches. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch catches have been low the past four surveys and none were caught in 2021. High numbers of Northern Pike and Walleye have likely reduced Yellow Perch abundance over time. <br> \n <br> \nChannel Catfish are abundant in Becker Lake as well as in the rest of the chain of lakes; however, the average size is exceptional. Channel catfish lengths ranged from 20 to 29 inches with an average length and weight of 24 inches and 5 pounds. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled included: Black Bullhead, Yellow Bullhead, Pumpkinseed, and White Sucker. <br> \n <br> \nPeople can have significant impacts on lakes and the fish populations they support. Fish harvest, lakeshore development, removal of shoreline vegetation, and introductions of aquatic invasive species (AIS) can all adversely affect fish populations. In 2018, zebra mussels were identified in the Sauk River Chain of Lakes and in 2021 Eurasian water milfoil was identified in Horseshoe Lake. AIS can be moved from infested to non-infested waters by anglers, boaters, and lake shore owners. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access. If you suspect an infestation of an invasive species in this lake, save a specimen and report it to a local DNR office. Additional information on all of these topics can be found on the DNR website (www.dnr.state.mn.us) or by contacting the Sauk Rapids Area Fisheries office. <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n</p>",
