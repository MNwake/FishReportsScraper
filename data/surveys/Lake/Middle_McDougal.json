The fish population is comprised of walleye, northern pike, yellow perch and white sucker. The lake is not known for producing alot of walleye but some are caught, mostly by the seasonal cabin residents on the lake who generate most of the fishing pressure. A small number of walleye were collected in the 1996 population assessment and ranged in size from 5.8 inches to 16.0 inches (1.3 pounds). The fish taken were mostly small averaging 10.6 inches (0.5 pound) with neearly 80% smaller than 14 inches (1.0 pound). In previous assessments walleye up to 26 inches have been sampled.     Northern pike are present in about average numbers but are small, averaging just under 1 pound. No northern pike larger than 21 inches were taken in the sample which is typical of this lake.     Yellow perch appear to be fairly abundant but most are too small to be acceptable to anglers. Nearly 70% of the yellow perch sampled were in the 5 inch to 6 inch range. Fish up to 10 inches were taken but appear to be rare.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Middle McDougal Lake has an area of 104 acres with a maximum depth of 7.0 feet and has fairly dark brown bog stained water.  The lake is located nine miles west of Isabella and is part of the McDougal chain of lakes.  Access to the lake is from the North McDougal Lake trailer in facility, up Coyote Creek, then up the smaller unnamed creek to the lake.  The purpose of this survey was to update information on the fish community as per the 2011 Lake Management Plan and more specifically, to assess the relatively new Bluegill population.  Most of the southeast and east shore of the lake is private land and 23 cabins are present.  The remainder of the shoreline is owned by the U.S. Forest Service or State of MN.  Due to shallow depth and abundant vegetation, only trap nets are used to assess the lake. <br> \n <br> \nThe 2016 Bluegill trap net catch in 15 sets was 4.1/net with an average weight of 0.6 pounds and length of 8.6 inches.  Both would be considered just above average for similar lakes in the Finland area.  The largest Bluegill was 10.6 inches long and weighed 1.2 pounds, with 82% of the catch at least 8 inches long.  <br> \n <br> \nThe Walleye catch was 0.9/net, average for similar lakes in the area.  The average weight of 0.8 pounds and length 13.1 inches was below average relative to similar lakes.  The largest fish sampled was 20.5 inches long and weighed 2.7 pounds.  <br> \n <br> \nThe Northern Pike catch was 0.9/net with an average weight of 2.2 pounds.  Two fish caught were greater than 34 inches long with the largest fish being 34.7 inches long and weighing 9.5 pounds.  <br> \n <br> \nThe Yellow Perch catch was 3.1/net, with an average weight just under 0.2 pounds.  Both are considered about average for similar lakes in the area.  The largest fish sampled was 11.1 inches long, and the average length of all Yellow Perch was 6.5 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nThe White Sucker catch of 2.1/net was average.  The average weight of 2.5 pounds was above average.  Hybrid sunfish and Pumpkinseed were also sampled in trap nets. <br> \n <br> \nFour quarter inch mesh trap nets were set and sampled Golden Shiner, Spottail Shiner, and Tadpole Madtom.  Young-of-the-year Bluegill, Smallmouth Bass, Walleye, White Sucker, and Yellow Perch were also sampled. <br> \n</p>",

The largest walleye caught during this survey was 2.0 pounds with the average size about 1.0 pound.Northern pike were sampled in average numbers but most were quite small.  Northern pike up to six pounds were captured but most of the fish were less than 1.5 pounds.Yellow perch were caught in average numbers with some keeper-size fish in the sample.  Approximately 25% of the yellow perch caught were in the 9 inch to 11 inch range with one individual measuring 12 inches taken.Two bluegill (average size 7.5 inches) were caught in the survey.  This is the first time this species was ever sampled in this lake; they are believed to be very uncommon at this time.The smallmouth bass that were collected were very small fish (less than 2 inches) that had been hatched this year.  No adult smallmouth bass were taken during this survey.  This is also the first time this species was ever taken in this lake.  The bluegill and smallmouth bass were not introduced by the DNR.Middle McDougal Lake can be accessed via the channel that connects with North McDougal Lake.  Middle McDougal Lake is very shallow and the dense vegetation growth can make motorized travel difficult.</p>",

The lake is accessible through a private road near the south shore, and by the navigable outlet to Lower McDougal Lake, which has a public access. The lake has two intermittent inlets and an outlet. Shoal water soils are mostly sandy muck, sand and gravel.     At the time of the survey, ten cottages and sixteen boats were present at the lake. Aquatic vegetation was sparse over most of the lake, with a moderate stand of wild rice in the north bay. Several species of minnows and young-of-the-year Northern Pike and Yellow Perch were taken in shoreline seining. Spawning facilities were rated \"fair\" for Northern Pike and \"poor\" for other species of gamefish. Recent angling success had been poor for both Walleye and Northern Pike.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Middle McDougal Lake is in Lake County about nine miles west of Isabella and is within the Superior National Forest. Most of the lake is less than five feet deep and supports a variety of submerged, floating leaved, and emergent vegetation. The lake is connected to Coyote Creek and other nearby waterbodies known collectively as the McDougal Chain of Lakes. There is a public access with concrete log ramp at the Forest Service campground located on North McDougal Lake that provides access to the entire chain.  <br> \n <br> \nBluegill have established a naturally reproducing population with good size and age structure since first being sampled in the lake in 2000. Results from this survey confirm that year classes have been produced regularly over the past decade. Bluegill sampled in 2023 ranged from 2 to 10 years old and from 3 to 10\" long, with 39% greater than 8\" long. Growth is good compared to other area lakes with fish reaching about 7.5\" at age-5.  <br> \n <br> \nThe Northern Pike catch had a similar size structure as previous surveys of the lake with few fish greater than 24\" long sampled. The small number of Walleye sampled was also similar to previous surveys and the average length was 16.4\" and average weight was 1.8 pounds. <br> \n <br> \nWhite Sucker and Yellow Perch were also sampled during the survey. Some perch may grow to a size of interest to anglers, but they are primarily a forage species. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>The shallow, heavily vegetated Middle McDougal Lake provides excellent habitat for bluegill, perch and other forage species; it is a valuable asset to all the lakes in the McDougal chain.  Sample methods used for this lake favor shoreline species and were not ideal for assessing walleye and northern pike populations. Only trap net sets were used in 2009 to assess the fish community. <br> \n   <br> \nThe 2009 walleye abundance in Middle McDougal Lake was above average for the lake class with a catch of 1.1 fish per net, similar to past investigations. The average length was 13.3 inches with 25% of the catch larger than 16 inches. Growth was slightly above average for the Finland area. <br> \n   <br> \nNorthern pike numbers were 1.0 fish per trap net lift with an average length of 15.5 inches. Growth was below average compared to other lakes in the Finland area. <br> \n <br> \nBluegills were first sampled in this lake in 2000. Their current population was well above average for the lake class with a catch of 9.0 fish per net. The average length was 7.2 inches with several fish over 8 inches. Growth was much faster than other lakes in the Finland area and reflects the excellent habitat present in Middle McDougal. <br> \n <br> \nOther fish sampled in the 2009 assessment included yellow perch, smallmouth bass and white suckers. <br> \n <br> \nAccess to Middle McDougal Lake is gained through the North McDougal Lake access; take the channel from the south side of the west basin of North McDougal Lake 0.9 miles south then east 0.1 mile to the outlet of Middle McDougal Lake. The McDougal Lakes have very dark bog stained water with shallow boulder areas. Caution is advised when boating on these lakes. <br> \n</p>",
