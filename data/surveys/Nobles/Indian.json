GILLNET AND TRAPNET CATCH RATES WERE AT OR BELOW THE LOWER END OF THE NORMAL RANGE FOR LAKE CLASS 43.  WAE PSD DECREASED FROM 98 (N=48) IN 1987 TO 0 (N=4) IN 1992 (TABLE 1).  GROWTH ANALYSIS AND COMPARISON TO 1987 DATA WAS LIMITED DUE TO LOW SAMPLE SIZE.  NO NATURAL REPRODUCTION WAS OBSERVED DURING THE SUMMER REPRODUCTION SAMPLE.  IN GENERAL, THE WAE POPULATION HAS NOT DONE WELL.  HOWEVER, THERE IS EVIDENCE OF A PARTIAL WINTERKILL IN 1989-90.  THE ABSENCE OF EVAILABLE SPAWNING HABITAT AND NATURAL REPRODUCTION COUPLED WITH LIMITED STOCKING SUCCESS SUGGEST WE MIGHT REEVALUATE WAE AS THE PRIMARY SPECIES.  INDIAN LAKE APPEARS TO RECEIVE LIMITED FISHING PRESSURE (NO CREEL DATA AVAILABLE) AND IS SUBJECT TO FREQUENT WINTERKILLS (DEPTH 6.5 FT). THEREFORE, IF FRY STOCKING IS NOT SUCCESSFUL IT MAY NOT BE ECONOMICALLY JUSTIFIABLE TO STOCK FINGERLING WAE.  YEP NATURALLY RECRUIT IN INDIAN LAKE AND HAVE BEEN RELATIVELY STABLE SINCE 1987. GILLNET CPUE DECREASED FROM 36.5 IN 1987 TO 17.5 IN 1992.  ALTHOUGH GILLNET AND TRAPNET CATCH RATES DECREASED, BOTH REMAINED WITHIN THE NORMAL RANGE FOR LAKE CLASS 43.  YEP PSD DECREASED FROM 36 TO 14 SINCE 1987 (TABLE 1).  DURING A SPRING WINTER- KILL SURVEY (USING TRAPNETS), YEP PSD WAS 27. YEP LENGTHS HAVE CONSISTENTLY RANGED FROM 5.5 TO 9.5 INCHES SINCE 1987.  SINCE IT APPEARS INDIAN LAKE RECEIVES LIMITED ANGLING PRESSURE, HAVEST WOULD NOT EXPLAIN THE ABSENCE OF LARGER YEP. NATURAL MORTALITY FROM NOT ADEQUATELY EXPLAIN THEIR ABSENCE EITHER BECAUSE OTHER REGIONAL LAKES HAVE SIMILAR GROWTH RATES AND LARGER YEP.  BIOLOGICAL BURNOUT IS THE CONCEPT THAT IN AREAS WHERE FISH GROW FAST, THEY TEND NOT TO LIVE AS LONG AS FISH IN AREAS WITH SLOWER GROWTH.  PRESENTLY, WE DO NOT UNDERSTAND THE LACK OF LARGER YEP.  GROWTH COMPARISONS MAY NOT BE VALID BECAUSE IT APPEARS THE 1987 GROWTH DATA WAS NOT BACK-CALCULATED.  YEP WERE DOMINATED BY A STRONG AGE-2 YEAR CLASS.  YEP HAVE NATURALLY RECRUITED FOR AT LEAST SEVEN YEARS.  IN 1992 482 (RANGE 40-300/HAUL) YOY YEP WERE COLLECTED IN FOUR SEINE HAULS.  INDIAN LAKE YEP MAY BE AN UNDERUTILIZED SELF-SUSTAINING FISHERY.  BLC TRAPNET CPUE INCREASED FROM 13.3 IN 1987 TO 18.5 IN 1992, REMAINING IN THE NORMAL RANGE FOR LAKE CLASS 43.  BLC SIZE STRUCTURE HAS DECREASED SINCE 1987; PSD AND RSD-P VALUES WENT FROM 99 AND 13 IN 1987 TO 70 AND 1 IN 1992 (TABLE 1).  THE POPULATION IS DOMINATED BY AGE-2 AND AGE-4 BLC. GROWTH COMPARISON CAN ONLY BE MADE FOR AGE-3 AND AGE-4 FISH AND THESE MAY BE QUESTIONABLE.  FOR THESE TWO AGE GROUPS, MEAN LENGTHS WERE VERY SIMILAR TO 1987 DATA.  WHC TRAPNET CPUE INCREASED FROM 11.5 IN 1987 TO 32.8 IN 1992 AND WAS 8 TIMES ABOVE THE UPPER END OF THE NORMAL RANGE FOR LAKE CLASS 43.  WHC PSD, RSD-P, AND RSD-M DECREASED FROM 100, 76, AND 10 TO 86 AND 1 SINCE 1987 (TABLE 1).  THE POPULATION WAS DOMINATED BY AGE-4 FISH BUT THERE WAS ALSO A RELATIVELY STRONG AGE-2 YEAR CLASS.  GROWTH WAS VERY SIMILAR TO 1987 DATA EVEN THOUGH DIFFERENT METHODS WERE USED TO DETERMINE LENGTH AT AGE.  THE INDIAN LAKE WHC POPULATION APPEARS TO BE NATURALLY RECRUITING SINCE THERE ARE NO RECORDS OF STOCKING.  THREE YEARLING WHC AND 2,650 YOY CRAPPIE SPP.  (UNIDENTIFIABLE TO SPECIES) WERE COLLECTED DURING SUMMER SHORELINE SEINING IN 1992.  EITHER BLC, WHC OR BOTH SUCCESSFULLY REPRODUCED DURING 1992.  ASSUMING NO SUBSTANTIAL MORTALITY, THE 1992 CRAPPIE SPP. YEAR CLASS SHOULD BE STRONG.  CRAPPIE RECRUITMENT TENDS TO BE INCONSISTENT IN SHALLOW, TURBID LAKES IN SOUTHERN MN AND SE SOUTH DAKOTA.  THE STRONGEST BLC YEAR CLASS (AGED-4) WAS PROBABLY FROM A 1990 ADULT STOCKING WHILE THE NEXT STRONGEST (AGE-2) WAS FROM NATURAL REPRODUCTION.  THE STRONGEST WHC YEAR CLASSES WERE THE SAME AS BLC; NO WHC WERE STOCKED.  MANY FISHERIES BIOLOGISTS BELIEVE SPRING ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS CONTROL SUCCESSFUL CRAPPIE RECRUITMENT MORE THAN ADULT ABUNDANCE. CAP, BLB, AND WTS GILLNET CPUE INCREASED WHILE BIB CATCH RATES DECREASED SINCE 1987.  CARP AND WTS TRAPNET CPUE INCREASED WHILE BLB CATCH RATES DECREASED OVER THE PAST FIVE YEARS.  SUBSTANTIAL REMOVAL OF UNDESIRABLE SPECIES DURING THE WINTER OF 1992-93 SHOULD DEFINITELY EFFECT THE REMAINING FISH COMMUNITY.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Indian is a 204-acre class 43 lake located approximately 2 miles southeast of the City of Round Lake in Nobles County near the Minnesota-Iowa border.  The lake has a maximum depth of 6.0 feet, has a watershed to lake ratio of 38 to 1.  Indian is managed primarily for black and white crappie, while northern pike and walleye are managed as a secondary species.  The lake has had a history of low oxygen readings and is therefore aerated during the winter months. <br> \n <br> \nThe walleye gill net catch rate of 1.7 fish/net in 2010 fairly low when compared to lakes like Indian.  The gill net catch rate was considerably higher in 2004 with a catch rate of 17.7 walleye/gn.  The walleye gill net catch rate was 2.3 in 2000.   The low catch rate in 2010 can be attributed to walleye yearlings being stocked in 2003 rather than walleye fingerlings.  Since natural reproduction is limited, this left empty year classes in 2003, 2004, and 2005.  The only fish sampled during the assessment in 2010 were from the yearling stocking in 2003 and fingerling stockings in 2006 and 2009.  A change to the management plan with increased frequency of stocking may improve the catch rates as well as fishing.  To create a \"fishable\" walleye population and meet the long range goal for Indian Lake, the stocking frequency should be increased to two of three years or every other year.  Lengths of walleye caught in gill nets ranged from 9.3 to 21.0 inches and had an average length of 13.6 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nBoth black and white crappie are available to anglers in Indian Lake.  Black crappie have 7-8  dorsal spines with dark splotches against a white background on their body.  White crappie have 5-6 dorsal spines and black splotches that form vertical lines on their bodies.  The black crappie trap net catch rate of 1.6 fish/net in 2010 was also low when compared to other lakes similar to Indian.  The black crappie trap net catch rate was 7.3 fish/net in 2004 and 19.3 fish/net in 2000.  Lengths of black crappie caught in trap nets ranged from 5.5 to 11.4 inches and had an average length of 8.3 inches.  In contrast, the white crappie population is doing quite well in Indian Lake.  The white crappie trap net catch rate of 29.4 far exceeds what we would expect in Indian Lake.  Typically white crappies tend to thrive in more turbid waters which is what we would expect for this larger watershed.  Lengths of white crappie caught in trap nets ranged from 6.5 to 14.0 inches and averaged 9.0 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nThe northern pike gill net catch rate of 1.3 fish/net in 2010 is a little on the low side and is down a bit from previous fish surveys.  Lengths of northern pike caught in gill nets ranged from 19.7 to 24.4 inches and averaged 22.1 inches. <br> \n <br> \nThe yellow perch population is in good shape in Indian Lake.  The gill net catch rate of 16.7 fish/net is just above the long term average catch rate of 16.3 fish/net.  Lengths of yellow perch caught in gill nets in 2010 ranged from 5.2 to 12.4 inches and averaged 9.1 inches.  It is likely that good perch fishing could be had on Indian Lake. <br> \n <br> \nBlack bullhead numbers are low in Indian Lake but the average size is quite good.  Lengths of black bullhead caught in trap nets ranged from 10.4 to 13.4 inches and averaged 11.6 inches. <br> \n <br> \nOther fish sampled during the 2010 assessment included bigmouth buffalo, common carp,  bluegill, freshwater drum, orangespotted sunfish, white sucker, and yellow bullhead. <br> \n <br> \nTo maintain a healthy fishery in Indian Lake; we need to promote Best Management Practices (BMP's) within the watershed to help reduce nutrients entering the lake.  High nutrients and sediments in a lake can cause algae blooms and reduce water clarity. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Indian Lake is a 204-acre lake, located to the southwest of the City of Round Lake in Nobles County. Indian Lake has a maximum depth of 6.0 ft.  Runoff from surrounding agricultural fields has resulted in poor water quality in Indian Lake.  Despite its shallowness, Indian Lake rarely experiences low dissolved oxygen levels in the winter which has allowed a diverse fish community to establish. Indian Lake is connected to the Little Sioux River Watershed along with a water control structure that allows fish passage during high water.  These factors likely contribute to the diverse fishery.  Indian Lake is managed primarily for Black and White Crappie, and secondarily for Walleye and Northern Pike.  A standard survey was conducted during the week of May 23, 2022 to monitor the fish community in Indian Lake.   <br> \n <br> \nThe 2022 White Crappie catch rate was 2.0 per trap net, which is the lowest catch rate ever recorded on Indian Lake.  Historically, White Crappie abundance has exceeded the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (0.3 to 6.0 per trap net) in every survey since 2000.  The water during the 2022 survey was uncharacteristically clear (Secchi depth of 4.0 ft.) which may have affected the catch of White Crappie in trap nets.  Lengths of White Crappie ranged from 11.1 to 12.6 inches and averaged 11.9 inches.  Despite abundance of White Crappie being lower than usual, the size of the fish was impressive and should provide a quality angling opportunity.  <br> \n <br> \nThe Black Crappie catch rate was also low in 2022, at 0.7 per trap net, which is below the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (1.2 to 20.5 per trap net).  Typically, when Black and White Crappie are found in the same lake, one species or the other will dominate over time.  In Indian Lake, it appears that the White Crappie have \"won the battle\", as Black Crappie catch rates have been low since 2010. Lengths of Black Crappie were large, ranging from 11.4 inches to 13.2 inches and averaging 12.2 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nThe 2022 Walleye catch rate was 3.3 per gill net, a decrease from the 2018 catch rate of 9.7 per gill net, but within the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (2.3 to 18.1 per gill net).  Indian Lake has been stocked extensively with Walleye fingerlings and yearlings in the last decade.  The decrease in catch rate could be a result of the clear water during the survey, where Walleye may have avoided the net because they could see it.  Lengths of Walleye ranged from 16.0 to 23.6 inches and averaged 17.7 inches.  Age-3, age-4, and age-7 Walleye were sampled and were likely the result of fingerling and yearling stockings.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike catch rates in Indian Lake have varied from 0.0 per gill net in 2014 to 6.0 per gill net in 1996 and have averaged 2.5 per gill net since 1987.  In 2022, the Northern Pike catch rate was 1.7 per gill net, within the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (1.1 to 8.0 per gill net).  Lengths of Northern Pike ranged from 16.6 to 33.7 inches and averaged 24.9 inches.  In the last decade, Northern Pike fingerlings were stocked in 2014 and 2021.  We typically would have stocked more frequently in the last decade but Northern Pike production is inherently variable.  Indian Lake is within the \"southern zone\" of the Northern Pike zone regulations, so two Pike longer than 24 inches can be harvested. Northern Pike under 24 inches must be released. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch abundance remained low at 2.3 per gill net, below the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (2.7 to 25.0 per gill net).  Black Bullhead abundance has remained low since the 2004 survey as catch rates have not exceeded 7.7 per trap net in any survey.  The trend continued in 2022 when the Black Bullhead catch rate was 5.3 per trap net. Other species sampled included Bigmouth Buffalo, Channel Catfish, Common Carp, Freshwater Drum, Green Sunfish, White Sucker, and Yellow Bullhead.     <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>INTRODUCTION <br> \nIndian Lake is a 204-acre lake located two miles to the southwest of the City of Round Lake in Nobles County. Indian Lake has a maximum depth of 6.0 ft. and a watershed to lake ratio of 38:1 which means that for every 1 acre of water on the lake there is 38 acres of upland drainage.  Indian Lake has a relatively large watershed. Runoff from surrounding agricultural fields has resulted in poor water quality in Indian Lake, as indicated by a Secchi depth of 1.9 feet. Despite its shallowness, Indian Lake rarely experiences low dissolved oxygen levels in the winter which has allowed a diverse fish community to establish. Indian Lake is managed primarily for black and white crappie, and secondarily for walleye and northern pike. The crappie populations have sustained themselves through natural reproduction, but walleye and northern pike are stocked to maintain populations. Walleye fingerlings are stocked every other year (2009, 2011, 2013, and 2015) and northern pike fingerlings are stocked every third year (2005, 2008, 2011, 2014, and 2017). A population assessment was conducted during the week of June 2, 2014 to monitor the fish community in Indian Lake.  <br> \n <br> \nWHITE CRAPPIE <br> \nOver the past decade, the white crappie population has been stable, as variation in catch rates has been minimal (25.1 per trap net in 2004, 22.9 per trap net in 2010, and 18.1 per trap net in 2014). Prior to 2004, catch rates were highly variable ranging from 5.5 per trap net in 1996 to 107.4 per trap net in 2000. The catch rate of 18.1 per trap net in 2014 is much greater than what would be expected in lakes similar to Indian. The majority (74 percent) of the white crappie sampled were from 9.0 to 10.5 inches in length. Overall, lengths ranged from 4.1 to 15.0 inches and averaged 9.6 inches. White crappies were plump, indicating that prey is readily available. Indian Lake has the potential to produce large white crappies, as evidenced by the sampling of 9 fish over 12 inches, with one of those being 15 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nBLACK CRAPPIE <br> \nBlack crappie abundance has been highly variable in Indian Lake, ranging from 0.4 per trap net in 2014 to 19.3 per trap net in 2000. The 2014 catch rate of 0.4 per trap net is well below the long term average of 9.0 per trap net, and is below what would be expected in similar lakes. The low abundance of black crappies in Indian Lake may be a result of the high abundance of white crappies. The two species of crappies can coexist, but one of the species usually will occur at a lower abundance. The three black crappies that were captured in trap nets were large, ranging in length from 12.8 to 13.5 inches and averaging 13.3 inches. The gill net catch of black crappie indicated the presence of additional year classes, as gill netted crappies ranged from 4.4 to 9.7 inches and averaged 6.8 inches. Crappies were plump indicating that prey is readily available. Black crappies are present at low numbers in this system, but the angler can expect the size of black crappies to be large.  <br> \n <br> \nWALLEYE <br> \nIn 2014, walleyes were captured at rate of 2.7 per gill net, which is within the historic range of catch rates (1.7 per gill net in 2010 to 17.7 per gill net in 2010) , and within the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (2.3 to 18.1 per gill net). The 2014 catch rate is at the low end of expected catch rates, indicating a low abundance population. Walleyes from gill nets ranged in length from 10.1 to 21.1 inches and averaged 16.3 inches. Walleyes captured in trap nets were smaller, ranging from 6.9 to 8.5 inches and averaging 7.5 inches. Three year classes of walleyes were sampled (age-1, age-3, and age-5), all corresponding to years that fingerlings were stocked (2013, 2011, and 2009). This indicates that natural reproduction is rare in Indian Lake and that the walleye population is maintained by stocking. Mean back-calculated lengths at age were 8.2 inches for age-1, 13.2 inches for age-2, 15.4 inches for age-3, 17.9 inches for age-4, and 19.3 inches for age-5, indicating slow growth for ages 1 to 3 and faster growth for ages 4 and 5, when compared to average values of mean length at age for similar lakes. Walleyes sampled corresponded to each stocking event, suggesting that fingerling stocking is somewhat successful in keeping multiple year classes present in this system. The current stocking regime will likely continue, as strong year classes that have occurred in the past have been the result of fingerling stocking. In addition, walleye fingerling stocking is the most successful strategy when an abundant crappie population is present.  <br> \n <br> \nNORTHERN PIKE <br> \nStocking of northern pike fingerlings has occurred every three years since 2005 in Indian Lake (2005, 2008, 2011 and 2014). Despite stocking efforts, zero northern pike were captured in 2014, which is the lowest catch rate observed since surveys began on Indian Lake in 1987. Prior to the beginning of stocking in 2005, northern pike catch rates were higher at 4.5, 6.0, 2.7, and 3.3 per gill net in 1987, 1996, 2000, and 2004, respectively. The higher catch rates prior to stocking suggest that higher quality spawning habitat was available. Northern pike likely made spawning runs into streams and ditches that had good spawning habitat and were connected to Indian Lake. The northern pike fingerlings that are being stocked once every three years are not showing up in the catches; therefore, consideration will be given to the altering the frequency and/or the size of northern pike stocked.  <br> \n <br> \nYELLOW PERCH <br> \nThe 2014 catch rate of 5.0 per gill net is within the expected range of catch rates of similar lakes, but is the lowest catch rate observed since surveys began in 1987. Yellow perch catch rates have varied from 36.5 per gill net in 1987 to 5.0 per gill net in 2014, and have averaged 14.7 per gill net since 1987. Yellow perch ranged in length from 7.6 to 10.9 inches and averaged 9.2 inches. In an effort to increase the brood stock of yellow perch in Indian Lake, 750 pre-spawn adult yellow perch were stocked in April of 2014.  <br> \n <br> \nOTHER SPECIES <br> \nOver the last decade, black bullhead catch rates have been below the expected catch rates for similar lakes. In 2014, the trend of low black bullhead abundance continued as bullheads were captured at a rate of 2.8 per trap net. Black bullheads ranged in length from 10.0 to 13.5 inches and averaged 11.6 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nCommon carp abundance increased from 1.0 per gill net in 2010 to 3.3 per gill net in 2014, which is the second highest catch rate of common carp since surveys began in 1987. The 2014 catch rate is higher than the long term average of 2.4 per gill net, but within the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (1.0 to 13.8 per gill net). Common carp lengths in trap nets and gill nets ranged from 8.6 to 35.9 inches, with most of them being greater than 25.0 inches in length.  <br> \n <br> \nThe 2014 catch rate of bigmouth buffalo (3.3 per gill net) was the highest catch rate observed since surveys began in 1987, but was within the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (0.8 to 7.0 per gill net). Bigmouth buffalo ranged in length from 7.7 to 27.6 inches and averaged 20.5 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nFreshwater drum were first sampled in Indian Lake in the 1996 survey. Since then, the abundance of freshwater drum has consistently stayed within the expected range of catch rates for both trap nets (0.2 to 3.3 per trap net) and gill nets (0.5 to 8.3 per trap net) for similar lakes. The 2014 catch rates were also within this range at 5.7 per gill net and 0.4 per trap net. Freshwater drum can be problematic because they can predate on game fish, or compete with game fish for prey resources.  <br> \n <br> \nOne, 25.2 inch channel catfish was sampled in the gill net. This is the first time a channel catfish has been sampled since 2000.  <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled included white sucker (N=26). <br> \n <br> \nPlants in the water and at the water's edge provide habitat, prevent erosion, and absorb excess nutrients.  Shrubs, trees, and woody debris such as fallen trees or limbs provide good habitat both above and below the water and should be left in place.  By leaving a buffer strip of natural vegetation along the shoreline, property owners can reduce erosion, help maintain or improve water quality, and provide habitat and travel corridors for wildlife. <br> \n <br> \nBest management practices within the watershed (no-till farming, cover crops, buffer strips, targeted fertilizer application, reduced or metered tiling) would help reduce nutrients entering the lake. High nutrient and sediment input can cause algae blooms and reduce overall water quality. Any improvements in the watershed are likely to have positive impacts on the fishery. <br> \n <br> \nPrepared by Jonah Dagel <br> \n</p>",

Runoff from surrounding agricultural fields has resulted in poor water quality in Indian Lake.  Despite its shallowness, Indian Lake rarely experiences low dissolved oxygen levels in the winter; however, during the winter of 2022 and 2023 Indian Lake experienced low dissolved oxygen levels throughout much of the winter (less than 0.6 ppm).  Indian Lake is managed primarily for black and white crappie, and secondarily for walleye and northern pike.  To evaluate the success of the Walleye fry stocking that was done in the spring of 2023, boat electrofishing was used to capture fingerling Walleye on September 21, 2023, to determine their abundance.  <br> \n <br> \nFollowing the winterkill Walleye fry were stocked because they typically do very well in these conditions.  The catch rate of Young of the year Walleye was 672.0 per hour, suggesting that the stocking was highly successful.  Lengths of YOY walleye ranged from 4.5 to 6.7 inches and averaged 5.3 inches.  This abundant year class of a top-level predator should help keep undesirable species of fish in check.   <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Indian Lake is a 204-acre lake two miles to the southwest of the City of Round Lake in Nobles County. Indian Lake has a maximum depth of 6.0 ft.  Runoff from surrounding agricultural fields has resulted in poor water quality in Indian Lake. Despite its shallowness, Indian Lake rarely experiences low dissolved oxygen levels in the winter which has allowed a diverse fish community to establish. Indian Lake is managed primarily for black and white crappie, and secondarily for walleye and northern pike.  A standard survey was conducted during the week of May 21, 2018 to monitor the fish community in Indian Lake.   <br> \n <br> \nWhite Crappie abundance in Indian Lake has been stable since 2004, with catch rates ranging from 16.3 per trap net in 2018 to 25.1 per trap net in 2004 and averaging 20.6 per trap net.  The 2018 catch rate of 16.3 per trap net greatly exceeded the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (0.3 to 6.0 per trap net).  Lengths of White Crappie ranged from 4.5 to 16.3 inches and averaged 11.0 inches, with 82 percent of White Crappies exceeding 10.0 inches.  Based on the 2018 survey, Indian Lake has the potential to be a great spot to catch good numbers of large White Crappie.  <br> \n <br> \nThe Black Crappie catch rate in 2018 was 1.8 per trap net, an increase from the 2014 catch rate of 0.4 per trap net, and within the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (1.2 to 20.5 per trap net).  The low abundance of Black Crappie in Indian Lake may be a result of the high abundance of White Crappie. The two species of Crappies can coexist, but one of the species usually will occur at a lower abundance.  Lengths of Black Crappie ranged from 5.4 to 13.8 inches and averaged 11.4 inches, with 75 percent exceeding 11.0 inches in length. <br> \n <br> \nThe 2018 Walleye catch rate was 9.7 per gill net, which is the highest catch rate since 2004, and is within the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (2.3 to 18.1 per gill net).  Walleye lengths ranged from 12.2 to 22.3 inches and averaged 17.8 inches.  Four year classes of Walleye were sampled including the 2013, 2014, 2015, and 2016 year classes, all of which correspond to stocking events in 2013, 2015, and 2017, during which both fingerlings and yearlings were stocked.  Average lengths at age-1, age-2, age-3, and age-4 were 10.0 inches, 13.6 inches, 16.9 inches and 18.5 inches, respectively, indicating fast growth of Walleye.  Walleye fingerlings have been stocked at a rate of 2 pounds per acre every other year since 2011, successfully producing a quality Walleye fishery. <br> \n <br> \nThe 2018 Northern Pike catch rate was 2.7 per gill net, similar to the long term average of 2.6 per gill net, and was within the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (1.1 to 8.0 per gill net).  Lengths of Northern Pike ranged from 18.9 to 24.9 inches and averaged 21.0 inches (PSD=64).  Indian Lake is within the \"southern zone\" of the new Northern Pike zone regulations, so two pike 24 inches or longer can be harvested. Northern Pike under 24 inches must be released. <br> \n <br> \nOnly two Yellow Perch were sampled, which was the fewest in survey history. Yellow Perch are likely being out competed by the abundant White Crappie population or getting eaten by the walleye.  Black Bullhead abundance continued to be low at 9.0 per gill net and 7.7 per trap net.  The Freshwater Drum catch rate was 9.0 per gill net, the highest ever recorded on Indian Lake.  Other species sampled included Bigmouth Buffalo, Bluegill, Channel Catfish, Common Carp, White Sucker, and Yellow Bullhead. <br> \n</p>",

Despite its shallowness, Indian Lake rarely experiences low dissolved oxygen levels; however, the winter of 2022-2023 was harsh with cold temperatures and a lot of snow, depleting dissolved oxygen levels below 0.7 parts per million in February and March of 2023.  Indian Lake is managed primarily for Black and White Crappie, and secondarily for Walleye and Northern Pike.  A winterkill check was conducted on May 16, 2023 using boat electrofishing to determine the extent of the winterkill at Indian Lake.   <br> \n <br> \nIndian Lake had a diverse fish community with 13 species of fish sampled in the 2022 standard survey.  During the 2023 winterkill check Fathead Minnows were the only species sampled at a rate of 251.3 per hour.  Indian Lake suffered a severe winterkill that greatly altered the fish community.  Indian Lake was stocked with 204,000 Walleye fry and pre-spawn adult Black Crappie in the spring of 2023 to reestablish populations.  While it did experience a significant winterkill, the outlet of Indian Lake is directly connected to the Little Sioux River.  This connectivity likely allowed some broodstock of various fish species soon after Indian Lake became ice free.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Indian Lake, in Nobles County, is a 204 acre lake that is primarily managed for black and white crappie.  Indian Lake is also managed for yellow perch, walleye, and northern pike.  This lake has a history of low dissolved oxygen and thus has been opened to liberalized fishing in the past.  The most recent low dissolved oxygen was recorded during the winter of 1989-90.  It was verified that at least a partial winterkill occurred during the winter of 1989-90.  The operational plan calls for stocking walleye fry or fingerlings every third year.  Walleye fingerlings were stocked in the fall of 2000.      Trap nets are typically used to assess the black crappie population.  The average black crappie trap net catch rate was 19.25 fish/net in 2000, 2.88 fish/net in 1996, 9.13 fish/net in 1993, 18.50 fish/net in 1992, and 13.30 fish/net in 1987.  The black crappie numbers have always been higher than the lower average range (1.17 fish/net).  A large portion (58%) of the black crappie were between 8.5-9.5 inches.  All of the fish were from the 1998 (60%), 1997 (27%), and the 1996 year classes (13%).  Seineing data indicated good natural reproduction from both black and white crappie.  The take home message for you anglers is that the current black crappie catch rates are the highest compared to previous surveys and the sizes of fish are nice enough for the frying pan.      As with black crappie, trap nets were used to assess the white crappie population.  The average white crappie trap net catch rate was 107.38 fish/net in 2000, 5.50 fish/net in 1996, 27.63 fish/net in 1993, 32.75 fish/net in 1992, and 11.50 fish/net in 1987.  White crappie abundance has only once been lower than the upper average range (5.96 fish/net) for this lake class.  The survey catch rates for white crappie have never been as high as in the 2000 survey.  The average weight was 0.49 lbs/fish.  Similar to the black crappie length-frequency, a large portion (55.6%) of white crappie were between 8.5-9.5 inches.  All of the fish, based on aging from scales, were from the 1998 (59%), 1997 (21%), 1996 (19%), and the 1995 year classes (1%).  Historically, white crappie relative abundance has been consistently high for this lake class which indicates appropriate management for this lake.  High catch rates and the large size structure makes these black and white crappies a \"must\" for you anglers.     Gill nets are typically used to assess yellow perch, walleye, and northern pike abundance and size structure.  The average yellow perch catch rate was 8.33 fish/net in 2000, 11.67 fish/net in 1996, 17.0 fish/net in 1992, and 36.5 fish/net in 1987.  All historical catch rates for yellow perch are higher than the average catch rate (8.00  fish/net) for this type of lake.  All fish captured in 2000 were between 7.0-10 inches.  Eighteen Age 0 yellow perch were captured with a seine which indicates some natural reproduction.  Although the yellow perch population is not flourishing, nice fish can be caught.The average walleye gill net catch rate was 2.33 fish/net in 2000, 7.67 fish/net in 1996, 2.00 fish/net in 1992, and 16.00 fish/net in 1987.  All fish captured with the gill net were greater than 12 inches.  All walleyes aged correlated to fry stockings in 1993 and 1997 which probably indicates limited natural reproduction.  Although the walleye population is not dominating the fish community, some walleyes can be caught.     The average northern pike catch rate was 2.67 fish/net.  Most of the northern pike aged were from the 1996 and 1997 year classes.     Both trap nets and gill nets can be used to assess black bullhead relative abundance and size structure.  The average black bullhead gill net catch rate was 17.67 fish/net in 2000, 78.00 fish/net in 1996, 92.00 fish/net in 1992, and 47.00 fish/net in 1987.  The average black bullhead trap net catch rate was 19.88 fish/net in 2000, 85.88 fish/net in 1996, 155.13 fish/net in 1993, 108.75 fish/net in 1992, and 232.60 fish/net in 1987.  The catch rate in both trap nets and gill nets indicates the population relative abundance is the lowest it has ever been.  Although the density of black bullheads are lower compared to previous years, the sizes of bullheads are \"keepers\".     Freshwater drum have been sampled twice in separate gears in historical surveys.  Freshwater drum probably entered the system through County Ditch number 1 via Judicial Ditch 24 from the West Fork of the Little Sioux River.     To promote and maintain healthy fish populations, pollution and other inputs need to be controlled.  Fish habitats are directly affected by water quality.  Nutrient, sediment and other waste inputs can drastically alter the biological, chemical, and physical components of a lake.  It is paramount to maintain if not improve the current water quality of Indian Lake through watershed management to preserve this fishery for future generations to enjoy.        </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Indian Lake, in Nobles County, is a 204 acre lake that is managed primarily for both black and white crappie.  It is managed secondarily for walleye and northern pike.  This class 43 lake has a history of low dissolved oxygen and thus has been opened to liberalized fishing in the past.  Historical stocking has consisted primarily of walleye fry and fingerlings.  Black crappie were stocked in 1979, 1983, and 1990 whereas yellow perch were stocked once in 1981.  Despite the fact that northern pike have only been stocked once in 14 years, the population seems to be somewhat self-sufficient.  The operational plan calls for stocking walleye fingerlings every third year.  Walleye fingerlings were stocked in the fall of 2000 (204 lbs) and 2003 (180 lbs) and adults in 2003 (60 lbs).  A survey was conducted during the week of June 1, 2004 using 3 gill nets and 9 trap nets.The black crappie catch rate was less than half that of the 2000 survey.  Despite the fact that the numbers are down, the sizes of fish are quite nice.  Total lengths ranged from 7.4 to 12.6 inches and averaged just over 10 inches.  This population had the largest black crappie sizes of all surveys conducted in 2004.  They were in excellent shape and quite plump.  Growth was above average as an Age 2 black crappie averaged nearly 8 inches.  The take home message is that if you are wanting to find a lake to fish black crappie, Indian Lake has some real \"slabs\" that could provide phenomenal fishing.As with  black crappies, the white crappie catch rate was down from the 2000 survey, but was still excellent compared to similar lakes in the Windom Area.  Often when you see a decline in numbers, the trade-off is an increase in the sizes of fish caught.  This is the same scenario as the black crappie in that the numbers declined since the last survey but the sizes of fish are excellent.  Total lengths of white crappie ranged from 8.1 to 12.6 and averaged 10.5 inches, and condition of fish was above average.  Growth was also above average as an Age 2 white crappie averaged over 8.4 inches.  Similar to the black crappie population, some phenomenal white crappie fishing can be had if you want some real \"slabs\".The catch rate for walleye was the best ever recorded during surveys on Indian Lake.  Total lengths ranged from 12.6 to 22.5 inches and averaged 14.7 inches.  The fish were quite healthy, being plump and in good condition.  Growth of walleye was above average for the Windom Area as an Age 2 walleye was nearly 13.5 inches.  Most of the walleye sampled corresponded to the fingerling stockings in 2000 and 2003.  No doubt about it that these fish would be worth the time for you walleye anglers.  This lake would be an excellent lake to fish crappies during the day and target the excellent walleye population at dusk.The northern pike catch rate was average for this type of lake.  Northern pike have only been stocked once (February 2001) in the last 14 years.  Varying northern pike numbers have been present in all surveys since the initial survey conducted in 1987.  Total lengths ranged from 17.3 to 27.4 inches and averaged 20.6 inches.  Growth of northern pike was average for the Windom Area as an Age 2 northern averaged 18.8 inches while an Age 3 was nearly 21 inches.  It might be worth your time to try some \"tip-up\" fishing for some northerns during the winter.The yellow perch catch rate was similar to that in the 2000 survey.  Total lengths ranged from 6.9 to 11.1 inches and averaged 9.2 inches.  Yellow perch have never been stocked into Indian Lake but appear to be self-sustaining.  The yellow perch are quite plump and in good condition. A total of 12 species of fish were sampled during the survey of 2004, including bigmouth buffalo, black bullhead, black crappie, bluegill, common carp, freshwater drum, northern pike, walleye, white crappie, white sucker, yellow bullhead, and yellow perch.To promote and maintain healthy fish populations, pollution and other inputs need to be controlled.  Fish habitats are directly affected by water quality.  Nutrient, sediment and other waste inputs can drastically alter the biological, chemical, and physical components of a lake.  It is paramount to maintain if not improve the current water quality of Indian Lake through watershed management to preserve this fishery for future generations to enjoy.

                "narrative": "<p>Indian Lake is managed primarily for black and white crappie while providing a secondary fishery for yellow perch and walleye.  The numbers of black and white crappie in Indian Lake are average compared to lakes similar to Indian.  The average weight of black and white crappie was approximately 3/4 of a lb. which is well above average for similar lakes.  Lengths from black crappie ranged from 8 to 13 inches and averaged about 10.5 inches while lengths from white crappie ranged from 6 to 14 inches and averaged about 11 inches.  Walleye numbers are average for lakes similar to Indian Lake.  The catch rates for walleye increased from 2 in 1992 to 8 fish/net in 1996.  The average weight increased from approximately ? lb. in 1992 to 2 lbs. in 1996.  Walleye lengths ranged from 9 to 24 inches and averaged about 16.5 inches.   Walleye were stocked in 1993 with fry and in 1994 with fingerlings.Northern pike numbers have rebounded since 1992.  Only 0.5 fish/net were caught in 1992 compared to 6 fish/net in 1996.  The average weight of northern pike was almost 3 lbs.  Northern pike lengths ranged from 11 to 28 inches with an average length of 22 inches.The yellow perch numbers are average for lakes similar to Indian Lake.  Lengths of yellow perch ranged from 6 to 12 inches and averaged about 8.5 inches while the average weight was 1/3 of a lb.  The black bullhead population is also average for lakes similar to Indian.  Black bullhead lengths ranged from 3 to 13.5 inches with an average length of 9 inches.  The average weight of black bullheads in Indian Lake is ? lb.To promote and maintain a healthy fish population, pollution and other inputs need to be controlled.  Fish habitat is directly affected by water quality.  Nutrient, sediment and other waste inputs can drastically alter the chemical and physical components of a Lake.  It is paramount to maintain if not improve the current water quality of Indian Lake through watershed management to preserve this fishery for future generations to enjoy.        </p>",
