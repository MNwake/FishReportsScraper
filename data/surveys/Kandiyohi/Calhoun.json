                "narrative": "<p>Calhoun is a moderately sized, shallow, productive lake located in Kandiyohi County.Both submergent and emergent vegetation densities were abundant within Calhoun. Water claritywas poor (3.2 feet) during the 1999 summer population assessment. Calhoun is a popularnorthern pike and panfish angling lake within the area. A recent bluegill management activityon Calhoun has been the removal of small bluegill during mid June (1,008 fish in 1999, 8,663fish in 1998, 13,818 fish in 1997, 11,020 fish in 1996) in order to promote better bluegillgrowth. Local anglers reported good fishing success for northern pike and bluegill in recentyears, but the northern pike size has been small (< 3 lbs.).     Northern pike were moderately abundant (8.75 fish/gillnet) in 1999. The 1999 northernpike average size was small (22.57 inches from the gillnets), however growth rates appearedslightly above average compared to other area lakes. Two dominant northern pike year classes(45% of the total catch for 1997, 41% of the total catch for 1996) comprised a majority ofthe 1999 catch.     Bluegill were moderately abundant (27.22 fish/trapnet) in 1999 compared to the normalrange (1.17 - 20.00 fish/trapnet) for similar lakes, but below the historical average (63.32fish/trapnet). The bluegill average size was small (5.01 inches, trapnets) and growth rateswere below average. There was excellent bluegill natural reproduction (41.00 young ofyear/seine haul, 2.08 inches average size) in 1999. Pumpkinseed sunfish were also moderatelyabundant (20.00 fish/trapnet) and small (4.95 inches from trapnets) in 1999.     Largemouth bass were moderately abundant (2.75 fish/gillnet) in 1999 with an averagesize of 10.77 inches from the gillnets. Black crappie numbers were low (2.25 fish/gillnet),but the average size was moderate (8.03 inches from gillnets) in 1999. Black crappie growthrates were average compared to other area lakes. The 1997 year class comprised 68% of thetotal black crappie catch. Yellow perch numbers were also low (0.50 fish/gillnet) in 1999,but the average size was moderately large (7.85 inches from the gillnets).     All three species of bullhead (yellow, black, and brown) were abundant within Calhoun.The average sizes from the gillnets were moderate for yellow bullhead (8.96 inches), largefor both black bullhead (10.12 inches) and brown bullhead (11.09 inches)     Calhoun Lake appears to have abundant numbers of gamefish and panfish present with theexception of yellow perch. Although, average sizes of bluegill, northern pike, and blackcrappie were small. Growth rates appeared good for northern pike and black crappie, but slowfor bluegill. The lack of forage fish (yellow perch) may limit northern pike growth inCalhoun. Selective removal of stunted bluegill (fish< 6 inches) during June is a managementoption for increasing bluegill average size in Calhoun. The DNR Spicer Fisheries Office willcontinue to monitor adult fish populations every four years by summer test netting and springelectrofishing.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A resurvey of Calhoun Lake was conducted in July of 2008. Calhoun is a moderately sized (618 acres) and moderately productive lake located in Kandiyohi County. The maximum depth is 13 feet. Residential development (51 homes/cabins & 5 recreational vehicles) has occurred primarily along the north and east shoreline areas. The immediate watershed is composed of agricultural row crop areas, hardwood tree stands, wetlands, grasslands, and residential homes. Agricultural row crop drainage into the lake occurs via several inlets/tiles/ditches located along the north, east, and west shore areas. The Middle Fork of Crow River enters Calhoun along the southwest corner. Calhoun is connected to Green Lake via a bypass channel of the Middle Fork Crow River and the Green Lake outlet marsh. A dam is located at the outlet on the south shore near the public access. Another dam is located on the Middle Fork of Crow River downstream of the bypass channel that flows into Calhoun. Water levels were normal during the 2008 spring and early summer, but low by fall. A DNR public access is located along the south shore. Large emergent vegetation (bulrush, cattails) stands were present along the west and south portions of the lake. Water quality (total phosphorus=0.033 mg/l) and clarity (secchi=6.0 feet) results were moderate during July of 2008. Submergent vegetation densities (northern milfoil, muskgrass, filamentous algae, water moss, various pondweed species) were moderate in 2008. Shoalwater substrates consisted mostly of sand, silt, and gravel. Calhoun is a popular bluegill and northern pike fishery. A partial (minimal) summerkill of bluegill (30-40 fish) and northern pike (1) due probably to columnaris was reported in June of 2007. Calhoun is managed primarily for largemouth bass, bluegill, black crappie, and northern pike. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass numbers were abundant in 2008 (5.33 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal ranges for Calhoun (25th=2.03, 50th=2.33, 75th=2.90 fish/gillnet) and similar lakes. The Calhoun largemouth bass historical average catch rate was 2.62 fish/gillnet. The 2008 largemouth bass average size was moderate (1.22 pounds and 12.80 inches) from gillnets. Largemouth bass growth rates were generally below the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-8. The 2002 year class comprised 33% of the 2008 total largemouth bass gillnet and trapnet catch. Abundant numbers of young of year \"YOY\" largemouth bass (55.75 fish/haul, 1.97 inches average length) were captured in the 2008 shoreline seine hauls.  <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie numbers were abundant in 2008 (14.67 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal ranges for Calhoun (25th=1.24, 50th=2.83, 75th=5.67 fish/gillnet) and similar lakes. The black crappie historical average gillnet catch was 4.68 fish/gillnet for Calhoun. The 2008 black crappie trapnet catch (8.14 fish/trapnet) was also above the Calhoun historical trapnet average (2.27 fish/trapnet). The 2008 black crappie average size was small (0.16 pounds and 6.36 inches) from gillnets, but moderate (0.33 pounds and 8.69 inches) from trapnets. The black crappie historical average weights were 0.31 pounds and 0.18 pounds from gillnets and trapnets respectively. The 2008 catch rate of preferred size (10 inches) and larger black crappie was low to moderate (1.60 fish/trapnet). Black crappie growth rates were below the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-4. The 2003 and 2002 year classes comprised 32% and 26% respectively of the total black crappie captured in the 2008 nets. Low numbers of YOY black crappie (2.00 fish/haul, 2.01 inches average length) were captured in the 2008 shoreline seine hauls. <br> \n  <br> \nNorthern pike numbers were abundant in 2008 (14.33 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal ranges for Calhoun (25th=8.73, 50th=12.40, 75th=14.83 fish/gillnet) and similar lakes. The northern pike historical average catch rate is 12.86 fish/gillnet for Calhoun. The 2008 northern pike average size was small to moderate (2.72 pounds and 22.06 inches) from gillnets. The northern pike historical average weight is 2.56 pounds from gillnets. The 2008 catch rate of quality size (21.00 inches) and larger northern pike was high (8.33 fish/gillnet). Northern pike growth rates were generally within the Spicer Area normal ranges. Approximately 47% of the northern pike captured in the 2008 summer resurvey nets were from the 2006 year class.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch were low in 2008 (3.00 fish/gillnet), but within the normal ranges for Calhoun (25th=2.38, 50th=8.13, 75th=13.03 fish/gillnet) and similar lakes. The yellow perch historical average catch rate is 10.31 fish/gillnet for Calhoun. The 2008 yellow perch average size was moderate (0.17 pounds and 7.10 inches) from gillnets. The yellow perch historical average weight is 0.15 pounds from gillnets. The catch rate of quality size (8.00 inches) and larger yellow perch was low (0.33 fish/gillnet) in 2008. Yellow perch growth rates were within the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-5. The 2004 year class comprised 50% of the 2008 yellow perch catch from gillnets and trapnets. Abundant numbers of YOY yellow perch (33.25 fish/haul, 2.22 inches average length) were captured in the 2008 shoreline seine hauls. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye numbers were abundant in 2008 (4.67 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range for Calhoun (25th=0.31, 50th=0.78, 75th=1.73 fish/gillnet) and within the normal range for similar lakes. The walleye historical catch rate is 1.42 fish/gillnet for Calhoun. The 2008 walleye average size was moderate (1.79 pounds and 16.39 inches) from gillnets. The walleye historical average weight is 2.05 pounds from gillnets. The catch rate of quality size (15.00 inches) and larger walleye was moderate (3.67 fish/gillnet) in 2008. Walleye growth rates were within the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-6. The 2005 year class (stocked as yearlings in 2006) comprised 69% of the 2008 walleye catch from gillnets and trapnets. Walleye yearlings and adults were stocked in Calhoun during 2004 (9,865 fish, 655 pounds), 2006 (728 fish, 468 pounds), and 2007 (1,557 fish, 150 pounds).  <br> \n <br> \nBluegill were moderate to abundant in 2008 (49.14 fish/trapnet) compared to the normal ranges for Calhoun (25th=19.14, 50th=38.18, 75th=65.03 fish/trapnet and similar lakes. The bluegill historical catch rate is 60.80 fish/trapnet for Calhoun. The 2008 bluegill average size was small to moderate (0.13 pounds and 5.54 inches) from trapnets. The bluegill historical average weight is 0.11 pounds from trapnets. The catch rate of quality size (6.00 inches) and larger bluegill was moderate (15.38 fish/trapnet) in 2008. Bluegill growth rates in Calhoun Lake were below the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-6, but within the normal ranges for ages 7-8. The 2002 year class comprised 49% of the bluegill catch in the 2008 nets. Abundant numbers of YOY bluegill (43.25 fish/haul, 1.19 inches average length) were captured in 2008 shoreline seine hauls. Approximately 1,316 pounds of small (< 6 inches) adult bluegill (9,212 fish) were removed during the spring of 2007 from Calhoun for stocking into other area lakes with inadequate bluegill natural reproduction. <br> \n <br> \nBlack bullhead were low in 2008 (9.33 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal ranges for Calhoun (25th=9.31, 50th=19.46, 75th=56.70 fish/gillnet) and similar lakes (25th=30.34 fish/gillnet). The 2008 black bullhead trapnet catch was also low (0.29 fish/trapnet). The 2008 black bullhead average size was large (0.70 pounds and 10.39 inches) from gillnets. The black bullhead historical average weight is 0.41 pounds from gillnets. <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species of special interest captured in the 2008 gillnets included moderate numbers of carp (2.00 fish/gillnet), low numbers of pumpkinseed sunfish (2.14 fish/trapnet), and high numbers of yellow bullhead (32.67 fish/gillnet). The Calhoun historical average catch rates were 0.55 carp/gillnet, 15.88 pumpkinseed sunfish/trapnet, and 16.60 yellow bullhead/gillnet. The 2008 average weights were 2.30 pounds, 0.13 pounds, and 0.50 pounds for carp, pumpkinseed sunfish, and yellow bullhead respectively. <br> \n <br> \nCurrent fish management activities on Calhoun Lake include monitoring the fish population on a periodic basis, protecting aquatic vegetation through the permit process, operating the outlet dam to prevent winterkill, and stocking various fish species as warranted. The Calhoun fishery will be surveyed in the 2013 spring and summer for all fish species. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A population assessment of Calhoun Lake was conducted during early July of 2013. Calhoun is a moderately sized (618 acres) and moderately productive lake located in Kandiyohi County. The maximum depth is 13 feet. The immediate watershed is composed of agricultural row crop areas, hardwood tree stands, wetlands, grasslands, and 55 residential homes. The Middle Fork Crow River enters Calhoun along the southwest corner. Calhoun is connected to Green Lake via a bypass channel of the Middle Fork Crow River and the Green Lake outlet marsh. A DNR public access is located along the south shore. Large emergent vegetation (bulrush, cattails) stands are present along the west and south portions of the lake. Water nutrient (total phosphorus=0.022 mg/l) and clarity (secchi=5.5 feet) results were good during July 14, 2013 (MNPCA). Submergent vegetation species are varied and dense (northern milfoil, muskgrass, filamentous algae, water moss, various pondweed species) in Calhoun. Eurasian milfoil was first noted in scattered low densities of Calhoun, especially near the Middle Fork Crow River Inlet area, during 2010. Eurasian milfoil has been present upstream in nearby Green Lake since 2000. Shoalwater substrates consist mostly of sand, silt, and gravel. Calhoun is a popular bluegill, largemouth bass, black crappie and northern pike (spearing and angling) fishery.  <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass numbers were abundant (4.50 fish/gillnet) and the average size was moderate (12.8 inches, 1.16 pounds) in 2013. The Calhoun largemouth bass historical average catch rate is 2.83 fish/gillnet.  <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie numbers were low (2.00 fish/gillnet, 1.67 fish/trapnet), but the average size was moderate (0.54 pounds and 9.33 inches). The black crappie historical average catch rates were 4.39 fish/gillnet and 2.00 fish/trapnet for Calhoun. Black crappie growth rates were below the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-4. The 2008 year class comprised 53% of the 2013 black crappie gillnet and trapnet catch.   <br> \n  <br> \nNorthern pike numbers were exceedingly abundant in 2013 (20.00 fish/gillnet) compared to the historical average (13.65 fish/gillnet) for Calhoun. The northern pike average size was small (1.94 pounds and 20.00 inches) from gillnets. The northern pike historical average weight is 2.49 pounds from gillnets. The 2013 catch rate of larger (>28 inches) northern pike was low to moderate (1.50 fish/gillnet). Northern pike growth rates were below the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-6 except for ages 3-4. Approximately 67% of the northern pike captured in the 2013 summer resurvey nets were from the 2011 year class. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch numbers were low (1.00 fish/gillnet) in 2013. The yellow perch historical average catch rate is 9.27 fish/gillnet for Calhoun. The 2013 yellow perch average size was moderate (0.27 pounds and 8.31 inches) from gillnets.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye numbers were moderately abundant (2.50 fish/gillnet) in 2013 compared to the Calhoun historical average (1.54 fish/gillnet). The 2013 walleye average size was moderately large (1.73 pounds and 16.34 inches) from gillnets. The walleye population is due largely to the recent stockings of larger sized fish that are less susceptible to predation by largemouth bass and northern pike. Walleye growth rates were within the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-4. The 2010 year class comprised 75% of the 2013 walleye catch from gillnets and trapnets. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill numbers were moderate (23.44 fish/trapnet) in 2013. The bluegill historical catch rate is 56.65 fish/trapnet for Calhoun. The 2013 bluegill average size (0.19 pounds and 6.12 inches from trapnets) was above the Calhoun historical average (0.12 pounds). There were moderate numbers of moderated sized (>6 inches) bluegill (14.33 fish/trapnet) captured in 2013. Bluegill growth rates in Calhoun Lake were below the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-5, and within the normal ranges for ages 6-8. The 2008 year class comprised 79% of the total bluegill catch in the 2013 nets. Spicer DNR fisheries personnel had conducted removal operations of smaller bluegill (<6.00 inches) from Calhoun in the past to promote better bluegill growth and for stocking needs in other local lakes lacking suitable natural reproduction/survival, however removal efforts are no longer conducted due to the presence of Eurasian milfoil.  <br> \n <br> \nBlack bullhead numbers were low (0.50 fish/gillnet, 0.44 fish/trapnet) in 2013.  The black bullhead average size was large (1.08 pounds and 12.28 inches) from gillnets.  <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species of special interest captured in the 2013 gillnets included moderate numbers of carp (1.22 fish/trapnet), low numbers of pumpkinseed sunfish (0.78 fish/trapnet), and high numbers of yellow bullhead (25.50 fish/gillnet). The 2013 average weights were 9.13 pounds, 0.28 pounds, and 0.57 pounds for carp, pumpkinseed sunfish, and yellow bullhead respectively. <br> \n <br> \nCurrent fish management activities on Calhoun Lake include monitoring the fish population on a periodic basis, protecting native aquatic vegetation through the permit process, preventing and educating about the spread of invasive species, operating the outlet dam to prevent winterkill, and stocking various fish species as warranted. The Calhoun fishery will be surveyed in the 2018 summer for all fish species. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A standard survey of Calhoun Lake was conducted during early July of 2023. A targeted survey is generally used for sampling a specific kind of fish or time of year (i.e. spawning season, fall season, etc.) unlike a standard survey which samples a wider range of fish species during the summer months using standard methodology (i.e. standard time of year, set sampling stations, taking water clarity readings and oxygen/temperature profiles, etc.) and gears (i.e. lake survey gillnets, trapnets and possibly spring electrofishing for Largemouth Bass). A spring electrofishing survey for Largemouth Bass was not conducted in 2023 due to time constraints. <br> \n <br> \nCalhoun is a moderately sized (618 acers) And moderately productive lake located in Kandiyohi County. The maximum depth is 13 feet. Residential development (51 homes/cabins-2008 resurvey) has occurred primarily along the north and east shoreline areas. The immediate watershed is composed of agricultural row crop drainage into the lake occurs via several inlets/tiles/ditches located along the north, east, and west shore areas. The Middle Fork Crow River enters Calhoun along the southwest corner. Calhoun is connected to Green Lake via a bypass channel of the Middle Fork Crow River and the Green Lake outlet marsh. A dam is located at the outlet on the south shore near the public access. Another dam is on the Middle Fork Crow River downstream of the bypass channel that flows into Calhoun. Water levels were slightly below normal during 2023. A DNR public access is located along the south shore. A township winter access is located on the south shore east of the outlet dam. Early ice out (early-mid march) occurred on area lakes in 2023. Dissolved oxygen was above 9.0 ppm throughout the water column during the 2023 survey. Water nutrient (total phosphorus=0.022 mg/l) results were good during July 23, 2023 (MNPCA). Water clarity (Secchi= 7 feet) was moderate on July 5, 2023. Large emergent vegetation (bulrush, cattails) stands are present along the west and south portions of the lake. Submergent vegetation species are varied and dense (northern milfoil, muskgrass, filamentous algae, water moss, various pondweed species) in Calhoun. Eurasian watermilfoil was first noted in scattered low densities of Calhoun, especially near the Middle Fork Crow River Inlet area, during 2010. Eurasian watermilfoil has been present upstream in nearby Green Lake since 2000. Zebra Mussels were first found upstream if Green Lake in the 2014 fall and are also now present in Calhoun. Shoal water substrates consist mostly of sand, silt, and gravel. Calhoun is a popular Bluegill and Northern Pike fishery but has potential for good Largemouth Bass fishing.  <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass numbers were excellent in 2023 (11.67 fish/gillnet). Largemouth abundance was low (2.00 fish/gillnet) in 2018. The Largemouth Bass historical average catch rate was 3.56 fish/gillnet. The 2023 Largemouth Bass average size was moderate (1.14 pounds and 12.54 inches) from gillnets. The largest Largemouth Bass captured was 18.11 inches. The 2023 survey showed high numbers of quality size Largemouth Bass.  <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie numbers were low in 2023 (2.0 fish/gillnet). The historical average gillnet catch was 4.32 fish/gillnet for Calhoun. The 2023 Black Crappie average size was slightly below average (0.35 pounds and 8.19 inches) from gillnets. Black Crappie growth rates were slower than average. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike numbers were abundant in 2023 (13.33 fish/gillnet) compared to similar lakes. The Northern Pike historical average catch rate is 13.43 fish/gillnet for Callhoun. However, the 2023 Northern Pike average size was small (1.92 pounds and 19.18 inches) from gillnets compared to historical averages (2.33 pounds and 21.01 inches). The largest Northern Pike captured was 30.24 inches. Northern Pike possession limit regulations for Calhoun in the North-central Zone are as follows: 10 (Not more than 2 over 26\". All from 22-26\" must be immediately released.) by angling; 10 (only 1 Northern Pike between 22-26\" and 1 over 26\"; or 2 over 26\") by dark house spearing. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch numbers were moderately low in 2023 (5.00 fish/gillnet). The Yellow Perch historical average catch rate is 8.54 fish/gillnet for Calhoun. The 2023 Yellow Perch average size was moderately large (0.38 pounds and 9.14 inches) from gillnets. The Yellow Perch historical average weight is 0.20 pounds from gillnets. The largest Yellow Perch captured was 11.14 inches. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye numbers were low in 2023 (1.00 fish/gillnet) compared to similar lakes and the lake average (1.53 fish/gillnet). The 2023 Walleye average size was larger (2.77 pounds and 20.17 inches) than the historical average (2.18 pounds and 17.73 inches). Walleye growth rates were average in Calhoun. The 2019 year class comprised 50% of the 2023 Walleye catch from gillnets and trapnets. The largest Walleye captured was 24.06 inches. Walleye fingerlings, yearlings and adults were stocked recently in Calhoun during 2007 (1,557 yearlings, 150 pounds), 2008 (1,998 adults and yearlings, 687 pounds), 2010 (914 adults, 168 pounds; 5,725 fingerlings, 586 pounds), 2012 (2,505 yearlings, 503 pounds; 1,331 fingerlings, 121 pounds), 2014 (80 adults, 106 pounds; 2,481 yearlings, 541 pounds; 898 fingerlings, 98 pounds) and 2017 (71 adults, 51 pounds; 10,420 fingerlings, 614 pounds), 2019 (722 adults, 487 pounds; 1698 fingerlings, 183 pounds). <br> \n <br> \nBluegill numbers were moderately abundant in 2023 (23.89 fish/trapnet) compared to similar lakes. Bluegill numbers are lower than historical average catch rate (52.78 fish/gillnet) on Calhoun. The 2023 Bluegill average size was similar (0.14 pounds and 5.40 inches) to the historic average (0.13 pounds and 5.44 inches). The number of Bluegill over 6.00 inches was low in 2023. The largest Bluegill captured was 8.19 inches. <br> \n <br> \nThe 2023 Black Bullhead catch rate was moderate (19.67 fish/gillnet). The Black Bullhead average size was large (0.77 pounds and 10.98 inches) in gillnets. There was a dramatic increase in Black Bullhead numbers from the 2018 survey (absent) to the 2023 survey.  <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species of special interest captured in 2023 included low numbers of Common Carp (0.11 fish/trapnet), moderate numbers of Pumpkinseed Sunfish (10.67 fish/gillnet), and high numbers of Yellow Bullhead (28.33 fish/gillnet). The historical average catch rates were 0.79 Common Carp/trapnet, 14.05 Pumpkinseed Sunfish/gillnet, and 19.37 Yellow Bullheads/gillnet. The 2023 average weights were 12.18 pounds, 0.18 pounds, and 0.53 pounds for Common Carp, Pumpkinseed Sunfish, and Yellow Bullhead respectfully. <br> \n <br> \nCurrent fish management activities on Calhoun Lake include monitoring the fish population on a periodic basis, protecting aquatic vegetation through the permit process, preventing and educating about the spread of invasive species, operating the outlet dam to prevent winterkill, and stocking various fish species as warranted. The Calhoun fishery will be surveyed in the 2028 summer for all fish species. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of nearshore fish species in Calhoun Lake was conducted on August 28, 2017 by Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program Staff.  Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible.  Backpack electrofishing was completed at 14 sampling stations, but three stations were sampled from the boat due to site conditions.  Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample 11 stations and site conditions prevented the use of seines at three stations.  Nearshore sampling captured 18 species of fish including six species that are intolerant of disturbance (Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, and Pugnose Shiner) and one that is tolerant of disturbance (Green Sunfish). <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore data were combined with trap net and gill net data from a July 2013 survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based IBI (FIBI) score.  The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment.  In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g. Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, and Rock Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g. Black Bullhead, Common Carp, and Green Sunfish).  The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake.  For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.   <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey indicates Calhoun Lake is in good health as indicated by an FIBI score above the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes.  Data from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the North Fork Crow River Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Calhoun is a shallow (maximum depth 13 feet), moderate sized lake (618 acres) withabundant submergent and emergent vegetation. Nutrient levels (phosphorous) were moderate andwater clarity was fair. The Middle Fork of the Crow River (MFCR) flows from Green Lake (34-079) into a large marsh complex which connects to Calhoun. The marsh complex is an importantnorthern pike spawning area for fish from both Green Lake and Calhoun. Although the mainchannel bypasses Calhoun, a side channel connects to the southwest corner of Calhoun Lake.The Middle Fork of the Crow River eventually flows to the North Fork of the Crow River. Thereare two fixed sill dams which control water levels (Middle Fork of Crow River dam west of theaccess bridge, Calhoun Outlet Dam on the south shore). Nutrient runoff occurs mainly from theMFCR, County Ditch #26 (northeast shore), and a small inlet along the northeast corner. Thereis also a small marsh originated inlet along the north shore. Periodic winterkills haveoccurred with the most recent during the drought years of 1988-89. During normal/high waterlevel years, sufficient oxygenated water can be pulled into Calhoun from Green Lake byopening of the Calhoun Dam gate. The immediate watershed is mostly agriculture, marshlands,and mixed upland hardwoods. The shoreline is a mixture of mixed hardwoods, upland grasses,marsh area, and lake lots on slight to moderate slopes. The shoalwater substrates are mostlysand, silt, and marl. Hardstem bulrush is abundant along the south portion of the lake.Yellow water lily is abundant along the southwest and west shores. Submergent vegetation(muskgrass, claspingleaf pondweed, bladderwort, sago pondweed, northern water milfoil, bushypondweed, coontail, various other species) is abundant throughout the lake, especially in thesouthwest inlet bay area. Filamentous algae is abundant along the west and north shores(adjacent to a farm site and County Ditch #26). Filamentous algae is often an indicator ofexcessive nutrient (nitrogen) inputs occurring within a system. Development along the lakeis relatively minor (1987 survey: 36 homes). Calhoun is a popular northern pike (angling anddarkhouse spearing), largemouth, black crappie, and bluegill fishery. Limiting factors forCalhoun include increasing nutrient runoff, occasional winterkill, and overabundance of smallblack bullhead. Fisheries management activities have included stocking (especially afterwinterkill) of various species, opening of Calhoun Dam gate during the winter, fishpopulation assessments through lake surveys and specialized sampling, and the issuance of B-Permits for removal of carp/bullheads. Currently, Calhoun is being intensively sampled (creelsurveys, lake surveys, etc.) in conjunction with Green Lake to determine the extent of fishmovement (northern pike, largemouth bass, smallmouth bass) between the two lakes.Experimental regulations will probably go into effect during 1997 or 1998 on Green Lake fornorthern pike, smallmouth bass, and largemouth bass in order to potentially produce trophyfish. Calhoun may also be included with Green for experimental regulations of the previouslymentioned species.     Northern pike abundance in 1994 (11.2 fish/gillnet) was above the normal range (1.1 -8.0 fish/gillnet) for similar lakes, but the same as the historical average (11.2fish/gillnet). The 1994 average size (2.4 lbs from gillnets) was above the 1992 survey (1.9lbs), but similar to the 1987 survey (2.5 lbs). The largest fish captured was 29.5 inches.Growth rates appear average. There are several areas conducive for northern pike spawning(MFCR marsh complex, several inlet marshes/ditches). Fish movement can occur over the twodams into Calhoun from the downstream portions of the MFCR during high water. The MFCRportion below the Calhoun dam has been a source for northern pike spawning area (NPSA) broodstock, however this run has significantly dropped in the last two springs.     Bluegill abundance in 1994 (20.1 fish/trapnet) was slightly above the normal range (1.2- 20.0 fish/trapnet) for similar lakes and was the highest recorded value (historicalaverage=16.2 fish/trapnet). The 1994 average size (4.8 inches from gillnets and trapnetscombined) was below the historical average (5.3 inches). The largest bluegill caught was 7.4inches. Growth rates appear below average.     Black crappie abundance in 1994 (1.4 fish/gillnet) was within the normal range (1.4 -13.8 fish/gillnet) for similar lakes, but below the historical average (5.2 fish/gillnet).The 1994 average size (8.6 inches) was slightly above the historical average. The largestblack crappie caught was 12.6 inches. Growth rates appear average.     The largemouth bass spring electrofishing catch rate (14.1 fish/hour) was moderate andsimilar to the 1992 survey (13.6 fish/hour). The 1994 average size (1.2 lbs) from springelectrofishing was slightly greater than the 1992 survey (0.9 lbs). Growth rates appearaverage.     Yellow perch abundance in 1994 (9.6 fish/gillnet) was within the normal range (2.7 -25.0 fish/gillnet) for similar lakes and comparable to the historical average (9.5fish/gillnet). The 1994 average size (7.1 inches from gillnets and trapnets combined)was slightly above the historical average (6.8 inches). Growth rates appear average.     Walleye abundance in 1994 (0.8 fish/gillnet) was below the normal range (2.3 - 18.1fish/gillnet) for similar lakes and below the historical average (1.8 fish/gillnet). The 1994average size (3.1 lbs from gillnets and trapnets combined) was slightly above the historicalaverage (2.6 lbs).     Black bullhead abundance in 1994 (47.0 fish/gillnet) was within the normal range (30.3-150.6 fish/gillnet) for similar lakes, but below the historical average (81.5 fish/gillnet).The 1994 black bullhead average size (0.3 lbs) was same as the historical average. Brownbullhead abundance in 1994 (5.2 fish/gillnet) was within the normal range (0.5 - 5.6fish/gillnet) for similar lakes, but slightly below the historical average (4.5fish/gillnet). The 1994 average brown bullhead size (0.3 lbs) was below the historicalaverage (0.6 lbs). The 1994 yellow bullhead abundance (6.4 fish/gillnet) was above the normalrange (0.5 - 3.5 fish/gillnet) for similar lakes, but below the historical average (9.8fish/gillnet). The 1994 yellow bullhead average size (0.4 lbs) was same as the historicalaverage.     Carp abundance in 1994 (0.2 fish/trapnet) was below the normal range (1.0 - 5.5fish/trapnet) for similar lakes and below the historical average (0.7 fish/trapnet). The 1994average size (trapnets) was 6.9 lbs.     Calhoun is a relatively undeveloped lake with abundant stands of hardstem bulrush.Panfish, largemouth bass, and northern pike are popular fish species that people mostcommonly angle for in Calhoun. A popular shore fishing site is below the Calhoun Dam (MFCR).It appears that northern pike and bluegill have rebounded to the pre-1987 winterkill levels.However, black crappie numbers have been low even though extensive black crappie broodstocking occurred after the winterkill (418 yearlings in 1989, 219 yearlings in 1990, 10,855yearlings in 1992, 3,211 adults in 1993). Largemouth bass numbers also appear lower than pre-1987 winterkill levels. Limiting factors affecting water quality, gamefish populations, andangling include high nutrient inputs from the county ditch and the MFCR, excessive submergentvegetation densities that limit navigation and boating, an abundance of small black bullhead,and periodic winterkill during drought conditions. Aeration is an option, however the abilityto pull good oxygenated water from Green and the low frequency of drought conditions (every10-20 years) does not make aeration cost effective. Management priorities should includemaintaining important hardstem bulrush habitat; reducing nutrient inputs by encouraging areafarmers/lakeshore owners to use best land management practices (updating inadequate septicsystems, using low/no phosphorous fertilizers, conservational tillage, planting bufferstrips, proper feedlot management, and proper manure disposal/application); maintaining orimproving good numbers and sizes of gamefish (largemouth bass, northern pike, bluegill, blackcrappie) through stocking, habitat manipulation, or regulations.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A standard survey of Calhoun Lake was conducted during late June of 2018. A targeted survey is generally used for sampling a specific kind of fish or time of year (i.e. spawning season, fall season, etc.) unlike a standard survey which samples a wider range of fish species during the summer months using standard methodology (i.e. standard time of year, set sampling stations, taking water clarity readings and oxygen/temperature profiles, etc.) and gears (i.e. lake survey gillnets, trapnets and possibly spring electrofishing for Largemouth Bass). A spring electrofishing survey for Largemouth Bass was not conducted in 2018 due to time constraints. <br> \n <br> \nCalhoun is a moderately sized (618 acres) and moderately productive lake located in Kandiyohi County. The maximum depth is 13 feet. Residential development (51 homes/cabins-2008 resurvey) has occurred primarily along the north and east shoreline areas. The immediate watershed is composed of agricultural row crop areas, hardwood tree stands, wetlands, grasslands, and residential homes. Agricultural row crop drainage into the lake occurs via several inlets/tiles/ditches located along the north, east, and west shore areas. The Middle Fork Crow River enters Calhoun along the southwest corner. Calhoun is connected to Green Lake via a bypass channel of the Middle Fork Crow River and the Green Lake outlet marsh. A dam is located at the outlet on the south shore near the public access. Another dam is located on the Middle Fork Crow River downstream of the bypass channel that flows into Calhoun. Water levels were slightly above normal during the 2018. A DNR public access is located along the south shore. Late ice out (late April-early May) occurred on area lakes in 2018. Dissolved oxygen was above 5.0 ppm throughout the water column during the 2018 survey. Water nutrient (total phosphorus=0.022 mg/l) results were good during July 14, 2013 (MNPCA). Water clarity (secchi=6.5 feet) was moderate on June 27, 2018. Large emergent vegetation (bulrush, cattails) stands are present along the west and south portions of the lake. Submergent vegetation species are varied and dense (northern milfoil, muskgrass, filamentous algae, water moss, various pondweed species) in Calhoun. Eurasian watermilfoil was first noted in scattered low densities of Calhoun, especially near the Middle Fork Crow River Inlet area, during 2010. Eurasian watermilfoil has been present upstream in nearby Green Lake since 2000. Zebra Mussels were first found upstream of Green Lake in the 2014 fall and are also now present in Calhoun. Shoalwater substrates consist mostly of sand, silt, and gravel. Calhoun is a popular Bluegill and Northern Pike fishery. Local anglers reported moderate success catching adult Walleye in recent years. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass abundance in 2018 (2.00 fish/gillnet) was near the 25th quartile (25th=2.05, 50th=2.33, 75th=3.19 fish/gillnet) for Calhoun and above the 75th quartile (1.50 fish/gillnet) for Lake Class 43 lakes. Largemouth Bass abundance was high (4.50 fish/gillnet) in 2013. The Largemouth Bass historical average catch rate was 2.75 fish/gillnet.

The Northern Pike historical average catch rate is 13.44 fish/gillnet for Calhoun. The 2018 Northern Pike average weight and length were 1.21 pounds and 16.50 inches respectively from gillnets. The Northern Pike historical average weight is 2.36 pounds from gillnets. The 2018 catch rate of quality size (21.00 inches and larger) Northern Pike was 3.00 fish/gillnet. The 2018 catch rate of preferred size (28.00 inches and larger) Northern Pike was 0.00 fish/gillnet. Northern Pike growth rates were below the Spicer Area 25th quartiles for ages 1-6. Approximately 48% of the Northern Pike captured in the 2018 summer survey nets were from the 2015 year class.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch abundance in 2018 (5.50 fish/gillnet) was slightly below the 50th quartiles for Calhoun (25th=1.50, 50th=6.08, 75th=11.55 fish/gillnet) and Lake Class 43 lakes (50th=8.00 fish/gillnet).

Walleye fingerlings, yearlings and adults were stocked recently in Calhoun during 2007 (1,557 yearlings, 150 pounds), 2008 (1,998 adults and yearlings, 687 pounds), 2010 (914 adults, 168 pounds; 5,725 fingerlings, 586 pounds), 2012 (2,505 yearlings, 503 pounds; 1,331 fingerlings, 121 pounds), 2014 (80 adults, 106 pounds; 2,481 yearlings, 541 pounds; 898 fingerlings, 98 pounds) and 2017 (71 adults, 51 pounds; 10,420 fingerlings, 614 pounds). <br> \n <br> \nBluegill abundance in 2018 (35.78 fish/trapnet) was above the 50th quartile for Calhoun (25th=20.94, 50th=31.50, 75th=55.29 fish/trapnet), and above the 75th quartile (75th=20.00 fish/trapnet) for Lake Class 43 lakes. The Bluegill historical catch rate is 54.56 fish/trapnet for Calhoun. Abundant numbers of large Bluegill (13.50 fish/gillnet, 0.24 pounds) were also captured in the 2018 gillnets. The 2018 Bluegill average weight and length were 0.25 pounds and 6.81 inches respectively from trapnets. The Bluegill historical average weight is 0.13 pounds from trapnets. The 2018 catch rate of quality size (6.00 inches and larger) Bluegill was 32.35 fish/trapnet. Bluegill growth rates in Calhoun Lake were below the Spicer Area 25th quartiles for ages 1-4, and between the 25th and 50th quartiles for ages 5-8. The 2010 year class comprised 49% of the total Bluegill catch in the 2018 survey nets. Approximately 1,316 pounds of small (< 6 inches) adult Bluegill (9,212 fish) were removed during the spring of 2004 from Calhoun for stocking into other area lakes with inadequate Bluegill natural reproduction. Also, approximately 252 pounds (1,008 fish) of small Bluegill were removed in 2009 from Calhoun for stocking into other area lakes. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Bullhead abundance in 2018 (0.00 fish/gillnet) was below the 25th quartiles for Calhoun (25th=6.56, 50th=13.79, 75th=40.42 fish/gillnet) and Lake Class 43 lakes (25th=30.34 fish/gillnet). The 2018 Black Bullhead trapnet catch was also low (0.11 fish/trapnet). The 2018 Black Bullhead average weight and length were 0.11 pounds and 5.91 inches respectively from trapnets.  <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species of special interest captured in 2018 included moderate numbers of Common Carp (1.56 fish/trapnet), high numbers of Pumpkinseed Sunfish (35.00 fish/gillnet), and high numbers of Yellow Bullhead (26.50 fish/gillnet). The Calhoun historical average catch rates were 0.85 Common Carp/trapnet, 14.39 Pumpkinseed Sunfish/gillnet, and 18.48 Yellow Bullhead/gillnet. The 2018 average weights were 7.07 pounds, 0.23 pounds, and 0.59 pounds for Common Carp, Pumpkinseed Sunfish, and Yellow Bullhead respectively. <br> \n <br> \nCurrent fish management activities on Calhoun Lake include monitoring the fish population on a periodic basis, protecting aquatic vegetation through the permit process, preventing and educating about the spread of invasive species, operating the outlet dam to prevent winterkill, and stocking various fish species as warranted. The Calhoun fishery will be surveyed in the 2023 summer for all fish species. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Calhoun is a shallow (maximum depth 13 feet), moderate sized lake (618 acres) withabundant submergent and emergent vegetation. Total phosphorus levels were moderate (0.025ppm) and water clarity was fair (4.0 feet) on June 13, 1994. The Middle Fork of the CrowRiver (MFCR) flows from Green Lake (34-079) into a large marsh complex. The marsh complex isan important northern pike spawning area for fish from both Green Lake and Calhoun. Althoughthe main channel bypasses Calhoun, a side channel connects to the southwest corner of CalhounLake. The Middle Fork of the Crow River eventually flows to the North Fork of the Crow River.There are two fixed sill dams which control water levels (Middle Fork of Crow River dam westof the access bridge, Calhoun Outlet Dam on the south shore). Nutrient runoff occurs mainlyfrom the MFCR, County Ditch #26 (northeast shore), and a small inlet along the northeastcorner. There is also a small marsh originated inlet along the north shore. Periodicwinterkills have occurred with the most recent during the drought years of 1988-89. Duringnormal/high water level years, sufficient oxygenated water can be pulled into Calhoun fromGreen Lake by opening of the Calhoun Dam gate. The immediate watershed is mostly agriculture,marshlands, and mixed upland hardwoods. The shoreline is a mixture of mixed hardwoods, uplandgrasses, marsh area, and lake lots on slight to moderate slopes. The shoalwater substratesare mostly sand, silt, and marl. Hardstem bulrush is abundant along the south portion of thelake. Yellow water lily is abundant along the southwest and west shores. Submergentvegetation (muskgrass, claspingleaf pondweed, bladderwort, sago pondweed, northern watermilfoil, bushy pondweed, coontail, various other species) is abundant throughout the lake,especially in the southwest inlet bay area. Filamentous algae is abundant along the west andnorth shores (adjacent to a farm site and County Ditch #26). Filamentous algae is often anindicator of excessive nutrient (nitrogen) inputs occurring within a system. Developmentalong the lake is relatively minor (1987 survey: 36 homes). Calhoun is a popular northernpike (summer angling and winter darkhouse spearing), largemouth, black crappie, and bluegillfishery. Fisheries management activities have included stocking (especially after winterkill)of various species, opening of the Calhoun Dam gate during the winter to allow inflow ofoxygenated water, fish population assessments through lake surveys and specialized sampling,and the issuance of B-Permits for removal of carp/bullheads. Calhoun was intensively sampled(creel surveys, lake surveys, etc.) in conjunction with Green Lake to determine the extentof northern pike movement between the two lakes. It was determined that fish movement betweenthe two lakes was minimal. Experimental regulations will go into effect on May 10, 1997 onnearby Green Lake for northern pike (fish 24.0 inches and larger must be released), and May31, 1997 for smallmouth bass and largemouth bass (catch and release only) in order topotentially produce more trophy fish. Calhoun will not be included with Green Lake forexperimental regulations of the previously mentioned species due to minimal movement ofnorthern pike between the two lakes.     Northern pike abundance in 1996 (8.0 fish/gillnet) was within the 1st and 3rd medianinterquartile range (1.1 - 8.0 fish/gillnet) for Lake Class 43, but below the historicalaverage (12.7 fish/gillnet). The 1996 average size (2.9 lbs from gillnets) was above thehistorical average (2.4 lbs). The largest fish captured was 28.5 inches. The 1996 PSD andRSD-P (gillnets and trapnets combined) was 79.4 and 2.9 respectively. Growth rates appearaverage compared to other local lakes. About 44% of the fish captured belonged to the 1993year class. There are several areas conducive for northern pike spawning (MFCR marsh complex,several inlet marshes/ditches). Fish movement can occur over the two dams into Calhoun fromthe downstream portions of the MFCR during high water. The MFCR portion below the Calhoun damhad been a source for northern pike spawning area (NPSA) brood stock, however this run hassignificantly dropped off during the last several springs.     Bluegill abundance in 1996 (88.1 fish/trapnet) was above the 1st and 3rd medianinterquartile range (1.2 - 20.0 fish/trapnet) for Lake Class 43, and above the historicalaverage (70.5 fish/trapnet). The 1996 bluegill catch rates were probably much higher thanprevious surveys (1987, 1992, 1994) in part because past surveys were conducted in Augustwhen bluegill catch rates are substantially lower than during June. Although bluegill arestill abundant within Calhoun, the numbers were lower than the 1995 survey. The SpicerFisheries Crew removed about 11,020 small adult bluegill (average size=0.1 lbs) during lateJune - early July of 1996 and stocked these fish into area lakes with low bluegillpopulations. The removal of bluegill was done in order to promote bluegill growth withinCalhoun and provide other lakes with limited bluegill fisheries. The 1996 average size (5.2inches from gillnets and trapnets combined) was the same as the historical average (5.2inches). The largest bluegill caught was 8.3 inches. The 1996 PSD and RSD-P (gillnets andtrapnets combined) was 16.8 and 0.5 respectively (gillnets and trapnets combined). Growthrates appear below average compared to other area lakes. About 91% of the bluegill capturedin the 1996 survey were age V plus.     Black crappie abundance in 1996 (0.8 fish/gillnet) was below the 1st and 3rd medianinterquartile range (1.4 - 13.8 fish/gillnet) for Lake Class 43, and below the historicalaverage (3.3 fish/gillnet). The 1996 average size was (6.5 inches from gillnets and trapnetscombined) below the historical average (7.8 inches). The largest black crappie captured inthe 1996 survey was 8.7 inches. The 1996 PSD and RSD-P (gillnets and trapnets combined) was14.3 and 0 respectively. Growth rates appear average compared to other local lakes. About 86%of the fish captured belonged to the 1994 year class.       The largemouth bass spring electrofishing catch rate (11.0 fish/hour) was similar to thehistorical average (11.3 fish/hour), but below the local area median catch rate (25.9fish/hour). The 1996 average size (0.6 lbs) from spring electrofishing was slightly below thehistorical average (0.9 lbs). The largest fish captured during the spring electrofishingsurvey was 17.5 inches. The 1996 PSD and RSD-P from spring electrofishing was 25.0 and 12.5respectively. Growth rates appear slightly below average for age III. About 55% of the fishcaptured belonged to the 1994 year class.     Yellow perch abundance in 1996 (15.5 fish/gillnet) was within the 1st and 3rd medianinterquartile range (2.7 - 25.0 fish/gillnet) for Lake Class 43, and similar to thehistorical average (15.7 fish/gillnet). The 1996 average size (6.8 inches from gillnets andtrapnets combined) was the same as the historical average. The 1996 PSD and RSD-P (gillnetsand trapnets combined) was 18.5 and 0 respectively. Growth rates appear average compared toother local lakes. About 43% of the fish captured belonged to the 1992 year class.     Walleye abundance in the 1996 (0.3 fish/gillnet) was below the 1st and 3rd medianinterquartile range (2.3 - 18.1 fish/gillnet) for Lake Class 43, and below the historicalaverage (1.1 fish/gillnet). The highest walleye abundance in Calhoun occurred in 1987 (3.3fish/gillnet). The 1996 average size (1.0 lbs from gillnets) was below the historical average(2.2 lbs). Presently, Calhoun is not being managed for walleye, thus no stocking is takingplace.     Black bullhead abundance in 1996 (18.3 fish/gillnet) was below the 1st and 3rd medianinterquartile range (30.3 -150.6 fish/gillnet) for Lake Class 43, and below the historicalaverage (56.7 fish/gillnet). The 1996 black bullhead average size (8.3 inches from gillnetsand trapnets combined) was slightly above the historical average (8.0 inches). Brown bullheadabundance in 1996 (1.8 fish/gillnet) was within the 1st and 3rd median interquartile range(0.5 - 5.6 fish/gillnet) for Lake Class 43, but below the historical average (6.4fish/gillnet). The 1996 average brown bullhead size (9.1 inches from gillnets and trapnetscombined) was above the historical average (8.7 inches). The 1996 yellow bullhead abundance(3.4 fish/gillnet) was within the 1st and 3rd median interquartile range (0.5 - 3.5fish/gillnet) for Lake Class 43, but below the historical average (8.2 fish/gillnet). The1996 yellow bullhead average size (8.9 inches from gillnets and trapnets combined) was thesame as the historical average (8.9 inches).     Carp abundance in 1996 (1.2 fish/trapnet) was within the 1st and 3rd medianinterquartile range (1.0 - 5.5 fish/trapnet) for Lake Class 43, but slightly above thehistorical average (0.9 fish/trapnet). The 1996 average size (8.9 lbs from trapnets) wasabove the historical average (5.6 lbs).     Calhoun is a relatively undeveloped lake with abundant stands of hardstem bulrush.Panfish, largemouth bass, and northern pike are popular fish species that people mostcommonly angle for in Calhoun. A popular shore fishing site is below the Calhoun Dam (MFCR).Black crappie numbers have remained low even though extensive black crappie brood stockingoccurred after the 1988-89 winterkill (418 yearling in 1989, 219 yearlings in 1990, 10,855yearlings in 1992, 3,211 adults in 1993). Largemouth bass numbers appear moderate. Although,northern pike numbers declined in 1996, the average size increased compared to the 1995survey. Bluegill abundance has decreased and the average size increased slightly in 1996compared to 1995, but there are still many small stunted bluegill present. Some of theproblems affecting Calhoun include: high nutrient inputs from agricultural runoff via thecounty ditch; excessive submergent vegetation growth that limits natural predation of smallpanfish resulting in stunted growth; limited boat navigation due to abundant submergentvegetation growth; periodic winterkill during drought conditions. Aeration is an option,however the ability to pull good oxygenated water from Green and the low frequency of droughtconditions (every 10-20 years) does not make aeration cost effective. Management prioritiesshould include maintaining important hardstem bulrush habitat; reducing nutrient inputs byencouraging area landowners to use best land management practices (updating inadequate septicsystems, using low/no phosphorous fertilizers, conservation tillage, planting buffer strips,proper feedlot management, and proper manure disposal/application); maintaining or improvinggood numbers and sizes of gamefish (largemouth bass, northern pike, bluegill, black crappie)through stocking, habitat manipulation, or regulations.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A fish resurvey of Calhoun Lake was conducted in July of 2003. Calhoun is a moderate sized (618 acres) and moderately productive lake located in Kandiyohi County. The maximum depth is 13 feet. Residential development (53 homes/cabins) has occurred primarily along the north and east shoreline areas. Agricultural row crop drainage into the lake occurs via several inlets/tiles/ditches located along the north, east, and west shore areas. The Middle Fork of Crow River enters Calhoun along the southwest corner. Calhoun is connected to Green Lake via the Middle Fork Crow River and the Green Lake outlet marsh. Water levels were normal during the 2003 spring and early summer, but low by fall due to drought conditions. A DNR public access is located along the south shore. Large emergent vegetation (bulrush, cattails) stands were present along the west and south portions of the lake. Water quality and clarity (secchi=5.7 feet) were moderate during June of 2003. Submergent vegetation densities (northern milfoil, muskgrass, filamentous algae, various pondweed species) were abundant in 2003. Shoalwater substrates consisted mostly of sand, detritus, gravel, and silt. Calhoun is a popular bluegill and northern pike fishery.Largemouth bass numbers were moderate to high in the 2003 summer resurvey nets (2.3 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes. The largemouth bass historical average catch rate is 2.2 fish/gillnet. The 2003 largemouth bass average size was moderate (1.30 pounds and 12.6 inches) from gillnets. Largemouth bass growth rates in Calhoun were generally within the normal ranges compared to area lakes. Black crappie numbers were moderate in 2003 (4.0 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes. The black crappie historical average catch rate is 3.3 fish/gillnet for Calhoun. The 2003 black crappie average size was small (0.19 pounds and 7.2 inches) from gillnets. The largest black crappie captured in the 2003 Calhoun resurvey was 10.4 inches. Black crappie growth rates in Calhoun were below the normal ranges for ages 1-4 compared to area lakes. Northern pike numbers were high in 2003 (16.3 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes. The northern pike historical average catch rate is 12.7 fish/gillnet for Calhoun. The 2003 northern pike average size was moderate (2.94 pounds and 23.4 inches) from gillnets. The northern pike historical average weight is 2.54 pounds from gillnets. The catch rate of quality size (21.0 inches) and larger northern pike was high (12.7 fish/gillnet). The largest northern pike captured in the 2003 nets was 31.9 inches. Northern pike growth rates in Calhoun were near the low end of the normal ranges for ages 1-5 compared to area lakes. Approximately 56% of the northern pike captured in the 2003 summer resurvey nets were from the 2001 year class.Yellow perch numbers were low in 2003 (0.3 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes. The yellow perch historical average catch rate is 11.4 fish/gillnet for Calhoun. The 2003 yellow perch average length was small (5.8 inches) from gillnets and trapnets combined. Walleye numbers were low in 2003 (0.3 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes. The walleye historical catch rate for Calhoun is low (1.0 fish/gillnet). Bluegill numbers were high in 2003 compared to the normal range for similar lakes. The bluegill historical average catch rate is 62.5 fish/trapnet for Calhoun. The 2003 bluegill average size was small (0.11 lbs. and 5.2 inches) from trapnets. The bluegill historical average weight is also small (0.11 pounds) from trapnets. The catch rate of quality size (6.0 inches) and larger bluegill was moderate (9.0 fish/trapnet) in 2003. The largest bluegill captured in the 2003 nets was 7.8 inches. Bluegill growth rates in Calhoun Lake were below the normal ranges for ages 1-5 compared to area lakes. Approximately 928 pounds of small (<6 inches) adult bluegill (9,280 fish) were removed during the spring of 2003 from Calhoun for stocking into other area lakes with inadequate bluegill natural reproduction.Black bullhead numbers were low in 2003 (5.7 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes. The black bullhead historical average catch rate is 42.6 fish/gillnet for Calhoun. The 2003 black bullhead average size was moderate to large (0.57 pounds and 9.9 inches) from gillnets. Other fish species of special interest captured in the 2003 gillnets included moderate numbers of brown bullhead (6.7 fish/gillnet) and high numbers of yellow bullhead (33.7 fish/gillnet). The Calhoun historical average catch rates were 6.4 brown bullhead/gillnet and 14.3 yellow bullhead/gillnet. The 2003 average weights were moderate to large for brown bullhead and yellow bullhead respectively (0.67 pounds and 0.46 pounds).Current fish management activities on Calhoun Lake include monitoring the fish population on a periodic basis, protecting aquatic vegetation through the permit process, operating the outlet dam to prevent winterkill, and stocking various fish species as warranted. The Calhoun fishery will be surveyed in the 2007 spring and summer for all fish species.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Calhoun is a shallow (maximum depth 13 feet), moderate sized lake (618 acres) withabundant submergent and emergent vegetation. Nutrient levels are moderate and water clarityfair. The Middle Fork of the Crow River (MFCR) flows from Green Lake (34-079) into a largemarsh complex. The marsh complex is an important northern pike spawning area for fish fromboth Green Lake and Calhoun. Although the main channel bypasses Calhoun, a side channelconnects to the southwest corner of Calhoun Lake. The Middle Fork of the Crow Rivereventually flows to the North Fork of the Crow River. There are two fixed sill dams whichcontrol water levels (Middle Fork of Crow River dam west of the access bridge, Calhoun OutletDam on the south shore). Nutrient runoff occurs mainly from the MFCR, County Ditch #26(northeast shore), and a small inlet along the northeast corner. There is also a small marshoriginated inlet along the north shore. Periodic winterkills have occurred with the mostrecent during the drought years of 1988-89. During normal/high water level years, sufficientoxygenated water can be pulled into Calhoun from Green Lake by opening of the Calhoun Damgate. The immediate watershed is mostly agriculture, marshlands, and mixed upland hardwoods.The shoreline is a mixture of mixed hardwoods, upland grasses, marsh area, and lake lots onslight to moderate slopes. The shoalwater substrates are mostly sand, silt, and marl.Hardstem bulrush is abundant along the south portion of the lake. Yellow water lily isabundant along the southwest and west shores. Submergent vegetation (muskgrass, claspingleafpondweed, bladderwort, sago pondweed, northern water milfoil, bushy pondweed, coontail,various other species) is abundant throughout the lake, especially in the southwest inlet bayarea. Filamentous algae is abundant along the west and north shores (adjacent to a farm siteand County Ditch #26). Filamentous algae is often an indicator of excessive nutrient(nitrogen) inputs occurring within a system. Development along the lake is relatively minor(1987 survey: 36 homes). Calhoun is a popular northern pike (summer angling and winterdarkhouse spearing), largemouth, black crappie, and bluegill fishery. Limiting factors forCalhoun include eutrophication, occasional winterkill, and overabundance of small blackbullhead. Fisheries management activities have included stocking (especially afterwinterkill) of various species, opening of the Calhoun Dam gate during the winter, fishpopulation assessments through lake surveys and specialized sampling, and the issuance of B-Permits for removal of carp/bullheads. Currently, Calhoun is being intensively sampled (creelsurveys, lake surveys, etc.) in conjunction with Green Lake to determine the extent of fishmovement (northern pike, largemouth bass, smallmouth bass) between the two lakes.Experimental regulations will probably go into effect during 1997 or 1998 on Green Lake fornorthern pike, smallmouth bass, and largemouth bass in order to potentially produce moretrophy fish. Calhoun may also be included with Green for experimental regulations of thepreviously mentioned species.     Northern pike abundance in 1995 (22.0 fish/gillnet) was above the normal range (1.1 -8.0 fish/gillnet) for similar lakes, and above the historical average (13.9 fish/gillnet).The 1995 average size (2.4 lbs from gillnets) was similar to the historical average (2.3lbs). The largest fish captured was 29.7 inches. Growth rates appear average. There areseveral areas conducive for northern pike spawning (MFCR marsh complex, several inletmarshes/ditches). Fish movement can occur over the two dams into Calhoun from the downstreamportions of the MFCR during high water. The MFCR portion below the Calhoun dam has been asource for northern pike spawning area (NPSA) brood stock, however this run has significantlydropped in the last two springs.     Bluegill abundance in 1995 (215.8 fish/trapnet) was above the normal range (1.2 - 20.0fish/trapnet) for similar lakes and was the highest recorded value (historical average=66.2fish/trapnet). The 1995 average size (4.9 inches from gillnets and trapnets combined) wasslightly below the historical average (5.2 inches). The largest bluegill caught was 7.7inches. Growth rates appear below average.     Black crappie abundance in 1995 (0.3 fish/gillnet) was below the normal range (1.4 -13.8 fish/gillnet) for similar lakes, and below the historical average (4.0 fish/gillnet).The 1995 average size was 11.1 inches.        The largemouth bass spring electrofishing catch rate (6.5 fish/hour) was low comparedto historical average (11.4 fish/hour) and the local \"bass\" lake average (41.7 fish/hour).The 1995 average size (0.7 lbs) from spring electrofishing was slightly below the historicalaverage (0.9 lbs). Growth rates appear slightly below average.     Yellow perch abundance in 1995 (34.7 fish/gillnet) was above the normal range (2.7 -25.0 fish/gillnet) for similar lakes and above the historical average (15.8 fish/gillnet).The 1995 average size (7.0 inches from gillnets and trapnets combined) was slightly above thehistorical average (6.8 inches). Growth rates appear average.     Walleye were not captured in the 1995 gillnet or trapnet survey nets. The walleye catchrate normal range is 2.3 - 18.1 fish/gillnet for similar lakes. The historical walleye catchrate average is 1.3 fish/gillnet in Calhoun. Walleye have never been abundant in Calhoun.      Black bullhead abundance in 1995 (20.7 fish/gillnet) was below the normal range (30.3 -150.6 fish/gillnet) for similar lakes, and below the historical average (66.3 fish/gillnet).The 1995 black bullhead average size (8.0 inches) was similar to the historical average (7.9inches). Brown bullhead abundance in 1995 (16.7 fish/gillnet) was above the normal range (0.5- 5.6 fish/gillnet) for similar lakes, and above the historical average (7.5 fish/gillnet).The 1995 average brown bullhead size (8.4 inches) was similar to the historical average (8.6inches). The 1995 yellow bullhead abundance (8.0 fish/gillnet) was above the normal range(0.5 - 3.5 fish/gillnet) for similar lakes, but slightly below the historical average (9.3fish/gillnet). The 1995 yellow bullhead average size (8.4 inches) was slightly below thehistorical average (8.9 inches).     Carp abundance in 1995 (1.2 fish/trapnet) was within the normal range (1.0 - 5.5fish/trapnet) for similar lakes, but slightly above the historical average (0.8fish/trapnet). The 1995 average size (trapnets) was 6.8 lbs.     Calhoun is a relatively undeveloped lake with abundant stands of hardstem bulrush.Panfish, largemouth bass, and northern pike are popular fish species that people mostcommonly angle for in Calhoun. A popular shore fishing site is below the Calhoun Dam (MFCR).It appears that northern pike and bluegill have rebounded to the pre-1987 winterkill levels.However, black crappie numbers have been low even though extensive black crappie broodstocking occurred after the winterkill (418 yearling in 1989, 219 yearlings in 1990, 10,855yearlings in 1992, 3,211 adults in 1993). Largemouth bass numbers also appear slightly lowerthan pre-1987 winterkill levels. Limiting factors presently affecting water quality, gamefishpopulations, and angling include high nutrient inputs from the county ditch and the MFCR,excessive submergent vegetation densities that limit navigation and boating, and periodicwinterkill during drought conditions. Aeration is an option, however the ability to pull goodoxygenated water from Green and the low frequency of drought conditions (every 10-20 years)does not make aeration cost effective. Management priorities should include maintainingimportant hardstem bulrush habitat; reducing nutrient inputs by encouraging areafarmers/lakeshore owners to use best land management practices (updating inadequate septicsystems, using low/no phosphorous fertilizers, conservational tillage, planting bufferstrips, proper feedlot management, and proper manure disposal/application); maintaining orimproving good numbers and sizes of gamefish (largemouth bass, northern pike, bluegill, blackcrappie) through stocking, habitat manipulation, or regulations.</p>",
