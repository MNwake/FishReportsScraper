                "narrative": "<p>Island Lake Reservoir (ILR) is an 8,000-acre reservoir with 3,260 acres (41%) of littoral area and a maximum depth of 94 feet.  The lake is located 10 miles north of Duluth, MN off Highway 4 and has three concrete, back-in public access points.  ILR was assessed during the spring of 2022 to evaluate the current Muskellunge fishery, assess the success of the stocking program and to complete a population estimate of adult Muskellunge.  Muskellunge assessments are currently conducted about once every five years on ILR with the last assessment completed in 2016.   <br> \n <br> \nLeech Lake strain Muskellunge were originally stocked in 1992.  Prior to that, sporadic Muskellunge stocking between 1963 and 1981 occurred.  Currently, ILR is stocked annually with approximately 1,630 fingerling Muskellunge.   <br> \n <br> \nSampling with large-frame trapnets occurred from May 10 through May 24, a period of 14 days that resulted in 220 net-set days.  A fairly stable but slow warming trend occurred during the assessment allowing water temperatures to warm gradually.  The weather pattern minimized major cold fronts that can delay spawning movements but above normal precipitation in the watershed resulted in very high water levels during the assessment and may have impacted catchability.  Catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) calculations should be interpreted with caution since the duration of this assessment and locations targeted are intended to capture Muskellunge.  In addition, net size selectivity and fish spawning behavior may bias catchability.  Nets that didn't fish due to wind or holes were excluded from CPUE calculations.   <br> \n <br> \nAll Muskellunge captured were measured for length and weight, sex was determined, and scales were collected from a subsample of the catch for age and growth analysis.  Each fish was checked for an existing Passive Integrated Transponder (PIT) tag.  If captured specimens did not have a PIT tag, one was applied.  The PIT tags were implanted just below the dorsal fin where the scales were removed.  Recaptured fish from previous assessments were measured for length and weight and PIT tag data was recorded.  In addition to Muskellunge, biological data were also collected on Small and Largemouth Bass, Walleye, Black Crappie, Bluegill and Channel Catfish.   <br> \n <br> \nThe Muskellunge spring trapnet catch rate of 0.6 was up from 2016 (0.3).  A total of 131 Muskellunge were captured with fish ranging from 29.3 to 53.9 inches in length.  Muskellunge average length was 43.4 inches.  Size structure of Muskellunge in 2022 shows excellent trophy opportunities while also documenting increased recruitment of younger, smaller fish which were lacking during the 2016 assessment.  The percentage of adult Muskellunge that exceeded memorable size (42 inches) was 65%, while the proportion that exceeded trophy size (50 inches) was 9%. Twenty-three individuals were caught more than once in 2022 (within year recaptures), leaving a total of 108 unique individuals handled.  A total of 35 out of 108 (32%) Muskellunge captured during this assessment were recaptured from previous assessments.  These fish were captured and implanted with PIT tags during Muskellunge assessments from 2008-2016.   <br> \n <br> \nEffort was spent estimating the population size of the Muskellunge spawning stock.  Estimates are reported with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI).  The population estimates provided are approximations of the number of adult muskellunge present, and provide for comparisons of past and future population estimates of Muskellunge in ILR.  Only Muskellunge 30 inches or longer were used to calculate population estimates.  With trapnetting as the recapture method, a multiple census population estimate utilizing the modified Schnabel method estimated 444 adult Muskellunge (95% CI - 293, 797).  This estimate was up modestly from the 2016 survey but was not statistically significant.  Prior estimates have ranged from 288 to 652 adults.  The 2022 estimate translates into one adult Muskellunge for every 18.0 surface acres (0.06 fish/acre) in ILR.  Previous estimates on ILR have estimated one adult Muskellunge for every 12.3 to 27.6 surface acres (0.04-0.08 fish/acre). <br> \n <br> \nSmallmouth Bass spring trapnet abundance was 1.6 per lift.  The average size was 16.0 inches while the maximum size was 20.4 inches.  Length at age-4 of 12.5 inches is above average growth when compared to other Duluth Area Smallmouth Bass populations.  All year-classes from 2012 to 2020 were represented with several strong year-classes. <br> \n <br> \nThe Black Crappie spring trapnet abundance was 2.1 per lift.  Average length was large at 10.6 inches and the maximum size was 14.9 inches.  Length at age-4 of 8.6 inches represented an above average growth rate when compared to other Duluth Area crappie populations.  All year-classes from 2010 to 2019 were represented demonstrating consistent recruitment.   <br> \n <br> \nThe Bluegill spring trapnet abundance was 0.2 per lift.  Average length was 8.1 inches and the maximum size was 10.2 inches.  Length at age-4 of 7.2 inches represents fast growth rate when compared to other Duluth Area Bluegill populations.  Year-class analyses suggest low and sporadic recruitment with some missing year-classes. <br> \n <br> \nThe Walleye spring trapnet abundance was 4.4 per lift.  Average length was 16.0 inches and the maximum size was 31.0 inches.  Walleye age and growth metrics were not evaluated for this assessment.  <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass spring trapnet abundance was 0.08 per lift.  Average size was 17.0 inches while the maximum size sampled was 20.4 inches.  Length at age-4 of 12.2 inches is average growth when compared to other Duluth Area Largemouth Bass populations.  All year-classes from 2011 to 2016 were represented.</p>",

Rock bass were most abundant at 1.4 per lift.  Black crappie were most abundant in the northwest basin (Bear Island) with a mean length of 7.6 inches.The yellow perch catch was 5.9 per lift and a mean length of 7.6 inches with a higher abundance in the northwest basin.The walleye catch was 10.3 per lift and a mean length of 12.7 inches, averaging 0.9 pound.  Once again, the northwest basin had a higher abundance.  Walleye were sampled to age VI with most year classes well represented.  Fry stocking in 1985 showed little response.</p>",

Walleye and Muskellunge are the primary management species for Island Reservoir.  Muskellunge are not well sampled during summer investigations and are indexed via a targeted spawning assessment once every five years.     <br> \n <br> \nExperimental Walleye angling regulations were implemented on Island Reservoir in 2021 (protected slot limit 15-20\", not more than one over 20\", bag limit of 10 fish).  The regulation aims to improve Walleye size structure and encourage anglers to harvest surplus small Walleye that are abundant. The Walleye population at Island Reservoir has unique challenges including a high abundance of small fish and exceptionally slow growth rates. These challenges limit the effectiveness of special angling regulations common on other Minnesota Walleye fisheries.   <br> \n <br> \nWalleye are self-sustaining and have not been stocked into Island Reservoir since 1985.  Walleye abundance of 6.5 per gillnet lift is average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Walleye average length was 11.8 inches.  Anglers should expect good catches of Walleye, but fish less than 12 inches will dominate the catch. <br> \n <br> \nSmallmouth Bass gillnet abundance of 1.2 per lift is above average compared to other similar Minnesota lakes.  Average length of gillnet captured bass was 14.0 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nPanfish were relatively scarce but size structure was above average.  Black Crappie population density was below average compared to other similar Minnesota lakes, but average length was large at 11.2 inches.  Bluegill population density was also below average compared to other similar Minnesota lakes, but average length was large at 8.8 inches. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike abundance of 1.1 per gillnet lift was below average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Average length was 21.1 inches and growth was average relative to other Duluth Area lakes. <br> \n</p>",

The 1994 survey netting information supports this reputation with walleye lengths averaging 12.8 inches with the bulk of the fish between 10 and 15 inches.  Very few large (>20 inches) walleyes were sampled.  Two strong year classes (1991, 1988) comprise 53 % of the walleye seen in the 1994 gillnet catch.  All of the walleyes seen in the gill nets were from natural reproduction.     Northern pike are present in average numbers and tend also to be small (18.6 inches average).  Nice sized yellow perch, which are abundant, smallmouth bass and black crappie are present to round out the angler's catch.  Recent stocking of muskies in 1994 aand 1992 may also provide diversity to the angler.</p>",

Island Reservoir is located 10 miles north of Duluth, MN, is 44% littoral and has three designated public access points.  Island Reservoir has extreme water level fluctuations ranging from a summertime gage reading high of 39 feet down to the an early spring low of 19.5 feet.  Island is part of a series of water storage reservoirs used by Minnesota Power in the production of hydro-electric energy at their Thomson generating plant.  Much of the 58.5 miles of shoreline is owned by Minnesota Power, which in turn leases shoreline lots to private individuals for cabin sites.  Island reservoir fish population has been sampled in 1942, 1954, 1968, 1978, 1985, 1989, 1994 and 1998.  Muskellunge have been stocked in six years since 1992.  Walleye have not been stocked since 1985.     Abundance of walleye indexed with assessment nets was 7.6 per lift in 1998.  This index value was typical conpared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Size structure and growth rates were poor with only 23% of sampled walleye longer than 15 inches and fish only reaching 12.4 inches in length at the beginning of their fourth year.  Natural recruitment of walleye to the Island Reservoir fishery appears to be excellent.  Eleven age groups were documented from the 1998 assessment and 1994 and 1995 appeared to produce strong year classes.     Catch rates of northern pike, smallmouth bass and yellow perch indexed with assessment nets were all within accepted ranges compared to Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Size structure was poor for northern pike, average for yellow perch and good for smallmouth bass.  Growth rates were slow for both northern pike and smallmouth bass compared to other populations sampled in the Duluth Area.     Black crappie were also sampled at a low rate compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  One hundred percent of sampled black crappie were longer than eight inches.  Black crappie growth rates were fast compared to other populations sampled in the Duluth Area and the 1994 year class was relatively strong.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Targeted gill net surveys are being conducted in the fall annually on Island Reservoir to closely monitor the Walleye population following the implementation of an experimental Walleye angling regulation in 2021.  Walleye and Muskellunge are the primary management species for Island Reservoir.  Stocking of Walleye has not occurred regularly into Island Reservoir since 1970 because the population has been able to adequately sustain itself through natural reproduction.   <br> \n <br> \nThe Walleye population at Island Reservoir has unique challenges including a high abundance of small fish and exceptionally slow growth rates.  These challenges limit the effectiveness of special angling regulations occasionally implemented on other Minnesota Walleye fisheries.  Experimental Walleye angling regulations were implemented on Island Reservoir in 2021 (protected slot limit 15-20\", not more than one over 20\", bag limit of 10 fish) to improve Walleye size structure and encourage anglers to harvest surplus small Walleye that are abundant.  Biological performance indicators were used to monitor the Walleye fishery and will be calculated annually to monitor trends and help evaluate the effectiveness of the experimental angling regulation.  Size structure and catch rates of Walleye observed during this survey should be interpreted with caution, may show differences from summer gillnet indices and may be a result of seasonal movements, sampling or environmental variability.  Other metrics, such as length and age at maturity cannot be calculated during summer assessments and necessitate the need for fall sampling for effective monitoring. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance of 3.9 per gillnet lift is average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Walleye average length was 13.8 inches but no specimens over 22 inches were captured.  Growth rates observed were similar to what was observed from the 2021 standard survey and still represents slow growth compared to other Duluth Area Walleye populations.  Age analysis revealed consistent recruitment with no missing year-classes from 2013 through 2021.  Female Walleye length at maturity was 14.3 inches while age at maturity was 5.7 years.  Male Walleye length at maturity was 12.9 inches while age at maturity was 5.1 years.  Anglers should expect good catches of Walleye, but small fish will dominate the catch.   <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch abundance of 8.9 per lift was above average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Despite an above average abundance of adult Yellow Perch, most perch captured were relatively large and small Walleye are gape-limited to these prey.  A targeted vertical gillnet survey using small mesh monofilament nets did not capture any juvenile Yellow Perch in 2019, and shoreline beach seining in 2021 for small Yellow Perch was down from previous surveys.  <br> \n  <br> \nSmallmouth Bass gillnet abundance of 1.1 per lift is above average compared to other similar Minnesota lakes.  Average length of captured Smallmouth Bass was 12.3 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike abundance of 0.8 per gillnet lift was below average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Average length was 20.7 inches.   <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Island Lake Reservoir is a 8111.9 acre lake with 3260 (44%) littoral acres and a maximum depth of 94 feet.  The lake is located 10 miles north of Duluth with three Minnesota Power-owned public accesses.  Because Island Lake is a reservoir used to store water for hydroelectric power generation, large, annual changes in water level are expected and a part of the accepted variability of reservoir resource management.  The primary management species is walleye and the secondary management species is muskellunge.  Walleye are maintained by natural reproduction while muskellunge are stocked biennially.    Walleye abundance increased from 7.6 fish/gillnet in 1998 to 10.0 in 2003.  This value was average to above average for Minnesota lakes of similar type and reflected historical catch levels from previous assessments.  Growth was extremely slow with age 4 fish averaging 11.6 inches.  The mean length was 11.9 inches.  Nine age classes (age 1-8,11) were well represented in the assessment catch.  The 2001 year class (age 2) was the most abundant year class, comprising 31% of the 112 fish aged.  Northern pike abundance increased from 1.9 fish/gillnet (1998) to 3.5 fish/gillnet (2003).  This was above average for Minnesota lakes of similar type and represented the highest catch rate recorded for Island Lake.  Growth was slow compared to other Duluth Area lakes with a mean length at age 4 of 19.1 inches, a decrease from 1998 (21.6 inches).  Mean length also decreased from 20.6 inches in 1998 to 19.7 inches.  Age 2-4 represented 83% of the 63 fish aged.  Six age classes (age 2-6, 10) were present in the assessment.  Smallmouth bass abundance increased from 0.3 fish/gillnet (1998) to 1.1 fish/gillnet (2003).  This value was above average for Minnesota lakes of similar type.  The mean length at age 4 was 12.2 inches with an overall mean length of 13.7 inches.  Age 5 fish represented 68% of the 22 aged fish.    Yellow perch abundance increased from 5.9 fish/gillnet (1998) to 7.4 fish/gillnet (2003).  This value was above average for Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Over the past four assessments,  catch rates were average to above average.  White sucker abundance was 2.5 fish/gillnet and was average for Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Black crappie abundance decreased from 0.5 fish/trapnet (1998) to 0.4 fish/trapnet (2003) which was below average for Minnesota lakes of similar type.  However, growth and size of fish present in catch was above average for the Duluth area.  The mean length at age 4 was 9.1 inches with an overall mean length of 10.1 inches.  Sixty-seven percent of the 9 fish aged were age 4.  Bluegill abundance was 0.1 fish/trapnet which was below average for Minnesota lakes of similar type although unchanged from 1998.  Other species sampled in the assessment included black bullhead, pumpkinseed, rock bass and shorthead redhorse.  In the spring of 2003, an initial muskellunge assessment was completed to evaluate the stocking program.  Muskellunge fingerlings have been stocked in 1992, 1994, 1995, 1996, 1997, 1998, 2000 and 2002.  Prior to that, muskellunge were stocked on a sporadic basis from 1963-1981.  Muskellunge abundance was 0.2 fish/trapet.  Mean length was 32.3 inches with a mean length at age 4 of 28.8 inches.  Age analysis indicated that 64% of the 14 fish aged were born in years that correspond to stocking.   Walleye, northern pike, yellow perch and smallmouth bass catch rates are high for Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Water level flucuations do not appear to be negatively impacting the fishery.  Recent low water levels (2001-2003) have allowed growth of terrestrial vegetation along the shoreline.  Once the reservoir returns to normal water level, habitat for fish species such as black crappie and bluegill will be enhanced.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Island is an 8,000 acre reservoir with 3,260 (41%) acres of littoral area and a maximum depth of 94 feet.  The reservoir is located 10 miles north of Duluth, Minnesota off Highway #4 and has three concrete, back-in public access points administered by Minnesota Power.  Island has been actively managed for muskellunge by annually stocking approximately 2,500 fingerlings from 1992 through 1998 and biennial stocking through 2012.  Since 1970, walleye have only been stocked into Island Reservoir in 1985.  Island was last surveyed in 2006.  Island was assessed during the summer of 2012 to update information on fish populations.  Fish samples from this assessment were submitted for contaminant analysis.   <br> \n <br> \nWater quality observations during this assessment were likely impacted by warm weather conditions and the historic flood from a couple weeks prior to when the measurements were taken.  The secchi disk reading of 4.0 feet was the lowest recorded observation since readings were first taken in 1942 (range; 4.3 in 1993 to 7.5 in 1990).  In addition, dissolved oxygen concentrations in the upper level of the water column from previous assessments have generally been higher than what was observed during this assessment. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance of 9.0 per gillnet lift was up from 2006 (7.0) and average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Walleye gillnet catch rates from six investigations since 1989 have ranged from 5.7 to 10.9 per lift.  Average length of 11.1 inches was small and growth was the slowest in the Duluth Fisheries Management Area.  Over 88% of the walleyes captured were less than 15 inches long.  All year-classes from 1998 through 2011 were represented, except 1999-2000 and 2002.   <br> \n <br> \nAll walleye greater than 12 inches were sexed and stomach contents were identified.  Male to female ratio was 0.8:1.  Two percent of the specimens were an unknown sex.  Of the 73 walleye examined, 78% had empty stomachs.  Of the 22% that contained stomach contents (16 specimens) 75% contained fish, 19% contained crayfish and 13% contained aquatic insects.  Percentages do not total 100 because some fish contained multiple prey types.  One fish contained a lead-head jig.  Fish prey species was primarily yellow perch (67%).  Two specimens contained bluegill and one contained a sculpin.  Two other specimens contained unidentifiable fish species. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike abundance of 1.3 per gillnet lift was up from 2006 (0.7) and was average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Northern pike abundance has historically been relatively low in Island Reservoir with gillnet catches ranging from 0.7 in 2006 to 3.5 in 2003 in twelve investigations dating back to 1942.  Average length was 21.8 inches and growth was average.  All year-classes from 2005 through 2011 were represented. <br> \n <br> \nSmallmouth bass abundance of 1.3 per gillnet lift was up from 2006 (0.5) average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  This sample represents the highest smallmouth abundance in twelve investigations dating back to 1942.  Average length of 14.8 inches was large and growth was average compared to other Duluth Area smallmouth populations.  All year-classes from 2003 through 2011 were represented, with a strong 2006 year-class.  Smallmouth bass captured in gillnets were examined for stomach contents.  Of the 30 smallmouth bass examined, 57% had empty stomachs.  Of the 43% that contained stomach contents (13 specimens), 62% contained crayfish and 46% contained fish.   Percentages do not total 100 because some fish contained multiple prey types.  Fish prey species were almost all unidentifiable.  However, one trout-perch was identified. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch abundance of 8.1 per gillnet lift was down from 2006 (8.9) and above average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Average length of 8.2 inches was moderate and growth was fast compared to other Duluth Area yellow perch populations.  Over 22% of the perch captured were greater than 10 inches long.  All year-classes from 2004 through 2010 were represented. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie abundance of 0.7 per trapnet lift was down from 2006 (1.6) and was below average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Average length of 9.5 inches was large and growth was average compared to other Duluth Area black crappie populations.  All year-classes from 2004 through 2010 were represented. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill abundance of 3.3 per trapnet lift was up from 2006 (0.7) but was still below average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  The 2012 sample represents the highest bluegill abundance in twelve investigations dating back to 1942.  Average length was 6.8 inches and growth was average compared to other Duluth Area bluegill populations.  Age analysis revealed a relatively strong 2006 year-class and all year-classes present from 2003-2011, except 2008. <br> \n <br> \nWhite sucker abundance of 2.4 per gillnet lift was up from 2006 (1.7) and average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Average length of white suckers was 13.1 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species sampled include black bullhead, burbot, channel catfish, largemouth bass, pumpkinseed sunfish, rock bass and shorthead redhorse.   <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Island is a 8,112 acre reservoir with 3,260 (40%) acres of littoral area and a maximum depth of 94 feet.  The lake is located 10 miles north of Duluth, Minnesota off Highway #4 and has three concrete, back-in public access points administered by Minnesota Power.  Island lake has been actively managed for muskellunge by annually stocking approximately 2,500 fingerlings from 1992 through 1998 and bi-ennial stocking in even years through 2006.  Since 1970, walleye have only been stocked into Island Reservoir in 1985.  The 2006 resurvey of Island Lake was part of a larger study that included a mark-and-recapture population and mortality estimate and a creel survey conducted during 2006/2007.  A report on the creel survey and population estimate will be submitted in the spring of 2008.\n\nWalleye abundance of 7.0 per gillnet lift was average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Walleye gillnet catch rates from five investigations since 1989 have ranged from 5.7 to 10.9 per lift.  Average size of 11.4 inches was small and growth was the slowest in the Duluth Fisheries Management Area.  All year-classes from 1997 through 2005 represented, with a strong year-class in 2002 and 2003.  \n\nNorthern pike abundance of 0.7 per gillnet lift was below average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Average size of 22.2 inches was moderate and growth average.   Aging revealed fish from all year-classes between 1999 and 2004 and no fish were older than age seven.\n\nSmallmouth bass abundance of 0.5 per gillnet lift was average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Average size of 13.5 inches was large and growth was fast.  All year-classes from 2000 through 2005 were represented, with strong year-classes in 2002 and 2003.  Naturally reproduced YOY smallmouth bass were documented during shoreline seining. \n\nYellow perch abundance of 8.9 per gillnet lift was above average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Average size of 8.4 inches was moderate and  growth was fast.  Aging revealed relatively strong year classes from 2000 through 2003 and only one fish older than age six.  Naturally reproduced YOY yellow perch were documented during shoreline seining. \n\nBlack crappie abundance of 1.6 per trapnet lift was average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Average size of 9.0 inches was large and growth was fast.  The 2003 year-class was strong and no fish were older than age six.\n\nBluegill abundance of 0.7 per trapnet lift was below average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Average size of 8.2 inches was large and growth was fast.  Five year-classes were represented from 1998 through 2003, with a relatively strong 2002 year-class.  Naturally reproduced YOY bluegill were documented during shoreline seining.\n\nOther fish species sampled include blackchin shiner, burbot, channel catfish, emerald shiner, Johnny darter, largemouth bass, logperch, pumpkinseed sunfish, rock bass, shorthead redhorse and white sucker.  This is the first time largemouth bass have been identified in Island Reservoir.\n  \nInformation was collected on aquatic vegetation, substrate type and water quality.  Diversity of aquatic vegetation was low, with a total of 22 species identified along 50 transects.  Variable -leaf pondweed, which was the only species that had an abundance rating other than rare, was rated as common and identified along 68% of the transects.  Although abundance of aquatic macrophytes was reported as low in 2006, there appears to have been a substantial increase in spatial distribution and abundance since the last survey.    Distribution and abundance of aquatic macrophytes in Island Reservoir is strongly influenced by winter water-level drawdowns and summer pool level.  Winter drawdowns have decreased as a result of the most recent Federal Energy Regulatory Agency licensing agreement, while summer pool levels have been unusually low during some recent summers due to lower than average precipitation. The most common substrate types were sand and gravel.  Results of laboratory water analysis indicate Island Reservoir is a slightly alkaline, moderately soft-water lake with moderate fertility. \n\n  \n</p>",

Walleye and Muskellunge are the primary management species for Island Reservoir.  Muskellunge are generally not sampled during summer investigations and are indexed via a targeted spawning assessment once every three years.     <br> \n <br> \nWalleye are self-sustaining and have not been stocked into Island Reservoir since 1985.  Walleye abundance of 5.7 per gillnet lift is average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Walleye average length was 11.2 inches.  Anglers should expect good catches of Walleye, but fish less than 12 inches will dominate the catch. <br> \n <br> \nSmallmouth Bass abundance is above average compared to other similar Minnesota lakes.  Average length of trapnet captured bass was 14.0 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie population density was above average compared to other similar Minnesota lakes.  The 2016 catch rate of 2.5 per trapnet lift represents a historic high for Black Crappie in Island Reservoir.  Black Crappie average length was large at 9.9 inches.  Bluegill population density was below average compared to other similar Minnesota lakes, but average length was large at 8.2 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike abundance of 1.3 per gillnet lift was near average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Average length was 21.8 inches and growth was average relative to other Duluth Area lakes. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Targeted gillnetting surveys are being conducted in the fall annually on Island Reservoir to closely monitor the Walleye population following the implementation of experimental Walleye angling regulations in 2021.  Walleye and Muskellunge are the primary management species for Island Reservoir.  Stocking of Walleye has not occurred regularly into Island Reservoir since 1970 because the population has been able to sustain itself through natural reproduction.   <br> \n <br> \nThe Walleye population at Island Reservoir has unique challenges including a high abundance of small fish and exceptionally slow growth rates.  These challenges limit the effectiveness of special angling regulations common on other Minnesota Walleye fisheries.  Experimental Walleye angling regulations were implemented on Island Reservoir in 2021 (protected slot limit 15-20\", not more than one over 20\", bag limit of 10 fish) to improve Walleye size structure and encourage anglers to harvest surplus small Walleye that are abundant.  Biological performance indicators were used to monitor the Walleye fishery and will be calculated annually to monitor for trends and help evaluate the effectiveness of the experimental angling regulation. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance of 4.8 per gillnet lift is average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Walleye average length was 14.3 inches and two large specimens over 26 inches were captured.  Size structure of Walleye observed during this survey showed differences from summer gillnet indices and may be a result of seasonal movements, sampling or environmental variability.  Growth rates observed were faster than what was observed from the 2021 standard survey but still represents slow growth compared to other Duluth Area Walleye populations.  Age analysis revealed consistent recruitment with no missing year-classes from 2011 through 2021.  Female Walleye length at maturity was 15.2 inches while age at maturity was 5.5 years.  Male Walleye length at maturity was 13.2 inches while age at maturity was 4.5 years.  Anglers should expect good catches of Walleye, but small fish will dominate the catch.   <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch abundance of 10.4 per lift was above average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Despite an above average abundance of adult Yellow Perch, most perch captured were relatively large and small Walleye are gape-limited to these prey.  A targeted vertical gillnet survey using small mesh monofilament nets did not capture any juvenile Yellow Perch in 2019, and shoreline beach seining in 2021 for Yellow Perch was down from previous surveys.   <br> \n <br> \nSmallmouth Bass gillnet abundance of 1.0 per lift is above average compared to other similar Minnesota lakes.  Average length of captured Smallmouth Bass was 10.4 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike abundance of 0.8 per gillnet lift was below average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Average length was 21.1 inches.   <br> \n</p>",
