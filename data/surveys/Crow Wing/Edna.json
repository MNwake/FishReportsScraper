                "narrative": "<p>Edna Lake is a 156 acre lake in west-central Crow Wing County, just north of the city of Nisswa.  The maximum depth is 63 feet.  The primary management species for Edna are northern pike and walleye.  A standard survey was conducted the week of June 15, 2015. <br> \n <br> \nThe northern pike catch rate was 5.2/gill net.  This is close to average for lakes like Edna.  The average size was 20.3\" with fish as large as 32.3\" measured.  However, only 10 percent of the sampled northern pike were 24\" or greater.  In order to improve northern pike size, anglers are encouraged to harvest smaller northern pike and release the larger ones. <br> \n <br> \nWalleyes are stocked in Edna Lake every third year.  Each stocking consists of 45 pounds of walleye fingerlings.  Only 3 walleyes were sampled in the 2015 survey with both gill nets and trap nets.  These fish were 20.5\", 24.3\", and 25.8\" in length.  Although numbers may not be high, anglers that catch a walleye may be rewarded with a quality sized fish. <br> \n <br> \nPanfish, both black crappie and bluegill, are also available to anglers.  The black crappie catch rate was 3.6/trap net, which is above average for lakes like Edna.  The average size was 8.3\" with the largest being 10.2\".  About 81 percent of the sampled black crappies were 8\" or larger.  The bluegill catch rate was 25.4/trap net, which is slightly above average for lakes similar to Edna.  Bluegills averaged 6.1\" with fish up to 8.7\" sampled.  Nearly 27 percent of bluegills were 7\" or larger. <br> \n <br> \nAnother option for anglers of Edna Lake is tullibee.  They were sampled at 3.2/gill net, which is slightly below average for lakes like Edna.  The size of some tullibee was impressive, with 7 fish measuring at least 18\". <br> \n <br> \nSome other fish species sampled include hybrid sunfish, largemouth bass, pumpkinseed, rock bass, and yellow bullhead.   <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Edna is a 153 acre lake located about two miles north of Nisswa.  There is a public access located on the northeast side.  The lake has moderately hard water and low phosphorus fertility.  Water clarity is above average for the area.  About 59% of the lake is less than 15 feet deep.  Shallow water soils are commonly sand and gravel with some areas of muck and marl soils as well.  Bulrush beds provide preferred spawning habitat for bass and panfish species.  Beds of submerged vegetation provide important fish cover and feeding habitat.Northern pike were the most abundant gamefish sampled in the 1994 netting.  Their abundance was \"average\" compared to similar type lakes.  Ages 2-5 were sampled and growth was good.  Average size was 1.8 lbs..  Walleyes were caught in \"average\" numbers as well.  Ages 4, 6 and 7 were present.  Two of the five walleyes aged to be from a year when fingerlins were stocked.Largemouth bass were also found in \"average\" numbers.  Smallmouth bass were caught in shoreline seine hauls in 1994.  Bluegills were extremely abundant in 1994, as they were in previous nettings.  Ages 2-6 were sampled and growth was good.  About one-half of sampled bluegills were from the 1989 year class.  Black crappies were caught in \"high numbers in '94.  Ages 3-5 were present and growth was slow.  Pumpkinseeds and rock bass were also found in \"high\" numbers.Yellow perch were found in \"average\" numbers, while tullibees were present in \"high\" numbers.  Both species are important food sources for gamefishes.  White suckers and yellow bullheads were also caught in 1994, both species in \"average\" numbers when compared to similar type lakes.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Edna is a 153 acre lake found about two miles north of Nisswa, Minnesota.  There is a public access located on the northeast side of the lake.  The lake has moderately hard water and low phosphorus fertility.  Water clarity is above average for the area.  About 59% of the lake is less than 15 feet deep.  Shallow water soils are predominantly sand and gravel with some areas of muck and marl soils as well.  Bulrush beds provide preferred spawning habitat for bass and panfish species.  Beds submerged vegetation provide important fish cover and feeding habitat.Northern pike were the most abundant gamefish species sampled in the 1999 netting.  Their abundance was average compared to similar type lakes.  Ages 2-5 were sampled and growth was good.  Average size was 1.5 pounds.  Walleye were caught in average numbers as well, at 1.0/gillnet.  Walleye fingerlings have been stocked every third year, beginning in 1990.Largemouth bass were also found in average numbers.  Smallmouth bass were caught in the shoreline seine hauls in 1999.  Bluegills were extremely abundant in 1999, as they were in previous nettings.  Ages 3-8 were sampled and growth was good.  About 1/3 of the sampled bluegill were from the 1993 year class.  Black crappie were caught in high numbers in 1999.  Ages 2-4 were present and growth was good.  Pumpkinseed and rockbass were also found in high numbers.Yellow perch were found in average numbers, while tullibees were present in average numbers.  Both species are important food sources for gamefish.  Yellow bullheads were also caught in average numbers in 1999..</p>",

Severe net tampering occurred which affected the catch in all three gillnets and three of the four trapnets. The following analysis is based on what was caught. Of the fish sampled, northern pike and black crappie grew apparently what could be termed good. Only one walleye was sampled which had good growth at increments 1 and 2 however, it apparently grew at a fast rate through the last annulus formation. Bluegills grew slow at every year class as well as at increments. At this point nothing more can be said about fish species composition and population except that the species of fish present in Edna Lake include but are not limited to:  northern cisco, northern pike, yellow bullhead, largemouth bass, rock bass, pumpkinseed, bluegill, black crappie, hybrid sunfish, walleye, green sunfish yellow perch, white sucker, bowfin, black bullhead and brown bullhead.</p>",
