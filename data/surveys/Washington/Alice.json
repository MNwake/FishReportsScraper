                "narrative": "<p>Alice Lake is located in William O'Brien State Park north of Marine on the St. Croix, and subsequently receives heavy fishing pressure during the open water season. The river flooded the lake during the spring of 2001. This allowed river species such as gizzard shad and freshwater drum (sheephead) to enter the lake. Alice Lake is part of the children's fishing pond program. The Minnesota DNR manages these water bodies more intensively by stocking them annually with panfish. As a result, bluegills are the most abundant species in the lake. Their population is currently considered average when compared to similar lakes. The average size of bluegills sampled during the 2001 survey was only 4.78 inches in length. Black crappie numbers are lower than average but a few larger fish are present. Northern pike provide a bonus fishery and excitement for younger anglers.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Alice Lake is located entirely within William O'Brien State Park and has been managed as part of the DNR Fishing in the Neighborhood Program since 2001. Prior to that it was managed as a children's fishing pond beginning in the 1960's. The lake is impounded and shallow, maximum depth 9.0 feet, but not prone to winterkill. The water source is groundwater and the lake is occasionally inundated during high water events on the St. Croix River which introduces riverine species to the lake. Regular stocking of bluegill and crappie have occurred since the 1960's. More recently, white bass were stocked in 2002 and from 2004-2007, northern pike and yellow perch were stocked in 2002 and walleye in 2003 and 2004. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill were the most abundant species of fish sampled in the 2011 netting survey as they have been in all netting surveys conducted on Alice Lake. The average size was small though, at 4.8 inches and a maximum length of 6.8 inches. Northern pike were moderately abundant and ranged in size from 20 to 29 inches. Other panfish species such as yellow perch, green sunfish, pumpkinseed sunfish and hybrid sunfish were all sampled in low numbers and were of a small size. Species that likely emigrated to Alice from the St. Croix River during high flows were spotted sucker and golden redhorse along with one walleye. Based on the results from the 2011 netting the fishery is Alice Lake is quite average for a small lake located in this area of the state. The northern pike and walleye provide a bonus fishery and excitement factor for the youth that are targeting fish in this lake. <br> \n</p>",

There are over-night camping facilities, bathrooms, ample parking, hiking trails, and many picnic tables/grills.  The lake has a fishing pier on the south end and limited shorefishing on the east side, but fishing from shore (other than the pier) can be hampered by dense aquatic vegetation.   Free loaner fishing tackle is available from the park office. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill were the most abundant species sampled, but they were small - average length was 5 inches, and none were over 6 inches.  Black crappie were sampled in low numbers and were also small.  Lengths ranged from 6 to 8 inches, with the average just under 7 inches.  Pumpkinseed, hybrid, and green sunfish were all sampled in moderate abundance.  Northern pike were sampled in low numbers, with lengths from 15 to 25 inches.  Northern pike have not been stocked in recent years, and abundance may be down as a result.  Largemouth bass are present, fish up to 15 inches were observed.  Walleye were stocked in 2003 and 2004, but only one 22-inch fish was sampled.  Yellow bullhead were sampled in moderate numbers, with lengths ranging from 6 to 13 inches.  Adult white bass have been stocked in 2002, 2004, 2005,and 2006.  Two 14-inch white bass sampled were from the 2006 stocking.   Several species of river fish were sampled.  These fish may have entered the lake during floods from the St. Croix River.  The species sampled were golden redhorse, spotted sucker, and smallmouth bass.  Carp are also present.</p>",
