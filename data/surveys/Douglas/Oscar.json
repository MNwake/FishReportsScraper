                "narrative": "<p>Water levels on Oscar Lake rose approximately 6-8 feet during the mid 1980's and increased the surfaceacreage and volume of the lake.   Water levels receded approximately four feet by 1990 but were on therise again in 1993 and 1994.  Fluctuating water levels have negatively impacted emergent vegetation,especially a noticeable decrease in hardstem bulrush abundance.  The abundance and diversity ofsubmergent vegetation has not changed significantly since the last full survey in 1978. Submergentvegetation grows to a depth of 9.0 feet and is common along the entire shoreline and is dense in manyareas.  Eurasian watermilfoil was discovered in Oscar lake in 1992 and has expanded in coverage despiterepeated chemical treatments to eradicate known infestation sites.    Lakeshore residents have reportedseveral new sites over the past two years.  Vegetation surveys and reconnaissance by DNR crews has beenunsuccessful in mapping the extent of the Eurasian milfoil infestation.Northern pike abundance is limited.  Gillnet catches averaged 0.2 fish/net which is well below thenormal range of mean catch rates from lakes with similar chemical and physical characteristics (2.0 -10.8 fish/gillnet).  Gillnet catches have declined steadily since 1983, averaging 5.9, 3.5, and 1.3fish/net in 1983, 1987, and 1990, respectively.  Sample size (n = 2) was not adequate to evaluate thesize structure and growth rate of the northern pike population.  Oscar Lake is well known for qualitylargemouth bass fishing.  Daytime, DC electrofishing yielded 13.8 fish per hour in 1994.  Sizestructure of the population is mostly comprised of large individuals.  Over one-half of the fishcaptured were 15.0 inches in length or greater.  Mean weight of fish captured was 2.1 pounds.  Bluegilltrapnet catches averaged 3.8 fish/net.  Catches have ranged from 9.3 - 34.4 fish/trapnet in previoussurveys dating back to 1978.  The normal range of mean catch rates from similar lakes is 3.5 - 57.1fish/trapnet.  The size structure of the bluegill population should appeal to most anglers.  Most ofthe fish were 6.0 inches in length or greater.  Mean weight of fish captured was 0.3 pounds.  Blackcrappie trapnet catches averaged 1.7 fish\\net.  Trapnet catches in previous surveys have ranged from2.0 - 8.4 fish\\net in previous surveys dating back to 1978.  The normal range of mean catch rates fromsimilar lakes is 2.1 -24.1 fish\\trapnet.  As with largemouth bass and bluegill, the size structure ofthe black crappie population is dominated by large individuals. Most of the fish captured were 8.0inches in length or greater and approximately one-third exceeded 10 inches.  Yellow perch gillnet catchrates increased from 3.9 fish\\net in 1990 to 22.6 fish\\net in 1994.  Gillnet catches have ranged from3.4 - 22.6 fish\\net in previous surveys.  The normal range of mean catch rates from similar lakes is2.0 - 22.3 fish/gillnet.  Mean weight of fish captured was 0.1 pounds.  Most of the fish captured werebetween 5 and 8 inches in length.  Walleye gillnet catches averaged 7.0 fish\\net which exceeds thenormal range of mean catch rates from similar lakes (0.8 -3.8 fish/gillnet).  Gillnet catches haveranged from 3.8 - 12.0 fish/net in previous surveys dating back to 1978.  The size structure of thewalleye population is also mostly comprised of large individuals.  Approximately one-half of the fishcaptured were 20 inches in length or greater and 10% exceeded 25 inches.  Average weight of fishcaptured was 3.0 pounds.  The current stocking scheme of 1.5 pounds per littoral acre every other yearappears to be producing a population that meets goals stated in the Lake Management Plan.  However,stocking of mixed age fish has precluded any meaningful evaluation of stocking efficiency.      </p>",

Water levels on Oscar Lake rose approximately 6-8 feet during the mid-1980's.  Water levels had receded by approximately four feet by 1990, but rose again during years of above average precipitation in 1993 and 1994.  Water levels continued to rise and reached all time highs in 1998.  High water has altered the shoreline around most of the lake and has inundated several homes and basements.  The surface acreage and volume of the lake are considerably greater than what is reported on lake maps and historical records.Oscar Lake supports an abundant and diverse aquatic plant community.  Submergent vegetation is common along the entire shoreline and is dense in many areas.  Eurasian watermilfoil, a harmful exotic plant species, was discovered in 1992.  Despite repeated chemical treatments to destroy the plants in areas that it was discovered, distribution and abundance of the exotic milfoil have increased.  Fortunately the native aquatic plant community is quite healthy and will slow or prevent the exotic weed from overtaking the lake and negatively impacting recreational pursuits.  Coverage of emergent plants such as cattail and bulrush is limited.  Extreme fluctuations in water levels over the years have likely led to the demise of these important aquatic plants.High water levels appear to have had a positive impact on fish populations.  Game fish are abundant and are experiencing rapid growth rates.  This rapid growth results in desirable size structures and quality angling opportunities.  Largemouth bass, black crappie, and walleye prospects are outstanding and the presence of young fish in the populations of all three species is promising for future years.   Northern pike catches do not accurately describe the quality of the fishery.  Local three species tournaments are almost always won by nice stringers of northern pike.  The muskie stocking program in Oscar Lake was discontinued in 1990 because of strong local dissent, rather than any sound biological reason.  The fish remaining are large and provide quality angling opportunities.  Anglers have reported catching fish up to 48 inches in length.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Oscar is a shallow, 1,040-acre natural basin located just west of Holmes City in western Douglas County.  Maximum depth is near 20 ft.  Water clarity typically exceeds 6.0 ft. during summer months.  Lake Oscar supports a diverse fish community and offers a wide range of fishing opportunities.  Primary management programming is directed at walleye.  Muskellunge and sunfishes are identified as species of secondary management importance. <br> \n <br> \nSurvey data describe an excellent walleye fishery.  Gillnet catches during the 2006 survey were lower than 2002 catches, but yet well beyond typical catch rates for similar lakes.  Walleye fingerlings are stocked on an alternate year frequency.  Age distribution of 2006 captures correlated well with stocking chronology.  The basin's high quality fishery is attributable to fast growth.  Young walleye grow to a harvestable size by age-3.  Older walleye in the 2006 population sample averaged 16.8 inches in length at age-4.  Mean size was 17.5 inches and 2.4 pounds.  Thirty-six percent of walleye captured during the 2006 survey exceeded 20.0 inches in length.   <br> \n <br> \nLake Oscar is one of three lakes within the Glenwood Fisheries Management Area supporting a muskellunge fishery.   Fingerlings are stocked periodically to compensate for annual mortality and sustain a low-density population of large gamefish.  Angler reports and survey findings indicate that muskie exceeding 50.0 inches reside in the lake.   <br> \n <br> \nKey members of the sunfish family include largemouth bass, bluegill, and black crappie. Largemouth bass and bluegill catches are increasing in probable response to increased vegetation and improving water clarity.  Largemouth bass can be qualified as moderately abundant.  Growth remains above average even though population density has increased.  Forty percent of bass captured exceeded 15.0 inches in length.  Fishing quality, in terms of average size, is very good, but harvest and old age have taken a toll.  No 20.0-inch and larger bass were recorded in 2002 and 2006 surveys.   Bluegill catch rate increased substantially in 2006 due to good reproductive success and survival of young fish in 2001, 2002, and 2003.  Growth has slowed with increasing population abundance.  Slower growth and size selective harvest of larger fish have eroded fishing quality.  No 8.0-inch or larger bluegill were captured in 2006, but with time members of the 2001 year class should reach 8.0 inches in length in 2009.  Lake Oscar and similar basins tend to support greater numbers of black crappie than many other lake-types.  Crappie were well represented in the 2006 survey stock; however, catch statistics among recent surveys may indicate a trend toward decreasing abundance.  A net decline could be anticipated with changing habitat conditions supporting expansion of other sunfishes.  Fishing remains good, but tends to be seasonal.   Most harvest occurs in early spring and winter.  Fishing quality is good due to above average growth and longevity of the population.  Eight-year-old crappie were common in 2006 survey catches.  Twelve-inch black crappie were common in net catches. <br> \n <br> \nA small public access is located on the north shoreline off CSAH 27.  Parking space is limited.  Boaters are cautioned that submerged tree stumps are common in shallow areas.   Eurasian water milfoil, a harmful exotic plant species, is present in Lake Oscar.  Anglers and other recreational boaters can do their part by exercising preventive measures to prevent of this deleterious exotic.

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Oscar is a shallow, 1,191-acre basin located west of Holmes City in southwestern Douglas County.  Maximum depth is approximately 25.0 feet.  The lake is very productive since 70% of the basin area is less than 15.0 feet in depth.  Due to shallowness of the lake, strong winds can mix the lake and prevent or break down thermal stratification during summer months.  Fish could occupy the entire lake at time of the late-July 2014 survey.  Coolwater fishes may be periodically stressed by high summer water temperatures and lack of thermal refuge.   Water temperatures approached or exceeded 73 degrees F throughout the lake in late July.  Water clarity averages 8.1 feet during the summer. <br> \n   <br> \nWalleye fingerlings are stocked annually to sustain the desired population abundance objective.  Gillnet catches during the 2014 survey averaged 5.8 walleye/net.   This catch rate was a modest decline from preceding surveys, but above expectations for lakes similar to Lake Oscar.  Eight age classes of walleye were captured.  Age distribution extended to age 16.  Size at capture ranged from 8.2 to 24.5 inches.  The majority of Walleye captures in 2014 were relatively young fish.  Average size was 15.0 inches.   Nineteen percent of Walleyes captured during the 2014 survey exceeded 20.0 inches in length. <br> \n <br> \nLake Oscar is one of the three lakes within the Glenwood Fisheries Management Area stocked with Muskellunge to sustain a low-density population and support a unique fishery.   Muskellunge are not abundant, but through multiple catch and release, fishing quality is good.  Average length of muskellunge captured during the 2014 spring population assessment was 42.6 inches.  Captures averaged 21.0 pounds each.  Two captures exceeded 50.0 inches in length.  The largest capture measured 51.6 inches. <br> \n <br> \nSurvey statistics described a low-density Northern Pike population that should support quality fishing experiences.  Mean length and weight of Northern Pike captures was 23.4 inches and 2.7 pounds.  Sixteen percent of captures exceeded 28.0 inches.  The largest pike measured 31.5 inches. <br> \n <br> \nLake Oscar supported an exceptional Largemouth Bass fishery for many years following a six-foot increase in water elevation through the late-1980s and 1990s and associated habitat expansion.  Population attributes have moderated over the last decade with attainment of an adjusted carrying capacity, flooded timber decay, and a steadily declining water level.  Largemouth Bass continue to be moderately abundant, but rate of growth and average size have declined.  No memorable-size bass (> 20.0 inches) have been captured since the 1998 survey.  Average size of 2014 electrofishing captures was 11.2 inches.  The proportion of 15.0-inch and larger captures in the population sample decreased from approximately 40% in 2006 and 2010, to 17%. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill catches in recent surveys have greatly exceeded those of early surveys.  High catches during the 2014 survey were attributable to recruitment of three very strong year classes established in 2009, 2010, 2011.  Average size of the trapnet catch was 5.3 inches in length due to the high relative proportion of young fish making up gill net and trap net population catches.  Eighty-nine percent of the total Bluegill catch was comprised of five-year-old and younger captures.  Fortunately, Bluegill growth remains acceptable and fishing quality will improve.   Cohorts of the strong 2009 year class averaged 6.8 inches in length at time of capture.  It is noted however, that Bluegills exceeding 8.0 inches have been rare catches throughout surveys dating back to 1994. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie catches were modest during the late-July survey.  More and larger fish were captured in gillnets suggesting this species was likely suspended in deeper water rather than occupying shoreline habitat.  Population density was likely greater than reflected in survey catch rates.  Seven age class were identified in survey catches.  Average size of captures was 9.0 inches.  Growth remains rapid with age-4 fish averaging 8.8 inches.  Local anglers reported good success catching Black Crappies during the winter and spring months of recent years. <br> \n <br> \nIf planning to fish Lake Oscar, a small public access is located on the north shoreline off Highway 27.  Parking space is limited.  Boaters are also cautioned that submerged tree stumps are common in shallow areas.   Eurasian watermilfoil, a harmful exotic plant species, is present in Lake Oscar.  Anglers and recreational boaters can do their part by exercising preventative measures to prevent spread of this and other exotic invasives. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of the nearshore fish community in Oscar Lake was conducted by Fisheries Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program Staff starting August 20, 2018. Fourteen sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 15-foot or 50-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at all 14 sites. Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample eight sites, a 15-foot seine was used at 2 sites, and soft sediments with abundant vegetation and deep water prevented the use of seines at four. Nearshore sampling captured 14 native species of fish including two species that are intolerant of disturbance (Banded Killifish and Iowa Darter) and one species that is tolerant of disturbance (Green Sunfish). <br> \n <br> \nData from this targeted nearshore survey is combined with trap net and gill net data from a July 2018 standard survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based Index of Biological Integrity (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment. The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. The FIBI score for Oscar Lake from this survey is very high and well above an impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes. For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website. <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Chippewa River Watershed assessment of surface waters process completed in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency. </p>",

The 1+ Walleyes positively correspond with a 1986 fingerling stocking. The 2+ Walleyes do not match any recorded stocking and are probably 3+ walleyes that were not aged accurately or carry over Walleye in ponds from the 1986 stocking. The 3+ Walleyes would match nicely with a strong 1984 fingerling stocking. It is unlikely that natural reproduction would produce a year-class as strong as this survey indicated. Largemouth Bass were sampled for the first time by a boom electrofisher. The number of fish sampled per hour was not particularly high because of the difficulty in sampling timer, but the size was quite large by local comparison and the growth rate is very good.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Oscar Lake is a shallow, productive basin located four miles west of Holmes City.  Surface acreage and depth of the lake increased greatly with heavy rains and storm water runoff in the mid-1980s.  Following installation of an outlet culvert, lake levels have stabilized.  Current surface water area of the basin is digitized at 1,231 acres.  Maximum depth is 25.0 feet.  Average depth of the lake is estimated at 13.0 feet.  Submerged tree stumps are common in shallow areas.  Water transparency has improved over time to average approximately 7.0 feet during summer months.  Due to expanses of shallow water and increasing water clarity, Lake Oscar supports a robust community of submergent aquatic plants, which includes Eurasian watermilfoil.  Public access is located on the north shore, just off MN-27.  Oscar Lake supports abundant Largemouth Bass and panfish populations.  Walleyes and Muskellunge are stocked to sustain fishable populations. <br> \n <br> \nMultiple fisheries surveys were completed on Oscar Lake in 2018.  A Muskellunge population assessment occurred May 7-15.  An electrofishing survey was completed on May 29 to gain estimates of Largemouth Bass abundance and population size distribution.  The netting component of a standard fisheries survey was completed July 30-August 2.  A combination of 12 gill nets and 12 trap nets were used to sample the fish community. <br> \n   <br> \nA total of 21 Muskellunge were captured in early May.  Lengths varied from 32.2 to 49.6 inches.  Fifty-two percent of Muskellunge sampled exceeded 42.0 inches.  Oscar Lake's Muskellunge fishery is supported with an alternate year stocking of 160 fingerlings.  Current survey results indicate Oscar Lake continues to support a low-density, high-quality Muskellunge fishery. <br> \n   <br> \nThe abundance and diversity of aquatic plants and flooded timber provide great habitat for Largemouth Bass in Oscar Lake.  Daytime electrofishing catches were lower than anticipated, but the catch rate of 37.1 bass/hour of effort described a moderately-abundant population.  Bass captures ranged from 8.6 to 18.2 inches in total length. Forty-three percent of the total catch measured 15.0 inches and larger.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye catches were lower than previous surveys, but the catch rate of 3.3 fish/gill net remains well within the range of expected catches for similar lakes in Minnesota.  Walleye fingerlings and yearlings are stocked on alternate years to supplement natural reproduction.  The largest Walleye measured 27.2 inches.  Sixty-five percent of Walleyes exceeded 15.0 inches. <br> \n   <br> \nOscar Lake supports good panfishing opportunities.  Black Crappies continue to be abundant in response to elevated annual recruitment in 2014, 2016, and 2017.  Age distribution of crappie captures extended to age 9, so 34% of the catch was comprised of 10.0-inch and larger fish.  Those fish seven-years-old and older were 12.0 inches or larger.  Bluegills also proved to be abundant.  Bluegill captures averaged 6.2 inches in length.  The largest capture measured 8.9 inches.  Four percent of Bluegills captured in trap nets exceeded 8.0 inches.  Yellow Perch catches were relatively high, but very few were large enough to harvest.  Average size of perch captures was 7.1 inches. <br> \n <br> \nEurasian watermilfoil has been present in Oscar Lake since 1992.  No other invasive species have been documented.  Anglers are reminded to drain boats and equipment prior to moving between bodies of water to minimize the risk of transferring aquatic invasive species to this or other lakes. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Oscar Lake is a shallow, moderately productive basin located four miles west of Holmes City in Douglas County.  Surface acreage and depth of the lake increased greatly with heavy rains and storm water runoff in the mid-1980s.  Following installation of an outlet culvert, lake levels have stabilized.  Current surface water area of the basin is 1,231 acres.  Maximum depth is 25 feet.  Average depth of the lake is estimated at 13 feet.  Water transparency has improved over time to average nearly 8 feet during summer months. A trend in increasing water clarity is expected to continue with the discovery of zebra mussels in 2019. Due to 70% of Oscar Lake being less than 15 feet in depth, wind events can temporarily reduce water clarity well below average. Expanses of shallow and clearer water has resulted in Oscar Lake supporting a robust community of submerged aquatic plants, which includes invasive Eurasian watermilfoil.  A public access is located on the north shore, just off MN-27.  Oscar Lake supports abundant Largemouth Bass, Northern Pike, and panfish populations.  Walleyes and Muskellunge are stocked to sustain fishable populations.\n\nA standard fisheries survey was completed in August of 2022 to evaluate abundance and size distribution of gamefish populations. Walleye catches were lower than the historical average for Oscar Lake, but the catch rate of 3.8 fish/gill net remains within the range of expected catches for similar lakes in Minnesota.  Walleye fingerlings are stocked on alternate years to supplement natural reproduction. Yearling Walleye have occasionally been stocked when fingerling availability was limited. The largest Walleye measured was over 26 inches.  Seventy percent of Walleyes exceeded 15 inches.\n\nCatch rates of Northern Pike (7.8/gill net) have significantly increased from the previous survey (4.5/gill net).  Forty-six percent of pike sampled ranged from 14 to 22 inches in length.  In 2022, mean size was almost 23 inches and 2.6 pounds. The largest pike sampled measured 33 inches.  Anglers are reminded that new pike zone regulations were implemented in 2018.  Oscar Lake is located in the North-central Zone.  Anglers can now keep up to 10 pike but not more than two can be over 26 inches in length.  All pike between 22-26 inches must be immediately released. Harvesting smaller pike will help shift the population back towards larger individuals and reduce the number of predators for young Walleye and other gamefish.\n \nThe abundance and diversity of aquatic plants and flooded timber provide great habitat for Largemouth Bass in Oscar Lake.  Daytime electrofishing catches were the highest on record, and the catch rate of 61 bass/hour of effort described an abundant population.  Bass captures ranged from 6 to 18 inches in total length. Thirty-two percent of the total catch measured 15 inches and larger.\n \nBluegill catch rates averaged 20.3 fish/trap net, which is above average for Oscar Lake. Gill net catch rates of 31.5 Bluegill/net were also higher than average, suggesting fish had moved offshore at the time of the early-August survey. Growth rates are moderate and 7 year old Bluegill averaged almost 8 inches in length. Very few Bluegill over 8 inches were caught during the survey, with the largest fish measuring under 9 inches. Similar to the Bluegill catch, a majority of Black Crappie were captured in offshore gill nets.  Black Crappie catch rates of 4.0 fish/gill net were the second lowest over the past two decades. Growth rates are moderate; average length of age 4 fish was over 9 inches. The largest Black Crappie in the sample was over 11 inches and the oldest crappie was 7 years old.\n\nYellow Perch abundance continues to decline, and their sizes are less than desirable for angling.  Yellow Perch are an important prey species for the lake's predator population and catch rates of perch have been negatively correlated with Northern Pike catch rates.  Other fishes caught during the 2022 survey include Green Sunfish, Hybrid Sunfish, Pumpkinseed, White Sucker, and multiple species of bullheads. \n\nTypically, very few Muskellunge are caught during the summer survey.  For additional information on the Muskellunge population, a targeted muskie population estimate will be completed during 2024-2025.\n\nOscar Lake was designated as an infested water after the discovery of Eurasian watermilfoil in 1992. More recently, zebra mussels were discovered in 2019. Recreational users should take necessary precautions to prevent further spread of invasive species.  Drain all water and remove all aquatic vegetation from your boat and trailer when leaving any body of water.\n</p>",

Northern Pike numbers also would appear to have increased, however special follow-up on gill net testing conducted in 1979 indicated Northern Pike numbers were much higher than the 1978 lake survey indicated. Low Yellow Perch indices would also suggest that higher Northern Pike levels existed. In 1983 Yellow Perch abundance has dramatically increased and a Northern Pike population near the area median was documented. Walleye abundance has not changed since the last survey, however, the population that existed in 1978 consisted entirely of age 5+ fish. In 1983 these fish have been lost from the fishery and have been replaced by younger fish from the fingerlings stocking of 1980..</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Oscar is primarily managed for walleye with sunfish and muskellunge being species of secondary management importance.  The current walleye population is the best it has been in many years.  In fact, catch rates in 2002 were the highest they have been in over 20 years.  Anglers should expect good numbers of quality-sized fish.  Approximately 56% of the 2002 sample exceeded 15 inches and 18% exceeded 20 inches.  Walleye fingerlings are stocked every other year and this stocking program appears to be successful in sustaining this viable fishery.  Other species exhibiting population characteristics worthy of angler pursuit include black crappie, largemouth bass, and muskellunge.  Black crappie are relatively abundant and most fish are moderate in size.  Anglers targeting largemouth bass should expect moderate numbers of medium-sized fish.  Larger bass are also present but they are not overly abundant.  Lake Oscar is home to a unique muskellunge fishery and it is one of only three lakes within the Glenwood Management Area that receives maintenance stockings of muskellunge fingerlings.  Fingerling stockings help maintain this population but natural reproduction has also been documented.  Thus, protecting prime muskie habitat is essential in sustaining this unique resource.  Anglers pursuing muskellunge will find low to moderate numbers of fish and most fish will be of average size.  Lake Oscar is capable of producing trophy-sized muskies; angler reports and survey findings indicate that fish exceeding 45 inches are not uncommon.  Bluegill, northern pike, and yellow perch are other game fishes present in Lake Oscar.  Generally, abundance of these three species is moderate but the majority of fish are smaller individuals. Eurasian water milfoil, a harmful exotic plant species, is present in Lake Oscar.  Its presence was first confirmed in 1992 in a limited area of the lake but it has since spread to other areas of the basin.  Currently, the native aquatic plant community is healthy and should help retard the future spread of this exotic weed.  Anglers and others pursuing aquatic recreation on Lake Oscar can do their part by exercising preventive measures that prohibit the spread of this deleterious exotic.          </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Oscar is a shallow, 1,040-acre basin located west of Holmes City in southwestern Douglas County.  Maximum depth is near 20 feet.  Water clarity at time of the August survey was 5.2 feet.   Lake Oscar supports a diverse fish community and offers a wide range of fishing opportunities.  Primary management programming is directed at walleye.  Muskellunge and sunfishes are species of secondary management importance. <br> \n <br> \nSurvey statistics describe an excellent walleye fishery.  Gillnet catches during the 2010 survey averaged 9.1- walleye/net which is higher than expected catches for similar lakes.  Walleye fingerlings are stocked on an annual frequency.  Age distribution of 2010 captures correlated well with stocking chronology.  The basin's high quality fishery is attributable to fast growth.  Young walleye grow to a harvestable size by age-3.  Older walleye in the 2010 population sample averaged 17.0 inches in length at age-4.  Twenty-two percent of walleye captured during the 2010 survey exceeded 20.0 inches in length. <br> \n <br> \nLake Oscar is one of the three lakes within the Glenwood Fisheries Management Area supporting a muskellunge fishery.  Fingerlings are stocked periodically to compensate for annual mortality and sustain a low-density population of large gamefish.  Muskellunge are not abundant, but through multiple catch and release, fishing quality is good.  Average length of muskellunge captured in a spring population assessment was 42.0 inches.  Captures averaged 19.6 lbs each.  Angler reports and survey findings indicate that muskie exceeding 49.0 inches reside in the lake. <br> \n <br> \nKey members of the sunfish family include largemouth bass, bluegill, and black crappie.  Largemouth bass are moderately abundant.  Forty-two percent of captured bass exceeded 15.0 inches in length.  Fishing quality, in terms of average size, is very good, but harvest, hooking mortality and old age may have taken a toll.  No 20.0-inch and larger bass were sampled in 2002, 2006 and 2010 surveys.    A moderate decrease in bluegill abundance was recorded in 2010. Growth rates improved with decreased abundance.   No 8.0-inch or larger fish were captured in 2010.  The current population is dominated by young fish which should provide quality angling in 2012.  Black crappie were well represented in the 2010 survey.  Fishing remains good, but tends to be seasonal.  Most harvest occurs in early spring and winter.  Fewer 12.0-inch and larger fish were sampled in 2010 than were reported in the 2000 survey. <br> \n <br> \nA small public access is located on the north shoreline off Highway 27.  Parking space is limited.  Boaters are cautioned that submerged tree stumps are common in shallow areas.  Eurasian water milfoil, a harmful exotic plant species, is present in Lake Oscar.  Anglers and recreational boaters can do their part by exercising preventative measures to prevent spread of this and other exotic invasives <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Walleye gill net catches averaged 4.75 fish/net night in 1990.  This rate is lower than the 12.0 fish/net night captured in 1987, but is similar to assessment nettings in 1965, 1978, and 1983.  Eighty-seven percent of the Walleye captured in 1987 were cohorts of the 1986 and 1985 year classes.  Fingerlings were stocked in 1986 but there was no stocking in 1985.  The 1985 year class may not have been the result of natural reproduction, but rather the stocking of carry-over fish (1+) in 1986 or inaccurate aging of age 2 fish.  The age class distribution of Walleye captured in 1990 correlates well with previous fingerling stockings.  Cohorts of the 1989 year class comprised 29% of the catch.  Fingerlings were stocked at a rate of 1.5lbs/littoral acre in the fall of 1989 and 0.5lbs/littoral acre of carry-over fish were stocked in the spring of 1990.  The 1984 and 1986 year classes comprised 18% and 24% of the catch, respectively.  These year classes correlate with fingerling stockings in those years.  Only the 1987 fingerling stocking failed to produce a viable year class.  PSD was calculated at 93% and RSD P-M was 57%.  Mean weight of fish captured as 2.2lbs.  Growth is good through age 4 with age 4 fish averaging 17.1 inches in length.  Growth appears to slow after age 4.  Age 7 fish averaged only 20.4 inches in length.  Mean relative weight of stock-length (10.0 -14.9) inches and quality-length (15.0-19.9 inches ) fish was 101.8 and 96.1 respectively.  The mean relative weight of the fish measuring more than 20 inches in length fell to 89.4.  The decline in relative weight correlates with the reduced growth rates of fish over 15.0 inches in length.  Northern Pike abundance remains low.  Gillnet catch rates averaged 1.25 fish/net night.  Catches averaged 5.9 fish/net night and 3.5 fish/net night in 1983 and 1987, respectively.  All ten of the fish collected were 21.0-26.9 inches in length, resulting in PSD of 100%.  Mean weight of fish captured was 3.7 lbs.  Bluegill catch rates averaged 11.8 fish/trap net.  This compares to catch rates of 34.4 fish/net and 9.3 fish/net in 1983 and 1987, respectively.  The present population is composed primarily of small fish.  PSD was calculated at 5.0%.  Mean weight of captured fish was 0.12 lbs.  The statewide crappie research project recorded a Bluegill CPUE of 8.3 fish/trap net and a PSD of 10.0% size structure observed in previous surveys was more favorable.  A PSD of 36.0% and 66.0% were calculated in 1983 and 1987, respectively.  The decline in PSDs can be attributed to the absence of fish ages 4 and older in the present population and thus a shift to a greater percentage of young fish.  Mean relative weights were calculated from data collected in the statewide crappie project.  The mean relative weight of stock and quality-size fish both exceeded 110.  This is surprising considering that the growth would appear below average.  Age 3 fish averaged 4.5 inches in length.  Black Crappie trapnet catch rates increased from 2.0 fish/net night in 1987 to 8.4 fish/net night in 1990. Concurrently, PSD values dropped from 67 % to 45 .0%.  Mean weight of crappie captured was 0.35lbs.  Unfortunately there were no scale samples taken for age and growth analysis.  The statewide crappie research project trapnet CPUE was 2.4 fish /net night.  PSD was calculated at 80% with a RSD P-M of 37%.  This may illustrate the inherent variability of data derived from trapnet catches or the effect of seasonality on trap net catches.  Yellow Perch abundance declined significantly from the two prior surveys.  CPUE averaged 3.9 fish/gillnet in 1990.  This compares to catch rates of 61.4 fish/gill net and 36.0 fish/gill net in 1983 and 1987, respectively.  The low catch rate may be attributed to sampling bias of the experimental gill net.  It is uncommon to catch Yellow Perch less than 4.0 inches in length in gill nets.  However, numerous Yellow Perch less than 4.0 inches were gillnetted in the 3/4 Muskellunge assessment.  The majority of fish collected in the gill nets were 5.0-6.0 calculated at 0.0% PSD has remained at 0.0% for the past 4 surveys.  Mean weight of fish captured was 0.14 lbs.  Only two Muskellunge were captured during the spring Muskellunge population assessment. This resulted in a CPUE of 0.02 fish/trap net.  The fish were ages 3 and 4 and were 26.1 and 32.9 inches in length, respectively.  Trap net catch data for Muskellunge is highly variable and may not represent the true status of the population. Thirty one Largemouth Bass were captured during the spring Muskellunge assessment netting.  Size structure and growth rate would indicate a favorable Largemouth Bass population.  An electrofishing survey is needed to accurately assess the population status.  Rough fish abundance is considered moderate.  Carp catch rate averaged 1.9 fish/gill net.  Mean weight of fish captured was 5.2 lbs.  Large schools of fish, presumably Carp, were detected with sonar in January of 1991.  However the morphological characteristics of the lake and the presence of standing timber may limit or prohibit commercial seining operations.</p>",

Oscar Lake was first stocked with Muskellunge in 1985.  Stocking rate and frequency has evolved to biennial stockings of 160 fingerlings.\n \nA survey was conducted May 7-16, 2018 to assess the adult Muskellunge population in Oscar Lake. Ten large frame (5 x 6 foot) trap nets were set for a total of nine days. Water temperature ranged from 53 to 57 degrees Fahrenheit during the sampling period.  Twenty-one Muskellunge were captured, which yielded a catch rate of 0.23 fish/trap net-day.  Catch rates in prior surveys ranged from 0.08 to 0.19 fish/set-day.  Length of captured fish ranged from 32.2 to 49.7 inches.  Average length was 42.1 inches, which is approximately a 19.0 pound fish.  No trophy-size Muskellunge measuring 50 inches or larger were captured during the 2018 survey, but quality fishing opportunities exist.  Fifty-two percent of captures were memorable-size fish exceeding 42 inches in length.\n \nThe current statewide Muskellunge regulation is a 54-inch minimum length limit. All muskies less than 54.0 inches in total length (tip of closed mouth to tip of closed tail fin) must be released immediately.\n</p>",
