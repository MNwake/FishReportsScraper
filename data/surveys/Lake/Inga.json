The lake can be accessed via a non-maintained logging road to a carry down access and then by traveling 0.3 miles up the narrow outlet channel. Travel by canoe is recommended, as periods of low water prohibit travel by boat and motor. The fish community in Inga Lake is comprised of northern pike, yellow perch, and various minnow species. The northern pike population is maintained through natural reproduction and does not require stocking.    <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike were sampled in above average numbers in 2006, and the catch was somewhat higher than catches in previous assessments. Average weight was 2.5 pounds with fish up to 26.4 inches (4.2 pounds) sampled. Most of the northern pike sampled in this assessment were between 22 and 25 inches. Growth rates for northern pike collected in this assessment were average despite what appears to be a lack of forage. Only two yellow perch were collected in gillnets in this assessment.     <br> \n</p>",

From the Mitawan Lake Road (FS 177), about 1.1 miles past FS Rd. 177E there is a two track road that goes 0.25 miles east to the outlet creek; it is a 0.30 mile paddle up the outlet creek to the lake.  The creek is only suitable for canoes and narrow, shallow draft boats.  Inga Lake has an area of 41 acres and a maximum depth of 6.0 feet.  The lake is the headwaters of Inga Creek, a designated trout stream that flows north out of the lake.   <br> \n <br> \nA survey was conducted on Inga Lake during June of 2016 to assess the state of the fish populations and the habitat in the lake.  The lake bed consists of muck and detritus with a few areas of boulders.  A total of 22 types of aquatic and riparian plants were observed during the survey.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike catch was near average when compared to similar lakes.  Average weight of Northern Pike was 2.3 pounds, also near average when compared to similar lakes.  Average length was 20.2 inches with fish up to 32.7 inches long sampled.  A total of seven year classes were observed with the oldest fish being age-7, the 2012 year class made up 55 percent of the catch.  Growth of Northern Pike was average when compared to similar lakes. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch catch was low relative to similar lakes.  Average weight was also low at only 0.09 pounds.  The maximum length of Yellow Perch sampled was 7.6 inches and the average length was 6.6 inches.  Growth was fast when compared to similar lakes.  The only other species sampled in the lake were Blacknose Shiner and Iowa Darter. <br> \n <br> \nInga Lake is small and remote with difficult access.  The lake is scenic and offers seclusion that may be of interest to canoers.  From an angling perspective, the lake offers good opportunities to catch Northern Pike.  The Yellow Perch in the lake are probably not abundant enough or large enough to be worth pursuing.    <br> \n</p>",
