                "narrative": "<p>Hovde Lake is a 131-acre lake located near Walker, Minnesota that has 3.7 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 26 feet.  There is an earthen boat launch on US Forest Service land on the north shore.  The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MNDNR) has classified Minnesota lakes into 43 different classes based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics.  Hovde Lake is in Lake Class 35; lakes in this class are generally irregularly shaped lakes with predominately shallow water. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass are abundant and fish up to 15 inches were sampled.  A catch-and-release regulation for largemouth bass has been in place since 2002 to increase the overall size structure of the population.  Black crappie and bluegill were sampled for the first time and are likely the result of illegal stocking.  Other fish species present are walleye, white sucker, and yellow perch.      <br> \n <br> \nAnglers can help maintain or improve the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for table fare, but encourages release of medium- to large-sized fish.  Releasing these fish can help maintain balance in the fish community in Hovde Lake and provide anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future.. <br> \n <br> \nHovde Lake is not currently known to be infested with any aquatic invasive species (AIS).  To avoid spreading AIS, lakes users should inspect and remove any aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat away from the landing prior to launching and again before leaving the access.  If you suspect you may have discovered a new infestation of an invasive species, save a specimen and report it to a local natural resource office.  Additional information on AIS prevention and awareness, including problems they cause, can be found on the DNR website (www.dnr.state.mn.us)  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Hovde Lake is a 133-acre lake located near Walker, Minnesota that has 3.7 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 26 feet.  The lake is entirely within the Chippewa National Forest. There is an earthen boat launch on US Forest Service land on the north shore.  The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MNDNR) has classified Minnesota lakes into 43 different classes based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics.  Hovde Lake is in Lake Class 35. Lakes in this class are generally irregularly shaped lakes with predominately shallow water. Similar Lake Class 35 lakes in the Walker Area include Big Bass, Big Sand, and McKeown. A Largemouth Bass catch-and-release regulation was implemented in 2003. The purpose of this survey was to assess Black Crappie, Bluegill, and Largemouth Bass populations and included spring electrofishing and trap netting. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass are abundant and fish up to 17 inches long were sampled. Black Crappie and Bluegill were first sampled in 2008. Since then, the numbers of Black Crappie and Bluegill steadily increased and quality-sized fish of both species are present in this lake. Other fish species present are Golden Shiner, Walleye, White Sucker, and Yellow Perch. <br> \n <br> \nPeople can have significant impacts on lakes and the fish populations they support.  Harvest, lakeshore development, removal of shoreline vegetation, and introductions of invasive species can all adversely affect fish populations.  Currently no aquatic invasive species (AIS) have been identified in Hovde Lake.  AIS are moved from infested to non-infested waters by anglers, boaters, and lake shore owners and can adversely impact lakes and fish populations.  To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access.  If you suspect an infestation of an invasive species in this lake, save a specimen and report it to a local natural resource office.  Additional information on all of these topics can be found on the DNR website (www.dnr.state.mn.us) or by contacting the Walker Area Fisheries office. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Hovde is a 131-acre lake located 6 miles south and 6 miles east of Walker, Minnesota.  Hovde has a maximum depth of 26 feet with 88 percent of the lake 15 feet or less in depth.  There is an US Forest Service public access, suitable for small boat trailers, on the north end of Hovde, and a walking trail through Forest Service land reaches the south end of the lake. The entire shoreline of Hovde Lake is in public ownership (Chippewa National Forest).The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has categorized Minnesota's lakes into 43 different classes based on each lake's physical and chemical characteristics.  Hovde is in Lake Class 35.  Other local lakes in this classification include Big Bass (6 miles south of Walker), McKeown (6 miles southwest of Longville) and Swamp (8 miles north of Walker). In July 1961, DNR chemically treated Hovde Lake to kill its existing fish population.  At the time of the treatment the plan was to use the lake as a walleye rearing area, though in 1964 muskellunge fry were stocked in Hovde, apparently in an effort to use it for rearing muskellunge.   Since treatment, the number of species found in Hovde Lake has been gradually increasing.   In the 1979 survey, golden shiner, white sucker and walleye were reported, but no yellow perch were collected.  In the 1985 and 1986 assessments yellow perch were abundant.  The 1995 survey was the first to sample largemouth bass and black bullhead. The 1995 gill net catch rate of walleye in Hovde was 6.3 fish/net, slightly less than the 8.0 walleye/net found in the 1990 assessment but well above the average for this lake class. Some natural reproduction of walleye has occurred on Hovde Lake, however no walleye smaller than 16 inches or younger than age four were sampled during the 1995 survey. Sampled walleye had an average length and weight of 20.9 inches and 3.2 lbs.  The growth rate was slightly faster than other Walker area lakes and had an average length of 16.8 inches at age four.  Hovde Lake has an abundant white sucker population.  Gill net catches of this species since 1979 have been well above the average for this type of lake.  White sucker collected by trap net and gill net ranged from 8.0 to 18.9 inches.  The gill net catches of yellow perch in 1995 (3.0 fish/net) and 1990 (3.5 fish/net) were below average for this lake type.  Yellow perch sampled in 1995 ranged from 5.0 to 11.9 inches.Though 1995 was the first Hovde Lake survey in which largemouth bass were sampled, catch rates for both gill nets and trap nets were above average for this lake class.  Sampled largemouth bass ranged from 6.0 to 13.9 inches.  Growth of this species was similar to that found in other surveys of local lakes.  Average length of largemouth bass at age three was 9.4 inches.To help maintain quality fish populations in Hovde Lake, lake users should safeguard aquatic habitats by preserving or reestablishing aquatic plants and natural shorelines.  Aquatic and terrestrial plants provide food and cover for fish and wildlife. They also help protect shorelines from erosion, and absorb nutrients and pollutants.  Natural shorelines, shorelines that have not been altered by man, help protect a lake from silt-laden runoff waters. They also provide excellent places for wildlife to feed, hide, and raise their young. Protection of the Hovde Lake watershed is also  needed for maintaining  water quality.Anglers can help maintain or improve the quality of fishing by practicing catch and release of medium to large-sized fish. Releasing these fish will help maintain the fish population in Hovde Lake and provides anglers with more opportunities to catch more large fish in the future.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Status of the Fishery     Hovde Lake is a 131-acre lake located 6 miles south and 6 miles east of Walker, Minnesota.  Hovde has a maximum depth of 26 feet with 88 percent of the lake 15 feet or less in depth.  There is an earthen US Forest Service public access, suitable for a small boat trailer, on the north end of Hovde, and a walking trail through Forest Service land on the south end of the lake.  The entire shoreline of Hovde Lake is in public ownership (Chippewa National Forest).     The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has categorized Minnesota's lakes into 43 different classes based on each lake's physical and chemical characteristics.  Hovde Lake is in Lake Class 35, and Lake Class 35 lakes can be summarized as irregular shaped lakes with high turdibity.       In July 1961, DNR chemically treated Hovde Lake to kill its existing fish population.  At the time of the treatment, the plan was to use the lake as a walleye rearing area, though in 1964 muskellunge fry were stocked in Hovde Lake, in an effort to use it for rearing muskellunge.     Since the treatment, the number of species found in Hovde Lake has been gradually increasing.  The 1979 survey reported that golden shiner, white sucker, and walleye were collected.  In the 1985 and 1986 assessments, yellow perch were abundant.  The 1995 resurvey was the first to collect largemouth bass and black bullhead.  No additional species were collected in 2000.        The catch rates for largemouth bass were above average for this lake type.  Growth of largemouth bass was above average for other local lakes with the mean length at age 3 of 10.3 inches.  Largemouth bass sampled in the 2000 survey ranged from 4 to 17 inches.         The gill net catch rate for walleye was below average for this lake type.  Natural reproduction has occurred in the past along with fry stocking.  The success of fry stocking in 1999 was limited because no small walleye were collected in 2000.  No walleye smaller than 17 inches were sampled and the youngest walleye was five years old.  Sampled walleye had an average length and weight of 21 inches and 3.3 pounds so good quality walleyes were available for anglers.  Growth of walleye was above average compared to other local lakes.          The gill net catch rate for yellow perch in 2000 was above average for this lake type.  Yellow perch sampled in 2000 ranged from 5 to 9 inches.  Yellow perch provide a good forage base for largemouth bass and walleye.       Anglers can help maintain or improve the quality of fishing by practicing catch and release of medium to large-sized fish.  Releasing these fish will help maintain the fish population in Hovde Lake and provides anglers with more opportunities to catch more large fish in the future.  As of December 2000, an experimental regulation intended to improve or maintain largemouth bass fishing is being proposed. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Hovde Lake is a 131-acre lake located near Walker, Minnesota that has 3.7 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 26 feet.  There is an earthen boat launch on US Forest Service land on the north shore.  The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MNDNR) has classified Minnesota lakes into 43 different classes based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics.  Hovde Lake is in Lake Class 35; lakes in the class are generally irregularly shaped lakes with predominately shallow water.  This lake is primarily managed for walleye and largemouth bass and secondarily for yellow perch.       Walleye are present in Hovde Lake, and the mean length of fish sampled was 16.5 inches.  Largemouth bass are abundant and fish up to 15 inches were sampled.  There is a catch-and-release regulation for largemouth bass, which has been in place since 2002.  Other fish species present are white sucker and yellow perch.     Anglers can help maintain or improve the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for table fare, but encourages release of medium- to large-sized fish.  Releasing these fish can help maintain balance in the fish community in Hovde Lake and provide anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future.</p>",

YELLOW PERCH AND GOLDEN SHINERS ALSO PROVIDE EXCELLENT FORAGE FOR WALLEYE.WALLEYE FROM 9 TO 26 INCHES WERE SAMPLED.  NOT ALL WALLEYE YEAR CLASSES WERE SAMPLED, EVEN THOUGH WALLEYE FRY WERE STOCKED DURING THOSE YEARS.  STOCKING RECORDS INDICATE NO WALLEYE WERE STOCKED DURING 1985 AND 1984.  AGEING OF WALLEYE INDICATES THAT THESE YEAR CLASSES ARE PRESENT IN HOVDE LAKE.</p>",
