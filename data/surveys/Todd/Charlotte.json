                "narrative": "<p>   Charlotte Lake is a fairly small, deep lake of 148 acres in size with a maximum depth of 84 feet.  The lake is located on the south side of the City of Long Prairie and has a good access with a concrete boat ramp along with a fishing pier.  Water clarity at the end of June was good with a secchi disk reading of 13.8 feet.  The lake has relatively fast drop-offs around the lake which limits the amount of productive shallow water habitat available to fish.  Muskgrass was the most abundant submerged vegetation which is indicative of a marl, hard-water lake.     The city owns a swimming beach on the north side of the lake and also has a park on the east side of the lake.  The fishing pier is well used in the open-water season with small sunfish and northern pike being the most commonly fish caught.  The lake management focus has been on largemouth bass, northern pike, and walleye. <br> \n         While Charlotte Lake has a moderate number of largemouth bass compared to similar type lakes,   anglers have an opportunity to catch trophy size bass as fish over 18 inches were observed.   Northern pike are plentiful and could provide some easy action.  Average length in the survey was 20 inches or about 2 pounds and there were a fair number of fish over 24 inches.  Some large pike have been in nets of previous surveys.  Pike numbers were higher than in the last survey and are above desired abundance.  Anglers should consider keeping northern pike less than 24 inches as a harvestable surplus of small fish exists.  Reducing the population of small pike could be beneficial to the entire fish community.  All of the walleye caught in the summer survey were over 16 inches in length with one up to 30 inches measured.  Locating these fish may be a challenge but an angler has a chance of catching a trophy fish.  The walleye population is maintained by stocking which usually occurs every other year.   <br> \n       Charlotte Lake has a good tullibee population and of a size ideal for the larger northern pike and walleye.   Some of the tullibee were infested with triaenophorus or white grubs which makes them less desirable to fisherman.   The bluegill catch was dominated by small to medium size fish.  While there were some fish over 7 inches caught, the average size was under 6 inches.  Even though the net catches suggest low numbers of black crappies in Charlotte Lake, the species can be difficult to catch with standard lake survey gear so true abundance is unknown.   Anglers do have an opportunity to catch nice fish though as crappie up to 12 inches were caught in the spring electrofishing.  Other panfish species in the lake are pumpkinseed, hybrid sunfish, and rock bass.   As with the bluegills, some pumpkinseeds over 7 inches were measured but the average size was around 5.5 inches. <br> \n      Yellow perch have historically been present in low numbers in Charlotte Lake.  Perch can be an important prey species for many species of fish and help to maintain a balanced bluegill population.  It is unknown if reducing pike numbers can help perch numbers rebound, but, other environmental factors may be involved.    Other species sampled in the survey included black bullhead, bowfin or dogfish, brown bullhead, green sunfish, white sucker, and yellow bullhead.  Yellow bullhead was the most abundant of the three bullhead species.   Dogfish appear to be abundant and can provide quite an angling experience when caught.  Despite the dogfish not being considered a food fish by most people, their usefulness as a predator on small bluegills makes them a good fish to have in a lake.   Anglers are encouraged to practice selective harvest and release the larger fish of each species to maintain a balanced fish community and sustain high quality fishing. <br> \n      Charlotte Lake has high recreational value with its good water clarity, swimming beach, park, and fishing pier.  Protecting and improving the water quality should be a high priority of the City of Long Prairie and lakeshore owners.  Maintaining adequate septic systems, keeping grass clippings and raked leaves out of the lake, and the common sense use of lawn fertilizer will help to reduce nutrients entering the lake thus slowing algae growth.  Buffer strips along inlets and lakeshore property are also encouraged to reduce nutrients entering the lake.  Overall, the lake appears to have fairly responsible lakeshore owners as shoreline impacts by development were lower than most lakes.    <br> \n  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Charlotte Lake is a small, deep lake located on the south side of the town of Long Prairie. It's 148 acres and has a maximum depth of 84 feet. Water clarity is very good throughout the summer and there's a public swimming beach and park on the north and east sides of the lake. A DNR-managed public access with concrete boat ramp and fishing pier is located on the lake's west side.  <br> \n <br> \nMuch of the shallow water-zone around Charlotte is heavily colonized by a short, crusty- stemmed plant called chara (pronounced \u0018care-uh). It's actually a member of the algae family but unlike other algae, it's very beneficial in maintaining lake water quality and clarity. When pulled up on an anchor for example, it has a very musky odor to it. In places, chara extends out from shore in dense mats like a shelf, the outside edge of which drops off sharply to deep water.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike will likely offer the best fishing experiences for anglers at this time. Survey netting sampled pike up to 32 inches in length, with 60% of the catch exceeding 24 inches. Walleyes seem to be less abundant than pike, despite every-other-year stocking since 2001. Reasons for poor success in the establishment of a Walleye fishery are unclear, however, sampling gear can be somewhat inefficient given the lakes steep drop-off nature. Bottom line is that catching a walleye at this time, may be a bit of a challenge. Rainbow Trout were experimentally stocked in 2016 however none were sampled in this survey. Largemouth Bass are present in lower than average numbers as well, but decent-sized fish have been sampled during surveys in the past.  Bluegill fishing can be very good, especially from the fishing pier. Trap net sampling regularly finds individual fish exceeding eight inches in length.  <br> \n  <br> \nLake Charlotte supports Cisco, a species that requires cold, oxygenated water throughout the year in order to survive. Many lakes in central Minnesota support Cisco however, what's remarkable about Charlotte is the quality of Cisco habitat present.  For a small lake, Charlotte may offer some of the highest quality Cisco habitat of any lake in the region - cold, deep water with high oxygen content. The importance of Charlotte's water quality features should be recognized by the local community, farmers, lakeshore property owners and policy decision-makers in order to ensure long-term protections and maintenance of this unique resource. Methods and strategies at achieving good land stewardship and thus protections for Charlotte Lake can be found at MNDNR.gov.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>    Charlotte Lake is a fairly small, deep lake being 148 acres in size with a maximum depth of 84 feet.  The lake is located on the south side of the City of Long Prairie and has a good access with a concrete boat ramp along with a fishing pier.  Water clarity at the end of June was good with a secchi disk reading of 13.4 feet.  The lake has relatively fast drop-offs around the lake which limits the amount of productive shallow water habitat available to fish.  Muskgrass was the most abundant submerged vegetation which is indicative of a marl, hard-water lake.   Submerged vegetation was found to grow down to a depth of 14 feet with other common species being coontail, flat-stem pondweed, illinois pondweed, and northern milfoil.  Cattails are common on the west side of the lake which for the most part has protected the shoreline from development.   The city owns a swimming beach on the north side of the lake and also has a park on the east side of the lake.  The fishing pier is well used in the openwater season with small sunfish and northern pike being the most common fish caught.  The lake management focus has been on largemouth bass, northern pike, and walleye.\n    Charlotte Lake has an abundant northern pike population with the average length in the survey being 19 inches or about 2 pounds.  Pike numbers appear to have increased since the last survey in 2000 and are above desired abundance.  Having high pike numbers can have a negative affect on the fish community in the lake by reducing survival of walleye fingerlings as well as over predation on the prey base such as yellow perch.  Charlotte Lake does have a tullibee population along with a good white sucker population which provide additional prey species for the larger northern pike and walleye.  Some of the tullibee were found to be infected with triaenophorus or white grubs which makes them undesirable to fisherman.\n     All of the walleye caught in the summer survey were over 17 inches in length with one up to 30 inches being measured.  Locating the fish may be a challenge but an angler has a chance of catching a trophy fish.  The population is likely maintained by stocking which usually occurs every other year when the fish are available.   \n     The largemouth bass population appears low in abundance when compared to similar type lakes.   A couple of trophy size bass  over 16 inches were caught in the trapnets but the average that anglers are likely to see would probably be around 12 inches.   The bluegill catch was dominated by small to medium size fish.  While there were some fish over 7 inches caught, the average size was about 5 inches.  Even though the net catches suggest low numbers of black crappies in Charlotte Lake, the species can be difficult to catch with standard lake survey gear so abundance is unknown.   Another panfish species in the lake is pumpkinseeds.   Like with the bluegills, some pumpkinseeds over 7 inches were measured but the average size was around 5 inches.\n      Yellow perch have historically been present in low numbers in Charlotte Lake.  Perch can be an important prey species for many species of fish and help to maintain a balanced bluegill population.  It is unknown if reducing pike numbers can help perch numbers rebound, but suspected, as there may also be other environmental factors involved.  \n      Other species sampled in the survey included black bullhead, bowfin or dogfish, brown bullhead, green sunfish, hybrid sunfish, rock bass, and yellow bullhead.  Yellow bullheads were the most abundant of the three species.  Some quality individuals over 12 inches were found in all of the three species.  Dogfish appear to abundant and can provide quite an angling experience when caught.  Despite the dogfish not being considered a food fish by most people, their usefulness as a predator on small bluegills makes them a good fish to have in a lake.   Anglers are encouraged to practice selective harvest and release the larger fish of each species to maintain a balanced fish community and sustain high quality fishing.\n      Neascus or black spot was common on the northern pike and some walleye.  Neascus is a trematode or parasite that is usually found in the skin of the fish.  The life cycle of the parasite also includes snails and fish-eating birds, such as herons and bitterns.  Skinning the fish removes most of the parasites and cooking will kill the rest.  Humans cannot be infested. \n      Charlotte Lake's recreational value is high with its good water clarity, swimming beach, park, and fishing pier.  Protecting and improving the water quality should be a high priority of the City of Long Prairie and lakeshore owners.  Maintaining adequate septics, keeping grass clippings and raked leaves out of the lake, and the common sense use of lawn fertilizer will help to reduce nutrients entering the lake thus slowing algae growth.  Buffer strips along inlets and lakeshore property are encouraged to reduce nutrients entering the lake.  Overall, the lake appears to have fairly responsible lakeshore owners as shoreline impacts by development were lower than most lakes.

                "narrative": "<p>Charlotte Lake is a fairly small, deep lake being 148 acres in size with a depth of 84 feet, located on the south side of the City of Long Prairie.  Water clarity at the end of June was good with a secchi disk reading of 13 feet.  The lake has relatively fast drop-offs which limit the amount of productive shallow water habitat available to fish.  Muskgrass is the dominant submerged vegetation which is indicative of a marl, hard-water lake.  A city-owned swimming beach and park are located on the north side of the lake.  A fishing pier is located near the public water access on the west side of the lake.  The pier is well used in the openwater fishing season, small sunfish and northern pike being the most common fish caught.  Lake management focus has been on largemouth bass, northern pike, and walleye.     Northern pike abundance appears to have fallen within the range of management goals, however size structure has not improved.  Average size of the fish seen in the assessment was 18 inches with individuals up to 28 inches measured.  Two 32-inch pike were netted in the 2000 spring electrofishing for largemouth bass and pike up to 35 inches have been observed in past surveys indicating the lake has the potenial to produce larger pike due to the presence of tullibee.     While Charlotte Lake appears to have a low largemouth bass population, quality fish are present with individuals up to almost 19 inches being documented.  Average size of the bass observed in the 2000 sampling methods was 9 1/2 inches, however, likely due to dominance of the 1998 and 1997 year classes.     Despite stocking, walleye abundance has decreased  significantly and appears low when compared to similar types of lakes.  Only one 26-inch walleye was sampled during the 2000 summer survey, compared to 10 in the last survey, 1994.  The lake is stocked with walleye fingerlings every three years and natural reproduction has also contributed to the population.  Walleye up to 13 inches in length were observed in the spring electrofishing suggesting some recruitment from stocking.     Bluegills were common with an average size of 5 1/2 inches seen in the summer survey.  Fish over 7 inches in length were measured, but locating them could be a challenge.  The lake also supports a low black crappie population.  Crappies can be difficult to sample effectively with standard lake survey gear and an assessment targetting crappies may provide a more accurate picture of the population.     Yellow perch have historically been present in low numbers.  Perch can be an important prey species for many species of fish and help to maintain a balanced bluegill population.  Another important prey species in Charlotte Lake for the northern pike and walleye are northern cisco or tullibee.  Charlotte has an abundant tullibee with most of the fish between 10 and 14 inches.  Most of the tullibee sampled were infected with triaenophorus or whitefish grub making them undesirable to fishermen.       Other species sampled in the survey included black bullheads, bowfin or dogfish, brown bullheads, green sunfish, hybrid sunfish, pumpkinseeds, rock bass, white suckers, and yellow bullheads.  Yellow bullheads were the most abundant of the bullheads.  Average size for the yellow bullheads was 10 inches with some measuring up almost 13 inches.     Neascus or black spot was common on the northern pike and also found on some of the panfish.  Neascus is a trematode or parasite that is usually found in the skin of the fish.  The life cycle of the parasite also includes snails and fish-eating birds, such as herons and bittern.  Skinning the fish removes most of the parasites and cooking will kill the rest.  Humans cannot be infested.     Charlotte Lake's recreational value is high with it's good water clarity, swimming beach, park, and fishing pier.  Protecting and improving the water quality should be a high priorty of the City of Long Prairie and lakeshore owners.   Maintaining adequate septics, keeping grass clipping and raked leaves out of the lake, and the use of zero phosphorus lawn fertilizer will help reduce nutrients entering the lake thus slowing algae growth.  Lakeshore buffer strips are also recommended to reduce runoff into the lake.  Anglers are also encouraged to practice selective harvest and release the larger fish of each species to maintain a balanced fish community and sustain high quality fishing.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of nearshore fish species in Charlotte Lake was conducted on June 21-22, 2022, by DNR Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program staff. Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake, and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at seven sampling stations, but three stations were sampled from the boat due to site conditions. Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample two stations, a 15-foot seine was used at five stations, and site conditions prevented the use of seines at three stations. Nearshore sampling captured 24 species of fish including six intolerant of disturbance (i.e., Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, Least Darter, and Rock Bass) and three that are tolerant of disturbance (i.e., Green Sunfish, Fathead Minnow, and Black Bullhead). <br> \n <br> \nA summer trap net survey was also conducted by IBI Program staff on June 21-23, 2022. Nine trap nets were set along the shoreline in locations that encompassed multiple habitat types. Trap net sampling captured 12 species of fish, including two that are tolerant of disturbance (i.e., Black Bullhead and Green Sunfish). Bluegill comprised a majority of the catch by number, whereas Bowfin and Bluegill comprised a majority by biomass. <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore and trap net data were combined with gill net data from a 2018 survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based IBI (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment. In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g., Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, and Blacknose Shiner), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g., Black Bullhead and Green Sunfish). The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.  <br> \n  <br> \nAn assessment of lakeshore habitat was also conducted on Charlotte Lake on June 22, 2022, following the Score the Shore survey protocols. The assessment consisted of 36 survey sites evenly spaced 100 meters around the lake. Assessments were made in three habitat zones: Shoreline Zone (the shore-water interface to the top of the natural bank), Shoreland Zone (land-ward from shoreline to development structure or 100 feet), and Aquatic Zone (lake-ward 50 feet of shoreline). The average lakewide habitat score was 67.0 (? 4.8) out of 100 possible, which is moderately low and below the average score of 73. A low score indicates taht sites are typically developed and have a lower than expected amount of natural habitat. Approximately 50% of the sites were developed with a mean score of 44.1 (? 5.5), while undeveloped sites had a mean score of 90.0 (? 1.1). <br> \n <br> \nResults from this survey indicate that the fish community in Charlotte Lake is healthy as indicated by an FIBI score that meets the exceptional use threshold determined for similar lakes. Data from these surveys will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Long Prairie Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency. <br> \n</p>",

LARGEMOUTH BASS numbers and reproduction are average.  BLACK CRAPPIES are at high level compared to previous surveys, size was small however.  YELLOW PERCH levels are low and were only measured in the natural reproduction check.  TULLIBEES are present in several year classes and were the most common stomach contents of the  northern pike in this survey.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Charlotte Lake is a fairly small (148 acres), deep (84 feet), lake withexcellent water clarity.  The lake has a relatively fast dropoff which limits theamount of productive shallow water habitat available to fish.  Proper managementof the lake includes protection of the remaining stands of bulrush, cattail andother valuable aquatic plant species.     High numbers of northern pike are present in Charlotte Lake.  Small pike werequite abundant in the lake survey but two pike over 34 inches long were alsosampled.  Anglers are encouraged to keep small pike (less than 21 inches) toimprove both quality of the pike population and overall fish community balance.     Charlotte Lake's walleye population is about average compared to lakes withsimilar characteristics.  Large-sized walleye (greater than 17 inches) composed 90percent of the lake survey sample and trophy walleyes are reportedly caught eachyear.  Fishing success is somewhat hampered by the lake's high water clarity soanglers might improve their luck by fishing for walleyes at night.  Although thelake is stocked with fingerlings once every three years, natural reproductioncontributes significantly to the walleye population.      High numbers of largemouth bass are present in the lake and bass angling isquite popular.  Bass are the most frequently caught fish during a local fishingtournament held each year on Charlotte Lake.  Twenty-five percent of the springelectrofishing sample were greater than 15 inches in length.     Bluegills are fairly abundant but they tend to be small.  Much of the anglingpressure at the fishing pier adjacent to the public access is directed at sunfish.     Yellow perch have historically been present in low numbers.  During thesurvey, perch ranged in size from 5 to 10 inches.  Another important prey speciespresent in the lake is northern cisco (tullibee).  Tullibee help to maintain goodgrowth of large predators like northern pike and walleye.  Tullibee prefer coolwater which is present in the deeper water areas of the lake during the summer. Also, tullibees provide anglers with an additional fishing opportunity especiallyduring the winter.</p>",
