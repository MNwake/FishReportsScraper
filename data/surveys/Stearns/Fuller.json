                "narrative": "<p>Fuller Lake is located one mile northwest of Clearwater.  It is small, 35 acres, and relatively deep, 28 feet, but subject to winter kill.  Although Fuller Lake has no public access, it is of interest because of its location and status as a natural environment lake.  This was the first survey since the initial lake survey in 1983. <br> \n <br> \nSpecies composition was about the same as in 1983.  The predominant species were northern pike, black bullhead, green, hybrid and pumpkinseed sunfish.  No largemouth bass were sampled by the first electrofishing survey on Fuller Lake, conducted in daylight in mid-May.  No largemouth were captured during the 1983 survey either, which was very unusual for the Montrose Area. <br> \n <br> \nTwo gill nets were set and the catch of northern pike was 10/net.  Only one northern pike was taken in two sets in 1983.  Northern pike ranged from 22 to 28 inches, with an average length of 25 inches.  Average weight was almost four pounds.  Fuller Lake should provide good angling for larger northern pike. <br> \n <br> \nIn the absence of bluegill, hybrid sunfish were the most abundant sunfish representative (35.4/trap).  Average length was only five inches, but six individuals were greater than nine inches; and some weighed close to a pound. <br> \n <br> \nBlack bullheads were more abundant in gill nets than trap nets and less abundant overall than in 1983.  There was little difference in average length between gill nets (6.1 inches) and trap nets (6.3 inches). <br> \n <br> \nThe aquatic plant community was diverse and species such as bushy pondweed, common bladderwort, white water lily, and muskgrass were widespread and abundant.  No curly leaf pondweed was observed during a mid-June surface survey. However, even in early June dissolved oxygen was present only to 10 feet.  Loons had successfully nested by June.</p>",
