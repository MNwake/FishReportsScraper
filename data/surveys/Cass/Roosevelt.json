                "narrative": "<p> <br> \nRoosevelt lake is a 1,585 acre lake located at Outing Minnesota.  Maximum depth is 129 feet and 25 % of the surface area is less than 15 feet deep.  It is a lake with moderate to heavy shoreline development.  Water clarity is good, with a secchi disc reading of 10 feet. <br> \n <br> \nLake trout have been stocked since 1982.  Since 1995 they have been stocked every other year instead of yearly.  A total of 17 lake trout were sampled in 2006 in gill nets, the trout ranged in size from 7.5 to 8.6 inches.  All of these fish were stocked in the spring of 2006.  Stocking success and survival of lake trout has been very poor in the last ten years, recent surveys have found no fish stocked from previous years, also little if any return to the angler has been observed.  Good oxygen levels in the cooler water preferred by lake trout has been limited or completely absent in recent years, thus quality habitat is lacking for lake trout.  The stocking of lake trout is being evaluated and may be halted in future years.  The walleye fishery is doing well with high angler satisfaction and a modest net catch of 2.6/gill net, very similar to the 2000 population assessment.  Black crappie numbers were good, and fish up to 11.0 inches were observed. A spring electro fishing assessment of the bass population indicated a very high population of largemouth bass with sizes ranging from 3.9 to 16.1 inches observed.  The average size was 11.4 inches.  Smallmouth bass were observed in moderate numbers with fish up to 19.6 inches captured.    <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Muskie stocking began in 2011 and is planned to continue in even number years.  Fish are now reaching the high 40 inch range and are a viable fishing option.  In the spring of 2021, a special assessment was done targeting muskies with large frame trap nets.  A total of 11 muskies were caught, with lengths ranging from 34.4\" to 51.0\". <br> \n <br> \nWalleye is another species that is stocked every other year into Roosevelt (odd years).  The 2021 catch was low for this type of lake (1.8/gill net).  Size was good, with an average length of 18.8\" and 96% of the fish measuring 12\" or larger. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike numbers were low at 2.6/gill net.  However, average length was good at 25.1\" and 37% of the fish were above the 22-26\" protected slot.   <br> \n <br> \nTullibees (Cisco) were caught in average numbers (4.2/gill net), however, the average length was only 9.1\".  This important forage fish, along with relatively low Northern Pike abundance, probably helps account for the larger size of these northern pike.  This is also an important forage fish for the new Muskellunge population.  Another important forage fish, Yellow Perch, were caught in low numbers at 1.2/gill net.  These fish don't provide much of a fishery.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappies were caught in their highest numbers to date at 6.1/gill net.  Size was good too, with an average length of 8.9\" and 83% of the fish measuring 8\" or larger. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Roosevelt is a 1,585 acre lake located at Outing, Minnesota.  Maximum depth is 129 feet and about 25% of the surface area is less than 15 feet deep.  It is a hardwater lake with low phosphorus fertility and \"average\" water clarity for the area.  It is one of two lakes in the Brainerd management area managed for lake trout.Lake trout have been stocked regularly since 1982.  Walleye stocking began again in 1990.  Other sport fish sampled in 1995 included northern pike, smallmouth and largemouth bass, bluegills and black crappies.Lake trout aged 2-6 were sampled in '95 and had good growth.  Trout to 28 inches long were caught.  The walleye catch (0.6/gillnet) was low compared to similar type lakes but was similar to the 1990 catch (0.3/gillnet).  Northern pike were taken in low numbers (0.9/gillnet).  The catch was typical for the lake.  The fish were fast growing and average size was 6 lbs..  Smallmouth bass were present in \"average\" numbers, while largemouth bass were caught in \"high\" numbers when compared to similar type lakes.  Smallmouth bass ranged from 11.8-15.7 inches long and largemouth bass from 4.6-18.3 inches.The bluegill catch of 75.1/trapnet was \"high.\"  Bluegills to 8.4 inches long were caught and about 10% of the catch was at least 7.0 inches long.  Bluegill growth was slow.  Black crappies (5.6/trapnet) were caught in \"high\" numbers as well and had good growth.  Pumpkinseeds and rock bass were also caught in \"high\" numbers in 1995.Tullibees were the most abundant forage fish taken in test nets.  They were caught in \"high\" numbers in 1995.  Yellow perch, another important forage fish, was taken in \"low\" numbers in both 1990 and 1995.Other species taken in the 1995 netting included \"low\" numbers of bowfin (dogfish) and brown bullheads and \"average\" numbers of yellow bullheads.In general, results of the 1995 netting were similar to previous nettings.  Abundance of top predators like northern pike and walleye tends to be low but growth is good.  Anglers may have generally poor success but have a good chance of taking a \"large\" fish.  Bass and panfish are present in good numbers and a reasonable percentage are larger fish.Lake trout provide a unique angling opportunity for central Minnesota anglers.  Most angling for lake trout is done during the winter season.  A creel survey done in Jan.-Mar. of 1995 provided a closer look at this fishery.  About 700 lake trout were caught during this two month season.  Of these, about 200 fish were harvested and the rest were released.  Average size of harvested trout was 18 inches and 2.6 lbs., while released trout averaged 10 inches and 0.25 lbs..  An estimated 836 angler trips were made during the season, averaging about 3.8 hours each.  About 26% of angling parties lived within 10 miles of the lake.  Trout angling produced an estimated economic value of 38,500 dollars at Roosevelt Lake during the 1995 winter trout season.</p>",

Roosevelt Lake is 1,492 acres, has 18.1 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 130 feet.  Shoal water soils are 70% sand, 10% rubble, 5% clay, 5% marl, 5% gravel and 5% boulder.  Shoreline development is intensive with the development scattered along the entire shoreline.  No pollution was evident at the time of the survey, but with future shoreline development the possibility of pollution becomes very evitable as more septic tanks are located near the lake.  Secchi reading was 7 feet.  Total alkalinity was 135 ppm.  Several emergent and submerged aquatic plants were found with emergents having a sparse or scattered density rating, and a majority of the submerged aquatic plants had moderate or lush density rating.Test netting indicated a good fish population of northern cisco, yellow perch, bluegill and pumpkinseed.  Northern pike spawning habitat is poor, because marsh areas are absent.  Good walleye spawning areas are present, but a poor walleye population exists.  Fair centrachid spawning areas are present.  Black grub (Clinostomum marginatum) were the only parasites and/or diseases found.  The reason for poor fish population is related to the small littoral area.  The lake bottom drops off rapidly producing this limited littoral area.  The lake bottom drops off rapidly producing this limited littoral area which results in poor food production and in turn a low carrying capacity.  Lakes of this type, like Roosevelt, are poor fish producers, and most of the recreation is in the form of boating, swimming or water skiing.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Roosevelt is a 1, 585 acre lake located at Outing, Minnesota.  Maximum depth is 129 feet and 25% of the surface water is less than 15 feet deep.  It is a lake with moderate to heavy shoreline development and excellent water clarity, having a secchi disc of 16 feet.Lake trout have been stocked since 1982.  Since 1995 they have been stocked every other year instead of yearly.  Only six lake trout were sampled in 2000, and these were stocked that year.  The past few trout stockings have had little success, with almost no return to the angler.  The trout program on Roosevelt will be evaluated on what can be done to improve the trout fishery, if no improvement can be made the trout program should be halted.  The walleye fishery is doing very well with the catch rate of 2.63/gillnet, being the highest catch rate since 1950.  Sizes ranged from 7.9 to 28.7 inches and age class 3 predominate at 14.9 inches at time of netting.  Walleye fishing has been good this past year.  Black crappie were found present in good numbers with most fish under 9.0 inches.  Bluegill were observed in very high numbers with 4.4% seven inches or larger.  Largemouth bass numbers were very good with an excellent size range present.  Tullibee were present in large numbers and various sizes, thereby providing a good forage food base for various predators.</p>",

Three unknown sex juveniles were also captured. <br> \n <br> \nMuskellunge stocking in Roosevelt Lake started in 2011 with primarily adults, while subsequent stockings have been primarily fingerlings.  All muskellunge stocked have been marked with internal PIT tags allowing individual fish identification.  Ten of the 21 muskellunge captured in this survey were from initial adult stockings made in 2011.   <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Anglers now have a new destination when fishing for muskellunge.  Muskie stocking began in 2011 and will continue in even number years.  Fish are now reaching the low 40 inch range and are a viable fishing option.  In the spring of 2018, a special assessment was done targeting muskies with large frame trap nets.  A total of 11 muskies were caught, with lengths ranging from 31\" to 44\". <br> \n <br> \nWalleye is another species that is stocked every other year into Roosevelt (odd years).  The 2018 catch was low for this type of lake (0.9/gill net).  The average length was 18.1\" and 93% of the walleye were 12\" or larger. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike numbers were low (2.8/gill net), however, average length was good at 25.8\" and 67% of the fish were 24\" or larger.  Lakes in this part of the state have a new northern pike regulation enacted in 2018: possession limit of 10 with not more than 2 over 26\".  All from 22\"-26\" must be immediately released.  Please refer to the current Minnesota Fishing Regulations for additional information. <br> \n <br> \nTullibees (cisco) were caught in above average numbers (5.4/gill net), however, the average length was only 9.6\".  This important forage fish, along with relatively low northern pike abundance probably helps account for the larger size of these northern pike.  Another important forage fish, yellow perch, had their lowest numbers to date (0.3/gill net).  These fish don't provide much of a fishery.   <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass were sampled by night electrofishing at a rate of 50.6/hr, with an average length of 12.6\".  Smallmouth bass were caught at the rate of 5.4/hr, with an average length of 15.9\". <br> \n <br> \nFor anglers looking for panfish, black crappies are probably the better option over bluegill.  Bluegill numbers were average (16.4/trap net), but size was small with an average length of 5.6\" and only 10% measuring 7\" or larger.  Black crappies were caught in above average numbers in both gill nets (2.0/net) and trap nets (4.7/net) and 52% of the fish were 8\" or larger.  Fish ranged from 3.9\" to 11.3\". <br> \n</p>",

Two muskies were already caught in the 2012 assessment and anecdotal reports suggest the initial stocking was successful.  Walleye fingerlings (approximately 4\"-7\") are also stocked every other year into Roosevelt (odd years).  The 2012 catch was low for this type of lake (1.4/gill net).  All of the fish were over 14\" with an average length of 21.5\". <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike numbers were average (3.0/gill net) and average size was good at 24.5\".  Even though tullibees (cisco) were caught in their lowest numbers to date (3.9/gill net), this is still average for this type of lake.  This important forage fish, along with moderate numbers of northern pike, probably helps account for the larger size of these northern.  Yellow perch are another important forage fish, and were found in the lowest numbers to date (0.8/gill net).  These fish don't provide much of a fishery.   <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass numbers were average, with 46% of the fish measuring 12\" or larger.  The lake also contains a small population of smallmouth bass.  Black crappies were caught in high numbers for this type of lake (2.5/trap net), but they had an average size of only 7\", with 40% measuring over 8\".  Bluegill numbers were average (18.9/trap net), but size was also small with only 4% of the fish measuring 7\" or larger. <br> \n</p>",

A survey targeting muskellunge with large-framed trap nets was conducted on Roosevelt Lake in May 2018.  Six nets were set in the southern basin of Roosevelt Lake.  Eleven muskellunge were caught that ranged in length from 31.0 to 44.0 inches in length.  Nine of the muskellunge were ripe males, one was a green female, and one was the ripe female, which was the largest fish captured.  Electrofishing targeting bass in late May 2018 also caught two muskellunge, both males, one of which had been previously captured in the trap net survey.   <br> \n <br> \nMuskellunge stocking in 2011 was primarily adults while subsequent stockings have been primarily fingerlings.  All muskellunge stocked have been marked with internal PIT tags allowing individual fish identification.  Nine of the 12 muskellunge captured in this survey (includes 1 new fish sampled via electrofishing) were from adult stockings made in 2011 or 2012.  Two were from fingerling stocking in 2012, about the youngest muskellunge expected to be captured in this survey targeting mature fish.  Muskellunge stocked as adults and captured in this survey ranged from 16.9 to 26.9 inches at stocking and increased in length by 10.1 to 25.8 inches.  The fingerling stocked fish were 10.0 and 10.6 inches at stocking and increased 25.5 and 25.6 inches in length.  <br> \n</p>",

Roosevelt Lake is located in the Pine River watershed.  A nearshore survey was conducted to assess the populations of both game and non-game fish species.  Eighteen 100' long sampling stations were evenly spaced around the lakeshore.  Each station was then sampled by backpack electrofishing, and if conditions allowed with a 15' or 50' 1/8th inch seine. <br> \n <br> \nThe survey took place from August 13-15, 2018, with all 18 stations sampled by backpack electrofishing.  The 50' 1/8th inch seine was used at four stations and the 15' 1/8th inch seine was used at an additional nine stations.  Obstacles such as steep breaks, soft bottom, and heavy vegetation prevented the use of seines at the other five sampling sites.  Twenty five species were sampled, including eight species that are intolerant of habitat disturbance:  Iowa darter, logperch, mimic shiner, blackchin shiner, blacknose shiner, rock bass, smallmouth bass, and banded killifish.  This nearshore survey will be used along with the gill net and trap net survey conducted on July 9-13, 2018 to calculate a Fish-Based Index of Biotic Integrity (FIBI) score.  The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health by the types of fish species present and comparing it to what is expected for this type of lake. <br> \n</p>",

Present fish populations typical of many marl lakes.  Walleye populations have been extremely low over the past 20 years with fry stocking not succeeding.  Apparently fingerling stocking in 1948 produced a good walleye population in the 1950's.Additional Field Notes: Observed 3 adult osprey, one adult bald eagle.  Rainfall was of approximately 8 inches during the time of survey causing water levels to raise about 10 inches.Present Fish Population Status: Northern cisco are very abundant and present in numerous size groups.  Northern pike abundance (0.47 per gillnet) is extremely low but abundance is about the same as in all previous surveys.  Majority of northern pike are of nice size and have good growth rates.  Bluegill abundance is high, growth rate slow, and size is small.  Largemouth bass are very abundant with numerous year classes present and growth rate good. The black crappie population is very good with year classes II-V making up most of the fish population.  Yellow perch as forage food are very abundant.  Walleye abundance is very low and all fish that were checked were at least nine years old and of large size.</p>",

The north basin comprises 19% of the entire basin.Additional Field Notes: Most of the locals refer to Roosevelt as the \"Dead Sea\".  Trophy sized northern pike and walleyes are occasionally taken by persistent anglers.  Walleye fry and nothern pike fingerling stocking have not shown noticeable changes in the fish population, however, large numbers of walleye fingerlings stocked in 1948 were well represented in the 1950 survey.  Almost all the walleye stocking consisted of fry stocking.  Lake trout have been stocked annually since 1982 with a modest return to anglers.Present Fish Population Status:  Northern pike, yellow perch and walleye net catches were below average.  Black crappie numbers appear to be high.  Northern pike growth rates were above average.  The yellow perch gillnet catch rate suggests a significant decrease in yellow perch abundance.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Temperature-dissolved oxygen profiles were collected in the deepest basins on Roosevelt Lake on August 14th, 2023, to evaluate the amount of cold, oxygenated water (i.e., oxythermal habitat) available to Cisco, also known as Tullibee. Two profiles were collected due to the size and complexity of the lake (i.e., Water Quality Station 1 and 2).  Based on the average of the two profiles, the top of the thermocline (i.e., the location in the water column with the sharpest transition from warm to cold water) occurred at approximately 16 feet. Dissolved oxygen decreased to below 3.0 mg/L at 68.9 feet in Water Quality Station 1 (WQ 1), and 24.6 feet in WQ 2, both of which were below the thermocline at the time of sampling. The temperature at which dissolved oxygen decreased to below 3.0 mg/L in WQ 1 (i.e., TDO3, a single variable to characterize oxythermal habitat) was 5.8?C (42.4?F). <br> \n <br> \nTDO3 values cooler than 21.5?C indicate that oxythermal conditions are favorable for Cisco. Dissolved oxygen concentrations below the thermocline indicate that suitable oxythermal habitat for Cisco was available across a wide range of depths at the time of sampling during the summer of 2023. Data collected in 1988, 1999, and 2001 further indicate suitable oxythermal habitat across years, with the least favorable conditions recorded in 1999. When inadequate oxythermal habitat is available, Cisco are squeezed into unfavorable, warmer water conditions and therefore experience higher levels of stress.</p>",
