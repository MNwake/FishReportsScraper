                "narrative": "<p>Lower Prior is a 956-acre lake located in the city of Prior Lake, Scott County.  Maximum depth is 60 feet and littoral area (<15 ft) covers 39% of the lake.  Lower Prior is connected via a navigable channel to Upper Prior Lake, which is south/upstream of Lower Prior; \"Prior Lake\" is a reference to either or both basins.  Prior is a highly developed lake and is primarily managed for walleye and largemouth bass.  In 2009, zebra mussels were confirmed in Prior Lake.  A standard population assessment was conducted during July 2012 to characterize the fish community in the lake.  Population assessments have been completed every other year since 1996.   <br> \n <br> \nIn 2012, walleye abundance (4.5/ gill net) was higher than the previous assessment in 2010 (3.1/gill net) and was the highest observed since 1996 (8.0/net).  Catch has remained relatively stable over the last 15 years averaging 4.1/net between 1996 and 2010.  Size structure was balanced with 59% measuring 15 inches or longer and 8% at 20 inches or longer.  Mean length and weight were 15.6 inches and 1.23 lbs, with the largest measuring 25.1 inches and 4.69 lbs.  The 2012 sample was dominated (75%) by the strong 2009 (age 3) year class.  Nineteen percent were age 5 and one age-1 and one age-11 walleye were sampled.  All walleye ages corresponded to stocked years, indicating a low probability of natural reproduction.  Growth was faster than the statewide average.  Walleye reached 14.9 inches at age 3 and 18.2 inches at age-5.  Walleye continue to be stocked in odd-numbered years.  <br> \n <br> \nLower Prior Lake has a low-density northern pike population with a relatively large size structure.  Pike abundance (2.9/gill net) was below the 25th percentile compared to other similar lakes.  Historically (1996-2010), abundance has ranged from 1.1 - 7.6/gill net, averaging 4.2/net.  Size structure was skewed toward larger individuals where 90% were 21 inches or longer and 29% were 28 inches or longer.  Mean length and weight were 25.2 inches and 3.61 lbs, with the largest measuring 31.3 inches and 6.13 lbs.  Ages ranged from 2 to 7.  Eighty-three percent were between ages 3 through 5.  Growth was faster than the statewide average.  Northern pike were 21.3 inches by age 3 and 27.0 inches by age 5.       <br> \n <br> \nBluegill are moderately low in abundance (13.1/trap net) when compared to other similar lakes.  The 2012 catch was lower than the previous assessment in 2010 (22.5/net) and below the long-term (1996-2010) average of 43.5/net.  Size structure was balanced with 56% measuring 6 inches or longer and 3% at 8 inches or longer.  Mean length and weight were 6.0 inches and 0.18 lbs, with the largest measuring 8.9 inches and 0.56 lbs.  Ages ranged from 1 to 8.  Eighty-six percent of all bluegill sampled were relatively evenly distributed between ages 2 through 5.  Growth was near the statewide average.  Bluegill grew to 5.3 inches by age 3 and to 7.9 inches by age 6.      <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie were not sampled in abundance.  They were caught at rates of 0.83/ trap net and 0.75/ gill net, both near the 25th percentiles when compared to other similar lakes.  Catch rates have been typically low for black crappie in Lower Prior Lake.  From 1996-2010, trap nets have averaged 4.2/net and gill nets averaged 2.1/net.  Nine of the 12 black crappie sampled were 8 inches or longer and one was over 10 inches.  Seventy-one percent of the black crappie sampled were from the 2009 year class.  Ages 2 and 4 were also present.  Age-3 (2009 year class) fish averaged 8.1 inches.     <br> \n <br> \nWhite bass have been sampled in 5 of the previous 8 assessments (1996-2012) and in each of the last 3.  In 2012, white bass abundance was the highest on record and considered high (2.6/ gill net) compared to other similar lakes.  Mean length and weight were 15.8 inches and 1.66 lbs.  The largest measured 16.7 inches and 1.92 lbs. <br> \n <br> \nPassive sampling gear, such as trap and gill nets, are not effective methods for collecting largemouth bass, so the data presented is not necessarily representative of the entire population.  Electrofishing is the typical method for largemouth bass assessments but was not conducted.  In 2012, 8 largemouth bass were sampled in nets.  Average length and weight of bass in both gears was 9.7 inches and 0.63 lbs. The longest measured 14.2 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch were sampled in low abundance. The catch rate of 0.6/gill net was below the 25th percentile compared to other similar lakes.  The five yellow perch netted ranged from 6.8 to 8.9 inches. Historically, yellow perch have been low in abundance in Lower Prior Lake.  From 1996-2010, gill net catch ranged from 1.1 to 8.7/net, averaging 3.7/net.   <br> \n <br> \nYellow bullhead were abundant in the gill nets.  At 9.0/net, catch was near the 75th percentile compared to other similar lakes.  Yellow bullhead ranged from 10.2 to 14.9 inches, averaging 11.9 inches.  Other species sampled in low abundance were black bullhead, brown bullhead, green sunfish, hybrid sunfish, pumpkinseed, and white sucker.   <br> \n <br> \nAn assessment of fish in the shallow, nearshore habitats was also conducted in 2012.   Using backpack electrofishing and seining, 8 species were sampled including Johnny darter, bluegill, bluntnose minnow, golden shiner, green sunfish, hybrid sunfish, largemouth bass, and pumpkinseed.  The purpose of the nearshore sampling is to calculate an Index of Biotic Integrity score.  An Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) is estimated based on all fish sampled in this assessment (including gill nets and trap nets).  The absence of sensitive species such as minnows and darters contribute to a low IBI score.  Upper Prior Lake scored 51.7 out of a maximum of 160, indicating possible water quality and habitat impairment is occurring. <br> \n <br> \nLower Prior is a fertile lake in a developed watershed that gets heavy recreational use.  Accordingly, water quality and fish community characteristics are sub-optimal.  In 2009, the invasive aquatic species zebra mussel was confirmed in both basins of Prior Lake.  In late May 2012, some dead fish (mostly crappie) were reported. This small-scale die-off was likely a result of fish-specific bacterial mortality; these conditions can periodically occur in fertile waters during the first large water-temperature increase in late spring-early summer. <br> \n</p>",

A total of 2.9 walleyes were sampled in each gillnet in 1998 compared to 8.0 per net in 1996. The average size sampled was 19 inches in length and 2.3 pounds. Over 30% of the walleyes caught were over 20 inches long.        The northern pike population continues to expand due in part to higher lake levels and past stocking of winter rescue northern pike. The average size sampled was 25.2 inches and 3.3 pounds. Over 50% of the northern pike sampled exceeded 25 inches in length.        Bluegills were sampled in above average numbers, but the size continues to run small. The average length of trapnet caught bluegills was only 5.6 inches. Slightly over 4% of the bluegills sampled exceeded 7 inches. Black crappies were also sampled in above average numbers. They averaged 7.1 inches in length in the gillnets and 7.6 inches in length in the trapnets. No black crappies sampled exceeded 10 inches in length.        Largemouth bass were sampled at a rate of 69 fish per hour of electrofishing, with a total of 47 bass caught. The average size was only 8.6 inches in length.            </p>",

The 2008 catch of 3.25/gillnet was slightly above the median value for similar lakes.  Mean length (17.3 inches) and weight (2.18 pounds) were between values found in 2002 and 2004 surveys.  Twenty four percent of sampled walleye were larger than 20 inches.  The largest fish sampled was a 26.9-inch, 6.5 pound, 9-year old female.  Five year-classes were sampled, coinciding with the fingerling stocking that occurs in odd years.  As in previous surveys, no evidence of natural reproduction was found during the 2008 survey.  The 2003-year class was historically underrepresented in the 2008 gillnet catch indicating this year-class is weak.  Growth was near state averages.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike were sampled at the lowest level since 1996.  On average, northern pike have been sampled at 4.76/gillnet.  The 2008 catch of 1.13/gillnet was below the lower quartile for similar lakes.  Mean length and weight decreased to 26.9 inches and 4.3 pounds in 2008 from 28.2 inches and 5.6 pounds in 2004.  Mean weight remained more than double the 75th percentile level.  The largest individual sampled was 32.8 inches and 8.0 pounds.  Five year-classes were sampled indicating consistent northern pike recruitment despite the low population abundance.  Growth rates are well above average for northern pike in this lake type. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill abundances were near historical averages for Lower Prior Lake.  The 2008 trapnet catch of 36.09/net is between the median and 75th percentile levels for this lake type.  Mean length and weight were 5.89 inches and 0.26 pounds.  The 2008 mean length decreased from 2004 when bluegills averaged 6.3 inches.  Thirty-two percent of sampled bluegills were larger than 7 inches, however only 0.9% were larger than 8 inches.  The largest individual captured was 8.3 inches and 0.37 pounds.  Seven year-classes were represented in the bluegill catch indicating consistent recruitment.  Growth rates are below average for this lake type as they have historically been. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie were sampled in 2008 at the highest abundance in the past 12 years.  The gillnet catch of 3.63/gillnet and trapnet catch of 10.18/gillnet were above the 75th percentile for similar lakes.  The mean length and weight of sampled black crappie from both gears were 7.8 inches and 0.24 pounds.  Thirty-two percent of sampled black crappie were larger than 8 inches; however, no fish larger than 9 inches were sampled.  Only two year-classes of black crappie were sampled (2004 and 2005).  Growth was slightly above average. <br> \n <br> \nThe yellow perch catch of 2.63/gillnet was below the historical lake average of 3.98/gillnet and near the 25th percentile for similar lakes.  Mean length and weight were 7.0 inches and 0.14 pounds.  Five year-classes were sampled, and growth rates were below average for similar lakes. <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

Walleye numbers increased nearly twofold since 2004, due to good recruitment from the 2003 fingerling stocking (61% of all walleye; average length = 15.8-inches).  The 2001 year-class was also well represented making up 24% of the population (average length = 17.9 inches).  The largest walleye measured 21.0 inches, weighed 2.7 pounds, and was seven years old.  Since 1999 odd-year stocking events have occurred:  <br> \n <br> \n1999 - 14,778 fingerlings <br> \n2001 - 32,898 fingerlings <br> \n2003 - 9,117 fingerlings (purchased from private vendor) <br> \n2005 - 20,559 fingerlings (purchased from private vendor) <br> \n <br> \nNatural reproduction appeared to be nonexistent because all year-classes observed could be referenced back to a stocking event.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike catch declined from 6.6 fish/gillnet in 2004 to 1.5 fish/gillnet in 2006.  Average length and weight also decreased slightly from 28.2 inches and 5.6 pounds in 2004 to 27.3 inches and 5.0 pounds in 2006.  Twenty-six percent of the northern pike were over thirty inches; none measured below twenty inches.  The largest northern was 34.8 inches, weighed 11.0 pounds, and was 10 years old.  <br> \n <br> \nBluegill abundance and size structure were similar to values from 2004 (10-15 fish/GN, 51-52% of fish at least 7 inches long).  <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch number dropped from 8.7 fish/gillnet in 2004 to 1.9 fish/gillnet in 2006.  Average length and weight of yellow perch remained about the same at 7.3 inches and 0.16 pounds.  <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nOther species collected included: black crappie, black bullhead, green sunfish, hybrid sunfish, pumpkinseed, white bass, white sucker, and yellow bullhead.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lower Prior Lake currently has the highest walleye and northern pike populations ever measured in the lake. The walleye population is most likely a result of stocking. The average size of walleye sampled in the 1996 survey was 17.7 inches and 2.0 pounds. Individuals up to 27.6 inches in length were captured. Over 20% of the walleyes measured were over 20 inches.The northern pike population has increased after many years of low abundance. Higher lake levels have allowed northern pike to reach spawning areas not available during the late 1980's. Stocking of winter rescue northern pike has also helped the population recover quicker. The average size sampled was 21.9 inches and 2.2 pounds. Bluegills were present within normal ranges but, were rather small in size. The average length sampled in the trapnets was only 5.4 inches. Of the bluegills measured 25.4% were 7 inches or larger. Black crappies were very abundant for this type of lake. Only 1.6% of the black crappies were 10 inches or larger.A small number of largemouth bass were sampled due to the inability of the sampling gear to capture this species effectively. The number sampled was within the normal range. White bass were sampled for the first time in this lake. It is not known how this species made its way into the lake.Black bullheads and yellow bullheads were each sampled during the survey. The average size of each species was approximately 12 inches. Carp were sampled in relatively low abundance, but were rather large measuring 25.8 inches and weighing 8.2 pounds.Pumpkinseed sunfish, hybrid sunfish, and yellow perch were all sampled in low abundance. Only one yellow perch exceeded 9 inches in length. None of the other species exceeded 6 inches in length on the average.White suckers were caught within the normal range for this type of lake. This species provides excellent forage for top predators like walleye and northern pike.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lower Prior Lake is a 956 acre lake with a maximum depth of 60 feet, located in Scott County.  Lower Prior provides ample recreational opportunities.  Fishing and boating are very popular.  Beaches provide swimming opportunities.  Lower Prior receives heavy recreational use.  This has led to the introduction and establishment of an exotic species: zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha).  During the 2010 Population Assessment zebra mussels were observed twice.  Both times they were attached to a native mussel.  One of the native mussels had already perished.  Watercraft exiting Lower Prior Lake are required to drain all water from bilges, bait buckets and live wells.  Drain plugs should be pulled and trailers should be thoroughly inspected and cleaned.  Boaters should also keep in mind, new laws require the drain plug be removed while on public roadways.   <br> \n <br> \nWater quality in Lower Prior is fair, compared to other West Metro lakes.  By late summer most species of fish cannot inhabit water deeper than 18 feet for extended periods of time.  Anglers should keep this in mind when pursuing walleye and crappie.  Fishing in water deeper than 18 feet in mid to late summer could yield very few fish. <br> \n <br> \nThe predator community in Lower Prior is expanding.  Walleye average length was 15.0 inches.  Average weight was 1.35 pounds.  Both abundance and weight was average for this type of lake.  Walleye abundance is low compared to the historic average catch within Lower Prior.  Stocking of walleye fingerlings occurs in odd numbered years.  Survival of the 2007 year class appears high.  These fish averaged 15.3 inches long and accounted for more than half of sampled walleye.  Age 1 walleye comprised the second highest proportion of sampled fish.  Walleye opportunities could be expanding in the near future.  Northern pike numbers were low compared to the historic average and below average compared to similar lakes.  Average weight was well above average.  Average length was 24 inches.  Largemouth bass abundance increased compared to past surveys, but is below average for lakes similar to Lower Prior.  Standard lake survey gear does not consistently provide an accurate estimate of largemouth bass abundance.  On average largemouth bass length was 10.5 inches.  White bass continue to be sampled.  This species is typically confined to rivers and reservoirs.  The 2010 survey produced the highest catch ever recorded for Lower Prior.    <br> \n <br> \nFive species of panfish are present in Lower Prior Lake.  Black crappie abundance is low for this type lake and compared to historic catches within Lower Prior.  Fish averaged 8.1 inches in length.  Bluegill abundance decreased and is also low compared to past surveys.  The size of bluegill sampled was excellent for a West Metro lake.  Two-thirds of sampled fish were 6 inches or longer.  Nearly 40% were 7 inches long.  Yellow perch abundance in Lower Prior is low, but sampled fish were large.  Mean weight of yellow perch was high.  Average length was 7.9 inches, very good for a metro area lake.  Yellow perch up to 9.6 inches were sampled.  Pumpkinseed were sampled at an average abundance.  Hybrid sunfish were also sampled.   <br> \n <br> \nSome rough fish species are present in high numbers.   No common carp were sampled.   Yellow bullhead abundance reached an all time high.  White sucker were also numerous and sampled individuals were large.   <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Walleye are the primary management species in Lower Prior Lake.  Walleye may be slightly less abundant, smaller and younger than they were in the 2002 survey.  The catch of 3.4 per gillnet is between median and 75th percentile levels for lakes of this ecological class.  Mean length and weight is down to 16.8 inches and 2.1 pounds in 2004 from 18.6 inches and 2.4 pounds in 2002.  Twenty nine percent of walleye sampled were larger than 20 inches.  The largest individual was 27.4 inches, 8.5 pounds and 11 years old.  The mean age decreased slightly from 4.2 years in 2002 to 4.1 years in 2004.  Growth rates are above average.  The population is strongly represented by the 2001 and 1999 year-classes of walleye that were stocked as fingerlings.  Fifty-four percent of all walleye sampled were from the 2001 year-class (age 3).  No walleyes from non-stocked years were sampled, confirming that natural year-classes have not been successful.  Northern Pike are Lower Prior Lake's most abundant predator species sampled in survey nets.  Pike are more abundant, larger, and younger than they were in the 2002 survey.  The catch of 6.6 per gillnet is just between median and 75th percentile levels.  Mean length and weight increased to 28.2 inches and 5.6 pounds in 2004 from 27.3 inches and 5.1 pounds in 2002.  Mean weight is over two times the 75th percentile level.  Of the pike sampled, 52% were larger than 28 inches.  The largest individual was 38.0 inches and 12.9 pounds.  The mean age decreased from 6.3 years in 2002 to 5.7 years in 2004.  Growth rates are well above average for pike in this lake type.Bluegill abundances decreased from the 2002 survey at which time they were at historical highs.  Trapnet abundance was 30.7 per net, which is between median and 75th percentile levels.  Mean length and weight is 6.3 inches and 0.18 pounds.  Thirty-four percent of sampled bluegills were larger than 7 inches but only 6% were larger than 7.5 inches.  The largest bluegill captured was 8.2 inches.  Eight year-classes from 1995 to 2002 were represented in the catch.  Growth rates are slightly below average for this lake type as they were in the last 2 surveys.Black crappie abundance has decreased from 2000.  The trapnet catch of 2.1 per net in 2004 is down from 5.8 per net in 2002 and is between median and 75th percentile levels.  The 2004 trapnet sample mean length and weight was 8.2 inches and 0.30 pounds while 79% of the sample was larger than 8 inches.  The largest individual sampled was 9.3 inches and 0.45 pounds.  Growth rates are slightly above average.Largemouth bass are not well sampled in survey; however, Prior is one of the best bass fisheries in the metro area.  Bass fishing tournaments occur annually on the lake, and anglers have needed fish averaging over 4 pounds a piece in 2003 and 2004 to win.Yellow perch abundances have risen from 2002.  The gillnet catch of 8.7 per net is near the median level.  Mean length and weight is 7.5 inches and 0.18 pounds.  Growth rates are slightly below average.  All perch aged were from the 2001 and 2000 year-classes.  Comparatively, the 2002 survey sampled perch from 6 year-classes.Yellow bullhead were caught at a rate of 6.1 per gillnet, which is between median and 75th percentile levels.  They averaged 0.93 lbs.  Black bullhead, hybrid sunfish, green sunfish, pumpkinseed sunfish, white sucker, bowfin, carp, snapping turtles and soft-shelled turtles are also present in Lower Prior Lake.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lower Prior is a 956-acre lake with a maximum depth of 60 feet. Lower Prior Lake is located west of the City of Prior Lake, in northern Scott County. It is connected via a navigable channel to Upper Prior Lake. Public access is provided by a DNR-owned boat ramp located on the north side of the lake. The lake is subject to periodic, small-scale fish die-offs associated with stressful temperature and/or oxygen levels. Crappie and sunfish are the species most often affected, and fish population levels and fish-consumption safety are not comparably worse than other regional lakes. Eurasian Watermilfoil and Zebra Mussels has been found in Lower Prior Lake and remain present. <br> \n <br> \nLower Prior is primarily managed for Walleye, but includes catchable populations of Largemouth Bass, Northern Pike, Black Crappie, and Bluegill. White Bass are also present in low numbers for anglers seeking that species. Management includes scheduled Walleye fingerling stocking in odd-numbered years; other sizes/ages are substituted if insufficient fingerlings are available. A Standard Survey (trap nets and gill nets) was conducted on Lower Prior Lake during the week of 7/19/2018. During the survey, water clarity was above average with 14 feet of visibility, with low oxygen below 34 feet.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye numbers in Lower Prior were low, with 1.4/net. One factor related to low Walleye numbers was the limited availability of fish for stocking in 2015 and 2017, when fewer than 1,000 walleyes were stocked; the range from 1999-2013 was 4,900-32,900 fish. Average length of Walleye sampled in 2018 was 20.1 inches with the largest measured at 26.4 inches. Despite low numbers, anglers will find Walleye sizes very favorable. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike were sampled at moderate numbers (3.5/net), compared to similar lakes in the area. Average size of Northern Pike was 21 inches, with the largest measured at 28.4 inches. While the majority of pike in Lower Prior are small, the new Northern Pike regulation (effective 2018) allows harvest of 2 fish greater than 24 inches. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie were sampled with gill nets (8.0/net) and trap nets (0.9/net) near their historical ranges. There were 75 Black Crappie sampled, with an average length of 8.2 inches, and the largest measured at 11.4 inches. Over 60% of Black Crappie sampled were greater than 8 inches. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill were sampled with trap nets (22.6/net) within their historical range. There were 270 Bluegill sampled, with an average length of 5.0 inches, and a maximum length of 8.9 inches. The Bluegill population in Lower Prior is mainly composed of small individuals, but anglers still have the opportunity to catch fish greater than 8+ inches. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass are present in Lower Prior Lake, although targeted boat-electrofishing did not occur during the 2018 survey. Incidental capture with trap and gill nets caught 21 Largemouth Bass, with an average length of 10.2 inches and the largest measured at 14.1 inches. <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species sampled in low abundances were Brown Bullhead, Common Carp, Green Sunfish, Pumpkinseed, White Bass, White Sucker, Yellow Bullhead, and Yellow Perch. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Walleye are the primary management species in Lower Prior Lake. The population has slightly risen since the 1998 survey and is currently at the second highest level for this lake. In 1999 the fingerling stocking rate for walleye doubled in the lake from 1 pound per littoral acre to 2 pounds per littoral acre. This was done to meet new walleye management goals in the West Metro area. Nearly 17% of the walleyes sampled exceeded 20 inches in length.  Currently the average size of walleye in Lower Prior Lake is 18 inches long and 2.3 pounds.        Bluegill, while abundant in Lower Prior, are relatively small. The average size is only 5.6 inches long and 0.14 pounds. Only 13.5% were larger than 7 inches. Black crappies were also abundant, but small. There were no black crappies over 10 inches sampled. Their average size was 7.42 inches and 0.22 pounds.        The northern pike population decreased since the 1998 survey. The pike sampled were larger than average. Over 62% exceeded 25 inches in length. The average size was 25.96 inches and 4.36 pounds. Northern pike up to 32.3 inches were sampled.           Largemouth bass were sampled in low numbers due to the types of gear used. Trap nets and gill nets are not effective at capturing bass. Electrofishing was not conducted during this survey. Three bullhead species were present in the lake but in low numbers.  Carp were also sampled in low numbers. Green, hybrid, and pumpkinseed sunfish were found in average abundance.</p>",

BLG CALCULATED PSD FOR TRAP NETS IS 43.0%; FOR COMBINED GEAR 42.1%.  WAE WERE SAMPLED IN LOWER PRIOR AT LEVELS APPROACHING FIVE TIMES THE LOCAL MEDIAN FOR GILL AND TRAP NETS.  GROWTH OF WAE APPEARS TO BE HIGHER THAN AVERAGE WITH AGE I+-VI+ BEING REPRESENTED IN THE CURRENT POPULATION.  AGE II+ AND V+ ARE THE PREDOMINANT AGE-CLASSES PRESENT.  COMBINED SAMPLING GEAR ANALYSIS RESULTS IN A CALCULATED RSD OF 39.4% BLB WERE SAMPLED BELOW LOCAL MEDIAN LEVELS FOR TRAP NETS, BUT THREE TIMES THE LOCAL MEDIAN FOR GILL NETS.  THE MOST COMMON SIZE SAMPLED WAS 9.0-9.4 INCHES TOTAL LENGTH, WITH AN AVERAGE RATE OF 1.7 FISH PER POUND.  PMK WERE ALSO SAMPLED ABOVE THE STATE AND LOCAL MEDIANS FOR GILL AND TRAP NETS.  AVERAGE SIZE WAS SMALL, WITH MOST FISH MEASURING 5.0-5.9 INCHES TOTAL LENGTH.  YEP, YEB, HSF, AND LMB WERE SAMPLED NEAR THEIR MEDIAN LEVELS FOR GILL AND TRAP NETS.  CAP AND BLC WERE SAMPLED BELOW THEIR MEDIAN LEVELS.  BLC WERE SMALL, WITH A RATE OF 4.6 FISH PER POUND AND THE MAJORITY OF FISH MEASURING 7.5- 8.4 INCHES TOTAL LENGTH.  ONLY FOUR WHCS WERE SAMPLED.  ONE YOY SMB WAS CAPTURED DURING SEINING; THIS IS THE FIRST TIME THE SPECIES HAS BEEN SAMPLED IN SURVEYS OR ASSESSMENTS.  NO NOP WERE SAMPLED DURING THIS SURVEY.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lower Prior is a 956-acre lake with a maximum depth of 60 feet. Lower Prior Lake is located west of the City of Prior Lake. It is connected via a navigable channel to Upper Prior Lake. Public access is provided by a DNR-owned boat ramp located on the north side of the lake. Eurasian watermilfoil and zebra mussels are present in the lake. <br> \n <br> \nLower Prior is managed for Walleye, and also holds healthy populations of Largemouth Bass, Northern Pike, Black Crappie, and Bluegill. White Bass are also present, which is unique to lakes in the area. Management includes Walleye stocking every other year, and a special regulation for sunfish and crappie.  A new possession limit of 5 sunfish and 5 crappies is in place on Lower Prior.  A Standard Survey was conducted in 2021 to assess the fish populations.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye numbers were above average in 2021, and a wide range of sizes of fish were present.  Fish lengths were between 12 and 28 inches, with a 17 inch average.  Half of the fish in the gill net catch were smaller than 15 inches, indicating success of recent stocking.  Walleye do well in Lower Prior, and management will continue to focus on this species.   <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass are present in Lower Prior Lake, but targeted bass electrofishing was not conducted as part of the 2021 survey. The fish were caught in both gill nets and trap nets; however, survey nets don't sample bass well so insight into the population is limited.  Eleven fish were caught in the nets and their lengths were between 5 and 17 inches.  When the lake was last electrofished for bass, in 2015, an abundant population of modestly sized fish were present.  At that time, average fish size was 9.3 inches, and the largest fish measured 16.2 inches.  Eighty-six percent of the fish from the 2015 sample were smaller than 12 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike were sampled in moderate numbers in 2021, and size was good.  Fish lengths were between 19 and 36 inches, and 75% of the catch exceeded 24 inches.  Although not highly abundant, the size of the northerns could offer good harvest opportunities.  Lower Prior is part of the Southern Zone for Northern Pike regulation,  allowing anglers to harvest two northerns over 24 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie were sampled in low numbers in 2021.  Fish lengths were between 4 and 11 inches, with an average size of 8 inches.  A new regulation took effect in 2021 on Lower Prior Lake for panfish.  Only 5 crappies and 5 sunfish may be harvested per angler.  The goal of the regulation is to limit harvest and give the fish a chance to grow larger.  Panfish grow fast in Lower Prior, so if the new regulation is effective at reducing harvest, the average size of Black Crappie should increase with time.   <br> \n <br> \nBluegill were sampled in above average numbers in 2021, though they are not overly abundant.  Lengths were between 3 and 9 inches, with an average of 5 inches.  Although only about 10% of the fish exceeded 7 inches, Bluegill grow fast in Lower Prior.  With the new reduced harvest limit, a greater portion of the population will have a chance to grow large, and average size should increase.  Targeted monitoring of panfish growth will document the effect of the new regulation.   <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species sampled in low abundances were Brown Bullhead, hybrid sunfish, Golden Shiner, Green Sunfish, Pumpkinseed, White Bass, White Sucker, Yellow Bullhead, and Yellow Perch. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Walleye are the primary management species in Lower Prior Lake.  Walleye may be slightly more abundant or equally abundant, larger, and older than they were in the 2000 survey.  The catch of 4 per gillnet is between median and 75th percentile levels for comparable lakes.  The population is strongly represented by the 1997 and 1999 year-classes of walleye that were stocked as fingerlings.  Average length and weight is 18.6 inches and 2.4 pounds.  The average walleye in Lower Prior is heavier than that of 75% of comparable lakes.  Thirty-eight percent of the population is longer than 20 inches.  The largest individual was 25.4 inches and 5.8 pounds.  The average age of the walleye population increased from 3.3 years in 2000 to 4.2 years in 2002.  Growth rates are about average for walleye in this type of lake.Northern Pike are Lower Prior Lake's most abundant predator species sampled in survey nets.  The pike are more abundant, larger, and older than they were in the 2000 survey.  The catch of 5.5 pike per gillnet is higher than that of 50% of comparable lakes.  Nine different year-classes of fish are represented in the sample of the population.  The average length and weight is 27.3 inches and 5.1 pounds.  The average pike weighs more than that of at least 75% of comparable lakes.  Thirty-eight percent of the pike population is longer than 28 inches.  The largest individual was 38.2 inches and 14.1 pounds.  The average age increased from 4.8 years in 2000 to 6.3 years in 2002.  Growth rates are above average for pike in this type of lakes.Yellow perch abundances have fallen since the 2000 survey at which time they were at historical highs.  They are now at levels near the 25th percentile for lakes of this type.  Growth rates are about average.  The perch population along with white sucker, bullheads and other forage species, may have supported the increasing predator populations in the lake but have been somewhat reduced.Bluegill abundances are at historical highs, although they are slightly smaller in size than in the 2000 survey.  Trapnet abundance was 113 per net, which is over 2 times above the 75th percentile level for lakes of this type.  Average length and weight is 5.5 inches and 0.11 pounds.  Only 10% of the bluegill population is longer than 7 inches and only 1% is longer than 7.5 inches.  The largest bluegill captured was 8.4 inches.  Six year-classes from 1995 to 2000 were strongly represented in the catch as opposed to three in the last survey.  Growth rates are slightly below average for this lake type as they were in the last survey.  Bluegill reproduction may not have been successful this year as shoreline seine hauls yielded only 2 young-of-the year bluegill.Black crappie abundance has not changed significantly from 2000.  The trapnet catch of 5.8 per net is higher than that of 75% of comparable lakes.  The average crappie in the 2002 trapnet sample was 7.1 inches and 0.18 pounds.  Sixteen percent of the population is longer than 8 inches.  The largest individual sampled was 11.5 inches and 0.8 pounds.  The population is strongly represented by the 2000 year-class.  Growth rates are average.Largemouth bass are not well sampled in survey nets but 6 were captured in gillnets and trapnets and 2 young-of-the-year in seine hauls.  Electrofishing surveys which target largemouth bass were not conducted this year.  Other sources of data provide information about the bass fishery in Lower Prior.Yellow bullhead were caught at a rate of 3.3 per gillnet, which is slightly above 50th percentile levels for this lake type.  They averaged 1.08 pounds.  Black bullhead, hybrid sunfish, green sunfish, and pumpkinseed sunfish were also present in the lake.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lower Prior is a 956-acre, Class 25 lake located in the city of Prior Lake, Scott County.  Maximum depth is 60 feet and littoral area (<15 ft) covers 39% of the lake.   It is connected to Upper Prior, located south and upstream of Lower Prior Lake; these two basins are often referred to in aggregate as Prior Lake.  The Prior Lake basins are in a highly developed watershed.  The lake system  is managed primarily for Walleye and Largemouth Bass.  A Standard Survey was conducted during the summer of 2015 to characterize Lower Prior's fish community.  Surveys have been completed every other year since 1996.   <br> \n <br> \nIn 2015, Walleye abundance was 3.5/ gill net. Catch has remained relatively stable over the last 11 years, averaging 3.6 fish per net between 2004 and 2015.  Mean length and weight were 14.8 inches and 1.25 lbs, with the largest fish measuring 23.0 inches and 3.43 pounds.  The majority of Walleye sampled (56%) likely were from the 2013 fingerling stocking.  Twenty-six percent were age-4 and 11% were age-6.  All Walleye ages corresponded to stocked years, indicating a very low likelihood of natural reproduction.  Growth was faster than the statewide average.  Walleye reached 11.6 inches at age 2 and 17.7 inches at age 4.  Walleye continue to be stocked in odd-numbered years.  <br> \n <br> \nDuring early June, night-time electrofishing revealed an abundant population of moderately sized Largemouth Bass.  In 2 hours and 41 minutes of boat electrofishing, 336 bass were collected.  The average size of bass was 9.3 inches and 0.47 pounds, and the largest fish sampled was 16.2 inches long.  Size structure was skewed to smaller individuals.  The majority of fish (86%) were smaller than 12 inches. <br> \n <br> \nLower Prior Lake has a low-density Northern Pike population.  Pike abundance (3.4/gill net) was between the 25th percentile and median for a Class 25 lake.  From 2004-2015, abundance has ranged from 1.1 - 6.6/gill net, with a mean of 3.3/net.  Mean length and weight were 22.4 inches and 2.73 lbs, with the largest fish measuring 32.5 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nBluegill are moderately low in abundance (15.0/trap net) when compared to other Class 25 lakes.  The 2015 catch was lower than the 2004-2015 catch average of 23.5/net.  Size structure was skewed to smaller individuals.  Mean length and weight of trap netted fish were 4.8 inches and 0.09 lbs, with the largest measuring 8.2 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie were sampled in moderate abundance.  Both the gill net catch rate (2.38/net) and the trap net catch rate (1.92/net) were above the median for Class 25 lakes.  Catch rates have typically been low for Black Crappie in Lower Prior Lake.  Over the period 2004-2015, trap net catches have averaged 3.1/net and gill nets averaged 1.4/net.  Four of the 41 Black Crappie sampled were 8 inches or longer and the largest was 9.3 inches and weighed 0.42 lbs.   <br> \n <br> \nWhite Bass, first caught in 2000, have been sampled in each of the previous three assessments (2008, 2010, 2012).  In 2015, one White Bass was caught in a gill net.  The fish was 16.9 inches and 2.20 pounds. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch were sampled in low abundance. The catch rate of 3.1/gill net was just above the 25th percentile of Class 25 lakes.  The gill-netted fish ranged from 6.3 to 10.0 inches, with the average Yellow Perch measuring 7.7 inches and 0.20 pounds.  Sampling over the last 11 years reflects low Yellow Perch abundances.  From 2004-2015, gill net catches ranged from 0.63 - 8.7/net, averaging 3.4 fish per net.   <br> \n  <br> \nYellow Bullhead were abundant in the gill nets.  At 7.5 fish per net, catch was near the 75th percentile for Class 25 lakes.  Yellow Bullhead ranged from 7.7 to 13.6 inches, averaging 10.8 inches.  Other fishes sampled in low abundance were Brown Bullhead, Common Carp, Green Sunfish, hybrid sunfish, Pumpkinseed, and White Sucker.   <br> \n <br> \nDuring April 6 - April 10, 2015, an ice-out trap net assessment targeting Walleye was conducted on Lower Prior Lake.  When the lake became ice-free, 10 nets were set, focusing effort on the southwest portion of the lake.  One hundred sixty-five Walleye were sampled, and incidental catches of Northern Pike (8 fish) and Largemouth Bass (1 fish) were sampled.  Large Walleye in spawning condition were abundant; the catch rate was 4.1 per trap net.  Ninety-nine percent of the fish exceeded 15 inches and 21% exceeded 20 inches.  The average size of Walleye was 18.3 inches and 2.26 pounds, and the largest fish was 26.6 inches.  Eight Northern Pike were sampled, ranging in size from 18.1 inches to 33.3 inches.  The average size was 26.7 inches and 4.69 pounds.  One Largemouth Bass was sampled; its size was 16.9 inches and 3.14 pounds.   <br> \n</p>",
