High mortality of northern pike may limit the lake's ability to produce large fish, despite the excellent yellow perch forage base present.  Populations of walleye and northern pike were maintained entirely through natural reproduction.  Yellow perch were abundant, and many catchable-sized fish were present.  A few bluegill were found in 1998 (unusual for this lake), and it appeared that bluegill reproduction in 1998 had been good.</p>",

The catch has not varied a great deal from 1985 to 2002.  Walleye were larger than average for this lake and for lakes of this class.  Several year-classes were present.  As for all fish species in the lake, all had resulted from natural reproduction.  Walleye growth had been slightly faster than average for area lakes of the same class.  Walleye reached 16.9 inches at age 5, 18.5 inches at age 6, and 20.9 inches at age 7.The catch and average size of northern were high for this lake historically, but normal for the lake class.  Ages 1-5 were identified.  Growth rates appeared to have been average for ages 2 and 3, and slow for ages 4 and 5.  Yellow perch were abundant and relatively large compared to area lakes of the same class, but this has been usual for this lake.   Yellow perch are important as food for walleye and northern pike.The bluegill catch was low, as in past assessments, near the low end of the normal range for lakes of this class.  Several year-classes were present, and a few bluegill reached fairly large size.The catch of white sucker was normal, for the lake historically and for the lake class.  White sucker size was typical for the lake and larger than average for the lake class.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>This was the second of two assessments scheduled in the 2003 lake management plan for White Pine Lake.  Assessment data were to have been used to determine mortality rates for walleye, northern pike, and yellow perch, and to monitor walleye and yellow perch populations to determine whether long terms goals for those species had been met.  The management plan for White Pine Lake will  be reviewed and revised in February 2014. <br> \n <br> \nThe 2012 walleye gill net catch was the lowest seen to date in this lake, and continued a steady decline in catch that began after 1990.  The catch fell well short of the long range goal for the species in this lake (5.0 fish/gill net set), and was below the normal range for the lake class.  Although the gill net catch was low, fish that were present tended to be large.  The size goal for walleye (some fish over 20 inches present) was met, and the mean weight for walleye taken in gill nets was well above the normal range.  The low walleye catch and the high mean weight were due to a lack of small, young, fish in the catch, indicating poor recruitment in this lake over the last few years.  Although a small year class had apparently been produced in 2010, year classes in 2011, 2009, 2008, and 2007 were weak or missing entirely.  Walleye growth appeared to have been fairly fast.  Walleye reached an average length of 13.8 inches by the end of their third year, compared to an area average of 11.3 inches. <br> \n <br> \nWhite Pine Lake is managed with yellow perch as a secondary species, due to their high numbers and good average size historically.  The yellow perch gill net catch and the mean weight for yellow perch taken in gill nets in 2012 were above normal ranges for the lake class (as has been the case in every assessment of this lake).  Catch and size goals for yellow perch were met in 2012 (catch over 14 fish/gill net set, mean weight over 0.25 lb/fish).   Most of the perch collected were over eight inches in length, and the species was capable of providing some high-quality fishing. <br> \n <br> \nThe 2012 northern pike gill net catch, and the mean weight for northern pike collected in gill nets, were the highest seen to date in this lake, although both remained within normal ranges for the lake class.  Northern pike gill net catch in White Pine Lake has risen as walleye, yellow perch, and white sucker catches have fallen.  Northern pike up to seven years of age were collected, but most were three or less years old.  Growth of young northern pike had been somewhat faster than average, no doubt due to the excellent yellow perch forage base found in this lake.  Northern pike reached an average length of 18.3 inches by the end of their third year, compared to an area mean of 17.2 inches. <br> \n <br> \nMortality rates appear to have been relatively low for walleye and yellow perch (around 30%), and somewhat higher for northern pike (around 40%).  Low mortality contributed to the higher numbers of larger fish seen in this assessment.  We lack the data needed to determine how much of that mortality was due to fishing, and how much was natural, but if total mortality has been that low, fishing mortality has probably not been excessive.  <br> \n <br> \nWhite Pine Lake continued to support modest bluegill and pumpkinseed populations.  The 2012 bluegill trap net catch was similar to catches seen in this lake since 1990.  Most of the bluegill taken were small, although a single 9.7-inch fish was taken.  All but one of the bluegill collected came from modest 2010 and 2011 year classes.  Growth of young fish had been somewhat faster than average; fish reached a mean length of 3.5 in at the end of their second year, compared to an area mean of 3.2 inches.  Pumpkinseed sunfish taken in 2012 were also small; most were less than five inches long, and most were two-year-old fish.  Pumpkinseed growth had been close to average; fish reached a mean length of 2.9 inches in two years, compared to a mean of 3.0 inches for lakes in this area. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>White Pine Lake is located about 7 miles north of Lutsen Township. There is concrete public access within the USFS campground located on the south shore which can be reached via the Honeymoon Trail. The campground also features an accessible fishing deck next to the boat launch. White Pine Lake is an Ecological Class 12 lake, which is characterized by a shallow maximum depth, complete littoral coverage, and very soft bog-stained water. Most of the shoreline is forested, with light development primarily on the south shore. Walleye and Yellow Perch are the primary management species for White Pine Lake, although the lake also supports populations of Northern Pike, Bluegill, and Pumpkinseed. <br> \n <br> \nThe 2022 Walleye gill net catch of 3.33 fish/set was the highest recorded since the 2002 but was near the lower end of the normal range of Walleye catch rates observed in similar lakes in this area. The 2022 catch did represent an increase from the previous three surveys (2007, 2012, and 2016) where catch rates ranged from 1.33 - 2.50 fish/set, which may be an indication of stabilizing natural recruitment by the Walleye population. Walleye sampled in gill nets and 0.75-inch-mesh trap nets ranged from 8.1 - 25.5 inches and had a mean length of about 14 inches. Aging results from the Walleye sample indicate small, but consistent natural year classes were produced 2018 - 2021.  These results suggest that Walleye natural recruitment and relative abundance has improved recently, but remained short of the long-range goal identified for the population in the current lake management plan (5.0 fish/gill net set).  <br> \n <br> \nThe 2022 Yellow Perch gill net catch of 21.00 fish/set was considered high when compared to similar lakes in the region but typical for this lake. Average size of Yellow Perch sampled in gill net sets was also high with an average weight of 0.27 lb/fish. Lengths of fish collected in all sampling gears ranged from 5.5 - 11.8 inches. Yellow Perch in White Pine Lake provide a high-quality forage base for Walleye and Northern Pike in addition to quality angling opportunities, as about 29% of the perch sampled in 2022 were nine inches or greater. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike appeared very abundant in White Pine Lake in 2022. The gill net catch (7.17 fish/set) was the highest observed to date for the lake and fell above the normal range of catch rates observed on similar lakes. No aging structures were collected from Northern Pike in 2022, although the length frequency of collected Northern Pike indicated multiple age classes contributed to the sample and included fish as large as 36.7 inches.  A notable proportion of the fish sampled in 2022 were near or above the preferred size (28 inches) for Northern Pike, suggesting the population can provide quality angling opportunities and the potential for memorable fish, even at higher densities.  <br> \n <br> \nBluegill have been established in White Pine Lake since at least 1990 but have generally appeared at low-moderate abundances in most surveys. The 2022 Bluegill 0.75-inch-mesh trap net was the highest recorded to date by a wide margin (6.8 fish/set) and was considered high compared to similar lakes that support Bluegill. The Bluegill sample included fish between 3.7 and 10.8 inches, with about 25% of the sample comprised of quality sized fish (six inches or larger).  Aging results identified nine naturally produced year classes, including fish as old as 10 years old. Increased Bluegill abundance documented in 2022 was bolstered by strong survival of the 2020 (age-2) year class, which accounted for about 68% of the sample. Catch rates of Pumpkinseed were also the highest recorded to date for White Pine Lake. The sample included fish from from 3.5 - 6.3 inches, although most were five inches or less. With increasing relative abundance and size structure of both Bluegill and Pumpkinseed, White Pine Lake may provide a valuable opportunity for anglers to target panfish in an area where those fisheries have historically been limited. <br> \n <br> \nAs of 2022, no aquatic invasive species had been reported or identified in White Pine Lake. Anglers and boaters are reminded to review the recommended actions for cleaning watercraft and gear before and after accessing any waterbody, and to adhere to all Minnesota aquatic invasive species laws to protect Minnesota lakes and rivers from additional infestations. <br> \n</p>",

Walleye had grown quickly. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch were abundant, and some large fish were present.  They were a good source of forage for walleye and northern pike, and provided some angling opportunity. <br> \n <br> \nThe northern pike catch was the second highest for the lake and fell within the normal range for the lake class.  Average size of pike was the largest recorded for the lake historically.  Five year classes (ages 1-5) were identified in the sample, and all had been naturally produced.  The growth rate of northern pike had been close to the average for the lake class. <br> \n <br> \nA moderate bluegill population was present, but fish were smaller than most anglers would prefer.  Pumpkinseed sunfish were slightly more numerous, but they were also small. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>White Pine Lake is located about 7 miles north of Lutsen Township. There is concrete public access within the USFS campground located on the south shore off the Honeymoon Trail. The campground also features an accessible fishing deck next to the boat launch. White Pine Lake is an Ecological Class 12 lake, which is characterized by a shallow maximum depth, complete littoral coverage, and very soft bog-stained water. Most of the shoreline is forested, with light development primarily on the south shore. Walleye and Yellow Perch are the primary management species for White Pine Lake, although the lake also supports populations of Northern Pike and Bluegill.  <br> \n <br> \nThe 2016 standard survey of White Pine Lake was the first of two scheduled in the 2014 lake management plan to monitor the fish community, and determine if long-range goals for Walleye and Yellow Perch were being met. The current goals for this lake are to maintain a Walleye population with a minimum gill net catch of 5.0 fish/net and some fish over 20 inches present, and to maintain a Yellow Perch population with a minimum gill net catch of 14.0 fish/net with a minimum mean weight for gill-net-sampled fish of 0.25 lb/fish.  <br> \n <br> \nThe 2016 Walleye gill net catch was the second lowest observed for White Pine Lake, and was also below average compared to other Class 12 lakes. This was the third consecutive survey in which the long-range catch goal for Walleye was not met. The mean weight of Walleye sampled in gill nets was lower than more recent surveys, but was similar to historical results from this lake, and fell within the normal range for the lake class. Natural recruitment of Walleye appeared to have improved slightly since the 2012 survey. The combined catch of Walleye in 2016 included five naturally produced year classes between one and seven years of age, with three- and five-year-old fish comprising a majority of the sample. Growth of Walleye appeared to be fairly fast. On average, Walleye reached 12.5 inches by the end of their year, compared to 11.1 inches for Walleye populations in similar lakes in this area. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch remained very abundant in White Pine Lake in 2016. The gill net catch and mean weight of Yellow Perch sampled in this gear were above average for Class 12 lakes, and the long-range catch and size goals for the population were met. Trap net catches of Yellow Perch were also high for a Class 12 lake. A wide variety of sizes were sampled in this survey, indicating several year classes contributed to the sample. Beyond serving as a high quality forage for Walleye and Northern Pike, the Yellow Perch population in White Pine Lake also appeared capable of providing quality angling opportunities. Overall, about 36 percent of the Yellow Perch sampled in 2016 were greater than 8 inches long, with a few fish approaching 12 inches. <br> \n <br> \nThe 2016 gill net catch of Northern Pike was within the normal range for the lake class, and was similar to catches observed in White Pine Lake since 1985. The mean weight of Northern Pike sampled in gill nets was the highest observed to date, continuing a trend of increasing mean weight since 1985. The higher mean weight for this survey was influenced by the presence of a few large individuals (>30 inches) present in the gill net sample; most of the sample consisted of small Northern Pike averaging about 1.2 lb/fish. Five naturally produced year classes of Northern Pike made up the 2016 sample.  Fish from the 2013 year class were the most abundant, but fish as old as seven years (2009 year class) were seen. Growth of younger Northern Pike was similar to other Class 12 lakes in this area. On average, fish reached 18.6 inches by the end of their third year, compared to an area average of 18.2 inches. White Pine Lake has a history of producing a few large Northern Pike, undoubtedly due to the excellent Yellow Perch forage base present in the lake. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill and Pumpkinseed sunfish were first sampled in White Pine Lake in 1990, and have been routinely sampled in modest numbers since. The 2016 gill net and trap net catches for Bluegill were the highest observed to date for this lake. The combined Bluegill sample was well distributed between fish from one to seven years of age, with no missing year classes. Growth rates of Bluegill had been about average; fish reached a mean length of 7.1 inches at the end of their fifth year, compared to an area mean of 6.8 inches. Based on these results, it appears the Bluegill population has expanded in recent years, and may provide a bonus fishery for anglers on White Pine Lake. The trap net catch of Pumpkinseed sunfish was similar to past catches on White Pine Lake. Most of the Pumpkinseeds sampled in 2016 were 5 inches or less. <br> \n <br> \nWhite Sucker was the only other species sampled in 2016. Additional species sampled in past surveys of White Pine Lake include Black Crappie, Golden Shiner, and Longnose Dace. <br> \n <br> \nAs of 2016, no aquatic invasive species had been reported or identified in White Pine Lake. Anglers and boaters are reminded to review the recommended actions for cleaning watercraft and gear before and after accessing any waterbody, and to adhere to all Minnesota aquatic invasive species laws to protect Minnesota lakes and rivers from additional infestations. <br> \n</p>",
