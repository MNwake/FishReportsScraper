Splake, a hybrid of brook trout and lake trout, were stocked instead of rainbows in 1990 and 1992.One rainbow trout was caught during the 1996 assessment; no splake were caught.  The trout catch in 1996 of 0.1 lb/gillnet was lower than the long term average catch in Norberg Lake of 1.3 lb/gillnet, and much lower than the average catch of 10.6 lb/gillnet for 24 stream trout lakes in the Ely Management Area.  In addition to the rainbow trout, three small white sucker were caught in 1996.The rainbow trout caught in 1996 was 8.4\" and was probably from two groups stocked the previous fall at average lengths of 6\" and 9\".

Norberg Lake is a seven acre lake with a maximum depth of 26 feet.  \n\nRainbow trout were stocked in Norberg in 2016, after the survey so anglers can expect both brook trout and rainbow trout to be present. Rainbow trout were subsituted due to a shortage of available brook trout. Rainbow trout will continued to be stocked until brook trout are again available.\n\nThe 2016 survey captured two brook trout in two nets which is on par with recent surveys.  Both fish were around 9 inches long and weighed about 1/3 of a pound.  These fish appeared slightly smaller than brook trout in some of the other recent assessments.  Aquatic insects and fish remains were found in each of their stomachs.\n</p>",

Shallow water lake bottom substrates are mostly boulder and rubble.  Aquatic plants are sparse and grow to a depth of 5 ft; coontail, variable pondweed, and yellow waterlily are the most common plants.This stream trout assessment consisted of two gillnets set in early May.  The only fish caught were six small white sucker.  Nine previous assessments were conducted from 1977 through 1996.  These assessments caught an average of 1.2 lb trout/gillnet, which is lower than the median catch of 5.4 lb trout/gillnet in recent assessments of 25 stream trout lakes in the Ely Management Area.An average of 350 rainbow trout yearlings weighing 0.3 lb each have been stocked in Norberg Lake each year beginning in 1996.  According to Bear Head Lake State Park managers, fishing pressure and fishing success in Norberg Lake has been satisfactory since this stocking regime was begun, although not as good as in nearby Cub Lake, which has been stocked with similar numbers of brook trout yearlings.  Historically, trout sizes in Norberg Lake have been small, averaging 10\" with a maximum size of 13\".</p>",

Norberg Lake was poisoned in 1963 to remove the pike, and stream trout have been stocked annually since then.  The 2005 trout assessment consisted of two gillnets set in late April, prior to the stockings of rainbow trout yearling.No trout were caught in the 2005 assessment, and Park personnel say that very few trout were caught by anglers in this lake in the last few years.  Eleven previous trout assessments on Norberg Lake dating back to 1977 captured an average of 1.1 lb trout/gillnet, which was lower than the median trout catch (all species) of 3.5 lb/gillnet in recent assessments of 25 stream trout lakes in the Tower Fisheries Management Area.

                "narrative": "<p>Norberg Lake is in Ecological Lake Class 9, which consists of 48 lakes in northeast Minnesota that are very small and have soft (unmineralized) water.  Norberg Lake thermally stratifies in midsummer and retains good oxygen for trout (more than 5 ppm) to a depth of about 15 ft, where the temperature is in the low 50's F.  There are no inlets or outlets.  Lake bottom substrates along the shoreline are mostly boulder and rubble.  Aquatic plants are sparse and grow to a depth of 5 ft; coontail, pondweed, and waterlilies are the most common plants.The initial fisheries survey on Norberg Lake in 1962 captured only northern pike.  Norberg Lake was poisoned in 1963 and stream trout have been stocked annually since then.The 2002 stream trout assessment consisted of two gillnets set in mid May. One 11\" rainbow trout was caught.  The catch of trout by weight in 2002 of 0.4 lb/gillnet was similar to the median catch of 0.7 lb/gillnet in eleven investigations on this lake since trout stocking began, and was lower than the median trout catch of 5.0 lb/gillnet (all trout species combined) in recent assessments of 25 stream trout lakes in the Tower Fisheries Management Area.Also captured in 2002 were two small (7\") white sucker.  Low numbers of  small white sucker were captured in several previous investigations on this lake.  </p>",
