                "narrative": "<p>A full resurvey was conducted at Spring Lake in Meeker County, with netting begining on 6/16/03.  Spring Lake is 218 acres and has a maximum depth of 30 feet.  The public access is located on the north side of the lake in the county park.  Submerged vegetation was classifed as rare when sampling took place in late July.  Curlyleaf pondweed was more abundant in May and early June, but died back by late June.  Algal blooms can be intense during summer months on Spring Lake.  Water clarity was measured to be 4 feet in mid-June.  Spring Lake has a long history of winterkill.  A partial winterkill occurred during the 2000-2001 winter.  Spring Lake is primarily managed for northern pike and black crappie.Netting in 2003 indicated that there were high numbers of northern pike (16.7/net) present at Spring Lake.  Northern pike were 14.7-31.8 inches long averaging 21.8 inches.  The northern pike catch rate was similar to the lakes historical average (13.2/net), indicating a typical population for Spring Lake.  Most (74%) of the fish gill netted were between 18 and 25 inches.  A total of 9 black crappie were sampled in trap nets.  The 2003 catch rate (1.0/net) was the lowest catch rate recorded since netting began in 1974, inidcating that the current population is probably small.  Trap netted black crappie were 6.3-8.7 inches long and averaged 7.2 inches.  Good numbers of bluegill were sampled, but most were small, averaging 5.3 inches.  Only 1% of the trap net sample was 7 inches or longer.  A total of 4 largemouth bass were sampled in gill and trap nets.  Neither of these gears effectively sample largmouth bass.  Spring night-time electrofishing, the standard gear for sampling largemouth bass, was not conducted in 2003.  Sampled bass were 7.9-17.2 inches long.  No walleye were caught in 2003.  Moderate numbers of yellow perch were sampled, but size was small.  Yellow perch averaged 6.1 inches.  Black bullhead were the most abundant fish sampled (62.8/net) in this survey, ranging in size from 4.8-12.2 inches.  Anglers fishing Spring Lake may want to concentrate their efforts on the excellent population of northern pike.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>STATUS OF THE FISHERY:\nSevere winterkill adversely affects the Spring Lake fish population every 3 to 10 years.  The results of the 1988-1989 winterkill can be seen in the 1989 net catches.  Carp, black bullhead and yellow perch survived.  Black crappie numbers reflect stocking of adult fish in the spring of 1989.  History of fish spawning, evaluated by seining, would indicate little to no natural reproduction for northern pike, largemouth bass, bluegill and black crappie.  Populations of pike and bass should be reestablished by stocking.  The 1989 shoreline seining showed significant natural reproduction of bluegills.  Shoreline seining also showed a large number of green sunfish young of the year.  Yellow perch numbers were reduced by winterkill, but the gillnet catch was still good (8.2/net).  With successful natural reproduction, the population could firmly reestablish itself and provide forage for a variety of fish species.  The minnow population is dominated by fathead minnows.  History of the lake indicates low numbers of golden shiners and emerald shiners.  Improved water quality in future years could increase the numbers of these two species.  This may not occur until higher water levels reconnect Spring Lake to Long Lake.  During years of high water, migration of fish from Long Lake aids in reestablishing populations of crappie, bluegill, northern pike and largemouth bass after winterkill.  Diversion of the City of Dassel sewage discharge from Spring Lake (1985) should eventually decrease fish population fluctuations due to winterkill.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A standard survey was conducted at Spring Lake on June 18, 2018, to monitor the fish population.  Spring is a class 34 lake and net catches were compared to similar lakes around the state.  The 2014 lake management plan (LMP) listed Bluegill, Largemouth Bass, and Northern Pike as the primary management species while Black Crappie were considered a secondary management species.  A total of 11 species, plus Hybrid Sunfish, were sampled in the gill nets (GN), trap nets (TN), or by spring night-time electrofishing targeting Largemouth Bass.  On June 19, the dissolved oxygen concentration fell below 2.0 mg/l at 14.0 feet, indicating that some of the lake (maximum depth of 30 feet) lacked sufficient oxygen for fish use at this time of the year.  Water clarity was fair, with a secchi disk reading of 5.9 feet.  Curlyleaf Pondweed was common around the shoreline during netting week. Curlyleaf Pondweed is a non-native aquatic plant that can reach nuisance levels in May and June but typically dies back in early July. Spring Lake has a history of occasional winterkill with the latest significant event occurring in 2001.  Fish populations (especially Bluegill and Largemouth Bass) can fluctuate widely depending on frequency and severity of winterkill.  DNR Parks and Trails installed a fishing pier at the north end of the lake in 2018. <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled high numbers of Northern Pike (63) for a catch rate of 10.5/net, which was above the lake's normal range.  The 2014 LMP's Northern Pike long range goal (>5.1/net) was met.  The 2013 catch rate was 29.0/net.  Catch rates from 1974 to 2018 (n=10) were variable, ranging from 0.2 to 29.0/net with an average of 10.4.  Historically, recruitment could be classified as moderate (>5.0/GN) to high (>10.0/GN) at Spring Lake.  Northern Pike were last stocked in 1991, indicating ample natural reproduction most years.  In 2018, Northern Pike were 18.9 to 29.6 inches long with an average of 23.9.  Trap nets sampled fish up to 33.1 inches in length.  Data indicated a quality size structure.  Size distributions indicated that multiple age classes were present.  New Northern Pike zone regulations went into effect in the spring of 2018.  Long is in the north central regulation zone, which has a 10 fish bag limit, where all fish from 22 to 26 inches in length have to be immediately released and only two harvested fish can be over 26 inches long.  Darkhouse spearers are allowed to have one fish in the protected slot limit.  Spring Lake was occasionally clear enough for darkhouse spearing, but many years was too turbid.  Pike anglers should expect plenty of action at Spring Lake. <br> \n <br> \nTrap nets sampled low to moderate numbers of Black Crappie (34) for a catch rate of 3.8/net, which was within the lake's normal range.  The 2013 TN catch rate was similar at 2.4/net.  Catch rates from 1974 to 2018 (n=10) were highly variable, ranging from 1.0 to 74.8/net with an average of 22.8.  In 2018, TN Black Crappie were 3.7 to 9.1 inches long with an average of 5.7.  Only 1 TN fish was 9 inches or longer, indicating a poor size structure.  Gill nets sampled low numbers of Black Crappie (14) for a catch rate of 2.3/net, which was just below the lake's normal range and was tied for the second lowest catch rate on record.  The 2013 GN catch rate was also 2.3/net.  Gill net catch rates from 1974 to 2018 (n=10) were variable, ranging from 0.5 to 115.0/net with an average of 17.7.  Gill netted Black Crappie were 4.4 to 9.6 inches long with an average of 6.5.  Size distributions indicated inconsistent recruitment, but at least two year classes were present.   <br> \n <br> \nGill nets and TN's failed to sample any Walleye in 2018.  The 2013 GN catch rate was also 0.0/net.  Catch rates from 1974 to 2018 (n=10), were all low, ranging from 0.0 to 0.2/net with an average of 0.0.  Walleye were last stocked in 1965.  The spring night-time electrofishing crew observed 1 Walleye during Largemouth Bass sampling.  Anglers seeking Walleye should try nearby Collinwood or Big Swan Lakes. <br> \n <br> \nTrap nets sampled moderate numbers of Bluegill (328) for a catch rate of 36.4/net which was within the lake's normal range.  The 2014 LMP's Bluegill long range goal (>5.9/TN and <43.3/TN) was met.  The 2013 TN catch rate was very similar at 33.3/net.  Catch rates from 1974 to 2018 (n=10) were variable, ranging from 0.0 to 42.3/net, with an average of 19.4.  An ecological shift seems to have occurred around and after 1993 making the lake more suitable for Bluegill.  The average catch rate for the 1974 to 1992 time period (n=6) was 6.8/TN, while the average for the 1994 to 2018 time period (n=4) was 38.2/TN.  This shift was likely due to the lake's better water quality conditions at least in part following the building of the city of Dassel's new water-water treatment plant around 1985.  Before 1985, effluent ended up in Spring Lake, which led to excessive nutrients and intense algae blooms.  In 2018, TN Bluegill were 3.2 to 8.8 inches long with an average of 5.2.  Approximately 4% of the catch was 7.0 inches or longer, while 25% of the TN sample was 6 inches or longer.  Data indicated a poor size structure in 2018.  In 2018, size distributions indicated that multiple year classes were present and recruitment was probably fairly consistent.    <br> \n <br> \nSpring night-time electrofishing targeting Largemouth Bass sampled high numbers (274) of fish for a catch rate of 139.8/hour, which was the highest catch ever recorded at Spring Lake.  The 2014 LMP's long range goal (>31.0/hour) was met.  The 2013 catch rate was 31.0/hour.  In 2018, electrofished Largemouth Bass were 6.7 to 20.5 inches long with an average of 11.1.  An impressive 30 fish total were 18 inches or longer, indicating a high quality size structure.  The electrofishing size distribution indicated that multiple age classes were present.  Bass anglers can expect to find this species roaming in Spring's plentiful submerged vegetation beds. <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled low numbers of Yellow Perch (34) for a catch rate of 5.7/net, which was within the lake's normal range.  The 2013 catch rate was 1.0/net.  Catch rates from 1974 to 2018 (n=10) were variable, ranging from 0.5 to 17.8/net with an average of 6.5.  In 2018, Yellow Perch were 4.9 to 6.6 inches long with an average of 6.2.  Data indicated inconsistent recruitment.  High numbers of Northern Pike since 2003 (average catch rate of 18.7/GN) have likely limited the Yellow Perch population.       <br> \n <br> \nTrap nets sampled low numbers of Common Carp (3) for a catch rate of 0.3/net which was within the lake's normal range and was the second lowest catch rate on record.  Historic TN catch rates (n=10) from 1974 to 2018 were highly variable, ranging from 0.0 to 37.0/net with an average of 7.2.  In 2018, the TN Common Carp were 20.0 to 23.5 inches in length.  Gill nets also sampled low numbers of Common Carp (1) for a catch rate of 0.2/net, which was below the lake's normal range and the lowest catch rate on record.  Historic GN catch rates (n=10) were highly variable, ranging from 0.2 to 78.5/net with an average of 18.8.  Bluegill (a known predator on Common Carp eggs) catch rates have been relatively stable from 1994 to 2018 (averaging 38.2/TN) and numbers have likely been high enough to control Common Carp reproduction within Spring Lake.   <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled moderate to high numbers of Black Bullhead (448) for a catch rate of 74.7/net, which was above the lake's normal range.  The 2013 catch rate was much lower at 4.3/net.  Historic GN catch rates from 1974 to 2018 (n=10) were highly variable, ranging from 4.3 to 117.0/net with an average of 53.2.  Gill netted fish were 6.6 to 13.9 inches long with an average of 9.3.  Trap nets sampled low numbers (10) of Black Bullhead for a catch rate of 1.1/net, which was within the lake's normal range and the second lowest catch rate on record.  The 2013 TN catch rate was 0.7/net.  Historic TN catch rates from 1974 to 2018 (n=10) were variable, ranging from 0.7 to 96.0/net with an average of 31.7.  The size distributions indicated inconsistent recruitment.       <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled moderate numbers of Yellow Bullhead (140) for a catch rate of 23.3/net which was above the lake's normal range and the highest ever measured at Spring Lake.  The 2013 GN catch rate was 0.0/net.  Historic GN catch rates from 1974 to 2018 (n=10) were mostly low, ranging from 0.0 to 23.3/net with an average of 3.1.  In 2018, gill netted Yellow Bullhead were 5.5 to 14.3 inches long with an average of 9.3.  Approximately 51% of the GN sample was 9 inches or longer indicating a quality population that may appeal to bullhead anglers.  The GN size distribution indicated that multiple year classes were present. <br> \n <br> \nAdditional species sampled in the standard gear included; Brown Bullhead, Green Sunfish, and Pumpkinseed Sunfish.   <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A full resurvey was conducted at Spring Lake in Meeker County in 2013 to monitor the fish population. Spring Lake is managed for Black Crappie, Bluegill, and Northern Pike. It has a long history of winterkill although none have been reported in recent years. <br> \n <br> \nThe Spring Lake lakeshed (2,235 acres) was highly disturbed and dominated by livestock and hay pasture (31%), row crop agriculture (27%), and residential and municipal uses associated with the city of Dassel (26%). The shoreline of the lake was moderately developed with residential homes (53) making it the largest type of shoreline use (45%) in 2013 followed by forested use (33%). The secchi disk reading was 4 feet, the same as recorded in the 2003 resurvey. The vegetation survey sampled 9 species of submergent plants out to a maximum depth of 12 feet with 3 species rated as common and a single species rated as abundant. Shoalwater substrates were dominated by sand, silt, and detritus and were similar to the 2003 sample.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike numbers remained high in Spring Lake with a total of 174 Northern Pike sampled with gill nets for a catch rate of 29.0/net. The catch rate in 2003 was 16.7/net. Since 1974, 4 out of 9 (44%) Northern Pike gill net catch rates indicated high numbers were present with an average catch rate of 10.4/net. Lengths ranged from 16.6 to 31.4 inches with an average length of 21.7 inches. A total of 22 Northern Pike were sampled with trap nets for a catch rate of 2.4/net. They ranged from 18.5 to 31.6 inches with a mean length of 22.6 inches. Northern Pike from both net gears ranged from 2 to 7 years old with 6 year-classes present. Two and three year old fish accounted for 86% of the sample. Growth was fast. <br> \n <br> \nA total of 22 Black Crappies were sampled with trap nets for a catch rate of 2.4/net, indicating low to moderate numbers were present. Since 1974, Black Crappie catch rates have varied from 1.0/net to 74.8/net with an average catch rate of 24.9/net. Lengths ranged from 4.9 to 11.8 inches with an average of 6.9 inches. A total of 14 Black Crappies were sampled with trap nets for a catch rate of 2.3/net with lengths ranging from 4.8 to 5.9 inches. Black Crappies from both net gears ranged from 2 to 6 years old with 5 year-classes present. Two and three year old fish accounted for 92% of the sample. Growth was slow. <br> \n <br> \nA total of 300 Bluegills were sampled with trap nets for a catch rate of 33.3/net, indicating moderate to high numbers were present for the third consecutive sample (1994, 2003, 2013). Since 1974, Bluegill catch rates have varied from 0/net to 42.3/net with an average of 17.5/net. Lengths varied from 3.0 to 7.5 inches with an average length of 5.1 inches. A total of 5 Bluegills measuring 5.9 to 6.8 inches were sampled with gill nets for a catch rate of 0.8/net.  <br> \n <br> \nA total of 31 Largemouth Bass were sampled spring night-time electrofishing for a catch rate of 31.0/hour on-time which was less than the 58/hour on-time sampled in 2003. Lengths ranged from 7.9 to 19.6 inches with an average length of 13.2 inches. An additional 5 Largemouth Bass ranging from 14.6 to 18.4 inches were sampled in the net gears. Largemouth Bass from all gears ranged from 2 to 7 years old with 6 year-classes present. Growth was moderate. In the absence of any recent winterkill events, Spring Lake now supports a respectable Largemouth Bass population. <br> \n <br> \nJust 6 Yellow Perch between 5.4 and 6.4 inches were sampled with gill nets for a catch rate of 1.0/net, which was the lowest catch rate in 6 samples dating back to 1982 indicating low numbers were present. Historically, catch rates have varied from 1.0/net to 17.8/net with an average of 6.6/net. No Yellow Perch were sampled with gill nets in 2013. <br> \n <br> \nA single 5 year old Walleye measuring 23.2 inches long was sampled with gill nets in 2013 despite no stocking of Walleyes into Spring Lake since the 1960's. This fish was most likely a result of an unauthorized introduction. Currently, Spring Lake is not managed for Walleye. <br> \n <br> \nA total of 26 Black Bullheads were sampled with gill nets in 2013 for a catch rate of 4.3/net, which was the lowest catch rate ever recorded indicating low to moderate numbers were present. The 2003 catch rate was 62.8 and historically catch rates have ranged from 4.3/net to 117.0/net with an average of 50.8/net. Just 6 Black Bullheads were sampled with trap nets for a catch rate of 0.7/net, which was also the lowest ever recorded for Spring Lake. Overall, it appears that Black Bullhead numbers are declining rapidly in Spring Lake. This may be a response to the recent paucity in winterkill events and mirrors an observed area-wide trend. <br> \n <br> \nJust 1 Common Carp was sampled with gill nets and 7 with trap nets in 2013, for catch rates of 0.2/net and 0.8/net, respectively. Historically, gill net catch rates have ranged from 0/net to 78.5/net with an average catch rate of 8.0/net. Over the last ten years though, catch rates have declined to an average of just 0.7/net. Like the Black Bullhead population, Common Carp numbers have declined sharply in recent years. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled in 2013 include Bowfin, Pumpkinseed, Green Sunfish, hybrid sunfish (Lepomis spp.), and Yellow Bullhead. <br> \n</p>",

Fish probably migrate in from adjacent Long Lake, as Spring Lake suffered a severe winterkill during winter 1977-78.  Black crappies were captured in large numbers at 69/trapnet; these are smaller fish (average length 5.0 inches) and growth is good.  There was natural reproduction of largemouth bass and growth is excellent.  Fishing pressure is almost non-existent.</p>",

Yellow perch populations (1.0/gillnet) are below any level which would supply adequate forage for larger predators.  Largemouth bass (0.8/trapnet), northern pike (19.0/gillnet), and black crappies (13.2/trapnet) were all present with adequate numbers, although year class survival was sporadic.  Growth rates were close to average.  Spring Lake is connected to Long Lake at the north and fish populations vary because of movement between the two lakes.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Spring Lake can be characterized as having poor water quality and potential for frequent winterkill.  A lack of submersed vegetation limits fish populations and the lake experiences severe algal blooms.  A fisheries survey was conducted on Spring Lake in 1994 that included an assessment of fish populations with standardlake survey gillnets, trapnets, shoreline seining and spring, night electrofishing.  Fish species of particular interest captured in the survey included black bullhead, black crappie, bluegill, largemouthbass, northern pike, walleye and yellow perch.  Additional species of interest sampled in the survey included commoncarp, green sunfish, pumpkinseed sunfish, golden shiner and yellow bullhead.  Several snapping turtles and a false mapturtle were also sampled in trapnets. The black bullhead catch in gillnets and trapnets was above the lake class average, but within the normal range. Average length was similar for both gear types (7.7 and 6.9 inches, respectively).  Presently most black bullhead arenot large enough to be desirable to anglers.  Previous surveys have documented wide fluctuations in black bullheadnumbers.The black crappie gillnet catch was within the normal range for this lake.  Black crappie trapnet catch was above the normal range for this lake.  The black crappie catch was dominated by age one fish (98%) with an average length of 5.2 inches.  This strong year class may provide good angling over the next several years.  Previous surveys have documented wide fluctuations in black crappie abundance that may be due to inconsistent recruitment.Bluegill were abundant with a trapnet catch of 40.7 per net.  Average length of bluegill captured in trapnets was 6.5 inches.  Several year classes of bluegill were present in the sample, but the catch was dominated by age three fish (77%).  Growth was good with an average length of 6.7 inches for age three fish.  Most of the bluegill should be a desirable size to anglers.No largemouth bass were sampled in gillnets or trapnets during the survey.  Six largemouth bass were sampled electrofishing at night in the spring, for a catch rate of 6.0 per hour.  Largemouth bass ranged in length from 6.7 to 12.0 inches with a mean length of 10.1 inches.Northern pike were captured in gillnets at a rate of 6.2 per net.  This was slightly above the lake class average.  Several past surveys have documented high northern pike numbers.  Northern pike sampled in gillnets ranged in length from 16.6 to 32.6 inches with an average length of 24.8 inches.  Northern pike from age one through four were present in the sample.  Age three northern pike comprised 40% of the catch and growth was good with an average length of 26.8 inches for age three fish.  The present northern pike population should be very desirable to anglers.Yellow perch numbers were above the lake class average but within the normal range for this lake.  Yellow perch through age four were present in the sample.  Age one fish comprised 50% of the sample.  Average length of yellow perch sampled in gillnets was 6.7 inches.  Growth was good with an average length of 8.2 inches for age three fish.Trapnet catches of common carp and green sunfish numbers were above the normal range for this lake.  Pumpkinseed sunfishnumbers were within the normal range for this lake.   </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>STATUS OF THE FISHERY:\nNet catch data was compared to similar lakes across the state.  Important gamefish species captured in the nets included northern pike, bluegill, largemouth bass, black crappie, yellow perch and walleye.  The northern pike gillnet catch was 5.2/net.  This was within the normal range for this type of lake.  Nearly 80% of the northern pike were age one.  Growth was good, with age 1 fish ranging in length from 15 to 19 inches.  The remaining northern pike were age 2 and 3 and were up to 28 inches in length.  Yellow perch were taken in the gillnets at a rate of 5.5/net.  This was within the normal range for this type of lake.  Yellow perch through age four were represented, with age 3 being the most abundant in the sample.  Growth was good and the age 3 and 4 perch were up to 9 inches long.  Only one walleye was captured during the survey, for a gillnet catch of 0.2/net.  This was below the normal range for this lake type.  Walleye have not been stocked recently in Spring Lake and this fish probably moved in from adjoining Long Lake, which is stocked frequently.  Trapnet catches of bluegill (9.8/net) were within the normal range for this lake type.  Only age 2 and 3 bluegill were present in the sample.  As Spring Lake is highly turbid, with very little submerged vegetation, it would not be expected to have high bluegill numbers.  However, several thousand adult bluegill were stocked in Spring Lake in 1990 and 1991, and adjoining Long Lake has good bluegill numbers.  Only one young of the year bluegill was taken during natural reproduction checks (seining) done in late summer.  Black crappie were abundant, with a trapnet catch of 75/net.  This was above the normal range for this type of lake.  A black crappie gillnet catch of 13.5/net was within the normal range for this lake type.  Age three black crappie were the most abundant, comprising over 60% of the sample.  Growth was good, with age three fish ranging from 7 to 10 inches long.  Black crappie through age five were present.  Natural reproduction checks done later in the summer produced only one young of the year black crappie.  Only one largemouth bass was taken in a trapnet.  However, four largemouth bass were sampled during natural reproduction checks done later in the year.  All bass captured were age one and two.</p>",
