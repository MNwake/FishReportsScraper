Largemouth bass composed the majority of the sport fish community.     Largemouth bass numbers were above average and growth was similar to the statewide average.  Twelve year-classes were present, which should provide consistent fishing in the future.       Adult rock bass and age-0 yellow perch were also captured in 2001.  However, the number of rock bass captured decreased drastically from the previous survey in 1970.  Also, adult yellow perch and pumpkinseed sunfish, which were captured during the previous survey, were not captured in 2001.       Loiten Lake is attractive not only because it provides great largemouth bass fishing, but also offers solitude and scenic beauty.    </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A standard lake survey was completed on Loiten Lake in 2015 as part of a scheduled investigation in accordance with the Loiten Lake management plan. Loiten is a 94 acre lake located within Voyageurs National Park. It is located in the mass of land between Kabetogama and Rainy Lake, and is part of a chain of lakes including Quill, War Club, and Locator. There is a camping site available to reserve through Voyageurs National Park.  <br> \n <br> \nLoiten was stocked with Largemouth Bass in 1950 and 1965 to create a unique fishery in an area where there are otherwise few opportunities to pursue these fish. The stocking produced a self-sustaining population of fish in Loiten. Largemouth Bass are difficult to sample with standard netting gear used in surveys, so angling was used to sample a better representation of the population during the 2015 survey. The population is characterized by large numbers of small to medium sized fish. Angling is excellent, with a fish measured about every nine minutes. Largemouth up to 16.2 inches were caught, and an average fish measured 12.5 inches. The only other species of fish sampled were Rock Bass, and they were present in very low numbers. <br> \n <br> \nSteep drop offs around most of the lake concentrate fish in the small area of shallow water near shore. This means that most of the desirable fishing areas are within reach of anglers casting from shore. While many experienced anglers would enjoy the fast paced action on Loiten, this would also be an excellent lake to take kids or new anglers to learn how to catch bass while enjoying some beautiful scenery.  <br> \n</p>",
