                "narrative": "<p>Silversack Lake is a small class 13 lake located in the southwest corner of Koochiching County 4.5 miles northwest of Northome. The lake is relatively deep, 25 feet, given its relatively small size (19 acres). Productivity is moderate to high compared to other northern Minnesota lakes.  There is no improved boat ramp on the lake.No fish were captured in either the gill nets or the 3/4-inch trap nets used during this survey.  The only fish identified were captured in a fine mesh trap net set to investigate the presence of forage species. Four species were present including central mudminnow, Iowa darter, brook stickleback and northern redbelly dace. Past netting (1962, 1964, 1972, 1975 and 1977) indicated the presence of largemouth bass, pumpkinseed, bluegill and white sucker. No individuals of these species were observed during this survey.</p>",
