Nothern pike were sampled above median levels for abundance, and have shown a significant increase in the last five years. The average northern pike sampled was 21.8 inches and 2.88 pounds. Approximately 10% of all individuals sampled were 26.0 inches or larger. Golden shiners were abundant and should provide a good forage base for the northern pike. Black crappie were sampled within the normal range for abundance and averaged 7.2 inches and 0.22 pounds (4.55 fish/pound). The bluegill population was low, but has received supplemental stocking of adults in fall of 2001. Yellow perch were sampled below median levels of abundance and averaged 7.6 inches in length. Black and yellow bullheads are present in near equal abundance. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Como Lake is a shallow, 70 acre lake located in a highly developed urban watershed in the City of Saint Paul. Como Lake receives direct runoff from 22 storm sewers and water quality is generally very poor. The entire lake is encompassed by Como Park, a regional park managed by Saint Paul Parks and Recreation. A fishing pier is located on the south shore of the lake along with a small parking lot. During summer this area of the lake can experience heavy submersed aquatic vegetation growth that may impede fishing from the pier with all but topwater baits. Chemical control of nuisance algae blooms and mechanical control of nuisance rooted aquatic plants have been conducted periodically. Several areas around the lake are conducive to shore fishing and much of the shoreline has been restored in recent years with native plantings. There is no official boat ramp on the lake but carry on watercraft and electric motors are allowed to be used; paddleboats are available to rent as well. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye are the primary management species on Como Lake and regular stocking occur in the spring and fall. Bluegill and Black Crappie were the most abundant species observed during this survey; average sizes for each species were, 4.4 inches and 6.1 inches respectively. Twelve Walleye were sampled in trapnets during this survey, with lengths ranging from 8.0 to 23 inches long. Black Bullhead were sampled in below average abundance for lakes like Como during this survey. Black Bullhead size and quality in Como Lake is above average when compared to most metro area lakes. The majority of the Black Bullheads ranged in size from 8.0 to 11.5 inches. Other species sampled in low abundance during this survey included Largemouth Bass, Yellow Perch, Pumpkinseed, Hybrid and Green sunfish. <br> \n</p>",

The entire lake is encompassed by Como Park, a regional park managed by Saint Paul Parks and Recreation. A fishing pier is located on the south shore of the lake along with a small parking lot. During summer this area of the lake can experience heavy submerged aquatic vegetation growth that may impede fishing from the pier with all but topwater baits. Several areas around the lake are conducive to shore fishing and much of the shoreline has been restored in recent years with native plantings. There is not a boat ramp but electric motors are allowed to be used on the lake, and paddleboats are available to rent as well. <br> \n <br> \nThe primary management species on Como Lake are bluegill sunfish and channel catfish. Northern pike, though not managed for, were very abundant in the 2011 survey with nearly 50 fish caught during the survey. The average length and weight was approximately 23\" and three pounds. The largest fish measured 30 inches, but most fish were in the 20\" to 25\" size range. Bluegill and black crappie were abundant, though of small size, 5.4 inches and 6.2 inches respectively. Walleye were stocked most recently in 2000 (230 yearlings), 2001 (3,022 fingerlings), 2010 (4 yearlings) and 2011 (3,567 fingerlings-6 adults). It is likely that the five fish sampled during this survey originated with those stockings. The fish measured between 19\" and 24\" long and averaged nearly three pounds.  <br> \n <br> \nChannel catfish have been stocked into Como Lake during the periods of 1996-2003 and 2007-2011. This survey sampled them in moderate abundance (19 total fish) which is the most sampled to date at Como Lake. These fish clustered into two groups, those under 13 inches long (N=14) and those over 19 inches long (N=4). One fish was partially consumed and therefore no measurement taken. The larger fish probably originated in the Sauk River near Cold Spring, Minnesota and have been netted and stocked into Como Lake since 2007. The smaller fish were all likely fish that have been purchased from a private fish hatchery and stocked into the lake. <br> \n <br> \nBlack bullhead and yellow bullhead were both sampled during this survey in moderate numbers and ranged in size from 6.8\" to 12.6\" long. Other species sampled during this survey included one largemouth bass (16.2\" long), yellow perch (all fish measured less than eight inches,) Pumpkinseed sunfish, hybrid sunfish, white sucker and golden shiners.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Como Lake is a shallow lake (9 foot maximum depth).  An aeration system prevents winterkill of fish.  The lake is located in St. Paul's very popular Como Park.  The entire shoreline is city-owned.  There is a fishing pier on the south side and several other spots to fish from shore.  A paved walking path goes around the entire lake.  Canoes and carry-in craft are allowed, as are electric motors, but there is no boat ramp.  During the mid-summer, dense vegetation can make fishing difficult from shore or pier.\n\nBlack bullhead, bluegill, and northern pike were the most abundant species sampled in this assessment.  Bullhead abundance seems to be on the rise from low abundance in the 1990s.  Lengths ranged from 5 to 12 inches, with most between 6 and 7 inches.  Bluegill lengths ranged from 3 to 8 inches, with about 20% over 6 inches.  Northern pike have flourished since the late 1990's and are abundant.  Lengths sampled ranged from 16 to 32 inches, with 19 to 23 inches being the predominant size group.  \n\nWalleyes were sampled in moderate numbers and were large - 17 to 22 inches.  Black crappie abundance is low to moderate.  Lengths ranged from 5.5 to 10.5 inches, with most between 6 and 7 inches.  Very few yellow perch were sampled - they were 4.5 to 7.5 inches long.  \n\nNo largemouth bass or channel catfish were sampled.  In the late 1980's and early 1990's an experimental regulation required release of bass less than 16 inches long.  During that time, bass abundance was high, but the bass population has declined dramatically since the regulation expired in 1993.  Channel catfish were stocked from 1996 to 2003, but abundance was never high and angler interest was low, so stocking was discontinued in 2004.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Como Lake is a shallow, 70 acre lake located in a highly developed urban watershed in the City of Saint Paul. Como Lake receives direct runoff from 22 storm sewers and water quality is generally very poor. The entire lake is encompassed by Como Park, a regional park managed by Saint Paul Parks and Recreation. A fishing pier is located on the south shore of the lake along with a small parking lot. During summer this area of the lake can experience heavy submersed aquatic vegetation growth that may impede fishing from the pier with all but topwater baits. Chemical control of nuisance algae blooms and mechanical control of nuisance rooted aquatic plants have been conducted periodically. Several areas around the lake are conducive to shore fishing and much of the shoreline has been restored in recent years with native plantings. There is no official boat ramp on the lake but carry on watercraft and electric motors are allowed to be used, paddleboats are available to rent as well. <br> \n <br> \nThe primary management species on Como Lake are Bluegill Sunfish and Channel Catfish. Northern Pike, though not managed for, were abundant in the 2016 survey. The largest pike measured 33 inches, but most fish were in the 20\" to 25\" size range. Bluegill and Black Crappie were the most abundant species observed during this survey, though of small size, 5.5 inches and 6.7 inches respectively. Walleye were stocked most recently in 2011 (3,567 fingerlings-6 adults), 2013 (476 fingerlings), 2014 (71,000 fry and 4,108 yearlings), 2015 (2,840 yearlings) and 2016 (903 yearlings). Only two Walleye were sampled in trapnets during this survey, the fish measured between 7.5\" and 18\"long. Channel Catfish have been stocked into Como Lake during the periods of 2007-2011, 2014 and 2015. This survey sampled them in moderate abundance (3 total fish). These fish ranged in size from 17 to 22 inches long. These fish probably originated in the Sauk River near Cold Spring, Minnesota and have been netted and stocked into Como Lake since 2007. Black Bullhead were sampled in high abundance during this survey. Black Bullhead size and quality in Como Lake is above average when compared to most metro area lakes. The majority of the Black Bullheads ranged in size from 7.5 to 9.5 inches. Other species sampled in low abundance during this survey included Yellow Perch, Pumpkinseed and Hybrid sunfish and golden Shiners. <br> \n</p>",

The present fish population is a result of natural reproduction from fish stocked by unknown persons following a severe winterkill which occured the winter of 1972-73; as indicated by the ages of various species found.  Green sunfish and black crappie are present in numbers and weight above the statewide median.  Black crappie are exceptionally abundant and appear to consist of year classes of I+, II+, and III+ fish.  These fish all exhibit very fast growth.  Three fish measuring 4.1, 4.2, and 4.3 inches long were determined to be young of the year.  Black bullhead and hybrid sunfish are present in numbers above the statewide median but below it in pounds per set.  Black bullhead do not appear to be overpopulated judging from the numbers caught and the length frequency distribution.  Goldfish are present in numbers below the local median but above the local median in pounds per set.  (Note: the local median is based on catches from only three lakes).  Pumkin seed are below the median number and pounds per set.  Fish aged were I and II annulus fish showing fast growth.</p>",

These fish ranged from 8 to 16 inches long and averaged 10.5 inches.  Only two fish were over 12 inches long and only one over 16 inches.  Bluegill were the most abundant fish sampled.  Size of bluegill is improved from previous years with over 25% being 6 inches or longer and 5% being at least 7 inches long.  1996 is the first time since 1988 that bluegill over 7 inches long have been sampled, when 1% were at least 7 inches long.  Moderate numbers of black crappie are present with most less than 7 inches long, but over 10% 8 inches or longer.  Northern pike were sampled for the first time in Como Lake with five fish between 24 and 28 inches long.  The yellow perch populaton is up, but are present in only moderate numbers. Lengths of perch ranged from 6.5 to 9 inches.  A few walleye remain from the 1986 stocking.  Two were captured - these were both between 22 and 23 inches long.  Small channel catfish yearlings were stocked in early July of 1996 - two of these were captured.  Other species caught in low numbers were black bullhead, hybrid sunfish, white sucker, and golden shiner.  </p>",
