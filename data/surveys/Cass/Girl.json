                "narrative": "<p>A temperature-dissolved oxygen profile was collected in the deepest basin on Girl Lake on August 3rd, 2022, to evaluate the amount of cold, oxygenated water (i.e., oxythermal habitat) available to Cisco, also known as Tullibee. Based on the profile, the top of the thermocline (i.e., the location in the water column with the sharpest transition from warm to cold water) occurred at approximately 20 feet. Dissolved oxygen decreased to below 3.0 mg/L at 22.4 feet, which was within the thermocline, at the time of sampling. The temperature at which dissolved oxygen decreased to below 3.0 mg/L (i.e., TDO3, a single variable to characterize oxythermal habitat) was 19.5?C (67.1?F). <br> \n <br> \nTDO3 values near 21.5?C indicate that oxythermal conditions are marginal for Cisco. Dissolved oxygen concentrations near the thermocline indicate that oxythermal habitat was adequate for Cisco at limited depths at the time of sampling during the summer of 2022. However, low dissolved oxygen concentrations (i.e., less than 3 mg/L) below the thermocline and warm surface temperatures would likely limit available Cisco habitat within the water column to an extent. Data collected in 1987-2007 further indicate marginal oxythermal habitat in most years, with the least favorable conditions recorded in 2002. When inadequate oxythermal habitat is available, Cisco are squeezed into unfavorable, warmer water conditions and experience higher levels of stress.</p>",

THE RELATIVELY HIGH 1974 WALLEYE CATCH RATE MAY NOT BE ACCURATE BECAUSE ONLY THREE GILL- NETS SETS WERE MADE IN THAT SURVEY. MOST WALLEYE TAKEN IN THE 1987 SURVEY WERE IN THE 17-20 INCH RANGE. NO WALLEYE FROM THE 1983 OR 1984 YEAR CLASSES WERE TAKEN IN THE 1987 SURVEY, THOUGH WALLEYE FINGERLINGS WERE STOCKED IN 1984. COMPAR- ING SCALE AGING INFORMATION FROM 1987 PREVIOUS SURVEYS WITH STOCKING RECORDS, IT DOES NOT APPEAR THAT WALLEYE FINGERLING STOCKING IS CONTRIBUTING TO GIRL LAKE'S WALLEYE POPULATION. THE SUCCESS OF FRY STOCKING HAS NOT DETERMINED YET BECAUSE FRY WERE STOCKED IN ONLY ONE YEAR PRIOR TO 1987. BOTH THE CATCH RATE AND AVEAGE SIZE OF NORTHERN PIKE WAS SLIGHTLY HIGHER THAN IN PREVIOUS SURVEYS. THE GROWTH RATE OF NORTHERNS WAS GOOD. CATCHES OF YELLOW PERCH HAVE BEEN QUITE VARIABLE FROM ONE SURVEY TO THE NEXT. THE 1987 GILLNET CATCH RATE OF 5/NET IS LOW COMPARED TO THE LOCAL MEDIAN OF 13.2/NET. PERCH TAKEN IN THE 1987 SURVEY WERE SMALLER THAN MOST ANGLERS WILL KEEP. TRAPNET CATCHES OF BLUEGILLS HAVE ALSO BEEN QUITE VARIABLE AND NO TREND IN ABUNDANCE IS APPARENT. VERY  FEW OF THE BLUEGILLS MEASURED WERE 7 INCHES OR MORE IN LENGTH. JUST ONE LARGEMOUTH BASS WAS TAKEN IN TRAPNETS DURING THE 1987 SURVEY, RESULTING IN AN AVERAGE CATCH RATE OF 0.12 LARGEMOUTH BASS/NET. TRAPNET CATCHES IN PREVIOUS SURVEYS RANGED FROM 2.2 TO 3.4 NET. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT TRAPNET CATCHES OF LARGE- MOUTH WERE LOW BECAUSE OF UNUSUALLY WARM SURFACE WATER TEMPERATURES NEAR SHORE. IN THE FUTURE, ELECTROFISHING COULD PROVIDE A BETTER INDEX OF THE LARGEMOUTH POPULATION IN GIRL LAKE.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Girl Lake is 406-acre lake located near Longville, MN.  With a maximum depth of 81 feet, approximately 67% of the lake is less than 15 feet deep.  A city owned public access is located on the east side of the lake in Longville.  The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MNDNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different classes based on physical, chemical and other characteristics.  Girl Lake is in Lake Class 25; lakes in this class are generally deep, clear, and irregular shaped.  This lake is primarily managed for northern pike, largemouth bass, and black crappie, and secondarily for cisco, muskellunge, bluegill, yellow perch, and walleye. Northern pike were abundant, but most of them were below 20 inches.  Beginning in May 2003, no northern pike from 24 to 36 inches may be kept in Girl, Woman, Little Woman or Child Lakes.  This \"protected slot limit\" regulation is intended to help increase the number of larger northern pike in these waters.  The largest northern pike captured was 27 inches and the mean length was 18 inches.  Another common fish species sampled in this survey was walleye.  Length ranged from 13 to 27 inches and the mean length was 19.  Several year classes are present which will provide some angling opportunities for future years.  Few bluegill and black crappie were sampled, but individuals up to nine inches were found.  Largemouth bass provide good angling in Girl Lake.  Other fish species that are available to catch are bowfin, brown bullhead, pumpkinseed sunfish, rock bass, cisco (tullibee), white sucker, and yellow bullhead.  Muskellunge are occasionally caught by anglers.    Anglers can help maintain or improve the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for table fare, but encourages release of medium- to large-sized fish.  Releasing these fish can help maintain balance in the fish community in Girl Lake and provide anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future.  Shoreline areas on the land and into the shallow water provide essential habitat for fish and wildlife that live in or near Minnesota's lakes.  Overdeveloped shorelines can't support the fish, wildlife, and clean water that are associated with natural undeveloped lakes. The combined effects of all lakeshore owners \"fixing up\" their property can destroy a lake's valuable natural shorelines.Shoreline habitat consists of aquatic plants, woody plants and natural lake bottom soils.  Plants in the water and at the water's edge provide habitat, prevent erosion and absorb excess nutrients. Shrubs, trees, and woody debris such as fallen trees or limbs provide good habitat both above and below the water and should be left in place.  Natural lake bottom materials like silt or gravel are more ecologically productive than pure sand trucked in for a swimming beach.  A tidy lawn and a sandy beach make great spots for sunbathing and swimming but do little to provide habitat for fish and wildlife. By leaving a buffer strip of natural vegetation along the shoreline, property owners can reduce erosion, help maintain water quality, and provide habitat and travel corridors for wildlife.Only if more lakeshore owners manage their shoreline in a natural condition can fish and wildlife populations on Minnesota lakes remain healthy and abundant.  More specific information on protecting or restoring shorelines and watersheds is available through the local DNR Fisheries office.</p>",

Sixty four percent of the lake is 15 feet deep or less. The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different lake classes based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics. Girl Lake is in Lake Class 25. Lakes in this class are medium sized, moderately deep, irregularly shaped, and clear. Similar Lake Class 25 lakes in the Walker area include Birch, Blackwater, Inguadona, and Long (near Longville, MN).  A city owned public access is located on the east side of the lake in Longville. The purpose of this survey was to assess the status of Largemouth and Smallmouth bass populations in Girl Lake. <br> \n <br> \nThis survey indicated that Largemouth Bass were moderately abundant with most fish shorter than 15 inches long. The average length of the sample was 12 inches and fish up to 18 inches long were sampled. No Smallmouth Bass were sampled even though they are relatively abundant in Woman Lake, which is directly connected to Girl Lake through the Boy River. <br> \n <br> \nPeople can have significant impacts on lakes and the fish populations they support.  Harvest, lakeshore development, removal of shoreline vegetation, and introductions of invasive species can all adversely affect fish populations.  Currently the aquatic invasive species (AIS) that have been identified in Girl Lake are the rusty crayfish, purple loosestrife, Eurasian watermilfoil and curly leaf pondweed.  AIS are moved from infested to non-infested waters by anglers, boaters, and lake shore owners and can adversely impact lakes and fish populations.  To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access.  If you suspect an infestation of an invasive species in this lake, save a specimen and report it to a local natural resource office.  Additional information on all of these topics can be found on the DNR website (www.dnr.state.mn.us) or by contacting the Walker Area Fisheries office. <br> \n</p>",

Dissolved oxygen decreased to below 3.0 mg/L at 27.3 feet, which was below the thermocline, at the time of sampling. The temperature at which dissolved oxygen decreased to below 3.0 mg/L (i.e., TDO3, a single variable to characterize oxythermal habitat) was 9.3?C (48.7?F). <br> \n <br> \nTDO3 values cooler than 21.5?C for Cisco indicate that oxythermal conditions are favorable for these species. Dissolved oxygen concentrations below the thermocline indicate that suitable oxythermal habitat for these species was available across a range of depths at the time of sampling. Data collected in 1992, 1997, 2002, 2004, and 2007 also indicated suitable oxythermal habitat.

                "narrative": "<p>Girl Lake is a 406-acre lake located near Longville, Minnesota. Girl Lake has 9.36 miles of shoreline, and a maximum depth of 81 feet. Sixty-seven percent of the lake is 15 feet deep or less. The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources has classified Minnesota\u0019s lakes into 43 different lake classes based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics. Girl Lake is in Lake Class 25. Lakes in this class are medium sized, moderately deep, irregularly shaped, and clear. A city owned public access is located on the east side of the lake in Longville. <br> \n <br> \nGirl Lake offers good opportunities for anglers seeking a variety of species.  The average length of northern pike sampled in the 2007 survey was 18 inches and the lengths ranged from 7 to 33 inches. A 24- to 36-inch protected slot regulation on northern pike was implemented in 2003 with the objective of increasing the percentage of northern pike 24 inches or greater in Girl, Woman, Child, and Little Woman Lakes. The percentage of northern pike 24 inches or greater in length increased from 5 percent in the 2002 assessment to 16 percent in the 2007 assessment.  Largemouth bass are present in the Girl Lake. Twenty-six largemouth bass were sampled and the lengths ranged from 5 to 15 inches. Black crappie were moderately abundant with fish greater than 10 inches in length present. Black crappie average length was 6 inches and the lengths ranged from 5 to 13 inches. Muskellunge are present in Girl Lake but little is known of the abundance and size structure of the population. There is a 48-inch minimum length regulation on the lake.  Bluegill sampled in spring trap netting had an average length of near 7 inches and the lengths ranged from 4 to 9 inches. Yellow perch were not very abundant in the 2007 sampling. However, yellow perch over 10 inches in length were sampled in Girl Lake.  Walleye abundance was low but average length was 19 inches and the lengths ranged from 13 to 26 inches.   Other species sampled were black bullhead, bowfin (dogfish), brown bullhead, pumpkinseed sunfish, rock bass, tullibee (cisco), yellow bullhead, and white sucker. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers can help maintain or improve the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for table fare, but encourages release of medium- to large-sized fish.  Releasing these fish can help maintain balance in the fish community in Girl Lake and provide anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future.   <br> \n <br> \nShoreline areas on the land and into the shallow water provide essential habitat for fish and wildlife that live in or near Minnesota\u0019s lakes.  Overdeveloped shorelines can\u0019t support the fish, wildlife, and clean water that are associated with natural undeveloped lakes.  Shoreline habitat consists of aquatic plants, woody plants and natural lake bottom soils.  Plants in the water and at the water\u0019s edge provide habitat, prevent erosion and absorb excess nutrients. Shrubs, trees, and woody debris such as fallen trees or limbs provide good habitat both above and below the water and should be left in place.  By leaving a buffer strip of natural vegetation along the shoreline, property owners can reduce erosion, help maintain water quality, and provide habitat and travel corridors for wildlife. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Girl Lake is a 406 acre lake located near Longville, Minnesota. Girl Lake has 9.36 miles of shoreline, and a maximum depth of 81 feet. Sixty seven percent of the lake is 15 feet deep or less. The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different lake classes based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics. Girl Lake is in Lake Class 25. Lakes in this class are medium sized, moderately deep, irregularly shaped, and clear. A city owned public access is located on the east side of the lake in Longville. <br> \nGirl Lake offers good opportunities for anglers seeking a variety of species.  The average length of northern pike sampled in the 2012 survey was 17 inches and the lengths ranged from 10 to 33 inches. A 24 to 36 inch protected slot regulation on northern pike was implemented in 2003 with the objective of increasing the percentage of northern pike 24 inches or longer in the Woman Lake chain (Child, Girl, and Woman lakes). Pike catch rates were the highest observed but lengths in Girl Lake were still below the management goal.   Largemouth bass are present in Girl Lake with sizes in the 2012 sample ranging from 7 to 16 inches. Black crappies numbers are average for similar area lakes with fish greater than 10 inches in length present. Black crappie average length was 7 inches and the lengths ranged from 5 to 12 inches. A low-abundance but high size quality muskellunge population is present in the Woman Lake chain.  Bluegill sampled in summer netting had an average length of 6 inches with lengths ranging from 3 to 9 inches. Yellow perch numbers have increased in Girl Lake with fish averaging just over 7 inches in length.  Walleye abundance was low but lengths ranged from 13 to 26 inches.   Other species sampled were black bullhead, bowfin (dogfish), brown bullhead, burbot, pumpkinseed sunfish, rock bass, tullibee (cisco), yellow bullhead, and white sucker. <br> \nPeople can have significant impacts on lakes and the fish populations they support.  Harvest, lakeshore development, removal of shoreline vegetation, and introductions of invasive species can all adversely affect fish populations.  Currently the aquatic invasive species (AIS) that have been identified in Girl Lake are the rusty crayfish, purple loosestrife and curly leaf pondweed.  AIS are moved from infested to non-infested waters by anglers, boaters, and lake shore owners and can adversely impact lakes and fish populations.  To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access.  If you suspect an infestation of an invasive species in this lake, save a specimen and report it to a local natural resource office.  Additional information on all of these topics can be found on the DNR website (www.dnr.state.mn.us) or by contacting the Walker Area Fisheries office. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Girl Lake is a 406-acre lake with a maximum depth of 81 feet.  It is located adjacent to the town of Longville.  The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different lake classes based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics.  Girl Lake is in lake class 25.  Approximately 67% of the lake is 15 feet or less.  There is a city-owned public access on the east end of the lake in the town of Longville.Northern pike abundance was the highest of any surveys conducted on Girl Lake.  It was also higher than what is typically found in lakes in lake class 25.  This increase was from the successful natural reproduction that occurred in 1994 and 1995.  There is probable migration between Girl and Woman Lakes.  Fish ranged in length from 11 to 31 inches with an average length and weight of 18.5 inches and 1.4 pounds.  Growth was typical of other lake class 25 lakes.  At five years old, Girl Lake northern pikes are 25 inches long.Girl Lake is known for largemouth bass, black crappie, bluegill, and northern pike fishing.  There is also angling for walleye and muskellunge.  There is a broad connection between Girl and Woman Lakes which allows movement of fish between the two lakes.Walleye abundance was typical of past surveys and of other lake class 25 lakes.  Fish sampled ranged in length from four to 27 inches with an average length and weight of 16 inches and 1.65 pounds.  No stocking of walleye has occurred since 1993.  There has been little to no success from stocking.  There are ample areas for walleye to spawn in Girl Lake.  A tagging study conducted in 1996 and 1997 shows that walleye does move from Woman Lake to Girl Lake.  Bluegill abundance was down from the 1992 survey.  Fish sampled  ranged in length from 3.5 to 7.3 inches with an average length and weight of 4.9 inches and 0.1 pounds.  The quality of bluegill improved in 1997.  Inventory of shoal water areas rated centrarchid spawning habitat as good.  There has been much development occurring on Girl Lake.  The number of homes/cabins has tripled since 1956.  This development is probably starting to impact spawning habitat and nursery areas for different species of fish.  Growth was slow with bluegill averaging 4.3 inches at five years old.  Typically bluegills are 5.1 inches at five years old in other lake class 25 lakes.A total of 13 largemouth bass were sampled when combining all sampling gear.   Fish ranged in length from five to 16 inches with an average length and weight of 10.0 inches and 0.7 pounds.  There were four different ages (year classes) present in the sampled fish.  Growth was typical of other area lakes lake class 25.  A total of 12 black crappie were sampled with five being of stocked length.  Fish ranged in length from 4.4 to 11.3 inches.  There were four ages present in the sample.  Yellow perch and cisco (tullibee) are two fish sampled in the survey and are utilized as food fish by predator fish.  One muskellunge was sampled that was 26.7 inches long. Other fish sampled were: bowfin, pumpkinseed sunfish, rock bass, yellow bullhead, brown bullhead, and white sucker.Girl is one of the most desirable lakes in the Longville area to live on.  There is concern that this demand and development may be impacting the aquatic habitat.  Since 1956, the number of lakehomes on the lake has increased from 64 to 186.  Activities such as bulrush removal and adding sand to the shoreline has impacted habitats for several kinds of fish at different stages of their life cycles. To help maintain quality fish populations in Girl Lake, lake users should safeguard aquatic habitat by preserving or reestablishing aquatic plants and natural shorelines.  Aquatic andterrestrial plants provide food and cover for fish and wildlife.  They also help protect shorelinesfrom erosion, and absorb nutrients and pollutants.  Natural shorelines, shorelines that have notbeen altered by man, help protect a lake from silt-laden runoff water.  They also provide excellent places for wildlife to feed, hide, and raise their young.  Protection of the largerwatershed that drains into Girl Lake is also needed for maintaining water quality.Anglers can help maintain or improve the quality fishing by practicing catch and release of medium to large-sized fish.  Findings from creel surveys on Ten Mile, Pine Mountain, and Woman Lake, where anglers were interviewed, found that only 22% of the walleye 20 inches or longer were released.  Releasing these fish will help maintain the quality of the fish population and provide anglers with more opportunities to catch more large fish in the future.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of nearshore fish species in Girl Lake was conducted on June 21-23, 2021, by Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program staff. Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake, and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at all 10 sampling stations, but one station was sampled from the boat due to site conditions. Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample five stations, a 15-foot seine was used to sample three stations, and site conditions prevented the use of a seine at two stations. Nearshore sampling captured 22 species of fish including eight species that are intolerant of disturbance (i.e., Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, Mimic Shiner, Pugnose Shiner, Rock Bass, and Smallmouth Bass) and two that are tolerant of disturbance (i.e., Fathead Minnow and Green Sunfish). <br> \n <br> \nA concurrent summer trap net survey was also conducted by IBI Program staff. Nine trap nets were set along the shoreline in locations that encompassed multiple habitat types. Trap net sampling captured 10 species of fish, including one that is intolerant of disturbance (i.e., Rock Bass). Bluegill, Yellow Bullhead, and Pumpkinseed comprised a majority of the catch by number, whereas Bowfin, Yellow Bullhead, and Bluegill comprised a majority by biomass. <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore and trap net data were combined with gill net data from a September 2020 survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based IBI (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment. In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g., Blackchin Shiner, Iowa Darter, and Rock Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g., Fathead Minnow and Green Sunfish). The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.  <br> \n <br> \nResults from this survey indicate that the fish community in Girl Lake is healthy as indicated by an FIBI score above the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes. These results will be considered when the biological health of the lake is assessed during the Leech Lake River Watershed assessment process, which will be completed in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Girl Lake is a 428-acre lake located near Longville, Minnesota. Girl Lake has 9.36 miles of shoreline, and a maximum depth of 81 feet. Sixty-four percent of the lake is 15 feet deep or less. A city owned public access is located on the east side of the lake in Longville. The Boy River connects Girl Lake to Woman, Little Woman, and Child lakes. There are no barriers to fish movement between these lakes. The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different lake classes based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics. Girl Lake is in Lake Class 25. Lakes in this class are medium sized, moderately deep, irregularly shaped, and clear. Other Class 25 lakes in the Walker area include Birch (DOW# 11-0143), Blackwater (DOW# 11-0274), Inguadona (DOW# 11-0120), and Long (DOW# 11-0142). The lake is primarily managed for Bluegill, Black Crappie, Largemouth Bass, Northern Pike, Walleye, and Yellow Perch and secondarily for Muskellunge and Tullibee (Cisco).  A 24 to 36 inch protected slot regulation on Northern Pike was implemented in 2003 with the objective of increasing the percentage of northern pike 24 inches or longer in the Woman Lake chain (Child, Girl, Little Woman, and Woman lakes). The purpose of this survey was to evaluate Walleye stocking and the status of Northern Pike, Walleye, and Yellow Perch populations. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike are abundant in Girl Lake.  Northern Pike gill net catch rates have come down from the record gill catch rate of over 18 fish per gill net in 2012 to near nine per gill net in 2020, which was within management goal of five to ten fish per net.  Northern Pike averaged 18 inches long and lengths ranged from 10 to 33 inches. The percentage of Northern Pike 24 inches long or larger has increased since the protected slot was implemented in 2003. In 2020, ten percent of the Northern Pike sampled were over 24 inches long, which was below the management goal of 14 percent. Walleyes were of moderate abundance compared to other Lake Class 25 lakes. The Walleye gill net catch rate was below the management goal of four fish per gill net and have not met management goals since 1974. Walleye stocking has not significantly increased Walleye abundance and additional surveys are planned to evaluate the effectiveness of Walleye fry stocking that began in 2016. Walleye average length was 20 inches and lengths ranged from 14 to 24 inches. Yellow Perch numbers were below the management goal of five fish per gill net. All the sampled Yellow Perch were less than ten inches long. Good numbers of Black Crappie were sampled and averaged 8 inches long and lengths ranged from 5 to 11 inches. Bluegill averaged 6 inches long and ranged from 3 to 9 inches. Though this survey did not effectively sample Largemouth Bass and no fish in the sample were greater than 15 inches long, fish up to 20 inches long have been sampled in previous surveys.  Low numbers of Muskellunge (Muskie) are present in the Woman Lake chain. A Muskie over 50 inches long was sampled in the spring of 2016 from Girl Lake. A single 34 inch Muskie was sampled in this assessment. Other species sampled were Brown Bullhead, Pumpkinseed Sunfish, Rock Bass, Tullibee (Cisco), Yellow Bullhead, and White Sucker. <br> \n <br> \nPeople can have significant impacts on lakes and the fish populations they support.  Harvest, lakeshore development, removal of shoreline vegetation, and introductions of invasive species can all adversely affect fish populations.  Currently the aquatic invasive species (AIS) identified in Girl Lake are Rusty Crayfish, Purple Loosestrife, Curly-leaf Pondweed, and Eurasian Watermilfoil.  AIS are moved from infested to non-infested waters by anglers, boaters, and lake shore owners and can adversely impact lakes and fish populations.  To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access.  If you suspect an infestation of an invasive species in this lake, save a specimen and report it to a local natural resource office.  Additional information on all of these topics can be found on the DNR website (www.dnr.state.mn.us) or by contacting the Walker Area Fisheries office. <br> \n</p>",
