                "narrative": "<p>Slip Lake is one of a chain of small lakes lying on the Poplar River below Crescent Lake and above Rice Lake.  The lake was last surveyed in 1976, when it was found to support walleye, northern pike, yellow perch, and white sucker.   Since 1976 smallmouth bass and muskellunge have become established in the upper Poplar River watershed.  This assessment was scheduled in the 2012 lake management plan to update information available on the fish community in Slip Lake, and to determine whether it still supported adequate walleye and northern pike populations.  <br> \n <br> \nThe 2014 assessment collected muskellunge, northern pike, smallmouth bass, walleye, white sucker, and yellow perch in gill nets, and pumpkinseed sunfish and yellow perch in minnow traps (no fish were taken in minnow traps used in 1976).  Too few net sets were made in 1976 and 2014 to allow comparisons between catches; however, it was clear that despite the added presence of muskellunge and smallmouth bass, all major species collected in 1976 were still present in 2014. <br> \n <br> \nSlip Lake appeared to support adequate numbers (and sizes) of walleye in 2014.  The walleye gill net catch was within the normal range for a lake of this class, and walleye taken in gill nets ranged in length from 8.2 to 21.8 inches.  Five year classes, all naturally produced, were included in the catch, indicating consistent reproductive success or constant steady replenishment from populations upstream in the watershed. <br> \n <br> \nNeither northern pike or muskellunge appeared to have been abundant.  Catches consisted of a single fish of each species.  Muskellunge in all lakes in this watershed are entirely self-sustained.  They were originally introduced in Crescent Lake in the late 1970s, but have not been stocked since.  Muskellunge in this system are all descendants of Shoepack-strain fish, and so have limited trophy potential.  No muskellunge larger than 45 inches have ever been sampled or reported in any lake in this watershed. <br> \n <br> \nThe smallmouth bass gill net catch was high for a lake of this class.  Fish ranged in length from 7.7 to 15.4 inches, with most over 12 inches.  Growth of young bass appeared to have been about average for this area; fish reached a mean length of 5.8 inches by the end of their second year, compared to an area average of 5.2 inches. <br> \n <br> \nEnough yellow perch and small white sucker were present in 2014 to provide adequate forage for walleye, northern pike, and muskellunge.  Most of the yellow perch collected were too small to have been of interest to anglers.  No adult pumpkinseed sunfish were collected, but their presence was indicated by the capture of 24 young-of-year fish in minnow traps. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",
