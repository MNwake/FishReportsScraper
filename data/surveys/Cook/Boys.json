All the brook trout captured were from the 1993 and 1994 stockings, and survival of those stockings seemed to have been good.  Brook trout growth was about average for the area.An experimental regulation will be implemented on Boys Lake, beginning May 11, 1996.  The regulation is: possession limit of two brook trout, minimum size of 14 inches, artificial lures or flies with a single hook only, and closed to winter fishing.  The regulation is expected to increase the number of anglers who catch fish over 14 inches, while providing good catch-and-release fishing for 12-14 inch fish.</p>",

Yellow perch had been reported by anglers in Mink and Kimball Lakes, downstream of Boys Lake, in 2008, and were found in both lakes in fairly high numbers in assessments done in late summer 2009. <br> \n <br> \nNo yellow perch were found in Boys Lake, in gill nets or in minnow trap sets, although their presence cannot be ruled out on the basis of this assessment.  Fish have been able to move into Boys Lake from Mink Lake in the past, and a few yellow perch may have already reached Boys lake. <br> \n <br> \nBrook trout were abundant, but small, in Boys Lake.  Their presence at all was a surprise, since no brook trout had been stocked in the lake (or any connected or nearby lakes) since 2006.  The 2009 catch consisted mainly of one- and two-year-old fish that had apparently been naturally produced.  Growth had been slow.  Two-year-old fish reached an average length of just 8.5 inches by the end of their second year. <br> \n <br> \nNo rainbow trout were taken, despite the stocking of fingerlings in 2007 and 2008.  Although rainbow trout can be difficult to catch in standard gill nets, the failure to catch any would be unusual in a successfully stocked lake.  Survival of both stockings must be assumed to have been very poor. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Boys Lake has been managed for stream trout since at least 1950, and was last rehabilitated in the fall of 2014.  The management goal for this lake, established in the 2015 lake management plan revision, is to maintain a Brook Trout population with a minimum gill net catch of 1.5 fish/set, with some fish over 12 inches in length present.  This was the first survey of this lake to be done since it was rehabilitated.  It was also the first of two surveys scheduled in the 2015 plan to determine whether Brook Trout performance was limited by marginal summer water temperatures, and to identify any Brook Trout natural reproduction.  At the time the lake was rehabilitated, it supported a natural Brook Trout population. <br> \n <br> \nBrook Trout numbers were apparently very high in the fall of 2018, and many fish over 12 inches in length (up to 17.4 inches) were present.  The gill net catch in this survey exceeded the plan goal by a wide margin, and was well above the normal range for a fall survey of a stream trout lake in this area (1.3-14.0 fish/set).  All three stocked year classes were represented in the catch.  Growth of older Brook Trout had been somewhat slower than average, with fish reaching a mean length of 11.3 inches by the end of their third year, compared to an area mean of 12.7 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nThe Brook Trout catch included two fish that appeared to have been two-year-olds.  If the aging was correct, those fish were either produced naturally or they were Splake that had moved into the lake from Mink Lake and were misidentified as Brook Trout.  <br> \n <br> \nThe 2018 catch included at least two Splake that would have been stocked in Mink Lake.  It is possible that more were included in the Brook Trout catch, because the crew was not expecting to see Splake, and may have identified some as Brook Trout before they realized Splake were present.  Splake movement into Boys Lake has been observed in the past. <br> \n <br> \nNo undesirable fish species were observed in the catch.  Boys Lake was rehabilitated to remove a dense Yellow Perch population, and it appeared that effort had been successful.  However, the rehabilitation should also have eliminated minnows from the lake, yet several species were collected in minnow trap set during this survey. <br> \n <br> \nTrout in this lake depend on surface waters remaining cool through the summer, since the lake is shallow and lacks any deeper waters capable of providing cold-water habitat.   A temperature-oxygen profile measured on 23 August found conditions suitable for Brook Trout (water temperature <= 68 F, dissolved oxygen > 5 ppm) at depths of two to eight feet, with no deeper waters found.  Surface water temperatures in the area had already been cooling for some time prior to 23 August, so conditions may have been more stressful earlier in the summer. <br> \n </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>This assessment was done in cooperation with Cook County water planning staff, as part of a water quality study on Mink, Kimball, and Boys Lakes.  It was also done to monitor performance of stocked trout, and to determine whether yellow perch or rock bass had become established in Boys Lake. <br> \n <br> \nBoys Lake lies at the head of the Kimball Creek watershed,above Mink and Kimball Lakes.  Yellow perch were reported by anglers in Mink and Kimball Lakes in 2008, and were found in both lakes in fairly high numbers in assessments done in late summer 2009.  In addition rock bass were found in Kimball Lake in 2009.  By 2013, both species were abundant in both lakes. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch were apparently abundant in Boys Lake in 2013.  The gill net catch was above average for the lake class, and many small yellow perch were taken in minnow traps.  Yellow perch may have provided some angling opportunities, since the gill net catch included fish as large as 12 inches in length.      <br> \n <br> \nNo rainbow trout from any recent stockings were collected in 2013.  There should have been fair numbers of fish from the 2011 stocking present, but none were taken.  It appears that all stockings of rainbow trout in this lake since 2007 failed. <br> \n <br> \nAlthough none have been stocked in this lake since 2006, the 2013 assessment, like the 2009 assessment, captured fairly high numbers of brook trout.  The 2013 gill net catch exceeded the median (6.00 fish/set) for fall assessments of stream trout lakes in this area.  Four year classes were represented in the catch, and all must have been naturally produced.  Growth appeared to have been about average for the area, despite the presence of large numbers of yellow perch.  Two-year-old brook trout reached an average length of 9.4 inches by the end of their second year. <br> \n <br> \nBrook trout in Boys Lake must have been produced in or upstream of that lake, or have migrated to the lake from Kimball Creek.  No brook trout have been stocked in any lakes connected to, or near, Boys Lake since 2006.  There is a resident brook trout population in Kimball Creek, in areas below Kimball Lake and between Mink and Kimball Lakes, but brook trout have rarely been seen in Kimball or Mink Lakes (unless stocked).  Regular stocking of Boys Lake with brook trout would have masked any evidence for prior movement of brook trout from Kimball Creek into the lake; however, if they've rarely been seen in Mink Lake, it seems unlikely that much higher numbers of brook trout would have moved all the way upstream into Boys Lake.   <br> \n <br> \nNatural reproduction, in Boys Lake or in one of its small inlets, may have occurred. There are known to be some springs in the north end of Boys Lake.  Three inlets were identified in the 1974 survey; two were spring fed and one of those had some gravel present.  Inlets to Boys Lake were examined in 2013, and temperature monitors were placed in the only two flowing inlets found (both in the NW corner of the lake.  Flows in both inlets were low, but cool water temperatures in one suggested it was probably fed by springs or cool seeps.  However, neither inlet seemed to provide any spawning habitat for brook trout (no gravel).  <br> \n <br> \nA temperature-oxygen profile obtained in Boys Lake on 27 August 2013 found conditions at the surface that may have been lethal for brook trout, while conditions at all depths would have been stressfully warm.  Temperature monitors were deployed in Boys Lake, at depths of 1.7 and 6.6 feet above the bottom, from February 2013 through October 2013.  Water temperatures that would have been stressful for brook trout (over 68 F) were recorded by the deeper of the two monitors during two prolonged periods:  over the first two-thirds of July and the last half of August.  Although temperatures were warmer near the surface (6.6 feet above the bottom), and periods of stressful conditions slightly longer, periods of potentially lethal temperatures were brief.  Conditions in the lake appeared to have improved rapidly after 27 August.  Relatively high brook trout catches seen in this September assessment indicated that brook trout were able to survive the warm lake conditions measured in 2013.  <br> \n <br> \nBoys Lake is scheduled to be rehabilitated for stream trout management in the fall of 2014, with the goal of eliminating yellow perch.  All fish present at that time would be killed, and the lake would be restocked beginning in the spring or fall of 2015. <br> \n</p>",

However, the spring 1998 population estimate for brook trout (101 fish, not including most age-1 fish) was below normal for stream trout lakes in the area.  A few fish over 14 inches were present in October 1998, indicating that they were not all cropped off as they grew over the minimum size limit (for this lake) of 14 inches.  Growth rates for brook trout collected in 1998 had been slow for the area.</p>",
