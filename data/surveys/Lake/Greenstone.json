                "narrative": "<p>Greenstone Lake is very typical of lakes in Ecological Lake Class 3, which consists of 72 lakes in northeast Minnesota that are average in size, deep, have irregular shoreline shapes, and have very clear and soft water.  The water column in Greenstone Lake stratifies in midsummer and, typical of very clear lakes, has a broad thermocline - the region where the water temperature changes from warm to cold.  Generally, there is good oxygen (at least 2 ppm) to a depth of 45 ft, where the water temperature is about 45 F.This assessment, like most of the seven previous surveys and assessments dating back to 1964, consisted of gillnets set in mostly shallow water, but ranging down to about 40 ft.  Trapnets, usually a part of fisheries assessments, have not been set in Greenstone Lake due to the difficult access.Fish populations in 1996, as in previous surveys and assessments, were dominated by walleye and northern pike.Walleye numbers in 1996 were in the normal range for this lake class and were near the long term average for this lake.  Walleye averaged 16 in, which is normal for this lake class, but is larger than the long term average of 15 in for this lake.  The largest walleye caught in this assessment was 25 in.  Walleye sizes in this lake class tend to be large.  Walleye growth, 15 in at age four, was faster than average for the area.  Many of the walleye (34 percent) were from a strong 1994 year class.  A weak year class was produced in 1993; other years had low, but fairly even reproduction.  Recently, walleye fry were stocked in 1989, 1990, 1993 and 1996 (one year of every three since 1990).Northern pike numbers in 1996 were in the normal range for this lake class, and were near the long term average for this lake.  Pike sizes averaged 21 in, which is small for this lake class, but near the long term average of 22 in for this lake.  The largest pike caught in this assessment was 30 in.  Pike sizes in this lake class tend to be large, probably due to good populations of cisco.  Pike growth, 21 in at age three, was faster than normal for the area.  Most of the pike (56 percent) were age two, from a strong 1994 year class.  All pike were ages one through four.Also present in 1996 were low numbers of bluegill sunfish, largemouth bass, rock bass, white sucker, and yellow perch.  Cisco were captured in the 1976 assessment only, and may still be present in the deeper waters.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Greenstone Lake is located 10 miles east of Ely.  There are four accesses that are all remote carry-ins. There is no ramp on this lake.  Accesses consist of a 3/4 mile portage from Madden Lake, a 1/2 mile portage from the North Kawishiwi River, a winter snowmobile route to Pickerel Lake, and the trail system off the Madden Creek Rd.  This 332 acre lake contains three inlets, all on the east side (small creeks from the north and from the east drain wetlands, and the Conchu Lake Outlet) and one major outlet, the Greenstone Lake Outlet which flows to Pickerel Lake.  Greenstone Lake has a maximum depth of 72 feet and the water color at the time of this survey was light brown. \n\nOn August 11, 2014 Greenstone was thermally stratified with a surface temperature of 74F and a bottom temperature of 43F.  Oxygen levels were adequate to a depth of 62 feet.  Lake bottom substrates along the shoreline of Greenstone Lake are mostly boulder and rubble.  Aquatic plants are sparse and only grow in some of the shallow bays.  There are a handful of water access only cabins on the lake, overall it is quite undeveloped.  \n\nThe overall gillnet catch rate for all fish combined was 10.9 fish/net which is average compared to historic surveys.  Total yield was 14.5 lbs/net which is slightly below average.  Fish species sampled in gill nets were walleye, northern pike, yellow perch, bluegill, white sucker, and rock bass.  \n\nWalleye have been stocked as fry in Greenstone Lake dating back to 1942.  Most recently, around 350,000 fry have been stocked every three years.   \n\nIn the 2014 survey twenty-nine walleye were sampled in gill nets for a catch rate of 3.2 fish/gill net, which is above average compared to other similar lakes.  Fish captured in gill nets ranged in size from 8 to 24 inches with an average of 16 inches.  Average weight per fish was 1.7 pounds which is good compared to other similar lakes.  Growth based off of otolith ages appears to be somewhat slow compared to other walleye populations from lakes in the Tower Management Area.  Ages ranged from 1 to 12 with only two missing year classes (2003 and 2005).  When comparing stocked vs. non-stocked year class strength the stocked classes seem to be outperforming by a fairly wide margin.  Interestingly the oldest year class observed (2002) was tied with two much younger year classes (2011 and 2012) for the strongest representation by a year class in the catch.  \n\nThe northern pike gillnet catch was 1.8 fish/net which is above average compared to other similar lakes but slightly below the lake assessment average.  Average weight was 3.3 lbs/fish which is slightly better than other similar lakes.  Lengths ranged from 20 to 32 inches with an average of 24 inches which is better than the historic average of 23 inches.  \n\nAlthough bluegill are normally not assessed with gill nets, they have been captured on a fairly regular basis in Greenstone. The 2014 catch was 1.6 fish/net which is above the historic average.  Sizes were small with an average of 4.5 inches although this isn't a lot different than the average historic length which is 5 inches.  \n\nFourteen yellow perch were sampled in gill nets for a catch rate of 1.6 fish/net which is above average compared to other similar lakes and past assessments.  Lengths ranged from 6 to 7 inches with an average of 6.5 inches.  These sizes are on par with fish from previous surveys.  \n\nCisco were sampled in only one survey (1976) but the thermal habitat of the lake appears quite suitable.  We set 3 experimental gill nets deep and 3 deep water small mesh gill nets specifically targeting cisco habitat.  No fish were captured in the small mesh nets and only one northern pike and one white sucker were sampled in the deep experimental sets.  In addition to these nets, walleye and pike stomachs were checked for cisco remains, none were found.  \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Greenstone Lake is located 10 miles east of Ely.  There are four accesses that are all remote carry-ins.  Accesses consist of a 3/4 mile portage from Madden Lake, a 1/2 mile portage from the North Kawishiwi River, a winter snowmobile route to Pickerel Lake, and the trail system off the Madden Creek Rd.  This 332 acre lake contains four inlets and one outlet which flows to Pickerel Lake.  Greenstone Lake has a maximum depth of 72 feet and brown bog-stained water.  <br> \n <br> \nOn August 12, 2019 Greenstone was thermally stratified with a surface temperature of 71 F and a bottom temperature of 44 F.  Oxygen levels were adequate for gamefish to a depth of 63 feet where the temperature was 45 F.  Lake bottom substrates along the shoreline of Greenstone Lake are mostly boulder and rubble.  Aquatic plants are sparse and only grow in some of the shallow bays.  There are a handful of water access only cabins on the lake, overall it is quite undeveloped.   <br> \n <br> \nThe overall gillnet catch rate for all fish combined was 9.3 fish/net which was slightly below average for the lake.  Yield was 13.7 lbs/net which was also just below average.  Fish species sampled were walleye, northern pike, bluegill, white sucker, rock bass, yellow perch, and largemouth bass.  Trap nets were used for the first time on Greenstone and caught fish at an overall rate of 11.4 fish/net, yield was 8.3 lbs/net.  Fish species sampled in trap nets were mostly bluegill, northern pike, and walleye.  Smaller numbers of rock bass, largemouth bass, and yellow perch were also sampled.     <br> \n <br> \nWalleye fry are currently being stocked in Greenstone generally every third year.  The 2019 walleye gillnet catch rate was 3.6 fish/net, which was above average compared to other similar lakes and right at average compared to past surveys on the lake.  Lengths ranged from 9 to 24 inches with an average of 17 inches which was good compared to past surveys.  Growth rates were slightly better than average compared to other lakes in the area with a walleye taking four years to reach 14 inches long.  Ages ranged from 1 to 20 with no single exceptional year classes.   <br> \n <br> \nThe northern pike gillnet catch was 1.6 fish/net which was above average compared to other similar lakes but slightly below average compared to past surveys on Greenstone.  The average pike weighed 4 pounds which was good compared to other similar lakes.  Lengths ranged from 20 to 29 inches with an average of nearly 24 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nSixty-four bluegill were caught in trap nets for a catch rate of 7.1 fish/net which was very good compared to other similar lakes.  Sizes were small though, ranging from 3.5 to nearly 6 inches with an average of just over 4 inches.  Over 90% of the fish were under 5 inches long.  This appears to be common for Greenstone as past surveys showed similar small sizes from bluegill caught in gill nets.  <br> \n <br> \nSmall numbers of largemouth bass, yellow perch, rock bass, and white sucker were also sampled.  Their catch rates and sizes were similar to past surveys.     <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Greenstone Lake is very typical of lakes in Ecological Lake Class 3, which consists of 72 lakes in northeast Minnesota that are average in size, deep, have irregular shoreline shapes, and have very clear and soft (unmineralized) water.Greenstone Lake was thermally stratified on 08/13/01 and retained 2 ppm oxygen to a depth of 24 ft, where the temperature was 54 F.  Two inlets drain local swamps, and the outlet to Pickerel Lake has beaver dams which limit fish movement.  Shoal substrates are very rocky, and there is little aquatic vegetation.This fish population assessment, like most of the eight previous investigations on this lake dating back to 1964, consisted of gillnets set in and above the thermocline.  The number of gillnets set has ranged from 3 to 12, and the assessment dates have ranged from July 16 to October 11, but most have been in late July or early August.  Trapnets have not been used in Greenstone Lake because of the difficult access.The total catch of fish (all species combined) in 2001 of 16.2 fish/net (20.4 lb/gillnet) was in the third quartile for this lake class and was higher than the median catch of 10.2 fish/gillnet (17.3 lb/net) in all investigations on this lake.  Lake Class 3 is one of the least productive lake classes in northeast Minnesota, in terms of gillnet catches of fish.More walleye, bluegill, and yellow perch were caught in Greenstone Lake in 2001 than in most previous investigations.  Fish populations in 2001 were dominated by walleye, followed by northern pike and white sucker.Walleye numbers in 2001 (6.4/gillnet) were in the fourth quartile for this lake class and were higher than the median catch of 4.2/gillnet in all investigations since walleye first appeared in 1969.  Walleye sizes in 2001 averaged 15.9\" (1.5 lb), which was normal for this lake class and was similar to previous investigations on this lake.  The largest walleye in 2001 was 23.8\".  Most walleye were ages two and four, from the 1999 and 1997 year classes.  Growth of age two walleye was slower than normal by area standards, but growth of age three and older walleye was somewhat faster than normal.Northern pike numbers in 2001 (1.1/gillnet) were in the second quartile for this lake class and were lower than the median catch of 2.0/gillnet in all previous investigations on this lake.  Pike sizes in 2001 averaged 25.4\" (4.7 lb), which was normal for this lake class and was larger than the average size of 22.8\" in previous investigations on this lake.  The largest pike in 2001 was 34.8\".  Pike scales were difficult to read, but pike growth appeared to be faster than normal by area standards.White sucker numbers in 2001 (2.1/gillnet) were in the second quartile for this lake class and were similar to previous catches in this lake.  Sucker sizes in 2001 averaged 16.2\" (2.2 lb), which was normal for this lake class and was similar to previous catches in this lake.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Greenstone Lake is very typical of lakes in Ecological Lake Class 3, which consists of 72 lakes in northeast Minnesota that are average in size, deep, have irregular shorelines shapes, and very clear and soft (low mineral content) water.   <br> \n <br> \nGreenstone Lake was thermally stratified on 08/10/2009 with a surface temperature of 69 ?F and bottom temperature of 43 ?F.  Adequate oxygen for fish (2 ppm) was retained to a depth of 50 feet, where the temperature was 44 ?F.  Two inlets drain local swamps, and the outlet to Pickerel Lake has beaver dams which limit fish movement.  Shoal water substrates are very rocky, and there is little aquatic vegetation. <br> \n <br> \nThe initial survey of Greenstone Lake was conducted in 1964 and nine subsequent investigations have been carried out, with 2001 and 2009 being the two most recent.  All fish assessments were conducted between July 16 and October 11 with the majority taking place in late July and early August.  Three to 12 gillnets were set in past investigations.  Including this one, the three most recent assessments used 9 gillnets sets.  Trapnets have not been used on Greenstone Lake due to the difficult access. <br> \n <br> \nThe total catch of fish (all species combined) in 2009 of 11.6 fish/gillnet (18.1 lbs/net) was similar to the median catch of 10.9 fish/gillnet (20.5 lbs/net) for all investigations on this lake.  Lake Class 3 is one of the least productive lake classes in northeast Minnesota, in terms of gillnet catches of fish. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye was the most abundant species captured in the 2009 assessment followed by northern pike and rock bass.  White sucker and yellow perch were also captured in 2009.  Bluegill and largemouth bass were not caught in 2009 but were captured in recent assessments.  Tullibee were captured in gillnet sampling in 1976 but have not been captured since.   <br> \n <br> \nWalleye numbers in 2009 (4.8/gillnet) were above average for Lake Class 3.  This catch rate is lower than the 2001 survey (6.4/gillnet) but identical to the median number/gillnet for all Greenstone Lake investigations since walleye first appeared in 1969.  Walleye size in 2009 averaged 16.9 inches (1.85 lbs), which was normal for this lake class and longer than the mean length (15.6 inches) for all investigations on this lake.  The largest walleye in 2009 was 24.9 inches.  Age 2 and age 7 walleye from the 2007 and 2002 year classes, respectively, were most abundant in the 2009 assessment.  Walleye fry stocking has occurred periodically since the first stocking in 1942.  The most recent stockings occurred in 2002 (350,000 fry), 2006 (335,000 fry), and 2009 (345,000 fry).  Growth of walleye was normal by area standards.     <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike numbers in 2009 (2.6/gillnet) were above average for Lake Class 3 and greater than the 2001 assessment (1.1/gillnet).  The 2009 catch rate was very similar to the median catch rate (2.1/gillnet) for all Greenstone Lake investigations.  Northern pike sizes averaged 22.6 inches (2.5 lbs), which is normal for this lake class and nearly identical to the mean length (22.7 inches) for all investigations on this lake.   The largest pike in 2009 was 26.7 inches.  Growth of northern pike was normal by area standards.   <br> \n <br> \nRock bass numbers in 2009 (2.0/gillnet) were higher than normal for this lake class and higher than the median catch (1.3/gillnet) for all previous assessments on this lake.  Mean length was 6.1 inches (0.4 lbs), which is above average for Lake Class 3 but similar to the mean length (5.7 inches) for all investigations on this lake.   <br> \n <br> \nWhite sucker numbers in 2009 (1.4/gillnet) were in the normal range for Lake Class 3 and lower than the median catch of 2.0/gillnet for all investigations on this lake.  Mean white sucker size in 2009 was 14.9 inches (1.6 lbs) which was normal for this lake class and smaller than the mean length (15.6 inches) for all Greenstone Lake investigations. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",
