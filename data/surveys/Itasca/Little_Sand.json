                "narrative": "<p>Little Sand Lake is a 213 acre bass-panfish lake located five miles south of Calumet, MN in the Mississippi River watershed.  The lake has a maximum depth of 44 feet and moderately clear water (10 ft Secchi transparency).  There is a county-owned boat access on the north end of the lake off County Road #70.  <br> \n <br> \nLittle Sand Lake was sampled with night electrofishing in mid-June 2011 to collect baseline information on the largemouth bass population.  Angler reports had indicated the lake contained a good bass population, but no prior electrofishing assessments had been conducted on the lake.  This assessment yielded a moderate catch rate of 31 fish/hour of on-time.  Little Sand appears to have a respectable largemouth bass population with fish ranging from 6.5 to 19.5 inches in the sample.  Mean length was 12.7 inches. Fish ages 2 through 10 were represented in the sample, indicating consistent recruitment.  Growth was average, with fish reaching 13.5 inches in 5 years.  Largemouth bass is listed as a primary management species in the lake management plan, so future lake population assessments will likely include an electrofishing component.       <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Little Sand Lake is a 213-acre lake located 11 miles east of Grand Rapids.  A county owned cement public access is located off Highway 70 on the northeast shore with parking for two boats with trailers.  Little Sand Lake has a maximum depth of 44 feet and 54% of the lake is 15 feet or less.  The lake has moderately hard water and low fertility.  Water transparency was average in 2018 with visibility to 11 feet in mid-summer.  The depth of water at which oxygen levels limit fish presence was 12 ft. in 2018.  Little Sand Lake has two small inlets draining wetland areas and one outlet (Sand Creek) draining to Lammon Aid Lake.  Other lakes with similar habitat in the Grand Rapids area include Little Splithand, Lower Panasa, and Jay Gould.   <br> \n <br> \nThe 2018 survey was the sixth survey of the fish community since 1974.  This survey was conducted to monitor the fish community for changes in species composition, abundance, size structure and growth.  The gamefish species that are best suited for the lake are Largemouth Bass, Black Crappie, and Northern Pike.    No special regulations are present.  The 2005 management plan indicated Largemouth Bass and Black Crappie were primary management species, while Northern Pike, Bluegill and Walleye were secondary management species.     <br> \n <br> \nThe Largemouth Bass population had average catch rates and size distribution.   Bass have been sampled in 5 of 6 surveys and gill-net catch rates have had an increasing trend.  Electrofishing was not conducted in 2018 due to staff reductions and weather; however, the 2011 electrofishing catch rate was similar to the average value for all prior Grand Rapids Area electrofishing surveys.  Lengths in 2018 ranged from 7 to 18 inches, with an average of 12.7 inches.  Size structure was average, as 38% of bass sampled exceeded 12 inches and 31% exceeded 15 inches.  Conclusions from age and growth information collected in 2018 could not be made due to the small sample size.  Due to the lake's small size, anglers are encouraged to release Largemouth Bass exceeding 15 inches to help maintain or improve size structure.   <br> \n <br> \nThe Black Crappie population had above average catch rates, slightly below average size distribution, and below average growth.  Trap net and gill net catches in 2018 were similar to previous averages.  Lengths ranged from 3 to 10 inches, with an average of 7.5 inches.  Size structure was below average, as 40% of crappie sampled exceeded 8 inches and 5% exceeded 10 inches.  Some level of recruitment appears to occur regularly with six age classes sampled in 2018.  However, typical of most crappie populations, there have been one or two primary year classes sampled in each of the past three surveys.  Crappie were aged from 2 to 7 years old, with age 3 and 4 fish most common.  Growth was below average, resulting in crappie taking five years to average 8 inches. <br> \n <br> \nThe Northern Pike population had lower catch rates and below average size distribution and growth.  The gill net catch in 2018 was similar to the lake average.  Higher catch rates are undesirable, as they are typically indicative of higher density populations with poor size structure and slow growth.  Lengths ranged from 12 to 37 inches, with an average of 19 inches.  Size structure was below average, as 24% of pike sampled exceeded 21 inches and 9% exceeded 28 inches.  Pike were aged from 1 to 9 years old.  Growth was below average, resulting in pike taking five years to average 21 inches.  Due to the lake's small size, anglers are encouraged to release Northern Pike exceeding 26 inches and harvest up to 10 less than 22 inches to help improve size structure.  Spearers are encouraged to harvest smaller pike also.   <br> \n <br> \nThe Bluegill population had moderate catch rates, average size distribution, and below average growth.  The trap-net catch in 2018 was similar to the lake average.  Lengths of fish sampled ranged from 3 to 9 inches, with an average of 6.4 inches.  Size structure was average, as 70% of Bluegill sampled exceeded 6 inches, and 18% exceeded 8 inches.  Bluegill were aged from 3 to 12 years old.  Growth was below average, resulting in Bluegill taking seven years to average 6 inches.  Due to the lake's small size, anglers are encouraged to release Bluegill exceeding 8 inches to help improve size structure. <br> \n <br> \nThe Yellow Perch population had very low catch rates and poor size distribution.  A total of two perch have ever been sampled with trap nets, while none have ever been sampled with gill nets in six surveys.  One 5.5 inch perch was sampled in 2018.  However, young-of-year and yearling perch were sampled in each of the five seining surveys that occurred from 1974 to 2004.  Age and growth information has never been determined.  Although perch are too small to interest anglers, they may be an important prey source for gamefish at times. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled in this survey included Bowfin (Dogfish), Brown Bullhead, Hybrid Sunfish, Pumpkinseed Sunfish, Rock Bass, and Yellow Bullhead.   <br> \n <br> \nIn order to maintain or improve fish and wildlife populations, water quality and habitat must be protected.  People often associate water quality problems with large-scale agricultural, forestry, urban development or industrial practices in the watershed.  In reality, the impact of land use decisions on one lake lot may be relatively small, yet the cumulative impact of those decisions on many lake lots can result in a significant decline in water quality and habitat.  For example, removing shoreline and aquatic vegetation, fertilizing lawns, mowing to the water's edge, installing beach sand blankets, failing septic systems and uncontrolled run-off, all contribute excess nutrients and sediment which degrade water quality and habitat.  Understanding these cumulative impacts and taking steps to avoid or minimize them will help to insure our quality fisheries can be enjoyed by future generations. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers and boaters are reminded to help stop the spread of invasive species by removing all aquatic plants from boats, trailers, and equipment.  All drain plugs must be removed and live and bait wells must be drained before leaving the access.  Anglers and boaters are encouraged to power wash and thoroughly dry all equipment prior to use in another water body.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Little Sand Lake is a 213 acre bass-panfish lake located five miles south of Calumet, MN in the Mississippi River watershed.  The lake has a maximum depth of 44 feet and moderately clear water (10 ft visibility).  There is a county-owned boat access on the north end of the lake off County Road #70.  Little Sand Lake has been known locally as a good crappie lake.  The gill-net catch rate for black crappie in the 2004 assessment was above the normal range at 6.7/net, while the trap-net catch rate was near the lake class average at 1.7/net.  Black crappie sampled in 2004 had a modest size structure.  Fish in the trap-net sample varied in length from 4.4 to 10.0 inches.  Growth rates for black crappie were below the statewide average for all ages.The trap-net catch rate for bluegill was within the normal range at 9.2/net.  This is down slightly from the 1991 assessment and the lowest catch rate observed since 1974.  Bluegill size structure was modest.  Fish in the trap-net sample varied from 3.4 to 8.4 inches.  Only 4% of the fish sampled were over 8 inches.  Bluegill growth rates were similar to the lake class average.Gill-net and trap-net catch rates for largemouth bass were within the normal range in 2004.  The gill-net catch rate of 1.0/net was identical to the previous survey and the lake class average.  Fish in the gill-net sample varied in length from 8.1 to 19.1 inches.  A spring electrofishing assessment would likely provide better information on the bass population.  The gill-net catch rate for northern pike (3.0/net) was below the expected range and was the lowest catch in any assessment since 1974.  Gill-net sampled pike had a poor size structure; they varied in length from 12.3 to 36.6 inches, with only one fish over 28 inches.  Northern pike growth rates were generally below the statewide average.  One walleye was captured in 2004.  Age analysis indicated that this fish was 11 years old.  No walleye have been stocked in Little Sand Lake since 1986, so this fish was evidently the result of natural reproduction.  Other species sampled included: blackchin shiner, blacknose shiner, Johnny darter, bowfin, pumpkinseed sunfish, rock bass, yellow perch and black, brown and yellow bullhead.As lakes like Little Sand become increasingly more developed, lakeshore owners will have a larger impact on their future.  In order to maintain or improve fish and wildlife populations, water quality and habitat must be protected.  Although the effect of land use decisions on one lake lot may seem relatively small, the cumulative impact of many lakeshore owners \"fixing up\" their property can result in a significant decline in water quality and habitat.  For example, removing shoreline and aquatic vegetation, installing sand beach blankets, fertilizing lawns, mowing to the waters edge, uncontrolled run-off and failing septic systems all contribute excess nutrients and sediment which degrade water quality and habitat.  Understanding these impacts and taking steps to avoid or minimize them will help to insure our quality fisheries can be enjoyed by future generations.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Largemouth bass and black crappie were the only species sampled with catch rates exceeding established median values for lakes within ecological lake class #29.  Catch rates for other species sampled were at or slightly below established median values.All walleyes sampled were determined to be five year old fish, which would correspond with the 1986 fry/fingerling stocking.  It appears walleye fry stocked during the mid 1940's failed to establish a self-sustaining population.Black crappie are considered the main target fish in Little Sand Lake.  Although five year classes are represented in the sample it is the 1986 year class that predominated-making up 47% of the sample.  Growth rates of crappies sampled fall well below established averages for this species.Trap net CPUE values for bluegill have ranged widely since the mid 1970's from a low of 2.3/lift in 1974 to a high of 45.5/lift in 1985.  The high abundance of bluegills reported in 1985 corresponds with a depressed bass population during this time period.  Since 1985 the bluegill and bass populations have returned to a more normal predator/prey ratio.  Like the crappies in Little Sand Lake, bluegills also displayed slow growth.Yellow perch are conspicuously absent from both trap and gill net samples although shoreline seining confirms their presence.The major forage species available to large predators appear to be bluegill, black crappie, golden shiners, and to a lesser degree yellow perch.  A forage base of this structure may be best utilized by largemouth bass.Five year classes of northern pike are represented with age 2, 3 and 4 fish making up 84% of the sample.  A PSD of 20 was computed from gill netting data which reflects a population dominated by fish 17 inches or less.</p>",
