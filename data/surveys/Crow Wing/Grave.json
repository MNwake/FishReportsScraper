The lake is heavily developed with 65 homes/cabins along 2 miles of shoreline.  The maximum depth is 13'.  Shallow water substrates are primarily sand and gravel.  The aquatic plant community is somewhat diverse with 20 species present.  Emergent plants such as bulrush and water lilies are important for shoreline protection, maintaining water quality and provide essential spawning habitat for bass and panfish species.  Submerged plants provide food and cover needed by fish and other aquatic species.  Northern pike were caught in above average numbers in 2002 at 17.7/gill net, which is the highest catch of the 3 nettings dating back to 1969.  The 1999 and 2000 year classes contributed 39% and 28% of the catch, respectively.  These 2 and 3 year old fish measured approximately 17\" to 22\".  Average length and weight of all northern pike sampled by gill nets were 20.2\" and 1.9lbs.The largemouth bass catch of 0.6/trap net was average compared to similar lakes and was the highest catch to date.  Average length and weight were 10.7\" and 0.8lbs.The bluegill catch of 45.7/trap net was above average.  Past catches were 1.2/trap net (1969) and 9.0/trap net (1987).  Most fish (86%) were 4 to 7 years old and 42% of trap netted bluegills measured 7\" or larger, compared to 39% in 1987.  Black crappie abundance in 2002 was above average in 2002 at 17.8/trap net.  Average weight in 2002 was 0.3lbs and 57% of trap netted crappies were 8\" or larger.  The 1998 and 2001 year classes were strongest accounting for 49% and 28% of the catch, respectively.  The 1998 year class was about 8\" to 9\" in length and the 2001 year class measured 4\" to 5\".Yellow perch are an important forage species for the lake's game fish and were below average in mumbers in 2002 at 4.2/gill net.  Past catches in 1969 and 1987 were 118 and 0.7/gill net, respectively.   </p>",

The white sucker net catch was also in the upper quartile for gill net catches and has a very high trap net catch rate. Both black and yellow bullhead, bluegill, pumpkinseed, green sunfish and yellow perch net catch rates are within the first quartile of the median for the area. The northern pike population shows a downward trend in both size and abundance. The yellow perch population went from very high catch rates in 1969 to catches in or below the low quartiles in 1987. The black crappie population went from very high catch rates in 1969 catch rates, however the length frequency distribution was characterized by fish measuring 4 to 7 inches in length. My conception of a winterkill or partial winterkill lake was that you would have some populations that were high and fast growing. Grave Lake fish data indicates no fast growing fish of any species present.</p>",
