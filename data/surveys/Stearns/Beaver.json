                "narrative": "<p>Beaver Lake is located three miles south of the town of Luxemburg in Stearns County.  The maximum depth of the lake is 27 feet.  The public access is located on the east side off of State Highway 15.  Black crappie, bluegill, northern pike, largemouth bass, and yellow perch are all present in the lake.  In July of 2004, a lake survey was conducted on Beaver Lake.  Sampling revealed the following information about the fish populations.The northern pike catch rate increased slightly from the 1994 survey (13.5/gill net) to 2004 (19.0/net).  This catch rate was greater than the expected range for lakes similar to Beaver Lake.  The average size of northern pike caught in gill nets (2.3 lbs) was similar to 1994, and the largest pike sampled was 28 inches in length. The catch rate of yellow perch (5.0/gill net) fell significantly from 1994 (26.5/net), but remained within the expected range for lakes similar to Beaver.  Most of the yellow perch sampled were small (5.5-6.5 inches) and growth rates were slow.Largemouth bass were sampled in spring by night electrofishing.  The catch rate was over twice the median rate for lakes in the Montrose management area.  Of the catchable size bass (greater than 8 inches), 30 percent were greater than 12 inches.  The largest bass sampled in 2004 was just over 18 inches.The catch rate of black crappie was similar to the 1994 survey, and was within expected values for lakes similar to Beaver.  Crappie had a average length of 8.9 inches, and the majority were 3 years old.  Growth rates were relatively fast.  The catch rate of bluegill in Beaver Lake (39.8/net) decreased from 1994 (90.2/net), but remained within expected levels for this lake type.  The average weight of bluegill was low and their growth was considered slow by statewide averages.  The majority of bluegill were 4.0-6.5 inches, with a maximum of  7.1 inches.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Beaver Lake is a 152 acre lake located 6 miles north of Kimball in southeastern Stearns County. It has a maximum depth of 27 feet and a small watershed dominated by row crops. A DNR owned public access is located on the east side of the lake near Highway 15. Beaver Lake is managed for Northern Pike and Largemouth Bass and was last surveyed in 2004. Anglers can expect good fishing for Largemouth Bass, Northern Pike, and panfish.  <br> \n <br> \nEmergent and floating leaf vegetation covered about two thirds of the shoreline in September, primarily cattail, bulrush, and waterlilies. Submerged vegetation was not surveyed, but chara, coontail, and northern watermilfoil were the dominant species in 2004. Water clarity was good; Secchi depth was 9.0 feet in late June and MPCA data show a summer average of 13 feet over the last ten years. Dissolved oxygen was adequate to support fish to 23 feet in late June. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike numbers were above the expected range of values for similar lakes and little changed from 2004. Lengths ranged from 11.5 to 31.2 inches with an average length and weight of 21.0 inches and 2.1 pounds. Most pike were small; only 16% were longer than 24 inches. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass were sampled by daytime electrofishing on May 12. The catch rate of 134/hour was far above the Sauk Rapids area daytime average of 43/hour, but similar to 2004 results. Lengths ranged from 5.2 to 19.4 inches with an average length of 10.5 inches. Of catchable size fish (>8 inches), 31% were longer than 15 inches. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill numbers were higher than in 2004, and above the range of expected values for similar lakes. Lengths ranged from 3.0 to 8.3 inches with an average length of 5.0 inches. Black Crappie numbers were above the expected range of values for gill nets, but within the expected range of values for trap nets and were the highest on record. Black Crappie lengths ranged from 4.5 to 10.1 inches, with an average length of 7.5 inches. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch numbers were below the expected range of values and lower than 2004 results. High numbers of Northern Pike likely limit Yellow Perch survival. Lengths ranged from 5.3 to 8.9 inches with an average length of 6.3 inches. No White Sucker or bullhead species were sampled in 2017, although low numbers were caught in previous surveys. Other species sampled in 2017 included: Green Sunfish, Hybrid Sunfish, Pumpkinseed, and Rock Bass. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

The average size northern pike (2.3 lbs) appeared to drop from the last survey (4.5 lbs) but remained within expected levels for this lake type.  One to seven year old fish were caught, with a good representation of all age classes in the sample.  The growth rate of northern pike was average when compared with other lakes in the area.The catch rate of walleye (0.8/gill net) did not significantly change from the previous survey (0.5/gill net) and remained low for this lake type.  The lake is not stocked with walleye as it does not currently have a public access.  Only 7 and 8 year old fish were sampled and the growth rate for walleye was fast for ages 1-6 and average for ages 7 and 8.     The catch rate of yellow perch in gill nets (26.5/net) rose significantly from the last survey (0.5/net) and now falls within expected levels for this lake type.  Yellow perch sampled ranged in length from 5.4-8.9 inches and averaged 6.7 inches in length.  The average weight of yellow perch (0.1 lbs) did not change from the previous survey and remained within expected levels for this lake class.  The catch rate in trap nets of bluegill (90.2/net) appeared to increase from the last survey (40.3/net) and rose above expected levels for lakes similar to Beaver.  Bluegill caught ranged in size from 3.0-8.6 inches and averaged 5.9 inches in length.  Four and five year old fish dominated the catch and growth rates for bluegill were average when compared with other populations in the state.The catch rate of black crappie in a trap nets did not appear to change from the 1988 survey and remained within expected levels for this lake type.  Black crappie caught ranged in size from 8.2-9.4 inches and averaged 8.8 inches in length.  All fish sampled were four years old and overall growth rate for crappie was average when compared to other populations in the state.  Largemouth bass populations were assessed by spring electrofishing.  A total of 59 bass were caught at a rate of 25.3 fish per hour of sampling.  Largemouth bass caught ranged 6.5-17.6 inches and averaged 9.1 inches in length.  The growth rate of bass was slow for this lake type.  </p>",

Northern Pike were abundant and were caught at a rate of 7.5/gill net, similar to previous surveys. Fish ranged in size from 14-31 inches. Bimodal length groups were 16 and 22 inches. Important species caught in trap nets were Bluegill Pumpkinseed, hybrid sunfish and Green Sunfish. Bluegill were abundant and have been historically. Fish ranged in size from three to eight inches with the bimodal length groups of 5.0-5.4 and 6.0 - 6.4 inches. Growth was slow. Fifty-eight Largemouth Bass were captured during the spring seining. Fish ranged in size from 3 to 18 inches. Modal length group was 7.0-7.4 inches. Several year classes were present with age 3 being the most dominant. Growth was slow.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of nearshore fish species in Beaver Lake was conducted on June 21, 2017 by Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program Staff.  Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible.  Backpack electrofishing was completed at ten sampling stations, but three stations were sampled from the boat due to site conditions.  Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample five stations, a 15-foot seine was used at two stations, and site conditions prevented the use of seines at three stations.  Nearshore sampling captured 11 species of fish including four species that are intolerant of disturbance (Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, and Rock Bass) and one that is tolerant of disturbance (Green Sunfish). <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore data were combined with trap net and gill net data from a June 2017 survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based IBI (FIBI) score.  The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment.  In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g. Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, and Rock Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g. Black Bullhead, Common Carp, and Green Sunfish).  The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake.  For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.   <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey indicates Beaver Lake is in good health as indicated by an FIBI score above the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes.  Data from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Mississippi River-St. Cloud Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.</p>",
