Pike reproduction appears excellent as age classes-1+ through 4+ were represented in the sample.  <br> \n     Abundances of black and brown bullhead remain similar to both previous surveys and the area medians. Yellow bullhead abundance was 16.3 per gill net lift, compared to 12.9 in 1984 and 2.8 in 1976.  <br> \n     Bluegill abundance decreased from 63.0 per trap net lift in 1984 to 42.2, but remains well above that found in previous surveys.  Twenty-two percent of the bluegills measured were greater than 7.0 inches in length.  Bluegill growth rates are slow.  <br> \n     Largemouth bass abundance appears high and reproduction good. The 1988 and 1986 year classes appear strong as they composed 86% of the sample.  <br> \n     Black crappie reproduction also appears good as three age-classes were represented in the sample. <br> \n      Yellow perch abundance has historically been low and continues to decline.  Yellow perch were not represented in gill net sample.  <br> \n     Walleye abundance remained similar to previous surveys at 2.5 per gill net lift. Age 4+ walleyes were present in the sample which may indicate limited reproduction. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Leek Lake is located in north-central Otter Tail County approximately three miles northwest of Vergas, MN.  Leek Lake is a 609-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake that is part of the Otter Tail River Watershed.  Two small intermittent inlets are located along the southeast shoreline and one intermittent outlet is located along the north shoreline.  Both inlets and the outlet are unnavigable.  The immediate watershed is composed primarily of homes/cabins and resorts interspersed with mixed hardwood woodlots.  The maximum depth of Leek Lake is 76 feet; however, 45% of the lake is less than 15 feet in depth.  The secchi disk reading during the 1999 lake survey was 12.0 feet, which indicates excellent water clarity.  Previous secchi disk readings have ranged from 6.2 to 12.0 feet.  Periodic plankton/algae blooms throughout the summer months can influence secchi disk readings.  The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different lake classes based on physical and chemical characteristics of the lakes.  Leek Lake is included in lake class 25 of this classification scheme.  Leek Lake is located within the DNR's Fergus Falls Management Area.       The majority of the shoreline of Leek Lake has been extensively developed.  The development consists primarily of homes, cottages, and resorts.  The 1984 lake resurvey referenced 95 homes/cottages and two resorts.  A DNR owned concrete public access is located off of the township road along the southwest shoreline of the lake.  The shoal water substrates consist of sand and rubble.  The substrate of the bay areas is predominately muck.  Large stands of hardstem bulrush are scattered along various shorelines of the lake.  Common cattail is prevalent in several of the lakes' bays.  Emergent aquatic plants such as bulrush and cattail provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat, and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms, and can actually absorb and break down polluting chemicals.  Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish such as northern pike, largemouth bass, and panfish.  They also serve as important nursery areas for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit.  To maintain the excellent water quality and angling that this lake has to offer, it is imperative to preserve the quality of the aquatic habitat.       Leek Lake can be ecologically classified as a bass-panfish type of lake and this is reflected in the assemblage of the fish community.  Northern pike, largemouth bass, black crappie, and bluegill are the dominant species in the fish community of Leek Lake.  The prolificacy of these species can be attributed to the abundance of suitable spawning habitat that is available.       A high-density northern pike population exists.  The long-term trend has been an increase in the northern pike test-net catch rate and the catch rate in this survey was the highest of any survey conducted on this lake.  The catch rate also exceeded the upper limit of the normal range for lake class 25.  Age data indicate that pike natural reproduction is consistently good.  Northern pike ranged in length from 13.0 to 30.3 inches with an average length and weight of 18.2 inches and 1.2 pounds.  Pike reach an average length of 22.0 inches at five years of age.  Growth rate estimates are slower than average growth rates for lake class 25 lakes in the Fergus Falls Management Area.  The slow growth rates for pike may be attributed to the low abundance of yellow perch, a preferred forage fish.       Data collected from a spring electrofishing assessment indicated that Leek Lake has a balanced largemouth bass population.  Bass ranged in length from 3.4 to 17.1 inches with an average length and weight of 10.0 inches and 0.7 pounds.  Bass exhibit good growth rates with an average length of 12.4 inches at age-IV.      Catch data from a spring trapnetting assessment indicated that black crappie are abundant in Leek Lake.  Crappies ranged in length from 4.5 to 11.5 inches with an average length and weight of 8.7 inches and 0.4 pounds.  Fifty-two percent of the crappies were at least 9.0 inches in length.  Several strong year classes (1995 and 1997) should provide good crappie angling for several years.  Black crappie growth rates are slower than average growth rates for lake class 25 lakes in the Fergus Falls Management Area.  Crappies reach an average length of 9.1 inches at five years of age.       The bluegill test-net catch rate was lower than the recent series of lake surveys but was within the normal range for lake class 25 lakes.  Age data has documented poor reproduction for bluegills in 1992 and 1993.  The poor reproduction can be attributed to the inclement summers in those years.  These weak year classes may account for the decline in bluegill abundance.  Ten percent of the bluegill sample was at least 7.0 inches in length.  Bluegills reach an average length of 6.0 inches at eight years of age which is below the statewide normal range of growth for lake class 25 lakes.     The walleye test-net catch rate was equivalent to the lower limit of the normal range for lake class 25.  Walleye abundance has historically been low in Leek Lake.  Walleye fry have been stocked in Leek Lake over the recent series of surveys, however; age and catch data indicate that the extent of contribution to the walleye population was negligible.  The DNR will initiate a biennial walleye fingerling stocking sequence in 2000 which will be evaluated over the future series of lake surveys.  This stocking plan may increase walleye angling opportunities for anglers of Leek Lake.       Anglers can maintain the quality of fishing in Leek Lake by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large-size fish while allowing the harvest of the more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future       </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>     Leek (Trowbridge) Lake is a 609-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located in north-central Otter Tail County approximately three miles northwest of Vergas, MN.  Leek Lake is part of the Otter Tail River Watershed.  Two small intermittent inlets are located along the southeast shoreline and one intermittent outlet is located along the north shoreline.  Both inlets and the outlet are not navigable.  The immediate watershed is composed primarily of agricultural land interspersed with mixed hardwood woodlots.  The maximum depth of Leek Lake is 76 feet; however, 45% of the lake is less than 15 feet in depth.  The secchi disk reading during the 2014 lake survey was 13.0 feet.  Previous secchi disk readings ranged from 6.2 to 12.0 feet.        <br> \n     The majority of the shoreline of Leek Lake has been extensively developed.  The development consists primarily of homes, cottages, and resorts.  A DNR owned concrete public access is located off of a township road along the southwest shoreline of the lake.  The shoal water substrates consist primarily of sand and rubble.  The substrate of the bay areas is predominately muck.  Large stands of hardstem bulrush are scattered along various shorelines of the lake.  Common cattail is prevalent in several of the bays.  Plants such as bulrush and cattail provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  Emergent aquatic plants protect shorelines and lake bottoms, and can actually absorb and break down polluting chemicals.  Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish such as Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, and panfish.  They also serve as important nursery areas for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit.  To maintain the excellent water quality and angling that this lake has to offer, it is imperative to preserve the quality of the aquatic habitat.   <br> \n     Northern Pike,  Black Crappie, and Bluegill are the dominant species in the fish community of Leek Lake.  The prolificacy of these species can be attributed to the abundance of suitable spawning habitat that is available.   <br> \n     Leek Lake has historically had a high-density Northern Pike population.  Age data indicate that pike reproduction is consistently good.  Northern Pike ranged in length from 16.6 to 28.9 inches with an average length and weight of 20.4 inches and 1.7 pounds.   <br> \n     A spring trapnetting assessment was conducted to analyze the Black Crappie population.  Catch data indicates that Black Crappies are abundant.  Seventy percent of the crappies were 9.0 inches or greater in length.  Black Crappies attain an average length of 10.9 inches at five years of age.   <br> \n     Age data indicate that Bluegill reproduction is consistently good.  Forty-two percent of the Bluegills were 7.0 inches or greater in length.   Bluegills attain an average length of 7.2 inches at six years of age. <br> \n     Anglers can maintain the quality of fishing in Leek Lake by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large-size fish while allowing the harvest of the more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>     Leek (Trowbridge) Lake is a 609-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located in north-central Otter Tail County approximately three miles northwest of Vergas, MN.  Leek Lake is part of the Otter Tail River Watershed.  Two small intermittent inlets are located along the southeast shoreline and one intermittent outlet is located along the north shoreline.  Both inlets and the outlet are not navigable.  The immediate watershed is composed primarily of agricultural land interspersed with mixed hardwood woodlots.  The maximum depth of Leek Lake is 76 feet; however, 45% of the lake is 15 feet or less in depth.  The secchi disk reading during the 2019 lake survey was 15.5 feet.  Previous secchi disk readings ranged from 6.2 to 13.0 feet.        <br> \n     The majority of the shoreline of Leek Lake has been extensively developed.  The development consists primarily of homes, cottages, and resorts.  A DNR owned concrete public access is located off of a township road along the southwest shoreline of the lake.  The shoal water substrates consist primarily of sand and rubble.  The substrate of the bay areas is predominately muck.  Large stands of hardstem bulrush are scattered along various shorelines of the lake.  Common cattail is prevalent in several of the bays.  Plants such as bulrush and cattail provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  Emergent aquatic plants protect shorelines and lake bottoms, and can absorb and break down polluting chemicals.  Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish such as Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, and panfish.  They also serve as important nursery areas for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit.  To maintain the excellent water quality and angling that this lake has to offer, it is imperative to preserve the quality of the aquatic habitat.   <br> \n     Black Crappie, Bluegill, Northern Pike, and Largemouth Bass are the dominant gamefish species in the fish community of Leek Lake.  The prolificacy of these species can be attributed to the abundance of suitable spawning habitat that is available.   <br> \n     Leek Lake has historically had a high-density Northern Pike population.  Age data indicate that pike reproduction is consistently good.  Northern Pike ranged in length from 16.5 to 29.8 inches with an average length and weight of 20.9 inches and 2.0 pounds.  Pike attain an average length of 22.8 inches at six years of age.    <br> \n     A spring trapnetting assessment was conducted to analyze the Black Crappie population.  Catch data indicates that Black Crappies are abundant and the size structure is good.  Black Crappies ranged in length from 6.9 to 12.9 inches with a mean length of 10.2 inches.  Ninety-three percent of the crappies were 9.0 inches or greater in length.  Black Crappies attain an average length of 10.8 inches at five years of age.   <br> \n     Age data indicates that Largemouth Bass reproduction is consistently good.  Largemouth Bass ranged in length from 7.3 to 19.8 inches with an average length and weight of 13.6 inches and 1.5 pounds, respectively.  Largemouth Bass attain an average length of 12.3 inches at four years of age. <br> \n     Age data indicate that Bluegill reproduction is also consistently good.  Forty-three percent of the Bluegills were 7.0 inches or greater in length and 13% were 8.0 inches or greater in length.   Bluegills attain an average length of 7.2 inches at six years of age. <br> \n     Walleyes ranged in length from 14.0 to 24.9 inches with an average length and weight of 19.3 inches and 2.5 pounds.  Walleyes attain an average length of 16.4 inches at five years of age.     <br> \n     Anglers can maintain the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large-size fish while allowing the harvest of the more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future. <br> \n     Leek Lake is not listed as an infested water.  Aquatic invasive species are threatening Minnesota waters.  Aquatic invasive species can potentially harm water quality, water recreation, aquatic habitat, native species, and fish populations.  Anglers can help prevent the introduction and spread of invasive species by following watercraft transportation laws.   <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>     Leek (Trowbridge) Lake is a 609-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located in north-central Otter Tail County approximately three miles northwest of Vergas, MN.  Leek Lake is part of the Otter Tail River Watershed.  Two small intermittent inlets are located along the southeast shoreline and one intermittent outlet is located along the north shoreline.  Both inlets and the outlet are not navigable.  The immediate watershed is composed primarily of agricultural land interspersed with mixed hardwood woodlots.  The maximum depth of Leek Lake is 76 feet; however, 45% of the lake is less than 15 feet in depth.  The secchi disk reading during the 2009 lake survey was 9.9 feet.  Previous secchi disk readings have ranged from 6.2 to 12.0 feet.  Periodic plankton/algae blooms throughout the summer months can influence secchi disk readings.       <br> \n     The majority of the shoreline of Leek Lake has been extensively developed.  The development consists primarily of homes, cottages, and resorts.  A DNR owned concrete public access is located off of the township road along the southwest shoreline of the lake.  The shoal water substrates consist primarily of sand and rubble.  The substrate of the bay areas is predominately muck.  Large stands of hardstem bulrush are scattered along various shorelines of the lake.  Common cattail is prevalent in several of the bays.  Plants such as bulrush and cattail provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  Emergent aquatic plants protect shorelines and lake bottoms, and can actually absorb and break down polluting chemicals.  Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish such as northern pike, largemouth bass, and panfish.  They also serve as important nursery areas for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit.  To maintain the excellent water quality and angling that this lake has to offer, it is imperative to preserve the quality of the aquatic habitat.   <br> \n     Leek Lake can be ecologically classified as a bass-panfish type of lake and this is reflected in the assemblage of the fish community.  Northern pike, largemouth bass, black crappie, and bluegill are the dominant species in the fish community of Leek Lake.  The prolificacy of these species can be attributed to the abundance of suitable spawning habitat that is available.   <br> \n     Walleye, largemouth bass, and bluegill are listed as the primary management species for Leek Lake.  The test-net catch rate for walleye was within the normal range for similar lakes.  Walleye abundance has historically been low in Leek Lake.  Walleye ranged in length from 10.3 to 28.5 inches with an average length and weight of 18.0 inches and 2.3 pounds.    <br> \n     A spring trapnetting assessment was conducted to analyze the black crappie population.  Data indicates that black crappies are abundant in Leek Lake.  Black crappies ranged in length from 6.3 to 12.0 inches with an average length of 9.0 inches.  Fourty-seven percent of the crappies were at least 9.0 inches in length.   <br> \n     A spring electrofishing assessment was conducted to analyze the largemouth bass population. Data indicates that Leek Lake has a balanced largemouth bass population.  Largemouth bass ranged in length from 10.1 to 15.8 inches with an average length of 13.3 inches. <br> \n     Historically, Leek Lake has had a high density northern pike population; however, in this survey the northern pike test-net catch rate was within the normal range for similar lakes.  Northern pike ranged in length from 9.3 to 30.5 inches with an average length and weight of 18.6 inches and 1.3 pounds.   <br> \n     The bluegill test-net catch rate was within the normal range for similar lakes.  Bluegills ranged in length from 2.8 to 8.3 inches with an average length and weight of 5.4 inches and 0.2 pounds.  Twenty-seven percent of the bluegill sample was at least 7.0 inches in length. <br> \n     Anglers can maintain the quality of fishing in Leek Lake by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large-size fish while allowing the harvest of the more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Leek Lake is a 609-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located in north-central Otter Tail County approximately three miles northwest of Vergas, MN.  Leek Lake is part of the Otter Tail River Watershed.  Two small intermittent inlets are located along the southeast shoreline and one intermittent outlet is located along the north shoreline.  Both inlets and the outlet are unnavigable.  The immediate watershed is composed primarily of agricultural land  interspersed with mixed hardwood woodlots.  The maximum depth of Leek Lake is 76 feet; however, 45% of the lake is less than 15 feet in depth.  The secchi disk reading during the 2004 lake survey was 11.3 feet, which indicates excellent water clarity.  Previous secchi disk readings have ranged from 6.2 to 12.0 feet.  Periodic plankton/algae blooms throughout the summer months can influence secchi disk readings.  Leek Lake is included in lake class 25 of the Minnesota DNR lake classification scheme.         The majority of the shoreline of Leek Lake has been extensively developed.  The development consists primarily of homes, cottages, and resorts.  The 1984 lake resurvey report referenced 95 homes/cottages and two resorts.  A DNR owned concrete public access is located off of the township road along the southwest shoreline of the lake.  The shoal water substrates consist primarily of sand and rubble.  The substrate of the bay areas is predominately muck.  Large stands of hardstem bulrush are scattered along various shorelines of the lake.  Common cattail is prevalent in several of the lakes' bays.  Emergent aquatic plants such as bulrush and cattail provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat, and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms, and can actually absorb and break down polluting chemicals.  Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish such as northern pike, largemouth bass, and panfish.  They also serve as important nursery areas for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit.  To maintain the excellent water quality and angling that this lake has to offer, it is imperative to preserve the quality of the aquatic habitat.       Leek Lake can be ecologically classified as a bass-panfish type of lake and this is reflected in the assemblage of the fish community.  Northern pike, largemouth bass, black crappie, and bluegill are the dominant species in the fish community of Leek Lake.  The prolificacy of these species can be attributed to the abundance of suitable spawning habitat that is available.       A high-density northern pike population exists.  The long-term trend has been an increase in the northern pike test-net catch rate.  The catch rate also exceeded the upperlimit of the normal range for lake class 25.  Age data indicate that pike natural reproduction is consistently good.  Northern pike ranged in length from 11.0 to 28.2 inches with an average length and weight of 17.8 inches and 1.2 pounds.  Pike exhibit extremely slow growth with an average length of 18.0 inches at five years of age.  The slow growth rates for pike may be attributed to the high-density population and to the low abundance of yellow perch, a preferred forage fish.       Data collected from a spring electrofishing assessment indicated that Leek Lake has a balanced largemouth bass population.  Bass ranged in length from 6.5 to 18.3 inches with an average length and weight of 10.7 inches and 0.9 pounds.  Bass exhibit good growth rates with an average length of 12.2 inches at age-IV.      Catch data from a spring trapnetting assessment indicated that black crappie are abundant in Leek Lake.  Crappies ranged in length from 5.6 to 12.4 inches with an average length and weight of 9.8 inches and 0.6 pounds.  Seventy-seven percent of the crappies were at least 9.0 inches in length.  A strong 1998 year class should provide good crappie angling for several years.  Crappies attain an average length of 9.9 inches at five years of age.       The bluegill test-net catch rate exceeded the upper limit of the normal range for class 25 lakes.  The general trend has been an increase in bluegill abundance.  Twenty-three percent of the bluegill sample was at least 7.0 inches in length.  Age data indicate that bluegill reproduction is consistently good.  Bluegills attain an average length of 6.8 inches at seven years of age.     The walleye test-net catch rate was within the normal range for lake class 25.  Walleye abundance has historically been low in Leek Lake.  Walleye ranged in length from 12.0 to 22.1 inches with an average length and weight of 16.7 and 1.6 pounds.  Walleye fry were stocked in Leek Lake over the recent series of surveys, however; age and catch data indicated that the extent of contribution to the walleye population was negligible.  The DNR  initiated a biennial walleye fingerling stocking sequence in 2000 which will be evaluated over the future series of lake surveys.  This stocking plan may increase walleye angling opportunities for anglers of Leek Lake.       Anglers can maintain the quality of fishing in Leek Lake by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large-size fish while allowing the harvest of the more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future.       </p>",
