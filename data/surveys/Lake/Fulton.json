Access is suitable for portage wheels, although it is rough and uneven. <br> \n <br> \nThe 2009 walleye population in Fulton Lake was about average for the lake class.  The average length was 19.5 inches and 71% of the catch was greater than 18 inches. Growth was much faster than other lakes in the Finland area. Three previous assessments were done on this lake; this was the highest catch on record. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike numbers were slightly above average for the lake class with a catch of 2.7 fish per net. The average length was 21.8 inches with the largest fish measuring 24.1 inches. <br> \n  <br> \nThree yellow perch were caught in trap nets with an average length of 5.7 inches. This was the lowest catch on record. <br> \n <br> \nIn 1957, 141 black crappie yearlings were stocked into Fulton Lake.  Black crappies were sampled in low numbers in the 1961, 1978, and 1993 investigations. While no black crappies were sampled in the 2009 lake survey, a self-sustaining population has existed since the initial introduction.  Black crappies might still be found in low numbers in Fulton Lake.  <br> \n</p>",

Approximately 61% of the area (20.5 acres) is less than 15 feet deep. A scattered to moderate growth of submerged and floating-leaved aquatic plants is supported by the moderately soft water. Lake shoal soils are approximately 95% a mixture of gravel and sand. The remaining 5% is muck. A minute amount of rubble is present. The lake had 3 inlets and 1 outlet which contained water. A fourth inlet was dry. A shoreline marsh or lowland area cattail and sedge borders most of the northern half of the lake. A secchi disk could be seen in the water water up to a depth of 6 feet. Lake survey test nets indicate that White Sucker and Northern Pike numbers are very good. A fair Yellow Perch population is present, but the Walleye population is low. Largemouth Bass and Black Crappie are also present; however, their numbers were below respective state-wide medians.A cabin and boat are located on the southeast lake shore. There also is an unblazed trail over USFS land that leads to a public access on the southwest lake shore. No signs are present which designate the access as public.</p>",
