                "narrative": "<p>Ham Lake is a small, bog stained lake connected to the east side of Fishtrap Lake.  The lake has little development and the south shore has been protected as part of a Scientific and Natural Area.  Almost the entire shoreline of the lake is floating bog/wet meadow plant communtity except at the access and homeowner's boat dock.  Anglers gain access to the lake off of the side of road on the west shore of the lake.  Black crappies, bluegills, northern pike, and largemouth bass draw most of the anglers to the lake.  Fishing pressure seems to be highest in winter and late spring.      Despite the high abundance of several of the panfish species, nice size fish were common.  A fair number of the bluegills and pumpkinseeds were over 6 inches in length while the average size of the black crappies was 9 inches.  Quality size largemouth bass can be found with some luck and patience.  Ham Lake also has some nice size northern pike with an average size of just under 2 pounds seen in the survey.  Yellow perch numbers were normal when compared to similar type lakes and were small by most anglers standards.  Perch can be an important food species for the northern pike and bass in the lake.  They can also be instrumental in helping maintain a well balanced bluegill population with fast growing, quality individuals.    All three species of bullheads, black, brown, and yellow, were seen in the survey.  Yellow bullheads were the most abundant of the bullheads and all of the species had quality size fish over 11 inches in the survey catches.  Other fish species in the fish community include bowfin or dogfish, hybrid sunfish, and white suckers.         Neascus or black spot was common on the bluegills.  Neascus is a tremode or parasite that is usually found in the skin of the fish.  The life cycle of the parasite also includes snails and fish-eating birds, such as herons and bitterns.  Skinning the fish removes most of the parasites and cooking will kill the rest.  Humans can not be infested.    With the small size of Ham Lake, heavy fishing pressure can easily change the size structures of some of the fish populations.  Anglers are encouraged to harvest small northern pike under 24 inches in length and release the larger ones.  Limiting harvest of the larger panfish is also encouraged to maintain a balanced fish community.  </p>",

A DECREASE IN NET CATCH IS EVI DENT BUT IS NOT CONSIDERED SIGNIFICANT.  GROWTH RA TES ARE NORMAL AMONG THE SEVERAL AGE GROUPS PRESEN T.  BLUEGILL NUMBERS ARE ALSO AVERGE, HOWEVER, AVE RAGE SIZE IS SMALL FALLING BELOW THE 1ST  QUARTILE .  THE MEDIAN LENGTH IS ONLY 4.0-4.4 INCHES. THE P OPULATION APPEARS TO HAVE DECLINED WHEN COMPARED T O 1985 AS THE NET CATCH HAS DROPPED 87%.  AVERAGE WEIGHT HAS ALSO DECREASED FROM 0.14 POUNDS IN 1985 TO 0.08 POUNDS CURRENTLY.  BLACK CRAPPIE OCCUR IN THE NET CATCH IN AVERAGE NUMBERS.  MEAN SIZE IS N ORMAL.  THE EIGHT FISH SAMPLED DURING THE ASSESSMENT WERE ALL BETWEEN 7.9 AND 8.9 INCHES IN LENGTH.  NET CATCHES MAY BE LIMITED DUE TO THE FIS H BEING SUSPENDED IN THE WATER COLUMN.  LARGEMOUTH BASS WERE NOT SAMPLED USING SELECTIVE GEAR (TRAPN ETS) THOUGH FISHERMEN REPORT FAIR ANGLING SUCCESS. TRAPNETS OFTEN FAIL TO ADEQUATELY ASSESS LARGEMOUT H BASS POPULATIONS.  ALTERNATIVE METHODS SUCH AS E LECTROFISHING MAY BE NECESSARY TO ACCURTELY DESCRI BE THE POPLATION.  A SINGLE SMALL LARGEMOUGH BASS WAS CAPTURED DURING THE NATURAL REPRODUCTION CHECK .  YELLOW PERCH APPEARED IN AVERAGE NUMBERS AND NO RMAL MEAN SIZE FOR THIS LAKE CLASS.  NO NGE IN NUMBRS HAS OCCURRED SINCE 1985.  PUMPKINSEE D, BOWFIN, AND THREE SPECIES OF BULLHEAD ARE ALSO FOUND IN THE NET CATCH.  PUMPKINSEED, BROWN BULLHE AD, AND BLACK BULLHEADS ARE ALL PRESENT IN HIGH NUMBERS.  BLACK BULLHEAD NET CATCHES HAVE INCREASE D DRAMATICALLY SINCE 1985. BOWFIN, YELLOW BULLHEAD ,  AND PUMPKINSEED NUMBERS HAVE REMAINED FAIRLY ST ABLE.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>      A panfish assessment was conducted in early June to evaluate the bluegill and black crappie populations in Ham Lake.  Most of the fishing pressure on Ham Lake appears to be targeted at those two panfish species.  Five lake survey trap nets were set and lifted twice for a total of ten net lifts.  Past lake surveys have been done on Ham Lake in early June with 2 gill nets and six trap nets.   <br> \n      The 2010 panfish assessment captured 179 bluegill (17.9/TN) between 3.1 and 7.8 inches in length.  Mean length for the sample was 5.8 inches and modal length 6 - 6.5 inches.  Bluegill exceeding seven inches accounted for 10% (n=18) of the catch.  Ages 3 through 10 were represented in the 2010 bluegill catch.  Fifty percent (50%) of the fish appeared to be from the 2001 and 2002 year classes.  Ages 6 and 7 displayed slow growth and the other age groups normal growth when compared to an area mean back-calculated length table. <br> \n      A population assessment was conducted in early June of 2002.  A total of 348 bluegill were sampled in the six trap nets (58/TN).  The fish measured from 3.3 to 8.9 inches in length with a mean length of 6.2 inches.  The modal length was the same as in the 2010 assessment,( 6 -6 .5 inches), however, bluegill larger than seven inches accounted for 33% (n=115) of the catch.  The 2002 gill nets caught seven bluegill, one of which was 9.1 inches in length.  The lake management goals for Ham Lake are to have a bluegill population characterized by 30 - 60 fish per trap net with at least 33% of the catch exceeding seven inches in length.  Variable bluegill trap net catch rates appear to be the norm in Ham Lake as the 1990 population assessment had a catch rate of 19/trap net while the 1985 survey catch rate was 145/trap net.   <br> \n      Black crappie catches have also varied between the netting efforts.  Twenty-five crappie (2.5/TN) were sampled in the 2010 panfish assessment.  The fish measured from 6 to 11.2 inches in length with a mean length of 8.3 inches.   Modal length for the catch was 8 - 8.5 inches and six of the crappie (24%) were more than 9 inches in length.  Ages 3 through 5 and 7 were represented in the crappie catch with all ages showing normal growth.  The majority of the crappie came from the 2005 year class which accounted for 57% of the catch.   <br> \n      The 2002 panfish assessment was more successful at sampling crappie, catching 46 fish (7.7/TN) which displayed a more desirable population size structure.  The fish ranged from 4.8 to 10.5 inches in length, with a mean length of 9.1 inches.  The modal length was an inch longer at 9 - 9.5 inches and 63% (n=29) of the fish exceeded 9 inches in length.  The 1990 population assessment sampled three crappie (1.5/TN) while the 1985 survey caught only one crappie (0.5/TN).  Results from the 2010 crappie catch were below the desired management goal of having at least 30% of the catch more than nine inches in length. <br> \n      Three other panfish species were also sampled in the 2010 panfish assessment.  Fifty-one pumpkinseed sunfish between 4.5 and 7.6 inches, and 14 hybrid sunfish ranging from 5.5 to 8.1 inches in length as well as a single seven-inch green sunfish.   The trap net catch also included three northern pike between 11 and 30 inches in length.  Black bullhead, bowfin, brown bullhead, yellow bullhead, and yellow perch were also captured in the 2010 panfish assessment.   <br> \n      Ham Lake is a small lake.  The gill nets from previous surveys provided more information on the northern pike and yellow perch populations while the trap nets caught panfish and bullhead.   The 2010 panfish assessment did show that there was a range of sizes in the northern pike population although they were not the target species.   Future assessments will likely target certain species such as largemouth bass and panfish as they are the primary species targeted by anglers. <br> \n</p>",
