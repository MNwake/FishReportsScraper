                "narrative": "<p>Indian (Leesburg) Lake is located 4.5 miles northwest of Akeley in Hubbard County. It is a small lake (49 acres) with a maximum depth of 36 feet. The lake basin is oblong and steep along the east and west shorelines with shallower areas at the ends. A county-owned public access is located on the northeast shore. Based on physical and chemical characteristics, Indian is in Lake Class 28; other local lakes in this class include Shingobee, Emma, Nagel, and Little Blueberry. The lake is managed primarily for northern pike, with largemouth bass, bluegill, black crappie, and yellow perch as secondary species.  Northern pike are abundant in Indian Lake, but sizes tend to be small, with an average length of 19 inches. On the average, a 19 inch northern pike would be three years old, but northerns from this lake did not reach this length until 5 years of age. The slow growth rates indicate competition for limited food. The primary fish prey for northern pike in this lake is yellow perch. Perch abundance was low in gill nets, with a mean length of 7.9 inches. Bluegill were another species with high numbers and slow growth. The proportion of bluegills over 7 inches was very low. Good spawning conditions for panfish, coupled with the small size of the lake, lead to overpopulation of bluegill and competition for limited food.  Largemouth bass were abundant in trap nets; normally bass tend to avoid this type of sampling gear. The catch consisted of fish eleven inches or less, and growth was slow. Bass are normally a good predator to control high bluegill populations but in order to be effective there need to be good numbers of bass 12\" or larger.  Other species sampled in 2000 included pumpkinseed and yellow bullhead, both at high abundance, and walleye. Indian Lake does not have the characteristics necessary to support a good walleye fishery, and this species is not stocked here by the DNR.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Indian (Leesburg) Lake is located 4.5 miles northwest of Akeley in Hubbard County.  Indian Lake is small, only 49 acres, and has a maximum depth of 36 feet.  The lake basin is oblong and steep along the east and west shorelines with shallower areas at the ends.  A county-owned public access with an earthen ramp is located on the northeast shore.  Indian Lake provides fishing opportunities for northern pike, largemouth bass, and panfish. <br> \n <br> \nThe Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics.  Indian Lake is in lake class 28.  Other area lakes in this same class include Big Bass, Emma, Gilmore, and Thomas. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers will find good numbers of northern pike in Indian Lake, however, small \"hammer handle\" pike dominate the population.  Sampled northern pike had a mean length and weight of 19.3 inches and 1.7 pounds, with pike measured up to 30.0 inches.  Northern pike growth rates were slow when compared to class 28 and other area lakes.  Northern pike forage is primarily limited to yellow perch and panfish in Indian Lake.  Yellow perch were sampled in low numbers, similar to past surveys. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers will find good numbers of largemouth bass and an abundant bluegill and pumpkinseed population.  Largemouth bass up to 19.7 inches were sampled.  Bluegill are small, with most fish in the 5-6 inch size range, while pumpkinseed are larger with fish in the 6-8 inch size range.  Bluegill growth rates are slow when compared to class 28 and other area lakes.  Black crappie were sampled in low numbers, similar to past surveys. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance (2.5 walleye/gillnet) was within the range \"typical\" for this lake class.  Sampled walleye range in length from 13.2 to 23.1 inches.  Walleye were sampled in low numbers (2 walleye) in the 2000 survey and have not been sampled in any other survey on Indian Lake.  Walleye have not been stocked by the DNR into Indian Lake. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled included moderate numbers of yellow bullhead, and low numbers of brown bullhead. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Indian Lake is located three miles northwest of Akeley in southeastern Hubbard County. Indian has a surface area of 51 acres and a maximum depth of 36 feet. A county owned public access is located on the north shore of the lake off Hillview Road, but this access is narrow with limited space for parking. Indian provides angling opportunities for Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, and panfish. <br> \nThe Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics. Indian is in class 28. Class 28 lakes are generally small, have hard water that is very clear and regularly shaped. Other class 28 lakes in the work area include: Big Bass, Dinner, Emma, Gilmore, Little Blueberry, Nagel, Newman, Shipman, and Thomas. <br> \nNorthern Pike abundance was high, in line with recent surveys. Anglers will find Northern Pike from 15 - 26 inches in length. Northern Pike sampled had an average length of 20 inches and weighed 1.6 pounds. <br> \nLargemouth Bass were sampled in good numbers again in 2022.  They had a small average length of 8.3 inches, with the longest sampled at 15.7 inches.   <br> \nOnly a few crappies were sampled in this survey, with the largest at 10 inches. Indian also provides fishing for Bluegill and Pumpkinseed; with most fish under 8 inches. Although sampled in very low numbers, perch of suitable size are available for anglers to target. <br> \nCurrently, no Aquatic Invasive Species (AIS) have been identified in Indian Lake. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access.</p>",

It has a maximum depth of 36 feet with 42 percent shallower than 15 feet.  Shoal water soils are mainly rock with some muck and sand present.  The shoreline gradient is very steep on either end of the lake.Fish taken during test netting in numbers that exceeded the statewide median catch per set were: white sucker, yellow bullhead, largemouth bass, pumpkinseed, and bluegill.  The bluegill were taken at a rate of about 54 times the statewide median, but were small in size.The only shoreline development at this time included two cabins and four boats.  There was one fish house located on this lake during the winter of 1962-1963.</p>",
