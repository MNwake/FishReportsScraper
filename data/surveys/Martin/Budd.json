                "narrative": "<p>Budd Lake has changed substantially since it was reclaimed in 1967.  Typically after a lake is reclaimed, the vegetation and fish populations do very well.  Unfortunately, the vegetation begins to decline and the fish populations follow by leveling off.  In addition, improved fishing often attracts even more fishing pressure which can sometimes lead to over-harvest.       The number of walleye is about average for lakes similar to Budd Lake.  However, the majority of the walleye are less than 15 inches.  The absence of larger walleye is also an indication that Budd Lake receives substantial fishing pressure.  Walleye growth is slow compared to many other lakes in our area.  Therefore, it takes walleye in Budd Lake longer to reach a size anglers prefer (15 inches and longer).     Largemouth bass are present in Budd Lake but the population is low.  The decline in vegetation has probably hurt the largemouth bass population.     Yellow perch commonly spawn on over-hanging and fallen trees and as a result, they are the only panfish that has not been seriously affected by the decline in vegetation.  Yellow perch numbers have decreased since 1984, but they are still very abundant.  Yellow perch ranged from 5 to 10 inches and will hopefully provide some good fishing for the next few years.  Yellow perch are also important to Budd Lake because they are one of the main food items for other fish.     If you are interested in sunfish, Budd may not be a bad choice of lakes.  But you will probably not catch a lot of any one species.  There are self-sustaining populations of black crappie, white crappie, and bluegill; however, without much vegetation, their numbers will probably remain low.  Aquatic vegetation is very important for young-of-the-year panfish.  Vegetation provides the adults with cover while they spawn and helps protect the young from predators throughtout the summer.</p>",

The seine hauls captured five species of fish, including Bluegill (N=4), Spottail Shiner (N=16), Spotfin Shiner (N=132), Yellow Perch (N=2), and Fathead Minnow (N=1). Electrofishing captured five species of fish, including Johnny Darter (N=3), Black Bullhead (N=1), Bluegill (N=17), Green Sunfish (N=8), and Yellow Bullhead (N=2).  The types of species and their respective abundances in nearshore IBI sampling will be used to determine the overall health of Budd Lake.  The IBI score will provide insight into the quality of habitat and water within the lake and can indicate problems within the watershed that could adversely affect the fish community.   <br> \n <br> \nAn assessment of lakeshore habitat on Budd Lake was conducted on 8/14/2017.  The assessment consisted of 35 survey sites evenly spaced 100 meters around the lake.  The average lake wide habitat score was 57.9(+/- 2.9), indicating overall lakeshore habitat quality was low (50-65).  Sites with low habitat quality are typically developed and have a lower than expected amount of natural habitat. Vegetation has been removed from at least a portion of the shore frontage either in a small percent of all the canopy layers or from a large percent of at least one canopy layer (ex. shrub layer has been removed but trees and natural ground cover remain high).  Approximately 100 percent of the sites were developed with a mean score of 52.3(+/- 3.6), while undeveloped sites had a mean score of 0(+/- 0).  This habitat survey was designed to provide a means to quantify and compare lakeshore habitat between lakes.  The Budd Lake shoreline habitat score is lower than the statewide lake score average of 73.6. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Budd Lake is a class 24 lake located within the city of Fairmont.  Budd Lake is managed primarily for walleye and secondarily for yellow perch and bluegill.When the Budd Lake walleye population was compared to similar lakes, the population was about average.  Walleye numbers were slightly higher than in 1993 and the fish were also a little larger.  Walleye ranged from 10.6 to 22.6 inches and averaged 13.5 inches.  Walleye growth is quite slow for the first two or three years and then appears to improve.  Angling for walleye should be fair for the next couple years.Yellow perch numbers were similar to those observed in 1993.  When compared to similar lakes, the Budd Lake yellow perch population was higher than 75% of the other lakes.  Yellow perch ranged from 6.5 to 10.7 inches and averaged 9.1 inches.  After three years of growth, yellow perch almost averaged 9.0 inches.  Yellow perch fishing should be decent for many years if the habitat is not degraded.Bluegill numbers have been low ever since the vegetation decreased throughout the 1980's. Bluegill ranged from 3.9 to 8.0 inches and averaged 5.2 inches.  Bluegill do best when abundant vegetation exists and that is not the case in Budd Lake.  Therefore, the bluegill population will probably remain low unless vegetation can be increased.Anglers might also run into some black crappie, white crappie, and channel catfish while fishing Budd Lake.  These species occasionally produce a good year class of fish that should provide better fishing for a year or two.Since Budd Lake has limited vegetation, it is important to leave overhanging and fallen branches and trees for habitat.  Although yellow perch in particular like to spawn on this type of habitat, many other species can benefit from its presence.  For example, young bluegill, black and white crappie, and largemouth bass all will use this habitat.  Young fish use the cover to hide from predators and feed on the insects that live on the branches.  Many minnow species also spawn on this type of habitat.  In a lake were walleye grow slow, an increase in minnows could become an important part of  their diet.In order to promote and maintain healthy fish populations, pollution needs to be controlled.  Fish habitat is directly affected by water quality.  Nutrients, sediments and other waste can drastically alter the chemical and physical characteristics of a lake.  It is important to maintain, if not improve, the water quality of Budd Lake through watershed management.  People often associate water quality problems in a lake with land use practices in the watershed but lakeshore property owners also contribute to water quality problems.  For example, putting in sand beaches, removing trees and aquatic vegetation, fertilizing lawns, and mowing lawns down to the lakeshore can also be harmful.  Improved land use practices by everyone will help insure this fishery can be enjoyed by future generations.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Budd is a 222-acre lake with a maximum of 23 feet deep, located within the city limits of Fairmont in Martin County.  Budd Lake is just one of the five lakes in Fairmont that make up what is known as the \"Fairmont Chain of Lakes\".  Budd is managed primarily for walleye while yellow perch, crappie, and channel catfish are managed secondarily.   <br> \n <br> \nBased on the 2009 fish survey on Budd Lake, walleye numbers are typical of what we would see in lakes similar to Budd in water chemistry, depth, and size.  Lengths of walleye caught in our gill nets in 2009 ranged from 10.1 to 25.6 inches and averaged 17.2 inches.  Ages of walleye caught in our nets ranged from age 1 to age 15.  There is a good number of walleye in the 10 \u0013 12 inch range coming up in the fishery.  These fish were more than likely the result of a walleye fingerling stocking in 2008.  The Fairmont Chain of lakes, including Budd, are scheduled to get additional walleye fingerlings in the fall of 2010.   <br> \n <br> \nCrappie numbers are also typical of lakes similar to Budd.  Both black and white crappie are available to anglers in Budd Lake as well as the entire \"Chain\" of lakes.  Black crappie have 7-8  dorsal spines with dark splotches against a white background on their body.  White crappie have 5-6 dorsal spines and black splotches that form vertical lines on their bodies.  Lengths of black crappie caught in trap nets ranged from 6.3 to 10.3 inches and averaged 9.0 inches.  Lengths of white crappie caught in trap nets ranged from 8.3 to 9.9 inches and averaged 9.2 inches. <br> \n <br> \nResults from the 2009 fish survey indicated Budd Lake has high numbers of yellow perch available to anglers.  The gill net catch rate of 39.5 fish/net was the highest recorded in the history of netting on the lake.  Lengths of yellow perch caught in our gill nets ranged from 6.3 to 10.8 inches and averaged 7.6 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nThe Fairmont Chain of lakes was stocked once with channel catfish since the reclamation in 1967 when 31 adult catfish were stocked in Hall Lake in 1992.  We first started seeing channel catfish in fish surveys on Budd Lake in 1997 when one fish with a weight of 0.9 lbs was sampled in our nets.  The channel catfish gill net catch rate in 2009 was 6.2 fish/net compared to 4.0 in 2001 and 0.2 in 1997.  Lengths of channel catfish caught in gill nets in 2009 ranged from 12.5 to 26.2 inches and averaged 17.0 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nOther fish caught in our nets during the assessment in 2009 included bluegill, common carp, northern pike, and white sucker. <br> \n <br> \nTo maintain a healthy fishery in Budd Lake, we need to promote Best Management Practices (BMP\u0019s) within the watershed to help reduce nutrients entering the lake.  High nutrients and sediments in a lake can cause algae blooms and reduce water clarity. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Walleye have been managed for many years in the Fairmont chain-of-lakes. Past stockings have included Walleye fry, fingerling, yearlings, and adults. Essentially, whatever life stage of Walleye was available they would be stocked into the lakes. However, since 2019 the Fairmont chain-of-lakes has been stocked with Walleye fry from the Lake Sarah egg take operation. Other southwest Minnesota lakes saw good success when Walleye fry were stocked in the spring of 2023. Therefore, daytime electrofishing was conducted in September to determine if Walleye fry stocking was successful on Sisseton Lake, Budd Lake, and Hall Lake. One 15 minute station was done on each lake.  <br> \n <br> \nTwenty-seven age-0 Walleye were captured on Sisseton (N=16), Hall (N=5), and Budd (N=6) Lakes. Catch rates varied; 57.6 per hour on Sisseton Lake, 22.9 per hour on Budd Lake, and 20.0 per hour on Hall Lake. However, the overall catch rate for the chain-of-lakes after 45 minutes of electrofishing was 36.0 per hour. It has been determined from previous Minnesota age-0 Walleye electrofishing that a fall electrofishing catch rate over 30 per hour has a good chance of resulting in a fishable year-class of Walleye for anglers 2 or 3 years later. Additionally, the average length of Walleye was 8.1 inches in Sisseton Lake, 8.2 inches in Budd Lake, and 7.9 inches in Hall Lake. When Walleye reach lengths exceeding 6 inches in their first year of growth, observations from other lakes indicate there is a good chance that they will survive the winter and avoid predation. A gill net and trap net survey was conducted on Sisseton Lake in August 2023 and age-0 fish were very abundant with 10 out of 14 caught in gill nets from the newly stocked 2023 year class. There is a great chance that the 2023 Walleye year-class on the Fairmont chain-of-lakes may result in a respectable population for anglers.    <br> \n</p>",

THE 10-12 INCH FISH APPEARED VERY THIN WITH A 10.9 INCH FISH WEIGHING 0.3 LB. AND A 11.4 INCH FISH WEIGHING 0.4 LB. GILLNET CATCH RATES FOR WALLEYE HAVE DROPPED DRAMATICALLY BETWEEN 1984 AND 1989 WITH A GILLNET CATCH INDEX OF 17.5 FISH PER LIFT IN 1984 TO 2.00 FISH PER LIFT IN 1989. THE YELLOW PERCH PERCH GILLNET CATCH INDEX IS 2.3 TIMES THE STATE MEDIAN BUT 13% BELOW THE LOCAL MEDIAN. THE LENGTH FREQUENCY DISTRIBUTION RANGES BETWEEN 6.0 AND 9.9 INCHES WITH A DISTINCT MODE AT 7.0 INCHES. USING AN AGE LENGTH KEY, 85% OF THE CAPTURED YELLOW PERCH WERE ESTIMATED TO BE AGE 1 WITH A MEAN LENGTH AT TIME OF FIRST ANNULUS FORMATION OF 4.13 INCHES. COMPARED TO STATE MEAN GROWTH CHARTS, THEIR GROWTH RATE IS VERY GOOD THE BLACK CRAPPIE TRAPNET CATCH INDEX IS THE SAME AS THE STATE MEDIAN AND 58% BELOW THE LOCAL MEDIAN. THE LENGTH FREQUENCY DISTRIBUTION RANGES BETWEEN 6.5 AND 8.6 INCHES WITH A MODE AT 6.5 INCHES. ALL OF THE NETTED FISH WERE ESTIMATED TO BE AGE 1 WITH A MEAN TOTAL LENGTH AT THE TIME OF THE FIRST ANNULUS FORMATION OF 4.03 INCHES. COMPARED TO STATE MEAN GROWTH CHARTS, THEIR GROWTH RATE IS VERY GOOD. THE BLUEGILL TRAPNET CATCH INDEX IS 73% BELOW THE STATE MEDIAN AND 2.3 TIMES THE LOCAL MEDIAN. THE LENGTH FREQUENCY DISTRIBUTION RANGES BETWEEN 5.5 AND 8.1 INCHES WITH A MODE AT 6.0 INCHES. USING AN AGE-LENGTH KEY 79% OF THE CAPTURED BLUEGILL WERE ESTIMATED TO BE AGE 1 WITH A MEAN TOTAL LENGTH AT TIME OF FIRST ANNULUS FORMATION OF 3.13 INCHES. COMPARED TO STATE MEAN GROWTH CHARTS, THEIR GROWTH RATE IS VERY GOOD. SHORELINE SEINING PRODUCED 27 YOY BLUEGILL PER ACRE SEINED.

                "narrative": "<p>Budd Lake is a 222-acre lake located within the City of Fairmont, and is one of the five lakes collectively known as the \"Fairmont Chain of Lakes\".  Budd Lake is managed primarily for Walleye and secondarily for Bluegill, Crappie, Yellow Perch, and Channel Catfish.  Muskellunge were introduced into the Fairmont Chain of Lakes in the fall of 2015 to provide an apex predator and an additional angling opportunity.  A survey was conducted the week of August 14, 2017 to monitor fish populations using three gill nets and nine trap nets.   <br> \n <br> \nThe Walleye catch rate in 2017 was 1.0 per gill net, which is the second lowest catch rate on record and is below the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (1.2 to 6.3 per gill net).  Despite Walleye fingerling stocking efforts in the last several years, Walleye catch rates have averaged just 2.6 per gill net since 1989.  Lengths of Walleye ranged from 9.7 to 28.9 inches and averaged 15.6 inches.  Walleyes are present in Budd Lake, but may be difficult to catch because of their low abundance.   <br> \n <br> \nThe Bluegill catch rate increased from 1.3 per trap net in 2009 to 6.0 per trap net in 2017 but was lower than the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (7.5 to 62.5 per trap net).  Since 1984 Bluegill catch rates have averaged 5.7 per trap net.  Bluegill lengths ranged from 6.3 to 8.6 inches and averaged 7.6 inches.  While not highly abundant, the average size of Budd Lake Bluegill should attract some anglers.  <br> \n <br> \nIn 2017, the Black Crappie catch rate was 20.0 per gill net, which is the highest observed catch rate for Black Crappie since 1984.  Black Crappie lengths ranged from 6.0 to 11.1 inches and averaged 8.9 inches.  White Crappie were sparse as only seven were sampled between the two gears.  This strong year class of Black Crappie should provide good angling for the next couple of years.  <br> \n <br> \nThe Yellow Perch catch rate decreased drastically from 39.5 per gill net in 2009 to 0.7 per gill net in 2017.  The 2017 catch rate of 0.7 per gill net is below the long term average of 27.4, and is below the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (2.00 to 27.9 per gill net).  Yellow Perch and Yellow bass may compete for similar resources, which may be an explanation for the decline in Yellow Perch.  <br> \n <br> \nDespite not stocking Channel Catfish, their abundance has steadily increased in Budd Lake from 0.3 per gill net in 1997 to 4.0 per gill net in 2001 to 6.3 per gill net in 2009 to 14.7 per gill net in 2017.  Lengths of Channel Catfish ranged from 15.0 to 27.5 inches and averaged 21.2 inches.  Channel Catfish should provide steady angling action in Budd Lake.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow Bass were first detected in the Fairmont Chain of Lakes in February 2013.  The 2017 catch rate of Yellow Bass was 5.7 per gill net, which indicated that the population may be increasing.  Lengths of Yellow Bass ranged from 6.4 to 10.5 inches and averaged 8.6 inches.  Two year classes of Yellow Bass were sampled, based on the length frequency histogram, but were not aged.  It appears that Yellow Bass are perpetuating in the Fairmont Chain of Lakes; however, it is unknown what effects they will have on the native fish community.   <br> \n <br> \nFreshwater Drum abundance has remained relatively stable since 1997, but the 2017 catch rate decreased to 17.7 per gill net, with lengths ranging from 6.8 to 14.1 inches and averaging 10.1 inches.  Other species sampled included Common Carp (3.9 per trap net), Northern Pike, Quillback, and White Sucker. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Budd Lake is a 227-acre, relatively deep southern Minnesota lake, located within the City of Fairmont in Martin County, and is one of five lakes in a chain of lakes collectively known as the \"Fairmont Chain of Lakes\".  The Fairmont Chain of Lakes is an impoundment of Center Creek which is a tributary to the Blue Earth River and includes, from upstream to downstream, Amber Lake (182 acres, 19 feet max depth), Hall Lake (548 acres, 27 feet max depth), Budd Lake (227 acres, 23 feet max depth), Sisseton Lake (138 acres, 19 feet max depth), and George Lake (83 acres, 11 feet max depth).  Budd Lake is managed primarily for Walleye and Muskellunge and secondarily for Yellow Perch, Bluegill, and Crappie.  Muskellunge are a recently new introduction to the Fairmont Chain of Lakes with an initial fingerling stocking in 2016 followed by another fingerling stocking in the fall of 2018.  Muskellunge provide a much needed top predator and biological control for undesired species.  They are also a great addition to angling in southern Minnesota.  A survey was conducted the week of August 10, 2020 to check on the fish community using 3 gill nets and 8 trap nets.   <br> \n <br> \nWALLEYE <br> \n <br> \nAs for most Minnesota Lakes, Walleye are the desired species by most anglers and provide many angling hours.  Over the past 20 years on Budd Lake four netting surveys (2001, 2009, 2017, and 2020) revealed that Walleye abundance has been low in Budd Lake ranging from 0.6 to 2.5 per gill net since 2001.   However, the 2017 and 2020 surveys indicate a stable population with 1 per gill net in each year.  In 2020, the population was dominated by Age-1 Walleye that were stocked as fry in 2019.  In addition to the young Walleye caught in gill nets, 5 of 6 Walleye caught in the trap nets (0.75 per trap net) were also Age-1. The Age-1 Walleye ranged from 9.5 to 10.3 inches and had an average body size compared to other lakes.  The Walleye appear to be doing well and finding adequate forage.  It appears the Walleye population is primed for good things in the coming years as Walleye fry stocking seems successful.  Walleye fry stocking was re-initiated in 2019 after many years of fingerling stocked Walleye.  The 2020 stocking of Walleye fry was missed due to COVID-19 pandemic restrictions but Walleye fry will be stocked annually starting in 2021.  Ice-angling reports in 2020 suggest that Walleye fishing is slow, but steady, and some larger fish were being caught that were not sampled in the gill nets and trap nets.  Overall, the Fairmont Chain of Lakes is making a resurgence as a decent Walleye angling opportunity after some years of a suppressed population.  Some of this resurgence can be attributed to an increase in the forage base.  Several species of shiner minnows were found during nearshore sampling on Budd Lake as well as the entire Fairmont Chain of Lakes over the past 3 years.  Continued presence and recovery of a reliable forage base should result in good Walleye fishing.   <br> \n <br> \nMUSKELLUNGE <br> \n <br> \nMuskellunge were first introduced to the Fairmont Chain of Lakes unsuccessfully in 1968 following a fish poisoning (rotenone) reclamation project in 1967.  Those Muskellunge were stocked as fry (approximately 10,000 individuals) and do not survive well (less than 1%).  Since 1968, no Muskellunge were reported as a result of that stocking.  Additionally, the fish toxicant reclamation project had minimal success and undesirable species (Common Carp, Bigmouth Buffalo, Freshwater Drum, and Black Bullhead) continued to be abundant.  Additionally, Yellow Bass were illegally introduced (most likely from an Iowa Lake and brought in via a bucket) in the Fairmont Chain of Lakes, with several first found in 2013, and have since established a self-sustaining population.  In order to help control the undesired fish populations and provide an additional angling opportunity, Muskellunge were re-introduced in 2016.  Three hundred and fourteen Muskellunge fingerlings (over 10 inches but less than 15 inches) were stocked in 2016 and again in 2018 (also 314).  The planned 2020 fingerling stocking was cancelled due to COVID-19 pandemic disruptions to egg-take and hatchery operations, but stocking will occur in 2021.  Muskellunge fingerlings have proven to be successful in other similar Minnesota Lakes.  Since 2016, no Muskellunge have been sampled in gill nets or trap nets but anglers have reported catching several Muskellunge of various sizes all the way up to 35 inches!  A Muskellunge specific trap net survey with large frame trap nets will be conducted in the spring of 2023 to assess the stocking program.  Additional stocking of fingerling Muskellunge will be continued in 2021.   <br> \n   <br> \nPANFISH (Including Yellow Perch, Bluegill, Crappies, and Yellow Bass) <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch, Bluegill, and Crappies (Black Crappie and White Crappie) are common panfish species in the Fairmont Chain of Lakes.  During the 2020 survey, 39 Yellow Perch, 67 Bluegill, and 91 Crappie (90 Black Crappie and 1 White Crappie) were caught in gill nets and trap nets.  All catch rates (Yellow Perch = 11.0 per gill net and 0.75 per trap net, Bluegill = 0.33 per gill net and 8.25 per trap net, Black Crappie = 0.33 per gill net and 11.13 per trap net, and White Crappie = 0.13 per trap net), except for White Crappie, were within normal ranges.  Yellow Perch ranged in length from 6.7 to 9.9 inches, Bluegill ranged in length from 4.1 to 9.3 inches, and Black Crappie ranged in length from 7.4 to 10.9 inches.  Most fish of all the panfish were at a size most anglers would be satisfied with and could harvest some for a meal.  Since Yellow Bass have become established in the Fairmont Chain of Lakes there has been concern that Yellow Perch, Bluegill, or Black Crappie would be outcompeted for resources but it appears that they are able to thrive.  Currently, Yellow Bass average just over 8 inches and range from 5.9 to 10.3 inches.  They are the most abundant panfish in Budd Lake with a catch rate of 54.7 per gill net and 8.1 per trap net.  These catch rates are the highest ever observed for Budd Lake. Additional survey work on the other lakes in the chain, and a repeat survey in 2024 on Budd Lake will continue to shed light on the potential interactions among panfish species.  However, right now, an excellent angling opportunity exists on the Fairmont Chain of Lakes for all panfish species.  <br> \n <br> \nOTHER SPECIES <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled in 2020 were Bigmouth Buffalo (1 fish), Channel Catfish (9 fish), Freshwater Drum (136 fish), Northern Pike (7 fish), White Sucker (7 fish), Common Carp (13 fish), and Quillback sucker (2 fish).  Bigmouth Buffalo and Northern Pike were caught at rates less than normal comparted to other Minnesota lakes, White Sucker and Common Carp catch rates were within normal ranges, and Freshwater Drum were caught at a rate greater than normal.  There are no established quartiles for Channel Catfish and Quillback sucker, but the Channel Catfish catch rate (2.33 per gill net) was down from 2017 (14.67 per gill net ) and the Quillback sucker catch rate was similar to 2017 (1 fish in 2017).  Channel Catfish (18.0 to 23.8 inches) and Northern Pike (17.4 to 29.2 inches) were harvestable size.  The Northern Pike statewide zonal regulation is in effect on the Fairmont Chain of Lakes an allows anglers to keep 2 Northern Pike if they are over 24 inches in length.  Northern Pike and Muskellunge (protected up to 54 inches; only 1 Muskie harvested above 54 inches) can be difficult to differentiate, so make yourself familiar with each species defining features and follow regulations.  Check the Minnesota DNR website at www.mndnr.gov for information on each species by typing \"Muskellunge\" into the search box or by doing a Google search for Muskellunge identification.     <br> \n <br> \nSUMMARY <br> \n <br> \nWalleye numbers are low for a southern Minnesota lake and the fish that are present are young and small, however recovery can be slow.  However, a successful fry stocking occurred in 2019 that should speed up the recovery of good numbers of decent sized Walleye.  Additional Walleye fry stockings will be needed for several years to fully evaluate.  Re-evaluation will occur in 2024 with a repeat survey, however, the Fairmont Chain of Lakes will have a lake sampled every year with a new DNR survey rotation that will allow the lake to be monitored more closely.  Muskellunge are too young at this point to determine stocking effectiveness.  Each Muskellunge is tagged with a Passive Integrated Transponder (PIT) tag.  Therefore, more information on growth and survival will be noted during a large frame Muskellunge survey in 2023.  Currently, panfish including Yellow Perch, Bluegill, Black Crappie, and Yellow Bass dominate the Fairmont Chain of Lakes and should provide excellent angling.  Overall, the Fairmont Chain of Lakes, including Budd Lake, is a topnotch multi-species fishery that provides an excellent opportunity for all types of anglers. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Budd is a 224 acre lake located within the city of Fairmont in Martin County.  This lake has a maximum depth of 23 feet and is managed primarily for walleye and secondarily for yellow perch, bluegill, and channel catfish.  Much of the shoreline on Budd Lake and the other Fairmont lakes have had extensive development.  The substrates in Budd lake are predominately sand and gravel with rubble and boulder being rare.  The association of aquatic vegetation, natural reproduction, and recruitment of gamefish to the creel are highly related.  The Fairmont lakes have had very little vegetation or it has been inconsistent in abundance.  Walleye are to be stocked in alternating regimes of fry and fingerlings.  A resurvey was conducted during the week of August 13 , 2001 and utilized five gillnets, eight trapnets, and three seine hauls.Overall, the walleye numbers seem to be somewhat depressed.  The last 4 surveys have had catch rates in trap nets within the normal range.  Total lengths of walleyes captured in trapnets averaged 14.44 inches.  Growth is a little slower compared to other Windom area lakes, as it takes approximately three or four years for a walleye to reach 14 inches.  Both walleye fry and fingerling stockings have had some success.  Fall electrofishing, which is done to check if and how much natural reproduction does occur, revealed that it does happen, but infrequently.  Due to the surplus of fingerlings in the fall of 2001, walleyes (447 lbs) were stocked into Budd and Hall Lakes.  It will be slow fishing for walleyes for a few years until the fingerlings reach catchable size.The catch rate of yellow perch in gillnets was within the normal range but have been historically higher.  Total lengths of yellow perch captured in gillnets averaged 7.59 inches.  Four year classes (1997, 1998, 1999, and 2000) of yellow perch were captured with the 1998 and 1999 year class dominating.  Efforts to maintain the limited spawning habitat available (downed branches and submerged vegetation) and improve spawning habitat (tree reefs) should be encouraged.  It is probable that the yellow perch population will return to higher numbers as crappies numbers decline.The catch rate of bluegill in trapnets was within the expected range.  The bluegill population has been moderately successful at natural reproduction despite the lack of aquatic vegetation.  Total lengths of bluegill captured in trapnets averaged 6.65 inches.  Six different year classes (1995-2000) of bluegill were captured with the 1997 and 1998 year classes dominating the catch.  Bluegills need aquatic vegetation and sand substrates in order to be abundant.The catch rate of channel catfish in gillnets was by far the highest catch rate ever recorded.  Total lengths of channel catfish averaged 15.83 inches.  Five year classes (1990, 1994, 1996, 1997, and 1998) of channel catfish were captured while the 1997 year class dominated the catch.  Apparently climatic conditions and spawning habitat were ideal in 1997.  This year class of catfish was also observed in Amber, Hall, and Round lakes.  These fish can provide some great fishing during the dog days of summer. The catch rate of black crappie in trapnets was within the expected range.  Total lengths of black crappie in trapnets averaged 7.91 inches, with the population dominated by smaller individuals. The catch rate of white crappie in gillnets was above average and was the highest ever recorded.  Total lengths of white crappie in gillnets averaged 7.00 inches.  All of the year classes were from 1998, 1999, and 2000 with the 1999 dominating the catch.  Both black and white crappies tend to dominate the panfish population right now and could provide some great fishing and table fare.All of the surveys done since 1989 have had black bullhead catch rates below average.  However, common carp and freshwater drum catch rates are consistently high for the Fairmont chain of lakes.Other species captured in smaller numbers were bigmouth buffalo, golden shiners, yellow bullhead, largemouth bass, northern pike, and white suckers.To promote and maintain healthy fish populations, pollution and other inputs need to be controlled.  Fish habitats are directly affected by water quality.  Nutrient, sediment and other waste inputs can drastically alter the biological, chemical, and physical components of a lake.  It is paramount to maintain if not improve the current water quality of Budd Lake through watershed management to preserve this fishery for future generations to enjoy.Prepared by: Ryan Doorenbos                </p>",
