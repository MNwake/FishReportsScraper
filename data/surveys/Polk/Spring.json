                "narrative": "<p>Spring Lake is a small lake that supports a native bass-panfish community with stocked walleye adding an occasional \"bonus\" to the harvest of a few anglers.  Results of the 1996 fish community assessment indicate that the lake holds good numbers of panfish such as bluegill, black crappie and yellow perch.  Predatory fish like northern pike, walleye and largemouth bass are also present although they are naturally not as abundant as their prey, the panfish.  Large fish of any species were not abundant in Spring Lake.  This is likely due to fish being harvested from the lake as soon as they reach \"keeper\" size.  If anglers hope to be able to catch larger fish from the lake in the future, they must begin to practice catch and release now.  If most of the \"pretty good sized\" walleye or bluegill are taken home and filleted this year, where will the \"trophy\" size fish for future years be?Due to its location in an area with fewer permanent fishing lakes, Spring Lake does receive a fair amount of attention from anglers and fisheries managers.  The lake's size and proximity to the city of Lengby make input of sediment and nutrients from human activities a major concern.  Although the lakeshore is not as heavily developed as many larger lakes, a 136 acre lake like Spring Lake can not assimilate the nutrient loads many larger lakes receive without experiencing algae blooms and other symptoms of nutrient enrichment.  Every one in the watershed of Spring Lake needs to be aware that what they do will affect water quality in the lake.  Maintaining or improving on the lake's current water quality and habitat conditions will benefit all who enjoy fishing or swimming in the lake as well as those who just enjoy the beauty of the clear water and aquatic plants.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of nearshore species in Spring Lake was conducted July 6th, 2023, by Detroit Lakes Fisheries Staff.  The survey consisted of 10 sampling stations evenly spaced around the lake.  All stations were sampled with a backpack electrofishing unit, four stations were sampled with a 50-foot seine, and two stations were sampled with a 15-foot seine.  Three stations were not sampled with a seine because of dense vegetation, water being too deep or muck being too thick to effectively use a seine.  Nearshore sampling captured 12 species of native fish, which included two species that are intolerant of disturbance (Banded Killifish and Iowa Darter) and two species that are tolerant of disturbance (Green Sunfish and Fathead Minnow).  The three most common species captured during the nearshore survey in order of abundance were: Largemouth Bass, Johnny Darter, and Banded Killifish. <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore fish survey data was combined with the standard survey data from July 31st, 2023, to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based Index of Biotic Integrity (FIBI) score.  The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment.  In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g., Blackchin Shiner, Iowa Darter, and Rock Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g., Black Bullhead, Fathead Minnow, and Green Sunfish).  The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake.  For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.   <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to a watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.  Spring Lake is located in the Poplar River Watershed. <br> \n</p>",

Northern pike and panfish compose the majority of the catch and produce rather consistent fishing.  Some walleyes are caught and occasionally a large one in the 8 to 10 pound class are taken early in the season.  Fishing pressure at the time of the survey appeared to be light.  The most common type of angling is still fishing for panfish, trolling for northern pike with some still fishing for walleyes and casting for largemouth bass.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Spring Lake is a small lake that supports a native bass, panfish, and pike community along with a few Walleyes.  Results of the 2014 lake assessment indicate that the lake holds fair numbers of panfish such as Bluegill, Black Crappie, and Yellow Perch.  Predatory fish like Northern Pike, Walleye and Largemouth Bass are also present although they are naturally not as abundant as their prey.  Pike numbers were up in 2014 and the average size was good, as well, with a mean length of 24.4 inches and mean weight of 3.3 pounds.  The modest Walleye fishery is sustained by stocking since Walleye do not reproduce naturally in this lake due to the lack of acceptable spawning and rearing habitat. <br> \n <br> \nEven with good growth rates, in a small lake like Spring moderate amounts of fishing pressure can keep the average sizes of fish small unless anglers release a portion of the larger fish back into the lake.  Due to its location in an area with fewer permanent fishing lakes, Spring Lake receives a moderate or higher amount of angling pressure.  The lake's size and proximity to the city of Lengby make input of sediment and nutrients from human activities a concern.  Although the lakeshore is not as heavily developed as those of many larger lakes, a 134-acre lake like Spring cannot sustain large nutrient loads without experiencing algal blooms and other symptoms of nutrient enrichment.  Watershed residents need to be aware that what they do on their lands may affect water quality in the lake.  Maintaining or improving the lake's current water quality and habitat conditions can benefit all users of this lake.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Spring Lake is a small lake that supports a panfish and pike community along with a few Walleyes.  On 07/31/2023, the fish community of Spring Lake was surveyed.  Results of the 2023 lake assessment indicate that the lake holds fair numbers of panfish such as Bluegill, Black Crappie, and Yellow Perch.  Bluegill numbers have been increasing, but the size structure of individuals remains on the small side with an average length of five inches. Black Crappie captured during the survey ranged from seven to 11 inches.  Yellow Perch averaged six inches in length. <br> \n <br> \nPredatory fish like Northern Pike and Walleye were also present although they are naturally not as abundant as their prey.  Pike numbers were up in 2023 and the average size was good as well, with an average length of 24 inches.  The modest Walleye fishery is sustained by stocking since Walleye do not reproduce naturally in this lake due to the lack of acceptable spawning and rearing habitat.  Only five Walleye were captured in the 2023 assessment and these fish averaged a little over 19 inches.  No Largemouth Bass were captured during the 2023 survey, but this is a common occurrence with the sampling gear that was used. <br> \n <br> \nEven with good growth rates, moderate amounts of fishing pressure in a small lake like Spring can keep the average sizes of fish small unless anglers release a portion of the larger fish back into the lake.  Due to its location in an area with fewer permanent fishing lakes, Spring Lake receives a moderate or higher amount of angling pressure.  The lake's size and proximity to the city of Lengby make input of sediment and nutrients from human activities a concern.  Although the lakeshore is not as heavily developed, a 134-acre lake like Spring cannot sustain large nutrient loads without experiencing algal blooms and other symptoms of nutrient enrichment.  Watershed residents need to be aware that what they do on their lands may affect water quality in the lake.  Maintaining or improving the lake's current water quality and habitat conditions can benefit all users of this lake.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Spring Lake is a small lake that supports a native bass-panfish community and a few walleye.  Results of the 2005 lake survey indicate that the lake holds fair numbers of panfish such as bluegill, black crappie and yellow perch.  Predatory fish like northern pike, walleye and largemouth bass are also present although they are naturally not as abundant as their prey.  The modest walleye fishery is sustained by stocking since walleye do not naturally reproduce in this lake spawning habitat is rare).  Large fish of any species were not abundant in Spring Lake.  This is likely due to fish being harvested from the lake as soon as they reach \"keeper\" size.  Even with good growth rates, in a small lake like Spring, moderate amounts of fishing pressure can keep the average sizes of fish small unless anglers release a portion of the larger fish back to the lake.Due to its location in an area with fewer permanent fishing lakes, Spring Lake receives a fair amount of angling pressure.  The lake's size and proximity to the city of Lengby make input of sediment and nutrients from human activities a concern.  Although the lakeshore is not as heavily developed as many larger lakes, a 136 acre lake like Spring Lake can not sustain large nutrient loads without experiencing algae blooms and other symptoms of nutrient enrichment.  Watershed residents need to be aware that what they do may affect water quality in the lake.  Maintaining or improving the lake's current water quality and habitat conditions would benefit all who enjoy this lake.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>The historical netting data for Spring Lake is marked by extreme fluctuations in catch rates for a number of species.  The factors producing these fluctuations are not readily apparent.  Much of the shoreline drops off sharply and dissolved oxygen is often inadequate below 15 feet in the summer.  This condition requires test nets to be set in an unconventional manner, gillnets parallel to shore, for example.  It may be possible that net setting abnormalities are in some manner contributing to the unusual variability in net catches.  The erratic netting results make fish community dynamics difficult to interpret.  However, one association that netting data has consistently suggested is an inverse relationship between northern pike and yellow perch abundance.  In the current survey the northern pike gillnet catch declined significantly from the 1986 survey and is now well below the first quartile for this lake class (Schupp's #31), from 9.00/set in 1986 to 1.00/set in 1991.  Respectively, the yellow perch catch rate exploded from 5.57/set in 1986 to 95.5/set in 1991, far above the third quartile.  Bluegills also appear to have exploded in abundance between 1986 and 1991, from 1.50/trapnet to 65.38/trapnet.  Although bluegill growth rates are good, the length frequency median group is only 4.0-4.4 inches.  In the previous survey, when trapnet catches were only 1.50/set, the median length group was 8.0-8.4 inches.  Changes of this magnitude are difficult to accept at face value, and tend to lend credence to the notion that test net data is being distorted by some process related to the nature of the lake basin and the manner in which test nets are set.  Black crappies were sampled at a catch rate between the first and third quartile for this lake class.  They exhibit a slightly above-average growth rate.  Except for 1981, walleye fingerlings were stocked annually from 1980 through 1985 at two, three, and four times the normal rate in an effort to create a walleye fishery.  This stocking was largely unsuccessful in establishing a significant walleye population and was discontinued after 1985.  Walleye natural reproduction has been negligible and the 1.50/gillnet recorded in the current survey is primarily a remnant population of older fish.  The unsuccessful walleye stocking effort in the presence of an abundant yellow perch population, particularly 1982, when 201.3 yellow perch per gillnet were recorded, is another puzzling aspect of this lake.  One carp was collected in the current survey, the first one ever taken in test nets from this lake.</p>",
