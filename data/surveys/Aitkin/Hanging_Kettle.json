The supplemented 1986 year class made up about 50% of the walleye catch in both 1990 and 1994. No other year classes, including 1989, 1991 and 1992, are prevalent. Higher catches have occurred in the past when no stocking was conducted. The reason for lack of success in stocking is unknown. The lake may not be capable of maintaining more walleyes, predation on small walleyes may be intense, or the walleyes may be moving out of Hanging Kettle Lake as they mature. Bluegill abundance appears to be increasing.  However, bluegill growth rates have remained consistent over the last three nettings and 57% of the bluegills were at least 6.0 inches long, indicating a continued, good quality fishery. Black crappies have occurred in normal numbers and have grown at normal and consistent rates over the last three nettings. Yellow perch are abundant but small. Northern pike numbers are below the 1st quartile and the mean weight is above the 3rd quartile for lake class 29.  </p>",

The growth rates for northern pike and walleye are more than 20 percent slower than their respective statewide mean growth rates and are considered slow. Growth rates for all other species aged are considered good. Although catch rates for yep are above state and local medians the length distribution is skewed toward the small sizes, indicating predation may be limiting uniform recruitment into the larger size classes.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Walleye have been stocked regularly since 1986 with limited success. Diminishing catches in surveys over time prompted a change from fingerling stocking to fry in 2015. In 2019 0.7/net were caught compared to zero in the previous survey. While not a big jump in numbers, there was some survival. There was a mix of sizes from 8.2 to 20.5 inches, and they ranged in age from 1-9 years old. Similar lakes typically support a low density Walleye population, so Walleye stocking is likely to continue on this popular lake.  <br> \n <br> \nAnglers usually focus their efforts on panfish species. Black Crappie continue to be abundant but on the smaller side, as they have throughout the history of fisheries surveys. Only two crappie greater than ten inches were captured during this survey, although it is possible there are some larger fish given their abundance and longevity. For the second survey in a row fish up to ten years old were captured with several year classes identified indicating consistent annual recruitment. Bluegill decreased from the previous survey but were captured within the expected range for this type of lake. The lack of larger individuals of both of these species suggests that angler harvest may be one reason limiting the maximum size these fish can reach. Selective harvest is encouraged to preserve or enhance the quality of these valuable resources. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike abundance is above the expected range for similar lakes. Size was down a bit from 2013 but reasonable with an average of 20.1\" and 1.8 pounds and 12% of pike greater than 24\". Yellow Perch, an important forage species, were down in this survey, however, White Sucker were captured in typical numbers for this type of lake. Both species provide forage for this top predator. Larger pike play an important role in regulating survival and growth of various species. Anglers should consider releasing fish greater than 24\" to help protect the vital function these fish provide and to maximize the sporting benefit for multiple anglers by recycling these quality fish. <br> \n <br> \nMaintaining habitat is important for both fish and wildlife resources. In addition to maintaining a good aquatic vegetation community, coarse woody habitat such as fallen trees and branches offer additional habitat that should be left in place for the benefit of most fish species in Hanging Kettle Lake. While it can be inconvenient when a tree falls into one's dock or swimming area, consider moving it to an area along your shoreline that is clear of your activity, rather than removing it from the lake. Benefits of good habitat stewardship are often rewarded with good fishing. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Hanging kettle is a 300-acre lake located 4.5 miles south of Aitkin.  The public access is located on the west end of the lake off of highway 169.  The close proximity to town and the ease of access makes Hanging Kettle a popular destination for many anglers during both the summer and winter angling seasons.  This is the last lake in the Ripple River chain of lakes. From the outlet at Hanging Kettle, the Ripple River continues northward, through the city of Aitkin, and empties into the Mississippi River about 10 river miles downstream of the outlet. The water control structure near the outlet is a hazard to motor boat navigation in most years; however, canoe access is uninhibited downstream to the Mississippi River, and upstream to Diamond, Ripple, Elm Island and Sjodine Lakes.  <br> \n <br> \nThe northern pike population is above average for this lake class, with a reasonably good size distribution with 28% of the catch over 24 inches. There also appears to be plenty of yellow perch to provide forage for the pike, as well as the occasional walleye.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye were sampled in low numbers again, which is typical of most bass-panfish lakes in central Minnesota.  Hanging Kettle does not harbor many walleye and most of those found in the lake resulted from stocking.  Natural reproduction of walleye hasn't contributed significantly in any of the surveys since 1998, however, previously it did contribute to the population.  Higher level stocking rates were begun in 2006, but it is too soon to determine the efficacy of the program. <br> \n <br> \nThe black crappie population has increased since the survey in 2003.  Catch was above average, while size was below average for this lake type.  Growth rates are slow, which helps to explain the small size of the black crappie. Also, winter angling for black crappie at Hanging Kettle is very popular and it too exacts a toll on the numbers of larger crappie in the population. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill catch rates were average, and growth rates were good for Aitkin County.  The average size was also good for this lake type, with twenty percent of the bluegill sampled being over 7 inches in length.  Considering the reasonably good growth rate, the lack of bigger bluegills in the population suggest that their size distribution is truncated at about 7 inches, likely due to angling.  <br> \n <br> \nWhile Hanging Kettle is not noted for having memorable sized black crappie or bluegill, the abundance of these species and the ease of access makes this lake an ideal destination for that weekend outing with the kids. To improve the size distribution of the panfish, anglers are encouraged to exercise some prudence and release some of the larger fish they catch.  Recycling really works. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Hanging Kettle Lake is the most downstream member of the Ripple River chain of lakes and is located five miles south of Aitkin.  There is a public access with a concrete log ramp on the west side of the lake.  Small boats are able to navigate at normal water levels upstream to Diamond Lake, while canoes and similar craft can travel downstream approximately ten river miles to the Mississippi River. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye have been stocked regularly since 1986 with limited success.  No walleye were captured in 2013, indicating the current strategy is not achieving the desired result.  Similar lakes typically support a low density walleye population, so walleye stocking is likely to continue on this popular lake. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers usually focus their efforts on panfish species.  Black crappie continue to be abundant but small, as they have throughout the history of fisheries surveys.  Only one crappie greater than ten inches was captured during this survey, although it is possible there are some larger fish given their abundance and longevity.  Fish up to ten years old were captured with several year classes identified indicating consistent annual recruitment.  Bluegill were captured within the expected range for this type of lake.  Growth was similar to county averages and size was good, with 27% greater than 7\".  The lack of larger individuals of both of these species suggests that angler harvest is limiting the maximum size these fish can reach.  Selective harvest is encouraged to preserve or enhance the quality of these valuable resources. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike abundance is above the expected range for similar lakes.  Size was good with an average of 22.3\" and 2.7 pounds, with 24% of pike greater than 24\".  Important forage species, yellow perch and white sucker, were captured in typical numbers for this type of lake suggesting adequate forage for this top predator.  Larger pike play an important role in regulating survival and growth of various species.  Anglers should consider releasing fish greater than 24\" to help protect the vital function these fish provide and to maximize the sporting benefit for multiple anglers by recycling these quality fish. <br> \n <br> \nMaintaining habitat is important for both fish and wildlife resources.  In addition to maintaining a good aquatic vegetation community, coarse woody habitat such as fallen trees and branches offer additional habitat that should be left in place for the benefit of most fish species in Hanging Kettle Lake.  While it can be inconvenient when a tree falls into one's dock or swimming area, consider moving it to an area along your shoreline that is clear of your activity, rather than removing it from the lake.  Benefits of good habitat stewardship are often rewarded with good fishing. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of nearshore fish species in Hanging Kettle Lake was conducted on June 29, 2023 by Aitkin Area Fisheries staff.  Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at all ten sampling stations, but four stations were sampled from the boat due to site conditions. Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample two stations, a 15-foot seine was used at four stations, and site conditions prevented the use of seines at four station.  Nearshore sampling captured 19 species of fish including 4 species that were intolerant of disturbance (ie., Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, Rock Bass) and none that were tolerant of disturbance. <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore data were combined with trap net and gill net data from a June 2023 survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based IBI (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment.  In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g., Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, Rock Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g., Black Bullhead, Common Carp, Green sunfish).  The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake.  For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.   <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey indicates Hanging Kettle Lake is healthy as indicated by an exceptionally high FIBI score, well above the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes. Data from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to Mississippi River (Brainerd) Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A special gill net survey was conducted in 2011 to evaluate the walleye population.  The current stocking strategy began in 2006, and calls for fingerling stocking in alternate, even-numbered years, at a rate of 2 pounds per littoral acre.  Walleye catches from nine previous surveys have ranged from 0.7 to 7.0/gill net with mean and median values of 2.5 and 1.9, respectively.   The 2011 walleye catch of 0.5/gill net was the lowest recorded to date, and continued a trend of decreasing abundance since 1990 (R2 = 0.92), the last time the management goal of 3-6 walleye/gill net was achieved.  Each of the three fish aged, came from a different fingerling-stocked year class.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike abundance decreased to 5.7/gill net in 2011 (Wilcoxon signed rank test, P = 0.036), within the normal range for lake class 31.  Size was small, averaging just 18.7 inches and 1.4 pounds.  Age ranged from 1-7 years old, with the 2008 year class representing 70% of the catch (23 of 33 fish aged).  Fish growth was similar to the most recent survey and normal compared to county and statewide averages.   <br> \n <br> \nThe 2011 yellow perch catch of 5.0/gill net was similar to the most recent population assessment (2008) and within the second quartile for this lake class.  Age assessment identified four year-classes, with most fish (19 of 31) produced in 2008.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie abundance continues to be high (8.5/gill net), having been above the normal range for this lake type in 8 of 9 surveys to date.  Growth was similar to 2008, but below county and statewide averages, and no fish greater than 10\" were sampled.  Fish ranged from 2-10 years old, with the 2007 year-class (age-4) making up a large portion of the catch (20 of 51).</p>",

This survey was completed in addition to the standard resurvey conducted the week of June 24, 2013.  Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake (10 stations) and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible.  Species information was gathered as part of a statewide project to evaluate the fish Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) for Minnesota lakes.  <br> \n <br> \nBackpack electrofishing was completed at all 10 stations, but three sites were sampled from the boat due to unstable footing.  A 50-foot seine was used to sample 1 station, a 15-foot seine was used at 6 stations, and site conditions prevented the use of seines at 3 sites.  Nearshore sampling captured several non-game fish species including bluntnose minnow, common shiner, golden shiner, Johnny darter, spottail shiner and tadpole madtom.  The preliminary IBI score (per Drake and Pereira, 2002) calculated from this survey, and using standard gill net and trap net data from the resurvey, was 82. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Hanging Kettle Lake is a 300-acre lake located 5 miles south of the city of Aitkin and is the most downstream member of the Ripple River chain of lakes. The close proximity to town and ease of access makes Hanging Kettle a popular destination for anglers during both summer and winter angling periods.  There is a public access with a concrete log ramp on the west side of the lake. Small boats are able to navigate at normal water levels upstream to Diamond Lake, while canoes and similar craft can also travel downstream approximately ten river miles to the Mississippi River.  The water at Hanging Kettle is typically brown tannin stained and has a Secchi depth of about 8 ft during the period of our survey (late June).  Hanging Kettle is primarily managed for panfish and secondarily for Northern Pike and Walleye. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye fingerlings had been stocked regularly and with limited success since 1986.  In spite of this aggressive stocking regime the Walleye population plummeted. This lack of success of fingerling stocking prompted a change to fry stocking in 2015.  While still too soon to determine success, Walleye were once again observed in Hanging Kettle in the last two surveys. In 2023, 1.2 walleye/gill net were caught in the standard survey, compared with 0.7 per net in 2019 and zero in the 2013 survey. While not a big jump in numbers, there was some survival of multiple year classes. There was a mix of sizes from 15.5 to 22.4 inches, and they ranged in age from 4-9 years old, with 5 year classes observed. Similar lakes typically support a low-density Walleye population, and with fry stocking appearing to show some success, we will continue to stock fry into this popular lake and continue to monitor changes. In addition to the fry stocking, there is also some movement of fish from the up-river lakes and from downstream that may also contribute to the population of Walleye.  <br> \n <br> \nAnglers at Hanging Kettle often focus their efforts on panfish species. Black Crappie continue to be abundant but on the smaller side, as they have throughout the history of fisheries surveys on Hanging Kettle. Only one Crappie greater than 10 inches was captured during this survey, although it is possible there are some larger fish given their abundance and longevity. For the third survey in a row, fish up to ten years old were captured, several year classes were identified indicating consistent annual recruitment and growth analysis suggested they grow slower than what is typical for the Aitkin area. Bluegill abundance decreased from the previous survey but were captured within the expected range for this type of lake.  While there were some Bluegills over 8 inches in the survey, they were not to the level expected given their relative fast growth rates for the area.  The lack of larger individuals of both of these species suggests that angler harvest may be one reason the panfish are not reaching their maximum attainable size. Selective harvest is encouraged to preserve or enhance the quality of these valuable resources. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike abundance is above the expected range for similar lakes. Size was up a bit from 2019 with an average of 21.1 inches and 2.1 pounds, with 12 percent of pike greater than 26\". Yellow Perch, an important forage species, was similar in abundance to the 2019 survey, which was slightly below what might be expected for this lake type.  Another prey species, White Sucker was also captured in typical numbers for this type of lake. Both species provide forage for this top predator. Larger pike play an important role in regulating survival and growth of various species. Anglers should consider releasing larger fish to help protect the vital function these fish provide and to maximize the sporting benefit for multiple anglers by recycling these quality fish. <br> \n <br> \nMaintaining habitat is important for both fish and wildlife resources. In addition to maintaining a good aquatic vegetation community, coarse woody habitat such as fallen trees and branches offer additional habitat that should be left in place for the benefit of most fish species in Hanging Kettle Lake. While it can be inconvenient when a tree falls into one's dock or swimming area, consider moving it to an area along your shoreline that is clear of your activity, rather than removing it from the lake. Benefits of good habitat stewardship are often rewarded with good fishing. <br> \n</p>",

Yellow perch sampled (22 of 61 aged) ranged in age from three to five years of age with strong year classes indicated for 1985 and 1986.  The growth rates for the first, second and fourth increments were slower than normal. Walleye sampled (19 of 21 aged) ranged from four to eight years of age with a strong year class indicated for 1986 which corresponds to a stocking of 3,800 walleye fingerlings at twenty-five per pound.  Growth rates were normal. There was a significant increase in abundance, based on six gill nets, from 1985 to 1990 for both northern pike (2.5 per lift in 1985 to 9.8 per lift in 1990) and walleye (0.7 per lift in 1985 to 3.5 per lift in 1990). Based on tables, developed by Dennis Schupp, of relative percentages of change in numbers of gillnet caught fish which would be necessary to state with a relatively accurate statistical certainty, that a population has changed from one assessment to the next.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Consistent walleye stocking of fingerlings has failed to produce a consistent return as measured by gill net catch rates.   Of the eleven walleye caught in the 1998 survey, four were from year-classes where supplemental stocking occurred.  Only one fish was caught which could have come from the 1991 and 1992 stocked year-classes.  Successful natural reproduction is indicated by the presence of three walleyes from 1993 and one from the 1997 year-classes.  The highest catches occurred in 1977 when no stocking was conducted.  The reason for the lack of success in stocking is unknown.  The lake may not be capable of maintaining more walleyes, predation on small walleyes may be intense, or the walleyes may be moving out of Hanging Kettle Lake as they mature.  Bluegill abundance increased from 1990 to 1995.  Growth rates for bluegill have remained consistent from 1985 through 1995 with 57% of the bluegills at least 6 inches long, indicating a good quality fishery.  The 1998 assessment was by gill net and only three bluegill were caught.  The catch rate for black crappie has doubled since 1995.  Black crappie growth has remained stable over the last four nettings and the population shows good size structure with 36% of the fish over 8.5 inches long.  Yellow perch abundance has decreased since the last survey and growth remains slower than the statewide average.  Northern pike abundance has increased since the last assessment and is now above the second quartile for lake class 31.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Hanging kettle is a 300-acre lake located 4.5 miles south of Aitkin.  The public access is located on the west end of the lake off of highway 169.  The close proximity to town and the ease of access makes Hanging Kettle is a very popular destination for many anglers during both the summer and winter angling seasons.  Summer anglers are typically targeting the large predators such as northern pike and walleye.  Northern pike anglers will find plenty of fish to catch including some over 30 inches in length.  Anglers will find that the walleye fishing is a little more difficult than fishing for the plentiful northern pike but that it can be very rewarding for those who work at it.  Typical of most bass-panfish lakes in central Minnesota, Hanging Kettle does not harbor many walleye and most of those found in the lake are products of the stocking program.  But like many of these lakes, what it lacks for in numbers of walleyes it makes up for in size.Winter anglers who fish Hanging Kettle primarily target bluegill and black crappie.  Anglers will find that both of these species are plentiful and can be easily caught.  While Hanging Kettle is not noted for having memorable sized black crappie or bluegill, the abundance of these species and the ease of access makes this lake an ideal destination for that weekend outing you promised the kids.</p>",
