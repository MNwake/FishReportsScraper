High numbers of northern pike, bluegill and black crappie were present in 2000.  The average length of northern pike was 17.5 inches and ranged between 10.3 and 24.3 inches.  Black crappie averaged 6.2 inches and bluegill averaged 5.4 inches. Walleye abundance remains well below average for lakes of this type but some natural reproduction is occurring.  The average length was 19.1 inches and ranged from 9.3 to 27.2  inches.  About half of the aged walleye in the sample corresponded to years of fingerling or yearling stocking.  Rock bass, pumpkinseed, black bullhead and white sucker were also present in the fish community.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Caribou Lake is 546 acres, shallow lake (21ft maximum depth), with abundant vegetation, moderate to highly developed, and located just north of Duluth, MN.  A state owned, concrete back-in access is located on the north end of the lake and two other more primitive accesses are located on the south end.  Walleye and largemouth bass are the primary managed fish species.  Nearly 50,000 fingerlings and 2,600 yearlings have been stocked since 1993.    Although walleye abundance has gradually increased since the investigation in 1997 (1.2 fish per gillnet), a walleye abundance of 2.1 fish per gillnet in 2005 was still below average compared to Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Mean length was 19.3 inches with 88% of walleye 15 inches or greater.  The largest walleye captured was nearly 30 inches.  Growth was average compared to other Duluth Area populations.  Correlation of fish to stocked years was 71% in 2005.     Largemouth bass electrofishing catch rates of 28.9 per hour were near average (32.6 per hour) for Duluth Area bass populations.  Mean length was 12.1 inches with 74% of bass 12 inches or larger.  Growth was considered fast when compared to other Duluth Area bass populations.     Northern pike abundance was above average for Minnesota lakes with an average of 7.0 fish per gillnet.  Mean length was 19.5 inches, with 29% of northern pike greater than 21 inches.  Growth was slow for Duluth Area populations.  Based on age distribution, northern pike have produced year classes since 1985.     Black crappie abundance was 3.5 fish per trapnet and was average for Minnesota lakes of this type.  The mean length of black crappie was 5.7 inches, and growth was slow for Duluth Area populations.  Age analysis revealed good recruitment.     Bluegill abundance was average for Minnesota lakes at 6.0 fish per trapnet.  The mean length was 5.6 inches and maximum length was 8.8 inches.  Age analysis revealed good recruitment and slow growth.     Other fish species sampled included black bullhead, bluntnose minnow, pumpkinseed, rock bass and white sucker.  </p>",

Walleye and Largemouth Bass are the primary management species for Caribou Lake.   <br> \n <br> \nWalleye fingerlings are stocked every other year into Caribou Lake.  Walleye abundance of 6.3 per gillnet lift was average compared to other Minnesota Lakes but represented a historic high catch rate for Caribou Lake dating back to 1951.  Walleye average length was 17.9 inches.  Nearly 47% of the sample exceeded 18 inches in length.  Ninety three percent of Walleye aged corresponded to stocked year-classes.  The stocking program appears to be providing a quality walleye fishery in Caribou Lake at this time with several different year-classes available to anglers.   <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass were sampled during a spring electrofishing survey at a rate of 20.8 per hour.  Average length was 14.2 inches.  A quality bass fishery exists with 52% of the sample exceeding 15 inches. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike abundance of 11.7 per gillnet lift was up from recent years and still above average compared to other Minnesota Lakes.  Average size was small at 19.4 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie abundance of 3.3 per trapnet lift was average compared to other Minnesota lakes.  Average size was approximately 6 inches with some fish up to 10 inches sampled.  Bluegill abundance was above average at 17.8 per trapnet lift but size was small.  Average length was 6.2 inches and zero Bluegill sampled exceeded 9 inches.

                "narrative": "<p>Caribou is a 546 acre lake located just north of Duluth, MN with moderate to high development and a maximum depth of 21 feet.  A state owned, concrete back-in access is located on the north end of the lake and two other more primitive accesses are located on the south end. Walleye and largemouth bass are the primary fish species managed. Walleye fingerlings have been stocked in odd years since 1999.  In 2003, a special northern pike regulation was established that protected fish within the 24-36 inch size range.  Caribou Lake was last surveyed in 2005.  Caribou Lake was assessed during the summer of 2010 to update information about fish populations and to evaluate the effectiveness of the walleye stocking program.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance of 1.3 per gillnet lift was down from 2005 (2.1) and was below average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Walleye average length was 15.1 inches and growth was average when compared to other Duluth Area lakes.  Walleye from the 1999, 2002, 2003, 2005, 2007 and 2009 year-classes were present.  One-hundred percent of walleye aged corresponded to stocked year-classes indicating that natural walleye reproduction is not occurring.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike abundance of 11.4 per gillnet lift was up from 2005 (7.0) and above average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Northern pike average length was 20.6 inches and growth was slow compared to other Duluth Area lakes.  The percentage of northern pike longer than 21 inches has increased from 8 in 2000 to 29 in 2005 to 36 in 2010.  All year-classes from 2000 to 2009 were represented.   <br> \n <br> \nA total of 62 largemouth bass were sampled with electrofishing equipment.  The catch rate of largemouth bass was 114.3 fish per hour of electrofishing on-time.  Previous electrofishing catch rates for largemouth bass on Caribou have ranged from 18.9 in 1991 to 30.0 in 2005.  Largemouth bass average length was 14.0 inches and growth was average compared to other Duluth Area lakes.  All year-classes from 2000 through 2009 were represented in the sample.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie abundance of 7.1 per trapnet lift was up from 2005 (3.5) and was above average when compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Black crappie mean length was 6.8 inches and growth was slow when compared to other Duluth Area lakes.  All year-classes from 2002 to 200 were represented. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill abundance of 21.8 per trapnet lift was up from 2005 (6.0) and was above average when compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Average length of sampled bluegills was 5.9 inches and growth was slow compared to other Duluth Area lakes.  All year-classes from 2001 through 2007 were represented, with a strong 2002 year-class.   <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch abundance of 5.3 per gillnet lift was up from 2005 (3.6) and was average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Average length of perch was 6.3 inches.  Only 2% of the perch captured were greater than 8 inches in length. <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species sampled include hybrid sunfish, pumpkinseed, rock bass and white sucker.    <br> \n <br> \nCaribou Lake was included in an index of biotic integrity (IBI) assessment in 2010.  In addition to standard gillnets and trapnets, beach seines and backpack electrofishing equipment were used to index species richness of the nearshore lake habitat.</p>",

Walleye and Largemouth Bass are the primary management species for Caribou Lake.   <br> \n <br> \nWalleye fingerlings are stocked every other year into Caribou Lake.  Walleye abundance of 4.3 per gillnet lift was average compared to other Minnesota Lakes but represented a historic high catch rate for Caribou Lake dating back to 1951.  Walleye average length was 16.7 inches and 1.6 pounds.  Nearly 40% of the sample exceeded 18 inches in length.  Ninety percent of Walleye aged corresponded to stocked year-classes.  The stocking program appears to be providing a quality walleye fishery in Caribou Lake at this time with several different year-classes available to anglers.   <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass were sampled during a spring electrofishing survey at a rate of 11.8 per hour.  Average length was 14.1 inches.  A quality bass fishery exists with 36% of the sample exceeding 16 inches. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike abundance of 8.1 per gillnet lift was down from recent years but still above average compared to other Minnesota Lakes.  Average size was small at 22.1 inches and 2.5 pounds.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie abundance of 3.2 per trapnet lift was average compared to other Minnesota lakes.  Average size was just over seven inches but fish up to 11.5 inches were sampled.  Bluegill abundance was above average at 16.3 per trapnet lift but size was small.  Average length was 5.9 inches and zero Bluegill sampled exceeded 8 inches.  Yellow perch abundance was average but size was small. <br> \n</p>",

All other species' abundances are between first and third quartile ranges.  Growth rates for all species but walleye tends to be slow.  Walleye growth rate reflects the local median rates.  Panfish show a preponderance of age class IV and older while northern pike are well distributed from age class II though V.  Walleye age classes are present only from the years of fingerling stocking.  The historic netting summary shows an increasing trend of pumpkinseed abundance and a decreasing trend of white sucker abundance.  Other species show variation in abundance, however, no trends are evident.</p>",

High numbers of northern pike, bluegill and black crappie were present in 1997.  The average length of northern pike was 17.9 inches and ranged between 10.0 and 27.2 inches.  Black crappie (6.5 inches) and bluegill (5.6 inches) average lengths were small.     Low numbers of walleye were present in the 1997 assessment.  The average length was 22.0 inches and ranged from 16.1 to 28.4 inches.  Most of the aged walleye in the sample corresponded to years of fingerling stocking.     Largemouth bass were present in average numbers.  Sizes ranged from 9.3 to 19.3 inches with an average of 14.4 inches.  Most bass were age VII or older although several age III fish were also sampled.     Rock bass, pumpkinseed, black bullhead and white sucker were also present in the fish community.</p>",
