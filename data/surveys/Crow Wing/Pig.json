There is also a small access on the southwest side with limited parking and no turn around.  Pig has a maximum depth of 56 feet and 39% of the lake is 15 feet deep or less.  Development is heavy on the lake, with 62 homes being counted during the 1995 survey along 2.4 miles of shoreline.Walleyes are not stocked directly into Pig, but fry and fingerlings are stocked into connected Whitefish Lake.  The walleye catch rate was below average in 2005 when compared to similar lakes (1.0/gill net).  Average size was 23.4\" and 4.9 lbs.  All of the fish were over 12\".The northern pike catch rate was above average and the highest to date (14.3/gill net).  Average size was 19.5\" and 2.1 lbs., with 21% of the fish being 24\" or larger.Largemouth bass were caught in average numbers in gill nets (1.5/gill net) and above average numbers in trap nets (4.1/trap net).  Average length was 11.1\" and 8.4\" respectively.The black crappie catch rate was average in gill nets (1.2/gill net), with a average length of 7.2\".  The trap net catch rate of 4.0/trap net was above average.  These fish had an average length of 8.4\".The bluegill catch rate was average (41.9/trap net).  Average length was 5.7\" and only 11% were 7\" or larger.Other fish species captured included bowfin, black bullhead, brown bullhead, common shiner, greater redhorse, hybrid sunfish, lake whitefish, pumpkinseed, rock bass, tullibee (cisco), white sucker, yellow bullhead, and yellow perch.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Pig Lake is 191 acres in size and is part of the Whitefish chain of lakes in northern Crow Wing County.  The lake may be accessed via the channel from Whitefish Lake.  Pig has a maximum depth of 56 feet with 39% of the lake 15 feet or less.  There is heavy development on the lake, which includes 62 homes and 1 resort along 2.2 miles of shoreline.   <br> \n <br> \nWalleyes, although not stocked directly into the lake, are present because of the connection to Whitefish Lake which is stocked with fry and fingerlings.  The walleye catch rate of 3.0/gill net was above average in 2011 when compared to similar lakes.  The catch rate is also the highest observed on Pig Lake compared to previous surveys.  The average size of these fish was large, an impressive 23.1\" and 4.7 lbs.  All of the walleyes sampled were 14\" or larger, including the largest which was 29\". <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass were sampled at a rate of 0.7/gill net which is slightly below average.  The average size of these fish was 10.8\" and 0.7 lbs.  Because standard survey nets don't sample largemouth bass effectively, electrofishing was conducted on Whitefish Lake where the catch rate was 112.5/hr.  The average size was slightly larger than Pig at 12.8\" and 1.3 lbs.  Fish up to 18.7\" were sampled during electrofishing.  Given the connection of the lakes it can be assumed that these fish have the ability to move between them. <br> \n <br> \nThe northern pike catch rate of 11.8/gill net was well above average for similar lakes.  The average size of the northern pike was 19.0\" and 1.6 lbs., with only 7% being 24\" or larger.  Fish up to 32\" were observed in the survey.  The presence of tullibee (cisco), which is an important forage fish, may allow for larger fish to exist.  The catch rate for tullibee (cisco) was 10.3/gill net which is well above average when compared to similar lakes. <br> \n <br> \nPig's bluegill population is near average with 19.1 fish per trap net.  The average length was only 5.9\", and only 9% of the fish were 7\" or larger.  The black crappie numbers were below normal with an average length of 7.4\". <br> \n <br> \nSome other fish species sampled during the survey included black bullhead, bowfin, brown bullhead, greater redhorse, hybrid sunfish, lake whitefish, pumpkinseed, rock bass, silver redhorse, shorthead redhorse, white sucker, yellow bullhead, and yellow perch.   <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of the nearshore fish community in Pig Lake was conducted by Fisheries Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program Staff starting August 8, 2018. Ten sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 15-foot or 50-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at all ten sites with two sites sampled from the boat. Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample eight sites, and soft sediments with abundant vegetation prevented the use of seines at two sampling sites. Nearshore sampling captured 26 native species of fish including ten species that are intolerant of disturbance (Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, Logperch, Mimic Shiner, Northern Sunfish, Pugnose Shiner, Rock Bass, and Smallmouth Bass) and one species that is tolerant of disturbance (Green Sunfish). <br> \n <br> \nData from this targeted nearshore survey is combined with trap net and gill net data from a June 2018 standard survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based Index of Biological Integrity (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment. The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. The FIBI score for Pig Lake from this survey is above an impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes and indicates an exceptional fish community is present in this lake. For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website. <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Pine River Watershed assessment of surface waters process completed in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency. </p>",

Development is heavy on the lake with 65 homes located on the shoreline.  The maximum water depth is 56 feet and 39% of the lake is 15 feet deep or less.  Water clarity is good with a secchi disc reading of 11.5 feet.In 2000 northern pike, largemouth bass and rock bass were found in high numbers compared with similar lake types.  Walleyes, black crappie and tullibee were found in low numbers.  Lake whitefish, white suckers, yellow perch, bluegills, bowfin and brown bullheads were sampled in average numbers.  Growth rates for all fish species were good.</p>",

An old township road access on the south shore is now used by the Ideal Fire Department and is gated off; the gate is opened up for winter access.  The 2018 survey found most species in average numbers, but size was small. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike were caught in the highest number to date (16.3/gill net).  Size was small, with an average length of 19.6\" and 16% measuring 24\" or larger.  Lakes in this part of the state have a new northern pike regulation enacted in 2018: possession limit of 10 with not more than 2 over 26\".  All from 22\"-26\" must be immediately released.  Please refer to the current Minnesota Fishing Regulations for additional information. <br> \n <br> \nIn contrast to northern pike, walleye had lower numbers (1.7/gill net), but nicer size.  Average length was 19.0\" and 80% of the fish were 12\" or larger.  Pig is not stocked directly with walleyes, but connected Whitefish is stocked every year. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie (1.1/trap net) and bluegill (22.2/trap net) numbers were average for this type of lake.  Average length of crappies was 7.6\", with 40% measuring 8\" or larger.  Bluegill were on the small side with an average length of 5.5\" and only 15% measuring 7\" or larger. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass numbers for the Whitefish Chain, which includes Pig, were 68.8/hr run-time during night electrofishing.  Average length was 13.5\".  Five smallmouth bass were also netted while electrofishing the chain.  All but one were over 17\". <br> \n</p>",
