                "narrative": "<p>       Guernsey Lake is a fertile, riverine lake.  As part of the Sauk River, the lake is strongly influenced by the predominantly agricultural land use practices in the watershed.  Severe algae blooms are common in summer, which negatively affects water clarity and vegetation growth.  The secchi disk reading at the time of the summer survey was 2.9 feet.  Cattail was the most common plant species found in the lake and formed a fringe around most of the basin.  Very little in-lake vegetation was found, likely due to the poor water clarity.  Low water levels can, at times, hinder boat accessiblity.   Some shoreline fishing occurs along the mouth of the Sauk River at the boat access.  A spring assessment was also conducted in early June of 2009 to evaluate the bluegill and black crappie populations. <br> \n       There are several fish species in Guernsey Lake that may attract anglers.  While bluegill are probably the most popular species, there is an abundant northern pike population that could provide some excellent fishing.   There was a wide range of sizes observed in the pike catches in both the summer survey and spring assessment.  Average size of the pike in the summer survey at 24 inches or 3.6 pounds was better than most lakes in the area.  Anglers also have a chance to see trophy size fish over 40 inches in length.   The walleye population is sustained through natural reproduction so abundance may vary from year to year and anglers may have to work to find them.  The largemouth bass population appears to be low according to spring electrofishing results, but all the bass caught were over 12 inches.  A smallmouth bass was sampled for the first time by DNR gear in the spring assessment.  Yellow perch numbers appear to be low which may be a result of the high northern pike numbers.  Perch can be a principal prey species for both pike and walleye.  An abundant white sucker population may, however, provide an alternative food source for the gamefish. <br> \n        Bluegill abundance may be down but some quality size fish are still present as most of the bluegill in the spring assessment were over 7 inches in length.  Black crappie is one fish species that has adapted to turbid water.  The species is probably the most abundant fish in Guernsey Lake as they were the most numerous species in both the spring and summer nets.  Crappie reproduction has been excellent in 4 of the last 5 years and small fish as well as eating size are plentiful.  There were, however, some crappie over 10 inches observed in the spring assessment.  \t <br> \n       Carp are another species that has adapted well to turbid water and they appear to be very abundant in Guernsey Lake.    Carp were caught in both the spring and summer nets and were also quite numerous in the electrofishing effort.  Two species of bullhead, brown and yellow, were present in the lake although they are likely not abundant.  Other species in the fish community include bowfin or dogfish, hybrid sunfish, and pumpkinseed.   <br> \n       Anglers and spearers are encouraged to release the larger northern pike and walleye to minimize impacts on the fish community.  Voluntarily limiting harvest of the large panfish will help sustain the quality and balance of the populations.   A study of the water quality issues in Guernsey Lake has been initiated by the Sauk River Watershed District and MPCA.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Guernsey Lake is a fertile, riverine lake.  Being part of the Sauk River, thelake is strongly influenced by the predominantly agricultural land use practicesin the watershed.  Dense algae blooms are common in summer, severely limiting waterclarity and depth of vegetation growth.       Several changes have occurred in the fish community since the last survey. Northern pike abundance has reached an all time high for the lake with an averagesize of less than two pounds.  While some individuals were measured up to twenty-eight inches, most of the pike were from 18 to 21 inches.  Walleye numbers remainedstable, however the population appears to be mostly younger fish.  Naturalreproduction within the lake and from the river maintains the population.  Showinga dramatic decrease in abundance was the yellow perch population.  This may havebeen a result of the high northern pike numbers as perch are a principal preyspecies of both northern pike and walleye.  Guernsey Lake is known for it's summerbluegill fishing.  Numbers remain in the normal range and the size structure of thepopulation looks excellent.  Many of the bluegills sampled during the survey wereover six inches in length and one measured over ten inches.  Another sunfishpresent in the lake is pumpkinseed.  While not as abundant as bluegill, size andtaste are comparable.  Black crappies continue to be abundant.  Though the majorityof the fish were less than eight inches, three over twelve inches long wereobserved.  Being a fertile lake and part of the Sauk River system, Guernseysupports a diverse roughfish community.  White sucker were abundant and thepopulation appears to be dominated by older adult fish.  Also found were bowfin ordogfish, carp, yellow bullheads, and brown bullheads.     Neascus was common on the northern pike.  Neascus is a black trematode orparasite going from snails to fish to a fish-eating bird, such as herons, tomature.  Humans can not be infested.  Skinning the fish removes most of theparasite and cooking will kill the rest.     Selective harvest is encouraged for both angling and spearing to minimizeimpact on the fish community.  Releasing larger northern pike and walleye andvoluntarily limiting harvest of large panfish will help sustain the quality andbalance of the fish community.  Improving water quality in the Sauk River watershedthrough best land use management practices should be high priority for Todd County.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>       A special assessment targeting panfish was conducted on Guernsey Lake in early June to evaluate the black crappie and bluegill populations.  Panfish provide an important fishery in the area and summer trapnets tend to sample few of the larger individuals in a lake.  Six lake survey trapnets were set and lifted twice for a total of 12 net lifts.  Water temperature was around 66 degrees for the spring assessment and the water level was high which made setting the nets in the bays easier.  Some of the trapnets were moved from the previous spring assessment locations due to depth changes. <br> \n        The 2009 spring assessment was very effective at sampling the black crappie population in Guernsey Lake.  A total of 604 crappie were caught for a catch rate of 50.3 per set.  The fish ranged from 5.2 to 11.5 inches in length with a mean length of 8.2 inches.  Modal length for the catch was 8.5 - 9 inches with 23% (n=137) of the fish exceeding 9 inches in length and 4% (n= 26) more than 10 inches.  Ages 2 thru 8 were represented in the 2009 catch with most of the fish (88%) appearing to be from 3 to 5 years of age.  The age 2 fish displayed fast growth while the older fish showed normal growth when compared to an area back-calculated length table. <br> \n       A similar spring assessment was conducted in 2003 which caught 152 black crappie, for a catch rate of 12.7 per lift.  The size structure of the sample was more desirable than that from the 2009 assessment.  Although the length range was similar, 4.4 - 11.3 inches, the mean length and modal length were better, 8.7 inches and 9 - 9.5 inches, respectively.    Also a higher proportion of the  sample was comprised of larger fish with 49% (n=73) exceeding 9 inches and 15% (n= 23) more than 10 inches in length.   More crappie over 9 and 10 inches were actually sampled in 2009, but the proportion was lower due to the sample size.  Trapnets were also part of the 1997 summer population assessment.  Those nets caught 109 black crappie for a catch rate of 18.2 per lift which was almost three times the 75% quartile of 6.5/trapnet for lake class 39.  Although there were fish up to 12.5 inches caught, mean length was 7.8 inches and modal length 7 - 7.5 inches.  Less than a quarter (21%; n= 25) of the measured crappie were over 9 inches in length and only 5% (n=4) of the fish were more than 10 inches in length.   <br> \n       The 2009 summer lake survey gillnets (n=2) in late August sampled 106 black crappie between 4 and 9.8 inches in length.   The catch rate was 53 per gillnet which was more than 7 times the 75% quartile of 7.3/gillnet for lake class 39.  The size structure of the catch was not as good as that found in the 2009 spring assessment due to the strong presence of the 2008 year class in the gillnets and the failure to sample crappie over 10 inches.  Mean length for the sample was 6.6 inches and modal length was 4.5 - 5 inches.  Only 5% (n=5) of the fish were over 9 inches in length.  The 2003 gillnet catch was 20 crappie or five per gillnet which was within the normal range for the lake class.  The fish measured from 4.9 to 9.3 inches in length with a mean length of 7.4 inches.  While the modal length of 7 - 7.5 inches was better than that from 2009, only 1% (n=2) of the crappie exceeded 9 inches in length. <br> \n       The bluegill catch in the 2009 panfish assessment was lower than expected with 68 fish  caught or 5.7/trapnet.   The sample size structure was impressive with fish ranging from 4.9 to 9.1 inches and a mean length of 7.5 inches and modal length of 7.5 - 8 inches.   Bluegill exceeding 7 inches in length accounted for 85% (n=58) of the catch, while 16% (n=11) were over 8 inches and 1% (n=1) was more than 9 inches in length.  Ages 2 thru 7 were represented in the 2009 assessment.  Older fish appear to dominate the population as 93% of the bluegill were over 5 years of age.  All of the age groups exhibited fast growth when compared to an area back-calculated length table. <br> \n       The 2003 panfish assessment sampled 108 bluegill or 9/trapnet.  The fish measured from 3.1 to 9.3 inches with a mean length of 6.8 inches and modal length of 7 - 7.5 inches.  Like in 2009, most of the bluegill were more than 7 inches in length, 61% (n=66).  Only 6% (n=6) were over 8 inches and 0.9% (n-1) was more than 9 inches in length.   A total of 134 bluegill were caught in the 1997 summer survey or 22/trapnet.   The catch rate was within the normal range for the lake class.  The fish ranged from 3.2 to 10.1 inches in length with a mean length of 6 inches and modal length of 6 - 6.5 inches.   A typical summer trapnet catch is usually dominated by smaller bluegills.  Only 15% (n=14) of the measured fish in the 1997 summer survey were over 7 inches in length with 2% (n=2) more than 8 inches and 1% (n=1) exceeding 9 inches in length. <br> \n       The 2009 panfish assessment also captured some impressive northern pike with two of the fish over 33 inches in length, the longest being 39.5 inches.  A total of 13 pike were caught with four between 10 and 14 inches, three around 19 inches in length, and 4 between 23 and 25 inches.   There was also a 7-inch walleye and 10-inch smallmouth bass caught.  Common carp provided most of the biomass in the trapnets with 14 netted.  No carp were caught in the 2003 panfish assessment and a total of 5 carp were netted in the 1997 summer survey gillnets and trapnets.  The 1997 survey catch of 0.7/trapnet was within the normal range for lake class 39 (interquartile range = 0.3 - 1.4).  Other species sampled in spring assessment included bowfin, brown bullhead, golden shiner, hybrid sunfish, pumpkinseed, white sucker, yellow bullhead, and yellow perch.   <br> \n       Spring trapnets appear to provide a slightly better picture of the panfish populations in Guernsey Lake than the summer surveys.  This method will be used again for further comparisons and developing management goals.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A standard lake survey was completed in May 2018 to obtain current information regarding the fishery. Trap nets were used in the shallows to assess panfish populations and gill nets were used in deeper, open water to assess Northern Pike, Walleye and Yellow Perch populations. Guernsey Lake is a small, quiet 125-acre lake located on the Sauk River about 7 miles southeast of Osakis. As a riverine lake, nutrient levels are high and water clarity is poor. Cattail is the dominant species of vegetation and essentially rings the entire basin. There is little to no residential shoreline development. A concrete public boat ramp is located on the southwest end of the lake near the inlet of the Sauk River. Species supported in the Sauk River can freely move in and out of Guernsey Lake. Black Crappie and Bluegill are the primary species of management, but there are Walleyes (natural not stocked) in the lake and Northern Pike approaching trophy size have historically been captured in survey nets. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappies are abundant. Spring Trap netting regularly samples crappies over 10 inches in length.  Since 2009, crappies have been getting bigger to the point where the 2010 year class is dominating the population. These fish measured 10-11 inches in 2018. Bluegills do not appear to be doing as well as crappies, however, the lake supports fish over nine inches, as evidenced in trap net sampling during the past decade.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike appear to be increasing in abundance. Past surveys found occasional pike in the upper 30 to low 40-inch range however, the 2018 survey did not find many large fish. A total of 33 Walleyes were sampled in gill nets, the largest was 25 inches. Because of Guernsey's riverine nature, large predators can move in and out with ease making their presence highly variable. The good news is that adequate prey-fish including Yellow Perch and White Sucker are common and appear to provide a sustainable forage base for large pike and Walleye.  <br> \n <br> \nAnglers and dark house spearers are encouraged to practice selective harvest with Northern Pike and Bluegill. The sustained presence of large individuals of either of these species seems to be of particular importance in maintaining a quality, healthy fishery.  <br> \n</p>",
