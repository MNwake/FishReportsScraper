Since then, 912 northern pike were stocked in 1952 and 4,800 largemouth bass were stocked in 1955.Special Regulations:Spawning beds were posted in 1953 and 1954.Discussion and Summary:Chemical, physical, and fish population characteristics indicate Kego Lake can best be managed as a largemouth bass/panfish lake.Testnet catches indicate substantial northern pike and crappie populations and large bluegill and pumpkinseed populations.  Natural reproduction of northern pike and crappie is good.  Northern pike and crappie growth is satisfactory, bluegill and pumpkinseed growth is slow and their average size is small.  Bluegill in the catch were mostly four year old fish and pumpkinseed mostly three and four year old fish indicating sporadic reproductive success for these species.  However, population levels are more than adequate to maintain the population and as these strong year classes grow older, the average size of sunfish should improve.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>The northern pike, black crappie, brown bullhead, pumpkinseed, and bluegill populations are over the state and local medians for number/set and pounds/set. The yellow perch population is way below the state and local medians.  The black crappies have increased in size the past three years and are running from 1/2 to 1.5 pounds.  Walleyes were reported being caught in the spring of the year but none were caught in experimental nets.  Also largemouth bass running up to five pounds were reported being caught on Kego Lake.Algae growth has remained constant over the past five years with a large population of panfish predation on walleye and northern pike young-of-the-year is quite extensive.One pair of loons with one yearling was observed. Only one ice fishing house on the lake last year with results being fair.  Was stated by local resident that many large walleyes and northerns (over four pounds) were seen through the ice while winter fishing.  Only one boat was on the lake fishing with any regularity, success fair.  Very little duck hunting on the lake.  Very few (less than five) large boats were observed (one incident of water skiing was observed).  The lake is landlocked with no inlets or outlets.  Referring to the map, area marked I - land between the two protions of water is non-existant. At the time of the survey, one could travel from the northern tip of lake to the south most portions.  Grouse hunting has been good in the area surrounding the lake for the past three years.</p>",
