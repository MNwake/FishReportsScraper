                "narrative": "<p>Fish Lake covers a total area of 332 acres and has a maximum depth of 10 feet, but only 2% of the lake is deeper than 5 feet.  Ther is no distinct inlet or outlet streams present, but during periods of high lake levels there is an overflow from the lake into the swamp adjacent to the west shoreline.  Local residents reported that there is a drainage ditch between this swamp and Cedar Creek.  The shoreline soils are composed of about 60% sand and 40% muck bordered by swamp.  There were no resorts, 1 cottage, 3 farms, and no boats present at the time of the survey.  The greenish water color and the Seechi disk reading of 1.5 feet were caused primarily by mixed plankton and an algal bloom.  Chemical analysis of the water indicated that the lake is a moderately hard-water lake.Submerged and floating-leaved aquatic plants were abundant throughout 95% of the lake, and cattails were abundant along the swampy west and northwest shoreline at the time of the survey.  About 97% of the total trapnet catch was made up of bullheads, green sunfish, and bluegills, with bluegills alone constituting 46% of the total catch.  The growth rates of the green sunfish and bluegills alone were about average when compared with the statewide average growth rate figures.  The shoreline seining showed good natural reproduction of sunfish this year.  Local residents reported that the lake has winterkilled at various times in past years, and that the lake receives very little fishing pressure.</p>",
