The assessment consisted of 67 survey sites evenly spaced 200 meters around the lake. Assessments were made in three habitat zones: Shoreline Zone (the shore-water interface to the top of the natural bank), Shoreland Zone (land-ward from shoreline to development structure or 100 feet), and Aquatic Zone (lake-ward 50 feet of shoreline). The average lakewide habitat score was 84.1 (+/- 2.7) out of 100 possible. Approximately 23 percent of the sites were developed with a mean score of 51.9 (+/- 5.5), while undeveloped sites had a mean score of 94.2 (+/- 0.9).</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Big Sand Lake (DOW# 11-0077; Lake Class 35) is a 730-acre lake with 635 littoral acres located north of Remer, MN. There is a township-owned public access on the east shore. Big Sand Lake has 8.42 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 23 feet.  The DNR has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different classes based on physical, chemical and other characteristics. Big Sand Lake is in Lake Class 35; lakes in this class typically have a very high percentage of their surface area less than 15 feet deep and a very irregular shoreline.  Other area lakes in Lake Class 35 include, Big Bass, Hovde and McKeown. The lake is primarily managed for Bluegill and Walleye and secondarily for Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, Black Crappie, and Yellow Perch. The lake was initially surveyed in 1973 and 14 resurveys, population assessments or natural reproduction checks have occurred since then.  <br> \n <br> \nBluegill abundance was moderate but lower than recent surveys in the lake with 12 fish per gill net sampled. Bluegill had an average length of six inches and fish up to eight inches were sampled. Management goals are based on trap nets, which were not used. Walleye were caught at nearly five fish per net, the second highest catch in this lake and exceeded the management goal of four fish per net. Walleye lengths ranged from 16 to 26 inches with an average of 20 inches. Northern Pike numbers were the highest observed with 18 fish per gill net and were well above the management goal of 7 to 10 fish per net. Northern Pike had an average length of 19 inches and a weight of almost two pounds. Anglers are encouraged to harvest the abundant Northern Pike under 22 inches in this lake. Largemouth Bass catch rates were at an all-time high with approximately four fish per gill net sampled. Electrofishing targeting Largemouth Bass to set and measure management goals was not conducted in Big Sand Lake. Largemouth Bass ranged in length from 8 to 19 inches sampled with an average length of 14 inches.  Black Crappie were caught at over 12 fish per gill net, a record high using gill nets, and averaged 7 inches long; crappie ranged in length from 4 to 10 inches. Spring trap netting is needed to set management goals for Black Crappie. Yellow Perch numbers were high but similar to past surveys with 24 fish per net. The Yellow Perch catch exceeded the management goal of 10 to fish per gill net.  Yellow Perch averaged six inches in length with fish from five to eight inches sampled.  <br> \nOther fish species that anglers can expect to encounter include, Brown Bullhead, Yellow Bullhead, Hybrid Sunfish and Pumpkinseed. <br> \n <br> \nPeople can have significant impacts on lakes and the fish populations they support. Harvest, lakeshore development, removal of shoreline vegetation, and introductions of invasive species can all adversely affect fish populations. Currently, no aquatic invasive species (AIS) have been identified in Big Sand Lake. AIS are moved from infested to non-infested waters by anglers, boaters, and lake shore owners and can adversely impact lakes and fish populations. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access. If you suspect an infestation of an invasive species in this lake, save a specimen and report it to a local natural resource office. Additional information on all of these topics can be found on the DNR website (www.dnr.state.mn.us) or by contacting the Walker Area Fisheries office. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Big Sand Lake (DOW# 11-0077; Lake Class 35) is a 730-acre lake located north of Remer, MN. There is a township-owned public access on the east shore. Big Sand Lake has 8.42 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 23 feet. The DNR has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different classes based on physical, chemical and other characteristics. Big Sand Lake is in Lake Class 35; lakes in this class typically have a very high percentage of their surface area less than 15 feet deep and a very irregular shoreline. <br> \n <br> \nIn Big Sand Lake, Bluegill, Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass and Yellow Perch are all good species to target. Bluegill are abundant with large numbers of 6-7 inch fish which are excellent for young anglers. Northern Pike numbers have stabilized in the past few years, but the size of fish has increased. Pike of all sizes were sampled up to 32 inches. Similar to Bluegill, Yellow Perch are abundant in Big Sand Lake with most fish between 6-8 inches but as long as 10 inches. Largemouth Bass numbers have increased in the past few years, with fish up to 19 inches sampled. Walleye numbers in Big Sand Lake remain low, but the size structure of Walleye is still good. Walleyes up to 26 inches were sampled with the average size being 20 inches. Other fish species that anglers can expect to encounter include, Brown Bullhead, Bowfin (Dogfish), Hybrid Sunfish, Pumpkinseed Sunfish, and Yellow Bullhead. <br> \n <br> \nPeople can have significant impacts on lakes and the fish populations they support. Harvest, lakeshore development, removal of shoreline vegetation, and introductions of invasive species can all adversely affect fish populations. Currently no aquatic invasive species (AIS) have been identified in Big Sand Lake. AIS are moved from infested to non-infested waters by anglers, boaters, and lake shore owners and can adversely impact lakes and fish populations. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access. If you suspect an infestation of an invasive species in this lake, save a specimen and report it to a local natural resource office. Additional information on all of these topics can be found on the DNR website (www.dnr.state.mn.us) or by contacting the Walker Area Fisheries office. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Big Sand Lake, located two miles west of Remer, MN, has a surface area of 736 acres and maximum depth of 23 feet.  A narrow, township-owned, earthen access is located on the east side of the lake off of Cass County Road #130.  The DNR has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different classes based on physical, chemical and other characteristics.  Big Sand Lake is in Lake Class 35; lakes in this class typically have a very high percentage of their surface area less than 15 feet deep and have a very irregular shoreline.   The 2005 survey of Big Sand Lake found a good self-sustaining population of walleye, with fish from 14 to 25 inches being sampled. Fisheries personnel will use fall electrofishing in 2006 to check on the abundance young walleye. If this sampling fails to detect a moderate number of age 0 or age 1 walleye, Big Sand will be scheduled for fry stocking in spring 2007.  Electrofishing in fall 2007 will be used to determine if contingency stocking of fingerlings is needed.   Northern pike were abundant; though many of the northern pike in DNR test nets were 19 inches or less, there was a good number of fish 22 inches and greater available for anglers.  Abundant populations of black crappie, bluegill and pumpkinseed sunfish can provide panfish action for anglers.  Largemouth bass are present as well.  Other species available to anglers include bowfin (dogfish), brown bullhead, rock bass, white sucker, yellow bullhead, and yellow perch. Anglers can help maintain or improve the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for table fare, but encourages release of medium- to large-sized fish.  Releasing these fish can help maintain balance in the fish community in Little Sand Lake and provide anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future.  Shoreline areas on the land and into the shallow water provide essential habitat for fish and wildlife that live in or near Minnesota's lakes.  Overdeveloped shorelines can't support the fish, wildlife, and clean water that are associated with natural undeveloped lakes. The combined effects of all lakeshore owners \"fixing up\" their property can destroy a lake's valuable natural shorelines.Shoreline habitat consists of aquatic plants, woody plants and natural lake bottom soils.Plants in the water and at the water's edge provide habitat, prevent erosion and absorb excess nutrients. Shrubs, trees, and woody debris such as fallen trees or limbs provide good habitat both above and below the water and should be left in place.  Natural lake bottom materials like silt or gravel are more ecologically productive than pure sand trucked in for a swimming beach.  A tidy lawn and a sandy beach make great spots for sunbathing and swimming but do little to provide habitat for fish and wildlife. By leaving a buffer strip of natural vegetation along the shoreline, property owners can reduce erosion, help maintain water quality, and provide habitat and travel corridors for wildlife.Only if more lakeshore owners manage their shoreline in a natural condition can fish and wildlife populations on Minnesota lakes remain healthy and abundant.  More specific information on protecting or restoring shorelines and watersheds is available through the local DNR Fisheries office.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Big Sand Lake is managed primarily for walleyes.  The lake has been stocked with walleyes, most recently in 1993.  Populations of panfish and northern pike are also present in the lake.     Walleye sampled with gill nets had a catch rate (3.3/set) that exceeded the expected range for this type of lake.  The mean length for gill-net sampled walleye was 17.8 inches, and ranged in length from 7.2 to 25.6 inches.  The mean weight (2.2 pounds) also exceeded the expected range.  The growth rate for sampled walleye was near the state mean.  Most of the walleye sampled were from non-stocked year classes indicating that natural reproduction, not stocking, accounts for most of the walleye.     The catch rate for black crappies sampled in trap nets (2.5/set) was within the expected range.  The mean length was 8.7 inches, and ranged from 6.9 to 11.7 inches.  Black crappies were also sampled in gill nets.  This catch rate (0.6/set) was less than the expected range.  The length of gill net sampled black crappie ranged from 8.9 to 11.1 inches.     The bluegill trap net catch rate (32.3/set) exceeded the expected rate, as well as the trap net catch rate from the past two surveys on Big Sand Lake (1983 and 1990).  Length of these fish ranged from 4.5 to 10.7 inches, with a mean length of 7.5 inches.  Bluegill growth rates were near the expected growth rate for this type of lake for ages 1-4, and greater than expected for ages 5-8.     The gill net catch rate for northern pike (9.7/set) was within the expected range.  The mean length of pike sampled was 20.3 inches with a range from 12.8 to 35.4 inches.  The average weight was 2.0 pounds.     Yellow perch were sampled in gill nets at a rate (35.8/set) that exceeded the expected range.  The mean length of sampled yellow perch was 6.7 inches, with a range from 4.8 to 9.8 inches.  The high abundance of yellow perch may account for the high catch rate and size of walleye, as yellow  perch are an important component in the walleye diet.     Other species sampled in test nets include: bowfin, brown and yellow bullhead, largemouth bass, pumpkinseed, rock bass, and white sucker.     Big Sand Lake is a shallow lake with most of its surface acres available to aquatic plant growth.  Lakeshore owners can do their part to decrease overabundant plant growth by minimizing fertilizer use and  maintaining shoreline vegetation (both terrestrial and aquatic).</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Big Sand Lake, located two miles west of Remer, MN, has a surface area of 736 acres and maximum depth of 23 feet.  A narrow, township-owned, earthen access is located on the east side of the lake off of Cass County Road #130.  The DNR has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different classes based on physical, chemical and other characteristics.  Big Sand Lake is in Lake Class 35.  Lakes in this class typically have a very high percentage of their surface area less than 15 feet deep and a very irregular shoreline.    <br> \n <br> \nThe 2010 survey of Big Sand Lake found average walleye numbers for Lake Class 35, with sampled fish ranging in size from 8 to 27 inches long.  Northern pike were abundant with good numbers of larger fish.  Northern pike averaged 22.5 inches and ranged from 12 to 35 inches long in DNR survey nets.  Abundant populations of black crappie, bluegill and pumpkinseed sunfish can provide panfish action for anglers.  Other species available to anglers include largemouth bass, bowfin (dogfish), brown bullhead, rock bass, white sucker, yellow bullhead, and yellow perch. <br> \n  <br> \nAnglers can help maintain or improve the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for table fare, but encourages release of medium- to large-sized fish.  Releasing these fish can help maintain balance in the fish community in Big Sand Lake and provide anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future.  <br> \n <br> \nBig Sand Lake is not currently known to be infested with any aquatic invasive species (AIS).  To avoid spreading AIS, lake users should inspect and remove any aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat away from the landing prior to launching and again before leaving the access.  If you suspect you may have discovered a new infestation of an invasive species, save a specimen and report it to a local natural resource office.  Additional information on AIS prevention and awareness, including the problems they cause, can be found on the DNR website (www.dnr.state.mn.us). <br> \n <br> \nShoreline habitat consists of aquatic plants, woody plants and natural lake bottom soils.  Plants in the water and at the water's edge provide habitat, prevent erosion and absorb excess nutrients. Shrubs, trees, and woody debris such as fallen trees or limbs provide good habitat both above and below the water and should be left in place.  By leaving a buffer strip of natural vegetation along the shoreline, property owners can reduce erosion, help maintain water quality, and provide habitat and travel corridors for wildlife. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Big Sand Lake (DOW# 11-0077) is a 730-acre lake with 635 littoral acres, 8.42 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 23 feet located West of Remer, MN. There is a Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MNDNR) owned public access on the East shore. The DNR has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different classes based on physical, chemical and other characteristics. Big Sand Lake is in lake class 35; lakes in this class typically have a high percentage of littoral area (water depths less than 15 feet deep), and an irregular shoreline. Other area lakes in lake class 35 include Big Bass, Hovde, and McKeown. The lake is primarily managed for Bluegill and Walleye. Black Crappie, Largemouth Bass, Northern Pike and Yellow Perch are a secondary management species. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie are present although targeted sampling is required to establish long-range management goals. Black Crappie ranged in length from 4 to 9 inches. Bluegill catch rates exceeded abundance and size structure management goals and ranged in length from 3 to 9 inches. Other fish species sampled include Bowfin, Brown Bullhead, Hybrid Sunfish, Largemouth Bass, Northern Pike, Pumpkinseed, Rock Bass, Yellow Bullhead, and Yellow Perch. <br> \n <br> \nPeople can have significant impacts on lakes and the fish populations they support. Harvest, lakeshore development, removal of shoreline vegetation, and introductions of invasive species can all adversely affect fish populations. Currently, no aquatic invasive species (AIS) have been identified in Big Sand Lake. AIS are moved from infested to non-infested waters by anglers, boaters, and lake shore owners and can adversely impact lakes and fish populations. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access. If you suspect an infestation of an invasive species in this lake, save a specimen and report it to a local natural resource office. Additional information on all of these topics can be found on the DNR website (www.dnr.state.mn.us) or by contacting the Walker Area Fisheries office.</p>",
