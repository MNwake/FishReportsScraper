ONLY THREE WALLEYE YEAR CLASSES WERE PRESENT, WITH THE 1988 YEAR CLASS THE STRONGEST. QUARTER-INCH TRAP NETTING INDICATES THAT THERE WAS  LITTLE OR NO NATURAL REPRODUCTION IN 1989, BUT AGING INDI- CATES THAT THERE WAS LITTLE OR NO NATURAL REPRO- DUCTION IN 1989, BUT AGING INDICATES THAT NATURAL REPRODUCTION DID OCCUR IN 1987. WALLEYE GROWTH WAS ABOUT AVERAGE BY COOK COUNTY STANDARDS. THE WALLEYE TAKEN IN ASSESSMENTS IN THE 1970'S WERE ATTRIBUTED TO THE 1968, 1971, AND 1973 FRY STOCKINGS, ON THE BASIS OF LENGTH FREQUENCY. NEITHER NATURAL REPRODUCTION OR FRY STOCKING HAVE BEEN ABLE TO CONSISTENTLY PRODUCE STRONG YEAR CLASSES IN BINAGAMI LAKE IN THE 1980'S. AFTER THE 1986 ASSESSMENT, MANAGEMENT PLANS WERE CHANGED TO CALL FOR STOCKING WALLEYE FINGERLINGS IN EVEN YEARS, STARTING IN 1988. IT IS TOO EARLY TO EVALUATE THE SUCCESS OF THIS STRATEGY, BUT THE STRENGTH OF THE 1988 YEAR CLASS IS ENCOURAGING. LARGEMOUTH BASS WERE PRESENT, BUT NOT IN SUFFI- CIENT NUMBERS TO PROVIDE A FISHERY. ROCK BASS WERE ABUNDANT, BUT SMALL. NO YELLOW PERCH WERE PRESENT; THEY HAVE NEVER BEEN SAMPLED IN THIS LAKE.</p>",

About 70% of the catch came from strong natural year classes produced in 1998 and 1997.  Walleye stocking was discontinued in this lake after 1994 (in favor of bluegill management), but it appears that natural reproduction will provide a walleye population at least as good as the population present when the lake was stocked.  Walleye growth rates had been about average for the area, despite the lack of yellow perch, and the presence of a competing white sucker population.Two years of stocking adult bluegill have succeeded in establishing a good bluegill population with a high number of fish, although most are small.  Bluegill also appear to be reproducing in the lake, and may be able to sustain themselves eventually, without the need for continued stocking.</p>",

All of the walleye caught had been naturally produced.  Walleye stocking was discontinued in this lake after 1994 (in favor of bluegill management).  A high catch of young-of-the-year walleye in 1/4-inch trap nets in this assessment indicated good reproduction in 2004.  Walleye growth rates had been about average for the area.Bluegill were last stocked in 1999, so all bluegill captured in 2004 had been naturally produced.  The catch of bluegill was near average for lakes of this class, but the fish were young and small.  Management goals for the bluegill population were not met in 2004.</p>",

The 2023 standard survey was conducted to evaluate the walleye and bluegill populations in the lake and determine whether additional stocking is necessary to meet the current management goals. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill were not captured in the trap nets or gill nets in the 2023 standard lake survey and may indicate that the population has collapsed. Initial survey results suggest that continued supplemental stocking may be needed to support the bluegill population. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance in 2023 was very high in Binagami Lake for both the gill net and trap net sets. Walleye captured ranged from 6.1 to 18.9 inches with a mean length of 14.7 inches. Aging results indicated a total of 8 naturally reproduced year classes present with individuals as old as 9 present in the population. Back calculated growth rates suggest relatively steady growth until about 15 inches and then slow growth from there on. High competition with other fish and lack of forage for walleye may be limiting growth. Despite slow growth and lack of large fish the walleye fishery provides excellent angling opportunities.  <br> \n <br> \nRock bass continued to be present in Binagami Lake but at low levels in both the gill nets and trap nets. No rock bass greater than 7.0 inches were found. White sucker abundance was similar to previous years and were relatively large ranging from 16.3 to 19.3 inches. White suckers may compete with walleye for available forage. To date no northern pike, yellow perch, or smallmouth bass have been found in this lake. This is unusual given how prevalent those species are in other local lakes.   <br> \n <br> \nCook County, Minnesota lakes continue to be susceptible to aquatic invasive species introductions. Invasive species have the potential to significantly alter fish communities and overall lake health. Anglers should clean watercraft and fishing gear, drain all water, and dispose of unused bait in the trash to prevent accidental introductions.  <br> \n</p>",

This was the first of two assessments scheduled in the 2012 lake management plan to monitor fish populations in this lake, and to determine whether additional bluegill stocking would be needed to meet the goal for that species. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill were present in Binagami Lake in 2014; however, their numbers were probably low and most were very small.  None were taken in standard trap nets, so the catch goal for the species was not met.  Since the catch was low, another stocking of adult bluegill has been proposed for the spring of 2015.  Bluegill were collected in 0.25-in-mesh trap nets used in this assessment.  The catch in those nets included one seven-inch fish, and several in the 1.5-2.5-inch range.  The smaller fish probably came from a single, moderately strong year class produced naturally in 2013 or 2012. Bluegill were last stocked in this lake in 1999. <br> \n <br> \nThe 2014 walleye catch was typical of catches seen in this lake since 1986.  The gill net catch fell a little short of the goal for the species in this lake, and was low for a lake of this type; however, the catch was similar to most seen in this lake recently.  The walleye size goal was met by the capture of fish over 20 inches in length in gill nets and trap nets.  Although the 2014 catch did not meet the current goal, the general trend in this lake has been towards increasing walleye numbers since stocking was discontinued in 1994.  All walleye taken in 2014 had been produced naturally, and it appeared that a moderately strong year class had been produced in 2012.  Growth of young walleye had been good; fish reached an average length of 9.0 inches by the end of their second year, compared to an area mean of 8.6 inches.  Too few older fish were taken to allow growth of older walleye to be described. <br> \n <br> \nBinagami Lake is one of a small number of Cook County lakes supporting rock bass, and they've usually been abundant.  The 2014 rock bass catch in standard trap nets was low for this lake historically.  Since rock bass have not provided much (if any) angling opportunity, probably compete with bluegill (and young walleye) for forage, and may prey directly on young bluegill, a drop in rock bass abundance may be a positive sign for this lake. <br> \n <br> \nNo northern pike or yellow perch have ever been collected in Binagami Lake.  The absence of those species is unusual in a lake of this type, in this area.  Largemouth bass have not been collected in this lake since 1983, and no smallmouth bass have ever been found <br> \n <br> \nThe white sucker gill net catch was within the normal range for a lake of this type, and for this lake historically.  White sucker can compete with walleye for invertebrate forage.  Although their numbers did not appear to have been excessive in 2014, the lack of yellow perch in this lake increases the reliance of walleye on invertebrates, and increases the chances that competition from white sucker could be (or become) a limiting factor for the walleye population. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

It appeared that both stocking and natural reproduction were contributing to the walleye population; however, several years of walleye stocking failed to increase walleye abundance.  Large numbers of small rock bass were also present, but no other panfish or gamefish were collected.</p>",

Growth rates for those small fish had been fast.  If they continue to grow at that rate it is likely that by the end of the summer of 2008, many will be large enough to be of interest to anglers.  Rock bass were also abundant in 2007; however, very few were large enough to be taken by anglers. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye were fairly abundant in 2007, but the catch was dominated by small, young fish.  Most of the walleye collected were under 12 inches in length.  All had been produced naturally.  Walleye growth rates had been about average, with considerable variation from year class to year class.  The lack of a yellow perch forage base was probably a limiting factor for the walleye population in this lake. <br> \n <br> \nNo other gamefish were taken in this assessment.  Northern pike and smallmouth bass have never been found in this lake, and largemouth bass have not been seen here since 1982. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",
