The 1994 population assessment recorded one of the highest walleye population in the Duluth area.  While most of these fish are small (9 to 11 inches), there are many fish over 15 inches and a few fish over 26 inches.     Nothern pike numbers are quite low, but tend to be large.  Knowledgeable anglers can also catch largemouth bass although limited emergent cover restricts fishing to just a few areas.     Yellow perch are numerous with an average length of 7.6 inches and fish to 9.8 inches.  Low numbers of average size bluegill, black crappie and pumpkinseed are present to round out the angler's catch.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Pike is a 494 acre lake with 135 (27%) acres of littoral area and a maximum depth of 62 feet.  The lake is located just north of Hermantown, MN and has a township administered, concrete, back-in access located off County Road #13.  Walleye fry have been stocked in even years from 1982 through 2018. Pike Lake was last assessed in 2014.  Pike Lake was surveyed during the summer of 2019 to update information about fish populations.   <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance of 15.3 per gillnet lift was nearly unchanged from 2014 (15.8) and was above average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Historically, Walleye abundance has ranged from 4.7 to 22.7 per gillnet lift.  Walleye average length was 16.5 inches.  Natural reproduction of Walleye in Pike Lake is limited as 97% of the Walleye captured were aged to stocked year-classes.  Several good year-classes of Walleye will provide quality angling opportunities in Pike Lake in 2020 and beyond. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike abundance of 1.7 per gillnet lift was up from 2014 (0.6) and below average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Historically, the Northern Pike abundance has been relatively low in Pike Lake and has ranged from 0.2 to 7.0.  Average length was impressive at 30.1 inches.  Although the abundance of Northern Pike is low, the size structure of the population is among the best in the Duluth Area. <br> \n <br> \nA total of 35 Largemouth Bass were sampled with electrofishing equipment.  The catch rate of Largemouth Bass was 32.0 fish per hour of electrofishing on-time.  Largemouth Bass average length was 12.9 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie were scarce but large.  Average length was 12.7 inches, but only three specimens were captured.  Bluegill abundance of 5.2 per trapnet lift was average compared to other Minnesota Lakes but size was small.  Average length was 4.6 inches.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Northern pike (1.8/set) and white sucker (10.2/set) area at or above their respective medians.  These species have not exhibited any detectable trends since 1950.  Yellow perch exploded with a catch rate of 127.3 per gill net set in 1989, up from 25.0 per lift in 1958.  Prior to this, perch had been stable outside of a spike of 43.8 per lift in 1958.  Walleye exhibited a historic high catch rate of 22.6 per gill net lift, excluding the previous high of 18.3 in 1972.  Examination of past stocking and netting records and 1989 age analysis strongly suggest that while some natural reproduction is occurring, fry stocking is having a significant impact.     Trap net catches show few black crappie in Pike Lake and declines in pumpkinseed and bluegill sunfish since 1958.  No black crappie were taken in 1989.  Catch rates for pumpkinseed and bluegill sunfish were 1.8 and 1.5 fish per trap net lift respectively.  These low numbers should enhance walleye fry stocking efforts.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Pike is a 494 acre lake with 135 (27%) acres of littoral area and a maximum depth of 62 feet.  The lake is located just north of Hermantown, MN and has a Township administered, concrete, back-in access located off County Road #13.  Walleye fry have been stocked in even years from 1982 through 2004.  The lake is managed for walleye and largemouth bass.     Walleye abudance of 6.4 per gillnet lift was average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Walleye abundance, which had increased slightly from 1999 (4.7), has declined from the 1989 and 1994 catch rates of 22.7 and 20.5 per gillnet lift.  Mean length of 14.5 inches was small, and growth was slow.  Of the walleye aged from the 2004 investigation, 80% were born in years that walleye fry were stocked.  Similarly, 95% of the walleye aged in 1999 and 87% of the walleye aged in 1994 were born in years that walleye fry were stocked.     Largemouth bass were sampled by electrofishing in the spring of 2004.  Largemouth bass abundance was 17.5 per hour of electrofishing.  Mean length of 9.7 inches was small, with average growth.  Ten of 14 aged bass were born in 2002.     Northern pike abundance of 1.7 per gillnet lift was below average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Mean length of 32.2 inches was large, and growth was fast.  Age analysis revealed low but steady recruitment from 1996 through 2001.     Yellow perch abundance of 51.0 per gillnet lift was well above average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Mean length of 7.7 inches was average, and growth was also average. Age analysis revealed strong recruitment from 1999 through 2001 and no fish older than age six.     Bluegill abundance of 3.0 per trapnet lift was below average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Mean length of 5.5 inches was average, and growth was also average.  Age analysis revealed strong 2002 and 1998 year-classes and all but one year-class represented from 1996 through 2002.     Other fish species sampled include black crappie, pumpkinseed sunfish, rock bass and white sucker.     Although walleye catch rates have declined since prior to 1994, data indicate that the walleye fry stocking program continues to provide an average abundance of walleye in the lake.  Yellow perch provide an excellent forage for walleye and potential for another target species for anglers.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Pike is a 494 acre lake with 135 (27%) acres of littoral area and a maximum depth of 62 feet.  The lake is located just north of Hermantown, MN and has a township administered, concrete, back-in access located off County Road #13.  Walleye fry have been stocked in even years from 1982 through 2014. Pike Lake was last assessed in 2009.  Pike Lake was surveyed during the summer of 2014 to update information about fish populations.   <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance of 15.8 per gillnet lift was up from 2009 (13.0) and was above average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Historically, Walleye abundance has ranged from 4.7 to 22.7 per gillnet lift.  Walleye average length was 12.7 inches and growth was below average when compared to other Duluth Area lakes.  Natural reproduction appears limited as 99% of the Walleye captured were aged to stocked year-classes.  A very strong 2010 year-class is evident, as 85% of the Walleye sampled were age-4.   <br> \n <br> \nA total of 34 Largemouth Bass were sampled with electrofishing equipment.  The catch rate of Largemouth Bass was 35.2 fish per hour of electrofishing on-time and was down from 2009 (67.7 per hour).  Largemouth Bass average length was 11.3 inches and growth was average compared to other Duluth Area lakes.  Recruitment was consistent with all year-classes from 2005 through 2011 represented. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike abundance of 0.6 per gillnet lift was up from 2009 (0.2) and below average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Historically, the Northern Pike CPUE has been relatively low in Pike Lake and has ranged from 0.2 to 7.0.  Average length was 28.7 inches but too few individuals were sampled to evaluate stock density or growth.  All year-classes from 1999 to 2003 were represented.  Recruitment was sporadic with only one year-class present (2010). <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie abundance of 0.0 per trapnet lift was down from 2009 (0.6) and was below average when compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Historically, Black Crappie trapnet CPUE has been low on Pike Lake and has ranged from 0.0 to 0.7.  Two Black Crappies were captured in the gillnets for an abundance of 0.2 per gillnet lift.  Black Crappie mean length was 7.9 inches, but too few individuals were captured to evaluate stock density or growth. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill abundance of 1.7 per trapnet lift was down from 2009 (6.4) and below average when compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Bluegill trapnet abundance has been highly variable in Pike Lake, ranging from 1.5 to 25.2.  Average length of sampled Bluegills was 5.9 inches. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch abundance of 2.0 per gillnet lift was down sharply from 2009 (51.1) and was below average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  This catch represents a historic low for Pike Lake dating back to 1950 over twelve investigations.  Average length of Yellow Perch was 6.4 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nRock Bass trapnet abundance of 10.2 was up from 2009 (6.0) and well above average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Average length was 5.8 inches.  Rock Bass trapnet abundance has been steadily increasing over the last five assessments dating back to 1989.   <br> \n  <br> \nOther fish species sampled include Pumpkinseed Sunfish and White Sucker. <br> \n <br> \nA local resident discovered zebra mussels in Pike Lake during the summer of 2009 and they have since become well established.  The varied sizes of the mussels found in 2009 indicated they had been present in the lake for at least two years.  Zebra mussels are a nonnative invasive species that pose serious ecological and economic threats to Minnesota's lakes and streams.  Heavy infestations can kill native mussels, harm fisheries, litter beaches with sharp shells, clog water intakes, and damage boat motors.  The DNR has designated the lake as infested waters and posted signs to notify those using the public water access.  Designation of the lake prohibits the transport of water and harvest of bait from the lake.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Pike is a 494 acre lake with 135 (27%) acres of littoral area and a maximum depth of 62 feet.  The lake is located just north of Hermantown, MN and has a township administered, concrete, back-in access located off County Road #13.  Walleye fry have been stocked in even years from 1982 through 2008. Pike Lake was last assessed in 2004.  Pike Lake was surveyed during the summer of 2009 to update information about fish populations.  <br> \n <br> \nA local resident discovered zebra mussels in Pike Lake during the summer of 2009.  The zebra mussel is a nonnative invasive species that poses serious ecological and economic threats to Minnesota's lakes and streams.  Heavy infestations can kill native mussels, harm fisheries, litter beaches with sharp shells, clog water intakes, and damage boat motors.  The varied sizes of the mussels found indicate they have been present in the lake for at least two years.  The discovery of zebra mussels in Pike Lake is not surprising due to the location near Lake Superior where they have been present for 20 years.  The infestation is disappointing because the DNR and the local Pike Lake Association have co-sponsored DNR watercraft inspectors at the public water access for several years.  The DNR has designated the lake as infested waters and posted signs to notify those using the public water access.  Designation of the lake prohibits the transport of water and harvest of bait from the lake. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance of 13.0 per gillnet lift was up from 2004 (6.4) and was above average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Walleye average length was 15.8 inches and growth was average when compared to other Duluth Area lakes.  Sixty-two percent of the walleye sampled were over 15 inches in length.  All year-classes from 1998 to 2008 were represented except 1999.  Fifty-eight percent of the walleye aged were from 2006 year-class.  Seventy-five percent of the walleye aged corresponded to stocked year-classes.   <br> \n <br> \nA total of 43 largemouth bass were sampled with electrofishing equipment.  The catch rate of largemouth bass was 67.7 fish per hour of electrofishing on-time.  Largemouth bass average length was 11.5 inches.  All year-classes from 2002 through 2006 were represented in the sample. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike abundance of 0.2 per gillnet lift was down from 2004 (1.7) and below average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Historically, the northern pike CPUE has been relatively low in Pike and has ranged from 0.2 (2009) to 7.0 (1972).  Average length was impressive at 36.3 inches but only two individuals were captured in the gillnets.  All year-classes from 1999 to 2003 were represented. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie abundance of 0.6 per trapnet lift was down slightly from 2004 (0.7) and was below average when compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Black crappie mean length was 9.4 inches, but too few individuals were captured to evaluate stock density or growth. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill abundance of 6.4 per trapnet lift was up from 2004 (3.0) and average when compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Average length of sampled bluegills was 6.6 inches. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch abundance of 51.1 per gillnet lift was up slightly from 2004 (51.0) and was above average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Average length of perch was 6.8 inches.  Only 11% of the perch captured were greater than 8 inches in length. <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species sampled include pumpkinseed, rock bass and white sucker. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",
