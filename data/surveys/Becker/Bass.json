                "narrative": "<p>Bass Lake is a small scenic lake located in the heavily forested region of northeast Becker County.  The shoreline is lightly developed, retaining much of its natural state.  One resort and a handful of cabins occupy the lakes west and northwest shore.  Bass Lake and surrounding lands are within the boundaries of the White Earth Indian Reservation.A relatively lightly fished lake, Bass has long been known for its black crappie and largemouth bass fishery.  Northern pike, walleye and bluegill are also sought from these waters.Walleye were first introduced in 1963 and with maintenance stocking has provided an additional fishery to this bass/panfish lake.  Though never abundant, current walleye numbers are above average for a lake of this type.  Walleye lengths ranged from 10 inches to 27 inches with an average length of 16.7 inches and an average weight of 2.0 pounds.  A large yellow perch population and heavy beds of aquatic vegetation can make walleye angling very challenging.The current bluegill population displays an improved size structure but a much lower level of abundance.  This may be in response to an exploding yellow perch population.  Bluegill lengths ranged from 3.0 inches to 8.0 inches with an average length of 6.7 inches.  The current bluegill size structure would attract little interest from the angler.Yellow perch abundance is up nearly ten fold from the previous assessment, a population shift which can be considered beneficial to the fish community.  Although yellow perch numbers are up, their small average size (6.8 inches) would not appeal to anglers at this time.Northern pike have long maintained self sustaining populations commensurate with their available habitat.  The common problem of northern pike over abundance has rarely occurred in this lake.  The size structure of the northern pike population has improved from previous assessments and currently exhibits an average length of 21.1 inches and an average weight of 2.24 pounds.  Because this species is so easily caught, angler harvest can have a great impact on the size structure of the population.  Release of large northern pike not only preserves a recreational opportunity but can improve the health of the fish community.Black crappie and largemouth bass continue to maintain healthy populations, however additional sampling is needed to better assess their current status.Bass lake offers anglers a multispecies fishing opportunity in a quiet, natural setting.  Conserving this unique experience into the future will require thoughtful shoreline development and responsible fish harvest practices.</p>",

Ecologically, the lake is best suited for northern pike, largemouth bass, and panfish.  These species are self-sustaining in Bass Lake and have maintained relatively stable populations by natural reproduction. <br> \n <br> \nConversely, walleyes have little or no good spawning habitat in this lake and they require stocking to maintain the fishery.  Although walleyes have never been considered abundant in Bass Lake, a modest population has been sustained by fingerling stocking.  Currently, sampled walleyes average just over two pounds each. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike also averaged slightly larger than two pounds in 2008.  No pike over thirty-inches long were found in Bass Lake in 2008. <br> \n <br> \nTest net catches of black crappie have not changed significantly during the past decade, but bluegills and largemouth bass appear to have increased.  Bluegills are slow growing in this lake and none over eight inches in length were sampled in 2003 or 2008.  Black crappies grow at more normal rates and a few were found in the 0.75 to 1.25 pound range. <br> \n <br> \nBeing small, Bass Lake has a fishery that is susceptible to development related pressures, including overharvest.  Fish populations that are heavily exploited tend to be made up of fish that are smaller than what would be considered \"keepers.\"  In other words, fish are cropped off as soon as they reach an acceptable size.  Anglers are encouraged to release a portion of the medium and larger fish caught in order to maintain a more balanced fish community and provide the opportunity to catch large fish in the future.  Release of northern pike twenty- four inches or larger is recommended. <br> \n</p>",

This data will be analyzed in conjunction with the standard survey completed in 2016 to provide a complete assessment of the fish community that will be used to evaluate the biological condition of Bass Lake, and contribute to the assessment of the watershed. <br> \nShoreline seining and backpack-electrofishing were used to sample fish species at ten sights around Bass Lake.  Species sampled with these gear types are not commonly sampled by gill nets and trap nets, which are used during standard surveys.  A good mix of species that require different habitat conditions were sampled in Bass Lake during this assessment.  Species sampled that are intolerant of poor habitat conditions include Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, Pugnose Shiner and Rock Bass.  Other species sampled include Banded Killifish, Bluegill, Bluntnose Minnow, Central Mudminnow, Fathead Minnow, Hybrid Sunfish, Largemouth Bass, Pumpkinseed, Tadpole Madtom, and Yellow Perch.   <br> \nPreservation of aquatic habitat and the use of best management practices for any future development may help maintain the natural habitat that is currently present in Bass Lake.   </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Bass Lake is a small, lightly developed lake in northeastern Becker County.  Ecologically, it is best suited for northern pike, largemouth bass, and panfish.  These species are self sustaining in Bass Lake and have maintained relatively stable populations by natural reproduction.Conversely, walleyes have little or no good spawning habitat in this lake and they require stocking to maintain the fishery.  Although walleyes have never been considered abundant in Bass Lake, a modest population has been sustained by fingerling stocking.  Currently, sampled walleyes average just under two pounds each, but a moderately strong year class of smaller, two year old fish was found.Northern pike averaged slightly larger than two pounds in 2003.  An occasional pike over 30 inches long can be found in Bass Lake.Test net catches of bluegill, black crappie, and largemouth bass have not changed significantly during the past decade.  Bluegills are slow growing in this lake and none over eight inches in length were sampled in 2003.  Black crappies grow at more normal rates and a few were found in the 3/4 to one pound range.Being small, Bass Lake has a fishery that is susceptible to development related pressures, including overharvest.  Fish populations that are heavily exploited tend to be made up of fish that are smaller than what would be considered \"keepers.\"  In other words, fish are cropped off as soon as they reach an acceptable size.  Anglers are encouraged to release a portion of the medium and larger fish caught in order to maintain a more balanced fish community and provide the opportunity to catch large fish in the future.  Release of northern pike 24 inches or larger is recommended.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Bass Lake is a small, lightly-developed lake in northeastern Becker County.  The county-owned boat access has limited parking for one or two rigs.  Ecologically, the lake is best suited for Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, and panfish.  These species are self-sustaining in Bass Lake and have maintained relatively stable populations by natural reproduction. <br> \n <br> \nConversely, Walleyes have little or no good spawning habitat in this lake and they require stocking to maintain the fishery.  Although Walleyes have never been considered abundant in Bass Lake, a modest population has been sustained by fingerling stocking.  Currently, sampled Walleyes average just under two pounds each. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike also averaged slightly less than two pounds in 2014.  Just one pike over thirty-inches long was sampled in Bass Lake in 2014. <br> \n <br> \nTest net catches of Black Crappie have not changed significantly during the past two decades,  Bluegill numbers are holding their own near the lake's normal range and Largemouth Bass are present in modest numbers.  Bluegills are slow growing in this lake but a few over eight inches in length were sampled in 2014.  Black Crappies grow at more normal rates and a wide range of sizes was found up to and over the one pound range. <br> \n <br> \nBeing small, Bass Lake has a fishery that is susceptible to development related pressures, including overharvest.  Fish populations that are heavily exploited tend to be made up of fish that are smaller than what would be considered \"keepers.\"  In other words, fish are cropped off as soon as they reach an acceptable size.  Anglers are encouraged to release a portion of the medium and larger fish caught in order to maintain a more balanced fish community and provide the opportunity to catch large fish in the future.  Release of Northern Pike twenty- four inches or larger is recommended.</p>",

Northern pike are abundant but tend to be small due to below average growth, average weight is 1.5 lbs. However, northern pike up to 15 lbs. have been taken in the past.  Largemouth bass and black crappies appear tobe present in significant numbers but need further study to fully assess their populations.  Largemouth bassnatural reproduction appears to be good and growth rate is average or slightly above.  Black crappie growth rateis fast and most surveys have recorded the presence of one pound plus crappies.  This lake does not seem to havethe elements that would enable it to consistently produce big bluegills like some other lakes.  Bluegills herehave generally tended to be small with only occasional catches of larger bluegills.  Walleye fingerling stockingcombined with some natural reproduction has produced an excellent walleye population.  The abundance of walleyeis currently above normal abundance for this lake class with an average weight of 2.4 lbs.As indicated above, Bass Lake is a small and \"off the beaten path\" lake.  Large segments of the shoreline remainundeveloped.  Significant bulrush beds and other aquatic vegetation present in these undeveloped areas arecritical to the well being of the lake and fish community.  Minimal disturbance of these areas and the aquaticvegetation should be a high priority.</p>",
