The reclamation appears to have been a success and growth has been fast for the first year class produced.  Beginning in 1996, fishing should be good for bluegill, perch, and northern pike.  As they grow, largemouth bass, black crappie, and channel catfish should provide angling opportunities.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A resurvey was conducted at Sleepy Eye Lake in 2011 to monitor the Lake's chemical, physical, and biological characteristics.  Sleepy Eye was reclaimed with rotenone in 1993 and a significant recreational fishery has developed.  Frequent winterkill was noted as a limiting factor in past Lake Management Plans, but the last reported winterkill event was in 1986.  Dredging, aeration, reclamation, reductions in carp and bullhead, mild winters, and increases in the abundance of submergent vegetation may all have been responsible for the lack of winterkill over the last 25 years.  Sleepy Eye's lakeshed (959 acres) was dominated by row crop agriculture.  The lake to lakeshed ratio was roughly 1:4.  Submergent vegetation was plentiful at Sleepy Eye Lake in 2011.  The vegetation survey ranked coontail, muskgrass, and sago pondweed as common while northern watermilfoil, another native species, was classified as abundant.  Dense beds of curlyleaf pondweed, an exotic - invasive species, were present in late June.  For shoalwater substrates, sand and silt were rated as being common.  Much of the shoreline was undeveloped with only 6 homes being counted.  A fishing pier was present at the County Park on the northeast shore and a swimming beach was present on the southeast shore.    <br> \n    <br> \nGill nets sampled 8 walleye for a catch rate of 1.3/net, which was within the normal range for this type of lake.  The 2006 catch rate was 0.0/net.  Only one other walleye has been sampled in gill or trap nets since the 1993 chemical reclamation.  Walleye were last stocked into Sleepy Eye Lake in 1981, so the origins of the 2011 fish were unknown.  In 2011, walleye were 17.9 to 25.2 inches long with an average of 22.1.  Gill netted walleye were 4 to 10 years old with 4 year-classes being present.  Growth was fast.     <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled 15 northern pike for a catch rate of 2.5/net, which was within the normal range for this type of lake.  The 2006 catch rate was five times lower at 0.5/net.  Catch rates from 1983 to 2011 (n=17) ranged from 0.5 to 26.5/net with an average of 7.5.  Catch rates from 1994 to 2011 (n=13) ranged from 0.5 to 26.5/net with an average of 9.1.  In 2011, gill netted northern pike were 18.9 to 31.9 inches long with an average of 23.5.  Trap nets sampled 1 northern pike that was 33.3 inches long.  Northern pike were 2 to 4 years old with 3 year-classes present.  Northern pike fry were stocked annually, except for 2007, which indicated that natural reproduction was occurring.  Growth was fast.  A robust fishery has been slow to redevelop following the partial summerkill in 2003.   <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled 44 yellow perch for a catch rate of 7.3/net, which was within the normal range for this type of lake.  The 2006 catch rate was 6.0/net.  Catch rates from 1983 to 2011 (n=17) were highly variable ranging from 0.0 to 139.5/net with an average of 36.8.  Catch rates from 1994 to 2011 (n=13) were also highly variable ranging from 1.5 to 139.5/net with an average of 44.0.  Gill netted yellow perch were 5.0 to 9.2 inches long with an average of 6.0.  Only 1 fish was 8 inches or longer.  Yellow perch were 2 to 6 years old with 5 year-classes present.  Age 3 fish (2008 year-class) made up 73% of the gill net catch.  Yellow perch are likely an important forage fish for predators at Sleepy Eye Lake.  <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled 204 black crappie for a catch rate of 34.0/net, which was above the normal range for this type of lake.  It was also the highest catch rate following the 1993 chemical reclamation.  The 2006 catch rate was also high (18.0/net).  Gill net catch rates from 1983 to 2011 were highly variable, ranging from 0.0 to 71.3/net with an average of 12.7.  Catch rates from 1994 to 2011 ranged from 0.0 to 34.0/net with an average of 8.6.  In 2011, gill netted black crappie were 5.1 to 9.5 inches long with an average of 5.9.  Only 1 fish was 8 inches or longer.  The trap net catch rate (9.8/net) was within the normal range for this type of lake.  The 2006 trap net catch rate was approximately ten times lower at 0.9/net.  Trap net catch rates from 1983 to 2011 (n=17) were highly variable, ranging from 0.0 to 169.8/net with an average of 14.1.  Catch rates from 1994 to 2011 (n=13) ranged from 0.0 to 13.6/net with an average of 3.7.  Trap netted black crappie were 5.2 to 7.9 inches long with an average of 5.9.  In 2011, black crappie were estimated to be 3 to 7 years old with 5 year-classes present.   Only one of the year-classes (2008) appeared to be strong, accounting for 98% of the aged fish.  Growth was slow.     <br> \n <br> \nTrap nets sampled 477 bluegill for a catch rate of 53.0/net, which was within the normal range for this type of lake.  The 2006 catch rate was also high at 71.7/net.  Catch rates from 1983 to 2011 (n=17) were highly variable ranging from 4.5 to 125.5/net with an average of 35.7.  Catch rates from 1994 to 2011 (n=13) ranged from 14.9 to 71.7/net with an average of 34.7.  In 2011, trap netted bluegill were 3.9 to 7.8 inches long with an average of 6.0.  Approximately 58% of the trap net catch was 6 inches or longer, while 4% of the catch was 7 inches or longer.  In 2011, trap netted bluegill were 3 to 7 years old with 5 year-classes present.  Age 3, 4, and 5 fish were well represented, accounting for 86% of the trap net sample.  Growth was moderate.     <br> \n    <br> \nSpring night-time electrofishing sampled 49 largemouth bass for a catch rate of 56.0/hr.  The catch rate in 2006 was 91.4/hr.  Electrofished largemouth bass were 7.1 to 20.6 inches long with an average of 13.5.  Approximately, 61% of the sample was 12 inches or longer and 39% was 15 inches or longer.  The catch rate and the size distribution indicated that a quality population was present.  Trophy sized largemouth bass were also present, with two fish being at least 20 inches long.  Largemouth bass were 2 to 11 years old with 10 year-classes present, indicating good natural reproduction.  Growth was moderate to fast. <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled 2 channel catfish for a catch rate of 0.3/net.  Channel catfish were 12.5 and 24.6 inches long.  Channel catfish fingerlings (6,090) were last stocked in 2008 and were no longer stocked after that year.  Channel catfish were 3 and 9 years old.     <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled 259 black bullhead for a catch rate of 43.2/net, which was within the normal range for this type of lake.  The 2006 gill net catch rate was similar at 60.0/net.  The 2011 trap net catch rate was 47.1/net.  Although black bullhead were still the most abundant fish gill netted and second most abundant fish trap netted, they no longer dominated the net catches as they did in the 1980's and early 1990's.  In 2011, gill netted black bullhead were 6.5 to 12.0 inches long with an average of 9.7.  Approximately 7% of the gill net catch was 11 inches or longer.     <br> \n  <br> \nCarp were not netted in 2011, and have not been sampled in Sleepy Eye Lake since 1992. <br> \n</p>",

Currently, the yellow perch population is the most attractive component of this community, with the average fish being 8 inches long.  Good numbers of bluegills exist between 7-8.5 inches, but crappie numbers are low, with few fish exceeding 7 inches.  Northern pike are moderate in abundance, with the average fish being 22 inches long and weighing 2.7 pounds.  Black bullheads are also of a desirable size, with most fish between 9-11 inches.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>     The 1993 reclamation of Sleepy Eye Lake effectively created populations of game fish desired by anglers.  The 1998 fisheries assessment showed that Sleepy Eye Lake offers very good angling opportunities for northern pike, bluegills and black crappies.  While the average growth rates of the sampled pike, bluegills and crappies were above average, few fish of quality length were sampled.  This is due, in part, to the relatively new fish community in the lake following the 1993 reclamation which eliminated most of the fish in the lake at that time.  However, the current lack of larger, quality size fish in Sleepy Eye Lake, is also related to angler harvest of pike, bluegills and crappies as soon as the fish reach an acceptable size.  Anglers should practice catch and release or selective harvest by voluntarily limiting how many fish they remove from the lake.</p>",

After reclamation in 1993, a quality fishery developed in Sleepy Eye Lake.  Northern pike had been captured at moderate to high levels from 1994 through the August 2003 assessment.  Shortly after the assessment a summer kill of northern pike occurred likely due to high water temperature and low dissolved oxygen levels.  The summer kill was limited exclusively to northern pike.  Other species were unaffected.  Northern pike adults were stocked in fall 2003 to reestablish pike in Sleepy Eye Lake.  Future stockings should reestablish a quality northern pike fishery.  In 2003 most pike were only 2 years old and around 20 inches long.  Bluegill are common with fish up to 8 inches present.  Black crappie are present at a low abundance, the largest are around 10 inches.  Other species present include yellow perch, largemouth bass and black bullhead.  </p>",

Adult game fish were stocked in the spring, and from age-growth analysis, many of the fish sampled appear to be from these stockings.  Black crappies now average 2.67/trapnet, compared to 169.75/trapnet in ?83.  White crappies were not sampled, but averaged 45.00/trapnet in ?83 netting.  Bluegills average 12.5/trapnet, compared to 125.50/trapnet in ?83.  In ?83, bluegills, black crappie, and white crappie were dominated by large age 3 year classes.  Northern pike now average 1.0/gillnet, compared to 2.83/gillnet in ?83.  The northern pike population is dominated by young of the year fish, and it appears spawning was good in ?86.  The northern pike population in ?83 was dominated by age 3 fish, with few 4, 5, and 6 year olds.  Yellow perch were not captured during the ?83 survey, but were abundant in '86, averaging 34.67/gillnet.  Yellow perch are dominated by age 1 fish, with a few age 2 fish also sampled.  The large black bullhead population that has dominated in recent years is still present.  Bullheads averaged 217.00/gillnet, compared to 235.00/gillnet in ?83.  Many of the bullheads in ?83 ranged in size from 5.5\" - 6.5\", compared to the 7.5\" - 8.9\" bullheads present in ?86.  Other species present in relatively low numbers include largemouth bass, white sucker, and pumpkinseed sunfish.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A standard survey (gill netting, trap netting, and spring night-time electrofishing targeting Largemouth Bass) was conducted at Sleepy Eye Lake in 2016 to monitor the Lake's fish population.  A total of 9 species were sampled, plus Hybrid Sunfish.  On 6/20/16, the lake was not mixed with oxygen dropping below 2 mg/l in 17' of water, limiting fish usage of deeper water.  Water clarity was marginal, with a secchi disk reading of 4.6' due to an algae bloom.  Sleepy Eye was reclaimed with rotenone in 1993 and a significant recreational fishery has been present ever since.  An aeration system was operated during severe winters at Sleepy Eye.  Curlyleaf Pondweed, an invasive aquatic plant, can be abundant in May and June at Sleepy Eye Lake, but usually dies back by July.  Campsites and a fishing pier were available on the north end of the lake.       <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled low numbers (8) Walleye for a catch rate of 1.3/net, which was within the normal range for lakes similar to Sleepy Eye.  The 2011 catch rate was also 1.3/net.  Historical catch rates (n=18) from 1983 to 2016 were mostly low ranging from 0.0 to 1.3/net with an average of 0.2.  The current stocking regime (305 pounds of fall yearlings - one in three years) was initiated in 2012.  The reason for stocking larger fall yearlings, instead of the typical fall fingerlings, was to reduce predation by the lake's abundant predators (Northern Pike and Largemouth Bass).  In 2016, Walleye were 14.7 to 21.7 inches long with an average of 18.3.  Trap nets sampled Walleye up to 25.2 inches in length.  Walleye (gill and trap netted) were age-2 to age-8 with four year classes being present.  Approximately 75% of the gill net aged Walleye matched up with stocked year classes.  Growth was fast.   <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled moderate numbers (54) of Northern Pike for a catch rate of 9.0/net, which was within the normal range for similar to Sleepy Eye.  The 2011 catch rate was 2.5/net.  Catch rates from 1983 to 2016 (n=18) were variable ranging from 0.5 to26.5/net with an average of 7.6, indicating moderate recruitment (>5/net and <10/net) most years.  Catch rates from 1994 to 2016 (n=14) ranged from 0.5 to 26.5/net with an average of 9.1.  In 2016, gill netted Northern Pike were 17.8 to35.9 inches long with an average of 23.3.  Approximately 70% of the gill net catch was 21 inches or longer, while 7% were 28 inches or longer, indicating a quality size structure.  Northern Pike were age-2 to age-7 years old with five year classes present.  The current Northern Pike fry stocking regime was 50,000 fry - annually.  The only year that Northern Pike fry were not stocked, from 2009 to 2016, was 2013, due to a shortage that spring.  Approximately 24% of the gill net aged fish were age-3 (2013 year class), indicating that natural reproduction was occurring.  The contributions from stocked fry and natural reproduction, during stocked years, was unknown.  Growth was moderate.   <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled moderate numbers (86) of Yellow Perch for a catch rate of 14.3/net, which was within the normal range for similar to Sleepy Eye .  The 2011 catch rate was 7.3/net.  Catch rates from 1983 to 2016 (n=18) were highly variable ranging from 0.0 to 139.5/net with an average of 35.6.  Catch rates from 1994 to 2016 (n=14) were also highly variable ranging from 1.5 to 139.5/net with an average of 41.9.  Gill netted Yellow Perch were 5.4 to 9.0 inches long with an average of 6.7.  Approximately 6% of the catch was 8 inches or longer, indicating a poor size structure, as far as anglers would be concerned.  Yellow Perch were likely an important forage item for many fish species at Sleepy Eye Lake.   <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled moderate numbers (75) of Black Crappie for a catch rate of 12.5/net, which was within the normal range for similar to Sleepy Eye.  The 2011 catch rate was much higher (34.0/net).  Gill net catch rates from 1983 to 2016 (n=18) were highly variable, ranging from 0.0 to 71.3/net with an average of 12.7.  Catch rates from 1994 to 2016 ranged from 0.0 to 34.0/net with an average of 8.9.  In 2016, gill netted Black Crappie were 4.6 to 9.2 inches long with an average of 6.1.  Approximately 5% of the gill net catch was 8 inches or longer, indicating a poor size structure.  Trap nets sampled low numbers (40) of Black Crappie for a catch rate of 4.4/net, which was within the normal range for similar to Sleepy Eye.  The 2011 trap net catch rate was 9.8/net.  Trap net catch rates from 1983 to 2016 (n=18) were highly variable, ranging from 0.0 to 169.8/net with an average of 13.6.  Catch rates from 1994 to 2016 (n=14) ranged from 0.0 to 13.6/net with an average of 3.8.  Trap netted Black Crappie were 4.9 to 9.7 inches long with an average of 6.8.  In 2016, Black Crappie were estimated to be age-2 to age-9 with seven year classes present.  Age-2 and age-7 fish accounted for 49% and 38% of the gill net sample, respectively.  Those two year classes could be considered to be moderate in size, while all others were weak.  Growth was slow.      <br> \n   <br> \nTrap nets sampled high numbers (421) of Bluegill for a catch rate of 46.8/net, which was within the normal range for similar to Sleepy Eye.  The 2011 catch rate was 53.0/net.  Catch rates from 1983 to 2016 (n=18) were highly variable ranging from 4.5 to 125.5/net with an average of 36.3.  Catch rates from 1994 to 2016 (n=14) ranged from 14.9 to 71.7/net with an average of 35.5.  In 2016, trap netted Bluegill were 3.5 to 8.6 inches long with an average of 6.2.  Approximately 75% of the trap net catch was 6 inches or longer while 5% were 7 inches or longer.  In 2016, trap netted Bluegill were age-3 to age-10 years old with eight year classes present.  Age-7 fish made up the bulk (72%) of the trap net aged fish.  Growth was slow, due to the high numbers of fish present.      <br> \n   <br> \nSpring night-time electrofishing sampled high numbers (57) Largemouth Bass for a catch rate of 56.0/hr.  This was the third time that electrofishing was used to sample Largemouth Bass at Sleepy Eye Lake.  The catch rates in 2006 and 2011 were 91.4/hr. and 56.0/hr., respectively.  Electrofished Largemouth Bass were 4.9 to 19.7 inches long with an average of 11.3.  Approximately 37% of the catch was 12 inches or longer while 23% were 15 inches or longer.  The catch rate and the size distribution indicated that a quality population was present.  Fish were age-1 to age-11 with eleven year classes being present, indicating somewhat consistent recruitment.  Growth was moderate.     <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled 1 Channel Catfish for a catch rate of 0.2/net.  Historical catch rates (n=16) from 1983 to 2016 were mostly low, ranging from 0.0 to 2.0/net with an average of 0.2.  The Channel Catfish was 29.1 inches long.  Channel Catfish fingerlings were last stocked in 2008.       <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled low numbers (30) of Black Bullhead for a catch rate of 5.0/net, which was below the normal range for similar to Sleepy Eye and the lowest measured in the last 21 years at Sleepy Eye.  The 2011 gill net catch rate was much higher (43.2/net).  Historic catch rates from 1983 to 2016 were mostly high ranging from 0.0 to 235.0/net with an average of 87.8.  In 2016, gill netted Black Bullhead were 6.8 to 12.9 inches long with an average of 9.3.  Trap nets also sampled low numbers (29) of Black Bullhead for a catch rate of 3.2/net, which was within the normal range for similar to Sleepy Eye and was the lowest since the 1996 assessment (2.3/net).  Trap nets sampled fish up to 13.9 inches in length.     <br> \n <br> \nGill nets did not sample any Common Carp in 2016.  Trap nets sampled low numbers (2) of Common Carp for a catch rate of 0.2/net which was below the normal range for similar to Sleepy Eye .  Common Carp were not netted (gill or trap nets) in 2011, and had not been sampled since 1992 (pre-reclamation).  In 2016, the Common Carp were 24.0 and 28.1 inches long.  It was unknown how this species got back into the lake, particularly at large adult sizes. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A special assessment was conducted to monitor the Sleepy Eye Lake fishery following the 1993 reclamation.Trap netted bluegill were abundant, unfortunately they only averaged 5.1 inches.  Approximately 8% of the bluegill sampled were at least 6 inches and 5% were at least 7 inches.  Low numbers of northern pike were gill netted ranging in size from 20.3-28.8 inches, averaging 23.6 inches (2.9 pounds).  The 2003 summerkill may be responsible for this lower catch rate.  Northern pike fry have been stocked annually since 1998.  Spring night-time electrofishing is the standard gear for sampling largemouth bass, but was not conducted in 2004.  A total of 1 largemouth was captured in a trap net.  The fish was 20.1 inches and weighed 6.2 pounds.  The relative abundance of this species is unknown.  Only 1 walleye was sampled.  The fish was 16.7 inches long and was from the 2001 year class.  Moderate numbers of black crappie were sampled, but size was small.  Gill netted black crappie averaged 6.4 inches and the longest fish was 7.2 inches.  Moderate numbers of black bullhead were trap netted, with fish averaging 8.2 inches.  Some of the larger black bullhead, up to 13.6 inches, may appeal to anglers.  Channel catfish and carp were not sampled in 2004.    </p>",

Northerns were present in about the state average and most are probably from stocking.  Two smaller northerns were sampled in shoreline seining, a young of the year and a yearling.  Black crappie were represented by a strong year class of 3 year old fish, about 5 times the local average.  White crappie were abundant, about 7 times the local average and represented by 2 & 3 year olds.  Bluegill were caught in over 3.5 times the local average and dominated by 3 year old fish.  Black bullheads made up most of the roughfish population.  They were caught in about 12 times the local average.  A few yellow bullhead and white sucker are present.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Sleepy Eye Lake was reclaimed in 1993, and the fish population continues to be monitored annually.  Current observations include a diverse assemblage of aquatic vegetation and excellent water clarity.  Locals report excellent fishing for panfish and pike.  The vegetation in the lake has provided good habitat and helps to maintain the water quality that better suits a gamefish population.  It is important to focus on watershed improvements such as stormwater management and shoreline protection in order to preserve the current quality of Sleepy Eye Lake.  Proposed dredging projects could put recent water-quality and fish-community improvements at risk.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Sleepy Eye is a smaller sized lake (240 acres) located adjacent to the City of Sleepy Eye in Brown County. A large city-owned access with a double cement boat ramp is located on the north shore within the Sleepy Eye Sportsmen's Park. Sleepy Eye Lake has 4 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 21 feet. The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MNDNR) has divided Minnesota's lakes into 44 different classes based on physical and chemical characteristics. Sleepy Eye is a class 38 lake and another similar lake in the Hutchinson Fisheries Management Area is Ripley Lake in Meeker County. A fishing pier is present at the park on the north side of the lake. <br> \n <br> \nSleepy Eye Lake is known as one of the best multi-species fisheries in Brown County and the 2021 netting results confirmed this. Walleye stocking resumed at Sleepy Eye Lake in 2012, but net catches were low in 2016. However, the Walleye catch jumped up dramatically in 2021, with high numbers of nice sized fish being sampled. Walleye averaged 21 inches in length with maximum length being 26 inches. Good numbers of Northern Pike were also netted, averaging 22 inches with maximum length of 33 inches. Big Largemouth Bass were also captured in the gill nets with fish just under 20 inches in length being taken. Black Crappie numbers were down a bit from previous surveys, and lengths were small. Sleepy Eye Lake is not known for its large crappies. Bluegill seemed plentiful, with many smaller sized fish captured. However, some Bluegill were slightly over 7 inches in length. Moderate numbers of Yellow Perch were encountered in the nets. Most of the perch were small, but a few reached 10 inches in length. <br> \n <br> \nOther species that anglers may encounter at Sleepy Eye Lake include Black Bullhead and the very rare Channel Catfish. <br> \n <br> \nPeople can have significant impacts on lakes and the fish populations they support. Overharvest, lakeshore development, removal of shoreline vegetation, and introductions of invasive species can all adversely affect fish populations. Aquatic invasive species (AIS) are typically moved from infested to non-infested waters by anglers, boaters and lakeshore owners, and can adversely impact lakes and fish populations. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants and animals from their watercraft and drain all lake water from their boat and bait buckets before leaving the lake. If you suspect an infestation of an invasive species in this lake, save a specimen and report it to a local DNR office. Additional information on all of these topics can be found on the DNR website (www.dnr.state.mn.us) or by contacting the Hutchinson Area Fisheries office.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>STATUS OF THE FISHERY:\nThis population assessment was done to determine the contribution and growth rate of stocked crappie and bluegill.  Black crappie and bluegill ages 2 and 3 were stocked in the fall of 1990 at 10 lb./acre.  Black crappie abundance increased from 2.67/trap net in 1986 to 11.0/trap net.  Black crappie sampled are represented by 1, 3, and 4 year olds.  The four year olds were most abundant.  Stocked crappie, aged prior to stocking, would be ages 3 and 4; it is unclear at this time as to what extent they contributed to the population, but the presence of age 1 fish suggests successful reproduction.  Growth for black crappie is good.  Bluegill abundance remained unchanged from 12.5/trap net in 1986 to 12.75/trap net in 1990.  Bluegill are equally represented by ages 3 and 4 in netting.  This corresponds to the age classes of stocked bluegills, which were aged prior to stocking.  It is suspected that a significant number of bluegills are from the 1990 stocking.  Bluegill have shown good growth and have a favorable size distribution, 6.0-7.9 inches.  Northern pike average 4.00/gill net compared to 1.00/gill net sampled in 1986.  Northern pike are represented by ages 3 and 4.  Northern exhibit fast growth and are evenly distributed from 23.0-33.9 inches.  Yellow perch declined from 34.67/gill net to in 1986 to 13.0/gill net.  Perch are represented by ages 2-4 with most fish 6.5-7.9 inches.  Five channel catfish were sampled and were 14.0-16.9 inches.  Channel catfish were stocked as yearlings in 1988.  Black bullhead remain abundant averaging 163.75/gill net compared to 217.00/gill net in 1986.  Black bullhead appear to be represented by a single year class of 6.5-7.4 inch fish compared to the 7.0-8.9 inch population in 1986.  Carp were sampled for the first time, and occurred at 2.75/trap net.  Source of the carp is unknown, though migration is unlikely because of the complex route the fish would have to travel.  Most of the carp were 12.0-14.9 inches.  Other species sampled in relatively low numbers include pumpkinseed, hybrid sunfish, and largemouth bass.    </p>",

Black crappie abundance is unchanged from 1991, averaging 7.5/trap net and 17.0/gill net compared to 11.0/trap net and 14.0/gill net in 1991.  Black crappie are represented by ages 1-5 with age 1 and 5 most abundant.  Stocked crappies correspond to ages 4 and 5.  Black crappie sampled in 1991 were represented by 1, 3, and 4 year olds.  Growth remains good for age 1 and 2 black crappie, and is average for older fish.  Bluegill abundance has declined from 12.75/trap net in 1991 netting to 4.5/trap net.  Bluegill were represented by 3 and 4 year olds in 1991 netting and correspond to like aged fish stocked in 1990.  Bluegills are now represented by ages 1, 3, and 6, with 4 and 5 year olds most abundant, which correspond to stocked fish.  Northern pike abundance remains unchanged from 1991, 4.0/gill net.  Seven of the thirteen northern pike netted had fin clips, with four of them age 1 and with the remaining age 2, 3, and 4.  Northerns stocked in 1991/1992 were fingerling/adults (296) that were marked with a pelvic clip.  Northerns are dominated by age 1 with fewer 2-6 year olds netted.  Northerns continue to exhibit fast growth.  Six channel catfish corresponding to the 1988 yearling stocking, were sampled.  Yellow perch continue to decline from 34.67/gill net and 13.0/gill net in 1986 and 1991, respectively, to 7.0/gill net.  Yellow perch are well represented by ages 1-3 compared to the 2-4 year olds sampled in 1991.  Black bullhead remain abundant, averaging 171.00/gill net compared to 163.75/gill net in 1991.  Two cohorts seem to be present with the 7.0-9.0 inch fish more abundant than the 4.5-5.5 inch fish.  Carp numbers are increasing with 21 fish netted compared to 15 netted in 1991 (the first year they were sampled).  Other species present in low numbers include pumpkinseed, white crappie, and walleye.</p>",
