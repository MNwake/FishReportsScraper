Mean weight was 5.22 pounds as compared to 4.85 pounds in 1981.  Growth rate was average at all annulus.  The yellow perch was low at 3.67 per set and have shown a real decline from the 1981 catch of 10.33.  Length frequency ranged from 5.0 to 8.9 inches with a median length of 6.5 to 6.9 inches.  The bluegill sunfish was slightly high at 31.00 per set and ranged in size from 3.0 to 7.9 inches with a median length of 5.5 to 5.9 inches.  The largemouth bass was absent in the trap net catch but was present in the gillnet catch at 0.83 or over twice the local median of 0.35.  Young-of-the-year largemouth (8) were taken in the shoreline seining to confirm natural reproduction.  The largemouth bass showed average growth for I annulus and slow growth for II, III and IV annulus.  As has been its history, the black crappie population continues to be extremely low at 0.50 per set despite efforts to increase the population by stocking 600 pre-spawn adult black crappies in 1984.  The white sucker, black and yellow bullhead, bowfin, carp, green sunfish and hybrid sunfish had low population figures.  The walleye was absent in the net catches in this survey but the survey crew received reports of walleyes being caught by anglers this year to indicate their presence in the lake.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lewis Lake is a 220-acre basin managed primarily for Walleye and Northern Pike.  Minnesota lakes managed for fishing are grouped into lake classes based on physical, chemical, and biological similarities.  Lewis Lake is assigned to lake class 29.  In order to compare the present fish population to others in the lake class and to evaluate management goals, a population assessment was conducted on Lewis Lake in August 2013. <br> \n <br> \nThe lake's management plan now calls for Walleye fingerling stocking (148 pounds) annually.  Long-range management goals are to sustain a moderate Walleye population with a target catch rate of 2.5 per gillnet.  The long-range goal for Northern Pike is more trophy oriented with a target weight of 4 pounds.  Factors limiting the fishery include a low Yellow Perch forage base and limited spawning habitat for Walleye and Northern Pike. <br> \n <br> \nThe Yellow Perch abundance remains low.  Gillnet catch rates have been 1 per lift or less since 1996.  Only 6 Perch were caught in the six gill net sets.  Yellow Perch are an important forage base for both Walleye and Northern Pike.  Spawning habitat didn't appear limiting with both brush and vegetation present in shallow water areas.   <br> \n <br> \nThe Walleye gillnet catch, 1.3/set, while very similar to the previous assessment, was below both the management goal and lake class 25th percentile.  Sampled Walleye ranged in length from 11.1 to 22.2 inches with a 15.7-inch and 1.5 pound mean.  Otolith samples assigned Walleyes to five year classes, all associated to stocking years.  Half the catch was the apparent result of the 2011 fingerling stocking.  These 2-year-old fish averaged 12.5 inches. <br> \n <br> \nThe lake historically has had a low Northern Pike population dominated by large fish.  The catch rate, 4 per gillnet, was below the 25th percentile for the lake class but the management goal for size was met with a 5 pound average.  Captured Northerns ranged from 20.8 to 36.3 inches with a 27.3-inch average.  Cleithra samples distributed Northerns among eight year classes.  Pike ranged in age from 2 to 11 years.  Growth was fast until slowing at age eight.   <br> \n <br> \nAlthough normal when compared to similar lakes, Black Crappie abundance and size both decreased when compared to the previous two assessments.   The combined catch averaged 7.6 inches and a quarter pound.  <br> \n <br> \nThe trap net catch rate for Bluegill was 4.4 per set, the lowest recorded on the lake and below the normal range for the lake class.  Unfortunately, there was no compensatory increase in size.  Bluegills remain small with a 4.7 inch mean.   <br> \n <br> \nA quality Largemouth Bass and Northern Pike fishery is present in Lewis Lake.  Although they failed to meet management goals, Walleye add a bonus aspect for anglers.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lewis Lake is a 220-acre basin managed primarily for walleye and northern pike.  Minnesota lakes managed for fishing are grouped into lake classes based on physical, chemical, and biological similarities.  Lewis Lake is assigned to lake class 29.  In order to compare the present fish population to others in the lake class and to evaluate management goals, a population assessment was conducted on Lewis Lake in August 2006. <br> \n <br> \nThe lake's management plan calls for walleye fingerling stocking (148 pounds) on alternate years.  Long-range management goals are to sustain a moderate walleye population with a target catch rate of 2.5 per gillnet.  The long-range goal for northern pike is more trophy oriented with a target weight of 4 pounds.  Factors limiting the fishery include a low yellow perch forage base and limited spawning habitat for walleye and northern pike. <br> \n <br> \nAs in the two previous investigations, the yellow perch gillnet catch was low compared to other similar lakes.  Only two perch were caught in the six gill net sets.  Yellow perch are an important forage base for both walleye and northern pike.  Spawning habitat didn't appear limiting with both brush and vegetation present in shallow water areas.   <br> \n <br> \nThe walleye gillnet catch, 1.2/set, was a slight decrease from the last two samplings and below both the management goal and lake class 25th percentile.  Sampled walleye were smaller than in 2001, ranging in length from 13.2 to 22.9 inches with a 15.6-inch and 1.4 pound mean.  Walleye averaged 2.5 pounds in 2001.  Otolith and scale aging found a dominant 2003-year class.  These 3-year-old fish can be attributed to the 2004 yearling stocking.  Other year classes present were 1995, 1996, 2001, and 2002.  All year classes could be associated to a fall stocking.  Walleye growth was typical of the statewide average. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike were sampled at a rate of 4.8 per gillnet.  The catch rate was above the 25th percentile for the lake class but down from the record high of 10.5 per gillnet in 2001.  The lake historically has had a low northern population dominated by large fish.  While the catch didn't meet the management goal for size, the 3.5-pound mean was an improvement over the previous average of 2 pounds.  Captured northerns ranged from 18.6 to 35 inches with a 22.9-inch average.  Scale aging indicated that the 2002 and 2003 year classes (3 and 4 year old fish) accounted for 69% of the catch.  Growth was normal compared to the statewide rate.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie were present at normal levels in the trap nets, while the gill net catch was high (10.3/set).  The combined catch averaged 7.1 inches and 0.2 pounds.  Means were 8.7 inches and 0.4 pounds in 2001.  Trap netted crappies were noticeably larger than those from the gill nets and similar in size to the combined catch from 2001.  The length frequency of gill netted crappies was bimodal at 5 and 9-inch intervals.  Although crappie were not aged, it is apparent that a large year class is poised to enter the fishery in the coming two or three years.   <br> \n <br> \nThe trap net catch rate for bluegill was 14 per set, which falls in the normal range for the lake class.  Bluegill remain small.  The largest bluegill sampled was 6.7 inches with more than 70% of the catch less than 6 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass were sampled at a rate of 71.9 per hour during night electrofishing.  Lengths ranged from 6.9 to 19.1 inches with a 13.6-inch and 1.6 pound average.  Seventy percent of the bass catch exceeded 12 inches while 31 percent were over 15 inches.  The previous two assessments found fewer and smaller bass.  The 2000 year class was the most abundant, representing more the a fourth of the catch.  These six-year-old fish averaged 13.1 inches.  Bass growth was a little slower than the state wide average.  <br> \n <br> \nAlthough the 2006 assessment found northern and walleye both below their management goals, a quality largemouth bass and northern pike fishery is present.  Walleye add a bonus aspect for anglers while crappie-angling opportunities should increase in the next 2 to 3 years.    <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lewis Lake is a 179-acre lake located in Kanabec County.  The lake is managed primarily for Largemouth Bass and Northern Pike, with Black Crappie and Bluegill as secondary management species. A population assessment was conducted in 2021 via spring electrofishing for Largemouth Bass and summer trap nets and gill nets.    <br> \n <br> \nThe Northern Pike gill net catch rate was 9.2 fish per net. This catch is above the long-term average of 4.87 fish per net. Mean length of Northern Pike in gill nets was 24.0 inches, with a range of 12.1 to 36.2 inches. Northern Pike were, on average, larger in 2021 than during the previous survey.   <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch have historically fluctuated in abundance in Lewis Lake. The 2021 total catch of 17.6 per gill net was the highest, both in catch rate and total number, in the last nine surveys on the lake, and well above the historic average catch of 5.0 fish per net.  The average length of Yellow Perch sampled was 6.4 inches with sizes ranging from 5.6 to 9.5 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nBased on the 2021 gill net catch of Black Crappie, the abundance was low yet close to the historical average with a catch rate of just 0.8 per net. In addition to the fish caught in gill nets, Black Crappies were also captured in the trap nets at a catch rate of 2.7 fish per net, within normal range. The average size of these fish was 8.3 inches with a length range of 4.9 to 10.6 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nTrap nets were used to characterize Bluegill abundance and size range. The catch rate was 22.8 per net in 2021, well above the previous survey and the most caught in any survey dating back to 1971. Bluegill sampled in trap nets ranged in size from 3.0 to 8.5 inches with 35 percent of the catch 7 inches or greater.   The mean length was 6.1 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nThe Largemouth Bass catch rate increased slightly from the most recent sampling to 81.3 per hour in 2021, the highest catch rate recorded on Lewis Lake. Mean length was 10.5 inches with a length range of 4.7 to 19.0 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nOverall, the fishing on Lewis Lake for many species should be quite good.  There are good numbers of Yellow Perch, Bluegill, Largemouth bass, and Northern Pike based on sampling with gill nets, trap nets, and electrofishing.   <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of nearshore fish species in Lewis Lake was conducted on July 18-20, 2022, by Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program staff. Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake, and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at ten sampling stations, but three stations were sampled from the boat due to site conditions. Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample three stations, a 15-foot seine was used at four stations, and site conditions prevented the use of seines at three stations. Nearshore sampling captured sixteen species of fish including six species that are intolerant of disturbance (i.e., Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, Least Darter, and Pugnose Shiner) and one that is tolerant of disturbance (i.e., Green Sunfish). <br> \n <br> \nA concurrent summer trap net survey was also conducted by IBI Program staff. Nine trap nets were set along the shoreline in locations that encompassed multiple habitat types. Trap net sampling captured eight species of fish, including two that are tolerant of disturbance (i.e., Black Bullhead and Green Sunfish). Bluegill comprised a majority of the catch by number and biomass. <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore and trap net data were combined with gill net data from a July 2021 survey to describe the fish community and provide a fish-based IBI (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment. In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g., Blackchin Shiner, Iowa Darter, and Rock Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g., Black Bullhead and Green Sunfish). The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website. <br> \n <br> \nResults from this survey indicate that the fish community in Lewis Lake is healthy as indicated by an FIBI score that exceeds the exceptional use threshold determined for similar lakes. These results will be considered when the biological health of the lake is assessed during the Rum River Watershed assessment process, which will be completed in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>IN AUGUST, 1991, A LAKE SURVEY WAS CONDUCTED ON LEWIS LAKE.  THIS LAKE IS CLASSIFIED AS A CEN LAKE AND MANAGED AS A CEN-LMB LAKE.  PRESENT STOCKING PLANS INVOLVE WAE FINGERLING STOCKING ONCE EVERY THREE YEARS.  TO DETERMINE THE STATUS OF THE FISH POPULATIONS, SIX GILLNETS AND FOUR TRAPNETS WERE SET AND TWO SHORELINE STATIONS WERE SEINED.  BASED ON RESULTS OF THESE EFFORTS THE STATUS OF THE FISH POPULATIONS COMPARED TO PREVIOUS SURVEYS AND TO LAKES OF THE SAME CLASSIFICATION STATEWIDE ARE DESCRIBED.  THE NOP NET CATCH (2.17/SET) SHOWED A REAL INCREASE FROM THE PREVIOUS SURVEY CATCH (1.17/SET) BUT STILL FALLS BELOW THE FIRST QUARTILE (4.33/SET).  HISTORICALLY, NOP POPULATIONS HAVE ALWAYS BEEN LOW IN LEWIS LAKE. THE NOP CAPTURED RANGED FROM 21.0 TO 34.9 INCHES WITH A MEDIAN LENGTH GROUP OF 25.0-25.9 INCHES. THE MEAN WEIGHT WAS 4.15 POUNDS WHICH IS ABOVE THE THIRD QUARTILE (2.53 POUNDS) FOR NOP OF THIS LAKE TYPE.  AGE ANALYSIS DETERMINED THAT CAPTURED FISH WERE FROM TWO TO SEVEN YEARS OLD.  AVERAGE BACK- CALCULATED LENGTHS FOR EACH AGE CLASS WERE TYPICAL OF NORMAL GROWTH RATES THROUGHOUT THE STATE.  WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE 1985 YEAR-CLASS (STOCKING YEAR), THE REMAINING FIVE AGE CLASSES REPRESENTED NATURAL REPRODUCTION.  THE WAE NET CATCH (0.83/ SET)INCREASED FROM THE PREVIOUS SURVEY WHERE NO WAES WERE CAPTURED.  THE STATEWIDE MEDIAN CATCH FOR THIS LAKE TYPE IS 1.50/SET.  ONLY ONE OTHER SURVEY, 1981, HAD A WAE GILLNET CATCH (1.33/SET) PRIOR TO THIS SURVEY.  THE 1991 WAES CAPTURED RANGED FROM 10.5 TO 22.9 INCHES WITH MEDIAN LENGTH GROUP OF 19.0-19.9 INCHES.  THE MEAN WEIGHT WAS 2.04 POUNDS WHICH IS SIMILAR TO THE STATEWIDE MEDIAN WEIGHT (2.40 POUNDS) FOR WAES OF THIS LAKE TYPE.  AGE ANALYSIS DETERMINED THAT CAPTURED FISH WERE TWO AND FIVE YEARS OLD.  THESE FISH WERE FROM THE 1986 AND 1989 STOCKING YEARS.  AVERAGE BACK- CALCULATED LENGTHS FOR EACH AGE CLASS WERE TYPICAL OF NORMAL GROWTH RATES THROUGHOUT THE STATE.  THE BLG NET CATCH (29.25/SET) WAS SLIGHTLY LOWER THAN THE PREVIOUS SURVEY NET CATCH (31.00/SET) BUT WAS HIGHER THAN THE STATEWIDE MEDIAN CATCH (23.50/ SET).  THE BLGS RANGED FROM 3.5 TO 7.4 INCHES WITH A MEDIAN LENGTH GROUP OF 5.5-5.9 INCHES.  THE MEAN WEIGHT WAS 0.14 POUNDS WHICH FALLS WITHIN THE NORMAL WEIGHT RANGE OF BLGS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. AGE ANALYSIS DETERMINED THAT CAPTURED FISH WERE FROM ONE TO SEVEN YEARS OLD.  AVERAGE BACK- CALCULATED LENGTHS FOR EACH AGE CLASS INDICATED THAT BLGS IN LEWIS LAKE HAVE SLOW GROWTH RATES. SHORELINE SEINING CAPTURED 27 YOUNG-OF-YEAR BLGS. ONLY ONE LMB WAS CAPTURED IN THE GILLNET SETS (0.17/SET).  NONE WERE TAKEN IN THE TRAPNET SETS. THE CATCH (0.17/SET) WAS BELOW THE FIRST QUARTILE (0.40/SET).  THE LENGTH WAS 8.3 INCHES AND THE WEIGHT WAS 0.2 POUNDS.  THE FISH WAS TWO YEARS OLD.  SHORELINE SEINING CAPTURED 21 YOY AND 5 JUVENILE LMB.  THE BLC NET CATCH (1.50/SET) WAS HIGHER THAN THE PREVIOUS SURVEY CATCH (0.50/SET) AND SIMILAR TO THE STATEWIDE MEDIAN CATCH (1.58/ SET).  THE FISH RANGED FROM 7.0 TO 7.9 INCHES. THE MEAN WEIGHT WAS 0.17 POUNDS WHICH IS BELOW THE FIRST QUARTILE (0.20 POUNDS) WEIGHT FOR BLC OF THIS LAKE TYPE.  AGE ANALYSIS DETERMINED THAT CAPTURED FISH WERE FROM TWO TO SIX YEARS OLD. AVERAGE BACK-CALCULATED LENGTHS FOR EACH AGE CLASS INDICATED THAT BLC IN LEWIS LAKE HAVE SLOW GROWTH RATES.  SHORELINE SEINING FAILED TO CAPTURE ANY BLCS.  THE YEP NET CATCH (3.67/SET) WAS THE SAME CATCH AS THE PREVIOUS SURVEY (6.67/SET) AND REMAINED BELOW THE STATEWIDE MEDIAN CATCH (9.60/ SET).  HISTORICAL YEP NET CATCHES IN LEWIS LAKE HAVE ALWAYS BEEN BELOW THE MEDIAN CATCH (EXCEPT IN 1981, 10.33/SET) BUT NEVER BELOW THE FIRST QUARTILE.  THE FISH RANGED FROM 5.5 TO 9.4 INCHES WITH A MEDIAN LENGTH GROUP OF 7.0-7.4 INCHES. SHORELINE SEINING FAILED TO CAPTURE YOY YEP.  SIX OTHER SPECIES WERE CAPTURED DURING THE SURVEY WTS, BLB, YEB, HSF, GSF, AND PMK).  NET CATCHES FOR FIVE OF THE SIX SPECIES FELL WITHIN THEIR RESPECTIVE QUARTILE RANGES.  THE GSF NET CATCH (0.25/SET) WAS BELOW THE FIRST QUARTILE (0.40/SET).</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lewis lake is a 220 acre basin managed primarily for walleye and northern pike.  Minnesota lakes managed for fishing are grouped into lake classes based on physical, chemical, and biological similarities.  Lewis lake is assigned to lake class 29.  In order to compare the present fish population to others in the lake class and to evaluate management goals, Lewis lake was surveyed during the summer of 2001.The lake's management plan calls for walleye fingerling stocking (148 pounds) on alternate years.  Long range management goals are to sustain a moderate walleye population with a target catch rate of 2.5 per gillnet.  The long range goal for northern pike is more trophy oriented with a target weight of 4 pounds.  Factors limiting the fishery include a low yellow perch forage base and limited spawning habitat for walleye and northern pike.With the exception of yellow perch all gamefish were sampled at normal levels when compared to other class 29 lakes.  The yellow perch gillnet catch was low compared to other lakes.  The previous netting from 1996 also recorded a low perch abundance.The walleye gillnet catch, 1.5/set, was identical to the 1996 catch but below the management goal.  Sampled walleye ranged in length from 15.5 to 22.8 inches with a 19.5 inch and 2.5 pound mean.  Walleye averaged less than a pound in 1996.  Otolith and scale aging assigned the sampled walleye to the 1992, and the 1995 through 1998 year classes.  All five year classes could be  associated to a fall stocking.  Walleye growth was similar to the statewide norm.Northern pike were sampled at a rate of 10.5 per gillnet.  The lake historically has had a low northern population dominated by large fish.  While the catch did'nt meet the  management goal for size, the number caught was a record high for Lewis Lake.  Captured northerns ranged from 15.4 to 30.4 inches with a 2 pound average.  Scale aging indicated that the 1997 and 1998 year classes (3 and 4 year old fish) accounted for 83% of the catch.  Northern growth was normal compared to the statewide growth rate.  Black crappie were present at normal levels in both the gillnets and trapnets.  The combined catch averaged 8.7 inches and 0.4 pounds.  Sampled crappie were smaller in 1996 but more numerous in the gillnets.  Scale samples indicated that the 1997 year class represented nearly half the catch.  These four year old fish averaged 9.4 inches and should provide angling opportunity for at least a few more years.The trapnet catch rate for bluegill was 16.3 per set, a fair increase since 1996.  Bluegill were small however with only 3 of 147 fish greater than 7 inches.  Two year old fish accounted for 60% of the catch explaining their lack of size.Largemouth bass were sampled  at a rate of 45.8 per hour during night electrofishing.  Lengths ranged from 3.4 to 18.6 inches with an 11.9 inch and 1.1 pound average.  The 1996 catch was very similar in size and abundance.  The 1997 year class dominated the catch.  These 3 year old fish averaged 10.1 inches and should provide angling for several more years.  Shoreline seining on August 24 captured young of the year bluegill, largemouth bass, and yellow perch indicating that reproduction was successful.  Mean lengths were 1.3, 2.2, and 2.5 inches respectively.The 2001 catch indicated that northern pike and walleye are both below management goals.  Other species sampled during the survey included bowfin (dogfish), black, brown, and yellow bullheads, green, hybrid, and pumpkinseed sunfishes, and white sucker.</p>",

Mostly muck and silt substrates are found along the undeveloped shoreline which is predominantly fringed by bog.  This largemouth bass-panfish lake is managed primarily for walleye, largemouth bass, northern pike, and panfish.  The maximum depth is 48 feet found in the north half of the lake.  During most summers, the lake is subject to moderate algal blooms and thermal stratification making dissolved oxygen concentrations very low in depths of  20 feet and below.  Summertime water clarity ranges from 4 to 12 feet from the surface.  Past survey records have not documented winterkill or summerkill that affected the fish population.  Lake water levels fluctuate around two feet annually.  During the 1988-89 drought, the lake was three feet below the current normal level.  A dam was maintained in the outlet, during logging in the early 1900's, which kept the lake some four feet higher than current normal levels.  It was gone by the time of the initial lake survey in 1947.  Various stocking has occurred through the years.  Present management plans call for walleye fingerlings stocked on a 3-year rotation.During August 19-22, 1996, a population assessment was conducted to evaluate the present fish population in Lewis Lake.  Gear types consisted of: six standard gillnets and eight standard trapnets, night electrofishing for largemouth bass on June 6, 1996, and standard seining natural reproduction checks on August 30, 1996.  Lewis Lake is in lake class 29 and fish abundances are based on the mean ranges observed in other lake class 29 lakes.Walleye abundance was normal for this type of lake, however, Lewis Lake is not the kind of lake which normally sustains its own walleye population.  Stocking fingerling walleye is what maintains their abundance in the lake.  They were first introduced in 1978 with the thought of having a low but consistent level of walleye in the lake.  Although gravel/rock spawning habitat for walleye is limited, natural reproduction can at times provide additional walleye to the population.  The walleye sampled ranged from 9.9 to 20.6 inches with an average of 13.4 inches.  The average weight was 0.9 pounds.Historical northern pike abundance in Lewis Lake has been low but their average sizes were large.  Stocking was tried at various times in the past with no significant success except perhaps once.  This survey detected a strong year-class of pike from 1993, which happened to be a stocking year.  Northern pike sampled in 1996 ranged from 17.8 to 28.4 inches with an average of 22.5 inches.  The average weight was 2.7 pounds.  Sixty-seven percent of the catch were 3-year-olds from the 1993 year-class.  Growth occurred at normal rates.  Whether these fish were stocked, natural, or of combined origin, it would not immediately suggest that stocking is the answer for maintaining northern pike in this lake.  Standing cattail, bulrush, and other plant beds along the shore make for excellent northern pike spawning habitat and that type of habitat is very crucial to protect.  Removal of the natural plants would no doubt reduce the fish production in the lake.  A fair amount of this year's northern pike hatchlings were sampled by shoreline seining.Night electrofishing is a technique used to sample largemouth bass.   This method momentarily stuns the fish so they can be dipped into the boat for measurements.  The sample of bass (41.6 bass/hr) ranged in length from 5.4 to 17.1 inches, averaging 11.8 inches.  Ages one through seven were sampled indicating good natural reproduction and exhibiting normal growth.  This was the first time Lewis Lake was electrofished by the DNR, and this will also continue on a 5-year rotation.  Seining sampled some of this year's bass which averaged 2.36 inches on August 30, 1996.The 1996 sampling found bluegill abundance normal for this lake type, which was typical of catches in past surveys.  This year's catch sampled bluegill from 2.8 to 7.6 inches with the average being 4.7 inches.  Seining recorded bluegill young-of-year averaging 1.00 inches on August 30th.Two methods, gillnets and trapnets measured black crappie abundance.  Crappie catches were high in gillnets and normal in trapnets.  Their abundance has varied little through the survey years with abundance being mostly normal.  The 1996 catch sampled crappie ranging from 4.6 to 12.4 inches with the average being 7.4 inches.  The average weight was 0.35 pounds.  Seining sampled no crappie from this year's hatch.Yellow perch abundance was low for this lake type.  They were present at normal abundance levels in the five previous surveys but have since dipped below normal.  Considering that Lewis Lake has a fair population of walleye and northern pike, it is likely that their predation keeps the perch numbers near low levels.  All gear types in 1996 sampled 11 adult perch averaging around 6.0 inches.  Seining did not sample any of this year's hatch.Only one common carp was sampled during the survey.  This was similar to catches in the past.  Judging by the number of years carp have been in the system, they have apparently not caused major shifts in game fish abundance nor have they exploded to excessive levels.Ten other species were represented in the netting gear: black bullhead, brown bullhead, yellow bullhead,  green sunfish, pumpkinseed, white sucker, golden shiner, blacknose shiner, brook silverside, and banded killifish.  The bullhead species, white sucker, pumpkinseed, and green sunfish were at low levels while the remaining species were sampled at normal abundance levels for this lake type.Prepared by:  Jack Lauer, Area Fisheries Specialist</p>",
