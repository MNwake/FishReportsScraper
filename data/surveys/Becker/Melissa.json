                "narrative": "<p>Lake Melissa's fish populations are similar to those of many central Minnesota lakes.  Walleye, Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, Bluegill, and Black Crappie are all typical angling targets here.  Although none were caught during test netting, a small number of Muskellunge are known to be present in the lake.  These are undoubtedly immigrants from upstream Detroit Lake, which is regularly stocked with muskies.  The presence of a Tullibee (Cisco) population and a shift from Black to Yellow Bullheads indicate relatively good water quality in the lake.  Zebra mussels were discovered in the lake in the summer of 2014 and people recreating on the lake are encouraged to clean, drain, and dry their equipment to prevent the spread of these mussels to other waters. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye fry and fingerlings continue to be stocked in Lake Melissa.  Test net catches of Walleye have remained relatively consistent within a range of 3.4 to 9.5 Walleyes per gill net.  In 2014, the Walleye gill net catch rate was a new historic high of 9.5 per net.  The Walleyes averaged about 1.1 pounds each and 14.5 inches long. <br> \n <br> \nSampled Northern Pike were relatively large at an average size of 23.2 inches and 3.1 pounds.  Pike greater than 24 inches in length have been protected from harvest by an experimental regulation since 1996.  In 2011, the regulation was slightly modified in order to allow the harvest of one pike over 36 inches.  The regulation's goals were to improve the size structure of the population and to reduce the number of small pike.  Eighteen years after the beginning of this regulation, these expectations are generally being met.  The number of pike over 24 inches averaged 6.4 per test net in 2014.  In six studies before the regulation started, the average number of pike over 24 inches was 1.8 per net and the number never exceeded 2.7 per net.  Also, the average length of sampled pike in studies conducted before the regulation was 21.0 inches while the average length of pike sampled since 2000 is 24.0 inches.  In addition, the portion of small pike in the catch since 2000 has averaged 53% while prior to the regulation, pike less than 24 inches averaged 77% of the sample. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie abundance was up from previous surveys, with average length being 9 inches.  Historic records show that Lake Melissa has the potential to produce large (over eight inches) Bluegills.  Sunfish of that size have become extremely rare in this lake over the past couple of decades where they were once common.  In 2014, just three percent of trap-net-sampled Bluegills were larger than eight inches in length.  In contrast, over one-fourth of sampled Bluegills were longer than eight inches in 1968 and nearly one-tenth were over eight inches in 1982.  As in many Minnesota lakes, it appears that Bluegills are harvested as soon as they reach sizes that are acceptable to anglers (usually about seven inches), preventing the continued growth of larger Bluegills.  Restrictive harvest regulations are a potential solution to the small Bluegill problem and may be considered, but public input, acceptance, and cooperation would be important parts of any successful regulation.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Melissa is a 1831 acre lake in southeastern Becker County.  It lies just downstream from Lake Sallie on the Pelican River chain of lakes.  It is a heavily developed and popular fishing lake with 375 homes or cabins and six resorts surrounding the lake.  Some Lake Melissa walleyes make their way downstream and across Lake Sallie to spawn at the Lake Sallie inlet in the spring.  The DNR operates a walleye egg collection and hatchery operation at this site and so Lake Melissa is annually stocked with walleye to return a portion of the hatch to the brood stock lake.  A liberalized northern pike regulation (limit of six with no more than three over 24 inches) was in effect on Lake Melissa from 1986 to 1996.  It was hoped the liberalized limit would encourage the harvest of small northern pike and result in diminished numbers but increased size structure.  The regulation was found to have no impact on altering northern pike size structure.  Another experimental regulation (all northern pike over 24 inches in length must be released) was initiated in 1996.  It will remain in place for ten years or until 2006, when a final determination will be made as to its effectiveness.  It was designed with the intent of improving the size structure of the northern pike fishery, which is something the history of Lake Melissa indicates is possible.The fish community of Lake Melissa is varied and offers something for everyone.  Northern pike, walleye, largemouth bass, and bluegill abundances are all above average for a lake of this ecological type.  The experimental northern pike regulation has helped boost the average size to a point where some exciting catch and release northern pike fishing can be experienced.  The walleye population has a good number of \"keeper\" size fish.  The panfisherman will enjoy the abundance of bluegills.  Black crappie and large yellow bullheads are also available.  Lake Melissa just seems to be one of those lakes that is full of fish, whether it is northern pike, walleye, bass, or bluegill.  It is one of those lakes that people like to fish because it seems as though there is always some \"action\".  It appears like the experimental northern pike regulation is on its way to creating a northern pike fishery with an improved size structure.  That will add another dimension to an already attractive fishery.Because Lake Melissa is so heavily developed, it is imperative that lakeshore residents implement and adhere to shoreland best management practices in order to protect water quality.  These might include: (1) leaving or establishing buffer strips of natural vegetation along the shores, (2) leaving aquatic vegetation stands intact, especially bulrush and cattail beds, (3) not fertilizing lawns or using phosphorus free fertilizers, (4) ensuring compliance of septic systems, (5) stabilizing eroding banks, and (6) utilizing practices illustrated in the DNR document \"Lakescaping for Wildlife and Water Quality\" when landscaping shoreline property.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Melissa is a 1,850-acre lake with a high level of fishing pressure and considerable shoreline development.  The lake supports a diverse and abundant fishery including Walleye, Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, Bluegill, and Black Crappie.  Juvenile Walleye are stocked into Lake Melissa annually and adults play a role in spring egg take operations on Lake Sallie.  Zebra Mussels were discovered in the lake in 2014, prompting action by anglers to clean, drain, and dry equipment to stop further spread of the mussels into non-infested waters.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike remain abundant in Lake Melissa, averaging 22 inches in length.  Pike have been managed utilizing several special regulations dating back to 1986, with the intent to reduce the number of smaller pike and enhance size.  Survey catch rates of pike over 24 inches have increased over the past several decades, suggesting improvements in size structure.  However, 71% of sampled pike were less than 24 inches in 2019 indicating consistently high numbers of moderately sized fish.  Pike caught in 2019 were most abundant between the lengths of 19 to 23 inches.  Walleye catch rate remains stable in Lake Melissa, with the average Walleye caught measuring about 16 inches in length.  Catch rates of Yellow Perch have declined considerably in the lake, which is not unexpected given the high density of predator species present.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie numbers were up from the 2014 survey, with the average crappie caught measuring 10 inches.  Historic survey records show that Lake Melissa has the potential to produce large Bluegills (over eight inches), however sunfish of that size have become rare in the lake over the past several decades.  Bluegills sampled in 2019 ranged in size from 3 to 8.5 inches and averaged about 6 inches in length.  This trend toward more abundant, smaller panfish has been observed in many lakes across the state.  The shift has prompted discussions by agency staff with stakeholders about revised harvest regulations to enhance quality sized Bluegills in select Minnesota lakes.   <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species observed in the 2019 survey included bullheads, White Sucker, Cisco, and Largemouth Bass.  Bass had an average length of 13.2 inches, but fish up to 18.5 inches were captured.  Anglers are encouraged to practice selective harvest while fishing on Lake Melissa in order to maintain quality fishing opportunities for the future.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>As in most Minnesota lakes, fish populations in Lake Melissa are constantly changing.  Fish community     fluctuations have been magnified by several factors including (1) weather patterns and water levels affecting     natural spawning habitat, (2) better water quality due to upstream improvements to the Detroit Lakes sewage     treatment facility, (3) annual walleye stocking and egg take operations, (4) increased fishing pressure, and (5)     improved fish harvest methods.  Many anglers recognize that black crappie and northern pike numbers are down     significantly from levels during the eighties.  However, it is also clear that walleye, tullibee, and bluegill     populations are more abundant than during the same period.      Both walleye and tullibee (cisco) net catches are near the high end of the \"normal\" range for similar lakes     while crappie catches have decreased to the bottom end of that range.  While all of the factors mentioned above     have probably affected those populations, water quality improvements may have had the most widespread effect.      It is well known, for instance, that tullibee require water that is cool and well-oxygenated.  Turbid, polluted,     or extremely fertile lakes simply will not meet the life requirements during mid-summer or late winter.      Conversely, black crappie may be favored over several other species by turbid, though not polluted, water     conditions.      It has been documented in several Minnesota lakes that when yellow perch populations decrease, bluegill     populations increase, possibly due to a lack of predation by perch upon young bluegill.  When northern pike     populations increased dramatically during the eighties, they had a marked effect upon yellow perch.  When yellow     perch numbers crashed, bluegill numbers began expanding rapidly.  Even though northern pike and yellow perch     numbers have returned to near normal levels, the bluegill explosion has not yet stopped.  Consequently, bluegills     tend to be abundant but small in Lake Melissa.  Bluegills have never been considered \"fast-growing\" in Melissa,     but, the average length of those sampled in 1949 was nearly eight inches.  Currently, the mean length of bluegills     is less than six inches.  This tells us that fewer bluegills were harvested in 1949 than at present, whether     because of fewer anglers, less successful angling methods, or angler preferences is unclear.  Slow-growing     bluegill are now caught as soon as they reach \"keeper\" size, resulting in the presence of many small fish.      Largemouth bass abundance is considered average in Lake Melissa when compared to similar lakes.  Largemouth     bass are efficient sunfish predators and their habitat should be protected to maintain an adequate population.      Extensive bulrush stands that reportedly lined much of the shoal water at the turn of the century have all but     been destroyed.  Only two small stands remain, both in shoreline areas that were difficult to \"develop.\"  Since     bulrushes are valuable not only for fish habitat (spawning, rearing, feeding, and cover), but also for erosion     protection, water quality improvement, and waterfowl habitat, remaining stands in Lake Melissa deserve utmost     protection. Another vegetation species of concern is the non-native flowering rush, which has now migrated downstream     from Detroit Lake into both Lakes Sallie and Melissa.  Cooperative efforts between the Pelican River Watershed     District and the DNR's Ecological Services Section to control flowering rush are underway.  Flowering rush has     been a nuisance in certain areas.  There are no documented impacts of flowering rush on fish communities.      However, if bulrushes or other beneficial plants are displaced by this non-native species, there is potential for     detrimental impacts on fish.  The tendency for flowering rush, as well as other exotics, is to move into disturbed     areas where native vegetation has already been removed rather than to invade healthy stands of native plants.      In summary, fish populations in Lake Melissa, and most other lakes, are in a constant state of change and     are affected by many factors.  Upstream land and water management practices, shoreline alterations, riparian land     use, vegetation removal, weather patterns, fish stocking, fish removal, fishing pressure and other factors act     together to impact the fish community in the lake.  During the past decade, Lake Melissa's fishery has shifted     away from northern pike and black crappie towards walleye, cisco, and bluegill.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Melissa's fish populations are similar to those of many central Minnesota lakes.  Walleye, northern pike, largemouth bass, bluegill, and black crappie are all typical angling targets here.  The presence of a tullibee (cisco) population and a shift from black to yellow bullheads indicate relatively good water quality in the lake. <br> \n <br> \nA walleye spawn-taking operation is in place on Lake Sallie that also uses migrating fish from Lake Melissa and, as a parent lake, walleye fry and fingerlings continue to be stocked annually here.  Test net catches of walleye have remained relatively consistent within a range of 3.4 to 9.2 walleyes per net.  In 2009, the walleye gill net catch rate was 3.8 per net, which was near the historic low.  The walleyes averaged about 1.8 pounds each. <br> \n <br> \nSampled northern pike were also relatively large at an average 26.1 inches and 3.8 pounds.  Pike greater than 24 inches in length have been protected from harvest by an experimental regulation since 1996.  This regulation's goals were to improve the size structure of the population and to reduce the number of small pike.  Thirteen years after the beginning of this regulation, these expectations are being met.  The number of pike over 24 inches averaged 5.5 per test net in 2009.  In six studies before the regulation started, the average number of pike over 24 inches was 1.8 per net and the number never exceeded 2.7 per net.  Also, the average length of sampled pike in studies conducted before the regulation was 21.0 inches while the average length of pike sampled in 2009 was 26.1 inches.  In addition, the overall northern pike catch rate was more typical (lower) than in the recent past and the portion of small pike in the catch has never been as low as it was in 2009, when just 30% of northern pike sampled were less than 24 inches long.  Before the regulation, pike less than 24 inches averaged 77% of the sample. <br> \n <br> \nA decision must be made in 2010 whether to continue, modify, or drop the experimental northern pike regulation.  Public input will be an important part of this process and is invited through letters, phone calls, visits, or the public hearings that will be conducted during late summer.  The regulation appears to have been effective at providing larger pike and reducing percentages of smaller pike.  Dropping the regulation outright would likely lead to rapid harvest of the currently protected size pike and a quick return to large numbers of small pike typical of most area lakes.  Anglers must decide whether the ability to catch larger pike and maintain a more balanced fishery is worth the sacrifice inherent in any harvest regulation. <br> \n <br> \nHistoric records show that Lake Melissa has the potential to produce large (over eight inches) bluegills.  Sunfish of that size have become extremely rare in this lake over the past couple of decades where they were once common.  As in many Minnesota lakes, it appears that bluegills are harvested as soon as they reach sizes that are acceptable to anglers (usually about seven inches), preventing the continued growth of larger bluegills.  Restrictive harvest regulations are a potential solution to the small bluegill problem and may be considered.  Public input, acceptance, and cooperation would be important parts of any successful regulation.</p>",

Several consecutive age groups of northern pike are well-represented and growth is good.  Bluegills are abundant (over 4 times area median) and slow growing (less than 80% of statewide avg. lengths).  Walleye population is composed mainly of age groups II, III and IV.  Growth is good, abundance is slightly above local average and relatively stable.  Additionally, the bulk of walleyes caught at the Lake Sallie spawntaking site are migrants from Lake Melissa.  Tullibees were caught in numbers greater than any previous survey (about 3 times area median).</p>",

The Pelican River is the major inlet and outlet, and a smaller inlet from Lind Lake is also present.Shoal water soils consist of about 80% sand, 12% gravel and 8% rubble.Submerged aquatic vegetation was abundant at the time of the survey.  Emergent aquatic vegetation was limited to a small area along the southwest shore.A secchi disk reading of 6.0 feet at the time of the survey indicated moderate turbidity.  This turbidity was caused primarily by an algal bloom.As compared with statewide figures the test net catches of northern pike, walleye, yellow perch, bullheads and sunfish were above average.  The catches of common suckers, dogfish, largemouth bass and rock bass were near average and the catches of tullibee and black crappies were below average.Spawning conditions for the gamefish species present were rated fair to good.Reports from local anglers indicate that Lake Melissa is a good all-around fishing lake with panfish angling especially good.  Both summer and winter angling pressure is moderate.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Melissa's fish populations are similar to those of many central Minnesota lakes.  Walleye, northern pike, largemouth bass, bluegill, and black crappie are all typical angling targets here.  A tullibee (cisco) population and a shift from black to yellow bullheads indicate relatively good water quality in the lake.A walleye spawn taking operation is in place on Lake Sallie that uses fish from Lake Melissa and walleye fry and fingerlings have been stocked annually on this lake.  Test net catches of walleye have remained relatively consistent within a range of 3.4 to 9.2 walleyes per net.  In 2004, the walleye gill net catch rate was 5.7 per net.  The walleyes averaged about 1.8 pounds each.Sampled northern pike were also relatively large at an average 24.2 inches and 3.1 pounds.  Pike greater than 24 inches in length have been protected from harvest by an experimental regulation since 1996.  This regulation's goals were to improve the size structure of the population and to reduce the number of small pike.  Eight years after the beginning of this regulation, these expectations have been partially met.  The number of pike over 24 inches averaged 7.2 per test net in 2004.  In six studies before the regulation started, the average number of pike over 24 inches was 1.8 per net and the number never exceeded 2.7 per net.  Also, the average length of sampled pike in studies conducted before the regulation was 21.0 inches while the average length of pike sampled in 2004 was 24.2 inches.  Although the numbers of pike less than 24 inches remain high because the total pike population is currently high, the portion of small pike in the catch has never been as low as it was in 2004, when 57% of northern pike sampled were less than 24 inches long.  Before the regulation, pike less than 24 inches averaged 77% of the sample.A decision must be made during the coming year whether to continue, modify, or drop the experimental northern pike regulation.  Public input will be an important part of theis process and is invited through letters, phone calls, visits, or the public hearings that will be conducted during late summer, 2005.  The regulation appears to have been effective at providing larger pike and reducing percentages of smaller pike.  Dropping the regulation outright would likely lead to rapid harvest of the currently protected size pike and a quick return to large numbers of small pike typical of most area lakes.  Anglers must decide whether the ability to catch large pike and maintain a healthy fish community is worth the trade-off of harvesting only fish less than 24 inches.Historic records show that Lake Melissa has the potential to produce large (over eight inches) bluegills.  Sunfish of that size have become extremely rare in this lake over the past couple of decades where they were once common.  As in many Minnesota lakes, it appears that bluegills are harvested as soon as they reach sizes that are acceptable to anglers (usually about seven inches), preventing the continued growth of larger bluegills.  Restrictive harvest regulations are a potential solution to the small bluegill problem that may be considered.  Public input would be an important part of any regulation proposed.</p>",
