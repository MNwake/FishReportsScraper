THE MAY 1990 TRAPNET SAMPLE OF BLG EXHIBITED HIGHER PSD AND RSD VALUES THAN THE AUGUST 1990 SAMPLE, SUGGESTING THAT LARGE BLGS WERE MORE VULNERABLE TO CAPTURE WHEN INSHORE WATERS WERE COOLER.  THE LMB SAMPLE EXHIBITED A GOOD LENGTH FREQUENCY.  THEIR GROWTH RATE IS GOOD. A LARGE NUMBER OF BLC WERE SAMPLED, SUGGESTING AN ABUNDANT POPULATION.  THE SAMPLE RANGED IN LENGTH FROM 6 TO 13 INCHES.

                "narrative": "<p> <br> \nMoccasin Lake (DOW# 11-0296; Lake Class 32) is a 272 acre lake located near Longville, MN. A US Forest Service owned public access is located on the east shore. Moccasin Lake has 6.12 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 95 feet. The lake is primarily managed for Northern Pike and Largemouth Bass and secondarily for Black Crappie, Bluegill, Yellow Perch, and White Sucker. The DNR has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different classes based on physical, chemical and other characteristics. Island Lake is in Lake Class 23; lakes in this class are generally very clear, deep, have a low percentage of shallow water area, and have very irregularly shaped shoreline with many bays or points.   <br> \n <br> \nIn 2015 a targeted survey for Black Crappie, Bluegill, and Largemouth Bass was conducted using spring trap netting and night electrofishing. Black Crappie abundance in Moccasin Lake was similar to past surveys. The majority of Black Crappie sampled were 8-14 inches long with many around 10 inches. Bluegill abundance was also similar to past surveys with the majority of fish 6-9 inches long. Largemouth Bass abundance was similar to past surveys and about 20% of fish sampled were longer than 15 inches. <br> \n <br> \nPeople can have significant impacts on lakes and the fish populations they support. Harvest, lakeshore development, removal of shoreline vegetation, and introductions of invasive species can all adversely affect fish populations. Currently no aquatic invasive species (AIS) have been identified in Moccasin Lake. AIS are moved from infested to non-infested waters by anglers, boaters, and lake shore owners and can adversely impact lakes and fish populations. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access. If you suspect an infestation of an invasive species in this lake, save a specimen and report it to a local natural resource office. Additional information on all of these topics can be found on the DNR website (www.dnr.state.mn.us) or by contacting the Walker Area Fisheries office. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Moccasin Lake is 243-acre lake located near Hackensack, Minnesota that has 5.45 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 95 feet.  There is a US Forest Service owned concrete boat ramp on the east shore.  The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MNDNR) has classified Minnesota lakes into 43 different classes based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics.  Moccasin Lake is in Lake Class 32; lakes in the class are generally large and irregularly shaped lakes with high percentage of waters 15 feet and shallower.  The lake is primarily managed for largemouth bass and northern pike and secondarily for bluegill, black crappie, and yellow perch.  Largemouth bass are abundant in Moccasin Lake.  The mean length for the largemouth bass sampled by electrofishing was 14 inches and fish up to 19 inches were sampled.  Currently, there is a catch-and-release only regulation for largemouth bass, which has been in effect since 1996.  Since the catch-and-release regulation was implemented, the size structure has shifted to more larger fish.  Northern pike are abundant in Moccasin Lake.  The mean length was 19 inches, and fish up to 36 inches were captured.  Other fish species that available for anglers to catch are black crappie, bluegill, pumpkinseed sunfish, yellow bullhead, and yellow perch.Anglers can help maintain or improve the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for table fare, but encourages release of medium- to large-sized fish.  Releasing these fish can help maintain balance in the fish community in Moccasin Lake and provide anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future.  Shoreline areas on the land and into the shallow water provide essential habitat for fish and wildlife that live in or near Minnesota's lakes.  Overdeveloped shorelines can't support the fish, wildlife, and clean water that are associated with natural undeveloped lakes. The combined effects of all lakeshore owners \"fixing up\" their property can destroy a lake's valuable natural shorelines.Shoreline habitat consists of aquatic plants, woody plants and natural lake bottom soils.  Plants in the water and at the water's edge provide habitat, prevent erosion and absorb excess nutrients. Shrubs, trees, and woody debris such as fallen trees or limbs provide good habitat both above and below the water and should be left in place.  Natural lake bottom materials like silt or gravel are more ecologically productive than pure sand trucked in for a swimming beach.  A tidy lawn and a sandy beach make great spots for sunbathing and swimming but do little to provide habitat for fish and wildlife. By leaving a buffer strip of natural vegetation along the shoreline, property owners can reduce erosion, help maintain water quality, and provide habitat and travel corridors for wildlife.Only if more lakeshore owners manage their shoreline in a natural condition can fish and wildlife populations on Minnesota lakes remain healthy and abundant.  More specific information on protecting or restoring shorelines and watersheds is available through the local MNDNR Fisheries office.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Moccasin Lake is located northeast of Hackensack, Minnesota on the Woodtick Trail.  The lake has a surface area of 243 acres and a maximum depth of 95 feet. The access on the east shore of the lake is owned by the U.S. Forest Service.  Primary management species for Moccasin Lake are largemouth bass (LMB) and northern pike (NOP).  Secondary management species are bluegill (BLG) and black crappie (BLC).Based on physical, chemical and other characteristics, the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types. Moccasin Lake is in lake class 32.  Other area lakes in this classification are: Barnum (11-281), Cooper (11-163), Island (11-257), Kego (11-182), Larson (11-374), Lizard (11-270), Long (11-258), Long (11-454), Shurd (11-165), and Stevens (11-116) Lakes.As part of the statewide experimental regulations project, a catch and release only regulation for LMB will go into effect on Moccasin Lake in the spring of 1996, and remain until spring 2003.  The specific objective of the regulation is to increase the percent of stock size LMB 15 inches or greater from less than 10 percent in electrofishing samples to 25 percent or greater.Spring electrofishing was conducted to assess the largemouth bass population in 1995, 1994, 1993, and 1992.  This population monitoring will continue in future years  to evaluate effects of the catch and release regulation.  In 1995, 125 largemouth bass were sampled that ranged in length from 8 to 20 inches.  This catch rate was similar to 1994 and much higher than the 1993 and 1992 catch rates.  The size structure of the largemouth bass population has changed little since 1992.  Growth was slow compared to similar lakes in this area.   The implementation of the experimental catch and release regulation should alter this size structure over the next six years.The northern pike  catch rate was19.3/net and the highest of any survey.  Sampled northern pike ranged in length from 8 to 36 inches.    Growth rates were average compared to area class 32 lakes.  As a result of excellent natural reproduction and subsequent strong 1992 and 1993 year classes, the population is currently dominated by small fish.  Strong 1992 and 1993 northern pike year classes occurred throughout this.Twenty-two black crappie were sampled by electrofishing in spring of 1995 (31.9/hour). This catch rate is higher than catch rates in previous years.  Sampled black crappie ranged in length from 8 to 13 inches and growth was similar to area class 32 lakes.   BLC were stocked into Moccasin Lake in 1970 and a successful fishery has been established.  The 1995 test net catch rates were much lower than the 1990 survey, but still within interquartile ranges for area class 32 lakes.    The bluegill catch rates were higher than those typically found in area class 32 lakes.  Sampled bluegill ranged in size from 3 to 8 inches. Fifty percent of the sample was less than 5.4 inches.    Growth was exceptionally slow compared to area class 32 lakes.  The high catch rate and slow growth indicate bluegill may be becoming overpopulated in Moccasin Lake.  The strong 1992 and 1993 year classes of NOP and the LMB catch and release regulation should provide increased numbers of large predators in future years and may reduce BLG density.Other species sampled in 1995 were: yellow bullhead, pumpkinseed, and yellow perch.  Species sampled in previous surveys but not encountered in 1995 were: rock bass ( 90), hybrid sunfish ( 90, 63), walleye ( 83), white sucker ( 63).Muskellunge were stocked in Moccasin Lake in 1969 and 1970, but have not been sampled since 1975, when they were last targeted for spawn take.  Records are unclear  whether spawn takes were attempted post 1975.  One lakeshore resident reported in 1992 he had caught about eight muskellunge in the few years prior to 1992.  To help maintain quality fish populations in Moccasin Lake, lake users should safeguard aquatic habitats by preserving or reestablishing aquatic plants and natural shorelines.  Aquatic and terrestrial plants provide food and cover for fish and wildlife.  They also help protect shorelines from erosion, and absorb nutrients and pollutants.  Natural shorelines, shorelines that have not been altered by man, help protect a lake from silt-laden runoff waters.  They also provide excellent places for wildlife to feed, hide, and raise their young.  Protection of the Moccasin Lake watershed is also needed for maintaining water quality.Anglers can help maintain or improve the quality of fishing by practicing catch and release of medium to large-sized fish.  Releasing these fish will help maintain the fish population in Moccasin Lake and provides anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Status of the Fishery     Moccasin Lake is a 243-acre lake located northeast of Hackensack, Minnesota off the Woodtick Trail.  Forty-five percent of Moccasin Lake surface area  is 15 feet or less in depth, and it has a maximum depth of 95 feet.  There is a concrete boat ramp on the east shore which is owned by the US Forest Service.  Moccasin Lake is located within the Chippewa National Forest, and the shoreline is a mixture of lakeshore residences and public land.      The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources has categorized Minnesota's lakes into 43 different classes based on each lake's physical and chemical characteristics.  Moccasin Lake is in Lake Class 32, and this Lake Class can be described as lakes with large and irregular (shape) surface area with high turbidity and hard water.       The primary management species for Moccasin Lake are largemouth bass and northern pike, and secondary management species are black crappie, bluegill, and yellow perch.  As part of the statewide experimental regulation project, a catch-and-release regulation for largemouth bass was implemented in spring 1996 and will be evaluated prior to spring 2003.  The objective of this regulation is to increase the percentage of largemouth bass 15 inches and greater.     The catch rate for largemouth bass was average for samples collected from 1992 to 2000.  Growth of largemouth bass was average for Lake Class 32.  Lengths of largemouth bass sampled ranged  from 5 to 19 inches.  The percentage of fish greater than 15 inches long has increased since the implementation of the catch and release regulation.              The catch rate for northern pike was considerably higher than average for this lake type.  Growth was slower than average for similar area lakes.  Lengths of northern pike ranged from 10 to 34 inches, but the size structure was dominated by smaller fish.     The catch rate for black crappie was average for samples collected from 1992 to 2000.  Growth was above average for similar area lakes.  Lengths of black crappie sampled ranged from 7 to 12 inches, and 60% of the fish were greater than 10 inches.              The catch rate for bluegill was average for Lake Class 32 lakes.  Three-fourths of the bluegill were between 3 and 6 inches.  Growth was exceptionally slow compared to other local lakes in this class.     Anglers can help maintain or improve the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for table fare, but encourages release of medium- to large-size fish.  Releasing these fish can help maintain balance in the fish community in Moccasin Lake and provide anglers with opportunities to catch more and larger fish in the future.     Shoreline areas - on the land and into the shallow water - provide essential habitat for fish and wildlife that live in or near Minnesota's lakes.  Overdeveloped shorelines can't support the fish, wildlife, and clean water that are associated with natural undeveloped lakes. The combined effects of all lakeshore owners \"fixing up\" their property can destroy a lake's valuable natural shorelines.     Shoreline habitat consists of aquatic plants, woody plants and natural lake bottom soils.  Plants in the water and at the water's edge provide habitat, prevent erosion and absorb excess nutrients. Shrubs, trees, and woody debris such as fallen trees or limbs provide good habitat both above and below the water and should be left in place.  Natural lake bottom materials like silt or gravel are more ecologically productive than pure sand trucked in for a swimming beach.  A tidy lawn and a sandy beach make great spots for sunbathing and swimming but do little to provide habitat for fish and wildlife. By leaving a buffer strip of natural vegetation along the shoreline, property owners can reduce erosion, help maintain water quality, and provide habitat and travel corridors for wildlife.     Only if lakeshore owners manage their shoreline in a natural condition can fish and wildlife populations on Minnesota lakes remain healthy and abundant.  More specific information on protecting or restoring shorelines and watersheds is available through DNR Fisheries offices.    </p>",
