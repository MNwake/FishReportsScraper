                "narrative": "<p>Spring Trap netting was performed June 1-3, 2021 to provide pre-regulation data on the Bluegill size structure.   A bag limit of 5 sunfish was implemented on March 1, 2022 as Shakopee Lake was selected for participation in the statewide Quality Sunfish Initiative.  The objective of the lowered bag limit is to reduce sunfish harvest and allow for more fish to attain larger sizes (8-10 inches).   Spring trap netting is the preferred method for evaluating panfish populations.  Several similar spring efforts are planned over the 10 year evaluation period to assess potential changes resulting from the 5 sunfish bag limit. <br> \n <br> \nSpring trap netting in 2021 captured 876 Bluegill of which 500 were measured.  Bluegill ranged from 3.2 - 9.8 inches and mean length was 6.96 inches.  Many of the fish were of sizes desired by anglers, as fish over 7 inches comprised 45% of the catch and fish greater than 8 inches made up 10% of the sample.  Bluegill 9 inches or greater made up less than 1% of the catch.  The lake maintains a favorable size structure for Bluegills despite the heavy fishing pressure evident during the winter and open water seasons.  It is suspected that a reduction in harvest though to the lowered bag limit will result in an increased presence of larger fish in the 8-10 inch range.  Bluegill size structure goals developed for the Quality Sunfish Initiative aim for at least 50% of the sample to exceed 7 inches, 20% to exceed 8 inches and 5% over 9 inches.   Whether voluntary or required due to the reduced bag limit, release of larger sunfish, especially fish over 9 inches will be important if the lake is to realize its potential in reaching management goals.  Additional criteria that may be used to measure success of the reduced sunfish bag limit include mean size, catch rate of fish over 8 inches, and mean length of top 10% of fish.   <br> \n <br> \nBluegills in Shakopee show decent but not fast growth rates, with fish attaining 6.4 inches at Age 5 and 7.5 inches at Age 7.  Growth was sustained well past 8 inches.   <br> \n   <br> \nSpring trap nets produced a small sample of nine Black Crappies.  Catches of crappie can be quite variable in the spring. The continued use of spring trap nets to evaluate the sunfish population may prove useful in assessing crappie population characteristics.  The crappie bag limit remains at 10 fish. <br> \n <br> \nPumpkinseed were relatively abundant in the 2021 spring trap nets, as 149 fish were observed.  A subsample of 27 Pumpkinseeds was measured and maximum length was just 7.05 inches.  Mean length was 5.78 inches.  A total of 26 Hybrid Sunfish were also sampled but none were measured. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>    Shakopee Lake is part of a chain of shallow lakes connected by the Rum River in Mille Lacs County.  The lake has a reputation for providing quality open water and winter angling experiences for walleye, northern pike, crappie, and bluegill.  Anglers often use the lake when weather conditions make it difficult for fishing on Mille Lacs Lake.  The lake occassionally experiences partial winterkills which temporarily set back fish populations.   The fish community in the lake is dominated by species like northern pike and bullheads which are more tolerant of low oxygen and thrive under conditions found in Shakopee Lake.   Northern pike numbers showed a significant increase from the last survey.  The species has prime spawning habitat downstream in Onamia Lake as well as marsh areas around inlets.  The average size found in the survey was about 21 inches or 2 pounds, with larger pike up to 36 inches observed.   Some pike migration from Mille Lacs Lake has been documented so anglers have the potential to hook a trophy size fish.   Anglers are once again reporting good walleye fishing and a wide range of sizes was observed in the survey.  Walleye fry are stocked in odd numbered years, which supplements natural reproduction, and immigration from Mille Lacs and the Rum River.   A record number of black crappies and bluegills were caught in the survey with some nicer fish of both species present.   While anglers may have to work a little harder to find \"keeper\" size crappies, bluegills over 7 inches in length were common in the survey.  Muskellunge, an immigrant from Mille Lacs, are occasionally seen or caught by anglers in Shakopee Lake.\n    One change in the fish community which may have a negative impact on the fish community was a decrease in yellow perch numbers.  While anglers may be happy with fewer perch stealing their bait, perch can be an important food fish for both northern pike and walleye as well as other species.  The decrease in perch numbers should have less impact due to the presence of other prey species from the Rum River system. Shakopee Lake appears to have abundant populations of all three bullhead species with the black bullheads being the most common.  The yellow bullhead had the biggest average length at 10 inches with the smallest being black bullheads at 8 inches.  Some quality size fish up to 12 inches were observed in all three species.  Bowfin or dogfish are also abundant and even though they are not considered a food fish, they can provide some angling excitement.  While carp are present in the lake, they do not appear to be at a level deterimental to the lake.\n    Shakopee Lake has an abundance of undeveloped shoreline and quality emergent vegetation stands throughout the lake.  Portions of the north and south shoreline are within the boundaries of  Kathio State Park, which provides protection for valuable fish and wildlife habitats.  Preservation of natural shoreline conditions will help to maintain a natural ecosystem that will benefit a wide range of fish and wildlife species.  When water levels at times are low, launching bigger boats at the access can be a challenge.  Zebra mussels and eurasian milfoil have been identified in Mille Lacs which is up stream of Shakopee Lake.  Remember to check your boat trailer for vegetation and drain any water in the boat before leaving the access to slow the spread of exotics to other lakes.</p>",

Water clarity was measured to 10.4 feet and there is a dark, bog-stain color to the water. <br> \n <br> \nShakopee's Walleye population can be described as \"low density\", with a higher than usual presence of older, larger fish. Only nine Walleyes were captured, the majority of which were five years of age or older. Walleyes have been stocked since 1985 mainly consisting of fry. The success of stocking has been highly variable, with many stockings producing no measurable year class and a few stockings producing very strong year classes. There is also natural reproduction in Shakopee as well as immigration of Walleyes from Mille Lacs Lake. Due to these variables, fry stocking will be discontinued by MNDNR however, the Mille Lacs Band of Ojibwe can continue to stock fry when available. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike abundance has increased over the years in Shakopee Lake. Good numbers of pike over 28 inches were captured and three measured over 30 inches. Pike abundance that gets too high can be problematic for other competitor species such as Walleye but can also hurt the abundance of the lake's primary prey species, Yellow Perch. Gill net captures of perch were strong in the early 2000s; dropped in the mid-2000s but now appears to have rebounded again. This is good news since a healthy perch population can be an indicator that predator abundance is at healthy levels. <br> \n <br> \nElectrofishing targeting Bluegills was completed rather than traditional trap netting due to Covid working guidelines. A total of 181 fish were captured. Over 40% of the sample measured 7 inches or larger and two fish exceeded 9 inches. Data were collected prior to anticipated harvest regulations designed to improve Bluegill size structure. Potential future regulations will be part of the statewide Quality Sunfish Initiative (QSI). <br> \n <br> \nWhile fishing for sunfish it is best to limit your harvest of large individuals, especially the males. Large males exhibit the best growth rates and also discourage the behavior of smaller, slower growing males from spawning. Studies show that it's important for sunfish to use their energy for body growth rather than gonadal development at a young age and small size. Male Bluegill can usually be discerned from females by their more pronounced coloration and darker orange breast. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Shakopee Lake is part of a chain of shallow lakes connected by the Rum River in Mille Lacs County.  Shakopee Lake has a reputation for providing quality open water and winter angling experiences for walleye, northern pike, crappie and bluegill.  Anglers often use the lake when weather conditions make it difficult for fishing on Mille Lacs.  A year-round creel survey conducted in 1996 documented high catch rates for walleye and northern pike and low catches of quality size black crappie and bluegill.  A winterkill, which occurred during the winter of 2000/2001, reduced or eliminated all sport fish populations.  This event will limit angling opportunities until these populations recover and grow to catchable size.  Fast growth rates typical following a winterkill should shorten the recovery period.  Northern pike numbers were low when compared to previous surveys but fishable numbers were present.  Some pike may have survived the winter and others likely immigrated into Shakopee Lake from Mille Lacs and the Rum River.  Some tagged Mille Lacs northern pike have been recaptured in Shakopee Lake by anglers in the past indicating movement occurs between the lakes.  Quality northerns over 30.0 inches were present and 35% of the fish captured in the 2001 survey were 24.0 inches and larger.  Three walleye were sampled in this assessment and were adults that likely moved into the lake from Mille Lacs or the Rum River.  Walleye fry are stocked in Shakopee Lake in odd numbered years, which supplement natural reproduction, and immigration from Mille Lacs and the Rum River.  Bluegill catch rates were typical of past surveys (3.67/trapnet), however, those sampled were mainly fish that were stocked during the spring and less than 7.0 inches.  Only one black crappie was caught during the survey.  A healthy prey base consisting of minnow species, white sucker and yellow perch exists in the lake.  Muskellunge, an immigrant from Mille Lacs, are occasionally seen or caught by anglers in Shakopee Lake.    Shakopee Lake has an abundance of undeveloped shoreline and quality emergent vegetation stands throughout the lake.  Portions of the north and south shorelines are within the boundaries of Kathio State Park, which provides protection for valuable fish and wildlife habitats.  Preservation of natural shoreline conditions will help to maintain a natural ecosystem that will benefit a wide range of fish and wildlife species.  Shakopee Lake will continue to provide excellent angling opportunities with occasional setbacks due to winterkill.  Winterkill should not be viewed as negative on Shakopee Lake, but an event that may be an important element in maintaining a quality fishery with fast growing gamefish and panfish species.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Though infrequent in occurrence, winterkills have the potential tosignificantly impact the fish community structure of Shakopee Lake.  Winterkill ismost likely to occur when severe winters coincide with low flows in the Rum Riverwhich runs through the lake.  The most recent winterkill event occurred in 1988-89resulting in reduced populations of many gamefish and panfish species.  Maintainingadequate winter flows in the Rum River is important to the overwinter survival ofmany desirable fish species.  Migration of fish through the Rum River helps torebuild a diverse fish community after winterkills.     Shakopee Lake currently supports a diverse and healthy fish community.  Thewalleye population is doing quite well as indicated by the 1995 gillnet catch(8/set) which is a record high.  A variety of sizes and year classes arerepresented.  Northern pike are also found in good numbers (10/gillnet set).  Amajority of the pike are small, however fish over 10 pounds have been regularlynoted in survey nets and by anglers and spearers.     The 1995 netting data suggests black crappie are present in good numbers withmany fish in the 10-13 inch range.  Strong year classes were produced in '91 and'93 helping to maintain the population of catchable size crappie.  Bluegill arepresent in low numbers, but quality size fish are available.  Bluegills from 8-10inches were observed in 1995 sampling efforts.  Largemouth and smallmouth bassinhabit the lake in low numbers.  Migration of many species of fish likely occursthrough Shakopee Lake via the Rum River.     </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>     Shakopee Lake is part of a chain of shallow lakes connected by the Rum River in Mille Lacs County. The lake is characterized by having dense beds of submergent vegetation consisting of flatstem pondweed, northern watermilfoil, coontail, and large-leaved pondweed.  A fringe of cattail can be found around much of the lake.  The most common shallow water substrate was sand.  The lake has a reputation for providing quality open water and winter angling experiences for Walleye, Northern Pike, Black Crappie, and Bluegill. Anglers often use the lake when weather conditions make it difficult for fishing on Mille Lacs Lake. The lake occasionally experiences partial winterkills which temporarily set back fish populations. The fish community in the lake is dominated by species like Northern Pike and bullhead which are more tolerant of low oxygen and thrive under conditions found in Shakopee Lake. Fewer fish overall were caught in the 2013 survey which may have been weather related rather than reflective of fish abundance.  <br> \n      Northern Pike appear to be abundant and the average size in the survey about nineteen inches or 1.8 pounds, however, there were some fish over thirty inches observed.  The species has prime spawning habitat downstream in Onamia Lake as well as marsh areas around inlets.  Some pike migration from Mille Lacs Lake has been documented so anglers have the potential to hook a trophy size fish.  Walleye numbers were down from the last survey but average size caught in the nets was 2.5 pounds.  Walleye fry are stocked in odd numbered years, which supplements natural reproduction, and immigration from Mille Lacs Lake and the Rum River. Black Crappie and Bluegill numbers were also down from the last survey but some quality size fish were observed.    Anglers also report seeing or catching an occasional Muskellunge and a Tiger Muskellunge was one of the species caught in the survey.  These fish are likely immigrants from Mille Lacs Lake.  Yellow Perch numbers showed an increase in abundance which should benefit the fish community.   While anglers may not be happy with perch stealing their bait, perch can be an important food fish for both Northern Pike and Walleye as well as other species.  All three bullhead species reside in Shakopee Lake with Black Bullhead being the most common. Quality size individuals up to eleven inches or more were caught of each species.  Bowfin or Dogfish are present and even though they are not considered a food fish, they can provide some angling excitement.  While Common Carp are present in the lake, they do not appear to be at a level detrimental to the lake's habitat. <br> \n      Shakopee Lake has an abundance of undeveloped shoreline and quality emergent vegetation stands throughout the lake.  Portions of the north and south shoreline are within the boundaries of Mille Lacs Kathio State Park, which provides protection for valuable fish and wildlife habitats.  Preservation of natural shoreline conditions will help to maintain a natural ecosystem that will benefit a wide range of fish and wildlife species.  When water levels are low, launching bigger boats at the access can be a challenge.   Zebra mussels, eurasian watermilfoil, and spiny waterfleas have been identified in Mille Lacs Lake which is up stream of Shakopee Lake.  Remember to check your boat trailer for vegetation and drain any water in the boat before leaving the access to slow the spread of exotics to other lakes. <br> \n</p>",
