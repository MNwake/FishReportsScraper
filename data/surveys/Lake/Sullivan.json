Gillnet catches were substantially lower (3.0/lift) in 1992 than in 1988 (12.5/lift). Average size remained nearly the same at 2.8 lbs. Yellow Perch were sampled (16.0/lift) for the first time since the reclamation and have become the primary forage species. Previous assessments caught Rainbow Trout and Brook Trout in low numbers, but since stream trout management has been discontinued they are no longer present. Bluegill were introduced in 1990, however they do not appear to be flourishing as of yet as only 3 adults were taken.</p>",

A state forestry campground is located along the east shore with a gravel access ramp suitable for launching small boats.     The fish population is comprised of northern pike, bluegill, yellow perch, white sucker and various minnow species.  Test nets in 1997 found northern pike abundance about average when compared to similar lakes in this lake class.  The average size of northern pike was quite small (less than 1 pound) with the largest fish sampled being just over 3 pounds.     Bluegill were introduced in 1990, and stocked again in 1994 and 1995.  Test nets in 1997 indicate that bluegill abundance is just average compared to similar lakes in this lake class, although the population structure indicates that some natural reproduction is occuring.  A few bluegill up to 10 inches were observed, however most of the fish sampled were between 5.5 inches and 7.0 inches.     The abundance of yellow perch is average, however there are some respectable size yellow perch present.  A few fish greater than 12 inches were observed, with about 13% of the yellow perch sampled being greater than 9 inches in length.</p>",

Access is off Lake County Road 15 to a gravel ramp on the northeast side of the lake.  The lake is surrounded by state land, with the only development an 11 unit state campground along the east shore.Northern pike were sampled in average numbers, although the average weight (less than 2 pounds) was below normal.  The largest northern pike collected in the 2003 assessment was 30.9 inches (7.4 pounds).  This was the only fish larger than 23.0 inches taken in the assessment.Yellow perch were sampled in average numbers, with fish up to 11.9 inches collected.  Approximately 11% of the yellow perch were larger than 9.0 inches, but most were too small to interest anglers.Bluegill were stocked in Sullivan Lake in the early 1990's.  No bluegill were sampled in 2003; however, bluegill were collected in the two previous assessments.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Sullivan Lake has an area of 45 acres with a maximum depth of eight feet.  Sullivan Lake is located 25 miles north of Two Harbors, MN.  The lake contains very dark brown bog-stained water.  The shoreline cover is a mix deciduous/coniferous forest and wetland marsh.  Seventeen aquatic plants have been observed in the lake with muck and sand being the most abundant substrates.  The entire shoreline is under public ownership and a 12 site campground administered by Split Rock State Park is located near the northeastern shore.  The campground operates on a first come basis with no reservations at this time.  The lake access road is about 0.25 miles west on Forest Highway 11 from the southern intersection with Lake County Highway 2.  The access is a back-down earthen ramp on the northeastern end of the lake.  Northern Pike, Yellow Perch, and Bluegill are the most common game fish in the lake. Fishing pressure is presumed to be light to moderate. <br> \n <br> \nThe 2016 survey found the catch rate of Northern Pike to be slightly below average compared to similar lakes in northeastern Minnesota.  The average length for Northern Pike was 19.4 inches with an average weight of 1.9 pounds.  The largest Northern Pike measured 30.7 inches long and weighed 7.5 pounds. Seven year classes were represented in the 2016 survey and growth of Northern Pike was average when compared to other lakes in the Finland Area. <br> \n <br> \nThe Yellow Perch catch was above average when compared to similar lakes in the area.  The average length was 7.35 inches with an average weight of 0.22 pounds.  The largest Yellow Perch measured was 11.9 inches long and had a weight of 0.7 pounds.  Eight year classes were represented in the sample and growth of Yellow Perch was average for the Finland Area.  <br> \n  <br> \nA total of 26 Bluegills were sampled with standard trap nets and small mesh trap nets.  Three Bluegills measured over 9 inches long and had weights over 1 pound.  Bluegills have been stocked in Sullivan Lake four times in an attempt to establish a self-sustaining population; the last stocking was in 2005.  Previous surveys found very low numbers of Bluegills.  Small Bluegill were sampled in the 2016 survey indicating that there is some natural reproduction occurring in the lake.   <br> \n <br> \nWhite Sucker, Blacknose Shiner, and Creek Chub were also sampled in Sullivan Lake during the 2016 survey.   <br> \n</p>",

Brook Trout catch was about 1/2 the local average with an average length of 6.5\". Northern Pike have found their way back into the lake following the 1984 reclamation. No Northern Pike were sampled in the 1985 assessment, however, the 1987 catch of 0.5/lift indicates a rising population. White Sucker densities are increasing, indicated by a trapnet catch over 2 times that of the 1985 assessment.</p>",
