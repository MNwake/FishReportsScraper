                "narrative": "<p>Upper Gull is a 371 acre lake located about four miles west of Nisswa.  Public access is via a navigable channel from Gull Lake.  The lake has a maximum depth of 54 feet and about 42% of the lake is shallower than 15 feet.  It is a hardwater lake with moderate phosphorus fertility.  Water clarity is about average for area lakes.  Shallow water soils are primarily sand and gravel, with significant areas of mucky soils present as well.  The aquatic plant community is rather diverse.  Emergent species like bulrush help control erosion caused by wave action, help maintain water quality and improve the quality of spawning habitat for bass and panfish species.  Wild rice is often an important component for successful northern pike spawning, especially in shallow water areas.  Submergent vegetation provides vital food and cover for a wide variety of aquatic life.Northern pike was the most abundant gamefish in the 1996 test netting, while bluegill was the most abundant panfish.  The northern pike catch was \"average\" when compared to similar type lakes, but was higher than previous catches in Upper Gull.  Several year classes were sampled and growth was good.  Compared to 1991, average size went from 22 inches and 3.1 lbs. to 19 inches and 2.4 lbs.Walleyes were stocked into adjoining Gull Lake on a regular basis in recent years.  These fish have free access to Upper Gull.  The 1996 catch was in the \"average\" category when compared to similar type lakes and was also similar to catches seen in the past three nettings.  Average size was 15 inches and 0.9 lbs. in '91, 15 inches and 1.4 lbs. in '96.Largemouth bass numbers bordered on \"low\" in 1996 but were similar to previous catch rates.  Young bass were plentiful in shallow water seine hauls made in mid-August.Black crappies were caught in \"average\" numbers in '96, similar to the catch in '91.  Several year classes were sampled, but most fish were from the 1994 year class.  Crappie growth was good.  Bluegill numbers were in the \"average\" category and the catch was similar to that of the 1986 netting.  The 1991 catch was in the \"high\" category.  A number of age classes were sampled and growth varied between slow and good for individual year classes in the sample.  About 17% of bluegills measured from trapnets were 7.0 inches or more in length.  About 9% were in this size range in '91.Yellow perch, white sucker and tullibee are important food sources for gamefish in the lake.  Yellow perch numbers were in the \"low\" category in 1996 and growth was slow.  The white sucker catch was in the \"average\" range and similar to catches in the previous two nettings.  Tullibees were found in \"high\" numbers, for the second netting in a row.Other species sampled in 1996 included brown trout, bowfin (dogfish), rock bass, pumpkinseed, hybrid sunfish and yellow bullhead.  These species were generally taken in numbers considered to be \"average\" compared to similar type lakes.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of nearshore fish species in Upper Gull Lake was conducted beginning on July 6th, 2021 by Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program Staff. Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at 10 sampling stations. Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample seven stations and a 15-foot seine was used at three stations. Nearshore sampling captured 22 species of fish including seven species that are intolerant of disturbance (i.e. Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, Least Darter, Mimic Shiner, and Rock Bass) and two that are tolerant of disturbance (i.e. Black Bullhead and Green Sunfish). <br> \n <br> \nA concurrent summer trap net survey was conducted the week of July 6th, 2021 by IBI Program Staff. Nine trap nets were set along the shoreline and in shallow offshore locations that encompassed multiple habitat types. Bluegill and Pumpkinseed comprised a majority of the trap net catch by number, Bowfin and Yellow Bullhead comprised a majority of the trap net catch by biomass. Bowfin count per net and mean weight were both at or above the 75th quartile for similar Lake Class 25 lakes. The Bluegill count per net was below the 50th quartile, while their mean weight was below the 25th quartile for similar Lake Class 25 lakes. <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore and trap net data were combined with gill net data from a June 2019 survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based IBI (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment. In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g. Banded Killifish, Least Darter, and Rock Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g. Green Sunfish, Fathead Minnows, and Common Carp). The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.  <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Crow Wing River Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Upper Gull Lake is a 371 acre lake located on the Gull Chain of Lakes about 3 miles west of Nisswa.  Public access is via a navigable channel from Gull Lake.  The lake is heavily developed with 20.5 homes/cabins per shoreline mile based on 1996 data.  The maximum depth is 54 feet and about 42 percent of the lake is 15 feet deep or less.  Shallow water substrates consist primarily of sand and gravel, although large areas of mucky soils are also present.  The lake has a diverse aquatic plant community with 35 species present and is critical to maintaining healthy fish populations.  Emergent plants such as water lillies are common along much of the shoreline.  It is essential to protect and maintain these plants as they are important for shoreline protection, maintaining water quality, and provide critical habitat for bass and panfish species.  Submerged plants provide food and cover needed by fish and other aquatic species.  \n\nNorthern pike were caught in good numbers in 2007 at 6 per gill net.  Average length and weight were above average at 23.2 inches and 2.9 lbs. with 32 percent of these fish measuring at least 24 inches.  The 2004 and 2005 year classes were most abundant, representing 50 percent of the catch and measuring approximately 18 to 22 inches.  \n\nThe walleye catch of 0.6 per gill net is below average.  The population that exists likely results from migration from Gull Lake with some limited spawning in various inlets.  Though not particularly abundant, average length and weight were 17.8 inches and 2.3 lbs.\n\nThe 2007 bluegill catch of 13 per trap net is low compared to past catches on this lake, but considered average when compared to similar lakes.  Black crappies were present in average numbers at 1.0 per gill net and 0.9 per trap net.  Tullibee and yellow perch are important forage species for the lake's game fish.  Both species were found in below average numbers compared to past catches on this and similar lakes.  \n</p>",

After 10:00 A.M. channels in Upper Gull are like a raceway, making fishing difficult.Additional Field Notes: Caught three snapping turtles with carapaces of fifteen, nine and seven and one-half inch diameters.  Observed two loons, one adult mallard with six young and another adult mallard with two young.Present Fish Population Status:  Present northern pike population is composed mainly of II and III year-old fish with abundance about average for local area and growth rate below.  Walleye population is low with a lack of dominant size group.  Bluegill abundance almost two-times local average with size normal for this area but growth rate still on slow side.  Black crappies are present four times local average.  Bullhead species present in moderate numbers with size respectable.  Yellow perch and northern cisco are very abundant.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Upper Gull Lake is located about four miles west of Nisswa and is part of the Gull Lake chain.  It is 371 acres with a maximum depth of 54'.  About 42% of the lake is less than 15' deep.  Shoreline substrate is composed primarily of sand and gravel, with large areas of mucky soils present as well.  The aquatic plant community is relatively diverse with 35 species present.  Emergent plants such as bulrush ans wild rice are important for shoreline protection, maintaining water quality and provide essential spawning habitat for northern pike, bass, and panfish species.  Submerged plants provide food and cover needed by fish and othe aquatic species.Northern pike were sampled at a rate of 4.9/gill net, which is average compared to similar lakes and comparable to past catches.  The 1996 and 1997 year classes were most prominent, accounting for 64% of the fish sampled.  Compared to 1996, average length increased from 21.3\" to 24.3\" and average weight from 2.4lbs to 3.7lbs.Walleye were caught in below average numbers compared to similar lakes, but at 1.2/gill net, the catch was similar to those from previous nettings.  Compared to 1996, average length increased from 15.2\" to 16.0\", but mean weight decreased from 2.0lbs to 1.8lbs.The largemouth bass catch of 0.2/trap net was below average for the lake class.  Largemouth were caught in better numbers by spring electrofishing.  Mean length of these fish was 12.7\" and 62% were 12\" or larger.Black crappie abundance in trap nets was below average for the first time in the six nettings to date.  The gill net catch, however, was above average when compared to similar lakes and was up from 1996.  About 29% of all crappies measured were 8\" or larger.  Bluegill abundance was well above average in 2001.  The catch was 98.6/trap net with almost 6% of these fish measuring 7\" or larger, compared to 17% in 1996 and 9% in 1991.  Growth for both black crappies and bluegills was relatively slow.Yellow perch, white suckers, and tullibees provide food for the lake's game fish.  All three species were caught in average numbers in 2001.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of nearshore fish species in Upper Gull Lake, a 422 acre lake that is part of the larger Gull Lake Chain of Lakes, was conducted on August 14, 2019 by Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program Staff.  Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot seine, where possible.  Backpack electrofishing was completed at all ten sampling stations, but two stations were sampled from the boat due to site conditions.  Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample eight stations and site conditions prevented the use of seines at two stations.  Nearshore sampling captured 23 species of fish including seven species that are intolerant of disturbance (i.e., Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Mimic Shiner, Pugnose Shiner, Rock Bass, and Smallmouth Bass) and one that is tolerant of disturbance (i.e., Green Sunfish). <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore data were combined with trap net and gill net data from a June 2019 survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based IBI (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment.  In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g., Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, and Smallmouth Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g., Green Sunfish).  The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake.  For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.   <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey indicates Upper Gull Lake is healthy as indicated by an exceptionally high FIBI score, well above the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes.  The strong connection between Upper Gull Lake and the rest of the Gull Lake Chain of Lakes could be contributing to the exceptionally high FIBI score.  Data from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Crow Wing Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Upper Gull is a 422 acre lake located in the city of Lakeshore in southern Cass County.  It is part of the Gull Chain of Lakes.  Upper Gull reaches depths of 54', with 36% of the lake 15' deep or less.  Water clarity is good, with a secchi disk reading of 11.5'.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike were sampled in average numbers at 6.4/gill net when compared to similar lakes.  Average length was 21.7\", with 16% in the protected 22\"-26\" slot.  Northern pike at least 26.0\" made up 17% of the catch.  Lakes in this part of the state have a new northern pike regulation enacted in 2018: possession limit of 10 with not more than 2 over 26\".  All from 22\"-26\" must be immediately released.  Please refer to the current Minnesota Fishing Regulations for additional information. <br> \n <br> \nWalleyes are not stocked into Upper Gull, but are stocked annually into connected Gull Lake.  The gill net catch of 1.2/net was just below average.  Average length was nice at 21.4\", with fish up to 28.4\" sampled. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappies were sampled in average numbers in gill nets at 1.8/net.  Average length was 6.8\".  Trap nets sampled black crappies in below average numbers at 0.4/net.  Average length was 9.4\".  For both gears combined 50% were at least 8.0\" in length.  Bluegills were captured in average numbers at 18.0/trap net.  Average length was 5.0\", with 14% at least 7.0\" in length. <br> \n <br> \nUpper Gull is designated as AIS (aquatic invasive species) infested waters because of zebra mussels.  Lake users are required to inspect and remove any aquatic plants and animals from their watercraft and trailers as well as pull the plug and drain all water from the watercraft, including bilges, livewells and baitwells. <br> \n</p>",

Average size rose from 2.75 lb to 3.12 lb since 1986, while the median size rose from 21\" (range = 15-34\") to 22\" (range = 17-36\").  Growth remained good.The walleye catch showed a statistically significant decrease of 46% and dropped below the first quartile.  Average size dropped from average to small since 1986.  Median size rose from 13\" (range = 10-22\") to 15\" (range = 9.5-15\").  Sample size was small with only four age classes represented (compared to six in 1986).Largemouth bass were also caught in low numbers.  Only two bass were sampled, both eight inches long.Bluegill abundance (53.33/trapnet) doubled since 1986 and was again above the upper quartile.  Size rose from small (0.10/lb) to average (0.13/lb) while median length remained at 5.5 inches.  The percent of measured bluegills at least 7.0 inches rose from 7.5% in 1986 to 8.9% in 1991.Black crappie were again caught in average numbers.  Average size remained small (0.21/ lb) and median length remained at 6.5\".Brown trout were first sampled in 1991.  Four fish were sampled, undoubtedly originating from Stoney Brook, a designated trout stream.Yellow perch abundance (4.57/gillnet) was similar to 1986 and average for the lake class.  Average size became small (0.09 lb) and median length dropped from 6.0 to 5.5 inches.  Cisco, however, showed a fivefold increase to 8.57/gillnet, barely exceeding the upper quartile value.  Size remained average and median length remained at 13 inches.</p>",

While most species were present in numbers average for this type of lake, the sizes were not that impressive.  Northern pike numbers were above average (8.6/net) but size was on the small side, with only 14% of the fish measuring 24\" or larger.   All of the walleye were 17\" or larger, but only 8 were caught.  <br> \n <br> \nPanfish numbers were average for this type of lake, but again size was small.  Average length of bluegill was 6.0\" (30% were 7\" or larger) and only 15% of the black crappie were 8\" or larger. <br> \n <br> \nUpper Gull is designated as AIS (aquatic invasive species) infested waters because of zebra mussels in Gull Lake.  Lake users should inspect and remove any aquatic plants and animals from their watercraft and trailers as well as pull the plug and drain all water from the watercraft, including bilges, livewells and baitwells. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Special Problems & Conditions Affecting Fish and Fishing:  Submerged vegetation is extremely heavy, making shoreline fishing difficult. Boat traffic is extremely heavy and jet skis were abundant and annoying during time of survey.  After 10:00 A.M.  fishing in channel becomes difficult due to the high density of pleasure crafts (other than fishing boats).Additional Field Notes:  Observed 1 adult mallard and 4 young-of-year, 2 adult loons and 1 young-of-year, 1 muskrat, snapping turtles with the following size carapaces were caught in trapnets 7.0, 8.0, 10.5, 12.0 inches.Present Fish Population Status:  Bowfin net catches indicated above average abundance since net catches were above the third quartile of the regional median.  Northern cisco, northern pike, white sucker, yellow bullhead, brown bullhead, rock bass, pumpkinseed, bluegill, largemouth bass, yellow perch and walleye net catches indicate average populations since they fell between the first and third quartile of the regional median.  Black crappie net catches indicate below average populations since they fell below the first quartile of the regional median.  Hybrid sunfish net catches were above the statewide median.  Black bullhead in gillnets were caught in average numbers when compared to the regional median.Seven gillnets were set the end of June and the first part of July in 1981 and 1986.  Nine gillnets were set this same time period in 1964.  Based on these net catches, northern pike abundance has significantly decreased since 1981 but is about the same as the 1964 netting.  The yellow perch population is significantly less than the 1964 or 1981 netting.  Walleye abundance is about the same as the 1981 netting but higher than in 1964.Northern pike aged (19 of 22 fish) showed age classes II-V present in the nets with age class III making up at least 58% of the population.  Northern pike were 14.6 inches at annuli III and 28.0 inches at annuli V.  All age classes exhibited average growth rates when compared to statewide averages.  The median length was 21.9 inches and weighed approximately 2.5 pounds.Black, yellow and brown bullheads each had a large average size with the respective mean weights being 0.8, 0.9, and 0.6 pounds.  Yellow bullhead was the most abundant.Rock bass, green sunfish and pumpkinseed sizes were mainly small.Bluegill age classes present in the net catches were II-VII and age class IX.  Age classes III-VI were well-represented with only 5% of the fish older than age class VI.  All age classes exhibited a slow growth rate except age class VII (1 fish) which exhibited an average growth rate compared to the statewide average.  The median size bluegill belonged in the 5.5-5.9 inch group and averaged 0.13 pounds.  At annuli III bluegills were 3.5 inches long and 5.9 inches at annuli VI.Only two largemouth bass were aged and both belonged to age class II and averaged 6.8 inches at annuli II which is considered average growth rate.  Two age classes were present (II and III) in the net catches of black crappies.  At annuli II they were 4.1 inches and at annuli III 6.3, inches which is considered an average growth rate.The length frequency range of yellow perch was 4.5 to 8.7 inches.  Age classes III-V were present. Annuli III fish average 5.4 inches and 7.4 inches at annuli V.  All three age classes exhibited average growth rates.Walleye aged (10 fish) showed six age classes (II-V and VII and VIII) present.  Age class II was the predominate age class and made up 50% of fish aged.  Annuli II (5 fish) fish averaged 9.5 inches and annuli VIII (1 fish) was 20.1 inches.  All age classes exhibited a good growth rate.   </p>",
