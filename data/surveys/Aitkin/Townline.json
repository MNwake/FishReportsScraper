As a result, most of the fish species in the lake exhibit slow growth rates and have a small mean length. Trapnetted bluegills and black crappies averaged 5.6 and 6.9 inches in length, respectively, in this survey. The largest bluegill caught was only 7.9 inches long and the largest black crappie was only 9.5 inches long. Trapnet catches of bluegills, pumpkinseeds and black crappies decreased from 1988 to 1994 and are now within the normal range for lakes of this type. If this trend persists, fish growth rates will increase and more acceptable fish will be available for anglers. Northern pike numbers were within the normal range for this type of lake, the average length was 20.3 inches and one 38.4 inch fish was caught. Most of the northern pike were between 18 and 23 inches long.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Townline Lake is a small lake located in central Aitkin County approximately five miles south of Palisade. The lake is 61 acres in size and about 40 percent is less than 15 feet deep. Due to the lack of nutrient-rich soils in the lake's small watershed, the fertility of the lake is low and as a result, most of the fish species in the lake exhibit slower than normal growth rates and have a small mean length.Anglers fishing on Townline Lake will find a variety of panfish as well as largemouth bass and northern pike. The bluegill fishery has exploded over the last 10 years increasing from 13 fish per trap net in 1994 to an astounding 166 fish per trap net in 2004. The largest bluegill sampled was 9.5 inches but the mean size was a mere 5.2 inches in total length. There are many factors that could be contributing to the large increase in bluegill numbers including seasonal sampling variations, lack of predation, increased fishing mortality on large bluegills or simply favorable reproductive conditions.   Black crappie have declined in abundance over the years but are still above the third quartile ranking for lakes of this type. Black crappie over 10 inches were sampled and the mean size was 8.4 inches. Northern pike numbers have remained relatively stable over the years and in 2004 there were 6 fish per net with a mean size of nearly 22 inches. The largest individual pike captured in 2004 was 28.9 inches long.  Anglers are encouraged to release the large northern pike, largemouth bass and dogfish to increase predation on the stunted bluegills.  </p>",
