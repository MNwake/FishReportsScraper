                "narrative": "<p>Dutch is a 160-acre lake located in the city of Mound in western Hennepin County.  A public city-owned boat launch with small parking lot is located on the east side, and a small access with minimal on-street parking is available on the south side (via Dutch Lane).  Shore fishing opportunities are limited, and restricted to the public area on the east shore.  <br> \n <br> \nMaximum depth of the lake is 45 feet and water clarity in late July was 1.2 feet.   Also at that time, the lake was strongly stratified with poor (<2 ppm) dissolved oxygen below 8 feet.  A population assessment was conducted during July 2014 to determine the species composition and abundance of game fish in the lake. <br> \n <br> \nIn 2014, Northern Pike abundance (2.3/gill net) was relatively low compared to other similar lakes in the state.  However, typical of lakes with low Northern Pike density, mean size was larger than average.  Pike averaged 4.9 lbs and 27.9 inches and ranged from 18.1 to 33.6 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nThe panfish community appeared healthy as Bluegill and Black Crappie abundance was about average and size was relatively large when compared to other similar lakes.  The Bluegill catch of 28.9/trap net was more than the 2009 catch of 15.4/net.  In 2014, mean Bluegill size was 7 inches and 0.27 lbs.   Black Crappie were netted at a rate of 7.1/ trap net and size structure was relatively good.  Crappie averaged 8.8 inches and 0.37 lbs, with the largest measuring 10.3 inches. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch have never been abundant in Dutch Lake and have always been sampled at a rate well below average.  In 2014, seven fish were collected at a rate of 1.2/gill net.  These fish were above average in size at 7.6 inches and 0.19 lbs; the largest measured 8.3 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nPassive sampling gear, such as trap and gill nets, are not effective methods for collecting Largemouth Bass, so the numbers from the 2014 assessment are not necessarily representative of the population present.  Electrofishing is the typical method for Largemouth Bass assessments but was not conducted.  Despite this, 8 Largemouth Bass were sampled in the trap nets, considered high for that gear type.  Sampled fish ranged from 15.0 to 20.7 inches, averaging 17.3 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled in low abundance were Black Bullhead, Bowfin (Dogfish), Common Carp, hybrid sunfish, Pumpkinseed, and Yellow Bullhead. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Dutch Lake, a 159-acre lake located in the city of Mound in western Hennepin County, is a class 24 lake subject to periodic winterkills.  The lake was sampled in June 1997 to evaluate the fish community after a probable winterkill.  The sport fish community consists of black crappie, bluegill, largemouth bass, northern pike, pumpkinseed sunfish, walleye, and yellow perch. Northern pike and largemouth bass are the dominant sport fish in Dutch Lake.  Exhibiting good size structure and numbers, the pike population averaged approximately 24 inches and 3.2 pounds.  Thirty-five percent of sampled pike were over 25 inches and 8% were greater than 30 inches.  Although gill and trap nets do not effectively sample largemouth bass, nine bass averaging approximately 12.0 inches and 1.4 pounds were sampled during this survey.  Of the nine bass caught, 44% were above 15.0 inches.  The largest bass was approximately 18.0 inches in length.  Additionally, sampled bass ranged from 1 to 9 years old. Dutch Lake supports a healthy panfish population consisting of bluegills and black crappies.  Forty-two percent of sampled bluegill exceeded 7.0 inches while approximately 35% of the crappies sampled were above 8.0 inches. A strong 1997 year class (age 6) of bluegill comprised approximately 63% of sampled population.  Three crappies sampled were approximately 10.0 inches in length.  Seventy-two percent of sampled crappies were between one and four years old.  If allowed to mature, these fish could recruit into the fishery and provide anglers with consistent fishing in upcoming years.  Yellow perch, pumpkinseed sunfish, and hybrid sunfish are also present in limited numbers.  Twenty-four perch averaging 6.5 inches were sampled by gill nets.  Four hybrid sunfish averaging 7.0 inches and 0.3 pounds and two pumpkinseed sunfish averaging 5.9 inches and 0.2 pounds were additionally sampled in trap nets.  One pumpkinseed sunfish was slightly above 7.0 inches. Three species of bullheads were present in varying numbers.  Black bullheads and yellow bullheads comprised approximately 41% of all fish caught in gill nets.  Additionally, four brown bullheads were sampled in both gill nets and trap nets.  All bullhead species averaged over 10.0 inches in length.  Two common carp averaging 25.8 inches and 7.7 pounds were sampled in gill nets while four bowfin (dogfish) were sampled using trap nets.  The bowfin averaged 20.7 inches and 3.1 pounds.  </p>",

Over 46% of the BLG sampled were 7.0 inches or longer and average werght was just under a 1/4 pound per fish. Approximately 1/4 of the black crappies captured were 8.0\" or more. Relative abundance of bluegill and black crappie appear to be down form the 1991 assessment. Northern pike abundance has remained stable since 1991 and the average size collected was 23.4 inches long and 2.7 pounds each. Largemouth bass, while not targeted in this survey, appeared in the net sample at above average levels. The largest individual captured measured almost 17\" in length. Anglers report that bass up to 20 inches present and that action is quite good at times. Pumpkinseed sunfish and yellow perch are also present but in relatively low abundance.</p>",

NOP EXHIBITED AN ABOVE AVERAGE GROWTH RATE, BUT WERE SAMPLED BELOW MEDIAN LEVELS FOR GILL NETS AND WERE NOT SAMPLED WITH TRAP NETS.  YEP WERE ALSO SAMPLED BELOW MEDIAN LEVELS FOR GILL NETS.  BLGS WERE SAMPLED WELL ABOVE MEDIAN LEVELS FOR NUMBER AND WEIGHT PER SET USING TRAP AND GILL NETS.  A SUBSTANTIAL INCREASE IN THE BLG POPULATION IS INDICATED WHEN COMPARING CURRENT SAMPLING DATA TO THAT FROM PREVIOUS SURVEY YEARS.  BLGS CAPTURED USING TRAP NETS WERE DETERMINED TO HAVE A PSD OF 78.86 PERCENT.  LMB WERE SAMPLED NEAR MEDIAN LEVELS AND GROWTH RATE APPEARS TO BE SLIGHTLY ABOVE AVERAGE.  LMB YOY WERE CAPTURED AT EACH OF THE FOUR SEINING STATIONS.  BLC WERE PRESENT ABOVE MEDIAN LEVELS FOR GILL NETS, BUT BELOW LOCAL MEDIANS FOR TRAP NETS.  BLB ALSO EXHIBITED A SIMILAR SAMPLING RESULT.  YEB WERE SAMPLED ABOVE MEDIAN LEVELS, WHILE BRB WERE CAPTURED BELOW MEDIAN LEVELS.  ALL THREE BLH SPECIES EXHIBITED AN AVERAGE SIZE OF ABOUT 1/2 POUND PER INDIVIDUAL. CARP WERE SAMPLED BELOW MEDIAN LEVELS AND THE MAJORITY OF THE FISH APPEAR TO BE FROM A RELATIVELY YOUNG YEAR CLASS.  GOS WERE SAMPLED ABOVE MEDIAN LEVELS AND AVERAGED 7 INCHES IN LENGTH (RANGE 6.0-7.9 INCHES).  AFTER THE WINTERKILL OF 1991-1992, A SIMILAR FISH POPULATION CAN BE EXPECTED IN THE 1996 LAKE SURVEY.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Dutch is a 160-acre lake located in the city of Mound in western Hennepin County.  A public boat launch is located on the east side.  A population assessment was conducted during July 2009 to determine the species composition and abundance of game fish in the lake. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie abundance in gill nets (18.3/net) was the highest on record and trap net catch (14.2/net) was highest since 1981 (7 assessments).  Of all measured black crappie, 23% were 8 inches or longer and 1% were 10 inches or longer.  Average size was 6.0 inches and 0.21 pounds, with the largest measuring 10.0 inches and 0.51 lbs.  Consistent recruitment was evident as 95% of fish were relatively evenly distributed between ages 1 through 4, and 5% were age 5.  Growth was similar to other black crappie populations in the West Metro Area, where crappie were 6.6 inches at age 3.      <br> \n <br> \nBluegill abundance in trap nets (15.4/net) was moderately low compared to other similar lakes in the state.  Twenty-seven percent were 6 inches or longer and 3.6% were 8 inches or longer.  Mean size was 5.8 inches and 0.12 lbs, with the largest bluegill coming from a gill net at 8.6 inches and 0.50 lbs.  Ages 1 through 8 were equally represented, except 36% were age 2.  Bluegill growth was faster than average compared to other similar lakes in the West Metro Area, fish were 4.7 inches at age-3. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike relative abundance (3.3/gill net) was near the median compared to similar lakes in the state.  Sixty-seven percent of pike were 21 inches or longer and 14% were 28 inches or longer.  The average size was 23.6 inches and 3.26 lbs, with the largest measuring 34.6 inches and 8.86 lbs.  Ages 2 through 7 were represented in the sample, however 57% were age 2 or 3.  Growth was slow for the first 3 years, and then increased as the fish got older.  The average pike was 18.0 inches by age 3.       <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch have not been abundant in the previous 4 assessments (mean, 1.7/gill net).  Similarly, in the 2009 assessment gill net catch averaged 3.5/net, which is moderately low compared with other similar lakes in the state.  The mean size (weight) of yellow perch was average compared with other class 24 lakes in the state.  Mean size was 7.1 inches and 0.14 lbs, with the largest measuring 8.2 inches and 0.22 lbs.  Twelve percent were 8 inches or greater. Growth of yellow perch was slower than average compared to other similar lakes in the West Metro Area, fish were 5.7 inches at age-3. <br> \n <br> \nFourteen largemouth bass were collected during the assessment, however, passive sampling gears, such as trap nets and gill nets, are not effective methods for collecting largemouth bass, so the data presented for this species is not indicative of relative abundance.  Electrofishing is the typical method for largemouth bass assessments but was not conducted during this survey.  Mean size was 13 inches and1.66 lbs with the largest reaching 18.8 inches and 3.51 lbs.  Fifty-seven percent were 12 inches and greater and 35% were 15 inches and greater.  <br> \n <br> \nOther species collected in low abundance were black bullhead, yellow bullhead, channel catfish, golden shiner, bowfin, pumpkinseed, white sucker, and hybrid sunfish. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Dutch Lake is a 172-acre lake with a maximum depth of 45 feet. Dutch is located north of the City of Mound, in southwest Hennepin County. Public access is provided by a city-owned boat ramp located on the southeast side of the lake. Dutch is primarily managed for Northern Pike, but includes catchable populations of Largemouth Bass, Bluegill, and Black Crappie. DNR stocking of fish is limited to post-winterkill reintroductions. A Standard Survey (gill nets, trap nets, and spring electrofishing) was conducted on Dutch Lake during the week of 7/22/2019. During the survey, water clarity was poor with 2 feet of visibility, with low oxygen below 10 feet. Eurasian Watermilfoil was found in Dutch Lake in 2016 and remains present. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike were sampled at moderate numbers (5.0/net), compared to similar lakes in the area. Average size of Northern Pike was 24.4 inches, with the largest measured at 31.9 inches. While a majority of pike fall within the protective slot (22-26 inches), plenty of harvest opportunity is available for anglers that wish to fill their 10 fish limit outside of the protected slot, with not more than 2 of those 10 fish over 26 inches. Northern Pike in Dutch Lake continue to grow fast and maintain a balanced population. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass were sampled during spring 2019 with nighttime boat electrofishing, the first time such a survey was conducted here. Catch rates were high, with 64.5 fish/hour. Largemouth Bass averaged 9.6 inches with the largest measured at 19.9 inches. High numbers of bass in Dutch Lake is likely limiting growth potential with less than 4% of sampled fish greater than 15 inches. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill were sampled at moderate numbers (37.9/net), compared to similar lakes in the area. There were 265 Bluegill sampled in trap nets during the 2019 survey, with an average length of 7.2 inches, and the largest measured at 8.4 inches. Despite few fish (6%) greater than 8 inches, the majority of sampled Bluegill (68%) were greater than 7 inches, providing excellent angling opportunity. <br> \n <br> \nRecord numbers of Black Crappie were sampled with gill nets (29.3/net) and trap nets (21.9/net). The 2019 catch rates were the highest recorded on Dutch Lake in the previous 25 years. There were 326 Black Crappie sampled during the survey, with an average length of 8.7 inches with the largest measured at 10.3 inches. Despite high numbers, a vast majority (93%) of the population is composed of catchable sized (8+ inches) individuals, despite few fish (1%) being greater than 10 inches. <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species sampled in low abundances were Black Bullhead, Brown Bullhead, Common Carp, Golden Shiner, Pumpkinseed, Yellow Bullhead, and Yellow Perch. <br> \n</p>",
