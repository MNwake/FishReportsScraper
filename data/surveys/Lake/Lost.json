Northern pike were sampled in above average numbers and size for the lake class.  The northern pike average size was 2.6 pounds (23 inches); the largest northern pike was 34.8 inches.   <br> \nYellow perch numbers were about average for this type of lake although they were small, averaging 6.5 inches; no fish over 7 inches were collected. <br> \n   <br> \nLost Lake has a northern pike population sustained by a yellow perch/white sucker forage base.  While numbers of large northern pike are unlikely, it is possible to catch enough for a meal and have a chance for the rare trophy fish.      <br> \n</p>",

Fish up to 29.8 inches (6.3 pounds) were sampled and a few northern pike in the 2 to 2.5 pound range were captured; however, most of the fish were smaller than 2 pounds.A very low number of yellow perch were captured and these fish were small, ranging in size from 5.0 to 7.1 inches.Lost Lake is on the motorized Timber Frear Loop which is made up of seven lakes that are connected through a series of portages.  While motors are allowed in this area, the difficult accesses to these lakes make canoe use the preferred mode of transportation.</p>",
