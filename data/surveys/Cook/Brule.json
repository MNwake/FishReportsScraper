The walleye population was entirely self-sustained; Brule Lake has not been stocked since 1985.  The northern pike catch was high for this lake, probably because of the production of a strong year class in 1994.  Most of the northern pike taken were two-year-old fish under 23 inches in length.  Northern pike growth had been fast, probably because of the abundance of northern cisco.  A few smallmouth bass were taken, and there appeared to have been some larger fish present.  Smallmouth bass growth had been fast, compared to other area lakes.  No lake trout were collected, and conditions for lake trout appeared to have been marginal.  Forage for gamefish was provided mainly by northern cisco - yellow perch abundance appeared to have been low, as usual for this lake.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Brule Lake has long been known as one of the best BWCAW walleye lakes in Cook County.  The 2009 catch was about average for the lake, historically, as was the size of the fish taken.  The walleye population was entirely self-sustained, since the lake had not been stocked since 1985.  Growth of young walleye had been slow, most likely because of low numbers of yellow perch in this lake.  Larger walleye would have been able to feed on the abundant northern cisco present. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike were relatively abundant in 2009, but fish taken in the assessment were below average in size.   Brule Lake provides the cool water and cisco forage base needed to produce large northern pike, and it is likely that larger fish were present.  Most of the northern pike taken in 2009 were two-year-old fish from a strong 2007 year class.  Growth rates for young northern pike had been somewhat faster than average. <br> \n <br> \nThe 2009 assessment yielded one of the higher smallmouth bass catches seen in this lake historically, although the catch was below the median for the lake class.  Smallmouth bass collected tended to be large, and growth had been fast.  Five-year-old fish reached an average length of 13.9 inches at the end of their fifth year, compared to an average of 11.5 inches for other lakes in Cook County. <br> \n <br> \nBrule Lake does not support any panfish.  Northern cisco were abundant and large in 2009, and would provide some angling opportunity for those with the right gear.  Brule Lake is also open to netting for cisco for a period each fall.  All anglers (and netters) on Brule Lake must abide by BWCAW regulations at all times; the lake is entirely non-motorized. <br> \n</p>",

Based on the profile, the top of the thermocline (i.e., the location in the water column with the sharpest transition from warm to cold water) occurred at approximately 23 feet. Dissolved oxygen decreased to below 3.0 mg/L at 60.4 feet, which was below the thermocline, at the time of sampling. The temperature at which dissolved oxygen decreased to below 3.0 mg/L (i.e., TDO3, a single variable to characterize oxythermal habitat) was 8.8?C (47.8?F). <br> \n <br> \nTDO3 values cooler than 21.5?C indicate that oxythermal conditions are favorable for Cisco. Dissolved oxygen concentrations below the thermocline indicate that suitable oxythermal habitat for Cisco was available across a range of depths at the time of sampling during the summer of 2023. Data collected in 1977 and 1983 also indicated suitable oxythermal habitat. When adequate oxythermal habitat is available, Cisco are not squeezed into unfavorable, warmer water conditions and therefore do not experience higher levels of stress. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Brule Lake lies within the Lake Superior North watershed, and is the headwaters for the Temperance and the Brule Rivers.  The lake is entirely inside the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness, and no motorized use is allowed anywhere on its waters.  Primary and secondary management species in Brule Lake are walleye and northern pike.  Long range goals for walleye are to maintain a minimum gill net catch of 3.0 fish/set, with some fish over 25 inches present.  For northern pike long range goals are a minimum gill net catch of 0.5 fish/set, with some fish over 25 inches present.  The 2019 survey was the second of two scheduled in the 2008 lake management plan to update information on water quality, habitat, and the fish community in the lake, and to monitor the lake for any introduction of exotic species.  The first of those surveys was completed in 2009.  Based on these surveys, the management plan for this lake will be revised in December 2020; comments on the lake's management are welcomed at any time before that date. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye were fairly abundant in 2019, and their average size was better than average for this lake historically.  The gill net catch in 2019 was within the normal range for the lake class, and was about average for Brule Lake.  The catch met the long range goal for walleye in terms of numbers of fish, but failed to meet the size goal (no fish over 25 inches were taken).  Similar results had been seen in the last (2009) survey.  Twelve year classes, all produced naturally, contributed to the 2019 catch, including a strong year class in 2012 and moderately strong year classes in 2016 and 2017.  The 2005 year class, reported in the 2009 survey as exceptionally strong, continued to contribute to the walleye population in 2019.  Growth of walleye collected in 2019 had been somewhat below average; fish reached a mean length of 17.7 inches at the end of their seventh year of growth, compared to an area mean of 19.7 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nSlow growth among walleye may have been related to low yellow perch abundance.  Yellow perch catches have typically been low in this lake, and the 2019 catch was no exception, falling below the normal range for this type of lake.  Catches of zero yellow perch have been common in this lake; none were taken in gill nets in the four assessments done between 1979 and 1996. Very few small yellow perch were taken in quarter-inch trap nets in 2019 - a further indication that the yellow perch forage base was limited.   Very few minnows or other small fish species were taken in quarter-inch trap nets in 2009 and 2019, suggesting that diversity of the Brule Lake nearshore fish community may have been low, even for a lake in this area, and that nearshore forage fish were scarce. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike were low in numbers in 2019, and all of the fish taken were young and small.  The 2019 northern pike gill net catch met the current long range goal, in terms of numbers of fish, but failed to meet the size goal (no fish over 25 inches).  The catch was similar to most seen historically in this lake, although well below catches seen in 1996 and 2009.  Only two year classes contributed to the 2019 catch, with no fish older than three years taken.  Growth of young northern pike had been about average for this area; they reached a mean length of 14.9 inches at lthe end of their second year, compared to an area mean of 15.3 inches.  Brule Lake provides the cool water and the cisco forage base needed to produce large northern pike, but mean weights for the species have typically been low compared to other area lakes with similar conditions.  Given the lake's large size, and limited angler use (due to motor restrictions), it is unlikely that harvest has limited the lake's ability to produce larger fish.   <br> \n <br> \nThe 2019 survey yielded one of the higher smallmouth bass catches seen in this lake historically, although the catch remained about average for a lake of this type.  Smallmouth bass taken in 2019 tended to be large, with a mean weight that was above the normal range for the lake class.  <br> \n <br> \nThe cisco gill net catch in 2019 was about average for the lake, historically, and appeared to show no signs of decline.  Based on the length frequency distribution, it appeared that at least two, and possibly three, strong year classes contributed to the 2019 catch.  Past surveys have shown that older walleye in this lake feed heavily on cisco, while younger fish rely more on perch and invertebrates. <br> \n <br> \nNo new fish species were found in Brule Lake in 2019.  The lake is not known to be infested with any exotic species.</p>",
