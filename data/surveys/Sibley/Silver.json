                "narrative": "<p>Silver Lake is a shallow, turbid basin with very little submersed aquatic vegetation.  Silver Lake can be characterizedas having low winter dissolved oxygen concentrations and potential for frequent winterkill.  Fish populations arelimited by low dissolved oxygen concentrations.  A pump and baffle type aerator system is in place and operated by theSilver Lake Sportsmen Club.  The effectiveness of the aerator system in preventing or reducing winterkill is unknown.A fisheries assessment was conducted in 1994 and fish species of particular interest included black bullhead, blackcrappie and walleye.  Black bullhead were abundant with trapnet catches nearly three times the lake class average, but still within the normalrange.  Black bullhead sampled ranged in length from 6.9 to 9.5 inches with an average length of 7.8 inches. A black crappie trapnet catch of 16.6 per net was more than three times the lake class average, but still within thenormal range.  Several age classes of black crappie were present, but age two fish accounted for most of the catch. Growth was good and average length of age two black crappie was 10.0 inches.  Black crappie ranged in length from 3.7 to11.6 inches with an average length of 9.7 inches.  The present size structure of black crappie should be very desirableto anglers.Thirty-three walleye were captured in trapnets for a catch rate of 2.8 per net.  This is in the normal range for thislake class.  All walleye sampled were age three, with an average length of 16.3 inches.  Though age three walleyecorrespond to a year when walleye fingerlings were stocked, it is uncertain to what extent they contributed.  Naturalreproduction could account for all or none of the age three walleye sampled.  Walleye fingerling were also stocked in1992, but no fish of that age class were sampled.Only one yellow perch was sampled in trapnets during the survey for a catch rate of 0.1 per net.  This catch is belownormal for this lake class.  However, no gillnets were used and perch numbers may be higher than indicated by trapnetcatches.  Local reports during the winter ice-fishing season indicate that some large yellow perch are being caught byanglers.  Fishing pressure is believed to be light to non-existent on Silver Lake most years.  However, observations this winter(94-95) season indicate there is at least moderate angling pressure and fair luck for black crappie, walleye and yellowperch.  </p>",

No walleyes were sampled from the 1986 fry stocking (1.4 million stocked).  The aeration system was utilized this past winter, but low water levels rendered the aeration system useless.  By March, 1989, most of the lake had frozen to the bottom.  Where there was water, the dissolved oxygen was low (0.8 ppm).  Therefore, the present fish community has been highly influenced by winterkill and low water levels.\n</p>",

Bluegill, white crappie, black crappie, yellow perch and walleye were the gamefish species sampled in the trapnets.  Silver Lake is a turbid lake with little submerged vegetation and is not well suited to bluegill and largemouth bass.  Only three bluegill were taken in the trapnets for a catch of 0.3/net.  This was below the normal range for the lake class.  The bluegill captured were age 4 and 5 fish and growth was good.  Three white crappie were captured in the trapnets also, for a catch of 0.3/net.  This was within the normal range for the lake class.  All were age three fish and ranged in size from 8.5 to 10.4 inches.  Black crappie were the only abundant gamefish species.  A black crappie catch of 45/net was above the normal range for this type of lake.  Nearly 85% of the black crappie were age 3 and ranged in length from 8 to 10.9 inches.  Black crappie adults from Little Mud Lake were stocked in 1991 and probably account for the presence of these fish.  It appears these fish spawned successfully, and the remaining fish were age 1 and were 4 to 6.4 inches long.  However, natural reproduction checks done in late summer did not show any young of the year black crappie this year.  If aeration reduces winterkill frequency or severity, black crappie may provide a successful fishery.  Yellow perch and walleye catches of 0.3 and 0.1/net, respectively, were below the normal range for the lake class.  Two adult walleye were captured during natural reproduction test conducted in early September.  Black bullhead abundance was high, with a catch of 307/net.  This was well above the normal range for this type of lake.  Average size of the black bullhead was low.  Over 60% were less than 5 inches long and only 5% were larger than 9 inches.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Silver Lake in Sibley County has a surface area of about 680 acres.  This lake is very shallow and highly turbid.  The water clarity in mid-summer is generally less than 2 feet.  Because the lake is so shallow, it tends to have frequent winterkill due to low oxygen.  A pump and baffle aeration system has been installed to help prevent winterkill from occuring.  The frequency of winterkill, with the aeration system in operation, will be monitored to determine whether fish management is the best alternative for this lake.       In 1993 personnel from the Hutchinson Area Fisheries Headquarters used trapnets and seines to assess the current fish population in Silver Lake.  Fish species sampled in this survey included black crappie, walleye, black bullhead, yellow perch, white sucker and green sunfish.       Black crappie were the most abundant gamefish sampled in trapnets.  The catch rate of 93 per trapnet was well above average for lakes of this type.  The average size (8.5 inches) of black crappie was also better than average.  Black crappie ranged in length from 7.3 to 11.5 inches, with an average weight of 0.4 pounds.  Black crappie were last stocked in 1991 and it appears that the fish sampled in this survey are the result of natural reproduction.  With adequate reproduction this species should be able to maintain their population without additional stocking.       Walleye were the only other gamefish that was sampled in any significant number.  The trapnet catch rate of 3.9 per net was also well above average for lakes similar to Silver Lake.  The walleye population is maintain solely by the stocking of fingerling and fry.  Little, if any, natural reproduction of walleye occurs in this lake.  The average length of walleye sampled in this survey was 12.5 inches and ranged from 9 to 17 inches.     Black bullhead are very abundant in Silver Lake.  Trapnet catches averaged 227 black bullhead per net which is above the average of about 60 per net.  Black bullhead averaged 6.3 inches in length and ranged from 3 to 11 inches.  The average weight of black bullhead was low at slightly over a tenth of a pound per fish.</p>",

The lake was too turbid to observe dead fish on the bottom.  Trap nets were set on April 8, 2019, to document fish species presence and fish abundances at Silver Lake, following the winterkill.  Trap net catches were as follows: <br> \n <br> \nTrap nets caught high numbers (1,815) of Black Bullhead (3.4 to 13.3 inches long), low numbers (8) of Black Crappie (3.4 to 9.4 inches long - only 2 over 5\" in length), and high numbers (782) of Common Carp (4.8 to 18.5 inches long).  Walleye were not sampled. <br> \n <br> \nNet catches indicated a lake dominated by Black Bullhead and Common Carp.  The 2019 winterkill was likely not severe. Silver Lake is primarily managed for Walleye, as a boom and bust type fishery.  Netting likely indicated that there was currently little fishing opportunity available at Silver Lake, except for a small number of 9 inch Black Crappie and a few larger Bullhead, although one day netting assessment results can miss fish species and underestimate fish abundances.  Future Walleye stocking will resume on an every other year basis or following winterkill.</p>",
