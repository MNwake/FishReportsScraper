There are 9 designated USFS campsites located around the lake for overnight use. Gabbro is a popular lake for anglers and wilderness enthusiasts. <br> \n <br> \nEight species of fish were sampled during the 2016 lake survey of Gabbro Lake. Walleye were sampled in numbers slightly above average and northern pike abundance appears to be at a historical low. Black crappie are likely more common than the gill net results indicate. Smallmouth bass were sampled for the first time in 2016 with one individual sampled. Cisco are present in above average numbers in Gabbro Lake compared to other similar area lakes. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye numbers in 2016 (7.3/gill net) were slightly higher than the historical average (6.8/gill net) for Gabbro Lake. The average walleye sampled was 12.0 inches and about 5 years old, indicating slow growth rates. Sixty-one percent of the walleye sampled were 4 years old. The largest walleye sampled in 2016 was 19.8 inches. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike numbers in 2016 (0.5/gill net) were lower than the historical average of 2.2/gill net. The average pike sampled was 26.8 inches which is larger than the historical average length of 23.5 inches. The largest pike sampled in 2016 was 35 inches. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",
