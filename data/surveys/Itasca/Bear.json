                "narrative": "<p>Bear Lake is a 339-acre lake located 15 miles north of Nashwauk, MN.  The lake has a public access at the DNR Forestry administered campground on the north shore.  Primary fish species include walleye, northern pike, and black crappie.   The lake is very shallow with a maximum depth of 16 ft, has bog-stained water, and a small dam on the outlet controls water levels.  Walleye gill net catch rate decreased from past assessments to 2.8/gill net and was similar to the expected range for similar lakes.  Catch rates in the last three assessments have varied from 1.7 to 7.0/gill net.  Six-year classes were determined from scale analysis.  The 2002-year class was an especially strong natural year class and represented 52% of the walleye sampled.  Walleye fry are currently stocked every three years and 32% of fish sampled corresponded to stocked year classes.  Natural reproduction is strong and provides a modest walleye fishery.  Size structure was good with a variety of sizes available to anglers.  Growth was excellent and exceeded the statewide average by 15% for some ages with fish averaging 20 inches by age five.  Gill net catch rate for black crappie was 3.9/gill net and was within the expected range for similar lakes.  Catch rates in the last two assessments varied from 0.8 to 1.3/gill net.  Size structure was good with fish up to 12 inches sampled, however, most of the fish sampled were between six and seven inches.  Growth was slower than the statewide average for the first two years steadily increasing to exceed the statewide average by 15% after age five.  Black crappie averaged 12 inches by age six.  The northern pike catch rate was 6.3/gill net, which was within the expected range for similar lakes.  Catch rates in the past two assessments were 4.1 and 4.2/gill net.  Size structure was poor with few fish over 28 inches.  No scales were collected for age and growth analysis in this assessment.  Bluegill trap net catch rate was 5.5/net and was similar to the lake class average.  Catch rates have historically been low compared to area lakes and have varied from 6.8 to 8.2/trap net.  Size structure was poor with few fish greater than 8 inches.  Growth was similar to the lake class average with fish averaging 6 inches by age five.  Yellow perch gill net catch was 18.8/net, which was similar to the lake class average of 19.2/net.  Catch rates in the last two assessments have varied from 12.3 to 32.2/gill net.  Size structure was poor with few fish greater than 9 inches.  Other species sampled include rock bass, white sucker, golden shiner, and pumpkinseed sunfish.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Bear Lake is in ecological lake classification #39.  Lakes in this class are small (150-200), shallow (maximum depth-15') and have moderate phosphorus fertility.This test netting indicated little change in the fish population since the last assessment in 1986, except that higher numbers of walleyes and a decrease in black crappies were observed.The walleye population, as represented by the gill net catch, has shown an increase from 1.7 in 1986 to 6.3 in this assessment, above the lake class median of 2.1 and the third quartile of 5.0.  Walleye stocking has occurred annually from 1984-89 making evaluation of natural reproduction difficult.  The strong 1988 year class, which makes up 56% of the sample, was a year of fry stocking.  Past surveys have indicated excellent natural reproduction, however.  Mean total length of age III walleye was 10.3\"(N=22), slower than the statewide average of 12.3\". The age IV walleye in the sample, however, showed faster growth than the state average of 15.1 at 17.4 (N=6).Northern pike abundance has historically been at relatively low levels.  This assessment sampled 4.2 fish/gillnet, below the lake class median of 7.21 and within the first and third quartile range of 5.0-11.75.  Spawning area for this species although not abundant is adequate.  Growth rates are at or slightly above the statewide average for those year classes where a good sample size was obtained.Yellow perch remain at very good levels, as they have in the past.  A gill net catch of 32.2 in this assessment is at the third quartile for this lake class.The fish community, as described above, is predominantly composed of the two predators, walleye and northern pike, and the main prey species, is yellow perch.  Bluegill and black crappie are the two centrarchid species that are an important part of this community.  Bluegill were not observed in any assessment until 1976.  Today their numbers (8.2 fish/gillnet) are below the lake class median of 12.2.  Although their numbers have never been high, the PSD of 81 indicates quality fish in this sample.</p>",

A survey targeting nearshore fish species was conducted by Area staff on 17 July, 2018.  Ten sampling sites (100 feet long) were evenly spaced around the lake shore, sampling a variety of habitat types.  Each site is sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-ft or 15-ft 1/8th inch mesh seine, depending on habitat condition. <br> \n <br> \nShoreline seining was conducted at 10 sites; using the 50-ft seine at 7 sites and the 15-ft seine at three.  Backpack electrofishing was completed at all 10 sites.  Nearshore sampling captured a total of 12 different species; 11 species by seining and nine species by backpack electrofishing.  The species can be found in the gear-specific catch tables in this report. <br> \n <br> \nNearshore catches will be used with the gill net and trap net data from the standard survey conducted on 25 June, 2018, to calculate a fish-based Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) score which is indicative of lake health.  The surveys will assist the watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Bear Lake is a 339-acre lake located 20 miles north of Nashwauk, MN in the Little Fork River watershed.  The lake has a public access at the DNR State Forest campground on the north shore.  The lake management plan lists walleye as the primary management species, with bluegill and black crappie as secondary species.  Bear Lake is in ecological lake class 39.  Lakes in this classification are small to moderate in size, have a high percentage of littoral area and stained water.  Other area lakes in this class include Battle, Otter and Upper Panasa Lakes. <br> \n <br> \nThe walleye gill-net catch was similar to the lake class average and the previous assessment at 2.6/net.  Size structure was modest with no fish over 20 inches in the sample.  Gill-net sampled walleye ranged from 11.1 to 19.8 inches with a mean length of 16.1 inches.  Large walleye have seldom been sampled in any assessments.  Ages 2-4, 6 and 9 were identified from scales samples, with 91% of fish corresponding to years of fry stocking.  Growth was similar to the statewide average with fish reaching 16.1 inches at age 5. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie were sampled within the expected range at 3.6/gill net.  Catch rates in the two previous assessments ranged from 0.8 to 3.9/net.  Size structure was poor, with the sample primarily made up of age-2 fish.  Gill-net sampled crappie ranged from 4.4 to 12.2 inches with a mean length 6.2 inches.  Recruitment appeared inconsistent, with ages 2, 6, 8 and 9 identified from scale samples.  Growth was similar to the statewide average with crappie averaging 8.1 inches at age 4. <br> \n <br> \nThe trap-net catch rate for bluegill was 6.0/net, similar to the lake class median and the previous assessment.  Size structure was moderate; sampled bluegill ranged from 3.2 to 9.1 inches with a mean length of 6.7 inches.  Ages 2 and 4-9 were represented in the sample.  Growth was slower than the lake class average with fish averaging 6.3 inches at age 6. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike were sampled below the expected range at 1.0/gill net.  Catches in previous assessments have varied from 1.0 to 7.0/net, staying below the lake class median in all but one survey.  Size structure was poor with only one pike over 20 inches in the gill-net sample.  Several pike over 30 inches were sampled in the trap nets however.   <br> \n <br> \nThe gill-net catch for yellow perch was within the expected range at 10.8/net.  Catches in the two previous assessments were 12.3 and 18.8/net.  Size structure was relatively poor as only 34% of the sampled perch exceeded 8 inches.  Yellow perch ranged from 5.3 to 11.2 inches with a mean length of 7.5 inches.  Recruitment appeared consistent with ages 2-9 identified from scale samples.  Growth was similar to the statewide average with perch averaging 8.1 inches at age 5. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled in test nets included pumpkinseed sunfish and white sucker.  Additional sampling with small-mesh seines, back-pack electrofishing and boat electrofishing was conducted as part of a statewide IBI (Index of Biotic Integrity) study.  These additional gears often sample fish species not normally captured with traditional test nets.  Species encountered with IBI sampling included Iowa darter, Johnny darter, golden shiner, rock bass and largemouth bass.      <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Bear Lake is managed primarily for walleye and panfish.  Walleye fingerlings and fry have been periodically stocked.  Walleye catch rates sampled in gill nets (7.0/set) exceeded the expected range for lakes of this type.  Sampled walleye had a mean length of 13.2 inches, and ranged from 7.3 to 20.4 inches.  The mean weight was 0.8 pounds.  Walleye growth rates were near the statewide average.  Some of the walleyes sampled were from non-stocked years, indicating that natural reproduction is taking place in the lake.     Panfish production is typical for this lake type.  Black crappie and bluegill were sampled in trap nets.  The black crappie catch rate (6.0/set) was within the expected range, as was the bluegill catch rate (6.8/set).  Black crappies ranged in length from 5.2 to 13.7, with a mean length of 8.8 inches.  Bluegills ranged in length from 4.0-9.9 inches, with a mean of 7.7 inches. Black crappie and bluegill growth rates were near the expected growth rates.    Northern pike were sampled in gill nets at a rate that was below the expected range.  The mean length was 19.4 inches, with a range in length from 15.8 to 31.5 inches.  Northern pike growth rates were above the statewide mean for ages one and two, and near the statewide mean for the remaining ages.  Although the catch rate remained constant, the mean weight (6.7 pounds/set) decreased from 1987 (15.1 pounds/set) and 1991 (11 pounds/set).     Yellow perch were sampled in gill nets at a rate within the expected range.  The mean length of sampled yellow perch was 7.9 inches, and ranged in length from 5.3 to 10.8 inches.  Growth rates exceed (>115%) the state mean for ages 1-4, and are near the mean for other ages.     Much of Bear Lake is shallow and aquatic plants are abundant.  Lakeshore owners can decrease the nutrients entering the lake by minimizing fertilizer use and leaving a \"buffer\" of terrestrial vegetation adjacent to the shore.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Bear Lake is a 328-acre lake located 21 miles north of Nashwauk, MN.  A cement public access is located off West Bear Lake Forest Rd (County Road 552) on the north shore with parking for seven vehicles and trailers.  A state campground is present at the north end of the lake with swimming beach.  The lake has a maximum depth of 16 feet and 82% of the lake is 15 feet or less.  The lake has moderately soft water and good fertility.  Water transparency is low with visibility to 3.5 feet due to bog stain.  The depth of water at which oxygen levels limit fish presence varies between 11 and 14 feet in mid-summer.  The Bear River enters the lake in the south end and exits in the north, ultimately flowing into the Sturgeon River.  Other lakes with similar habitat in the Grand Rapids area include Battle, Otter, and Upper Panasa.  <br> \n <br> \nThe 2018 survey was the tenth survey of the fish community since 1951.  This survey was conducted to monitor the fish community for changes in species composition, abundance, size structure and growth.  The gamefish species that are best suited for the lake are Bluegill, Black Crappie, Northern Pike, and Walleye.  No special regulations are present.  The 2013 management plan indicated Walleye were a primary management species due to the species being actively managed through stocking.  Black Crappie and Largemouth Bass were listed as secondary management species due to angler interest.   <br> \n <br> \nThe Walleye population had low catch rates, average size distribution, and average growth.  The gill net catch was the second lowest observed for the lake and was lower than average for lakes with similar habitat.  Lower Yellow Perch numbers have the potential to reduce Walleye survival and growth.  Lengths ranged from 10 to 28 inches, with an average of 17 inches.  The proportions of Walleye sampled that were greater than 15, 20, and 25 inches were above average when compared to previous surveys.  Walleye were aged from 3 to 16 years old.  Growth was above the statewide average through age-3 and below the statewide average thereafter, resulting in Walleye taking 4 years to average 15 inches. <br> \n <br> \nThe Bluegill population had moderate catch rates, good size distribution and average growth.  The trap net catch was the highest observed for the lake and was higher than average for lakes with similar habitat.  However, the population is still moderate in density.  Lower Bluegill catches are often desirable, as growth is slow and size quality is poor if populations become overly abundant.  Lengths ranged from 3 to 10 inches, with an average of 7 inches.  The proportions of Bluegill sampled that were greater than 6 and 8 inches were above average.  Bluegill were aged from 3 to 13 years old.  Growth was similar to the statewide average, resulting in Bluegill taking 6 years to average 6 inches.  Due to the lake's small size it is recommended that anglers release fish over 8 inches <br> \n <br> \nThe Black Crappie population had lower catch rates, good size distribution and average growth.  Trap net and gill net catches were higher and average when compared with past surveys, while catches from both gears were higher than those from lakes with similar habitat.  Lengths ranged from 4 to 11 inches, with an average of 7.6 inches.  The proportions of crappie sampled that were greater than 8 and 10 inches were similar to the lake average.  Crappie were aged from 2 to 7 years old.  Similar to most crappie populations, the majority of fish sampled in each survey have been from one or two year classes.  Growth was similar to the statewide average, resulting in crappie taking five years to average 8 inches. <br> \n <br> \nThe Northern Pike population had low catch rates, above average size distribution, and slightly below average growth.  The gill net catch was similar to average for the lake, but below average for lakes with similar habitat.  However, higher catch rates are undesirable, as they are typically indicative of higher density populations with poor size structure and slow growth.  Lengths ranged from 13 to 29 inches, with an average of 19 inches.  The proportions of pike sampled that were greater than 21 and 28 inches were similar to average.  Pike were aged from 2 to 8 years old.  Growth was slightly below the statewide average, resulting in pike taking five years to average 21 inches. Due to the lake's small size anglers are encouraged to release Northern Pike exceeding 26 inches and harvest up to 10 less than 22 inches. <br> \n <br> \nThe Yellow Perch population had low catch rates and average size distribution.  The gill net catch was the lowest observed for the lake and was lower than average for lakes with similar habitat.  Lengths ranged from 4 to 9 inches, with an average of 7 inches.  The proportion of perch sampled that were greater than 8 inches was lower than average, while the 2018 survey was only the second time 10 inch perch have not been sampled.  Perch have been aged from 2 to 9 years old.  Growth was not determined in 2018, but was above average in the past two surveys.   Yellow Perch take five years to average 8 inches.  The lower perch density observed in 2018 will likely limit the number of adult Walleye and other gamefish, as well as the survival rates of stocked Walleye.   <br> \n <br> \nThe Largemouth Bass population had low catch rates.  Only three bass were sampled in 2018, and they ranged in size from 8 to 13 inches and were aged from 3 to 5 years old.   <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled in this survey included Black Bullhead, Golden Shiner, Hybrid Sunfish, Pumpkinseed Sunfish, Rock Bass and White Sucker.   <br> \n <br> \nIn order to maintain or improve fish and wildlife populations, water quality and habitat must be protected.  People often associate water quality problems with large-scale agricultural, forestry, urban development or industrial practices in the watershed.  In reality, the impact of land use decisions on one lake lot may be relatively small, yet the cumulative impact of those decisions on many lake lots can result in a significant decline in water quality and habitat.  For example, removing shoreline and aquatic vegetation, fertilizing lawns, mowing to the water's edge, installing beach sand blankets, failing septic systems and uncontrolled run-off, all contribute excess nutrients and sediment which degrade water quality and habitat.  Understanding these cumulative impacts and taking steps to avoid or minimize them will help to insure our quality fisheries can be enjoyed by future generations. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers and boaters are reminded to help stop the spread of invasive species by removing all aquatic plants from boats, trailers, and equipment.  All drain plugs must be removed and live and bait wells must be drained before leaving the access.  Anglers and boaters are encouraged to power wash and thoroughly dry all equipment prior to use in another water body. <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n</p>",
