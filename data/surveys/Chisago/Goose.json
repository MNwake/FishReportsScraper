                "narrative": "<p>Goose Lake is 754 total acres divided into two basins.  The walleye population is maintained through biennial fingerling stocking.  Goose Lake is assigned to lake class 24.  Lakes grouped in class 24 are typically deep with hard water.  In order to assess the current fishery, lake management goals, and walleye stocking success Goose Lake was netted in July of 2007. <br> \n <br> \nThe walleye gillnet catch (1.7/set) fell below the lake management goal but was in the normal range for lake class 24.  The 2002 and 1997 catch rates were near 6 per net.  Walleye size increased since the 2002 sample with averages of 19.5 inches and 2.7 pounds.  Only one walleye less than 16 inches was captured. <br> \n  <br> \nThe northern pike catch rate was 5.3 per gillnet, down from the record high of 2002 but still above the management goal and the lake class norm.  Like walleye, pike average size, at 22.1 inches and 2.3 pounds, increased since 2002.  Thirty percent of measured northerns were between 20 and 21 inches.  Yellow perch are a primary forage species for northern pike.  The ample forage provided by the high perch abundance, reported in 1997 assessment, may explain the apparent increase in the northern pike population.  Although larger northerns were sampled, the 20 and 21 inch groups dominated the catch. Ninety percent of the catch was between 2 and 4 years old.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch, a primary forage of both walleye and northern pike, abundance was up slightly since 2002.  The 6.2 per net catch rate and the average weight of 0.2 pounds were both within the lake class norm.  Perch length distribution has also increased with the majority of measured fish exceeding 7.5 inches in length.  <br> \n <br> \nThe black bullhead catch remained high at 98 per gill net, higher than any previous sample and above the lake class norm.  Black bullheads averaged 9.7 inches and half a pound.       <br> \n <br> \nThe black crappie catch rate, at 8.3/trap net, was normal based on the lake class and the highest since 1983.  Angling pressure for crappies is heaviest in winter and early spring with good success.  Overall crappies ranged from 4.8 to 11.1 inches with an 8 inch and 0.3 pound average.  Nineteen percent of the catch exceeded 9 inches in length. <br> \n  <br> \nBluegill trap net catch rates have fluctuated since 1955.  Similar to the crappie catch the 2007 catch rate for bluegill, 15.3/trapnet, was also the highest since 1983.  Although the catch rate increased four fold since 2002, bluegill maintained the average weight of 0.3 pounds.  Lengths ranged from 4.9 to 8.7 inches with half the sample over 7 inches. <br> \n <br> \nElectrofishing indices of largemouth bass abundance were first conducted in 1995 following public concern over their numbers.  Based on catch rates largemouth abundance has been increasing since 1995.  Size has diminished some but most bass sampled in 2002 exceeded 12 inches with an average weight of 1.6 pounds.  The catch rate of 33 per hour can be considered moderate compared to other Chisago County lakes and is the highest recorded to date.   <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species present in the lake included brown bullhead, common carp, smallmouth bass, hybrid sunfish, green sunfish, pumpkinseed, white sucker, and yellow bullhead.     <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Goose Lake has an area of 754 acres divided into two basins. Goose Lake is assigned to lake class 24.  Lakes grouped in class 24 are typically deep with hard water.  The walleye population is maintained through annual fingerling stocking. Special regulations inn effect on Goose Lake include a 17 inch minimum length for walleye and a 5 fish bag limit for crappie. In order to assess the current fishery, lake management goals,  walleye stocking success, and special regulations Goose Lake was netted in May and July of 2012. <br> \n <br> \nThe walleye gillnet catch (5.2/set) fell just below the lake's historic mean but met the management goal and exceeded the 50th percentile for lake class 24. Walleye ranged in length from 10 to 25.5 inches with a 17.2 inch, 1.9 pound mean. Age analysis found fairly typical growth rates. Six year classes of walleye were present, each from a year in which stocking occurred. This regular recruitment yielded an even length frequency. Although walleye size decreased compared to the prior assessment, when averages were 19.5 inches and 2.7 pounds, only a couple of year classes were represented in the 2007 catch. <br> \n  <br> \nAfter dipping some in 2007, northern pike abundance, based on gillnet catch rates, was at a historic high in 2012.   Pike catch rate (10.8 per gillnet) exceeded both the lake management goal and the 75th percentile for the lake type. Despite these high numbers, pike size structure is good. Northern pike averaged 23.9 inches and 3.2 pounds with fish over 34 inches present.  Northern pike exhibited faster than normal growth.  Two thirds of the catch was between 3 and 5 years old. <br> \n <br> \nDespite providing the primary forage of these strong walleye and northern pike populations, yellow perch were present at levels above the lake's historic mean and the lake class norm.  With relatively few perch exceeding 7 inches, the current perch size structure provides little angler harvest opportunity. <br> \n <br> \nThe black crappie catch rate, at 15.8/gillnet, was near the 75th percentile and near the historic means observed before 1997.  Overall crappies ranged from 4.2 to 11.0 inches with adult fish averaging 8.8 inches. <br> \n <br> \n Based on electrofishing catch rates, largemouth bass abundance has increased with each assessment since the initial one in 1995. Forty three largemouth were captured in the 2012 sample, yielding a moderate catch rate of 37.9 bass per hour. Similar to 2002, most bass sampled in 2012 exceeded 12 inches with 28% of adults 15 inches or longer. Bass grew well in Goose Lake reaching 12 inches by the end of their fourth summer. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Goose Lake is comprised of two distinct basins totaling 754 acres and is assigned to lake class 24. The north basin, which is shallow and subject to low winter oxygen levels, received little sampling effort prior to the 2002 survey. The public access is located on the north basin, which is connected to the south basin by a narrow bridged channel. This limits public access during the winter due to unsafe ice conditions under the bridge. Passage of medium sized boats is possible except during low water periods. The south basin is larger and deeper with adequate winter oxygen. The lake is primarily managed for Walleye, Northern Pike, and Black Crappie. The previous survey was conducted in 2012.  <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie trap net catch of 9.3 per lift increased from the previous survey's catch of 8.3. This is the highest catch since the 1983 survey and is higher than average for the lake class. The majority of fish sampled were 4 years old and this was reflected in the size distribution. Mean length was 9.7 inches and the maximum was 11.7 inches with 88% of fish between 9 and 11 inches. A large catch of smaller crappies in gill nets indicates a strong 2015 year class. The strong 2012 year class followed by a strong 2015 year class should provide excellent fishing for the next few years. The Goose Lake chain (including Mandall and Rabour) has a five fish limit on crappies. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye catch rate was typical compared to historic rates at 5.9 fish per gill net and was slightly above the previous survey. This is well above the mean for the lake class and satisfies the management goal. Sampled Walleye ranged in length from 8.8 to 27.9 inches and averaged 18.1 inches. Fish growth was good overall and most year classes were represented back to 2002. Since fish are stocked on an annual basis, it is unknown what contribution natural reproduction may be making to the walleye population. A special regulation of a 17 inch minimum is in place for Walleyes on the Goose Lake chain.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike catch rate decreased a bit to 7.9 fish per gillnet following a historic high of 10.8 in the previous survey. Although this is still very high for the lake class, the population exhibits a healthy size structure with 11% of fish sampled measuring 30 inches or longer. Pike length averaged 22.8 inches with a maximum of 36.6. All year classes back to 2008 were represented and growth was good overall. This lake holds the potential to produce trophy fish for anglers. <br> \n <br> \nThe Yellow Perch catch rate of 11.8 fish per gillnet was down slightly from the previous survey but is still above average for the lake class. Unfortunately these fish are of little value to anglers, as 93% of fish measured were less than 7 inches long. Bluegill produced a record high catch rate of 15.9 fish per trap net, yet it still fell short of the average catch for the lake class. Twenty-three percent of Bluegill sampled in the gill nets measured 8 inches or longer so there is some potential for harvest by anglers. It is possible that angler harvest is minimizing the presence of larger individuals in this relatively low density population.  <br> \n <br> \nCatch rates for Largemouth Bass while electrofishing dropped significantly from the previous survey from 37.9 fish per hour to 13.4. It is unlikely that this decrease is due to a significant decrease in the bass population. A number of factors may have impacted catchability such as vegetation density. The bass that were sampled ranged from 8.4 to 17.4 inches long and averaged 14.2 inches. Anecdotally, anglers have reported better than average bass fishing on the lake and electrofishing on the two smaller lakes in the Goose Lake chain produced much higher catch rates this spring.    <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Goose Lake is 754 total acres divided into two basins.  The walleye population is maintained through biannual fingerling stocking.  Goose Lake is assigned to lake class 24.  Lakes grouped in class 24 are typically deep with hard water.  In order to assess the current fishery, lake management goals, and walleye stocking success Goose Lake was netted in July of 2002.The walleye gillnet catch (6/set) met the lake management goal and was in the normal range for lake class 24.  The 1997 catch rate was very similar. Size was also similar with averages of 15.6 inches and 1.6 pounds.  The walleye sample was dominated by the 1997 and 2001 year classes, both were years when fingerlings were stocked.  The 2002 survey included 2 new gill net sets in the shallow north basin which had catch rates similar to some nets in the south basin.    The northern pike catch rate was 8.7 per gill net, the highest since netting began in 1955.  Excluding the high catch rates of the new net sets in the north basin, the catch was still over 7 per gill net, well above the management goal and higher than all past assessments.  Yellow perch are a primary forage species for northern pike.  The ample forage provided by the high perch abundance, reported in 1997 assessment, may explain the apparent increase in the northern pike population.  Although larger northerns were sampled, the 20 and 21 inch groups dominated the catch. Ninety percent of the catch was between 2 and 4 years old. Yellow perch abundance was down compared to the 1997 netting, but at 5.7 per gillnet, fell within the normal range compared to other lakes in class 24.  The 1997 catch was a record high for the lake.   Predation by the strong northern and walleye populations has likely returned the perch abundance to a more historic level.  Perch size distribution has changed little since the 1997 assessment.  All but 3 sampled perch were from either the 1999 or 2000 year classes.  Young of the year perch were sampled in the shoreline seining, averaging 2.5 inches in length.  The black bullhead catch was high at 71.9 per gill net, higher than any previous sample and above the lake class norm.  Black bullheads averaged 8.4 inches and half a pound.      The black crappie catch rate, at 2.4/trap net, was normal based on the lake class and similar to the 1997 catch.  Angling pressure for crappies is heaviest in winter and early spring with good success.  Sampled crappies ranged from 4.2 to 11.2 inches.  One and two year old crappies accounted for 84% of the catch but fast growth allowed the two olds to average 7 inches.   One young of the year black crappie was sampled during the shoreline seining.  Bluegill trap net catch rates have fluctuated since 1955.  While the 2002 catch rate was less than half the previous assessment, bluegill size increased to an average of 0.3 pounds with individuals as large as 9.3 inches.  A strong 2002 year class was found during the shoreline seining.Electrofishing indicies of largemouth bass abundance were first conducted in 1995 following public concern over their numbers.  Based on catch rates largemouth abundance has been increasing since 1995.  Size has diminished some but most bass sampled in 2002 exceeded 12 inches with an average weight of 1.6 pounds.  The catch rate of 27 per hour can be considered moderate compared to other Chisago County lakes.  Young of the year bass were sampled in the shoreline seining and averaged 3.2 inches.Other fish species present in the lake included brown bullhead, common carp, common shiner, green sunfish, pumpkinseed, white sucker, and yellow bullhead.    </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Goose Lake is comprised of two distinct basins totaling 754 acres and is assigned to lake class 24. The north basin, which is shallow and subject to low winter oxygen levels, received little sampling effort prior to the 2002 survey. The public access is located on the north basin which connects to the south basin by a narrow, bridged channel. This limits public access during the winter due to unsafe ice conditions under the bridge. Passage of medium sized boats is possible except during low water periods. The south basin is larger and deeper with adequate winter oxygen. The lake is primarily managed for Walleye and Black Crappie. Special regulations on Goose Lake include a crappie bag limit of 5 and a 17-inch minimum length limit for Walleye. <br> \n <br> \nThe 2021 catch was on the high end for Northern Pike and the low end for Walleye when compared to the past assessments. Sixty percent of the Walleye caught exceeded the lakes 17- inch minimum harvest regulation while Northerns averaged 25 inches. Bluegill posted another historic high catch for the lake while Black Crappie were down somewhat compared to the 2016 assessment. More than half the crappie exceeded 9 inches and three fourths of the Bluegill caught were over 7 inches. Largemouth Bass numbers rebounded since the 2016 assessment, largely due the abundance of sub-adults in the sample. Most of the adult bass were over 12 inches in length.</p>",

Fourteen sampling sites were evenly spaced around the shoreline and each site was sampled by electrofishing, and/or seining.  Nearshore sampling captured 15 species of fish; Bluegill, Black Crappie, Largemouth Bass, Pumpkinseed, Hybrid Sunfish, Green Sunfish, Fathead, Northern Pike, Yellow Perch, Iowa Darter, Johnny Darter, Bowfin, Central Mudminnow, Golden Shiner, Yellow Bullhead, Tadpole Madtom. <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore fish survey data is combined with gill net and trap net data from lake surveys to describe the fish community and provide a fish-based Index of Biotic Integrity (FIBI) score based on expectations for similar lakes.  The FIBI score for Goose Lake based on this survey is below the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes. <br> \n <br> \nThis survey is contributing to a watershed assessment process in coordination with the MN Pollution Control Agency. Goose Lake is located in the Lower St. Croix River Watershed.  For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>  Goose Lake was surveyed July 13-16, 1992 utilizing seven gillnets, six trapnets, and three shoreline seine hauls.  The present fish population of Goose Lake was evaluated by comparing resultant catch rate, age, and growth data with that of past surveys and the lake class 24 medians.  \n  The walleye gillnet catch (4.86/set) decreased from the 1987 catch (7.14) but falls between the first and third quartile values (1.00 and 5.75/set) for the lake class is therefore considered normal.  Sampled walleye ranged from 11.0-25.9 inches in length with a median length group of 18.0-18.9 inches.  Their mean weight of 2.23 pounds was normal compared to the lake class mean of 1.87 pounds.  Back- calculated age and growth data from scale and spine samples indicated that captured walleye ranged from two to eight years of age.  A non-stocking year, 1988, represented the strongest year class.  Low water levels that spring may have exposed good reproductive habitat that is normally too deep to attract spawning fish.  Growth, based on the statewide walleye growth rate, was faster than normal for the first five years then slowed considerably.\n  The northern pike gillnet catch (3.57/set) was down from the 1987 catch of 3.71/set but normal compared to the lake class median of 6.50/set.  Sampled northern pike ranged in length from 16.0-29.9 inches with a median length group of 23.0-23.9 inches. Their mean weight was 3.03 pounds which is normal based on the lake class mean of 2.55 pounds. Back-calculated age and growth data from scale samples indicated that captured northern pike ranged from two to seven years of age with the strongest year class hatched in 1987.  Based on the statewide growth of northern pike, growth occurred at a normal rate.\n  The trapnet catch of black crappie (6.83/set) increased from the 1987 catch of 3.33/set and was normal compared to the lake class median of 5.25/set.  Sampled black crappie ranged in length from 4.0-9.9 inches with a median length group of 8.0-8.4 inches.  Their mean weight was 0.27 pounds which is very close to the lake class mean of 0.24 pounds. Back-calculated age and growth data from scale samples indicated that captured black crappie ranged from one to five years of age with 1988 representing the strongest year class.  Growth was normal based on the statewide growth rate of the species.  \n  The yellow perch gillnet catch (6.14/set) was down from the 1987 catch of 16.86/set but normal relative to the lake class median of 10.25/set.  Sampled yellow perch ranged from 5.5-8.4 inches in length with a median length group of 6.0-6.4 inches.  Their mean weight was 0.11 pounds which is identical to the lake class mean.  Back-calculated age and growth data from scale samples indicated that captured yellow perch ranged in age from two to five years with two year olds making up 50% of the sample.  Growth occurred near the statewide growth rate of yellow perch.  \n  The bluegill trapnet catch (1.67/set) is the lowest recorded dating back to 1955.  Trapnet catches have historically been below the first quartile value (14.50/set) of the lake class.  Sampled bluegill ranged from 4.9-8.4 inches in length and had a normal mean weight (0.20 pounds) based on the lake class mean of 0.15 pounds.  Back-calculated age and growth data from scale samples indicated that captured bluegill ranged in age from two to six years and grew normally compared to the statewide growth rate of bluegill.  The shoreline seine hauls captured ninety four young of the year bluegill. \n  Largemouth bass susceptibility to standard lake survey sampling gear is low.  Therefore, early morning electrofishing was conducted using a sixteen foot pulsed D.C. boom shocker.  The sampled largemouth bass ranged from 12.0-18.9 inches.  Back-calculated age and growth data indicated that captured largemouth bass were four, five, and seven years old.  Growth was faster than normal up till age six where it slowed in reference to the statewide growth rate for the species.  The shoreline seine hauls captured 66 young of the year largemouth bass.\n  Two white crappie, pumpkinseed, and common carp individuals were sampled resulting in catch rates below their respective lake class medians of 1.58, 2.79, and 1.00/set.  Mean weights of white crappie and pumpkinseed were normal while that of common carp were high compared to their lake class means.  All of the remaining fish species sampled (bowfin, white sucker, black bullhead, yellow bullhead, and hybrid sunfish) had normal catch rates and mean weights based on their lake class medians except the white sucker which was high in both regards.\n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Goose Lake (lake class 24) consists of two basins; the North basin is shallow and subject to winterkill, while the South basin is deep with adequate oxygen.  Goose Lake is primarily managed for walleye, northern pike, and largemouth bass and secondly for black crappie and bluegill sunfish.  Stocking dates back to 1908, which included; trout sunfish, crappie, largemouth bass, and muskie.  The first introduction of walleye occurred in 1971.  Since 1976, stocking has consisted of mainly walleye with some northern pike stocking.  In 1993, the lake management plan was revised to alternate year walleye stocking so natural reproduction and the contribution of stocked walleye to the population could be evaluated.From July 14-18, 1997, a population assessment was conducted utilizing seven gillnets and nine trapnets.  Night electrofishing for largemouth bass (May 27,1997) and shoreline seining for young-of-the-year (September 15, 1997) were also utilized during this survey.Walleye abundance and average weight (1.7 lbs.) were normal for this lake type.  Lengths ranged from 8.7 to 27.6 inches with an average length of 16.1 inches.  Growth was above average for ages 2-6 and average growth continued thereafter.  Walleye presence has been due to mostly stocking although natural reproduction at times has been successful.  Northern pike were at historical high numbers, but remain in the normal range for this lake type.  The average weight, at 2.4 lbs., was also within the normal range.  Northern pike lengths ranged from 13.1 to 35.7 inches with an average length of 21.6 inches.  When compared to similar lakes, the northern pike in Goose Lake showed above average growth for the first two years and normal growth thereafter.Largemouth bass abundance seems low.  Currently, electrofishing catch rate averages have not been developed so comparisons with similar lakes could not be done at this time.  The average weight was 2.4 pounds, while lengths ranged from 9.6 to 21.3 inches with an average length of 14.7 inches.  Personal communication with several lake residents during the survey revealed angler reports of good bass fishing during the summer of 1997.  These reports included bass sizes ranging from 1.0 to 6.5 pounds with an average weight of 2.8 pounds.  Also, DNR personnel visually observed eight (8-12inch) largemouth bass during the survey while setting trapnets.The black crappie numbers along with average weight (0.2 lbs.) were normal for this lake class.  Lengths ranged from 4.5 to 8.5 inches with an average length of 6.7 inches.  The bluegill population was within the normal range for this lake type along with the average weight (0.2 lbs.).  Lengths ranged from 3.3 to 9.4 inches with an average length of 6.3 inches.  Yellow perch numbers were above average when compared with similar lakes and the average weight, at 0.1 pounds, was within the normal range for this lake type.  Lengths ranged from 5.4 to 7.9 inches with an average length of 6.1 inches.Other species sampled in the 1997 population assessment included; white sucker, black, brown, and yellow bullhead, common carp, bowfin, golden shiner, and Johnny darter.  For this lake type, the white sucker population was above average in numbers, while the common carp population was below normal in abundance.  When abundance was compared with previous surveys, white sucker was at a historical high and common carp was at a historical low.  Abundance of all three species of bullhead fell within their normal ranges for the lake class.Shoreline seining showed successful natural reproduction for bluegill, green, and punkinseed sunfish, largemouth bass, and yellow perch.Prepared by Audrey Posterick, Fisheries Specialist   </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Based on respective local medians the present fish population is as follows:  The walleye (7.14/set) remains substantially the same as the 1983 survey (8.14/set) and still well above the local median (3.52/set).  The walleye population is the product of stocked fingerlings that have exhibited above average growth rates and good success for the years stocked.  A minimal amount of natural reproduction appears to occur.  The current walleye population has an excellent size distribution (median length group 17.0-17.9 inches, mean weight 2.0 pounds).  Northern pike (3.71/set) have shown a real increase from the 1983 survey (1.57/set) to a level that is near the local median (3.88/set).  Northern pike natural reproduction contributes significantly to the population and periodic fingerling stocking has failed to produce year classes large enough to distinguish them from natural reproduction.  Year class representation is good but growth rates are somewhat below average.  The median length group for northern pike is 18.0- 18.9 inches.  Yellow perch (16.86/set) have also experienced a real increase from 1983 (4.43/set) but remain below the local median (24.27/set).  Over 500 young of the year (YOY) were recorded during shoreline seining.  The yellow perch median length group is 6.0 - 6.4 inches.  Only 2 largemouth bass were taken in test nets but 107 YOY were recorded during shoreline seining.  Although straightforward comparison of trapnet data is compromised by an inconsistent number of sets on previous surveys, it appears that bluegills (13.67/set) have increased substantially from the 1983 survey (4.00/set) but still remain below the local median (25.67/ set).  Bluegills tend to be small, ranging from 3.0 to 7.9 inches, with a 6.0 - 6.4 inch median length group.  Over 500 YOY sunfish were recorded during shoreline seining.  Black crappies (3.33/set) have been declining from a high point in 1974 (36.00/set) to the current historic low, far below the local median (18.45/set).  The black crappie median length group, however, has correspondingly increased from 6.0-6.4 inches in 1974 to 8.0 -8.4 inches at the present.  Two white crappies were taken for the first time during the current survey.  Black, brown, and yellow bullheads all appear to have declined somewhat from the previous survey with a dramatic drop in the gillnet catch of black bullheads, from 24.86/set to 1.00/set.  They are all currently well below local medians.  Other species taken in test nets (bowfin, carp, white sucker, pumpkinseed, golden shiner, and hybrid sunfish) do not appear to be substantially above or below local medians nor have they undergone any noteworthy changes from the previous survey.  A large carp population, however, is suspected, and has been utilized by commercial fishermen in the past.</p>",
