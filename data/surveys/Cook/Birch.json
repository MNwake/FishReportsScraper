Catches of both species were low for this lake historically, and compared to similar lakes in the Grand Marais area.  None of the lake trout collected appeared to have come from stocking, since none bore the appropriate fin clips.  Most of the rainbow trout collected were age-1 fish from the 1998 yearling stocking, but at least some three-year-old fish were also present.  Two small brook trout were collected, but their presence was puzzling, since that species has not been stocked in the lake, and has not been found in any connecting waters.  The fish may have been naturally produced splake with a strong brook trout appearance.  No other gamefish, and no panfish, were found in the lake in 1998.Gill net catches in this assessment were stratified by depth, and therefore do not appear on public information reports.  The combined catches in deep and shallow sets (six sets total), with the mean weight for fish collected, was as follows:Brook trout       0.17 fish/net, mean weight 0.53 lb.Lake trout        0.67 fish/net, mean weight 2.51 lb.Rainbow trout     0.83 fish/net, mean weight 1.32 lb.White sucker      4.17 fish/net, mean weight 1.47 lb.</p>",

Lake trout growth was relatively fast, but survival was low, due to high fishing mortality, poor temperature-oxygen conditions, or both.  Naturally-reproduced lake trout accounted for all but one of the fish collected in 1994; however, the total sample size was too small to adequately assess the strength of natural reproduction in the lake.  Rainbow trout were abundant, and fish from the 1994, 1992, and 1990 stockings were collected.  Minnow abundance also appeared to be relatively high, but possibly not for this lake historically.  This assessment looked for, but failed to find any smallmouth bass, which had been reported to be present by cabin owners on the lake.  Establishment of smallmouth bass in Birch Lake would make further management for trout difficult or impossible.  White sucker, eliminated in the 1969 reclamation of the lake, have now re-established a population comprised of several year classes and a wide range of sizes.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Birch Lake is currently managed for rainbow and brook trout.  The long range goal (from the 2008 management plan) for rainbow trout is to maintain a rainbow trout population with a minimum gill net catch of 1.0 fish/set, and a minimum mean weight of 1.4 lb/fish.  The long range goal for brook trout is a population with a minimum gill net catch of 3.0 fish/set and a minimum mean weight of 0.75 lb/fish.  This was the second of two assessments scheduled in the 2008 plan to determine growth and survival of stocked rainbow and brook trout.  The current management plan for Birch Lake will be reviewed and revised in March 2014.\n\nAssessments of Birch Lake use a combination of deep and shallow gill net sets.  Deep sets target coldwater species, while shallow sets target warm and cool-water species.  In DNR Lakefinder reports, catches in those nets have been combined.  In addition, 0.25-in-mesh trap nets were used in this assessment to monitor the nearshore fish community.  Catches for those nets are not included in Lakefinder reports.\n\nThe combined rainbow trout catch in deep and shallow gill net sets (4.78 fish/set) easily met the current long range goal for the species, and fell within the normal range (1.00-6.50 fish/set) for fall assessments of stream trout lakes in this area.  The mean weight for rainbow trout taken in gill nets (1.14 lb/fish) fell short of the long range goal, but exceeded the normal range (0.53-1.13 lb/fish) for fall catches in area stream trout lakes.  The rainbow trout catch was dominated by one-year-old fish from the 2012 yearling stocking, although a small number of three-year-old fish from the 2010 stocking were also present.  Rainbow trout growth over the summer of 2012 had apparently been good.  Fish were stocked in the early spring at an average weight of 0.33 lb/fish, while the mean weight for one-year-old fish taken in September was 0.92 lb/fish.  Growth for the three-year-old rainbow trout taken in this assessment had been fast; they reached an average length of 18.1 inches at the end of their third year, compared to an area average of 14.3 inches.\n\nShort-term growth and survival of stocked rainbow trout had been relatively high, despite the presence of smallmouth bass.  Rainbow trout are well adapted to thrive on an invertebrate forage base.  It is possible that smallmouth bass, by decimating minnow populations in this lake, reduced competition faced by rainbow trout for invertebrate forage.\n\nThe combined brook trout catch in deep and shallow gill net sets (0.44 fish/set) fell well short of the goal set for the species, and was below the normal range for fall assessments of stream trout lakes in this area (1.50-14.00 fish/set).  The size goal was met, since the catch consisted entirely of two- and three-year-old fish from stocking done in 2011 and 2010.  Brook trout growth had been somewhat slower than average.  Fished reached an average length of 9.1 inches by the end of their second year, compared to an area average of 9.4 inches.\n\nSmallmouth bass have probably had an adverse effect on brook trout survival and growth.  Although brook trout yearlings (instead of fingerlings) have been stocked to reduce direct predation from bass, they have not been as large as the rainbow trout yearlings stocked, and some predation may have occurred.  Brook trout growth has generally been better when they have had access to a minnow forage base.  Loss of minnow populations in this lake probably reduced the potential for good brook trout growth.\n\nThe smallmouth bass catch in shallow gill net sets was within the normal range (0.50-1.50 fish/set) for that gear.  Only two year classes were represented in the combined assessment catch (two five-year-old fish in gill nets, five one-year-old fish in 0.25-in trap nets), suggesting that smallmouth bass reproductive success or recruitment might be sporadic in this lake.\n\nDespite the lack of suitable habitat, there may still be a few lake trout remaining in Birch Lake.  One large fish was taken in this assessment.  The temperature-oxygen profile found no portion of the water column with conditions suitable for lake trout (temperature < 55 F, oxygen > 5 ppm), but conditions that may have been at least survivable were found at depths of 27 to 30 ft.\n\nNo new undesirable fish species were found in 2012.  The white sucker gill net catch was relatively low compared to catches seen in this lake since 1994, and fell within the normal range for shallow sets in stratified assessments in this area (1.23-5.00 fish/set).  For the third assessment in a row, no minnows of any kind were taken in 0.25-in-mesh trap nets.  Minnows were abundant in Birch Lake prior to the appearance of smallmouth bass.\n\n\n\n\n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Birch Lake is a 236-acre lake located 34 miles north of Grand Marais and public access is through a carry-in access along the south shore. Rainbow trout are the primary management species with yearlings stocked every year since 2016. Brook trout were last stocked in 2015 and were not captured in the 2023 survey. In addition, there is a small natural population of lake trout that continues to persist despite limited habitat. The 2023 standard survey of Birch Lake was conducted to evaluate survival and growth of stocked rainbow trout.  <br> \n <br> \nRainbow trout catches in the 2023 survey gill nets were comparable to the last two surveys (3.83 fish/net) and were slightly above average for similar lakes in the area. Rainbow trout captured ranged from 10.4 - 18.6 inches with most of the fish being about 12 inches long. There were slightly less larger fish in the population than in previous surveys. Aging results indicated that fish from 3 year classes were present in the lake with the oldest being 3 years old. Growth rates for rainbow trout were good. Birch Lake continues to provide good angling opportunities for rainbow trout.  <br> \n <br> \nDespite marginal temperature-oxygen conditions that provide limited habitat for lake trout in most years, the lake trout population has continued to persist in Birch Lake. The lake trout catch was very low but similar to catches seen in this lake since 2007. The one lake trout taken in the survey was 12 years old and 21.7 inches. Naturally reproducing lake trout populations are unique in Minnesota lakes, anglers targeting lake trout should consider catch and release practices with safe handling procedures.   <br> \n <br> \nCatches in 0.25-in-mesh trap nets indicated there has been no recovery of the nearshore fish community, which collapsed after smallmouth bass became established in this lake in the mid 2000s. As has been the case in most recent surveys, no minnows were found. There was one small (4.7 inch) smallmouth bass collected in the 2023 survey which is the fewest seen in surveys since they were detected in 2004. Smallmouth bass are likely not abundant enough to provide good angling opportunities. <br> \n <br> \nCook County, Minnesota lakes continue to be susceptible to aquatic invasive species introductions. Invasive species have the potential to significantly alter fish communities and overall lake health. Anglers should clean watercraft and fishing gear, drain all water, and dispose of unused bait in the trash to prevent accidental introductions. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>The lake trout catch in 2004 was about average for a lake of this type, but fell short of management goals for the species.  Most of the lake trout collected were small (under 16 inches), and growth rates had been slow.  Although lake trout have been stocked in Birch Lake every other year for many yearss, none of the lake trout collected in 2004 bore fin clips that would have identified them as stocked fish. Recent lake trout stockings have apparently failed.The rainbow trout catch in 2004 was also low, although some larger fish were present.  The low catch may have been the result of lower numbers of yearlings being stocked in 2004, due to a water supply problem at the hatchery suppying fish for this lake.  Growth rates for the larger rainbow trout taken in 2004 had been fast.Brook trout have not been stocked in Birch Lake, and their presence in the lake in 2004 is a bit of a mystery.  There may be some suitable spawning habitat available, and brook trout (or splake strongly resembling brook) may be reproducing in small numbers in this lake.Smallmouth bass were taken in Birch Lake for the first time in this assessment, and they were fairly abundant.  The catch consisted mostly of two-year-old fish.  Anglers and lake residents had been reporting smallmouth bass catches in this lake for several years, and it appears that a self-sustained population has become established.  Smallmouth bass may have been illegally introduced, or they may have moved into Birch Lake from Moss Lake, where they were illegally introduced in the 1970's or 1980's.Minnow populations in Birch Lake appear to have crashed since smallmouth bass became established.  Only one minnow (a single darter) was taken in minnow-sampling gear used in 2004, compared to thousands collected in earlier years.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>The single lake trout caught in this assessment was taken in a deep-set gill net.  The four previous assessments used the same number of deep gill net sets (three), and had taken 5 lake trout in 2004, 3 lake trout in 1998, and 0 lake trout in 1996 and 1994.  This fish was 13 years old, so was of the 1994 year class.  Fish of that year class had been fin clipped and stocked as yearlings in 1995.  This fish had no clipped fins, so had been naturally produced.  It had grown slowly.   <br> \n <br> \nAll splake caught were of the 2006 year class and had been stocked as yearlings in spring 2007, which was the first splake stocking since 1979.  So these were age 1, in their second year of growth, and had spent one growing season in the lake.  Comparisons to other lakes will have to wait until more stocking occurs.  Yearling splake are no longer available for use in this lake; plans currently call for stocking yearling brook trout in their place, beginning in 2009. <br> \n <br> \nThe combined deep and shallow catch of rainbow trout (0.50 fish/set) was similar to catches observed in 2004 and 1998, but appeared to have been lower than catches in 1994 and 1996.  The 2007 catch was below the normal range for catches of this species in fall assessments in area stream trout lakes.  However, most stream trout lakes in the area have fewer fish species than does Birch Lake, and are stocked more frequently, so rainbow trout  could be expected to be less abundant in this lake.  The average weight of a rainbow trout in the combined deep and shallow catch (2.14 lb) compared favorably with values in previous population assessments: 2.66 lb in 2004, 1.32 lb in 1998, 0.87 lb in 1996, and 1.23 lb in 1994.  The three rainbow trout caught in this assessment were age 2, and had been stocked as yearlings in 2006.  Growth had been fast.  These fish were over three inches longer than the average for their age in this area.  <br> \n <br> \nThe source of the single walleye taken in this assessment is unknown.  The DNR has not stocked this species since the lake was reclaimed in 1969.  This is the first assessment since then to collect walleye.  The 3-year-old fish had grown at a rate somewhat slower than average for the lake class in this area. <br> \n <br> \nThe smallmouth bass catch in shallow-set gill nets matched the catch in the 2004 assessment, which was the first assessment to have collected the species.  The catch exceeded the 75th percentile (1.50 fish/set) for shallow sets in the area.  The average weight for bass caught in the 2007 assessment was double that of the 2004 assessment, but was still fairly low compared to average lengths of fish taken in similar lakes in the area.  Five age classes were represented in the combined catch from shallow-set gill nets and 0.25-inch-mesh trap nets: ages 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6.  Growth of the two age-2 fish had been fast, and the remaining fish had grown faster than average for the lake class and area. <br> \n <br> \nWhite sucker abundance was less than usual for this lake, but was within the normal range for population assessments in this area when this type of sampling has been used.  The average weight for white sucker was high for this lake, and in comparison to average weights for suckers taken in similar lakes in the area. <br> \n <br> \nNo minnows were caught by 0.25-in-mesh trap nets in this assessment.  This gear caught no minnows in the 2004 assessment, but had taken many when used in previous assessments.  The decline in minnow numbers corresponds with the appearance of smallmouth bass in the lake. <br> \n</p>",

Survival of lake trout much beyond two years appeared to be very limited.  Temperature-oxygen conditions were somewhat marginal for lake trout, with low oxygen levels in the deeper waters of the lake.Rainbow trout were also fairly abundant.  Most of the rainbow trout taken were Kamloop-strain fish from a 1996 yearling stocking, but there were still some larger fish present from yearling stockings done in 1994 and 1992.  Minnows were abundant.  No smallmouth bass were found, despite reports of their presence.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>This was the first of three standard surveys scheduled in the 2014 lake management plan to evaluate a change in Rainbow Trout stocking quota and frequency, slated to begin in 2016.  It was also the final survey done to evaluate Brook Trout yearling stocking in this lake, which was discontinued after 2015.  Beginning in 2016, Rainbow Trout yearlings will be stocked annually, rather than every-other year. <br> \n <br> \nRainbow Trout were fairly abundant in the fall of 2015, and although no large fish were taken, their mean length (about 16 inches) was high enough to drive some high-quality fishing.  The combined Rainbow Trout catch in deep and shallow gill net sets (3.0 fish/set) met the long range goal from the 2014 plan (a minimum of 2.0 fish/set).  The mean weight for Rainbow Trout collected in 2015 equaled the long range goal from the 2014 plan (1.4 lb/fish).  The catch consisted entirely of two-year-old fish from the 2014 yearling stocking.  Survival of fish to older ages seemed to have been low, but that was not surprising in this popular and accessible lake.  The shift to annual stocking should result in fish up to three years of age being more consistently present in this lake.  Rainbow Trout growth appeared to have been somewhat faster than average; fish reached a mean length of 12.5 inches by the end of their second year, compared to an area average of 11.6 inches. The relatively high number of fish surviving to almost three years of age, and the good growth rates exhibited by those fish, suggested that this lake could be managed successfully for Rainbow Trout despite the presence of Smallmouth Bass. <br> \n <br> \nDespite regular stocking, few Brook Trout were found in 2015.  The combined Brook Trout catch in deep and shallow gill net sets (0.3 fish/set) was low, falling below the normal range (1.25 - 14.00 fish/set) for gill net catches in fall surveys of stream trout lakes in the Grand Marais area.  Of the three Brook Trout collected, two were probably survivors of the 2015 yearling stocking.  The third may have been produced naturally; Brook Trout (and Splake) not accounted for by any stocking have been taken in small numbers in this lake in the past.  It appeared that alternate-year yearling stocking in this lake since 2009 had not produced a significant Brook Trout population, although a few have survived.  Brook Trout may compete more directly with Smallmouth Bass for available forage, and their smaller size at stocking may have left them more vulnerable to predation. <br> \n <br> \nDespite marginal temperature-oxygen conditions that provide little or no suitable habitat in many years, a small natural Lake Trout population has persisted in Birch Lake.  The Lake Trout catch was similar to catches seen in this lake since Lake Trout stocking was discontinued, but was low compared to other area Lake Trout lakes.  Both of the Lake Trout taken in this survey were small, young fish that would have been produced naturally. <br> \n <br> \nCatches in 0.25-in-mesh trap nets indicated there has been no recovery of the nearshore fish community, which collapsed after Smallmouth Bass became established in this lake.  As has been the case in most recent surveys, no minnows were found and it appeared that Smallmouth Bass dominated nearshore areas, at least at this time of year. <br> \n</p>",
