Most of the fish sampled were less than 20 inches long, but fish over 30 inches were collected.  The growth rate for northern pike is not fast.There is an abundant green sunfish population in Maple Lake.  They range in length from 5 to 9 inches.  This is the only lake in the Walker area that has such a population of green sunfish.The bluegill trapnet catch of 8.3 is not high when compared to similar lakes in the area.  Their growth rate is slow.The trapnet catch rate of largemouth bass was higher than catch rates from most other area lakes.  They ranged in length from 7 to 17 inches.  Their growth rate is near the statewide average.The trapnet catch of black crappie (15.1) was high.  The length frequency and ageing indicate substantial, yearly natural reproduction.  Fish from 3.5 to 13 inches in length were sampled. The growth rate for black crappie is near the statewide average growth rate.</p>",
