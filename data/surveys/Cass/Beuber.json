                "narrative": "<p>Beuber Lake (DOW# 11-353; Lake Class 29) is a 111-acre lake located approximately three miles north of Backus, MN. The lake has a shoreline length of 1.8 miles and a maximum depth of 32 feet. Similar lakes nearby include Pine (DOW# 11-0292), Rainy (DOW# 11-0356), and Sylvan (DOW# 11-0246). A Cass County-owned public access is located on the southwest shore. Most of the lake shore and associated upland is state-owned and the lakeshore remains in a wild, pristine state that is free of docks and cabins. Because of its small size and scenic beauty, Beuber Lake is a great lake for kayaks, canoes, and other small boats. Beuber Lake is an excellent panfish lake with abundant and diverse aquatic vegetation.  Excellent angling opportunities exist for quality sized bluegill, black crappie and northern pike. Bluegills are abundant and nearly half of the bluegills in the sample were 8 inches or greater in length.  The bluegill average length was 7.5 inches and the lengths ranged from 3 to 9 inches. Black crappies are moderately abundant with an average length of 9.6 inches and the lengths ranged from 3 to 11 inches. Northern pike are moderately abundant with an occasional 36\"+ fish showing up in survey nets. The northern pike mean length was 20 inches and the lengths ranged from 14 to 37 inches. The abundance of largemouth bass in Beuber Lake is not known because standard summer assessments do not effectively sample them. Beuber Lake certainly has the characteristics of a good largemouth bass lake with abundant aquatic vegetation and moderately abundant bluegills. Only one largemouth bass was sampled from standard netting in 2009. Historically, largemouth bass have been sampled greater than 19\" in length. Yellow perch abundance was at a historical low for Beuber Lake. Even though the abundance of yellow perch was very low, fish 10 inches or greater in length were in the sample. Other species present include bowfin (dogfish), brown bullhead, pumpkinseed sunfish, white sucker, and yellow bullhead. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers can help maintain or improve the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for table fare, but encourages release of medium- to large-sized fish.  Releasing these fish can help maintain balance in the fish community in Beuber Lake and provide anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future.   <br> \n <br> \nShoreline habitat consists of aquatic plants, woody plants and natural lake bottom soils.  Plants in the water and at the water\u0019s edge provide habitat, prevent erosion and absorb excess nutrients. Shrubs, trees, and woody debris such as fallen trees or limbs provide good habitat both above and below the water surface and should be left in place.  By leaving a buffer strip of natural vegetation along the shoreline, property owners can reduce erosion, help maintain water quality, and provide habitat and travel corridors for wildlife. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Beuber Lake is a 132-acre lake with 1.95 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 32 feet located north of Backus, MN. The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MNDNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different classes based on physical, chemical and other characteristics. Beuber Lake is in Lake Class 29. Other area lakes in this class include Diamond, Pine, and Rainy. A Cass County-owned public access is located on the southwest shore and most of the lakeshore is publicly owned. Beuber Lake is primarily managed for Bluegill and Northern Pike, and secondarily for Black Crappie, Largemouth Bass, and Yellow Perch. A special regulation for Sunfish (daily limit 5 fish) was implemented in 2022.  <br> \nBeuber Lake is a great multi-species lake. Black Crappie abundance met management goals and ranged in length from 5 to 9 inches long. Bluegill abundance exceeded management goals with an average length of 7 inches and fish up to 9 inches long sampled. Northern Pike abundance exceeded management goals and ranged in length from 14 to 29 inches with an average length of 22 inches long. Yellow Perch abundance met management goals and ranged in length from 5 to 9 inches with an average length of 7 inches long. <br> \nOther fish species sampled include Black Bullhead, Bowfin (Dogfish), Brown Bullhead, Hybrid Sunfish, Largemouth Bass, Pumpkinseed, and Yellow Bullhead. <br> \nPeople can have significant impacts on lakes and the fish populations they support. Harvest, lakeshore development, removal of shoreline vegetation, and introductions of invasive species can all adversely affect fish populations. Currently, no aquatic invasive species (AIS) have been identified in Beuber Lake. AIS are moved from infested to non-infested waters by anglers, boaters, and lake shore owners and can adversely impact lakes and fish populations. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access. If you suspect an infestation of an invasive species in this lake, save a specimen and report it to a local natural resource office. Additional information on all of these topics can be found on the DNR website (www.dnr.state.mn.us) or by contacting the Walker Area Fisheries office. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Beuber Lake is a 111-acre lake with a maximum depth of 32 feet.  It is located three miles north of Backus.  The Minnesota Department of Natural Resource has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on chemical, physical, and other characteristics.  Beuber Lake is in lake class 29.  Other area lakes in the same lake class include Pine (located 1.5 miles south of Whipholt), Rainy (located one mile north and 2.5 miles east of Backus), and Sylvan (located six miles east of Backus) Lakes.Northern pike were sampled at a rate typical of other class 29 lakes.  Sampled northern pike ranged in length from 12 to 31 inches and had an average length and weight of 20.0 inches and 1.9 pounds.  Natural reproduction was consistent with seven different year classes present in the sample. The growth of northern pike was typical of other area class 29 lakes.A total of 93 bluegill were sampled during this assessment.  Although numbers of bluegill were low, they were of quality with the majority eight inches or larger. Anglers should be concerned about reducing the quality of these bluegill by over harvest.  Growth was excellent compared to other area lakes.  A eight inch bluegill was four years old.Sampled black crappie ranged in length from 7 to 14 inches and had an average length and weight of 10.5 inches and 0.7 pounds.  This size black crappie was five years oldGrowth was typical of other area class 29 lakes.The main forage fish was yellow perch. They were sampled at a rate typical of other class 29 lakes. One walleye was sampled and was 22 inches long and eight years old.Three largemouth bass were sampled, and they all were between 19.0 - 19.9 inches long.Other fish species sampled were white sucker, brown bullhead, black bullhead, yellow bullhead, pumpkinseed, and bowfin.  No lake homes exist on the lake.  There is a county-owned public access on the west of the lake.To help maintain quality fish populations in Beuber Lake, lake users should preserve aquatic plants and natural shorelines.  Aquatic and terrestrial plants provide food and cover for fish and wildlife.  They also help protect shorelines from erosion, and absorb nutrients and pollutants.  Natural shorelines, shorelines that have not been altered by humans, help protect lakes from silt-laden runoff waters.  They also provide excellent places for wildlife to feed, hide, and raise their young.  Protection of the Beuber Lake watershed is also needed for maintaining water quality.Anglers can help maintain or improve the quality of fishing by practicing catch and release of medium to large-sized fish.  Releasing these fish will help maintain the fish population in Beuber Lake and provides anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future.     </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Beuber Lake has an area of 111 acres and a maximum depth of 32 feet.  About two-thirds of the lake is 15 feet or less in depth.  Beuber Lake is located about three miles north and one mile west of Hackensack, MN.  The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MN DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different lake classes based on physical, chemical and other characteristics.  Beuber Lake is in Lake Class 29.  Lakes in this class generally have a large percentage of area 15 feet or less in depth and a regular shoreline.  There is a public access owned by Cass County on the south shore of this lake. Most of the Beuber Lake shoreline is public land administered by Cass County and there are no lake homes or cabins around Beuber Lake.      Beuber Lake is managed primarily for northern pike and bluegill and secondarily for largemouth bass, black crappie and yellow perch. The abundance of bluegill in found in the 2001 sampling in this lake compared favorably with other lakes of this type and quality-size individuals were present.  Pumpkinseed sunfish were also common in Beuber Lake and can help provide good numbers and sizes of fish for anglers.  Northern pike were abundant for a lake of this type.  Though many small northern pike were sampled, larger fish (up to 32 inches) were collected.  Small yellow perch were numerous, but yellow perch up to 10 inches were found.  Limited numbers of largemouth bass and black crappie were found.  Bullhead species that are present can also provide action for panfish anglers.       Anglers can help maintain or improve the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for table fare, but encourages release of medium- to large-size fish.  Releasing these fish can help maintain balance in the fish community in Beuber Lake and provide anglers with opportunities to catch more and larger fish in the future.</p>",

BLACK CRAPPIE NET CATCHES WERE GOOD AND AGE-CLASS DISTRIBUTION INDICATES GOOD, CONSISTANT NATURAL REPRODUCTION.  GROWTH RATES ARE GOOD.
