                "narrative": "<p>Boulder Lake is located 1.5 miles northeast of Dorset in Hubbard County.  Boulder Lake has a surface area of 360 acres and a maximum depth of 28 feet.  A public access with a concrete ramp is located on the west shore.  Boulder Lake has primarily a sand bottom with scattered rock and gravel areas on the north shore.  Bulrush stands fringe the north shoreline and provide important habitat particuarily for panfish.  There are two resorts and 73 cabins/homes on the lake.  The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical and chemical characteristics.  Boulder Lake is in lake class 31.  Other area lakes in this same classification include Second Crow Wing Lake, and Fifth through Eighth Crow Wing Lakes located southeast of Park Rapids.  Boulder Lake is known for its walleye, northern pike, and black crappie fishery.Good numbers of walleye (7.4/gillnet) were sampled, above the \"normal range\" for this lake class.  The 1988 and 1993 surveys had similar walleye abundance.  Average size of walleye was small, 14.0 inches and 0.9 pounds , with the largest fish sampled measuring  22.3 inches.  Walleye growth rates were slower than other area lakes.  Natural reproduction of walleye is contributing to the population as 63% of the sample (42 fish) were from non-stocked years.  From 1984 until 1994 walleye fingerlings were stocked in even years.  Starting in 1997,  walleye stocking was changed to every third year.Northern pike were sampled in moderate numbers (5.2/gillnet).  Northern pike abundance was similar in the 1980's, while in the 1970's abundance was above or at the upper end of the \"normal range\" for this lake class.  Average size of northern pike was small (17.1 inches & 1.1 pounds).  Largest northern pike sampled was 23.2 inches.  Northern pike growth rates were slow when compared to other area lakes.Largemouth bass were sampled in low numbers with electrofishing gear.  This is the first time electrofishing equipment has been used on Boulder Lake.  Thirteen largemouth bass were sampled (10.5/hour), with fish measured up to 18.2 inches.  Two smallmouth bass were sampled during the 1998 survey (6.8 & 7.3 inches).  This is the first recorded catch of  smallmouth bass in Boulder Lake. Boulder Lake has a low to moderate panfish population, but can provide some good fishing for larger fish.  Black crappie were sampled in moderate numbers, within the \"normal range\" for this lake class.  Black crappie numbers have fluctuated in past surveys, but abundance has generally been within the \"normal range\".  Black crappie growth rates were similar to other area lakes. Bluegill abundance was low (0.7/trapnet).  Bluegill abundance in past surveys has been higher, but still below the \"normal range\" for this lake class.  Bluegill up to 9.3 inches were sampled.  Yellow perch abundance was at the low end of the \"normal range\" for this lake class.  Yellow perch abundance in past surveys has fluctuated from moderate to high numbers.  Yellow perch provide an important forage base for the walleye and northern pike populations.  Yellow perch growth rates were slow and average size was small (6.7 inches).     Other species sampled in low to moderate numbers include: rock bass, pumpkinseed, and yellow bullhead.  White sucker were abundant (6.7/gillnet), similar to past surveys.Anglers can help maintain or improve the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for table fare, but encourages release of medium to large size fish.  Releasing these fish will help maintain the fish population in Boulder Lake and provides anglers with opportunities to catch more and larger fish in the future. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Boulder Lake is located in southern Hubbard County, 1.5 miles northeast of Dorset.  Boulder has a surface area of 340 acres and a maximum depth of 28 feet.  A public access with a concrete ramp is located on the northwest shore.  Boulder provides angling opportunities for Walleye, Northern Pike, panfish, Largemouth Bass, and Smallmouth Bass. <br> \n <br> \nThe Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics.  Boulder is in lake class 31.  Class 31 lakes generally have hard water and a regularly shaped shoreline.  Other class 31 lakes in the Park Rapids area include Second, Fifth, Sixth, and Seventh Crow Wing Lakes, Duck, Evergreen, Hattie, Hinds, and Lower Twin. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance has remained stable the past several surveys on Boulder, with gill net catch rates above the range for this lake class and near management goals.  Good numbers of Walleye in the 14 to 18 inch size range were sampled with fish measured up to 26.4 inches.  Yellow Perch, an important forage species were sampled in high numbers.  Yellow Perch abundance had been low the last several surveys on Boulder.  Yellow Perch had an average length of 7.4 inches with fish measured up to 10.2 inches.  Northern Pike abundance was down, with catch rates the lowest recorded for all surveys on Boulder dating back to 1949.  While Pike numbers were down, size was better than past surveys with an average length and weight of 24.0 inches and 3.0 pounds and fish measured up to 32.1 inches.  Boulder supports both Largemouth and Smallmouth Bass populations, with Largemouth Bass the more abundant of the two species.  Anglers will find good numbers of bass in the 12 -15 inch size range.  The proportion of larger bass sampled (>15 inches) was low compared to past surveys and other lakes in this class.  Boulder has good water quality, submerged and emergent aquatic vegetation that provides excellent habitat for bass and panfish.  Boulder has a low to moderate panfish population, but can provide some good fishing, especially for Black Crappie.  Anglers will find good populations of Bluegill and Pumpkinseed; however, size of fish run small, with few fish over 7.0 inches sampled. <br> \n <br> \nCurrently no aquatic invasive species (AIS) have been identified in Boulder.  To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the lake. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Boulder Lake is located in southern Hubbard County, 1.5 miles northeast of Dorset.  Boulder Lake has a surface area of 360 acres and a maximum depth of 28 feet.  A public access with a concrete ramp is located on the west shore.  Boulder Lake has primarily a sand bottom with scattered rock and gravel on the north shore.  Hardstem bulrush stands fringe the north shoreline and provide important fish habitat, particularly for bass and panfish.  Boulder Lake provides fishing opportunities for walleye, northern pike, bass, and panfish. <br> \n <br> \nThe Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics.  Boulder is in lake class 31.  Other area lakes in this same classification include Second Crow Wing Lake, and Fifth through Eighth Crow Wing Lakes located southeast of Park Rapids. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance (6.3 walleye/gillnet) was up from the previous survey in 2003 (3.0 walleye/gillnet).  The 1988, 1993, and 1998 surveys had walleye gillnet catch rates near the management goal, while earlier surveys fluctuated from 4.7 walleye/net (1949) to 17.5 walleye/net (1979).  Sampled walleye had an average length and weight of 16.8 inches and 1.7 pounds with fish measured up to 26.8 inches.  The walleye population in Boulder is maintained through a combination of natural reproduction and walleye stocking by the DNR.  Yellow perch, an important forage species for walleye, were sampled in moderate numbers, up from the record low in 2003.  Yellow perch were small in size, with few fish of an acceptable size for angling.  Northern pike were sampled in moderate numbers (6.2 pike/gillnet), similar to past surveys.  Sampled northern pike had an average length and weight of 21.0 inches and 2.0 pounds, with pike measured up to 29.9 inches.  The number of larger northern pike (> 28.0 inches) was low when compared to other area lakes.  Both largemouth bass and smallmouth bass are present in Boulder, with largemouth bass being the more abundant of the two species.  The smallmouth bass population has been increasing in recent years.  No smallmouth bass were sampled in surveys prior to 1998.  Spring electrofishing surveys sampled bass in moderate numbers when compared to other area lakes (53 largemouth/hour, 10 smallmouth/hour).  Largemouth bass up to 19.5 inches were sampled.  Boulder Lake has good water quality, submerged and emergent vegetation that provides excellent habitat for bass and panfish.  Boulder Lake has a low to moderate panfish population, but can provide some good fishing, especially for crappies.  Black crappie and bluegill were sampled in moderate numbers, within the range \"typical\" for this lake class.  Black crappie abundance in past surveys has been similar, while bluegill abundance was lower.  Anglers will find black crappie in the 9-11 inch size range, while bluegill tend to run small, with few fish over 7.0 inches in length.  Other species sampled include high numbers of white sucker and yellow bullhead, and moderate numbers of brown bullhead and rock bass. <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

A survey targeting near shore fish species was conducted by Park Rapids Fisheries Staff on July 25, 2018 to assess populations of non-game and small sport fish.  Ten 100-foot sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake shore, sampling a variety of habitat types.  Each site was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot 1/8th-inch mesh seine, depending on habitat conditions.   <br> \n <br> \nDuring this assessment, five sites were sampled with a 50-foot seine and three sites were sampled with a 15-foot seine. Site conditions prevented the use of seines at two sites.  Backpack electrofishing was done at all 10 sites, several of which were conducted from the side of the boat.  Nearshore sampling captured eleven species of fish including one species intolerant of disturbance; Banded Killifish.  Other species sampled during the nearshore effort included Bluegill, Bluntnose Minnow, Iowa Darter, Johnny Darter, Largemouth Bass, Pumpkinseed, Rock Bass, Smallmouth Bass, Spottail Shiner, and Yellow Perch.  Nearshore catches will be used along with gill net and trap net catch data from a standard fisheries survey conducted on August 20, 2018, to calculate a fish-based Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) score which is indicative of the health of Boulder Lake.   <br> \n <br> \nThis survey is contributing to a watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.  Boulder Lake is located in the Crow Wing River Watershed.</p>",

The average weight of the walleyes sampled was 1.0 pounds with 36% in the 15 to 22 inch range.  Walleye natural reproduction is contributing to the population as 57% of the sampled walleyes are from non stocked year classes.  Northern pike abundance is comparable to similar lakes.  The average size of northern pike sampled in 1993 was 20.9 inches and 2.1 pounds.  Largemouth bass were not sufficiently sampled with standard survey gear to assess their abundance, growth, or size structure.  Black crappies sampled were from multiple year classes with 46% greater than 10 inches in length.  Bluegills were sampled in low numbers with a small size structure.  No bluegills sampled were over 7.5 inches.  Yellow perch abundance is above the median for lakes in this class and should provide an excellent forage base.  Thirty four percent of the yellow perch sampled were over 8 inches.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Boulder Lake is located in southern Hubbard County, 1.5 miles northeast of Dorset.  Boulder Lake has a surface area of 360 acres and a maximum depth of 28 feet.  A public access with a concrete ramp is located on the west shore.  Boulder Lake has primarily a sand bottom with scattered rock and gravel areas on the north shore.  Hardstem bulrush stands fringe the north shoreline and provide important fish habitat, particularly for largemouth bass and panfish.  Boulder Lake provides fishing opportunities for walleye, northern pike, bass, and panfish.The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical and chemical characteristics.  Boulder Lake is in lake class 31.  Other area lakes in this same classification include Second Crow Wing Lake, and Fifth through Eighth Crow Wing Lakes located southeast of Park Rapids.Walleye abundance plummeted in 2003 as the gillnet catch rate of 3.0 walleye/gillnet was the lowest recorded on Boulder Lake for all surveys dating back to 1949.  This gillnet catch rate is well below the current management goal of 8.0 walleye/gillnet.  The 1988, 1993, and 1998 surveys had walleye gillnet catch rates near the management goal, while earlier surveys fluctuated from 4.7 walleye/net (1949) to 17.5 walleye/net (1979).  Yellow perch, an important forage species for walleye, were sampled at their lowest recorded levels on Boulder.  Yellow perch abundance in past surveys has generally been at moderate to high levels.  Walleye growth rates in Boulder were slow when compared to other class 31 lakes.  The walleye population in Boulder Lake is maintained through a combination of natural reproduction and walleye fingerling stocking by the DNR.  Age analysis showed 64% (18 fish) of the walleye sample corresponding to non-stocked years.  From 1984 to 1994 walleye were stocked biannually.  Starting in 1997, walleye stocking was changed to every third year.  The last walleye stocking on Boulder Lake occurred in the fall of 2003.  Northern pike were sampled in moderate numbers (5.2 pike/gillnet), similar to past surveys.  Anglers will find small, \"hammer handle\" pike common, as average length and weight of sampled pike was only 18.9 inches and 1.5 pounds.  A few larger northern pike are present with fish measured up to 38.8 inches.  Northern pike growth rates were slow when compared to area lakes.  Both largemouth bass and smallmouth bass are present in Boulder Lake.  The smallmouth bass population in Boulder has been increasing in recent years.  Spring electrofishing survey found bass abundance to be at low to moderate levels when compared to other area lakes.  Boulder Lake has good water quality, and submerged and emergent aquatic vegetation that provides excellent habitat for bass and panfish.  Boulder Lake has a low to moderate panfish population, but can provide some good fishing for larger fish, especially crappies.  Black crappie and bluegill were sampled in low numbers, below the range \"typical\" for this lake class.  Black crappie abundance in past surveys has fluctuated within the range \"typical\" for this lake class.  Past surveys have sampled bluegill in low numbers.  Other species sampled included high numbers of yellow bullhead and white sucker, and low numbers of brown bullhead, pumpkinseed, and rock bass.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Boulder Lake is located in southern Hubbard County, 1.5 miles northeast of Dorset.  Boulder has a surface area of 340 acres and a maximum depth of 28 feet.  A public access with a concrete ramp is located on the west shore.  Boulder has primarily a sand bottom with scattered rock and gravel on the north shore.  Hardstem bulrush stands fringe the north shoreline and provide important fish habitat, particularly for bass and panfish.  Boulder provides fishing opportunities for walleye, northern pike, largemouth bass, smallmouth bass, and panfish. <br> \n <br> \nThe Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics.  Boulder is in lake class 31.  Class 31 lakes generally have hard water, and have regularly shaped shorelines.  Other class 31 lakes in the Park Rapids area include Second, Fifth, Sixth, and Seventh Crow Wing Lakes, Duck, Evergreen, Hattie, Hinds, Shingobee, Trip, and Lower Twin. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance (5.7 walleye/gillnet) was near the current management goal of 8.0 walleye/gillnet.  Walleye abundance in past surveys has generally fluctuated around the management goal.  Sampled walleye had an average length of 16.2 inches with fish measured up to 26.1 inches.  The walleye population in Boulder is being maintained through a combination of natural reproduction and walleye stocking by the DNR.  Boulder is stocked with walleye fingerlings during even numbered years.  Yellow perch, an important forage species for walleye, were sampled in moderate numbers.  Yellow perch were small in size, with few fish of an acceptable size for angling.  Northern pike were sampled in moderate numbers (7.8 pike/gillnet), within the range \"typical\" for this lake class and similar to past surveys.  Sampled northern pike had an average length and weight of 22.5 inches and 2.5 pounds, with pike measured up to 31.2 inches.  Both largemouth bass and smallmouth bass are present in Boulder, with largemouth bass the more abundant of the two species.  Boulder has good water quality, submerged and emergent vegetation that provides excellent habitat for bass and panfish.  Boulder has a low to moderate panfish population, but can provide some good fishing, especially for crappies.  Black crappie abundance was up from past surveys, but the sample was dominated by smaller crappie in the 7-8 inch size range, with low numbers of black crappie over 10 inches in length.  This strong year class of black crappie should provide good fishing in a few years.  Anglers will find bluegill and pumpkinseed in the 6 inch size range, with few fish over 7 inches in length.   <br> \n</p>",

A public access with a concrete ramp is located on the west shore.  Boulder provides angling opportunities for Walleye, Northern Pike, panfish, Largemouth Bass, and Smallmouth Bass. <br> \n <br> \nThe Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics.  Boulder is in lake class 31.  Class 31 lakes generally have hard water and a regularly shaped shoreline.  Other class 31 lakes in the Park Rapids management area include Second, Fifth, Sixth, and Seventh Crow Wing Lakes, Duck, Evergreen, Hattie, Hinds, and Lower Twin. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance was down from past surveys but within the range typical for this lake class.  Sampled Walleye ranged in length from 9.2 to 26.6 inches and had an average length of 17.4 inches.  Yellow Perch, an important forage species for Walleye were sampled in moderate numbers with fish measured up to 10.2 inches. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike were sampled in moderate numbers for this lake class, similar to past surveys.  Sampled Northern Pike had an average length of 21.7 inches with fish measured up to 30.1 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nBoulder supports both Largemouth Bass and Smallmouth Bass with Largemouth Bass the more abundant of the two species.  Anglers will find good numbers of bass in the 12-15 inch size range.  Boulder has good water quality, submerged and emergent vegetation that provides excellent habitat for bass and panfish. <br> \n <br> \nPresent and past surveys have shown the panfish population to fluctuate from low to moderate numbers.  Anglers will find good numbers of Bluegill and Pumpkinseed in the 6-8 inch size range and Black Crappie in the 9-10 inch size range.   <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled included moderate numbers of White Sucker and Yellow Bullhead, and low numbers of Rock Bass. <br> \n <br> \nFaucet snails, an aquatic invasive species (AIS) have been identified in Boulder.  To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants and animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the lake. <br> \n</p>",
