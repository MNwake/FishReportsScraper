                "narrative": "<p>Strandness Lake is a shallow basin located in the flowage of Trapper's Run Creek.  It lies between Malmedahl and Pelican Lakes, each of which is listed as impaired waters.   Maximum depth of Strandness Lake is 5.0 feet.  Undoubtedly, Strandness Lake holds little dissovled oxygen during winter months.  Partial and severe winterkill events have likely occurred,but such events have been poorly documented.  A permanent fish barrier was installed on Trapper's Run Creek (downstream of Strandness Lake) in 1993 to prevent re-infestation of undesirable fish species in Strandness and Malmedahl Lakes following severe winterkill.  Sustained presence of yellow perch, northern pike, carp, bullheads and white suckers in the fish community indicates a total winterkill of the system has not occurred.   <br> \n <br> \nStrandness Lake has a marginal sport fishery. Species diversity is limited by turbid water and  shallowness of the basin. No bass, crappie, or sunfishes were captured during the survey.  Walleye gillnet catches averaged 15.0-fish/net in 2010. All captured walleye were two years old. This correlates with a 2008 walleye fry stocking of Malmedahl Lake. Walleye in Strandness Lake are the result of walleye moving downstream from Malmedahl.  Growth is exceptional.  Average length of walleye captured was 16.4 inches.  Northern pike are abundant.  Pike catches averaged 26.0 fish/gillnet.  Sizes of captured pike ranged from 15.8 to 23.8 inches in length.  Twenty-three of 26 northern pike captured were age-1.   Yellow perch were also abundant.  The gillnet catch rate for yellow perch was 108.0 fish/net.   Fifty-seven per cent of yellow perch captures exceeded 8.0 inches in length.  Average length was 8.5 inches.  Black bullhead remain abundant but survey catches were within expected catch rates for similar lakes.  Gillnet catches were 134.0 fish/net.  Mean length of captures was 7.9 inches.  Common carp and white suckers were also common in catch records.  <br> \n <br> \nThere is no designated public access site on Strandbess Lake.  Small watercraft can be launched off the Pope County Highway 114 road right-of-way.</p>",
