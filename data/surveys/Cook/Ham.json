The population was entirely supported by natural reproduction, with good year classes produced in 1995 and 1994.

The 1998 catch was at the low end of the normal range for lakes of this class, and it appeared to have been lower than the catch in 1988.  The single smallmouth bass collected was an 11 inch, two-year-old fish.The 1998 catch of northern pike was below the normal range for lakes of this class, but it was not unusually low for this lake, historically.   The largest northern pike collected was a five-year-old, 27-inch fish.</p>",
