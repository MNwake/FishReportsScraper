                "narrative": "<p>Kalmar Reservoir (KR-7) is a flood control reservoir located west of Rochester on the north side of Olmsted County 156.  A gravel parking lot is located on the northeastern side of the dam embankment with a crushed asphalt trail along the top of the dam.  The reservoir is approximately 50 acres in size with a maximum depth of 10 feet near the outlet structure.  Most of the reservoir is less than 5 feet in depth.  The water depths are dependent on precipitation and are highly variable. Algae blooms are common in the summer months, due to agricultural runoff. <br> \n <br> \nElectrofishing was conducted on May 13, 2021 to assess the size structure and abundance of Black Crappie, Bluegill, and Largemouth Bass.  Due to the presence of a significant amount of anglers, the electrofishing run along the dam face was moved farther offshore than normal.  The waters along the dam face contain deeper habitat and historically better catch rates of larger fish.   <br> \n <br> \nA single,10.3 inch Black Crappie was sampled in this survey for a catch rate of 1.2 fish/hr.  This was the largest Black Crappie ever sampled in Kalmar Reservoir.  The largest Black Crappie in 2014 was 8.39, with an average of 7.94 inches. <br> \n <br> \nA total of 216 Bluegill were sampled in this survey for a catch rate of 259 fish/hr, up from the 132 fish/hr in 2014.  The average length of bluegill was 3 inches, whereas the average size in 2014 was 7.9 inches.  Bluegill under 3 inches made up about 58 percent of the catch and are likely fish that hatched in 2020.  A 9.6 inch Bluegill was sampled, this was the largest individual sampled ever.   <br> \n</p>",

Sampling was conducted along the dam and the west shoreline for a total on-time of 29 minutes. <br> \n <br> \nA total of 64 Bluegill were collected at a rate of 132 fish/hr.  Average Bluegill length was 6.9 inches and the largest Bluegill collected was 7.9 inches.  Fifty-one Largemouth Bass were captured with a catch rate 105 fish/hr and a mean length of 11.4 inches.  The largest bass collected was 17.3 inches.  Black Crappie were captured at the rate of 52 fish/hr.  Crappie mean length was 7.9 inches with the largest fish 8.4 inches. <br> \n <br> \nChanges in the size structure of the Bluegill population was noted in the 2010 survey and again in 2014.  Mean length has increased from 5.17 inches in 2008 to 6.9 inches in 2014.  The number of bluegills captured has declined while size has increased.   <br> \n <br> \nThe Largemouth Bass catch rate has remained fairly stable ranging from 125/hr in 2010 to 105/hr in 2014.  However, the average size of Largemoouth Bass has increased from 4.2 inches in 2010 to 11.4 inches in 2014.  Largemouth Bass were first stocked into Kalmar in 2008 and the population appears to be well established. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie abundance was low in the 2010 assessment, as just five were collected electrofishing.  However, the 2012 and 2014 assessments have shown the abundance of crappie to have greatly increased.  Mean length of Black Crappie increased from 6.9 inches in 2012 to 7.9 inches in 2014. <br> \n <br> \nKalmar Reservoir continues to provide good angling for Bluegill and Largemouth Bass.
