                "narrative": "<p>Heritage Center Ponds are located in Heritage Park within the city limits of St. Cloud. The largest pond is 11.6 acres in size and approximately 7 feet deep. Daytime electrofishing was conducted on June 7, 2016 to assess the fishery and to consider using the pond as a shore fishing site. The shoreline was circled except for the northwest arm, which was not accessible by boat. The water was clear and Secchi depth exceeded bottom depth. <br> \n <br> \nSubmerged vegetation was dense and collecting fish was difficult. Small sunfish species and Largemouth Bass were numerous and many were not captured. Largemouth Bass lengths ranged from 3.8 to 18.9 inches, Black Crappie lengths ranged from 4.5 to 9.0 inches, and Bluegill lengths ranged from 2.4 to 8.0 inches. Green Sunfish, Hybrid Sunfish, and Pumpkinseed were also captured. The lack of bullheads was noteworthy. <br> \n <br> \nSuitable shore access is available on the north end of the pond. The deepest part of the pond is located here and aquatic vegetation is not as dense as elsewhere. Other sites could be used, but dense submerged vegetation would make angling difficult. The frequency of winterkill is unknown, but the presence of larger adult fish suggests that the fishery may persist. Following the survey, 152 adult Channel Catfish were stocked to provide additional angling opportunities. <br> \n</p>",
