                "narrative": "<p>Muskrat Lake is a popular bass/panfish fishing lake located less than a mile southwest of Detroit Lakes, MN.  Small boat navigation is possible via the Pelican River from Detroit Lake.  During the height of the boating season, boat access is also possible from Lake Sallie.  Becker County seasonally operates a tramway for transporting boats over the dike on the west shore to and from Lake Sallie.  The heaviest fishing use comes from shore anglers along Dunton Locks County Park lands.  The lake is shallow and fertile and aquatic plants often grow to the surface in even the deepest waters (19 feet) by mid summer.  Yet, angling continues to some extent throughout the summer. <br> \n <br> \nBluegills and other sunfish are very abundant in Muskrat Lake.  Most are not particularly large but can provide fast action.  Largemouth bass, black crappie, bullheads, and an occasional northern pike add to Muskrat Lake's fishery.  Walleyes and muskies are rare, but have been found in the lake at various times.  Now that fish have the capability of migrating both upstream and downstream and returning again, there is a possibility that fish species like walleye will provide additional seasonal fishing opportunities in Muskrat Lake.  Walleyes, northern pike, muskies, lake sturgeon, and many other species have been observed migrating upstream through the riffle where an impassable dam formerly stood.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Muskrat Lake is a relatively small, shallow, fertile lake on the Pelican River chain of lakes, locatedbetween lakes Detroit and Sallie.  It's outlet dam to Lake Sallie, built in the early part of this century,maintains water levels in both Detroit and Muskrat lakes and is a migration barrier for fish attempting to swimupstream from Lake Sallie.  Fertility is probably due mainly to cultural eutrophication from the City of DetroitLakes, though changes in the sewage treatment plant have reportedly improved conditions in downstream lakes,including Muskrat.     There is light shoreline development on the southeast shore.  Much of the north and west shores of the lakeare included in Dunton Locks County Park.  This land, while not subject to home construction, contains a boattramway to Lake Sallie, several picnic shelters and tables, a fishing dock, and hiking and cross country skitrails.     Muskrat Lake's physical and chemical characteristics make it subject to algal blooms, dense vegetationgrowth, and partial winterkill.  Mid-summer angling is made difficult by those conditions, but spring and earlysummer shoreline angling is popular in the county park.  The fish community composition is not unusual for similarlakes with northern pike, bluegill, and black bullhead dominating the fish community.     Muskrat Lake's northern pike ranged from 16 to 27 inches in length with the average pike 21 inches longweighing just over two pounds.  Yellow perch are the preferred prey of pike in Muskrat Lake.  Their numbers arecurrently low and seem to be decreasing but they are slightly larger than in the past, ranging from six to nineinches long.   The black crappie population has remained unusually stable since original trapnetting in 1966. The catch rate is normal for similar lakes.  Black crappie are a popular target of shore anglers in spring. Although fish captured in nets were not exceptionally large, the average was about 8.5 inches long weighing nearlyone half pound, larger crappies are present.  Bluegills have been considered overabundant and stunted sincenetting began in 1966, though some fish up to eight inches long were captured.     Bullheads are also abundant, expected in this type of lake.  All three species of bullhead are present butblack bullheads are most abundant.  Mean length of netted black bullheads was 8.3 inches and mean weight was 0.3pounds.     Other fish species captured in test nets included bowfin, hybrid and pumpkinseed sunfishes, and largemouthbass.  Pumpkinseeds seem to have decreased while hybrid sunfish have increased in recent years.  Due to lowvulnerability to standard survey nets, largemouth bass are not easily analyzed but abundance does not appear tohave changed significantly.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Muskrat Lake is a popular bass and panfish lake located less than a mile southwest of Detroit Lakes. Small boat navigation is possible via the Pelican River from Detroit Lake. During the height of the boating season, Becker County operates a tramway for transporting boats over the dike on the west shore to and from Lake Sallie. The heaviest fishing use comes from shore anglers along Dunton Locks County Park lands. The lake is shallow and fertile and aquatic plants often grow to the surface in even the deepest waters (19 feet) by mid-summer.  <br> \n <br> \nBluegills and other sunfish are very abundant in Muskrat Lake. Most are not particularly large but can provide fast action. Largemouth Bass, Black Crappie, bullheads, and an occasional Northern Pike add to Muskrat Lake's fishery. Walleyes and Muskies are rare, but have been found in the lake at various times. Walleyes, Northern Pike, Muskies, Lake Sturgeon, and many other species have been observed migrating upstream from Lake Sallie through the riffle where an impassable dam formerly stood. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Muskrat Lake is a popular bass/panfish fishery located located less than a mile southwest of Detroit Lakes, MN.  Small boat navigation is possible via the Pelican River from Detroit Lake.  During the height of the boating season, boat access is also possible from Lake Sallie.  Becker County seasonally operates a tramway for transporting boats over the dike on the west shore to and from Lake Sallie.  The heaviest fishing use comes from shore anglers along Dunton Locks County Park lands.  The lake is shallow and fertile and aquatic plants often grow to the surface in even the deepest waters (19 feet) by mid summer.  Yet, angling continues to some extent throughout the summer.Bluegills and other sunfish are very abundant in Muskrat Lake.  They are not particularly large but can provide fast action.  Largemouth bass, black crappie, bullheads, and an occasional northern pike add to Muskrat Lake's fishery.  Walleyes and muskies are rare, but have been found in the lake at various times.  Now that fish have the capability of migrating both upstream and downstream and returning again, there is a possibility that fish species like walleye will provide additional seasonal fishing opportunities in Muskrat Lake.  Walleyes and many other species have been observed migrating through the riffle where an impassable dam formerly stood.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Muskrat Lake lies on the Pelican River between Detroit and Sallie Lakes.  Its outlet dam, built in the early 1900s, manitains water levels in both Detroit and Muskrat Lakes and is a migration barrier for fish attempting to swim upstream from Lake Sallie.There was moderate shoreline development on the southeast shore.  Much of the north and west shores of the lake were included in Dunton Locks County Park.  This land, while not subject to home construction, contained a boat tramway to Lake Sallie, several picnic shelters and tables, a fishing dock, and hiking and cross country ski trails.Muskrat Lake was a receptor of effluent from the Detroit Lakes sewage treatment plant.  While the quality of this effluent has greatly improved in recent decades, the lake's physical and chemical characteristics made it subject to algal blooms, dense vegetation growth, and partial winterkill of certain fish species.  Mid-summer angling was made difficult by those conditions, but spring and early summer shoreline angling were popular in the county park.  The fish community composition was not unusual for lakes with similar physical makeup, providing primarily northern pike, black bullhead, largemouth bass, and panfish.Muskrat Lake's northern pike ranged from 13.8 to 28.3 inches in length with the average pike 19.2 inches long and weighing 1.5 pounds.  Bluegills have been considered overabundant and stunted since test netting began in 1966.  However, bluegill growth appeared to be near normal in this study.  Although the still-abundant bluegill population consisted heavily of small fish, they were also relatively young.  This may have been a result of recent heavy fishing pressure on the lake, i.e., large bluegills were being removed as soon as they became acceptable to anglers.Bullheads were also abundant, expected in this type of lake.  All three species were present but black bullheads were most abundant.  The ratio of black to yellow bullheads has been used as one bio-indicator of water quality where both are present in a lake.  The higher the ratio (the more black bullheads), the poorer the water quality.  A ratio of seven black to one yellow bullhead in Muskrat Lake was consistent with the lake's phosphorus readings.Improvements in sewage treatment, as well as experimental manipulation being attempted by the Pelican River Watershed District, may continue to help improve water quality in Muskrat Lake and other downstream water bodies.  Other ways in which lakeshore owners and anglers can help maintain or improve the fish community, the water quality, and property values include (1) exceeding setbacks for all development, (2) maintaining the natural character of the shoreline impact zone (vegetative buffers, etc.), (3) following all best management practices for shoreline development, and (4) returning a portion of the larger fish one might normally have kept.</p>",
