The catch rate of 13.8 bass per hour of sampling was similar to previous electrofishing efforts on Lax Lake. Bass ranged from 7 to 19\" long with an average length of 12.4\" and weight of 1.36 pounds. Age analysis determined ten unique year classes were sampled including fish as old as age-12. Survey results confirm that Lax Lake is one of only a few lakes in the Finland area that provide angling opportunities for Largemouth Bass. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>The 2002 survey sampled walleye in average numbers, for the lake class, with an average weight of 1.1 pounds.  The fish ranged from 9.9 inches to 24.2 inches (5.0 pounds).  Walleye between 13.0 inches and 14.9 inches were the most common, accounting for 38% of the sample.  Lax Lake is stocked every other year with walleye fingerlings.  It appeared that stocking and natural reproduction were both contributing to the walleye population.Northern pike were sampled in low numbers, and lengths ranged from 12.6 inches to 31.9 inches (7.3 pounds).  The average weight of the northern pike sampled was 2.0 pounds.Bluegill were sampled in high numbers, and the catch included a few fish between 8.0 and 8.7 inches.  Most of the bluegill in the sample were smaller than 7.0 inches.  In the summer months bluegill provide a lot of action to anglers on Lax Lake.Black crappie were sampled in low numbers, however, it is difficult to measure the abundance of this species with netting gear.  The black crappie that were captured were a respectable size, ranging from 9.8 inches to 10.5 inches in length.Yellow perch were captured in average numbers for the lake class.  Yellow perch up to 10.7 inches were sampled, however, fish of this size were uncommon in the sample.  Approximately 90% of the yellow perch in the sample were smaller than 8.0 inches.Largemouth bass are present in Lax Lake, however, this species is very difficult to capture with netting gear.  Largemouth bass were captured in below average numbers; however, the population may be higher than netting results indicate.  A few largemouth bass, between 3 pounds and 4 pounds, are known to have been caught by anglers during the winter of 2002 - 2003.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lax Lake is 295 acres, has a maximum depth of 35 feet, and is located approximately 5 miles southwest of Finland, MN.  There is back-in concrete access off of Lake County Road #408 (Lax Lake Road), on the north end of the lake.  There is parking for around eight vehicles with trailers.  There is a handicap accessible fishing pier with a picnic area and separate parking lot.  One resort is located on the north shore of the lake.   <br> \n <br> \nThe 2018 targeted survey was performed to sample the Largemouth Bass, Bluegill, and Black Crappie populations in Lax Lake.  The survey used boat electrofishing for Largemouth Bass and Black Crappie and standard trap nets for Bluegill and Black Crappie.   <br> \n <br> \nBoat electrofishing was able to sample 17 Largemouth Bass which had an average length of 15.2 inches and average weight of 2.1 pounds.  The length ranged from 8.7 to 18.4 inches.  The electrofishing catch was lower than the three previous surveys but the conditions for sampling in 2018 were poor as a storm had moved through the area before shocking occurred.  The average size of Largemouth Bass has been increasing since the first spring survey from 11 inches in 2010 to 15 inches in 2018.  The Largemouth Bass population in Lax Lake may not be abundant, yet the population has the potential to have some decent bass caught as fish near 19 inches have been seen in most investigations.   <br> \n <br> \nSpring trap nets caught 454 Bluegill with an average size of 6.4 inches and 0.22 pounds.  The length range was 2.8 to 8.9 inches.  Ten year classes were found through scale aging and age-6 made up 35% of the catch along with age-5 comprising 28% of the catch.  Growth of Bluegill was average for the area.  Many of the Bluegill in Lax Lake also had small to moderate amount of Neascus (black spot parasite).  These parasites are small and produce black pigmentation that resembles black pepper sprinkled on fins or flesh (fillets) of fish. However, although unsightly, the fillet is safe to eat if it is well cooked.  <br> \n <br> \nOne Black Crappie was sampled with trap nets and measured 10.4 inches.  Boat electrofishing collected seven Black Crappie ranging from 9.6 to 11.5 inches.  The Black Crappie population in Lax Lake tends to have sporadic reproduction success which often leads to a boom and bust fishery.   <br> \n <br> \nLax Lake is a popular fishing lake in the Finland Area as it is not far from Silver Bay or Finland.  It can produce some decent Walleye, Largemouth Bass, and Black Crappie.  There usually are a fair number of ice fishing houses on the lake in the winter mainly targeting Northern Pike.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lax Lake is in the Finland State Forest approximately 5 miles southwest of Finland. The lake is 296 acres with a littoral area of 192 acres. The maximum depth is 35 feet and is fairly clear with a Secchi disc visible to a depth of 8 feet. There is a state owned access with a concrete ramp on the north end of the lake. Lax Lake is one of the more developed lakes in the Finland area and probably receives more recreational use than any other lake in this area.  <br> \n <br> \nThe fish community in Lax Lake is comprised of walleyes, northern pike, yellow perch, bluegills, black crappies, pumpkinseeds, largemouth bass, white suckers and various minnow species. The lake is managed primarily for walleyes and is stocked with fingerlings on a two-out-of-every-four year rotation.      <br> \n <br> \nIn 2006 walleyes were sampled in average numbers for the lake class as they have been in most of the past assessments on the lake. The mean weight was 1.9 pounds per fish, which is normal for the lake class and somewhat heavier than the mean weight in past assessments.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike were sampled in average numbers and catch rates were higher than in any of the three previous assessments, which in some years were below normal. The mean weight (2.8 pounds/fish) decreased from 2002, but was comparable to the weights in most of the other assessments and was considered normal for this lake and for the lake class.     <br> \n <br> \nLax Lake is one of the few lakes in the Finland area that produces good numbers and some quality size bluegills. Trapnets in 2006 caught fewer bluegills than in 2002, when the catch was above average; however, the number of bluegills caught in this assessment was still in the normal range. The average size of bluegills in 2006 was about 6 inches, with fish up to 9.4 inches collected, and relatively good numbers of fish between 7 and 9 inches.     <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappies were collected in fairly low numbers, though there may be higher density than netting results indicate. The few black crappies that were caught ranged from 9.8 to 10.4 inches. During the winter of 2006-2007 anglers caught some crappies over 12 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass were collected in below average numbers in 2006, though it is difficult to evaluate the population with trapnets due to trap avoidance by the species, particularly adults. Although all the largemouth bass collected in this assessment were smaller than 7 inches, there are larger fish in the lake, as anglers have caught fish up to 4 pounds.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch were sampled in average numbers as they have been in recent assessments, although catch rates have been steadily declining. Yellow perch collected in 2006 averaged 6.7 inches, with fish up to 10.5 inches sampled.  Overall, most of the yellow perch were too small to interest anglers.   <br> \n</p>",

The public access contains a concrete ramp and a dock with room for about eight vehicles with trailers in the parking lot.  Adjacent to the ramp to the south is a handicap accessible fishing pier.  Lax Lake is the most developed and heavily used lake in the Finland Area.  It also contains the most diverse fish community in the area with fishable populations of Black Crappie, Bluegill, Largemouth Bass, Northern Pike, Walleye and Yellow Perch present.  The lake is stocked with Walleye fingerlings two years of every four. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass were first recorded in the 1955 survey.  Anecdotal reports from local anglers have stated that in the past five years or so the number and average size of Largemouth Bass caught has been increasing.  Largemouth Bass are not sampled well with traditional fish sampling methods.  The preferred sampling method for largemouth bass is nighttime boat electrofishing.  Since Lax Lake has an access capable to accommodate a electroshocking boat, on June 3, 2010 Finland Area Fisheries sampled for the first time using this method.  The total catch was 37 fish with a catch rate of 26.8 fish per hour.  The average length was 11.9 inches and the largest fish caught was 18.9 inches.  On June 27, 2013 a special assessment was performed targeting Largemouth Bass for a second time using an electroshocking boat.  The total catch was 36 fish with a catch rate of 22.8 fish per hour. The average length was 13 inches and the largest fish caught was once again 18.9 inches.  Aging of scale samples revealed 12 year classes of fish caught with an age-16 fish being the oldest.  Continued assessment of the Largemouth Bass population by nighttime electrofishing will establish a baseline, and better monitor trends of this species.  <br> \n</p>",

Spiny water flea has since spread to the inland lakes and rivers including those in the Duluth (1997), Tower (2007), and Grand Marias (2007) Fisheries Management Areas.  In the Finland Area, Lax Lake was selected as an annual sample site (beginning in 2008) because it is used as an airplane loading site for trout stocking for other inland lakes.  It is also very common for local anglers to fish both Lake Superior and Lax Lake; possibly with the same boat.  Should spiny water flea be sampled in Lax Lake, aerial stocking could be a vector, exposing other waters to possible infestation. <br> \n <br> \nDuring the annual mid-August sampling three vertical plankton tows were made with a 51 cm net to a depth of 20.5 feet.

This invasive species was first found in Lake Superior in 1988, thought to be introduced through ballast waters.  Spiny water flea has since spread to the inland lakes and rivers including those in the Duluth (1997), Tower (2007), and Grand Marias (2007) Fisheries Management Areas.  In the Finland Area, Lax Lake was selected as an annual sample site (beginning in 2008) because it is used as an airplane loading site for trout stocking for other inland lakes.

                "narrative": "<p>Lax Lake is 295 acres, has a maximum depth of 35 feet, and is located approximately 5 miles southwest of Finland, MN.  There is back-in concrete access off of Lake County Road #408 (Lax Lake Road), on the north end of the lake.  There is parking for around eight vehicles with trailers.  There is a handicap accessible fishing pier with a picnic area and separate parking lot.  One resort is located on the north shore of the lake.   <br> \n <br> \nThe 2018 standard survey was conducted to monitor the fish community in Lax Lake and continue to evaluate the Walleye fingerling stocking in the lake.  Walleye catch was average relative to similar lakes in northeastern Minnesota.  The average size was 16.4 inches and 1.7 pounds, with 72% of the catch over 15.0 inches long.  The largest Walleye sampled was 24.8 inches and weighed 5.6 pounds.  Scale analysis indicated Walleye fingerling stocking is helping maintain a population with over 90% of the sample coming from stocked years.  Walleye growth was average compared to other lakes in the Finland Area. <br> \n <br> \nThe catch of Largemouth Bass in Lax Lake was average compared to similar lakes in the area.  The average size was 14.4 inches and 1.6 pounds.  The spring boat electrofishing was able to sample 17 Largemouth Bass which had an average length of 15.2 inches.  The Largemouth Bass population in Lax Lake may not be abundant, yet the population has the potential to have some decent bass caught as fish near 19 inches have been seen in most investigations.   <br> \n <br> \nThe Bluegill catch was above average compared to similar lake in northeastern Minnesota.  The average size of Blue was 6.3 inches and the largest seen was 8.6 inches.  Ten year classes were present in the catch and the 2013 year class accounted for 30% of the catch.  Growth of Bluegill was average for the area.  Many of the Bluegill in Lax Lake also had small to moderate amount of Neascus (black spot parasite). These parasites are small and produce black pigmentation that resembles black pepper sprinkled on fins or flesh (fillets) of fish. However, although unsightly, the fillet is safe to eat if it is well cooked.  <br> \n <br> \nSix Black Crappie were sampled with the survey nets.  The average size was 10 inches and ranged in size from 8.1 to 11.8 inches.  The spring targeted survey sampled eight Black Crappie with a size range of 9.6 to 11.5 inches and averaged 10.4 inches.  The Black Crappie population in Lax Lake tends to have sporadic reproduction success so angling success often varies with strength of year classes present.  <br> \n <br> \nThe Northern Pike catch was above average for the lake class.  The 2018 survey was the fourth consecutive investigation which had an above average catch.  The average length of pike was 20.6 inches.  The largest individual was 36.6 inches, and 32% of the catch was over 24 inches. <br> \n <br> \nThe Yellow Perch catch was average for the lake class.  The average size was 6.7 inches with the maximum length seen being 11.3 inches.  Seven year classes of perch were seen and growth was average for the area.  <br> \n <br> \nWhite Sucker were sampled in near average numbers compared to similar lakes and size averaged 15.6 inches and 1.8 pounds.  Pumpkinseed and Hybrid Sunfish (Bluegill x Pumpkinseed) were also sampled with the survey gear.  <br> \n <br> \nLax Lake is a popular fishing lake in the Finland Area as it is not far from Silver Bay or Finland.  It can produce some decent Walleye, Largemouth Bass, and Black Crappie.  There usually are a fair number of ice fishing houses on the lake in the winter mainly targeting Northern Pike.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>This survey examined the waters of Lax Lake to collect baseline zooplankton community composition and abundance data and to determine if Lax Lake is infested with spiny water flea, an aquatic invasive species.  This invasive species was first found in Lake Superior in 1988, thought to have been introduced through ship ballast waters.  Spiny water flea has since spread to the inland lakes and rivers including those in the Duluth (1997), Tower (2007), and Grand Marais (2007) Fisheries Management Areas.  In the Finland Area, Lax Lake was selected as an annual sample site (beginning in 2008) because it is used as an airplane loading site for trout stocking of other inland lakes.  It is also very common for local anglers to fish both Lake Superior and Lax Lake; possibly with the same boat.  Should spiny water flea become established in Lax Lake, aerial stocking could be a vector, exposing other waters to possible infestation.  <br> \n <br> \nDuring the annual mid-August sampling event, three vertical plankton tows were made with a 50 cm diameter net with 150 micron mesh, to a depth of 24 feet.  Plankton from these hauls were preserved and sent to a St. Paul lab for quantitative analysis.  The samples taken during August 2018 at Lax Lake did not contain spiny water flea or other aquatic invasive species. <br> \n</p>",

All year classes thru Age VIII were represented with Ages II & III comprising 51% of the aged sample. Growth was good for all ages of Walleyes sampled. Northern Pike catch declined by 82% from the previous assessment and was the lowest in recent history but the mean size of 4.0 lbs was substantially larger than any other assessment. Gillnet catches of Yellow Perch have declined by 50% over the last 3 assessments however densities are still relatively high with 15.0/gillnet lift. The trapnet catch of Black Crappie was low which is consistant with several recent assessments. There appears to e several missing year classes and only Age IV fish were well represented. Fall trapnetting may be a better way for evaluating the Black Crappie population. The trapnet catch of Bluegills declined substantially from the all time high catch of the previous assessment however the catch was consistant with many other earlier assessments. Age V Bluegills comprised 33.3% of the aged sample.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lax Lake is approximately 6 miles south-southeast of Finland Minnesota and borders Tettegouche State Park.  It is one of the more developed lakes in the Finland Area and one of the few that has a resort that is open all year.  A designated public access with concrete ramp is located on the north end of the lake and is accessible from Lake County Hwy #4.     The fish population consists of walleye, northern pike, bluegill, black crappie, largemouth bass, yellow perch, pumpkinseed sunfish and white sucker.  Test nets in 1997 indicate that walleye abundance is above average when compared to other lakes in this lake class with an average size of 13.1 inches (0.8 pounds).  Walleye up to 20.7 inches were sampled however fish in the 12 inch to 15 inch range were the most common.     Northern pike were sampled in average numbers compared to similar lakes in this lake class.  Individuals up to 32.6 inches (8.0 pounds) were observed with an average size of about 21 inches (1.9 pounds).  Approximately 33% of the northern pike sampled were greater than 24 inches in length.     Bluegill are present in average numbers and are pursued by anglers in summer and winter.  Bluegill average about 6.5 inches with fish up to 8.7 inches recorded.  Approximately 25% of the bluegill sampled were between 7.5 inches and 8.7 inches.     The 1997 survey indicates that black crappie numbers are average at best.  The quality of the black crappie is good, averaging 10.8 inches with fish up to 12.1 inches recorded.     Yellow perch are fairly abundant but most are too small to interest anglers.  Yellow perch up to 12.3 inches were taken however fish over 10 inches are uncommon.     Largemouth bass are present but are difficult to sample in standard netting gear therefore their abundance is uncertain.  There are some quality largemouth bass present though as reports of fish in the 2 pound to 4 pound range are not uncommon.  Several in this size range were caught in the winter of 1997/1998 by anglers fishing for bluegill.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lax Lake is a 296 acre body of water located approximately 5 miles south-southwest of Finland MN.  The public access off of Lake County Rd. #408, on the north end of the lake, has a concrete ramp and asphalt parking area with space for approximately eight vehicles with trailers.  There is one resort with 4 cabins and 15 campsites located on the north shore of Lax Lake.  Lax Lake is considered the best panfish (black crappie and bluegill) lake in the Finland area. <br> \n      <br> \nWalleye were sampled in average numbers for northeastern Minnesota lakes with similar characteristics, but at the low end of the sample range previous seen on Lax Lake.  The average size of walleye was 2.34 pounds (17.8 inches) in 2010 included 39% of the sample over 20 inches, the largest walleye was 26.8 inches. Walleye growth was slower than average in Lax Lake compared to fish sampled in other Finland area assessments.  Walleyes are stocked 2 out of every 4 years with the last stocking in 2009. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike were sampled in above average numbers for the lake class.  The average size of 2.67 pounds (20.7 inches) was near average for the lake class and within the range seen in previous investigations on Lax Lake.  Thirty percent of the catch was over 24 inches; the largest northern pike sampled in 2010 was 40.8 inches.  Some of the northern pike have Neascus (black spot) parasites. <br> \n <br> \nThe bluegill numbers and size were above average in Lax Lake compared to lakes in northeastern Minnesota with similar characteristics.  The average weight was 0.2 pound in the sample.  The average length of the trap net catch was 6.1 inches, with the maximum length at 8.4 inches.  Lax Lake is the best bluegill lake in the Finland area for consistently good fishing and quality size bluegill.  Fishing pressure on Lax Lake increases each June when the bluegills are in the shallows to spawn and they are a popular target after the walleye/northern pike winter angling season is closed.  Many of the bluegill in Lax Lake have Neascus (black spot) parasites. <br> \n  <br> \nBlack crappie numbers and size were above average for the lake class.  The average weight was 0.34 pound (8.6 inches) with the maximum length at 9.2 inches.   The 2006 year-class represented 87.5% (14/16) of the aged black crappie sample.  As is the case in many northeastern Minnesota panfish lakes, Lax Lake black crappies occasionally produce strong year-class although the sporadic spawning success typically results in a highly variable black crappie population. <br> \n  <br> \nThe largemouth bass population of Lax Lake was first assessed with boat electrofishing on June 3, 2010.  The total largemouth bass catch was 37 fish with a run-time per hour catch rate of 16.82 and on-time per hour catch rate of 26.77. The mean length of the largemouth bass was 11.9 inches with the maximum length recorded at 18.9 inches.  Largemouth bass reproduction in Lax Lake appeared to be good with many young-of-the-year largemouth bass sampled by seining and in small mesh trap nets.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>The intent of this Special Assessment was to examine the waters of Lax Lake for baseline zooplankton composition and abundance as well as look for spiny water flea (Bythotrephes longimanus) formerly known as \"B.C.\" (Bythotrephes cedarstroemi).  This invasive species were first found in Lake Superior in 1988, thought to be introduced through ballast waters.  Spiny water flea has since spread to the inland lakes and rivers including those in the Duluth (1997), Tower (2007), and Grand Marias (2007) Fisheries Management Areas.  In the Finland Area, Lax Lake was selected as a sample site since it is used as an airplane loading site for trout stocking in other inland lakes. It is also very common for local anglers to fish both Lake Superior and Lax Lake, possibly with the same boat.  Should spiny water flea be present in Lax Lake, aerial stocking could be a vector, exposing these waters to possible infection. <br> \n <br> \nDuring the mid August three vertical plankton tows were made with a 51 cm net at a depth of 29 feet. These hauls were preserved, and then sent to the St. Paul Lab for quantitative analysis. The samples taken during August of 2010 at Lax Lake did not contain spiny water flea. <br> \n <br> \nTotal density of organisms sampled in 2010 was similar to the 2009 sample, and considerably greater than the 2008 sample. Forty-seven percent of the zooplankton in the 2010 sample were copepods. Copepods composed 58% of 2009 sample and 56% of 2008 sample.  Cyclopoids continue to be the most dominate copepods in all sample years. <br> \n  <br> \nThe same six Cladoceran species were sampled in 2010 as were sampled in 2008; the 2009 sample only included four of these six species.  Fifty-six percent of the 2010 sample were Cladocerans; previously Cladocerans as a whole were slightly less abundant than copepods in August (42% in 2009 and 44% in 2010) when comparing density.     The most notable was in the high population of Chydorus sphaericus, which made up 62% of the Cladocerans sample.  In two previous sampling years Chydorus sphaericus only represented 0-8% of the total Cladocerans.  A moderate algae bloom was occurring at the time of the 2010 sample, an event that often correlates with Chydorus population booms, more so than temperature and light factors.  An early spring and warm summer temperatures, (opposite of 2009) may have contributed to the algae bloom. <br> \n <br> \nDaphnia species were the most dominant Cladoceran in 2009, composing 97% of the Cladoceran sample.  In the 2010, Daphnia species composed 11.7% of the Cladoceran sample, similar to the 2008 samples.   Pan fish reproduction in 2009 was reduced due to a late spring and cool summer;  it is possible that in 2009 the Daphnia species were flourishing under limited predator conditions. <br> \n <br> \nThe fish community of Lax Lake includes walleye, northern pike, yellow perch, bluegill sunfish, pumpkinseed sunfish, black crappie, largemouth bass, white sucker, and various minnow species.   An established population of spiny water flea could potentially be detrimental to the walleye population as well as the other fish species as spiny water flea are thought to out compete Daphnia species, which are a preferred food  of age-0 walleye, crappie, and sunfish species. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of adult Bluegill and Black Crappie was completed in June 2022 to monitor the size structure of the populations to gain a better understanding of the opportunities available to anglers. Early spring night electrofishing was also completed to test new equipment and evaluate the potential to sample Largemouth Bass or Walleye.  <br> \n <br> \nSpring trap netting was not successful at sampling the Black Crappie population as only two individuals were captured. On the other hand, a good sample of the adult Bluegill population was obtained that should reflect the current angling opportunities. Size averaged 7 inches long and over a quarter pound each with 60% longer than 7 inches and the largest fish measuring 9.33 inches long. In addition, preferred size Bluegill greater than 8 inches long made up 15% of the catch indicating good opportunities to catch and harvest fish. Neascus (black spot disease) is a very common parasite with no practical means of control that is present in the lake and impacts the fish community. Most Bluegill sampled showed some signs of infestation with some heavily infested individuals that most anglers would find unappealing, although safe to eat if well cooked.  <br> \n <br> \nNight electrofishing was completed in May, about a week after ice-out, to determine if the newly acquired equipment could be used to efficiently sample Largemouth Bass, Walleye, or other species to monitor their populations or to generate estimates of abundance. A small number of Walleye were sampled, but not enough to generate an estimate of abundance and not likely representative of angling opportunities.  <br> \n <br> \nElectrofishing did collect a fair sample of adult Largemouth Bass with an impressive size structure. Bass sampled in early spring ranged from 13.15 to 19.25 inches long and averaged 16.75 inches with a majority of the fish sampled between 16 and 19 inches long. Sampling effort was limited to areas with high fish density and therefore the catch was not a representative sample of abundance.

Walleye natural reproduction appears limited and not sufficient to maintain a Walleye fishery. Yellow Perch densities appear sufficient to sustain these Walleye numbers as well as a high Northern Pike population. Black Crappie numbers appear to have declined since the intense Walleye stocking effort began. The Bluegill population appears to be holding up well in light of the high predator population which now includes Largemouth Bass.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lax Lake is a 295 acre body of water located approximately 5 miles south-southwest of Finland MN.  The public access off of Lake County Rd. #408 (Lax Lake Road), on the north end of the lake, has a concrete ramp and room for about eight vehicles with trailers in the parking lot.  There is also a handicap accessible fishing pier with a small picnic area and separate parking lot.  One resort is located on the lake.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye were sampled in below average numbers for northeastern Minnesota lakes with similar characteristics, and the lowest numbers seen within the past twenty years.  The average size of Walleye was 2.21 pounds (17.6 inches) in 2014; the largest Walleye sampled measured was 25.8 inches. The strongest year classes of Walleyes came from 2012, 2009 and 2008; all which correlate to fingerling stockings.  Contributions to the population from natural reproduction appear to have been poor in recent years.  At the time of the 2014 investigation Lax Lake was stocked with Walleye fingerlings on a two consecutive years out of every four years frequency (this frequency began in 2004).  The stocking frequency will be changed to an annual stocking of Walleye fingerlings starting the fall of 2015. <br> \n <br> \nThe 2014 assessment was the third consecutive investigation where Northern Pike were sampled in above average numbers for the lake class.  The average size of 2.56 pounds (21 inches) was near average for the lake class and within the range seen in previous investigations on Lax Lake.  Only twenty-three percent of the catch was over 24 inches; the previous two investigations had at a greater percentage of fish over 30 inches; although the largest Northern Pike sampled in 2014 measured 39 inches.  A small percentage of the Northern Pike have Neascus (black spot parasite).  These parasites are small and produce black pigmentation that resembles black pepper sprinkled on fins or flesh (fillets) of fish.  However, although unsightly, the fillet is safe to eat if it is well cooked. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass gill net catch was above average for the lake class, the mean weight of the catch was 2.12 pounds, also above average (1.40 pounds).  Three separate special assessments using electrofishing for Largemouth Bass have been completed on Lax Lake (2010, 2013 and 2014).  Although the catch rate of Largemouth Bass for each assessment has remained similar, the average length of fish has increased (from 11 inches to 14 inches) and maximum length of fish has remained around 19 inches. <br> \n <br> \nLax Lake Black Crappie reproduction is sporadic which leads to the boom and bust Black Crappie population of Lax Lake.  In all five year classes of Black Crappie were sampled; the 2010 year class by far was the strongest year class representing 68% of the total catch.  Black Crappie numbers and size were above average for the lake class, but grow rates were below average.  The mean length was 8.6 inches and the largest fish sampled was seven-years old and measured 10.8 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nBluegills were sampled at above average numbers and exhibit slower than average growth in Lax Lake compared to lakes in northeastern Minnesota with similar characteristics.  The average length of the trap net catch was 5.3 inches (0.13 pound).  Ten year classes of Bluegill were found with the 2010 and 2006 year classes each representing 25% of the sample.  The largest Bluegill sampled measured 9 inches.  Many of the Bluegill in Lax Lake also had small to moderate amount of Neascus (black spot parasite).  <br> \n <br> \nWhite sucker were sampled at slightly below average numbers and above average size for the lake class.  Low numbers of Pumpkinseed Sunfish and Hybrid Sunfish (Bluegill x Pumpkinseed) were also sampled. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lax Lake is an approximately 300 acre lake with a maximum depth of 35 feet located between Silver Bay and Finland. The public water access is off Lax Lake Road and has a concrete log boat ramp, accessible fishing pier, and picnic area with parking for several vehicles and trailers. Walleye are the primary management species and have been stocked at various rates and sizes for the better part of a century to provide angling opportunities on the lake. A standard fisheries survey was completed in 2022 to monitor the fish community and evaluate stocking success.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye were captured at a rate of 4.67 per gill net, which was within the normal range for similar lakes and within the range of historic catches from previous surveys of Lax Lake. The sample included a wide range of sizes and a nice average size of 15.8 inches long and 1.91 pounds. Analysis of aging structures determined eleven unique year classes were present including individuals from each of the last six years of stocking. While some limited reproduction may occur in the lake the current Walleye population is maintained through annual fingerling stocking. <br> \n <br> \nSpring night electrofishing was completed as part of the standard fisheries survey to monitor the Largemouth Bass population because they are not well sampled in survey nets. Results were similar to previous electrofishing efforts with a catch rate of 16.8 bass per hour of sampling and an average length of 13.0 inches. Fish ranged from age-2 to age-11 with each year class between represented indicating a stable population with regular recruitment. Few lakes in the Finland area have Largemouth Bass populations, but survey results indicate Lax Lake is one that provides anglers with good opportunities to catch decent sized bass.  <br> \n <br> \nThe Bluegill catch rate of 18.22 per trap net was within the normal range for similar lakes and within the range from historic surveys of the lake. Age and growth analysis determined year classes of various sizes have been produced annually in recent years with fish growing slowly compared the other lakes in the Finland area. A targeted survey of the Bluegill population was completed in June of 2022 and provide more information on the size structure of the adult portion of the population that is of interest to anglers. <br> \n <br> \nGill net and trap net catches of Black Crappie were also within the normal range for similar lakes, but the catch was one of the higher catches from historic surveys. Crappie ranged from age-2 to age-10 with six unique year classes identified. Growth was considered slow compared to other area lakes, but similar to previous surveys of Lax Lake. Most adult crappie tend to be 8 to 10 inches long with fish requiring several years to reach a larger size. These results indicate the lake continues to support a crappie fishery of modest abundance with opportunities to harvest fair sized fish.  <br> \n <br> \nThe Northern Pike catch rate of 6.17 per gill net was above the normal ranger for similar lakes and above the historic average of the lake. While most pike were fairly small the average size was 21.26 inches long and 2.64 pounds with the largest fish sampled measuring just longer than 36 inches. Age and growth analysis determined seven unique year classes were sampled indicating natural reproduction is currently sufficient to sustain the population.  <br> \n <br> \nThe 2022 standard survey results indicate Lax Lake continues to provide opportunities to catch a variety of popular game fish. With the exception of Walleye, which are stocked regularly, the remaining fish community is maintained by natural reproduction. While the lake may not be known as a trophy destination for any species, it provides diverse opportunities for anglers that target Bluegill, Black Crappie, Largemouth Bass, Northern Pike, and Walleye to catch some quality sized fish. </p>",

The lake is located five miles south southwest of Finland along Lake County Highway 408 (Lax Lake Road). The access is a concrete ramp on the north end of the lake off of the Lax Lake Road. There is room for about eight vehicles with trailers in the parking lot.  There is a dock at the access and just south of the ramp is a handicap accessible fishing pier. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass were first recorded in Lax Lake in the 1955 survey.  Since then, sampling of Largemouth Bass occurred occasionally in the standard survey gear although usually in low numbers. Large numbers of young-of-year (YOY) fish were often captured during reproduction checks.  Although reproduction was consistent, little was known about the adult population.  Traditional net-based surveys under-sample largemouth bass, so in 2010 night electrofishing was used for the first time to better evaluate bass abundances and size structures population within Lax Lake.  The 2014 survey was the third nighttime electrofishing survey done on Lax Lake.  June night electrofishing special assessment sampled 55 Largemouth Bass with a per hour catch rate of 26.8.  The average length was 14 inches and the maximum length sampled was 19.4 inches.  Ages ranged from age-3 to age-14; age-4 and age-9 were by far the strongest year classes representing 38% and 23% respectively, while fish age-10 and older comprised 19% of the catch.  The 2014 assessment was similar to the two previous electrofishing assessments in per hour catch of fish.  However, the average size of the largemouth bass has increased from 11 inches to 14 inches.  The largest sampled bass for each of the three assessments was around 19 inches. <br> \n</p>",

Walleye fry stocking was tried in 1978 and again in 1979 with up to 2027 fry per surface acre. No fingerlings were found in follow-up 1/4\" mesh trapnetting in either year, so fry stocking has been discontinued. The lake will be stocked at the rate of 2.5 pounds of yearling sized Walleyes per littoral acre. This stocking will continue yearly until Walleye reproduction is found in the lake. The large size of Walleye stocked will insure survival in the face of the large panfish population which is present in the lake. No other species will be stocked in Lax Lake.     Examination of stomach contents of several hundred angler caught Walleyes from the lake indicates heavy predation on young-of-the-year Bluegill and Pumpkinseeds.     Natural reproduction of all other species present in the lake is sufficient to maintain strong populations with the present angling pressure.</p>",
