                "narrative": "<p>Black Lake is a relatively quiet and remote waterbody located north of Three Island Lake in south-central Beltrami County.  The lake covers 271 acres and has a maximum depth of 42 feet.  Water clarity is roughly 8 feet.  The lake flows into Three Island Lake on the Turtle River chain though a culvert under Black Lake Township Road.  There is no designated DNR administered access to Black Lake though anglers have historically accessed the lake by Township Road right-of-way.  Public access to this lake was in dispute at the time of this survey in 2017. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie were observed in moderate abundance on Black Lake in 2017.   A total of 58 crappies averaging 9.0 inches in length were captured, with crappies up to 12.8 inches recorded.  Overall, 17% of the crappies found in the 2017 survey were over 11 inches in length. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike were captured in strong numbers (79 total) with lengths ranging from 16.6 to 34.2 inches and averaging 23.6 inches.  Of the pike captured, 18% were over 26 inches in length which is a much higher percentage than most area lakes.   <br> \n <br> \nWalleye are present in Black Lake but in low numbers. In fact, only 14 were captured during the entire assessment; however, lengths ranged from 18.1 to 24.9 inches.  This suggests the Walleye population in Black Lake could possibly be comprised of migrants that stay in the lake after attempting to spawn in the spring.  If this is the case, the Walleye population could fluctuate greatly from year to year depending on spring water conditions. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill are not overly abundant in Black Lake compared to most lakes in the area.  However, a total of 48 were captured in 2017 with lengths up to 10.2 inches.  Bluegill averaged 7.2 inches but 56% of the fish captured were over 8 inches in length. <br> \n</p>",
