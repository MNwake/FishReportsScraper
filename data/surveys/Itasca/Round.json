                "narrative": "<p>Round Lake is a class 27 lake located on the west side of Squaw Lake, MN.  The lake has two public accesses and moderate shoreline development.  The 2007 lake management plan indicates walleye and northern pike as the primary species of management with yellow perch as secondary species.  In the spring of 2005 a special walleye regulation (17 to 26\" protected slot) was implemented and in the spring of 2007 a special northern pike regulation (22 to 36\" protected slot with a 9 fish bag limit) was implemented. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye catch rates have fluctuated from 3.3 to 11.2 since 1954.  The catch rates in the four assessments prior to 2006 were very stable, ranging from 5.3 to 5.7 fish/gill net.  In 2006, the walleye gill-net catch rate was 9.7 fish/net which was above the 3rd quartile value of 8.8 fish/net for only the second time.  The 2009 gill-net catch of 6.7 walleye/net fell short of the management goal of 8.0 fish/net.  High angler success prior to the assessment may have reduced gill-net catch rates.  There were 21 rigs at the public accesses the first day of the assessment and there were numerous reports of high fish pressure and harvest since the walleye season opened.   <br> \n <br> \nThe sampled walleye ranged from 11.1 to 22.8 inches and had a mean length of 15.8 inches.  Size structure had PSD, RSD-P, and RSD-M values of 45, 10, and 0, respectively.  Eleven year-classes were identified from scale, opercle, and otolith analysis with fish from 3 to 22 years old.  Age-3 walleye represented 56% of the sample.  Growth was similar to statewide averages for all ages up to 10 years old.  Walleye averaged 15.8 inches at age 4. <br> \n <br> \nIn the three prior assessments (1996, 2001 & 2006), at least 65% of the walleye aged were from years in which no stocking occurred.  Since some natural production likely occurred in years with stocking, the natural contribution to the population would be higher than 65%.  Further evidence of excellent natural reproduction was observed in the 2009 assessment when 98% of the aged fish corresponded to years with no stocking.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike gill-net catch rates from 1954 to 1986 ranged from 6.6 to 10.9 fish/gill net.  From 1989 to 2006 the gill-net catch rates were higher but fairly stable (13.1 to 18.2 fish/net).  The gill-net catch declined in each of the last three assessments from 17.0 fish/net in 2001 to 4.9 fish/net in 2009.  The catch in 2009 was the lowest ever recorded and was near the lake class median.  It is unclear what lead to the decline but it should result in improved growth and size structure.  The sampled fish ranged from 15.0 to 35.0 inches and had a mean length of 21.2 inches.  The length distributions resulted in PSD, RSD-P and RSD-M values of 38, 14 and 3, respectively.  Nine year-classes were identified from cliethra and scales ranging from age 1 to age 10.  Age-2 and 3 fish each represented roughly 28% of the sample.  Northern pike averaged 22.0 inches by age 4 which was above the statewide average of 20.5.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch gill-net catch rates have fluctuated from a low of 15.6 fish/net in 2009 to a high of 102.7 fish/net in 1983.  In 2009, the catch was the lowest ever recorded and near the lake class median of 18.2 fish/gill net.  Size structure had PSD, RSD-P, and RSD-M values of 95, 31 and <1, respectively.  Although the yellow perch population is healthy in terms of numbers and size structure, it may not receive much harvest from anglers due to the frequency of the parasite yellow grub.  Age and growth information was not collected in this assessment.  <br> \n <br> \nTullibee is a species that can be difficult to sample but they are important to fish communities as a prey source.  In 2006, the gill-net catch rate of 2.7 fish/net was the highest on record for Round Lake and exceeded the median for class 27 lakes.  In contrast, only one tullibee was sampled in 2009.  Due to challenges in sampling tullibee, it is difficult to know whether the decline reflects a real change in the population. <br> \n <br> \nOther species observed during the special assessment included black crappie, black bullhead, brown bullhead, burbot, rock bass, shorthead redhorse, and white sucker. <br> \n <br> \nIn order to maintain or improve fish and wildlife populations, water quality and habitat must be protected.  People often associate water quality problems with large-scale agricultural, forestry, urban development or industrial practices in the watershed.  In reality, the impact of land use decisions on one lake lot may be relatively minor yet the cumulative impact of those decisions on many lake lots can result in a significant decline in water quality and habitat.  For example, removing shoreline and aquatic vegetation, fertilizing lawns, mowing to the water's edge, installing beach sand blankets, failing septic systems and uncontrolled run-off, all contribute excess nutrients and sediment, which degrade water quality and habitat.  Understanding these cumulative impacts and taking steps to avoid or minimize them will help to insure our quality fisheries can be enjoyed by future generations.</p>",

The boat was set up with two spider array droppers, pulsed DC, 4 amps and 200 volts.  Water level was higher than normal causing turbid conditions and moderate northwest winds made visibility difficult on the south and southeast shorelines.  \n\nNo YOY walleye were sampled at stations 1 through 3 and at least one was sampled at stations 4 through 7.  A total of 14 YOY walleye were sampled for a catch rate of 8.0/hour of on time.  Young-of-the-year walleye varied in length from 6.6 to 7.6 inches.  Walleye fry were not stocked this spring and all fish sampled were the result of natural reproduction.\n\nCatch rates in previous assessments have been highly variable and appear to be a reflection of favorable spring weather for fry survivabliltiy than a function of whether the lake was stocked.  The most recent fry stocked year was 2008 which had a catch rate of 3.2/hr, while 2007 and 2009 were nonstocked years and had catch rates of 0 and 63/hour.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>The fish community has remained little-changed since the last assessment in 1989, with the excepton of an increase in the abundance of brown bullheads and a decrease of yellow perch and northern pike.Northern pike are abundant as indicated by a gill net CPUE of 13.1.  This is much higher than the third quartile of 8.4 for this lake class. Reproductive success is excellent for northern pike due to the excellent spawning area not only in Round Lake itself, but also the Popple River and adjacent Squaw Lake.The three bullhead species: black, yellow, and brown were sampled in this assessment.  The brown bullhead was the dominant species present at a gill net CPUE of 17.3 and trap net CPUE of 4.1.  These numbers are above the third quartile for this species in this lake classification.  Black bullheads were sampled at numbers above the lake class median and only two yellow bullheads were sampled in the trap nets.The lake has been stocked biennially with walleye fry since 1980 and only occasionally prior to that time.  Assessments have been done every three years in an attempt to better understand the contribution of walleye fry to the population and the extent of natural reproduction.  These assessments sampled 5.3 walleye/gillnet which is within the first and third quartile range of 3.7 and 9.7 respectively, for this lake class.  The mean weight of the walleye sampled was 2.6 pounds.  A PSD of 92 was calculated for this species, indicating a population of fish that are of quality length.Yellow perch were abundant as has historically been the case for Round Lake.  A gill net catch of 47.6 was at the third quartile of 49.3.  Excellent natural reproduction of this species is occurring as evidenced by a catch of 1295 young-of-year/acre in the shoreline seining that was conducted as part of this assessment.Tullibee were present at a gill net CPUE of 0.7, black crappie at 0.9 and only two burbot were sampled.Other species present were rock bass, pumpkinseed, and white sucker.</p>",

The 2002 lake management plan indicates walleye as the primary species of management with black crappie and yellow perch as secondary species.  In the spring of 2005 a special walleye regulation was implemented and in the spring of 2007 a special northern pike regulation will begin.  The walleye regulation is a 17 to 26 inch protected slot length limit, with only one fish over 26 inches allowed in possession.  The northern pike regulation is a 22 to 36 inch protected slot length limit, with only one fish over 36 inches allowed in possession, and a possession limit of nine northern pike. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye catch rates have varied from 3.3 to 11.2/gill net since 1954.  The catch rates in the four assessments prior to 2006 were very stable, ranging from 5.3 to 5.7 fish/gill.  In 2006, the walleye gill-net catch rate of 9.7 fish/net exceeded the management goal of 8.0 fish/net.  The 2006 catch was also above the upper end of the normal range for lakes similar to Round.  The sampled fish ranged from 8.0 to 25.0 inches and had a mean length of 15.6 inches.  Approximately 65% of the fish were longer than 15 inches but relatively few walleye were longer than 20 inches. <br> \n <br> \nTwelve year-classes were identified from scale, opercle, and otolith analysis with fish from one to 12 years old sampled.  The three most abundant year classes were from 2001, 2002, and 2004.  Similar to the 2001 assessment, at least 65% of the fish aged were from years in which no stocking occurred.  Since some natural reproduction likely occurred in years with stocking, the natural contribution to the population would be higher than the observed 65%.  Growth was similar to statewide averages for all ages.  Walleye averaged 15.7 inches after four years of growth. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike gill-net catch rates have been consistently high (13.1 to 18.2 fish/net) since 1989.  Prior to 1989, catch rates ranged from 6.6 to 10.9 fish/gill net dating back to 1954.  The northern pike gill-net catch declined from 17.0 fish/net in 2001 to 13.6 fish/net in 2006, but remained above the 3rd quartile of 9.0 fish/net.  The sampled fish ranged from 13.2 to 26.6 inches and averaged 19.1 inches.  Of the sampled fish, only 19% were 21 inches or longer.  Eight year-classes were identified from cliethra and scales ranging from one to eight years old.  Northern pike averaged 19.8 inches after four years of growth, which was near the statewide average of 20.5.  <br> \n <br> \nThe black crappie trap-net catch was 0.2 fish/net while the gill-net catch was 2.7 fish/net.  The catch in trap nets was the lowest on record, while the catch from gill nets was the highest.  Most of the fish were small and from the 2005 year class.  Growth was generally similar to or above the statewide average for all ages. <br> \n <br> \nThe bluegill population has never been very abundant with catch rates typically below the normal range for this type of lake.  The 2001 trap-net catch was 4.8 fish/net which was the highest ever recorded.  However, in 2006, the catch of 0.6 fish/trap net returned to a level more typical for the lake.  Bluegill ranged from 4.3 to 7.7 inches with an average length of 6.3 inches.  Only three and four year old fish were sampled.  Growth rates were similar to class 27 averages. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch gill-net catch rates have fluctuated from a low of 29.7 fish/net in 1954 to a high of 102.7 fish/net in 1983.  In 2006, the catch was 23.3 fish/net and just above average for the lake class.  Approximately 54% of the fish were longer than 8 inches and 16% were longer than 10 inches.  Although the yellow perch population is healthy in terms of numbers and size structure, it may not receive much harvest from anglers due to the frequency of the parasite yellow grub.  Seven age-classes were sampled with fish from two to nine years old present.  Growth was similar to statewide averages. <br> \n <br> \nTullibee are a species that can be difficult to sample but are important to fish communities as a prey source.  The gill-net catch rate of 2.7 fish/net in this assessment was the highest on record for Round Lake.  The catch was above average for class 27 lakes.  The fish ranged from 7.8 to 19.8 inches with an average length of 9.4 inches.  There was one large fish sampled that was 19.8 inches long and weighed 4.5 pounds. <br> \n <br> \nOther species observed during the lake survey included bowfin, black bullhead, brown bullhead, burbot, largemouth bass, pumpkinseed sunfish, rock bass, tadpole madtom, and white sucker.  Additional species sampled while shoreline seining included blacknose shiner, common shiner, golden shiner, Johnny darter, and spottail shiner. <br> \n <br> \nTo promote and maintain healthy fish populations, pollution needs to be controlled.  Fish habitat is directly affected by water quality.  Nutrients, sediments and other waste can drastically alter the chemical and physical characteristics of a lake.  People often associate water quality problems in a lake with agricultural, forestry or industrial practices within the watershed.  Although these can be areas of concern, lakeshore property owners may also contribute to water quality problems.  Some examples include putting in sand beaches, removing shoreline trees and vegetation, fertilizing lawns, and mowing their lawns down to the lakeshore.  Proper land use practices by everyone will help insure that this fishery can be enjoyed by future generations.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Round Lake has been managed for walleye and has historically supported a very good walleye population.  The gill net catch rate for walleye in this assessment was above the lake class median at 5.7 even though the frequency of stocking was reduced prior to this assessment.  The 1991 and 1994 year class (2 and 5 year olds) dominated the catch.  The average length of the walleye sampled was 15.7 inches.  Most of the fish (78.9%) were the result of natural reproduction.     Northern pike have been in the past and continue to be abundant in this lake. Natural reproduction is excellent due to the excellent spawning habitat present in this system.  Sampled above the third quartile in this assessment, they ranged in length from 15.8-30.0 inches.  The average length was 20.7 inches.     Yellow perch, sampled in good numbers, have declined some in recent years.  The catch, however, was still well above the lake class median.  Many of those sampled were of quality size, up to 12.0 inches.  The average length was 8.6 inches.  Perch are an important forage species and are a major component of the diet of both northern pike and walleye.     Black crappie, although not numerous, were sampled in the gill nets above the lake class median.  They ranged in length from 5.9-10.8 inches.     Round Lake is a quality walleye lake that appears to have a level of natural reproduction that is capable of supporting a good population.  As Round and other lakes become increasingly more developed, lakeshore owners will have a larger impact on its future.  Owners of the land adjacent to the lake should be encouraged to manage their property to minimize impacts to the shoreline ecosystem.      </p>",

Night electrofishing was conducted in September 2008 in an attempt to sample young of the year walleye.  This sampling method has been successfully used in the past on Round and other area lakes to assess relative year class strength.  The boat used two spider-array anodes and pulsed DC current with an output of 5 amps and 200 volts.  Surface water temperature was 60 F.  Visibility was poor due to an algae bloom and thick vegetation (milfoil) growing in shallow water.  Six standardized stations were sampled for 1.58 hours of on-time. <br> \n <br> \nOnly five young of the year walleye were sampled in this assessment for a catch rate of 3.2/hour of on-time.  The fish were relatively small, ranging from 4.1 to 5.3 inches.  This is the fifth time MNDNR has conducted a fall electrofishing assessment for young of the year walleye.  The 2008 catch is the second lowest on record, even though 3.3 million walleye fry were stocked in May 2008.  Catch rates for young of the year walleye have ranged from 0 to 34.3/hour in the other four assessments.  Round Lake has historically shown intermittent years of good natural reproduction.  Environmental conditions may have played a role in the low catch for this assessment.  Algae and thick vegetation encountered on most stations reduced visibility and made sampling difficult.  Low water levels also made it difficult to access and shock the traditional areas of the stations.  The low catch rate observed in this assessment may be indicative of a poor year for recruitment of walleye.  Low catches of young-of-the-year walleye were noted on several other large walleye lakes in the area earlier in the year. <br> \n</p>",

No YOY walleye were sampled in the 2011 fall electrofishing assessment.  Several walleye suspected to be yearlings were captured while an additional 75 to 100 age-2 and older fish were observed.  Due to the lack of good sampling stations available for targeting YOY walleye and highly variable algae and vegetation conditions from year to year, caution should be used when comparing catch rates among years.  In addition, the same sampling stations are seldom sampled consistently due to the poor conditions and or weather.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of nearshore fish species in Round Lake was conducted on July 12th thru 14th, 2021 by Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program Staff. Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at 24 sampling stations. Similarly, and 50-foot seine was used to sample 19 stations, and site conditions prevented the use of seines at five stations. Nearshore sampling captured 23 species of fish including five species that are intolerant of disturbance (Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Burbot, Iowa Darter, and Rock Bass) and two that are tolerant of disturbance (Black Bullhead, and Fathead Minnow). <br> \n <br> \nA concurrent summer trap net survey was conducted by IBI Program Staff. Nine trap nets were set along the shoreline in locations that encompassed multiple habitat types. Brown Bullhead, Walleye, and Northern Pike comprised a majority of the trap net catch by biomass.   <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore and trap net data were combined with gill net data from a June 24th 2019 standard survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based IBI (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment. In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (Blackchin Shiner, Iowa Darter, and Rock Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (Black Bullhead, Fathead Minnow). The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.  <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey provides supporting evidence that the fish community in Round Lake is likely adversely impacted by stressors as indicated by an FIBI score just below the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes. Data from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Big Fork River Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Round Lake is a class 27 lake located on the west side of Squaw Lake, MN.  The lake has two public accesses and moderate shoreline development.  The 2007 lake management plan indicates walleye and northern pike as the primary species of management with yellow perch as secondary species.  A special walleye regulation was implemented in the spring of 2005 and a special northern pike regulation was implemented in the spring of 2007.  The walleye slot length limit required all fish between 17 and 26 inches to be released and only one fish over 26 inches could be in possession.  The northern pike slot length limit required all fish between 22 to 36 inches to be released and only one northern pike over 36 inches could be possessed.   The northern pike regulation also included an expanded nine fish bag limit. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye catch rates have fluctuated from 3.3 to 11.2 since 1954.  The catch rates in five of the last seven assessments ranged from 5.3 to 5.7 fish/gill net.  In 2013, the walleye gill-net catch of 5.3 fish/net was near the lake class median of 5.5 fish/net but short of the management goal of 8.0 fish/net.  The sampled walleye ranged from 7.4 to 26.5 inches and averaged 18.9 inches.  Fourteen age-classes were identified from scale, opercle, and otolith analysis with fish from 1 to 17 years old.  Four year-classes represented from 13 to 20% of the sample, indicating fairly consistent recruitment.  Growth was similar to statewide averages for all ages up to 10 years old.  Walleye averaged 16.3 inches after four years of growth. <br> \n <br> \nIn the 1996, 2001 and 2006 assessments, at least 65% of the walleye aged were from years in which no stocking occurred.  Since some natural production likely occurred in years with stocking, the natural contribution to the population would be higher than the observed 65%.  Further evidence of excellent natural reproduction was observed in the last two assessments when 98 and 89% of the aged fish corresponded to years with no stocking.  It would appear the connecting river systems on Round Lake play a critical role in the natural recruitment of walleye since the in-lake habitat seems to be marginal.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike gill-net catch rates from 1954 to 1986 were near the upper end of the normal range but from 1989 to 2006 the catches were higher, ranging from 13.1 to 18.2 fish/net.  The gill-net catch declined in 2009 (4.9 fish/net) to the lowest ever recorded.  It is unclear what lead to the decline, but by 2013, the catch had increased to a record high (22.1 fish/net).  The sampled fish ranged from 13.9 to 36.4 inches and averaged 22.3 inches.  Eleven year-classes were identified from cliethra and scales ranging from age 2 to age 12.  Five age classes represented from 14 to 23% of the sample.  Northern pike averaged 22.5 inches after four years of growth which was above the statewide average of 20.5. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch gill-net catch rates have fluctuated from a low of 15.6 fish/net in 2009 to a high of 102.7 fish/net in 1983.  In 2013, the catch of 28.6 exceeded the lake class median of18.2 fish/gill net.  The sampled fish ranged from 4.2 to 13.3 inches and averaged 8.1 inches.  Although the yellow perch population is healthy in terms of numbers and size, the frequency of the parasite yellow grub may hinder some anglers from targeting them.  Age and growth information was not collected in this assessment.  <br> \n <br> \nTullibee is a species that can be difficult to sample but they are important to fish communities as a prey source.  In 2006, the gill-net catch rate of 2.7 fish/net was the highest on record for Round Lake and exceeded the median for class 27 lakes.  In contrast, only one tullibee was sampled in 2009 and none in 2013.  Generally because sampling tullibee can be challenging, it is difficult to know whether the decline reflects a real change in the population.  However, two years of such low catches does not bode well for the population. <br> \n <br> \nOther species observed during the assessment included black bullhead, black crappie, bowfin, brown bullhead, hybrid sunfish, pumpkinseed sunfish, rock bass, shorthead redhorse, white sucker, and yellow bullhead. <br> \n <br> \nIn order to maintain or improve fish and wildlife populations, water quality and habitat must be protected.  People often associate water quality problems with large-scale agricultural, forestry, urban development or industrial practices in the watershed.  In reality, the impact of land use decisions on one lake lot may be relatively small, yet the cumulative impact of those decisions on many lake lots can result in a significant decline in water quality and habitat.  For example, removing shoreline and aquatic vegetation, fertilizing lawns, mowing to the water's edge, installing beach sand blankets, failing septic systems and uncontrolled run-off, all contribute excess nutrients and sediment which degrade water quality and habitat.  Understanding these cumulative impacts and taking steps to avoid or minimize them will help to insure our quality fisheries can be enjoyed by future generations.</p>",

Fall, night electrofishing (with a SR-16S boat) was conducted to sample young-of-the-year (YOY) Walleye.  The boat was set up with two spider array droppers, pulsed DC, 4.5 amps, and 200 volts.  The surface water temperature was 55 degrees F and visibility was poor.  It was calm so all seven stations were able to be sampled.  The total sampling effort was nearly 108 minutes on-time. <br> \n <br> \nThe sampled fish were the result of natural reproduction since Round Lake was not stocked with Walleye fry in 2014.  A total of 37 YOY Walleye were sampled for a catch rate of 20.6/hr on-time.  The fish ranged from 4.4 to 7.0 inches and had a mean length of 5.9 inches.  An estimate 75 or more 15 to 18 inches Walleye were observed throughout the night.  Catch rates in the 10 previous samples ranged from 0 to 63.0 YOY/hr of electrofishing.  However, due to the lack of good sampling stations available for targeting YOY Walleye and highly variable algae and vegetation conditions from year to year, caution should be used when comparing catch rates among years.  In addition, the same sampling stations are seldom sampled consistently due to the poor conditions and or weather. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

The walleye abundance and growth rates are near the state averages.  The northern pike catch rate has increased to an all time high and growth rates are high for age 2 and 3 fish, suggesting good reproductive success, low mortality for younger fish, and abundance of forage fish.  The yellow perch catch rate and growth rate of all age classes are above the state average.  Black bullhead abundance has decreased dramatically since previous studies.

                "narrative": "<p>Round Lake is a 2,828 acre lake located on the west side of Squaw Lake, MN.  The lake has two public accesses and moderate shoreline development.  The 1998 lake management plan indicates walleye as the primary species of management with northern pike and yellow perch as secondary species.The walleye gill-net catch rate (5.7 fish/net) nearly attained the management goal of 6.1 fish/net.  Previous assessment catch rates have varied from 3.3 to 11.2 since 1954.  The sampled fish ranged from 7.2 to 20.6 inches and averaged 16.9 inches.  Eight year classes were identified from scale analysis with fish from one to nine years old.  There did not appear to be any one dominant year class.  A minimum of 65% of the fish were from years in which no stocking occurred.  Since some natural production likely occurred in years with stocking, the natural contribution to the population would be higher than the observed 65%.  Growth was similar to statewide averages for all ages through age 6 and somewhat slower for older fish.  After four years of growth walleye averaged 16.4 inches.The northern pike gill-net catch was 17.0 fish/net in 2001 which is higher than most lakes similar to Round Lake.  Northern pike gill-net catch rates have been high but fairly stable (13.1 to 18.2 fish/net) since 1989.  Prior to 1989, catch rates ranged from 6.6 to 10.9 fish/gill net dating back to 1954.  We cannot be sure what has led to this increase but it is certainly to the detriment of the northern pike population and fish community.  Over abundant northern populations usually experience slow growth, high natural mortality, and few large fish.  The fish in 2001 ranged from 14.6 to 26.9 inches and average 19.2 inches.  Six year classes were identified from bone and scale samples ranging from one to six years old.  Northern pike averaged 20.7 inches after four year of growth which was near the statewide average of 20.5. The black crappie trap-net catch was 0.9 fish/net which was about average for this type of lake.  The catch rates have fluctuated from 0.2 to 2.4 fish/net since 1954.  In 2001, the fish ranged from 7.5 to 12.0 inches and averaged 10.0 inches.  Five year classes from three to seven years old were sampled with no dominant year classes.  Growth was generally above statewide averages for all ages.The bluegill population has never been very abundant with catch rates typically below the 1st quartile of 4.4 fish/net.  The 2001 trap-net catch rates was 4.8 fish/net which was the highest ever recorded.  Bluegill ranged from 3.2 to 8.3 inches with a mean length of 5.8 inches.  Age and growth information was not collected in this assessment.Yellow perch gill-net catch rates have fluctuated from a low of 29.7 fish/net in 1954 to a high of 102.7 fish/net in 1983.  In 2001, the catch was 35.9 fish/net which was between the lake class median and 3rd quartile.  Size structure had PSD, RSD-P, and RSD-M values of 72, 33 and 0, respectively.  Although the yellow perch population is healthy in terms of numbers and size structure, it may not receive much fishing pressure due to the frequency of the parasite yellow grub.  Age and growth information was not sampled in this assessment.Tullibee are a species that can be difficult to sample but are important to fish communities as a prey source.  The gill-net catch rate was 1.3 fish/net in this assessment which falls between the 1st quartile and median for this lake class.  Tullibee catch rates have been as low as 0.3 fish/net and as high as 1.7 fish/net with no apparent trend in abundance.  The fish ranged from 8.1 to 19.3 inches and had a mean length of 14.9 inches.Other species observed during the population assessment included bowfin, black bullhead, brown bullhead, burbot, golden redhorse, largemouth bass, pumpkinseed sunfish, rock bass, shorthead redhorse, tadpole madtom, white sucker, and yellow bullhead.To promote and maintain healthy fish populations, pollution needs to be controlled.  Fish habitat is directly affected by water quality.  Nutrients, sediments and other waste can drastically alter the chemical and physical characteristics of a lake.  People often associate water quality problems in a lake with agricultural, forestry or industrial practices within the watershed.  Although these can be areas of concern, lakeshore property owners may also contribute to water quality problems.  Some examples include putting in sand beaches, removing shoreline trees and vegetation, fertilizing lawns, and mowing their lawns down to the lakeshore.  Proper land use practices by everyone will help insure that this fishery can be enjoyed by future generations. </p>",

Night electrofishing was conducted on 9/28/2006 to sample young-of-the-year walleye.    Visibility was fair to moderate varying between stations due to low water levels and abundant vegetation. The temperature of the water was 12.5 C (54.5 F) and conductivity was 215 umhos.  <br> \n\tThis is the third time MNDNR has conducted a fall assessment for young-of-the-year walleye, locations were the same as in the past surveys.  The sixth station was not completed due to mechanical failure of the boat.  The Leech Lake Division of Resource Management (LLDRM) had also conducted fall electrofishing previous to 2004. <br> \n\tThirty-five young-of-the-year walleye were sampled in five stations for a catch rate of 28/hour run-time compared to 7.6 fish/hour in the 2005 survey.  Three additional young-of-the-year walleye were observed but not captured.  The walleye captured ranged in length between 6.5 and 8.0 inches with a mean length of 7.4 inches.  In the previous two surveys, the mean length was 7.1 and 4.1inches, respectfully.  Even with the low water level, the size and number of fish captured indicates that natural reproduction and first year growth was fairly successful in 2006.  Round Lake has not been stocked since the spring of 2004. <br> \n\tIn addition to the young-of-the-year walleye captured, approximately 45 other walleye were observed.  Also noted was a fair amount of young-of-the-year yellow perch at a couple of stations and an abundance of bluegills and crappies at one station in particular. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Round Lake is a class 27 lake located on the west side of Squaw Lake, MN.  The lake has two public accesses and moderate shoreline development.  The 2014 lake management plan indicates Walleye and Northern Pike were the primary management species with Yellow Perch as a secondary species. <br> \n <br> \nRound Lake has received various special regulations to improve the fishery in the last 15 years.  In the spring of 2005 and 2007, special Walleye and Northern Pike regulations were implemented.  The Walleye slot length limit requires the release of all fish between 17 and 26 inches and only one over 26 inches could be in possession.  The Northern Pike slot length limit required the release of all fish between 22 to 36 inches and only one over 36 inches could be possessed (nine fish bag limit).  The Northern Pike special regulation was dropped in 2017 in favor of the North-Central Zone regulation in 2019, which was anticipated to produce similar results and reduce regulation complexity. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye catch rates have fluctuated from 3.3 to 11.2 since 1954.  The catch rates in six of the last eight surveys ranged from 5.1 to 5.7 fish/gill net.  In 2019, the Walleye gill-net catch of 5.1 fish/net was average for lakes similar to Round.  The sampled fish ranged from 7.1 to 27.2 inches and averaged 16.6 inches.  Thirteen age-classes were identified with fish from 1 to 16 years old.  Four-year old fish represented the largest age-class.  Growth was similar to statewide averages for all ages up to 10 years old.  Walleye averaged 16.2 inches at age 4.   <br> \n <br> \nThe Round Lake Walleye population has been sustained by natural reproduction for years.  It appears the connecting river systems on Round Lake play a critical role in the natural recruitment of Walleye since the in-lake habitat seems to be marginal.  The population should continue to provide quality fishing opportunities following periods of strong year-classes. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike gill-net catch rates have fluctuated greatly from a low of 4.9 fish/net in 2009 to a high of 22.1 fish/net in 2013.  It is unclear what led to these drastic changes but the 2019 catch of 12.1/net was more representative of the lake average.  The sampled fish ranged from 10.1 to 35.1 inches and averaged 17.9 inches.  Eight year-classes were identified ranging from age 1 to age 10.  Only 5% of the sample were older than age 5.  The lack of older fish in the population is often associated with high angler harvest, but in this case, it may also be related to the high density causing stress and natural mortality.  The voluntary release of Northern Pike longer than 26 inches may have many fish community benefits. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch gill-net catch rates have fluctuated from a low of 9.2 fish/net in 2019 to a high of 102.7 fish/net in 1983.  The record low catch in 2019 remained within the normal range for lakes like Round but was well below the long-term average for Round Lake.  The sampled fish ranged from 4.7 to 11.8 and averaged 8.1 inches.  Although the Yellow Perch size distribution has often been good on Round Lake, the frequency of the parasite yellow grub may limit angler interest. <br> \n <br> \nTullibee is a species that can be difficult to sample but they are important to fish communities as a prey source.  In 2006, the gill-net catch rate of 2.7 fish/net was the highest on record for Round Lake and it was above average for class 27 lakes.  In contrast, only one Tullibee was sampled in 2009, none in 2013, and two in 2019.  Generally, because sampling Tullibee can be challenging, it is difficult to know whether the decline reflects a real change in the population.  However, three years of such low catches does not bode well for the population. <br> \n <br> \nOther species observed during the assessment included Black Bullhead, Black Crappie, Bluegill, Bowfin, Brown Bullhead, Burbot, Hybrid Sunfish, Pumpkinseed Sunfish, Rock Bass, Shorthead Redhorse, White Sucker, and Yellow Bullhead.</p>",

The lake is 2,828 acres and has a maximum depth of 24 feet.  A survey targeting nearshore fish species was conducted by Area fisheries staff beginning on 25 June, 2019.  Twenty-four sampling sites (100 feet long) were evenly spaced around the lake shore, sampling a variety of habitat types.  Each site is sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-ft or 15-ft 1/8th inch mesh seine, depending on habitat condition. <br> \n <br> \nShoreline seining was conducted at 17 sites: 7 with the 15-ft seine and 10 with the 50-ft seine.  Backpack electrofishing was completed at all 24 sites.  Nearshore sampling captured 19 different species: 17 species by seining and 13 species by backpack electrofishing.  The species can be found in the gear-specific catch tables in this report. <br> \n <br> \nNearshore catches will be used with the gill net and trap net data from the standard survey conducted on 24 June, 2019, to calculate a fish-based Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) score which is indicative of lake health.  The surveys will assist the watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency. <br> \n</p>",
