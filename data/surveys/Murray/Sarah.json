                "narrative": "<p>Lake Sarah is a 1,093-acre, class 41 lake, located approximately 4 miles south of the City of Garvin in Murray County. Lake Sarah has a maximum depth of 11.0 feet and a watershed to lake ratio of 10 to 1. Lake Sarah is managed primarily for Walleye and secondarily for Yellow Perch.  Lake Sarah's Walleye population is one of two Walleye populations in the Windom fisheries management area that is sustained through natural reproduction alone, as it has not been stocked since 1991.  An egg take from Lake Sarah Walleye was started in the spring of 2015.  As a result of that egg take and the precedent of returning a certain percentage of those fish back to the egg source, we stocked approximately 100,000 fry (100 fry/acre) in 2015 and 200,000 fry (200 fry/acre) in 2016 and 2017.  Fry were not stocked in 2018 or 2019.  We determined that the Walleye population will maintain itself naturally.   <br> \n <br> \nA genetics study found that Lake Sarah's Walleye are unique to the Cannon River in east-central Minnesota, which was used as an egg source decades ago by the Waterville Office.  The study suggested that this Lower Mississippi strain (LMS) of Walleye has persisted in some southern waters despite extensive stocking of a northern \"Mississippi strain\" Walleye.  The study also suggested that the LMS strain of Walleye in Lake Sarah is able to naturally reproduce, thereby creating a self-sustaining population.  This is the hope for additional southern Minnesota Lakes that are now stocked with LMS Walleye.    <br> \n <br> \nAnnual fall night electrofishing is done on the lake to monitor natural reproduction.  Below is a table with historical catch data.  The catch of Young-of-the-Year (YOY) Walleye in 2019 was 163.6 per hour, which follows a moderate catch rate of 81.0 in 2018 and very high catch rates in 2016 (337.3) and 2017 (288.0).  The 2016 catch rate of 337.3 per hour was the greatest on record.  Year class suppression has been documented in populations that have consecutive big year classes; however, this has not yet been observed on Lake Sarah.  A poor year class has proven to be less than 20 YOY per hour, therefore, the potential for strong year classes is very good in Lake Sarah.  The 2019 year class could prove to be a very successful addition to the population.  Walleye reproduction will be monitored annually to assess natural reproduction. <br> \n <br> \nHistoric catch rates for young-of-the-year (YOY) Walleye during fall night electrofishing on Lake Sarah.  <br> \nDate\tTotal N\tMean Length\tCatch Rate (n/hour) <br> \n10/7/2019\t180\t8.5\t163.6 <br> \n10/16/2018\t81\t9.2\t81.0 <br> \n10/10/2017\t216\t7.7\t288.0 <br> \n9/27/2016\t253\t8.2\t337.3 <br> \n10/6/2015\t32\t9.0\t28.6 <br> \n10/15/2014\t350\t7.8\t244.2 <br> \n10/7/2013\t293\t8.1\t290.4 <br> \n10/11/2012\t193\t8.4\t186.7 <br> \n10/20/2011\t312\t8.2\t301.5 <br> \n9/21/2010\t162\t8.2\t149.5 <br> \n9/28/2006\t56\t9.5\t74.7 <br> \n10/10/2005\t145\t9.1\t96.7 <br> \n9/28/2004\t77\t7.7\t77.0 <br> \n10/8/2003\t12\t9.1\t16.0 <br> \n9/18/2001\t174\t7.2\t139.2 <br> \n9/24/2000\t90\t7.1\t60.0 <br> \n9/16/1999\t101\t6.9\t93.2 <br> \n9/24/1998\t105\t8.1\t105.0 <br> \n10/14/1997\t61\t7.1\t40.7 <br> \n9/29/1996\t183\t6.4\t183.0 <br> \n10/9/1995\t50\t7.6\t33.3 <br> \n10/13/1994\t296\t7.9\t197.3 <br> \n10/14/1993\t86\t7.4\t57.3 <br> \n</p>",

In other words, the only way these unique genetics persisted in some of these southern waters is through natural reproduction through the decades. The study also suggested that the LMS strain of Walleye in Lake Sarah is able to naturally reproduce, thereby creating a self-sustaining population. An egg take from Lake Sarah Walleye was started in the spring of 2015 to utilize these genetics in southern Minnesota. It is the goal to create other southern Minnesota lakes with similar self-sustaining populations and thereby creating additional egg take lakes and establish genetic conservation.  <br> \n  <br> \nAnnual fall night electrofishing is done on the lake to monitor natural reproduction. Two-hours of night electrofishing was conducted on October 9, 2023 to assess natural reproduction. Below is a table with historical catch data. The catch of age-0 (YOY) Walleye was 1,344.50 per hour, which is the greatest on record. It should be noted there were too many age-0 Walleye to dip so the catch rate is a count after dipping the first 20 fish for measurement. Average length of Walleye sampled was 9.3 inches (Table 1). The Average length in 2023 was just shy of the largest average length (9.5 inches) observed in 2006. Year class suppression has been documented in populations that have consecutive big year classes; however, this has not yet been observed on Lake Sarah. A poor year class has proven to be less than 30 YOY per hour for Lake Sarah and when fish don't reach 5 inches or greater by fall, therefore, the potential for strong year classes is excellent in Lake Sarah. The 2023 year class could prove to be one of the most consequential, not only in Lake Sarah, but in southern Minnesota. Walleye reproduction will be monitored annually to assess natural reproduction and determine if egg take operations are causing a change in reproduction potential of the Lake Sarah population. To date, there have been no adverse impacts realized to the Lake Sarah Walleye population as a result of the annual egg-take operation. However, in the event that we do see any adverse impacts, egg-take operations may need to cease.   <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nTable 1.

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Sarah, near the town of Garvin in Murray County, is a class 41 lake with a maximum depth of 11 feet.  Lake Sarah is a 1093 acre lake within the West Des Moines River watershed.  Lake Sarah is managed primarily for walleye and secondarily for yellow perch.  Lake Sarah is an excellent walleye lake that is solely maintained by a naturally reproducing population.  There are only two lakes in the Windom Fisheries Management that are not stocked with walleye due to excellent natural reproduction.  Lake Sarah is consistently a top walleye fishing lake in the Windom Fisheries management area.  A population assessment was conducted during the week of June 7, 2010 using 2 gill nets and 12 trap nets to assess the fish community. <br> \n <br> \nThe walleye catch rate in gill nets was 45.5/set, which is approximately 3 times the normal upper range.  The average length of walleye sampled in the gill nets was 16 inches with fish ranging in length from 9 to 24 inches.  The majority of the walleye sampled were 14 to 16 inches.  The walleye catch rate in trap nets was 0.7/set, which is average for lake class 41.  Walleye in the trap nets had a mean length of 24 inches with a range of 15 to 29 inches.  The walleye population appears to be made up of larger sized fish.  While this may be true, boat mounted electrofishing during the fall indicated a very strong walleye hatch in the spring of 2010.  Newly hatched walleye were caught at a rate of 149.5/hour, which is the highest since catch rate since 1996 (183/hour) and the third highest catch rate of newly hatched walleye ever recorded (highest in 1994 at 197/hour).  With that said, the population appears to be headed toward a balanced state with the emergence of a very successful 2010 year class.  The overall condition of the walleyes captured in all sampling gear was good, indicating the walleye were healthy and foraging successfully.  The growth rate of walleye was very good with walleye reaching 9 to 10 inches during their first year of growth and reaching 16 inches by age three.  Lake Sarah has not had walleye stocked since 1991 and continues to be and exceptional walleye fishery.  There is no question that Lake Sarah should be your destination of choice for walleye fishing in southwestern Minnesota. <br> \n <br> \nThe yellow perch catch rate in gill nets (22.5/set) and trap nets (2.4/set) were equal to the upper normal range in 2010.  The yellow perch population ranges in length from 6 to 14 inches with an average length of 9 inches (half pound average per fish).  The half pound weight average is the highest observed average weight indicating a population with larger individuals.  The overall condition was good, which indicates the fish are plump, healthy, and foraging successfully.  With yellow perch up to 14 inches found in Lake Sarah, there is always a chance for some great yellow perch fishing. <br> \n <br> \nThe black bullhead catches are the lowest since sampling began in 1984.  Total lengths of bullhead ranged from 12 to 13 inches with a mean of 12 inches.  It appears that the black bullhead population is being dominated by one age group.  It is likely that the large walleye population is controlling the bullhead population producing only a few larger black bullheads, which will still produce a respectable bullhead fishery in Lake Sarah. <br> \n <br> \nThe black crappie catch rate in trap nets was the highest ever observed at 54.6 fish/net, which was over 4 times the upper normal range.  Total lengths ranged from 3 to 13 inches with a mean of 5 inches.  Over the past four years there have been 2 large year classes (fish of the same age) black crappie, one year class ranges in length from 3 to 5 inches and the other ranges in length from 7 to 9 inches.  The size distribution is good indicating that the black crappie population is in a balanced state.  The overall condition of the black crappie was above average indicating a robust population that is eating well.  In Lake Sarah there is a chance to catch a large black crappie and the probability of catching a large black crappie will increase as year classes mature. <br> \n <br> \nA total of 11 species of fish were captured during the survey of 2010.  Other species captured were bigmouth buffalo, brown bullhead, channel catfish, common carp, orangespotted sunfish, white sucker, and yellow bullhead. <br> \n <br> \nEfforts to improve the health of the lake should focus on best management practices within the watershed (a watershed is all areas that drain into the lake).  Improvements and education in land stewardship will often have secondary benefits to the lake in the way of quality and quantity of habitat.  Generally, improvements in the quality and quantity of lake habitat will mean direct improvements of the fishery. <br> \n <br> \nPrepared by Nate Hodgins <br> \n</p>",

Lake Sarah has a maximum depth of 11.0 feet and a watershed to lake ratio of 10 to 1. Lake Sarah is managed primarily for walleye and secondarily for yellow perch.  Lake Sarah's walleye population is one of two walleye populations in the Windom fisheries management area that is sustained through natural reproduction alone, as it has not been stocked since 1991.  An egg take from Lake Sarah walleye was started in the spring of 2015.  As a result of that egg take and the precedent of returning a certain percentage of those fish back to the egg source, we have stocked approximately 100000 fry (100 fry/acre) in 2015 and 200000 fry (200 fry/acre) in 2016 and 2017.  A recent genetics study found that Lake Sarah's walleye are unique to the Cannon River in east-central Minnesota, which was used as an egg source decades ago.  The study suggested that this Lower Mississippi strain (LMS) of Walleye has persisted in some southern waters despite extensive stocking of \"Mississippi strain\" walleye.  The study also suggested that the LMS strain of walleye in Lake Sarah is able to naturally reproduce, thereby creating a self-sustaining population.  Annual fall night electrofishing is done on the lake to monitor natural reproduction.  Below is a table with historical catch data.  The catch of Young-of-the-Year (YOY) walleye in 2017 was 288.0 per hour, which follows the 2016 catch rate of 337.3 per hour, the greatest on record.  Genetic analysis indicated that approximately 37 percent of the 150 fin clips analyzed were from stocked Walleye fry, thus 63 percent of the 2017 year class can be assumed to be naturally reproduced.  Year class suppression (failures or reductions in success) has been documented in populations that have consecutive big year classes; however, this has not yet been observed on Lake Sarah.  The 2017 year class could prove to be a very successful addition to the population.  Walleye reproduction will be monitored again in the fall of 2018 to assess natural reproduction.  <br> \n <br> \nHistoric catch rates for young-of-the-year (YOY) walleye during fall night electrofishing on Lake Sarah.  <br> \nDate\tTotal N\tMean Length\tCatch Rate (n/hour) <br> \n10/10/2017\t216\t7.7\t288.0 <br> \n9/27/2016\t253\t8.2\t337.3 <br> \n10/6/2015\t32\t9.0\t28.6 <br> \n10/15/2014\t350\t7.8\t244.2 <br> \n10/7/2013\t293\t8.1\t290.4 <br> \n10/11/2012\t193\t8.4\t186.7 <br> \n10/20/2011\t312\t8.2\t301.5 <br> \n9/21/2010\t162\t8.2\t149.5 <br> \n9/28/2006\t56\t9.5\t74.7 <br> \n10/10/2005\t145\t9.1\t96.7 <br> \n9/28/2004\t77\t7.7\t77 <br> \n10/8/2003\t12\t9.1\t16 <br> \n9/18/2001\t174\t7.2\t139.2 <br> \n9/24/2000\t90\t7.1\t60 <br> \n9/16/1999\t101\t6.9\t93.2 <br> \n9/24/1998\t105\t8.1\t105 <br> \n10/14/1997\t61\t7.1\t40.7 <br> \n9/29/1996\t183\t6.4\t183 <br> \n10/9/1995\t50\t7.6\t33.3 <br> \n10/13/1994\t296\t7.9\t197.3 <br> \n10/14/1993\t86\t7.5\t57.3 <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

During the egg take process, we are able to take genetic tissue from every Walleye used for egg production.  As a result of that tissue sampling, we are able to tell if the Walleye fry stocked from the egg take are a result of stocking or natural reproduction.  So this allows us to determine the percentage of contribution the put-back fry was toward the capture of all Age-0 Walleye in the fall.  The small number of put-back fry was close to 30% with high total catch rates.  The take home message is the number of young-of-the-year Walleye was extremely high and the contribution of put-back fry was not needed.  Put-back fry have not been stocked since 2017 and determined that the Walleye population will maintain itself naturally.  Given the fact that we are able to electrofish Lake Sarah for Age-0 Walleye each Fall, we will be able to monitor the situation and make changes to the put-back fry if the population begins to falter.  No stocking of Walleye fry from egg-take stations was done statewide in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic and spring shutdown of close contact work.  However, in 2021, the egg-take operations were restarted with enhanced safety protocols for close contact work.  <br> \n <br> \nA genetics study found that Lake Sarah's Walleye are unique to the Cannon River in east-central Minnesota, which was used as an egg source decades ago by the Waterville Office.

This is the hope for additional southern Minnesota Lakes that are now stocked with LMS Walleye.    <br> \n <br> \nAnnual fall night electrofishing is done on the lake to monitor natural reproduction.  Two-hours of night electrofishing was conducted on 14 October 2021 to assess natural reproduction.  Below is a table with historical catch data.  The catch of Young-of-the-Year (YOY) Walleye in 2021 was 440.0 per hour, which is the 2nd greatest on record.  This follows a consecutive trend of high catch rates since 2016 and occurs right after the greatest observed catch rate in 2020 (468.5 per hour).  Year class suppression has been documented in populations that have consecutive big year classes; however, this has not yet been observed on Lake Sarah.  A poor year class has proven to be less than 50 YOY per hour for Lake Sarah, therefore, the potential for strong year classes is very good in Lake Sarah.  The 2021 year class could prove to be a very successful addition to the population.  Walleye reproduction will be monitored annually to assess natural reproduction and determine if egg take operations are causing a change in reproduction potential of the Lake Sarah population.  To date, there have been no adverse impacts realized to the Lake Sarah Walleye population as a result of the annual egg-take operation.  However, in the event that we do see any adverse impacts, egg-take operations may need to cease.   <br> \n <br> \nHistoric catch rates for young-of-the-year (YOY) Walleye during fall night electrofishing on Lake Sarah.  <br> \n <br> \nDate\t        Total N Mean Length\t Catch Rate (n/hour) <br> \n10/14/2021\t880\t8.4\t440.0 <br> \n10/7/2020\t937\t8.2\t468.5 <br> \n10/7/2019\t180\t8.5\t163.6 <br> \n10/16/2018\t81\t9.2\t81.0 <br> \n10/10/2017\t216\t7.7\t288.0 <br> \n9/27/2016\t253\t8.2\t337.3 <br> \n10/6/2015\t32\t9.0\t28.6 <br> \n10/15/2014\t350\t7.8\t244.2 <br> \n10/7/2013\t293\t8.1\t290.4 <br> \n10/11/2012\t193\t8.4\t186.7 <br> \n10/20/2011\t312\t8.2\t301.5 <br> \n9/21/2010\t162\t8.2\t149.5 <br> \n9/28/2006\t56\t9.5\t74.7 <br> \n10/10/2005\t145\t9.1\t96.7 <br> \n9/28/2004\t77\t7.7\t77.0 <br> \n10/8/2003\t12\t9.1\t16.0 <br> \n9/18/2001\t174\t7.2\t139.2 <br> \n9/24/2000\t90\t7.1\t60.0 <br> \n9/16/1999\t101\t6.9\t93.2 <br> \n9/24/1998\t105\t8.1\t105.0 <br> \n10/14/1997\t61\t7.1\t40.7 <br> \n9/29/1996\t183\t6.4\t183.0 <br> \n10/9/1995\t50\t7.6\t33.3 <br> \n10/13/1994\t296\t7.9\t197.3 <br> \n10/14/1993\t86\t7.4\t57.3 <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Sarah, near the town of Garvin, is a class 41 lake with a maximum depth of 11 feet.  This premier walleye lake encompasses 1093 acres within the West Fork of the De Moines watershed in Murray County.  Lake Sarah is managed primarily for walleyes and secondarily for yellow perch.  Lake Sarah is one of the top walleye fisheries in the Windom Management Area and much of the success is attributed to the consistent natural reproduction.  Lake Sarah is one of two lakes within the Windom Area that is not stocked with walleyes due to consistent natural reproduction.  Fisheries studies have shown that stocking fry on top of naturally produced fish does not usually supplement the population and may actually be a detriment to the long term fishery, as well as not being cost effective.  On June 10-13 of 2002 a resurvey was conducted on Lake Sarah utilizing 5 gill nets, 8 trap nets, and 5 standard seine hauls.The walleye catch rate in gill nets was 25.8/set which was higher than expected for this type of a lake.  The average weight of walleye captured was 1.67 pounds which was within the expected range.  Much of the information collected from test netting information from this lake indicates the walleye fishery is doing quite well.  This population continues to be a mainstay for walleye \"goers\" in this area.  Not only is the population healthy, but there almost always seems to be a good chance at a trophy.  Growth rates of walleye taken during the survey indicated a \"balanced\" population with good broodstock available for years to come.  The fourteen inch fish being caught are likely from the 2000 year class.  Based on walleye fry survival from stocked populations, 2000 was an excellent year for natural reproduction and survival of fry.  Environmental conditions in the spring of 2000 may have been conducive to natural reproduction and fry survival.  The take home message is that the walleye population is doing quite well and would be worthy of some angler hours.  At the time of sampling, we collected a small clip of a fin and sexed each walleye so genetic DNA analysis could be done.  Preliminary results indicate a portion of the population is not from parent stock of any strains currently stocked by the DNR.  That segment of the population is more similar to other naturally reproducing southern walleye populations found in earlier studies.  This observation may warrant further investigation and may provide some answers as to the success of the natural reproduction in Lake Sarah.  The yellow perch catch rate in gill nets was 30.40/set which was higher than other Windom area lakes.  Based on historical catches, yellow perch numbers have been consistently at or greater than expected for most surveys done on Lake Sarah.  Total lengths averaged 8.61 inches, and growth rates were quite good as 2 year old perch averaged 8.17 inches.  Relative weights, an indication of plumpness were high for most length groups, which is an indication that all of the fish were in excellent condition.  Yellow perch in the eight inch range are desired by most anglers and can provide excellent table fare.  The high catch rates along with the nice size structure of the yellow perch populations would make this an excellent destination for great fishing.    During our seining effort, many fathead minnows were captured which provide the forage base for Lake Sarah fish.  Interestingly, our seining efforts also captured 1 Age 0 or newly hatched channel catfish which was the first time a channel catfish of any size has ever been captured in Lake Sarah.  This fish was likely a result of a successful spawning in Lake Sarah by adult fish.  It is highly probable that these adult fish came from Lake Shetek where their presence is well known.  Our office also received a call in the fall of 2002 from a property owner observing small channel catfish near their dock which was also an indication of successful channel catfish spawn in 2002.  It is likely that this population of fish will become more established in the years to come and may provide an additional fishery.  Channel catfish information from other Windom lakes indicates that channel catfish can provide some control or check over the black bullhead population.A total of fourteen species of fish were captured during the survey of 2002.  Other species captured were bigmouth buffalo, black crappie, brown bullhead, common carp, northern pike, white sucker, creek chub, orangespotted sunfish, yellow bullhead, and fathead minnow.To promote and maintain healthy fish populations, pollution and other inputs need to be controlled.  Fish habitats are directly affected by water quality.  Nutrient, sediment and other waste inputs can drastically alter the biological, chemical, and physical components of a lake.  It is paramount to maintain if not improve the current water quality of Lake Sarah through watershed management to preserve this fishery for future generations to enjoy.

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Sarah, near the town of Garvin, is a class 41 lake with a maximum depth of 11 feet.  This premier walleye lake encompasses just over 1,000 acres within the West Fork of the Des Moines watershed in Murray County.  DNR Wildlife has been working to improve Lake Maria, directly upstream from Lake Sarah for several years, by constructing an electric fish barrier and initiating a draw down combined with a partial rotenone treatment.  The draw down of Lake Maria was started in the fall of 2006, along with a partial rotenone treatment during the winter of 2006-2007.  Power to the electric barrier was turned on in the spring of 2007.  No negative impact to the fishery in Lake Sarah is anticipated.  Lake Sarah continues to be one of the top walleye fisheries in the Windom Management Area and much of the success is attributed to the consistent natural reproduction.  Lake Sarah is one of two lakes within the Windom Area that is not stocked with walleyes due to consistent natural reproduction.  A population assessment was conducted during the week of June 5, 2006 using 2 gill nets and 11 trap nets. <br> \n <br> \nThe walleye catch rate in gill nets was 60.5/set, which was nearly 4 times the normal upper range.  Most of the fish sampled were in the 14 to 16 inch range and from a strong year class of naturally reproduced fish in 2004.  The walleyes were quite plump which indicated the fish are finding forage successfully.  Growth rates of walleye were exceptional as an Age 3 walleye was nearly 18 inches in length.  Lake Sarah has not had walleye stocked since 1991 and continues to be an exceptional walleye fishery.  Natural reproduction has been consistently good, if not exceptional, based on our fall electrofishing each year.  The 2006 fall electrofishing assessment documented nearly 75 Age 0 walleye per hour that averaged 9.5 inches in length.  There is no question that Lake Sarah would be worth fishing in 2007. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch numbers are higher than the normal upper range.  Total lengths ranged from 7.4 to 12.8 inches and averaged 9.2 inches.  Growth was exceptional as the average length Age 3 yellow perch was 9.8 inches.  As with other gamefish in Lake Sarah, the fish are plump, healthy, and seem to be foraging successfully on the abundant fathead minnows.  <br> \n <br> \nBlack bullhead numbers were average and total lengths ranged from 4.9 to 14.2 inches and averaged 11.4 inches.  It is likely the large walleye population abundance is controlling black bullhead abundance and thereby maintaining large black bullheads.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie numbers were as expected and averaged 10.0 inches in length.  Most of the fish sampled were in the 9.5 to 10.5 inch range.  Condition of black crappie was quite good and growth was exceptional.  No doubt about it, crappie anglers targeting some \"slabs\" will be happy with the action and sizes of fish. <br> \n <br> \nA total of 13 species of fish were captured during the survey of 2006.  Other species captured were bigmouth buffalo, common carp, green sunfish, hybrid sunfish, orangespotted sunfish, white crappie, white sucker, and yellow bullhead. <br> \n <br> \nEfforts to improve the health of the lake should focus on best management practices within the watershed.  Improvements and education in land stewardship will often have secondary benefits to the lake in the way of quality and quantity of habitat.  Generally, improvements in the quality and quantity of lake habitat will mean direct improvements of the fishery. <br> \n <br> \nPrepared by <br> \n <br> \nRyan Doorenbos <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p> Lake Sarah is a 1,093-acre, class 41 lake, located approximately 4 miles south of the City of Garvin in Murray County. Lake Sarah has a maximum depth of 11.0 feet and a watershed-to-lake ratio of 10-to-1. Lake Sarah is managed primarily for Walleye and secondarily for Yellow Perch.  Lake Sarah's Walleye population is unique in the Windom fisheries management area. It is sustained through natural reproduction alone, as it has not been stocked since 1991.  An egg take from Lake Sarah Walleye was started in the spring of 2015.  As a result of that egg take and the Minnesota precedent of returning a certain percentage of those fish back to the egg source, we stocked approximately 100,000 fry (100 fry/acre) in 2015 and 200,000 fry (200 fry/acre) in 2016 and 2017.  During the Walleye egg take on Lake Sarah and by taking genetic tissue from every broodstock Walleye used for egg take we are able to tell if the Walleye fry stocked are a result of stocking or natural reproduction.  So, from 2015-2017, we were able to determine the percentage of contribution the put-back fry was toward the capture of all Age-0 Walleye in the fall.  The take home message is the number of Age-0 Walleye was extremely high and the contribution of put-back fry was low and not needed.  Put-back fry have not been stocked since 2017.  We determined that the Walleye population will maintain itself naturally.  Given we are able to electrofish Lake Sarah for Age-0 Walleye each Fall, we will be able to monitor the situation and make changes to the put-back fry if the population begins to falter.  No stocking of Walleye fry from egg-take stations was done statewide in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic and spring shutdown of close contact work.  However, in 2021, the egg-take operations were restarted with enhanced safety protocols for close contact work. During 2022, there was a return to more normal operations that were done from 2015 to 2019.   <br> \n <br> \nA genetics study found that Lake Sarah's Walleye are unique to the Cannon River in east-central Minnesota, which was used as an egg take source decades ago by the Waterville Office.  The study suggested that this Lower Mississippi strain (LMS) of Walleye has persisted in some southern waters despite extensive stocking of a northern \"Mississippi strain\" Walleye and the fact that the LMS Walleye egg take and subsequent stocking ended decades ago.  In other words, the only way these unique genetics persisted in some of these southern waters is through natural reproduction all of these decades.  The study also suggested that the LMS strain of Walleye in Lake Sarah is able to naturally reproduce, thereby creating a self-sustaining population.  It is the goal to create other southern Minnesota lakes with similar self-sustaining populations and thereby creating additional egg take lakes and put genetic conservation to work.   <br> \n <br> \nAnnual fall night electrofishing is done on the lake to monitor natural reproduction.  Two-hours of night electrofishing was conducted on 10 October 2022 to assess natural reproduction.  Below is a table with historical catch data.  The catch of Young-of-the-Year (YOY) Walleye in 2022 was 425.0 per hour, which is the 3rd greatest on record.  This follows a consecutive trend of high catch rates since 2020 (Figure 1).  While the catch rate remained high in 2022, the mean length of Walleye sampled was 6.4 inches (Table 1).  The mean length in 2022 was equal to the lowest ever recorded in 1996.  However, the year classes in the 1990's were some of the most successful in Lake Sarah and indicates a smaller size fish is not a negative result.  Year class suppression has been documented in other populations that have consecutive big year classes; however, this has not yet been observed on Lake Sarah.  A poor year class has proven to be less than 50 YOY per hour for Lake Sarah and when fish don't reach 5 inches or greater by fall, therefore, the potential for strong year classes is very good in Lake Sarah.  The 2022 year class could prove to be a very successful addition to the population.  Walleye reproduction will be monitored annually to assess natural reproduction and determine if egg take operations are causing a change in reproduction potential of the Lake Sarah population.  To date, there have been no adverse impacts realized to the Lake Sarah Walleye population as a result of the annual egg-take operation.  However, in the event that we do see any adverse impacts, egg-take operations may need to cease.   <br> \n <br> \nTable 1.

Several reports of limits of walleye being caught in the 2 - 7 lb. range were reported by anglers in July.  Lake survey netting results indicated a high population of walleye for lakes similar to Sarah (Loon and Shetek).  Walleye up to 27 inches in length were caught in the survey.  The majority of walleye measured were between 14 and 17 inches in length.  The average weight of walleye sampled was 1.5 lbs.  Black crappie numbers are normal for lakes similar to Sarah.  47% of the black crappie measured were 12 inches or longer.  The average weight of black crappie sampled in our nets was just over 3/4 of a lb. which is higher than normal for lakes similar to Sarah.  Results of our survey indicated a good population of perch with an average length of 8.6 inches and a average weight of almost ? lb.  The longest perch measured was 12 inches. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Sarah is a 1,093-acre, class 41 lake, located approximately 4 miles south of the City of Garvin in Murray County. Lake Sarah has a maximum depth of 11.0 feet and a watershed to lake ratio of 10 to 1. Lake Sarah is managed primarily for Walleye and secondarily for Yellow Perch.  Lake Sarah's Walleye population is one of two Walleye populations in the Windom fisheries management area that is sustained through natural reproduction alone, as it has not been stocked since 1991.  An egg take from Lake Sarah Walleye was started in the spring of 2015.  As a result of that egg take and the precedent of returning a certain percentage of those fish back to the egg source, we have stocked approximately 100,000 fry (100 fry/acre) in 2015 and 200,000 fry (200 fry/acre) in 2016 and 2017.  Fry were not stocked in 2018 in a return to allow to Walleye population to maintain itself naturally.  <br> \n  <br> \nA recent genetics study found that Lake Sarah's Walleye are unique to the Cannon River in east-central Minnesota, which was used as an egg source decades ago.  The study suggested that this Lower Mississippi strain (LMS) of Walleye has persisted in some southern waters despite extensive stocking of \"Mississippi strain\" Walleye.  The study also suggested that the LMS strain of Walleye in Lake Sarah is able to naturally reproduce, thereby creating a self-sustaining population.  <br> \n  <br> \nAnnual fall night electrofishing is done on the lake to monitor natural reproduction.  Below is a table with historical catch data.  The catch of Young-of-the-Year (YOY) Walleye in 2018 was 81.0 per hour, which follows high catch rates in 2017 and 2016.  The 2016 catch rate of 337.3 per hour was the greatest on record.  Year class suppression has been documented in populations that have consecutive big year classes; however, this has not yet been observed on Lake Sarah.  A successful year class has proven to be greater than or equal to 30 YOY per hour.  The 2018 year class could prove to be a very successful addition to the population as we have seen abundances greater than 30 but less than 150 per hour resulting in strong year classes for anglers.  Walleye reproduction will be monitored annually to assess natural reproduction. <br> \n <br> \nHistoric catch rates for young-of-the-year (YOY) Walleye during fall night electrofishing on Lake Sarah.  <br> \n <br> \nDate\tTotal N\tMean Length\tCatch Rate (n/hour) <br> \n10/16/2018\t81\t9.2\t81.0 <br> \n10/10/2017\t216\t7.7\t288.0 <br> \n9/27/2016\t253\t8.2\t337.3 <br> \n10/6/2015\t32\t9.0\t28.6 <br> \n10/15/2014\t350\t7.8\t244.2 <br> \n10/7/2013\t293\t8.1\t290.4 <br> \n10/11/2012\t193\t8.4\t186.7 <br> \n10/20/2011\t312\t8.2\t301.5 <br> \n9/21/2010\t162\t8.2\t149.5 <br> \n9/28/2006\t56\t9.5\t74.7 <br> \n10/10/2005\t145\t9.1\t96.7 <br> \n9/28/2004\t77\t7.7\t77 <br> \n10/8/2003\t12\t9.1\t16 <br> \n9/18/2001\t174\t7.2\t139.2 <br> \n9/24/2000\t90\t7.1\t60 <br> \n9/16/1999\t101\t6.9\t93.2 <br> \n9/24/1998\t105\t8.1\t105 <br> \n10/14/1997\t61\t7.1\t40.7 <br> \n9/29/1996\t183\t6.4\t183 <br> \n10/9/1995\t50\t7.6\t33.3 <br> \n10/13/1994\t296\t7.9\t197.3 <br> \n10/14/1993\t86\t7.5\t57.3 <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Sarah is a shallow prairie lake located 10 miles north of Slayton.  Lake Sarah has provided a quality walleye fishery for many years.  The lake is managed for walleye as the primary species with yellow perch as a secondary species.Walleye have not been stocked in Lake Sarah since 1991.  The current management plan calls for annual fall electrofishing to monitor walleye natural reproduction.  Walleye fry will not be stocked unless electrofishing finds less than 35 YOY per hour for two consecutive years.  The 1998 population assessment was the first since this stocking regime was implemented.The walleye population continued to look good in 1998.  The management goal for walleye numbers and size was almost attained.  When compared to lakes similar to Lake Sarah, walleye numbers were better than average.  Walleye ranged from 9 to 26 inches and averaged 2.3 pounds.  Walleye angling should be good for the next few years.  However, as with any fishing, if the walleye have a lot of available prey it makes them more difficult to catch.Yellow perch populations often fluctuate from year to year.  Spring weather conditions, water levels, and the other species in the lake all affect the success of a given year class.  In 1998, yellow perch numbers were higher than the two previous assessments.  Yellow perch ranged from 5 to 11 inches and averaged 8.9.  Yellow perch should provide decent fishing for the next few years.Black crappie numbers were higher in 1998 than in any previous investigation.  Black crappie numbers were better than 75% of lakes similar to Lake Sarah.  Lake Sarah still has some large black crappies but 86% of the fish were from a strong 1996 year class.  Black crappie ranged from 6.1 to 12.6 inches and averaged 7.4 inches.  It should take a year or two before fish from the strong 1996 year class attain sizes that interest anglers.   Lake Sarah generally supports a moderate population of black bullhead.  Black bullhead ranged from 6 to 14 inches and averaged 9.4 inches.  Anglers interested in black bullhead should have no problem finding them on Lake Sarah.  To promote and maintain healthy fish populations, pollution needs to be controlled.  Fish habitat is directly affected by water quality.  Nutrients, sediments and other waste can drastically alter the chemical and physical characteristics of a lake.  It is important to maintain, if not improve, the water quality of Lake Sarah through watershed management.  Improved land use practices should insure that this fishery can be enjoyed by future generations.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Sarah is a 1,093-acre lake located approximately 4 miles south of the City of Garvin in Murray County.  Lake Sarah has a maximum depth of 11.0 ft.  Lake Sarah is managed primarily for Walleye and secondarily for Yellow Perch.  Lake Sarah's Walleye population is sustained through natural reproduction, as it has not been stocked with Walleye since 1991, other than low density put back fry in 2015, 2016, and 2017, because of the egg take.  A genetics study found that Lake Sarah's Walleye are unique to the Cannon River in east-central Minnesota, which was used as an egg source decades ago.  The study suggested that this \"Lower Mississippi Strain\" (LMS) of Walleye has persisted in some southern waters despite extensive stocking of \"Mississippi strain\" Walleye.  To expand LMS Walleye populations in SW MN lakes, an egg take operation was started on Lake Sarah in 2015 and has been done annually except in 2020 (COVID).  Walleye fry produced from this operation are stocked into area lakes in an effort to duplicate Lake Sarah's self-sustaining Walleye population and because they survive better than MIS Walleye.  Additionally, in an effort to conserve and protect these unique Walleye genetics, there is a desire to create other lakes as backups in case of catastrophic winterkill on Lake Sarah.  Now that the lake is infested with Zebra Mussels, Lake Sarah is included in a study examining the effects of Zebra Mussels on Walleye populations across the State of Minnesota.  A standard survey was conducted the week of September 7, 2021 to monitor fish populations using gill nets and trap nets.  <br> \n <br> \nThe 2021 Walleye catch rate was 38.0 per gill net, an increase from the 2018 catch rate of 21.0 per gill net, and well above the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (3.2 to 15.3 per gill net).   Just to put that catch rate in perspective, we don't expect to reach 15.3 per gill net often and it has been exceeded the last two surveys.  Seven year-classes of Walleye were sampled including Walleye from 2014, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021, with the 2020 year class comprising 42 percent of the sample.  The presence of consecutive year-classes suggests that natural reproduction and recruitment occur annually, producing a very stable Walleye population.  The 2021 year class (age-0) was very abundant as they were captured at a rate of 440.0 per hour of electrofishing which was the second highest catch rate ever on Lake Sarah.  Our local research suggests that only 30 Age 0 Walleye can produce a strong year class or great fishing.  Growth of Walleye is fast in Lake Sarah, as mean back-calculated lengths at age-1, age-2, age-3, and age-4 were 8.0, 13.8, 17.3, and 19.4 inches, respectively.  Lengths of Walleye ranged from 6.8 to 27.6 inches and averaged 16.0 inches.  Lake Sarah continues to have one of the best Walleye populations in southern Minnesota.  <br> \n <br> \nPrior to 2021, Yellow Perch catch rates have ranged from 6.5 per gill net in 1989 to 84.7 per gill net in 1984 and have averaged 32.9 per gill net.  The catch rate in 2021 was 156.0 per gill net, which is the highest observed catch rate at Lake Sarah, greatly exceeding the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (3.0 to 22.5 per gill net).  Yellow Perch are an important prey fish in Lake Sarah, given the stable and abundant Walleye population that has existed over the years.  Lengths of Yellow Perch ranged from 4.5 to 12.6 inches and averaged 7.9 inches.  We would expect good Yellow Perch fishing in the next few years.  <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie catch rates have been highly variable ranging from 0.4 per trap net in 2018 to 54.6 per trap net in 2010.  In 2021, the Black Crappie catch rate was 35.3 per trap net, exceeding both the long term average of 14.9 per trap net and the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (1.0 to 12.3 per trap net).  Lengths of Black Crappie ranged from 3.2 to 10.3 inches and averaged 4.7 inches.  Although Black Crappie are not managed in Lake Sarah, an abundant population is present that may provide a quality fishery in a couple of years.  <br> \n <br> \nBlack Bullhead abundance remained low at 15.0 per gill net and 17.0 per trap net.  Black Bullhead lengths ranged from 3.6 to 14.6 inches and averaged 7.2 inches.  Other species sampled included Bigmouth Buffalo, Common Carp, Orangespotted Sunfish, and Yellow Bullhead.   <br> \n</p>",

Lake Sarah has a maximum depth of 11.0 feet and a watershed-to-lake ratio of 10-to-1. Lake Sarah is managed primarily for Walleye and secondarily for Yellow Perch.  Lake Sarah's Walleye population is one of two Walleye populations in the Windom fisheries management area that is sustained through natural reproduction alone, as it has not been stocked since 1991.  An egg take from Lake Sarah Walleye was started in the spring of 2015.  As a result of that egg take and the Minnesota precedent of returning a certain percentage of those fish back to the egg source, we stocked approximately 100,000 fry (100 fry/acre) in 2015 and 200,000 fry (200 fry/acre) in 2016 and 2017.  During the egg take process, we are able to take genetic tissue from every Walleye used for egg production.  As a result of that tissue sample, we are able to tell if the Walleye fry stocked from the egg take are a result of stocking or natural reproduction.  So, in 2015 and 2016, we were able to determine the percentage of contribution the put-back fry was toward the capture of Age-0 walleye in the fall of 2015 and 2016.  Both years, the contribution was close to 30% with high total catch rates in both years.  The take home message is the number of Age-0 Walleye was extremely high and the contribution of put-back fry was not needed.  Put-back fry were not stocked in 2018 and 2019.  We determined that the Walleye population will maintain itself naturally.  Given the fact that we are able to electrofish Lake Sarah for Age-0 Walleye each Fall, we will be able to monitor the situation and make changes to the put-back fry if the population begins to falter.  No stocking of Walleye fry from egg-take stations was done statewide 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic and spring shutdown of close contact work. <br> \n <br> \nA genetics study found that Lake Sarah's Walleye are unique to the Cannon River in east-central Minnesota, which was used as an egg source decades ago by the Waterville Office.  The study suggested that this Lower Mississippi strain (LMS) of Walleye has persisted in some southern waters despite extensive stocking of a northern \"Mississippi strain\" Walleye.  The study also suggested that the LMS strain of Walleye in Lake Sarah is able to naturally reproduce, thereby creating a self-sustaining population.  This is the hope for additional southern Minnesota Lakes that are now stocked with LMS Walleye.    <br> \n <br> \nAnnual fall night electrofishing is done on the lake to monitor natural reproduction.  In addition, the 2020 sampling was utilized to assess statewide natural reproduction of Walleye.  Two-hours of night electrofishing was conducted on 7 October 2020 to assess natural reproduction.  Below is a table with historical catch data.  The catch of Young-of-the-Year (YOY) Walleye in 2020 was 468.5 per hour, which is the greatest on record.  This follows strong year classes in 3 of the past 4 years.  Year class suppression has been documented in populations that have consecutive big year classes; however, this has not yet been observed on Lake Sarah.  A poor year class has proven to be less than 20 YOY per hour, therefore, the potential for strong year classes is very good in Lake Sarah.  The 2020 year class could prove to be a very successful addition to the population.  Walleye reproduction will be monitored annually to assess natural reproduction.  <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nHistoric catch rates for young-of-the-year (YOY) Walleye during fall night electrofishing on Lake Sarah.  <br> \n <br> \nDate\t\tTotal N\tMean Length\tCatch Rate (n/hour) <br> \n10/7/2020\t937\t8.2\t\t468.5 <br> \n10/7/2019\t180\t8.5\t\t163.6 <br> \n10/16/2018\t81\t9.2\t\t81.0 <br> \n10/10/2017\t216\t7.7\t\t288.0 <br> \n9/27/2016\t253\t8.2\t\t337.3 <br> \n10/6/2015\t32\t9.0\t\t28.6 <br> \n10/15/2014\t350\t7.8\t\t244.2 <br> \n10/7/2013\t293\t8.1\t\t290.4 <br> \n10/11/2012\t193\t8.4\t\t186.7 <br> \n10/20/2011\t312\t8.2\t\t301.5 <br> \n9/21/2010\t162\t8.2\t\t149.5 <br> \n9/28/2006\t56\t9.5\t\t74.7 <br> \n10/10/2005\t145\t9.1\t\t96.7 <br> \n9/28/2004\t77\t7.7\t\t77.0 <br> \n10/8/2003\t12\t9.1\t\t16.0 <br> \n9/18/2001\t174\t7.2\t\t139.2 <br> \n9/24/2000\t90\t7.1\t\t60.0 <br> \n9/16/1999\t101\t6.9\t\t93.2 <br> \n9/24/1998\t105\t8.1\t\t105.0 <br> \n10/14/1997\t61\t7.1\t\t40.7 <br> \n9/29/1996\t183\t6.4\t\t183.0 <br> \n10/9/1995\t50\t7.6\t\t33.3 <br> \n10/13/1994\t296\t7.9\t\t197.3 <br> \n10/14/1993\t86\t7.4\t\t57.3 <br> \n</p>",

The seine hauls captured eleven species of fish including Johnny Darter (N=77), Bigmouth Buffalo (N=59), Black Bullhead (N=109), Black Crappie (N=1), Bluegill (N=7), Common Carp (N=123), Common Shiner (N=1), Fathead Minnow (N=497), Orangespotted Sunfish (N=797), Walleye (N=2), and Sand Shiner (N=286). Electrofishing captured 11 species of fish including Johnny Darter (N=14), Iowa Darter (N=6), Bigmouth Buffalo (N=13), Black Bullhead (N=6), Common Carp (N=218), Fathead Minnow (N=78), Orangespotted Sunfish (N=122), Walleye (N=1), and Yellow Perch (N=7). Young-of-the-year Bigmouth Buffalo, Black Bullhead, Walleye, Bluegill, and Common Carp were sampled indicating that natural reproduction occurs in Lake Sarah for these species.  Walleye were not stocked in 2023, so these are the result of natural reproduction. The types of species and their respective abundances in nearshore IBI sampling will be used to determine the overall health of Lake Sarah. The IBI score will provide insight into the quality of habitat and water within the lake and can indicate problems within the watershed that could adversely affect the fish community. The IBI score at Lake Sarah is below the impairment threshold of 36. <br> \n</p>",

THE WALLEYE GILLNET WEIGHT INDEX IS 10.0 TIMES THE STATE MEDIAN AND 4.6 TIMES THE LOCAL MEDIAN. AVERAGE WEIGHT OF THE WALLEYE IN THE GILL NETS WAS 2.27 LBS. THE LENGTH FREQUENCY DISTRIBUTION IS RELATIVELY WIDE, RANGING BETWEEN 9.5 AND 26.5 INCHES WITH A LARGE MODE AT 17.0 INCHES AND A SMALL ONE AT 11.0 INCHES. USING AN AGE-LENGTH KEY, 18% OF THE WALLEYE CAPTURED WITH GILL NETS WERE ESTIMATED TO BE AGE 1, 9% AGE 2, 64% AGE 3, 9% AGE 5 AND 1% AGE 6. SHORELINE SEINING PRODUCED 81.8 YOY WALLEYE PER ACRE SEINED. THE BLACK CRAPPIE TRAPNET CATCH INDEX IS 5.2 TIMES THE STATE MEDIAN AND 2.2 TIMES THE LOCAL MEDIAN. AVERAGE WEIGHT OF THE BLACK CRAPPIE IN THE TRAP NETS WAS 0.72 LBS. THE LENGTH FREQUENCY DISTRI- BUTION RANGES BETWEEN 7.8 AND 12.4 INCHES WITH MODES AT 8.0 AND 10.5 INCHES. USING AN AGE-LENGTH KEY 34% OF THE BLACK CRAPPIE CAPTURED WITH TRAP NETS WERE ESTIMATED TO BE AGE 2, 51% AGE 3, 9% AGE 4 AND 6% AGE 5. NO YOY BLACK CARPPIE WERE CAPTURED WHILE SHORELINE SEINING. THE YELLOW PERCH GILLNET CATCH INDEX IS 19% BELOW THE STATE MEDIAN AND 68% BELOWT THE LOCAL MEDIAN. THE LENGTH FREQUENCY DISTRIBUTION OF THE YELLOW PERCH SAMPLED RANGES BETWEEN 7.5 AND 12.2 INCHES WITH MODES AT 8.0, 10.0 AND 11.0 INCHES. THIRTY TWO PERCENT OF THE YELLOW PERCH CAPTURED IN THE GILL NETS WERE ESTIMATED TO AGE 2, 32% AGE 3, 28% AGE 4 AND 8% WERE AGE 5. SHORELINE SEINING PRO- DUCED 228 YOY YELLOW PERCH PER ACRE SEINED. THE WHITE CRAPPIE TRAPNET CATCH INDEX IS 2.3 TIMES THE STATE MEDIAN AND 12% BELOW THE LOCAL MEDIAN. ALL OF THE WHITE CRAPPIE CAPTURED IN THE TRAP NETS MEASURED BETWEEN 9.0 AND 9.6 INCHES AND WERE ESTIMATED TO BE AGE 2. DURING THE SURVEY ONE NORTHERN PIKE AND ONE WHITE SUCKER WERE CAUGHT IN GILL NETS. ONE BIGMOUTH BUFFALO WAS CAPTURED IN THE TRAP NETS. THE BLACK BULLHEAD TRAPNET CATCH INDEX IS 45.2 TIMES THE STATE MEDIAN AND 1.5 TIMES THE LOCAL MEDIAN. THE LENGTH FREQUENCY DISTRIBUTION OF THE BLACK BULLHEAD SAMPLE IS RELATIVELY NARROW WITH A RANGE FROM 7.0 TO 9.4 INCHES AND WITH A MODE OF 8.5 INCHES. THE CARP TRAPNET CATCH INDEX IS 40% BELOW THE STATE MEDIAN AND 63% BELOW THE LOCAL MEDIAN. THE LENGTH FREQUENCY DISTRIBUTION OF THE CARP SAMPLED RANGES BETWEEN 19.0 AND 26.9 INCHES. AVERAGE WEIGHT OF THE CARP IN THE TRAP NETS WAS 4.9 LBS. THE YELLOW BULLHEAD TRAPNET CATCH INDEX IS 70% BELOW THE STATE MEDIAN AND 1.3 TIMES THE LOCAL MEDIAN. THE LENGTH FREQUENCY DISTRIBUTION OF THE YELLOW BULLHEAD SAMPLED RANGES BETWEEN 8.5 TO 10.4 INCHES.

                "narrative": "<p>INTRODUCTION <br> \nLake Sarah is a 1,093-acre lake located approximately 4 miles south of the City of Garvin in Murray County. Lake Sarah has a maximum depth of 11.0 feet and a watershed to lake ratio of 10 to 1. The lake's watershed is highly agricultural and some of the lake's shoreline has been altered by residential development. In areas with residential development, lawns are typically maintained to the water's edge and shorelines are altered with rock rip rap or sand blankets, which disrupt the natural riparian buffer. Agriculture and development in the riparian zone likely account for much of the nutrient load going into Lake Sarah, which causes poor water quality in the lake. During this survey in early June, Lake Sarah had a secchi depth reading of 2.4 feet; however, the water quality declined as the summer progressed. Lake Sarah is managed primarily for Walleye and secondarily for Yellow Perch. Lake Sarah's Walleye population is one of the only Walleye populations in the Windom fisheries management area that is sustained through natural reproduction, as it has not been stocked since 1991. A recent genetics study found that Lake Sarah's Walleye are unique to the Cannon River in east-central Minnesota, which was used as an egg source decades ago. The study suggested that this \"Cannon River strain\" of Walleye has persisted in some southern waters despite extensive stocking of \"Mississippi strain\" Walleye. The study suggested that the Cannon River strain of Walleye in Lake Sarah is able to naturally reproduce, thereby creating a self-sustaining population. A population assessment was conducted the week of June 2, 2014 to monitor fish populations using four gill nets and 12 trap nets.  <br> \n <br> \nWALLEYE <br> \nWalleye catch rates in Lake Sarah have varied from 4.0 per gill net in 1984 to 77.5 per gill net in 1993. In 2014, Walleye were captured at a rate of 10.3 per gill net, which is significantly lower than the long term average of catch rates (32.4 per gill net) and the 2010 catch rate of 45.5 per gill net, but is within the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (3.2 to 15.3 per gill net). Despite the lower than average catch rate, the Walleye population produced a strong year class in 2014 as young-of-the-year Walleye were captured in the fall of 2014at a rate of 244.5 per hour of electrofishing, which is the fourth highest catch rate of YOY Walleye in Lake Sarah. Walleye lengths ranged from 14.9 to 27.8 inches and averaged 22.5 inches. Ninety percent of the Walleye sampled were larger than 20.0 inches in length. A balanced Walleye population will have a wide range of sizes present. Seven year classes of Walleye were sampled including 2011 (age-3), 2010 (age-4), 2009 (age-5), 2008 (age-6), 2005 (age-9), 2004 (age-10), and 2000 (age-14). Despite strong year classes being produced in 2012 (186.7 per hour) and 2013 (290.4 per hour), no age-1 (2013) or age-2 (2012) Walleye were sampled, raising concern that they did not recruit to the fishery; however, during electrofishing in the fall of 2014, several different sizes of adult Walleye were observed, suggesting that our nets may not have effectively sampled the whole Walleye population during this survey. Back calculated average length at age-3 was 16.7 inches, indicating fast growth when compared to growth in similar lakes. The strong 2014 year class should help Lake Sarah's Walleye population rebound within the next couple of years.  <br> \n <br> \nYELLOW PERCH <br> \nThe Yellow Perch catch rate declined from 22.5 per gill net in 2010 to 7.8 per gill net in 2014, but was within the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (3.0 to 22.5 per gill net). Yellow Perch have not been stocked in Lake Sarah, suggesting that the population sustains itself through natural reproduction. Despite being the second lowest catch rate since surveys began, Yellow Perch are abundant enough to reproduce, as 44 YOY Yellow Perch were sampled in a near shore survey conducted in early July 2014. Yellow Perch ranged in length from 6.5 to 8.3 inches and averaged 7.1 inches. Yellow Perch were skinny indicating that prey resources may not be readily available for Yellow Perch in Lake Sarah.  <br> \n <br> \nBLACK BULLHEAD <br> \nBlack Bullhead catch rates in 2014 were the highest ever observed in Lake Sarah for both gill nets (125.0 per gill net) and trap nets (140.9 per trap net). The gill net catch rate exceeded the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (4.6 to 83.0 per gill net) as did the trap net catch rate (1.3 to 78.1 per trap net). Gill netted Black Bullheads ranged in length from 6.4 to 15.2 inches in length and averaged 7.2 inches. Trap netted Black Bullheads ranged in length from 4.2 to 14.7 inches and averaged 7.9 inches. Ninety-eight percent of Black Bullheads sampled ranged from 6.0 to 9.0 inches long, suggesting that one strong year class accounts for most of the bullhead biomass in Lake Sarah. In the 2010 survey, the Black Bullhead population was at an all-time low (5.5 per gill net, 6.8 per trap net), and was dominated by one year class that were 11.0 to 13.5 inches in length. It appears that this year class (sampled in 2010) was able to reproduce and \"fill the void\" that is now being filled by the 6.0 to 9.0 inch bullheads sampled in 2014. Black Bullhead abundance could be an issue because they are reaching a length that may make them less vulnerable to predation by Walleye.  <br> \n <br> \nBLACK CRAPPIE <br> \nBlack Crappie catch rates in 2014 decreased from 2010 catch rates, going from 54.6 per trap net in 2010 to 0.9 per trap net in 2014. The 2014 catch rate of 0.9 per trap net is below the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (1.0 to 12.3 per trap net). Black Crappies ranged from 4.1 to 13.0 inches in length and averaged 11.0 inches. Black Crappies were very abundant in 2010, with the population consisting of three or four year classes. It is difficult to explain why they were not sampled in the 2014 survey other than the fish were not moving during the week of the survey or a sampling gear bias.  <br> \n <br> \nOTHER SPECIES <br> \nCommon Carp abundance has remained relatively unchanged since 1998, as catch rates have not exceeded 1.1 per trap net. The trend continued in 2014 with a catch rate of 1.6 per trap net which is within the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (0.7 to 5.1 per trap net).  <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled included Brown Bullhead, White Sucker, Yellow Bullhead, and White Crappie.    <br> \n <br> \nPlants in the water and at the water's edge provide habitat, prevent erosion, and absorb excess nutrients.  Shrubs, trees, and woody debris such as fallen trees or limbs provide good habitat both above and below the water and should be left in place.  By leaving a buffer strip of natural vegetation along the shoreline, property owners can reduce erosion, help maintain or improve water quality, and provide habitat and travel corridors for wildlife. <br> \n <br> \nBest management practices within the watershed (no-till farming, cover crops, buffer strips, targeted fertilizer application, reduced or metered tiling) would help reduce nutrients entering the lake. High nutrient and sediment input can cause algae blooms and reduce overall water quality. Any improvements in the watershed are likely to have positive impacts on the fishery. <br> \n <br> \nPrepared by Jonah Dagel <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Sarah is a 1,093-acre, class 41 lake, located approximately 4 miles south of the City of Garvin in Murray County. Lake Sarah has a maximum depth of 11.0 feet and a watershed to lake ratio of 10 to 1. Lake Sarah is managed primarily for walleye and secondarily for yellow perch.  Lake Sarah's walleye population is one of two walleye populations in the Windom fisheries management area that is sustained through natural reproduction alone, as it has not been stocked since 1991.  An egg take from Lake Sarah walleye was started in the spring of 2015.  As a result of that egg take and the precedent of returning a certain percentage of those fish back to the egg source, we have stocked approximately 100000 fry (100 fry/acre) in 2015 and 200000 fry (200 fry/acre) in 2016.  A recent genetics study found that Lake Sarah's walleye are unique to the Cannon River in east-central Minnesota, which was used as an egg source decades ago.  The study suggested that this \"Cannon River strain\" of Walleye has persisted in some southern waters despite extensive stocking of \"Mississippi strain\" walleye.  The study also suggested that the Cannon River strain of walleye in Lake Sarah is able to naturally reproduce, thereby creating a self-sustaining population.  Annual fall night electrofishing is done on the lake to monitor natural reproduction.  Below is a table with historical catch data.  The catch of Young-of-the-Year (YOY) walleye in 2016 was the greatest on record.  This comes after a low reproduction year in 2015.  Large year classes observed after low reproduction years can be very successful as those fish do not have to compete with 1 year olds from the previous year.  The 2016 year class could prove to be a very successful addition to the population.  Walleye reproduction will be monitored again in the fall of 2017 to assess natural reproduction.  <br> \n <br> \nHistoric catch rates for young-of-the-year (YOY) walleye during fall night electrofishing on Lake Sarah.  <br> \n <br> \nDate\tTotal N\tMean Length\tCatch Rate (n/hour) <br> \n9/27/2016\t253\t8.2\t337.3 <br> \n10/6/2015\t32\t9.0\t28.6 <br> \n10/15/2014\t350\t7.8\t244.2 <br> \n10/7/2013\t293\t8.1\t290.4 <br> \n10/11/2012\t193\t8.4\t186.7 <br> \n10/20/2011\t312\t8.2\t301.5 <br> \n9/21/2010\t162\t8.2\t149.5 <br> \n9/28/2006\t56\t9.5\t74.7 <br> \n10/10/2005\t145\t9.1\t96.7 <br> \n9/28/2004\t77\t7.7\t77 <br> \n10/8/2003\t12\t9.1\t16 <br> \n9/18/2001\t174\t7.2\t139.2 <br> \n9/24/2000\t90\t7.1\t60 <br> \n9/16/1999\t101\t6.9\t93.2 <br> \n9/24/1998\t105\t8.1\t105 <br> \n10/14/1997\t61\t7.1\t40.7 <br> \n9/29/1996\t183\t6.4\t183 <br> \n10/9/1995\t50\t7.6\t33.3 <br> \n10/13/1994\t296\t7.9\t197.3 <br> \n10/14/1993\t86\t7.5\t57.3 <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Sarah is a 1,093-acre lake, located approximately 4 miles south of the City of Garvin in Murray County. Lake Sarah has a maximum depth of 11.0 feet.  Lake Sarah is managed primarily for Walleye and secondarily for Yellow Perch.  Lake Sarah's Walleye population is one of the only Walleye populations in the Windom fisheries management area that is sustained through natural reproduction.  A genetics study found that Lake Sarah's Walleye are unique to the Cannon River in east-central Minnesota, which was used as an egg source decades ago.  The study suggested that this \"Lower Mississippi Strain\" of Walleye has persisted in some southern waters despite extensive stocking of \"Mississippi strain\" Walleye.  The study suggested that the Lower Mississippi strain of Walleye in Lake Sarah is able to naturally reproduce, thereby creating a self-sustaining population.  To perpetuate LMS Walleye, an egg take operation was started on Lake Sarah in 2015 and has been done annually, thus fry were stocked in 2015, 2016, and 2017 as put back stocking for the eggs that were taken.  Fry produced from this operation are stocked into area lakes in an effort to duplicate Lake Sarah's self-sustaining Walleye population.  A Standard Survey was conducted the week of June 11, 2018 to monitor fish populations using three gill nets and 12 trap nets. <br> \n <br> \nThe Walleye catch rates on Lake Sarah have varied from 4.0 per gill net in 1984 to 77.5 per gill net in 1993 and have averaged 31.1 per gill net since 1984.  In 2018, the Walleye catch rate was 21.0 per gill net, an increase from the 2014 catch rate of 10.8 per gill net, and exceeded the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (3.2 to 15.3 per gill net).  Walleye lengths ranged from 8.9 to 28.4 inches and averaged 14.9 inches.  Five year classes of Walleye were sampled including year classes from 2005, 2008, 2014, 2016, and 2017.  The 2016 year class comprised 70 percent of aged Walleye, with 62 percent of them being from natural reproduction.  Young-of-the-year Walleye were captured at a rate of 81.0 per hour in the fall of 2018, suggesting that natural reproduction occurred because put-back Walleye fry were not stocked in 2018.  Growth of Walleye is fast in Lake Sarah, as mean lengths at age 1, age-2, age-3, and age-4 were 9.7 inches, 13.2 inches, 16.4 inches, and 18.5 inches, respectively.  Walleye angling should be good on Lake Sarah for the foreseeable future.  <br> \n <br> \nThe Yellow Perch gill net catch rate of 49.3 in 2018 was the second highest ever recorded, exceeding the long term average of 32.9 per gill net and the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (3.0 to 22.5 per gill net).  Yellow Perch are an important prey fish in Lake Sarah, given the stable and abundant Walleye population that has existed over the years.  Lengths of Yellow Perch ranged from 5.1 to 11.4 inches and averaged 9.4 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie catch rates have been highly variable in Lake Sarah, ranging from 54.8 per trap net in 2010 to 0.4 per trap net in 2018.  Black Crappie populations tend to hinder Walleye populations, so the low abundance of Crappie in Lake Sarah should favor this unique Walleye population.  <br> \n <br> \nThe Black Bullhead catch rate declined from 125.0 per gill net in 2014 to 29.7 per gill net in 2018, below the long term average of 47.0 per gill net, and within the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (4.6 to 83.0 per gill net).  Black Bullhead were large with lengths ranging from 11.7 to 14.1 inches and averaging 12.8 inches.  Black Bullhead are also an important prey fish for the Walleye in Lake Sarah.  Other species sampled included White Sucker and Yellow Bullhead.  <br> \n</p>",
