                "narrative": "<p>Little Pelican is a 283 acre lake located at Breezy Point in Crow Wing County.  There is a public access located on the southeast side of the lake.  Development is moderate, with about sixteen homes/cabins per shoreline mile.  The lake has a maximum depth of 34 feet and about 73% of the surface area is less than 15 feet deep.  Little Pelican has moderately hard water and the phosphorus fertility is in the \"low\" range.  Water clarity was 18 feet in 1998, considered good for this area.  Soils in water less than four feet deep are primarily sand, with gravel, rubble sized rock (3-10\") and muck also present.The aquatic plant community is fairly diverse and plants grew to a depth of 18 feet in 1998.  Healthy aquatic plant communities are important.  Emergent species such as bulrush and cattail help regulate nutrient levels and often provide quality spawning habitat for northern pike, bass and panfish species.  Submergent plant species provide food sources and cover for a wide variety of aquatic species.Test netting was conducted in 1998.  Catches were \"average\" for most species when compared to similar type lakes.  Previous nettings were done in 1968, 1980 and 1986.  Northern pike is the primary gamefish present.  The catch rate in 1998 was lower than in previous nettings but was \"average\" when compared to similar type lakes.  Most pike were from the 1994-'96 year classes and growth was good.  Pike size averaged 20 inches and 1.8 lbs..  Two walleyes were caught, both 21 inches long.  In spite of this low catch, it was in the \"average\" category for both Little Pelican and for similar type lakes.  Largemouth bass were also taken in \"average\" numbers.  Three age classes were sampled and growth was good.  Bluegill was the most abundant panfish sampled.  The '98 catch was lower than in past nettings but was \"average\" for similar type lakes.  Bluegills caught in trapnets ranged from 3.6-7.8 inches long and about 15% were at least 7.0 inches long.  The 1992 year class was the strongest of the five sampled and growth was good.  Black crappie  were also caught in \"average\" numbers when compared to past nettings and to similar type lakes and had growth that bordered on slow.  The strongest year classes sampled were from 1994 and 1996.  Yellow perch is an important food source for the lake's gamefish.  The '98 catch was 4.3/gill net, typical for the lake and for similar type lakes.  A number of age classes were sampled and growth was good.  Other species sampled in '98 included bowfin (dogfish), yellow bullhead, brown bullhead, black bullhead, pumpkinseed, rock bass and hybrid sunfish.</p>",

Bowfin, yellow bullhead and pumpkinseed indicated high populations since catch rates were above the third quartile. Northern pike and bluegill indicate a very high population compared to the 3rd quartile of the range of the median for northern pike and for bluegills. Three gillnets were set in July of 1980 and July 1986. Based on catches from these nets the northern pike and walleye populations have stayed the same while the yellow perch populations have increased. Northern pike aged showed age classes 1-6, with half of the fish being in the age class 2. Age class 1 showed above average growth rates while 2, 3 and 4 showed below average growth. The mean weight has decreased from 1.9 lbs. in 1980 to 1.5 lbs. in 1986. The range in length in 1980 was from 9 inches to 32.9 inches, and in 1986 was from 12 to 31.9 inches. The median length group in each year was 18.0 to 18.9 inches. The yellow perch population has increased from in 1980 to in 1986. Range in length in 1980 was from 6 to 7.4 inches while in 1986 a much wider range was found. No aging of the scales was done. The walleye population has remained the same with 1.3/gillnet in 1980 to (1/gillnet) in 1980. Length-frequency ranged from 21\" to 23.9\" in 1980, to 20\" to 22.9\" in 1986. Largemouth bass were present with the year class 2 making up 4 out of 5 fish that were taken. Lengths ranged from 7' to 16.9'. Black crappies aged (10 of 10 fish) showed age classes of 3, 4 and 5 year classes present. The year class 5 contributed 10 of 19 fish aged. Lengths ranged from 3.5 to 6.9 with 98% between 5 and 6.5. Yellow bullheads were present in sized ranged from 5.5 to 12.9 with 79% between 7.5 and 10. Pumpkinseeds and rock bass were present in various sizes ranging from 3.5 to 7 and 7 to 9 respectively. Hybrid sunfish were present in sized ranging from 6 to 7.9.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Little Pelican Lake is a 283 acre lake located a mile south of Breezy Point in Crow Wing County.  There is a public access located in the southeast portion of the lake.  The maximum depth is 34 feet with about 73% of the lake being 15 feet deep or less.  A variety of sand, gravel, and muck substrates occur in shallow water which helps support a diverse aquatic plant community.  Maintaining the lakes aquatic plant composition and abundance has been identified in the management plan as an important long range goal.  Aquatic plants help prevent erosion, stabilize bottom sediments, provide spawning habitat, and provide food and shelter for a variety of aquatic organisms.  <br> \n <br> \nAn assessment of the fish population was conducted in 2010 and compared to previous surveys conducted in 1968, 1980, 1986, and 1998.  Northern pike are the lakes primary management species and were captured at a rate of 20.7 per gillnet in 2010.  This was the highest catch to date, and exceeded the long-range goal for this lake.  The size of these fish averaged 17.5\" and 1.56 pounds, but fell below the goal of 2.0 pounds.  Only 14% of these fish were over 24\".  This is consistent with previous surveys, suggesting the northern pike population has been stable with large numbers of small fish for many years.   <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass, the lakes secondary management species, were sampled at a rate of 1.6 per trap net in 2010.  This catch exceeds typical values for similar lakes, but is within the range of values from previous surveys of this lake.  The size of bass captured in all sampling methods ranged from 8.4 to 20.5 inches.  Several year classes were sampled, and growth was average. <br> \n <br> \nImportant panfish species in the lake include black crappie and bluegill.  The crappie catch in 2010 was within the typical range for this type of lake and comparable to previous catches on this lake.  Several year classes were sampled, and growth was average.  The 2010 bluegill catch of 12.9 per trap net decreased from previous surveys.  In spite of slow growth, 53% of these fish measured at least 7\" though no fish over 8\" were sampled. <br> \n <br> \nAdditional sampling for nearshore fish was also conducted using shoreline seining and backpack electrofishing.  Several species of shiners, a few darter species, and other forage species were sampled.  A total of 24 fish species were collected in all sampling methods combined during the 2010 survey. <br> \n</p>",
