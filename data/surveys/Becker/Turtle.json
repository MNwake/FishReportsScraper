                "narrative": "<p>Turtle Lake is a small (147 acres), deep (73 feet), heavily developed lake located on the boundary between Becker County and Clay County.  The lake has been primarily regarded as a bass and panfish lake, although northern pike and walleyes are also present.  Along with fluctuating water levels, the fish community in this groundwater influenced lake has been impacted by fishing pressure, fish stocking, water chemistry, and fish habitat changes.Northern pike were stocked often in the 1960's and 1970's.  None have been stocked here since 1989.  The population sustains itself through natural reproduction in the spawning area just north of the lake. Pike over 30 inches long were found but were rare and the average length of sampled northern pike was just over 22 inches.Walleye spawning habitat is lacking in Turtle Lake but fingerling stocking has helped to sustain a fishable population.  Only walleyes have been stocked during the past decade.  The lake was identified as one that might benefit from the Accelerated Walleye Stocking Plan.  The walleye stocking rate was doubled to two pounds of fingerlings per littoral acre in 1999.  Not only were there excellent net catches of yellow perch (the preferred forage of walleyes), but also northern pike (a competitor and predator of walleye) catches were lower than during the 1990's.  In 2001, sampled walleyes averaged a relatively large 18.6 inches in length and 2.4 pounds in weight.Abundant, slow growing bluegills have been reported as part of Turtle Lake's fish community since the initial fisheries survey in 1947.  In 2001, average length of the bluegills sampled in trap nets was 6.7 inches.  While a few fish over eight inches were found, none of the sampled bluegills was over nine inches in length.Black crappies were rare.  In fact, crappies have been found in significant numbers in Turtle Lake during only two surveys-the 1975 and the 1982.  Crappies are known to benefit from more turbid water conditions than most other gamefish and panfish species.  Interestingly, water clarities were significantly lower in Turtle Lake during the 1970's and early 1980's than in more recent years.  Algal blooms were reportedly more common then than now, as well.Fish populations in any lake are reflections of their habitat and watershed.  Turtle Lake and its surrounding watershed are heavily developed and the lake is vulnerable to cultural eutrophication (aging).  Unchecked development of this watershed could tip the balance toward smelly algal blooms and a fish community dominated by bullheads.  Lakeshore owners have not only battled AGAINST high water levels, but also FOR good water quality.  Landowners are encouraged to apply \"best management practices\" in order to maintain property values, water quality, and fish populations.  Excellent sources for shoreline landscaping are available in the DNR document \"Lakescaping for Wildlife and Water Quality\" and in the \"Restore Your Shore\" computer disk available at the Minnesota Bookstore.Turtle Lake's diverse fish community continues to reflect relatively good water quality.  There are very few black bullheads, a species that is favored by turbid water.  Water quality is such that, even in the lower, cooler levels of the thermocline, dissolved oxygen levels are high enough to sustain cold water fish species.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Turtle Lake is a small (187 acres), deep (73 feet), heavily-developed lake located on the boundary between Becker County and Clay County.  The lake has been primarily regarded as a bass and panfish lake, although Northern Pike and Walleyes are also present.  Along with fluctuating water levels, the fish community in this groundwater influenced lake has been impacted by fishing pressure, fish stocking, water chemistry, and fish habitat changes. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike were stocked often in the 1960's and 1970's.  None have been stocked here since 1989.  The population sustains itself through natural reproduction in the spawning area just north of the lake. Pike over 30.0 inches long were not found in 2014 and the average length of sampled Northern Pike was just under 19.0 inches. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye spawning habitat is lacking in Turtle Lake but fingerling stocking has helped to sustain a fishable population.  Only Walleyes have been stocked during the past two decades.  The lake was identified 15 years ago as one that might benefit from increased stocking.  The Walleye stocking rate was doubled to two pounds of fingerlings per littoral acre, biennially, in 1999.  Increased Walleye stocking has not resulted in increased catch rates.  In fact, the 2014 Walleye catch rate was the second lowest in history.  The potential cause is predation due to the dramatic increase in pike numbers.  Pike catches increased to a historic high in 2014 and Yellow Perch and Walleye populations have been detrimentally impacted.  In 2014, sampled Walleyes averaged a relatively large 19.3 inches in length and 2.7 pounds in weight. <br> \n <br> \nAbundant, slow-growing Bluegills have been reported as part of Turtle Lake's fish community since the initial fisheries survey in 1947.  In 2014, the average length of Bluegills sampled in trap nets was 6.9 inches.  Several fish over eight inches were found and growth rates were only slightly slower than normal compared to statewide age and growth indices. <br> \n <br> \nDespite permitted, private stocking of 3,000 Black Crappie yearlings in 2013, no crappies were caught in test nets.  However, several were caught while electrofishing in May, 2014.  They averaged 9.3 inches in length and none were younger than age four.  Previously, crappies were found in large numbers in Turtle Lake during only two surveys-the 1975 and the 1982.  Crappies are known to benefit from more turbid water conditions than most other gamefish and panfish species.  Interestingly, water clarities were significantly lower in Turtle Lake during the 1970's and early 1980's than in more recent years.  Algal blooms were reportedly more common then as well. <br> \n <br> \nFish populations in any lake are reflections of their habitat and watershed.  Turtle Lake's diverse fish community continues to reflect relatively good water quality.  There are very few Black Bullheads, a species that is favored by turbid water.  Turtle Lake and its surrounding watershed are heavily developed and the lake is vulnerable to cultural eutrophication (aging).  Unchecked development of this watershed could tip the balance toward smelly algal blooms and a fish community dominated by bullheads.  Lakeshore owners have not only battled against high water levels, but also for good water quality.  Landowners are encouraged to apply \"best management practices\" in order to maintain property values, water quality, and fish populations.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of nearshore fish species in Turtle Lake was conducted on August 2, 2017 by Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program Staff.  Ten sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot seine.  Nearshore sampling captured 14 species of fish including five species that are intolerant of disturbance (Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, and Rock Bass) and one that is tolerant of disturbance (Green Sunfish). <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore data were combined with trap net and gill net data from a June 2014 survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based IBI (FIBI) score.  The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment.  In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g. Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, and Rock Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g. Black Bullhead, Common Carp, and Green Sunfish).  The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake.  For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.   <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey indicates Turtle Lake is in exceptional health as indicated by an FIBI score well above the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes.  Data from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Buffalo River Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Turtle Lake is a 196-acre lake located in western Becker County.  The lake possesses a heavily developed shoreline and receives significant recreational use and angling pressure.  Lake survey assessments are completed periodically on Turtle Lake to highlight and track changes in species presence and abundance over time. <br> \n  <br> \nWalleye are stocked biennially in Turtle Lake.  Walleye catch rates have been variable in this lake since initial surveying in 1964.  The 2020 mean catch rate was one Walleye per net, similar to what was observed in 2014.  Sampled Walleye ranged in length from 17.8 to 24.9 inches, averaging 20.6 inches.  Size distribution of sampled Walleye indicate a population dominated by large, older fish. <br> \n <br> \nGill net catch rates of Northern Pike have increased in Turtle Lake over the last several decades, likely as a result of several high water years leading to improved pike spawning habitat.  On average, about 14 pike were caught per net in the 2020 survey.  Sampled pike ranged in length from 10.4 to 30.9 inches, averaging 18.1 inches long. <br> \n <br> \nThe average catch rate of Yellow Perch has fallen below three perch per gill net in the last three surveys, a large decline since the 2001 survey.  No Yellow Perch were sampled in the 2020 survey, indicative of very low perch abundance in recent years.  <br> \n <br> \nIn the 2020 survey Bluegill were found to be in low abundance. Bluegill ranged in length from 2.8 to 9.4 inches, with a mean length of 6.7 inches.  An average eight inch Bluegill was found to be 7 to 8 years old. <br> \n   \t <br> \nBlack Crappie ranged in length from 4.8 to 11.3 inches, while Largemouth Bass caught during the survey ranged in length from 5.7 to 17.6 inches. <br> \n  <br> \nAdditional species sampled in 2020 included Bullhead, hybrid sunfish, Pumpkinseed, Rock Bass, and White Sucker.  Bullhead and Rock Bass were caught in modest numbers.  Hybrid sunfish were found to range in length from 3.8 to 9.5 inches and averaged 8.3 inches long. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers can help to maintain Turtle Lake's valuable fishery by voluntarily releasing a portion of medium-large size fish and harvesting smaller fish for eating, specifically Northern Pike and Bluegill.  Shoreline owners can help to maintain or improve water quality and fish habitat by leaving shoreline buffer zones, by leaving stands of native aquatic vegetation intact, by taking precautions to prevent invasive species introductions, and by using wise land management practices. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Turtle Lake is a small (147 acres), deep (73 feet), heavily-developed lake located on the boundary between Becker County and Clay County.  The lake has been primarily regarded as a bass and panfish lake, although northern pike and walleyes are also present.  Along with fluctuating water levels, the fish community in this groundwater influenced lake has been impacted by fishing pressure, fish stocking, water chemistry, and fish habitat changes. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike were stocked often in the 1960's and 1970's.  None have been stocked here since 1989.  The population sustains itself through natural reproduction in the spawning area just north of the lake. Pike over 30.0 inches long were found but were rare and the average length of sampled northern pike was just under 20.0 inches. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye spawning habitat is lacking in Turtle Lake but fingerling stocking has helped to sustain a fishable population.  Only walleyes have been stocked during the past decade.  The lake was identified nine years ago as one that might benefit from increased stocking.  The walleye stocking rate was doubled to two pounds of fingerlings per littoral acre, biennially, in 1999.  Increased walleye stocking has not resulted in increased catch rates.  In fact, the 2008 walleye catch rate was the second lowest in history.  The most obvious cause is predation due to the dramatic increase in pike numbers.  Pike catches increased to a historic high in 2008 and yellow perch and walleye populations have apparently been detrimentally impacted.  In 2008, sampled walleyes averaged a relatively large 21.1 inches in length and 3.2 pounds in weight. <br> \n <br> \nAbundant, slow-growing bluegills have been reported as part of Turtle Lake's fish community since the initial fisheries survey in 1947.  In 2008, the average length of bluegills sampled in trap nets was 6.5 inches.  Several fish over eight inches were found and growth rates were only slightly slower than normal compared to statewide age and growth indices. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie catch rates increased to 1.3 per trap net.  This was the highest crappie catch rate since 1982.  In fact, crappies have been found in significant numbers in Turtle Lake during only two surveys (the 1975 and the 1982).  Crappies are known to benefit from more turbid water conditions than most other gamefish and panfish species.  Interestingly, water clarities were significantly lower in Turtle Lake during the 1970's and early 1980's than in more recent years.  Algal blooms were reportedly more common then as well. <br> \n <br> \nFish populations in any lake are reflections of their habitat and watershed.  Turtle Lake and its surrounding watershed are heavily developed and the lake is vulnerable to cultural eutrophication (aging).  Unchecked development of this watershed could tip the balance toward smelly algal blooms and a fish community dominated by bullheads.  Lakeshore owners have not only battled AGAINST high water levels, but also FOR good water quality.  Landowners are encouraged to apply \"best management practices\" in order to maintain property values, water quality, and fish populations.  Excellent sources for shoreline landscaping are available in the DNR document \"Lakescaping for Wildlife and Water Quality\" and in the \"Restore Your Shore\" computer disk available at the Minnesota Bookstore. <br> \n <br> \nTurtle Lake's diverse fish community continues to reflect relatively good water quality.  There are very few black bullheads, a species that is favored by turbid water.  Water quality is such that, even in the lower, cooler water of the thermocline, dissolved oxygen levels are high enough to sustain cold water fish species. <br> \n</p>",

Fishing pressure has undoubtedly increased as well.  The lake's small     size and heavy development would appear to make it's fish populations vulnerable to over exploitation.      Increased fishing pressure is only one of many factors affecting the fish community in Turtle Lake.  (1)     Weather patterns and water levels affect spawning success for most species.  Northern pike, for instance, have     maintained their numbers without stocking in recent years because water levels have been high enough in the spring     to allow migration into the pike spawning area off the north shore.  (2) Vegetation removal can disrupt spawning,     feeding, and shelter use for several fish species.  In 1947, bulrushes were listed as common along one shore.      Shoreline development led to destruction of bulrush beds and only one significant stand remains.  (3) Fish     stocking can impact (sometimes negatively) the entire fish community in a lake, not just the species being     stocked.  Black bullhead, white sucker, rock bass, walleye, and northern pike were not present in the initial lake     survey in 1947.  Although walleye and northern pike were introduced by the DNR, the other species were not.  (4)     Shoreline erosion, nutrient loading, and hazardous chemical introductions can all detrimentally impact fish     habitat, spawning success, and fish abundance.  In spite of all the impacts on a fishery, exploited fish     populations attempt to maintain themselves through reproduction.  Thus, the dominance of small individuals of a     particular fish species is often a good indicator of over harvest.      The maximum size of northern pike and the average size of bluegill are decreasing in Turtle Lake.  Since     growth rates have not changed significantly in the recent past, it is likely that pike and bluegill are being     \"cropped off\" about the time they become large enough to keep.  Due to a lack of favorable spawning habitat, the     walleye population in Turtle Lake is maintained by stocking.  The average walleye sampled in the 1994 assessment     was relatively large at 2.5 pounds and 18.7 inches long.      In general, abundances of Turtle Lake's northern pike, yellow perch, bluegill, walleye and largemouth bass     populations are above the \"normal\" ranges for similar species in similar lakes.  Rock bass, first sampled in test     nets in 1982, have become very abundant, as are hybrid sunfish.  Black crappie numbers have crashed and none have     been caught in either of the last two surveys.  Reasons for the decline are unclear and may include any or all     of the following: walleye and northern pike stocking, increased angling pressure, rock bass introduction, loss     of spawning and cover habitat (bulrushes) due to heavy shoreline development, or even increased water clarity,     since black crappie are generally favored by more turbid water conditions.  Other fish species sampled in 1994     included black and brown bullhead (a few of each), green sunfish, pumpkinseed sunfish, and white sucker.      Natural fluctuations in Turtle Lake's fish populations are inevitable.  However, there are several things     that watershed dwellers and lake users can do to help maintain a viable fishery.  Fish habitat is more than just     water.  It includes both quantity  and quality of water, types of bottom substrates, and fish cover (especially     vegetation).  One can help to sustain the integrity of the lake and it's fish populations by protecting bullrush     and cattail stands, preventing erosion, preventing nutrient loading from lawn fertilization and faulty septic     systems, self regulation of fish harvest by catching and properly releasing a portion of the \"keepers\" one might     normally kill and eat.      It appears that lakeshore owners have already begun to take many preventative measures at Turtle Lake.  The     Citizen Lake Monitoring Program, administered by MN PCA, has documented a significant increase in water clarity     over the past decade.  Their studies show, however, that water clarity is higher than expected based upon     phosphorus concentrations in the lake, which means that the potential remains for more turbid conditions in Turtle     Lake.  It may be that the current biological makeup of the lake (zooplankton, in particular) is keeping algal     abundance down and water transparency up.</p>",

THE SPAWNING AREA HAS NOT BEEN OPERATED BY DNR FOR SEVERAL YEARS BUT IS STILL CAPABLE OF USE BY SPAWNING WHEN STOPLOGS ARE NOT IN PLACE-AS IS PRESENTLY THE CASE.  THE AVERAGE WEIGHT OF PIKE SAMPLED WAS 1.3 LBS.  WITH A RELATIVELY LARGE RANGE OF SIZES PRESENT.  GROWTH RATES APPEAR TO BE AVERAGE FOR FISH YOUNGER THAN AGE FIVE; THERE ARE INSUFFICIENT DATA TO MAKE MEANINGFUL CONCLUSIONS ABOUT OLDER NOP.  WAE NUMBERS ALSO APPEAR TO BE HIGH FOR LAKES OF THIS ECOLOGICAL CLASSIFICATION WITH ALL BUT ONE OF THE FISH SAMPLED REPRESENTING COHORTS FROM YEARS OF FINGERLING STOCKING.  THE BULK OF THE NET CATCH WAS MADE UP OF 3/4 LB., 12-13 INCH, AGE GROUP II+ WAE.  INDIVIDUAL GROWTH RATES SEEM TO SLOW FOR FISH OLDER THAN TWO YEARS BUT, SINCE ONLY FIVE OLDER WAES WERE SAMPLED AND STUDIED, ONE SHOULD VIEW THIS PERCEPTION CAUTIOUSLY.  IT IS INTERESTING TO NOTE THAT NEITHER NOP NOR WAE WERE CAUGHT IN TEST NETS SET DURING 1947-THE YEAR OF THE FIRST DOCUMENTED SAMPLING OF FISH POPULATIONS IN TURTLE LAKE.  YEP NUMBERS REMAIN RELATIVELY HIGH AT 38.75 PER GILLNET SET BUT MAY BE DECLINING SLIGHTLY.  THE MEAN SIZE OF PERCH SAMPLED, NEARLY 1/3 LB, IS CONSIDERABLY LARGER THAN IN LAKES OF EITHER SIMILAR ECOLOGICAL TYPE OR GEOGRAPHICAL AREA.  COMMON CEN, INCLUDING LMB, BLG, RKB AND HSF ARE GENERALLY MORE ABUNDANT IN TURTLE LAKE THAN IN OTHER CLASS #23 LAKES.  EVEN WITH LARGE NUMBERS OF SMALL BLGS PRESENT, INDIVIDUAL GROWTH REMAINS GOOD AND TRAPNETS CONTAINED MANY SEVEN TO NINE INCH FISH.  NO BLCS WERE TAKEN DURING THIS SURVEY AND HISTORICAL NETTING SEEMS TO INDICATE A DECLINING POPULATION SINCE A PEAK IN 1975.</p>",
