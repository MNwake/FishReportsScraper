The maximum depth is 30 feet and 61 percent of the lake is less than 15 feet deep.  Previous fish assessments were conducted in 1973 and 1988.     The fish community in Bergen Lake is comprised of northern pike, black crappie, bluegill, yellow perch, and white sucker.  Bergen Lake has a healthy northern pike population with above average catch and growth rates.  The average size sampled was 21.0 inches.  Black crappies were the most abundant panfish species sampled in the standard sampling gear.  Catch rates were above average, and higher than in previous assessments.  Growth rates were typical for Duluth area lakes.  Bluegill and yellow perch had average catch rates and growth rates.  White sucker catch rates were above average for lakes in this lake class and have remained stable from previous surveys.     Young-of-the-year largemouth bass, yellow perch, and black crappie were collected in the one-quarter inch trapnets.  All 11 of the largemouth bass, 47 of the 53 yellow perch, and 6 of the 17 black crappie collected were from the 1998 year class.  Juvenile bluegill were the most abundant species collected in the one-quarter inch trapnets with 62 individuals collected.     </p>",
