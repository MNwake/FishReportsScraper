The yellow bullhead, green sunfish, pumpkinseed and hybrid sunfish all had slightly high figures.  The yellow perch, golden shiner, carp and brown bullhead were slightly low.  The black crappie was high and the bluegill very low.  The rock bass was absent in the trapnet result while the walleye and largemouth bass were not taken in this survey's netting.</p>",

The northern pike was very high in both numbers and pounds per set at 12.00 and 44.40 respectively.  Average weight was 3.70 pounds.  The walleye as has been its history in Florence Lake was very low at 0.33 per set.  The yellow perch was also very low at 0.67 per set but fair to good numbers have been taken in the 1976 and 1982 shoreline seining results.  The bluegill, pumpkinseed, and green sunfish all had very high population figures but are of a small average size.  The black crappie was low in the trapnet at 1.50 per set but was well represented in the gillnet at 15.33 per set.  The yellow, brown, and black bullheads all had low trapnet figures but the black bullhead was extremely high at 192.33 per set in the gillnet.  The white sucker and bowfin had slightly low and high population figures respectively.  The golden shiner was taken only in the trapnet at 5.50 per set.  The carp and largemouth bass results indicate low population status.</p>",

Although the catch rate was lower in 1986 than the 12.0 per set in 1982, there was not a real decrease in the general northern pike population.  Of the 23 northern pike aged, 18 were 3 year old fish.  Growth rates were average at all annulus.  The yellow perch at 16.0 per set was lower than the local median of 24.27, but has shown a real increase over the 1982 netting figure of 0.67 per set.  Median length for the yellow perch was 6.0 to 6.4 inches.  The bluegill sunfish showed a low population at 2.33 per trap net set and a sharp decline from a high of 69.0 per set in 1982.  Median length for the bluegill was 5.5 to 5.9 inches. The pumpkinseed was slightly low at 3.0 per set with a median length of 5.0 to 5.4 inches.  The green sunfish was very high at 5.33 per set and of very small size with a median length of 3.5 to 3.9 inches. The black crappie was present only in the gillnet catch in extremely low numbers, 0.33 per set and natural reproduction was absent in the shoreline seining.  The hybrid sunfish was very high at 10.33 per set with a median length of 5.0 to 5.4 inches.  The yellow bullhead, golden shiner and carp appeared to have low populations.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>  As noted earlier in the survey, Florence Lake experiences partial winter kills from time to time.  Following such events, the fish populations have responded sporadically.  When comparing fish populations to previous survey catches, it should be taken into consideration the response of fish populations to the low winter dissolved oxygen levels in the lake.  The difficulty in all of this is that fish migration (upstream and downstream) plays an important role to the fish population in Florence Lake.  The last lake survey on Florence Lake happened to fall on the same year a partial winterkill occurred (1986).  Since 1986, winter dissolved oxygen records have not indicated serious winterkill problems, even during the late 1980's drought period when the lake level was very low.  \n  In June, 1991, population assessment was conducted on Florence Lake.  To determine the status of the fish populations, three gillnets and four trapnets were set and three shoreline stations were seined.  Based on the results of these efforts the status of the fish populations compared to lakes of the same lake classification statewide are described.  \n  The northern pike net catch (8.33/ set) was slightly above the previous survey catch (7.67/set).  This was higher than the statewide median catch (6.58/set) and falls within the first and third quartiles, 2.92/set and 13.25/set, respectively.  The northern pike captured ranged from 14.0 to 35.9 inches with a median length group of 19.0- 19.9 inches.  The mean weight was 2.05 pounds which is slightly below the statewide median weight for northern pike of this lake type (2.20 pounds).  Age analysis determined that captured fish were from one to seven years old.  Average back- calculated lengths for each age class were typical of normal growth rates throughout the state.  Seine hauls captured 3 young-of-year northern pike.  \n  The walleye net catch (1.00/set) was the highest catch ever recorded dating back to the initial survey in 1955.  Until 1991, only one walleye was captured by gillnetting (1982) from all of the surveys.  This 1991 catch was below the first quartile (1.25/ set).  The three fish captured ranged from 18.0 to 21.9 inches.  The mean weight was 3.33 pounds which is higher than the statewide median weight for walleyes of this lake type (2.17 pounds).  Age analysis determined the fish to be three and five years old.  Average back-calculated lengths for each age class showed growth rates faster than normal growth rates throughout the state.  As mentioned earlier, their presence is most likely due to migration.\n  The bluegill net catch (78.25/set) was the highest ever recorded dating back to the 1955 survey.  This catch was above the third quartile (57.25/set).  The bluegills ranged from 3.0 to 8.9 inches with a median length group of 5.0-5.4 inches.  The mean weight was 0.15 pounds which is below the statewide median weight for bluegills of this lake type (0.20 pounds).  Age analysis determined that captured fish were from one to six years old.  Average back-calculated lengths for each age class were slightly higher than typical of bluegills throughout the state, indicating slightly above average growth.  Seine hauls captured 498 young-of-year bluegills.\n  The largemouth bass net catch (0.50/set) was first time bass were recorded by survey trapnetting dating back to 1955.  This catch fell within the first and third quartile range, 0.20/set and 0.71/set, respectively.  Seine hauls captured 3 young-of-year largemouth bass.\n  The black crappie net catch (4.00/set) was below the statewide median catch (6.31/set) but falls within the first and third quartile range, 2.25/set and 30.08/set, respectively.  The black crappies captured ranged from 4.0 to 9.9 inches with a median length group of 4.5 to 4.9 inches.  The mean weight was 0.15 pounds which is below the first quartile for black crappies of this lake type (0.17 pounds).  Age analysis determined that captured fish were one and three years old.  Average back-calculated lengths for age class I indicated growth faster than normal and age class III was normal growth.\n  The yellow perch net catch (6.00/set) was below the statewide median catch (12.50/set) but falls within the first and third quartile range, 2.25/set and 40.00/set, respectively.  The yellow perch captured ranged from 5.0 to 6.9 inches with a median length group of 5.5-5.9 inches.\n  Eight other species were captured during the survey (bowfin, golden shiner, black bullhead, yellow bullhead, brown bullhead, hybrid sunfish, green sunfish, and pumpkinseed).  Golden shiner and yellow bullhead catches were below their first quartiles.  Bowfin, black bullhead, brown bullhead, and green sunfish all fell within their respective first and third quartile ranges.  The hybrid sunfish net catch was 5.00/set.  The pumpkinseed net catch (16.25/set) was above the third quartile (8.75/set).  The pumpkinseeds captured ranged from 3.0 to 6.9 inches with a median length group of 4.5-4.9 inches.  The mean weight was 0.12 pounds which is similar to the statewide median weight for pumpkinseeds of this lake type (0.13 pounds).\n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Florence is a semi-fertile 141 acre lake located in eastern Isanti County.  A state owned access is located on the northwest corner of the lake.  The maximum depth is 26 feet but 90 percent of the lake is less than 15 feet deep.  Vegetation can become dense in the shallower areas of the lake and likely facilitates the occasional winterkills that occur on the lake.  Differing levels of winterkill severity have affected and will continue to affect the fish community in Florence Lake.  Following winterkill, gamefish populations are reestablished by stocking as part of the lake management plan and by immigration from nearby water bodies. The most recent winterkill event occurred in early 2011.  While it was not a complete kill, fish species less tolerant of low oxygen levels such as Largemouth Bass, Bluegill, and Walleye were likely the most affected.  The lake is primarily managed for Northern Pike and secondarily for Bluegill, Black Crappie, and Largemouth Bass. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike catch rates were above average and sizes were below average when compared to similar lakes. Captured Northern Pike ranged from 13.6 to 33.0 inches.  Walleye are present in Florence Lake, but catch rates are below average when compared to similar lakes.  Walleyes present during the survey were a result of fry stocking in the spring of 2011.  With no natural reproduction, future Walleye abundance is dependent on the success of Walleye stockings.  Spring electrofishing found high numbers of Largemouth Bass. The 47 Largemouth Bass collected averaged 9.8 inches and 0.66 pounds with lengths ranging from 6.3 to 17.7 inches.  Most of the Bass collected in the survey were the result of spawning events that took place after the winterkill in 2011.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie catch rates in Florence Lake were low when compared to similar lakes.  The largest Black Crappie collected was 9.4 inches and the average length was 7.0 inches.  Bluegill catch rates were very high when compared to similar lakes and the catch consisted of many quality sized fish that should provide a great fishing opportunity.  The largest Bluegill collected in the survey was 8.0 inches and over half of the Bluegills observed were greater than 7 inches.  Yellow Perch abundance was low and Black Bullhead abundance was slightly above average when compared to similar lakes.  The short term reduction in fish abundance as a result of the winterkill has meant faster growth rates for the surviving fish and their newly hatched offspring.  Strong recruitment and fast growth following that winterkill event have resulted in an abundant population of catchable sized game fishes. Florence Lake will likely continue to be affected by winterkills of varying magnitude which could limit fishing potential in the future.   <br> \n</p>",
