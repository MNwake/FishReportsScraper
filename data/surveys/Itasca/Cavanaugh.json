                "narrative": "<p>Cavanaugh Lake is a small, 67 acre bass-panfish lake located about 4 miles southwest of Grand Rapids, MN.  The area was impacted by mining activity in the 1950-1960's.  The north shore of the lake was altered with rock from mining operations as was the inlet from Little Cavanaugh.  This assessment was conducted to determine the current status of the fishery and what if anything could be done to restore the inlet from Little Cavanaugh at the request of a private landowner.     Northern pike were sampled in good numbers at 8.0/gill net.  Although the average length of those sampled was only 20.9 inches, some nice pike were captured.  The largest was 34.8 inches.     Black crappie are often difficult to sample during summer assessments since they suspend over deep water.  This was the case in this assessment since most were sampled in the gill net.  Most of the crappies sampled were less than 8 inches.     Bluegill were also sampled in good numbers in the gill nets.  The bluegill sampled indicate a population of poor quality and poor growth.  All were under 8 inches.     More largemouth bass were sampled in Cavanaugh Lake than in other lakes that are similiar.  They varied in length from 6.8-19.6 inches. Growth rates were good.        An important forage species, yellow perch, was sampled in low numbers at 3.0/gill net.  Brown bullhead and pumpkinseed sunfish were also sampled.  </p>",
