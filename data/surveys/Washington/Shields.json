There is no formal boat launch but anglers are able to portage canoes and small boats from the parking area down the hill to the lake. A fishing pier provides shore fishing access. A winter aeration system has been in place since 1995. Bluegills are the most abundant species in the lake and were sampled at high levels for Shields Lake during this survey, with 93% of the Bluegills sampled exceeding 6 inches. Black Crappies are less abundant and are average size. Only 2% exceeded 10 inches. Northern Pike were found in average numbers and above average size. One 12 inch Largemouth Bass that weighed .94lbs was observed during the survey. Other species sampled include Bowfin (dogfish), Black Bullhead and Pumpkinseed Sunfish.  </p>",

There is no formal boat launch but anglers are able to portage canoes and small boats from the parking area down the hill to the lake. A fishing pier provides shore fishing access. A winter aeration system has been in place since 1995. The 2021 spring trap netting survey was conducted to provide baseline information on Bluegill for the new 5-fish bag limit experimental fishing regulation that went into effect in 2021. The goal of this regulation on Shields Lake is to increase the size structure of Bluegill.  <br> \nNine trap nets were set on April 27, 2021 and lifted on April 28, 2021 catching a total of 230 Bluegill. Bluegill ranged in size from 3.4 inches up to 8.5 inches in length, with an average size of 6.6 inches. Aging structures (otoliths) were collected from 89 Bluegill. Large numbers of fish were found from 2018 (3 years old), 2016 (5 years old) and 2015 (6 years old). The oldest Bluegill sampled in 2021 was determined to be from the 2013 year-class (8 years old). The size structure of Bluegill found in Shields Lake is better than average for East Metro-area lakes. 50% of the Bluegill sampled in this survey were greater than 7 inches long. <br> \n</p>",

There is no formal boat launch but anglers are able to portage canoes and small boats from the parking area down the hill to the lake. The outlet of Shields Lake flows north under TH97 and enters lake 2 of Forest Lake. A water quality report in 1990 indicated that a high percentage of the nutrients entering Forest Lake were coming from Shields Lake. A fishing pier provides shore fishing access and a winter aeration system has been in place since 1995. <br> \n <br> \nBluegills are the most abundant species in the lake and were sampled at high levels during this survey. Bluegills length ranged from 4 to 8 inches. Black Crappies are less abundant but are were found in average abundance for lakes similar to Shields. Black Crappie average size was 8 inches. Northern Pike were found in above average numbers and above average size. One 11.5 inch Largemouth Bass was observed during the survey. Other species sampled in low abundance include, Black Bullhead, Brown Bullhead, Pumpkinseed Sunfish and Common Carp.   <br> \n  <br> \n</p>",

There is no formal boat launch but anglers are able to haul canoes from the parking area down the hill to the lake. A fishing pier provides shore fishing access. A winter aeration system has been in place since 1995. Bluegills are the most abundant species in the lake and were sampled at record levels during this survey. Over 75% of the bluegills sampled exceeded 6 inches but only 18% were longer than 7 inches. Black crappies were also abundant, but were small. Only 9% exceeded 8 inches. Northern pike were found in average numbers and above average size. Largemouth bass and walleyes were sampled in low numbers. Other species sampled include bowfin (dogfish), black bullhead and brown bullhead.  </p>",
