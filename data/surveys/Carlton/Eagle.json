Walleye is the primary management species for Eagle Lake.   <br> \n <br> \nWalleye are self-sustaining and have not been stocked into Eagle Lake since 1989.  Walleye abundance of 8.3 per gillnet lift was above average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Walleye average length was 13.7 inches.  Anglers should expect good fishing for Walleye, with a strong 2015 year-class entering the fishery soon. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie population density was above average compared to other similar Minnesota lakes.  The 2016 catch rate of 6.8 per trapnet lift represents a historic high for Black Crappie in Eagle Lake.  Black Crappie average length was large at 9.7 inches.  Black Crappie angling should be very good in 2017 with above average abundance and size.  Bluegill population density was average compared to other similar Minnesota lakes.  Bluegill averaged 6.4 inches with some quality sized fish available over 8.0 inches.  Yellow Perch are very abundant in Eagle Lake.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike abundance of 2.1 per gillnet lift was near average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Average length was 24.1 inches and growth was fast relative to other Duluth Area lakes. <br> \n</p>",

Eagle Lake YOY and age-1 Walleye have been indexed annually with night electrofishing from 1999 through 2021.  Collection of these data is important as an early indicator of Walleye year-class strength for Eagle Lake.  Eagle Lake has not been stocked with Walleye since 1955 because the population has been able to adequately sustain itself through natural reproduction.   <br> \n <br> \nZero YOY Walleye were sampled for a catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) of 0.0 per hour of electrofishing on-time.  Catch rates from previous investigations ranged from 0.0 to 57.7 per hour.  Average size of YOY Walleye from previous investigations ranged from 5.2 to 6.5 inches.  The below average abundance of YOY Walleye suggests that a below average 2021 year-class is possible.   <br> \n <br> \nTwenty-nine age-1 Walleye were sampled for a catch rate of 27.1 per hour of electrofishing.  Catch rates for age-1 Walleye from previous investigations ranged from 0.0 to 127.1 per hour.  Length of age-1 Walleye was slightly above average at 9.0 inches.  Prior average lengths have ranged from 7.9 to 9.8 inches.  The above average abundance and large average size of age-1 Walleye sampled in 2020 suggests that an above average 2020 year-class is likely.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Abundance of walleye in Eagle Lake, indexed with assessment nets, was 8.7 per lift in 1996.  This index value is above the median compared to lakes of similar type and also similar to previous samples collected from Eagle Lake.  Walleye aged from 1996 indicate strong 1994 and 1995 year classes, and at least some successful reproduction from all years since 1984, Mean length of walleye sampled in 1996 was 12.6 inches.     yellow perch index netting value of 78.1 was the highest ever recorded for Eagle Lake.  Size structure was good with 43% of sampled perch eight inches or longer.  Length at age IV of 7.2 inches was average to fast compared to other perch populations in the Duluth Area.     Abundance of both bluegill and black crappie have increased slightly between 1953 and 1996.  Bluegill index netting value of 2.6 per lift in 1996 was the highest ever recorded, while the black crappie value of 2.1 was the second highest.  However, these values are below respective medians compared to other lakes of similar type.  Size structure of panfish from 1996 was fair for black crappie and poor for bluegill.  This was influenced by strong 1994 and 1995 panfish year classes and poor representation of panfish born from 1988 through 1993.     Comments from shoreline property owners recorded during the survey indicate a worsening of algae blooms in recent years.  Eagle Lake is heavily developed, with many cabins close to the water and many lots groomed to waters edge.  Accelerated nutrient loading of the lake, caused by shoreline use, could result in a reduction in walleye recruitment and increases in recruitment of panfish and other species.  Providing Eagle Lake residents with Shoreland Best Management Practices information would be beneficial.</p>",

Eagle Lake young-of-the-year (YOY) and age-one Walleye have been indexed annually with night electrofishing from 1999 through 2016.  Collection of these data is important as an early indicator of Walleye year-class strength for Eagle Lake. <br> \n <br> \nOne YOY Walleye measuring 6.0 inches long was captured during the 2016 investigation for a catch rate of 0.9 per hour of electrofishing.  Catch rates from previous investigations ranged from 0.0 to 57.7 per hour.  Average size of YOY Walleye from previous investigations ranged from 5.2 to 6.5 inches.  The below average abundance of YOY Walleye suggests that a poor 2016 year-class is possible.   <br> \n <br> \nEight age-1 Walleye were sampled in 2016 for a catch rate of 6.9 per hour of electrofishing.  Catch rates for age-1 Walleye from previous investigations ranged from 1.3 to 127.1 per hour.  The moderate catch of age-1 Walleye in 2015 suggests that an average year-class from 2015 is likely. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Eagle Lake is a 380 acre lake with 113 (30%) littoral acres and a maximum depth of 35 feet.  The lake is located south of Cromwell, MN.  There is one MNDNR-owned, concrete public access located on the northeast side of the lake off of CR #123.  Walleye and yellow perch are the primary management species with secondary management of black crappie and bluegill.  The walleye population is maintained throught natural reproduction.    Walleye abundance was 12.1 fish/gillnet and was above average for Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Historically, walleye abundance has been average to above average compared to similar Minnesota lakes.  Multiple age classes of fish were present in assessment samples with fish ages 2-4 making up the majority.  Growth was below average with a mean length at age 4 of 13.6 inches.  The overall mean length of fish sampled was 14.9 inches.  Northern pike abundance was 2.7 fish/gillnet, an average value for Minnesota lakes of similar type and was within the historic range for Eagle Lake.  The mean length at age 4 was 23.5 inches, which represents average growth for Duluth Area lakes.  The mean length of northern pike in 2003 (22.1 inches)  declined from 1996 (25.0 inches).  Age analysis revealed four age classes (age 2-5).    Yellow perch abundance was 78.6 fish/gillnet.  Over the past four investigations (1990, 1993, 1996, 2003), yellow perch abundance has been well above average for Minnesota lakes of similar type.  The mean length of fish sampled was 7.6 inches and was relatively unchanged from 1996 (7.8 inches).  Growth was above average for Duluth Area lakes with a mean length at age 4 of 7.5 inches.  Age 1, 2, 4 and 5 fish comprised 86% of the 66 fish aged.  Bluegill abundance was 5.0 fish/trapnet which was below average for Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Growth was fast compared to other Duluth Area lakes with age 4 fish reaching 7.1 inches.  The overall mean length of fish sampled was 5.0 inches.  Seventy-four percent of the aged bluegill were 2 years old.      Other fish species sampled during the assessment included black crappie, bigmouth buffalo, bowfin, brown bullhead, burbot, pumpkinseed, rock bass, white sucker and yellow bullhead.   Eagle Lake is one of the most productive walleye fisheries in the Duluth Area and, especially, in Carlton County.  The walleye fishery is supported by natural reproduction with abundant yellow perch as a forage base.  Other Eagle Lake fish species are within the ranges expected for lakes of similar size and location.</p>",

Eagle Lake YOY and age-1 Walleye have been indexed annually with night electrofishing from 1999 through 2023. Collection of these data is important as an early indicator of Walleye year-class strength for Eagle Lake. Eagle Lake has not been stocked with Walleye since 1955 because the population has been able to adequately sustain itself through natural reproduction.  <br> \n <br> \nZero YOY Walleye were sampled for a catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) of 0.0 per hour of electrofishing on-time. Catch rates from previous investigations ranged from 0.0 to 57.7 per hour with an average catch rate of 12.6 per hour. Average size of YOY Walleye from previous investigations ranged from 5.2 to 6.5 inches. The absence of YOY Walleye suggests that a below average 2024 year-class is possible.  <br> \n <br> \nFive age-1 Walleye were sampled for a catch rate of 4.36 per hour of electrofishing. Catch rates for age-1 Walleye from previous investigations ranged from 0.0 to 27.1 per hour. Length of age-1 Walleye was average at 8.3 inches. Prior average lengths have ranged from 7.9 to 10.6 inches. The low abundance of age-1 Walleye sampled in 2024 suggests the 2023 year-class could be below average. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Eagle Lake is a 380 acre lake with 113 (30%) littoral acres and a maximum depth of 35 feet. The lake is located south of Cromwell, MN.  There is a state owned and administered concrete public access located on the northeast side of the lake off of County Road #123.  Walleye and yellow perch are the primary management species with secondary management of black crappie and bluegill. The walleye population is maintained through natural reproduction.  Eagle was surveyed during the summer of 2008 to update information about fish populations.   <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance of 9.9 per gillnet lift was above average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Walleye mean length was 13.0 inches and growth was average compared to other Duluth Area lakes.  Over 20% of the sample captured was greater than 18 inches in length.  All year-classes from 2001 to 2007 were represented.  In addition, walleyes were captured from the 1995, 1998 and 1999 year-classes.     <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike abundance of 4.0 per gillnet lift was average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Mean length was 24.3 inches and growth was above average when compared to other Duluth Area lakes.  All year-classes from 2002 to 2006 were represented in the sample. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch abundance of 36.7 per gillnet lift was above average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Mean length of perch was 7.2 inches and growth was above average when compared to other Duluth Area lakes.  All year-classes from 2002 to 2007 were represented.  Shoreline seining sampled 495 young-of-the-year (YOY) yellow perch indicating another strong year-class for 2008. <br> \n <br> \nThe bluegill trapnet catch of 5.3 per lift was average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Bluegill mean length was 4.9 inches and growth was above average when compared to other Duluth Area lakes.  All year-classes from 2002 through 2007 were represented.  Shoreline seining sampled 367 YOY bluegill indicating a strong year-class for 2008. <br> \n <br> \nThe black crappie trapnet catch of 0.2 per lift was below average compared Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Black crappie mean length was 9.5 inches, but not enough individuals were sampled to evaluate stock density or growth. <br> \n <br> \nA total of 5 largemouth bass were sampled by electrofishing.  The catch rate of largemouth bass was 3.5 fish per hour of electrofishing on-time.  Mean length of the bass was 14.7 inches, but not enough individuals were sampled to evaluate stock density or growth.  Year-classes from 2002, 2003 and 2005 were represented.  Shoreline seining sampled 20 YOY bass. <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species sampled included black bullhead, brown bullhead, yellow bullhead, bowfin, commom shiner, creek chub, tadpole madtom, pumpkinseed sunfish, rock bass, Johnny darter and white sucker.    <br> \n <br> \nInformation was collected on aquatic vegetation, substrate and water quality.  Diversity of aquatic plants was average with 28 species or species groups identified along 20 transects.  Blue-green algae was the most frequently found plant (85% of transects) followed by wild celery and northern water milfoil (75% and 70% of transects, respectively).  Numerous plant species or species groups were found at only one transect (5%) including the bladderwort group, floating-leaf burreed, river bulrush and the water moss group.  The most common substrate types were sand, gravel and rubble which were identified along 85%, 50% and 45% of the transects, respectively.  Results of laboratory water analysis indicate Eagle is a slightly acidic, moderately hard water lake with moderate fertility.    <br> \n</p>",

YOY and age-1 Walleye have been indexed annually with night electrofishing from 1999 through 2022. Collection of these data is important as an early indicator of Walleye year-class strength for Eagle Lake. Eagle Lake has not been stocked with Walleye since 1955 because the population has been able to adequately sustain itself through natural reproduction.  <br> \n <br> \nThirteen YOY Walleye were sampled for a catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) of 10.83 per hour of electrofishing on-time. Catch rates from previous investigations ranged from 0.0 to 57.7 per hour with an average catch rate of 16.7 per hour. Average size of YOY Walleye from previous investigations ranged from 5.2 to 6.5 inches. The average size in 2023 was 6.1. The below average abundance of YOY Walleye suggests that a below average 2023 year-class is possible.  <br> \n <br> \nOne age-1 Walleye was sampled for a catch rate of 0.83 per hour of electrofishing. Catch rates for age-1 Walleye from previous investigations ranged from 0.0 to 27.1 per hour. Length of age-1 Walleye was average at 8.8 inches. Prior average lengths have ranged from 7.9 to 10.6 inches. The low abundance of age-1 Walleye sampled in 2023 suggests the 2022 year-class could be below average. <br> \n</p>",
