                "narrative": "<p>The population level of walleye is still good but down from 1983 survey, with all sizes present. Northern pike abundance was good with various sizes present. Bowfin, northern cisco, northern pike, white sucker, black bullheads, yellow bullheads, rock bass, bluegill, largemouth bass and walleye net catches all indicated a normal to average population abundance. Brown bullhead, pumpkinseed, black crappie and yellow perch abundance is low with net catches below the first quartile of the area median of similar lake types. The northern cisco population level showed no change, with numbers remaining high (10.9/lift). The northern pike abundance remained the same 4.9/ lift on gill nets in 1988 and 4.0/lift in 1983. The length frequency distribution is good with sizes ranging from 10.0 to 26.9 inches long. The bulk of the population was in the 19.0-20.9 inch range, with the annuli indicating average growth rates. The bluegill net catch was average for lakes of this type with sizes small, and yet growth rates were average. The largemouth bass population level remains low with a slight rise in abundance over the 1983 survey. The length-frequency distribution is good with sizes ranging from 5.5-17.9 inches, and the annuli indicating slow to average growth rates. The black crappies aged indicated an average to fast growth rate. The yellow perch population level remained low with only 4 taken in the trap nets and 0 in the gill nets compared to 1.0/lift in gill nets and 0.3/trap net in 1983. The walleye abundance seems to fluctuate as surveys show 3.8/lift in 1955; 3.2/lift in 1971; 2.3/ lift in 1979; 7.0/lift in 1983 and 4.3/lift in 1988. The length frequency was from 8.0-23.9 inches, with the bulk of the population in the teens. Growth rates of the annuli was average to fast when compared to the statewide averages.</p>",

The aquatic plant community is diverse.  Marl and sand are the commonest soils in shallow water areas.  These soils tend to be less productive for fish spawning because they are \"soft\" rather than \"firm\".  Firm bottoms areas found in association with bulrush beds are important spawning areas for bass and panfish species.The lake also contains a diverse fish community.  Compared to similar type lakes, northern pike were present in \"average\" numbers in 1993.  They grew well and averaged 3.5 lbs..  Walleyes were found in low numbers in spite of regular stockings.  Low numbers of yellow perch were present as well.  Both largemouth and smallmouth bass were sampled in 1993.  Bluegills and rock bass were found in \"high\" numbers, as were tullibees.  Black crappie numbers were \"low\", however.  Other species present in 1993 included dogfish (bowfin), shorthead and silver redhorses, white sucker, pumpkinseeds and green and hybrid sunfish.  Black, brown and yellow bullheads were also present.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Ossawinamakee is a 644 acre lake located about three miles north of Breezy Point in Crow Wing County.  The lake is heavily developed with 343 homes/cabins and one campground/recreational vehicle park along its 13.1 miles of shoreline (26.2 homes per mile).  The maximum depth is 63' with about 35% of the lake being 15' deep or less.  A variety of sand, marl, gavel and rubble substrates occur in shallow waters which helps support a diverse aquatic plant community.  There is a public access located on the east end of the lake.  Lake users need to take extra precautions when transporting equipment from this lake as Eurasian watermilfoil and zebra mussels, both prohibited invasive species, are present.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye are currently stocked as fingerlings at a rate of 2 pounds/littoral acre every other year.  The 2009 walleye catch rate fell to 0.9/gill net, the lowest rate recorded in any of the nine assessments since 1955.  Average size increased to 20.6\" and 3.9 pounds in 2009.   <br> \nThe northern pike catch rate decreased to 7.1/gill net, down from a high of 9.6/gill net in 2003.  Average size was 21.2\" and 2.3 pounds with 26% of these fish measuring at least 24\". <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass were caught in high numbers in gill nets (1.25/gill net) and low numbers in trap nets (0.2/trap net) when compared to similar lakes.  Bluegills were captured at a rate of 42.2/trap net, similar to the 2003 catch and \"high\" relative to similar lakes.  Growth was slow and 17% of bluegills sampled measured at least 7\". <br> \n <br> \nImportant forage species for this lake include yellow perch and tullibee.  While the catch rate for yellow perch (1.1/gill net) showed a statistically significant increase from 2003, the catch remains \"very low\" when compared to similar lakes.  Tullibee, which had been captured in high numbers in recent surveys, decreased to a catch of 2.1/gill net, about \"average\" for similar lakes. <br> \n</p>",

Size was good, with an average length of 19.1\" and 81% of the fish measuring 12\" or larger. <br> \n <br> \nPanfish catches don't seem to offer much to interest anglers.  Black Crappies have historically been caught in low numbers and only 0.9/net were caught in 2021.  Average size was 9.2\" and 64% of the fish were 8\" or larger.  Bluegill numbers were better (12.3/trap net), but size was small.  Average size was 4.6\" with only 2% measuring 7\" or larger.  No fish over 8\" were seen.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike numbers were average (8.1/gill net), with a mean length of 21.1\".  Fish up to 34.2\" were captured.  Largemouth Bass numbers looked good while electrofishing at 145.9/hr.  Average length was 10.2\", with 34% measuring 12\" or larger.  One Smallmouth Bass was captured as well. <br> \n <br> \nIf you choose to fish this lake, be aware that it contains zebra mussels and Eurasian watermilfoil.  Please thoroughly clean you boat before and after leaving the lake, being sure not to transport any water as well.  Lake users are required to inspect and remove any aquatic plants and animals from their watercraft and trailers as well as remove the plug and drain all water from the watercraft, including bilges, livewells and baitwells. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Ossawinamakee is a 644 acre lake located about three miles north of Breezy Point in Crow Wing County.  A public access is located on the east end of the lake.  The lake is heavily developed with 275 homes/cabins and several resorts and campgrounds along 13.1 miles of shoreline based on 1993 data.  The maximum depth is 63' and about 35% of the lake is 15' deep or less.  Shallow water substrates consist primarily of sand, marl, gravel, and rubble.  The aquatic plant community is quite diverse with 47 species present and is critical to maintaining healthy fish populations.  Emergent plants such as bulrush are somewhat common along the shoreline, and are important for shoreline protection, maintaining water quality, and provide essential spawning habitat for bass and panfish species.  Submerged plants provide food and cover needed by fish and other aquatic species.  Eurasian watermilfoil and zebra mussels are present is this lake and it is imperative that lake users take measures to prevent them from being introduced into other lakes and wetlands.  The 2003 walleye catch of 2.4/gill net is similar to past catches on this lake and typical of the catch on similar lakes.  Average length and weight were similar to the previous netting in 1998 at 18.9\" and 2.5 lbs.  Northern pike were caught in high numbers in 2003 at 9.6/gill net, which is the highest catch to date.  Average length and weight were also similar to 1998 at 19.1\" and 1.7 lbs.  Growth was average with 8% of these fish measuring at least 24\".  Largemouth bass were caught in relatively high numbers when compared to similar lakes.  Spring electrofishing resulted in a largemouth bass catch rate of 157/hr with an average length of 11.0\" and 42% measuring at least 12\".  Bluegill were sampled in average numbers at 28.1/trap net.  Growth was slow.  Black crappies were present in relatively low numbers (0.5/gill net and 0.1/trap net) when compared to similar lakes.Tullibee and yellow perch are important forage species for the lake's game fish.  Tullibee abundance has been high in the past and continued to be in 2003 at 7.2/gill net while yellow perch abundance has been low in all nettings, including this one.   </p>",

The catch during this survey was 1.3/net; although average size was good at 21\" and all of the fish were 16\" or larger.   <br> \n <br> \nPanfish don't seem to offer much for fishing.  Black crappies have historically been caught in low numbers and only two were captured in 2015.  Bluegill numbers were better (16.1/net), but size was small.  Average size was 5.6\" with only 10% measuring 7\" or larger. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike and largemouth bass look like the best species to target on Ossawinnamakee.  Pike numbers were above average (13.2/net), with a mean length of 20.5\".  Fish up to 35\" were captured.  Largemouth bass numbers looked good while electrofishing at 94.0/hr.  Average length was 12.8\", with 64% measuring 12\" or larger. <br> \n <br> \nIf you choose to fish this lake, be aware that it contains zebra mussels and Eurasian watermilfoil.  Please thoroughly clean you boat before and after leaving the lake, being sure not to transport any water as well. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of the nearshore fish community, as well as coldwater habitat, in Lake Ossawinnamakee was conducted by Fisheries Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program Staff from 25-26 July 2022. Fourteen sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 15-foot or 50-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at all 14 sites with one site sampled from the boat due to deep, soft sediments. A 50-foot seine was used to sample ten sites, a 15-foot seine was used at two sites, and soft sediments with abundant vegetation and deep water prevented the use of seines at two sampling sites. Nearshore sampling captured 23 native species of fish including eight species that are intolerant of disturbance (Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, Least Darter, Logperch, Mimic Shiner, and Rock Bass) and one species (Green Sunfish) that is tolerant of disturbance. <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore data were combined with gill net and trap net data from a June 2021 survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based IBI (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment. In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g., Blackchin Shiner, Iowa Darter, and Rock Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g., Black Bullhead, Fathead Minnow, and Green Sunfish). The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.  <br> \n <br> \nA temperature-dissolved oxygen profile was collected in the deepest basin on Ossawinnamakee Lake on July 25th, 2022 to evaluate the amount of cold, oxygenated water (i.e., oxythermal habitat) available to Cisco, also known as Tullibee. Based on the profile, the top of the thermocline (i.e., the location in the water column with the sharpest transition from warm to cold water) occurred at approximately 17 feet. Dissolved oxygen decreased to below 3.0 mg/L at 32.5 feet, which was below the thermocline, at the time of sampling. The temperature at which dissolved oxygen decreased to below 3.0 mg/L (TDO3, a single variable to characterize oxythermal habitat) was 7.3?C (45.1?F). <br> \n <br> \nTDO3 values cooler than 21.5?C indicate that oxythermal conditions are favorable for Cisco. Dissolved oxygen concentrations below the thermocline indicate that suitable oxythermal habitat for Cisco was available across a range of depths at the time of sampling during the summer of 2022. Data collected in 1993-2002 further indicate suitable oxythermal habitat across years, with the least favorable conditions recorded in 1997. When adequate oxythermal habitat is available, Cisco are not squeezed into unfavorable, warmer water conditions and therefore do not experience higher levels of stress. <br> \n <br> \nResults from this survey indicate Lake Ossawinnamakee is in good health as indicated by an exceptionally high FIBI score well above the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes and a TDO3 that indicated coldwater habitat conditions were favorable to support Cisco at the time of the survey. Data from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community, and the coldwater habitat, to the Pine River Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Temperature-dissolved oxygen profiles were collected in the deepest basins on Ossawinnamakee Lake on August 14th, 2023, to evaluate the amount of cold, oxygenated water (i.e., oxythermal habitat) available to Cisco, also known as Tullibee. Two profiles were collected due to the size and complexity of the lake (i.e., Water Quality Station 1 and 2).  Based on the average of the two profiles, the top of the thermocline (i.e., the location in the water column with the sharpest transition from warm to cold water) occurred at approximately 16 feet. Dissolved oxygen decreased to below 3.0 mg/L at 27.1 feet in Water Quality Station 1 (WQ 1), and 35.5 feet in WQ 2, both of which were well below the thermocline at the time of sampling. The temperature at which dissolved oxygen decreased to below 3.0 mg/L in WQ 2 (i.e., TDO3, a single variable to characterize oxythermal habitat) was 7.8?C (46.0?F). <br> \n <br> \nTDO3 values cooler than 21.5?C indicate that oxythermal conditions are favorable for Cisco. Dissolved oxygen concentrations below the thermocline indicate that suitable oxythermal habitat for Cisco was available across a wide range of depths at the time of sampling during the summer of 2023. Data collected in 1993, 1994, 1995, 1996, 1997, 2001, 2002, and 2022 further indicate suitable oxythermal habitat across years, with the least favorable conditions recorded in 1999. When inadequate oxythermal habitat is available, Cisco are squeezed into unfavorable, warmer water conditions and therefore experience higher levels of stress.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Ossawinamakee is a 644 acre lake located about five miles southwest of Crosslake in Crow Wing County.  There is a public access located on the east side of the lake.  The lake has a maximum depth of 63 feet and about 35% of the lake surface is less than 15 feet deep.  The late June secchi disc reading was 18.5 ft. in 1998, above average for the area but typical for marl type lakes.A fish population assessment was done in 1998.  In 1998, the walleye catch was typical for similar type lakes and showed a statistically  significant increase over the 1993 catch.  An excellent size distribution was present with fish from 10-27 inches present in the catch.  Seven year classes were present and growth was good.  Stocking of fingerlings is presently done every even numbered year.  Three of the four strongest year classes sampled in '98 were from stocking years.Northern pike abundance has been fairly stable over previous nettings.  The '98 catch showed a statistically significant increase in abundance and was the highest to date.  Most pike were from the 1994-'96 year classes and had good growth.  Size ranged from 9-30 inches and averaged 18 inches.Largemouth bass abundance was in the \"high\" category.  As is typical for summer netting, most bass were from one year class and growth was good.  Bluegill abundance remained in the \"high\" category and average size was small.  The strongest year classes were from 1995 and 1994 and growth was slow.  Black crappie were only sampled in gill nets in '98. Yellow perch, an important forage species continued to be sampled in \"low\" numbers when compared to similar type lakes, but in typical numbers for this lake.  Tullibee, another important forage species, was present in \"high\" numbers but in a variety of sizes up to 17 inches.</p>",
