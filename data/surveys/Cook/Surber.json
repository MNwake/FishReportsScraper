The last change occurred after 2002, when rainbow trout stocking was discontinued and brook trout stocking resumed.  This was the second of two population assessments included in the 2001 lake management plan to determine whether survival and growth of stocked brook trout were satisfactory. <br> \n <br> \nThe 2011 assessment found average numbers of brook trout, of average size for a lake in this area.  Survival of brook trout stocked prior to 2011 appears to have been adequate, and long range goals for brook trout in the current lake management plan were met.  The 2010 brook trout stocking may have failed; no one-year-old  fish were collected, even though they should have been large enough to capture in the gill nets in this fall assessment.  No four-year-old fish were taken either; however, Surber Lake is fairly accessible, and survival of many fish to that age would not be expected given the amount of harvest likely to occur in this lake. <br> \n <br> \nGrowth of brook trout had been slower than average, despite the absence of any competing fish species.  Fish taken in 2011 reached an average length of 8.9 inches at the end of their second year, compared to an average of 9.8 inches in similar lakes in this area.  Slow growth limits the quality of the brook trout population in this lake.  Poor summer temperature-oxygen conditions may be one factor limiting brook trout growth.  A temperature-oxygen profile measured on 22 July 2011 showed only a narrow band of waters suitable for brook trout, at depths of 10 to 13 ft, and it is likely that band narrowed further as the summer progressed. <br> \n</p>",
