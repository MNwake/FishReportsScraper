                "narrative": "<p>Lake Leven is a relatively shallow and productive lake which supports an abundant and diverse aquaticplant community.  The fish community present in Lake Leven is dominated by sunfish, largemouth bass,and northern pike which is typical of lakes with similar physical and biological characteristics.   Bluegill angling opportunities are excellent.  Bluegill are abundant and over 65% of the fish aregreater than 6.0 inches in length.  Quality largemouth bass angling opportunities also exist. Largemouth bass are present in moderate numbers, and most are relatively large fish.  Most largemouthbass captured during the latest survey were between 13 and 19 inches in length with an average weightof 2.2 pounds.  Northern pike abundance is low.  Gillnet catch rate decreased dramatically since thelast survey in 1988 and is currently below the normal range for similar lakes.  Drought conditions andlow water levels likely resulted in poor reproduction during the late 1980's and early 1990's. Northern pike abundance should return to previous levels with the recent return to normal precipitationand higher water.  Walleye abundance is also low.  Gillnet catch rate was less than previous surveysand below the normal range of catch rates for similar lakes.  The recent walleye fry stockingevaluation has proven largely unsuccessful.  A return to walleye fingerling stocking in one of everythree years may maintain a moderate level of fish to provide some additional angling opportunities.    </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Leven Lake is a 283 acre eutrophic lake located in the upper reaches of the East Branch of the Chippewa River watershed.  It was originally the headwaters of the East Branch until the early 1900's, when Judicial Ditch #4 was constructed through southeastern Douglas county, through West Lake Ellen, and into Leven Lake.  This ditch drains a watershed of approximately 8500 acres of mostly agricultural land.  This drainage has likely contributed significant amounts of sediment and nutrients to Leven Lake over the years and has negatively impacted water quality.  However, Leven Lake still supports an abundant and diverse aquatic plant community.  These aquatic plants provide critical spawning and nursery habitat for many fish species and are important in maintaining existing water quality by competing with algae for the available nutrients.    Unfortunately, Leven Lake experienced a partial winterkill during the severe winter of 1996-97. Walleye, largemouth bass, and common carp were found dead along the shoreline following ice-out in 1997.  Northern pike, yellow perch, black crappie, and yellow bullhead were the only species captured in trap nets during a special assessment in May of 1997.  There are no other records of winterkill on Leven Lake prior to this event.The effects of the partial winterkill on the fish community of Leven Lake are apparent in the results of the population assessment completed in 1998.  Tolerant species such as northern pike, yellow perch, and black bullhead are abundant; while bluegill, black crappie, and largemouth bass numbers are limited.  Fishing opportunities are presently limited.  Gamefish are mostly small, one and two year old fish.  Hopefully, sunfish and largemouth bass will successfully reproduce and return to levels that provide the quality angling opportunities that Leven Lake has been known for. The presence of numerous one year old bluegill and black crappie suggest that they reproduced well in 1997.Interestingly, walleye gill net catches averaged 4.5 fish/net in 1998.  This catch rate is within the normal range for this lake type and is consistent with historical catch rates.  The characteristics of the present population fully meet the goals for the \"bonus fishery\" described in the Lake Management Plan.  Walleye fingerlings are stocked in one of every three years, however these fish likely migrated upstream from lakes Villard and Amelia.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Leven Lake is a 283-acre eutrophic lake that is the upper basin forming a chain of three lakes (Leven, Villard, and Amelia).  The basins are located within the headwaters of the East Branch of the Chippewa River in northeast Pope County.  Judicial Ditch 4, which drains a mostly agricultural watershed of approximately 8,500 acres, enters into the northeast side of Leven Lake.  This drainage has likely contributed significant amounts of nutrient and sediment to the lake and has negatively impacted water quality.  Water quality indices rank in the bottom third of 18 recreational lakes monitored by the Pope County Coalition of Lake Associations.  <br> \n <br> \nEmergent aquatic vegetation is abundant along the western shoreline and near the public access.  Aquatic plants provide critical spawning and cover habitat for many fish species.  These areas need to be protected from shoreline alterations associated with residential development. <br> \n <br> \nThe fish community in Leven Lake is typical of a small, eutrophic lake in west-central Minnesota.  Northern pike, bluegill and largemouth bass provide most of the fishing opportunities.  Northern pike are abundant.  Almost one-half of the fish captured in gillnets exceeded 21.0 inches in length.  The largest northern pike measured 32.1 inches.  Bluegill are also abundandt, but average size is small.  Most of the fish captured were between five and seven inches in length.  Largemouth bass are present in moderate numbers.  The largest fish measured 17.8 inches in length.  Walleye gillnet catches averaged 4.2 fish/net.  The average length of sampled fish was 16.7 inches.  The largest walleye measured 28.3 inches.  Black crappie also contribute to the fishery, but are not effectively sampled with standard survey gear during summer months. <br> \n</p>",

Backpack electrofishing and/or seining were conducted at 10 stations, representing a variety of habitat types, along the shoreline of Lake Leven.  The survey was conducted during the five-year sampling window for intensive monitoring efforts within the Chippewa River watershed, and will be contributing to a watershed assessment process in coordination with Minnesota Pollution Control Agency.\n\nThirteen species were collected during this survey.  Two species (Banded Killifish and Iowa Darter) were considered \"intolerant\" based on current tolerance classifications for Minnesota lakes.  No \"tolerant\" species were captured. \n\nNearshore catch data will be used along with gill and trap net catch data to develop an Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) score, which is indicative of the health of Lake Leven.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of the nearshore fish community in Leven Lake was conducted by Fisheries Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program Staff starting July 6, 2020. Ten sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 15-foot or 50-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at all ten sites with one site sampled from the boat. Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample seven sites, a 15-foot seine was used at one site, and soft sediments with abundant vegetation and deep water prevented the use of seines at two stations. Nearshore sampling captured 13 native and one non-native (Common Carp) species of fish including five species that are intolerant of disturbance (Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, and Pugnose Shiner) and two species that are tolerant of disturbance (Common Carp and Fathead Minnow).  <br> \n <br> \nA summer trap net survey was conducted in conjunction with the targeted survey of the nearshore fish community. Bluegill and Pumpkinseed dominated the trap net catch numbers and represented 81% of the individuals captured, but only comprised approximately 46% of total trap net biomass. Of the 203 Bluegills sampled, 47% were between 5 and 7 inches, and 6% were over 7 inches. There were not any Bluegills over 8 inches sampled. Approximately 53% of the 47 Pumpkinseed sampled were between 5 and 7 inches, 21% were over 7 inches in length, and there was one individual (2%) that was over 8 inches in length. <br> \n <br> \nThese trap net and nearshore survey data are combined with data from a July 2019 gill net survey to describe the fish community and provide a fish-based Index of Biotic Integrity (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment. The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. The FIBI score for Leven Lake from this survey is above an impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes, while a 2019 FIBI survey resulted in a score just below the impairment treshold. For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website. <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Chippewa River Watershed assessment of surface waters process completed in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey was completed in the spring of 2022 on Lake Leven to assess the Bluegill and Black Crappie populations.  A special regulation that reduced the daily sunfish limit from 20 down to 10 was also implemented in the spring of 2022.  The goal of this new regulation is to maintain or increase the average size of Bluegill.  This survey will be used to help evaluate effects of the regulation on the Bluegill population.  Bluegill catch rates were low, but some quality fish were observed during the survey.  Thirty five percent of the Bluegill were over 8 inches in length.  Growth rates of Bluegill in Lake Leven are moderate and 7 year old Bluegill averaged almost 8 inches in length.  The largest Bluegill observed in the survey was almost 9 inches.  Black Crappie catch rates were also low, but most of the sample consisted of quality sized fish.  Approximately 64% of the fish were greater than 10 inches in length.  Black Crappie growth rates are moderate; average length of age 4 fish was almost 10 inches.  The largest Black Crappie in the sample was almost 13 inches and the oldest crappie was 10 years old. <br> \n <br> \nQuality fishing opportunities exist for multiple species in Lake Leven.  Anglers are encouraged to practice selective harvest to help sustain the quality of the fishery.  Selective harvest encourages the release of larger fish while promoting harvest of more abundant smaller fish.  Releasing medium to large fish can help restore and maintain fish community balance, as well as increase opportunities to catch large fish in the future. <br> \n <br> \nLake Leven was designated as an infested water due to the discovery of zebra mussels in 2021.  Recreational users should take necessary precautions to prevent further spread of invasive species.  Drain all water and remove all aquatic vegetation from your boat and trailer when leaving any body of water. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey was completed in the spring of 2023 on Lake Leven to assess the Bluegill and Black Crappie populations. A special regulation that reduced the daily sunfish limit from 20 down to 10 was implemented in the spring of 2022. The goal of this regulation is to maintain or increase the average size of Bluegill. This survey will be used to help evaluate effects of the regulation on the Bluegill population. Bluegill catch rates were low, but some quality fish were observed during the survey. Thirty four percent of the Bluegill were over 8 inches in length. Growth rates of Bluegill in Lake Leven are moderate and 8 year old Bluegill averaged almost 8 inches in length. The largest Bluegill observed in the survey was almost 9.5 inches. Black Crappie catch rates were high and most of the fish were quality size or larger. Approximately 60% of the fish were greater than 10 inches in length. Black Crappie growth rates are moderate; average length of age 4 fish was almost 10 inches. The largest Black Crappie in the sample was 13.5 inches and the oldest crappie was 14 years old. <br> \n <br> \nQuality fishing opportunities exist for multiple species in Lake Leven. Anglers are encouraged to practice selective harvest to help sustain the quality of the fishery. Selective harvest encourages the release of larger fish while promoting harvest of more abundant smaller fish. Releasing medium to large fish can help restore and maintain fish community balance, as well as increase opportunities to catch large fish in the future. <br> \n <br> \nLake Leven was designated as an infested water due to the discovery of zebra mussels in 2021. Recreational users should take necessary precautions to prevent further spread of invasive species. Drain all water and remove all aquatic vegetation from your boat and trailer when leaving any body of water. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Northern Pike gillnet catch rates remain high, averaging 15.0 fish/net night. Mean size of Northern Pike is small (1.3 lbs/Northern Pike). Recruitment to larger sizes appears limited. Yellow perch abundance is low (3.0 perch/gillnet) and may be a limiting factor in Northern Pike growth. Walleye fingerlings were stocked in 1986 and 1988. Walleye year-class strength is not correlated with stocking efforts. Natural reproduction or a natural run way account for the presence of 1982 and 1984 year-classes. These two year-classes appear as strong as the 1986 fingerling stocking. Bluegill abundance has declined from previous surveys, but mean weight has increased to 0.19 lbs. Proportional stock density determined from trapnet catches was calculated at 68 percent. Yellow Bullheads are abundant and large enough to have commercial value. No Largemouth Bass were captured in the netting survey. Electrofishing occurred too late in the spring to accurately assess Largemouth Bass population structure.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Leven is a 282-acre natural lake located in northeast Pope County.  It is the upstream basin of a three-lake chain of lakes that includes Leven Lake, Villard Lake, and Lake Amelia.  Maximum depth is 33.0 ft.  Average depth is approximately 13.0 ft.  Recreational uses and fisheries potential are seasonally impaired by nutrient enrichment stemming from a large, well-drained watershed.  Runoff from the largely cultivated watershed is delivered to Lake Leven through Pope County Judicial Ditch 4 and many private lateral drainage systems.  Lake Leven was added to the MPCA's 303(d) listing of Impaired Waters in 2002.   <br> \n <br> \nWater quality monitoring records from 1996 \u0013 2013 describe a eutrophic lake with increasing chlorophyll-a concentrations caused by algae and a corresponding decrease in water clarity.  Water transparency measurements average 5.1 feet during summer months.  At time of the July 8 survey, water temperatures in Lake Leven had become thermally stratified.  The thermocline set up at a relatively shallow 11.0 ft. in depth.  There was insufficient dissolved oxygen below 14.0 ft. to sustain gamefishes.   <br> \n <br> \nEmergent aquatic vegetation is abundant along the western shoreline and near the public access on the east shore. These aquatic plants provide critical spawning and cover habitat for many fish species. These areas need to be protected from shoreline alterations associated with residential development.  Submergent plants can be found growing at depths of 9.0 ft.  Plant growth can be rank in some years and limit fishable area.  Although infrequent, fish kills have been documented due to oxygen depletion under ice cover or upon annual die-off and decay of aquatic plants.  <br> \n <br> \nThe fish community in Leven Lake is typical of a small, eutrophic lake in west-central Minnesota. Northern Pike, Bluegill Sunfish, and Largemouth Bass populations support most of the fishing.  Survey data described a very abundant Northern Pike population.  Pike captures ranged from 16.4 \u0013 32.1 inches in length with a 2.0 pound average.  Bluegill proved to be moderately abundant.  Existing size structure of the bluegill population was relatively good.  Four percent of the bluegill catch exceeded 8.0 inches.  Largemouth Bass density is modest in comparison to similar lakes.  Quality of the fishery is very good.  Sixty-five percent of bass captured during the spring electrofishing survey exceeded 15.0 inches.  The largest bass measured was 18.1 inches in length.  Black crappie abundance estimates have varied greatly among surveys in response to annual irregularities in reproductive success and survival.  Only 10 crappies were captured during the 2013 survey.  Most were three- or four-year-old fish averaging 6.1 or 8.4 inches in length respectively.  Yellow perch continue to be surprisingly abundant given the excessive standing stock of Northern Pike.  No 8.0-inch or larger, harvestable perch were recorded in 2013 survey catches.  Large Walleye fingerlings, yearlings, or adults are stocked in even years.  Stockings and migration from downstream lakes help to maintain a low density population.  Eight Walleyes were captured in gillnets.  All fish exceeded 16.0 inches in length.  Mean length was 20.7 inches.  The largest capture measured 29.0 inches. <br> \n <br> \nNote:  Flowage connections among Leven, Villard, and Amelia lakes are not navigable. Each basin has a designated public access site. <br> \n <br> \nLake Leven is holding too many 16.0 \u0013 24.0\" pike.  Please harvest this surplus resource.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Leven Lake is a 283-acre eutrophic lake that is the upper basin in a chain of three lakes (Leven, Villard, and Amelia), located in the upper reaches of the East Branch of the Chippewa River in northeast Pope County.  Judicial Ditch 4, which drains a mostly agricultural watershed of approximately 8500 acres, enters into the northeast side of Leven Lake. This drainage has likely contributed significant amounts of nutrients and sediment to the lake and has negatively impacted water quality.  Leven Lake ranks in the bottom 30 percent of sixteen recreational lakes within Pope County in terms of water quality indices monitored by the Pope County Coalition of Lake Associations.Leven Lake experienced a partial winterkill during the severe winter of 1996-97.  Walleye, largemouth bass, and common carp were found dead along the shoreline following ice-out in the spring of 1997.  Northern pike, black crappie, yellow perch, and yellow bullhead were the only species captured in trap nets during the spring of 1997.  There are no other records of winterkill on Leven Lake.The fish community in Leven Lake is typical of a small, eutrophic lake in west-central Minnesota.  Northern pike, sunfish, and largemouth bass provide most of the fishing opportunities.  Northern pike are relatively abundant, but the average size is small.  Most of the fish captured were between 18 and 22 inches in length.   Bluegill numbers have increased in recent years and should provide some quality angling opportunities.  Over one-half of the fish captured in trap nets were 6 inches or greater.  Largemouth bass numbers are still limited following the partial winterkill in 1997.  Leven Lake has a history of supporting a moderate largemouth bass population comprised of mostly large individuals.Walleye are present in limited numbers.  Gill net catches averaged only 2.5 fish/net.  Most of the fish captured were between 18 and 22 inches in length.  Fingerlings were stocked in one of every three years between 1996 and 2001.  As with past surveys, there is little correlation between year class strength and stocking chronology.  Additional fingerlings were stocked in 2002 and will be stocked in even numbered years at a rate of 2.0 pounds per littoral acre as part of the Accelerated Walleye Program.      </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Leven Lake is 283-acre lake located in northeast Pope County.   It is the most upstream basin in a chain of three lakes, which includes Leven, Villard and Amelia lakes.  Flowage connections between these systems are non-navigable.  Average and maximum depths are 13 and 33 feet, respectively.  Pope County Judicial Ditch 4 drains into the northeast side of Leven Lake, contributing excessive nutrients and sediment from a predominantly agricultural watershed.  Water clarity is variable during summer months in response to algae blooms or rooted plant growth, but averages approximately 6.0 feet.  Aquatic vegetation can be excessively abundant and hinder watercraft operation. <br> \n <br> \nA standard fish survey was completed in early July to evaluate the fish community.  Northern Pike are very abundant.  Most are small, averaging 20.6 inches at capture.  Thirty-six percent of pike captures exceeded 21 inches.  The largest pike measured 31.9 inches. Anglers are encouraged to harvest small Northern Pike.  Harvesting smaller Northern Pike decreases competition for food, allowing pike to grow larger and these larger pike control smaller pike numbers through direct predation.  New Northern Pike regulations were implemented in 2018.  Leven Lake is in the North-central zone.  Anglers can now keep 10 Northern Pike.  No more than two pike longer than 26 inches can be harvested.  All pike measuring 22 to 26 inches must be released.  Northern Pike taken by spearing follow the same rules except one pike may be between 22 and 26 inches, or two larger than 26 inches. For more information see: https://www.dnr.state.mn.us/pike/index.html. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye catch rates were modest, but better than anticipated given the abundant Northern Pike population.  Walleye captures ranged from 17.1 to 27.8 inches, with an average of 20.8 inches. Age of the population sample ranged from 5 to 18 years old.  Walleye stocking was suspended in 2015 until Northern Pike densities decline and young Walleye survival is improved. <br> \n   <br> \nDaytime electrofishing took place on June 5th to assess Largemouth Bass size structure and abundance. The catch rate of Largemouth Bass 12 inches or greater describes a moderate population density.  Bass catches averaged 12.0 inches.  The largest capture measured 17.8 inches. <br> \n  <br> \nLake Leven supports both Black Crappie and Bluegills.  Black Crappies catches in trap nets set near shore were low as is typical during mid-summer surveys.  Catches likely under-represent actual abundance.  Those crappie captured were larger fish.  The largest capture measured 12.4 inches.  Bluegill proved to be abundant.  Those Bluegill caught in trap nets tended to be smaller than gill net catches, suggesting larger fish were off shore.   Twenty-seven percent of the gill net catch measured 8.0 to 9.3 inches, with an average of 7.1 inches.  Yellow Perch catches were very low.  All were too small to be harvestable. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Bullhead are very abundant and tend to be large.  Most of the bullhead catch ranged from 11.0 to 14.0 inches.  Additional species sampled include Bowfin (Dogfish), Brown Bullhead, Pumpkinseed Sunfish, and White Sucker. <br> \n   <br> \nThe DNR public access to Lake Leven is located off County Road 27 on the east side of the lake.  Leven Lake is currently not an infested water, but zebra mussels have been documented downstream in Lake Amelia.  Aquatic invasive species (AIS) are too easily moved from infested to non-infested waters. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain water from their boat before leaving the access. For more information regarding aquatic invasive species see the following: http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/invasives/aquatic/index.html. <br> \n</p>",
