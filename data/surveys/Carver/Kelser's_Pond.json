Kelser's Pond has not been managed for fishing so there are no established boat access points or fishing piers located on the lake. However, it is possible to carry in boats from a nearby park and access to shore fishing is possible along much of the shoreline. <br> \n <br> \nSpecies that are present in Kelser's pond and are of interest to anglers include bluegill sunfish, largemouth bass and black crappie.  Bluegill sunfish mean length was 6.39 inches and their abundance was above the third quartile for this lake class.  Black crappies averaged 8.26 inches in length.  The abundance of black crappie was near average for gill and trap nets when compared to other class 40 lakes.   <br> \n <br> \nAlthough gill nets and trap nets are not the ideal sampling equipment for largemouth bass, fourteen were sampled during this survey.  Their abundance was above average for class 40 lakes.  Largemouth bass averaged 14.16 inches in length and weighed an average of 1.59 pounds.  One northern pike was sampled during the survey.  It weighed 4.02 pounds and was 26.42 inches in length. <br> \n <br> \nOther species captured were brown bullhead, hybrid sunfish and green sunfish.   <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Kelser's Pond (also spelled Kelzer's Pond) is an 18 acre lake within the city limits of Victoria, MN in northeast Carver County.  Kelser's Pond has not been managed for fishing so there are no established boat access points or fishing piers located on the lake.  However, it is possible to carry in boats from a nearby park and access to shore fishing is possible along much of the shoreline.Our limited sampling indicated the presence of a fairly diverse fish community in Kelser's Pond.  Bluegill, hybrid sunfish, black crappie, largemouth bass, and brown bullhead were observed in trap net catches.  Bluegill were the dominant game fish species present in the lake and exhibited sufficient sizes and numbers to provide a decent fishery for interested anglers. Bluegill averaged 5 fish per pound and ranged between 4.0 to 7.5 inches in length, although 84% were between 6.0 and 7.0 inches for an average length of 6.5 inches.  Hybrid sunfish were found to be less abundant but equal in size (both weight and length) to bluegill.  One 12 inch (0.84 pound) largemouth bass was found in the pond.Black crappie were sampled at very low abundance levels (5 fish total) but were found to be of very good size.  Crappie averaged 9.25 inches in length (range 9.0 to 9.7 inches) and weighed 0.45 pounds each.Brown bullhead were the only rough fish species observed during test netting.  These fish were on the small side ranging between 6.8 and 11.6 inches long.  Average brown bullhead length was 8.4 inches, while average weight was just over 0.26 pounds </p>",
