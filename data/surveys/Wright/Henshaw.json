The watershed is 9,717 acres, mostly agricultural, and water quality is poor.  Henshaw Lake lies within the Clearwater River Watershed District and has been targeted by the district for phosphorous reduction.  Henshaw Lake has not been considered to be a \"fish lake\" and no fisheries management has taken place with the exception of bullhead removal by commercial fishermen. This brief survey was intended to determine fishery values of Henshaw Lake. <br> \n <br> \nOn September 12, 2006, six standard lake survey trap nets were set in Henshaw Lake.  The following day catches were dominated by black crappie (94.8/net) and bluegill (49.7/net).   Black bullhead (12.7/net) and pumpkinseed (10.0/net) were common.  Few brown bullhead and hybrid sunfish were captured, as well as four common carp (0.7/net).  <br> \n</p>",
