                "narrative": "<p>Shible is a shallow, 340 acre lake located in western Swift County.  Past surveys have characterized Shible as a waterfowl lake that also contained populations of bullhead and carp.  In recent years, high water has allowed fish passage into Shible Lake from Marsh Lake via Five Mile Creek and a system of drainage ditches.  The 2002 survey sampled 15 species of fish, including substantial populations of northern pike and yellow perch.  Due to its shallow nature, winterkill potential of Shible Lake is high and the long-term establishment of gamefish populations is unlikely.         Northern pike were abundant in 2002.  The gill net catch was over four times the expected range.  Growth rates were good.  All pike sampled belonged to the 2001 year class and ranged from 16-24 inches.           Yellow perch were moderately abundant and were within the expected range for similar lakes.  Perch ranged from 8-10 inches and were growing fast.  Young-of-year perch were also sampled in low numbers.  Poor survival of young perch is expected due to the high numbers of northern pike.     Pumpkinseed sunfish were also moderately abundant.  All pumpkinseeds sampled were small and would not be of much interest to anglers.  Three to four years of good growth and no winterkill would be necessary for pumpkinseeds to reach a desirable size.     Black bullhead were abundant but within the expected range.  The majority of bullhead were less than 6 inches and would not draw much angler interest.     Other species sampled included:  abundant carp, fathead minnows, green sunfish, and orangespotted sunfish, and low abundance of bigmouth buffalo, brassy minnow, golden shiner, hybrid sunfish, tadpole madtom and white sucker.     Management plans for Shible Lake include annual winter dissolved oxygen monitoring to evaluate winterkill potential and a fisheries population assessment in 2007.  Should winterkill appear likely, opening Shible Lake to liberalized fishing will also be considered.  </p>",

An unimproved boat access suitable for small, non-motorized watercraft exists in a DNR Wildlife Management Area on the southeast corner.  Shible Lake is best characterized as a waterfowl lake and fisheries surveys are infrequent.  It is 340 acres and has a maximum depth of eight feet.  Winterkills have been known to occur on a somewhat frequent basis.  Shible Lake connects to Marsh Lake via Five Mile Creek during periods of high flow.  This allows fish to migrate into Shible Lake and maintain populations.   <br> \n <br> \nThis 2018 survey was conducted to collect fish population data using gill nets, 0.75-inch trap nets and 0.25-inch trap nets.  These data can be compared to historical standard and targeted survey data from Shible Lake.  Ten fish species were caught during 2018, but walleyes were the only gamefish caught.  They were moderately abundant and ranged from 10.7 to 20.6 inches.  Young-of-year Walleyes were also caught.  They either resulted from natural reproduction or migrated from downstream water bodies.  Yellow Perch and Northern Pike were abundant in the last survey which occurred in 2002 but were not caught in 2018.  Black Bullheads, Brassy Minnows, Common Carp, Fathead Minnows, Green Sunfish and Orangespotted Sunfish were all abundant in 2018. <br> \n</p>",
