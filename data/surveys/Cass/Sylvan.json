                "narrative": "<p>Sylvan is an 800 acre lake with a maximum depth of 57 feet.  Two basins are present, connected by a shallow channel.  About 46% of the lake is less than 15 feet deep.  Soils in shallow water areas are primarily sand and gravel, with areas of larger rock present.  Soils in marshy areas are mostly muck.  In 1987 there were about 175 homes/cabins and one resort along the roughly 9.6 miles of shoreline.  A fairly diverse aquatic plant community is present even though development is rather high.  A healthy aquatic plant community is important in helping to maintain the diversity and balance of the fish community.  Emergent vegetation like bulrush is especially important because it often provides high quality spawning habitat for species like bass, sunfishes, crappies and perch.  Wild rice may provide spawning habitat for northern pike in shallow, marshy areas.Fish catches in 1993 were fairly similar to those seen in previous nettings dating back to 1956.  Northern pike were taken in average numbers compared to similar type lakes.  The abundance of northerns was higher than in 1987.  Of the six age classes sampled, 62% of the fish were from the 1990 year class.  Because many young fish were caught, average weight of northerns was only 1.3 lbs..  Growth rate was good.Walleyes were not stocked between 1985 and 1991.  The walleye catch in 1993 was 1.0/gillnet, low compared to similar type lakes, but within the historical catch range of 0.6-1.6/gillnet seen in previous nettings of Sylvan Lake.  Three year classes (1986-1988) were sampled and growth was good.Six age classes of largemouth bass were sampled and growth was good.  A local bass club tournament provided most of the bass sampled in 1993 (all were released alive after sampling).  Bluegills and black crappies were present in \"average\" numbers.  Growth of bluegills was slow but crappie growth was good.  Yellow perch were caught in \"average\" numbers, as were rock bass and pumpkinseeds.  Other species taken in the netting included bowfin (dogfish), burbot, white suckers and yellow bullheads.</p>",

OTC marked fingerlings were stocked in 2003 and 2005. A private stocking of non-OTC marked fingerlings took place in 2007.  The walleye gill net CPUE was 1.42/gill net. CPUE in previous years has ranged from 0.6/gill net (2007,1981) to 1.8/gill net (1998).  Size ranged from 7.4 to 31.1 inches, with a mean of 19.1 inches.  Every survey that has been done on Sylvan over the years has indicated a very low survival rate of stocked walleye, thus contributing little to the fishery.  Yellow perch CPUE was 1.42/gill net.  This was comparable to past surveys that also indicated very low perch populations. <br> \n <br> \nThe northern pike CPUE was 7.75/gill net.  This was within the range of previous net catches  of 0.2/gill net (1981) to 9.0/gill net (1993).  Size ranged from 9.9 to 39.1 inches, with 11% being 24.0 inches or greater.     <br> \n <br> \nThe black crappie CPUE of 1.8/gill net was within the range of past surveys of 0.2/gill net (1981) to 3.1/gillnet (2006).  Size ranged from 5.8 to 11.7 inches, with a mean of 8.5 inches.   <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Sylvan Lake is an 894 acre lake located in southern Cass County.  The primary management species are bluegill, black crappie, and walleye.  A special regulation (5 fish limit) for sunfish and crappies went into effect on March 1, 2005 to maintain and enhance the fishery for these species. <br> \n <br> \nThe bluegill catch rate was 6.6 per trap net, which is below average for Sylvan and lakes similar to Sylvan.  However, the average size was 6.1\" with fish up to 8.7\" sampled.  More than 35% were 7\" or larger.  The current regulation appears to have increased and is currently maintaining the quality bluegill fishery of Sylvan. <br> \n <br> \nThe black crappie catch rate was 1.3 per trap net, which is about average for lakes like Sylvan.  The average length of these fish was 8.2\".  When both gill net and trap net data is combined, nearly 37% were 9\" or larger.  The largest black crappie sampled was 12.2\".  The black crappie fishery also appears to be maintaining its' quality.  The future looks promising, as 63% were from the 2011 and 2012 year class. <br> \n <br> \nWalleyes are another species anglers may encounter, due to stocking efforts by the DNR as well as the lake association.  The catch rate was modest, at 0.9 per gill net.  The average size was respectable at 19.8\".  The largest walleye sampled was 23.1\". <br> \n <br> \nThe northern pike catch rate was 6.8 per gill net, which is slightly above average.  The average size was only 18.6\" although there were northern pike up to 34.6\" sampled.  Only 6% measured 24\" or larger.  Anglers are encouraged to keep smaller northern pike and release larger ones over 24\". <br> \n <br> \nSylvan is known as a good lake for largemouth bass.  The catch rate was average at 1.4 per gill net.  Their average length was 11.4\" with fish up to 14.9\" sampled.  Survey nets typically don't sample bass that well and there are anecdotal reports of larger bass in Sylvan Lake. <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species sampled during the assessment include black bullhead, brown bullhead, pumpkinseed, rock bass, white sucker, yellow bullhead, and yellow perch.   <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Sylvan is 803 acres in size and is located about two miles northeast of Pillager in southern Cass County.  Two basins are present, connected by a shallow channel.  A public access is located on the east side of the north basin of the lake.  The lake has a maximum depth of 57 feet and about 46% of the surface area is less than 15 feet deep.  Shallow water soils are primarily sand and gravel.  Areas of larger rock are also present.  Soils in marshy areas are mostly muck.  In 1987 there were about 175 homes/cabins and one resort located along the lake's 9.6 miles of shoreline.  A fairly diverse aquatic plant community is present even though development is rather high.  A healthy aquatic plant community is needed to help maintain a healthy natural system and to support a diverse and balanced fish community.  Emergent vegetation like bulrush is especially important because it often provides high quality spawning habitat for species like bass, sunfishes, crappies and perch.  Wild rice may provide suitable spawning habitat for northern pike in shallow, marshy areas.Fish catches in 1998 were fairly similar to those seen in previous nettings dating back to 1956.  Northern pike abundance rose between 1987 and 1993.  Since 1993, pike abundance has dropped to a catch rate similar to those seen in nettings up to 1987.  Pike numbers in 1998 were in the \"average\" category when compared to similar type lakes.  In '98, pike averaged 17 inches and 1.5 lbs., similar to values from '93.Walleye catch rates have historically been either \"low\" or have just edged into the \"average\" category when compared to similar type lakes.  Nettings have, typically, shown some survival of stocked fish and have also documented natural reproduction.  For example, the majority of walleyes caught in the 1998 summer netting were aged to years when fingerling stockings were done.  The majority of adult walleyes caught in 1998 spring sampling were from natural reproduction. The 1998 catch rate was in the \"average\" category.  Walleyes averaged 18 inches and 2.3 lbs. in the '98 summer netting.Largemouth bass abundance was in the \"high\" category when compared to past nettings and to similar type lakes.  As is common, most fish sampled in summer were fairly young and had good growth.  Spring sampling provided a better sample of adult bass.  Bass up to 19 inches long were captured and ten year classes were represented, including fish up to 13 years old.  Results were similar to those of a spring netting done in 1996.Bluegill abundance in '98 was lower than in previous nettings but remained in the \"average\" category when compared to similar type lakes.  Several year classes were present and growth was good.  About one-half of the fish were from the 1994 year class. Roughly 12% of the bluegills were 7.0 inches or longer in length.Black crappies were caught in numbers that were higher than in past nettings but that were in the \"average\" category when compared to similar type lakes.  Spring netting in 1996 and '98 showed seven year classes present and good growth.  Typically, crappie year class strength was rather variable.  For example, in 1998 the majority of crappies were at least 8 inches long but few were ten inches or more in length.  In '96, a higher proportion of the catch was made up of small (under 5\") fish and fish at least 10 inches long.</p>",

Sylvan Lake has a special regulation limiting the daily possession to five sunfish and five crappies.  The reduced daily limit began in 2005.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappies ranged in length from 4.7 to 12.5 inches.  Average length was 10.0 inches and 84% of the crappies measured 9 inches or longer.   <br> \n <br> \nBluegills ranged in length from 4.0 to 9.3 inches.  Average length was 7.1 inches and 55% of the bluegills measured 7 inches or longer.   <br> \n <br> \nThe five crappie and five sunfish daily limits have been successful in maintaining the quality panfish angling opportunities in Sylvan Lake.   <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Sylvan is an 803 acre lake located 2 miles northeast of Pillager in southern Cass County.  A long, shallow channel connects two distinct basins.  A public access is located on the east side of the north basin. It has a maximum depth of 57 feet and 46% of the lake is 15 feet deep or less.  The lake is heavily developed with 230 homes/cabins, a resort with 27 cabins, and a camp.  The south basin and the channel have considerably more emergent vegetation than the north basin, limiting some development.  The aquatic plant community consists of 34 species of which Illinois pondweed, a submerged species, was the most abundant.  Aquatic plants are important in providing food, cover, and spawning habitat for fish and other aquatic species.  The exotic plant purple loosestrife is also present on Sylvan.  Lakeshore owners should take measures to prevent this species from being spread to other lakes.  The shallow water substrate is predominately sand.Walleye have been stocked in Sylvan Lake since 1948 and it is currently part of a research study designed to evaluate different stocking methods.  The walleye catch rate was below average in 2004 when compared to similar lakes (0.7/gill net).  Average size was 20.2\" and 2.8 lbs.  Walleyes were also caught in trap nets in average numbers (0.4/trap net).  Size averaged 14.8\" and 1.3 lbs.  Combining fish from both nets showed average grow and 77% were 12\" or larger.  Fall electrofishing resulted in a walleye catch rate of 2.5/hr.  The average length was 12.8\" and three of the five fish were from the 2002 year class.  After combining all sampling methods, only 33% of the walleyes were from years in which walleyes were stocked.The northern pike catch rate was average (8.3/gill net).  The 2001 and 2002 year classes represented 63% of the catch with most of these fish measuring 14.5\" to 25.1\".  Average size was 19.5\" and 1.8 lbs.  These fish had average growth and 22% were 24\" or larger.The largemouth bass catch rate was average in gill nets (2.3/gill net) and average in trap nets (0.4/trap net).  Spring electrofishing resulted in a catch rate of 71.5/hr.  Average length of these fish was 11.8\" and 50% were 12\" or larger.  Growth was normal and the 1999 year class accounted for 36% of the catch. One smallmouth bass was also collected while electrofishing, measuring 14.1\". The black crappie catch rate was above average in trap nets (5.1/trap net) and average in gill nets (0.9/gill net).  Average length was 8.2\" in trap nets and 7.1\" in gill nets.  Combining both types of nets showed that 72% of the fish were from the 2001 year class.  Growth was normal and 42% were 8\" or larger.The bluegill catch rate was average (18.6/trap net).  Average length of these fish was 6.4\" and 38% were 7\" or larger.  Growth was slow and 49% of the fish were from the 1998 year class.The yellow perch catch rate was below average at only 1.7/gill net.  Average length was 7.6\" and 35% were 8\" or larger.  Growth was normal and 47% of the fish were from the 1999 year class.Other fish species captured included bowfin (dogfish), brown bullhead, burbot, hybrid sunfish, pumpkinseed sunfish, rock bass, white sucker, and yellow bullhead.</p>",

A nearshore survey was conducted to assess the populations of both game and non-game fish species.  Fourteen 100' long sampling stations were evenly spaced around the lakeshore.  Each station was then sampled by backpack electrofishing, and if conditions allowed with a 15' or 50' 1/8th inch seine. <br> \n <br> \nThe survey took place on July1st and July 16th, 2021, with all 14 stations sampled by backpack electrofishing.  The 50' 1/8th inch seine was used at 1 station and the 15' 1/8th inch seine was used at 8 stations.  Twenty species were sampled, including eight species that are intolerant of habitat disturbance: Burbot, Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Iowa Darter, Least Darter, Mimic Shiner, Rock Bass, and Smallmouth Bass.  This nearshore survey will be used along with the gill net and trap net survey conducted on June 14-18, 2021 to calculate a Fish-Based Index of Biotic Integrity (FIBI) score.  The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health by the types of fish species present and comparing it to what is expected for this type of lake. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Sylvan Lake is 803 acres and is located about two miles northeast of Pillager in southern Cass County.  Two distinct basins are present connected by a shallow channel.  A public access is located on the east side of the north basin.  Maximum depth is 57' and 46% of the lake is 15' deep or less.  Shallow water substrate is primarily sand and gravel though areas of larger rock are present as well.  The aquatic plant community is relatively diverse.  Emergent plants such as bulrush and water lilies are important for shoreline protection, maintaining water quality, and provide essential spawning habitat for bass and panfish species.  Submerged plants provide food and cover needed by fish and other aquatic species.Walleyes have been stocked periodically with the most intensive stocking from 1961-1984 as fingerlings.  Sylvan Lake is currently part of a statewide MN DNR walleye research study designed to evaluate different stocking methods.  The 2001 walleye catch of 1.6/gill net is similar to 1998, and average when compared to similar lakes.  Previous catches have ranged from 0.6 to 1.8/gill net.  Compared to 1998, average length and weight increased from 18.6\" and 2.3lbs to 20.3\" and 3.1lbs.Northern pike were sampled at a rate of 8.3/gill net, the second highest catch to date.  Previous catches ranged from 4.3 to 9.1/gill net.  Average length and weight increased from 18.3\" and 1.5lbs in 1998 to 19.9\" and 1.9lbs in 2001.  Fish tended to be smaller in the south basin.Yellow perch are an importent forage species for the lake's game fish.  Yellow perch abundance was below average for the second consecutive netting, at 2.0/gill net.  Previous catches have ranged from 2.0 to 13.5/gill net.</p>",

The reason for the survey is that Sylvan lake has experimental regulations on black crappie and bluegill.  The regulation went into effect on March 1, 2005. The regulation states no more than five of each species may be taken daily.  Eight trap nets were set for two nights to obtain size structure of these species. A total of 134 black crappie were captured, they ranged in size from 4.4 to 11.6 inches, with a mean of 9.3 inches. Forty-seven percent were 10.0 inches or greater. Bluegill numbers totaled 416 fish and ranged in size from 3.6 to 9.9 inches, with a mean size of 7.3 inches. Seventy-three percent were 7.0 inches or greater.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Sylvan Lake is an 894 acre lake located in southern Cass County.  The primary management species are Bluegill, Black Crappie, and Walleye.  A special regulation (5 fish limit) for sunfish and crappies went into effect on March 1, 2005, to maintain and enhance the fishery for these species.  The panfish seem to be benefitting from this protection, as the size of both Bluegills and Black Crappie was very good.  Average length of Black Crappies was 8.7\", with 47% at least 9\" in length and 6% at least 12\" in length.  Bluegill showed similar results, with an average length of 6.9\" and 63% measuring 7\" or larger. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike numbers and size were both impressive.  They were caught in the highest numbers to date (12.3/gill net) and 18% were over the 22-26\" protected slot.  Fish up to 37.5\" were measured. <br> \n <br> \nThe Largemouth Bass catch was above average for this type of lake (2.4/gill net).  Average length was 11.3\", with 48% measuring 12\" or larger and fish up to 15.7\" measured.  Survey nets typically don't sample bass that well and there are anecdotal reports of larger fish in Sylvan Lake. <br> \n <br> \nWalleyes are another species anglers may encounter, due to stocking efforts by the DNR as well as the lake association.  The catch rate in 2021 was low at 0.4/gill net, however, the average size was respectable at 19.9\".   <br> \n</p>",

The reduced daily limit began in 2005.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappies ranged in length from 4.9 to 13.3 inches.  Average length was 9.2 inches and 62% of the Crappies measured 9 inches or longer.   <br> \n <br> \nBluegills ranged in length from 4.0 to 9.3 inches.  Average length was 7.4 inches and 76% of the Bluegills measured 7 inches or longer.   <br> \n <br> \nThe five Crappie and five Sunfish daily limits have been successful in maintaining the quality panfish angling opportunities in Sylvan Lake.   <br> \n</p>",

White sucker, brown bullhead and walleye showed low populations.  The northern pike length-frequency ranged from 10-38 inches and age groups from 1 to 7 were all represented, although the 2 and 3 year age classes made up 60% of the fish aged.  Growth rates for all age classes appeared to be slow compared to state average growth rates.The bluegill length-frequency ranged from 3 to 10 inches with most of them in the 4 to 6 inch range.  All age and size groups indicated slow growth rates.One 2 year old smallmouth bass was taken in the nets, which shows they are present but it is not enough to draw any conclusions.Largemouth bass ranged in size from 6.5 to 12 inches and age classes for 2 to 5 were represented.  Growth rates were average for all age classes.Black crappies showed fast growth rates for all age classes.  Two to five year old fish were represented with 3 year old fish making up 70% of the fish aged.  Lengths ranged from 7 to 14 inches.Yellow perch from 3 to 8 years old were present and ranged in length from 5.5 to 11 inches.  Growth rates for perch were average.Walleye growth rates appeared to be slow and only 4 and 5 year olds were aged, other scales were impossible to age accurately.  Length-frequency ranged from 13 to 23 inches.</p>",
