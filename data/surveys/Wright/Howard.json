The gill net catch was 15.8 fish per net, above the range of expected values for lakes similar to Ann. Walleye in the combined trap net and gill net samples ranged in length from 5.0 to 26.9 inches, with an average length of 14.0 inches. Walleye in Ann Lake attain a length of 14.9 inches by age 4. \n\nBlack Crappie were caught at a rate of 15.8 per trap net, exceeding the average for similar lakes. Black Crappie in the combined gill net and trap net catches ranged from 5.5 to 9.4 inches, with 54% 7.0 inches or larger. The average length of Black Crappie was 7.3 inches. The Bluegill trap net catch (9.7 fish per net), was in the range of expected values for lakes similar to Ann. Bluegill in the sample ranged in length from 3.5 to 7.9 inches, and exhibited good growth rates with fish attaining a length of 3.6 inches by age 2. \n\nNorthern Pike were not abundant in net catches. Only three were caught. The Northern Pike in Ann Lake are probably the result of natural reproduction, as the last stocking took place in 1976. The young-of-year are likely the result of marginal reproduction in ditches upstream from Ann Lake. Trap net numbers for Black Bullhead, at 22.3 fish per net, were in the range of expected values for similar lakes, and gill net numbers (240 per net), were above the expected range.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Ann Lake is a popular fishing lake located three miles south of Howard Lake in Wright County. The 386-acre lake has a maximum depth of 18.5 feet and a ten year mean water clarity of 3.3 feet. High phosphorous concentrations result in nuisance algal blooms, large stands of curly-leaf pondweed and reduced water clarity. There is one public access located on the west side.  <br> \n <br> \nA targeted Bluegill assessment was conducted on Ann Lake from May 18 to May 20, 2016. This assessment was conducted to evaluate the size structure of the spawning Bluegills. A total of 166 Bluegills were sampled during this assessment and averaged 6.8 inches long with the largest measuring 9.0 inches. Fisheries biologists describe the size structure of a fish population using terms such as Proportional Stock Density (PSD) and Relative Stock Density (RSD). For Bluegill, PSD is the percentage of Bluegill larger than 3\" that are also larger than 6\". The PSD of Bluegill from Ann Lake was 70. So, 70% of the Bluegill sampled larger than 3\" were also larger than 6\". Similarly, RSD8 is the percentage of Bluegill larger than 3\" that are also larger than 8\". The RSD8 on Ann Lake was 24. These results are favorable when compared to other lakes in the Sauk Rapids management area.  <br> \n <br> \nThe average replacement time for an eight inch sunfish in central Minnesota is 5 to 8 years. Therefore anglers are encouraged to limit their harvest of larger Bluegill. Especially adult males which are more colorful during the spring time when they are in the process of spawning and are more easily exploited by anglers. The larger male Bluegills are important to maintaining a healthy size structure as they restrict reproduction of smaller males, allowing the smaller males to put more energy into growth and less into reproduction. Anglers can help to maintain good fishing for Bluegill on Ann Lake by selectively harvesting medium sized females and releasing larger males. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Ann, 386 acres, is a popular fishing lake located three miles south of Howard Lake, Wright County.  The lake is shallow (maximum depth 18.5 feet) and has a very large agricultural watershed (more than 20,000 acres).  High phosphorous concentrations result in algal blooms, excessive curled pondweed and reduced water clarity.\n\nSince the last survey in 1996 two significant events have occurred.  Extensive flooding in 2002 caused low levels of dissolved oxygen and a partial fish kill.  A wide range of fish species were impacted.  Then, in late winter 2006, a commercial fisherman removed 120,000 pounds of carp, 310 pounds per acre.\n\nLargemouth bass were captured by night electrofishing on the evening of May 2, 2006.  Only 13 fish were taken.  It may be that the electrofishing catch was affected by a four inch rainfall which caused water levels to rise.  Also, curled pondweed was becoming abundant and made capture of largemouth somewhat more difficult.  This effort was similar to electrofishing conducted in the spring of 2003 when largemouth bass were caught at a rate of 18.4 fish/hour. Largemouth bass in Ann Lake take five years to reach 12 inches.\n\nThe walleye catch (6.4/gill net) was significantly lower than 1996, but near the upper end of expected values for similar lakes.  Walleye ranged in length from 11-22 inches with an average length and weight of 16.8 inches and 1.7 pounds.  Multiple year classes were sampled during the survey and included fish stocked every year since the flood of 2002.  Walleye from Ann Lake reach 15 inches in three years.\n\nThe catch rate of northern pike (3.8/gill net) was similar to 1996 and within the range of expected values for similar lakes.  Northern pike ranged in length from 8-35 inches with an average length and weight of 22.8 inches and 2.9 pounds.  Northern pike from Ann Lake reach 24 inches in five years.  This is a moderate abundance level and should provide an excellent opportunity to catch an above-average size northern pike.\n\nThe catch of yellow perch was similar to 1996 and much higher than the average value for similar lakes.  Yellow perch ranged in length from 3-11 inches with an average length of 7.5 inches.  Some were of catchable size (>10 inches).  High yellow perch catches mean that forage is available for the fast growth of northern pike and walleye.\n\nAnglers can expect good fishing for both bluegill and black crappie.  The bluegill catch   (28.1/trap net) was much higher than in1996.  Bluegill ranged in length from 3-10 inches with an average length of six inches.  Multiple year classes were present indicating that reproduction has been consistent.  Bluegills from Ann Lake reach seven inches in four years.  The black crappie catch (46.1/trap net) was much higher than in 1996.  Black crappie ranged in length from 3-11 inches with an average length 7.2 inches.  Black crappies from Ann Lake reach eight inches in four years.\n\nBlack bullheads and carp were caught at low levels of abundance, which may reflect the recent removal efforts by a commercial fisherman.  Other species sampled during the survey included: bowfin, green sunfish, golden shiner, hybrid sunfish, Johnny darter, pumpkinseed sunfish, smallmouth buffalo, yellow bullhead and white sucker.</p>",

The 386-acre lake has a maximum depth of 18.5 feet and a ten-year mean water clarity of 3.3 feet. There is one public access located on the west side. <br> \n  <br> \nThe Walleye fishery of Ann Lake has been managed by stocking since the mid-1970s. Walleye fry were stocked every other year from the mid-1970s until 2012 with supplemental fingerling stocking on a contingency basis. After multiple failed fry stockings from 2003-2010, the primary stocking strategy changed to fingerling stocking (1lb./LA) every other fall starting in 2013. While DNR does not stock fry in the lake anymore, the lake association supplementally stocked Walleye fry on occasion. Most recently in 2016 and 2018. <br> \n <br> \nIn 2023, 303,000 surplus Walleye fry from the New London Fish Hatchery were stocked in Ann Lake as an experiment to see if a year class could be produced. Unfortunately, only three young of the year (YOY) Walleye were sampled, indicating that the fry stocking was not successful. Fingerling Walleye were then stocked in the fall of 2023 in accordance with the pre-established management plan. <br> \n</p>",

Northern Pike numbers were low at 1.3/gill net. Yellow Perch were also scarce at 1.6/gill net. Black Crappie were sampled in good numbers at 13.7/gill net. The Bluegill population was low at 2.7/trap net. Two Channel Catfish showed up in the nets. There is a large population of Black Bullhead (251/gill net). Common Carp were sampled at only 0.9/gill net. However, a commercial fisherman took out 17,800 pounds in one seine haul in 1985. The first regular Walleye fry stocking was done in 1975 and again in 1978,1980,1981 and 1984. This fry stocking has provided excellent walleye fishing.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Ann Lake, is a popular fishing lake located three miles south of Howard Lake in Wright County. The lake is shallow (maximum depth 18.5 feet) and has a very large agricultural watershed. High phosphorous concentrations result in nuisance algal blooms, large stands of curly-leaf pondweed and reduced water clarity. Ann Lake is primarily managed for Walleye with biennial fry stockings occurring from 1975 to 2012. However, in 2013 fingerling stocking was implemented after several fry stocking failures. A standard lake survey was conducted in August to monitor changes in the fishery from the last survey completed in 2006. In addition to the standard survey, a Bluegill assessment was conducted in May and an index of biotic integrity (IBI) survey  conducted in August. <br> \nThe Walleye catch was lower than 2006, but within the range of expected values for similar lakes. Walleye ranged in length from 13.0 to 23.9 inches with an average length of 17.1 inches. Six-year classes were sampled during the survey with the 2013 and 2014 year classes comprising 73% of the sample. Growth of Walleye was faster than the statewide average reaching 18 inches in three years. <br> \nThe catch rate of Northern Pike was significantly higher compared to previous surveys and well above the range of expected values for similar lakes. Northern Pike ranged in length from 17.7 to 32.3 inches with an average length of 22.9 inches. Thirty-four percent of Northern Pike sampled were greater than 24 inches. <br> \nAnglers are encouraged to harvest smaller pike (under 22 inches) and release the larger ones to help achieve a more balanced fish community and promote good growth rates. Lower pike numbers may also increase the survival of young Walleye and allow Yellow Perch numbers to increase. Higher perch populations are desirable as they are an important prey species for both Walleye and Northern Pike. <br> \nLargemouth Bass were sampled by day-time electrofishing on May 24, 2016. Fifty-one bass were sampled in 1.57 hours of effort for a catch rate of 32.4 fish/hr. This is below the average day-time catch rate for the Sauk Rapids area lakes (43.3), but well above the catch rates observed in 2006 and 2003. Largemouth Bass ranged in length from 4.2 to 19.6 inches with an average length of 10.8 inches. <br> \nThe catch of Yellow Perch was similar to the 2006 survey and above the expected range for similar lakes. Yellow Perch ranged in length from 5.1 to 9.6 inches with an average length of 7.1 inches. <br> \nAnglers can expect to find Bluegill and Black Crappies in good numbers. The catch of Bluegill was higher than reported in 2006, but within the range of expected values for similar lakes. Bluegill ranged in length from 3.4 to 9.1 inches with an average length of 5.1 inches.  <br> \nThe catch of Black Crappie was much lower than reported in 2006, but still within the expected range of values for similar lakes. Black Crappies ranged in length from 4.2 to 13.1 inches with an average length of 6.7 inches. <br> \nOther species sampled during the 2016 surveys include: Bigmouth Buffalo, Black Bullhead, Bowfin, Brown Bullhead, Common Carp, Golden Shiner, Green Sunfish, Hybrid Sunfish, White Sucker, and Yellow Bullhead. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Ann Lake is a 386 acre lake located 3 miles south of the city of Howard Lake. The maximum depth of the lake is 18 feet and even during late July, adequate oxygen is present down to the bottom of the lake. The public access for Ann Lake is located on the west side of the lake near the intersection of County Road 6 and 30. Ann Lake is located within 50 miles of the Twin Cities Metropolitan Area and therefore it receives a moderate amount of fishing pressure for a lake of its size. Black Crappie, Bluegill, Walleye and Northern Pike are all present in the lake. In the summer of 1996, a lake survey was conducted on Ann Lake.  The netting of the lake revealed the following information about the fish population.  The Northern Pike catch rate in gill nets (4.5/lift) significantly increased from the 1990 survey when no fish were caught. The catch rate of Northern Pike in gill nets was within expected levels for lakes that are similar to Ann Lake. The average size Northern Pike caught in gill nets weighed 2.6 pounds and was 22.0 inches long. The growth rate of Northern Pike was average when compared with lakes similar to Ann Lake. The gill net catch rate of Walleye in Ann Lake (14.8/gill net) was little changed from the last survey (15.8/gill net) and remained above expected levels for this lake type. Two to twelve year old fish were caught and the vast majority of walleye caught (94%) came from years when walleye fry were stocked. The average Walleye caught in gill nets was 2.2 pounds. The growth rate of Walleye in Ann Lake was average when compared with similar lakes.The gill net catch rate of Yellow Perch in Ann Lake (43.2/gill net) significantly increased from the last survey (2.4/gill net) and rose above expected levels for this lake type. The average size Yellow Perch caught in gill nets was 6.1 inches long and 0.1 pounds.  While this average size may seem small, Yellow Perch are very important in a lake as they are a major source of food for larger predators like Northern Pike and Walleye. The growth rate of Yellow Perch was fast when compared with lakes similar to Ann Lake. The trap net catch of Bluegill in Ann Lake (1.5/trap net) declined from the previous netting in 1990 (9.7/trap net) and fell below average levels for this lake type. The overall catch of fish in trap nets was low during the survey and this was due in part to lower water levels in the lake. The growth rate of Bluegill was average when compared with lakes similar to Ann Lake. The catch rate of Black Crappie in trap nets (0.7/trap net) dropped from the last survey (15.8/trap net) and fell below expected values for lakes similar to Ann. Catch rates of panfish in trap nets are highly dependent on weather and the quality of the net sets, therefore a change in catch rate like this may not mean a significant change in the fish population. The average size crappie caught was 8.1 inches and weighed 0.3 pounds. The growth rate of Black Crappie in Ann Lake was average when compared with similar lakes.  </p>",
