                "narrative": "<p>Okamanpeedan (Big Tuttle) is a 2,294 acre lake of which only 1,313 acres are in Minnesota.  The remaining 981 acres reside in Iowa.  The lake has a maximum depth of 6.5 feet, has 12.2 miles of shoreline and is located near the town of Ceylon in Martin County.  The lake is presently managed for northern pike primarily while yellow perch and white crappie are managed secondarily.  Since the lake is connected to the Des Moines River and fish have a way of re-establishing themselves, the lake is only stocked with northern pike in the event of a \"catastrophic\" winterkill.Northern pike catch rates were lower in 2005 than what we saw in 1998 and 1993.  Despite the lower catch rates, Okamanpeedan is still a popular northern pike lake for local anglers.  Only two northern pike were sampled in our trap nets which were 18.7 and 23.7 inches in length.Walleye catch rates were similar to what we saw in 1998.  Two walleye, which were 17.5 and 20.8 inches in length, were sampled in trap nets.  Several boats were observed during the assessment at the outlet throughout the survey.  According to angler interviews, \"nice\" walleye were being caught near the outlet above the dam.  Yellow perch catch rates were what we would expect for lakes similar to Okamanpeedan.  Yellow perch lengths ranged from 4.4 to 9.8 inches and averaged 6.8 inches.  Three different ages of yellow perch were observed during the survey.White crappie catch rates were also what we would expect for lakes similar to Okamanpeedan.  White crappie lengths ranged from 6.9 to 12.2 inches and averaged 8.7 inches.  Two ages of white crappie were observed during the survey of which a majority of the fish were two years old.  The white crappie population was in very good condition.Black crappie catch rates were lower than what we would expect in lakes similar to Okamanpeedan.  Black crappie lengths ranged from 6.9 to 8.2 inches and averaged 7.1 inches.  Two ages of black crappie were observed during the survey.Black bullhead catch rates were higher than what we would expect in lakes similar to Okamanpeedan.  Black bullhead lengths ranged from 6.3 to 8.2 inches and averaged 7.6 inches.Carp catch rates were also higher than what we would expect for lakes similar to Okamanpeedan.  Carp lengths ranged from 5.1 to 31.9 inches and averaged 19.8 inches.Bigmouth buffalo catch rates were what we would expect for lakes similar to Okamanpeedan.  Bigmouth buffalo lengths ranged fro 14.9 to 27.1 inches and averaged 19.7 inches.The only other species of fish caught in our nets in 2005 was orangespotted sunfish.To promote and maintain healthy fish populations, pollution and other inputs need to be controlled.  Fish habitats are directly affected by water quality.  Nutrient, sediment and other waste inputs can drastically alter the biological, chemical, and physical components of a lake.  It is paramount to maintain if not improve the current water quality of Okamanpeedan Lake through watershed management to preserve this fishery for future generations to enjoy.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Okamanpeedan or Big Tuttle as the lake is sometimes called, is a 2,200 acre lake near Ceylon, Minnesota.  The lake is on the Minnesota-Iowa border and of the 2,200 acres, 1,300 are on the Minnesota side.  Minnesota has the primary responsibility for fish management on the lake.  The lake is presently managed for northern pike as the primary species and yellow perch and black bullhead secondarily.The northern pike catch rate during the 1998 survey were similar to other lakes like Okamanpeedan.  There was no change in the catch rates from the last time it was surveyed in 1993.  Lengths of northern pike ranged from 14 to 24 inches and averaged about 20 inches.  The average weight of northern pike sampled was just under two pounds.  Three different ages of northern pike were observed during the survey.The yellow perch catch rate was high compared to lakes similar to Okamanpeedan.  The catch rate increased from 2.7 in 1993 to 32 fish per net in 1998.  Lengths of yellow perch ranged from 5 to 7 inches and averaged 6 inches.  The majority of the yellow perch sampled during the survey were age 2 and should provide excellent fishing opportunities over the next couple of years.Walleye are not managed for in Okamanpeedan because of frequent low oxygen levels during the winter months.  The walleye catch rate was good in 1998 compared to lakes similar to Okamanpeedan.  This is due in part to the Des Moines River which runs through the lake.  The walleye catch rate increased from 0.2 in 1993 to 14 in 1998.  Walleye lengths ranged from 9 to 24 inches and averaged about 16 inches.  The average weight of walleye sampled during the survey was just under two pounds.The white crappie catch rate was high compared to lakes similar to Okamanpeedan.  The white crappie catch rate increased from 0.5 in 1993 to 25.5 fish per net in 1998.  A strong hatch of white crappie occurred in 1996.  White crappie lengths ranged from 6 to 12.5 and averaged just over 8 inches.  The black bullhead catch rate was high compared to lakes similar to Okamanpeedan.  Black bullhead lengths ranged from 5 to 10 inches and averaged just over 8 inches.  The average weight of black bullhead was 0.2 pounds.To promote and maintain a healthy fish population, pollution and other inputs need to be controlled.  Fish habitat is directly affected by water quality.  Nutrient, sediment and other waste inputs can drastically alter the chemical and physical components of a lake.  It is paramount to maintain if not improve the current water quality of Okamanpeedan Lake through watershed management to preserve this fishery for future generations to enjoy.   </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Okamanpeedan Lake is a 2,294-acre lake located on the Iowa and Minnesota border in Martin County.  Fish management is shared by both Iowa and Minnesota and is classified as a border water entitling it to its own fish management regulations.  A list of those regulations are available in MN Inland Fishing Regulations book published by either state.  Approximately 1,313 acres are in Minnesota while the remaining 981 acres are in Iowa.  Okamanpeedan Lake is a natural reservoir of the East Fork of the Des Moines River. Okamanpeedan Lake has a maximum depth of 6.5 feet, over 12 miles of shoreline, and has a simple shoalwater substrate made up of sand, silt, and areas of rock and gravel along the shoreline.  Okamanpeedan Lake is managed primarily for Northern Pike and secondarily for White Crappie, Yellow Perch, and Walleye.  A standard survey was conducted the week of June 12, 2023, using three gill nets and 11 trap nets, to monitor fish populations in Okamanpeedan Lake.  <br> \n <br> \nIn the 1990's, Okamanpeedan consistently produced abundant Northern Pike populations.  In recent decades, Northern Pike have been scarce, and the trend continued in 2023, as only three Northern Pike were sampled. The gill net catch rate was 0.3 per gill net which is below the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (1.2 to 7.8 per gill net) and below the long-term average of 3.3 per gill net since 1993.  Lengths of the Northern Pike sampled were 18.4, 23.6, and 30.9 inches. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye catch rates in Okamanpeedan Lake have varied from 0.2 per gill net in 1993 to 14.0 per gill net in 1998 and have averaged 8.3 per gill net since 1993.  The 2023 Walleye catch rate was 13.7 per gill net which is within the expected range of catch rates for similar (3.2 to 15.3 per gill net).  Five- year classes of Walleye were sampled (2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, and 2022) of which the 2020 and 2021 year classes comprised 93 percent of the sample.  Okamanpeendan Lake was stocked with Walleye fry in 2018 and 2021 by the Iowa DNR.  The other year classes that were sampled were likely fish that moved upstream from the East Fork Des Moines River during high water, as that is stocked annually downstream of Okamanpeedan Lake by the Iowa DNR.  Lengths of Walleye sampled ranged from 8.3 to 21.5 inches and averaged 14.3 inches.  Okamanpeedan Lake has a good Walleye population and angling should be good for the next few years. <br> \n <br> \nOkamanpeedan Lake's Yellow Perch catch rates have varied from 2.7 per gill net in 1993 to 32.0 per gill net in 1998 and have averaged 16.5 per gill net since 1993.  The 2023 catch rate was 8.3 per gill net, below the long-term average of 16.5 per gill net, but within the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (3.0 to 22.5 per gill net).  Yellow Perch lengths ranged from 5.1 to 10.9 inches and averaged 9.4 inches. <br> \n <br> \nWhite Crappie catch rates have varied from 0.1 per trap net in 1993 to 25.5 per trap net in 1998 and have averaged 7.8 per tap net since 1993.  The 2023 White Crappie catch rate was 9.9 per trap net, exceeding the long-term average of 7.8 per trap net and is within the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (0.5 to 15.9 per trap net).  White Crappie lengths ranged from 4.5 to 11.6 inches and averaged 8.8 inches.  Only 16 percent of the White Crappie sampled exceeded 10.0 inches in length.  Black Crappie have not been present in Okamanpeedan Lake, except for one sampled in 2005.  In 2023, Black Crappie were caught at a rate of 3.3 per trap net indicating that their abundance may be increasing.  Lengths of Black Crappie ranged from 1.4 to 11.5 inches and averaged 6.8 inches.  Based on the length frequency histogram, it appears that there are at least six year classes of Black Crappie present in Okamanpeedan Lake, indicating that natural reproduction occurs annually. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Bullhead abundance remained below the long-term average of 50.3 per gill net, as the 2023 catch rate was 36.7 per gill net, within the expected rate of catch rates for similar lakes (4.6 to 83.0 per gill net).  Lengths of Black Bullhead ranged from 5.2 to 12.4 inches and averaged 10.0 inches.  The Channel Catfish catch rate decreased from 21.7 per gill net in 2017 to 5.7 per gill net in 2023.  Channel Catfish lengths ranged from 12.3 to 23.8 inches and averaged 20.2 inches.  Common Carp were sampled at a rate of 43.7 per gill net, which is the highest recorded catch rate on Okamanpeedan Lake and greatly exceeds the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (0.5 to 9.1 per gill net).  Most of the Common Carp were 16.0 to 20.0 inches in length and likely from one strong year class.  Other species sampled included Bigmouth Buffalo, Green Sunfish, Orangespotted Sunfish, Quillback, and White Sucker. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Okamanpeedan Lake, also known as Tuttle Lake or Big Tuttle Lake, is a 2,294 acre border water lake shared with Iowa.  A majority of the lake is within Minnesota (1,313 acres) while Iowa has 981 acres.  Okamanpeedan is a natural reservoir of the East Fork of the Des Moines River that is categorized as a Minnesota class 41 lake.  Class 41 lakes are relatively large and shallow and have simple shoreline characteristics.  Okamanpeedan Lake has a maximum depth of only 6.5 feet, over 12 miles of shoreline, and has a relatively simple substrate made up of sand and silt with some areas of rock and gravel along shore.  Okamanpeedan Lake is managed for Northern Pike, White Crappie, and Yellow Perch.  A gamefish survey was conducted June 5th to June 8th, 2017 with 3 gill nets and 12 trap nets to assess the management goals.  During the survey on Okamanpeedan water clarity was all the way to the bottom which is unusual for this lake.  It is possible water clarity may have impacted net catches.     <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nNORTHERN PIKE <br> \n <br> \nTen Northern Pike were sampled in gill nets and trap nets.  Northern Pike ranged in length from 23.5 to 26 inches in the gill nets with an average length of 25 inches and ranged in length from 12 to 31 inches in the trap nets with an average length of 19 inches.  Body condition of the fish in the gill net and trap net samples was average compared to other lakes.  Historically, Okamanpeedan Lake is one of the most consistent and best producers of Northern Pike in the Windom Area.  The gill net catch rate of 1.7 per net in 2017 is within the statewide normal range for class 41 lakes and above the Windom Area normal range for class 41 lakes.  However, catch rates of Northern Pike were higher pre-2000 and have since dropped.  Habitat degradation and potentially climate change may be resulting in less than optimal conditions for spring spawning runs, survival of eggs and fry, as well as increased summer water temperatures.  Northern Pike have only been stocked one time in 2001 when approximately 132,000 pike fry were stocked.  Additional stocking with Northern Pike fry may need to occur in the future if population levels continue to decline.  Currently, catch rates indicate a population that is at adequate levels and no stocking is needed.  The population will continue to be monitored and ice-out trap netting may be a good way to assess the Northern Pike population.         <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nWHITE CRAPPIE <br> \n <br> \nThirty-five White Crappie were caught in gill nets and trap nets.  Gill nets are not indicative of White Crappie abundance, but the catch rate of 3 per gill net is what we expect for lakes similar to Okamanpeedan.  The trap net catch rate was 2.2 per net, also within the normal range for class 41 lakes, and above the 2005 catch rate of 1.5 per trap net but less than the long term catch rate average of 7.3 per trap net.  The abundance of the White Crappie population appears to be down from historical levels, but what we would expect for Okamanpeedan Lake.  The size of White Crappie is excellent with fish ranging in length from 5 to 11 inches in gill nets and 5 to 12 inches in trap nets with an average of 8 inches in each.  White Crappie are currently doing well in Okamanpeedan Lake.        <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nYELLOW PERCH   <br> \n <br> \nSeventy-three Yellow Perch were caught in gill nets and trap nets.  Gill nets are the best indicator of Yellow Perch abundance, and a catch rate of 23 per gill net indicates a population that is high when compared to other lakes like Okamanpeedan.  In addition, the size structure of Yellow Perch in the sample was excellent.  Yellow Perch ranged in length from 6 to 11 inches in gill nets and trap nets with an average length of just over 9 inches.  The condition of Yellow Perch was above average.  Yellow Perch are self-sustaining in Okamanpeedan with the last stocking done nearly 30 years ago in 1990.   <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nOTHER SPECIES <br> \n <br> \nOther non-managed species caught in the 2017 gill net and trap net samples were Bigmouth Buffalo, Black Bullhead, Common Carp, Channel Catfish, Green Sunfish, Quillback Carpsucker, Walleye, White Sucker, and Yellow Bullhead.  All species caught in gill nets were within their normal catch range except for White Sucker; White Sucker were above their normal range.  All species caught in trap nets were also within their normal catch range except for White Sucker and Yellow Bullhead which were less than their normal catch range.   <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nSPECIES OF INTEREST <br> \n <br> \nTwo species of interest in Okamanpeedan Lake are Channel Catfish and Walleye.  Channel Catfish have never been stocked into Okamanpeedan Lake proper yet they maintain a self-sustaining population.  However, Clear Lake upstream of Okamanpeedan was stocked with Channel Catfish in 1995 and 2005 and could have been the initial source of these fish.  The size of the Channel Catfish in the sample ranged from 7.5 to 26 inches with a mean length of 17 inches in gill nets and 22 inches in trap nets.  Walleye were only stocked one time in 2001 by the Iowa DNR with approximately 45,000 Walleye.   Genetic analysis was done on the population in 2014 with fish caught in a commercial seining operation due to interest in determining if the Walleye were a result of natural reproduction or if they may be coming from an upstream stocking like Channel Catfish.  It was determined that the fish match a native strain not stocked by the Minnesota DNR and most likely were descendants from the Iowa DNR stocking.  Walleye fishing on Okamanpeedan can be very good at times.  During the 2017 survey there was constant fishing pressure with many boats catching limits of Walleye using lures trolled with planar boards.  Iowa DNR has interest in continuing to stock Okamanpeedan Lake in the future, and their genetic strain is the best match for the lake.  Therefore, future stocking of Walleye on Okamanpeedan Lake will be contingent upon Iowa DNR stocking.  However, even without stocking the population has done well since the last stocking in 2001. <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nPrepared by Nate Hodgins <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Okamanpeedan has historically been a good northern pike fishery.  The Minnesota DNR (Fisheries) manages northern pike in Okamanpeedan because they are more tolerant of low oxygen than many other species.  The northern pike population is above the level the DNR has targeted and is doing quite well.  Northern pike lengths ranged from 13 to 38 inches.  As long as the northern pike continue to have access to the sloughs, lakes and river connected to it (Desmoines river, Clayton, Bright, Pierce), the population should continue to do well.   During the 1993 survey of Okamanpeedan, the yellow perch population was at a low level.  Yellow perch populations in our shallow prairie lakes tend to fluctuate greatly.  For example, in a local lake, we sampled less than 10 yellow perch in 1991  but over 400 in 1993.  The increase in yellow perch was mainly due to one strong year class.  If the right spring weather conditions and adequate spawning habitat (fallen trees, branches, vegetation) are present, the yellow perch population should produce a strong year class.  Then in about three to four years there would be good perch fishing.   If you like to fish for bullheads, Okamanpeedan has plenty to offer.  Black bullhead in Okamanpeedan are not real large (up to 10 inches) but they are abundant.  You may even catch some yellow bullhead.  We sampled some yellow bullhead up to 13 inches.</p>",
