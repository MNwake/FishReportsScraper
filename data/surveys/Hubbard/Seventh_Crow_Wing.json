                "narrative": "<p>Seventh Crow Wing Lake (29-0091-00) is a 260.62-acre lake with a maximum depth of 42 feet located two miles southeast of Nevis, MN.  Park Rapids Fisheries staff conducted a survey targeting near shore fish species on July 29, 2019 to assess populations of non-game and small sport fish.  Ten 100-foot sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake shore, sampling a variety of habitat types.  Each site was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot 1/8th-inch mesh seine, depending on habitat conditions.   <br> \n <br> \nDuring this assessment, no sites were sampled with a 50-foot seine and seven sites were sampled with a 15-foot seine. Site conditions prevented the use of seines at three sites.  Backpack electrofishing was done at all 10 sites, several of which were conducted from the side of the boat.  Nearshore sampling captured sixteen species of fish including two species intolerant of disturbance; Banded Killifish and Pugnose Shiner.  Other species sampled during the nearshore effort included Black Crappie, Bluegill, Bluntnose Minnow, Brook Stickleback, Common Shiner, Hybrid Sunfish, Iowa Darter, Johnny Darter, Largemouth Bass, Least Darter, Logperch, Rock Bass, White Sucker, and Yellow Perch.  Nearshore catches will be used along with gill net and trap net catch data from a standard fisheries survey conducted on July 29, 2019, to calculate a fish-based Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) score, which is indicative of the health of Seventh Crow Wing Lake.   <br> \n <br> \nThis survey is contributing to a watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.  Seventh Crow Wing Lake is located in the Crow Wing River Watershed.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Seventh Crow Wing is located two miles south of Nevis in Hubbard County.  Seventh Crow Wing has a surface area of 254 acres and a maximum depth of 40 feet.  There is no public access on the lake; however, there is a county-owned access on the outlet channel (Crow Wing River), west of County Road #13.  This is an undeveloped access that is only suitable for small or carry-in boats.  Seventh Crow Wing provides fishing opportunities for walleye, northern pike, largemouth bass, and panfish. <br> \n <br> \nThe Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics.  Seventh Crow Wing is in lake class 31.  Other area lakes in this same classification include: Second, Fifth, Sixth, and Eighth Crow Wing Lakes, Duck, Hinds, and Lower Twin.  <br> \n <br> \nPresent and past surveys have shown Seventh Crow Wing to support a good walleye population in both numbers and sizes of fish.   Walleye abundance (7.8 walleye/gillnet) was above the range \"typical\" for this lake class and similar to past surveys.  Sampled walleye had an average length and weight of 19.1 inches and 2.4 pounds, with fish measured up to 26.5 inches.  Seventh Crow Wing is stocked with walleye fingerlings during odd numbered years.  Yellow perch, an important forage species for walleye, were sampled in low numbers compared to past surveys.  The yellow perch in Seventh Crow Wing are small in size with few fish an acceptable size for angling. <br> \n <br> \nPresent and past surveys have shown that Seventh Crow Wing is able to maintain a low to moderate northern pike population composed of moderate to quality sized fish.  The northern pike catch rate of 3.0 pike/gillnet is below the range \"typical\" for this lake class, but similar to past surveys.  Because numbers are low, Seventh Crow Wing is able to produce some large pike due to the combination of good forage supply of tullibee (cisco) and white sucker and fast growth rates. <br> \n <br> \nSeventh Crow Wing supports good populations of panfish and largemouth bass.  Anglers will find good numbers of bluegill in the 6-8 inch range and black crappie in the 9-11 inch range.  Good largemouth bass habitat of submerged and emergent aquatic vegetation is found in Seventh Crow Wing. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled included moderate numbers of rock bass and bowfin (dogfish) and low numbers of yellow bullhead, brown bullhead, and golden shiners. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Walleye gillnet catch rates (7.33 fish/set and 12.75 lbs/set in 1992) have increased from a low year in 1971 to rise above the third quartile for lake class 31.  Mean weight of individual walleye in 1992 was 1.74 lbs.  The present PSD (43), RSD-P (16) and RSD-M (7) indicate a stable size structure with good proportions of the population reaching preferred and memorable lengths.  Good growth rates contribute to the maintenance of large-sized walleye populations.  Mean length at age 5 is 17.09 inches.  Some natural reproduction or migration from other Crow Wing Lakes is occurring in 7th Crow Wing Lake, as evidenced by the 1988 year class, which accounted for 24% of the sampled walleye.Gillnet catch rates of northern pike (1.67 fish/set and 5.82 lbs/set) were below the first quartile for lakes in class 31.  1971 was the only other year surveyed in which northern pike catch rates were low (2.25 fish/gillnet).  Mean weight of individual northern pike in 1992 was 3.48 lbs.  The size structure (PSD=60, RSD-P=20, RSD-M=10) is indicative of a stable population with good proportions reaching preferred and memorable lengths.  Northern pike exhibit fast growth, averaging 18.68 inches at age 3.  However, growth rates vary among year classes.  Northern pike recruitment has been low and inconsistent the past 5 years.  Sixty percent of the sampled fish were age 3.Pumpkinseed, bluegill and black crappie trapnet catches were within the normal range for this class of lakes.  Bluegill and black crappie abundances have generally been within the normal ranges since 1962; however, pumpkinseed density was above the third quartile until 1987.  The size structure of bluegill (PSD=32) is small.  Bluegill growth rates are slightly slow (mean length at age 4=5.33 inches) and contribute to the poor size structure.  No pumpkinseed or black crappie reach preferred length either; however, large proportions of these two species are of quality length (pumpkinseed PSD=73, black crappie PSD=100).  Black crappie exhibit better respective growth rates than bluegill, averaging 8.48 inches at age 4.  Catches of largemouth bass and yellow perch were above the third quartile in 1992 and commonly have been since 1962.  The high density of yellow perch is reflected in a very small size structure (PSD=3).  Largemouth bass exhibit better growth rates and a larger size structure (PSD=46, RSD-P=23, RSD-M=15) than the other panfish species.  Largemouth bass average 12.15 inches at age 4.  Rock bass catches were also above the third quartile in 1992 for the first time since 1962.Bowfin, white sucker and the three bullhead species catch rates were all within the normal ranges for lakes in class 31.  Tullibee catches were below the first quartile and golden shiner catches were above the third quartile.  None of these non-game species have shown a significant density fluctuation over the past 30 years.  The  high 11.00 tullibee/gillnet in 1971 is the result of incorporating special tullibee netting results in with the regular lake survey gillnet samples.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Seventh Crow Wing is located two miles south of Nevis in Hubbard County.  Seventh Crow Wing has a surface area of 254 acres and a maximum depth of 40 feet.  There is no public access on the lake, however, there is a county-owned access on the outlet channel (Crow Wing River), west of county road #13.  This is an undeveloped access that is only suitable for small or carry-in boats.  The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical and chemical characteristics.  Seventh Crow Wing is in lake class 31.  Other area lakes in this same classification include: Second, Fifth, Sixth, and Eighth Crow Wing lakes, Duck, Hinds, and Lower Twin.  Seventh Crow Wing provides fishing opportunities for walleye, northern pike, largemouth bass, and panfish.Walleye were sampled in high numbers (13.5 walleye/gillnet), above the management goal of 7.0 walleye/net and well above the range \"typical\" for this lake class.  Walleye abundance in past has generally been near or above the management goal.  Good numbers of walleye in the 16-18 inch size range were sampled.  The walleye population in Seventh Crow Wing is being maintained by a combination of natural reproduction and stocking by the DNR.  Seventh Crow Wing is stocked with walleye fingerlings in odd numbered years.  Yellow perch, an important forage species for walleye, were sampled in good numbers.  The yellow perch in Seventh Crow Wing are small in size with few fish an acceptable size for angling.  Present and past surveys have shown that Seventh Crow Wing is able to maintain a low to moderate northern pike population composed of moderate to quality sized fish.  The northern pike gillnet catch of 1.0 pike/gillnet is below the range \"typical\" for this lake class, but similar to past surveys.  While numbers are low, Seventh Crow Wing is able to produce some large pike due to the combination of a good food supply of white sucker and tullibee (cisco) and fast growth rates.Seventh Crow Wing supports good populations of panfish and largemouth bass.  Anglers will find good numbers of bluegill in the 6-8 inch range and black crappie in the 9-11 inch range.  Good largemouth bass habitat of submerged and emergent aquatic vegetation is found in Seventh Crow Wing.Other species sampled included high numbers of white sucker and bowfin (dogfish) and moderate numbers of pumpkinseed and rock bass.  Brown bullhead, yellow bullhead, golden shiner, and green sunfish were sampled in low numbers.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Seventh Crow Wing Lake is located two miles southeast of Nevis in southern Hubbard County.  Seventh Crow Wing is part of a chain of lakes running from Eleventh Crow Wing Lake at the headwaters, down to First Crow Wing Lake.  Seventh Crow Wing Lake has a surface area of 261 acres and a maximum depth of 42 feet.  A DNR-owned public access is located on the southeast shore of Seventh Crow Wing Lake, off of Elk Haven Drive.  This access is a carry in access only, and winter access is limited because of springs keeping water open through the winter. <br> \n <br> \nThe Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics.  Seventh Crow Wing Lake is in Lake Class 31.  Class 31 lakes generally have very hard water, and regularly shaped shorelines.  Other class 31 lakes in the Park Rapids area include: Second, Fifth, and Sixth Crow Wings, Boulder, Duck, Evergreen, Hattie, Hinds, Shingobee, Tripp and Lower Twin. <br> \n <br> \nWalleyes were sampled in good numbers, and a good size for anglers with an average length of 17.5 inches.  Walleyes ranged from 15 to 21.5 inches.  Yellow Perch, an important forage species for both Walleye and Northern Pike were sampled in good numbers.  Most perch were 5 - 8 inches, with just a few over 8 inches. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers can expect to find good numbers of Northern Pike in Seventh Crow Wing Lake.  Northern Pike had an average length and weight of 23 inches and 2.8 pounds, with fish measured up to 37.5 inches. <br> \n <br> \nSpring sampling showed good numbers of Largemouth Bass. They had an average length of 12 inches, with fish sampled up to 17 inches. <br> \n <br> \nSeventh Crow Wing Lake supports healthy panfish populations and can provide good fishing for Black Crappie and Bluegill.  Black Crappie were sampled in moderate numbers compared to other local lakes.  They had an average size of 7.5 inches, with crappies sampled up to 13 inches.  Bluegills were sampled in good numbers. The majority sampled were 3.5 - 7.5 inches, but anglers will find larger Bluegill, up to and over 9 inches. <br> \n <br> \nNo aquatic invasive species (AIS) have been identified in Seventh Crow Wing Lake.  To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Seventh Crow Wing Lake is located in southern Hubbard County, two miles south of Nevis.  Seventh Crow Wing has a surface area of 254 acres and a maximum depth of 40 feet.  There is no public access on the lake, however, there is a county-owned access on the outlet channel (Crow Wing River), west of County road #13.  This is an undeveloped access that is only suitable for launching small boats.  Public boating access is also available from Sixth Crow Wing Lake upstream to Seventh Crow Wing.  Private access is available from a resort located on the southwest shore of Seventh Crow Wing.  The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical and chemical characteristics.  Seventh Crow Wing is in lake class 31.  Other area lakes in this same class include: Second, Fifth, Sixth, and Eighth Crow Wing Lakes, Duck Lake (southern Hubbard County), Hinds (5 miles south of Park Rapids), Hattie (located 6 miles northwest of Lake George), and Lower Twin (northern Wadena County).Walleye were sampled in high numbers (9.5/gillnet), above the range typical for lake class 31.  With the exception of 1971 (2.3/net), Seventh Crow Wing has always had a moderate to high walleye abundance with gillnet catch rates ranging from 5.5/net (1984) to 11.0/net (1962).  Sampled walleye were quality-size with an average length and weight of 17.8 inches and 2.0 pounds.  Sampled walleye ranged in length from 11.7 to 26.3 inches.  Walleye growth rates in Seventh Crow Wing were slow compared to other class 31 lakes.  Strong walleye year classes corresponded to years of walleye stocking.  Evaluation of walleye stocking success or natural reproduction has been difficult due to different stocking schedules on different lakes in the Crow Wing chain, migration of walleye between lakes, and natural reproduction.  Starting in 1995, all Crow Wing chain of lakes that receive walleye stockings (including Seventh Crow Wing), were put on the same schedule of walleye fingerlings stocked in odd calendar years.  This should allow for better evaluation of walleye stocking success and natural reproduction.   Present and past surveys have shown that Seventh Crow Wing is able to maintain a low to moderate density northern pike population composed of moderate to quality-sized fish.  The northern pike gillnet catch rate of 2.3/net is below the range typical for lake class 31, but similar to past surveys. Historical gillnet catch rates have ranged from 1.7/net (1992) to 5.8/net (1987).  Northern pike up to 34.1 inches were sampled.  Northern pike growth rates were above other class 31 lakes.The yellow perch gillnet catch rate of 9.8/net is within the range typical for lake class 31.  Historical yellow perch gillnet catch rates have been higher, ranging from 18.8/net (1979) to 116.7/net (1962).  Yellow perch had an average length of 6.2 inches with fish measured up to 9.8 inches.  The yellow perch population in Seventh Crow Wing provide a forage base for the walleye and northern pike.  The yellow perch are generally too small to interest anglers. Bluegill were sampled in low numbers (4.6/trapnet), below the range typical for lake class 31.  Historical bluegill trapnet catch rates have been higher.  The previous survey in 1992 had a catch rate of 50.9/net, while historical trapnet catch rates have ranged from 13.0/net (1971) to 72.0/net (1979).  Sampled bluegill had an average length of 5.9 inches, however, larger fish are present with bluegill measured up to 8.7 inches.Black crappie were sampled in low numbers (1.8/gillnet, 0.2/trapnet).  Black crappie catch rates were similar from the 1979 to 1997 surveys, while catch rates were higher in 1971 (5.3/gillnet) and 1962 (9.0/gillnet).  Black crappie up to 7.8 inches were measured.Largemouth bass were sampled in both gillnets and trapnets in numbers typical for class 31 lakes.  Largemouth bass growth rates were similar to other class 31 lakes.  Standard survey gear (gillnets and trapnets) are not effective methods to assess largemouth bass abundance or size distribution.  To adequately assess a largemouth bass population special sampling such as spring electrofishing needs to be conducted.  No electrofishing has been conducted on Seventh Crow Wing.  Seventh Crow Wing has good water quality, bottom substrate, and aquatic vegetation that will help insure a healthy largemouth bass population.Yellow, brown, and black bullhead are present in Seventh Crow Wing, with yellow bullhead being the more abundant of the three species.  Yellow bullhead were sampled in low numbers (0.5/gillnet), lower than previous surveys.  One brown and one black bullhead were sampled, similar to past surveys.White sucker were sampled in high numbers (7.2/gillnet), above the range typical for lake class 31.  Tullibee (cisco) are also present and were sampled at 6.7/gillnet.  Tullibee provide an additional forage base for the larger walleye and northern pike present in Seventh Crow Wing.Anglers can help maintain or improve the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest allows for the harvest of abundant smaller fish for table fare, but encourages release of medium to large-size fish.  Releasing these fish will help maintain the fish population in Seventh Crow Wing and provides anglers with opportunities to catch more and larger fish in the future.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Seventh Crow Wing is located two miles south of Nevis in Hubbard County.  Seventh Crow Wing has a surface area of 260.5 acres and a maximum depth of 40 feet.  There is currently no public access on the lake; however, there is a county owned access on the outlet (Crow Wing River), west of County Road #13.  This is an undeveloped access that is only suitable for small or carry-in boats.  Seventh Crow Wing provides fishing opportunities for Walleye, Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, and Panfish. <br> \n <br> \nThe Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical and chemical characteristics.  Seventh Crow Wing is in lake class 31.  Other area lakes in this same classification include: Second, Fifth, Sixth, Seventh, and Eighth Crow Wing lakes, Duck, Hinds, and Lower Twin. <br> \n <br> \nSurveys have shown Seventh Crow Wing to support a good Walleye population in both numbers and size of fish.  Walleye abundance (10.8 walleye/gillnet) was similar to recent surveys.  Sampled Walleye had an average length and weight of 16.1 inches and 1.50 pounds, with fish measured up to 25.4 inches.  Seventh Crow Wing is stocked with Walleye fingerlings during odd numbered years.  Yellow Perch, an important forage species for Walleye, were sampled in moderate numbers, within the range typical for this lake class.  The Yellow Perch in Seventh Crow Wing are small in size with few fish an acceptable size for angling. <br> \n <br> \nPresent and past surveys have shown Seventh Crow Wing is able to support a low to moderate Northern Pike population composed of moderate to quality sized fish.  Northern Pike numbers were up from recent surveys, but within the range \"typical\" for this lake class. Because numbers are low, Seventh Crow Wing is able to produce some large Northern Pike due to the combination of good forage supply of Tullibee (Cisco) and White Sucker and good growth rates.   <br> \n <br> \nSeventh Crow Wing supports good populations of Panfish and Largemouth Bass.  Anglers will find good numbers of Bluegill and Pumpkinseed in the 6-8 inch size range and Black Crappie in the 9-11 inch range.  Largemouth Bass were sampled in moderate numbers when compared with other lakes in the Crow Wing chain.  Seventh Crow Wing has good water quality, submerged and emergent vegetation that provides excellent habitat for Largemouth Bass and Panfish.   <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled included moderate numbers of Rock Bass, Bowfin (Dogfish), Yellow Bullhead, Golden Shiner, and Hybrid Sunfish.  Brown bullhead and Green Sunfish were sampled in low numbers. <br> \n <br> \nCurrently no aquatic invasive species (AIS) have been identified in Seventh Crow Wing. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",
