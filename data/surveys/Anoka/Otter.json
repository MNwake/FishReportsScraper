                "narrative": "<p>The species composition and size structure of the fish population in Otter Lake is indicative of a body of water that periodically winterkills. Restocking after these events hasn\u0019t been necessary due to the connecting channel to Bald Eagle Lake. An aeration system has been installed and is operated by Ramsey County Public Works as needed to prevent extensive winterkills of fish. Net catches during this assessment indicate that no significant winterkill has occurred in this lake since the winter of 2000/2001. Northern Pike (NOP) were sampled above median levels for abundance and mean weight in gill nets. The 15.5 fish/set in 2007 is the second highest gill net catch rate of NOP ever recorded for this lake (39.0/set in 1997). The average size NOP captured was approximately 21.8 inches and 2.4 pounds. Over 18 percent of sampled NOP measured 26.0 inches or larger. Bluegill (BLG) were sampled with the highest catch rate in trap nets ever recorded for this lake (95.0 fish/set). The average size of BLG sampled was 5.4 inches in length and 0.11 pounds (9.17 fish/lb). Only 1.9 percent of sampled BLG measured 7.0 inches or longer. Black Crappie (BLC) were sampled below median levels for abundance with the average fish captured being 7.3 inches and 0.22 pounds. Few Largemouth Bass (LMB) were captured, but all measured over 12 inches in length. Black Bullhead (BLB) abundance appears to be increasing, but only one fish was captured that measured more than 9.5 inches in length.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>The species composition and size structure of the fish population of Otter Lake is indicitive of a body of water that experiences periodic winterkills. Restocking after these events hasn't been necessary due to the connecting channel to Bald Eagle Lake. Northern Pike and Black Bullhead were the two species sampled in the highest abundance during this survey. Northern Pike (NOP) were readily sampled in both gill and trap nets. The size range of gill net sampled NOP ranged from 10.0 to 35.1 inches, with the average size being 19.2 inches in length. Over 30% off all gill net sampled Northern Pike were 24.0 inches or longer. Otter Lake has historically functioned as a natural Northern Pike spawning area. Net catches during this survey indicate the presence of a very strong 2001 year class of NOP. Black Bullhead (BLB) were sampled in the highest abundance of any fish species during this survey. However, the average length for sampled BLB was less than 8.0 inches. Bluegill (BLG) were sampled in low abundance and very few active spawning were observed. Two size groups of BLG were observed in the catch. The larger size group averaged 7.4 inches and 0.40 pounds. Only 3 Black Crappie were sampled during this survey, with the largest measuring 10.24 inches. Small Largemouth Bass were observed in the shallow water around much of the lake, but the only individuals sampled were some young-of-year averaging 2.88 inches.</p>",

The lack of deep water habitat has resulted in this lake being historically susceptible to winter kills. An aeration system was installed in 2002 and is operated by Ramsey County. The fishery is primarily managed for Northern Pike and Bluegill. Although regular stockings do not occur, adult Largemouth Bass have been stocked on occasion and several stockings of Walleye fry have been conducted in the last decade. </p>",

Restocking after these events has not been necessary due to the connecting channel to Bald Eagle Lake.  An aeration system has been installed and is operated by Ramsey County Public Works as needed to prevent extensive winterkills of fish.  Northern Pike (NOP) were sampled above the median level for abundance in gill nets.  The 16.50 fish/set in 2013 is the second highest gill net catch rate of NOP ever recorded for this lake (39.0 fish/set in 1997).  The average size NOP captured was approximately 17.26 inches and 1.42 pounds. Over 12 percent of sampled NOP measured 26.0 inches or larger.  Bluegills (BLG) were sampled above the median level for abundance in trap nets.  The average size of BLG sampled in trap nets was 7.03 inches and 0.34 pounds. Approximately 63 percent of BLG captured measured 7 inches or longer.  Two Black Crappies (BLC) were captured during the sampling and measured 5.6 and 8.5 inches.  Only one Largemouth Bass (LMB) was captured during this assessment and measured 7.36 inches.</p>",

The 1997 netting shows that northern pike, black bullhead, and bluegill are the most abundant fish.  Boat access, parking space for ten vehicles, is available at the county park in the southwest corner of the lake.  Dense submerged vegetaion typically is matted on the surface over most of the lake by mid-summer.Northern pike abundance was much higher in 1997, than any previous surveys.  There were two dominant size groups of northern pike - one about 12 inches long and one about 20 inches. No fish were over 30 inches, but 25% were over 20 inches.  Neascus (black spot) was found in half of the northern pike examined.  Bluegill numbers were low, but fish were large.  Average length was over 6 inches in the trap nets and 7.5 inches in the gillnets, and nearly two thirds of the fish were over 7 inches.  Pumpkinseed and hybrid sunfish were present in low to moderate numbers, but average size was less than 6 inches.  Bowfin are also present in low numbers, and 60% are over 24 inches.  Black bullhead numbers were down compared to past surveys - average length was 8 inches.  </p>",
