Average length for a combined gear type sample was 9.6 inches, and maximum length sampled was 14.3 inches.  Age classes 3-8 were sampled, and growth rate was slow.  Bluegill and pumpkinseed were sampled at levels comparable to other lakes of this type.  Average length for bluegill sampled was 6.6 inches, and for pumpkinseed sampled was 5.3 inches.  Maximum length for bluegill sampled was 9.5 inches.  Bluegill age classes 3-7 were sampled, and 4 year old fish made up 52 percent of the sample.  Rock bass were sampled at levels comparable to other lakes of this type, and average length was 7.4 inches.  Cisco, white sucker, and yellow perch were also sampled.  Northern pike have been sampled historically, but were not sampled in this assessment.   </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Winchester is a 360-acre lake located in St. Louis County approximately 12 miles east of Orr.  Winchester is relatively deep (50 feet) with sharply sloping dropoffs and tannin-stained waters typical of Canadian Shield lakes.  Only about 15% of the lake is less than 15 feet deep and aquatic vegetation is limited to a few shallow bays.  The shoreline of Winchester Lake is rugged and heavily forested.  Very little development exists on the lake however, development has increased recently with the sale of a large land holding.  Public access is carry-in only.\n\nWinchester Lake is managed for its lake trout fishery.  Plans to establish lake trout called for annual stocking from 2005 through 2009. Follow the first five years, stocking will be completed every other year.\n\nThe introductory stocking was successful in establishing an abundant lake trout population in Winchester Lake.  Lake trout gillnet abundance (13.00/net) during this survey was the second highest in the International Falls Management Area.  Lake trout from 8.0 to 20.6 inches were caught during the survey and the average length was 14.1 inches.  The average weight was 1.07 pounds.  All of the trout caught had fin clips indicating that they were stocked.  Although aging the catch was not possible, it appears as if several year-classes are present.  Several of the fish captured were mature and, if they could find suitable habitat, likely spawned during the fall of 2009.\n\nCisco appear to be the primary forage species in Winchester Lake.  Cisco abundance (55.00/net) was the highest recorded for Winchester Lake.  Cisco averaged about eight inches in length making them ideal forage for trout and other predatory species.\n\nBluegill were the only other species of notable abundance in Winchester Lake.  The trapnet catch rate of bluegill (14.78/net) was the highest recorded for Winchester and was the second highest in the International Falls Management Area.  Bluegill ranged from 4.9 to 8.7 inches and averaged 6.9 inches.  Nearly 10% of the bluegill caught exceeded seven inches in length.\n\nFew additional species were present in the catch.  Very low numbers of smallmouth bass, northern pike, rock bass and yellow perch were also sampled. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Winchester Lake is a 320 acre lake located approximately 12 miles east of Orr, MN. This lake has a maximum depth of 50 feet with steep drop-offs. There is a small amount of vegetation as only about 17% of the lake is less than 15 feet deep. Winchester has very little development and activity is limited as access is via a carry-in public access on the east end of the lake. <br> \n <br> \nWinchester is managed primarily for Lake Trout, which have been stocked since 2005. A healthy population has been established with multiple year classes present. Lake Trout from all gears used ranged from about 12 to 27 inches in length, and averaged 19.6 inches. Catch rates were among the highest in the International Falls Management Area. Angling for Lake Trout should also be good in years to come as several stocked year classes have had good survival, and the 2012 year class appears to be strong.  <br> \n <br> \nCisco appear to be abundant, and are likely the primary forage species for Lake Trout in Winchester. Other species sampled in low abundance included Rock Bass, Smallmouth Bass, White Sucker, and Yellow Perch.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Winchester Lake is a 360 acre, class 5 lake, located approximately 12 miles east of Orr.  The lake is pristine and remote, with very little development.  A carry-in access on the north side of the lake was used during the population assessment.  A variety of fish species were present in 2001.       Illegal fish introductions seem to occur in Winchester Lake and new species have been documented in each of the last three fisheries investigations.  One black crappie (5.6 inches) and one walleye (19.1 inches) were caught in 2001, this was the first time these species have been documented during a fisheries investigation in Winchester Lake.      Bluegills were first documented in our previous investigation in 1994.  Trap net abundance has increased from 7.44 fish/set in 1994 to 12.44 fish/set in 2001.  Total length at age-4 was 6.4 inches, which was higher than the area average of 5.7.  The mean weight of bluegills captured in trap nets was high when compared to similar lakes.  A total of seven year-classes were present in the trap nets and age ranged from 3-10 years.  Total length ranged from 4.5-9.4 inches and the average was 6.6.       Abundance of pumpkinseed sunfish in trap nets has increased in each survey since they were first documented in Winchester Lake in 1984.  Also, abundance of rock bass in trap nets has increased and is the highest ever recorded.  The cisco population has increase dramatically and abundance is ten times greater than the previous record high.       Smallmouth bass, which have been captured previously in trap and gill nets, were not captured using these gear types in 2001.  Thus, it appears that smallmouth bass may have decreased in adundance.  Three smallmouth bass were captured by angling (2.23 fish/angler hour).  The mean length was 8.9 inches and all fish were six years old.  Growth was much slower than the area average.  In the past, anglers reported good smallmouth fishing in Winchester Lake.       White sucker abundance in 2001 was the highest ever recorded in trap nets and the second highest ever recorded in gill nets for Winchester Lake.  However, number of fish per gill net set was equal to other lakes of this type.       Yellow perch were also captured in 2001, but as in previous investigations, abundance was very low.  One northern pike was captured in each of the first two investigations (1974 and 1984), however, they have been absent in the two most recent investigations.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Winchester is a 319 acre lake in St. Louis County located approximately 12 miles east of Orr, Minnesota. Winchester has a maximum depth of 50 feet with steep drop-offs and tannin-stained waters typical of Canadian Shield lakes. Approximately 17% of the lake is less than 15 feet deep and aquatic vegetation is limited to a few shallow bays. The shoreline of Winchester Lake is rugged and heavily forested. Very little development exists on the lake. The public access is carry-in only. A fisheries survey was completed in 2019 as part of a regularly scheduled rotation of surveys in the International Falls Management Area.  <br> \n <br> \nWinchester Lake is primarily managed for Lake Trout. Stocking occurred annually from 2005 to 2009 and every other year thereafter. The initial stocking events established a fairly robust population, but catch rates have been declining since that first survey following introduction. Lake Trout are still present, but survival of more recent stocked year classes appears to be low. The size structure is mostly made up of recently stocked fish less than 13 inches in length and older fish from the 2006 to 2009 stocked year classes that are now reaching lengths of 28 inches. There does not appear to be any natural reproduction taking place in Winchester.  <br> \n <br> \nThere are very few Northern Pike present in Winchester Lake. This low density population in a lake with cool water and abundant Cisco to forage allows for some impressive growth and maximum size. Three Northern Pike were sampled in 2019, measuring 34.0, 41.5, and 42.6 inches in length.  <br> \n <br> \nBass are not typically sampled very well with traditional netting gear. Several Smallmouth Bass were still caught in the nets during the 2019 survey. Lengths ranged from about 12 to 19 inches, indicating that there is a good size structure. Similar to other predators like Lake Trout and Northern Pike, Smallmouth Bass in lakes with an abundant population of small Cisco can utilize this forage to attain impressive sizes.  <br> \n <br> \nCisco appear to be the primary forage species in Winchester Lake. Cisco are abundant, and appear to be of the dwarf variety.  <br> \n <br> \nOther fish sampled in low numbers during this survey included Bluegill, Rock Bass, White Sucker, and Yellow Perch.  <br> \n</p>",
