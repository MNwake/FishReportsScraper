The catches of largemouth bass and walleye were near the local median catch rates.  The walleye sample consisted of ages I and III.  Largemouth bass were ages I and II.  Both species exhibited fast growth rates.  Other species present were carp, black bullhead, pumpkinseed, and black crappie.  Carp and black bullhead were not abundant.  Black bullhead were much less abundant than previous nettings.  Channel catfish, stocked in 1987, did not appear in the sample.</p>",

The average size bluegill measured was 6 inches and more than 28% were larger than 7 inches. Only one black crappie was sampled during the survey. Although they were not sampled effectively in the survey, angler have reported successfully catching crappies. Pumpkinseed sunfish are present in the lake in average numbers. Northern pike numbers are down from previous years but are still considered high when compared to similar lakes. The average length northern pike is approximately 20 inches. Yellow bullhead were found to be abundant in East Moore Lake. Their average size is small. Black bullhead were low in abundance and also below what many anglers consider to be acceptable.      </p>",

Moore Lake Park (City of Fridley) borders approximately half of the shoreline and provides numerous amenities including a swimming beach, playground, picnic area, walking path, and fishing pier.  The sport fish community consists of Black Crappie, Bluegill, Pumpkinseed and Hybrid Sunfish, Largemouth Bass and Northern Pike.  East Moore is aerated year round.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike and Largemouth Bass populations were present in varying numbers.  Northern Pike were sampled in above average relative abundance (13.0/gill net) for lakes similar to East Moore. The Largemouth Bass population is average when compared to prior surveys.  Panfish numbers were within normal ranges when compared to other similar lakes in Minnesota.  Of the 51 trapnet caught Bluegills, 10 and 19 % of fish sampled were above 7.0 and 6.5 inches, respectively. Growth rates were below average with the majority of the population primarily consisting of slow growing (based on statewide averages) age 3 fish. Other sunfish species were sampled in varying numbers. Three Hybrid Sunfish averaging 4.37 inches and 43 Pumpkinseed Sunfish averaging 5.17 inches were sampled with trap nets.  Pumpkinseed relative abundance was average for East Moore Lake. Two age-3 and one age-4 Black Crappie were sampled during this assessment. Other fish observed during this survey but sampled in low abundance were, one Common Carp and seven Black Bullhead. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>East Moore Lake is a heavily vegetated 27-acre, class 40 lake located at Highway 65 and Interstate 694 in Fridley.  Moore Lake Park (City of Fridley) borders approximately half of the shoreline and provides numerous amenities including a swimming beach, playground, picnic area, walking path, and fishing pier.  The sport fish community consists of black crappie, bluegill, hybrid sunfish, largemouth bass, northern pike, pumpkinseed sunfish, and yellow perch.  East Moore is aerated year round and is stocked with approximately 1300 yearling channel catfish every year.  No channel catfish were sampled during this assessment.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike and largemouth bass populations were relatively young and present in varying numbers.  Northern pike were sampled at the lowest level (6.0/gill net) since 1995.  The pike population is relatively young with 80% of the aged fish being 2 and 3 year old fish.  Similarly, the largemouth bass population primarily consisted of age-1 fish.  Dense vegetation during the assessment may have limited bass sampling efficiency.     <br> \n <br> \nPanfish numbers were within normal ranges when compared to other similar lakes in Minnesota.  Of the 58 trap-net caught bluegills, approximately 53 and 74% of fish sampled were above 7.0 and 6.5 inches, respectively.  The majority of the bluegill population primarily consisted of fast growing age-4 fish.   One age-2 black crappie was sampled during assessment.  Yellow perch sampled in gill net averaged 5.7 inches while the two perch sampled in trap nets averaged 7.2 inches. Two hybrid sunfish averaging 7.7 inches and seven pumpkinseed sunfish averaging 4.7 inches were sampled with trap nets.     <br> \n <br> \nCommon carp and black bullheads numbers were sampled within the normal ranges of Minnesota class 40 lakes.   Yellow bullheads sampled in trap nets averaged 9.8 inches and were present in above average numbers.     <br> \n</p>",
