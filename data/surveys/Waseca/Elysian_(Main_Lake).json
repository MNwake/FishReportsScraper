NORTHERNS WERE REPRESENTED BY AGES 1-4 WITH 2 AND 3 YEAR OLDS MOST NUMEROUS. NORTHERNS HAVE BEEN MARKED AS PART OF A STUDY AND CREEL CENSUS; 12 OF THE 121 NORTHERNS CAPTURED WERE MARKED. AGE-GROWTH ANALYSIS INDICATES FAST GROWTH FOR NORTHERN PIKE. WALLEYE CATCH RATES DECLINED FROM 8.17/GILL NET IN 1985 TO 4.71/GILL NET IN 1988. LENGTH FREQUENCY DISTRIBUTIONS SHOW LITTLE CHANGE FROM THE 1985 NETTING. WALLEYES NETTED ARE REPRESENTED BY AGES 2-8 SIMILAR TO THE 1985 NETTING. WITH THE CONTIN- UED ANNUAL STOCKING OF WALLEYES IT IS UNKNOWN IF NATURAL REPRODUCTION IS OCCURRING. THREE OF THE 83 WALLEYES CAPTURED WERE TAGGED. THE BLACK CRAPPIE CATCH RATE IS RELATIVELY LOW FOR SIMILAR LAKE TYPES, AND FEW CRAPPIE ARE CAUGHT BY ANGLERS. CATCH RATES SHOW LITTLE CHANGE, AVERAGING 12.90 TRAPNET IN 1988 COMPARED TO 10.00/TRAP NET IN 1985. BLACK CRAPPIES SAMPLED WERE DOMINATED BY 2 YEAR OLDS WITH FEWER 3 AND 5 YEAR OLDS PRESENT. GROWTH FOR BLACK CRAPPIES WAS FAST. WHITE CRAPPIE REMAIN RELATIVELY LOW IN ABUNDANCE AVERAGING 0.20/TRAP NET COMPARED TO 1.33/TRAP NET IN THE 1985 NETTING. BLUEGILL REMAIN IN LOW ABUNDANCE, AVERAGING 3.30/ TRAP NET COMPARED TO 3.33/ TRAP NET IN 1985. BLUEGILLS WERE REPRESENTED BY AGES 3, 4, 5, AND 8 WITH 3 AND 4 YEAR OLDS DOMINATING. PUMPKINSEEDS REMAIN LOW ABUNDANCE, AVERAGING 0.70/ TRAP NET COMPARED TO 0.83/TRAP NET IN 1985. YELLOW PERCH HAVE SHOWN A NOTABLE DECLINE FROM 14. 33/ GILL NET IN 1985 TO 3.64/GILL NET IN 1988. YELLOW PERCH WERE REPRESENTED BY AGES 1-4 WITH 2 AND 3 YEAR OLDS MOST NUMEROUS. YELLOW PERCH IN 1985 HAD A GREATER DISTRIBUTION WITH AGES 1-6 SAMPLED AND 1-3 YEAR OLDS MOST NUMEROUS. WHITE BASS ANGLING WAS GOOD PRIOR TO THE PARTIAL WINTERKILL WHICH KILLED MANY WHITE AND LARGEMOUTH BASS. THE WHITE BASS NET CATCH REMAINS LOW AVERAG- ING 0.14/GILL NET COMPARED TO 0.83/GILL NET IN 1985. LARGEMOUTH BASS WERE FIRST SAMPLED IN '88 WITH THREE FISH CAPTURED IN NETTING. YOUNG-OF-YEAR BASS WERE COMMON IN SHORELINE SEINING. BASS ARE COMMON- LY CAUGHT BY ANGLERS, AND IT APPEARS LARGEMOUTH BASS WERE INTRODUCED IN RECENT YEARS. BLACK BULLHEADS WERE TAKEN IN EXTREMELY HIGH NUMBERS, AVERAGING 472.50/GILL NET AND 242.00/ TRAP NET. BULLHEADS WERE LOW IN ABUNDANCE IN 1985 AVERAGING 39.83/GILL NET AND 24.67/TRAPNET. THE LENGTH FREQUENCY DISTRIBUTION INDICATES A SINGLE DOMINATE AGE CLASS PRESENT WITH FEW OLDER FISH PRESENT. BULLHEADS ARE SMALL 1/7#, AND OF LITTLE INTEREST TO ANGLERS. WHITE SUCKERS INCREASED FROM 1.67/GILL NET IN 1985 TO 7.93/GILL NET IN 1988. OTHER SPECIES SAMPLED IN RELATIVELY LOW ABUNDANCE INCLUDE CARP AND YELLOW BULLHEAD.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A fishery survey was conducted in late June 2001 to monitor the fish community in Lake Elysian.  Elysian has a history of winterkill and low oxygen levels in the winter of 2000 - 2001 resulted in winterkill conditions.  The abundance of fish in 2001 appeared to be low.  Few fish were caught in both gill nets and trap nets.  The low oxygen conditions appeared to essentially eliminate walleye from Lake Elysian.  Walleye fry were stocked in spring 2001 and should provide a good walleye population in a few years.  Some northern pike up to 35 inches were caught in the survey.  The lake has been aerated since 1977.  While still subject to occasional winterkill, quality walleye fishing does occur on Lake Elysian, most recently in the early to mid 1990's.  The relatively low fish abundance in 2001 may allow for greater than normal walleye survival and growth and could result in a return to a quality walleye fishery in a few years.  About 75% of the watershed is agricultural which contributes to the high nutrient levels and abundant blue-green algae.  </p>",

In 1991, bluegill and black crappie were stocked at elevated rates in attempts to establish a viable population.  Bluegill are currently more abundant than average, and many fish as large as 7-8 inches are present.  Black crappie abundance is average, and most of them are 7-8 inches long.  Netting shows walleye abundance to be well above average, most fish 12-15 inches.  Walleye angling has also been good.  An extremely high number of black bullhead live in Lake Elysian.  All sizes are present, but 6 inch fish predominate. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Elysian Lake in Waseca County is a 1,902 acre lake stretched between the cities of Elysian and Janesville. A DNR owned public access is located on the north end of the lake, off Highway 60. Two county owned public accesses are located on the north end of the lake, off Waseca County Road 3, and in the county park on the south end of the lake. Elysian Lake is aerated in the winter time; ice anglers should pay attention to aeration warning and thin ice signs. Elysian Lake was surveyed the week of June 28, 2010 to monitor the fish community. <br> \n <br> \nThe primary management species in Elysian Lake is walleye. Elysian has been operated as a \"boom and bust\" fishery through the years; when strong winterkills strike the large and shallow lake, subsequent walleye fry stocking is generally very successful and fish growth is fast. Within a matter of a few years, the lake may have an abundant walleye population that brings about seasons of exceptional angling.  <br> \n <br> \nThe 2010 assessment returned 5.9 walleye per gill net lift, down from the post-winterkill boom of 51 per gill net in 2005. Gill net walleyes averaged 17.2 inches and 2.0 pounds. Walleye length ranged from 4.8 to 23.9 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike abundance has declined since the 2005 assessment. Following a strong winterkill in 2003-2004, northern pike fry stocking in 2004 resulted in historic highs of 25 pike per gill net in the 2005 assessment. In the 2010 assessment, pike abundance dropped to 1.8 pike per gill net lift, although the size structure shows more mature fish in the population. Pike ranged from 13.4 to 38.5 inches.  Anecdotal angler reports have included fish slightly above and below 40 inches, which corroborates with springtime wild broodstock trap net catches. Elysian lake has been used as a northern pike egg source for annual northern pike fry stocking.  <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie abundance has trended upwards since the 2005 assessment. Black crappie increased from two fish caught in the entire 2005 assessment to 290 fish caught in the 2010 assessment. Black crappies averaged 7.5 inches across all gears. One 12.2 inch specimen was captured.  <br> \n <br> \nJust like black crappie, white crappies have come on strong since the 2005 assessment. No white crappie were caught in the 2005 assessment, and 98 were caught in 2010. 5.9 white crappies were caught per trap net lift, and white crappies averaged 8.2 inches. White crappie length varied from 6.7 to 10.5 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nFour bluegills were caught in the 2005 assessment and 211 were caught in 2010. Bluegills ranged between 3.5 and 8.2 inches, with the average size being 6 inches. Bluegills may be faring better as microhabitats with aquatic vegetation become available; presumably curlyleaf pondweed may be getting established in some places on the lake. An assessment with plant survey is scheduled for 2015.  <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass, not observed in 2005, were caught in trap nets in 2010. Bass are best sampled using active sampling gears (i.e. electrofishing) but can be caught in small numbers in turbid waters like Elysian in trap nets. Largemouth bass are not well suited to shallow, murky and winterkill prone lakes like Elysian, but will likely maintain a low level of abundance. <br> \n <br> \nCommon carp represent the most abundant and largest biomass component of Elysian Lake. Carp sampled in 2010 fit into a narrow range of sizes representing the 2004 year class. 97 percent of gill netted carp were between 12 and 16 inches in length. The 2004 year class is very slow growing, most likely due to intraspecific competition. The 2004 year class has grown approximately 3 inches in 3 years.  <br> \n <br> \nAlso observed in the survey were bigmouth buffalo, black bullhead, bowfin (dogfish), fathead minnow, golden shiner, johnny darter, spottail shiner, white sucker, yellow bullhead, and yellow perch. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers can help maintain or improve the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest. Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for table fare, but encourages release of medium- to large-sized fish. Releasing these fish can help maintain balance in the fish community in Elysian Lake and provide anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future.  <br> \n <br> \nShoreline areas on the land and into the shallow water provide essential habitat for fish and wildlife that live in or near Minnesota's lakes. Overdeveloped shorelines cannot support the fish, wildlife, and clean water that are associated with natural undeveloped lakes. Shoreline habitat consists of aquatic plants, woody plants, and natural lake bottom soils.  <br> \n <br> \nPlants in the water and at the water's edge provide habitat, prevent erosion, and absorb excess nutrients. Shrubs, trees, and woody debris such as fallen trees or limbs provide good habitat both above and below the water and should be left in place. By leaving a buffer strip of natural vegetation along the shoreline, property owners can reduce erosion, help maintain water quality, and provide habitat and travel corridors for wildlife.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Elysian Lake is a 1,902 acre lake located in Waseca County stretching between the towns of Elysian and Janesville. Two DNR-operated public accesses are available for use; one on the north end of the lake near MN Highway 60 and another on the south end of the lake adjacent to Lakeview Park. A county-operated public access is located on the northeast side of the lake off Waseca County Road 3. Elysian Lake is a large, windswept lake with an average depth of 7 feet and a maximum depth of 13 feet. Based on limnological variables and lake characteristics, Elysian Lake is placed in Lake Class 41. Other lakes in this classification include Cannon Lake (Rice County), Albert Lea Lake (Freeborn County), and Upper Sakatah Lake (Le Sueur County). Elysian Lake is managed primarily for Walleye and Northern Pike and secondarily for Black Crappie, Bluegill, and Largemouth Bass. The base stocking plan for Elysian Lake includes stocking Walleye fry every other year at a rate of 1,000 fish/acre and stocking Northern Pike fry annually into tributaries of the lake. Elysian Lake is prone to periodic winterkills, after which game fish, such as Walleye, Northern Pike, Black Crappie, Bluegill, Yellow Perch, and Largemouth Bass are stocked to boost the depleted fishery. Elysian Lake was surveyed the week of June 29, 2015 by the MN DNR as part of a regular monitoring program. This survey included deploying six gill nets and twelve trap nets to assess the fish community, as well as recording water quality parameters. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye <br> \nThe Walleye population in Elysian Lake was decimated by winterkill in 2014, after which Walleye fry were stocked to rebuild the population. Typical of a fish population recovering from a winterkill, catch rates were relatively high in 2015. The Walleye catch rate was 18.5 fish/gill net, which was greater than the long-term average for Elysian Lake (14.0 fish/gill net). The last time Walleye catch rates were this high was in 2005 (51.0 fish/gill net), which was one year after a winterkill. Despite the high abundance of Walleye in the 2015 survey, the size structure was small. Walleye lengths ranged from 6.8 to 8.6 inches and averaged 7.6 inches, all of which were age-1 (2014 year class). The average length of age-1 Walleye from lakes in Lake Class 41 is 10.2 inches, suggesting that the Walleye in Elysian Lake were growing relatively slow. Walleye fry were stocked in spring of 2014 and 2015 and are scheduled to be stocked again in spring of 2016.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike <br> \nThe 2015 gill net catch rate of Northern Pike was 0.5 fish/gill net, which was the lowest catch rate since 1992 (0.5 fish/gill net) and was less than the long-term average for Elysian Lake (6.3 fish/gill net). Large year classes of Northern Pike in Elysian Lake have historically only existed immediately after a hard winterkill.  The total length of Northern Pike sampled from gill nets and trap nets ranged from 9.6 to 33.9 inches and averaged 21.6 inches. Despite annual stocking of Northern Pike fry in tributaries of Elysian Lake, Northern Pike abundance has remained relatively low except in years immediately following severe winterkills.  <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie <br> \nBlack Crappie were apparently unaffected by the partial winterkill in 2014, as they were the most abundant fish species observed in the 2015 survey. The trap net catch rate was 35.7 fish/net, which was the greatest catch rate ever recorded on Elysian Lake and was significantly greater than the long-term average for Elysian Lake (6.7 fish/trap net). The total length of Black Crappie ranged from 4.4 to 12.5 inches. However, 71% of all Black Crappie measured between 8.0 and 9.5 inches. While larger individuals were limited in the population, there was a very high abundance of harvestable Black Crappie. Black Crappies are not stocked in Elysian Lake, so the population persists exclusively through natural reproduction.  <br> \n <br> \nWhite Crappie <br> \nWhite Crappies were also present in Elysian Lake and were sampled at a rate of 3.3 fish/trap net in 2015. This catch rate decreased from the last survey completed in 2010 (5.9 fish/trap net). White Crappies were similar in length to Black Crappies, averaging about 8.6 inches from all gears. Like Black Crappie in Elysian Lake, White Crappies were present as a result of natural reproduction. White Crappie can be distinguished from Black Crappie by the presence of dark vertical stripes on the side of the body of White Crappie. Also, White Crappies usually have five or six dorsal spines, compared to seven or eight dorsal spines on Black Crappie.  <br> \n <br> \n? <br> \nBluegill <br> \nBluegill were sampled at a rate of 2.7 fish/trap net in 2015, which was down from the last survey completed in 2010 (13.2 fish/trap net). Bluegill abundance has been highly variable throughout the past 30 years, ranging from 0.2 fish/trap net in 2001 to 18.5 fish/trap net in 1993. Although many factors play a role in the year class strength of Bluegill, sporadic natural recruitment and periodic winterkills in Elysian Lake most likely influence the abundance variability. The total length of Bluegills sampled in 2015 averaged 6.7 inches and ranged from 2.9 to 8.9 inches. Ages attained from scale samples of Bluegills resulted in numerous year classes present. Mean length was 3.6 inches at age-1, 6.4 inches at age-2, 7.0 inches at age-3, and 8.4 inches at ages 4 and 5. Bluegills are not stocked in Elysian Lake and are present from natural reproduction.  <br> \n <br> \nBlack Bullhead <br> \nThe Black Bullhead catch rate was 12.5 fish/gill net, which was less than the long-term average for Elysian Lake (74.1 fish/gill net). Throughout the past 30 years, Black Bullhead abundance has generally decreased in Elysian Lake and other lakes in the area. For example, the average catch rate in Elysian Lake from 1985 to 2000 was 113.6 fish/gill net, compared to 29.1 fish/gill net from 2001 to 2015. The average length of Black Bullheads from trap and gill nets in 2015 was 8.8 inches, with the largest individual measuring 11.1 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nOther Species <br> \nCommon Carp were sampled at a rate of 21.0 fish/gill net, which decreased from the 2010 survey (42.3 fish/gill net) and was less than the long-term average for Elysian Lake (47.3 fish/gill net). The highest abundance of Common Carp in Elysian Lake was in 1995, when the catch rate was 201.0 fish/gill net. Common Carp from all gears averaged 15.9 inches in 2015. Other fish species sampled throughout the survey included Yellow Perch (N = 5), Bigmouth Buffalo (N = 70), White sucker (N = 5), Largemouth Bass (N = 2), Yellow Bullhead (N = 2), and hybrid sunfish (N = 1). <br> \n <br> \nAngling Summary <br> \nThe big story of the 2015 Elysian Lake survey was the Black Crappie catch rate, which was the highest ever recorded. Most of these fish were of harvestable size at the time of the survey, so anglers should waste no time trying to take advantage of the high abundance. Walleye angling should start to pick up soon when the strong 2014 year class grows into harvestable size. Walleye fry were also stocked in 2015 and will be stocked next in the spring of 2016.  <br> \n <br> \nAnglers can play an important role in maintaining or improving a fish population by practicing selective harvest. Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for consumption, while encouraging the release of medium to large fish that may contribute to natural reproduction. This practice helps maintain balance in the fish populations and provides anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future. Additionally, smaller fish often taste better and have fewer contaminants than larger, older fish from the same water body. <br> \n <br> \nShoreline property owners also play an important role in the overall health of an aquatic ecosystem, including the fish population. Natural shorelines, including vegetation, woody debris, and bottom substrates, provide valuable habitat for fish and wildlife, help maintain water quality, and reduce bank erosion. Cattails and bulrushes are particularly beneficial for fish spawning, rearing, and feeding. By leaving natural shorelines unaltered or restoring them to natural conditions, shoreline property owners are doing their part to maintain or improve a healthy ecosystem in the lake and protect the resource for future generations. <br> \n <br> \n-Kip Rounds, Fisheries Specialist <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Elysian Lake is a 1,902-acre lake located between the towns of Elysian and Janesville in Waseca County. Two DNR-operated public accesses area available for use; one on the north end of the lake just off MN Highway 60 and another on the south end of the lake adjacent to Lakeview Park. An additional, county-operated access is located on the northeast side of the lake off East Elysian Road. A public fishing pier is available on the south side of the lake near the Lakeview Park access. Elysian Lake is a large, windswept lake with an average depth of 7 feet and a maximum depth of 13 feet. Elysian Lake is considered eutrophic and is characterized by high nutrient levels, poor water clarity, frequent algal blooms, and periodic winterkills despite an aeration system that operated annually until 2016. Elysian Lake is managed primarily for Walleyes and secondarily for Black Crappies, Bluegills, and Yellow Perch. The current management plan calls for stocking Walleye fry during even years (2018, 2020, 2022, etc.). Following winterkill, Walleye fry are stocked at an increased rate and adult Bluegills, Black Crappies, and Yellow Perch are stocked to reintroduce management species. Elysian Lake is designated as a Tier-2 Lake and is surveyed as part of a regularly scheduled monitoring program at a frequency of every 6 years. The 2021 standard survey was completed the week of 21 June 2021 using 6 gill nets, 12 trap nets, and 78 minutes of boat electrofishing. Water quality parameters were also collected. <br> \n <br> \nWalleyes were abundant in the gill net sample in 2021. A total of 93 Walleyes were caught for a catch rate of 15.5/net. Since 1993, Walleye catch rates have varied from 0.1/net to 33.0/net with an average of 16.1/net. Walleye catch rates have exceeded 15/net in three surveys since the last winterkill in 2014. Walleyes ranged from 10.4 to 25.6 inches with an average of 19.0 inches. Approximately 90% of Walleyes sampled were over 15 inches and 30% exceeded 20 inches. Walleyes were 1 to 7 years old with 6 year classes present. The 2014 and 2015 year classes that dominated the 2018 sample accounted for 30% of the sample in 2021. The 2018 year class was the most abundant with a 57% share of the 2021 sample. Overall, approximately 87% of the sample came from years when Walleye fry were stocked. Interestingly, 9 Walleyes were age-1 from 2020 and must be the result of some limited natural reproduction that year. Walleyes growth rates were fast with an average length of 17.1 at 3 years old. Walleye stocking since the last winterkill appears to have been quite successful and has attracted significant angler activity in recent years, especially during the early ice season. The 2018 year class should continue this trend into the near future. <br> \n <br> \nA total of 178 Black Crappies were sampled with the gill nets for a catch rate of 29.7/net, indicating high numbers were present. The average Black Crappie catch rate before the 2014 winterkill was just 1.8/net but has improved to 16.6/net in three surveys since. Black Crappies ranged from 4.2 to 12.2 inches with an average of 6.5 inches in the gill nets and ranged from 4.2 to 15.8 inches with an average of 7.3 inches in the trap nets. Approximately 28% of the Black Crappie sample exceeded 8 inches in length. Most were young 1 to 3 year old fish, showing good consistent natural reproduction. Growth was fast with fish surpassing 9 inches by year 3. Like Walleyes, the Black Crappie population rebounded quickly after the 2013-2014 winterkill and has provided a consistent quality fishery in recent years. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill was the most common fish species sampled with the trap nets in 2021. A total of 71 Bluegills were caught for a rate of 5.9/net. Since 1993, Bluegill catch rates have varied from 0/net to 18.5/net with an average of 5.3/net. Bluegills ranged from 3.6 to 9.3 inches with an average of 5.9 inches. Almost half of Bluegills sampled were over 6 inches long and 17% were over 8 inches. Bluegills were 1 to 9 years old with 6 year classes present. Most Bluegills were 1 year old but 2 through 4 year old fish were also well represented. In the absence of winterkill events, Bluegill numbers should continue to improve in Elysian Lake. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch were common in the gill nets in 2021.  A total of 145 Yellow Perch were sampled for a catch rate of 24.2/net. This represented a substantial increase from 0.7/net in 2015 and 13.8/net in 2017. It was also the highest on record since 1993. Yellow Perch ranged from 5.3 to 10.2 inches with an average of 7.4 inches. About 28% of Yellow Perch sampled were larger than 8 inches and very few were over 10 inches. An additional 21 Yellow Perch ranging from 4.7 to 8.0 inches were sampled with the trap nets. Yellow Perch from both gears were 1 to 3 years old with 3 year classes present. Approximately 60% of Yellow Perch were 2 years old. Growth was fast with the quality length of 8 inches reached before year 3. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass were targeted with boat electrofishing for the first time in 2021 in response to an observed increase in angler catch in recent years. A total of 89 were sampled for a catch rate of 67.7/hour. Largemouth Bass ranged from 3.7 to 18.3 inches with an average of 8.3 inches. Largemouth Bass size structure was good with 66% over 12 inches and 22% over 15 inches. Eight more Largemouth Bass were sampled with the trap nets and ranged from 7.0 to 17.9 inches. Largemouth Bass from both gears ranged from 1 to 9 years old with 8 year classes present. One year old Largemouth Bass accounted for 61% of the sample. Largemouth Bass growth was fast with an average length of 13.3 inches at 3 years old. Like Bluegills, the Largemouth Bass population in Elysian Lake should continue to improve in the absence of winterkill. <br> \n <br> \nJust 5 Northern Pike ranging from 21.1 to 31.9 inches were sampled with the gill nets for a catch rate of 0.8/net, indicating low numbers were present despite heavy stocking following the 2014 winterkill. Only twice since 1993, have Northern Pike catch rates exceeded 2/net. In fact, the average Northern Pike catch rate of the five most recent surveys was just 1.3/net. Although present, the Northern Pike population of Elysian Lake offers only a limited opportunity to anglers. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Bullheads were the most abundant species sampled with the gill nets. A total of 221 Black Bullheads were caught for a rate of 36.8/net, indicating moderate to high numbers were present. Since 1993, Black Bullhead catch rates have varied from 0.8/net to 88.1/net with an average of 37.1/net. Black Bullheads were mostly large with an average length of 11.1 inches. For the few anglers that target Black Bullheads, the population offers good size structure with almost 30% over 12 inches. Despite the lack of winterkill and increased diversity in recent years, poor habitat and water quality persists in Elysian Lake and favors generalist species such as Black Bullheads.  <br> \n <br> \nA total of 18 Common Carp were sampled with the gill nets for a catch rate of 3.0/net, which was well below the long-term mean of 35.2/net. Elysian Lake has an extensive history of excessive Common Carp numbers and as a result is a frequent target of the local commercial fishermen. Hopefully the high numbers of piscivorous fish such as Walleyes, Black Crappies, and Largemouth Bass will keep Common Carp numbers near the 2021 catch rate. <br> \n <br> \nOther Species sampled in 2021 include Bigmouth Buffalo, Channel Catfish, Green Sunfish, White Crappie, White Sucker, and Yellow Bullhead. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers can play an important role in maintaining or improving a fish population by practicing selective harvest. Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for consumption, while encouraging the release of medium to large fish that may contribute to natural reproduction. This practice helps maintain balance in the fish populations and provides anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future. Additionally, smaller fish often taste better and have fewer contaminants than larger, older fish from the same water body. <br> \n <br> \nShoreline property owners also play an important role in the overall health of an aquatic ecosystem, including the fish population. Natural shorelines, including vegetation, woody debris, and bottom substrates, provide valuable habitat for fish and wildlife, help maintain water quality, and reduce bank erosion. Cattails and bulrushes are particularly beneficial for fish spawning, rearing, and feeding. By leaving natural shorelines unaltered or restoring them to natural conditions, shoreline property owners are doing their part to maintain or improve a healthy ecosystem in the lake and protect the resource for future generations. <br> \n <br> \n- Sky Wigen, Fisheries Specialist <br> \n</p>",

WAE ARE ABUNDANT, AVERAGING 24.00/ GILL NET, WITH A MEDIAN LENGTH OF 10.8 INCHES. ALL THE WAE SAMPLED WERE AGE 1 AND AVERAGED 8.8 INCHES AT THEIR FIRST ANNULUS, COMPARED TO THE STATE AVERAGE OF 5.1 INCHES.  BLG AVERAGED 16.00/ TRAP NET, WITH YEARLINGS DOMINATING THE CATCH AND ONLY A FEW 4 AND 5 YEAR OLDS NETTED.  YEARLING BLG AVERAGED 2.5 INCHES AT THEIR FIRST ANNULUS. GROWTH IS GOOD FOR BLG, WITH A MEDIAN LENGTH OF 3.8 INCHES.  BLC AVERAGED 4.00/TRAP NET, WITH A MEDIAN LENGTH OF 5.0 INCHES.  GROWTH HAS BEEN FAST FOR BLC, AND THE 1991 YEAR CLASS SHOULD ENTER THE CREEL IN 1993 WITH CONTINUED GOOD GROWTH.  ONLY TWO NOP, BOTH YEARLINGS, WERE NETTED.  THEY EXHIBITED FAST GROWTH, AVERAGING 16.3 INCHES AT AGE 1 COMPARED TO THE STATE AVERAGE OF 7.8 INCHES. BLB WERE ABUNDANT, AVERAGING 74.25/TRAP NET.  BLB ARE REPRESENTED BY 4.0-12.9 INCH FISH.  THERE APPEARS TO BE A DOMINANT COHORT OF 1990 FISH, WHICH ARE NOW 4.0-5.4 INCHES.  THERE APPEAR TO BE TWO OLDER AGE CLASSES PRESENT.  CARP WERE FOUND IN MODERATE NUMBERS, AVERAGING 3.00/TRAP NET, AND RANGED IN SIZE FROM 9.5-18.9 INCHES.  OTHER SPECIES SAMPLED IN LOW ABUNDANCE INCLUDE YEB, HSF, GSF, BIB, WTS, AND MADTOM.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Elysian has a history of winterkill and low oxygen levels in the winter of 2000 u 2001 resulted in winterkill conditions.  Fish abundance in the 2001 survey appeared to be rather low.  A population assessment was conducted in late June 2003 to monitor the status of the fish community following the winterkill.  Walleye catch per gill net had not yet returned to the high levels observed in 1993 and 1995, although catch had increased from the low levels recorded in 1996, 1999, and 2001.  All walleye captured in 2003 were age 1 or 2, likely from the 2001 and 2002 fry stockings.  The age 2 walleye were around 15 inches in length, while the age 0 fish were around 6.5 inches.  Northern pike catch per gill net has returned to the level recorded in 1995.  Most northern pike were between 21 and 30 inches in length, primarily age 2 and 3.  Black bullhead and carp are common, but are not at the high levels observed in the mid 1990's.  Other species captured included bigmouth buffalo, bowfin, yellow perch, bluegill, golden shiner, tadpole madtom, white sucker, and yellow bullhead.    The lake has been aerated since 1977.  While still subject to occasional winterkill, quality walleye fishing does occur on Lake Elysian, most recently in the early to mid 1990's.  The relatively low fish abundance in 2001 allowed for greater than normal walleye fry survival and growth and will result in a return to a quality walleye fishery.  About 75% of the watershed is agricultural which contributes to the high nutrient levels and abundant blue-green algae.  Low oxygen conditions occurred again in early 2004 that may result in winterkill of fish in Lake Elysian.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Elysian Lake is a 1,902 acre lake located in Waseca County stretching between the towns of Elysian and Janesville. Two DNR-operated public accesses are available for use; one on the north end of the lake just off MN Highway 60 and another on the south end of the lake adjacent to Lakeview Park. A county-operated public access is located on the northeast side of the lake off Waseca County Road 3. Elysian Lake is a large, windswept lake with an average depth of 7 feet and a maximum depth of 13 feet. Elysian Lake is managed primarily for Walleye and secondarily for Black Crappie, Bluegill, and Largemouth Bass. The base stocking plan for Elysian Lake includes stocking Walleye fry every other year at a rate of 500 fish/acre. Elysian Lake is prone to periodic winterkills, after which game fish, such as Walleye, Black Crappie, Bluegill, Yellow Perch, and Largemouth Bass are stocked to boost the depleted fishery. <br> \n <br> \nElysian Lake was surveyed the week of September 5th, 2017 by the MN DNR as part of a targeted survey intended to assess the Walleye population. This survey included deploying six gill nets and recording water quality parameters. A targeted survey is generally used for sampling a specific kind of fish or time of year (i.e. spawning season, fall season, etc.) unlike a standard survey which samples a wider range of fish species during the summer months using standard methods (i.e. standard time of year, set sampling stations, taking water clarity readings and oxygen/temperature profiles, etc.) and gears (i.e. lake survey gillnets, trap nets, and spring electrofishing for Largemouth Bass). Results from this targeted survey should not be compared to results from standard surveys. <br> \n <br> \nThe Walleye population in Elysian Lake was decimated by winterkill in 2014, after which Walleye fry were stocked to rebuild the population. Typical of a fish population recovering from a winterkill, catch rates were relatively high in 2017. The Walleye catch rate was 24.1 fish/gill net. Walleye lengths ranged from 12.2 to 22.6 inches with an average of 14.3 inches. Two year classes of Walleye were sampled, corresponding to fry stocking in 2014 and 2015. The mean length of age-2 (2015 year class) fish was 13.3 inches and the mean length of age-3 (2014 year class) fish was 15.6 inches. Walleye growth was classified as slow after the 2015 standard survey, however growth rates have improved, perhaps due in part to large year classes of Black Crappie and Bigmouth Buffalo providing plentiful food for Walleye. The Walleye management plan goal for Elysian Lake (20.0 fish/gill net) was met in 2017.  <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie populations are most commonly assessed using trap nets rather than gill nets. However, Black Crappie were sampled in high numbers during this targeted survey. Black Crappie catch rates in gill nets were 17.5/gill net. The average length of Black Crappies sampled was 6.7 inches and ranged from 3.9 inches to 12.5 inches. Forty-seven percent of Black Crappies sampled were less than 5 inches long, indicating strong reproduction. Black Crappies are not stocked in Elysian Lake, so the population persists exclusively through natural reproduction.  <br> \n <br> \nGill netting is not an effective gear for assessing Bluegill populations and only two were sampled during this survey. Bluegill relative abundance was low during the 2015 standard survey (2.7/trap net) and has historically been variable at Lake Elysian. Although many factors play a role in the year class strength of Bluegills, sporadic natural recruitment, periodic winterkills, and poor habitat (turbid water and a lack of submersed vegetation) in Elysian Lake most likely influence the abundance variability. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Bullhead were sampled at a rate of 30.0 fish/gill net. The average length of Black Bullheads from gill nets in 2017 was 10.0 inches, and ranged from 4.5 inches to 12.4 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike relative abundance was 1.5/gill net. The average length of Northern Pike was 21.8 inches and ranged from 11.3 inches to 30.2 inches. Five of the nine (56%) Northern Pike sampled were greater than 24.0 inches total length. Northern Pike will no longer be stocked in Elysian Lake until habitat conditions (water clarity and submersed vegetation) improve. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch catch rates in 2017 were 13.8/gill net. The average length of Yellow Perch sampled in 2017 was 8.7 inches and ranged from 6.5 inches to 11.7 inches. <br> \n <br> \nBigmouth Buffalo were the most commonly sampled fish (98.0/gill net) during the targeted survey. Common carp were sampled at a rate of 7.3 fish/gill net. A large Common Carp kill took place during the summer of 2017 which was attributed to the Koi Herpes Virus (KHV). The KHV is most likely spread by illegal releases of Goldfish into lakes and ponds.  Goldfish are carriers of the virus, but are not affected by it. While the carp die-off was massive, it was not a complete kill. Please do not release pet fish into public waters. <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species sampled throughout the survey included White Sucker, White Crappie, Yellow Bullhead, Channel Catfish, Green Sunfish, and Golden Shiner. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers can play an important role in maintaining or improving a fish population by practicing selective harvest. Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for consumption, while encouraging the release of medium to large fish that may contribute to natural reproduction. This practice helps maintain balance in the fish populations and provides anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future. Additionally, smaller fish often taste better and have fewer contaminants than larger, older fish from the same water body. <br> \n <br> \nShoreline property owners also play an important role in the overall health of an aquatic ecosystem, including the fish population. Natural shorelines, including vegetation, woody debris, and bottom substrates, provide valuable habitat for fish and wildlife, help maintain water quality, and reduce bank erosion. Cattails and bulrushes are particularly beneficial for fish spawning, rearing, and feeding. By leaving natural shorelines unaltered or restoring them to natural conditions, shoreline property owners are doing their part to maintain or improve a healthy ecosystem in the lake and protect the resource for future generations <br> \n <br> \n-Brandon Eder, assistant area supervisor  <br> \n</p>",
