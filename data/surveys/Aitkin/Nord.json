The gill net indices for white sucker and yellow perch were below the lake class 29 first quartile.  The trap net indices for yellow bullhead and bluegill were above the lake class 29 third quartiles. Northern pike sampled (52 of 60 aged) ranged from two to eight plus years of age with strong year classes indicated for 1987 and 1988.  Growth rates were normal. Bluegill sampled (40 of 125 aged) ranged from two to eight years of age with strong year classes in 1985, 1986, and 1987.  The growth rates for the second, third and fourth increments were slower than normal.  The length at formation of the eighth annulus was normal. Largemouth bass sampled (18 of 18 aged) ranged from two to six years of age with a strong year class indicated for 1987.  Growth rates were normal. Black crappie sampled (35 of 41 aged) ranged from two to six years of age with a strong year class indicated for 1986.  The growth rate for the second increment was slower than normal. The length at annulus formation at age six was normal. Walleye sampled (26 of 37 aged) ranged from four to eight plus years of age plus years of age with a strong year class indicated for 1986 which corresponds to a 1987 stocking of five per pound walleye yearlings and 1984 which corresponds to a 1985 stocking of three per pound walleye yearlings.  Growth rates were normal. The gill net index for walleye indicates significant increase in abundance since 1985 based on five gill net sets. The trap net index for yellow bullhead indicates an apparent significant increase in abundance since 1985.  The trap net index for black crappie indicate an apparent significant decrease in abundance since 1985.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Nord Lake is a medium sized lake, about 411 acres in size. The lake is located in southwestern Aitkin County about three and a half miles southeast of Aitkin. A public access is located on the southeast end of the lake, off of Aitkin County Road 12 (Deer Street). It is surrounded by forest and bog and is classified as a northern pike and bluegill lake.  A walleye fishery is maintained through stocking fingerlings every other year. The lake lives up to a reputation it has of producing abundant small northern pike and bluegills. The lake also has a reputation among local bass anglers for producing consistent action with good-sized largemouth bass.  <br> \n <br> \nThe survey in 2009 indicated an increasing abundance of northern pike from an already above normal population. Ideally, this lake should have a lower total abundance of northern pike with a greater number of fish longer than 24 inches.  Pike abundance is probably limiting walleye fingerling survival to some degree.  The average length of pike was 17.6 inches with 13% being longer than 24 inches.  Anglers are encouraged to release pike greater than 24 inches in length.  Doing so should increase angler catch rates of larger pike and also help maintain a balanced fish community, particularly as larger northern pike have been shown to consume smaller pike.  <br> \n <br> \nAlthough not a significant increase since 2000, the trap net catch rate for bluegills was the second highest observed in the 8 assessments that have been completed since 1959. Abundant bluegill and hybrid sunfish in Nord Lake are generally on the small side and grow slowly.  No bluegills larger than 8 inches were observed in 2009; however, some hybrid sunfish, which grow a little faster than bluegills, did attain this size.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie abundance decreased slightly since 2000, but is still within the normal range for this type of lake.  The 2005 year class of crappies is the strongest at the present time and are averaging 7.8 inches in length. These crappies will be growing into harvestable size in the next couple of years.   <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass catch rates in 2009 indicated a higher abundance for this species than the 2000 survey, and was also above average for this lake class.  Largemouth bass ranged in size from 2.9 to 18.9 inches and averaged 12.3 inches in length.   <br> \n <br> \nNord Lake is stocked with walleye fingerlings in alternating years with adults and yearlings being stocked when available. Most walleyes sampled were from years where fingerlings were stocked. The catch rate of 2.4 walleye per net is an increase of 1 fish per net compared to the last survey and is above the normal range for this lake type. Though anglers may experience low catch rates for walleyes, the size structure of the population is desirable with an average size of 17 inches and 30 percent of walleye sampled measured at least 20 inches.   <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Nord Lake is a 418-acre lake with a maximum depth of 29 feet.  Residential development is evident along portions of the shoreline, but substantial portions are in a natural condition with abundant shoreline vegetation and woody habitat.  A survey targeting the near shore fish community was conducted on Nord Lake on 4 August, 2014. This was a repeat near shore survey conducted within a single season to assess sampling variability.  Sampling sites are 100 feet long and ten stations were evenly spaced around the lake shore, sampling a variety of habitat types.   <br> \n <br> \nElectrofishing with a backpack unit was conducted at all 10, but some sampling took place from the boat at sites where depth and emergent vegetation prevented wading.  Seining was conducted at 6 sites as emergent vegetation, soft sediments, and deep water prevented seining at four sites.  Nearshore IBI sampling captured a large number of species of fish including: (in alphabetical order) Black crappie, Blacknose Shiner, Bluegill, Bluntnose Minnow, Central Mudminnow, Golden Shiner, Green Sunfish, Hybrid Sunfish, Iowa Darter, Johnny Darter, Largemouth Bass, Pumpkinseed, Spottail Shiner, Tadpole Madtom, Yellow Bullhead, and Yellow Perch.  <br> \n <br> \nThe near shore survey captured two species that are intolerant of poor water quality and/or shoreline disturbance including: Blacknose Shiner and Iowa Darter.  One tolerant species, Green Sunfish, was sampled.   <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore fish survey data is combined with gillnet and trapnet data to describe the fish community and provide a fish-based Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) score based on expectations for similar lakes. The IBI score calculated from this survey suggests that Nord Lake's fish community has not been degraded by excess watershed or shoreline stress to an extent such that it is below an impairment threshold identified for similar lakes in the state.   (As mentioned above, this was a repeat survey, note that both scores were the same). <br> \n <br> \nThis sampling protocol is part of a watershed assessment tool in development in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.   Nord Lake is located in the Mississippi River - Brainerd Huc8 watershed. <br> \n <br> \nThis survey was conducted by IBI Program Staff.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Nord Lake is a medium sized lake located in southwestern Aitkin County, a little over three miles southeast of Aitkin. There is a state owned public access with a concrete log ramp located on the southeast end of the lake off Aitkin County Road 12 (Deer Street). The lake is surrounded by forest and bog and is classified as a Northern Pike and Bluegill lake. A Walleye fishery is maintained through fall fingerling stocking every year. The lake is known by local anglers for producing abundant but small Northern Pike and Bluegills. The lake also has a reputation for providing consistent action for good sized Largemouth Bass.  <br> \n <br> \nResults from the 2019 assessment indicate Northern Pike abundance remains high, which is not unusual and is similar to previous surveys. Ideally, this lake would have a lower total abundance of Northern Pike with a greater number of fish longer than 24\". Pike abundance is probably limiting Walleye fingerling survival to some degree. The average length of pike was just 16.5\" with a mere 8 percent being longer than 24\". Pike as large as 36.4\" were sampled indicating that they can grow to desirable sizes. Anglers are encouraged to release pike greater than 24\" to increase angler catch rates of larger pike and also help maintain a balanced fish community, especially since larger northern pike have been shown to consume smaller pike in this lake.  <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass gill net catch rates were in the normal range for this type of lake. In addition to the regular survey, spring night time electrofishing was also done. Bass were abundant with a catch rate approaching 80/hr, which is a high rate for this area and they seem to have increased in abundance overtime. Sizes ranged from 7.3 to 18.3\" and averaged about 13\" and 1.3 pounds.  <br> \n <br> \nNord Lake is stocked with Walleye fingerlings on an annual basis. The catch rate of 1.8 Walleye per gill net was a slight increase from the previous survey and is within the normal range for similar lakes. Although Nord Lake is not a typical destination for Walleye anglers, and likely has relatively low angling catch rates, the size structure of the Walleye population is desirable with an average size of 17\" and 25% of Walleye sampled greater than 20\". <br> \n <br> \nBluegill catches were comparable to the previous survey 5 years ago and abundance seems to have leveled off after showing an increasing trend from 1995-2009. Abundance of Bluegill is within the normal range for similar lake types. Sunfish in Nord Lake are generally on the small side and grow slowly, but some Bluegills larger than 8\" were observed in 2019. Hybrid sunfish, which grow a little faster than Bluegills, can sometimes be found in reasonable numbers and sizes as well, but did show a decrease in abundance this survey.  <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie abundance decreased slightly each survey since 2000, but is still within the normal range for this type of lake. Black Crappies ranged from 4.3 to 10.2\" with an average of 8.0\". <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Anglers who visit Nord Lake should have little trouble catching fish. Nord Lake contains an abundance of northern pike and sunfish. Catching a quality-sized fish of either species may be more difficult. About 50% of the northern pike in the gill nets were less than eighteen inches long.  Catch and release should be practiced on the larger northern pike to protect these large fish, which prey on the overabundant small northern pike.  The pike are so abundant that few can grow to quality size. The absence of yellow perch in the survey also indicates an over-abundant northern pike population. Nord Lake had been managed with a special regulation which encouraged additional harvest of small northern pike. The regulation has been removed because it was not effective in changing the northern pike population structure.  Speaking of small, none of the sunfish caught in the trap nets in this survey and only one in the last survey were over 8.5 inches long.  The average bluegill in the trap nets was only 5.3 inches long and the growth rates were well below normal. The black crappies tend to be more acceptably sized. The black crappie population also seems to be relatively low; abundance decreased since the 1990 assessment.   Walleyes were caught at a rate which is normal for this type of lake, which means that not many were caught. The average walleye in the gillnet catches was 19.2 inches and the largest walleye was 26.3 inches. Smaller walleyes are not proportionately vulnerable to the nets and are probably more abundant than the nets indicate.  More small walleyes may be caught in the year or two following this survey, but due to dense vegetation and other structure factors walleye catch rates may remain relatively low. The abundance of walleyes is also probably limited by abundant northern pike which both prey on and compete for food with small walleyes.   Largemouth bass are doing well in the lake. The survey nets caught them at above normal rates and the fish ranged up to 19.6 inches long. A catch and release ethic for largemouth bass on Nord Lake will allow the bass to maintain a quality population. Otherwise, the population may experience a downturn if the larger spawning fish are removed from the lake and natural reproduction becomes inadequate to overcome the intense predation by northern pike.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Nord Lake is a medium sized lake located in southwestern Aitkin County, a little over three miles southeast of Aitkin.  There is a state owned public access with concrete log ramp located on the southeast end of the lake, off Aitkin County Road 12 (Deer Street).  The lake is surrounded by forest and bog and is classified as a northern pike and bluegill lake.  A walleye fishery is maintained through fall fingerling stocking every other year.  The lake is known by local anglers for producing abundant but small northern pike and bluegills. The lake also has a reputation for providing consistent action for good sized largemouth bass.  <br> \n <br> \nResults from the 2014 assessment indicate northern pike abundance remains high, which is not unusual and is similar to previous surveys.  Ideally, this lake would have a lower total abundance of northern pike with a greater number of fish longer than 24\".  Pike abundance is probably limiting walleye fingerling survival to some degree. The average length of pike was just 15.8\" with a mere 5% being longer than 24\".  Pike as large as 35\" were sampled indicating that they can grow to desirable sizes.  Anglers are encouraged to release pike greater than 24\" to increase angler catch rates of larger pike and also help maintain a balanced fish community, especially since larger northern pike have been shown to consume smaller pike in this lake.  <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass gill net catch rates were above the normal range for this type of lake.  Sizes ranged from 7.8 to 18.4\" and averaged about 12.6\" and a little over 1 pound.   <br> \nNord Lake is stocked with walleye fingerlings in alternate years with adults and yearlings stocked occasionally when available. Most walleyes sampled were from years where fingerlings were stocked. The catch rate of 1.3 walleye per gill net is within the normal range for similar lakes. Although Nord Lake is not a typical destination for walleye anglers, and likely has relatively low angling catch rates, the size structure of the walleye population is desirable with an average size of 19\" and 33% of walleye sampled greater than 20\". <br> \n <br> \nThough still within the normal range for this type of lake, a significant decrease was detected in the bluegill and pumpkinseed populations.  Sunfish in Nord Lake are generally on the small side and grow slowly, but some bluegills larger than 8\" were observed in 2014.  Hybrid sunfish, which grow a little faster than bluegills, can be found in reasonable numbers and sizes as well.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie abundance decreased slightly since 2000, but is still within the normal range for this type of lake. Black crappies ranged from 5.7 to 11.6\" with an average of 8.5\". <br> \n</p>",

It is surrounded by forest and bog and is classified as a northern pike and bluegill lake.  The lake lives up to its reputation and produces abundant small northern pike and bluegills.  A walleye fishery is maintained through stocking fingerlings every other year.  The lake also has a reputation among local bass anglers for producing consistent action with good-sized largemouth bass.  The survey in 2000 indicated an increasing abundance of bluegill and pumpkinseed sunfish while maintaining an above average abundance of northern pike.  Ideally, this lake should have a lower total abundance of northern pike, including some larger fish.  However, a decrease in the abundance of larger fish may have allowed the number of smaller fish to increase unchecked.  Abundant small fish in Nord Lake generally grow slowly.  Eight-inch bluegills, for example were 13 years old.  Bluegills and pumpkinseed sunfish caught in trap nets ranged in size from two to eight inches with about a third of the fish sampled greater than six inches in length.  Black crappie abundance was above average due to strong 1996 and 1997 year-classes.  At the time of this survey, black crappies averaged about 7.5 inches in length and should be of interest to anglers over the next couple of years.  Northern pike abundance was above average for this lake type.  The average length was 18.2 inches with a weight of two pounds.  Anglers are encouraged to release pike greater than 22 inches in length, which increases their catch rates and also allows them to help maintain balanced northern pike, bluegill, and yellow perch populations through a series of interactions.  Largemouth bass abundance was above average in Nord Lake.  Largemouth bass ranged in size from 4.4 to 17.6 inches and averaged 12.5 inches in length.  Most walleyes sampled were from years fingerlings were stocked.  The catch rate was 1.3 fish per net, which is about average for this lake type.  Though anglers may experience low catch rates for walleyes there are some large fish present with half the walleyes sampled at least 20 inches in length.  About 25 percent of the walleyes captured were from the stocked 1999 year-class and may be of interest to anglers in a few years.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A special assessment targeting near shore fish species was conducted on July 30, 2014.  This survey was completed in addition to the standard population assessment conducted the week of August 4, 2014.  Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake (10 stations) and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible.  Species information was gathered as part of a statewide project to evaluate the fish Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) for Minnesota lakes.  IBI program staff completed an additional repeat assessment that is meant to provide a means to evaluate quality control of sampling protocols (see Nord SA 8/4/2014). <br> \n <br> \nBackpack electrofishing was completed at all 10 stations, but three sites were sampled from the boat due to unstable footing.  A 50-foot seine was used to sample 1 station, a 15-foot seine was used at 6 stations, and site conditions prevented the use of seines at 3 sites.  Nearshore sampling captured several fish species; bluntnose minnow, central mudminnow, Iowa darter, and Johnny darter.  <br> \n <br> \nNord Lake falls within lake class 32 based on the Schupp lake classification used by MnDNR and within Group 4 lakes for evaluating IBI data.  IBI scores range from 0 to 100 and the draft impairment threshold for this group of lakes is 38 (90% CI 30-46) and the potential exceptional quality level is set at 59.  The IBI score calculated from this survey, using standard gill net and trap net data from the 2014 population assessment, was 53.  An identical score of 53 was found in the repeat assessment (see Nord SA 8/4/2014). <br> \n</p>",
