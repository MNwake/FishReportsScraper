                "narrative": "<p>Pomme de Terre Lake is a 1758-acre basin located on the upper reaches of the Pomme de Terre River in Grant County.  Water quality and clarity are generally considered poor.  The river transports significant amounts of nutrients and sediment to the lake.  High nutrient concentrations result in excessive algae growth and poor water clarity.  Water clarity is also diminished by the re-suspension of sediments by wind and wave action.  Wave action has also caused serious erosion problems on shoreline areas with steep unprotected slopes.  Most of the main basin lacks emergent vegetation to protect the shoreline from erosion.  Submergent vegetation has become more dense in some areas of the lake, especially protected bays.  This aquatic vegetation provides critical habitat for fish and competes with nuisance algae for the available nutrients in the water.Pomme de Terre Lake is managed primarily as a walleye fishery.  Walleye gill net catches averaged about 8 fish/net in 2003, which is within the normal range of catch rates for large, shallow lakes.  Most of the walleye captured were two-year-old fish that averaged 13 inches in length in August.  This year class corresponds to year of fry stocking in 2001. Fry are stocked in odd-numbered years to enhance walleye abundance.  Natural reproduction also occurs within the Pomme de Terre River system. Largemouth bass, bluegill, and black crappie all produced strong year classes in recent years.  Small fish were abundant in sampling efforts.  Moderate numbers of adult fish were also captured and should provide additional angling opportunities.  Northern pike abundance is limited, however the fish are capable of reaching trophy sizes.  One-third of the fish captured were 30 inches in length or greater, and two fish exceeded 36 inches.       </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Pomme de Terre Lake is a shallow, 1,758-acre basin located on the Pomme de Terre River between the towns of Elbow Lake and Ashby in Grant County.   Mean and maximum depths are 10.0 and 23.0 feet, respectively.  The Pomme de Terre River inflows in the northwest corner of this basin and outflows in the southwest corner.  The river transports significant amounts of nutrients and sediment into and through the lake.  Water quality and clarity can be poor following heavy rainfall events and during the heat of the summer due to suspended sediments and algae blooms.   Water clarity at the start of the 2017 survey was 3.0 feet.  Due to seasonally poor water quality and water level fluctuations, the lake does not support many aquatic plants.  Primary management efforts on Pomme de Terre Lake are directed towards Walleye.  Natural reproduction sustains this fishery but Walleye fry are stocked every other year to supplement the population.\n\nA standard MN DNR lake survey was completed in August 2017 to assess the fish community of Pomme de Terre Lake.  The most abundant game fishes were those best adapted to a turbid environment (Walleye and Black Crappie).  Walleye catches averaged 7.8 fish/gill net in 2017, which is considered average for similar Minnesota lakes.  Ages of captures extended to age 16.  Due to very fast growth, approximately 81% of the Walleyes sampled exceeded 15.0 inches in length.  Average size at capture was 17.7 inches and 2.0 pounds.  Black Crappies were abundant but most captures were younger, smaller fish.  Size structure of this population will improve greatly in the next few years as these fish grow to a harvestable size.  White Crappies are present, but they are less abundant.  Other gamefishes that are sight feeders or dependent on aquatic vegetation during early life stages (Bluegill, Largemouth Bass, Northern Pike, and Yellow Perch) have typically been less abundant in this basin.  However, Bluegill and Largemouth Bass populations appear to be increasing due to successful reproduction in recent years.  Smaller, younger Bluegill and Largemouth Bass were common in 2017 survey catches.  Larger bass, some exceeding 19.0 inches, do occur in low numbers.  Pomme de Terre Lake also supports a limited Smallmouth Bass fishery.  One 19.2 inch capture occurred during the survey. Only 10 Northern Pike were caught.  While typically not very abundant, some large pike have been captured.  The largest measured in 2017 was 34.9 inches in length.  Very few Yellow Perch were captured and all were too small to contribute to the sport fishery.  Capture biomass of non-game fishes (Bigmouth Buffalo, Common Carp, White Sucker, and Yellow Bullhead) was high.\n  \nOther species common to Pomme de Terre Lake include Black and Brown Bullhead, Bowfin (dogfish), Freshwater Drum (sheepshead), hybrid sunfish, Longnose Gar, and Pumpkinseed.  The next standard lake survey is tentatively scheduled for 2023.\n\nThree public access locations are available on Pomme de Terre Lake.  Boaters should be aware of numerous shallow rocky areas, especially during periods of low water levels.  These navigation hazards are located mainly along points and in the middle of the southern arm of this basin.\n \nPomme de Terre Lake has not been designated as an infested waterbody because aquatic invasive species have yet to be found there.  However, zebra mussels were confirmed in an upstream basin, Ten Mile Lake, in 2017.

Aquatic vegetation grows to a depth of only 8.0 feet, however the lake supports a moderate density anddiversity of submergent aquatic vegetation given the poor water clarity and physical limitations of thebasin.  Emergent vegetation is limited.  Walleye catches averaged 5.3 fish/gillnet which is within the normal range of mean gillnet catches fromlakes with similar chemical and physical characteristics (3.2 - 15.3 fish/gillnet).  Gillnet catcheshave ranged between 4.9 and 8.2 fish/net in previous surveys dating back to 1979.  Approximately 40%of the fish captured were 20.0 inches in length or greater.  The age class distribution of walleyecaptured in gillnets suggests that fry stockings have been more successful than fingerling stockingsin supplementing year class strength.  The results from the 1991 lake survey also demonstrated therelative success of fry stockings in 1990 and 1991.  Northern pike catches averaged 1.1 fish/gillnet. Gillnet catches have ranged from 0.0 to 3.0 fish/gillnet in previous surveys dating back to 1979.  Thenormal range of mean catch rates from similar lakes is 1.2 - 7.8 fish/gillnet.  Mean weight of fishcaptured in 1995 was 2.2 pounds.  Fish ranged from 10.5 to 26.7 inches in total length.  Trapnetcatches averaged 1.5 fish/net.  Size structure of fish captured in trapnets was similar to the sizestructure in gillnets.  Daytime, DC electrofishing yielded 7.8 stock-size largemouth bass per hour. Daytime, AC electrofishing yielded 9.6 stock-size fish per hour in 1991.  Mean weight of fish capturedin 1995 was 2.3 pounds.  Bluegill catches averaged 2.0 fish/net in 1995 which is within the normalrange of mean catch rates from similar lakes (1.0 - 14.9 fish/trapnet).  Trapnet catches were higherin previous surveys averaging 8.5 fish/net in 1991, 31.1 fish/net in 1987, and 15.2 fish/net in 1983. Mean weight of fish captured in 1995 was 0.1 pounds.  Only 25% of fish were 6 inches in length orgreater.  Yellow perch catch rates averaged 16.9 fish/gillnet.  Gillnet catches have ranged from 3.0to 21.1 fish/net in previous surveys dating back to 1979.  The normal range of mean catch rates fromsimilar lakes is 3.0 - 22.5 fish/gillnet.  Mean weight of fish captured was 0.1 pounds.   Most of thefish are between 5 and 8 inches in length.  </p>",

Water quality is generally considered poor.  High phosphorus concentrationsresult in excessive algae growth.  Wind driven waves re-suspend sediment which also reduces waterclarity in this large, shallow lake.  Wave action also causes serious erosion problems on some of thesteep shoreline areas.  However, most of the water quality problems are related to land use practiceswithin the predominately agricultural watershed.  Anglers normally target walleye on Pomme De Terre Lake.  Fish are moderately abundant.  Gill netcatches averaged 8.1 fish/net which is just above the median catch rate for these large, shallow lakes. Most of the fish captured in 1999 were two year old fish that averaged about 13 inches in length. These fish correspond to a fry stocking in 1997.  Fry are stocked in alternate years to increasewalleye numbers.  Natural reproduction also occurs within the Pomme De Terre River system. Bluegill and largemouth bass also produced strong year classes in 1997.  These fish were relativelysmall at the time of the lake survey in 1999.  However, they may provide some angling opportunities inthe near future.  Black and white crappie are both present and could provide additional anglingopportunities. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Pomme de Terre Lake is a shallow, 1758-acre basin located on the Pomme de Terre River in Grant County.   The river transports significant amounts of nutrients and sediment to and through the lake.  Water quality and clarity can be poor following heavy rainfall events and during the heat of the summer due to suspended sediments and algae blooms.   Water clarity at the start of the 2011 fish community assessment was 2.6 feet.  Due to seasonally poor water quality and water level fluctuations, the lake does not support many aquatic plants.  <br> \n  <br> \nPomme de Terre Lake is managed as a walleye fishery.  Walleye fry are stocked during odd-numbered years to supplement natural reproduction and sustain population abundance objectives.   Walleye catches during the 2011 survey averaged 7.3 fish/gillnet which is average for similar lakes.  Relatively few old walleye were captured suggesting annual mortality is high.  Fortunately, walleye grow exceptionally fast in Pomme de Terre Lake and quickly reach a harvestable size.  Age-3 walleye averaged 16.0 inches in length.  Size structure of the population sample proved excellent.  Seventy-seven percent of walleye captures exceeded 15.0 inches.  Due to fast growth, 19% of the population sample was comprised of 20.0-inch and larger walleye.  <br> \n <br> \nBoth black and white crappie were netted during the 2011 fish community assessment.  Black crappie catches exceeded that of white crappie, but neither of these populations was abundant at time of the survey.  Population density varies from year to year in response to inconsistent spawning success or survival of young fish.   While not abundant in 2011, crappie grow fast and can get large.  The largest black crappie measured during the 2011 survey was 13.4 inches in length.  <br> \n  <br> \nSeasonally poor water quality, limited vegetation, and water level instability constitute a harsh environment for sight feeding predators, nesting species, and young gamefishes dependent upon aquatic plants for feeding and escape cover.  Northern pike, largemouth bass, bluegill, and yellow perch are able to sustain their presence, but these species have seldom been described as abundant.   Most bluegill and yellow perch were too small at time of the survey to contribute much to the fishery.  Northern pike and largemouth bass catch success may be low, but these popular gamefish can provide good fishing because of their large average size.  Average weight of northern pike captures was 3.1 lbs.  Seventy-three percent of largemouth bass caught during the survey were 15.0 inches and larger.   <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of the nearshore fish community was conducted by Fisheries Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program Staff starting August 28, 2017. Eighteen sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 15-foot or 50-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at all 18 sites with one site sampled from the boat. Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample 16 sites and soft sediments with abundant vegetation prevented the use of seines at two sampling sites. Nearshore sampling captured 24 native species of fish including five species that are intolerant of disturbance (Banded Killifish, Iowa Darter, Logperch, Pugnose Shiner, and Rock Bass), three native species that are tolerant of disturbance (Fathead Minnow, Green Sunfish, and Orangespotted Sunfish) and one non-native species that is also tolerant of disturbance (Common Carp).  The high number of species collected is likely influenced by the Pomme de Terre River flowing through this lake.  <br> \n <br> \nData from this targeted nearshore survey is combined with trap net and gill net data from an August 2017 standard survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based Index of Biological Integrity (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment. The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. The FIBI score for Pomme de Terre Lake from this survey is above an impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar shallow lakes. For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website. <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Pomme de Terre River Watershed assessment of surface waters process completed in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.</p>",

Backpack electrofishing and/or seining were conducted at 18 stations, representing a variety of habitat types, along the shoreline of Pomme de Terre Lake.  The survey was conducted during the five-year sampling window for intensive monitoring efforts within the Pomme de Terre River watershed, and will be contributing to a watershed assessment process in coordination with Minnesota Pollution Control Agency.\n\nTwenty-two species were collected during this survey.  Five species (Banded Killifish, Iowa Darter, Logperch, Pugnose Shiner, and Rock Bass) were considered \"intolerant\" and three species (Black Bullhead, Common Carp, and Green Sunfish) were considered \"tolerant\" based on current tolerance classifications for Minnesota lakes. \n\nNearshore catch data will be used along with gill and trap net catch data to develop an Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) score, which is indicative of the health of Pomme de Terre Lake.</p>",

The number of Walleye less than 11.0 sampled in the gill nets has increased from 0.2/gill net in 1983 to 5.4/gill net in 1987. This doesn't correlate very well with the stocking records. Thirty-eight one-year old (1986 year- class) Walleyes were captured. There was no stocking of Walleyes in 1986. There is a possibility the fish migrated downstream from Pelican Lake or there is natural reproduction in the lake. Growth of Walleye through age 4 is excellent. 1986 also produced strong year-classes of Largemouth Bass, Black Crappie, and Bluegill. These strong year-classes may be the result of the high-water which started in the fall of 1985 and continued through 1986. Growth rates of the Centrarchid species appears to be fast. The size structure and high abundance of Carp, Bigmouth Buffalo, White Sucker and bullheads, should make commercial netting feasible.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Walleye catch rates have remained stable over the past twenty years.  Average survey catches have ranged 3.1 and 8.2 fish/gill net.  Walleye catch rates averaged 6.4 fish/gill net in 1991.  This catch rate is typical for lakes within lake classification 41 and meets the long range goal of 6-10 fish/gill net in the 1987 lake management plan.  Age-0 and 1 fish comprised 78% (58/74) of the Walleye captured. Accordingly, PSD and RSD-P were only 27% and 7%, respectively.  Walleye growth is rapid.  Age 4 fish averaged 17.0 inches in total length at time of annulus formation.  This rapid growth is probably due to an abundance of small Yellow Perch.  The strong 1991 and 1990 year classes are the result of successful fry stockings or natural recruitment. It appears that fry stockings are more cost- effective than fingerling stockings in maintaining the desired Walleye density.  Yellow Perch catch rate increased from 3.0 fish/gill net in 1987 to 21.1 fish/gill net in 1991.  The mean weight of yep captured was 0.09 lbs and PSD was less than 1%.  Northern Piker were not present in gill net catches.  Catch rate averaged 0.3 fish/gill net and 1.1 fish/gill net in 1983 and 1987, respectively.  Three Northern Pike were collected in the trap nets.  The mean weight of these fish was 5.2 lbs.  Daytime electrofishing yielded 9.7 stock- length Largemouth Bass/hour.  The size structure of the Largemouth Bass population is desirable PSD and PSD-P were calculated at 55% and 27%, respectively.  Largemouth Bass growth is similar to average growth rate for area lakes within lake classification 41.  Fish averaged 11.87 inches at the time of third annulus formation.  Bluegill abundance, as measured by trap net indices, declined from 31.1 fish/trap net in 1987 to 8.5 fish/trap net in 1991.  The mean weight of fish captured was 0.10 lbs and PSD was measured at 20%. The decline in Bluegill abundance may be due to interspecific competition with Yellow Perch which experienced a concurrent increase in abundance. However, the present Bluegill density is typical for lakes with similar morphoedaphic characteristics.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Pomme de Terre Lake is a 1758-acre basin located on the upper reaches of the Pomme de Terre River in Grant County. Water quality and clarity are seasonally poor. The river transports significant amounts of nutrients and sediment through the lake. High nutrient concentrations result in excessive algal growth and poor water quality. Water clarity is also diminished by the re-suspension of sediments through wind and wave action. Wave action has also caused serious erosion problems on shoreline areas with steep, unprotected slopes. Most of the main basin lacks emergent vegetation to protect the shoreline from erosion. Submerged vegetation has become denser in some areas of the lake, especially protected bays.  Aquatic plants provide critical habitat for fish and compete with nuisance algae for available nutrients in the water. Water clarity at start of the 2007 fish community assessment was 3.0 feet. <br> \n <br> \nPomme de Terre Lake is managed primarily as a walleye fishery. Natural reproduction and supplemental fry stockings sustain the walleye fishery.  Walleye catches during the 2007 survey were much higher than preceding surveys.  Increased catch was attributable to an atypically high capture rate of one- and two-year-old juveniles.  Cohorts of these age groups comprised 66% of the total gillnet catch.  Walleye grow exceptionally fast in Pomme de Terre Lake.  Age-2 walleye averaged 13.4 inches at the first of the year and grew to exceed 16.0 inches at time of capture in August 2007.  Fishing will continue to improve as the stronger 2006 year classes grows to a keeper size in 2008.  <br> \n <br> \nBoth black crappie and white crappie were captured during the 2007 fish community assessment. Abundance indices have varied greatly among surveys in response to reproduction and recruitment inconsistencies.  Trapnet catches were very high during the 2003 survey due to presence of exceptionally high numbers of two-year-old juveniles.  Three age groups were represented in the 2007 population sample, but all three year classes could be described as weak.  Cohorts of the strong 2002 year class were absent in the 2007 catch. The oldest crappie captured was only four years old.  Natural mortality may be very high.  Black crappie catches exceeded that of white crappie.  It appears that white crappie abundance continues a steady decline.  Black crappie grow fast and quickly recruit to the fishery.  Twenty-four percent of the black crappie captured in 2007 exceeded 10.0 inches in length.   <br> \n <br> \nSeasonally poor water clarity, limited vegetated habitat, and water level instability constitute and harsh environment for sight feeding or ambush predators, nesting species, and young gamefish seeking nursery and escape cover from predators.  Northern pike, largemouth bass, bluegill, and yellow perch are able to sustain their presence, but these species have seldom been described as abundant.  Only four northern pike were captured during the 2007 survey. Largemouth bass and bluegill reproductive success was stronger and more consistent from 2001 through 2006.  Modest increases in abundance might be attributable to better water clarity and expansion of aquatic vegetation.  Yellow perch catches were relatively low and did not increase.  Walleye likely keep this prey base at a fairly low level.  Perch have responded by reproducing at a younger age and smaller size.  Few grow large enough to contribute to fishing. <br> \n <br> \nFish species tolerant of existing habitat conditions proliferate in absence of competition and predation from a diversity of gamefishes.  Black bullhead, common carp and white sucker are abundant.   Common carp accounted for nearly 50% of the total weight of fish caught in trapnets during the 2007 survey.  The riverine influence in the fish community is evident in past and present captures of bigmouth buffalo and longnose gar.  Gar were not observed in the 2007 survey catch. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Pomme de Terre Lake is a shallow, 1,758-acre basin located on the Pomme de Terre River between the towns of Elbow Lake and Ashby in Grant County. Mean and maximum depths are 10.0 and 23.0 feet, respectively. Three public access locations are available on Pomme de Terre Lake. Boaters should be aware of numerous shallow rocky areas, especially during periods of low water levels.  These navigation hazards are located mainly along points and in the middle of the southern arm of this basin. The Pomme de Terre River inflows in the northwest corner of this basin and outflows in the southwest corner. The river transports significant amounts of nutrients and sediment into and through the lake. Water quality and clarity can be poor following heavy rainfall events and during the heat of the summer due to suspended sediments and algae blooms. Water clarity at the start of the 2023 survey was 3.0 feet.  Primary management efforts on Pomme de Terre Lake are directed towards Walleye. Natural reproduction sustains this fishery, but Walleye fry are stocked every other year to supplement the population. \n\nA fisheries survey was completed in August 2023 to assess the fish community of Pomme de Terre Lake. The most abundant game fishes were those best adapted to a turbid environment (Walleye and Black Crappie). Walleye catch rates were near all-time highs for Pomme de Terre Lake. Approximately 84% of the Walleye caught in the survey were age 1. This very large year class of Walleye was likely due to natural reproduction from Walleye spawning within the lake or upstream in the river in 2022. Spawning conditions in 2022 must have been ideal, as large year classes of Walleye were also observed in other lakes on the Pomme de Terre River. Most of the Walleye caught in the survey were these younger, smaller fish, which ranged in length from 9 to 13 inches at the time of the survey. These fish should grow to harvestable sizes during 2024 and provide excellent Walleye fishing for the next several years. Black Crappies were moderately abundant and most of them caught in the survey were younger, smaller fish. Most of the crappie were from 5 to 7 inches, but several fish up to 14.5 inches were observed. White Crappies are present, but they are less abundant. Other gamefishes that are sight feeders or dependent on aquatic vegetation during early life stages (Bluegill, Largemouth Bass, Northern Pike) have typically been less abundant in this basin.  However, Bluegill and Largemouth Bass populations have been increasing in recent years. Smaller, younger Bluegill and Largemouth Bass were common in both the 2017 and 2023 surveys. Larger Bluegill and Largemouth Bass are much less abundant, but bass exceeding 19 inches and Bluegill exceeding 9 inches do occur in low numbers. Northern Pike abundance remains low. While typically not very abundant, some large pike have been captured.  The largest measured in 2023 was 33.1 inches. Abundance of larger Yellow Perch remains low, although small Yellow Perch appeared abundant in nearshore sampling conducted during a different survey in 2023. \n\nNear record-low numbers of Black Bullheads were caught in 2023 and catch rates of Common Carp were also lower than average for Pomme de Terre Lake. Yellow Bullhead abundance may be increasing, but still remains relatively low. Freshwater Drum were first documented in Pomme de Terre Lake in the 2017 survey, but none were observed in the 2023 survey. Meanwhile, Freshwater Drum abundance has increased dramatically in downstream lakes. They are thought to have expanded above Crissy Dam in Morris in 2012 during flood conditions. \n\nPomme de Terre Lake was designated as an infested water after the discovery of zebra mussels in 2018. Recreational users should take necessary precautions to prevent the further spread of invasive species. Drain all water and remove all aquatic vegetation from your boat and trailer when leaving any body of water.\n</p>",
