The lake is located about two miles northeast of Isabella. There is a carry-in access at the end of US Forest Service 368 with a 500 foot long trail and wooden steps down to the lake. The current management plan calls for 2,000 fingerling Brook Trout to be stocked annually in the fall. <br> \n <br> \nA survey was completed in October 2022 to monitor the trout population and was the second survey completed after a lake reclamation was performed in 2016. Brook Trout catch was similar to the previous survey with a total of 24 fish sampled. Size of fish ranged from 9 to 14 inches long and averaged about 11 inches and a half a pound. The catch consisted of trout stocked the previous two years indicating adequate growth and survival in recent years. <br> \n <br> \nIt was not unexpected to catch White Suckers during this survey because they were captured in 2019, but the high catch was disappointing because their populations can impact the success of Brook Trout management through competition for food. The lake will continue to be monitored to determine if sucker abundance impacts the growth and survival of stocked Brook Trout.</p>",

Take USFS Road #368 approximately 1 mile to the end of the road (parking for four vehicles).  Then take 500 foot trail, on steep terrain, to the north side of the southwest basin of the lake.  A second access also uses USFS Road #368 for approximately 0.9 mile, then look for an unmarked logging trail (left) that skirts a clear-cut and stops on the hill 180 ft above the lake.  There is a foot path to the lake shore.  This route is suitable for high clearance 4x4 vehicles only, with no regard for the vehicles paint job.  Both routes are open to snowmobile travel.  Designated stream trout lake signs are posted at each access. <br> \n <br> \nRedskin Lake receives moderate fishing pressure in the summer, less in the winter mainly because of limited access.  About 2,000 brook trout fingerlings are stocked in the fall each year in this designated stream trout lake.  The 2010 population assessment found brook trout in above average numbers for the Finland area and within the range of catches in previous investigations.  The average length of the 2010 brook trout sample was 10.0 inches; the largest individual was 14.1 inches with 28% of the catch over 12 inches. <br> \n  <br> \nMany small white suckers are also present in Redskin Lake competing with the brook trout for forage and the anglers' bait. <br> \n</p>",

Automated temperature loggers were suspended at depths of five, ten, fifteen, and twenty feet below the surface over the deepest spot in the lake to record water temperatures hourly throughout the summer. In addition, temperature and dissolved oxygen profiles were collected on several occasions to determine how deep well oxygenated water occurred. <br> \n <br> \nSurvey results indicate summer dissolved oxygen concentrations and water temperatures were favorable for trout in Memegwesi Lake in 2022. Monitoring in 2018 had similar results which suggest the lake has some of the best habitat of the lakes stocked with stream trout in the Finland Area. The lake currently maintains suitable habitat for stream trout throughout the open water season. Habitat conditions will continue to be monitored to evaluate the suitability of Memegwesi Lake for stream trout management. <br> \n</p>",

Approximately 10% of the fish collected were between 14 inches and 16 inches.Indian Lake is a designated stream trout lake that is stocked annually with brook trout fingerlings.  It is one of the more popular brook trout lakes in the Finland area, and is known for producing some quality-size brook trout.  The lake receives heavy fishing pressure on opening weekend of the winter stream trout season.  During the 2001 winter season a few 16 inch, and a 17 inch brook trout, are known to have been caught.</p>",

This survey was conducted at ice out in 2017 to assess whether or not Brook Trout or White Sucker remained in the lake following the reclamation.  At the same time, a test was carried out ensure the rotenone had degraded prior to restocking. <br> \n <br> \nThis survey consisted of one gill net set in each of the two basin of Redskin Lake and a mini trap net (27 x 39 inch trap net with 4 hoops, 2 frames, 1 throat, and a 25 foot lead made from 1/8 inch netting) set near the access.  No fish were sampled in either of the gill nets; one Brook Stickleback and 11 Northern Redbelly Dace were sampled in the mini trap net.  These results suggest it is unlikely that Brook Trout or White Sucker survived the reclamation, but that some minnow species survived.  These minnows may have either been able to find a small area of refuge or may have been more resistant to the rotenone than Brook Trout and White Sucker. <br> \n <br> \nRainbow Trout were used to test if the rotenone had degraded sufficiently to resume trout stocking.  Rainbow Trout were placed in a trap net with the throat sewn shut and checked after 48 hours.  After 48 hours all of the trout in the net were still alive.  Based on the test, the rotenone had degraded to a level that was suitable for trout survival. <br> \n <br> \nRedskin Lake was stocked in the late spring of 2017 with 1,000 catchable sized Rainbow Trout to provide a fishery for the summer of 2017 because no catchable sized Brook Trout were available.  During fall of 2017, 1,000 small Brook Trout were stocked into Redskin Lake; moving forward Brook Trout will be stocked. <br> \n <br> \nRedskin Lake is located in Northcentral Lake County approximately 3.5 miles by road northeast of Isabella  The lake has a surface area of 43 acres and a maximum depth of 25 feet.  From Isabella to access the lake, one turns east on the Wanless Road (USFS Road 172) and proceeds 0.82 miles before turning north onto the Trappers Lake Road (USFS Road 369).  Follow the Trappers Lake Road 1.60 miles before turning east onto USFS Road 914 (4x4 recommended); USFS Road 914 continues for a mile before ending in a parking area and campsite.  From this campsite a trail leads 500 feet and down a set of stairs to the north shore of the lake's southern basin.   <br> \n</p>",

About 72% of the lake is shallower than 15 feet. The lake is accessible through a trail from a nearby logging road. There is one inlet and one outlet, which is dammed near the lake by beavers. Water levels appear to fluctuate about 0.5 feet in a year. Most of the lake is surrounded by high forest land; shoreline marsh areas are absent. Shoal water soils are about 40% muck, 40% sand/gravel, 20% gravel, rubble, and boulders.     At the time of the survey, dissolved oxygen in sufficient amounts for fish life was absent below 17.5 feet in depth. A thermocline was present from 16 feet to 24 feet. Moderate amounts of aquatic vegetation were present, with most plants being in the east section of the lake. The only species of fish taken were Northern Pike, Yellow Perch, and Golden Shiners. Northern Pike and Yellow Perch were taken in numbers greater than the state-wide or watershed medians for these species. Young-of-the-year Northern Pike were observed in the lake and caught in shoreline seining. Spawning, and potential spawning conditions were rated \"fair\" for Walleye, Northern Pike, centrarchids and bass.     Based on local reports, occasional catches of Northern Pike are made from Redskin (Indian) Lake, but fishing has recently been poor.</p>",

The current management plan calls for 2,000 fingerling Brook Trout to be stocked annually in the fall.  <br> \n <br> \nA survey was completed in October 2019 to monitor the fish population after a lake reclamation was performed in 2016. Brook Trout catch was similar to the three most recent surveys completed prior to reclamation with a total of 17 fish sampled. Size of fish was large with an average length of 13.6 inches and weight of about one pound and the largest trout measuring 18.0 inches and 2.4 pounds. Results indicate Brook Trout fingerlings stocked since 2017 have had good growth and should provide good angling opportunities in the near future. <br> \n <br> \nIt was disappointing to catch White Suckers during this survey because their populations can impact the success of Brook Trout management through competition for food. Their presence will likely impact the amount of time we expect to see improved growth and size of Brook Trout. <br> \n</p>",

Consult the current Minnesota Fishing Regulations for rules applicable to designated trout lakes.  Brook Trout fingerlings are stocked annually in Redskin Lake.

To assess these important criteria, four automatic temperature loggers were deployed in the access basin at the deepest location in the lake, they were suspended at depths of 5, 10, 15, and 20 feet from June 20 to October 15, 2018.  Three temperature loggers were placed in the back basin at depths of 5, 10, and 14 feet during the same time period.  Dissolved oxygen checks were conducted throughout the summer at the same location.   <br> \n <br> \nThe results of the investigation indicate that during the summer of 2018, Redskin Lake maintained sufficient oxygen and thermal habitat for the survival of stream trout.

The lake is stocked annually with with brook trout fingerlings, by airplane.  Access for small boat or canoe is by a 500 foot trail, on steep terrain, from a rough logging road.  The lake shoreline is undeveloped federal land.Brook trout have typically been sampled in above average numbers in this lake; however, the catch in the 2003 assessment was lower than usual.  Still, the catch was in the normal range for lakes in this lake class.  Brook trout in the 16 to 18 inch range have been sampled in previous assessments; however, no fish of that size were seen in 2003.  The fish ranged from 7.6 to 14.3 inches (1.3 pounds).  Two fish larger than 11 inches were sampled in 2003.  White sucker have become established in this lake and were abundant in 2003.</p>",
