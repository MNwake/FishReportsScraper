                "narrative": "<p>Brooks Lake is a 96-acre lake located in southwestern Wright County near the City of Cokato. The lake has a maximum depth of 21 feet with a summer water clarity of over five feet. There is a city administered public boat access as well as a fishing pier located within Veterans Memorial Park on the east side of the lake. The Brooks Lake watershed is only 216 acres with land use consisting of 45% open water, 24% residential, 18% cultivated crops, 8% hay/pasture, 3% forest, and 2% wetlands. Emergent vegetation covers 28% of the total shoreline but is confined to the west side of the lake. Brooks Lake has a history of winterkill, with the most recent event occurring in 1992. <br> \n <br> \nA standard survey was completed in 2021 to update fisheries data last collected in 2005. The survey included spring Largemouth Bass electrofishing and summer gill netting and trap netting for all species. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike abundance has historically been low in Brooks Lake. The catch rate in 2021 increased significantly from the previous survey and was two times higher than the expected range for similar lakes. Pike sampled ranged in length from 15 to 31 inches with an average length and weight of 23 inches and three pounds. Anglers should have plenty of opportunity to catch many small (< 26 inches) pike as only 15% of Northern Pike caught were longer than 26 inches and only 2% were longer than 30 inches. <br> \n <br> \nThe catch rate of Largemouth Bass was more than twice the average for the Sauk Rapids Management Area. Anglers should have opportunities to catch quality-sized bass as fish in the survey ranged in length from 5 to 20 inches and averaged 14 inches. Forty percent of the bass sampled were longer than 15 inches. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie catches have been highly variable in Brooks Lake. The catch in 2021 was higher than in 2005 and near the long-term average for the lake. Most of the Black Crappies were small and ranged in length from 5 to 9 inches with an average length of 6 inches. <br> \n <br> \nThe Bluegill catch rate was higher than 2005 and above the range of expected values for lakes similar to Brooks Lake. Bluegill ranged in length from 3 to 8 inches with an average length of 6 inches. Anglers can expect plenty of sunfish action on Brooks Lake; however the average size is small.  <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled in the survey were a single four pound Walleye (which have not been stocked since 1992) and Golden Shiner. <br> \n <br> \nLand and lakeshore owners within the watershed can help improve water quality by using best management practices to reduce run-off and nutrient input to the lake.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Brooks Lake is a small (98 acres), shallow lake located within the City limits of Cokato.  It has a history of winterkill, the last one recorded in the winter of 1991-92.  This was the first lake survey since 1983, although a population assessment was conducted in 1989.  Test netting and electrofishing revealed that principal species are northern pike, largemouth bass, and bluegill.  Northern PikeThe 2005 northern pike catch rate (4.8/gill net) is very near what we would expect for lakes similar to Brooks.  The average weight of northern pike caught in gill nets was  4.0  pounds.  Northern pike ranged in length from 18.7 to 31.5 inches with a mean length of 25.7 inches.  In recent years Brooks Lake has gained a reputation for a small lake that produces above average size northern pike.BluegillThe catch rate of bluegill (22.8/trap net) was less than the previous test netting in 1989 (70.2/trap net) but was near the average for lakes like Brooks.  Growth rates were slower than statewide averages with a seven inch fish being seven years old.  Most bluegill ranged in size from 4.5 to 7.0 inches; the largest was 7.8 inches. Anglers can expect good fishing for smaller bluegill.Black CrappieNo black crappie were sampled in trap nets in 2005.  However, crappies were noted in the creel during the winter of 2004-2005 and a few were observed while electrofishing for largemouth bass.Largemouth BassLargemouth bass were sampled by evening electrofishing at a rate similar to most lakes in the Montrose management area.   Of the catchable size bass (greater than 8 inches), 63 percent were greater than 12 inches.  The average size of bass was 12.3 inches, while the largest bass sampled was 18.3 inches and 8 years old. Anglers report good success fishing for largemouth bass on Brooks Lake. </p>",
