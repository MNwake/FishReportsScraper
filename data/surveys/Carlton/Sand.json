                "narrative": "<p>Sand is a 123 acre lake with 122 (99%) acres of littoral area and a maximum depth of 27 feet. Sand lake is located seven miles northeast of Barnum, MN off Highway #5 and has a County administered, public access.  Sand was last assessed during the summer of 2003.  Sand was surveyed during the summer of 2009 to investigate recent increases in watershield abundance and to update information about fish populations.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike abundance of 3.2 per gillnet lift was down from 2003 (5.8) and was average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Average length was 25.8 inches and growth was average when compared to other Duluth Area lakes.  All year-classes from 1997 to 2007 were represented, except 1999 and 2000.  A few exceptionally large northern pike were also captured in the trapnets, including two over 40 inches in length. <br> \n <br> \nThe black crappie abundance of 1.6 per trapnet lift was up from 2003 (0.3) and was average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Black crappie average length was 6.4 inches and growth was average when compared to other Duluth Area lakes.  All year-classes from 2001 to 2007 were represented, except 2002 and 2004. <br> \n <br> \nThe bluegill abundance of 7.2 per trapnet lift was up from 2003 (3.0) and was average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Bluegill average length was 5.1 inches and growth was average when compared to other Duluth Area lakes.  All year-classes from 2004 to 2007 were represented.  Young-of-the-year (YOY) seining captured 25 YOY bluegill with an average length of 1.3 inches. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch abundance of 55.5 per gillnet lift was up from 2003 (1.3) and above average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Average length of perch was poor at 5.9 inches and growth was below average when compared to other Duluth Area lakes.  All year-classes from 2003 through 2008 were represented in the sample, except 2007.  YOY seining captured 77 YOY yellow perch with an average length of 2.8 inches. <br> \n <br> \nYellow bullhead abundance of 11.8 per gillnet lift was down from 2003 (24.8) but was still above average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Average length of yellow bullheads was 7.8 inches. <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species sampled included black bullhead, pumpkinseed sunfish, Johnny darter, golden shiner and white sucker.    <br> \n <br> \nInformation was collected on aquatic vegetation, substrate and water quality.  Twenty-nine aquatic plant species or species groups were identified along 10 transects.  Watershield was the most frequently found plant (100% of transects) followed by reed canary grass and spikerush (80% and 70% of transects, respectively).  The 2003 assessment documented watershield at 90% of the transects.  Prior to the 2003 survey, watershield was not identified.  An aerial photography analysis revealed that in 2003, 13.2 acres of Sand Lake's surface was covered with watershield.  In 2009, 30.1 acres were covered with watershield, a 56% increase from 2003.  Watershield is a plant that can thrive in low alkalinity waters.  Sand has had alkalinity levels consistently documented below 10 ppm since 1982.  The reason why Sand Lake has seen dramatic differences in the abundance of watershield is unknown and requires further study.  However, recent region wide increases in aquatic plants in the Duluth Area suggests that watershield may be an aquatic plant that can thrive in lakes with low alkalinity and fertility during warm years with longer growing seasons.  Other lakes (Cooks, St. Louis County; Cross, Carlton County) with similar water chemistry are experiencing similar changes in the abundance of watershield. <br> \n <br> \nThe most common substrate types were sand, gravel and muck which were identified along 70%, 60% and 60% of the transects, respectively.  Results of laboratory water analysis indicate Sand is a slightly alkaline, soft water lake with low fertility.  A dissolved oxygen profile revealed an unusually large area of anoxic water in depths greater than 12 feet.  The decomposition of submerged organic material (logs and slash from an old sawmill) in Sand Lake likely contributes to this oxygen depletion. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

Sand lake is located seven miles northeast of Barnum, MN off Highway #5 and has a County administered, public access.  Sand Lake was part of study to determine affects of acid rain.  The primary management species from the 1994 Lake Management Plan was northern pike and secondary management species were bluegill and black crappie.     Northern pike abundance of 5.8 per gillnet lift was average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Mean length was 25.4 inches.  Growth was average with length at age four of 22.7 inches.  Age analysis revealed a strong 1998 year-class and six year-classes represented from 1995 through 2001.     Bluegill abundance of 3.0 per trapnet lift was average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Mean length was 4.9 inches.  Growth was average with length at age four of 4.7 inches.  Age analysis revealed only three year-classes (1998, 1999 and 2001) present.     Black crappie abundance of 0.3 per trapnet lift was below average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Mean length of the three sampled black crappie was 7.7 inches.     Sand Lake was assessed by electrofishing in the spring of 2003.  No largemouth bass were sampled during the assessment.     Yellow perch abundance of 1.3 per gillnet lift was below average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Mean length was 8.0 inches.  Growth was average with length at age four of 5.8 inches.  Age analysis revealed four consecutive year-classes from 1996 through 1999.       Yellow bullhead abundance of 24.8 per gillnet lift was much above average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Mean length of yellow bullhead was 7.9 inches.     Other fish species sampled include black bullhead, golden shiner, pumpkinseed sunfish and white sucker.  Walleye were documented in 1959, but have not been sampled since then.       Information was collected on aquatic vegetation.  Diversity of aquatic plants was moderate with a total of 26 species identified along 10 vegetation transects.  The most abundant species was water shield, which was common along 90% of the transects.  Water shield was not identified from the 1993 lake survey.  All other identified species were considered rare.  </p>",

Sand lake is located seven miles northeast of Barnum, MN off Highway #5 and has a County administered, public access.  Sand was last assessed during the summer of 2009.  Sand was surveyed during the summer of 2016 to update information about fish populations after a substantial winterkill event occurred over the winter of 2012-2013.  In response to the winterkill event, DNR Fisheries stocked the lake with 527 adult Bluegill in the fall of 2015 and 2016.     <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike are the primary management species for Sand Lake.  Northern Pike abundance of 4.8 per gillnet lift was average compared to other similar Minnesota lakes.  Average length was very small at 18.0 inches.  Most Northern Pike captured (88.1%) were from the 2013 year-class.  Anglers should expect good catches of Northern Pike in future years as this strong year-class matures.  One large Northern Pike measuring 33.7 inches was captured in the trapnets. <br> \n <br> \nThe Bluegill abundance of 1.1 per trapnet lift was below average compared to other similar Minnesota lakes.  Bluegill average length was 7.4 inches and growth was slow overall when compared to other Duluth Area lakes.  No Black Crappie were captured during the survey.   <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch abundance of 9.5 per gillnet lift was average compared to other similar Minnesota lakes.  Average length was small at 6.4 inches.  Nearly all Yellow Perch captured (98.6%) were from the 2015 year-class.  One large specimen measuring 10.9 inches was captured and was aged to the 2013 year-class.  </p>",
