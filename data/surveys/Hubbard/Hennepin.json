Hennepin Lake suffers from low winter oxygen levels and occasional partial winterkills.  Only one walleye was taken during 1994 which is much lower than previous surveys.  Northern pike abundance, however, is much higher than previous surveys at 12.4 per set.  The average size of northern pike sampled during 1994 was 19.3 inches and 2.0 pounds.  Only one largemouth bass was sampled during 1994.  This species will not do well if winter oxygen levels continue to be low.  Black crappie appears to be the species faring well in Hennepin Lake at the present with mean length of about 9 inches and mean weight of 0.5 pounds.  The bluegills have done well at times as in 1985 but now their numbers are low and could again do well if oxygen levels are adequate for a long period of time.  Yellow perch are abundant now with a mean weight of 0.4 pounds with 22% of the samples 10.0 inches or greater.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Hennepin Lake is located one mile southeast of Becida in northern Hubbard County.  Hennepin is a shallow lake with a surface area of 407 acres and a maximum depth of 14 feet.  Except for a narrow hole, most of the lake is less than 5 feet in depth.  There is a state-owned public access with an earthen ramp located on the west shore of the lake.  Development on Hennepin is limited to the northern portion of the lake with the shoreline on the southern half of the lake undeveloped tax-forfeited land.  Due to the shallow depth, Hennepin Lake is subject to periodic \"winterkill\".  Winterkill usually happens during long winters with heavy snowfall.  Dissolved oxygen production through aquatic plant photosynthesis is limited due to snow and ice blocking sunlight from penetrating the water column.  At the same time, decaying aquatic vegetation on the lake bottom uses oxygen causing dissolved oxygen levels in the lake to drop.  Shallow lakes with heavy aquatic vegetation growth are more likely to winterkill than are deep-water lakes.  Gamefish such as largemouth bass, bluegill, and walleye are less tolerant of low oxygen levels than are bullheads and northern pike.  Winterkills can be severe or just a partial kill depending on the severity of the oxygen depletion.  Fish species and abundance in Hennepin has fluctuated with these winterkill events.  Lakes that suffer from periodic winterkills often produce a \"boom and bust\" fishery.  Fishing is generally poor for a few years after a winterkill, but if a lake such as Hennepin can go several years without a winterkill, there can be exceptional fishing. <br> \n <br> \nThe Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical and chemical characteristics.  Hennepin is in lake class 39.  Other area lakes in this same classification include: Paine Lake (southwest of Lake George), Peysenki (five miles east of Park Rapids), and Portage (three miles northwest of Park Rapids). <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike were abundant, with the gillnet catch rate the highest recorded for all surveys on Hennepin dating back to 1973.  Northern pike abundance in past surveys has fluctuated from low to high numbers.  Sampled northern pike had an average length and weight of 19.2 inches and 2.0 pounds with fish measured up to 35.0 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nWalleye were sampled in low numbers, similar to other surveys since 1990.  Walleye abundance in the 1970 and 1980 surveys fluctuated from low to high numbers.  The walleye population in Hennepin is maintained by walleye fry stocking.  While not considered a \"classic\" walleye type lake, the walleye population in Hennepin does provide a bonus species to the northern pike and panfish populations.  Periodic winterkills and walleye fry stockings after these events can sometimes establish a fishable walleye population when the conditions are right. <br> \n <br> \nThe panfish fishery in Hennepin has been \"boom and bust\", influenced by the frequency and severity of winterkills.  Panfish abundance and species composition has changed since the mid 1980's.  Black crappie and pumpkinseed were not sampled prior to 1989 and bluegill were not sampled prior to 1985.  The 2006 survey showed an abundant bluegill and pumpkinseed population and moderate numbers of black crappie.  Anglers will find bluegill in the 6-7 inch size range and black crappie in the 8-10 inch size range.  A yellow perch population is also present with some perch an acceptable size for angling.  Anglers will also find a largemouth bass population comprised mainly of smaller fish in the 12-15 inch size range. <br> \n <br> \nTypical of lakes that have periodic winterkills, Hennepin has had an abundant bullhead population.  Brown bullhead were sampled in high numbers in the 2006 survey. <br> \n</p>",

A public access is located on the western shore of the lake, off of 470th street.  <br> \n <br> \nThe Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics. Hennepin is in Lake Class 39. Class 39 lakes are generally shallow, have a very high littoral area, and have regularly shaped shorelines. Other class 39 lakes in the Park Rapids area include: First and Fourth Crow Wing, Ham, Hungryman, Loon, Minnie, Paine, Peysenski, Portage, Rice, Shallow, Stocking, Upper Twin and Wolf. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers can expect to find an abundant population of northern pike in Hennepin. The average length and weight of northern pike was 21 inches and 2 pounds, with pike measured up to 32 inches.  Yellow perch were sampled in low numbers compared to other similar lakes. The yellow perch can provide a good forage base for northern pike and walleyes.  Yellow perch also provide angling opportunities for the largest perch, up to 11 inches.  Only one largemouth bass was sampled in 2013, which was much lower than past surveys.  Anglers will find a healthy bluegill population on Hennepin, with most fish in the 6-8 inch size range. Pumpkinseeds were also sampled in good numbers, and had a similar size range to the bluegills.  Walleye abundance was similar to past surveys, but low compared to other similar lakes.  Walleye size was great for anglers with an average length of 21 inches. <br> \n <br> \nCurrently no aquatic invasive species (AIS) have been identified in Hennepin. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Hennepin Lake is located one mile southeast of Becida in northern Hubbard County.  Hennepin is a shallow lake with a surface area of 407 acres and a maximum depth of 14 feet.  Except for one narrow hole, most of the lake is less than 5 feet in depth.  There is a state-owned public access with an earthen ramp located on the west shore of the lake.  Development on Hennepin is limited to the northern portion of the lake with the shoreline on the southern half of the lake undeveloped tax-forfeited land.  Due to the shallow depth, Hennepin Lake is subject to periodic \"winterkill\".  Winterkill usually happens during long winters with heavy snowfall.  Oxygen production through photosynthesis is limited due to snow and ice blocking sunlight from penetrating the water column.  At the same time decaying aquatic vegetation on the lake bottom uses oxygen, causing oxygen levels in the lake to drop.  Shallow lakes with heavy aquatic vegetation growth are more likely to winterkill than are deep-water lakes.  Gamefish such as largemouth bass, bluegill, and walleye are less tolerant of low oxygen levels than are bullheads and northern pike. Winterkills can be severe or just a partial kill depending on the severity of the oxygen depletion.  Fish species and abundance in Hennepin has fluctuated with these winterkill events.  Lakes that suffer from periodic winterkills often produce a \"boom and bust\" fishery.  Fishing is generally poor for a few years after a winterkill, but if a lake such as Hennepin can go several years without a winterkill there can be exceptional fishing.The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical and chemical characteristics.  Hennepin is in lake class 39.  Other area lakes in this same classification include: Paine Lake (southwest of Lake George), Peysenki (five miles east of Park Rapids), and Portage (three miles northwest of Park Rapids).The walleye catch of 1.4 walleye/gillnet is below the range \"typical\" for this lake class and below the management goal of 5.0 walleye/gillnet.  Two other surveys in the 1990s have had similar walleye abundance.  Walleye abundance in historical surveys has flucuated from low to very high numbers.  Sampled walleye in the 1999 survey ranged in length from 14.3 to 17.1 inches.  The walleye population in Hennepin is maintained by stocking walleye fry in even years.Northern pike were sampled in low numbers (3.4/gillnet).  Northern pike abundance in historical surveys has fluctuated from low to high numbers.  Northern pike were small with an average length and weight of 17.9 inches and 1.3 pounds.  Northern pike up to 28.3 inches were sampled.  Northern pike growth rates were slow when compared to other class 39 lakes. The panfish fishery in Hennepin has been \"boom and bust\", influenced by the frequency and severity of winterkills.  Panfish abundance and species composition has changed since the mid 1980's, with black crappies and pumpkinseed abundance increasing.  Black crappie and pumpkinseed were not sampled in surveys prior to 1989 and bluegill were not sampled prior to 1985.  The 1999 survey showed an abundant black crappie population, but size of fish was small.  Two strong year classes of black crappie (6 and 8 inch fish) were present.  These year classes could provide good fishing in a few years if conditions are favorable.  Bluegill and pumpkinseed were sampled in moderate abundance, but average size was small, near 5.0 inches for both species.  Hennepin has occasionally produced yellow perch large enough to be acceptable to the angler, but the average size was small in 1999 (6.3 inches).Typical of lakes that have periodic winterkills, Hennepin has had an abundant bullhead population.  However, brown bullhead abundance in 1999 was much lower than past surveys.</p>",
