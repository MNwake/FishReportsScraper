                "narrative": "<p>Eagle Lake is located northeast of Mankato north of Highway 14 and south of Blue Earth County Highway 26.  A fishery survey was conducted on Eagle Lake in 2004 to assess the fish community and aquatic habitat.  Low oxygen conditions occurred in Eagle Lake in early 2001 which resulted in substantial winterkill of fish.  Following the winterkill walleye fry and black crappie and yellow perch adults were stocked.  In the 2004 survey black bullhead were the most abundant species in both gill and trap net catches.  Black bullhead in the gill nets were mostly around 5 inch and those in the trap nets were around 5 to 7 inches long.  Gill net catches of walleye and northern pike were fairly high.  Most walleye were around 10 to 20 inches and northern pike were between 20 and 30 inches long.  Both the northern pike and the walleye were mostly from the 2001 year class - age 3 in 2004.  The northern pike were naturally spawned and the walleye were from fry stocking.  Black crappie were fairly common with most around 6 to 7 inches long.  Other species present include carp, channel catfish, freshewater drum, white sucker, bigmouth buffalo, bluegill, golden shiner, white crappie, yellow bullhead, and yellow perch.A public boat launch is located on the north shore on county highway 26.  The county park here provides good shore fishing opportunity.  The Sakatah State Trail bisects Eagle Lake, running between the north and south basins.  Cattails are abundant along much of the shore, but submergent plant were limited to depths less than 3 feet.  Water clarity is generally low.  Water to around 10 feet deep occurs in the middle of the northern portion of Eagle Lake.  Other areas are fairly shallow - about 1 to 5 ft.</p>",

GOOD WAE FISHING HAS BEEN REPORTED OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS, WITH LIMITS BEING CAUGHT IN THE SUMMER AND FALL OF 1989.  WAE WERE NETTED IN THE SPRING OF 1990 FOR A SOURCE OF SPAWN, WITH 2,000 FISH REMOVED.  THE WAE CATCH AVERAGED 8.75/GILL NET WITH ALL FISH SAMPLED IN GILL NETS FROM THE 1986 YEAR CLASS.  ONE YEARLING WAE WAS CAUGHT IN A TRAP NET INDICATING SOME NATURAL REPRODUCTION OCCURRING.  A FEW OF THE YEAR WAE WERE SAMPLED IN SHORELINE SEINING, WHICH PROBABLY ARE FROM THE 1990 FRY STOCKING.  BLB WERE THE MOST ABUNDANT SPECIES AVERAGING 167.25/GILL NET AND 641.00/TRAP NET.  MOST OF THE BLB APPEAR TO BE OF ONE AGE CLASS MEASURING 4.5-5.4 INCHES.
