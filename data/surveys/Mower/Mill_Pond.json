                "narrative": "<p>Louise Mill Pond is a small 26.0 acre impoundment on the Upper Iowa River near the Town of Leroy in Mower County. The lake is situated in Lake Louise State Park and is accessible through the state park. Lake Louise does not have a boat ramp but the state park provides limited access for boats. Louise Mill Pond has a maximum depth of 8.0 feet and had turbid water during the assessment. The MNDNR does not stock fish in Louise Mill Pond, as populations are maintained through natural reproduction. The main sport fish available in Louise Mill Pond is black crappie. A population assessment was conducted on 9-4-2012 to monitor the fish community in Louise Mill Pond using 6 trap nets.  <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappies comprised 82% of the total catch in the survey and were captured at a rate of 46.3/trap net, which is a high catch rate compared to similar lakes. Invariable catch rates (53.8, 42.9, 44.7/trap net) during three previous surveys dating back to 1988 suggest that the crappie population in Louise Mill Pond is stable. The size structure of black crappies was good with a broad range of sizes present. Black crappies averaged 7.4 inches in length and had minimum and maximum lengths of 4.8 and 11.9 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nBluegill, common carp, golden redhorse, hybrid sunfish, largemouth bass, northern hogsucker, orangespotted sunfish, quillback, and white sucker were present but occurred in low numbers.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Healthy populations of both black and white crappie are present in Lake Louise.  Trapnet catch rate of black crappie was above average; 21.4/net with fish averaging 7.6 inches.  However numbers have declined from the 1988 survey (53.8/net).  Most black crappie were from 7 to 8.5 inches with few >10 inches.  Age 1-5 black crappie were collected with age 3 fish averaging 9 inches.  Catch of white crappie increased from 5.3/net in 1988 to 8.9/net in 1993, also above average for this lake class.  Average length of white crappie was larger (8.3 inches) with 13% >10 inches.  Ages 1-6 were collected with age 1 fish most abundant.  Growth of white crappie was faster with age 3 fish averaging 10 inches.     Black bullhead abundance declined from 59.1/net (1988) to just 1.1/net (1993).  Yellow bullheads were also less abundant; 3.6/net in 1988 declining to 0.6/net in 1993.  Carp abundance (0.4/net) was similar to 1988 catch of 0.9/net.     Electrofishing was conducted for the first time on Lake Louise in 1993 therefore comparisons cannot be made with past surveys.  Catch rate of largemouth bass was low at 3/hr.  Average length and weight was 14.5 inches and 1.9 lbs.  Largemouth bass ages 2-6 were collected.  Two smallmouth bass were captured; 16.7 inches (2.2 lbs) and 8.5 inches (0.3 lbs).     Overall, catch of all species (except white crappie) declined from the 1988 survey.  The crappie population is healthy but dominated by small fish.  Gamefish reproduction is limited as no young-of-year were collected.  Lake Louise is filling in fast and fish habitat is rapidly being lost.  Fish populations are expected to decline in the future.  </p>",
