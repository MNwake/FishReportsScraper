Fish as large as 25 inches were taken, but most were under 18 inches in length.  Although Kemo Lake has been regularly stocked with lake trout, natural reproduction contributed substantially to the 2003 catch.  As much as 63% of the 2003 catch may have been produced naturally, based on observations of fin clipped (stocked) fish. Lake trout growth rates had been slightly faster than average for this area, despite the lack of coldwater forage species in this lake.A few splake were taken in 2003.  All were five-year-old fish that had moved into Kemo Lake from Pine Lake, where they have been stocked annually for many years.  The lone brook trout taken in 2003 could also have come from Pine Lake, or it may have been a splake misidentified as a brook trout (their appearance can be almost identical).White sucker were abundant, but many were small and may have provided forage for lake trout at certain times of the year.</p>",

Kemo Lake was rehabilitated in 1964 and has been regularly stocked with lake trout from 1967 to 2018 and managed primarily for lake trout. The only other gamefish known to be present (at times) are splake, which can reach Kemo Lake from nearby Pine Lake, where they are regularly stocked. The 2023 standard survey was the first of two surveys conducted to evaluate the lake trout population.  <br> \n <br> \nLake trout abundance was the lowest since 1997, and below the current management goal. However, this is above the mean for similar lakes in the area and introduced, naturally reproducing lake trout populations are quite rare as supplemental stocking efforts have usually been unsuccessful. Lake trout ranged from 7.9 to 21.3 inches with a mean length of 16.2 inches and 1.64 lbs/fish. Aging results indicate the presence of 11-year classes, with at least 6 of those being naturally reproduced. The oldest fish was 17 years old. Growth rates were similar to other area lakes but slowed considerably after reaching 18 inches. Slow growth or a lack of large sized lake trout is common in lakes that lack a cold-water forage species like cisco or rainbow smelt and lake trout consume mostly invertebrates. Lake trout still provide good angling opportunities in Kemo Lake. <br> \n <br> \nSplake abundance was the highest ever been recorded in recent surveys. Splake ranged from 8.5 to 19.7 inches. Aging results showed fish from 3-year classes were present at ages 1, 2, and 5. Growth rates were similar to area lakes stocked with splake. Currently splake provide an additional angling opportunity with good sized fish.  <br> \n <br> \nWhite sucker relative abundance appeared to be slightly below historical catches with some larger fish present.  <br> \n <br> \nCook County, Minnesota lakes continue to be susceptible to aquatic invasive species introductions. Invasive species have the potential to significantly alter fish communities and overall lake health. Anglers should clean watercraft and fishing gear, drain all water, and dispose of unused bait in the trash to prevent accidental introductions.  <br> \n</p>",

Although fish as long as 26 inches were taken, most of the catch consisted of small, young fish.  Based on stocking fin clips observed, natural reproduction could have accounted for as much as 64% of the lake trout catch, with stocking contributing most to the catch of younger fish.   Lake trout growth had been slow.  Lake trout of ages 2-6 were 11% to 29% shorter for their age than averages for this area. <br> \n <br> \nSplake were caught at the north and south ends of the lake, and on the east and west shores, so were well distributed within the lake.  They probably moved upstream into Kemo Lake after having been stocked into Pine Lake.  Three year classes were represented in the catch: 2002-2004 (ages 3-5).  Growth rates appeared to have been slow for the age-3 fish, but about average for the area for the age-5 fish. <br> \n <br> \nThe white sucker catch fell midway within the range established by the previous three assessments, but greatly exceeded the third quartile (5.63 fish/set) for shallow sets in this area.  The average size of white sucker was somewhat small for this area. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Kemo Lake is managed primarily for lake trout, and has been regularly stocked with lake trout since 1967.  The long range goal for the species in the current (2009) lake management is to maintain a population with a minimum gill net catch of 4.0 fish/set, with some fish over 20 inches present.  There has been significant natural reproduction of lake trout in this lake, and this was the first of two surveys scheduled in the 2009 plan to help determine whether continued lake trout stocking was necessary. <br> \n <br> \nLake trout were abundant, but smaller than usual in Kemo Lake in 2012.  However, the 2012 lake trout gill net catch met the long range goal for the species, and a few fish larger than 20 inches were present.  The catch was similar to past catches observed in this lake, and exceeded the normal range for a lake of this type.  The mean weight for lake trout taken in gill nets was one of the lower means seen in this lake historically, and fell below the normal range.  The low mean weight was due largely to the dominance of a strong 2009 year class.  Fish from that age class had a mean length at capture of just 11.6 inches.  Several year classes contributed to the 2012 catch, including several that had been produced entirely naturally, and three that had been supplemented by stocking.  Stocked (fin clipped) lake trout accounted for 33% of the 2012 catch.  They accounted for half of the fish taken in the strong 2009 year class, two of the three five-year-old fish taken, and two of the seven seven-year-old fish collected.   <br> \n <br> \nLake trout growth had been slow.  Seven-year-old lake trout reached an average length of 14.0 inches at the end of their seventh year, compared to an area average of 19.6 inches in lakes of this type. <br> \n <br> \nSplake collected in Kemo Lake in 2012 had entered the lake from Pine Lake, where they have been regularly stocked.  Splake have often been taken in recent assessments of Kemo Lake.  While they provide a bonus for anglers fishing the lake, their presence also indicates that the lake is vulnerable to infestation by any exotic or undesirable fish species that becomes established in Pine Lake.  Pine Lake is accessible by road, and already supports an expanding bluegill population.  Walleye and smallmouth bass have been found in Pine Lake, although neither species appears to have become established there yet. <br> \n <br> \nThe white sucker gill net catch (deep and shallow sets combined) exceeded the third quartile for the lake class, but was similar to past catches seen in this lake.  Although white sucker might compete with lake trout for invertebrate forage, the two species seem to coexist with few problems in many of the area's native lake trout lakes.  Many of the white sucker taken in this assessment were small enough to have served as prey for the larger lake trout present. <br> \n <br> \nKemo Lake provided suitable conditions for lake trout (temperature < 55 F, oxygen > 5 ppm) at depths of about 24 to 45 ft in late July 2012.  Although conditions probably deteriorated further as the summer progressed, it seemed likely that some suitable habitat would have persisted through the summer.  Kemo Lake's status as a low-productivity lake was confirmed by laboratory analysis results that measured low levels of total phosphorus (0.008 ppm), total dissolved solids (64 ppm), and chlorophyll a (5.2 ppb).  Low productivity allows Kemo Lake to maintain adequate oxygen through the summer in the deep cold waters required to support lake trout. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Kemo Lake was rehabilitated in 1964, and has been regularly stocked with Lake Trout since 1967.  The only other gamefish known to be present (at times) are Splake, which can reach Kemo Lake from nearby Pine Lake, where they are regularly stocked.  The current (2009) lake management plan for Kemo Lake established long range goals for Lake Trout of maintaining a minimum gill net catch of 4.0 fish/set (in deep and shallow sets combined), with some fish up to 20 inches present.  That plan reduced the stocking frequency in this lake from every other year to every fourth year, due to evidence for good natural reproduction in the lake.  This was the second of two surveys scheduled in the 2009 plan to determine whether natural reproduction alone was capable of sustaining the lake trout fishery in this lake.  The first survey was completed in 2012.  Now that both surveys have been completed, we will be using that information to revise the current management plan in 2020. <br> \n <br> \nLake Trout appeared to have been abundant in Kemo Lake in 2018, and although most were small, fish over 20 inches in length could be found.  The combined Lake Trout catch in deep and shallow gill net sets in 2018 (6.83 fish/set) easily met the goal set in the 2009 plan, and was one of the highest seen in this lake since 1970.  Based on the lack of stocking fin clips seen on fish taken in the survey, it appeared the catch consisted mostly of naturally produced fish.  Ten year classes contributed to the 2018 catch, with the strongest apparently produced in 2016, 2013, and 2012.  Although Lake Trout were stocked in 2013, only four of the 11 fish of that age sampled bore stocking fin clips.  No stocking had been done in 2016 or 2012.  Growth of Lake Trout collected in 2018 appeared to have been slow.  Fish reached a mean length of 13.1 inches at the end of their fifth year, compared to an area average of 14.9 inches.  Slow growth was likely due to the lack of cold-water forage species (a largely invertebrate diet) and high competition between Lake Trout for forage of any kind.  White Sucker may have competed with Lake Trout for invertebrate forage, and did not appear to be an important forage species themselves. <br> \n <br> \nCatches of Splake and White Sucker seen in 2018 were typical for this lake historically.  Splake taken in 2018 were small, but larger fish have been reported by anglers. <br> \n</p>",
