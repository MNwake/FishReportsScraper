It is recommended that Walleye fry stocking be changed to every third year; next stocking to be 1986 if deemed necessary from assessment netting and from which the number can be determined. Determination of natural reproduction success will be made in off years by young-of-the-year trapnetting. If natural reproduction or fry stocking is inadequate from 4,000 to 5,000 Walleye fingerlings can be stocked from area rearing ponds. Fingerling stocking to be done pending determination of fry success.     A resurvey is scheduled for 1985 to include young-of-the-year sampling of Walleyes. Last survey or assessment netting was 1976. Current information is therefore needed on fish populations; especially Muskellunge, Walleye and Smallmouth Bass. To maintain the muskie population additional adults, if needed are available for transfer from Harris Lake. However, if a commissoner's order is not formulated to allow taking of muskies 30\" or over, as allowed by present legislative law, then the lake should be removed from the designated muskie list and managed for Walleyes only.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Dumbbell Lake is in the Superior National Forest approximately 4 miles east of Isabella. The 437acre lake has a littoral area of 202 acres and a maximum depth of 40 feet. A Secchi disc was visible to a depth of 8.5 feet. There is a U.S. Forest Service access with a concrete ramp on the west side of the lake and two remote campsites on the lake. There are seasonal cabins on the north and east ends of the lake, but most of the shoreline is publicly owned and undeveloped. For many years Dumbbell Lake was listed as a designated muskellunge lake but was removed from the list in 2004. The minimum size regulation of 40 inches for muskellunge is still in effect in this lake. <br> \n <br> \nThe fish community in Dumbbell Lake is comprised of walleyes, muskellunge, smallmouth bass, yellow perch, white suckers, and rock bass. The lake is managed primarily for walleyes and is stocked with walleye fry on a two out of every four year rotation. <br> \n <br> \nIn 2006 walleye were sampled in average numbers, although the catch rate was substantially lower than the above average catches seen in past assessments. Mean size was 1.1 pounds, which is normal for the lake class and typical of the mean size in past assessment.    <br> \n <br> \nThe muskellunge catch rate was below normal in this assessment but comparable with catch rates in recent assessments. Muskellunge catch rates in this lake have typically been near or slightly below the normal range for the lake class. The largest muskellunge collected in 2006 was 28.5 inches, although 40-inch fish have been sampled in other assessments. Dumbbell Lake is popular with muskellunge anglers who enjoy the high catch rate for sub-legal size fish.      <br> \n <br> \nSmallmouth bass were sampled in average numbers, as they have been in past assessments, although the catch was somewhat lower than in 2003. Smallmouth bass collected in past assessments have typically been smaller than average for the lake class, and although the mean weight increased somewhat in this assessment (0.44 pounds), it was still below normal. The longest smallmouth bass sampled in 2006 was 11.1 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch were sampled in average numbers, although the catch was somewhat lower than in past assessments. A few yellow perch 8.0- 8.5 inches were sampled, but most were too small to interest anglers. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>This survey examined the waters of Dumbbell Lake for baseline zooplankton composition and abundance and to determine if Dumbbell Lake is infested with spiny water flea, an aquatic invasive species.  This invasive species was first found in Lake Superior in 1988, thought to be introduced through ballast waters.  Spiny water flea has since spread to the inland lakes and rivers including those in the Duluth (1997), Tower (2007), and Grand Marais (2007) Fisheries Management Areas.  In the Finland Area, Dumbbell Lake was selected as an annual sample site (beginning in 2008) because it is used as an airplane loading site for trout stocking to other inland lakes.  Should spiny water flea be present in Dumbbell Lake, aerial stocking could be a vector, exposing other waters to possible infestation. <br> \n <br> \nDuring the annual mid-August sampling event three vertical plankton tows were made with a 50 cm diameter net with 150 micron mesh to a depth of 30 feet.  These hauls were preserved and sent to the St. Paul lab for quantitative analysis.  The samples taken during August 2017 at Dumbbell Lake did not contain spiny water flea. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A standard survey was completed in August 2018 to monitor the status of the fish community and associated aquatic habitat, and evaluate the current stocking strategy. Walleye fry are stocked in two consecutive years followed by two non-stocked years which are used to estimate the contribution of natural reproduction to the population.  <br> \n <br> \nThe lake bottom is primarily rubble and boulder in the main basins of the lake with soft substrates in protected bays. Aquatic vegetation is not widespread and most of the plant beds are located in the bays. There are several points and unmarked offshore reefs with shallow rocky areas that are a hazard to watercraft. Boaters should use caution navigating the various structures around the lake.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye catch was above the normal range for this type of lake but similar to the 2009 assessment and to the historic average. Size ranged from 7.7 to 28.1 inches with an average of 12.0 inches and 0.65 pounds. Walleye less than 12 inches long made up over half of the sample while fish greater than 14 inches accounted for 11% of the catch. Age analysis identified 11 year classes with fish up to 12 years old sampled. Fish grow slowly and reach a length of 12.1 inches at age-4 compared to the area average of 13.0 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nMuskellunge are not sampled well in standard survey nets, but a small number were captured during the survey. Size averaged 32 inches and about seven pounds. The lake does not produce trophy sized fish, but anglers have an excellent opportunity to catch this hard fighting predator. A separate targeted survey of the Muskellunge population was completed in spring of 2018 and contains more detailed information about their status.  <br> \n <br> \nSmallmouth Bass catch was above the normal range in gill nets and trap nets. Fish up to 14 inches long were captured although standard sampling gear does not always collect a representative size distribution of the population. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Stocking recommendations are that no further trout be stocked. An idea which may be tried is to stock with as many fingerling or adult Northern Pike as possible. This species, if the stocking is heavy enough, should be able to exert some control over the present roughfish populations within a few years,. When it is determined that the Northern Pike have assumed control , stocking with Smallmouth Bass may be attempted. Because of the proximity of Walleye lakes in the area, stocking with this species is not recommended.     Control of fish populations to improve the lake for Rainbow Trout fishing is not believed feasible. Poisoning the lake to remove the roughfish populations would be more expensive then use of the lake would warrent. A rough estimate of the cost of poisoning, places it in the neighborhood of $5,000. Reestablishment of the roughfish populations would be easily accomplished by fish coming up the outlet stream.     Reduction in numbers of roughfish is not practical. Canadian investigators have found with similar problems, that removal of large quantities of White Sucker from trout lakes increased the survival of young fish.</p>",

Walleye averaged about 1.0 pound with fish in the 12 to 14 inch range the most abundant in the sample.  Dumbbell Lake is stocked on a 2 of 4 year rotation with 250,000 walleye fry/stocking.Muskellunge were fairly abundant and reproducing in the lake.  The largest individual collected in the 2000 assessment was 36.4 inches; however, anglers occasionally report catching fish over 40 inches.  The lake does not have a reputation for trophy muskellunge but it is well known for fast action for fish in the 26 to 36 inch range.  Dumbbell Lake is a designated muskellunge lake with a 40 inch minimum size limit.Smallmouth bass abundance was in the normal range compared to similar lakes; however, the size was below average.  Fish collected in the 2000 assessment averaged 9.5 inches and the largest individual collected was 11.2 inches.Yellow perch were present in average numbers however their small size made them unacceptable to most anglers.  Fish up to 9.4 inches were collected, but less than 10% were larger than 8.0 inches.</p>",

B.C has since spread to the inland lakes and rivers including those in the Duluth (1997), Tower (2007), and Grand Marias (2007) Fisheries Management Areas.  In the Finland Area, Dumbbell Lake was selected as an annual sample site (sampling began in 2008) since it is used as an airplane loading site for trout stocking to other inland lakes.  Should spiny water flea be present in Dumbbell Lake, aerial stocking could be a vector, exposing others waters to possible infestation. <br> \n <br> \nDuring the annual mid August sampling three vertical plankton tows were made with a 51cm net to a depth of 32 feet.  These hauls were preserved and then sent to the St. Paul Lab for quantitative analysis. The samples taken during August of 2011 at Dumbbell Lake did not contain spiny water flea. <br> \n <br> \nThe fish community in Dumbbell Lake includes walleye, muskellunge, smallmouth bass, yellow perch, white sucker, and rock bass. An established population of spiny water flea could potentially be detrimental to the walleye population as well as the other fish species as spiny water flea are thought to out compete Daphina species, which are a preferred food  of age-0 walleye. <br> \n</p>",

No muskellunge have been stocked in Dumbbell Lake since 1995: however, both strains have maintained populations through natural reproduction.  Based on identifying characteristics of each strain, the blending of these two populations appears to be underway.  Identification based on coloration and dark patterns has become very difficult. <br> \n <br> \nThe muskellunge catch in 2006 was similar to catches in previous spring assessments.  The average size was 28.9 inches (5.8 pounds).  No individuals over 40 inches were sampled in assessment nets and reports of 40 inch plus muskellunge caught by anglers have been rare.  Not known for producing trophy size muskellunge, anglers do find a lot of action fishing muskellunge on Dumbbell Lake. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Walleye numbers sampled in Dumbbell Lake in 2009 were well above average for the lake class, similar to results in previous investigations.  The average length was 11.1 inches with 14% of the catch greater than 14 inches.  A large sample of young (ages 2 and 3) walleyes reduced the average length calculated from the total catch.  Since changing the walleye fry stocking regimen in 1999, two consecutive years out of four years, the stocking blanks have indicated significant natural reproduction supporting the adult walleye population.  Dumbbell Lake is a structure anglers dream with many offshore reefs and humps dropping sharply into deep water. <br> \n   <br> \nMuskellunge numbers were above average for the lake class with an average length of 30.1 inches.  The largest musky sampled was 37.5 inches in this assessment, although two 40+ inch muskellunge were measured in the spring 2009 trap net assessment.  Population assessment data indicated natural reproduction was sufficient to maintain the musky fishery.  Dumbbell Lake is known as a good musky fishing lake with many fish in the 4 to 8 pound range available for fast action, although legal length muskellunge are rare. <br> \n <br> \nAverage numbers of small (average length of 6.7 inches) smallmouth bass were present in the 2009 population assessment.  However, bass populations are difficult to assess in standard survey nets and anglers using live bait (especially crawlers and leeches) will find there are ample smallmouth bass in Dumbbell Lake. <br> \n <br> \nAbove average numbers of small sized (average length of 6.2 inches) yellow perch were also sampled with rock bass, white sucker and four minnow species completing the species list sampled in the 2009 assessment. <br> \n <br> \nThe primary public access to Dumbbell Lake is a concrete ramp on the west side of the lake, off of USFS Road #172, with parking for eight vehicles.  A second access site on the south shore, along USFS #172, is a loop road with a USFS airplane dock and accessible fishing pier; there is parking for a few vehicles.  There are a couple of unmarked boulders, offshore just below the lake surface, in both basins of Dumbbell Lake that should be avoided by watercraft.  A contour map of the lake bottom would benefit the angler and navigator on Dumbbell Lake. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Dumbbell Lake is in Lake County about six miles east of Isabella and within the Superior National Forest. There is a public access with concrete log boat ramp and dock with parking for several trailer rigs located on Forest Service Road 172. There is also a picnic area with airplane dock and fishing pier located further east along the same road. Additional facilities include two boat-in backcountry campsites. The lake supports popular fisheries for Muskellunge and Walleye. The current lake management plan calls for Walleye fry stocking in two consecutive years of every four.  <br> \n <br> \nThe 2023 Walleye catch was above the normal range for similar lakes for the fourth consecutive survey and met the goal of at least 14.0 fish per gill net identified in the current management plan. The size distribution of the catch indicates good angling opportunities with an average size of 14.3\" long and 1.23 pounds and 10% greater than 20\" long. Age analysis determined less than half the Walleye caught were from stocked years including the 2020 naturally produced year class, which was the most abundant. The current management plan calls for the current stocking strategy to be thoroughly evaluated after the next scheduled standard survey in 2028.  <br> \n <br> \nMuskellunge are not sampled well in standard survey gear, but a small number were caught in gill nets in 2023. Targeted spring trap netting has been used in the past to monitor the population but could not be completed in conjunction with the standard survey due to the late ice-out of area lakes. Dumbbell Lake has supported an abundant population of moderate sized Musky for the last several decades and should continue to provide anglers with good opportunities to catch and release this popular species. <br> \n <br> \nSmallmouth Bass and Rock Bass are also part of the fish community and have historically been captured in high numbers during fisheries assessments. The size structure of both populations is poor, but anglers may appreciate their abundance when more finicky species are not cooperating. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of the Muskellunge population was conducted in spring of 2018 shortly after ice-out using large frame trap nets. Experience from six previous assessments allowed staff to focus effort in the most productive areas of the lake. This resulted in the highest catch rate to date and 174 individual fish examined, as some fish were captured more than once. The average size was also the highest of any of the previous assessments at 31\" and 6.76 pounds. Although a majority of the fish were quality sized, only one fish greater than 40\" long was sampled during the survey. <br> \n <br> \nInterestingly, the largest Muskellunge sampled in 2018 had a clipped pectoral fin. A review of records determined the fish was from the last time fingerling Muskellunge were stocked into the lake in 1995 which indicated the fish was 23 years old. This provides a good reminder that fish can live a considerable amount of time. Analysis of scale samples determined the current population is primarily the result of natural reproduction but a few of these old stocked fish may still persist.  <br> \n <br> \nThe current statewide minimum size limit of 54\" for Muskellunge protects the entire population in Dumbbell Lake. While the lake is not known for producing trophy sized fish, anglers that visit the lake do have an excellent opportunity to catch this elusive predator. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>The Walleye gillnet catch rates have shown considerable variation in earlier assessments. Some of this may be due to different sampling dates i.e.... mid June & mid August. The 1991 gillnet catch of 14.3/lift represents nearly a 50% decrease from the previous assessment, however Walleye levels are still considered high for a lake in this classification. Natural reproduction is evident as Age III fish represent 37% of the aged sample and correspond with an unstocked year. Fry stocking may be necessary however to mainitain present levels. The Muskellunge gillnet catch in 1991 was equal to 1988 however both of these were nearly 75% lower than the catch in 1985. The difference in the sample date again may be a factor in the difference in the catches. Size of Muskellunge has been consistant over the past 3 assessments averaging 25.5\". This assessment documents natural reproduction of Muskellunge for the first time in Dumbbell Lake. Yellow Perch densities have slowly risen over the past 5 assessments and present levels are high for this class of lake. White Sucker numbers remain low following removal in 1970. Utilization by Muskellunge may be a major factor in the inability of White Sucker to attain their former levels.</p>",

The most common year classes represented were Age V with 34%, Age I with 30% and Age II with 20% of the catch. These strong year classes correspond to years of fry stocking. It is suspected that natural reproduction of Walleyes is poor. Yellow Perch numbers are about 1/2 the local median and the White Sucker catch remains low as it has since the sucker removal in 1970. Muskies are represented by most age groups and scale reading indicates there may be natural reproduction occuring.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>The fish population in Dumbbell Lake is comprised of walleye, muskellunge, smallmouth bass, yellow perch, rock bass and white sucker.     Over much of the last 15 years Dumbbell Lake supported a walleye population that was very high compared to similar type lakes. Test nets in 1996 indicate walleye abundance has declined from those high numbers however abundance is still above average.     Walleye in the 1996 survey ranged in size from 6.9 inches to 26.5 inches (6.8 pounds) with over 38% over 14.0 inches. The survey indicated there appears to be a scarcity of \"eater\" size walleye in the 0.75 pound to 1.25 pound range.     Next to walleye, muskellunge are the most sought after species in the lake. Although muskellunge over 40 inches and individuals up to 47.0 inches have been taken by anglers Dumbbell Lake is best known for fast action for muskellunge in the 25.0 to 30.0 inch range. Test nets in 1996 captured muskellunge from 24.4 - 33.2 inches with the average size about 5.1 pounds.     Smallmouth bass abundance is about average compared to similar lakes in this Lake Class (5), but the average size is below average. Smallmouth bass taken in test nets in 1996 ranged in size from 5.1 inches to 14.7 inches however less than 5% were over 12.0 inches.     Yellow perch are present in average numbers however because of their small size (average 6.5 inches) they are not sought after by anglers in this lake. There were no yellow perch over 8.0 inches taken in the survey.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Walleye catch numbers were above average compared to other lakes in this lake class.  Average size of the fish was below normal at 12.1 inches (0.72 pound).  The small size was due in part to the high number of juvenile fish in the catch, which is a good sign for the walleye fishery in the next few years.  Walleye ranged from 7.2 inches to 26.1 inches (5.8 pounds).  Approximately 28% of the walleye sampled were larger than 14 inches, with 18% between 14.0 inches and 16.9 inches.  Dumbbell Lake is stocked with 250,000 walleye fry on a two-of-four year rotation, but fish from unstocked years accounted for at least 52% of the 2003 catch.Muskellunge were sampled in average numbers, as they have been in most of the other assessments conducted on the lake.  The average size in the 2003 assessment was 4.7 pounds; the largest muskellunge sampled was 35.4 inches (8.5 pounds).  Muskellunge up to 40 inches have been sampled in other DNR assessments on Dumbbell Lake, and reports of 47 inch fish have come in from anglers who have fished Dumbbell Lake.  Leech Lake and Shoepack strain muskellunge are both in the lake.  The Leech Lake strain is more likely to produce the 40 inch-plus muskellunge.Dumbbell Lake is on the \"designated muskellunge lake\" list, which bans spearing of all species in the lake.  In March 2004 the lake will be removed from the \"designated muskellunge lake\" list, removing the ban on spearing.  What this means is that spearing for northern pike, rough fish, catfish and whitefish will be allowed during the dark house spearing season.  Since there are no northern pike, catfish or whitefish in Dumbbell Lake, winter spear fishing would be limited to a small white sucker population.  Spear fishing for muskellunge will still be illegal.Smallmouth bass were sampled in slightly above-average numbers; however, the size of smallmouth bass was small, averaging 7.5 inches (0.25 pound).  The largest collected in the 2003 assessment was 14.7 inches (1.5 pounds).  Only two of the smallmouth bass sampled were larger than 12 inches.  The size of smallmouth bass sampled in the 2003 assessment is typical of sizes seen in nearly all the previous assessments.Yellow perch were sampled in average numbers; however, they were too small to interest most anglers.  The average size was 6.4 inches, with the largest measuring 8.8 inches.</p>",

This invasive species were first found in Lake Superior in 1988, thought to be introduced through ballast waters.  Spiny water flea has since spread to the inland lakes and rivers including those in the Duluth (1997), Tower (2007), and Grand Marias (2007) Fisheries Management Areas.  In the Finland Area, Dumbbell Lake was selected as a sample site since it is used as an airplane loading site for trout stocking in other inland lakes.  Should spiny water flea be present in Dumbbell Lake, aerial stocking could be a vector, exposing these waters to possible infection. <br> \n <br> \nDuring mid August three vertical plankton tows were made with a 51 cm net at a depth of 32 feet.  These hauls were preserved and then sent to the St. Paul Lab for quantitative analysis. The samples taken during August of 2010 at Dumbbell Lake did not contain spiny water flea. <br> \n <br> \nTotal density of organisms sampled in 2010 was similar to the 2008 sample, but 34% less than the 2009 sample. Copepods have become increasingly more dominant the samples. Sixty-eight percent of the 2010 sample was copepods compared to 54% in 2009 and 46% in 2008.  Cyclopoids continue to be the most dominate copepods in all sample years.  Fewer nauplii were found in 2010 than in previous years. <br> \n   <br> \nCladocerans only made up 31% of the 2010 sample; while in 2009, Cladocerans comprised 46% of the sample and 54% of the sample in 2008.  Eight species of Cladocerans were sampled in 2010 with only five species found in 2009, and seven species found in 2008. Daphnia retrocurva were found in the 2010 Dumbbell Lake sample; although new to the DNR sampling in Dumbbell Lake this species is common in the Great Lakes Region.  Bosmina longirostris was the most dominate species in 2010 and 2009. Daphnia galeata mendoate and Daphnia pulex dominated the Cladoceran sample in 2008; these species were not sampled in 2009, but sampled in low numbers in 2010. The lack of Daphnia in the 2009 sample was influenced by the large 2009 year class of walleye documented during the annual fall electrofishing. <br> \n <br> \nThe fish community of Dumbbell Lake includes walleye, muskellunge, smallmouth bass, yellow perch, white sucker, and rock bass. An established population of spiny water flea could potentially be detrimental to the walleye population as well as the other fish species as spiny water flea are thought to out compete Daphina species , which are a preferred food  of age-0 walleye. <br> \n</p>",

The public access includes a concrete boat ramp and dock with parking available for about a half dozen rigs.  A targeted survey of summer gill nets was completed in 2021 to help evaluate the effectiveness of Walleye stocking.  Currently, the lake is stocked with 500,000 fry in two consecutive years followed by two non-stocked years. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye catch was above the normal range for similar lakes for the third consecutive survey and met the goal in the current management plan.  The average size was 13.8\" and just over a pound which indicates good opportunities for anglers.  Age analysis determined that 63% of the catch came from non-stocked years.  Results from the past several surveys indicate naturally reproduced year classes have been responsible for a majority of the Walleye caught.  The management plan calls for the current stocking strategy to be thoroughly evaluated after surveys in 2023 and 2028.   <br> \n <br> \nSmallmouth Bass are present but the majority of fish are small with only 9% of the catch greater than 10\" long.  The largest fish taken was 14.4 inches. <br> \n <br> \nThe lake is also popular with Musky anglers because of the abundant population of moderate sized fish.  While the Shoepack strain of muskellunge in the lake rarely exceeds 40\", anglers have an excellent chance to catch 30\" fish with some regularity.     <br> \n</p>",
