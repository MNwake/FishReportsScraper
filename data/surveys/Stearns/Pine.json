                "narrative": "<p>Pine Lake is a 107-acre lake in the Avon Hills area near the town of Albany, Stearns County. Maximum depth was 84 feet and approximately one-third of the lake was less than 15 feet deep. Dissolved oxygen was sufficient to a depth of 18 feet. Water clarity is good to 8.5 feet. Cattails grow around most of the shoreline. The majority of the surrounding watershed is pasture and row crop agriculture. Cattle grazing on the south and east shores causes erosion that contributes to nutrient-enriched conditions. The lake was moderately developed with 18 homes or cabins. Pine Lake was last surveyed in 2000. <br> \n <br> \nDay-time electrofishing for largemouth bass was conducted on 12 May, and repeated on 4 June in order to improve the sample. Catches for both days were lower than the average daytime catches for Montrose Area lakes and considerably lower than the night-time electrofishing in 2000. The largemouth bass collected in 2010 ranged in length from 9 to19 inches with an average length of 15 inches.  Electrofished bass were not sacrificed for aging, but two bass caught in the gill nets were estimated to be four years old. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie were caught in high numbers in 2010. Trap net catches have consistently been good.  Black crappie from the 2010 trap nets ranged from six to 11 inches in length (average of 8.5 inches) and were determined to be 4 to 9 years in age. Black crappie grew to a length of eight inches in five years.   <br> \n <br> \nIn 2010, bluegill catches were lower than catches on similar lakes. Bluegill ranged between 3 and 8 inches and reached six inches in three years.  <br> \n <br> \nFifteen northern pike between 15 and 36 inches were collected in 2010. This was low compared to similar lakes, but northern pike averaged 3.4 pounds each. Only three yellow perch, the main food of northern pike, were collected in this survey.   <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A population assessment was conducted during the third week of August in 1993 to assess the fish population in the lake.  The nettings revealed the following information.        The northern pike catch in gill nets (3.8/gill net) declined from the 1986 survey (8.5/gill net), however, it remained above the state average for lakes similar to Pine.  While the catch rate did decrease the average size of northern pike caught appeared to have increased slightly from 2.6 to 3.1 lbs.  Northern pike caught ranged in length from 10.0-30.4 inches and averaged 23.1 inches in length.  No dominant year class appeared in the sampling.  Growth was fast for 1 and 2 year old pike while it was average for 3 to 6 year olds.        The catch rate of walleye in gill nets declined from 1986 levels (3.3/gill net) to 0.3/gill net in 1993.  The lake was stocked in 1987, 1989, and 1991 with fingerlings, however the success of these stockings appeared to have been low.        The black crappie catch in gill nets (4.0/gill net) appeared to have declined from 1986 (13.3/gill net) but still remained within expected levels for this lake class.  Black crappies caught ranged in size from 5.2-7.0 inches and averaged 5.8 inches in length.  The white crappie catch in 1993 (0.5/gill net), appeared to have dropped off more dramatically from the 1986 survey (72.3/gill net).  The majority of white crappie caught in 1986 were from the 1984 year class and it appears that no other strong year class has appeared since.        The bluegill catch rate in trap nets (11.7/trapnet) appeared to increase slightly from 1986 (3.3/trap net) but they remained within expected levels for lakes similar to Pine.  Bluegills caught averaged 6.6 inches in length and 0.2 lbs in weight.         Both black and yellow bullheads were caught in trap nets during the survey.  Catch rates remained similar to previous surveys and also remained within expected values for this lake type.        Largemouth bass were sampled by spring electrofishing and were captured at a rate of 17.1/hour of shocking.  Fish caught ranged in size from 6.4-20.1 inches and averaged 13.0 inches.  The majority of fish caught (81%) were 3-5 year olds, however fish as old as 9 years were sampled.  Fish grew fast for the first five years and average for years 6-9.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Pine Lake is located in Stearns County, near the town of Albany.  It is a relatively small lake of 107 acres, but has a maximum depth of 79 feet.  Pine Lake is eutrophic (nutrient-enriched), with low water clarity.  The lake is moderately developed with homes and cabins.  It is managed primarily for northern pike and largemouth bass.  A fisheries survey was conducted on Pine Lake in 2000 to assess populations of game fish.Northern pike numbers were low for a lake like Pine, and lower than in the previous survey (1993).  Pike were also relatively slow-growing and small, averaging 1.4 pounds.  The largest fish caught in the survey was 23 inches.  Yellow perch numbers were also low, which may account for the reduced numbers and size of pike.  Walleye are no longer stocked in Pine Lake, due to lack of success in the past.  The few walleye caught during the survey may have been the result of limited natural reproduction, or more likely may have entered the lake through South Two River.High numbers of largemouth bass were caught during spring electrofishing.  Most were between 10 and 13 inches, but a few were larger than 19 inches.  Bass were concentrated along the cattail fringes of the lake, showing the value of emergent vegetation as bass habitat.  Bass have been growing quickly, and there should be good bass angling in coming years.  Bluegill abundance was average for this type of lake, but fish sampled in 2000 were mostly small by angler standards.  Black crappie numbers were also average, but of better size.  Numerous 8-inch fish were sampled, with some larger than 9 inches.Other species sampled included yellow bullhead, black bullhead, white sucker, common carp, and bowfin (dogfish).  All were collected in numbers typical for lakes similar to Pine.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Pine Lake is a 107 acre lake with a maximum depth of 79 feet located near the town of Albany in Stearns County. A state owned access is located on the west central side of the lake. The watershed is small and the primary land use is agriculture. Cattail spp. cover the majority of the shoreline. Pine Lake has showed a trend of increasing water clarity and in late August of 2018 the Secchi reading was seven feet. Pine Lake was first surveyed in 1960 and resurveyed in 1986, 2000, 2010 and 2018.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye exist in low numbers due to private stocking that took place in 2018. Walleye stocking was discontinued by DNR in 1984 due to low return in test sampling. The five Walleye sampled in 2018 ranged in length from 12 to 15 inches. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass were sampled during daytime electrofishing on May 15, 2018. The catch rate was higher than previous surveys and was above average for Sauk Rapids area lakes. Largemouth Bass ranged in length from 6 to 21 inches and averaged 14 inches. <br> \n <br> \nIn 2018, Northern Pike abundance was higher than the two previous surveys, but still within the expected range of values for lakes similar to Pine. Northern Pike ranged in length from 16 to 27 inches and averaged 21 inches and two pounds. Eighteen percent of the Northern Pike sampled were over 24 inches. <br> \n <br> \nThe declining trend in Yellow Perch abundance continued in 2018 where no Yellow Perch were sampled in gill nets. <br> \n <br> \nThe trap net catch of Black Crappie in 2018 was lower than observed in 2010, but still above the expected range of values for similar lakes. Trap net catches have consistently been good, typically above the expected range. Black Crappie from the 2018 trap nets ranged in length from five to nine inches and averaged seven inches. The Bluegill trap net catch in 2018 was the highest on record and above the expected range. Bluegill ranged in length from three to nine inches and averaged five inches. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled included Common Carp, Black, Brown and Yellow Bullhead, Bowfin, Hybrid and Pumpkinseed Sunfish and White Sucker. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Northern Pike abundance was similar to 1980 and near the upper range of expected values. Ages from young of the year and 2-5 were sampled with the 1982 & 83 year classes each contributing 35% of the catch. Composite growth was good. Median length has increased by 4 inches since 1980, to 21 inches. Average weight was now 2.6 pounds compared to 1.3 pounds in 1980. Bluegill abundance remained well below the expected range for similar lakes. Ages 3-6 were sampled, with 50% being age 5 fish. Composite growth borders on slow at each annulus. Shoreline seining produced no young of the year fish. The Largemouth Bass catch was near the local median. Shoreline seining showed fair numbers of young of the year bass. The White Crappie and Black Crappie catch was above their respective range of expected values. Age 2 dominated both populations. White Crappie abundance was similar to 1980, while Black Crappie numbers appeared to be higher. Growth of White Crappie was slow and that of Black Crappie bordered on slow. Black Crappies seemed to have more consistent reproductive success bases on the 1986 sample. Green Sunfish, Pumpkinseed and hybrid sunfish were sampled in 1980 but not in 1986. The Walleye catch was 3.3/gill net, near the state median. All but one fish aged from a 1984 fingerling stocking. Growth was below average. Fish from a 1979 fingerling stocking were absent from this sample. A similar abundance was seen in 1960 when fish from a 1957 fingerling stocking were sampled. Yellow Perch were about one-half as abundant as in 1980 but remained above their local median. Perch, including young of the year fish, were the most abundant forage species in shoreline seining. Small numbers of Brook Silverside and Johnny Darters were also caught. The Bowfin (dogfish) catch was near its local median. Common Carp were caught in numbers below their expected range, similar to 1980. Local reports suggest abundance may be higher than shown by trap netting. White Sucker abundance was the lower end of the expected range for gill nets but the trap net catch was near the upper range of expected. Black Bullhead abundance was above the expected range in 1980 at 58/ trap net. The catch was down to 12.5/trap net in 1986. Median length increased slightly to the 8.0-8.4 inch interval. The Yellow Bullhead catch was near the local median and similar to 1980.</p>",
