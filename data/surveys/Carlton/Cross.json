The fish community is diverse with panfish a major component with lesser numbers of northern pike and walleye.     Results of the 1996 survey indicated low numbers of walleye and northern pike, however average sample length for walleye was 16.8 inches and for northern pike was 26.7 inches.  Black crappie and bluegill numbers were average although they tended to be small.  Most of the sampled fish were under 9 inches for crappie and under 7 inches for bluegill.     Anglers might also encounter brown bullhead, dogfish, pumpkinseed and yellow perch in average to low numbers.</p>",

Bluegill went from 1.3 to 36.0, and black crappie from 1.0 to 9.5 during the same period. Strong year classes were produced in 1987 for all three species. The 1985 and 1988 were also good year classes for bluegill and black crappie. The strong 1985 year classes of bluegill and crappie are reflected in a nice size distribution of fish over 7 inches.Northern pike have shown a slight increasing trend from 1957 to 1989, but no individuals over 30 inches were taken. The 1989 catch rate was 1.2 per gill net lift.Yellow perch increased through 1976 when 11.5 per gill net lift were taken, however, they dropped to 2.7 per lift in 1989. Walleye abundance was 1.3 per gill net lift in 1989, above the local median for similar lakes.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Cross Lake is a 101 acre lake with 100 (99%) acres of littoral area and a maximum depth of 23 feet.  The lake is located 5 miles north of Cromwell, MN off State Highway #73 and has a gravel, back-in access.  Walleye fingerlings have been stocked in 1993, 1996, 1999 and 2001.  Walleye fry were stocked in 1991 and 1994.  Adult walleye were stocked in 1999.  The primary management species is walleye, with secondary management for bluegill and black crappie.     Walleye abundance of 0.8 per gillnet lift was below average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Of the 12 walleye aged from the 2002 investigation, six were born in years that walleye were stocked.  However, the adult walleye stocked in 1999 may have caused this estimate to be low.  Mean length of 15.5 inches was large.  Growth was fast with length at age four of 17.2 inches.     Black crappie abundance of 2.2 per trapnet lift was average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Mean length of 7.8 inches was also average.  Growth was slow with length at age four of 6.3 inches.  Age analysis revealed steady recruitment from 1994 through 1999 and a strong 1998 year-class.       Bluegill abundance of 11.0 per trapnet lift was average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Mean length of 5.2 inches was small.  Growth was average with length at age four of 4.3 inches.  Age analysis revealed steady recruitment from 1994 through 2000 with strong 1997 and 1999 year-classes.     Northern pike abundance of 2.7 per gillnet lift was below average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Mean length of 23.8 inches was large.  Growth was fast with length at age four of 27.1 inches.  Age analysis revealed a strong 1999 year-class and no fish older than five years.     Yellow perch abundance of 0.2 per gillnet lift was below average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Mean length of 6.6 inches was small.     Other fish species sampled in Cross Lake include bowfin, brown bullhead, pumpkinseed sunfish, rock bass and white sucker.  Bowfin are native to only a small number of lakes within the Duluth fisheries management area.     A young-of-the-year (YOY) walleye electrofishing assessment was conducted during the night of 10/01/2002.  No YOY walleye were sampled.  Six juvenile walleye were sampled.      Management for walleye on Cross Lake has varied between stocking of fry, fingerlings, yearlings and adults from 1989 through 2001.  Gillnet catch rates have not increased during the same time period.  Future fisheries management of Cross Lake will be determined by the management plan completed in 2003-2004.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Cross is a 101-acre lake with 100 acres (99%) of littoral area and a maximum depth of 23 feet.  Cross Lake is located 2.5 miles north of Cromwell, Minnesota off Highway #73.  Cross Lake has a gravel, back-in access off the Highway #73 right-of-way on the east end of the lake.  Cross Lake was survey during the summer of 2009 as part of an effort to evaluate the impacts of the aquatic macrophyte wateshield on local lakes and to update information on fish populations. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance of 0.5 per gillnet lift had decreased since 2002 (0.8) and was still considered below average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Average size of 19.8 inches was large and growth was fast.  Age analysis revealed five year-classes represented from 2000 through 2005. <br> \n   <br> \nNorthern pike abundance of 1.5 per gillnet lift had decreased since 2002 (2.7) and was still considered below average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Average size of 24.0 inches was considered large and growth was typical.  Age analysis revealed all year-classes from 2003 through 2007 were represented.   <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch, which had been sampled by gillnet from all previous investigations, were not sampled during the 2009 lake survey. Young-of-the-year and older yellow perch were sampled from seining conducted in 2009. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie abundance of 1.1 per trapnet lift had decreased since 2002 (2.2) and had fallen to below average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Average size of 7.3 inches was considered average and growth was slow.  Age analysis revealed all year-classes from 2001 through 2007 were represented with a relatively strong 2005 year-class.   <br> \nBluegill abundance of 19.0 per trapnet lift was greater than 2002 (11.0) but still considered typical compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Average size of 4.4 inches was small and growth was slow.  Age analysis revealed consistent recruitment with all year-classes represented from 1999 through 2007 and a very strong 2007 year-class.    <br> \nOther fish species sampled include bowfin, Johnny darter, golden shiner, pumpkinseed sunfish, white sucker and yellow bullhead.  <br> \n <br> \nInformation was collected on aquatic vegetation, substrate and water quality.  Diversity of aquatic plants was typical with 30 species or species groups identified along 10 transects.  Watershield, which was identified at 100% of the transects, was the most frequently identified plant.  Arrowhead group, sedge group, spikerush group and yellow waterlily group were also identified at greater than 60% of the transects.  Lakeshore residents around Cross Lake have reported a dramatic increase in the distribution and density of watershield in recent years.  In response, a special assessment of watershield was completed in conjunction with the 2009 survey.  An aerial photography analysis revealed that in 2003, 13.2 acres of Cross Lake was covered with watershield.  In 2009, 24.1 acres were covered with watershield, a 45% increase from 2003.  It is suspected that low alkalinity as well as longer, warmer growing seasons are contributing factors to the increase in watershield abundance.  Other lakes in the Duluth Area (Sand in Carlton County and Cooks in St. Louis County) with similar water chemistry are experiencing increases in the abundance of watershield.  The most common substrate type was sand, which was identified at 90% of the transects.  All other substrate types identified had frequencies of occurrence less than 50%. Results of laboratory water analysis indicate Cross is a slightly acidic (pH 6.4), soft water lake (alkalinity 5 ppm) with good fertility (total phosphorus 0.032). <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n</p>",
