                "narrative": "<p>Deer Yard Lake has long been known for supporting very high numbers of small Walleye, with no panfish and no other gamefish species present.  The current (2012) lake management plan set goals for Walleye of maintaining a high gill net catch (20 fish/set), with a mean weight for fish taken in gill nets of at least 0.7 lb/fish.  This was the second of two surveys scheduled in that plan to determine whether a low Walleye catch observed in 2007 had been indicative of a real decline in Walleye abundance.  Both have now been completed, and the information they've provided will be used in a revision of the current plan over the winter of 2020. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye remained abundant in Deer Yard lake in 2018, and their average size remained small.  The 2018 Walleye gill net catch was well above the normal range for a lake of this type, but still failed to meet the long range goal set in the 2012 plan.  The mean weight for Walleye taken in gill nets was below-normal for a lake of this type, and also failed to meet the goal from the current plan.  The Walleye trap net catch was also high for a lake of this class, but fish taken in trap nets were also small.    Twelve year classes, all naturally produced, and including fish as old as 23 years, were included in the 2018 catch.  Relatively strong year classes appeared to have been produced in 2016 and 2015, and the abundance of those small, young fish, resulted in the low mean weight seen for Walleye in 2018.  Also contributing to the low mean weight was the slow growth exhibited by Walleye taken in 2018.  Fish reached a mean length of just 10.7 inches at the end of their fourth year, compared to an area average of 12.7 inches.  Slow Walleye growth has been typical in this lake, and growth rates seen in 2018 were not unusual. <br> \n <br> \nSlow Walleye growth in this lake is due to a combination of high Walleye numbers (high competition for forage), a lack of forage species, and competition for invertebrate forage from a relatively dense White Sucker population.  The White Sucker gill net catch in 2018 was one of the highest ever seen in this lake.  Most of the fish taken appeared to have been adult fish, and most were too large to have been taken by any but the largest Walleye present.  Sampling using 0.25-in-mesh trap nets found no other fish species present; only a few minnows have been seen in this lake in the past.  No Yellow Perch have ever been found.  One past attempt at White Sucker removal in this lake (13,478 lb removed in 2000-2001) succeeded in reducing their abundance, with what appeared to have been some improvement in Walleye growth; however, both effects were very short-lived. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Deeryard Lake supports a dense, slow-growing walleye population, dominated by small fish.  The walleye catch in gill nets in this assessment was very high, but was similar to past catches in this lake.  The mean weight was low for a lake of this class, and was lower than what has usually been seen in this lake.  The population was entirely natural, with several strong year classes.  Growth rates for walleye were fairly slow but faster than before sucker removal; fish averaged 14.6 inches at five years of age.White sucker were removed from Deeryard Lake by shoreline trap netting in the springs of 2000 and 2001.  A total of 13,478 lb were removed (38.3 lb/acre).  This resulted in a significant reduction in white sucker abundance for the 2001 assessment, but white sucker abundance is apparently already nearing that of historical (before sucker removal) levels.  The gill net catch for white sucker in 2001 was 5.00 fish/net, after ranging from 16.50 to 36.00 fish/net in past assessments.  The gill net catch for white sucker in 2004 was 13.5/net.  White sucker often rebound quickly after removal efforts.  White sucker removal appears to have resulted in slightly increased growth rate of walleye.  However, the average weight of walleye caught in 2004 was one of the lowest, historically.  Walleye forage is probably provided primarily by invertebrates, although the lake does support a few minnows.</p>",

The walleye catch in gill nets in this assessment was very high, but was similar to past catches in this lake.  The mean weight was low for a lake of this class, but was higher than usually seen in this lake.  The population was entirely natural, with several strong year classes produced recently.  Growth rates for walleye were slow; fish averaged 13.5 inches at five years of age.During the course of white sucker removal operations in the spring of 2001, 1,331 walleye were marked and released.  Walleye collected in gill nets and trap nets were examined for marks (anal or pelvic fin clips), and mark and recapture population estimates were made.  An estimated 12,034 walleye 10-in or larger were present in spring 2001.White sucker were removed from Deeryard Lake by shoreline trap netting in the springs of 2000 and 2001.  A total of 13,478 lb were removed (38.3 lb/acre).  This may have resulted in a significant reduction in white sucker abundance.  The gill net catch for white sucker in 2001 was 5.00 fish/net, after ranging from 16.50 to 36.00 fish/net in past assessments.  White sucker often rebound quickly after removal efforts.  Effects of the white sucker removal on the walleye population cannot yet be determined.No other fish species were collected in the 2001 assessment, as has generally been the case in this lake.  Walleye forage is probably provided primarily by invertebrates, although the lake does support a few minnows.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Deer Yard Lake is managed for Walleye, and has historically supported high numbers of small, slow-growing Walleye.  Walleye were still abundant in 2013.  Although the 2013 gill net catch was the lowest ever observed for Deer Yard Lake it still exceeded the normal range for similar lakes in the state.  The mean weight of Walleye sampled in 2013 was low for the this lake type, but was about average for the lake historically. Walleye growth had been slow; fish attained a length of just 8.7 in at the end of their third year compared to a mean of 10.3 in for similar lakes in the Grand Marais area.  The slow growth of Walleye in Deer Yard Lake can be attributed to the lack of high-quality forage within the system, and competition for macroinvertebrates from a dense White Sucker population.  However, Deer Yard Lake may have the potential to produce an occassional trophy Walleye as was seen in the 2013 assessment. <br> \n <br> \nWhite Sucker also remained abundant in Deer Yard Lake in 2013.  Most of the White Sucker collected in 2013 were too large to serve as forage for any but the largest Walleye in the lake. A few Golden Shiners were sampled in 2013, in small-mesh trap nets.  Deer Yard Lake is also known to support small numbers of Creek Chub and Brook Stickleback. <br> \n</p>",

The 2007 assessment yielded the lowest walleye gill net catch ever recorded in Deer Yard Lake; however, even that catch exceeded the normal range for a lake of this class.  Mean weight for walleye collected in 2007, although low for a lake of this class, was the second highest ever observed in this lake.  Walleye growth rates remained slow; fish attained a length of just 10.9 inches by the end of their fourth year.  Slow walleye growth was due to a lack of high-quality forage; walleye in this lake subsist primarily on invertebrates, and compete for that forage with a dense white sucker population. <br> \n <br> \nWhite sucker abundance has apparently rebounded completely from lows observed following a removal effort in 2000-2001.  Most of the white sucker collected were too large to have provided forage for any but the largest walleye in the lake.   <br> \n <br> \nAs has usually been the case in Deer Yard Lake, no other fish species were collected in 2007.  The lake is known to support small numbers of golden shiner, creek chub, and brook stickleback, but they would not have been taken in the sampling gear used in this assessment. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

Slow walleye growth is due to a complete lack of yellow perch forage, the high density of the walleye population, and possible competition for invertebrate forage from a dense white sucker population.  The walleye population was supported entirely through natural reproduction, with strong year classes produced in 1994 and 1995, and what appeared to have been very weak year class in 1996 and 1997.</p>",
