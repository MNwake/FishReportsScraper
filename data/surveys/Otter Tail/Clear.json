                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of nearshore fish species in Clear Lake was conducted on June 20, 2019 by Fergus Falls Area Fisheries staff.  Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible.  Backpack electrofishing was completed at 10 sampling stations.  Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample three stations, a 15-foot seine was used at four stations, and site conditions prevented the use of seines at three stations.  Nearshore sampling captured 15 species of fish including three species that are intolerant of disturbance (Banded Killifish, Blacknose Shiner, and Iowa Darter) and two that are tolerant of disturbance (Black Bullhead and Fathead Minnow). <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore data were combined with trap net and gill net data from an August 14, 2017 survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based IBI (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment.  In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g., Banded Killifish, Blacknose Shiner, and Iowa Darter), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g., Black Bullhead and Fathead Minnow).  The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake.  For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.   <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Pomme de Terre Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Clear Lake is a 352-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located in southwest Otter Tail County.  The maximum depth is 29 feet and 43% of the lake is 15 feet or less in depth.  The shoreline length is 6.3 miles.  The immediate watershed consists primarily of agricultural land.  The secchi disk reading in the 2001 lake survey was 8.1 feet.  Secchi disk readings, a measurement of water clarity, have ranged from 3.1 to 8.1 feet in previous surveys. A DNR owned public water access is located on the west shoreline.     There is low to moderate development on Clear Lake.  Development consists of year-round homes, cabins, and one resort.  Lakeshore development has been shown to negatively impact water quality by increasing nutrient levels and shoreline erosion.  This can result in increased plankton/algae blooms, aquatic plant growth and suspended sediments, all of which can lead to a decrease in water clarity.  By using best management practices (BMP's) and \"lakescaping concepts\", impacts of shoreline development and erosion can be minimized.  Contact any county extension office for information on BMP's and you local DNR-Fisheries office for information on lakescaping techniques.     The shoreline substrates are primarily composed of sand, gravel, and rubble.  The dominate submerged aquatic plant is chara, a plant that can grow up to one foot or more off the bottom.  The dominate emergent plant is hardstem bulrush.  This plant is located along shoreline areas and on a sunken island.  Emergent plants (bulrush and cattail) provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat in Clear Lake and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms from erosion and can actually absorb and breakdown polluting chemicals.  Emergent plants provide spawning habitat for fish species like northern pike, largemouth bass and panfish.  They also serve as important nursery areas for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological importance, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit.     Clear Lake contains good populations of walleye, northern pike and bluegill.  Mean length and weight of walleye was 16.3 inches and 1.6 pounds.  Mean length and weight of northern pike was 20.5 inches and 1.9 pounds.  Fifteen percent of the bluegills were at least 7.0 inches in length.     Black crappie and largemouth bass are present; however, their abundance appears to be low.       Walleye fingerlings are stocked on a biennial basis to supplement natural reproduction that is occurring. Suitable spawning habitat for northern pike, bluegill, black crappie, and largemouth bass is available throughout the lake.     Anglers can maintain and improve the quality of fishing for all species in Clear Lake by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large-size fish while allowing the harvest of the more abundant smaller fish for eating.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish for future years and will provide anglers with the opportunity to catch more large fish.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>     Clear Lake is a 352-acre eutrophic (fertile) lake located in southwest Otter Tail County approximately two miles south of Dalton, MN.  The immediate watershed consists primarily of agricultural land interspersed with hardwood woodlots.  The maximum depth is 29 feet; however, 43% of the lake is 15 feet or less in depth.  The secchi disk reading during the 2006 lake survey was 5.8 feet.  Previous secchi disk readings have ranged from 3.1 to 8.1 feet.  Periodic plankton/algae blooms during the summer months can decrease water clarity in this lake.  The MN DNR has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different lake classes based on physical and chemical characteristics.  Clear Lake is included in lake class 32; other area lakes in this same classification include Anna, Fiske, Norway, East Lost, and South Turtle. \n    \n    The majority of the shoreline is undeveloped.  A DNR owned public access is located along the west shoreline.  Shoreline substrates consist primarily of sand, gravel, and rubble.  Hardstem bulrush is prevalent along shoreline areas and on a sunken island.  Emergent aquatic macrophytes such as bulrush provide important fish and wildlife habitat and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms from erosion and can actually absorb and breakdown polluting chemicals.  Emergent plants provide spawning habitat for fish species like northern pike, largemouth bass, and panfish.  They also serve as important nursery areas for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological importance, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit.\n\n     Walleye is a primary management species in Clear Lake.  The test-net catch rate exceeded the upper limit of the expected range for similar lakes.  Walleye ranged in length from 8.0 to 25.8 inches with an average length of 14.5 inches and 1.4 pounds.  Catch data indicate that walleye abundance can be maintained at or above management goals by stocking walleye fingerlings on a biennial basis.      \n\n        Anglers can maintain the quality of fishing in Clear Lake by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large size fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with an opporrtunity to catch more large fish in the futrure.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>     Clear Lake is a 352-acre eutrophic (fertile) lake located in southwest Otter Tail County approximately two miles south of Dalton, MN.  The immediate watershed consists primarily of agricultural land interspersed with hardwood woodlots.  Clear Lake is part of the Pomme de Terre watershed.  The maximum depth is 29 feet; however, 43% of the lake is 15 feet or less in depth.  The secchi disk reading during the 2023 survey was 7.1 feet.  Previous secchi disk readings have ranged from 3.1 to 11.2 feet.       <br> \n     The majority of the shoreline of Clear Lake is undeveloped.  Several cabins and a resort are located along the west shoreline of the lake.  A DNR owned public access is also located along the west shoreline.  Shoal water substrates consist primarily of sand, gravel, and rubble.  Hardstem bulrush is prevalent along shoreline areas and on a mid-lake hump.  Emergent aquatic macrophytes such as bulrush provide important fish and wildlife habitat and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms from erosion and can actually absorb and breakdown polluting chemicals.  Emergent plants provide spawning habitat for fish species like Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, and panfish.  They also serve as important nursery areas for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological importance, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit. <br> \n     A special gillnetting survey was conducted to analyze the Walleye and Northern Pike populations. <br> \n     The Walleye population is abundant.  Walleyes ranged in length from 8.3 to 27.3 inches with an average length and weight of 15.3 inches and 1.5 pounds.  Age data indicate that the 2021 and 2022 year classes are strong and should provide consistently good Walleye angling for several years.  Walleyes attain an average length of 13.5 inches at three years of age. <br> \n     Northern Pike abundance and size structure have historically fluctuated.  Northern Pike ranged in length from 15.2 to 29.6 inches with an average length and weight of 22.5 inches and 2.4 pounds.  Pike attain an average length of 25.3 inches at four years of age. <br> \n    Smallmouth Bass abundance continues to expand with an increasing number of year classes present.  Smallmouth Bass ranged in length from 11.8 to 19.8 inches with an average length and weight of 14.7 inches and 2.0 pounds.  Smallmouth Bass attain an average length of 13.4 inches at three years of age.        <br> \n     Anglers can maintain the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large size fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with an opportunity to catch more large fish in the future. <br> \n     Clear Lake is not listed as an infested water.  Aquatic invasive species are threatening Minnesota waters.  The non-native species can potentially harm water quality, water recreation, aquatic habitat, native species, and fish populations.  Anglers can help prevent the introduction and spread of invasive species by following watercraft transportation laws. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>     Clear Lake is a 352-acre eutrophic (fertile) lake located in southwest Otter Tail County approximately two miles south of Dalton, MN.  The immediate watershed consists primarily of agricultural land interspersed with hardwood woodlots.  The maximum depth is 29 feet; however, 43% of the lake is 15 feet or less in depth.  The secchi disk reading was 4.8 feet.  Previous secchi disk readings ranged from 3.1 to 11.2 feet.       <br> \n     The majority of the shoreline of Clear Lake is undeveloped.  Several cabins and a resort are located along the west shoreline of the lake.  A DNR owned public access is also located along the west shoreline.  Shoal water substrates consist primarily of sand, gravel, and rubble.  Hardstem bulrush is prevalent along shoreline areas and on a mid-lake hump.  Emergent aquatic macrophytes such as bulrush provide important fish and wildlife habitat and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms from erosion and can actually absorb and breakdown polluting chemicals.  Emergent plants provide spawning habitat for fish species like Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, and panfish.  They also serve as important nursery areas for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological importance, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit. <br> \n     Walleye is a primary management species for this lake.  Walleyes ranged in length from 6.8 to 29.4 inches with an average length and weight of 20.3 inches and 2.7 pounds.  Age data indicate that the 2014 year class is strong and should provide consistently good Walleye angling for several years.  Walleyes attain an average length of 15.4 inches at four years of age. <br> \n     Northern Pike abundance and size structure have historically fluctuated.  Pike ranged in length from 20.2 to 27.4 inches with an average length and weight of 23.0 inches and 2.7 pounds.  Pike attain an average length of 24.7 inches at four years of age. <br> \n     Bluegill abundance and size structure has also fluctuated.  Only five percent of the Bluegill sample measured 7.0 inches or greater in length.  Bluegills attain an average length of 5.7 inches at three years of age. <br> \n     Anglers can maintain the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large size fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with an opportunity to catch more large fish in the future. <br> \n     Clear Lake is not listed as an infested water.  Aquatic invasive species are threatening Minnesota waters.  The non-native species can potentially harm water quality, water recreation, aquatic habitat, native species, and fish populations.  Anglers can help prevent the introduction and spread of invasive species by following watercraft transportation laws.  Anglers are required to remove all visible plants, mud, and other prohibited invasive species and drain all water from their boat prior to leaving the water access.     <br> \n   </p>",

Other area lakes in this class include:  Big McDonald, East Lost, Fiske, and Norway. <br> \n     Northern pike abundance, indexed by gill net catch rates, increased from 2.3 per gill net lift in the 1987 survey to 9.0 per net, exceeding the third quartile of the normal range for this lake class.  Average individual weight of northern pike increased from 2.0 pounds in 1987 to 2.7 pounds.  Northern pike reproduction and recruitment appear to be consistent as six consecutive age-classes were represented in the sample.   <br> \n     Bluegill abundance increased slightly from 61.5 per trap net lift in 1987 to 67.8 per net, exceeding the normal range.  Only two percent of the bluegill measured were greater than 7.0 inches in length. Bluegill recruitment appears to be consistent with a strong 1989 year class (age-II) composing 69% of the sample.  Bluegill growth rates appear to be average compared to statewide means.   <br> \n     Black crappie abundance decreased from 5.5 per trap net lift in 1987 to 0.5 per net, which is well below the normal range.  The low abundance of black crappie and the indication of only one year class (1989) in the sample most likely explains the above average growth rates.   <br> \n     Yellow perch abundance increased from 14.5 per gill net lift in 1987 to 96.3 per net, which is three times greater than the upper limit of the normal range.   <br> \n     Walleye abundance decreased slightly from 14.5 per gill net lift in 1987 to 11.5 per net, but still exceeds the normal range.  A strong 1988 year class (age-III) composed 44% of the sample.  The 1989 year class (age-II) composed 22% of the sample and may be the result of natural reproduction as 1989 was a skip year in the stocking sequence.  Walleye growth rates are above average compared to statewide means. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>    Clear Lake is a 352-acre eutrophic (fertile) lake located in southwest Otter Tail County approximately two miles south of Dalton, MN.  The immediate watershed consists primarily of agricultural land interspersed with hardwood woodlots.  The maximum depth is 29 feet; however, 43% of the lake is 15 feet or less in depth.  The secchi disk reading during the 2012 lake survey was 11.2 feet.  Previous secchi disk readings ranged from 3.1 to 8.1 feet.       <br> \n    The majority of the shoreline is undeveloped.  A DNR owned public access is located along the west shoreline.  Shoal water substrates consist primarily of sand, gravel, and rubble.  Hardstem bulrush is prevalent along shoreline areas and on a mid-lake hump.  Emergent aquatic macrophytes such as bulrush provide important fish and wildlife habitat and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms from erosion and can actually absorb and breakdown polluting chemicals.  Emergent plants provide spawning habitat for fish species like northern pike, largemouth bass, and panfish.  They also serve as important nursery areas for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological importance, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit. <br> \n     Walleye is a primary management specie for this lake.  Walleyes ranged in length from 7.5 to 28.6 inches with an average length and weight of 15.8 inches and 1.9 pounds.  Age data indicate that the 2010 year class is strong and should provide consistently good walleye angling for several years.  Walleyes attain an average length of 16.4 inches at four years of age. <br> \n    Northern pike abundance and size structure has historically fluctuated.  Pike ranged in length from 15.8 to 34.5 inches with an average length and weight of 22.6 inches and 2.5 pounds.  Pike attain an average length of 24.7 inches at four years of age. <br> \n     Bluegill abundance and size structure has also fluctuated.  Only four percent of the bluegill sample was 7.0 inches or greater in length.  Bluegills attain an average length of 6.0 inches at three years of age. <br> \n        Anglers can maintain the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large size fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with an opportunity to catch more large fish in the future. <br> \n</p>",
