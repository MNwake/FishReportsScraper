NO NATURAL REPRODUCTION WAS EVIDENT; HOWEVER, WAE WERE PROBABLY JUST REACHING SEXUAL MATURITY.  NOP ABUNDANCE AND SIZE WERE GOOD; 67% OF THE FISH COLLECTED WERE OVER 25 IN.  SEVERAL YEAR CLASSES WERE PRESENT, WITH 1984 THE STRONG- EST; HOWEVER, THERE WERE ALSO SEVERAL MISSING YEAR CLASSES.  NOP RECRUITMENT OR REPRODUCTION MAY BE SUBJECT TO FREQUENT FAILURES.  GROWTH WAS FAST BY COOK COUNTY STANDARDS.  FORAGE IN NORTH TEMPERANCE LAKE APPEARS TO BE LIMITED.  ONLY ONE YELLOW PERCH WAS COLLECTED.</p>",
