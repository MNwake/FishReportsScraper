                "narrative": "<p>The panfish population is at or above local levels with all species showing stability or increasing trends in number per lift.  Bluegill catch rate is 9.8 per trapnet lift, black crappie is 8.5 per lift.  Bluegill rate is slightly below local median of 12.2, crappie is well above local median of 2.5 per lift.  With increasing catch rate, the average weight has declined.  The module size range for bluegill lie between 5 and 7 inches while crappie is 6.5 to 7 inches with individuals out to 10 inches.  Age structure indicates strong bluegill years classes in 1984-85 and 1986-87.  Black crappie had strong year classes in the same years.     Yellow perch were in high abundance in 1955, declined severely by 1973, and have declined since with a catch rate of 2.8 per gillnet lift in 1989.  It is possible that this is a result of increasing panfish and northern pike.     Northern pike have been increasing slowly since 1973 to a catch rate of 17.6 in 1989.  Size is good on northern with individuals in excess of 30 inches.  Average weight of northern has remained stable since the 1955 assessment.     Walleye abundance was low at 0.2 fish per trap net lift in 1989.  Walleye have been declining in Park Lake throughout assessment history.  Stocking and survey data suggest that Park Lake is dependent on stocking as one would expect given lack of spawning area and the history of panfish abundance.  While stocking has not produced walleye in great numbers, the average size produced is impressive.  The average size in the nets has ranged from 1.7 to 5.1 pounds.</p>",

Size tends to be small with the average northern pike measuring 18.4 inches, although fish to 32.9 inches were reported.     Walleyes, while not abundant, average 16.4 inches in length with an occasional fish over 20 inches.     Abundant bluegill, black crappie and pumpkinseeds will keep the panfish angler busy with 6 to 8 inch fish.     Largemouth bass is the other major predator in Park Lake.  Size structure is excellent with 45% of the bass over 15 inches.  The bulrush beds along the north side of the lake provide the best largemouth bass cover and should be protected.     Three species of bullhead and yellow perch round out the angling opportunities on Park Lake.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Park Lake is a 376 acre lake located near Mahtowa, Minnesota with 100% littoral area and a maximum depth of 16 feet. Park Lake is accessible on the southeastern corner of the lake off county road 7.  Park Lake is primarily managed for walleye and largemouth bass.  More than 54,000 walleye fingerlings and 1,000 yearlings were stocked between 1990 and 2012.  Park was last assessed in 2004.  Park was assessed in 2012 to help evaluate the walleye fingerling stocking program as well as update information on other fish populations. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye fingerlings are stocked into Park Lake at a rate of one pound per littoral acre (376 pounds) during even years.  Walleye abundance of 0.8 per gillnet lift was down from 2004 (1.1) and below average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Walleye gillnet CPUE from six investigations since 1979 have ranged from 0.2 to 1.6 per lift.  Not enough individuals were sampled to evaluate stock density or growth.  All of the walleye sampled (7) were aged to years that walleye were stocked.  Despite stocking numerous year-classes since 1990, the success of the biennial fingerling stocking program appears limited.    <br> \n <br> \nA total of 47 largemouth bass were sampled by electrofishing.  The largemouth bass catch rate of 86.2 fish per hour of electrofishing was up from 2004 (19.6).  Largemouth bass average length was 12.9 inches and growth was slow compared to other Duluth Area lakes.  All year-classes from 2001 through 2010 were represented except 2008.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike abundance of 12.7 per gillnet lift was down from 2004 (13.2) and above average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Average size was 18.9 inches and growth was slow compared to other Duluth Area lakes.  All year-classes from 2003 to 2011 were represented, except 2004.   <br> \n <br> \nBluegill abundance of 9.2 per trapnet lift was down slightly from 2004 (9.4) and was average when compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Average length of sampled bluegills was 6.8 inches and growth was slow compared to other Duluth Area lakes.  All year-classes from 2003 to 2011 were represented, except 2008.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie abundance of 1.0 per lift was up slightly from 2004 (0.9) and was average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Average size was 6.5 inches but not enough individuals were captured to evaluate stock density or growth.  All year-classes from 2003 to 2011 were represented, except 2006 and 2008.   <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch abundance of 29.2 per gillnet lift was down from 2006 (120.2) and above average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Average length was 6.1 inches and growth was average compared other Duluth Area lakes.  All year-classes from 2002 through 2008 were represented. <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species sampled include black, brown and yellow bullhead, Iowa darter, Johnny darter, central mudminnow, bluntnose minnow, fathead minnow, rock bass, white sucker, hybrid sunfish and pumpkinseed sunfish. <br> \n <br> \nPark Lake was included in an index of biotic integrity (IBI) assessment in 2012.  In addition to standard gillnets and trapnets, beach seines and backpack electrofishing equipment were used to index species richness of the nearshore lake habitat.   <br> \n</p>",

Walleye numbers are not impressive, but during the 1999 survey crews noticed several anglers targeting walleye.  There are fair to good populations of northern pike, although most are the \"hammerhandle\" variety.  There are fair to good populations of largemouth bass, yellow perch, black crappie, and bluegill.  The relative abundance of keeper sized walleye, largemouth bass, black crappie, and bluegill are impressive.             Based on the spring electrofishing assessments, the woody cover and bulrush beds on the north side of the lake are important to the largemouth bass and panfish and should be protected.</p>",

The public access is on the southeastern corner of the lake off county road 7. Park Lake is primarily managed for Walleye and Largemouth Bass. Park was last assessed in 2012 and sampled in 2022 to update information on fish populations. <br> \n <br> \nMore than 54,000 Walleye fingerlings and 1,000 yearlings were stocked between 1990 and 2012. Due to the poor return of Walleye, stocking now occurs only when surplus Mississippi River strain Walleye are available. Walleye abundance of 0.2 per gillnet lift was down from 2012 (0.8) and below average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type. Gillnet abundance from seven investigations since 1979 has ranged from 0.2 to 1.6 per lift. Not enough individuals were sampled to evaluate stock density or growth.  <br> \n <br> \nA total of 37 Largemouth Bass were sampled by electrofishing. The Largemouth Bass catch rate of 45.5 fish per hour of electrofishing was up from 2012 (86.2). Average length was 14.1 inches and growth was slow compared to other Duluth Area lakes. All year-classes from 2011 through 2021 were represented.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike abundance of 9.4 per gillnet lift was down from 2012 (12.7) and above average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type. Average size was 19.1 inches and growth was slow compared to other Duluth Area lakes.  <br> \n <br> \nBluegill abundance of 15 per trapnet lift was up from 2012 (9.2) and was average when compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type. Average length was 6.1 inches and growth was slow compared to other Duluth Area lakes. All year-classes from 2016 to 2020 were represented.  <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie abundance of 3.6 per lift was up from 2012 (1.0) and was average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type. Average size was 7.6 inches but not enough individuals were captured to evaluate stock density or growth. All year-classes from 2013 to 2021 were represented.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch abundance of 5.1 per gillnet lift was down from 2012 (7.8) and below average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.

                "narrative": "<p>Park Lake is a 376 acre lake located near Mahtowa, Minnesota with 100% littoral area and a maximum depth of 16 feet.  Park Lake is accessible on the southeastern corner of the lake off county road 7.  Park Lake is primarily managed for walleye and largemouth bass.  More than 18,000 walleye fingerlings and 1,000 yearlings were stocked in even years between 1990 and 2004.       Walleye abundance of 1.1 fish/gillnet was below average compared to Minnesota lakes of similar type.  The mean length of walleye captured was 21.9 inches.  Eighty percent of fish were 20 inches or greater and one fish measured 30.9 inches.  Walleye growth was average compared to other Duluth area lakes.  Correlation between age classes and years stocked was 67% in 2004 and 85% in 1999.     Largemouth bass electrofishing catch rates were average for Duluth area bass populations, despite decreasing from 81.7 per hour in 1999 to 19.6 per hour in 2004.  Poor water clarity and cool water temperatures may have influenced catch rates in 2004.  Mean length was 13.9 inches, and fish growth was average for Duluth Area lakes.  Largemouth bass were also sampled in gillnets and trapnets and fish as large as 21.7 inches were captured.  In 2004, 73% were age 6 or less.      Black crappie abundance was 0.9 fish/trapnet.  This value is average for Minnesota lakes of similar type, but decreased considerably from the 1999 survey (7.2 fish/trapnet).  Mean length was 8.8 inches, and growth was average for Duluth Area lakes.  Age analysis revealed consistent recruitment between 1997 and 2002.     Bluegill abundance was average for Minnesota lakes of similar type with a catch of 9.4 fish/trapnet.  Mean length of was 5.7 inches, and growth was considered slow for Duluth Area lakes.  Forty-one percent of bluegills were larger than 6 inches, but none were larger than 8 inches.  Sixty-seven percent of the fish captured in 2004 were born in 1998.     Northern pike abundance was above average for Minnesota lakes with 13.2 fish captured per gillnet.  This value exceeded the 1999 catch rate of 8.1 fish/gillnet and was the second highest ever recorded for Park Lake.  Mean length of northern pike was 18.2 inches, but few (<2%) fish were 21 inches or greater, and growth was slow compared to other Duluth Area populations.  Age analysis revealed consistent recruitment with 89% of fish younger than age 5.     Yellow perch abundance was 5.0 fish/gillnet and was below average from Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Although yellow perch abundance has decreased, the percentage of fish greater than 8 inches increased from 18% in 1999 to 73% in 2004.  Mean length of yellow perch was 8.7 inches, and growth was average compared to other Duluth Area populations.  Age analysis revealed consistent recruitment with a strong 1997 year class.     Other fish species sampled included black bullhead, brown bullhead, pumpkinseed, and rock bass.     Results from the 2004 population assessment suggest that bass continue to do well; however, walleye have responded little to the increased frequency of fingerling and yearling stockings.  The high density of northern pike most likely limits the success of fingerling walleye stockings.           </p>",
