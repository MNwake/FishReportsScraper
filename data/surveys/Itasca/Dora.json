                "narrative": "<p>Dora Lake is a lake class 39 lake located 4 miles west of Wirt, MN in northwest Itasca County.  Dora is a riverine system with inlets from the Bowstring and Popple Rivers and an outlet to the Big Fork River.  Dora Lake is shallow with a maximum depth of 18 ft and a littoral area of 94%.  Wild rice and other aquatic vegetation is abundant.  The lake has been known to periodically winterkill. <br> \n <br> \nThe walleye gill-net catch rate increased from 0.6/net in 1998 to 1.9/net in 2006.  The 2006 catch rate was within the lake class normal range and similar to the long-term average for Dora Lake.  Sampled walleye ranged in length from 7.7 to 22.0 inches and growth was similar to the statewide average.  Ages 1, 3-5, 8, 9 and 12 were represented in the sample.  Good natural reproduction of walleye has historically occurred in the lakes and rivers connected to Dora Lake.  Gill-net catch rates in Dora Lake should be interpreted cautiously since there is likely considerable fish movement in and out of Dora Lake on a seasonal basis. <br> \n <br> \nThe northern pike gill-net catch rate was 5.2/net in 2006.  This catch rate was well above the 1998 catch of 1.3/net, but near the historical average for Dora Lake.  Gill-net sampled pike ranged in length from 10.1 to 25.0 inches, with an average length of 17.7 inches.  Growth was similar to the statewide average. <br> \n <br> \nThe gill-net catch rate for yellow perch was 52.2/net in the 2006 assessment.  This catch rate was above the lake class normal range, but fairly typical for Dora Lake.  Gill-net sampled perch ranged in length from 5.2 to 10.9 inches with an average length of 7.5 inches.  Approximately half of the perch examined were infested with the parasites yellow grub and/or Neascus (black spot). <br> \n <br> \nThe trap-net catch rate for bluegill was below the lake class normal range at 2.1/net.  Sampled bluegill ranged in length from 6.0 to 10.2 inches with an average length of 7.9 inches. <br> \n <br> \nSimilar to previous assessments, the gill-net catch rate for black bullhead was in the normal range for this lake class at 12.1/net.  Other species sampled included bowfin, brown bullhead, golden and shorthead redhorse, pumpkinseed and hybrid sunfish, rock bass and white sucker.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Dora Lake is located in northwest Itasca County near Wirt, MN and is part of the Big Fork River watershed in the Hudson Bay drainage.  This riverine lake is a widening of the Big Fork River.  Dora Lake covers 447 acres and has a maximum depth of 18 ft.  Partial winterkills have occurred occasionally.  The water is bog stained and aquatic vegetation is abundant. <br> \n <br> \nThe lake management plan (LMP) was last revised in 2007.  Goals of the LMP were to maintain a strong Walleye spawning population in the lake and the upper Bigfork River watershed, and maintain a resident Walleye population at 2.0/gill net.  A standard survey was conducted in 2019 to determine the status of the fish community.   <br> \n <br> \nWalleye:  Catch rates for Walleye have been relatively low compared to similar lakes.  Spawning habitat has been rated as fair, but good natural reproduction has historically occurred in the lakes and rivers connected to Dora.  Though juvenile and adult habitat conditions in Dora Lake are poor, Walleye are found seasonally, particularly during the spring.  The 1986 catch was the lowest on record and occurred during a period of annual fry stocking.  Walleye stocking was discontinued by the DNR after 1995 because it did not appear to contribute to the fishery.  The Dora Lake Walleye Restoration Association has purchased fry since 2010 but these efforts have also not improved Walleye numbers.  The 2019 catch of 0.5/net was lower than the long-term average of 1.8/net, despite stocking eight times from 2010 to 2018.  It does not appear that stocking is an effective tool to increase Walleye numbers in Dora Lake, given the results of the previous efforts.  The four Walleye sampled ranged from 15.5 to 18.8 inches.  Interestingly, three of the four Walleye sampled were aged from the 2015 year-class that happened to be the only year that fry were not stocked. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike:  Catch rates for Northern Pike have been low compared to similar lakes.  Size structure has generally been poor, and no pike over 28 inches have been sampled in the last three surveys.  Pike sampled in 2019 ranged from 11.5 to 21.4 inches and averaged 17.2 inches.  Poor size quality and low numbers may limit the popularity of the pike fishery.   <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch:  Catch rates for Yellow Perch have been high compared to lakes with similar habitats.  Perch in Dora Lake should be large enough to be of interest to anglers.  The sampled perch ranged from 4.9 to 11.4 inches and averaged 7.9 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nBluegill:  Catch rates for Bluegill were low compared to other lakes with similar habitats.  Sizes ranged from 6.1 to 9.4 inches but averaged 7.6 inches.  The lake appears to provide good opportunities for low catches of large Bluegill. <br> \n  <br> \nOther species captured include Black Bullhead, Black Crappie, Bowfin, Brown Bullhead, Pumpkinseed Sunfish, Rock Bass, Shorthead Redhorse, White Sucker, and Yellow Bullhead. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>The northern pike gill net catch rates (CPUE's) are near median levels when compared to the mean for all lakes statewide that are ecologically similar and grouped into lake class #16. The average weight has steadily increased from 1.3 lbs/fish in 1957 to 2.6 lbs./fish in 1991 bringing these weights above lake class medians.  Growth rates appear to be normal with 52% of the sample being age class III.The black and brown bullhead populations were controlled in the years of intensive rough fish removal from 1947 to 1971, but in the 1980 assessment the population had risen to a gill net CPUE of 74.3.  In the winter of 1980-81 over 47,000 pounds were removed and the 1991 assessment revealed these populations to be at a much lower level with a gill net CPUE of 12.4 and average size has remained constant.Centrarchid populations have always been low in this lake but have remained relatively stable with black crappie being sought most frequently.Yellow perch abundance is very high with CPUE's over the years always being well above the third quartile levels for this lake classification while size remains constant.The walleye CPUE's consistently are below the first quartile figures in this lake class dspite a long intensive fry stocking program.  Fry stocking has taken place every year since 1979 and has failed to provide a strong year class.  Fingerlings were stocked in 1978 and 1979 and did not establish a significant year class.  The 1980 assessment showed almost 70% of the sample coming from years with no stocking.  In the seining results over the years it is common to capture young-of-the-year but it is inconclusive to determine if these are stocked fish.  Seining results from 1975, a non-stocked year, find young-of-the-year as part of the sample.  The walleye habitat in the Bigfork, Popple and Bowstring Rivers provides good holding and spawning facilities.  Walleye abundance in Dora Lake may be closely associated with migration, abundance and spawning success in the adjacent river systems.</p>",

Wild rice and submersed aquatic vegetation is abundant.  Fish movement, especially in the spring, is considerable and gill net catches should be interpreted cautiously.  Walleye gill net catch was 0.6 fish/net which was below the expected range for similar lakes.  Length varied from 12 to 15 inches and average weight was 0.8 pounds.  Anglers contacted during the survey reported good fishing for walleye and nothern pike.Northern pike gill net catch was 1.3 fish/net which is below the expected range for similar lakes.  Length varied from 12 to 25 inches and mean weight was 1.6 pounds.  Dora Lake is shallow with abundant vegetation, which likely provides a nursery area for both walleye and northern pike.Yellow perch, which are an important prey species, had a gill net catch was 92 fish/set which above the expected range for similar lakes.  Length varied from 4.5 to 11 inches, however, most of the fish were less than 9 inches.  Only two black crappie and bluegill were sampled.  Other species sampled include black bullhead, bowfin, brown bullhead, rock bass, shorthead redhorse, white sucker, pumpkinseed sunfish, and yellow bullhead</p>",
