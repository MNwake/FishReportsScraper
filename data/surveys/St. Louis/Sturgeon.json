                "narrative": "<p>Little Sturgeon Lake is located about 14 miles northwest of Chisholm, MN and within the Little Fork River Watershed.  The 247 acre lake has 54 littoral acres with a 22 foot max depth, and is relatively developed along the 3.6 mile shoreline.  The public access is on the north side of the Sturgeon River between Little Sturgeon and Side Lake with parking for five rigs.  Little Sturgeon is part of the larger Sturgeon Lake chain with an outlet to the Sturgeon River and Side Lake and inlets from Sturgeon and South Sturgeon Lakes. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike were the most abundant fish sampled in gill nets, at a rate slightly higher than the previous assessment.  The catch rate exceeded the expected range for lakes similar to Little Sturgeon.  Size structure appeared moderate with 34% of the fish sampled were 24 inches or greater, however there was none sampled over 30 inches.  Lengths ranged from 15.8-30.1 inches with an average length of 22 inches.  Scale analysis indicated that six ages were sampled with fish up to age-7 in the sample.  Growth was near the statewide average for all ages.  Northern pike averaged 22 inches by age 4. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill were sampled in trap nets within the lake class expected range, however the rate was less than the previous assessment.  The catch rate was slightly higher in the gill net sample than the previous assessment.  Size structure appeared moderate with fish sampled up to nine inches, however only 6% of the sample was eight inches or greater.  Trap net lengths ranged from 3.3-9 inches with an average length of 6.0 inches.  Within the trap net sample, seven age classes were identified through scale analysis with fish up to age-11 present.  Back calculated length-at-age indicated growth was similar to the lake class 5 averages except ages 3-5, which were slightly less.  Bluegill averaged almost six inches by age-6. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie were the second most abundant fish sampled in gill nets, exceeding the expected range, while the trap net catch rate was near the low end of the expected range.  The previous gill net catch rate was within the expected range, while the trap net catch rate was less than expected.  Size structure was moderate for gill net sampled fish with an average length of almost seven inches and 6% of the sample exceeding ten inches.  Lengths ranged from 4.4-11.1 inches in the gill net sample, however one 13 inch fish was sampled in a trap net.  Eight age classes were identified through scale analysis with fish up to age-9 present in the sample.  Growth was slow early, but similar to the statewide average by age-3.  Black crappie averaged over nine inches by age-6. <br> \n <br> \nThe walleye catch rate was 2.2/gill net, at the low end of the expected range.  This was the highest observed catch rate; previous assessment catch rates were lower than the expected range.  Size structure appeared moderate with lengths ranging from 12.6-24.6 inches with an average length of 18 inches.  Scale analysis indicated four age classes present in the sample with fish up to age-7 present.  Age 4 fish were well represented in the sample, comprising 61% of the catch.  Growth was similar to the statewide average for all ages.  Walleye averaged 17 inches by age 4.  <br> \n <br> \nGill net sampled yellow perch were at a rate near the middle of the expected range, yet lower than the previous assessment which was the highest observed rate.  Size was moderately poor with an average length of 6.5 inches, ranging from 5.4-8.5 inches.  The tullibee catch was slightly less than the previous assessment, yet still within the expected range.  Lengths ranged from 8.3-15.1 inches with an average length of 10.2 inches.  Other species sampled include golden redhorse, hybrid, sunfish, pumpkinseed sunfish, golden shiner, rock bass, shorthead redhorse, silver redhorse, and white sucker. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Little Sturgeon Lake is located approximately 14 miles northwest of Chisholm, MN and within the Little Fork River Watershed.  The 247 acre lake has 54 littoral acres with a 22 foot maximum depth, and is moderately developed along the 3.6 mile shoreline.  A public access is located on the north side of the Sturgeon River between Little Sturgeon and Side Lake with parking for five rigs.  Little Sturgeon Lake is part of the larger Sturgeon Lake chain and outlets through the Sturgeon River to Side Lake.  There are inlets from both Sturgeon and South Sturgeon Lakes. Little Sturgeon Lake has low fertility and very soft water, both of which limit fish production.  <br> \n <br> \nThe 2010 Lake Management Plan (LMP) lists Black Crappie, Northern Pike and Walleye as primary species for management and Bluegill as a secondary species.  The LMP goals were to: maintain a Black Crappie trap net or gill net catch near 2.0/net; maintain a Northern Pike gill net catch near 5.0/net; maintain a Walleye gill net catch of 2.0/net and to maintain a Bluegill trap net catch near 12.0/net. <br> \n <br> \nA standard survey was conducted in June of 2016 to assess the status and characteristics of the fish community using six gill nets and nine trap nets.   <br> \n <br> \nLittle Sturgeon Lake has a small Walleye population maintained by natural reproduction and/or immigration. Walleye fingerlings were stocked annually from 2005 - 2010 and in 2014 at a rate of 1 lb./littoral acre (54 lbs.) but did not appear to contribute to the fishery, as most captured walleye have been associated with non-stocked year classes.  Walleye were captured at a rate of 1.0/gill net, which is below what would be expected for lakes with similar habitats.  Gill net catch rates have been below the management goal of 2.0/gill net in five of six surveys conducted since 1984.  A total of six Walleye were captured in gill nets ranging in length from 13.6 to 18.2 inches with an average weight of 2.2 pounds.  Walleye growth was below the statewide average with an average length of 14.1 inches at age-4. Three year classes were represented in the sample, but only one fish corresponded to a year when the lake was stocked.   <br> \n <br> \nThe Northern Pike catch rate decreased from 7.3/gill net in 2009 to 4.3/gill net, which met the management goal. Little Sturgeon Lake has a history of relatively high pike abundance as gill net catches have been near the upper limit of what would be typical of lakes with similar habitats. Northern Pike captured in gill nets ranged in length from 16.2 - 34.0 inches with an average length of 20.4 inches.  Size structure in 2016 was poor as only one fish captured was greater than 28 inches in length.  However, Little Sturgeon Lake has the potential to produce larger Northern Pike as fish over 28 inches have been sampled in four of six surveys.  Anglers are encouraged to release Northern Pike greater than 22 inches to improve size quality.  Analysis of ageing structures identified four consecutive age classes, ages 3 - 6.  Northern Pike attained an average length of 18.8 inches at age-4, similar to that found in previous surveys.   <br> \n <br> \nThe Black Crappie catch rates of 2.3/trap net and 2.7/gill net both exceeded the management goals of 2.0/net.  Black Crappie gill and trap net catch rates have been variable in previous surveys, but typical of lakes with similar habitats in five of six surveys.  Size structure in 2016 was moderate as 17% of the Black Crappie measured were greater than 10 inches in length.  Growth appeared slower than both the 2009 survey and the statewide average, with an average length of 8.1 inches at age-5.  Six consecutive age classes (ages 2-7) were represented in the sample.  However, slow growth and harvest may be impacting size structure as only one Black Crappie over 12.0 inches has been sampled in six surveys.   <br> \n <br> \nBluegill were captured at a rate of 7.8/trap net.  Bluegill trap net catch rates have been within the typical range for lakes with similar habitat in all surveys.  Bluegill size structure appears to have improved considerably as 26% of the Bluegill measured were greater than 8 inches in length, compared to 6% in 2009.   Management goals for both abundance and size structure were met. Seven consecutive age classes were represented in the sample, ages 3-9.  Bluegill growth was slow with an average length of 5.6 inches at age-6.   <br> \n <br> \nThe Yellow Perch catch rate of 4.7/gill net was similar to 4.5/gill net in 2009 and within the typical range for lakes with similar habitats.  The 2009 and 2016 gill net catch rates were the lowest observed in six surveys.  All Yellow Perch sampled were less than eight inches, and few over eight inches have been sampled in previous surveys.   <br> \n <br> \nThe Tullibee catch rate of 1.0/gill net was the lowest observed in any survey.  However, Tullibee have not been abundant historically as gill net catches in previous surveys have ranged from 1.4 - 4.3/net.   <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled included: Golden Redhorse, Golden Shiner, Hybrid Sunfish, Pumpkinseed Sunfish, Shorthead Redhorse, Silver Redhorse and White Sucker.   <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

Centrarchid species have fluctuated in abundance in the last 6 years but have stayed closed to lake class averages.  Crappie numbers have increased while the majority are age II fish.  Bluegill populations show very slow growth rates which is not unusual for this type of lake but over 50% of the sampled fish are age class VI and older.Northern pike abundance increased slightly from 1984 and are well above state and lake class medians, with a normal size range.  Yellow perch numbers have increased from the last survey and are well above medians for this type of lake.Walleye abundance sampled in this assessment is low, although fishing reports for walleye were good.  The majority of walleye sampled do not coincide with stocking done on this lake but most year classes compare well with the fry stocking done on West Sturgeon and fingerling stocking on South Sturgeon, which began in 1985 with the use of the Sturgeon Pond.  Migration between lake basins in this Sturgeon Lake river system may contribute to the walleye population in the whole system.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Little Sturgeon Lake is located approximately 14 miles northwest of Chisholm, MN and within the Little Fork River Watershed.  The 247-acre lake has 54 littoral acres with a 22 foot maximum depth, and is moderately developed along the 3.6 mile shoreline.  A public access is located on the north side of the Sturgeon River between Little Sturgeon and Side Lake with parking for five rigs.  Little Sturgeon Lake is part of the larger Sturgeon Lake chain and outlets through the Sturgeon River.  There are inlets from both Sturgeon and South Sturgeon Lakes. Little Sturgeon Lake has low fertility and very soft water, both of which limit fish production.  <br> \n <br> \nThe 2017 Lake Management Plan (LMP) lists Black Crappie and Bluegill as primary species for management and Walleye as a secondary species.  The LMP goals were to: maintain a Black Crappie trap net or gill net catch near 2.0/net; maintain a Bluegill trap net catch near 8.0/net and increase the Walleye gill net catch to 2.0/net.  A targeted survey was conducted in June of 2023 primarily to evaluate Walleye management using gill nets.   <br> \n <br> \nLittle Sturgeon Lake has a small Walleye population maintained by natural reproduction and/or immigration. The 2023 survey evaluated a period where Walleye were stocked 11 times from 2003 through 2021.  Walleye were captured at a rate of 0.8/gill net.  The catch was the lowest since 1990 and below what would be expected for lakes with similar habitats.  Catch rates have been below the management goal of 2.0/gill net in six of seven surveys conducted since 1984.  The five sampled fish ranged from 18.4 to 24.2 inches and averaged 3.0 pounds.  Sample sizes were too low to evaluate growth but five age-classes ranging from 6 to 15 years old were identified.  No fish corresponding to the 2021 and 2019 stockings were sampled and only one from the 2017 stocking.  It appears stocking has not made a noticeable improvement to the fishery as the catches have remained very low. <br> \n <br> \nThe Black Crappie catch of 2.7/gill net exceeded the management goals of 2.4/net.  Black Crappie gill and trap net catches have been variable in previous surveys, but typical of lakes with similar habitats.  Size structure in 2023 was poor: only three fish longer than 8 inches were sampled and none over 10 inches.  Slow growth and harvest may hinder size structure as only one Black Crappie over 12.0 inches has ever been sampled.   <br> \n <br> \nBluegill are a management species but were not targeted in this survey.  Generally, Bluegill trap net catch rates have been within the typical range for lakes with similar habitat.  Management goals for numbers and size were met in the previous survey and appears to have improved over time. <br> \n  <br> \nNorthern Pike catches have been relatively stable, ranging from 5.2 to 7.3/gill net since 1984. The 2023 catch of 5.8/gill net was near the upper limit of what would be typical of lakes with similar habitats.  Size structure in 2023 was modest with one fish over 30 inches sampled, an average size of nearly 22 inches and 28 percent in the 22 - 26 inch range.  Little Sturgeon has shown some potential to produce larger pike as fish over 28 inches have been sampled in five of seven surveys.  Anglers are encouraged to release larger pike to improve size quality.  Age and growth information was not collected in 2023 because the survey was directed at Walleye management. <br> \n <br> \nThe Yellow Perch numbers declined to an all-time low in survey history, 1.7/net.  The last three surveys documented a declining trend in perch catches following the record high in 2002.  Yellow Perch are an important component of many fisheries, primarily as a prey but often as a sportfish as well. Few Yellow Perch would be of a desirable size to anglers.  The sampled fish ranged from 5.8 to 10.0 inches and averaged 7.0 inches.  The decline may be influencing the growth and survival of game species such as Walleye and Northern Pike. <br> \n <br> \nTullibee are an important prey species for larger predators like Northern Pike and Walleye.  In the last five surveys, the catch has declined from a high of 4.3/gill net to the low of 0.3/gill net in 2023. The two sampled fish were 10.3 and 12.2 inches long. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers and boaters are reminded to help slow the spread of invasive species by removing all aquatic plants from boats, trailers and equipment.  All drain plugs must be removed and live/bait wells drained before leaving the access.  Anglers and boaters are also encouraged to power-wash and thoroughly dry all equipment prior to use in another water body.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lakes like Little Sturgeon typically support modest populations of panfish and northern pike and occasionally walleye.  The walleye gill net catch rate in Little Sturgeon Lake has historically been low.  Walleye sampled in the gill nets had a mean length of 14.8 inches and a mean weight of 1.3 pounds.  Walleye have only been stocked once, so they are either reproducing in the lake or migrating from other lakes in the chain.       Northern pike were sampled in the gill nets at a rate within the expected range for this type of lake.  Northern pike sampled in gill nets had a mean length of 20.3 inches and a mean weight of 1.8 pounds.     The yellow perch gill net catch rate is within the expected range.  Yellow perch, along with tullibee, are important forage for walleye and northern pike.  Perch captured in the gill nets ranged from 4.9 to 6.5 inches in length.     Tullibee were sampled in the gill nets at a rate within the expected range, despite the fact that sufficient oxygen disappears after about 10 feet.  Many of the tullibee were infested with Trianophorus.      The bluegill trap net catch rate was the highest on record for this lake but was still within the expected range.  The bluegill captured ranged from 3.3 to 8.3 inches in length.     The black crappie trap net catch is the highest on record and exceeds the expected range.  These fish ranged from 3.8 to 11.0 inches in length.  The gill net catch rate is the lowest observed but still in the expected range.     Although no largemouth bass have ever been sampled in the gill or trap nets, 67 young-of-year bass were captured while seining.  Other species captured in this assessment include:  golden shiner, white sucker, silver redhorse, rock bass, pumpkinseed sunfish, hybrid sunfish, shorthead redhorse, common shiner, Johnny darter and spottail shiner.     The amount of emergent vegetation, an important habitat for many gamefish, is very limited on Little Sturgeon Lake and lakeshore owners should consider protecting the remaining stands.  Additionally, lakeshore owners may be able to maintain or improve water quality by practicing wise use of the shoreline and surrounding watershed.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Little Sturgeon Lake is a 266-acre lake in St. Louis County within the Little Fork River watershed.  Little Sturgeon is approximately 14 miles northwest of Chisholm, MN.  The lake has a maximum depth of 22 ft and 54 littoral acres (area 15 ft deep or less).  A public access is located on the northeast shore near the outlet.  Little Sturgeon is part of the larger Sturgeon Lake chain with an outlet to the Sturgeon River and an inlet from Sturgeon Lake.  Water clarity is poor with a secchi disk reading of 4.5 ft.  Poor water clarity is due to bog stain.Walleye gill-net catch was 1.2/gill net which was lower than the expected range for similar lakes.  Fish varied in length from 12 to 21 inches.  Abundance in past assessments varied from 0.6 to 1.8/gill net.  Although little Sturgeon Lake is not as well suited to walleye management as other lakes in the Sturgeon Lake chain, fish stocked in other lakes in the chain can migrate freely throughout the system.  Growth was similar to statewide averages with fish reaching 16 inches in 4 years.Northern pike gill-net catch was 6.5/net, which was higher than the expected range.  Northern pike gill-net catch has varied from 5.2 to 6.6/net in previous assessments.  Size structure was poor with few fish larger than 24 inches.  Bluegill trap-net catch was 12.7/net, which was within the expected range.  Abundance in past assessments has varied from 5.5 to 18.2/trap net.  Size structure was moderate with a few fish greater than 8 inches.  Growth for ages 1 through 8 was similar to the lake class average.  However, compared to many other lake classes, bluegill grew slowly with fish reaching preferred length of 8 inches in 9 years.  Black crappie gill-net catch was 1.8/net, which was similar to the expected range.  Although abundance was low, size structure was good with fish up to 10 inches sampled.  Yellow perch gill-net catch was 15.0/net, which was slightly higher than the expected range.  Abundance in past assessments was 9.8 to 14.6/gill net.  Size structure was poor with no fish larger than 8 inches.  Other species sampled include golden shiner, pumpkinseed sunfish, rock bass, shorthead redhorse, silver redhorse, tullibee, and white sucker.Lakeshore owners may affect fish populations not only through harvesting fish, but also through land use practices.  It is important to leave a 30 to 50 ft buffer strip of native vegetation along the shoreline to prevent erosion and provide habitat for fish and wildlife.  Nonfunctioning septic systems can also lead to water quality problems.  Good water quality and fish populations are the direct result of good land use practices.  Anglers can also help to improve the size structure of the fish community by practicing selective harvest.</p>",
