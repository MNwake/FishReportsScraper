Yellow perch were introduced in 2000 to augment the forage base.  A lake survey was conducted on the lake in 2001 to determine if the walleye introductions had been successful.  The results indicate that the walleye stockings were not succesful as none were sampled during the survey.The yellow perch introduction was very successful with high numbers collected during the survey.  Yellow perch up to 11.4 inches were collected, with approximately 50% of the fish between 9.0 inches and 11.4 inches.No other fish other than minnows were sampled in nets during this survey.</p>",

The maximum depth is 6.5 feet and it has dark brown bog stained water.  The access is a narrow gravel back down off of USFS Road #102 (Snake Trail).  The only fish sampled in 2019 were Yellow Perch and Central Mudminnows.  Finland Fisheries has tried to make Osier Lake into a sport fishery by stocking Walleye fry and adult Yellow Perch.  In the following assessments only perch were sampled, with the numbers greatly increasing and average size greatly decreasing over time.  The 2019 Yellow Perch gill net catch was 45/net which would be considered very high for lakes of this type.  However, the average size was only about 5 inches and without the presence of a predator the Yellow Perch are of little value to most anglers.  With some sparse wild rice present, Osier Lake is currently more value to duck hunters than fishermen.</p>",

Lake bed soil in the shallow waters is divided into approximately 65 percent mud or mixed mud and detritus, and 35 percent hard sand mixed with rubble and gravel. Lowland bog surrounds the entire lake except for a portion of the south shore and a small upland knob near the outlet. The dry outlet observed may not be an outlet at all, but an inlet draining boggy lowlands. A secchi disc could be seen in water up to 6.1 feet. Trap nets and gill nets caught only White Sucker. Brook Stickleback, small minnow like fish, were taken while shoreline seining.No boats of cottages were seen and there is no designated public access. These indications in addition to the shallow nature of the lake would seem to reveal that fishing pressure, if present at all, is very light.Notes by Fisheries Biologist:  Osier Lake would be best classed as a sucker-minnow lake. The lake survey indicated that only White Sucker and Brook Stickleback are present. However, there seems to be fair to goodly numbers of White Sucker. With the presence of these forage fishes, Northern Pike stocking might be successful. During higher water years, Northern Pike might even find spawning facilities in the bog areas around the lake.Due to the shallow nature of the lake, there is possibly danger of periodic winterkill.</p>",
