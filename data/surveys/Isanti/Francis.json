                "narrative": "<p>  Lake Francis is a 301 acre lake with a maximum depth of only seven feet.  The lake frequently undergoes low oxygen and winterkill conditions, although complete kills are probably rare.  Fish can enter Lake Francis through an outlet that connects it with the Rum River; this allows for natural repopulation of the lake following a winterkill, but also allows carp to move freely into the lake.  DNR Fisheries crews conducted a survey on Lake Francis in June 1993 to evaluate the fish population and habitat.  Northern pike are the primary game fish species present in this lake.  The number of northern pike netted in this survey was average for this type of lake.  The mean weight was 4.1 pounds, and lengths ranged from 15.8 to 33.7 inches.  Black crappie and bluegill have never been abundant in Lake Francis, and the 1993 netting was no exception.  Poor water quality and frequent winterkills keep these species from establishing large populations in this lake.  The black crappies that were seen were all fairly large, with a mean length of 10.4 inches.  Yellow perch have always been fairly abundant in Lake Francis, but numbers were down from the 1983 survey and were in the normal range in 1993.  Unusually high numbers of large yellow perch were seen during the survey; 40% of the perch caught in trap nets were 10 inches or longer.  However, these large perch were generally thin and in poor condition.  Black bullheads were very abundant in gill and trap nets.  All of the black bullheads were between 5 and 7 inches long.  Other species netted in this survey included carp, white sucker, and three minnow species.  Report prepared by Deborah Sewell, Area Fisheries Specialist</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Francis is 301 acres with a maximum depth of eight feet.  The lake is extremely fertile and turbid.  The low water clarity inhibits aquatic plant growth.  Although complete kills are rare, winter oxygen levels often drop low enough to cause some gamefish mortality.  Fish migration from the Rum River repopulates the lake with gamefish, common carp, and white sucker.  A small county owned public access is located on the southeast end of the lake.  Northern pike were more abundant than in past surveys with a catch rate of 5.8 per net lift.  Northerns averaged 23.7 inches and 3.3 pounds and ranged from 17.6 to 32.3 inches.  The crappie catch also increased to normal abundance levels for the lake type.  Trapnetted crappies averaged 9 inches with some fish exceeding 12 inches.  The yellow perch catch was typical.  Although many fish exceeded 9 inches, they appeared thin.Carp, white sucker, and bullheads were present in numbers similar to past assessments and lake class norms.  Roughfish were removed by commercial netting in the past, but migration from the Rum River reestablished their populations.   Bluegill (0.3/trapnet) and largemouth bass (2.6/hr.) catches remained low.  A combination of low winter oxygen and limited habitat keep these populations depressed.Angling pressure is very light with only one angler observed during the survey.  Northern and crappie are present in catchable numbers with quality sizes available.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Francis is 301 acres with a maximum depth of eight feet. The lake is extremely fertile and turbid. The low water clarity inhibits aquatic plant growth. Although complete kills are rare, winter oxygen levels often drop low enough to cause some fish mortality. Fish migration from the Rum River repopulates the lake with gamefish, common Carp, and White Sucker. A small public access is located on the southeast end of the lake with parking for six rigs, which tends to limit summer angling pressure. Winter angling pressure has been high in recent years.  <br> \n <br> \nAnglers visiting Francis Lake can expect quality angling for numerous species.  Black Crappies were extremely abundant.  Three fourths of Crappies sampled by the trapnets exceeded nine inches in length.  Although the bulk of Crappies sampled by gillnet were between 5 and 6 inches, more than a fourth of that catch exceeded 9 inches as well.  The Bluegill catch was more typical of the lake type but they too should provide excellent angling opportunity with 75% of the trapnet sample in excess of 8 inches.  The Northern Pike were oriented to the shoreline resulting in a higher catch in the trapnets than in the gillnets.  Eighty six percent of the pike sampled by trapnets exceeded 24 inches with thirty nine percent 30 inches or better.  The Walleye population, a result of fry stocking following low winter oxygen levels in 2009 and 2010, was a little higher than in most similar lakes.  All of these 3 and 4 year old fish were over 16 inches in length.  Like Crappies, Yellow Perch were extremely abundant.  Perch should provide additional harvest opportunity with nearly a fourth of the catch (23%) eight inches or better.  Largemouth Bass were not particularly numerous but most were between 14 and 19 inches.</p>",
