BLB WERE CAPTURED IN NUMBERS 32.3 TIMES THE LOCAL MEDIAN AND 143.7 TIMES THE STATE MEDIAN FOR GILLNETS; 1.2 TIMES THE LOCAL MEDIAN AND 2.3 TIMES THE STATE MEDIAN FOR TRAPNETS.  FISH WERE RATED AT 6.1 PER POUND, WITH OVER HALF MEASURING BETWEEN 6.5 AND 6.9 INCHES TOTAL LENGTH AND ONLY 3 FISH OVER 10 INCHES.  BLG WERE SAMPLED IN NUMBERS 19.1 TIMES THE LOCAL MEDIAN AND 21.7 TIMES THE STATE MEDIAN FOR GILLNETS; 8.2 AND 9.8 TIMES THE LOCAL AND STATE MEDIANS, RESPECTIVELY, FOR TRAPNETS. PSD WAS CALCULATED AT 78.3%, WITH RSD=13.9%, AND ONE FISH MEASURED OVER 8 INCHES TOTAL LENGTH.  WAE WERE CAPTURED IN NUMBERS 4.7 TIMES THE LOCAL MEDIAN AND 1.7 TIMES THE STATE MEDIAN FOR GILLNETS; 2.6 AND 1.2 TIMES THE LOCAL AND STATE MEDIANS FOR TRAPNETS.  ONE FISH WAS AGE 4, THE REST WERE AGE 3.  GROWTH WAS ABOVE AVERAGE FOR THE FIRST AND FOURTH YEAR OF LIFE, BELOW AVERAGE FOR YEARS 2 AND 3.  YEB WERE SAMPLED IN NUMBERS 4.3 TIMES THE LOCAL MEDIAN AND 2.5 TIMES THE STATE MEDIAN FOR GILLNETS; 3.1 AND 1.4 TIMES THE LOCAL AND STATE MEDIANS FOR TRAPNETS.  FISH WERE RATED AT 1.6 PER POUND.  CARP WERE CAPTURED IN NUMBERS 5 AND 12.5 TIMES THE LOCAL AND STATE FOR GILLNETS BUT ONLY ABOUT 1/4 THE LOCAL AND STATE MEDIANS FOR TRAPNETS.  NOP WERE SAMPLED BY GILLNETS IN NUMBERS AND POUNDS SLIGHTLY ABOVE THE LOCAL AND STATE MEDIANS AND WERE NOT CAPTURED IN TRAPNETS.  FISH WERE AGE 3 AND 4, WITH GROWTH DURING THE FIRST TWO YEARS OF LIFE ABOVE AVERAGE AND BELOW AVERAGE FOR YEARS 3 AND 4.  BLC WERE CAPTURED IN NUMBERS BELOW THE LOCAL MEDIANS FOR GILLNETS AND TRAPNETS, BUT NEAR THE STATE MEDIANS.  TWELVE LMB CAPTURED IN THE NETS AND SEINE HAULS: 6 YOY, 1 AGE 1, 3 AGE 3, AND 2 AGE 6.  GROWTH WAS BELOW AVERAGE FOR YEARS 1,2, AND 6, ABOVE AVERAGE FOR THE REST:  2 MUE WERE CAPTURED, 1 AGE 3 LEECH LAKE STRAIN IN A GILLNET AND 1 AGE 5 WISCONSIN STRAIN IN A TRAPNET. BOTH FISH WERE SHORTER THAN THE MINIMUM LEGAL SIZE OF 36 INCHES.  HSF WERE CAPTURED IN NUMBERS 3.8 AND 7.5 TIMES THE LOCAL AND STATE MEDIAN FOR TRAPNETS.  ONE WTS, ONE GSF, THREE YEP, AND SEVEN PMK WERE ALSO CAPTURED IN THE NETS.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Virginia is a 172 acre class 24 lake that is connected to Smithtown Bay of Lake Minnetonka.  Water quality is poor.  Dissolved oxygen (DO) was below levels fish could tolerate 16 feet below the surface in June.  Anglers should not fish deep water during the summer months.  The winter of 2008-2009 saw dissolved oxygen drop to low levels.  No fish kills were reported.    <br> \n <br> \nThe predator community in Lake Virginia is dominated by northern pike.  Only two walleye were sampled.  Walleye abundance is below average.  Walleye average length was 18.1 inches.  Average weight was 2.12 pounds.  Walleye are not stocked into Lake Virginia, but neighboring Lake Minnetonka is stocked in even numbered years.  Northern pike numbers were average for this type of lake.  Mean weight of Lake Virginia northern pike was above average.  Fish over 30 inches in length were sampled.  In the 2009 population assessment largemouth bass abundance was average.  Keep in mind standard lake survey gear does not consistently provide an accurate estimate of largemouth bass abundance.    <br> \n <br> \nFive species of panfish are present in Lake Virginia.  Black crappie abundance is average.  No large fish were sampled, but the average size is good for a metro area lake.  Bluegill abundance remains high.  The size structure of bluegill in Lake Virginia is very good for a metro area lake.  Fully 67% of sampled bluegill were greater than 6 inches.  Yellow perch abundance in is within the average range.  Mean weight of yellow perch was average.   Pumpkinseed were sampled at an average abundance.  Hybrid sunfish were also sampled.   <br> \n <br> \nRough fish species are present.   Common carp abundance increased since the 2003 survey.  The 2009 survey recorded the highest measure of abundance ever for common carp in Lake Virginia.  This is due in part to spawning occurring during the survey.  Fish could be seen splashing around the entire perimeter of Lake Virginia.  Black bullhead numbers declined to below average abundance.  Yellow bullhead were sampled at an average abundance.   <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Virginia is a productive 110-acre lake in Carver County.  It feeds into Smithtown Bay of Lake Minnetonka via a culvert underneath Smithtown road.  Virginia offers a popular multi-species fishery with shore-fishing locations and in-lake vegetation lines, points and flats to fish.Northern pike and walleye are the primary management species in Lake Virginia.  Northern pike are Virginia's most abundant predator species sampled in survey nets.  Pike are slightly less abundant with a similar size structure compared to the 1997 sample.  The catch of 12.2 per gillnet is well above 75th percentile levels for lakes of this type.  Average length and weight is 21.8 inches and 2.5 pounds.  Just over 1 in 10 is longer than 28 inches (about 5.2 pounds).  The largest individual was 31.7 inches and 7.7 pounds.  Growth rates have slowed to below average for pike in this lake type.Walleye are more abundant than they were in the 1997 survey although sample sizes in both surveys are small.  The catch of 1.2 per gillnet is near 25th percentile levels for this lake type.  The population is well represented by the 2001 year-class.  These fish may be residents that were stocked as fry or immigrants from Lake Minnetonka from which fish can freely migrate.  Average length and weight is 15.7 inches and 1.8 pounds.  One out of 2 walleye are larger than 15 inches but none were larger than 20.  The largest individual was 19.7 inches and 2.6 pounds.  Growth rates are about average for walleye in this lake type.One 9.9 inch, 1 year-old muskellunge was sampled.  Interestingly, this fish was likely a product of natural reproduction as no fish of that age were stocked in Lakes Virginia or Minnetonka.Largemouth bass were sampled in average numbers for this lake type.  Mean length and weight was 12.6 inches and 1.3 pounds.  The largest individual was 18.2 inches and 3.1 pounds.  Mean age was 5.5 years.  Five young-of-the-year were caught in seine hauls indicating successful reproduction.  Anglers were observed catching bass on live bait near the access and outlet during the week of the netting survey.Bluegill abundance is lower than in the 1997 survey, at which time bluegill abundance was at historical highs (199/net).  The trapnet catch of 87.3 per net is still above the 75th percentile level for lakes of this type.  Average size has increased since 1997.  Mean length and weight is 6.0 inches and 0.15 pounds.  One out of 2 is larger than 6 inches but less than 1 out of ten is larger than 7 inches.  The largest bluegill captured was 8.0 inches.  Growth rates are below average for this lake type.  Shoreline seine hauls yielded young-of-the year bluegill.  Pumpkinseed and hybrid sunfish were also sampled near average levels.Black crappie trapnet abundance decreased slightly from 1997 while the gillnet abundance increased.  The trapnet catch of 6.3 per net is very near the 50th percentile level for lakes of this type.  The gillnet catch of 3.0 per net is just above 25th percentile levels.  The trapnet sample mean length and weight were 6.7 inches and 0.16 pounds.  Only about 1 in twenty is larger than 8 inches, however the largest individual sampled was 11.3 inches.  The population is strongly represented by 3 year-classes ages 2 to 4.  Growth rates are below average.Yellow perch abundances have risen sharply since the 1997 survey and, in fact, are at historical highs although they are small in size.  The 2002 gillnet catch of 14.2 per net is between the 50th percentile and 75th percentile levels for this lake type.  Average length is 6.0 inches with none sampled over 8 inches.  Growth rates are slightly below average.Black and yellow bullheads, bowfin and carp were also present in normal numbers.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Bluegill, Northern PIke and Black Bullhead were the fish species sampled in the highest abundance during the 1997 population assessment. Northern Pike averaged 21.4\" in length and 2.2 pounds per fish. Approximately 15 percent of the pike sampled were 25 inches long or larger, and the largest individual sampled was 32.5 inches long. Pike abundance reflected a noticeable increase since the 1992 survey. Walleye were sampled in low numbers and indicate a decrease in abundance since 1992. This kind of fluctuation in abundance can be expected due to seasonal movements of Walleye between Virginia Lake and Smithtown Bay of Lake Minnetonka. The average size for Walleyes sampled was 17.4\" in length and 1.7 pounds. Bluegill were sampled in fairly high numbers and reflect a steady increase in abundance since 1977, with current levels being record highs. The average size of sampled Bluegill was 6.3\" in length and 5.88 fish per pound. Seventy percent of Bluegill observed were 6.0 inches or longer, and 19 percent were 7.0 inches or more.Largemouth Bass were only captured in the shoreline seine sample, but the numbers observed indicate the potential for an above average Bass population. Yellow Perch were sampled in low numbers and represent a decrease in abundance since 1992. Black Crappie were also found in good numbers, but averaged only 7.4 inches in length. Black Bullhead are present at 5 times the abundance of Yellow Bullhead present in the lake. Average size for both species is 9.0 inches or larger. Log Perch and Brook Silversides were observed for the first time ever in this lake and have likely immigrated from Lake Minnetonka where they are common. Bowfin and Carp are also common in Virginia Lake with some above average size individuals present.</p>",
