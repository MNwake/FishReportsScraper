                "narrative": "<p>Summit is a 77 acre lake located in Murray County near the town of Hadley.  The lake is presently managed for northern pike and yellow perch as the primary species while largemouth bass, bluegill, and walleye are managed secondarily.  Surveys in 1993 and 1996 indicated adequate largemouth bass and bluegill habitat.  Adult bluegill were stocked in 1993 followed by adult largemouth bass in 1995.       The northern pike trap net catch rate was 2.3 compared to 4.0 in 1996 and 1.2 in 1992.  The gill net catch rate in 2000 was 0.0 compared to 14.0 in 1996 and 0.0 in 1992.  Lengths of northern pike sampled in trap nets ranged from 25.4 to 32.7 inches and averaged 27.7 inches.  Three, four, and five year old northern pike were sampled during the assessment.  Northern pike were likely more abundant in 1996 compared to the 2000 survey.     The largemouth bass electrofishing catch rate was 6.9 fish per hour which was below the long range goal of 30.  Lengths of largemouth bass sampled electrofishing ranged from 14.7 to 15.8 inches and averaged 15.1 inches.  All largemouth bass captured in trap nets and electrofishing were from the 1997 year class.  Adults stocked in 1995 apparently produced a year class two years later.  It seems the vegetation that is present is providing enough spawning and nursery habitat to provide some year classes.     The black crappie trap net catch rate of 10.1 was similar to other lakes like Summit.  Only one black crappie had ever been sampled in any previous assessment and that was in 1987.  Length of black crappie sampled in trap nets ranged from 7.3 to 12.2 inches with a mean length of 8.2 inches.  Four year classes of black crappie were observed during the survey and were dominated by age 2 fish (92%).     The white crappie gill net catch rate of 46.0 was high compared to lakes like Summit.  Lengths of white crappie sampled in the gill net ranged from 4.6 to 5.5 inches and averaged 4.8 inches.  The adult white crappie population was very low (one sampled during the assessment), however, they appeared to produce a strong year class.     The walleye gill net CPUE of 7.0 was similar to lakes like Summit.  The walleye catch rate was 3.0 in 1996 and 4.0 in 1992.  Lengths of walleye sampled in the gill net ranged from 19.1 to 22.3 inches and averaged 20.0 inches.  The two year classes observed during the survey coincide with fingerling stockings in 1994 and 1997.     The yellow perch gill net catch rate of 101.0 was high compared to lakes like Summit.  The yellow perch gill net catch rate was 0.0 in 1996 and 1.5 in 1992.  Lengths of yellow perch sampled in the gill net ranged from 5.5 to 11.6 inches and averaged 8.1 inches.      The black bullhead trap net catch rate of 174.2 was high compared to lakes like Summit.  The black bullhead trap net catch rate was 594.2 in 1996 and 262.3 in 1992.  Lengths of black bullhead sampled in trap nets ranged from 7.0 to 11.3 inches and averaged 8.1 inches.      The bluegill trap net catch rate of 0.1 was low compared to lakes like Summit.  Since the initial bluegill stocking in 1993, only one bluegill has been observed in trap nets.  A reclamation may be necessary to provide a self-sustaining bluegill and largemouth bass fishery.  Agricultural pollution has been reduced substantially due to changes in riparian use.  Cattle have been removed and horses now use the property surrounding the lake.  Using a reclamation to remove black bullhead from the lake should encourage submerged vegetation growth which will provide adequate largemouth bass and bluegill habitat.     Shoreline seining results indicated natural reproduction of black bullhead, bluegill, crappie, largemouth bass, and yellow perch in Summit Lake.     To promote and maintain a healthy fish population, pollution and other inputs need to be controlled.  Fish habitat is directly affected by water quality.  Nutrient, sediment and other waste inputs can drastically alter the chemical and physical components of a lake.  It is paramount to maintain if not improve the current water quality of Summit Lake through watershed management to preserve this fishery for future generations to enjoy.   </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Summit Lake is a 77-acre lake located in Murray County near Hadley.  Despite being shallow (max depth of 7.0 ft.), Summit Lake is not aerated and typically does not experience low winter oxygen levels.  Summit Lake has relatively clear water and has abundant aquatic vegetation throughout the lake.  Summit Lake is managed primarily for Walleye and secondarily for Northern Pike and Yellow Perch.  A survey was conducted the week of June 6, 2016, to monitor fish populations using one gill net and nine trap nets.   <br> \n <br> \nIn 2016, Walleye were captured at a rate of 7.0 per gill net, which is within the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (2.3 to 17.8 per gill net), is slightly above the long term average of 6.2 per gill net since 1987, and is the highest catch rate observed since the 2000 survey.  Lengths of gill netted Walleye ranged from 8.9 to 12.1 inches and averaged 10.7 inches, with all aged Walleye corresponding to the stocked 2014 year class (age-2).  Two Walleye, approximately 23.0 inches, were caught in the trap nets as well.  Adult Walleye that were stocked in the fall of 2016 should provide good fishing for ice fisherman and the open water season in the spring.    <br> \n <br> \nOne 26.9 inch Northern Pike was captured in the survey. Prior to 2016, Northern Pike fingerlings were last stocked in 2010, because fingerling production has been limited.  Catch rates should improve as Northern Pike fingerlings were stocked in 2016.  <br> \n <br> \nThe Yellow Perch catch rates were 46.0 per gill net and 52.8 per trap net, which are both high catch rates when compared to similar lakes.  Lengths of Yellow Perch ranged from 4.8 to 10.3 inches and averaged 6.5 inches.  Perch angling should be good, but sorting may have to be done to get some keepers.  <br> \n <br> \nThe 2016 Black Bullhead catch rate was 76.0 per trap net, which is high when compared to similar lakes.  Lengths of Black Bullheads ranged from 4.7 to 10.6 inches and averaged 6.3 inches. Other species sample included Black Crappie, Orangespotted Sunfish, and White Crappie.  Common carp were not sampled during the survey which is encouraging and may indicate that very few individuals remain in the system.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>The lake management plan was revised in 1994 to manage Summit Lake for largemouth bass as the primary species and yellow perch, walleye, and bluegill as secondary species.  This decision was made based on results from the 1992 population assessment.  Habitat appeared to be conducive for a self-sustaining bluegill and largemouth bass population.  Bluegill broodstock were stocked in 1993 to establish a bluegill population, followed by a largemouth bass broodfish stocking in 1995.  The entire shoreline was electrofished in the spring as part of the lake survey and no largemouth bass were sampled.  Shoreline seining data in 1996 indicated natural reproduction of largemouth bass.  Although bluegill were not sampled during the survey in 1996, shoreline seining data indicated natural reproduction of bluegill.Walleye numbers are average compared to lakes similar to Summit.  Walleye lengths ranged from 14.5 to 18 inches and averaged about 16 inches.  The average weight of walleye was almost 2 lbs.  The walleye population in Summit may have come from a 1994 fingerling stocking.Northern pike numbers are high compared to lakes similar to Summit.  Northern pike catches increased from 0 fish/net in 1992 to 14 fish/net in 1996.  Northern pike lengths ranged from 20 to 20.5 inches and averaged about 22 inches.  The average weight of northern pike was about 2.5 lbs. Black bullhead numbers are very high compared to lakes similar to Summit.  Black bullhead captured in trapnets were on the small side with an average length of about 5 inches.  The average weight of black bullhead was less than 1/10 of a lb.  During the survey many black bullhead were observed dead or dying which may have been from a disease called columnaris.  Columnaris is a bacterial infection which sometimes occurs in black bullhead and crappie populations.  Stress from things like high water temperatures or spawning on over abundant populations causes columaris outbreaks.To promote and maintain a healthy fish population, pollution and other inputs need to be controlled.  Fish habitat is directly affected by water quality.  Nutrient, sediment and other waste inputs can drastically alter the chemical and physical components of a Lake.  It is paramount to improve the current water quality of Summit Lake through watershed management to preserve this fishery for future generations to enjoy.  Cooperation between the Windom Area Fisheries Staff, local residents, and area sportsmans clubs is needed to develop a plan to keep cattle out of Summit Lake.  All parameters including water quality, fish populations, and all physical characteristics of the lake should improve with the clean up of the immediate watershed.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Summit is a 77-acre lake located at the edge of the City of Hadley in Murray County.  Summit is a class 40 lake with a maximum depth of 7.0 feet.  The lake is managed for largemouth bass primarily while walleye and bluegill are managed secondarily.  Adult bluegill and largemouth bass were stocked in 2005 to try and establish a bluegill and largemouth bass fishery.  Walleye fingerlings are stocked every other year.  As part of a resurvey conducted in 2008, 12 different species of vegetation were found in the lake.  The lake was remarkably clear and the secchi disk could be seen on the bottom of the lake. <br> \n <br> \nIt appears that the adult  largemouth bass stocking did not work because no  largemouth bass were sampled during the survey in gill nets, trap nets, or electrofishing.  Largemouth bass were observed in 2000.  No bluegill were observed in our gill or trap nets during the summer but 500 to 1,000 five inch bluegill were observed electrofishing in the fall. <br> \n <br> \nThere are some very nice sized walleye in Summit.  Walleye lengths ranged from 14 to 25 inches and averaged about 20 inches.  The lake was electrofished in the fall to determine if the 2005 largemouth bass stocking had produced any offspring.  Much to our surprise, we caught 56 young of the year walleye per hour which is considered very good.  The lake was not stocked with walleye in 2008 so all the fish caught electrofishing were from natural reproduction. <br> \n <br> \nThere are some northern pike in the lake also.  There does not appear to be high numbers of pike but the fish sampled were nice.  Lengths ranged from 22 to 27 inches and averaged around 25 inches. <br> \n  <br> \nThe number of black bullheads in Summit is similar to numbers in other lakes like Summit.  Black bullhead lengths ranged from 4 to 11 inches and averaged just over 7 inches. <br> \n  <br> \nOne common carp and two yellow perch were sampled in the survey.  This is the first time common carp have been sampled.  Another common carp was observed in the stomach of a northern pike. <br> \n <br> \nTo maintain a healthy fishery in Summit Lake, we need to promote Best Management Practices (BMP\u0019s) within the watershed to help reduce nutrients entering the lake.  High nutrients and sediments in a lake can cause algae blooms and reduce water clarity. <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Summit Lake is 77-acre, class 40 lake located in Murray County near Hadley.  Despite being shallow (max depth of 7.0 ft.), Summit Lake is not aerated and typically does not experience low winter oxygen levels; however, during the winter of 2022 and 2023, anglers reported seeing dead fish in the holes and dead fish when the ice came off in the spring.  Dissolved oxygen levels were below 0.5 parts per million by early February of 2023, below the threshold at which fish begin to be stressed (2.0 ppm).  Summit Lake has relatively clear water (5.5 ft. secchi depth) and has abundant aquatic vegetation throughout the lake.  Summit Lake is managed primarily for Walleye and secondarily for Northern Pike and Yellow Perch.  A winterkill check was conducted on May 17, 2023 using boat electrofishing to determine the extent of the kill that occurred.  <br> \n <br> \nThree species of fish were caught during the 2023 survey including Black Bullhead (24.3 per hour), Northern Pike (52.0 per hour), and Yellow Perch (3.9 per hour).  These species tend to be tolerant of low dissolved oxygen, so it was not a surprise to catch them; however, abundance Yellow Perch and Black Bullhead was lower than expected.  Species of fish that were sampled in the 2016 survey but were not sampled in the 2023 winterkill check included Black Crappie, Orangespotted Sunfish, Walleye, and White Crappie, suggesting that Summit Lake likely had a partial winterkill that reduced abundance of several species of fish.  Lengths of Northern Pike sampled in 2023 ranged from 15.2 to 28.2 and averaged 20.0 inches.  Pre-spawn adult Yellow Perch were stocked in Summit Lake in the spring of 2023 to reestablish the population.  <br> \n</p>",

BOTH GILLNET AND TRAPNET CATCH RATES WERE WITHIN THE NORMAL RANGE FOR LAKE CLASS 43.  PROPORTIONAL STOCK DENSITY AND RSD-P INCREASED FROM 97 AND 22 (GILLNETS AND TRAPNETS COMBINED) TO 100 AND 83 SINCE 1988.  HOWEVER, SAMPLE SIZE FOR WAE WAS LOW IN 1992 (TABLE 1).  LOW SAMPLE SIZE AND POOR ANNULUS DISTINCTION INHIBITED THE QUALITY OF AGE AND GROWTH ANALYSIS.  NO WAE WERE STOCKED IN 1992 AND NO YOY WAE WERE FOUND IN SHORELINE SEINING. IF SUMMIT LAKE IS A SOCIALLY OR REGIONALLY IMPORTANT FISHERY, WAE MAY NEED TO BE STOCKED. WAE FRY STOCKINGS HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN THE PAST (1988 SURVEY).  HOWEVER, WITH THE ABUNDANCE OF VEGETATION, LMB MAY BE MORE SUITABLE.  PREDATOR STOCKINGS FOR SUMMIT LAKE SHOULD BE BASED ON POTENTIAL FOR SELF-SUSTAINING POPULATIONS, BLB CONTROL POTENTIAL, AND EXPENSE.  LMB MAY ATTAIN A SELF-SUSTAINING POPULATION WHERE WAE HAVE NOT. LMB HAVE ALSO BEEN DOCUMENTED EFFECTIVELY CONTROLLING BLB.  HOWEVER, IN THE SHORE-TERM, WAE ARE EASIER (AND LESS EXPENSIVE) TO OBTAIN WITHOUT NEGATIVELY EFFECTING THE BROOD POPULATION.  IF A SELF-SUSTAINING LMB POPULATION COULD BE ESTABLISHED, IT WOULD BE LESS EXPENSIVE IN THE LONG-TERM .  YEP GILLNET AND TRAPNET CATCH RATES HAVE DECREASED SINCE 1988, FALLING BELOW THE NORMAL RANGE FOR LAKE CLASS 43.  YEP LENGTH RANGES CHANGED FROM 4.5-13.0 INCHES (N=27) IN 1988 TO 6.5-7.0 INCHES (N=3) IN 1992.  CONSISTENT YEP NATURAL REPRODUCTION IS INDICATED BY PAST SHORELINE SEINING DATA.  TWENTY-FIVE YOY YEP WERE COLLECTED IN THREE SHORELINE SEINE HAULS DURING 1992.  YEP HAVE NOT BEEN STOCKED SINCE 1985. PRESENTLY, YEP APPEAR TO BE GOING THROUGH A BOOM (1988 SURVEY) AND BUST FLUCTUATION THAT IS NORMAL FOR THESE SHALLOW, TURBID WATERS.  YEP APPEAR TO BE RESILIENT AND PROLIFIC (ESPECIALLY IN SMALL BODIES OF WATER) AND STOCKING SHOULD NOT BE NECESSARY.  SINCE 1988, NOP GILLNET CATCH RATES HAVE DECREASED TO ZERO BUT TRAPNET CATCH RATES INCREASED FROM 0.7 TO 1.2.  NOP CATCH RATES FOR TRAPNETS ARE WITHIN THE NORMAL RANGE FOR LAKE CLASS 43.  NOP RANGED IN LENGTH FROM 18.0 TO 31.0 INCHES IN 1988 (N=10) AND 1992 (N=7).  NOP HAVE NOT BEEN STOCKED SINCE 1985 SO SOME NATURAL RECRUITMENT MUST BE PRESENT.  BLB GILLNET CATCH RATES INCREASED FROM 15.0 TO 95.5 SINCE 1988, WHILE TRAPNET CATCH RATES INCREASED FROM 116.4 TO 262.3.  GILLNET CATCH RATES WERE WITHIN THE NORMAL RANGE WHILE TRAPNET CATCH RATES WERE 2.5 TIMES THE UPPER END OF THE NORMAL RANGE.

                "narrative": "<p>Summit Lake is located in Murray County near the town of Hadley, has surface area of 77 acres, and a maximum depth of 7 feet. Summit is primarily managed for largemouth bass with walleye and bluegill as secondary species. Surveys in 1993 and 1996 indicated adequate largemouth and bluegill habitat. Bluegill were stocked in 1993 and largemouth bass in 1995 and 2000. After the 2000 assessment the management plan was changed from northern pike and yellow perch to largemouth bass. Unfortunately, during the winter of 2000/2001 Summit suffered a partial winterkill which severely reduced the largemouth bass numbers. Largemouth bass and bluegill were stocked again in 2002 and 2003. Consideration should be given to finding a sponsor to operate a winter aeration system. Shoreline development has begun on Summit Lake and plans are in the works for a housing development on a adjacent wetland. A population assessment was conducted during the week of May 24, 2004 with two gill nets and nine trap nets.Largemouth bass are usually net shy and are typically sampled by night electrofishing. Sampling in 2004 did not catch a single bass. Numerous nice bass were found dead along the shoreline of Summit Lake in the spring of 2001 after a partial winterkill. Prior to the winterkill, largemouth bass had some success. Largemouth bass adults or yearlings will be stocked in 2005 . If very few bass are sampled during the next assessment in 2008, a serious look at discontinuing  largemouth bass management will be considered.The bluegill catch rate of 0.44 was low compared to lakes similar to Summit. 525 adult bluegill were stocked in 2002 and 385 in 2003. If bluegill catch rates do not increase after the next assessment, bluegill management may be discontinued.The black crappie catch rate of .7 is below average and considerably less than the 10.0 recorded in 2000. Lengths of black crappie ranged from 8.5 to 11.5 inches with an average of 9.5 inches. It appears the black crappie population was affected by the partial winterkill and are not competing well with the white crappie population. The population may be low but most black crappie you catch should be \"keepers\".The white crappie catch rate was average for lakes like Summit but the size is not. The average white crappie sampled in the trap nets was 10.5 inches long and weighed nearly 3/4 of a pound. Three year classes of white crappie were sampled. The white crappie seems to be the dominant panfish in Summit Lake.The yellow perch catch rate of 5.0 per net was average. This is down from the pre-winterkill catch rate of 101.0 in 2000. Most of the perch sampled are age 3 and average six inches long. Perch numbers tend to cycle in lakes of our region and Summit could still be recovering from the winterkill.The walleye gill net catch rate was 4.5 which is average for lakes like Summit. Lengths of walleye sampled in the gill net ranged from 10.2 to 24.8 inches and averaged 16.3 inches. Four year classes were sampled during the assessment. Fingerlings and yearlings were stocked in 2000 and 2003. Summit Lake has a nice population of good sized walleye. The spring and fall shoreline angler may be surprised at what is available.The northern pike trap net catch rate was 1.2 compared to 2.3 in 2000, and 4.0 in 1996. Northern pike have been sampled in every assessment since 1987. Lengths of northern pike ranged from 19 to 25 inches and averaged 22.5 inches. Most of the northern pike sampled were three years old. Good growth and a strong year class should provide good pike fishing in the near future.The black bullhead catch rate of 25 per trap net was the lowest ever recorded for Summit Lake. The black bullhead catch rate was 174 in 2000 and 594 in 1996. The average bullhead was nine inches long.White sucker and common carp were also sampled during the assessment.To promote and maintain a healthy fish population, pollution and other inputs need to be controlled. Fish habitat is directly affected by water quality. Nutrient, sediment and other waste inputs can drastically alter the chemical and physical components of a lake. It is important to maintain if not improve the current water quality of Summit Lake through watershed management to preserve this fishery for future generations to enjoy.

                "narrative": "<p>INTRODUCTION <br> \n <br> \nSummit Lake is a small and relatively disconnected lake located in Murray County just outside the town of Hadley.  Summit Lake has a watershed-to-lake ratio of only 7.7 to 1, which means there is only 7.7 acres of upland area that drains to the lake for every 1 acre of surface water.  It is one of only a few lakes in the Windom Fish Management Area that does not have an aeration system.  In spite of the fact that the lake is not aerated during winter, low dissolved oxygen is not a problem other than in winters with excessive snow.  This 77-acre lake is managed primarily for walleye and secondarily for northern pike and yellow perch.  Summit Lake was surveyed the first week of June of 2012 with 1 gill net and 9 trap nets. <br> \n <br> \nWALLEYE <br> \n <br> \nTypically the DNR uses gill net catch rates as the indication to the abundance of walleyes in a lake.  However, Summit Lake is a good example as to why all types of nets need to be used to evaluate the status of the fish population.  No walleyes were sampled in the one gill net.  However the trap nets sampled the most walleye ever recorded in trap nets on Summit Lake.  Although the population is dominated by smaller fish, they appear to be abundant.  It would seem the 2011 walleye fingerling stocking was successful.  The average length of the walleye in the sample was only 7 inches.  Although the fish are small, the abundant forage base available indicates that these walleyes may be primed for some good growth.  In the interim, target the abundant yellow perch population. <br> \n <br> \nYELLOW PERCH <br> \n <br> \nIn addition to providing a great forage base for walleye, the yellow perch fishery will likely provide some excellent fishing in the next few years.  The 2012 survey documented the highest catch rate of yellow perch in both trap and gill nets.  Both of these nets indicated catch rates more than 10 times the upper normal range.  The average length yellow perch was 7 inches.  If you are looking to take the kids fishing from shore, Summit Lake would be worth considering.   <br> \n <br> \nNORTHERN PIKE <br> \n <br> \nThere is always a chance while fishing for yellow perch that an angler could catch a northern pike.  Given the size of the lake, the northern pike numbers are very respectable.  Historically we have had only 1 other survey when northern pike numbers have been higher.  There are currently a couple of age groups of northern pike in the lake.  It appears that the 2010 northern pike fingerling stocking was successful and many fish survived.  With the abundant yellow perch population as prey, it is likely the northern pike will grow fast.  Lengths of northern pike ranged from 25 to 38 inches.  Selective harvest by practicing catch-and-release of larger northern pike will help to sustain the population by allowing the larger fish (usually females) to spawn. <br> \n  <br> \nOTHER SPECIES <br> \n <br> \nHistorically, black bullhead numbers have been much higher.  It would appear that the walleye stockings in the past may be controlling black bullhead numbers.  While the black bullhead fishing from shore will provide some angling activity for the kids, the sizes of bullheads are probably not going to be worth keeping at this point.   <br> \n <br> \nUnfortunately, we first sampled common carp in Summit Lake in the 2008 survey.  In the 2012 survey, we sampled 11 more common carp in the gill net and trap nets.  Based on the length frequency histogram, it would appear there are 2 year classes.  All but two of the fish sampled had total lengths ranging from 23-27 inches.  The two sampled in trap nets had total lengths in the 11.5-13.0 inch range.  It is unknown if these smaller fish are offspring from successful Summit Lake spawning or immigrants.   <br> \nOther species sampled were hybrid sunfish and white crappie. <br> \n <br> \nSUMMARY <br> \n <br> \nTo maintain a healthy fishery in Summit Lake; we need to promote Best Management Practices (BMP's) within the watershed to help reduce nutrients entering the lake.  High nutrients and sediments in a lake can cause algae blooms and reduce water clarity.  Any improvements in the way of natural drainage in the watershed (non-tiled drainage to mimic natural wetland drainage) will help the fish community through increased water quality and water clarity. <br> \n <br> \nPrepared by Ryan Doorenbos <br> \n</p>",
