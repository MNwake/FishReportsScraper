Growth rates for brook trout collected in 2002 were slow, and their average size was small.  Slow growth and the small average size were probably the result of increased competition for forage.  Catches of white sucker and pumpkinseed sunfish were the highest seen in this lake since it was reclaimed, and yellow perch were collected in the lake for the first time since the reclamation.  The presence of three major competitors will make it much less likely that this lake can support a high-quality brook trout population.</p>",

This assessment was done to confirm that report. <br> \n <br> \nLizz Lake was reclaimed for stream trout management in 1985, using a fish toxicant to remove its original fish community (walleye, northern pike, white sucker, and yellow perch).  The lake was last assessed in 2002.  At that time, brook trout, pumpkinseed sunfish, white sucker, and yellow perch were the only species collected.  <br> \n <br> \nIn 2013, several northern pike were collected in two gill net sets, confirming the guide's report of their presence in Lizz Lake.  Three year classes contributed to the catch, so some natural reproduction had probably occurred since the species became established.  Northern pike probably entered the lake from Caribou Lake, which was also the probable source for other warmwater species found in this lake since it was reclaimed. <br> \n <br> \nOne brook trout, a large three-year-old fish from the 2010 fingerling stocking, was collected in 2013.  Brook trout from stockings done in 2011 and 2012 should have been present and vulnerable to the sampling gear used in this assessment, but none were taken.  It is very likely that predation from northern pike resulted in little or no survival of those stockings.  High (total) losses of stocked trout to predation have been observed in other area stream trout lakes where northern pike have become established. <br> \n <br> \nShort of another reclamation, we have no means of removing or controlling northern pike in this lake.  Since Lizz Lake is partially inside the BWCAW, concerns about the effect of chemical rehabilitation on wilderness values would likely make it very difficult to get approval for such an action.  In addition, some sort of barrier on the stream between Lizz and Caribou Lakes would be needed to prevent a swift reintroduction of northern pike or other undesirable species.  Construction and maintenance of an effective barrier would also be difficult in a wilderness setting. <br> \n <br> \nBecause northern pike cannot be removed, and will cause unacceptably high losses among stocked trout, no further stocking of this lake is recommended.  The management plan for Lizz Lake will be revised in the winter of 2015, and fish currently in production for this lake will be diverted to other waters.  It is likely that over the years Lizz Lake will support a reasonable northern pike fishery, and that walleye will also eventually become established, as they in turn move into the lake from Caribou Lake. <br> \n </p>",
