                "narrative": "<p>     Silver Lake is a 547-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located in central Otter Tail County one mile north of Battle Lake, MN.  The immediate watershed is composed primarily of grasslands interspersed with hardwood woodlots.  The maximum depth is 43 feet; however, 42% of the lake is 15 feet or less in depth.  The secchi disk reading during the 2006 lake survey was 10.8 feet.  The MN DNR has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different lake classes based on physical and chemical characteristics.  Silver Lake is included in lake class 31; other area lakes in this same classification include Pleasant, Portage, Pebble, Molly Stark, and Eagle. <br> \n     The majority of the shoreline is developed with homes and cottages.  A state owned public access is located along the north shoreline.  Shoal water substrates consist primarily of sand and gravel.  Several small stands of hardstem bulrush exist in the lake.  Emergent aquatic plants such as bulrush provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat, and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms, and can actually absorb and break down polluting chemicals.  Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish species such as largemouth bass, black crappie, and panfish.  They also serve as important nursery areas for all species of fish.  To maintain the excellent water quality and angling that this lake has to offer, it is imperative to preserve the quality of the aquatic habitat.   <br> \n     Silver Lake can be ecologically classified as a walleye-centrarchid type of lake and this is reflected in the assemblage of the fish community.  Walleye, largemouth bass, black crappie, and bluegill are the dominant gamefish species. <br> \n     Walleye is a primary management species in Silver Lake.  The walleye test-net catch rate exceeded the upper limit of the expected range for similar lakes and was the highest recorded for this lake.  Walleye ranged in length from 6.9 to 25.1 inches with an average length and weight of 14.6 inches and 1.3 pounds.  Age data from recent test-netting assessments indicate that walleye natural reproduction is very limited.  Catch data indicate that walleye fingerling stocking on a two out of three year rotation can maintain walleye abundance at or above management goals. <br> \n     Data from a spring electrofishing assessment indicate that a high-density largemouth bass population exists.  Bass ranged in length from 3.6 to 17.0 inches in length with an average length and weight of 14.3 inches and 1.7 pounds.   <br> \n     The black crappie test-net catch rate exceeded the expected range for similar lakes.  Length data indicated that multiple year classes were sampled.  Twenty-six percent of the black crappie sample was 10.0 inches or greater in length. <br> \n     The bluegill test-net catch rate was within the expected range for similar lakes.  Fifty-three percent of the bluegill sample was 7.0 inches or greater in length. <br> \n     Anglers can maintain the quality of fishing in Silver Lake by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large size fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future.    </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>     Silver Lake is a 547-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located in central Otter Tail County one mile north of Battle Lake, MN.  The immediate watershed is composed primarily of grasslands interspersed with hardwood woodlots.  The maximum depth is 43 feet; however, 42% of the lake is 15 feet or less in depth.  The secchi disk reading during the 2016 lake survey was 8.5 feet.  Previous secchi disk readings ranged from 6.0 to 12.2 feet. <br> \n     The majority of the shoreline is developed with homes and cottages.  A state owned public access is located along the north shoreline.  Shoal water substrates consist primarily of sand and gravel.  Several small stands of hardstem bulrush exist along the eastern portion of the lake.  Emergent aquatic plants such as bulrush provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms, and can actually absorb and break down polluting chemicals.  Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish species such as Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, and panfish.  They also serve as important nursery areas for all species of fish.  To maintain the excellent water quality and angling that this lake has to offer, it is imperative to preserve the quality of the aquatic habitat.   <br> \n     Silver Lake can be ecologically classified as a Walleye-centrarchid type of lake and this is reflected in the assemblage of the fish community.  Walleye, Bluegill, and Black Crappie are the dominant gamefish species. <br> \n     Walleye is a primary management specie in Silver Lake.  Walleye abundance has consistently remained at a high level.  The 2013 and 2014 year classes appear to be strong and should provide consistently good angling for several years.  Walleyes ranged in length from 9.5 to 22.4 inches with an average length and weight of 13.9 inches and 1.1 pounds.  Walleyes attain an average length of 15.5 inches at four years of age.   <br> \n     Northern Pike abundance has historically been low due to a lack of suitable spawning habitat.  Pike ranged in length from 20.2 to 28.0 inches with an average length and weight of 24.3 inches and 3.0 pounds.  Northern Pike attain an average length of 23.4 inches at four years of age. <br> \n     Bluegill abundance and size structure has historically fluctuated.  In this survey, Bluegills were very abundant.  Thirteen percent of the Bluegills were 7.0 inches or greater in length.  Bluegills attain an average length of 7.1 inches at six years of age.  <br> \n     Black Crappies are also abundant.  The 2011 year class is strong.  Seventy-six percent of the Black Crappies were 10.0 inches or greater in length.  Crappies attain an average length of 10.1 inches at five years of age.     <br> \n     Anglers can maintain the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large size fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future.     <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>     Silver Lake is a 547-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located in central Otter Tail County one mile north of Battle Lake, MN.  The immediate watershed is composed primarily of grasslands interspersed with hardwood woodlots.  The maximum depth is 43 feet; however, 42% of the lake is 15 feet or less in depth.  The secchi disk reading during the 2022 lake survey was 13.1 feet.  Previous secchi disk readings ranged from 6.0 to 12.2 feet. <br> \n     The majority of the shoreline is developed with homes and cottages.  A DNR owned concrete public access is located along the north shoreline.  Shoal water substrates consist primarily of sand and gravel.  Several small stands of hardstem bulrush exist along the western and eastern portions of the lake.  Emergent aquatic plants such as bulrush provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms, and can actually absorb and break down polluting chemicals.  Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish species such as Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, and panfish.  They also serve as important nursery areas for all species of fish.  To maintain the excellent water quality and angling that this lake has to offer, it is imperative to preserve the quality of the aquatic habitat.   <br> \n     A special gillnetting survey was conducted to analyze the Walleye and Northern Pike populations.  <br> \n     Walleye abundance has historically remained at a high level.  The 2018 and 2019 year classes of Walleye are strong and should provide consistently good angling for several years.  Walleyes ranged in length from 10.9 to 23.1 inches with an average length and weight of 15.8 inches and 1.5 pounds.  Walleyes attain an average length of 15.0 inches at four years of age.   <br> \n     Northern Pike abundance has historically been low due to a lack of suitable spawning habitat; however, Northern Pike size structure has consistently been of a high quality.  Northern Pike ranged in length from 22.1 to 30.8 inches with an average length and weight of 24.0 inches and 4.0 pounds.  Northern Pike exhibit fast growth with an average length of 24.0 inches at four years of age. <br> \n     Anglers can maintain the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large size fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future.     <br> \n     Silver Lake is not listed as an infested water.  Aquatic invasive species are threatening Minnesota waters.  The non-native species can potentially harm water quality, water recreation, aquatic habitat, native species, and fish populations.  Anglers can help prevent the introduction and spread of invasive species by following watercraft transportation laws.     <br> \n</p>",

Fourteen 100-foot sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake shore, sampling a variety of habitat types.  Each site is sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot 1/8th-inch mesh seine, depending on habitat conditions.  Sites where habitat conditions did not allow for seining were backpack electrofished unless conditions proved difficult for walking. These sites were backpack shocked from the boat. Fourteen fish species were represented, including young of the year gamefish species such as Bluegill and Largemouth Bass. Non-game species sampled included Logperch, Johnny Darter, and Mimic Shiner.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Silver Lake is located in central Otter Tail County just north of Battle Lake, MN.  Silver Lake is a 547-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake that is within the Otter Tail River watershed.  The immediate watershed is composed primarily of homes/cabins except for the eastern shoreline of the lake, which consists of mixed hardwood and wetland cover.  The maximum depth of Silver Lake is 43 feet; however, 42% of the lake is less than 15 feet in depth.  The secchi disk reading during the 2001 lake survey was 12.2 feet, which indicates excellent water clarity.  Periodic plankton/algae blooms throughout the summer months can influence secchi disk readings.  Silver Lake is included in lake class 31 of the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources' lake classification scheme.  Silver Lake is located within the DNR's Fergus Falls Management Area.     Silver Lake is ecologically classified and managed as a walleye-centrarchid type of lake.  The majority of the shoreline of Silver Lake is developed.  The 1996 resurvey identified 99 homes/cottages on the lake.  A state owned public access is located off of a township road along the north shoreline of the lake.  The shoal water substrates consist of sand, gravel, and rubble.  A couple of hardstem bulrush beds remain in the lake and represent very critical spawning habitat.  They are located along the east shore and off the point in the southwest portion of the lake.  Emergent aquatic plants such as bulrush and cattails provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat, and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms, and can actually absorb and break down polluting chemicals.  They also serve as important nursery areas for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit.  To maintain the excellent water quality and angling within this lake it is imperative to preserve the quality of the aquatic habitat.  Northern pike abundance increased slightly since the 1996 survey, but remains below the expected range for class 31 lakes.  Northern pike abundance is likely limited by the lack of suitable spawning habitat.  Pike ranged in length from 19.9 to 33.9 inches with a mean length and weight of 25.6 inches and 4.0 pounds. Pike attain a mean length of 25.7 inches at five years of age.  Growth rate estimates exceed average northern pike growth rates for class 31 lakes in the Fergus Falls Management Area.     Rock bass abundance significantly increased since the last survey in 1996 and the catch rate was the highest recorded on Silver Lake.  The catch rate has been steadily increasing since 1987 when the abundance was low.  Length distribution data indicate that rock bass natural reproduction is occurring annually.       The bluegill test-net catch rate was higher than the previous lake surveys and within the normal range for class 31 lakes.  Data indicate bluegill reproduction to be variable in Silver Lake.  Forty-two percent of the bluegills in the trap net sample were 7.0 inches or greater in length.  The mean length of bluegills in the trap net sample was 6.3 inches.  Bluegill growth rates are excellent as they attain a mean length of 8.2 inches at seven years of age.     Walleye abundance substantially increased since the 1996 survey and was the highest catch rate ever recorded on Silver Lake.  Age data from recent population assessments indicate that walleye natural reproduction is very limited since most skip years in the stocking sequence have resulted in weak or missing year classes.  This suggests that fingerling stocking has successfully increased walleye abundance by supplementing limited natural reproduction.  The 1996 year class appears to be especially strong.  The average length and weight of walleye was 17.2 inches and 2.0 pounds.  Walleye reach an average length of 14.1 inches at three years of age, which exceeds mean walleye growth rates for class 31 lakes in the Fergus Falls Management Area.         Anglers can maintain the quality of fishing in Silver Lake by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large-size fish while allowing the harvest of the more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>     Silver Lake is a 547-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located in central Otter Tail County one mile north of Battle Lake, MN.  The immediate watershed is composed primarily of grasslands interspersed with hardwood woodlots.  The maximum depth is 43 feet; however, 42% of the lake is 15 feet or less in depth.  The secchi disk reading during the 2011 lake survey was 10.0 feet.  Previous secchi disk readings ranged from 6.0 to 12.2 feet. <br> \n     The majority of the shoreline is developed with homes and cottages.  A state owned public access is located along the north shoreline.  Shoal water substrates consist primarily of sand and gravel.  Several small stands of hardstem bulrush exist in the lake.  Emergent aquatic plants such as bulrush provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat, and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms, and can actually absorb and break down polluting chemicals.  Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish species such as northern pike, largemouth bass, and panfish.  They also serve as important nursery areas for all species of fish.  To maintain the excellent water quality and angling that this lake has to offer, it is imperative to preserve the quality of the aquatic habitat.   <br> \n     Silver Lake can be ecologically classified as a walleye-centrarchid type of lake and this is reflected in the assemblage of the fish community.  Walleye, northern pike, largemouth bass, and bluegill are the dominant gamefish species. <br> \n     Walleye is a primary management specie in Silver Lake.  Walleye abundance has consistently remained at a high level.  The 2008 and 2009 year classes appear to be strong and should provide consistently good angling for several years.  Walleyes ranged in length from 9.7 to 26.0 inches with an average length and weight of 14.2 inches and 1.1 pounds.  Walleyes attain an average length of 15.0 inches at four years of age.   <br> \n     Northern pike abundance has increased in recent surveys due to high water levels, which has increased accessibility to suitable spawning habitat.  Pike ranged in length from 18.9 to 36.9 inches with an average length and weight of 22.8 inches and 2.8 pounds.  Northern pike attain an average length of 22.4 inches at three years of age. <br> \n     Largemouth bass are also abundant.  Age data indicate that bass reproduction is consistently good.  Bass ranged in length from 8.9 to 17.0 inches with an average length and weight of 12.6 inches and 1.3 pounds.  Largemouth bass attain an average length of 13.6 inches at five years of age. <br> \n     Bluegill abundance and size structure has consistently fluctuated.  In this survey, only four percent of the bluegills were 7.0 inches or greater in length.  Bluegills attain an average length of 6.4 inches at five years of age.  <br> \n     Anglers can maintain the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large size fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future.     <br> \n</p>",

The length-frequency distribution indicates that neither the 1985-86 or 1989-90 stockings of pike appear to have contributed to the population.   <br> \n     Rock bass abundance increased from 0.3 per gill net lift in the 1987 survey to 6.1 per net, which is over two times greater than the upper limit of the normal range.   <br> \n     Bluegill abundance declined substantially from 114.5 per trap net lift in 1987 to 67.0 per net, but remains above the normal range.  No change in size structure was observed as few fish greater than 7.0 inches in length were sampled.  Bluegill growth rates appear to be slightly below statewide averages.  <br> \n     Black crappie abundance increased from 1.4 per trap net lift in 1987 to 3.1 per net, and remains within the normal range.  The 1986 and 1987 year classes appear to be strong as they composed 94% of the sample.  <br> \n    Yellow perch abundance increased from 18.0 per gill net lift in 1987 to 77.8 per net, which is 19 times greater than the upper limit of the normal range.  <br> \n     Walleye abundance decreased from 14.8 per gill net lift in 1987 to 8.3 per net, which still exceeds the normal range.  The 1988 year class composed 68% of the walleye sample and corresponds to a year of fingerling stocking.  Age data indicate that walleye natural reproduction may occur, but it is limited. Walleye growth rates appear to be well below statewide averages. <br> \n</p>",
