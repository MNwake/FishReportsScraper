Northern Pike, while only slightly above the statewide median in number, greatly exceed state- wide averages in weight. Tullibee numbers fell 53% from 1987, perhaps reflecting a weak year class resulting from the partial summer kill of adults in 1986 and 1988. White Sucker, Yellow Perch, and Sauger are slightly more abundant than in 1987. In 1988, Walleye numbers increased 21% from 1987 netting totals, and Walleye 16 inches or larger totaled 38% of the catch. This is above the 1987 and 1986 totals of 25% and 23% and 16.0 inches respectively. The mean from 1980-85 is 21.3 and the 1968-70 mean is 7.3% of the catch and 16.0 inches. The 1989 index netting will likely see a slight reduction in percentage of Walleye 16.0 inches, due to a strong 1987 year class and reflecting the reduced vulnerability to our sampling gear of these fish as they surpass 20 inches in total length.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>The walleye population is in very good shape with about 15 age groups represented annually.  The oldest walleye sampled in the 2001 fall gill net assessment was a 17 year-old male.  The 1991 year class walleye are no longer a major component of the gill net sample.  The majority of the 1991 year class walleye have outgrown the experimental gill net, and only about 10% of the supplementary large mesh gill net was of this strong year class.  The 1991 walleye year class remains the strongest measured on Lake of the Woods.  Since the weak year classes of 1992 and 1993, no weak year classes have been measured, though the 2000 year class is predicted to be very weak.  The paucity of age-1 walleye in the gill net sample supports the prediction of a weak 2000 walleye year class.  The walleye gill net CPUE was 50% higher than the 1992-2001 mean CPUE.  Over 12% of the walleye sample was of the 2001 year class.  It appears that the 2001 walleye year class will be quite strong, similar in strength to the 1991 year class.The sauger population has been characterized by highly variable recruitment.  From 1991 through 1996 three weak year classes, but no strong year classes, were produced.  The 1997 year class is the first strong year class since the 1989 and 1990 year classes.  The 1989 and 1990 year classes are virtually gone from the sauger population.  The 1993 and 1994 year-classes are of moderate strength.  Sauger from these year-classes averaged between 14 and 16 inches long (depending on sex) in fall assessment netting, but comprised only 5% of the sauger sample.  The two most abundant year classes were produced in1997 and 1999.  The 1997 year class sauger average 12-13 inches in length and comprised 28% of the gill net sample.  Nineteen ninety-nine year class sauger were just over 40% of the gill net sample and averaged about 9 inches in length.  The 1999 year class was predicted to be of moderate strength, but based on this year gill net sample, it may be strong.   Ice anglers readily accept sauger when they reach 11 inches in length.  Over 45% of the fall gill net sauger sample exceeded 11 inches long.  Sauger abundance has been increasing consistently since the low point in 1997, and overall abundance is at it's highest level in the past 10 years.Year class strength of walleye and sauger can be predicted with a fairly high degree of confidence based on information collected during YOY percid assessment, conducted during July and August.  The variable used to predict walleye year class strength is the length that YOY walleye achieve by August 15.  Length and year class strength are positively correlated.  YOY walleye abundance has not been shown to be a significant effect to year class strength.   Based on August 15 length, the 2001 walleye year class will be weak.  However, the number of YOY walleye sampled in fall gill net assessment suggests that the 2001 year class will be quite strong.  The number of YOY walleye sampled in fall gill net assessment is not a sensitive predictor of walleye year class strength, but strong year classes usually show up in this assessment series. Sauger year class strength can be predicted using YOY sauger abundance, measured through August trawling, and walleye abundance, measured through fall gill net assessment.  Young of year sauger abundance is positively correlated with year class strength, while walleye abundance has an inverse relationship with sauger year class strength.  YOY sauger abundance was moderate to low based on 2001 trawling while fall walleye gill net CPUE was high. The combination of these variables predict that the 2001 sauger year class will be weak.Northern pike are not sampled very effectively with standard lake assessment gill nets.  In the 1983 to 1994 fall gill net assessment, northern pike CPUE has ranged from 0.8 to 2.7 with a 10 year mean of 1.5.  The problem of small sample size has been addressed with a spring survey, using trap nets.  Spring spawning run trap net assessment depicts a very high quality northern pike population.  In 1995 the spawning run assessment was expanded to a tagging study, and  1,500 northern pike were tagged.  The primary purpose of this study was to determine whether northern pike using streams in Minnesota as spawning sites were exclusively Minnesota stocks, or if the stocks were shared with the provinces of Manitoba and/or Ontario.  In 1995, 15% of 1,432 tagged pike exceeded 750 mm (~30 inches).  Approximately 2% of tagged northern pike exceed 1,000 mm (~40 inches).  Preliminary tag return data suggest that the northern pike that spawn in Rainy River tributary streams spend their time in the Rainy River and are a distinct stock from the pike that spawn in Lake of the Woods tributaries.  Rainy River tributary streams, as a group, have significantly smaller mean lengths than any of the other sites at which northern pike are tagged.  Zippel Bay and the Warroad River stood out as sites from which a lot of tags were returned.  These are areas that have a relatively high proportion of targeted northern pike effort.  Based on tag returns, northern pike exploitation estimates range from 5.3-7% (depending on whether 30% or 40% of tags are reported) and survival is estimated at 66%. Data from the summer 2001 creel survey are available.  This past summer was, once again, one of excellent walleye fishing success on Lake of the Woods.  Despite that pressure was 6% lower than the five-year mean, harvest was 21% above the five year mean walleye harvest.  The excellent fishing success was likely due to the very low abundance of age-1 yellow perch.  Walleye angling success peaked from June 1-15 at 0.68 walleye per hour (0.47 harvested and 0.21 released).  Combined (harvested and released) walleye angling CPUE did not drop below 0.40 until the August 16-31 time period.  Overall summer walleye CPUE was 0.49 (0.35 harvested and 0.14 released).  The summer harvest of walleye on the Minnesota waters of Lake of the Woods was 411,425 pounds, from a pressure of 745,983 angler hours.About 29,000 pounds of sauger were harvested during the summer of 2001.  The overall non-targeted harvest rate of sauger was 0.05, with an overall non-targeted catch rate of 0.09.  There were distinct catch rate differences between user groups.  Non-guided parties had a total catch rate of about 0.07.  Launch based anglers, which fish primarily with downriggers farther off shore than the non-guided anglers, had a total catch rate of 0.16, with a harvest rate of 0.09.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>The walleye population is in very good shape with about 15 age groups represented annually.  A fish population, such as Lake of the Woods walleye, with a variety of age classes present is a healthy fish population.Fall gill net assessment sampled walleye from 149 mm (6 inches) up to 705 mm (28 inches).  Two distinct modes in the length frequency distribution correspond to age-1 (2003 year class) and age-3 (2001 year class) walleye.  The strength of these year classes has not been scored yet, but,  year class strength of walleye can be predicted with a high degree of confidence (r2=0.89) based on information collected during YOY percid assessment, conducted during July and August.  The variables used to predict walleye year class strength are the length that YOY walleye achieve by August 15 and the age-0 walleye CPUE from August trawling.  Length, trawl CPUE and year class strength are positively correlated.  The year class strength model suggests that the 2001 and 2003 walleye year classes are strong.  Conversely, the year classes produced in 2000, 2002 and 2004 are weak.Anglers should notice that there is an abundance of small walleye in the 7-9 inch range, and another abundant group of walleye in the 12-13 inch range.  The abundance of these small walleye will be particularly noticeable due to the extreme variability of year class strengths produced since 1998, with even years producing weak to very weak year classes and odd years producing very strong year classes.  Overall walleye abundance remains high at over 18 walleye per gill net lift.  The 10-year average (1994-2003) walleye abundance was 16.1 walleye per lift.Despite a windy and rainy summer in 2004, angler pressure and success remained fairly high.  Walleye harvest was however the lowest since 1996.  The total number of walleye harvested did not decline, but their small average size (the smallest in the past ten years) produced a relatively light harvest.  The very high winter (2002-2003) pressure resulted in the highest winter walleye harvest estimate to date, at 402,464 pounds.  Winter pressure increased again during the winter of 2003-04, but walleye harvest was lower at 319,698 pounds.  The five-year mean total walleye harvest (all creel surveys combined) remains well above the target harvest at 636,650 pounds.  The walleye and sauger harvest regulations that became effective on December 1, 2004, are designed to reduce walleye and sauger harvest to approximately 450,000 and 250,000 pounds, respectively.The sauger population has been characterized by highly variable recruitment, though the year class strength since 1997 has been less variable than in the previous 10 years.  From 1991 through 1996 three weak year classes, but no strong year classes, were produced.  Since 1996 sauger recruitment has been much stronger. Strong year classes were produced in 1997, 1999 and 2001, and the 1998 and 2000 year classes are of moderate strength.  The result of the improved recruitment is that sauger abundance has increased from a low of 5.4 sauger per lift, in 1997, to 20.1 sauger per lift, in 2002, but declined to 12.3 per lift in 2003, as measured in fall gill net assessment.  Sauger abundance declined again in 2004, to 9.2 sauger per gill net lift.  Based on the recent production of strong sauger year classes, the decline in sauger abundance is somewhat surprising. The very high winter sauger harvest during the winters of 2002-03 and 2003-04, more than 750,000 pounds over the two winters, can not be discounted as a possible source of the decline in sauger abundance.About 39,000 pounds of sauger were harvested during the summer of 2004.  Winter continues to be the time period where the majority of sauger are harvested.  Eighty-two percent of all sauger harvested from the Minnesota waters of Lake of the Woods are harvested through the ice fishery based on the South Shore of Lake of the Woods.  The sauger target harvest has been set at 250,000 pounds during the recent Border Waters Atlas revision.Sauger year class strength can be predicted using YOY sauger and YOY yellow perch abundance, both measured by August trawling (r2=0.86).  Young of year sauger abundance and YOY yellow perch abundance are both positively correlated with year class strength.  The 2002 sauger year class is predicted to be moderate to weak, the 2003 year class is predicted to be moderate to strong, and the 2004 year class will be of moderate strength.Northern pike are not sampled very effectively with standard lake assessment gill nets.  In the 1993 to 2002 fall gill net assessment, northern pike CPUE has ranged from 0.8 to 2.2 with a 10 year mean of 1.7.  The problem of small sample size has been addressed with a spring survey, using trap nets.  Spring spawning run trap net assessment depicts a very high quality northern pike population.  In 1995 the spawning run assessment was expanded to a tagging study, and 1,500 northern pike were tagged.  The primary purpose of this study was to determine whether northern pike using streams in Minnesota as spawning sites were exclusively Minnesota stocks, or if the stocks were shared with the provinces of Manitoba and/or Ontario.  In 1995, 15% of 1,432 tagged pike exceeded 750 mm (~30 inches).  Approximately 2% of tagged northern pike exceed 1,000 mm (~40 inches).  Preliminary tag return data suggest that the northern pike that spawn in Rainy River tributary streams spend their time in the Rainy River and are a distinct stock from the pike that spawn in Lake of the Woods tributaries.  Rainy River tributary streams, as a group, have significantly smaller mean lengths than any of the other sites at which northern pike are tagged.  Zippel Bay and the Warroad River stood out as sites from which a lot of tags were returned.  These are areas that have a relatively high proportion of targeted northern pike effort.  Based on tag returns, northern pike exploitation estimates range from 5.3-7% (depending on whether 30% or 40% of tags are reported) and survival is estimated at 66%. In 2004 an intensive effort was undertaken to learn more about the lake sturgeon in Lake of the Woods-Rainy River system, and to estimate the population size.  The entire project was a cooperative venture between the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources, the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources and the Rainy River First Nation.  During the spring of 2004 the sturgeon were tagged.  The cooperating agencies were able to capture and tag 811 sturgeon, using gill nets and bare hands.  Anglers fishing in the area in which agency crews were tagging donated an additional 938 sturgeon to the cause, for a total of 1,749 tagged fish.  During the summer recapture phase, 659 lake sturgeon were examined for tags.  Eight fish tagged in 2004 were found.The largest sturgeon sampled during this program was 1,810 mm long and was caught and tagged by a volunteer angler.  Generally, angler caught sturgeon were smaller than sturgeon sampled by agency personnel.  Thirty one percent of the sturgeon sampled, longer than 1,000 mm (~40 inches), were in the harvest slot of 45-50 inches.  The population estimate of sturgeon longer than 1,000 mm (~40 inches).was 74,143 (95% CI 39,719 - 151,657).</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake of the Woods straddles the Canada-United States border, and is shared between the Canadian provinces of Manitoba and Ontario, and the U. S. state of Minnesota.  Water level is directly controlled through three hydroelectric dams located at the head of the Winnipeg River in Kenora, Ontario. The Rainy River provides 75% of the inflow to the lake.  Water flow into the Rainy River is controlled through a hydroelectric dam located between Fort Frances, Ontario and International Falls, Minnesota. <br> \n <br> \nThe lake is comprised of several distinct basins.  The Minnesota portion of Lake of the Woods (320,000 acres) lies within Muskeg Bay, Big Traverse Bay and Little Traverse Bay.  Big Traverse Bay and Muskeg Bay are largely devoid of bottom structure and islands.  Little Traverse Bay is more characteristic of the Ontario portion of Lake of the Woods, with numerous islands and reefs.  These three basins do not stratify and in most years have widespread, dense, blue-green algae blooms that are first evident in July and continue through September. <br> \n <br> \nThe largest and most important lakes in Minnesota are sampled every year, in order to closely monitor their fish populations.  Lake of the Woods is one of the ten lakes included in this Large Lake Sampling Program.  These lakes are at least 15,000 acres in size, and typically support the best walleye fisheries in the state. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers fish the Minnesota portion of Lake of the Woods for a variety of species, including walleye, sauger, yellow perch, northern pike and lake sturgeon.  Due to the importance of walleye and sauger, a great deal of population monitoring effort is focused on them.  Overviews of the sampling programs conducted on Lake of the Woods are located on the Baudette Area Fisheries web page, on the MN-DNR web site, at www.mndnr.gov/areas/fisheries/baudette. <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nWalleye <br> \n <br> \nWalleye catches in the 2010 gill net sampling averaged 13.6 walleye per gill net. This level of abundance is slightly below the long-term average of 14.7 walleye per gill net. Walleye abundance declined steadily from 2001 through 2009, from  22.3 to 9.1 walleye per gill net.  For perspective, abundance of the 2001 walleye sample was the highest measured since 1970. <br> \n <br> \nEven though gill net catches have declined  since 2001, the actual harvestable walleye population has not dropped to the same degree.  In years when a strong year class is produced, a substantial portion of the walleye sample is comprised of very small (typically 5 to 8 inches long) walleye.  In 2001, about 25% of the sample was these 5 to 8 inch long walleye.  In 2010, the catch rate of walleye longer than 12 inches (the size anglers prefer to catch and keep) was actually higher than the catch rate of walleye 12 inches and longer in 2001. <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nSauger <br> \n <br> \nThe sauger population is at a very high level of abundance.  Sauger abundance has been increasing steadily over the past four years.  The 1968 to 2009 average catch is 12.9 sauger per gill net.  During fall gill netting in 2010, the sample had an impressive 25.5 sauger per net.  <br> \n <br> \nThe increase in sauger abundance is due to the consistent production of strong year classes in recent years, and the presence of the very strong 2006 year class.  This single year class comprises 60% of the sauger sample, and is the strongest sauger year class documented since 1982.  Sauger from this year class averaged about 12 inches in length during fall gill net sampling. <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nLake Sturgeon <br> \n <br> \nFishing for lake sturgeon is a unique opportunity in the Lake of the Woods-Rainy River system.  The lake sturgeon population is still recovering from a period of low abundance caused by over harvest and pollution.  During the recovery phase we have to be conservative with the number and pounds of sturgeon harvested to ensure that the population fully recovers to a healthy size structure and level of abundance.  In order to harvest a lake sturgeon, anglers must purchase a harvest tag.  However no tag is required to fish catch-and-release for lake sturgeon.  Anglers may harvest one lake sturgeon per year.  A sturgeon must be between 45 and 50 inches (inclusive) or longer than 75 inches to be legal to harvest.  All other sturgeon must be immediately released.  The lake sturgeon harvest season is from April 24 to May 7, and from July 1 to September 30.  The catch and release only season is from May 8 to May 15, and from October 1 through April 23.  You may not fish for lake sturgeon during the closed season (May 16 to June 30). <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nInfested Waters Designation <br> \n <br> \nLake of the Woods and the Rainy River have received an infested waters designation due to the presence of spiny water flea (Bythotrephes longimanus).  Spiny water flea has been documented in Lake of the Woods, Rainy River and Rainy Lake.  The impact of spiny water flea on the food chain and fish populations of Lake of the Woods is still open to speculation.  <br> \n <br> \nZooplankton sampling has been initiated to document changes in the zooplankton community of Lake of the Woods.  Two sites are sampled every other week from mid-June through August.  Nine meter vertical tows are made with a 150 micron, 30 cm diameter plankton net. <br> \n <br> \nAt this date, the most immediate impact of spiny water flea has been to human users of the lake and river.  Emerald shiner is a popular bait fish on Lake of the Woods.  Local bait shops and resorts have had significant businesses harvesting bait within the system.  There is concern that spiny water flea eggs may be ingested by small fish, and that spiny water flea may then be spread through the bait fish distribution.  To deal with this potential issue, a prohibition against bait collection, by non-licensed individuals, has been enacted.  Trained and licensed bait dealers may still collect bait fish from infested waters, but the collected bait must be handled to allow the fish to purge any eggs they may have ingested. <br> \n <br> \nRusty crayfish (Orconectes rusticus) were documented in the Minnesota portion of Lake of the Woods in September 2006.  At this point rusty crayfish appear to be present in fairly low densities, and only as far south as Driftwood Point, just south-east of Garden Island.  Rusty crayfish, a native of the Ohio River system, have been established in parts of the Ontario portion of Lake of the Woods since the late 1960s. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Anglers fish the Minnesota portion of Lake of the Woods for a variety of species, including walleye, sauger, yellow perch, northern pike and lake sturgeon.  Due to the importance of walleye and sauger, a great deal of population monitoring effort is focused on them.  Overviews of the sampling programs conducted on Lake of the Woods are located on the Baudette Area Fisheries web page, on the MN-DNR web site, at www.mndnr.gov/areas/fisheries/baudette. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye and Sauger <br> \n <br> \nThe primary assessment used to monitor walleye and sauger populations is fall gill net assessment.  This assessment has been annual since 1981, but a comparable assessment was conducted from 1968 through 1970.  From 1968 through 2001, the fall gill net assessment sampled the near-shore waters of Lake of the Woods, from 6 to 25 feet in depth.  In 2002 off-shore nets were added to the assessment. The off-shore nets sample water from 32 to 35 feet deep. The off-shore nets are analyzed separately from the standard nets due to differences in catch rate and size distribution. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye.  Walleye catches in the 2015 near-shore gill net sampling averaged 14.7 walleye per gill net, which just below the 1968-2014 average of 15.1. Walleye were more abundant in the off-shore portions of the lake in September of 2015, with 26.3 Walleye per gill net, which is well above the 2002 to 2014 average of 16.6.  Overall Walleye abundance (16.9 per lift) was above the 2002 to 2014 average abundance of 16.2 Walleye per lift.   <br> \n <br> \nThe number of walleye sampled annually can be quite variable due to the presence or absence of strong year classes in the population, and environmental conditions that affect netting efficiency.  Walleye abundance declined steadily from 2001 through 2009, from 22.3 to 9.1 walleye per gill net.  This decline in abundance was attributable to the unusually abundant walleye population in 2001, due to the production of a series of strong year classes in the late 1990s and in 2001, which pushed overall abundance well above the long-term average of 15.1 walleye per gill net.  More recently, the 2011 year class is strong, and early indications are that the 2013 year class will be moderately strong <br> \nThe most abundant size groups of walleye are from 7 to 10 inches long (2014 and 2015 year classes), and from 14-16 inches long (primarily from the 2011 year class). <br> \n <br> \nSauger.  The highest sauger abundance measured in the fall gill net assessment was in 2009, when we found 30.8 sauger per lift.  This high abundance was driven by young sauger from the strong year classes produced from 2005 through 2007, and there were relatively few keepers available.  As these sauger have grown older, overall abundance has declined, but a high quality size structure has developed. Overall sauger abundance declined from 2009 through 2013, because only the 2011 year class was strong through this period.  From 2002 through 2014 Sauger tended to be much more abundant in the off-shore sample than in the near-shore sample.  In 2015 they were almost equally distributed at 16.6 Sauger per lift in the near-shore sites, and 15.7 in the off-shore sites.  This compares to 2002 to 2014 averages of 16.1 and 24.7, respectively.  Overall, Sauger abundance was 16.4 Sauger per lift, down from the 2002 to 2014 average of 19.5 per lift. <br> \nSauger from 11 to 13 inches long are all more abundant than the long-term average, and sauger from 13 to 16 inches long are well represented in the sauger population. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike <br> \n <br> \nLake of the Woods is managed for a high-quality northern pike population, with a significant component of \"trophy\" northern pike over 40 inches long.  To monitor the size structure of the northern pike population, it is sampled every 5 years using trap nets at known spawning sites.  The northern pike population continues to be one of high quality, with 19% of the adult population at least 35 inches long, and 5% of the adults 40 inches long, or longer.  The next northern pike sample is scheduled to be collected in the spring of 2015, though the low runoff we are experiencing may prevent that sampling program from being completed. <br> \n <br> \nLake Sturgeon <br> \n <br> \nThe third population estimate for lake sturgeon since 1990 was completed in 2014.  Previous estimates for lake sturgeon (40-inches and longer) were 16,000 (1990) and 59,000 (2004).  In 2014 we estimate that there were 92,000 lake sturgeon of 40-inches and longer in the Lake of the Woods-Rainy River system.  Along with the increase in abundance, we also found that the number of \"large\" sturgeon increased.  The largest sturgeon we sampled was 72-inches long, and had an estimated weight of 104 pounds. <br> \nFishing for lake sturgeon is a unique opportunity in the Lake of the Woods-Rainy River system.  The lake sturgeon population is still recovering from a period of low abundance caused by over harvest and pollution.  During the recovery phase we have to be conservative with the number and pounds of sturgeon harvested to ensure that the population fully recovers to a healthy size structure and level of abundance.  In order to harvest a lake sturgeon, anglers must purchase a harvest tag.  However no tag is required to fish catch-and-release for lake sturgeon.  Anglers may harvest one lake sturgeon per year.  A sturgeon must be between 45 and 50 inches (inclusive) or longer than 75 inches to be legal to harvest.  All other sturgeon must be immediately released.  The lake sturgeon harvest season is from April 24 to May 7, and from July 1 to September 30.  The catch and release only season is from May 8 to May 15, and from October 1 through April 23.  You may not fish for lake sturgeon during the closed season (May 16 to June 30). <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nInfested Waters Designation <br> \n <br> \nLake of the Woods and the Rainy River have received an infested waters designation due to the presence of spiny water flea (Bythotrephes longimanus).  Spiny water flea has been documented in Lake of the Woods, Rainy River and Rainy Lake.  The impact of spiny water flea on the food chain and fish populations of Lake of the Woods is still open to speculation.  <br> \n <br> \nZooplankton sampling has been initiated to document changes in the zooplankton community Thirty-foot vertical tows are made with an 80 micron, 30 cm diameter plankton net. <br> \n <br> \nAt this date, the most immediate impact of spiny water flea has been to human users of the lake and river.  Emerald shiner is a popular bait fish on Lake of the Woods.  Local bait shops and resorts have had significant businesses harvesting bait within the system.  There is concern that spiny water flea eggs may be ingested by small fish, and that spiny water flea may then be spread through the bait fish distribution.  To deal with this potential issue, a prohibition against bait collection, by non-licensed individuals, has been enacted.  Trained and licensed bait dealers may still collect bait fish from infested waters, but the collected bait must be handled to allow the fish to purge any eggs they may have ingested. <br> \n <br> \nRusty crayfish (Orconectes rusticus) were documented in the Minnesota portion of Lake of the Woods in September 2006.  At this point rusty crayfish appear to be present in fairly low densities, but are continuing to expand south.  Last fall they were found from Stoney Point (south-eastern portion of the Northwest Angle) across to Knight Island.  Rusty crayfish, a native of the Ohio River system, have been established in parts of the Ontario portion of Lake of the Woods since the late 1960s <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Physical Description  <br> \n <br> \nLake of the Woods straddles the Canada-United States border, and is shared between the Canadian provinces of Manitoba and Ontario, and the U. S. state of Minnesota. Water level is directly controlled through three hydroelectric dams located at the head of the Winnipeg River in Kenora, Ontario. The Rainy River provides 75% of the inflow to the lake.  <br> \n <br> \nThe lake is comprised of several distinct basins. The Minnesota portion of Lake of the Woods (just over 300,000 acres) lies within Muskeg Bay, Big Traverse Bay and Little Traverse Bay. Big Traverse Bay and Muskeg Bay are largely devoid of bottom structure and islands. Little Traverse Bay is more characteristic of the Ontario portion of Lake of the Woods, with numerous islands and reefs. These three basins do not stratify and in most years have widespread, dense, blue-green algae blooms that are first evident in July and continue through October. <br> \n <br> \nFisheries Management <br> \n <br> \nIn December of 2017, DNR Fisheries in Baudette began a management plan review/revision for Lake of the Woods, and solicited input from the public and a Fisheries Input Group. Stated within the fisheries management plan is a brief background of management history, series of management goals and objectives and management actions. The plan is effective for five years and goals/objectives will be reevaluated in 2023. The final plan can be found at: https://files.dnr.state.mn.us/fisheries/largelakes/low/low_plan.pdf <br> \n <br> \nThe largest and most important lakes in Minnesota are sampled every year, in order to closely monitor their fish populations. Lake of the Woods is one of the large lakes included in this Large Lake Sampling Program. These lakes are at least 15,000 acres in size, and typically support the best Walleye fisheries in the state. Anglers fish the Minnesota portion of Lake of the Woods for a variety of species, including Walleye, Sauger, Yellow Perch, Northern Pike and Lake Sturgeon. Due to the importance of Walleye and Sauger, a great deal of population monitoring effort is focused on them. Overviews of the sampling programs conducted on Lake of the Woods are located on the Baudette Area Fisheries web page, on the MN-DNR web site, at www.mndnr.gov/areas/fisheries/baudette. <br> \n <br> \nThe primary assessment used to monitor fish populations is fall gill net assessment. This assessment has been annual since 1981, but a comparable assessment was conducted from 1968 through 1970. From 1968 through 2001, the fall gill net assessment sampled the near-shore waters of Lake of the Woods, from 6 to 25 feet in depth. In 2002 off-shore nets were added to the assessment. The off-shore nets sample water from 32 to 35 feet deep. There are differences in the size structure and abundance of fish species in the near-shore and off-shore samples.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye <br> \n <br> \nSince 2002, the average Walleye catch rate or catch per unit effort (CPUE) is 16.2 fish/net (both near and off-shore nets combined). The 2022 CPUE was 12.8 fish/net and up from 2021 (11.5 fish/net). The current 3-year average for CPUE is 12.4 fish/net and fell below the 2018-2023 management goal ~ 14 fish/net. Gill net sampled Walleye ranged in length from 3.4 to 31.1 inches with an average length of 12.6 inches. Small Walleye (~ 8-10 inches) were above average, while keeper-sized Walleye (14 to 19 inches) were below the historic average. Walleye 11 to 14 inches were well below historic levels, the result of weaker year-classes being produced in 2019 and 2020. Lastly, gill net catch rate for large Walleye (> 20 inches) was 1.3 fish/net in 2022 with a stable trend the past decade (1 to 2.2 fish per net).  <br> \n <br> \nSauger <br> \n <br> \nIn 2022, Sauger gill net CPUE was 16.2 fish/net and the current 3-year average (21.5 fish/net) exceeds the 2018-2023 management goal of ~ 16 fish/net. Above average Sauger abundance experienced the past few years is the result of several strong year-classes being produced over the past decade. However, low gill net and trawl catches of small Sauger (> 10 inches) in 2022 suggests weaker than average year-classes for 2020 and 2021. Sauger sampled in 2022, ranged in length from 3 to 17.2 inches with an average length of 11.4 inches. Sauger greater than 11 inches were well above average.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike <br> \n <br> \nLake of the Woods is managed for a high-quality Northern Pike population, with a significant component of \"trophy\" Northern Pike over 40 inches long. To monitor the size structure of the Northern Pike population, it is sampled every 5 years using trap nets at known spawning sites. Trap netting conducted in 2022 revealed a high-quality size structure for sampled tributaries to Lake of the Woods. Fall gill netting in 2022 sampled Northern Pike from 8.5 to 41.9 inches with an average length of 23.3 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch are often not targeted by anglers fishing Lake of the Woods, but are caught incidentally fishing for Walleye and Sauger. Under the current fisheries management plan for 2018-2023 no population level goals are set for Yellow Perch, but they are of management interest. Results from 2022 indicate perch near-shore abundance was above the 10-year average and was the highest observed since 2003. Catch rates for Yellow Perch are highly variable, but have slightly declined since the early 1990s. Yellow Perch ranged in length from 4.8 to 13.6 inches with an average length of 7.9 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nLake Sturgeon <br> \n <br> \nSince 2004, spawning Lake Sturgeon are sampled annually on the Rapid River (a tributary to the Rainy River). Over the past 15 years there has been an overall increase in mean length and greater proportion of \"large\" sturgeon in the sampled population. In addition to obtaining lengths, sampled Lake Sturgeon are tagged with a unique number at the base of the dorsal fin. This information has revealed that males typically spawn every 2 to 3 years (in some cases annually) and females spawn every 4 to 9 years. In total over 2,000 fish have been tagged at the Rapid River and over 10,000 have been tagged system-wide since the inception of the tagging program. In addition to natural resource sampling, nearly 250 tag returns are reported annually by anglers. This information provides information on movement patterns, spawning occurrence, growth, and harvest metrics. <br> \n <br> \nIn order to harvest a Lake Sturgeon, anglers must purchase a harvest tag. However no tag is required to fish catch-and-release for Lake Sturgeon. Anglers may harvest one Lake Sturgeon per calendar year. A sturgeon must be between 45 and 50 inches (inclusive) or longer than 75 inches to be legal to harvest; harvested sturgeon must be registered per guidance in regulation book. All other sturgeon must be immediately released. The Lake Sturgeon harvest season is from April 24 to May 7, and from July 1 to September 30. The catch and release only season is from May 8 to May 15, and from October 1 through April 23. You may not fish for Lake Sturgeon during the closed season (May 16 to June 30). <br> \n <br> \nFor more information about Lake Sturgeon angling please see: <br> \nhttps://www.dnr.state.mn.us/areas/fisheries/baudette/lowregs.html  <br> \n <br> \nTo report a tagged Lake Sturgeon please see: <br> \nhttps://www.dnr.state.mn.us/fisheries/tagged_fish_reporting/index.html  <br> \n <br> \nInfested Waters Designation  <br> \n <br> \nLake of the Woods and the Rainy River have received an infested waters designation due to the presence of Spiny Water Flea and Zebra Mussel. Spiny Water Flea was first documented in the late 2000s in the Minnesota waters of Lake of the Woods. Zebra Mussel veligers (lavae) were first sampled by fisheries staff in Muskeg Bay in 2019. No adult Zebra Mussel were observed in 2022.  <br> \n <br> \nAt this date, the most immediate impact of Spiny Water Flea has been to human users of the lake and river. Emerald Shiner is a popular bait fish on Lake of the Woods. Local bait shops and resorts have had significant businesses harvesting bait within the system. There is concern that Spiny Water Flea eggs may be ingested by small fish, and that Spiny Water Flea may then be spread through the bait fish distribution. To deal with this potential issue, a prohibition against bait collection, by non-permitted individuals, has been enacted. Trained and licensed bait dealers may still collect bait fish from infested waters, but the collected bait must be handled to allow the fish to purge any eggs they may have ingested.  <br> \n <br> \nRusty Crayfish, a native of the Ohio River system, have been established in parts of the Ontario portion of Lake of the Woods since the late 1960s, but have been present in the Minnesota portion of Lake of the Woods only since 2006. At this point Rusty Crayfish are present in fairly low densities but are continuing to expand south. Last fall they were found from the Northwest Angle, south to Pine Island in addition to the Rainy River. Densities of Rusty Crayfish decline substantially from the Northwest Angle south. Rusty Crayfish have displaced the native crayfish within 2 years of colonizing an area and have been associated with declines in aquatic vegetation when they become established. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>The walleye population is in very good shape with about 15 age groups represented annually.  The oldest walleye sampled in the 2002 fall gill net assessment was a 18 year-old, 689 mm long female. The 1991 year class walleye are no longer a major component of the gill net sample.  The majority of the 1991 year class walleye have outgrown the experimental gill net, and just over 13% of the supplementary large mesh gill net was of this strong year class.  The 1991 walleye year class had been the strongest measured on Lake of the Woods (since 1984), but the 1999 year class appears to be of similar strength. Year class strength of walleye and sauger can be predicted with a fairly high degree of confidence (r2=0.74) based on information collected during YOY percid assessment, conducted during July and August.  The variables used to predict walleye year class strength are the length that YOY walleye achieve by August 15 and the age-0 walleye CPUE from August trawling.  Length, CPUE and year class strength are positively correlated.  The length YOY walleye achieved by August 15 length and their trawl CPUE suggest that the 2001 walleye year class will be very strong, but that the 2002 year class will be weak.Overall the walleye population is in very good shape.  Abundance (21.4 walleye per lift), measured in fall gill net assessment, was similar to 2001 and remained above the 10-year mean abundance of 14.8.  The relatively high abundance of the walleye population is due to recruitment of the very strong 2001 year class to the sample and the continued presence of walleye from moderate and strong year classes produced from 1995 through 1999.The sauger population has been characterized by highly variable recruitment.  From 1991 through 1996 three weak year classes, but no strong year classes, were produced.  Since 1996 sauger recruitment has been much stronger.  Strong year classes were produced in 1997 and 1999, and the 1998 and 2000 year classes are of moderate strength.  The result of the improved recruitment is that sauger abundance has increased form a low of 5.4 sauger per lift, in 1997, to the current 20.1 sauger per lift, as measured in fall gill net assessment.  Ice anglers readily accept sauger when they reach 11 inches in length.  Fifty-seven percent of the fall gill net sauger sample was longer than 11 inches.Sauger year class strength can be predicted using YOY sauger abundance, measured through August trawling, and walleye abundance, measured through fall gill net assessment (r2=0.92).  Young of year sauger abundance is positively correlated with year class strength, while walleye abundance has an inverse relationship with sauger year class strength.  YOY sauger abundance was moderate to low, based on 2001 trawling, while fall walleye gill net CPUE was high. The combination of these variables predict that the 2001 and 2002 sauger year classes will be weak.Northern pike are not sampled very effectively with standard lake assessment gill nets.  In the 1993 to 2002 fall gill net assessment, northern pike CPUE has ranged from 0.8 to 2.2 with a 10 year mean of 1.7.  The problem of small sample size has been addressed with a spring survey, using trap nets.  Spring spawning run trap net assessment depicts a very high quality northern pike population.  In 1995 the spawning run assessment was expanded to a tagging study, and 1,500 northern pike were tagged.  The primary purpose of this study was to determine whether northern pike using streams in Minnesota as spawning sites were exclusively Minnesota stocks, or if the stocks were shared with the provinces of Manitoba and/or Ontario.  In 1995, 15% of 1,432 tagged pike exceeded 750 mm (~30 inches).  Approximately 2% of tagged northern pike exceed 1,000 mm (~40 inches).  Preliminary tag return data suggest that the northern pike that spawn in Rainy River tributary streams spend their time in the Rainy River and are a distinct stock from the pike that spawn in Lake of the Woods tributaries.  Rainy River tributary streams, as a group, have significantly smaller mean lengths than any of the other sites at which northern pike are tagged.  Zippel Bay and the Warroad River stood out as sites from which a lot of tags were returned.  These are areas that have a relatively high proportion of targeted northern pike effort.  Based on tag returns, northern pike exploitation estimates range from 5.3-7% (depending on whether 30% or 40% of tags are reported) and survival is estimated at 66%. Data from the summer 2002 creel surveys are available.  This past summer was, once again, one of excellent walleye fishing success on Lake of the Woods.  Once again, summer angling pressure was lower than the five-year mean, but harvest was higher than the five year mean walleye harvest.    The excellent fishing success was likely due to the very low abundance of age-0 and age-1 yellow perch combined with very high walleye abundance.  Walleye angling success peaked from June 1-15 at 0.0.82 walleye per hour (0.58 harvested and 0.24 released).  Combined (harvested and released) walleye angling CPUE did not drop below 0.40 at any time during the creel survey period.  In September overall walleye catch rates normally decline.  During the summer of 2002 however the release rates increased, and drove overall catch rates over 0.60 walleye per hour.  It is likely that this increase was driven by walleye from the 2001 year class growing to a size where they could be hooked by anglers.  Overall summer walleye CPUE was 0.61 (0.40 harvested and 0.21 released).  The summer harvest of walleye on the Minnesota waters of Lake of the Woods was 373,559 pounds, from a pressure of 642,810 angler hours.A creel survey was also conducted on the Northwest Angle based anglers this past summer.  Minnesota based anglers harvested 22,497 pounds of walleye from the Minnesota portion of Lake of the Woods, and 26,055 pounds from Ontario.  Total walleye CPUE for the Minnesota portion of the lake was 0.53 (0.24 harvested, 0.29 released) and 0.68 (0.15 harvested and 0.52 released) in Ontario.The five-year mean total walleye harvest (all creel surveys combined) rose to 505,582 pounds, well above the target harvest of 430,000 pounds.  This high harvest has occurred during a time of relatively high walleye abundance.  The most sensitive indicator of excessive harvest on a walleye population is the loss of the larger older individuals from the population.  The presence of these individuals is monitored through the Spring Spawning Run Electrofishing assessment at the Long Sault Rapids, near Birchdale.   Current data suggests that the walleye population remains in a healthy condition.About 21,000 pounds of sauger were harvested during the summer of 2002.  The overall non-targeted harvest rate of sauger was 0.05, with an overall non-targeted catch rate of 0.09.  Northwest Angle based anglers harvested 2,358 pounds from the Minnesota portion of Lake of the Woods.  This is more than three times as high as the 1994-1996 average sauger harvest from the Minnesota waters of Lake of the Woods by Northwest Angle based anglers.  Winter continues to be the time period where the majority of sauger are harvested.  Eighty-two percent of all sauger harvested from the Minnesota waters of Lake of the Woods are harvested through the ice fishery based on the South Shore of Lake of the Woods.  The five year mean sauger harvest is 207,071 pounds.  Sauger target harvest is currently being reviewed as a part of the Border Waters Atlas revision.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Walleye catches in the 2008 gill net sampling averaged 10.3 walleye per gill net. This level of abundance is well below the long-term average of 14.9 walleye per gill net. Walleye abundance has declined steadily since 2001, when 22.3 walleye per gill net were sampled.  Abundance of the 2001 walleye sample was the highest measured since 1970. <br> \n <br> \nThe high abundance in 2001 was the result of a series of moderate and strong year classes produced from 1994 through 2001. During that eight-year span, only one weak year class was produced, in 2000.  Strong back-to-back year classes are unusual in a walleye population. From 2000 through 2008, four weak, four moderate, and only one strong (2001) year class have been produced.  Significant variation in abundance is normal for walleye, and all members of the perch family. <br> \n <br> \nEven though gill net catches have declined substantially since 2001, the actual harvestable walleye population has not dropped to the same degree.  In years when a strong year class is produced, a substantial portion of the walleye sample is comprised of very small (typically 5 to 8 inches long) walleye.  In 2001, about 25% of the sample was these 5 to 8 inch long walleye.  In 2008, the portion of the sample, that is of a size anglers prefer to catch and keep, is still almost 70% of the same portion of the population in 2001. <br> \n <br> \nSo, how will this abundance decline influence angling success?  The short answer is likely very little.  Overall fish abundance does play a role in angler success, but other factors, such as weather patterns and forage abundance, are frequently a much greater influence.  As an extreme example, very poor fishing was experienced during the winter of 2005-06.  The primary influence during that winter was a series of wind storms that occurred just as the ice was forming on the lake.  The wind storms caused the water to become very muddy, and the suspended sediments did not settle out until very late in the winter. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers can expect to catch a wide range of walleye sizes this winter.  Walleye from 12 through 18 inches were all well represented in the gill net sample. <br> \n <br> \nIn contrast to the walleye population, the sauger population is at it\u0019s highest level of abundance measured since fall gill net sampling started in 1968.  Sauger abundance has been increasing steadily over the past four years.  The 1968 to 2008 average catch is 12.3 sauger per gill net.  During fall gill netting in 2008, the sample had an impressive 26.0 sauger per net.  Just as the walleye gill net catch rate should not be interpreted as gloomy, the sauger catch rate also has to be taken in context.  Only about 30% of the sample exceeded 12 inches in length, with sauger between 9 and 10 inches long comprising another 30% of the sample.  <br> \n <br> \nThe increase in sauger abundance is due to the consistent production of good year classes in recent years, and the presence of the very strong 2006 year class.  This single year class comprises almost 70% of the sauger sample, and is the strongest sauger year class documented since 1982.  Most of the sauger from this year class will range from 8 to 10 inches in length, during the winter 2008-09 winter fishery.  <br> \n <br> \nAnglers can anticipate catching good numbers of 11-inch sauger, from the moderately strong 2005 year class.  The very abundant 2006 year class sauger will be of \"bait-stealer\" size this winter, and anglers can expect to go through a lot of bait when the fishing is good. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Status <br> \n <br> \nAnglers fish the Minnesota portion of Lake of the Woods for a variety of species, including Walleye, Sauger, Yellow Perch, Northern Pike and Lake Sturgeon.  Due to the importance of Walleye and Sauger, a great deal of population monitoring effort is focused on them.  Overviews of the sampling programs conducted on Lake of the Woods are located on the Baudette Area Fisheries web page, on the MN-DNR web site, at www.mndnr.gov/areas/fisheries/baudette. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye and Sauger <br> \n <br> \nThe primary assessment used to monitor Walleye and Sauger populations is fall gill net assessment.  This assessment has been annual since 1981, but a comparable assessment was conducted from 1968 through 1970.  From 1968 through 2001, the fall gill net assessment sampled the near-shore waters of Lake of the Woods, from 6 to 25 feet in depth.  In 2002 off-shore nets were added to the assessment. The off-shore nets sample water from 32 to 35 feet deep.  There are differences in the size structure and abundance of Walleye and Sauger in the near-shore and off-shore samples.  Though the samples are combined in the data portion of this report, they are discussed separately in this narrative. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye.  Walleye catches in the 2016 near-shore gill net sample averaged 25.2 Walleye per gill net, which just well above the 1968-2015 average of 15.1. Walleye were also abundant in the off-shore portions of the lake, with 21.1 Walleye per gill net, which is well above the 2002 to 2015 average of 16.6.  When the near-shore and off-shore samples are combined, it appears that Walleye are slightly more abundant than they were last year.  The 2013 and 2014 year classes are both strong, and the 2015 and 2016 year classes are predicted to be of average strength.  When this is combined with only a single weak year class (2008) in the past 10 years, the result is an abundant Walleye population. <br> \n <br> \nSmall Walleye, from 7 to 12 inches long, are currently quite abundant.  \"Keeper-size\" Walleye are also abundant, with individuals from 13 to 18 inches being well represented. <br> \n <br> \nSauger.  The highest Sauger abundance measured in the fall gill net assessment was in 2009, when we found 30.8 Sauger per lift.  This high abundance was driven by young Sauger from the strong year classes produced from 2005 through 2007, and there were relatively few keepers available.  As these Sauger have grown older, overall abundance has declined, but a high quality size structure has developed.  <br> \n <br> \nOverall abundance increased to the highest level since 2011, though this is being driven by a strong 2014 year class.  These Sauger won't be large enough for most anglers to consider them to be keepers until the winter of 2018-19.  Additionally, individuals from 7 to 10 inches long were also common.  These small Sauger predict a good future for our Sauger population.  Of interest to anglers is that Sauger from 12 to 15 inches were relatively abundant, and individuals to 18 inches long were sampled.  <br> \nNorthern Pike <br> \n <br> \nLake of the Woods is managed for a high-quality Northern Pike population, with a significant component of \"trophy\" Northern Pike over 40 inches long.  To monitor the size structure of the Northern Pike population, it is sampled every 5 years using trap nets at known spawning sites.   <br> \n <br> \nTwo spawning sites were sampled in the spring of 2016.  Due to weather issues, we were not able to sample a third site that was on the schedule.  This site will be sampled in the spring of 2017. <br> \n <br> \nSamples collected in the spring of 2016 show that the percentage of Northern Pike longer than 40 inches has remained stable at 6 to 8% of the females that were sampled, but the percentage of mid-size Northern Pike has declined a bit.  Percentages are strongly influenced by the production of strong year classes, so the sample collected in 2017 should shed some light on if the decline is real or if there was simply a strong year class produced that diluted the percentage of the mid-sized fish. <br> \n <br> \nLake Sturgeon <br> \n <br> \nThe third population estimate for Lake Sturgeon since 1990 was completed in 2014.  Previous estimates for Lake Sturgeon (40-inches and longer) were 16,000 (1990) and 59,000 (2004).  In 2014 we estimate that there were 92,000 Lake Sturgeon of 40-inches and longer in the Lake of the Woods-Rainy River system.  Along with the increase in abundance, we also found that the number of \"large\" sturgeon increased.  The largest sturgeon we sampled was 72-inches long, and had an estimated weight of 104 pounds. <br> \nFishing for Lake Sturgeon is a unique opportunity in the Lake of the Woods-Rainy River system.  The Lake Sturgeon population is still recovering from a period of low abundance caused by over harvest and pollution.  During the recovery phase we have to be conservative with the number and pounds of sturgeon harvested to ensure that the population fully recovers to a healthy size structure and level of abundance.  In order to harvest a Lake Sturgeon, anglers must purchase a harvest tag.  However no tag is required to fish catch-and-release for Lake Sturgeon.  Anglers may harvest one Lake Sturgeon per year.  A sturgeon must be between 45 and 50 inches (inclusive) or longer than 75 inches to be legal to harvest.  All other sturgeon must be immediately released.  The Lake Sturgeon harvest season is from April 24 to May 7, and from July 1 to September 30.  The catch and release only season is from May 8 to May 15, and from October 1 through April 23.  You may not fish for Lake Sturgeon during the closed season (May 16 to June 30). <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nInfested Waters Designation <br> \n <br> \nLake of the Woods and the Rainy River have received an infested waters designation due to the presence of spiny water flea (Bythotrephes longimanus).  Spiny water flea has been documented in Lake of the Woods, Rainy River and Rainy Lake.  The impact of spiny water flea on the food chain and fish populations of Lake of the Woods is still open to speculation.  <br> \n <br> \nZooplankton sampling has been initiated to document changes in the zooplankton community Thirty-foot vertical tows are made with an 80 micron, 30 cm diameter plankton net. <br> \n <br> \nAt this date, the most immediate impact of spiny water flea has been to human users of the lake and river.  Emerald shiner is a popular bait fish on Lake of the Woods.  Local bait shops and resorts have had significant businesses harvesting bait within the system.  There is concern that spiny water flea eggs may be ingested by small fish, and that spiny water flea may then be spread through the bait fish distribution.  To deal with this potential issue, a prohibition against bait collection, by non-licensed individuals, has been enacted.  Trained and licensed bait dealers may still collect bait fish from infested waters, but the collected bait must be handled to allow the fish to purge any eggs they may have ingested. <br> \n <br> \nRusty crayfish, a native of the Ohio River system, have been established in parts of the Ontario portion of Lake of the Woods since the late 1960s, but have been present in the Minnesota portion of Lake of the Woods only since 2006.  At this point rusty crayfish are present in fairly low densities, but are continuing to expand south.  Last fall they were found from Stoney Point (south-eastern portion of the Northwest Angle), south to about 5 miles north of Long Point, and then north-east to Knight Island.  Rusty Crayfish have displaced the native crayfish within 2 years of colonizing an area, and have been associated with declines in aquatic vegetation when they become established. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Physical Description  <br> \n <br> \nLake of the Woods straddles the Canada-United States border and is shared between the Canadian provinces of Manitoba and Ontario, and the U. S. state of Minnesota. Water level is directly controlled through three hydroelectric dams located at the head of the Winnipeg River in Kenora, Ontario. The Rainy River provides 75% of the inflow to the lake.  <br> \n <br> \nThe lake is comprised of several distinct basins. The Minnesota portion of Lake of the Woods (just over 300,000 acres) lies within Muskeg Bay, Big Traverse Bay and Little Traverse Bay. Big Traverse Bay and Muskeg Bay are largely devoid of bottom structure and islands. Little Traverse Bay is more characteristic of the Ontario portion of Lake of the Woods, with numerous islands and reefs. These three basins do not stratify and in most years have widespread, dense, blue-green algae blooms that are first evident in July and continue through October. <br> \n <br> \nFisheries Management <br> \n <br> \nIn December of 2017, DNR Fisheries in Baudette began a management plan review/revision for Lake of the Woods and solicited input from the public and a Fisheries Input Group. Stated within the fisheries management plan is a brief background of management history, series of management goals and objectives and management actions  An update of the current Lake of the Woods management plan is in development. To get more information about the planning process or to view the current plan, please visit https://www.dnr.state.mn.us/lakeofthewoods/index.html.  <br> \n <br> \nThe largest and most important lakes in Minnesota are sampled every year, in order to closely monitor their fish populations. Lake of the Woods is one of the large lakes included in this Large Lake Sampling Program. These lakes are at least 15,000 acres in size, and typically support the best Walleye fisheries in the state. Anglers fish the Minnesota portion of Lake of the Woods for a variety of species, including Walleye, Sauger, Yellow Perch, Northern Pike and Lake Sturgeon. Due to the importance of Walleye and Sauger, a great deal of population monitoring effort is focused on them. Overviews of the sampling programs conducted on Lake of the Woods are located on the Baudette Area Fisheries web page, on the MN-DNR web site, at www.mndnr.gov/areas/fisheries/baudette. <br> \n <br> \nThe primary assessment used to monitor fish populations is fall gill net assessment. This assessment has been annual since 1981, but a comparable assessment was conducted from 1968 through 1970. From 1968 through 2001, the fall gill net assessment sampled the near-shore waters of Lake of the Woods, from 6 to 25 feet in depth. In 2002 off-shore nets were added to the assessment. The off-shore nets sample water from 32 to 35 feet deep. There are differences in the size structure and abundance of fish species in the near-shore and off-shore samples.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye <br> \n <br> \nSince 2002, the average Walleye catch rate or catch per unit effort (CPUE) is 16.4 fish/net (both near and off-shore nets combined). The 2023 CPUE was 21.8 fish/net and up from 2022 (12.8 fish/net). The current 3-year average for CPUE is 15.1 fish/net and meets the 2018-2023 management goal ~ 14 fish/net. Gill net sampled Walleye ranged in length from 5.5 to 29.7 inches with an average length of 11.6 inches. Small Walleye (~ 7-8 inches) were above average, while keeper-sized Walleye (14 to 19 inches) were at the historic average. Walleye 10 to 13 inches were at or above historic levels, the result of the strong year-classes being produced in 2021. Lastly, gill net catch rate for large Walleye (> 20 inches) was 0.77 fish/net in 2023 with a stable trend the past decade (0.77 to 2.2 fish per net) but the lowest observed since 2008.  <br> \n <br> \nSauger <br> \n <br> \nIn 2023, Sauger gill net CPUE was 16.5 fish/net and the current 3-year average (18.4 fish/net) meeting the 2018-2023 management goal of ~ 16 fish/net. Average to above-average Sauger abundance experienced the past decade is the result of several strong year-classes being produced. High gill net catches of small Sauger (> 8-9 inches) in 2023 suggests a stronger than predicted year-class for 2022. However, below average catches of Sauger 10 to 12 inches and confirms the below average year-classes in 2020 and 2021. Sauger sampled in 2023, ranged in length from 3.1 to 17.2 inches with an average length of 11.2 inches. Sauger CPUE greater than 12 inches was well above the historical average. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike <br> \n <br> \nLake of the Woods is managed for a high-quality Northern Pike population, with a significant component of \"trophy\" Northern Pike over 40 inches long. To monitor the size structure of the Northern Pike population, it is sampled every five years using trap nets at known spawning sites. Trap netting conducted over the past few years revealed a high-quality size structure for sampled tributaries to Lake of the Woods and Rainy River. Fall gill netting in 2023 sampled Northern Pike from 14.5 to 41.4 inches with an average length of 24.4 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch are often not targeted by anglers fishing Lake of the Woods but are caught incidentally fishing for Walleye and Sauger. Under the current fisheries management plan for 2018-2023 no population level goals are set for Yellow Perch, but they are of management interest. Results from 2023 indicate perch near-shore abundance was above the historical average. Catch rates for Yellow Perch are highly variable but have slightly declined since the early 1990s. Yellow Perch ranged in length from 2.3 to 13.7 inches with an average length of 8.3 inches. Approximately 50% of the catch were fish from the 2021 year-class (6 to 8 inches) and should hopefully provide anglers an additional opportunity in the next couple of years. <br> \n <br> \nLake Sturgeon <br> \n <br> \nSince 2004, spawning Lake Sturgeon have been sampled annually on the Rapid River (a tributary to the Rainy River). Over the past 15 years there has been an overall increase in mean length and greater proportion of \"large\" sturgeon in the sampled population. In addition to obtaining lengths, sampled Lake Sturgeon are tagged with a unique number at the base of the dorsal fin. This information has revealed that males typically spawn every 2 to 3 years (in some cases annually) and females spawn every 4 to 9 years. In total over 2,000 fish have been tagged at the Rapid River and over 10,000 have been tagged system-wide since the inception of the tagging program. In addition to natural resource sampling, nearly 250 tag returns are reported annually by anglers. This information provides information on movement patterns, spawning occurrence, growth, and harvest metrics. <br> \n <br> \nIn order to harvest a Lake Sturgeon, anglers must purchase a harvest tag. However no tag is required to fish catch-and-release for Lake Sturgeon. Anglers may harvest one Lake Sturgeon per calendar year. A sturgeon must be between 45 and 50 inches (inclusive) or longer than 75 inches to be legal to harvest; harvested sturgeon must be registered per guidance in regulation book. All other sturgeon must be immediately released. The Lake Sturgeon harvest season is from April 24 to May 7, and from July 1 to September 30. The catch and release only season is from May 8 to May 15, and from October 1 through April 23. You may not fish for Lake Sturgeon during the closed season (May 16 to June 30). <br> \n <br> \nFor more information about Lake Sturgeon angling please see: <br> \nhttps://www.dnr.state.mn.us/areas/fisheries/baudette/lowregs.html  <br> \n <br> \nTo report a tagged Lake Sturgeon please see: <br> \nhttps://www.dnr.state.mn.us/fisheries/tagged_fish_reporting/index.html  <br> \n <br> \nInfested Waters Designation  <br> \n <br> \nLake of the Woods and the Rainy River have received an infested waters designation due to the presence of Spiny Water Flea and Zebra Mussel. Spiny Water Flea was first documented in the late 2000s in the Minnesota waters of Lake of the Woods. Zebra Mussel veligers (lavae) were first sampled by fisheries staff in Muskeg Bay in 2019. No adult Zebra Mussel were observed in 2023.  <br> \n <br> \nAt this date, the most immediate impact of Spiny Water Flea has been to human users of the lake and river. Emerald Shiner is a popular bait fish on Lake of the Woods. Local bait shops and resorts have had significant businesses harvesting bait within the system. There is concern that Spiny Water Flea eggs may be ingested by small fish, and that Spiny Water Flea may then be spread through the bait fish distribution. To deal with this potential issue, a prohibition against bait collection, by non-permitted individuals, has been enacted. Trained and licensed bait dealers may still collect bait fish from infested waters, but the collected bait must be handled to allow the fish to purge any eggs they may have ingested.  <br> \n <br> \nRusty Crayfish, a native of the Ohio River system, have been established in parts of the Ontario portion of Lake of the Woods since the late 1960s, but have been present in the Minnesota portion of Lake of the Woods only since 2006. At this point Rusty Crayfish are present in fairly low densities but are continuing to expand south. Last fall they were found from the Northwest Angle, south to Pine Island in addition to the Rainy River. Densities of Rusty Crayfish decline substantially from the Northwest Angle south. Rusty Crayfish have displaced the native crayfish within 2 years of colonizing an area and have been associated with declines in aquatic vegetation when they become established. <br> \n</p>",

The 1983 and 1987 year classes are good and the 1991 year class appears to be exceptionally large.  Of the 1,161 Walleye sampled this fall, about 550 into the size range that can be expected for yearlings.  This abundant year class is responsible for about half of the Walleye sampled.  Sauger appear less stable than the Walleye.  A series of poor year classes has reduced the abundance of large Sauger, though the 1989 and 1990 year classes appear strong.  Approximately 75% of the Sauger sample is from these year classes. Initial indications are for a poor 1991 year class.  Sauger harvest will be dependent on the 1989 and 1990 year classes for the next few years. Northern Pike are present with a variety of size groups present, including some very high quality individuals.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Walleye <br> \n <br> \nThe early spring in 2012 resulted in a walleye spawning run on the Rainy River which was 10 to 14 days earlier than normal.  Spring electrofishing was conducted from April 12 through 14.  Overall walleye catch rates were 159 walleye per hour.  Female walleye comprised 37% of the sample. This is the smallest percentage of female walleye in the sample since annual electrofishing began in 1991.  The mean length of female walleye has been stable for the past several years, with a mean of 25.5 inches.  Fifty-one percent of females ranged in length from 25.6 to 31.5 inches. <br> \n <br> \nThe walleye population is in good shape, with at least 15 age classes represented annually.  A fish population, such as Lake of the Woods walleye, with a variety of age classes present is a healthy fish population. Walleye from age-0 through age-18 were sampled in 2012.  Of the six age-18 walleye sampled, two were males, with an average length of 23 inches, and four were female, with an average length of 28.4 inches.  The largest walleye sampled was 30.0 inches long, and a relatively young 16 years old.  A high proportion of the walleye sample (47%) was of age-1 individuals.  Past experience suggests that a catch rate of age-1 individuals in this range predicts a strong year class. <br> \n <br> \nLong-term mean abundance (1968-2012) is 14.8 walleye per gill net lift.  The 2012 abundance was 18.9 per lift, above the long-term mean, but within the range of normal abundances. <br> \n <br> \nYear class strength is indexed on the catch rates of a year class from age-2 through age-5, from fall gill net assessment.  Year class strength is correlated to the abundance of age-0 walleye, as measured in Young-of-Year assessment trawling, and the length that age-0 walleye achieve by August 15 of the hatch year, so the strength of year classes can be predicted.  Based on data collected during the summers of 2011 and 2012, the 2011 and 2012 walleye year classes are both expected to be strong, and of moderate strength, respectively. <br> \n <br> \nSauger <br> \n <br> \nSauger abundance is currently high, but is coming down from the very high abundance measured in 2009.  Abundance has declined due to the passing through of the very strong series of year classes produced from 2005 through 2007.  Of particular note is the 2006 year class.  The 2006 year class is the strongest sauger year class measured since fall gill net assessment became an annual survey in 1981.  Sauger from the 2006 year class comprised about 31% of the entire sauger sample, and had an average length of 14.5 inches. <br> \n <br> \nSauger year class strength can also be predicted from data collected during YOY percid assessment.  In the case of sauger, year class strength is related to the abundance of age-0 sauger, as measured through August trawling.  Based on data collected during the summers of 2011 and 2012, the 2011 and 2012 sauger year classes are predicted to be of moderate and weak strength, respectively. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike are not sampled very effectively with standard lake assessment gill nets.  From the 1968 to 2009 fall gill net assessments, northern pike CPUE ranged from 0.8 to 2.7 with a 10-year mean of 1.6.  The problem of small sample size has been addressed with a spring survey, using trap nets.  Spring spawning run trap net assessment depicts a very high quality northern pike population. <br> \n <br> \nIn 1995 the spawning run assessment was expanded to a tagging study, and 1,500 northern pike were to be tagged.  The primary purpose of this study was to determine whether northern pike using streams in Minnesota as spawning sites were exclusively Minnesota stocks, or if the stocks were shared with the provinces of Manitoba and/or Ontario.  In 1995, 15% of 1,432 tagged pike exceeded 30 inches.  Approximately 2% of tagged northern pike exceeded 40 inches.  Tag return data suggest that the northern pike that spawn in Rainy River tributary streams spend their time in the Rainy River and are a distinct stock from the pike that spawn in Lake of the Woods tributaries.  Rainy River tributary streams, as a group, have significantly smaller mean lengths than any of the other sites at which northern pike were tagged.  Zippel Bay and the Warroad River stood out as sites from which a high proportion of tags were returned.  These are areas that have relatively high targeted northern pike angling effort.  Based on tag returns, northern pike exploitation estimates range from 5.3-7% (depending on whether 30% or 40% of tags are reported) and survival is estimated at 66%.  <br> \n <br> \nOverall, 19% of the 716 northern pike sampled in 2011 exceeded 35 inches, and 5% exceeded 40 inches.   Spring northern pike assessment is currently scheduled to take place on a five-year rotation.  It was anticipated that all sites would be sampled in a single year, but this was not possible in 2011.  The sites which could not be sampled were scheduled to be sampled in 2012.  Unfortunately, with the lack of runoff, and the unusually early spring, it was decided to forego sampling northern pike in 2012 because it was likely that the data collected would not be comparable to other years. <br> \n <br> \nInfested Waters Designation <br> \n <br> \nLake of the Woods and the Rainy River have received an infested waters designation due to the presence of spiny water flea (Bythotrephes longimanus).  Spiny water flea has been documented in Lake of the Woods, Rainy River and Rainy Lake.  The impact of spiny water flea on the food chain and fish populations of Lake of the Woods is still open to speculation.  Zooplankton sampling has been initiated to document changes in the zooplankton community of Lake of the Woods.  Two sites are sampled every other week from mid-June through August.  Nine meter vertical tows are made with a 150 micron, 30 cm diameter plankton net. <br> \n <br> \nAt this point, the most immediate impact of spiny water flea has been to human users of the lake and river.  Emerald shiner is a popular bait fish on Lake of the Woods.  Local bait shops and resorts have had significant businesses harvesting bait within the system.  There is concern that spiny water flea eggs may be ingested by small fish, and that spiny water flea may then be spread through the bait fish distribution.  To deal with this potential issue, a prohibition against bait collection, by non-licensed individuals, has been enacted.  Trained and licensed bait dealers may still collect bait fish from infested waters, but the collected bait must be handled to allow the fish to purge any eggs they may have ingested. <br> \n <br> \nRusty crayfish (Orconectes rusticus), a crayfish native to the Ohio River system, were documented in the Minnesota portion of Lake of the Woods in September 2006.  At this point rusty crayfish appear to be present in fairly low densities, and only as far south as Driftwood Point, just south-west of Garden Island.  Rusty crayfish have been established in parts of the Ontario portion of Lake of the Woods since the late 1960s. <br> \n <br> \nRegulations <br> \n <br> \nCurrent walleye and sauger harvest regulations were enacted on December 1, 2004.  The regulations were enacted to reduce the five-year average walleye and sauger harvest to the target harvest of 450,000 pounds for walleye and 250,000 pounds for sauger.  The regulations vary by time of year, location on the lake, and between Lake of the Woods and the Rainy River. <br> \n <br> \nLake of the Woods, from December 1 through April 14, the walleye/sauger aggregate limit is eight (not more than four can be walleye). Walleye from 19.5 to 28 inches must be immediately released. Only one walleye over 28 inches total length can be possessed. <br> \n <br> \nLake of the Woods, from walleye opener through November 30, the walleye/sauger aggregate limit is six (not more than four can be walleye). Walleye from 19.5 to 28 inches must be immediately released. Only one walleye over 28 inches total length can be possessed. <br> \n <br> \nFour Mile Bay of Lake of the Woods, from March 1 through April 14, the walleye/sauger aggregate limit is two (no walleye over 19.5 inches). <br> \n <br> \nRainy River from walleye opener through February, the walleye/sauger aggregate limit is six (not more than four can be walleye). Walleye from 19.5 to 28 inches must be immediately released. Only one walleye over 28 inches total length can be possessed. <br> \n <br> \nRainy River from March 1 through April 14, the walleye/sauger aggregate limit is two (no walleye over 19.5 inches). <br> \n <br> \nTo protect the high quality size structure of the northern pike population, a special northern pike regulation package was adopted with the opening of the fishing season in 2006.  The regulation protects northern pike from 30 through 40 inches.  Possession is 3 northern pike, of which only one can exceed 40 inches.  The open season is continuous.  This regulation went through a 10-year (1996 through 2005) experimental evaluation period prior to being adopted as a special regulation. <br> \n <br> \nFishing for lake sturgeon is a unique opportunity in the Lake of the Woods-Rainy River system.  The lake sturgeon population is still recovering from a period of low abundance caused by over harvest and pollution.  During the recovery phase we have to be conservative with the number and pounds of sturgeon harvested to ensure that the population fully recovers to a healthy size structure and level of abundance.  Anglers may harvest one lake sturgeon per year.  A sturgeon must be between 45 and 50 inches (inclusive) or longer than 75 inches to be legal to harvest.  All other sturgeon must be immediately released.  The lake sturgeon harvest season is from April 24 to May 7, and from July 1 to September 30.  The catch and release only season is from May 8 to May 15, and from October 1 through April 23.  You may not fish for lake sturgeon during the closed season (May 16 to June 30). <br> \n <br> \nStarting in 2006, anglers wishing to harvest a lake sturgeon have had to purchase a lake sturgeon harvest tag.  The tag is available through the electronic licensing system (any license issuing agent) and costs $5.00.  Upon harvesting a sturgeon, the harvesting angler must notch the appropriate areas of the tag indicating the date and time of harvest, then the tag must be attached to the sturgeon. Within 48 hours a registration card must be completed by the harvesting angler and mailed in.  Anglers do not need a harvest tag to catch and release lake sturgeon, a harvest tag is needed only if they intend to harvest one. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Anglers fish the Minnesota portion of Lake of the Woods for a variety of species, including Walleye, Sauger, Yellow Perch, Northern Pike and Lake Sturgeon.  Due to the importance of Walleye and Sauger, a great deal of population monitoring effort is focused on them.  Overviews of the sampling programs conducted on Lake of the Woods are located on the Baudette Area Fisheries web page, on the MN-DNR web site, at www.mndnr.gov/areas/fisheries/baudette. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye and Sauger <br> \n <br> \nThe primary assessment used to monitor Walleye and Sauger populations is fall gill net assessment.  This assessment has been annual since 1981, but a comparable assessment was conducted from 1968 through 1970.  From 1968 through 2001, the fall gill net assessment sampled the near-shore waters of Lake of the Woods, from 6 to 25 feet in depth.  In 2002 off-shore nets were added to the assessment. The off-shore nets sample water from 32 to 35 feet deep.  There are differences in the size structure and abundance of Walleye and Sauger in the near-shore and off-shore samples.  Though the samples are combined in the data portion of this report, they are discussed separately in this narrative. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye.  Walleye catches in the 2017 near-shore gill net sample averaged 18.3 Walleye per gill net, which just well above the 1968-2016 average of 15.4. Walleye were also abundant in the off-shore portions of the lake, with 17.6 Walleye per gill net, which is well above the 2002 to 2016 average of 16.9.  When the near-shore and off-shore samples are combined, Walleye are less abundant than they were last year.  The 2013 and 2014 year classes are both strong, and the 2016 and 2017 year classes are predicted to be of average strength.  When this is combined with only a single weak year class (2008) in the past 10 years, the result is an abundant Walleye population. <br> \n <br> \nSmall Walleye, from 7 to 12 inches long, are abundant.  Harvestable-sized Walleye are also abundant, with individuals from 13 to 18 inches being well represented. <br> \n <br> \nSauger.  The highest Sauger abundance measured in the fall gill net assessment was in 2009, when we found 30.8 Sauger per lift.  This high abundance was driven by young Sauger from the strong year classes produced from 2005 through 2007, and there were relatively few keepers available.  As these Sauger have grown older, overall abundance has declined, but a high quality size structure has developed.  <br> \n <br> \nOverall abundance increased to the highest level since 2011, driven by strong 2014 and 2015 year classes.  These Sauger won't be large enough for most anglers to consider them to be keepers until the winter of 2018-19.  Additionally, individuals from 7 to 10 inches long were also common.  These small Sauger predict a good future for the Sauger population.  Of interest to anglers is that Sauger from 12 to 15 inches were relatively abundant, and individuals to 18 inches long were sampled.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike <br> \n <br> \nLake of the Woods is managed for a high-quality Northern Pike population, with a significant component of \"trophy\" Northern Pike over 40 inches long.  To monitor the size structure of the Northern Pike population, it is sampled every 5 years using trap nets at known spawning sites.   <br> \n <br> \nTwo spawning sites were sampled in the spring of 2017.  Samples collected in the spring of 2017 show that the percentage of Northern Pike longer than 40 inches has remained stable at 8 to 13% of the females that were sampled. Mid-sized Northern Pike are categorized as fish 30 to 40 inches. Percentage of mid-sized Northern Pike at both sites sampled in 2017 also have remained stable since the mid-2000s. <br> \n <br> \nLake Sturgeon <br> \n <br> \nThe third population estimate for Lake Sturgeon since 1990 was completed in 2014.  Previous estimates for Lake Sturgeon (40-inches and longer) were 16,000 (1990) and 59,000 (2004).  In 2014 we estimate that there were 92,000 Lake Sturgeon of 40-inches and longer in the Lake of the Woods-Rainy River system.  Along with the increase in abundance, we also found that the number of \"large\" sturgeon increased.  The largest sturgeon we sampled was 72-inches long, and had an estimated weight of 104 pounds. <br> \nFishing for Lake Sturgeon is a unique opportunity in the Lake of the Woods-Rainy River system.  The Lake Sturgeon population is still recovering from a period of low abundance caused by over harvest and pollution.  During the recovery phase we have to be conservative with the number and pounds of sturgeon harvested to ensure that the population fully recovers to a healthy size structure and level of abundance.  In order to harvest a Lake Sturgeon, anglers must purchase a harvest tag.  However no tag is required to fish catch-and-release for Lake Sturgeon.  Anglers may harvest one Lake Sturgeon per year.  A sturgeon must be between 45 and 50 inches (inclusive) or longer than 75 inches to be legal to harvest.  All other sturgeon must be immediately released.  The Lake Sturgeon harvest season is from April 24 to May 7, and from July 1 to September 30.  The catch and release only season is from May 8 to May 15, and from October 1 through April 23.  You may not fish for Lake Sturgeon during the closed season (May 16 to June 30). <br> \n <br> \nInfested Waters Designation <br> \n <br> \nLake of the Woods and the Rainy River have received an infested waters designation due to the presence of Spiny Water Flea (Bythotrephes longimanus).  Spiny Water Flea has been documented in Lake of the Woods, Rainy River and Rainy Lake.  The impact of Spiny Water Flea on the food chain and fish populations of Lake of the Woods is still open to speculation.  <br> \n <br> \nZooplankton sampling has been initiated to document changes in the zooplankton community Thirty-foot vertical tows are made with an 80 micron, 30 cm diameter plankton net. <br> \n <br> \nAt this date, the most immediate impact of Spiny Water Flea has been to human users of the lake and river.  Emerald shiner is a popular bait fish on Lake of the Woods.  Local bait shops and resorts have had significant businesses harvesting bait within the system.  There is concern that Spiny Water Flea eggs may be ingested by small fish, and that Spiny Water Flea may then be spread through the bait fish distribution.  To deal with this potential issue, a prohibition against bait collection, by non-licensed individuals, has been enacted.  Trained and licensed bait dealers may still collect bait fish from infested waters, but the collected bait must be handled to allow the fish to purge any eggs they may have ingested. <br> \n <br> \nRusty Crayfish, a native of the Ohio River system, have been established in parts of the Ontario portion of Lake of the Woods since the late 1960s, but have been present in the Minnesota portion of Lake of the Woods only since 2006.  At this point Rusty Crayfish are present in fairly low densities, but are continuing to expand south.  Last fall they were found from the Northwest Angle, south to Willow Creek (south eastern portion of Muskeg Bay, and then north-east to approximately 7 miles out from Pine Island.  Rusty Crayfish have displaced the native crayfish within 2 years of colonizing an area, and have been associated with declines in aquatic vegetation when they become established. <br> \n</p>",

Cisco catch per unit effort is the highest level recorded since the large lake monitoring program began. The increase in abundance is probably attributable to a strong year class recruiting to the gillnets. White sucker, Yellow Perch, and Saugers are slightly more abundant than in 1988. In 1989, Walleye numbers continued to increase from 1988 and 1987 netting totals, as a strong year class appeared in the catch. Walleye 16 inches or larger totaled 27.5% of the catch, a decrease from 38% in 1988. Mean percent of Walleye 16 inches or larger is 21.3% and 7.3% of the catch in years 1980-85 and 1968-70 respectively.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake of the Woods is a border water with an aggregate limit of walleye and sauger of 14, of which no more than 6 may be walleye.  The season for walleye and sauger extends from the statewide fishing opener, through the following April 14.  A one walleye over 19.5\" regulation is in effect, to be consistent with a pre-existing Province of Ontario regulation.  To protect the high quality size structure of the northern pike population, an experimental regulation package was enacted in the spring of 1996.  The regulation reduced the possession limit of northern pike from 3 to 6, only one of which may be longer than 40\".  There is also a protected slot from 30 through 40 inches.  The regulatio applies to Lake of the Woods, the Rainy River, the Warroad River, Baudette River, and the Winter Road River.  The northern pike season remains continuous.  This experimental regulation will be evaluated after 10 years (2006) and will be considered successful if angler pressure continues to increase and the size structure of the pike population remains one of high quality.A new proposed regulation which will be brought to the public in late November meeting is a reduction of the walleye/sauger limit on the Rainy River.  The proposal is to reduce the limit from six to two, and would affect the Rainy river, from Wheeler's Point to International Falls.  The limit reduction would be in effect from March 1 through April 14.  The maximum size limit of 19.5 inches would remain in place.  The large number of anglers participating in this fishery are over whelming available facilities and are causing congestion problems around access sites.  The limit reduction is being proposed to reduce walleye harvest, during years when environmental conditions are such that high walleye harvests are possible, and to reduce the high numbr of anglers participating in this popular spring fishery.  This proposed limit reduction is the product of a task force comprised of local residents, bussiness owners, county officers, and MN-DNR representatives.The walleye p[opulation is in very good shape with about 15 age groups represented annually.  Walleye from the very strong 1991 year class are still well represented in the fall gill net assessment and in the sport fishery.  Walleye from the 1991 year class average about 18 inches (males) and 20 inches(females) in length.  The 1992 and 1993 year classes are weak.  This weakness is manifested as a dip in the fall gill net sample length frequency centered on the 16 inch interval.  The 1994 year class is of average strength.  Basewd on YOY assessment, year classes produced in 1995 and 1997 are projected to be moderate and very strong, respectively.  Due to poor growth in the summer of 1996, the 1996 year class is proijected to be virtually non-existent.  Despite this projection, the 1996 walleye year class (most of these walleye were in the 8-9 inch range) were relatively well represented in the gill net sample.The sauger population is characterized by highly variable recruitment.  The 1994 year class is of average strength, and comprises 20-30% of the sauger sample.  The 1995 year class is weak and may comprise about 10% of the sample.  The 1996 year class is about 20% of the sample, with a CPUE of approximately 1.  For comparison, the 196 year class had an age-1 CPUE of 3.0.  It is likely that the 1996 year class is weak.An analysis that investigated the relationship between a number of variables and sauger year class strength showed that the two most important variables were the abundance of age-0 sauger and walleye abundance.  The abundance of age-0 sauger, measured by August trawling, was posatively correlated with year class strength and accounted for 77% of the variation around year class strength.  Walleye abundance, measured in fall gill net assessment, accounted for 13% of the variability around sauger year class strength.  It is estimated that the 1997 year class of sauger will be very strong, based on the high catch CPUE of age-0 sauger in August trawling and the relatively low abundance of walleye in the fall gill net assessment.Northern pike are not sampled very effectively with standard lake assessment gill nets.  In the 1983 to 1994 fall gill net assessment, northern pike CPUE has ranged from 0.8 to 2.7 with a 10 year mean of 1.5.  The problem of small sample size has been addressed with a spring survey, using trap nets.  Spring, trap net, spawning run assessment depicts a very high quality northern pike populatin.  In 1995 the spawning run assessment was expanded to tag up to 1,500 northern pike.  The primary purpose of this study was to determine if the population of northern pike using streams in minnesota as spawning sites were and exclusively Minnesota stock, or if the stock is shared with the Province of Manitoba and/or Ontario.  In 199515% of the 1,432 tagged pike exceeded 750 mm (~30 inches.  Approximately 2% of tagged northern pike exceed 1,000 mm (~40 inches).  Preliminary tag return data suggest that the northern pike that spawn in the Rainy River tributary streams spend their time in the Rainy river and are a distinct stock from the pike that spawn in Lake of the Woods tributaries.  Rainy River tributary streams, as a group, have significantly smaller mean lengths than any of the other sites at which northern pike were tagged.  Zippel Bay and Warroad River stood out as sites from which a lot of tags were returned.  These are areas that have a relatively high proportion of targeted northern pike effort.Preliminary data from the summer creel survey are available.  This past summer was one of excellent walleye fishing succes on lake of the Woods.  The total targetted CPUE (number of walleye per angler hour) for walleye was 0.46.  The targeted CPUE for harvested walleye was 0.30, with a mean length of 15.3 inches (1.6 pounds).  The walleye harvest on the Minnesota waters of Lake of the Woods was 376,000 pounds, with a pressure of 798,000 angler hours.  To put the summer fishery into perspective, the harvest rate for walleye was the third highest estimated in the past 10 years, harvest (pounds) was the third highest since 1981, and angling pressure was the fifth highest since 1981.About 38,000 pounds of sauger were harvested during the summer of 1997.  The average sauger was 13.4 inches long, for a mean weight of 0.8 pounds.  The sauger harvest was more than two times higher than in 1996, but was very similar to harvests estimated from 1991 through 1995.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Present Fish Population Status:  The walleye population is in very good shape with about 15 age groups represented annually in fall gill net assessment.  Two age-16 walleye were sampled in 1999 fall gill net assessment.  The mean total length of 1991 year class walleye (sexes combined) exceeds 20 inches, but comprised 2% of the experimental mesh gill net sample.  The majority of the 1991 year class have outgrown this gear.  Fifty percent of the walleye sampled in the supplementary large mesh (5 inch stretch measure) were of the 1991 year class.  The 1991 walleye year class remains the strongest measured on Lake of the Woods.  The 1992 and 1993 year classes are weak, but from 1994 through 1996 no weak year classes have been measured.  Additionally, the 1997 through 1999 year classes are projected to be of average strength.  The walleye CPUE from fall assessment netting is the second highest observed since 1990.  In 1992 (when the 1991 year class was age-1) the walleye CPUE was higher in fall assessment netting.  However, in 1992 the 1991 year class comprised about 46% of the sample.  In 1999 sampling, the modal age for walleye was age-2, accounting for 36% of the sample.  The 1999 walleye sample has a greater variety of year classes than the 1992 sample.The sauger population is characterized by highly variable recruitment.  Strong year classes were produced in 1989 and 1990.  Weak year classes were produced from 1991 and 1992.  The 1993 and 1994 year-classes are of average strength.  Sauger from these year-classes averaged just over 14 inches long in fall assessment netting.  The 1995 year class is weak.  The 1996 year class is of average strength (mean length of 12 inches in fall netting), but the 1997 year class is projected to be very strong.  Sauger in the 1997 year-class averaged about 10 inches long in the fall gill net assessment sample.  These sauger comprised 50% of the sample.  These sauger will fully recruit to the fishery in the winter of 2000-2001.  The 1998 year class is projected to be strong, while the 1999 year class should be quite weak.  Sauger recruitment appears to be driven by the abundance of age-0 sauger, as measured by August trawling, and walleye abundance, as measured by fall assessment netting.  Despite that age-0 sauger were fairly abundant in August, it is likely that the very strong walleye population will reduce the strength of this year class.Northern pike are not sampled very effectively with standard lake assessment gill nets.  In the 1983 to 1994 fall gill net assessment, northern pike CPUE has ranged from 0.8 to 2.7 with a 10 year mean of 1.5.  The problem of small sample size has been addressed with a spring survey, using trap nets.  Spring spawning run trap net assessment depicts a very high quality northern pike population.  In 1995 the spawning run assessment was expanded to a tagging study, and  1,500 northern pike were tagged.  The primary purpose of this study was to determine whether northern pike using streams in Minnesota as spawning sites were exclusively Minnesota stocks, or if the stocks were shared with the provinces of Manitoba and/or Ontario.  In 1995, 15% of 1,432 tagged pike exceeded 750 mm (~30 inches).  Approximately 2% of tagged northern pike exceed 1,000 mm (~40 inches).  Preliminary tag return data suggest that the northern pike that spawn in Rainy River tributary streams spend their time in the Rainy River and are a distinct stock from the pike that spawn in Lake of the Woods tributaries.  Rainy River tributary streams, as a group, have significantly smaller mean lengths than any of the other sites at which northern pike are tagged.  Zippel Bay and the Warroad River stood out as sites from which a lot of tags were returned.  These are areas that have a relatively high proportion of targeted northern pike effort.  Based on tag returns, northern pike exploitation estimates range from 5.3-7% (depending on whether 30% or 40% of tags are reported) and survival is estimated at 66%.Data from the annual summer creel survey are available.  This past summer was, once again, one of excellent walleye fishing success on Lake of the Woods.  The total targeted CPUE (number of walleye per angler hour) for walleye was 0.53.  The targeted CPUE for harvested walleye was 0.32, with a modal length (17% of harvested walleye) in the 15 inch interval, over 1 lbs.  The harvest of walleye on the Minnesota waters of Lake of the Woods was 285,000 pounds, from a pressure of 620,000 angler hours.About 30,400 pounds of sauger were harvested during the summer of 1998.  This level of harvest is slightly lower than the 1994 to 1998 mean of 33,258 pounds.  The modal length of harvested sauger was in the 13 inch interval.  The non-targeted harvest rate of sauger was 0.05, with an overall non-targeted catch rate of 0.08.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>The walleye population is in very good shape with about 15 age groups represented annually.  The oldest walleye sampled in the 2003 fall gill net assessment was a 20 year-old, 600 mm long male. The 1991 year class walleye are no longer a component of the experimental gill net sample.  The 1991 year class walleye have outgrown the experimental gill net, but several individuals were sampled in the supplementary large mesh gill net.  From 1984 to 2000 the 1991 walleye year class had been the strongest measured on Lake of the Woods.  The 1999 and 2001 year classes appear to be stronger (strength has not yet been indexed for four years) than the 1991 year class, and the 2003 year class is predicted to be stronger than the 1991 year class as well.  Year class strength of walleye can be predicted with a high degree of confidence (r2=0.89) based on information collected during YOY percid assessment, conducted during July and August.  The variables used to predict walleye year class strength are the length that YOY walleye achieve by August 15 and the age-0 walleye CPUE from August trawling.  Length, CPUE and year class strength are positively correlated.  The length YOY walleye achieved by August 15 length and their trawl CPUE suggest that the 2002 walleye year class will be weak, and that the 2003 year class will be very strong.Overall the walleye population is in very good shape.  Abundance (21.4 walleye per lift), measured in fall gill net assessment, was similar to 2001 and remained above the 10-year mean abundance of 14.8.  The relatively high abundance of the walleye population is due to recruitment of the very strong 2001 year class to the sample and the continued presence of walleye from moderate and strong year classes produced from 1995 through 1999.The sauger population has been characterized by highly variable recruitment.  From 1991 through 1996 three weak year classes, but no strong year classes, were produced.  Since 1996 sauger recruitment has been much stronger.  Strong year classes were produced in 1997, 1999 and 2001, and the 1998 and 2000 year classes are of moderate strength.  The result of the improved recruitment is that sauger abundance has increased form a low of 5.4 sauger per lift, in 1997, to 20.1 sauger per lift, in 2002, but declined to 12.3 per lift in 2003, as measured in fall gill net assessment.Sauger year class strength can be predicted using YOY sauger and YOY yellow perch abundance, both measured by August trawling (r2=0.86).  Young of year sauger abundance and YOY yellow perch abundance are both positively correlated with year class strength.  The 2002 sauger year class is predicted to be moderate to weak, while the 2003 year class is predicted to be moderate to strong.Northern pike are not sampled very effectively with standard lake assessment gill nets.  In the 1993 to 2002 fall gill net assessment, northern pike CPUE has ranged from 0.8 to 2.2 with a 10 year mean of 1.7.  The problem of small sample size has been addressed with a spring survey, using trap nets.  Spring spawning run trap net assessment depicts a very high quality northern pike population.  In 1995 the spawning run assessment was expanded to a tagging study, and 1,500 northern pike were tagged.  The primary purpose of this study was to determine whether northern pike using streams in Minnesota as spawning sites were exclusively Minnesota stocks, or if the stocks were shared with the provinces of Manitoba and/or Ontario.  In 1995, 15% of 1,432 tagged pike exceeded 750 mm (~30 inches).  Approximately 2% of tagged northern pike exceed 1,000 mm (~40 inches).

Rainy River tributary streams, as a group, have significantly smaller mean lengths than any of the other sites at which northern pike are tagged.  Zippel Bay and the Warroad River stood out as sites from which a lot of tags were returned.  These are areas that have a relatively high proportion of targeted northern pike effort.  Based on tag returns, northern pike exploitation estimates range from 5.3-7% (depending on whether 30% or 40% of tags are reported) and survival is estimated at 66%. Data from the summer 2003 creel surveys are available.  The half-month period with the highest pressure was June 1-15 with 201,008 angler hours.  This was followed by May with 188,047 angler hours.  The half-month period with the lowest pressure was September 16-30, with 3,668 angler hours.  Total pressure for the Minnesota waters of Lake of the Woods was 809,944 angler hours.  Thirteen percent (101,361 angler hours) of the pressure was by anglers using fishing boats, 65% (526,942 angler hours) by anglers fishing out of pleasure boats, and the remaining 22% (181,642 angler hours) of the pressure was by anglers fishing out of resort based, guided, launches.  For the ten-year period from 1994 through 2003, south shore and Rainy River based summer angling pressure on the Minnesota portion of Lake of the Woods increased at an annual rate of 0.8%.  Winter angler pressure (winter of 2002-2003) was the highest ever estimated for the Minnesota portion of Lake of the Woods at over 1.5 million angler hours.Summer walleye harvest was lower than what anglers have come to expect from Lake of the Woods.  Despite a pressure estimate being almost 20% higher than in 2002 the walleye pounds harvested were essentially the same as the previous year.  The very high winter (2002-2003) pressure resulted in the highest winter walleye harvest estimate to date, at 402,464 pounds.  The five-year mean total walleye harvest (all creel surveys combined) rose to 596,015 pounds, well above the target harvest of 450,000 pounds.  This high harvest has occurred during a time of relatively high walleye abundance.  The most sensitive indicator of excessive harvest on a walleye population is the loss of the larger older individuals from the population.  The presence of these individuals is monitored through the Spring Spawning Run Electrofishing assessment at the Long Sault Rapids, near Birchdale.   About 58,000 pounds of sauger were harvested during the summer of 2003.  Winter continues to be the time period where the majority of sauger are harvested.  Eighty-two percent of all sauger harvested from the Minnesota waters of Lake of the Woods are harvested through the ice fishery based on the South Shore of Lake of the Woods.  The very high angler pressure exerted on the Minnesota portion of Lake of the Woods last winter (2002-2003) resulted in the harvest of 283,552 pounds of sauger. The five-year mean sauger harvest is 225,883 pounds.  The sauger target harvest has been set at 250,000 pounds during the recent Border Waters Atlas revision.Current data suggest that the walleye and sauger populations remain in a healthy condition.  However, continued harvest at current levels would likely impact the health of these populations.  While summer angling pressure has remained relatively stable since 1990, winter pressure has increased steadily through the same period, and dramatically the past two winters.  In order to preserve the health and quality of the walleye population new, more restrictive, regulations are being proposed for Lake of the Woods and the Rainy River.  Public input meetings regarding these proposals will be held in Baudette, Roseau, International Falls and St. Paul this fall.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>September gill netting in 2007 found average numbers of walleye, but high sauger abundance.\n\nOverall walleye abundance remains essentially unchanged from the previous two years, and is slightly below the 10-year average abundance.  For walleye, the 2003 year class stands out, with most individuals between 11 and 13 inches in length.  Individuals from the very strong 2001 year class range in length from 14 to 18 inches.  These two year classes will support the bulk of the walleye harvest for the next few years.  Based on summer sampling, the 2007 walleye year class is expected to be of moderate strength.\n\n\nSauger abundance is the highest measured for quite some time.  The driving force behind this high level of sauger abundance is the very strong 2006 year class.  These fish averaged about 7.5 inches long during the September sampling, and comprised about one half of the sauger sample.  Sauger from the 2006 year class will be most noticed by anglers this winter as they are of \"bait-stealer\" size.  The abundance of keeper-size sauger remains esentially unchanged from the past several years.  Based on summer sampling, the 2007 sauger year class is predicted to be of moderate strength.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Physical Description  <br> \n <br> \nLake of the Woods straddles the Canada-United States border, and is shared between the Canadian provinces of Manitoba and Ontario, and the U. S. state of Minnesota.  Water level is directly controlled through three hydroelectric dams located at the head of the Winnipeg River in Kenora, Ontario. The Rainy River provides 75% of the inflow to the lake.  <br> \n <br> \nThe lake is comprised of several distinct basins.  The Minnesota portion of Lake of the Woods (just over 300,000 acres) lies within Muskeg Bay, Big Traverse Bay and Little Traverse Bay.  Big Traverse Bay and Muskeg Bay are largely devoid of bottom structure and islands.  Little Traverse Bay is more characteristic of the Ontario portion of Lake of the Woods, with numerous islands and reefs.  These three basins do not stratify and in most years have widespread, dense, blue-green algae blooms that are first evident in July and continue through October. <br> \n <br> \nFisheries Management and Regulations <br> \n <br> \nIn December of 2017, DNR Fisheries in Baudette began a management plan review/revision for Lake of the Woods. Stated within the fisheries management plan is a brief background of management history, series of management goals and objectives and management actions. The plan is effective for five years and goals/objectives will be reevaluated in 2023. New to the process this year, we incorporated a Fisheries Input Group (FIG) to provide perspectives and angler expectations. The FIG included 14 individuals from various parts of the state and representing different interests. In the end, a revised management plan was produced that went out for public input. The final plan can be found at: https://files.dnr.state.mn.us/fisheries/largelakes/low/low_plan.pdf <br> \n <br> \nFrom 2012-2016, average annual harvest continued to exceed target harvests for both Walleye and Sauger. Additionally, concern over expanding fishing pressure documented during the winter fishery on Lake of the Woods and spring Rainy River, led to current fishing regulations. On March 1st 2019, aggregate bag limit for Walleye and Sauger was reduced from 8 to 6 during the winter season and from 2 Walleye and Sauger to catch and release only on the Rainy River (including Four Mile Bay) from March 1st to April 14th.  <br> \n <br> \nThe largest and most important lakes in Minnesota are sampled every year, in order to closely monitor their fish populations.  Lake of the Woods is one of the large lakes included in this Large Lake Sampling Program.  These lakes are at least 15,000 acres in size, and typically support the best Walleye fisheries in the state. Anglers fish the Minnesota portion of Lake of the Woods for a variety of species, including Walleye, Sauger, Yellow Perch, Northern Pike and Lake Sturgeon.  Due to the importance of Walleye and Sauger, a great deal of population monitoring effort is focused on them.  Overviews of the sampling programs conducted on Lake of the Woods are located on the Baudette Area Fisheries web page, on the MN-DNR web site, at www.mndnr.gov/areas/fisheries/baudette. <br> \n <br> \nThe primary assessment used to monitor fish populations is fall gill net assessment.  This assessment has been annual since 1981, but a comparable assessment was conducted from 1968 through 1970.  From 1968 through 2001, the fall gill net assessment sampled the near-shore waters of Lake of the Woods, from 6 to 25 feet in depth.  In 2002 off-shore nets were added to the assessment. The off-shore nets sample water from 32 to 35 feet deep.  There are differences in the size structure and abundance of fish species in the near-shore and off-shore samples.   <br> \n <br> \nWalleye <br> \n <br> \nSince 2002 the average Walleye catch rate or catch per unit effort (CPUE) is 16.8 fish/net (both near and off-shore nets combined). The 2018 CPUE was 15.3 fish/net and down from 2017 (18.2 fish/net), but exceeded the 2018-2023 management goal ~ 14 fish/net. Gill net sampled Walleye ranged in length from 5.2 to 30.5 inches with an average length of 13.2 inches. Several small Walleye (7 to 8 inches) were sampled during the fall gill net assessment; that coupled with above average growth and abundance is an indication of a strong year-class produced in 2018.  In addition, keeper-sized Walleye were at or exceeded historic levels. Walleye 9 to 11 inches were below historic levels and is the result of the 2016 and 2017 year-classes being of moderate strength. Lastly, the 2018-2023 fisheries management plan calls for the annual percentage of gill net sampled Walleye over 20 inches to be 5 to 15%  of the total catch. In 2018, just over 10% the Walleye sampled were 20 inches or larger.  <br> \n <br> \nSauger <br> \n <br> \nIn 2018 Sauger gill net CPUE was 26 fish/net and exceeds the 2018-2023 management goal of ~ 16 fish/net. Above average Sauger abundance experienced the past few years is the result of strong year-classes being produced in 2011 and from 2014-2016. Year-classes produced in 2017 and 2018 are predicted to be moderate to weak. Sauger sampled in 2018 ranged in length from 6.5 to 19.25 inches with an average length of 11.5 inches. Sauger from 7 to 17 inches are at or exceed historic levels.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike <br> \n <br> \nLake of the Woods is managed for a high-quality Northern Pike population, with a significant component of \"trophy\" Northern Pike over 40 inches long.  To monitor the size structure of the Northern Pike population, it is sampled every 5 years using trap nets at known spawning sites. Trap netting conducted in 2016 and 2017 revealed a high-quality size structure for all sampled tributaries to Lake of the Woods and Rainy River. Fall gill netting in 2018 sampled Northern Pike from 17.5 to 44 inches with an average length of 28 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch are often not targeted by anglers fishing Lake of the Woods, but caught incidentally fishing for Walleye and Sauger.  Under the current fisheries management plan for 2018-2023 no population level goals are set for Yellow Perch but are of management interest. Results from 2018 indicate perch near-shore abundance is above the 10-year average marking the third year in row. Perch ranged in length from 5 to nearly 14 inches with an average length of 9 inches and likely from the 2015 year-class. <br> \n <br> \nLake Sturgeon <br> \n <br> \nSince 2004 spawning Lake Sturgeon are sampled annually on the Rapid River (a tributary to the Rainy River). Over the past 14 years there has been an overall increase in mean length and greater proportion of \"large\" sturgeon in the sampled population. In addition to obtaining lengths, sampled Lake Sturgeon were tagged with a unique number at the base of the dorsal fin. This information has revealed that males typically spawn every 2 to 3 years (in some cases annually) and females spawn every 4 to 9 years. In total nearly 2,000 fish have been tagged at the Rapid River and over 9,000 have been tagged system-wide since the inception of the tagging program. In addition to natural resource sampling, nearly 200 tag returns are reported annually by anglers. This information provides information on movement patterns, spawning occurrence, growth, and harvest metrics. <br> \n <br> \nIn order to harvest a Lake Sturgeon, anglers must purchase a harvest tag.  However no tag is required to fish catch-and-release for Lake Sturgeon.  Anglers may harvest one Lake Sturgeon per calender year.  A sturgeon must be between 45 and 50 inches (inclusive) or longer than 75 inches to be legal to harvest.  All other sturgeon must be immediately released.  The Lake Sturgeon harvest season is from April 24 to May 7, and from July 1 to September 30.  The catch and release only season is from May 8 to May 15, and from October 1 through April 23.  You may not fish for Lake Sturgeon during the closed season (May 16 to June 30). <br> \n <br> \nFor more information about Lake Sturgeon angling please see: <br> \nhttps://www.dnr.state.mn.us/areas/fisheries/baudette/lowregs.html  <br> \nTo report a tagged Lake Sturgeon please see: <br> \nhttps://www.dnr.state.mn.us/fisheries/tagged_fish_reporting/index.html  <br> \n <br> \nInfested Waters Designation  <br> \n <br> \nLake of the Woods and the Rainy River have received an infested waters designation due to the presence of Spiny Water Flea. Spiny Water Flea has been documented in Lake of the Woods, Rainy River and Rainy Lake. The impact of Spiny Water Flea on the food chain and fish populations of Lake of the Woods is still open to speculation, but being monitored closely. <br> \n <br> \nAt this date, the most immediate impact of Spiny Water Flea has been to human users of the lake and river. Emerald shiner is a popular bait fish on Lake of the Woods. Local bait shops and resorts have had significant businesses harvesting bait within the system. There is concern that Spiny Water Flea eggs may be ingested by small fish, and that Spiny Water Flea may then be spread through the bait fish distribution. To deal with this potential issue, a prohibition against bait collection, by non-permitted individuals, has been enacted. Trained and licensed bait dealers may still collect bait fish from infested waters, but the collected bait must be handled to allow the fish to purge any eggs they may have ingested.  <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nRusty Crayfish, a native of the Ohio River system, have been established in parts of the Ontario portion of Lake of the Woods since the late 1960s, but have been present in the Minnesota portion of Lake of the Woods only since 2006. At this point Rusty Crayfish are present in fairly low densities, but are continuing to expand south. Last fall they were found from the Northwest Angle, south to Pine Island in addition to the Rainy River. Rusty Crayfish have displaced the native crayfish within 2 years of colonizing an area, and have been associated with declines in aquatic vegetation when they become established. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Physical Description  <br> \n <br> \nLake of the Woods straddles the Canada-United States border, and is shared between the Canadian provinces of Manitoba and Ontario, and the U. S. state of Minnesota. Water level is directly controlled through three hydroelectric dams located at the head of the Winnipeg River in Kenora, Ontario. The Rainy River provides 75% of the inflow to the lake.  <br> \n <br> \nThe lake is comprised of several distinct basins. Minnesota portion of Lake of the Woods (just over 300,000 acres) lies within Muskeg Bay, Big Traverse Bay and Little Traverse Bay. Big Traverse Bay and Muskeg Bay are largely devoid of bottom structure and islands. Little Traverse Bay is more characteristic of the Ontario portion of Lake of the Woods, with numerous islands and reefs. These three basins do not stratify and in most years have widespread, dense, blue-green algae blooms that are first evident in July and continue through October. <br> \n <br> \nFisheries Management <br> \n <br> \nIn December of 2017, DNR Fisheries in Baudette began a management plan review/revision for Lake of the Woods, and solicited input from the public and a Fisheries Input Group. Stated within the fisheries management plan is a brief background of management history, series of management goals and objectives and management actions. The plan is effective for five years and goals/objectives will be reevaluated in 2023. The final plan can be found at: https://files.dnr.state.mn.us/fisheries/largelakes/low/low_plan.pdf <br> \n <br> \nThe largest and most important lakes in Minnesota are sampled every year, in order to closely monitor their fish populations. Lake of the Woods is one of the large lakes included in this Large Lake Sampling Program. These lakes are at least 15,000 acres in size, and typically support the best Walleye fisheries in the state. Anglers fish the Minnesota portion of Lake of the Woods for a variety of species, including Walleye, Sauger, Yellow Perch, Northern Pike and Lake Sturgeon. Due to the importance of Walleye and Sauger, a great deal of population monitoring effort is focused on them. Overviews of the sampling programs conducted on Lake of the Woods are located on the Baudette Area Fisheries web page, on the MN-DNR web site, at www.mndnr.gov/areas/fisheries/baudette. <br> \n <br> \nThe primary assessment used to monitor fish populations is fall gill net assessment. This assessment has been annual since 1981, but a comparable assessment was conducted from 1968 through 1970. From 1968 through 2001, the fall gill net assessment sampled the near-shore waters of Lake of the Woods, from 6 to 25 feet in depth. In 2002 off-shore nets were added to the assessment. The off-shore nets sample water from 32 to 35 feet deep. There are differences in the size structure and abundance of fish species in the near-shore and off-shore samples.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye <br> \n <br> \nSince 2002, the average Walleye catch rate or catch per unit effort (CPUE) is 16.4 fish/net (both near and off-shore nets combined). The 2021 CPUE was 11.5 fish/net and down from 2020 (12.8 fish/net). The current 3-year average for CPUE is 14.2 fish/net and exceeds the 2018-2023 management goal ~ 14 fish/net. Gill net sampled Walleye ranged in length from 4.1 to 30.35 inches with an average length of 14.0 inches. Small Walleye (~ 9-10 inches) were above average, while keeper-sized Walleye (14 to 19 inches) were below the historic average. Walleye 11 and 15 inches were well below historic levels and is the result of weak year-classes being produced in 2017 and 2019. Lastly, the 2018-2023 fisheries management plan calls for the annual percentage of gill net sampled Walleye over 20 inches to be 5 to 15% of the total catch. In 2021, over 28% the Walleye sampled were 20 inches or larger.  <br> \n <br> \nSauger <br> \n <br> \nIn 2021, Sauger gill net CPUE was 22.6 fish/net and the current 3-year average (23.5 fish/net) exceeds the 2018-2023 management goal of ~ 16 fish/net. Above average Sauger abundance experienced the past few years is the result of several strong year-classes being produced over the past decade. Sauger sampled in 2021, ranged in length from 3 to 18.2 inches with an average length of 11 inches. Sauger from 9 to 13 inches are at, or exceed, historic levels, while fish < 8 inches were below average. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike <br> \n <br> \nLake of the Woods is managed for a high-quality Northern Pike population, with a significant component of \"trophy\" Northern Pike over 40 inches long. To monitor the size structure of the Northern Pike population, it is sampled every 5 years using trap nets at known spawning sites. Trap netting conducted in 2021 revealed a high-quality size structure for all sampled tributaries to Lake of the Woods. Fall gill netting in 2021 sampled Northern Pike from 17 to 41 inches with an average length of 25.4 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch are often not targeted by anglers fishing Lake of the Woods, but are caught incidentally fishing for Walleye and Sauger. Under the current fisheries management plan for 2018-2023 no population level goals are set for Yellow Perch, but they are of management interest. Results from 2021 indicate perch near-shore abundance was above the 10-year average and was the highest observed since 2018. Catch rates for Yellow Perch are highly variable, but have slightly declined since the early 1990s. Yellow Perch ranged in length from 5 to 13.5 inches with an average length of 8.2 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nLake Sturgeon <br> \n <br> \nSince 2004, spawning Lake Sturgeon are sampled annually on the Rapid River (a tributary to the Rainy River). Over the past 15 years there has been an overall increase in mean length and greater proportion of \"large\" sturgeon in the sampled population. In addition to obtaining lengths, sampled Lake Sturgeon are tagged with a unique number at the base of the dorsal fin. This information has revealed that males typically spawn every 2 to 3 years (in some cases annually) and females spawn every 4 to 9 years. In total over 2,000 fish have been tagged at the Rapid River and over 10,000 have been tagged system-wide since the inception of the tagging program. In addition to natural resource sampling, nearly 250 tag returns are reported annually by anglers. This information provides information on movement patterns, spawning occurrence, growth, and harvest metrics. <br> \n <br> \nIn order to harvest a Lake Sturgeon, anglers must purchase a harvest tag. However no tag is required to fish catch-and-release for Lake Sturgeon. Anglers may harvest one Lake Sturgeon per calendar year. A sturgeon must be between 45 and 50 inches (inclusive) or longer than 75 inches to be legal to harvest; harvested sturgeon must be registered per guidance in regulation book. All other sturgeon must be immediately released. The Lake Sturgeon harvest season is from April 24 to May 7, and from July 1 to September 30. The catch and release only season is from May 8 to May 15, and from October 1 through April 23. You may not fish for Lake Sturgeon during the closed season (May 16 to June 30). <br> \n <br> \nFor more information about Lake Sturgeon angling please see: <br> \nhttps://www.dnr.state.mn.us/areas/fisheries/baudette/lowregs.html  <br> \n <br> \nTo report a tagged Lake Sturgeon please see: <br> \nhttps://www.dnr.state.mn.us/fisheries/tagged_fish_reporting/index.html  <br> \n <br> \nInfested Waters Designation  <br> \n <br> \nLake of the Woods and the Rainy River have received an infested waters designation due to the presence of Spiny Water Flea and Zebra Mussel. Spiny Water Flea was first documented in the late 2000s in the Minnesota waters of Lake of the Woods. In 2019, Zebra Mussel veligers (lavae) were sampled by fisheries staff in Muskeg Bay and is the first occurrence of this AIS (aquatic invasive species) in the Minnesota waters of Lake of the Woods. No adult Zebra Mussel were observed in 2021.  <br> \n <br> \nAt this date, the most immediate impact of Spiny Water Flea has been to human users of the lake and river. Emerald shiner is a popular bait fish on Lake of the Woods. Local bait shops and resorts have had significant businesses harvesting bait within the system. There is concern that Spiny Water Flea eggs may be ingested by small fish, and that Spiny Water Flea may then be spread through the bait fish distribution. To deal with this potential issue, a prohibition against bait collection, by non-permitted individuals, has been enacted. Trained and licensed bait dealers may still collect bait fish from infested waters, but the collected bait must be handled to allow the fish to purge any eggs they may have ingested.  <br> \n <br> \nRusty Crayfish, a native of the Ohio River system, have been established in parts of the Ontario portion of Lake of the Woods since the late 1960s, but have been present in the Minnesota portion of Lake of the Woods only since 2006. At this point Rusty Crayfish are present in fairly low densities, but are continuing to expand south. Last fall they were found from the Northwest Angle, south to Pine Island in addition to the Rainy River. Densities of Rusty Crayfish decline substantially from the Northwest Angle south. Rusty Crayfish have displaced the native crayfish within 2 years of colonizing an area, and have been associated with declines in aquatic vegetation when they become established. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>The walleye population is in very good shape with about 15 age groups represented annually.  The oldest walleye found in the summer creel survey was of the 1980 year class (age-18).  The mean total length of 1991 year class walleye (sexes combined) exceeds 20 inches, based on creel survey data.  Walleye from this very strong year class represented 8% of the harvest in the summer fishery.  The 1992 and 1993 year classes are weak.  This weakness is manifested as a dip in the  fall gill net sample length frequency centered on the 17 inch interval.  Combined, these two year classes accounted for 8% of the walleye harvested during the summer fishery.  The 1994 year class is of average strength and accounted for 34% of the summer walleye harvest.  The 1995 year class is of average strength.  Walleye from this year class averaged just over 12 inches long in May and grew to over 14 inches by the end of September.  Nineteen ninety-five year class walleye were 44% of the walleye harvested in the 1998 summer fishery.  Due to poor growth during the summer of 1996, the 1996 yearclass is projected to be extremely weak.  These walleye should average about 12 inches long in the fall gill net assessment sample.  The fall gill net sample suggests that the strength of the 1996 year class will be stronger than predicted.  The sauger population is characterized by highly variable recruitment.  Strong year classes were produced in 1989 and 1990.  These year classes accounted for 20% of the summer 1998 sauger harvest.  Weak year classes were produced from 1991 through 1993.  The 1994 year-class is of average strength, and comprised 45% of the summer sauger harvest.  The 1995 and 1996 year classes are projected to be weak.  These year classes are not yet recruited to the fishery.  The 1997 year class is projected to be strong.  Sauger in the 1997 year class range from 6 to 8 inches long in the fall gill net assessment sample.  These sauger comprised 46% of the sample.An analysis that investigated the relationship between a number of variables and sauger year-class strength showed that the two most important variables were the abundance of age-0 sauger and the abundance of age-1 to age-5 walleye.  The abundance of age-0 sauger (measured by August trawling) was positively correlated with year-class strength and accounted for 77% of the variation around year-class strength.  Walleye abundance, based on the sum of year-class strengths of age-1 to age-5 walleye, was negatively correlated with sauger year-class strength.  Abundance of walleye accounted for 13% of the variability around sauger year-class strength.   The strength of the 1998 sauger year-class range is estimated at 80.Northern pike are not sampled very effectively with standard lake assessment gill nets.  In the 1983 to 1994 fall gill net assessment, northern pike CPUE has ranged from 0.8 to 2.7 with a 10 year mean of 1.5.  The problem of small sample size has been addressed with a spring survey, using trap nets.  Spring spawning run trap net assessment depicts a very high quality northern pike population.  In 1995 the spawning run assessment was expanded to a tagging study, and  1,500 northern pike were tagged.  The primary purpose of this study was to determine whether northern pike using streams in Minnesota as spawning sites were exclusively Minnesota stocks, or if the stocks were shared with the provinces of Manitoba and/or Ontario.  In 1995, 15% of 1,432 tagged pike exceeded 750 mm (~30 inches).  Approximately 2% of tagged northern pike exceed 1,000 mm (~40 inches).  Preliminary tag return data suggest that the northern pike that spawn in Rainy River tributary streams spend their time in the Rainy River and are a distinct stock from the pike that spawn in Lake of the Woods tributaries.  Rainy River tributary streams, as a group, have significantly smaller mean lengths than any of the other sites at which northern pike are tagged.  Zippel Bay and the Warroad River stood out as sites from which a lot of tags were returned.  These are areas that have a relatively high proportion of targeted northern pike effort.Preliminary (not error checked) data from the annual summer creel survey are available.  This past summer was one of excellent walleye fishing success on Lake of the Woods.  The total targeted CPUE (number of walleye per angler hour) for walleye was 0.47.  The targeted CPUE for harvested walleye was 0.31, with a modal length (23% of harvested walleye) in the 13 inch interval, approximately 0.8 lbs.  The distribution of the number of harvested walleye  per angler is presented in an attached figure.  The harvest of walleye on the Minnesota waters of Lake of the Woods was 236,000 fish for a total weight of 283,500 pounds, from a pressure of 752,000 angler hours.About 42,000 pounds of sauger were harvested during the summer of 1998.  This level of harvest is slightly higher than the 1993 to 1997 mean of 34,670 pounds.  The modal length of harvested sauger was in the 12 and 13 inch intervals.  The non-targeted harvest rate of sauger was 0.09, with an overall non-targeted catch rate of 0.12.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>The walleye population is in very good shape with about 15 age groups represented annually.  The oldest walleye sampled in 2000 fall gill net assessment was a 19 year old male.  The 1991 year class walleye are no longer a major component of the gill net sample.  The majority of the 1991 walleye have outgrown the experimental gill net, and less than 20% of the supplementary large mesh gill net was of 1991 year class walleye.  The 1991 walleye year class remains the strongest measured on Lake of the Woods.  Since the weak year classes of 1992 and 1993, no weak year classes have been measured.  Walleye CPUE dropped from the second highest measured in the past 10 years, in 1999, to just below the 10 year mean CPUE, in 2000.  This change is likely due to the normal variability inherent in gill net sampling rather than a real change in abundance.The sauger population is characterized by highly variable recruitment.  Strong year classes were produced in 1989 and 1990.  These year classes are virtually gone from the sauger population; they form less than 2% of the sample.  Weak year classes were produced in 1991 and 1992.  The 1993 and 1994 year-classes are of average strength.  Sauger from these year-classes averaged between 14 and 16 inches (depending on sex) long in fall assessment netting, but comprised only 11% of the sauger sample.  The 1995 year class is weak.  The 1996 year class is of average strength (mean length of 13.5 inches in fall netting), and made up about 15% of the sample.  The 1997 year class appears to be very strong, comprising 46% of the sample.  Sauger of the 1997 year-class averaged about 11.5 inches long in the fall gill net assessment sample.  Ice anglers readily accept sauger when they reach 11 inches in length, so slightly more than 50% of the 1997 year class sauger should be acceptable to anglers.  Overall, about 60% of the sauger sample exceeded 11 inches long.Year class strength of walleye and sauger can be predicted with afairly high degree of confidence based on information collected during YOY percid assessment, conducted during July and August.  The variable used to predict walleye year class strength is the length that YOY walleye achieve by August 15.  Length and year class strength are positively correlated.  Though YOY walleye abundance has not been shown to be a significant effect to year class strength, it is interesting that summer YOY percid assessment indicated very low YOY walleye abundance.   Based on August 15 length, the 2000 walleye year class will be extremely weak.  Sauger year class strength can be predicted with YOY sauger abundance, measured through August trawling, and walleye abundance, measured through fall gill net assessment.  Young of year sauger abundance is positively correlated with year class strength, while walleye abundance has an inverse relationship with sauger year class strength.  The very low YOY sauger abundance, combined with moderate walleye abundance suggest that the 2000 sauger will also very weak.  In addition to low YOY walleye and sauger abundance, YOY yellow perch abundance was also very low.Stomachs from a sample of the walleye, sauger, and northern pike caught in fall gill net assessment were examined for prey items this past year.  The low abundance of YOY yellow perch was reflected in the diets of walleye and sauger.  Only 6% of non-empty walleye stomachs contained YOY yellow perch, and 7% of non-empty sauger stomachs held YOY yellow perch.  In contrast, in 1997 41% of non-empty walleye stomachs, and 37% of sauger stomachs contained YOY yellow perch.  Rainbow smelt were a major component of the walleye diet this past fall.  Although rainbow smelt have been documented in Lake of the Woods since 1991, no rainbow smelt had been found in walleye stomachs during fall gill net assessment.  This past fall post-YOY rainbow smelt were the most abundant identified prey item taken by walleye.  Thirty-two percent of non-empty walleye stomachs held rainbow smelt.  Sauger also preyed on rainbow smelt, but to a much smaller degree.  The increase in importance of rainbow smelt in the fall diet of walleye and sauger occurred despite relatively low abundance of rainbow smelt measured by August trawling.  The shortage of YOY yellow perch likely caused walleye and sauger to seek alternate prey.  It is interesting that walleye continue to ignore the abundant trout-perch, even when a normally major prey item is scarce, while sauger readily prey on trout-perch.Northern pike are not sampled very effectively with standard lake assessment gill nets.  In the 1983 to 1994 fall gill net assessment, northern pike CPUE has ranged from 0.8 to 2.7 with a 10 year mean of 1.5.  The problem of small sample size has been addressed with a spring survey, using trap nets.  Spring spawning run trap net assessment depicts a very high quality northern pike population.  In 1995, the spawning run assessment was expanded to a tagging study, and  1,500 northern pike were tagged.  The primary purpose of this study was to determine whether northern pike using streams in Minnesota as spawning sites were exclusively Minnesota stocks, or if the stocks were shared with the provinces of Manitoba and/or Ontario.  In 1995, 15% of 1,432 tagged pike exceeded 750 mm (~30 inches).  Approximately 2% of tagged northern pike exceed 1,000 mm (~40 inches).  Preliminary tag return data suggest that the northern pike that spawn in Rainy River tributary streams spend their time in the Rainy River and are a distinct stock from the pike that spawn in Lake of the Woods tributaries.  Rainy River tributary streams, as a group, have significantly smaller mean lengths than any of the other sites at which northern pike are tagged.  Zippel Bay and the Warroad River stood out as sites from which a lot of tags were returned.  These are areas that have a relatively high proportion of targeted northern pike effort.  Based on tag returns, northern pike exploitation estimates range from 5.3-7% (depending on whether 30% or 40% of tags are reported) and survival is estimated at 66%.  Due to extremely low runoff in the spring of 2000 it is projected that the northern pike year class will be very weak.Preliminary (not error checked) data from the summer 2000 creel survey are available.  This past summer was, once again, one of excellent walleye fishing success on Lake of the Woods.  The summer was unusual in how the fishery changed through time.  Normally late May and June are the time periods with the best fishing success.  This year terrible fishing conditions (cold, wind, rain) dominated May and June.  Weather conditions improved in July however, and fishing was excellent.  Overall walleye catch rate stayed below 0.30 (harvest rate was about 0.22) in June, but increased to 0.60 (harvest rate was 0.43) in July.  Walleye CPUE remained above 0.35 (harvest rate was 0.24) through August.  The overall targeted CPUE for harvested walleye was 0.28, with a modal length (26% of harvested walleye) in the 13 inch interval. The relatively small modal length for harvested walleye is due to a relatively strong 1997 year class.  This group of walleye should enter the summer 2001 fishery at about 14 inches in length. The distribution of the number of harvested walleye  per angler is presented in an attached figure.  The harvest of walleye on the Minnesota waters of Lake of the Woods was 301,000 pounds, from a pressure of 830,000 angler hours.About 32,000 pounds of sauger were harvested during the summer of 2000.  This level of harvest is essentially unchanged from the 1994 to 1998 mean of 33,258 pounds.  The length frequency distribution of harvested sauger shows that the 11 through 14 inch intervals are basically equally represented.  Sauger from these length intervals comprised 70% of the harvest.  The overall non-targeted harvest rate of sauger was 0.05, with an overall non-targeted catch rate of 0.11.  There were distinct catch rate differences between user groups.  Non-guided parties had a total catch rate of about 0.09.  Launch based anglers, which fish primarily with downriggers farther off shore than the non-guided anglers, had a total catch rate of 0.19, with a harvest rate of 0.11.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Anglers fish the Minnesota portion of Lake of the Woods for a variety of species, including walleye, sauger, yellow perch, northern pike and lake sturgeon.  Due to the importance of walleye and sauger, a great deal of population monitoring effort is focused on them.  Detailed overviews of the sampling programs conducted on Lake of the Woods are located on the Baudette Area Fisheries web page, on the MN-DNR web site, at www.mndnr.gov/areas/fisheries/baudette . <br> \n <br> \nThe walleye population is in good shape, with at least 15 age classes represented annually.  A fish population, such as Lake of the Woods walleye, with a variety of age classes present is a healthy fish population. Walleye from age-0 through age-20 were sampled in 2011.  The longest individual sampled was a 28.0 inch long.  A relatively high proportion of the walleye sample (16%) was of age-0 individuals.  Past experience suggests that a catch rate of age-0 individuals in this range predicts a moderately strong to strong year class.  Long-term mean abundance (1968-2011) is 14.8 walleye per gill net lift.  The 2011 abundance was 19.7 per lift, above the long-term mean, but within the range of normal abundances. <br> \n <br> \nSauger abundance is currently very high.  Sauger abundance is 21.0 sauger per gill net, and is down from the record high of 30.8, measured in 2009.  Mean abundance, from 1968-2011, is 13.5 sauger per gill net.  The high sauger abundance can be attributed to the production of three strong year classes (2005, 2006 and 2007), combined with only two weak year classes, in the past ten years.  Of particular note is the 2006 year class.  The 2006 year class is the strongest sauger year class measured since fall gill net assessment became an annual survey in 1981.  Sauger from the 2006 year class comprised about 46% of the entire sauger sample, and had an average length of 13 inches.  Sauger from the 2007 year class had a mean length of 12 inches.  Sauger from all three of the strong year classes are now of a size anglers prefer to harvest. <br> \n <br> \nThe yellow perch population is at an average level of abundance, after being well below average since 2007.  The gill net catch rate was 16.3 per lift, with a mean (1968-2011) gill net catch rate of 14.7 yellow perch per net.  The increase in abundance is being driven by a high proportion of age-1 individuals, suggesting that the 2010 yellow perch year class is strong.  Age-1 yellow perch comprised 40% of the sample, but had a mean length of only 5.7 inches.  Yellow perch grow to 9 inches by age-4 and reach 10 inches by age-5. <br> \n <br> \nLake of the Woods is managed to provide a trophy northern pike fishery.  Overall, 19% of the 716 northern pike sampled exceeded 35 inches, and 5% exceeded 40 inches.   Spring northern pike assessment is currently scheduled to take place on a five-year rotation.  It was anticipated that all sites would be sampled in a single year, but this was not possible in 2011.  The sites which could not be sampled will be completed in 2012. <br> \n <br> \nInfested Waters Designation <br> \n <br> \nSpiny water flea, rusty crayfish and rainbow smelt have all invaded the Minnesota portion of Lake of the Woods.  Anglers should familiarize themselves with regualtions deasigned to prevent the spread of these, and other, aquatic invasive species between water bodies. <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nLake of the Woods Regulations <br> \n <br> \nCurrent walleye and sauger harvest regulations were enacted on December 1, 2004. The regulations vary by time of year, location on the lake, and between Lake of the Woods and the Rainy River. <br> \n <br> \nLake of the Woods, from December 1 through April 14, the walleye/sauger aggregate limit is eight (not more than four can be walleye). Walleye from 19.5 to 28 inches must be immediately released. Only one walleye over 28 inches total length can be possessed. <br> \n <br> \nLake of the Woods, from walleye opener through November 30, the walleye/sauger aggregate limit is six (not more than four can be walleye). Walleye from 19.5 to 28 inches must be immediately released. Only one walleye over 28 inches total length can be possessed. <br> \n <br> \nFour Mile Bay of Lake of the Woods, from March 1 through April 14, the walleye/sauger aggregate limit is two (no walleye over 19.5 inches). <br> \n <br> \nRainy River from walleye opener through February, the walleye/sauger aggregate limit is six (not more than four can be walleye). Walleye from 19.5 to 28 inches must be immediately released. Only one walleye over 28 inches total length can be possessed. <br> \n <br> \nRainy River from March 1 through April 14, the walleye/sauger aggregate limit is two (no walleye over 19.5 inches). <br> \n <br> \nThe northern pike possession limit is 3, of which only one can exceed 40 inches.  The open season is continuous.  <br> \n <br> \nThe lake sturgeon harvest season is from April 24 to May 7, and from July 1 to September 30.  Anglers may harvest one lake sturgeon per year.  A sturgeon must be between 45 and 50 inches (inclusive) or longer than 75 inches to be legal to harvest.  All other sturgeon must be immediately released.  Anglers wishing to harvest a lake sturgeon must purchase a lake sturgeon harvest tag.  The tag is available through the electronic licensing system (any license issuing agent) and costs $5.00.  Upon harvesting a sturgeon, the harvesting angler must notch the appropriate areas of the tag indicating the date and time of harvest, then the tag must be attached to the sturgeon. Within 48 hours a registration card must be completed by the harvesting angler and mailed in. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers do not need a harvest tag to catch and release lake sturgeon, a harvest tag is needed only if they intend to harvest one.  The catch and release only season is from May 8 to May 15, and from October 1 through April 23.  You may not fish for lake sturgeon during the closed season (May 16 to June 30).   <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Anglers fish the Minnesota portion of Lake of the Woods for a variety of species, including walleye, sauger, yellow perch, northern pike and lake sturgeon.  Due to the importance of walleye and sauger, a great deal of population monitoring effort is focused on them.  Overviews of the sampling programs conducted on Lake of the Woods are located on the Baudette Area Fisheries web page, on the MN-DNR web site, at www.mndnr.gov/areas/fisheries/baudette. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye and Sauger <br> \n <br> \nThe primary assessment used to monitor walleye and sauger populations is fall gill net assessment.  This assessment has been annual since 1981, but a comparable assessment was conducted from 1968 through 1970.  From 1968 through 2001, the fall gill net assessment sampled the near-shore waters of Lake of the Woods, from 6 to 25 feet in depth.  In 2002 off-shore nets were added to the assessment. The off-shore nets sample water from 32 to 35 feet deep. The off-shore nets are analyzed separately from the standard nets due to differences in catch rate and size distribution. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye.  Walleye catches in the 2014 near-shore gill net sampling averaged about 23 walleye per gill net, which is well above the long-term average of 14.7. The number of walleye sampled annually can be quite variable due to the presence or absence of strong year classes in the population.  Walleye abundance declined steadily from 2001 through 2009, from 22.3 to 9.1 walleye per gill net.  This decline in abundance was attributable to the unusually abundant walleye population in 2001, due to the production of a series of strong year classes in the late 1990s and in 2001, which pushed overall abundance well above the long-term average of 14.7 walleye per gill net.  After 2001 moderate year classes alternated with weak year classes, causing an overall decline in abundance.  More recently, the 2011 year class is strong, and early indications are that the 2013 year class will be strong.  As these year classes continue to recruit to the walleye sample overall abundance will remain high, or increase. <br> \n <br> \nThe most abundant size groups of walleye are from 8 to 10 inches long (2013 year class), and from 12 to 14 inches long (2011 year class). <br> \n <br> \nSauger.  The highest sauger abundance measured in the fall gill net assessment was in 2009, when we found 30.8 sauger per lift.  This high abundance was driven by young sauger from the strong year classes produced from 2005 through 2007, and there were relatively few keepers available.  As these sauger have grown older, overall abundance has declined, but a high quality size structure has developed. Overall sauger abundance declined from 2009 through 2013, because only the 2011 year class was strong through this period.  Sauger from the 2011 year class were too small to be effectively captured in the gill nets, until 2014.  Sauger abundance jumped up in 2014 due to the recruitment of the 2011 year class to the sample. <br> \n <br> \nSauger from 9 to 13 inches long are all more abundant than the long-term average. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike <br> \n <br> \nLake of the Woods is managed for a high-quality northern pike population, with a significant component of \"trophy\" northern pike over 40 inches long.  To monitor the size structure of the northern pike population, it is sampled every 5 years using trap nets at known spawning sites.  The northern pike population continues to be one of high quality, with 19% of the adult population at least 35 inches long, and 5% of the adults 40 inches long, or longer.  The next northern pike sample is scheduled to be collected in the spring of 2015, though the low runoff we are experiencing may prevent that sampling program from being completed. <br> \n <br> \nLake Sturgeon <br> \n <br> \nThe third population estimate for lake sturgeon since 1990 was completed in 2014.  Previous estimates for lake sturgeon (40-inches and longer) were 16,000 (1990) and 59,000 (2004).  In 2014 we estimate that there were 92,000 lake sturgeon of 40-inches and longer in the Lake of the Woods-Rainy River system.  Along with the increase in abundance, we also found that the number of \"large\" sturgeon increased.  The largest sturgeon we sampled was 72-inches long, and had an estimated weight of 104 pounds. <br> \n <br> \nFishing for lake sturgeon is a unique opportunity in the Lake of the Woods-Rainy River system.  The lake sturgeon population is still recovering from a period of low abundance caused by over harvest and pollution.  During the recovery phase we have to be conservative with the number and pounds of sturgeon harvested to ensure that the population fully recovers to a healthy size structure and level of abundance.  In order to harvest a lake sturgeon, anglers must purchase a harvest tag.  However no tag is required to fish catch-and-release for lake sturgeon.  Anglers may harvest one lake sturgeon per year.  A sturgeon must be between 45 and 50 inches (inclusive) or longer than 75 inches to be legal to harvest.  All other sturgeon must be immediately released.  The lake sturgeon harvest season is from April 24 to May 7, and from July 1 to September 30.  The catch and release only season is from May 8 to May 15, and from October 1 through April 23.  You may not fish for lake sturgeon during the closed season (May 16 to June 30). <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nInfested Waters Designation <br> \n <br> \nLake of the Woods and the Rainy River have received an infested waters designation due to the presence of spiny water flea (Bythotrephes longimanus).  Spiny water flea has been documented in Lake of the Woods, Rainy River and Rainy Lake.  The impact of spiny water flea on the food chain and fish populations of Lake of the Woods is still open to speculation.  <br> \n <br> \nZooplankton sampling has continued to document changes in the zooplankton community of Lake of the Woods.  Two sites are sampled every other week from mid-June through August.  Thirty-foot vertical tows are made with an 80 micron, 30 cm diameter plankton net. <br> \n <br> \nAt this date, the most immediate impact of spiny water flea has been to human users of the lake and river.  Emerald shiner is a popular bait fish on Lake of the Woods.  Local bait shops and resorts have had significant businesses harvesting bait within the system.  There is concern that spiny water flea eggs may be ingested by small fish, and that spiny water flea may then be spread through the bait fish distribution.  To deal with this potential issue, a prohibition against bait collection, by non-licensed individuals, has been enacted.  Trained and licensed bait dealers may still collect bait fish from infested waters, but the collected bait must be handled to allow the fish to purge any eggs they may have ingested. <br> \n <br> \nRusty crayfish (Orconectes rusticus) were documented in the Minnesota portion of Lake of the Woods in September 2006.  At this point rusty crayfish appear to be present in fairly low densities, but are continuing to expand south.  Last fall they were found from Stoney Point (south-eastern portion of the Northwest Angle) across to Knight Island.  Rusty crayfish, a native of the Ohio River system, have been established in parts of the Ontario portion of Lake of the Woods since the late 1960s. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake of the Woods <br> \n <br> \nLake of the Woods lies in the Hudson Bay drainage basin and straddles the Canada-United States border.  This 900,000 acre lake is shared between the Canadian provinces of Manitoba and Ontario, and the state of Minnesota.  About 320,000 acres lie within Minnesota.   <br> \n <br> \nThe lake is comprised of several distinct basins.  The Minnesota portion of Lake of the Woods is comprised of Muskeg Bay, Big Traverse Bay and Little Traverse Bay.  Big Traverse Bay and Muskeg Bay are largely devoid of bottom structure and islands.  Little Traverse Bay (north of Garden Island) is more characteristic of the Ontario waters of Lake of the Woods, with numerous islands and reefs.  These three lake basins do not stratify and have widespread, dense, blue-green algae blooms that are first evident in July and continue through September, in most years. <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nWalleye <br> \n <br> \nWalleye are currently slightly less abundant than their 10-year average abundance.  Since 1997, odd numbered years have produced strong year classes while even numbered years have produced only moderate or weak year classes.  For the spring and summer of 2007, anglers will notice an abundance of four and six year old walleye.  The four year old walleye will grow from about 12 to 14 inches in length through the summer, while the six year olds range from 14 to 16 inches long.  Two year old walleye, from the strong 2005 year class, are very abundant, but their 9-10 inch average length puts them in the  \"bait stealer\" category.  Lake of the Woods has a history of producing large, high-quality walleye.  This segment of the walleye population continues to be well represented.  <br> \n <br> \nSauger <br> \n <br> \nFall gill net sampling indicates that sauger are more abundant than their 10-year average abundance. In the past 10 years, sauger were most abundant in 2002. Sauger abundance declined rapidly through 2004, but has increased since then. Sauger abundance should continue to increase as good year classes recruit to the fishery. Summer sampling suggests that the sauger year class produced in 2006 will be very strong. <br> \n <br> \nMore than 60 percent of the fall gill net sauger sample exceeded 11 inches in length. High-quality sauger, those longer than 14 inches, comprised 25 percent of the sample. Along with these \"keepers,\" 20 percent of the sample ranged in length from 7 to 9 inches. The majority of these sauger are one year old. Sauger rarely exceed 15 years old. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike <br> \n <br> \nThe northern pike regulation on Lake of the Woods, Rainy River and several tributary streams is designed to protect the size structure of the pike population. An experimental regulation was evaluated from 1996 through 2005. After 10 years with the experimental regulation, a 2005 evaluation of the northern pike population indicated the number of pike over 36 inches increased from seven percent of the sample to 16 percent. The percentage of northern pike longer than 40 inches increased from two to four percent. The largest northern pike in the population are typically 12 to 15 years old. Based on this improvement, the regulation was made permanent in 2006. <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nSpecial Regulations <br> \n <br> \nAnglers should be aware of special fishing regulations on Lake of the Woods.  These regulations are designed to maintain a quality fishery and fishing experience.  The combined walleye-sauger limit is six, but no more than four of those fish may be walleye.  All walleye between 19.5 and 28 inches in length must be immediately released, and only one walleye longer than 28 inches may be possessed.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike are also managed by special regulation.  The possession limit is three.  All northern pike between 30-40 inches must be released immediately.  An angler may possess one northern pike over 40 inches. <br> \n <br> \nThe Lake of the Woods-Rainy River system is one of the very few water systems that has a sturgeon population that is healthy enough to support a sport fishery which has a harvest component.  Due to sturgeon life history, they are highly prone to over-harvest.  To protect the sturgeon population, yet still allow some harvest, the sturgeon fishery is tightly controlled.  Anglers wishing to harvest a sturgeon must purchase a sturgeon harvest tag.  The tag must be validated and submitted when a sturgeon has been harvested.  No harvest tag is required to catch-and-release fish for sturgeon.  Sturgeon fishing also has a closed season (no fishing for sturgeon is allowed), catch-and-release season (fishing is allowed, but none may be harvested) and a harvest season.  Check the Minnesota-Ontario border waters section of the fishing regulations for specific season dates. <br> \n <br> \nSpiny water flea was discovered in Rainy Lake last summer, and it is anticipated that Lake of the Woods will be colonized during the summer of 2007.  As a precaution, Lake of the Woods has been designated as infested with spiny water flea.  With the infestation, anglers have some obligations to prevent the spread of this invader to other water bodies.  Anglers must make sure they do not transport any lake water in their boats.  Bilges, live wells and bait wells must all be drained at boat landings.  Also, spiny water flea tends to wrap around fishing line, so anglers must clean their fishing equipment when leaving the lake.  Check the DNR web site for more specific information of how to prevent the spread of spiny water flea. <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nMore Information <br> \n <br> \nFor more information about Lake of the Woods fish resources and fishing, please check out the Baudette Area Fisheries Management Area page on the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources web site:  <br> \n <br> \n( http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/areas/fisheries/baudette/index.html ) <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake of the Woods <br> \n <br> \nLake of the Woods straddles the Canada-United States border, and is shared between the Canadian provinces of Manitoba and Ontario, and the U. S. state of Minnesota.  Water level is directly controlled through three hydroelectric dams located at the head of the Winnipeg River in Kenora, Ontario. The Rainy River provides 75% of the inflow to the lake.  Water flow into the Rainy River is controlled through a hydroelectric dam located between Fort Frances, Ontario and International Falls, Minnesota. <br> \n <br> \nThe lake is comprised of several distinct basins.  The Minnesota portion of Lake of the Woods (320,000 acres) lies within Muskeg Bay, Big Traverse Bay and Little Traverse Bay.  Big Traverse Bay and Muskeg Bay are largely devoid of bottom structure and islands.  Little Traverse Bay is more characteristic of the Ontario portion of Lake of the Woods, with numerous islands and reefs.  These three basins do not stratify and in most years have widespread, dense, blue-green algae blooms that are first evident in July and continue through September. <br> \n <br> \nThe largest and most important lakes in Minnesota are sampled every year, in order to closely monitor their fish populations.  Lake of the Woods is one of the ten lakes included in this Large Lake Sampling Program.  These lakes are at least 15,000 acres in size, and typically support the best walleye fisheries in the state. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers fish the Minnesota portion of Lake of the Woods for a variety of species, including walleye, sauger, yellow perch, northern pike and lake sturgeon.  Due to the importance of walleye and sauger, a great deal of population monitoring effort is focused on them.  Overviews of the sampling programs conducted on Lake of the Woods are located on the Baudette Area Fisheries web page, on the MN-DNR web site, at www.mndnr.gov/areas/fisheries/baudette. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye <br> \nWalleye catches in the 2009 gill net sampling averaged 9.1 walleye per gill net. This level of abundance is well below the long-term average of 14.7 walleye per gill net. Walleye abundance has declined steadily since 2001, when 22.3 walleye per gill net were sampled.  For perspective, abundance of the 2001 walleye sample was the highest measured since 1970. <br> \n <br> \nEven though gill net catches have declined  since 2001, the actual harvestable walleye population has not dropped to the same degree.  In years when a strong year class is produced, a substantial portion of the walleye sample is comprised of very small (typically 5 to 8 inches long) walleye.  In 2001, about 25% of the sample was these 5 to 8 inch long walleye.  In 2009, the portion of the sample, that is of a size anglers prefer to catch and keep (longer than 12 inches), is still about 70% of the same portion of the 2001 population. <br> \n <br> \nSo, how will this abundance decline influence angling success?  The short answer is likely very little.  Overall fish abundance does play a role in angler success, but other factors, such as weather patterns and forage abundance are frequently a much greater influence.  As an extreme example, very poor fishing was experienced during the winter of 2005-06.  The primary influence during that winter was a series of wind storms that occurred just as the ice was forming on the lake.  The wind storms caused the water to become very muddy, and the suspended sediments did not settle out until very late in the winter. <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nSauger <br> \nIn contrast to the walleye population, the sauger population is at its highest level of abundance measured since fall gill net sampling started in 1968.  Sauger abundance has been increasing steadily over the past four years.  The 1968 to 2009 average catch is 12.9 sauger per gill net.  During fall gill netting in 2009, the sample had an impressive 30.8 sauger per net.  <br> \n <br> \nThe increase in sauger abundance is due to the consistent production of good year classes in recent years, and the presence of the very strong 2006 year class.  This single year class comprises 50% of the sauger sample, and is the strongest sauger year class documented since 1982.   <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nLake Sturgeon <br> \nFishing for lake sturgeon is a unique opportunity in the Lake of the Woods-Rainy River system.  The lake sturgeon population is still recovering from a period of low abundance caused by over harvest and pollution.  During the recovery phase we have to be conservative with the number and pounds of sturgeon harvested to ensure that the population fully recovers to a healthy size structure and level of abundance.  In order to harvest a lake sturgeon, anglers must purchase a harvest tag.  However no tag is required to fish catch-and-release for lake sturgeon.  Anglers may harvest one lake sturgeon per year.  A sturgeon must be between 45 and 50 inches (inclusive) or longer than 75 inches to be legal to harvest.  All other sturgeon must be immediately released.  The lake sturgeon harvest season is from April 24 to May 7, and from July 1 to September 30.  The catch and release only season is from May 8 to May 15, and from October 1 through April 23.  You may not fish for lake sturgeon during the closed season (May 16 to June 30). <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nInfested Waters Designation <br> \nLake of the Woods and the Rainy River have received an infested waters designation due to the presence of spiny water flea (Bythotrephes longimanus).  Spiny water flea has been documented in Lake of the Woods, Rainy River and Rainy Lake.  The impact of spiny water flea on the food chain and fish populations of Lake of the Woods is still open to speculation.  <br> \n <br> \nZooplankton sampling has been initiated to document changes in the zooplankton community of Lake of the Woods.  Two sites are sampled every other week from mid-June through August.  Nine meter vertical tows are made with a 150 micron, 30 cm diameter plankton net. <br> \n <br> \nAt this date, the most immediate impact of spiny water flea has been to human users of the lake and river.  Emerald shiner is a popular bait fish on Lake of the Woods.  Local bait shops and resorts have had significant businesses harvesting bait within the system.  There is concern that spiny water flea eggs may be ingested by small fish, and that spiny water flea may then be spread through the bait fish distribution.  To deal with this potential issue, a prohibition against bait collection, by non-licensed individuals, has been enacted.  Trained and licensed bait dealers may still collect bait fish from infested waters, but the collected bait must be handled to allow the fish to purge any eggs they may have ingested. <br> \n <br> \nRusty crayfish (Orconectes rusticus) were documented from the Minnesota portion of Lake of the Woods in September 2006.  At this point rusty crayfish appear to be present in fairly low densities, and only north of Garden Island.  Rusty crayfish have been established in parts of the Ontario portion of Lake of the Woods since the late 1960s. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

Due to the importance of walleye and sauger, a great deal of population monitoring effort is focused on them.  Detailed overviews of the sampling programs conducted on Lake of the Woods are located on the Baudette Area Fisheries web page, on the MN-DNR web site, at www.mndnr.gov/areas/fisheries/baudette. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye and Sauger <br> \n <br> \nThe primary assessment used to monitor walleye and sauger populations is fall gill net assessment.  This assessment has been annual since 1981, but a comparable assessment was conducted from 1968 through 1970.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye.  Walleye catches in the 2013 near-shore gill net sampling averaged about 15 walleye per gill net, which is at the long-term average. Walleye abundance declined steadily from 2001 through 2009, from 22.3 to 9.1 walleye per gill net.  This decline in abundance was attributable to the unusually abundant walleye population in 2001, due to the production of a series of strong year classes in the late 1990s and in 2001, which pushed overall abundance well above the long-term average of 14.7 walleye per gill net.  After 2001 moderate year classes alternated with weak year classes, causing an overall decline in abundance.  More recently, the 2011 year class is strong, and early indications are that the 2013 year class will be strong.  As this year class fully recruits to the walleye sample overall abundance should continue to go up. <br> \n <br> \nSauger.  Overall abundance has declined from the high of 30.8 sauger per lift, measured in 2009.  However, this high abundance was driven by young sauger from the strong year classes produced from 2005 through 2007, and there were relatively few keepers available.  As these sauger have grown older overall abundance has declined, but a high quality size structure has developed.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike <br> \n <br> \nLake of the Woods is managed for a high-quality northern pike population, with a significant component of \"trophy\" northern pike over 40 inches long.  To monitor the size structure of the northern pike population, it is sampled every 5 years using trap nets at known spawning sites.  The northern pike population continues to be one of high quality, with 19% of the adult population at least 35 inches long, and 5% of the adults 40 inches long, or longer. <br> \n <br> \nLake Sturgeon <br> \n <br> \nFishing for lake sturgeon is a unique opportunity in the Lake of the Woods-Rainy River system.  The lake sturgeon population is still recovering from a period of low abundance caused by over harvest and pollution.  During the recovery phase we have to be conservative with the number and pounds of sturgeon harvested to ensure that the population fully recovers to a healthy size structure and level of abundance.  In order to harvest a lake sturgeon, anglers must purchase a harvest tag.  However no tag is required to fish catch-and-release for lake sturgeon.  Anglers may harvest one lake sturgeon per year.  A sturgeon must be between 45 and 50 inches (inclusive) or longer than 75 inches to be legal to harvest.  All other sturgeon must be immediately released.  The lake sturgeon harvest season is from April 24 to May 7, and from July 1 to September 30.  The catch and release only season is from May 8 to May 15, and from October 1 through April 23.  You may not fish for lake sturgeon during the closed season (May 16 to June 30). <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nInfested Waters Designation <br> \n <br> \nLake of the Woods and the Rainy River have received an infested waters designation due to the presence of spiny water flea (Bythotrephes longimanus).  Spiny water flea has been documented in Lake of the Woods, Rainy River and Rainy Lake.  The impact of spiny water flea on the fish populations of Lake of the Woods is still open to speculation, though we have documented significant changes in the zooplankton community.  This is of concern because zooplankton are the base of the food chain. <br> \n <br> \nRusty crayfish (Orconectes rusticus) were documented in the Minnesota portion of Lake of the Woods in September 2006.  At this point rusty crayfish appear to be present in fairly low densities, and only as far south as Driftwood Point, just south-east of Garden Island.  Rusty crayfish, a native of the Ohio River system, have been established in parts of the Ontario portion of Lake of the Woods since the late 1960s. <br> \n</p>",

Minnesota portion of Lake of the Woods (just over 300,000 acres) lies within Muskeg Bay, Big Traverse Bay and Little Traverse Bay.  Big Traverse Bay and Muskeg Bay are largely devoid of bottom structure and islands.  Little Traverse Bay is more characteristic of the Ontario portion of Lake of the Woods, with numerous islands and reefs.  These three basins do not stratify and in most years have widespread, dense, blue-green algae blooms that are first evident in July and continue through October. <br> \n <br> \nFisheries Management <br> \n <br> \nIn December of 2017, DNR Fisheries in Baudette began a management plan review/revision for Lake of the Woods. Stated within the fisheries management plan is a brief background of management history, series of management goals and objectives and management actions. The plan is effective for five years and goals/objectives will be reevaluated in 2023. New to the process this year, we incorporated a Fisheries Input Group (FIG) to provide perspectives and angler expectations. The FIG included 14 individuals from various parts of the state and representing different interests. In the end, a revised management plan was produced that went out for public input. The final plan can be found at: https://files.dnr.state.mn.us/fisheries/largelakes/low/low_plan.pdf <br> \n <br> \nThe largest and most important lakes in Minnesota are sampled every year, in order to closely monitor their fish populations.  Lake of the Woods is one of the large lakes included in this Large Lake Sampling Program.  These lakes are at least 15,000 acres in size, and typically support the best Walleye fisheries in the state. Anglers fish the Minnesota portion of Lake of the Woods for a variety of species, including Walleye, Sauger, Yellow Perch, Northern Pike and Lake Sturgeon.  Due to the importance of Walleye and Sauger, a great deal of population monitoring effort is focused on them.  Overviews of the sampling programs conducted on Lake of the Woods are located on the Baudette Area Fisheries web page, on the MN-DNR web site, at www.mndnr.gov/areas/fisheries/baudette. <br> \n <br> \nThe primary assessment used to monitor fish populations is fall gill net assessment.  This assessment has been annual since 1981, but a comparable assessment was conducted from 1968 through 1970.  From 1968 through 2001, the fall gill net assessment sampled the near-shore waters of Lake of the Woods, from 6 to 25 feet in depth.  In 2002 off-shore nets were added to the assessment. The off-shore nets sample water from 32 to 35 feet deep.  There are differences in the size structure and abundance of fish species in the near-shore and off-shore samples.   <br> \n <br> \nWalleye <br> \n <br> \nSince 2002, the average Walleye catch rate or catch per unit effort (CPUE) is 16.9 fish/net (both near and off-shore nets combined). The 2020 CPUE was 12.8 fish/net and down from 2019 (18.3 fish/net). The current 3-year average for CPUE is 15.5 fish/net and exceeds the 2018-2023 management goal ~ 14 fish/net. Gill net sampled Walleye ranged in length from 6.4 to 29 inches with an average length of 12.9 inches. Small Walleye (< 11 inches) were above average, while keeper-sized Walleye (14 to 19 inches) were below the historic average. Walleye 12 to 14 inches were well below historic levels and is the result of the 2016 and 2017 year-classes being of moderate strength. Lastly, the 2018-2023 fisheries management plan calls for the annual percentage of gill net sampled Walleye over 20 inches to be 5 to 15%  of the total catch. In 2020, over 15% the Walleye sampled were 20 inches or larger.  <br> \n <br> \nSauger <br> \n <br> \nIn 2020, Sauger gill net CPUE was 25.7 fish/net and the current 3-year average (24.6 fish/net) exceeds the 2018-2023 management goal of ~ 16 fish/net. Above average Sauger abundance experienced the past few years is the result of strong year-classes being produced in 2011 and from 2014-2016. Year-classes produced in 2018 and 2019 are predicted to be weak and moderate in strength. Sauger sampled in 2020, ranged in length from 3 to 18 inches with an average length of 11 inches. Sauger from 11 to 18 inches are at or exceed historic levels, while fish < 10 inches were below average due to poor recruitment noted in 2018. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike <br> \n <br> \nLake of the Woods is managed for a high-quality Northern Pike population, with a significant component of \"trophy\" Northern Pike over 40 inches long.  To monitor the size structure of the Northern Pike population, it is sampled every 5 years using trap nets at known spawning sites. Trap netting conducted in 2016 and 2017 revealed a high-quality size structure for all sampled tributaries to Lake of the Woods and Rainy River. Fall gill netting in 2020 sampled Northern Pike from 15 to 43 inches with an average length of 24 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch are often not targeted by anglers fishing Lake of the Woods, but caught incidentally fishing for Walleye and Sauger.  Under the current fisheries management plan for 2018-2023 no population level goals are set for Yellow Perch, but are of management interest. Results from 2020 indicate perch near-shore abundance is below the 10-year average and was the second lowest observed since 2010. Catch rates for Yellow Perch are highly variable, but have slightly declined since the early 1990s. Yellow Perch ranged in length from 5 to nearly 14 inches with an average length of 9 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nLake Sturgeon <br> \n <br> \nSince 2004, spawning Lake Sturgeon are sampled annually on the Rapid River (a tributary to the Rainy River). Over the past 15 years there has been an overall increase in mean length and greater proportion of \"large\" sturgeon in the sampled population. In addition to obtaining lengths, sampled Lake Sturgeon are tagged with a unique number at the base of the dorsal fin. This information has revealed that males typically spawn every 2 to 3 years (in some cases annually) and females spawn every 4 to 9 years. In total nearly 2,000 fish have been tagged at the Rapid River and over 9,000 have been tagged system-wide since the inception of the tagging program. In addition to natural resource sampling, nearly 200 tag returns are reported annually by anglers. This information provides information on movement patterns, spawning occurrence, growth, and harvest metrics. <br> \n <br> \nIn order to harvest a Lake Sturgeon, anglers must purchase a harvest tag.  However no tag is required to fish catch-and-release for Lake Sturgeon.  Anglers may harvest one Lake Sturgeon per calendar year.  A sturgeon must be between 45 and 50 inches (inclusive) or longer than 75 inches to be legal to harvest.  All other sturgeon must be immediately released.  The Lake Sturgeon harvest season is from April 24 to May 7, and from July 1 to September 30.  The catch and release only season is from May 8 to May 15, and from October 1 through April 23.  You may not fish for Lake Sturgeon during the closed season (May 16 to June 30). <br> \n <br> \nFor more information about Lake Sturgeon angling please see: <br> \nhttps://www.dnr.state.mn.us/areas/fisheries/baudette/lowregs.html  <br> \n <br> \nTo report a tagged Lake Sturgeon please see: <br> \nhttps://www.dnr.state.mn.us/fisheries/tagged_fish_reporting/index.html  <br> \n <br> \nInfested Waters Designation  <br> \n <br> \nLake of the Woods and the Rainy River have received an infested waters designation due to the presence of Spiny Water Flea and Zebra Mussel. Spiny Water Flea was first documented in the late 2000s in the Minnesota waters of Lake of the Woods. In 2019, Zebra Mussel veligers (lavae) were sampled by fisheries staff in Muskeg Bay and is the first occurrence of this AIS (aquatic invasive species) in the Minnesota waters of Lake of the Woods. No adult Zebra Mussel were observed in 2020.  <br> \n <br> \nAt this date, the most immediate impact of Spiny Water Flea has been to human users of the lake and river. Emerald shiner is a popular bait fish on Lake of the Woods. Local bait shops and resorts have had significant businesses harvesting bait within the system. There is concern that Spiny Water Flea eggs may be ingested by small fish, and that Spiny Water Flea may then be spread through the bait fish distribution. To deal with this potential issue, a prohibition against bait collection, by non-permitted individuals, has been enacted. Trained and licensed bait dealers may still collect bait fish from infested waters, but the collected bait must be handled to allow the fish to purge any eggs they may have ingested. <br> \n  <br> \nRusty Crayfish, a native of the Ohio River system, have been established in parts of the Ontario portion of Lake of the Woods since the late 1960s, but have been present in the Minnesota portion of Lake of the Woods only since 2006. At this point Rusty Crayfish are present in fairly low densities, but are continuing to expand south. Last fall they were found from the Northwest Angle, south to Pine Island in addition to the Rainy River. Densities of Rusty Crayfish decline substantially from the Northwest Angle south. Rusty Crayfish have displaced the native crayfish within 2 years of colonizing an area, and have been associated with declines in aquatic vegetation when they become established. <br> \n</p>",

Recruitment appears to be stable as three successive year classes are present in the catch; the strong 1987 year class, and the moderate 1988 and 1989 year classes.  Sauger catch per unit effort increased from 1989 due to recruitment of the strong 1989 year class to the index nets.  Yellow Perch and White Sucker catch per unit effort is above the long-term (1980-89) mean for both species.  Northern Pike catch per unit effort decreased slightly from 1989.  The 1990 index netting results indicate that fish populations are stable.</p>",

The very strong 1987 year class has entered the fishery.  This fall's gillnetting effort had the highest catch of young of year Walleye since this program was initiated in 1980.  Though the number of young of year Walleye caught in the fall are not a sensitive indicator of year class strength they probably do indicate when a strong year class has been produced.  Sauger have a number of year classes represented in the sampling.  Northern Pike appear to have had several poor year classes, likely as a result of the past drought.  The return to a wet cycle will probably help Northern Pike recruitment.  Large Norther Pike remain fairly abundant in fall sampling.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>The Walleye population is in very good shape with about 15 age groups represented annually.  Walleye from the very strong 1991 year class averaged 17-18 inches in length in the fall gill net assessment.  The 1992 and 1993 year classes are weak. This weakness is manifested as a dip in the fall gill net sample length frequency in the 13-16 inch intervals.  Based on young of year assessment, year classes produced in 1994 and 1995 are projected to be strong and moderate, respectively.  Due to poor growth during the summer of 1996, the 1996 year class is projected to be virtually non-existent.The Sauger population is characterized by highly variable recruitment.  This appears to be the norm for Sauger on Lake of the Woods.  The portion of the population recruited to the fishery is dominated by the strong year classes produced in 1989 and 1990.  The bulk of these fish range from 12 to 14 inches in length in the fall gill net assessment.  It appears that the 1993 and 1994 year classes are moderate to moderately strong.  Sauger from these year classes range from 9-12 inches, total length, with the peak in the 10 inch interval.  The bulk of these Sauger are not of a size that anglers will readily harvest. Unlike Walleye, we have not yet developed a way of predicting year class strength based on young of year sampling.Northern Pike are not sampled very effectively with standard lake assessment gill nets.  In the 1983 to 1994 fall gill net assessment, Northern Pike catch per unit effort has ranged from 0.8 to 2.7 with a 10 year average of 1.5.  The problem of small sample size has been addressed with a spring survey, using trap nets.  Spring trap net spawning run assessment depicts a very high quality Northern Pike population.  In 1995 the spawning run assessment was expanded to tag up to 1,500 Northern Pike.  The primary purpose of this study was to determine if the population of Northern Pike using streams in Minnesota as spawning sites were an exclusively Minnesota stock or if the stock is shared with the province of Manitoba and/or Ontario.  In 1995, 15 percent of 1,432 tagged pike exceeded 30 inches.  Approximately two percent of tagged Northern Pike exceeded 40 inches.  Preliminary tag return data suggests that the Northern Pike that spawn in Rainy River tributary streams spend their time in the Rainy River and are a distinct stock from the pike that spawn in Lake of the Woods tributaries. Rainy River tributary streams, as a group, have significantly smaller average lengths than any of all of the other sites at which Northern Pike are tagged. Zipple Bay and Warroad River stood out as sites from which a lot of tags were returned.  These are areas that have a relatively high proportion of targeted Northern Pike effort.Two creel surveys were conducted on Lake of the Woods this past summer.  The annual south shore creel survey monitors summer harvest by anglers based on the south shore of Lake of the Woods, from Baudette to Springsteel Island, just north of Warroad.  Neither catch per unit of effort (cpue) nor length frequency of harvested Walleye is available from this creel survey.The primary objective of the northwest angle creel survey is to monitor the harvest of Walleye, by Minnesota based anglers, in the province of Ontario.  Ontario would like to restrict the walleye harvest by Minnesota based anglers to 8,000 pounds.  The 1995 Ontario harvest of Walleye by Minnesota based anglers was 20,075 pounds.  This is a substantial increase in harvest from that measured in 1994 (9,394 pounds).  In 1996, Minnesota based anglers harvested 25,396 pounds of walleye in Ontario.  The average walleye harvest in Ontario, by Minnesota based anglers, for the three years of the creel survey is 18,288 pounds.  I feel that the 1994 harvest was influenced by a lot of negative publicity so anglers, that would normally have fished the area, stayed away.  It is reasonable to expect that the average Minnesota based harvest of walleye in Ontario will range from 20,000 to 25,000 pounds in the future.  At the 1996 border waters meeting, the Ontario contingent did not indicate if they would pursue any additional restrictions on Minnesota based anglers to try to reduce harvest to the harvest goal.  Minnesota based anglers also harvest an average of about 20,000 pounds of walleye from the Minnesota waters of Lake of the Woods.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Physical Description  <br> \n <br> \nLake of the Woods straddles the Canada-United States border, and is shared between the Canadian provinces of Manitoba and Ontario, and the U. S. state of Minnesota.  Water level is directly controlled through three hydroelectric dams located at the head of the Winnipeg River in Kenora, Ontario. The Rainy River provides 75% of the inflow to the lake.  <br> \n <br> \nThe lake is comprised of several distinct basins.  Minnesota portion of Lake of the Woods (just over 300,000 acres) lies within Muskeg Bay, Big Traverse Bay and Little Traverse Bay.  Big Traverse Bay and Muskeg Bay are largely devoid of bottom structure and islands.  Little Traverse Bay is more characteristic of the Ontario portion of Lake of the Woods, with numerous islands and reefs.  These three basins do not stratify and in most years have widespread, dense, blue-green algae blooms that are first evident in July and continue through October. <br> \n <br> \nFisheries Management <br> \n <br> \nIn December of 2017, DNR Fisheries in Baudette began a management plan review/revision for Lake of the Woods. Stated within the fisheries management plan is a brief background of management history, series of management goals and objectives and management actions. The plan is effective for five years and goals/objectives will be reevaluated in 2023. New to the process this year, we incorporated a Fisheries Input Group (FIG) to provide perspectives and angler expectations. The FIG included 14 individuals from various parts of the state and representing different interests. In the end, a revised management plan was produced that went out for public input. The final plan can be found at: https://files.dnr.state.mn.us/fisheries/largelakes/low/low_plan.pdf <br> \n <br> \nThe largest and most important lakes in Minnesota are sampled every year, in order to closely monitor their fish populations.  Lake of the Woods is one of the large lakes included in this Large Lake Sampling Program.  These lakes are at least 15,000 acres in size, and typically support the best Walleye fisheries in the state. Anglers fish the Minnesota portion of Lake of the Woods for a variety of species, including Walleye, Sauger, Yellow Perch, Northern Pike and Lake Sturgeon.  Due to the importance of Walleye and Sauger, a great deal of population monitoring effort is focused on them.  Overviews of the sampling programs conducted on Lake of the Woods are located on the Baudette Area Fisheries web page, on the MN-DNR web site, at www.mndnr.gov/areas/fisheries/baudette. <br> \n <br> \nThe primary assessment used to monitor fish populations is fall gill net assessment.  This assessment has been annual since 1981, but a comparable assessment was conducted from 1968 through 1970.  From 1968 through 2001, the fall gill net assessment sampled the near-shore waters of Lake of the Woods, from 6 to 25 feet in depth.  In 2002 off-shore nets were added to the assessment. The off-shore nets sample water from 32 to 35 feet deep.  There are differences in the size structure and abundance of fish species in the near-shore and off-shore samples.   <br> \n <br> \nWalleye <br> \n <br> \nSince 2002, the average Walleye catch rate or catch per unit effort (CPUE) is 16.9 fish/net (both near and off-shore nets combined). The 2019 CPUE was 18.3 fish/net and up from 2018 (15.3 fish/net) and exceeded the 2018-2023 management goal ~ 14 fish/net. Gill net sampled Walleye ranged in length from 5.8 to 30 inches with an average length of 13.5 inches. Small Walleye (< 14 inches) were near the average, while keeper-sized Walleye (14 to 19 inches) were above the historic average. Walleye 11 to 13 inches were below historic levels and is the result of the 2016 and 2017 year-classes being of moderate strength. Lastly, the 2018-2023 fisheries management plan calls for the annual percentage of gill net sampled Walleye over 20 inches to be 5 to 15%  of the total catch. In 2019, over 20% the Walleye sampled were 20 inches or larger.  <br> \n <br> \nSauger <br> \n <br> \nIn 2019, Sauger gill net CPUE was 22.2 fish/net and exceeds the 2018-2023 management goal of ~ 16 fish/net. Above average Sauger abundance experienced the past few years is the result of strong year-classes being produced in 2011 and from 2014-2016. Year-classes produced in 2018 and 2019 are predicted to be weak and moderate in strength. Sauger sampled in 2019, ranged in length from 7 to 18 inches with an average length of 12 inches. Sauger from 10 to 18 inches are at or exceed historic levels, while fish < 10 inches were below average due to poor recruitment noted in 2018. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike <br> \n <br> \nLake of the Woods is managed for a high-quality Northern Pike population, with a significant component of \"trophy\" Northern Pike over 40 inches long.  To monitor the size structure of the Northern Pike population, it is sampled every 5 years using trap nets at known spawning sites. Trap netting conducted in 2016 and 2017 revealed a high-quality size structure for all sampled tributaries to Lake of the Woods and Rainy River. Fall gill netting in 2019 sampled Northern Pike from 16.3 to 44.8 inches with an average length of 27 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch are often not targeted by anglers fishing Lake of the Woods, but caught incidentally fishing for Walleye and Sauger.  Under the current fisheries management plan for 2018-2023 no population level goals are set for Yellow Perch, but are of management interest. Results from 2019 indicate perch near-shore abundance is below the 10-year average and was the lowest observed since 2010. Catch rates for Yellow Perch are highly variable, but have slightly declined since the early 1990s. Yellow Perch ranged in length from 5 to nearly 14 inches with an average length of 9 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nLake Sturgeon <br> \n <br> \nSince 2004, spawning Lake Sturgeon are sampled annually on the Rapid River (a tributary to the Rainy River). Over the past 15 years there has been an overall increase in mean length and greater proportion of \"large\" sturgeon in the sampled population. In addition to obtaining lengths, sampled Lake Sturgeon are tagged with a unique number at the base of the dorsal fin. This information has revealed that males typically spawn every 2 to 3 years (in some cases annually) and females spawn every 4 to 9 years. In total nearly 2,000 fish have been tagged at the Rapid River and over 9,000 have been tagged system-wide since the inception of the tagging program. In addition to natural resource sampling, nearly 200 tag returns are reported annually by anglers. This information provides information on movement patterns, spawning occurrence, growth, and harvest metrics. <br> \n <br> \nIn order to harvest a Lake Sturgeon, anglers must purchase a harvest tag.  However no tag is required to fish catch-and-release for Lake Sturgeon.  Anglers may harvest one Lake Sturgeon per calendar year.  A sturgeon must be between 45 and 50 inches (inclusive) or longer than 75 inches to be legal to harvest.  All other sturgeon must be immediately released.  The Lake Sturgeon harvest season is from April 24 to May 7, and from July 1 to September 30.  The catch and release only season is from May 8 to May 15, and from October 1 through April 23.  You may not fish for Lake Sturgeon during the closed season (May 16 to June 30). <br> \n <br> \nFor more information about Lake Sturgeon angling please see: <br> \nhttps://www.dnr.state.mn.us/areas/fisheries/baudette/lowregs.html  <br> \nTo report a tagged Lake Sturgeon please see: <br> \nhttps://www.dnr.state.mn.us/fisheries/tagged_fish_reporting/index.html  <br> \n <br> \nInfested Waters Designation  <br> \n <br> \nLake of the Woods and the Rainy River have received an infested waters designation due to the presence of Spiny Water Flea and Zebra Mussel. Spiny Water Flea was first documented in the late 2000s in the Minnesota waters of Lake of the Woods. In 2019, Zebra Mussel veligers (lavae) were sampled by fisheries staff in Muskeg Bay and is the first occurrence of this AIS (aquatic invasive species) in the Minnesota waters of Lake of the Woods. No adult Zebra Mussel were observed in 2018.  <br> \n <br> \nAt this date, the most immediate impact of Spiny Water Flea has been to human users of the lake and river. Emerald shiner is a popular bait fish on Lake of the Woods. Local bait shops and resorts have had significant businesses harvesting bait within the system. There is concern that Spiny Water Flea eggs may be ingested by small fish, and that Spiny Water Flea may then be spread through the bait fish distribution. To deal with this potential issue, a prohibition against bait collection, by non-permitted individuals, has been enacted. Trained and licensed bait dealers may still collect bait fish from infested waters, but the collected bait must be handled to allow the fish to purge any eggs they may have ingested.  <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nRusty Crayfish, a native of the Ohio River system, have been established in parts of the Ontario portion of Lake of the Woods since the late 1960s, but have been present in the Minnesota portion of Lake of the Woods only since 2006. At this point Rusty Crayfish are present in fairly low densities, but are continuing to expand south. Last fall they were found from the Northwest Angle, south to Pine Island in addition to the Rainy River. Densities of Rusty Crayfish decline substantially from the Northwest Angle south. Rusty Crayfish have displaced the native crayfish within 2 years of colonizing an area, and have been associated with declines in aquatic vegetation when they become established. <br> \n</p>",
