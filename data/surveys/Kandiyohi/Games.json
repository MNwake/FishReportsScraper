                "narrative": "<p>A resurvey of the fish population was conducted on Games Lake in July of 2001. Games is a moderately sized lake located in Kandiyohi County. Water quality and clarity is good in Games. Aquatic vegetation is varied and abundant within the lake. The watershed \"Upper Shakopee Creek Watershed\" includes Norway Lake upstream of Games and several downstream connected lakes (Henchien, Middle, Andrew, Florida). The watershed is varied with hardwoods, wetlands, agricultural row crops, feedlots, grasslands, and residential homes. An intensive watershed study of water flow and nutrient runoff was conducted on Andrew, Games, and Norway Lakes in addition to associated inlets from 1996-1998. Presently, a group of private landowners and public conservation agency personnel are involved in the Shakopee Creek Headwaters Watershed Project which encourages landowners to implement best management practices through grant funding, utilizing existing government programs, education, and technical assistance. The DNR Spicer Fisheries Office manages Games for a variety of fish species that include northern pike, largemouth bass, black crappie, bluegill, yellow perch, and walleye. Black crappie numbers were moderate in 2001 (4.8 fish/gillnet) and similar to the historical average (4.6 fish/gillnet). The 2001 black crappie average size was small (0.13 lbs. and 5.4 inches from gillnets). Approximately 66% of the black crappie captured in the 2001 survey were young fish hatched in 2000. Black crappie growth rates in Games were below average for fish 2 years and younger, but average for fish 3-4 years old compared to Spicer Area lakes. The largest black crappie captured in the 2001 survey was 10.9 inches. Local anglers have reported good success for catching black crappie during the springs and winters of recent years.Bluegill numbers were moderate in 2001 (32.9 fish/trapnet) and similar to the historical average (33.7 fish/trapnet). The 2001 bluegill average size was small (0.08 lbs. and 4.6 inches from trapnets). Bluegill growth rates in Games were below average for fish 3 years and younger, but above average for fish 4 to 6 years old compared to Spicer Area lakes. The largest bluegill captured in the 2001 survey was 7.7 inches. A spring electrofishing survey of largemouth bass in Games was not conducted during 2001 due to time constraints. However, largemouth bass numbers were moderate in a recent 1998 spring electrofishing survey (31.2 fish/hour, average size=0.56 lbs.).Northern pike numbers were moderate to high in 2001 (7.8 fish/gillnet), and similar to historical average (7.1 fish/gillnet). The 2001 northern pike average size was moderate (2.41 lbs. and 21.8 inches from gillnets). Northern pike growth rates in Games were below average compared to Spicer Area lakes. The largest northern pike captured in the 2001 survey was 31.5 inches. Walleye numbers were low in 2001 (1.8 fish/gillnet) and similar to the historical average (2.1 fish/gillnet). The 2001 walleye average size was moderate (1.71 lbs. and 16.6 inches from gillnets). Walleye growth rates in Games were average compared to Spicer Area lakes. The largest walleye captured in the 2001 survey was 26.8 inches. Walleye natural reproduction is generally insignificant during most years in Games; however, walleye can move into Games from connected Norway Lake where natural reproduction occurs frequently.Yellow perch numbers were moderate in 2001 (22.8 fish/gillnet), but slightly below the historical average (25.2 fish/gillnet). The 2001 yellow perch average size was small (0.11 lbs. and 6.2 inches from gillnets). Other notable fish species captured in the Games 2001 summer survey included high numbers of freshwater drum \"sheephead\" (14.4 fish/gillnet) and low numbers of black bullhead (1.4 fish/gillnet. Historical average catch rates were 6.1 fish/gillnet for freshwater drum and 2.1 fish/gillnet for black bullhead. Current fish management activities on Games include protecting the important aquatic vegetation habitat through the permit process, participating in the Shakopee Creek Headwaters Watershed Project, and stocking walleye fingerlings in conjunction with Norway Lake. The Games Lake fishery will be surveyed again in the spring and summer of 2005.</p>",

Kandiyohi County Park #7 is located along the southeast shoreline. Residential development (89 homes) has occurred throughout the entire shoreline area with the exception of small portions of the south side, north side, and northwest bay. Two public access sites are present with one along the east side (DNR access) and another on the southeast side (county access). A channel is present between Norway Lake and Games Lake that is conducive to boat navigation. An aquatic management area is located along the north shore. There are seven small inlets, a large inlet that connects Norway to Games and an outlet (east side). Games Lake is connected to several periodic winterkill (Swan, Henchien) and non-winterkill lakes (Andrew) via the outlet which eventually becomes Shakopee Creek. Water levels were normal in Games Lake during the mid summer of 2010. The immediate watershed consists of agricultural row crops, hardwood stands, wetlands, and residential development. Water clarity (secchi=5.0 feet) was fair to poor for Games in July of 2010. Nutrient levels were low (total phosphorus=0.016 ppm, Chlorophyll-a=7.1 ppb) during June of 2010. Dissolved oxygen levels were above 5.0 ppm to depths of 22 feet. Emergent vegetation densities (bulrush, cattails, burreed, arrowhead) are low to moderate in Games Lake occurring mostly in northwest shore, bay and east shore areas. Submergent vegetation densities within the lake are moderately abundant within the littoral zone (< 15 feet deep) areas. Various submergent vegetation species (bladderwort, clasping-leaf pondweed, flat-stem pondweed, chara, coontail, wild celery, sago pondweed, northern milfoil, etc.) were found in Games during 2010. Shoalwater substrates consisted mostly of sand, gravel, rubble and silt. Games Lake is managed primarily for northern pike, largemouth bass, black crappie, walleye, and bluegill. Walleye stockings (primarily fingerlings) are scheduled for every other year in Games Lake.  <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie numbers were low in 2010 (2.40 fish/trapnet) compared to the normal range for Games Lake. The black crappie gillnet historical average catch rate was 5.43 fish/trapnet for Games Lake. The 2010 black crappie average size was moderate (0.34 pounds and 7.69 inches) from trapnets. The black crappie historical average weight is 0.29 pounds from trapnets. The 2010 catch rate of quality size (8.00 inches) and larger black crappie was low (1.00 fish/trapnet) in Games Lake. Black crappie growth rates in Games Lake were generally below the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-4 and within or above at the normal ranges for ages 5-8. The 2008 black crappie year class comprised 39% of black crappie gillnet and trapnet catch in the 2010. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike numbers were low in 2010 (1.80 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal ranges for Games Lake and similar lakes. The northern pike historical average catch rate is 7.14 fish/gillnet for Games Lake. The 2010 northern pike average size was moderate to small (2.51 pounds and 22.66 inches) from gillnets. The northern pike historical average weight is 2.48 pounds from gillnets. The 2010 catch rate of quality size (21.00 inches) and larger northern pike was low (1.40 fish/gillnet) in Games Lake. Northern pike growth rates in Games Lake were generally below the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-6. The 2008 and 2005 northern pike year classes each comprised 31% of the northern pike gillnet and trapnet catch in 2010.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch numbers were moderate in 2010 (20.20 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range for Games Lake and similar lakes. The yellow perch historical average catch rate is 24.42 fish/gillnet for Games Lake. The 2010 yellow perch average size was small (0.09 pounds and 5.98 inches) from gillnets. The yellow perch historical average weight is 0.10 pounds. Yellow perch growth rates were near the lower end of the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-4. The 2008 yellow perch year class comprised 82% of the yellow perch gillnet and trapnet catch in 2010. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye numbers were moderately abundant in 2010 (3.20 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range for Games Lake, but below the normal range for similar lakes. The walleye historical average catch rate is 2.19 fish/gillnet for Games Lake. The 2010 walleye average size was small (0.74 pounds and 12.32 inches) from gillnets. The walleye historical average weight is 1.78 pounds from gillnets. The 2010 catch rate of quality size (15.00 inches) and larger walleye was low (0.80 fish/gillnet) in Games Lake. Walleye growth rates in Games Lake were within the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-5, but above the normal ranges for ages 6-7. The walleye population in Games Lake is due primarily to stocking. Games Lake was recently stocked with walleye in 2007 (5,179 fingerlings, 231 pounds; 683 yearlings, 253 pounds) and 2009 (3,656 fingerlings, 488 pounds). The 2009 and 2007 year classes comprised 48% and 29% respectively of the walleye gillnet and trapnet catch in 2010.  <br> \n <br> \nBluegill numbers were abundant in 2010 (44.50 fish/trapnet) compared to the normal ranges for Games and similar lakes. The bluegill historical average catch rate is 38.92 fish/trapnet in Games Lake. The 2010 bluegill average size was small (0.08 pounds and 4.58 inches) from trapnets. The bluegill historical average weight is 0.11 pounds from trapnets. The 2010 catch rate of quality size (6.00 inches) and larger bluegill was low (4.78 fish/trapnet) in Games Lake. Bluegill growth rates were below the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-3, within the normal ranges for ages 4-6 and above the normal ranges for ages 7-8. The 2008 and 2007 year classes comprised 54% and 35% of the bluegill gillnet and trapnet catch in 2010.  <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass numbers were moderate in 2010 (30.37 fish/hour) compared to the Games Lake historical average (27.66 fish/hour) from spring electrofishing, but below the Spicer Area historical average (46.04 fish/hour). The 2010 largemouth bass average size was moderate (0.94 pounds and 10.99 inches) from spring electrofishing. The largemouth bass historical average weight is 0.83 pounds. The catch rate of quality size (12.00 inches) and larger fish was moderate (14.07 fish/hour) in the 2010 spring electrofishing survey. Largemouth bass growth rates were generally near the lower end of the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-6 and below the normal ranges for ages 7-8. The 2008 and 2004 largemouth bass year classes each comprised 20% of the 2010 spring electrofishing catch. <br> \n <br> \nFreshwater drum numbers were abundant in 2010 (13.00 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal ranges for Games Lake and similar lakes. The freshwater drum historical average catch rate is 7.26 fish/gillnet for Games Lake. The 2010 freshwater drum average size was moderate (1.30 pounds and 14.44 inches) from gillnets. The freshwater drum historical average weight is 1.57 pounds from gillnets. <br> \n <br> \nCurrent fish management activities on Games Lake include monitoring the fish population on a periodic basis, protecting aquatic vegetation through the permit process, assisting aquatic plant management and enforcement personnel in educating boaters and monitoring access sites for potential invasive species introductions, participating in local watershed initiatives, and stocking various fish species as warranted. The Games Lake fishery will be surveyed in the 2015 spring for largemouth bass and 2015 summer for all fish species. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Games is a moderately deep and sized lake located in Kandiyohi County. Water quality isusually good throughout the summer months. Nutrient productivity is moderate in Games.Aquatic vegetation densities were moderate in 1998. The water clarity was poor on July 13,1998 due to excessive rainfall/runoff events occurring the previous two weeks in late Juneand early July of 1998. Games is a popular recreational lake in Kandiyohi County. A countypark is located along the southeast shore. Water flows into the south side of Games fromNorway via a narrow navigable inlet. Games is a popular largemouth bass, black crappie,bluegill, and northern pike fishery. Walleye also provide anglers with additional anglingopportunities. Games was stocked with adult winter rescue northern pike (260 fish, 242 lbs.)on December 11, 1995. Walleye fingerlings (3,946 fish, 265 lbs.) were last stocked in the1993 fall. Walleye natural reproduction was documented in 1995 (20.0 young of year\"YOY\"/hour), but it is often sporadic with minimal success. In addition to walleye naturalreproduction, Games may receive limited walleye numbers by immigration into Games fromNorway. Games Lake is part of the Shakopee Creek Watershed. Presently, a water quality andflow study \"Shakopee Creek Headwaters Project\" is being conducted on various inlets andoutlets of Norway, Games, and Andrew Lakes. The goals of the Shakopee Creek HeadwatersProject are to identify high nutrient runoff sources and provide incentives for privatelandowners to implement best management practices within the watershed.     Largemouth bass were abundant in the 1998 spring electrofishing survey (31.20 fish/hour)compared to the historical average (26.98 fish/hour). The 1998 largemouth bass average weight(0.56 lbs.) was small. The largest bass captured during the 1998 spring electrofishing surveywas 15.7 inches. The 1996 year class comprised 74% of the 1998 spring electrofishing catch.     Black crappie were moderately abundant in 1998 (6.60 fish/trapnet), and similar to thehistorical average (6.66 fish/trapnet). The 1998 black crappie trapnet average weight was0.34 lbs. The largest black crappie captured in the 1998 survey was 11.8 inches. The 1996black crappie year class comprised 77% of the 1998 black crappie survey catch.     Bluegill numbers were below normal in 1998 (15.40 fish/trapnet) compared to similarlakes (4.39 - 48.97 fish/trapnet) and below the historical average (40.74 fish/trapnet). The1998 bluegill average length (4.7 inches, trapnets) was small. The largest bluegill capturedduring the 1998 survey was 6.9 inches. The 1996 bluegill year class comprised 63% of the 1998bluegill survey catch.     Northern pike were abundant in 1998 (11.80 fish/gillnet), but the average size was small(19.7 inches and 2.14 lbs., gillnets). The largest northern pike captured during the 1998survey was 37.0 inches. The 1997 northern pike year class comprised 63% of the 1998 northernpike survey catch.     Walleye were moderately abundant in 1998 (5.00 fish/gillnet). The 1998 walleye averagelength (14.8 inches, gillnets and trapnets combined) was below the historical average (16.4inches). The largest walleye captured during the 1998 survey was 25.6 inches. The 1996walleye year class (due to natural reproduction) comprised 65% of the 1998 walleye surveycatch. Walleye natural reproduction success was also good in other local lakes during 1996.     Other fish species such as yellow perch and freshwater drum were moderately abundant in1998. The yellow perch average size was small (5.7 inches, gillnets), but the freshewaterdrum average size was large (2.07 lbs., gillnets).     Presently, Games has a diverse and good fishery. Black crappie fishing was excellentduring the 1998-99 winter. Local residents also reported good bluegill fishing during the1998 summer. Northern pike fishing should be good during the next few years. The DNR SpicerFisheries Office will continue to participate with other agencies and private individuals inthe completion of the Shakopee Creek Headwaters Project. We will also monitor adult fishpopulation numbers every four years by summer test netting and spring electrofishing, and YOYwalleye numbers by fall night electrofishing prior to any scheduled walleye fingerlingstocking in order to evaluate management practices on Games.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A fish population assessment of Games Lake was conducted in July of 2005. Games Lake is a moderately sized (515 acres), moderately deep (42 feet maximum), and low to moderately productive lake located in Kandiyohi County. Kandiyohi County Park #7 is located along the southeast shoreline. Residential development has occurred throughout the entire shoreline area with the exception of small portions of the south side, north side, and northwest bay. Two public access sites are present on Games Lake with one along the east side (DNR boat access) and one on the southeast side (county access). A channel is present between Norway Lake and Games Lake that is conducive to boat navigation. Emergent vegetation (bulrush) is moderate in Games Lake (northwest shore and bay areas, east shore areas). Submergent vegetation densities within the lake are moderately abundant within the littoral zone areas. Games Lake is connected to several periodic winterkill (Swan, Henchien) and non-winterkill lakes (Norway, Andrew) via the Shakopee Creek and various small inlets. Water clarity (secchi=8.5 feet) was good in 2005. Games Lake is managed primarily for northern pike, largemouth bass, black crappie, walleye, and bluegill. Walleye stockings (primarily fingerlings) are scheduled for every other year in Games Lake. Black crappie numbers were abundant in 2005 (3.30 fish/trapnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes, but low to moderate compared to the historical average catch rate (5.73 fish/trapnet) for Games Lake. The 2005 black crappie average size was moderate (0.42 pounds and 8.8 inches) from trapnets. The black crappie historical average weight is 0.28 pounds from trapnets. The 2005 catch rate of quality size (8.0 inches) and larger black crappie was high (2.90 fish/trapnet) in Games Lake. Black crappie growth rates in Games Lake were above the Spicer Area normal ranges. The 2001 black crappie year class comprised 52% of black crappie captured in the 2005 assessment.Northern pike numbers were moderate in 2005 (7.40 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes. The northern pike historical average catch rate is 7.14 fish/gillnet for Games Lake. The 2005 northern pike average size was moderate (2.37 pounds and 22.0 inches) from gillnets. The northern pike historical average weight is 2.47 pounds from gillnets. The 2005 catch rate of quality size (21.0 inches) and larger northern pike was high (4.00 fish/gillnet) in Games Lake. Northern pike growth rates in Games Lake were generally below the Spicer Area normal ranges. The 2002 and 2001 northern pike year classes each comprised 32% of the northern pike caught in the 2005 assessment. Yellow perch numbers were low in 2005 (7.80 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes. The yellow perch historical average catch rate is 24.84 fish/gillnet for Games Lake. The 2005 yellow perch average size was small (0.08 pounds and 5.7 inches) from gillnets. The yellow perch historical average weight is 0.10 pounds. Walleye numbers were low in 2005 (1.60 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes. The walleye historical average catch rate is 2.08 fish/gillnet for Games Lake. The 2005 walleye average size was moderate to large (2.10 pounds and 17.3 inches) from gillnets. The walleye historical average weight is 1.78 pounds from gillnets. Walleye growth rates in Games Lake were below the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-4, but within the normal ranges for ages 5-8. The walleye population in Games Lake is due primarily to stocking. Games Lake was recently stocked with walleye in the 2005 spring (13,453 yearlings, 485 pounds). There were no dominant year classes present in the 2005 assessment. Bluegill numbers were moderate in 2005 (24.80 fish/trapnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes. The bluegill historical average catch rate is 38.36 fish/trapnet in Games Lake. The 2005 bluegill average size was small (0.08 pounds and 4.5 inches) from trapnets. The bluegill historical average weight is 0.11 pounds from trapnets. The 2005 catch rate of quality size (6.0 inches) and larger bluegill was moderate (3.39 fish/trapnet) for Games Lake. Largemouth bass numbers were low to moderate in 2005 (0.40 fish/trapnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes. The 2005 largemouth bass average size was small (9.4 inches) from trapnets. A spring electrofishing survey was not conducted for largemouth bass in 2005 due to time constraints. The last spring electrofishing survey for largemouth bass in Games Lake was done during 1998. Moderate numbers of largemouth bass were captured in the 1998 spring electrofishing survey (31.20 fish/hour, 9.3 inches average length). The Games Lake spring electrofishing largemouth bass historical averages are 26.98 fish/hour and 10.2 inches average length.Yellow bullhead numbers were abundant in 2005 (11.00 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes. The yellow bullhead historical average catch rate is 4.89 fish/gillnet for Games Lake. The 2005 yellow bullhead average size was large (1.06 pounds and 11.97 inches) from gillnets. The yellow bullhead historical average weight is 0.79 pounds from gillnets.Freshwater drum numbers were abundant in 2005 (11.80 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal ranges for similar lakes. The freshwater drum historical average catch rate is 6.69 fish/gillnet for Games Lake. The 2005 freshwater drum average size was moderate (1.54 pounds and 14.76 inches) from gillnets. The freshwater drum historical average weight is 1.60 pounds from gillnets.Current fish management activities on Games Lake include monitoring the fish population on a periodic basis, protecting aquatic vegetation through the permit process, participating in local watershed initiatives, and stocking various fish species as warranted. The Games Lake fishery will be surveyed in the 2010 spring for largemouth bass and 2010 summer for all fish species.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted fall night electrofishing survey for young of year \"YOY\" (fingerling sized) Walleye on Games was conducted during September 14, 2017. Games is a moderate sized (521 acres), moderate depth (42 feet maximum), moderate water clarity (7.6 feet secchi on 7/14/15), and moderately productive lake located in Kandiyohi County. A popular county camping park is located along the southeast shore. The Norway Lake outlet flows into Games Lake allowing potential fish movement between the two lakes. Submergent and emergent aquatic vegetation species are abundant within Games. Invasive species such as Eurasian Watermilfoil has been present since 2014 in Games and 2001 in upstream Norway Lake. There are generally abundant numbers of Bluegill, Black Crappie, Largemouth Bass and Northern Pike during most years in Games. Northern Pike numbers (2.33 fish/gillnet, 2.6 pounds average weight) were low in Games during the 2015 summer survey. <br> \n <br> \nThe Walleye population in past years for Games was due primarily to fingerling and yearling stockings or movement into Games from Norway based on surveys and historical data review. Natural reproduction was documented in a 1995 fall electrofishing survey (20.00 YOY/hour). Moderate adult Walleye numbers (5.67 fish/gillnet) were caught in the 2015 summer survey. Multiple year classes (2013 and 2011) comprised 58% of the 2015 Walleye summer survey catch. Although past Walleye fingerlings stockings have been successful, a less expensive Walleye fry stocking was attempted in 2017. Additional fry stockings will occur in the near future (2019 and 2021), in order to evaluate a change in Walleye stocking strategies for Games and several other area lakes (Florida, Andrew, Monson and Eagle). Walleye fingerling/yearling stockings are contingent the same year if the fry stockings are unsuccessful as documented by fall electrofishing. Games was recently stocked with Walleye in 2009 (3,656 fingerlings, 488 pounds), 2011 (15,563 fingerlings, 532 pounds; 721 yearlings, 103 pounds), 2013 (14,297 fingerlings, 493 pounds), 2015 (2,524 fingerlings, 204 pounds; 933 yearlings, 557 pounds; 44 adults, 34 pounds) and 2017 (255,002 Spicer strain fry).  <br> \n <br> \nAbundant YOY Walleye numbers (57.00 YOY/hour, 6.05 inches average length) were caught (fry stocked year) in the 2017 fall electrofishing survey. Walleye fry were stocked loose at the Lake Florida public access site, unlike successful (>50 YOY/hour) fry stocked lakes such as Games and Andrew. These successful lakes were stocked by boat with 5-6 jugs (5 gallon size jug containing oxygen, water and fry) in the deeper portion near the middle of the lake during 2017. Predation upon fry by other fish (i.e. Bluegill or other species) may be greater in the near shore areas of moderate to excellent clarity lakes like Andrew, Games and Florida. Both fry stocking methods have been successful in shallow and turbid lakes during the past. No yearling Walleye were caught in Games during 2017. Only one prior fall electrofishing survey was conducted in Games which occurred during 1995 (20 YOY/hour, 7.45 inches).  <br> \n <br> \nCurrent fish management activities on Games include monitoring the fish population on a periodic basis, protecting native aquatic vegetation through the permit process, participating in local watershed initiatives, preventing and educating about the spread of invasive species, and stocking various fish species as warranted. The Games fishery will be surveyed in the 2019 summer for all fish species. <br> \n</p>",

THE 1991 NOP CATCH INDEX (2.25 PER GN) WAS THE LOWEST EVER RECORDED FOR GAMES LAKE AND IS LOWER THAN THE MAJORITY OF OTHER CLASS 24 LAKES.  THE NOP ABUNDANCE APPEARS DEPENDENT ON WINTER RESCUE SUPPLEMENTAL STOCKING (UNAVAILABLE SINCE 1985) AND HIGH WATER LEVELS (FOR UTILIZATION OF AVAILABLE SPAWNING AREAS THAT WERE RATED AS FAIR).  THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE OF A 1990 OR 1989 YEAR-CLASS (1988 AND 1987 APPEAR VERY WEAK).  THE 1991 BLG CATCH INDEX (39.00 PER TN) WAS SIMILAR TO THE MAJORITY OF OTHER CLASS 24 LAKES AND SHOULD BE CONSIDERED MODERATE COMPARED TO PAST SURVEY'S ON GAMES LAKE.  THE SIZE- DISTRIBUTION WAS ALSO MAJORITY OF FISH ON THE SMALL SIDE, BUT WITH GOOD NUMBERS OF BARELY INCHES) AVAILABLE.  THE 1988 AND 1987 BLG YEAR- CLASSES APPEAR DOMINANT AND COULD PROVIDE NUMEROUS FISH GREATER THAN 7 INCHES IN 1992.  THE 1991 SPRING ELECTROFISHING SAMPLE FOR LMB YIELDED 29.60 BASS PER HOUR WHICH WAS SIMILAR TO THE LOCAL MEDIAN, BUT LOWER THAN WHAT WAS EXPECTED GIVEN THE REPUTATION OF THE LAKE FOR GOOD BASS FISHING. THERE WAS A GOOD RANGE OF SIZES REPRESENTED IN THE SAMPLE AND THEY SHOWED AVERAGE GROWTH RATES.  IT IS PROBABLE THAT THE RELATIVE LACK OF WATER LESS THAN 3-5 FEET DEEP AND THE HIGH WATER CLARITY HAMPERS ELECTROFISHING SUCCESS IN THIS LAKE.  THE MAJORITY OF BASS THAT WERE SAMPLED WERE BUNCHED UP WITHIN AND ON THE SHOREWARD SIDE (CALM) OF THE BULRUSH STANDS.  THE 1991 BLC GILLNET CATCH INDEX (1.50 PER SET) WAS THE LOWEST EVER RECORDED FOR GAMES LAKE AND WAS LOWER THAN THE MAJORITY OF OTHER CLASS 24 LAKES.  THE 1991 BLC TRAPNET CATCH INDEX (3.00 PER SET) WAS THE SECOND LOWEST EVER RECORDED FOR GAMES LAKE, BUT WAS SIMILAR TO THE MAJORITY OF OTHER CLASS 24 LAKES.  THE MEAN SIZE PER SAMPLED BLC ALSO WAS SLIGHTLY LOWER FOR THE 1991 SURVEY COMPARED TO PREVIOUS SURVEY'S (SEE HISTORICAL CATCH SUMMARY).  THE MAJORITY OF SAMPLED CRAPPIE WERE FROM THE 1989 YEAR-CLASS (THE ONLY YEAR-CLASS SAMPLED THAT ARCHIEVED EVEN A MODERATE ABUNDANCE) AND WERE BETWEEN 6-8 INCHES LONG.  THE 1991 YEP CATCH INDEX (14.00 PER GN, 1.63 LBS. PER GN) WAS SIMILAR TO THE MAJORITY OF OTHER CLASS 24 LAKES AND IS CONSIDERED MODERATE OR PREVIOUS SURVEY'S.  THE 1991 WAE CATCH INDEX (4.00 PER GN) WAS THE HIGHEST EVER RECORDED FOR GAMES LAKE AND WAS SIMILAR TO THE MAJORITY OF OTHER CLASS 24 LAKES.  THE AVERAGE SIZE OF GN SAMPLED WAE (0.85 LBS. PER FISH) WAS THE LOWEST EVER RECORDED FOR GAMES.  THE MAJORITY OF WAE WERE FROM THE 1989 YEAR-CLASS (STOCKED AS FINGERLINGS) AND SHOULD PROVIDE SOME THE 1991 FRD CATCH INDEX (3.50 PER GN) WAS LOWER THAN THE PREVIOUS SURVEY (1987-11.25 PER GN) AND WAS LOWER THAN THE MAJORITY OF OTHER CLASS 24 LAKES.  ALTHOUGH THEY WERE COMMONLY CAUGHT BY ANGLERS (ESPECIALLY WAE) IN 1991, IT WAS LESS FREQUENT THAN IN THE PREVIOUS COUPLE OF YEARS. THERE APPEARED TO BE NO OTHER IN THE OTHER NON-GAMEFISH SPECIES SAMPLED.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of the nearshore fish community on Games Lake was conducted from August 1-6, 2018 by the Spicer Area Fisheries Office staff. Games is a moderate (521 acres), moderately clear and deep (42 feet maximum) lake with moderate submergent and emergent vegetation located in Kandiyohi County. Zebra mussels are present both upstream (Norway and downstream (Florida). Games is located in the Chippewa River Watershed. Seine hauls were conducted at 9 of 14 Fish-based Index of Biologic Integrity \"FIBI\" stations with a bag seine of 50 foot width and 1/8 inch bar mesh in depths of 3.5 feet or less. Seine hauls were also conducted at 2 stations with a bag seine of 15 foot width and 1/8 inch bar mesh in depths of 3.5 feet or less. Near shore electrofishing was conducted at all 14 FIBI Stations with a back-pack unit in water depths generally less than 2 feet deep. The 14 FIBI Stations were spaced equally apart around the entire shoreline of the lake in a variety of near shore habitats. Each station was approximately 100 feet long. Two back-pack electrofishing runs were conducted with the initial run of 100 feet near the shore-water interface in depths of < 1 foot and the second run of 100 feet long about 10-20 feet from shore in depths up to 2 feet. Three stations were not sampled (S589, S5811 and S5812) due to abundant filamentous algae prohibiting seining. <br> \n <br> \nApproximately 18 different fish species (14 species from back-pack electrofishing, and 17 species from seining) were captured from electrofishing and seining combined. Fish species captured included gamefish (i.e. Northern Pike and Largemouth Bass), panfish (Bluegill, Yellow Perch, Pumpkinseed, Green Sunfish, and Hybrid Sunfish), potentially large sized non-gamefish (Yellow Bullhead) and small sized non-gamefish (Iowa Darter, Johnny Darter, Banded Killifish, Blacknose Shiner, Bluntnose Minnow, Tadpole Madtom, Pugnose Shiner, Blackchin Shiner, Spottail Shiner and Golden Shiner). Intolerant habitat disturbance species included Iowa Darter, Banded Killifish, Blacknose Shiner, Blackchin Shiner and Pugnose Shiner captured in Games. High tolerant habitat disturbance species included Green Sunfish. <br> \n <br> \nData from this 2018 targeted nearshore survey was combined with data from a standard gill and trap netting survey in July of 2015 to calculate a Tool-2 FIBI score that describes the overall health of the lake. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment.  The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. The FIBI score of 40 for Games based on this survey is below the impairment threshold of 45 for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes.  Data from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Chippewa River Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency. For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A standard survey of Games Lake was conducted in July of 2019. A targeted survey is generally used for sampling a specific kind of fish or time of year (i.e. spawning season, fall season, etc.) unlike a standard survey which samples a wider range of fish species during the summer months using standard methodology (i.e. standard time of year, set sampling stations, taking water clarity readings and oxygen/temperature profiles, etc.) and gears (i.e. lake survey gillnets, trapnets and possibly spring electrofishing for Largemouth Bass). Targeted surveys conducted in 2019 included Score The Shore and Fall Electrofishing for young of year \"YOY\" Walleye. <br> \n <br> \nGames Lake is a moderately sized (521 acres), moderately deep (42 feet maximum), and low to moderately productive lake located in Kandiyohi County. Games Lake is a popular recreational lake. A high use county park/campground is located along the southeast shoreline. Residential development has occurred throughout the entire shoreline area with the exception of small portions of the south side, north side, and northwest bay. Two public access sites are present with one along the east side (DNR access) and another on the southeast side (county access). A 30 acre Aquatic Management Area \"AMA\" (acquired in 2003) is located along the north shore. A channel is present that connects Games Lake to Norway Lake and is conducive to boat navigation. Games Lake is also connected to several periodic winterkill (Swan, Henchien) and non-winterkill lakes (Andrew) via the outlet which eventually becomes Shakopee Creek. A low head dam is present at the outlet. Water levels were above normal during 2019. Water clarity (secchi=15.8 feet) was excellent during the 2019 survey. Dissolved oxygen levels were above 2.0 ppm to depths of 15 feet. Emergent vegetation densities (bulrush, cattails, burreed, and arrowhead) are low to moderate in Games Lake occurring mostly in the northwest and east shore areas. Eurasian watermilfoil \"EWM\" was found along the west side of Games during 2014. EWM has been present in upstream Norway Lake since 2001. Submergent vegetation species (bladderwort, bushy pondweed, clasping-leaf pondweed, Eurasian watermilfoil, flat-stem pondweed, muskgrass, coontail, water celery, sago pondweed, northern milfoil, etc.) are moderately abundant within the shallow areas (<15 feet deep). Shoalwater substrates consisted mostly of sand, gravel, rubble and silt. Zebra Mussels were first documented in Norway, Games and Andrew during 2018. High fishing pressure and potential over exploitation of gamefish is a concern of anglers on Games Lake due in part to the popular public campground located on the south shore. <br> \n <br> \nGames Lake lies within the larger Chippewa River Watershed District and sub watershed of Upper Shakopee Creek. The Chippewa River Watershed District was the lead agency for coordinating: nutrient reduction measures, protection from invasive species, information/education, storm water management and the Shakopee Creek Headwaters Project prior to 2019. The local Soil Water Conservation District is currently the lead agency. <br> \n <br> \nA comprehensive set of in-lake and watershed projects since the mid-1990's have been conducted/proposed as part of the Shakopee Creek Headwaters Project (e.g., lakeshore re-vegetation demonstration sites, buffer strips and grassed waterways, wetland restorations, septic system upgrades, livestock exclusion projects and other various agricultural and shoreland best management practice implementations) to reduce nutrient, bacteria and sediment inputs. The Shakopee Creek Headwaters Project was composed of individuals representing several lake associations (Florida, Norway & Games and Andrew), private landowners and various government agency personnel in order more efficiently enact beneficial watershed projects. Thus far, DNR Fisheries has provided assistance with lakeshore re-vegetation and water quality monitoring projects. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie numbers were low in 2019 (1.50 fish/trapnet and 1.33 fish/gillnet). The Black Crappie historical average catch rates were 4.80 fish/trapnet and 3.56 fish/gillnet for Games Lake. Black Crappie average size was small (0.17 pounds) from the trapnets. Winter angling for Black Crappie was popular in Games during the 1990's and early 2000's. In recent years, Black Crappie angling success has been generally poor. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike numbers were low in 2019 (2.33 fish/gillnet) compared to the historical average catch rate (5.99 fish/gillnet) for Games Lake. However, the 2019 Northern Pike average size was moderate (3.58 pounds and 25.44 inches) from gillnets. The Northern Pike historical average weight is 2.64 pounds from gillnets. Northern Pike grow rates were slow in Games. The 2012 year class comprised 56% of the 2019 Northern Pike survey catch. Northern Pike possession limit regulations for Games in the North-central Zone are as follows: anglers can keep 10 Northern Pike, but not more than two pike longer than 26 inches; and all from 22 to 26 inches must be released. Northern Pike taken by spearing follow the same rules except one pike may be between 22 and 26 inches or two larger than 26 inches. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch numbers were moderate in 2019 (15.67 fish/gillnet). The Yellow Perch historical average catch rate is 22.07 fish/gillnet for Games Lake. The 2019 Yellow Perch average size was small (0.11 pounds and 6.24 inches) from gillnets.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye numbers were abundant in 2019 (4.00 fish/gillnet) for Games Lake. The Walleye historical average catch rate is 2.29 fish/gillnet for Games Lake. The 2019 Walleye average size was moderate (1.61 pounds and 15.52 inches) from gillnets. Walleye growth rates were moderate in Games. The 2017 year class comprised 29% of the 2019 Walleye summer survey catch. YOY Walleye numbers were moderately abundant during fry stocked years of 2017 (57.00 YOY/hour, 6.05 inches) and 2019 (40.00 YOY/hour, 5.75 inches) fall electrofishing surveys. The Walleye population in Games Lake is due primarily to stocking or limited migration into Games from Norway. Games Lake was recently stocked with Walleye in 2009 (3,656 fingerlings, 488 pounds), 2011 (15,563 fingerlings, 532 pounds; 721 yearlings, 103 pounds), 2013 (14,297 fingerling, 493 pounds), 2015 (3,498 fingerlings, yearlings and adults combined, 795 pounds), 2017 (255,002 fry) and 2019 (242,957 fry).  <br> \n <br> \nBluegill numbers were moderate in 2019 (26.20 fish/trapnet). The Bluegill historical average catch rate is 36.28 fish/trapnet for Games Lake. The 2019 Bluegill average size was small (0.12 pounds and 5.10 inches) from trapnets. There was only one Bluegill over 8.00 inches captured in the 2019 survey nets. Bluegill growth rates were moderate in Games. The 2016 year class comprised 36% of the 2019 Bluegill survey catch. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass spring electrofishing was not conducted in Games during 2019. Largemouth Bass abundance was low (9.50 fish/hour) in the previous 2015 spring electrofishing survey. The 2015 Largemouth Bass average size was moderate (1.05 pounds and 12.10 inches) from spring electrofishing. Largemouth Bass growth rates were generally below the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-8.  <br> \n <br> \nFreshwater Drum numbers were abundant in 2019 (8.33 fish/gillnet). The Freshwater Drum historical average catch rate is 7.56 fish/gillnet for Games Lake. The 2019 Freshwater Drum average size was moderate (1.38 pounds and 14.67 inches) from gillnets.  <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species captured during 2019 included low numbers of Black Bullhead (0.10 fish/trapnet), Bowfin (0.40 fish/trapnet), Common Carp (0.50 fish/trapnet), Pumpkinseed Sunfish (0.40 fish/trapnet) and Yellow Bullhead (0.50 fish/trapnet). Bigmouth Buffalo and Shortnose Gar were caught in low numbers in past surveys, but were not captured in 2019. <br> \n <br> \nCurrent fish management activities on Games Lake include monitoring the fish population on a periodic basis, protecting aquatic vegetation through the permit process, assisting aquatic plant management and enforcement personnel in educating boaters and monitoring access sites for potential invasive species introductions, participating in local watershed initiatives, and stocking various fish species as warranted. The Games Lake fishery will be surveyed in the 2024 spring for Largemouth Bass and 2022 summer for all fish species. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Games is a moderate size lake (515 acres) located 6 miles east of Sunburg, MN in Kandiyohi County. It has a maximum depth of 42 feet with good water clarity (7.8 feet secchi reading). Kandiyohi County Park #7 is located on the southeast shore with 74 camping units available. Games has been managed primarily for largemouth bass and bluegill with secondary management toward black crappie, northern pike, and walleye. There is abundant submergent vegetation (muskgrass, sago pondweed, coontail, flatstem pondweed) throughout the west and northeast shorelines and also in the northwest bay. The most common emergent vegetation species was hardstem bulrush. Stands of bulrush are located in and near the northwest bay, southeast shore, and east shore near the outlet. Hardstem bulrush is important spawning cover and habitat for largemouth bass, black crappie, and bluegill. Also, bulrush aides in the uptake of excess nutrients from the lake and improves water clarity. The size of several bulrush stands have decreased in the past several years. Historically, Games has been noted for good largemouth bass, northern pike, and black crappie fishing. In recent years, fishing has been good for largemouth bass, but fair to poor for northern pike and black crappie. Bluegill have also been caught in large numbers in the past, but the size has been small (less than 7 inches).     Presently, Largemouth bass appear to be moderately abundant in Games with a population estimate of 1,736 bass greater than 8 inches in total length. Overall, the 1993 largemouth bass electrofishing catch rate was similar (27.1 fish/hour) to 1991 survey (29.6 fish/hour). There appears to be adequate numbers of medium to large size bass of which 23% were greater than 1.0 lb in size.  However, abundance of largemouth bass 15 to 20 inches long (2 - 5 lbs) was slightly lower in 1993 (2.8 fish/hour) compared to 1991 (4.0 fish/hour). The average size of largemouth bass caught in the 1993 survey was 10.2 inches long with the largest bass at 18.7 inches long. The black crappie catch rate in 1993 (1.0 fish/trapnet) was below the historical average (7.7 fish/trapnet) and below the normal range (1.5 - 13.3 fish/trapnet) for similar lakes. The common occurrence of low black crappie numbers in most of the area lakes may be due in part to unfavorable environmental conditions (i.e. water levels and temperatures) and the cyclic nature of the fish. Northern pike abundance in 1993 (3.2 fish/gillnet) was also below the historical average (6.5 fish/gillnet). The average size of 2.4 lbs in 1993 was similar to the historical average (2.5 lbs). Poor natural reproduction of northern pike has occurred in Games and other area lakes due to drought conditions in the late 1980's and erratic spring water levels and temperatures in the early 1990's. In addition, stocking of winter rescue northern pike has been minimal the last several years because of the poor availability. Bluegill abundance (22.3 fish/trapnet) was within the normal range for similar lakes. The 1993 average size (5.0 inches) was below the historical average (5.6 inches). Only 12% of the total bluegill caught in trapnets were greater than 6 inches long. Historically, bluegill sizes were stunted compared to other area lakes. Walleye numbers were below average (0.8 fish/gillnet) in 1993 compared to the historical average (1.6 fish/gillnet) and the normal range for similar lakes (1.0 - 6.0 fish/gillnet). Future walleye stocking have been suspended indefinitely because of the historically low densities and poor return to anglers. Freshwater drum (\"sheephead\") numbers were above average in 1993 (9.2 fish/gillnet) compared to the historical average (5.1 fish/gillnet). Presently, there is no stable freshwater drum commercial market in the area for human consumption or other uses (mink food, fertilizer, etc.).     Priority management activities should include the following: protection and expansion of hardstem bulrush stands which are important habitat, reduction of nutrient inputs into the lake from runoff, population manipulation through stocking (winter rescue northern pike) and removal (freshwater drum, stunted bluegill), and monitoring the largemouth bass populations with electrofishing surveys. Harvest restrictions (size limits, bag limits, etc.) may be necessary if over exploitation of largemouth bass begins to occur. Increasing the average size of bluegill in Games will be difficult due to the limited effectiveness of management techniques (removal) on a lake of this size, connections to other bodies of water, history of slow growth rates, and history of high densities of small fish (< 7 inches) present. If adequate spring water levels and temperatures occur then good natural reproduction of northern pike is possible, thus negating the need for winter rescue fish every year.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Games Lake is located 6 miles east of Sunburg, MN in Kandiyohi County. It has a surfacearea of 515 acres of which 47% is littoral. The maximum depth is 42 feet. Games is ahardwater lake of moderate to low fertility (total phosphorus=0.026 on 6-18-91). The secchidisk reading was 10.0 feet on 7-17-96. The majority of the lakeshore is residential homes (86cabins/homes, 1991 survey) intermingled with mixed hardwoods with the exception of a shallowbay in the northwest corner which is adjacent to agricultural row crops and pasture. Othershoreline development includes Kandiyohi County Park #7 which has a campground of 74 unitsthat is located on the southeast shore. Games is connected to two other lakes (Norway andAndrew) via inlet and outlet areas. The Little Norway Lake basin inlet enters into the southshore of Games and is passable by boat during most years. The majority of water enters GamesLake from the Little Norway Lake basin. Inlets along the northwest and north shore havesignificantly smaller flows, but have generally higher concentrations of nutrients than theNorway inlet. The outlet of Games (east shore) flows over a concrete dam and into Swan Lake,then it flows over another dam into Henchien Lake, and eventually into Lake Andrew.Submergent vegetation is most abundant in the northwest bay, along the west and northeastshorelines. The most frequently occurring submergent vegetation species include muskgrass,sago pondweed, water moss, coontail, flatstem pondweed, bladderwort, and bushy pondweed.Submergent vegetation was found in 16 feet of water during 1993. The greatest varieties anddensities of emergent vegetation are found within the northwest bay. These species includehardstem bulrush, common cattail, river bulrush, narrowleaf cattail, arrowhead, reed canarygrass, and greenfruited burreed. The largest stand of hardstem bulrush is found on the westshore adjacent to the northwest bay opening. Smaller stands of bulrush are located along thesoutheast and east shores adjacent to the outlet. According to the 1993 and 1991 surveys,bulrush stands were less dense near the outlet and northwest bay opening areas than in the1987 survey. The most frequently occurring shoalwater substrates are sand and gravel withsome rubble and boulder along the south shore. The most frequently occurring substrateswithin the northwest bay area are muck, detritus, silt, and marl. Games Lake is managed fornorthern pike and largemouth bass as the primary species with black crappie and bluegill assecondary species. In previous years, Games was noted for good largemouth bass, northernpike, and black crappie fishing. However, fishing success has been only fair in recent yearsfor most gamefish as confirmed by a creel survey during the 1991-92 winter and 1992 summer(Winter and Openwater Creel Survey for Andrew, Games, and Norway Lakes, Kandiyohi County,Minnesota 1991-1992 Completion Report, F-29-R(P)-12, Area 430, Study 4, Job 273, March 28,1994). Presently, a watershed study is being conducted on Norway, Games, and Andrew Lakes todetermine the quality and quantity of water inflow within the lakes. This study will providevaluable information that will enable both public and private parties to more effectivelytarget land management projects that will improve water quality within the watershed.      Black crappie catch rates in 1996 (0.8 fish/gillnet, 0.4 fish/trapnet) were within the1st and 3rd median interquartile ranges for Lake Class 27 (0.4 - 2.7 fish/gillnet, 0.4 - 2.3fish/trapnet) and below the historical averages (4.7 fish/gillnet, 6.7 fish/trapnet). Theblack crappie PSD and RSD-P in 1996 was 60.0 and 40.0 respectively. Recruitment to catchablesize appears sporadic since the early 1980's. Lack of strong black crappie year classes inrecent years have been apparent on Games and other area lakes. It has been inferred thatthere may be potential competition with walleye, however, this is probably not a factor inthe decline of black crappie in Games due to low densities of walleye present. The 1996average size (7.2 inches from gillnets and trapnets) was the same as the historical average.Growth rates appear average compared to local lakes. There were no dominant year classespresent in the 1996 survey.     Bluegill abundance in 1996 (15.0 fish/trapnet) was within the 1st and 3rd medianinterquartile range (4.4 - 49.0 fish/trapnet) for Lake Class 27, but below the historicalaverage (49.25/trapnet). The 1996 bluegill PSD and RSD-P was 2.8 and 0 respectively. Thehistorical average PSD is 29.6 for Games. Historically, bluegill have been abundant, butstunted in size. Growth rates appear average for ages I-V compared to other local lakes.About 68% of the bluegill captured in the 1996 survey belonged to the 1994 year class. Therehave been no bluegill caught above the preferred size (> 8.0 inches) since the 1950 survey.The CPUE of quality size bluegill (just acceptable to local anglers) has declinedsubstantially since the late 1970's from 67.2 fish/trapnet (83% of the fish were between 6.0-6.9 inches) to 0.4 fish/trapnet in 1996. The average size of bluegill captured in 1996 (4.4inches) was below the historical average (5.4 inches).     There was no spring electrofishing survey conducted in 1996 due to time and work loadconstraints. The last spring electrofishing survey for largemouth bass was conducted in 1993.The largemouth bass abundance in 1993 (27.1 fish/hour, 8.78 hours of effort) was similar tothe only other electrofishing survey done in 1991 (29.6 fish/hour, 1.25 hours of effort). The1993 average size (10.2 inches) was also similar to the 1991 survey (10.4 inches). Thelargest largemouth bass captured was 18.7 inches in the 1993 survey. Growth rates oflargemouth bass appeared average in 1993 compared to other local lakes. The 1993 PSD and RSD-P was 31.0 and 14.4 respectively. The 1991 PSD and RSD-P was 52.0 and 20.0. The catch rateof quality size (12-15 inches) largemouth bass in 1993 (3.6 fish/hour) was slightly lowerthan 1991 catch rate (6.4 fish/hour). Likewise, the catch rate for preferred largemouth bass(15-20 inches) in 1993 (2.8 fish/hour) was lower than 1991 catch rate (4.0 fish/hour).Population estimates of 2,554 (95% C.I. 1,207 - 5,895) largemouth bass of all sizes, and1,736 (95% C.I. 775 - 4,340) greater than 8 inches (19.9 fish/hour) were computed by thePeterson method with two marking runs and one recapture run by DNR Fisheries Research-Hutchinson during the spring of 1993. The population estimates are slightly lower thanexpected for the reputation of the lake for good largemouth bass fishing.        The 1996 northern pike abundance of 5.6 fish/gillnet was within the 1st and 3rd medianinterquartile range (2.8 - 9.0 fish/gillnet) for Lake Class 27, and similar to the historicalaverage (6.3 fish/gillnet). The 1996 average size (23.0 inches) was above the historicalaverage (21.7 inches). The largest northern pike captured was 30.9 inches in length. The 1996PSD and RSD-P was 72.4 and 3.4 respectively. Growth rates appear average for age I-IIIcompared to other local lakes. About 52% of the fish captured belonged to the 1994 yearclass. Games had been stocked with winter rescue northern pike from 1971 to 1986 with averageof 1800 yearlings per year. In February of 1993, 224 winter rescue yearlings were stockedinto Games. There were 260 adults (1.1 lbs average size) stocked in December of 1995. Poorspawning conditions due to the drought in the late 1980's and erratic water levels during thespawning runs in the early 1990's had resulted in poor year classes of northern pike in manylocal lakes including Games.     Yellow perch abundance in 1996 (22.4 fish/gillnet) was within the 1st and 3rd medianinterquartile range (7.0 - 46.3 fish/gillnet) for Lake Class 27 and similar to the historicalaverage (27.6 fish/gillnet). The 1996 average size (5.8 inches) was similar to the historicalaverage (6.1 inches). The largest yellow perch captured was 9.1 inches. The PSD and RSD-P was2.4 and 0 respectively in 1996. Growth rates appear average compared to local lakes. About48% of the fish captured belonged to the 1994 year class.      The walleye abundance in 1996 (3.0 fish/gillnet) was slightly below the 1st and 3rdinterquartile range (3.3 - 8.8 fish/gillnet) for Lake Class 27, but above the historicalaverage (1.8 fish/gillnet). The 1996 average size (14.8 inches from gillnets and trapnets)was below the historical average (16.7 inches). Growth rates appear average compared to otherlocal lakes. About 200-300 lbs of walleye fingerlings had been stocked every odd year from1985-1993. Walleye fry or fingerlings were stocked at various rates from 1971 through 1982during most years. Future walleye stocking has been suspended indefinitely because of poorhistorical densities, low return to anglers, and potential adverse affects on other fishspecies (competition with black crappie). There was limited walleye natural reproduction in1995 (20.0 young of year \"YOY\"/hour, average size=7.5 inches). Scale aging of walleyeconfirms that 71% of the fish captured in the 1996 survey were from nonstocked year classes(1994 and 1995).     Black bullhead abundance in 1996 (0.2 fish/gillnet) was below the 1st and 3rd medianinterquartile range (0.6 - 6.8 fish/gillnet) for Lake Class 27, and below the historicalaverage (1.3 fish/gillnet). The 1996 black bullhead average size (7.3 inches) was below thehistorical average (10.7 inches). The 1996 yellow bullhead abundance (0.4 fish/gillnet) wasbelow the 1st and 3rd median interquartile range (1.2 - 10.9 fish/gillnet) for Lake Class 27and below the historical averages (4.1 fish/gillnet). The 1996 yellow bullhead average size(10.8 inches) was slightly below the historical average (11.5 inches).      Freshwater drum abundance in 1996 (6.0 fish/gillnet) was within the 1st and 3rd medianinterquartile range (2.0 - 9.4 fish/gillnet) for Lake Class 27 and similar to the historicalaverage (5.2 fish/gillnet). The 1996 average size (16.8 inches) was above the historicalaverage (14.4 inches). Freshwater drum are under utilized as a sportfish. Commercial valueof this fish has been secondary to buffalo fish and carp. Local anglers regard freshwaterdrum as an inferior eating fish. There is no stable market for commercial uses (food forhuman consumption, mink food, etc.) of freshwater drum in this part of the United States.Commercial fishermen removed about 1,200 lbs of freshwater drum coinciding with removal ofbuffalo fish and carp during the March of 1996.     Bigmouth buffalo fish abundance in 1996 (0.1 fish/trapnet) was within the 1st and 3rdmedian interquartile range (0.1 - 0.8 fish/trapnet) for Lake Class 27, but below thehistorical average (1.0 fish/trapnet). The highest recorded value occurred in 1993 (4.4fish/trapnet). The 1996 average size (24.5 inches) was above the historical average (21.0inches). Commercial fishermen removed significant amounts of buffalo fish during under theice seining operations in 1995 (90,000 lbs, sizes > 3 lbs each) and 1996 (90,700 lbs, size> 3 lbs each). Only 4,500 lbs (sizes > 4 lbs) were removed in 1997.     Carp abundance within the survey nets has been historically low. The 1996 carp abundance(0.1 fish/trapnet) was below the 1st and 3rd median interquartile range (0.2 - 1.0fish/trapnet) for Lake Class 27, and below the historical average (0.5 fish/trapnet). The1996 average size (27.5 inches) was above the historical average (23.4 inches). Commercialfishermen removed 48,000 lbs (sizes > 4 lbs) in 1995, 7,300 lbs (sizes > 4 lbs) in 1996, and2,800 lbs (sizes > 4 lbs) in 1997. Emigration of both carp and buffalo is possible out ofNorway and into Games through the Little Norway inlet.     It appears that northern pike numbers have improved within Games Lake. Stocking winterrescue northern pike periodically (when abundance is below the 1st interquartile) is anoption to maintain adequate numbers. Games Lake can receive substantial fishing pressure fromguests that camp at the popular Kandiyohi County Park #7. Historically, bluegill sizestructure has been marginal. Management activities that may sometimes work for improvingbluegill size structure on small lakes (<100 acres) include maintaining high predatorpopulations (largemouth bass, northern pike, yellow bullhead, etc.), selective bluegillremoval to promote growth and reduce potential inferior genetic stock \"cuckholders\",increasing numbers of superior genetic strains through protection (limiting harvest bluegillgreater than 7 inches), habitat manipulation to reduce the effects of potential limitingfactors in the population, or lake rehabilitation. However, improving the bluegill sizestructure in Games will be difficult because of limited available management techniques thatwill work on interconnected waters of this size. Other important management activitiesinclude protecting the remaining hardstem bulrush stands and expanding stands to new sitesthrough planting; monitoring the largemouth bass population through electrofishing every twoto three years and assessing whether special regulations may be needed in the future;assessing whether special regulations are needed for black crappie in Norway and Games;issuance of B-permits for carp, buffalo fish, and freshwater drum removal; encouraging arealandowners to implement best management practices (conservation tillage, planting bufferstrips, proper feedlot and manure management, using low/no phosphorus fertilizers onresidential lawns, replacing dysfunctional septic systems, restoring wetlands) within thewatershed.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A standard survey of Games Lake was conducted in July of 2015. Games Lake is a moderately sized (521 acres), moderately deep (42 feet maximum), and low to moderately productive lake located in Kandiyohi County. Games Lake is a popular recreational and fishing lake. A county park is located along the southeast shoreline. Residential development has occurred throughout the entire shoreline area with the exception of small portions of the south side, north side, and northwest bay. Two public access sites are present with one along the east side (DNR access) and another on the southeast side (county access). An aquatic management area is located along the north shore. A channel is present that connects Games Lake to Norway Lake and is conducive to boat navigation. Games Lake is also connected to several periodic winterkill (Swan, Henchien) and non-winterkill lakes (Andrew) via the outlet which eventually becomes Shakopee Creek. Water levels were below normal during the spring and fall, but normal in the summer of 2015. Water clarity (secchi reading=7.6 feet) was good during the 2015 survey. Emergent vegetation densities (bulrush, cattails, burreed, and arrowhead) are low to moderate in Games Lake occurring mostly in the northwest shore and bay, and east shore areas. Eurasian watermilfoil \"EWM\" was found along the west side of Games during 2014. EWM has been present in upstream Norway Lake since 2001. Other submergent vegetation species (bladderwort, clasping-leaf pondweed, flat-stem pondweed, chara, coontail, wild celery, sago pondweed, northern milfoil, etc.) are moderately abundant within the shallow areas (<15 feet deep). Shoalwater substrates consist mostly of sand, gravel, rubble and silt.  <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie numbers were low (1.10 fish/trapnet) in 2015 as compared to the Games historical average (5.07 fish/trapnet). Black Crappie populations often cycle resulting in periods of boom or bust years. Black Crappie year classes have been weak in Games and other connected lakes during recent years. Yellow Perch numbers were also low in 2015 (2.67 fish/gillnet) compared to the historical average (22.60 fish/gillnet) and the normal range. Historically, Bluegill catch rates have been high but average sizes are generally small in Games. However, Bluegill abundance was low in 2015 (17.40 fish/trapnet) compared to the historical average (37.13 fish/trapnet). The 2015 Bluegill average size was small (0.11 pounds and 5.2 inches) from trapnets. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike numbers were low in 2015 (2.33 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range and the Games historical average (6.30 fish/gillnet). However, the 2015 Northern Pike average size was moderate (3.54 pounds and 25.4 inches) from gillnets and above the historical average.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye numbers were also low in 2015 (1.67 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range. The Walleye historical average catch rate is 2.14 fish/gillnet for Games Lake. The 2015 Walleye average size was moderate (1.11 pounds and 14.6 inches) from gillnets. The Walleye historical average weight is 1.62 pounds from gillnets. Walleye natural reproduction is generally insignificant in Games, however fish movement in or out via Norway is possible. Games Lake was recently stocked with Walleye in 2009 (3,656 fingerlings, 488 pounds), 2011 (15,563 fingerlings, 532 pounds; 721 yearlings, 103 pounds), 2013 (14,297 fingerling, 493 pounds) and 2015 (3,498 fingerlings, yearlings and adults combined, 795 pounds). <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass numbers were low (9.50 fish/hour) in the 2015 spring electrofishing survey. The 2015 Largemouth Bass average size was moderate (1.05 pounds and 12.10 inches) from spring electrofishing. Largemouth Bass growth rates were slow.  <br> \n <br> \nFreshwater Drum \"Sheepshead\" numbers were high in 2015 (10.00 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range and the Games historical average (7.49 fish/gillnet). The 2015 Freshwater Drum average size was small (1.51 pounds and 14.68 inches) but similar to the historical average from gillnets. Other fish species of interest captured in low numbers included Yellow Bullhead, Brown Bullhead, Bigmouth Buffalo, Bowfin, Common Carp, Shortnose Gar, Hybrid Sunfish, and Green Sunfish. <br> \n <br> \nCurrent fish management activities on Games Lake include monitoring the fish population on a periodic basis, protecting aquatic vegetation through the permit process, assisting aquatic plant management and enforcement personnel in educating boaters and monitoring access sites for potential invasive species introductions, participating in local watershed initiatives, and stocking various fish species as warranted. The Games Lake fishery will be surveyed in the 2019 spring for Largemouth Bass and 2019 summer for all fish species. <br> \n</p>",
