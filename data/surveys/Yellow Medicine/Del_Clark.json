                "narrative": "<p>Del Clark Lake is an impoundment of Canby Creek and is located one mile southwest of the City of Canby.  It measures 154 acres and has a maximum depth of 30 feet.  The Lac qui Parle - Yellow Bank watershed District owns the property around the lake, including Stonehill Regional Park.  Stonehill Park offers convenient shore angling locations, a swimming beach, camping, and hiking. <br> \n <br> \nDel Clark Lake offers fishing opportunities for many species including bluegill, black crappie, largemouth bass, northern pike, walleye, and yellow perch.  Walleye were moderately abundant in 2013 with fish ranging from 9 - 25 inches.  The walleye population in Del Clark has resulted mostly from natural reproduction.  Management plans call for fingerling or yearling walleye to be stocked following consecutive years of poor reproduction. <br> \n <br> \nNet catches of black crappie and bluegill were lower than what's considered average for Del Clark Lake.  However, bluegill over 9 inches and crappie over 11 inches were sampled, and anglers should have some success for panfish on the outer edges of weedlines. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike net abundance had declined since 2010.  However, most northern caught were quality sized, including one individual measuring over 40 inches and 20 pounds.  Anglers have reported catching several large northern pike during recent years. <br> \nYellow perch were moderately abundant in 2013, but most were smaller than what anglers would typically want to keep.  Yellow perch are a good forage fish for walleye and northern pike. <br> \n <br> \nManagement activities scheduled for Del Clark Lake include stocking walleye as needed, winter ice-house counts, fall night electrofishing to assess small walleye abundance, and a 2016 population assessment.   <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Del Clark Lake is located one mile southwest of Canby.  It is an impoundment on Canby Creek that has a surface area of 154 acres and maximum depth of 30 feet.  The Lac qui Parle-Yellow Bank Watershed District owns the property around the lake, including Stonehill Regional Park.  The park provides shore angling locations, two boat launches, a swimming beach, camping and hiking.  This 2022 standard survey was conducted to collect routine fish population data.  These data can be compared to historical standard and targeted survey data from Del Clark Lake. <br> \n <br> \nDel Clark Lake offers fishing opportunities for Bluegills, Black Crappies, Largemouth Bass, Northern Pike, Walleyes and Yellow Perch.  Walleyes were moderately abundant in 2022 with fish averaging 18 inches and ranging from 11-25 inches.  Walleyes have reproduced well, and the population has primarily been maintained by natural reproduction.  Additional Walleye fingerlings or yearlings have been stocked when needed. <br> \n <br> \nModerate numbers of Bluegills were caught.  Most of them were small with an average size of five inches and the largest measured less than eight inches.  Low numbers of Black Crappies were caught, but some were larger than 11 inches.  Yellow Perch were abundant, but they were small with most less than eight inches.  Anglers can expect to catch panfish on the edges of weed lines. <br> \n <br> \nDel Clark is known for producing large pike and fish over 20 pounds have been caught.  Relatively high numbers of pike were present in 2022.  Del Clark is in the Southern Northern Pike Management Zone where the possession limit for Northern Pike is 2 with a minumum size limit of 24 inches.  They averaged 23 inches with the largest measuring 34 inches.  Good numbers of Largemouth Bass were present with some over 18 inches.  Casting shorelines and weed lines can produce bass.       <br> \n <br> \nPlanned DNR Fisheries management activities include fish surveys, winter fishing pressure counts, fall night electrofishing to assess young Walleye abundance, and stocking Walleyes if necessary.   <br> \n</p>",

The Lac qui Parle - Yellow Bank Watershed District owns the property around the lake, including Stonehill Regional Park.  Stonehill Park offers convenient shore angling locations, a swimming beach, camping and hiking. <br> \n <br> \nDel Clark Lake offers fishing opportunities for many species including Bluegill, Black Crappie, Largemouth Bass, Northern Pike, Walleye, and Yellow Perch.  A netting survey was completed in 2016 to assess the fish population.  Walleyes were abundant in 2016 with fish ranging from 8-27 inches.  Walleyes have reproduced well and the population is primarily from natural reproduction.  Additional Walleye fingerlings or yearlings have been stocked when needed. <br> \n <br> \nNet catches of Bluegills and Black Crappies were low to moderate but typical for Del Clark Lake.  Some Bluegills over 8.5 inches and crappies over 12 inches were sampled.  Yellow Perch were abundant, though few were longer than 8 inches.  Anglers can expect to locate panfish on the edges of weed lines. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike abundance increased since the last survey in 2013.  Most were quality-sized, including one individual measuring over 40 inches and 20 pounds.  Anglers have reported catching several large Northern Pike during recent years. <br> \n <br> \nPlanned management activities include fish surveys, winter fishing pressure counts, fall night electrofishing to assess young Walleye abundance, and stocking Walleyes if necessary.   <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Del Clark Lake was created in 1984-85 when Canby Creek was dammed to provide flood protection to downstream areas.  It is a 150 acre reservoir with a maximum depth of 30 feet.  Stonehill Regional Park, a Lac qui Parle - Yellow Bank Watershed District park, completely surrounds Del Clark Lake.     Numerous game fish species reside in Del Clark Lake including walleye, black crappie, largemouth bass, northern pike and yellow perch.  It is stocked during odd numbered years with walleye fry.  In 1998 walleye were abundant.  These fish were primarily 10 or 15 inches long, representing the 1997 and 1995 year classes.  Young-of-year walleye from the 1998 year class were also present in low to moderate numbers, as revealed by fall night electrofishing.  No older walleye were present because a 1994 lake draw-down had eliminated the previous walleye population.     Yellow perch were also abundant and most of them measured from 6-10 inches.  Low numbers of adult black crappie, largemouth bass, and northern pike were sampled.  However, high numbers of young black crappie and largemouth bass have been sampled the past several years.  It appears that many of the young crappie and bass are not surviving to adulthood.  This has probably been, at least in part, due to predation upon them by the abundant walleye.  Low numbers of young bluegill were present, however no adult fish were sampled.     The habitat quality of Del Clark Lake continues to be degraded due to silt and nutrient runoff from the watershed.  These habitat changes will favor black bullhead and this species will likely become more abundant over time.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>     Del Clark Lake is an impoundment of Canby Creek located one mile southwest of Canby.  The impoundment was constructed in 1984 to prevent flooding of Canby.  It measures 154 acres and has a maximum depth of 30 feet.  The Lac qui Parle-Yellow Bank Watershed District owns the property around the lake including Stonehill Regional Park which is along the west shoreline.  The park offers convenient shore angling locations, a swimming beach, camping and hiking. <br> \n     Del Clark Lake offers fishing opportunities for many species including walleye, yellow perch, largemouth bass, northern pike and pan fish.  Walleye were abundant in 2010 with many sizes well represented, including fish near 30 inches.  The walleye population has resulted from natural reproduction, and occasional stocking when needed.  Recently, strong natural walleye year classes occurred in 2005, 2008, and 2010. <br> \n     Yellow perch were abundant in 2010 with fish measuring 5-9 inches.  Perch usually grow slow in Del Clark Lake and anglers are encouraged to harvest smaller fish as they rarely reach 10 inches. <br> \n     Largemouth bass were moderately abundant with fish measuring up to 20 inches.  Northern pike were also moderately abundant, and fiish in excess of 30 inches have been known to occur.  Bluegill and black crappie were also present in adequate numbers to provide good fishing.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Del Clark is a small, 150 acre impoundment of Canby Creek located in Yellow Medicine County, near the city of Canby.  Stonehill Regional Park surrounds the entire lake.      Walleye were abundant in 2001.  They measured from 9-25 inches with the majority 15-19 inches.  Approximately 137,000 walleye fry were stocked in 2001.  Prior to stocking, the fry were marked using oxytetracycline (OTC).  During fall electrofishing, 217 young-of-year walleye were caught per electrofishing hour, indicating a very abundant year class.  Examination of the young walleye for OTC marks revealed that fry stocking accounted for 44% of the 2001 year class.  Fry stocking and natural reproduction have both contributed substantially to the Del Clark Lake walleye fishery.     Yellow perch were also abundant.  Although most perch measured 5-6 inches, a good number of 8-9 inch fish was also sampled.  Perch reproduction was excellent in 2001, however predation by walleye will likely limit the survival of this year class.     Black crappie were sampled in moderate abundance.  Crappie measured 8-9 inches and were growing fast.  Crappie of similar age average around 7 inches in southern Minnesota lakes.  Limited crappie reproduction occurred in 2001.       Bluegill were sampled in low abundance in trap nets, but an abundant population was indicated while electrofishing.  All bluegill caught were small, measuring 5-6 inches.  Bluegill were growing fast and should be of quality size in 1-2 years.     Other fish species sampled in 2001 include black bullhead, largemouth bass, northern pike and white sucker.  The majority of black bullhead measured over 10 inches and would offer a good angling opportunity.     Fisheries activies planned for Del Clark Lake include annual monitoring of winter dissolved oxygen concentration and fishing pressure, stocking as needed, annual fall electrofishing assessment of young-of-year walleye abundance and population assessment for 2004.     </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Del Clark is a 154 acre impoundment of Canby Creek located near Canby in Yellow Medicine County.  The lake is primarily managed for walleye, black crappie, and northern pike.  Del Clark was last surveyed in 2004. <br> \n <br> \nThe number of walleye per gill net during this survey (34 per net) was similar to catch rates observed in 2004 (38 per net).  Average size was a little larger during this survey, with walleye averaging 16.5 inches and almost 2 lbs.  Walleye average size in 2004 was 14.6 inches and one pound.  Walleye were primarily two years old and six years old, but walleye up to 12 years old were sampled.  Historically, Del Clark was stocked in odd-numbered years with walleye fry.  However, after 2004, fry stocking was discontinued due to fairly consistent natural reproduction and poor growth of smaller walleye.  During the fall of 2005, 1,159 fingerlings and 438 yearlings were stocked in an effort to utilize the abundant population of small yellow perch.  Almost 3,500 yearling walleye were stocked in the spring of 2007.  Fall electrofishing in 2007 did not find any young-of-year (YOY) walleye, but yearling and adult walleye were abundant. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch continue to be abundant in Del Clark.  The 2004 survey sampled 84 yellow perch per gill net and this survey captured 119 yellow perch per gill net.  This catch rate is a record high for Del Clark and is slightly higher than the previous record-high catch of 98 perch per gill net in 1988.  Fish from all year classes were sampled in trap nets or gill nets, with the oldest yellow perch being six years old.  The perch were small, with most measuring less than 6.5 inches and only weighing 0.1 lb.   <br> \n <br> \nUnlike the yellow perch, bluegill abundance is low in Del Clark.  Trap nets surveyed 7.7 bluegill per net, which is slightly within the normal range for Del Clark.  A majority of the bluegill were 6-7 inches long, but fish over 9 inches were also sampled.  Average weight for bluegill in trap nets was 0.3 lb.  Bluegill three years old were the majority of fish aged, but fish from the 2000, 2003, and 2005 year-classes were also abundant.  Quarter-inch trap nets sampled 94.8 YOY bluegill per net, indicating successful reproduction occurred in 2007. <br> \n <br> \nThe number of black crappie per trap net (9.8 per net) was the highest ever recorded for Del Clark.  Three crappie greater than 11 inches were sampled, but most averaged 7 inches or less.  Mean weight was 0.2 lb.  Crappie were primarily two years old and growth was slightly below average. <br> \n <br> \nHistorically, northern pike abundance has been low in Del Clark.  The highest number sampled per gill net set was in 2004, when 1.5 pike were caught per net.  During this survey, gill nets caught four pike per net.  This catch rate is close to average for Del Clark.  All of the pike were over 25 inches long, and had an average weight of 5.4 lbs.  Four year classes were present (2002-2005), with the oldest pike being five years old.  <br> \n <br> \nSpring electrofishing for largemouth bass was not conducted, but bass were observed during other sampling events.  Several adults were seen during fall electrofishing, yielding a catch rate of 72 per hour.  A strong year class is expected, as quarter-inch trap nets sampled 9.8 YOY largemouth bass per net, and fall electrofishing estimates reached 600 YOY largemouth bass per hour.  Anglers can expect some excellent fishing for bass in the coming years. <br> \n <br> \nBlack bullhead continue to be low in abundance.  Only one bullhead per gill net and 3.7 bullhead per trap net were sampled.  All bullhead were 12-14 inches long with an average weight of 1.5 lbs.  Quarter-inch trap nets did not sample any YOY bullheads, indicating poor reproduction and continued low abundance in 2008. <br> \n <br> \nWhite sucker abundance in gill nets increased from 2004.  Only two white sucker per net were caught in 2004 and 15.5 per net were captured during this survey.  The suckers were 11-19 inches long and had an average weight of 1.7 lbs. <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species sampled were hybrid sunfish, bluntnose minnow, and common shiner.  Future activities planned for Del Clark include monitoring of winter dissolved oxygen and fishing pressure, fall electrofishing for YOY walleye, stocking as needed, and a resurvey in 2010. <br> \n</p>",

Historically, Del Clark was stocked in odd-numbered years with fry.  However, after 2004, fry stocking was discontinued due to fairly consistent natural reproduction and poor growth of smaller walleye.  Del Clark was not stocked with walleye fry in the spring of 2008, but 144 young-of-year (YOY) walleye per hour electrofishing were captured indicating that natural reproduction did occur in 2008.  Average length was 5.1 inches and YOY were in fair physical condition (Wr=91).  Del Clark is scheduled to be resurveyed in 2010. </p>",

The Lac qui Parle-Yellow Bank Watershed District owns the property around the lake, including Stonehill Regional Park.  The park provides shore angling locations, two boat launches, a swimming beach, camping and hiking.  This 2023 electrofishing survey was conducted to determine the extent of walleye natural reproduction.   <br> \n <br> \nWalleye reproduce well in Del Clark Reservoir and natural reproduction has maintained the walleye population for many years.  Young-of-the year walleyes were abundant in 2023 and they averaged 5.6 inches.  With decent growth these fish can be expected to make a substantial contribution to the fishery within two years.   <br> \n <br> \nYoung-of-year sunfish, yellow perch, largemouth bass, white bass, and crappie were abundant as well.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Del Clark is a small, 150 acre impoundment of Canby Creek located in Yellow Medicine County, near the City of Canby.  Although small, Del Clark is one of the deepest and clearest lakes located in southwest Minnesota.  Stonehill Regional Park surrounds the entire lake.  Stonehill maintains the two access sites on the lake and provides 41 campsites, a beach/swimming area, and bathroom facilities.  The park is known to fill up regularily, so interested campers should call ahead for arrangements.     According to test nets, the 2004 walleye population was abundant.  Walleye ranged in size from 8-25 inches, with most measuring 12-18 inches.  Walleye growth rates were not particularily fast and anglers should expect the majority of walleye to range in the 15 inch range for the next couple of years.  Del Clark has historically been stocked with approximately 150,000 walleye fry every other year.  However, because recent assessments have shown natural reproduction occurring with increased frequecy, fry stocking will be discontinued.  If assessments show two consecutive weak or missing years classes, walleye fingerlings will be stocked.     Bluegill and black crappie trap net catches were below what is considered normal for similar lake types.  However, dense beds of submergent vegetation likely caused their numbers to be underestimated.  Numerous bluegill and crappie were observed during spring and fall electrofishing.  Many of the observed bluegill measured over seven inches and many crappie over nine inches.  Good fishing for both these species was reported in 2004.       Yellow perch were abundant in test nets, but were generally too small to peek the interest of anglers.  Growth of yellow perch was slow.  Slow growth is attributed to heavy competition for limited forage.  Growth rates of yellow perch should improve as their numbers are reduced by walleye predation.  If growth improves, a fair number of 8-9 inch perch should be present by the winter of 2005.     Northern pike have historically been sampled in low numbers in Del Clark Lake.  Although not numerous, the availability of large forage fish and cool water refuges creates the potential for trophy pike and reports of fish caught over 10 pounds are not uncommon.     Spring electrofishing sampled a good number of largemouth bass in 2004.  Sampled bass all measured 14-18 inches.     Although no special regulations currently exist, anglers fishing Del Clark are encouraged to keep only enough fish for a meal and release the rest.  The practice of catch and release will help maintain the quality of the Del Clark Lake fishery.         Other fish species sampled in 2004 included low numbers of black bullhead, hybrid sunfish, and white sucker.  Most bullhead were quality sized, measuring over 11 inches.     Fisheries activities planned for Del Clark Lake include annual monitoring of winter dissolved oxygen and fishing pressure, annual fall electrofishing assessment of young-of-year walleye abundance, stocking as needed, and fisheries population assessment in 2007.</p>",

The Lac qui Parle-Yellow Bank Watershed District owns the property around the lake, including Stonehill Regional Park.  The park provides shore angling locations, a boat launch, a swimming beach, camping and hiking.  This standard survey was conducted to collect routine fish population data.  These data can be compared to historical standard and targeted survey data from Del Clark Lake. <br> \n <br> \nDel Clark Lake offers fishing opportunities for Bluegills, Black Crappies, Largemouth Bass, Northern Pike, Walleyes and Yellow Perch.  Walleyes were abundant in 2019 with fish averaging 16 inches and ranging from 9-26 inches.  Walleyes have reproduced well and the population has primarily been maintained by natural reproduction.  Additional Walleye fingerlings or yearlings have been stocked when needed. <br> \n <br> \nLow to moderate numbers of Bluegills and Black Crappies were present, which has been typical for Del Clark Lake.  Many of the crappies were larger than ten inches.  Bluegills were relatively small, averaging five inches with the largest measuring just over six inches.  However, anglers have reported catching larger Bluegills.  Yellow Perch were abundant, but most were smaller than 8 inches.  Anglers can expect to locate panfish on the edges of weed lines. <br> \n <br> \nDel Clark is known for producing large pike and fish over 40 inches and 20 pounds have been caught.  Moderate numbers of pike were present in 2019.  They averaged 26 inches with the largest measuring 28 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nPlanned management activities include fish surveys, winter fishing pressure counts, fall night electrofishing to assess young Walleye abundance, and stocking Walleyes if necessary.   <br> \n</p>",
