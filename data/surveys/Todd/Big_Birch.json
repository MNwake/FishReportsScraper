LARGEMOUTH BASS CATCHES WERE AVG FOR TRAPNETS AND ABOVE AVG FOR GILLNETS. FURTHER ASSESSMENT BY ELECTROFISHING AND SEINING NEEDS TO BE COMPLETED TO MORE ACCURATELY DETERMINE THE BASS POPULATION. LOW POPULATIONS WERE NOTED FOR NORTHERN CISCO, CARP, AN SMALLMOUTH BASS. NORTHERN PIKE CATCHES WERE SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER THAN IN 1981. CORRESPONDING WITH THE DECREASE IN NUMBERS IS AN INCREASE IN AVG SIZE AND WEIGHT. MEAN WEIGHT INCREASED FROM 1.3 TO 2.5 PDS PER FISH MEAN LENGTH INCREASED FROM 18 TO 21 INCHES. THE WEIGHTED MEAN LENGTH SHOWS THIS EVEN MORE DRAMA- TICALLY IN SHIFTING FROM 16.8 TO 21.4 INCHES. FISH UP TO 30 INCHES WERE CAUGHT IN BOTH SURVEYS, BUT ONLY 5% WERE 25 INCHES AND LARGER IN 1981 COMPARED TO 18% IN 1986.

EVEN THOUGH THE MEDIAN DECREASED ONLY 1 INCH TO 13.0 - 13.9 THE MEAN WEIGHT DROPPED FROM 2.0 TO 1.1 PDS PER FISH. A WEIGHTED MEAN LENGTH GIVES A MORE ACCURATE PICTURE OF THE CHANGE IN SIZE STRUC- TURE. THE WEIGHTED MEAN LENGTH SHIFTED FROM 16.0 TO 13.7 INCHES. SURVIVAL FROM STOCKING SHOWS UP WITH LARGE NUMBERS OF YEARLING WALLEYE. EXTENSIVE SEINING OVER THE YEARS DENOTES INSIGNIFICANT RE- CRUITMENT FROM NATURAL REPRODUCTION. GOOD NUMBERS OF MEDIUM AND LARGE SIZED WALLEYES (UP TO 27.9') ARE ALSO PRESENT AND IMPLIES A WELL BALANCED POPULATION. ALTHOUGH THE PERCENT OF FISH OVER 15 AND THE AVG SIZE DROPPED THE ACTUAL NUMBERS OF WALLEYES OVER 15 80 IN THE 1981 SURVEY COMPARED TO 88 IN THE 1986 SURVEY. DUE TO EXTREME AGING DIFFICULTY ONLY FISH TO AGE II WERE READ. AVG GROWTH FOR AGES I AND II WITH CLASS II BEING THE MOST ABUNDANT. FIFTY-SIX WALLEYES WERE SEXED AS MALES AND 146 AS FEMALES. THE YELLOW PERCH INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY FROM 6.0 TO 40.33/GILLNET. THE MEAN WT DECREASED FROM 0.24 IN  1981 TO 0.12 PER FISH IN 1986. THE LENGTH FREQUENCY RANGED FROM 5.5 PARED TO 5.0 LENGTH CHANGED FROM 7.2 TO 6.3 INCHES. THE NET CATCHES SHOWED A HIGHER SURVIVAL OF YELLOW PERCH TO A SIZE WHICH IS VULNERABLE TO THE GEAR. AN AVERAGE RATE OF GROWTH WAS SHOWN FOR AGES II THROUGH V WERE PRESENT. ONLY 7% OF THE BLUEGILLS WERE 7.0% INCHES OR GREATER. SIZES RANGED FROM 3.5 TO 8.4 INCHES. MEDIAN LENGTH WAS 5.5' - 5.9'. AVERAGE WEIGHT WAS ONLY 0.1 PDS. THE BLUEGILL POPULATION APPEARS TO BE UNCHANGED. BLACK CRAPPIE SIZES RANGED FROM 4.0 TO 12.9 INCHES WITH 8% ABOVE 9.0 MEDIAN LENGTH GROUP IS 9.0 TO 9.4. BY COMPARING THIS CATCH WITH 1981 WE SEE AN INCREASE IN SIZE AND WEIGHT. PREVIOUS WEIGHTS AND MEAN LENGTHS WERE 0.26 LBS. AND 7.0 AND 1983 23,500 PDS OF BULLHEADS WERE REMOVED COMMERCIALLY. THE RESULT WAS BASICALLY NO CHANGE IN NUMBERS AND SIZE. ALL SPECIES OF BULLHEADS AVERAGE ABOUT ONE HALF POUND. LARGE CARP ARE PRESENT IN LOW NUMBERS.

                "narrative": "<p>   Fall night electrofishing was conducted on Big Birch Lake to evaluate the survival of the 1.9 million walleye fry stocked in May.  Three electrofishing runs were made around the lake for a total of 1.15 hours of on-time.  Forty-five young-of-year walleye were netted for a catch rate of 38.8/hour in 2006 along with 10 other walleye Age I and older.  Big Birch Lake has been fry stocked in odd numbered years since 2001 and was stocked in even numbered years before that.  Fry stocking began in 1996 as a test for a less expensive method of providing a walleye fishery in the lake after fall electrofishing in 1994 suggested little or no natural reproduction occurred.  Fry stocking appeared to work some years as fall electrofising produced satisfactory catch rates and aging from gillnet catches showed good year classes.  Fall electrofishing catches were low in some years suggesting poor survival of stocked fry so fingerlings would be stocked that fall to suppliment the year class. <br> \n    The highest young-of-year walleye catch rate was 70/hour in 1998 while the lowest was 8/hour in 2001.  Higher electrofishing catch rates have corresponded to stronger year classes in gillnets.  The lake management plan was changed in 2006 to continue spring fry stocking in even numbered years and do fall fingerling stocking in odd numbered years.  The fingerling stocking amounts would be based on the size of fingerlings available, 19,000 fingerlings or up to 1,264 pounds (2 pounds per littoral acre), which ever came first.  By alternating years of fry and fingerling stocking it should be easier to evaluate the comparative effectiveness of the two methods.  Aging results from gillnet catches will also be used to compare methods.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p> An ice-out assessment was conducted on Big Birch Lake to evaluate changes to the northern pike population due to a protective regulation. A northern pike experimental regulation requiring the release of all pike over 24 inches to be released was implemented in 1996.  The regulation was modified in 2006 to a protected slot between 24 and 36 inches and a possession limit of three with one fish over 36 inches being allowed.  Evaluation of the regulation will continue until 2015.   <br> \n A lake survey trapnet was set in Fish Creek in early April.  The stream had opened up in mid-March from warm weather, but high water levels and a cool down in the weather delayed the placement of the net.   The pike catch from one night was dominated by male northern pike.  The net was then pulled and reset four days later in hopes of catching more females.  The second catch was more evenly divided between males and females.  A second lake survey net with an additional lead was set by a culvert (inlet) on the south side of the lake.  Like the Fish Creek net, the south shore (SS) net was pulled after one overnight set, but the sex ratio for the pike was almost even.   The SS net was also reset four days later.  However, cold weather refroze the open water and few fish were caught.  Twelve lake survey nets were set in Big Birch Lake in mid-April.  The ice was off the north basin, but not the south basin.  Strong winds opened up the south basin and knocked down two nets.  The nets were lifted twice for a total of 22 sets.  All gamefish were measured, except that only a subsample of black crappie and bluegill were measured.  Fin rays and scales were taken from the northern pike for age determination.  Other fish species were identified and counted.   <br> \n       The stream net in Fish Creek and the SS net captured 656 northern pike between 13.3 and 35.7 inches in length.   The lake nets captured 144 pike ranging from 8.2 to 34.3 inches in length.  Mean length for the early sample was 21.5 inches with a modal length of 20-21 inches.  Small fish dominated the catch as only 21% (n=137) of the fish were more than 24 inches in length with 3% (n=19) exceeding 30 inches.  The two nets caught a total of  646 northern pike.  The majority of the larger pike were caught in the SS net as only five of the pike exceeding 30 inches came from the Fish Creek net.  The sex ratio for the stream net was 1.3 males (n=308) to 1 female (n=241) and the SS net 1.5 males (n=65) to 1 female (n=42).  Forty-two percent of the female pike (n=102) in the stream net exceeded 24 inches compared to 74% (n=31) of the SS net.  Male northern pike more than 24 inches in length comprised 0.6% (n=2) of the stream catch and 3% (n=2) of the SS catch.  Small northern pike comprised an even greater portion of the lake catch as only 3% (n=4) of the fish were over 24 inches in length with 1% (n=2) exceeding 30 inches.  Pike in the lake sample measured from 8.2 to 34.8 inches in length with a mean length of 20 inches and modal length of 20 - 21 inches.  The sex ratio for the lake sample was 2.8 males (n=106) to 1 female (n=38).  The fish exceeding 24 inches comprised only 10% (n=4) of the female portion of the catch.  Ages 1 thru 10 were represented in the 2009 pike catch with the 2007 year class accounting for 30% of the catch.  Relative year class strength suggests that there continues to be a high level of recruitment.  Female northern pike were from one to 6.7 inches longer than the males of the same age.  The results from the 2009 spring assessment were below the long term goal of a spring northern pike catch where at least 40% of the fish exceed 24 inches with at least 5% more than 36 inches in length. The results, however, were at the mid-term objective of at least 5% of the female northern pike more than 30 inches in length.  When comparing results from the spring assessments, it appears that the long term goal may be unrealistic. <br> \n       Capturing northern pike over 30 inches in length has been a challenge in all of the spring assessments.  The greatest number of fish over 30 inches was caught in the 2003 assessment (n=22).  Those fish also comprised the greatest proportion of the catch (12% of 178 fish).  In other assessments after 1996 the proportion of pike over 30 inches has ranged from 0.8% to 3% and the numbers from two to 21 fish.  Before the regulation began in 1996, the number of pike more than 30 inches was one and two fish in the three assessments between 1993 and 1995.  The proportion of 30-inch pike in the assessments ranged from 0.6% to 2%.  Mean length in 1996 and 1995 was about 18.8 inches while it was 20 inches in 1994 and 22.6 inches in 1993.  After the regulation began in 1996, the largest mean length in a spring assessment was about 21.8 inches in 2003.  The other assessments have had mean lengths ranging from 20 (2007) to 21 inches (2009).  The worst sex ratio was recorded in 1998 when 3.3 males were caught for every female.  The stream catch in 2007 also had a comparable sex ratio (3:1) while the lake catch was 2:1 for that assessment and the large frame trapnets 1:1.  The male to female ratio in 2005 was 2:1.  For both 2003 and 1994, there were more females, (1:1.2).  In 2001 and 1995, it was equal.  <br> \n       The spring assessment conducted in 2007 was a combination of three gear types, a stream set in Fish Creek plus lake survey trapnets and large-frame trapnets set in the lake.  Evaluating the walleye population in Big Birch Lake was also an objective of the survey.  The stream set captured 595 northern pike between 9.4 and 33.5 inches in length, the trapnets caught 741 pike ranging from 10.5 to 35.7 inches, and the large-frame trapnets caught 263 pike between 12.4 to 33.6 inches.  The lake survey trapnets had the greatest portion of northern pike exceeding 24 inches (12% or n=87) while the stream net had the least (2% or n=13).  Only 7% (n=115) of the pike in the 2007 combined catch (n=1599) were more than 24 inches in length with 1% (n=20) exceeding 30 inches.  The 2005 spring assessment had a combined catch of 1130 northern pike from the stream set and lake survey trapnets in the lake.  Pike exceeding 24 inches in length accounted for 11% (n=128) of the catch while only 0.8% (n=10) were more than 30 inches.  The 1993 spring assessment had the greatest portion of the fish over 24 inches and the 2003 assessment had the greatest portion over 30 inches, 31% (n=16) and 12% (n=22), respectively, but the total catch in 1993 was only 52 northern pike while the 2003 catch was 178 fish.   <br> \n       The lake trapnets in 2009 netted 21 walleye from 16 to 27.5 inches in length.  Mean length for the sample was 21.9 inches with a modal length of 20-21 inches.  Larger fish dominated the catch as 90% of the walleye exceeded 20 inches.  When large frame trapnets have been used, such as in 2007 and 2001, more walleye have been caught.    The 2007 assessment recorded a walleye catch of 205 fish while 145 walleye were caught in 2001.  Lake survey trapnets have also produced a fair number of walleye, 117 fish in 1996 and 99 fish in 1993.  Forty-six largemouth bass were also sampled in the 2009 ice-out.  They ranged from 5.3 to 17.8 inches in length with a mean length of 12.5 inches.  Modal length for the sample was 13 - 14 inches with 54% (n=25) of the fish exceeding 12 inches and 11% (n=5) more than 15 inches in length.  Past spring assessments on Big Birch Lake have not captured many largemouth bass.  The 1996 assessment netted 46 bass and the 1993 assessment captured 37 bass.  Other assessments have had catches between 0 and 15 largemouth bass.  <br> \n       The black crappie sampled (n=40) were between 5 and 13.7 inches length with a mean length of 8.9 inches and a modal length of 5 - 5.5 inches.  Crappie exceeding 9 inches in length comprised 53% (n=21) of the catch with 28% (n=11) more than 11 inches and 13% (n=5) over 12 inches in length.  The spring ice-out assessments have typically produced low numbers of black crappie.  The exception was the 2007 assessment, which netted 344 crappie.  Even with the large sample size, an impressive sample size structure was shown.  Sixty percent (n=206) of the crappie were over 9 inches with 38% (n=129) more than 11 inches and 30% (n=103) exceeding 12 inches size.  The largest crappie caught in Big Birch Lake was nearly 15 inches from the 2007 assessment.  The 1995 assessment had a catch of 62 crappie while the 2005 assessment captured only three crappie.   <br> \n        The 315 bluegill caught in the lake trapnets were between 3.5 and 8.9 inches in length with a mean length of 6.7 inches and modal length of 6.5 - 7 inches.  Bluegill more than 7 inches in length accounted for 43% (n=137) of the catch with 13% (n=42) over 8 inches.  Bluegill catches have also varied in the spring northern pike assessments.  The 2007 assessment captured 783 bluegill while only 12 were caught in the 1994.  While a ten-inch bluegill was measured in the 2007 assessment, only 22% (n=169) of the fish were over 7 inches with 4% (n=30) more than 8 inches in length.  The 2001 assessment had a bluegill catch of 395 fish with 58% (n=230) of the bluegill over 7 inches and 34% (n=134) more than 8 inches. <br> \n       Other fish species netted during the 2009 northern pike assessment included bowfin, brown bullhead, golden shiner, hybrid sunfish, pumpkinseed, rock bass, tadpole madtom, white sucker, yellow bullhead, and yellow perch.  White sucker was the most abundant roughfish species (n=65) caught in the assessment with bowfin being a close second (n=59).   <br> \n       Big Birch Lake had a northern pike regulation implemented in 1996 that required the release of all pike over 24 inches in length.  In 2006, the regulation was modified to a protected slot between 24 and 36 inches and a possession limit of three fish with one over 36 inches allowed.  Spring assessments for northern pike have been conducted on Big Birch Lake in odd numbered years since 2001, in 1998, and annually from 1993 to 1996.  The spring assessments have varied in how they are conducted, some of the assessments were only the stream nets, while others were with a combination of lake survey nets and large-frame trapnets along with the stream net, and yet others were with the stream net and lake survey trapnets.  The 1995 assessment was the only one to catch a northern pike over 36 inches in length.    None of the results from the spring assessments have met the original regulation goals, although, the 2009 assessment met the mid-term goal.   One observation that has been made as a result of the regulation has been the presence of older fish in the samples.  Before the regulation in 1996, very few northern pike over 5 years of age were seen in the catches with none over 7 years of age until after the 1998 assessment.  The 2001 assessment had two nine-year old pike and in the 2009 assessment 5% (n=34) of the fish were over 8 years of age.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>       Big Birch Lake consists of two connected basins that cover 2,108 acres straddling the Todd/Stearns County line. A variety of fishing hot spots can be found around the lake such as islands, bays, sunken islands and bars, vegetation beds, and rock piles which provide a multitude of angling experiences.  The lake has five accesses which are open to the public, four with concrete ramps.  Although strides have been made to improve water quality in the lake, late summer water clarity was moderate to poor in 2014. Big Birch State Forest Campground which is located on the southwest side the lake has both a public boat access and fishing pier.  The lake had an experimental regulation which requires the release of all northern pike between 24 and 36 inches with one over 36 inches allowed in possession. The objective of the regulation was to improve the northern pike population size structure.   After extensive assessments and public review, a decision was made to drop the regulation and return the pike limit to the statewide regulation.  The change will take effect for the 2015 spring fishing opener. <br> \n      The lake supports a variety of gamefish that attract anglers. The primary management focus is on Walleye and Northern Pike with secondary management on Bluegill, Largemouth Bass, and Smallmouth Bass. Annual fry stocking is the current management strategy for maintaining the Walleye population in Big Birch Lake as limited natural reproduction has been documented.  Walleye numbers appear to have declined in the last two surveys.   While numbers are below the management goal for the lake, the catch rate remained within the normal range for this type of lake.   Anglers are also reporting good Walleye fishing in the winter season.   There was a broad range of sizes observed in the summer survey so there should be a size available for every type of angler.    <br> \n       Northern Pike numbers also showed a decrease in the last two surveys but continue to be high when compared to similar type lakes and above management goals.   While only a few pike over 36 inches have been observed during sampling efforts, the survey results and angler reports suggest an increase in the number of medium size fish from three to six pounds.  Some lake home owners reported seeing more fishermen trolling for Northern Pike than ever before.   <br> \n       Big Birch Lake has abundant populations of both Largemouth and Smallmouth Bass. Trophy-size bass up to 20 inches have been documented in surveys and reported by anglers, but the average size of both species in the 2014 survey was between 11 and 13 inches. Panfish species in the lake include Black Crappie, Bluegill, Pumpkinseed, hybrid sunfish, and Rock Bass.  Quality size crappie up to 12 inches and Bluegill up to 8.5 inches were observed in the summer survey, but larger fish of both species have been documented in some spring assessments.   Tullibee (Cisco) and Yellow Perch abundance appears to have decreased significantly since the last survey and numbers look low when compared to similar type lakes.  White Sucker numbers continue to be low also.  Having higher populations of these three species could be important to help maintain good growth rates in both Northern Pike and Walleye. The range of Tullibee sizes observed could provide a prey source to the larger predator fish as well as attract anglers. Most of the perch were too small to be of interest to anglers, but they were a good size as a food source for gamefish. Other fish species netted during the summer survey included Black Bullhead, Brown Bullhead, and Yellow Bullhead. Yellow bullheads were the most abundant of the three bullhead species.  Individuals over 13 inches were found in all three species. Two additional species that were sampled in the spring assessment were Bowfin or Dogfish and Common Carp.  <br> \n      Fishermen and recreational boaters are reminded that they need to be diligent about cleaning both their boats and trailers when going between lakes to prevent the spread of exotics. Improving the water quality in Big Birch Lake has been and should be a high priority of the lake association and landowners around the lake. Preservation of the emergent vegetation beds can improve water quality, reduce shoreline erosion, and provide valuable fish habitat. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Big Birch Lake is a 2,108-acre, clear-water lake located about two miles south of Grey Eagle. It's a popular lake for fishing and recreational watercraft with five public access sites; four with concrete boat ramps. The Birch Lakes State Forest is located on the west side of the lake and offers public recreation opportunities including a campground, fishing pier and swimming beach. On-lake activity can be busy during summer weekends and holidays, but quiet fishing experiences can also be found during the week. Lakeshore residential development is moderate to heavy however the lake retains a natural feel and there are occasional stretches of private and publicly-owned shoreline that provide natural aesthetic scenery. Other lakes in the Little Falls Management Area that are similar to Big Birch include Little Birch, Alexander and Shamineau. <br> \n <br> \nFish management is primarily for Walleyes. Annual fry stocking has established a good fishery. Lake surveys regularly sample Walleyes over 25 inches but the majority are between 14 and 18 inches. In the past 15 years, the Walleye fishery has changed very little. Anglers will find a variety of underwater structure in Birch Lake and traditional presentations can be successful in all four seasons.  <br> \n <br> \nOther gamefish providing good fishing opportunities include Smallmouth Bass, Largemouth Bass and Northern Pike. Smallmouth Bass are moderately abundant and have been sampled up to 20 inches in length. Largemouth Bass seem to be present in higher numbers with 13 to 15 inch-fish most common. Northern Pike average size is about 21 inches, but individuals over 30 inches are regularly sampled during spring ice-out netting surveys. Bluegills and Black Crappies can provide plenty of action, especially from the shore or dock. Individual sizes sampled during surveys are average.  <br> \n <br> \nAt this time, Big Birch Lake still supports Ciscoes, a cold-water fish that's an indicator species of lakes with high water quality. Ciscoes provide a rich source of forage for large predatory fish such as pike and Walleye. They're unfortunately declining in some lakes due to climate change and nutrient runoff. Their greatest period of stress occurs in late summer when oxy-thermal habitat is most limited. Summer oxy-thermal habitat is found at mid-lake depths where the temperature is below 70 degrees and dissolved oxygen is adequately present. Hotter, longer summers coupled with high nutrient runoff can put the squeeze on this deeper layer of oxy-thermal habitat these fish depend on. Ciscoes are more resilient to warmer water temperatures than other cold-water species like Burbot, Lake Whitefish and Lake Trout which live further north. As such, Cisco habitat can be maintained if farmers, lakeshore residents, townships, counties and other stakeholders minimize nutrient runoff by giving up the use of fertilizers and embrace shoreline vegetative buffer strips or cover crops as the situation pertains. In the end, better land stewardship can help sustain critical habitat for Ciscoes and other species if we work together.    <br> \n <br> \nBig Birch Lake contains zebra mussels. People are reminded that they must inspect their boat or personal watercraft and trailer when leaving the lake access to prevent the spread of aquatic invasive species (AIS).  Not doing so is irresponsible and carries a $500 civil penalty or misdemeanor.   <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>       Big Birch Lake consists of two connected basins that cover 2,108 acres straddling the Todd/Stearns County line.  A variety of fishing hot spots can be found around the lake such as islands, bays, sunken islands and bars, vegetation beds, and rock piles which provide a multitude of angling experiences.  Although strides have been made to improve water quality in the lake, late summer water clarity was moderate to poor in 2010.   The lake has five accesses which are open to the public, four with concrete ramps.  Big Birch State Forest Campground which is located on the southwest side the lake has both a public access and fishing pier.  The lake has an experimental regulation which requires the release of all northern pike between 24 and 36 inches with one over 36 inches allowed in possession.   The objective of the regulation is to improve the northern pike population size structure. <br> \n       The lake supports a variety of gamefish that attract anglers.  The primary management focus is on walleye and northern pike with secondary management on bluegill, largemouth bass, and smallmouth bass.  Walleye management was formerly fry or fingerling stocking every year, and as of 2011 will be changed to annual fry stocking.  Some natural reproduction has been documented as well.  Walleye numbers have increased significantly since the last survey and are within the management goals for the lake.  Most of the walleye caught in the summer survey were between 10 and 12 inches which are a size that begins to attract anglers.  That year class could provide some excellent fishing in the near future.   <br> \n       Northern pike also showed a significant increase in abundance.  Results from the summer survey and a 2010 spring assessment also show an overall improvement in the northern pike population size structure.  While only a few pike over 36 inches have been observed during sampling efforts, the survey results and angler reports suggest an increase in the number of medium size fish from three to six pounds.  Some lake home owners report seeing more fishermen trolling for northern pike than ever before.  Compliance with the regulation is important to achieve improvements in the northern pike population. <br> \n       Big Birch Lake has abundant populations of both largemouth and smallmouth bass.  Trophy-size bass up to 20 inches have been documented in surveys and reported by anglers, but the average size of both species in the survey was between 12 and 14 inches.  Panfish species in the lake include black crappie, bluegill, pumpkinseed, hybrid sunfish, and rock bass.  While some quality size crappie up to 12 inches and bluegill up to nine inches were observed in the summer survey, the spring assessment sampled crappie up to 14 inches and bluegill up to ten inches.  <br> \n       Tullibee (cisco) and yellow perch abundance have improved significantly since the last survey, however, white sucker numbers continue to be low.  Having higher populations of these three species is important to maintain good growth rates in both northern pike and walleye.   The range of tullibee sizes could provide a prey source to the larger predator fish as well as attract anglers.  Most of the perch were too small to be of interest to anglers, but they were a good size as a food source for gamefish. <br> \n       Other fish species netted during the summer survey included black bullhead, brown bullhead, and yellow bullhead.  Yellow bullheads were the most abundant of the three species of bullhead.  Individuals over 11 inches were found in all three species.  Two additional species that were sampled in the spring assessment were bigmouth buffalo and bowfin or dogfish.  The 2010 assessment was the first documented catch of bigmouth buffalo. <br> \n       Fishermen and recreational boaters are reminded that they need to be diligent about cleaning both their boats and trailers when going between lakes to prevent the spread of exotics.  Improving the water quality in Big Birch Lake has been and should be a high priority of the lake association and landowners around the lake.  Preservation of the emergent vegetation beds can improve water quality, reduce shoreline erosion, and provide valuable fish habitat. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>    Big Birch Lake consists of two connected basins that cover 2,108 acres straddling the Todd/Stearns County line.  The lake has a maximum depth of 81 feet in the lower basin and 65 feet in the upper basin.  A variety of fishing hot spots can be found around the lake such as islands, bays, sunken islands, sunken bars, vegetation beds, and rock piles which provide a multitude of angling experiences.   Water clarity was moderate to poor for the time of year which may have been the results of lower water levels and a hot summer.   Aquatic vegetation was found to grow to a depth of 19 feet with the most common submergent species being muskgrass, coontail, bushy pondweed, and sago pondweed.  Marl and sand were the most common shallow water substrates around the lake.  A state forest campground with a boat access and fishing pier is located on the southwest side of the lake.  The Big Birch Lake Association has taken a very active role in trying to improve water qualtiy in the lake.  They have encouraged local agricultural producers and lakeshore property owners, both with money and information, to use best management practices.\n     The lake supports a variety of gamefish that can provide an opportunity to catch quality size fish.  The primary management focus is on walleye and northern pike.  Walleye fry or fingerlings are stocked every year to sustain the fishery and some natural reproduction has been documented as well.  Abundance showed a slight improvement from the last survey and numbers continue to be within the normal range for similar type lakes.  A wide range of sizes, between 8 to 28 inches, were seen in the summer survey and walleye up to 30 inches were documented in a spring trapnet assessment.  Fishing reports have been good for much of the year for walleye.\n     Northern pike abundance showed a significant decrease since the last survey in 2003 but continues to be above management goals for the lake.  Average size of the pike was about 2 pounds with a fair number of fish over 24 inches.  An experimental regulation implemented in 1996 that required the release of all northern pike over 24 inches was modified in 2006 to a protected slot between 24 and 36 inches and a possession limit of 3 with one over 36 inches allowed.  While few pike over 36 inches have been observed during sampling efforts, the survey results and angler reports suggest an increase in the number of medium size fish.  It is hoped that having more large northern pike in the population wil help to keep total pike numbers down and growth good.  This typically leads to a healthier fish community with a good balance of predators and prey.  Another desired outcome of the regulation is to provide an opportunity to  anglers to catch large pike in excess of 10 pounds; a feat becoming increasingly difficult in Minnesota.  Compliance with the regulation is important to achieve improvements in both northern pike and walleye populations.\n     Largemouth and smallmouth bass are both abundant in Big Birch Lake.  Trophy-size bass up to 20 inches have been reported by anglers, but average size of both species in the survey was between 11 and 14 inches.  Panfish species in the lake include black crappies, bluegills, pumpkinseeds, hybrid sunfish, and rock bass.  Gillnets were the only sampling method to be used in this survey since gamefish were the primary targets, but trapnets used this spring to evaluate the northern pike population caught good numbers of panfish.   While some quality size crappies up to 13 inches and bluegills up to 9 inches were observed in the gillnet survey, the spring trapnets sampled crappies up to 15 inches and bluegills up to 10 inches in length.  Anglers have also reported catching nice size crappies and bluegills.\n     Abundance of three prey species, white sucker, yellow perch, and tullibee (cisco), which gamefish feed on, were low with the perch and tullibee being at their lowest levels ever.  Perch numbers have fluctuated from survey to survey which may be the result of high pike numbers and the walleye stocking.  High numbers of perch in a range of sizes are desirable to provide a prey base for all predator species to maintain good growth rates.  Tullibee and sucker numbers have shown declines since 1995, however, growth rates of predators are still decent.  \n      Other fish species netted during the survey included bowfin (dogfish), brown bullheads, common carp, shorthead redhorse, and yellow bullheads.  Yellow bullheads were the more numerous of two bulhead species which may indicate good water quality as they are more abundant in lakes with clear water.  Carp do not appear to be at levels detrimental to the lake habitats.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Big Birch Lake is a 2,107-acre lake located near Grey Eagle, Minnesota. The lake has 15.25 miles of shoreline, a maximum depth of 81 feet, and a littoral area of 642 acres. It has been primarily managed for Walleye and Northern Pike secondarily for Bluegill, Largemouth Bass, and Smallmouth Bass.  Night electrofishing has been used to evaluate the success of spring Walleye fry stocking. <br> \n  <br> \nFall night electrofishing has been completed on an annual or biennial basis since 1994 in Big Birch Lake.  Fry stocking commenced in 1996 on a biennial basis through 2000.  Fry were stocked during odd numbered years from 2001 to 2005 in conjunction with contingency fingerling stocking.  Even year fry stocking took place from 2006 to 2010 and fry have been stocked on an annual basis since that time.  A stocking rate of roughly 3,000 fry per littoral acre was employed until 2016 when the use of a lower rate (1,500 per littoral acre) was incorporated in alternating years with the original higher rate. <br> \n <br> \n Fall night electrofishing was conducted at two of the four standard electrofishing stations around Big Birch Lake totaling a half hour of on- time.   Outboard motor problems reduced the overall effort which is usually a whole hour of on-time.  These efforts were performed to evaluate success of annual alternate rate (1,500 fry/littoral area and 3,000 fry/littoral area) fry stocking.  Two Walleye were netted during the electrofishing runs (10.6 and 11.5 inches).  The young of year (YOY) Walleye catch rate was 0 fish per hour.  This was the lowest catch in the last 23 years and the average catch rate over the last 10 efforts was 23 fish per hour.  These results suggest little if any survival of stocked Walleye fry in 2019 when the lower rate was used.  This lower rate was also stocked in 2016 and 2017 with substandard catch rates of 12/hour and 5/hour, respectively.  The 2018 catch rate was also relatively low at 16/hour when the higher stocking rate of 3,000 per littoral acre was practiced. <br> \n <br> \nDue to the lower than desired rate of return from fry stocking since 2016 an unplanned stocking of fingerlings took place in the fall of 2019.  Statewide availability of Walleye fingerlings was good in 2019 allowing for this additional stocking to occur.  The lake was stocked with a total of 618 lbs. (1 lb./littoral area) of Walleye fingerlings that averaged 28 fish per pound.  Walleye fingerling stockings may be considered in the future if fry stocking continues to produce unfavorable results and sufficient supplies of fingerlings are available. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>      An ice-out assessment was conducted on Big Birch Lake in 2013 to evaluate the Northern Pike population.   A Northern Pike experimental regulation requiring the release of all pike over 24 inches was implemented in 1996.  The regulation was later modified in 2006 to a protected slot between 24 and 36 inches with one fish over 36 inches allowed in possession.  The regulation is up for review in March of 2015 and a decision will be made to either drop the regulation or make it permanent. <br> \n     The ice-out assessment included setting early nets in Fish Creek and near the inlet from a small marsh on the south side of Big Birch Lake to intercept spawning pike.  Attempts were made to set additional trap nets in the lake when access to open areas was possible.   Late ice melt and shifting ice in the lake allowed only ten trap nets to be set in a one week period.   The late, cooler spring and low stream flows likely had a negative effect on pike catches in both stream and lake trap nets. <br> \n      All Northern Pike, Walleye, Largemouth Bass, Black Crappie, and most of the Bluegill were measured.  Other fish species were identified and counted.  Scales were taken from male and female Northern Pike to compare age classes and growth rates between the sexes.   A partial fin-clip was given to the left anal fin to keep track of recaptures.  Recaptured fish were noted but not re-measured.   Seven females and sixteen males were recaptured in the stream sets.   All pike in the lake nets were new fish although one was a fish marked from a previous ice-out assessment.  <br> \n     A total of 458 Northern Pike were netted with the two gear types in the 2013 ice-out assessment.  Ice-out assessments were also conducted in 2010, odd years between 2001 and 2009, and five years between 1993 and 1998.  Not all of the ice-out assessments were conducted with the same gear types.  A table included at the end of the report shows the results from all ice-out assessments.  After the 2010 ice-out assessment, there appeared to be an improvement in the proportion of fish exceeding thirty inches in length, however, the percentage declined in 2013 and resembled results from the 2009 assessment. <br> \n     Ages 2 through 10 were represented in the female portion of the 2013 ice-out assessment and ages 1 through 8 in the male portion.   The abundant year classes suggest consistent recruitment.  A strong year class from 2009 accounted for 31% of the combined catch.  Prior to implementation of the regulation few Northern Pike were documented beyond 6 years of age.   Age 1 males displayed fast growth while the remaining age groups of both sexes showed normal growth when compared to an Area Mean Back-calculated Length table.  Females grew from 2.6 to 5.8 inches longer than males of the same age.   <br> \n      The small sample sizes for Northern Pike gathered in ice-out assessments prior to the regulation implementation (1996) may not have provided a reliably accurate representation of past pike populations.  Extensive ice-out netting completed since 1998 has not shown a trend of steadily increasing mean length, mean weight, % of fish over 24 inches, or % of females over 30 inches.  There does appear to be more Northern Pike exceeding thirty inches than were present before the regulation.   <br> \n     Lake trap nets in previous assessments typically were more effective than the stream nets at catching a sample size with a longer mean length and heavier mean weight.  With the late ice-out in 2013, the majority of pike likely spawned under the ice and did not frequent the shoal waters during the netting period.  In the 2013 assessment, more and larger female pike were netted in the stream nets.  Seventy-five of the pike from the stream sample were females greater than 24 inches in length compared to only six females in the lake nets.  In the 2010 pike assessment when comparing the same type of nets, seventy-two females exceeding twenty-four inches were caught in the lake trap nets while forty-one females were in the stream nets. <br> \n     Some of the previous ice-out assessments have also been used to provide data on the Walleye population in Big Birch Lake.  The lake nets were usually moved to rocky substrates or open sand favored by spawning Walleye later in the assessments and large-frame trap nets were also incorporated.  The ice-out assessments in 2010 and 2007 targeted both Northern Pike and Walleye and used standard lake survey trap nets as well as large-frame trap nets.    Catches of 219 and 262 Walleye were recorded in 2010 and 2007, respectively.  Fewer Walleye (n=32) were sampled in the 2013 assessment as Northern Pike was the target species.   <br> \n     Smaller Walleye comprised a greater proportion of the 2013 sample than in previous assessments.  The largest Walleye in 2013 was only 23.2 inches compared to maximum lengths of 27.5 to 30.3 inches in prior assessments.   This was likely due to the late ice-out and the majority of the female Walleyes having finished spawning. <br> \n     Other fish species sampled in the 2013 ice-out assessment included eight Largemouth Bass between 10.2 and 17.8 inches in length as well as fifty Black Crappie from 5.8 to 13 inches in length.  Twenty-eight Bluegill up to 8.7 inches were sampled in the lake trap nets.   Bowfin, Brown Bullhead, Green Sunfish, hybrid sunfish, Pumpkinseed, Rock Bass, and Yellow Perch were also sampled.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>        In 2010 annual Walleye fry stocking became the management tool used to sustain the Walleye population in Big Birch Lake.  Previous management strategies included every other year fingerling stocking, stocking fry one year and fingerlings the next, and biennial fry stocking.  Fall night electrofishing has been the method used to evaluate survival of juvenile Walleye.  A new, more efficient electrofishing boat was acquired in 2007 which generally increased catch rates for most species.  Three runs were conducted around the lake for a total of 1.2 hours of on-time in 2013. <br> \n        Results from the 2013 electrofishing effort were comparable to both 2012 and 2010 outcomes.  The 2013 young of the year Walleye catch rate of 16.1/hour was similar to the 16.3/hour in 2012 and 14.6/hour in 2010.  The highest young of the year Walleye catch from fall electrofishing was recorded in 2011 at 74.5/hour.  The 2008 fall electrofishing produced a similar catch rate, 73/hour.   <br> \n       Although the newer electrofishing boat has generally improved efficiency, the older boat also produced some good catch rates suggesting the presence of higher numbers of young of the year Walleye those years.   A catch rate of 69/hour was produced in 1998, with catches of 38.8/hour in both 2006 and 1996.  Catch rates in other years ranged from 7.9/hour in 2001 to 22/hour in 2005, although the record low was 0/hour in 1994. <br> \n       An additional eleven Walleye between 10.8 and 17 inches in length were netted during the 2013 fall electrofishing effort.  Scales were collected from the fish to verify year class.  Year classes 2012 through 2009 were represented in the aged sample (n=11).  The majority of fish came from 2011 (36%; n=4) and 2010 (45%; n=5) year classes.  \t <br> \n      Catch rates of young of year Walleye in fall electrofishing have corresponded to year class strengths observed in subsequent gill net surveys.  However, some observations have been complicated by contingency fingerling stocking.  An attached table shows the year Walleye fry were stocked, the fall electrofishing catch rate, and the number of fish from that year class in summer gill net catches. <br> \n     Other fish species observed during the 2013 fall electrofishing effort included Bluegill, Yellow Perch, Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, Smallmouth Bass, shiners, White Sucker, Yellow Bullhead, Rock Bass, Common Carp, Bowfin, hybrid sunfish, and Logperch.   </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Big Birch Lake straddles the Todd/Stearns County line and can provide a multitude of angling experiences.  The lake has a maximum depth of 81 feet and covers 2,108 acres in two connected basins.  The lake has a variety of fishing hot spots including islands, bays, sunken islands, sunken bars, vegetation beds, and rock piles.  The most common shoalwater substate is sand along with some gravel, rubble, boulders areas around the lake.  A state forest campground is located on the southwest side of the lake.  The Big Birch Lake Association has taken a very active role in trying to improve water quality in the lake.  They have encouraged local agricultural producers and lakeshore property owners, both with money and information, to use best management practices.    The lake supports a variety of gamefish that can provide an oppportunity to catch quality size fish.  While the walleye appears to have decreased in abundance, they continue to be within the normal range for similar type lakes.  A wide range of sizes from 9 to almost 29 inches were seen in the survey with the average size being about 17 inches.  The walleye population is almost entirely the result of stocking as very few naturally produced fish have been observed in surveys.  A heavy fingerling stocking was done in the fall of 2003 to supplement the spring fry stocking to ensure a good year class.      Northern pike abundance appears to have increased which could have a negative effect on the fish community in the lake.  Average size of the pike was about 2 pounds with a fair number of fish over 24 inches.  An experimental regulation requiring the release of all northern pike 24 inches and over was implemented in 1996.  While few pike over 35 inches have been observed during sampling efforts, the survey results and angler reports suggest an increase in the number of medium size fish.  It is hoped that having more large northern pike in the population will help to keep total pike numbers down.  This typically leads to a healthier fish community with a good balance of predators and prey.  Another desired outcome of the regulation is to provide an opportunity to anglers to catch trophy pike in excess of 20 pounds; a feat becoming increasingly difficult in Minnesota.  Compliance with the regulation is important to achieve improvements in both northern pike and walleye populations.      Big Birch Lake has abundant populations of both largemouth and smallmouth bass.  Trophy size fish up to 20 inches have been reported by anglers, but average size of both species in the survey was between 11 and 13 inches.  Panfish species in the lake include black crappies, bluegills, hybrid sunfish, rock bass, and pumpkinseeds.  Gillnets and electrofishing were the only methods used to assess the  fish community as gamefish were the primary targets and trapnets are tyically the method used for evaluating panfish populations.  Some quality size crappies up to almost 14 inches and bluegills over 9 inches were observed in the survey, however.  Anglers have also reported catching nice size bluegills.      Yellow perch abundance flucuates in Big Birch Lake and currently appears to be low which may be the result of high pike numbers.  High numbers of perch in a range of sizes are desirable to provide a prey base for all predator species to maintain good growth rates.  The tullibee (cisco) and white sucker numbers also showed a decline from the last survey and are low when compared to similar type lakes.  These two species could provide an additional food source for the larger northern pike and walleye.      Other fish species netted during the survey included bowfin or dogfish and carp.  Dogfish abundance appears to be high which was also noted in a spring netting done on Big Birch Lake.  Carp do not appear to be at levels detrimental to the lake habitats.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>    Walleye management on Big Birch Lake has varied through the years from annual fingerling stocking to every other year fingerling stocking, fry stocking one year and fingerling stocking the next, and annual fry stocking.  The current strategy is annual fry stocking which was initiated in 2010.  The previous strategy was fry stocking in even numbered years with fingerling stocking in odd numbered years.  Fall electrofishing has been used to evaluate survival of juvenile walleye.  A new, more efficient electrofishing boat was acquired in 2007 which generally increased catch rates for most species.  The fall electrofishing effort in 2010 found a lower number of young of the year walleye than desired which prompted fry stocking again in 2011.  A decision was then made to change to annual fry stocking.   <br> \n     The fall electrofishing effort in 2012 consisted of three runs for a total of 1.5 hours of on-time.   Twenty-four juvenile walleye were caught for a catch rate of 16.3/hour which was  similar to the 2010 catch rate of 14.6/hour.  The highest walleye young of year catch rate to date was 74.5/hour in 2011 when 90 juveniles were netted.  The fall electrofishing effort in 2008 netted 94 young of the year walleye for a catch rate of 70/hour, the second highest for Big Birch Lake.  Previous catch rates from 1996 to 2006 ranged from 8/hour (2001) to 69/hour (1998) with the older, less efficient electrofishing boat. <br> \n     Forty-six adult walleye were also netted during the 2012 fall electrofishing runs.  The fish ranged from 9.1 to 16.7 inches in length.  Scales were taken from thirteen fish of various sizes to verify year class.   Forty-three (93%) of the walleye were yearlings between 9.1 and 12 inches in length.  The three larger fish were from year classes 2010 to 2008.   <br> \n    Other fish species observed included largemouth bass, yellow perch, northern pike, bluegill, hybrid sunfish, black crappie, brook silverside, logperch, common carp, pumpkinseed, bowfin, white sucker, shiners, and smallmouth bass.   <br> \n     Electrofishing catch rates of over 70/hour appear to equate to a strong year class as evidenced in both 2008 and 1998.  The walleye gill net catch in 2010 suggests high recruitment of fish from the 2008 stocking as 65% of the sample was from that year class.  The 1998 year class was too young to show up in the 1999 survey, but they accounted for a significant portion of the walleye catch in the 2003 survey (32%).  The same results can be expected from the 2011 year class in future surveys and angler reports.  The last four electrofishing efforts have shown a pattern of every other year producing a high young of year walleye catch rate for Big Birch Lake.  Strong year classes may be suppressing the following year class and thus producing the low young of year catches. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Walleye are very abundant in Big Birch Lake at the present time.  The 1995gillnet catch of 20.4/set was a record high and well above normal for the lake'sclassification.  Walleye of all sizes from 7 to 27+ inches were sampled, howeverfish in the 14-16 inch range were especially numerous.  A strong 1992 year classaccounted for 43% of the summer catch.  Stocking appears to maintain the walleyepopulation.  Walleye reproduction checks and stocking gaps have failed todemonstrate any natural contribution in recent years.     Northern pike were also found in above normal numbers (9.4/gillnet).  Youngfish dominated the catch as two year olds comprised 65% of the sample.  Few largefish were observed with only 14% of the catch exceeding 24 inches long.  A 37 inchpike was captured during ice-out netting in 1995.     High populations of predators (walleye,northern pike) were likely responsiblefor the significant decline of the yellow perch population from 30.4/gillnet in1991 to 4.6/gillnet in 1995.  The reduced abundance of perch is a concern as theyare an important prey species.  Good perch abundance often results in betterwalleye fingerling survival and also increased growth rates for predators andbluegills.     Spring electrofishing showed largemouth bass were present in normal abundancewhen compared to other area lakes.  Fish up to 17 inches were observed with mostin the 11-15 inch range.  Natural reproduction was consistent with several agegroups of largemouth well represented.  Smallmouth bass were also sampled duringspring electrofishing.  Smallmouth up to 21 inches were measured indicating the\"trophy\" potential of the lake.  Consistent recruitment was also evident forsmallmouth as many sizes and age groups were noted.     Bluegill and black crappie numbers were normal and showed little change since1991.  The bluegill population was dominated by 6 year old fish (50% of sample)resulting in increased availability of \"keeper\" size fish (7+ inches).  Blackcrappie up to 13 inches long were captured during the 1995 ice-out assessment.  Astrong 1993 year class of black crappie was observed in 1995 sampling suggestingthe abundance of catchable size crappies may increase in the next few years.     Tullibee and white sucker net catches were high in 1995.  These species offeralternative prey sources for predators which may take some of the pressure off thelow yellow perch prey population.     Efforts directed at preserving or enhancing water quality and fish habitat areimportant to maintaining the healthy and diverse fish community presently found inBig Birch Lake.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Big Birch Lake is a 2,107-acre lake located near Grey Eagle, Minnesota. The lake consists of an upper and lower basin, has 15.25 miles of shoreline, a maximum depth of 81 feet, and a littoral area of 642 acres. Primary management species on Big Birch Lake are Northern Pike and Walleye while secondary species include Bluegill, Largemouth Bass, and Smallmouth Bass. Night electrofishing in fall has been used to evaluate the success of natural reproduction or spring Walleye fry stocking. A spring stocking of 1,900,000 Walleye fry occurred on May 5, 2023. <br> \n <br> \nFall night electrofishing has been completed on an annual or biennial basis since 1994 on Big Birch Lake to evaluate young of the year Walleye abundance. Fry stocking commenced in 1996 on a biennial basis (every other year) through 2000. Fry were stocked during odd numbered years from 2001 to 2005 and were backed up with contingency fingerling stocking if fry survival was found to be poor. Even year fry stocking took place from 2006 to 2010 and fry have been stocked on an annual basis since that time. A stocking rate of roughly 3,000 fry per littoral acre was employed until 2016, then the use of a lower rate (1,500 per littoral acre) was incorporated in alternating years to evaluate if a lower density stocking rate would meet management goals. Results suggested the higher stocking rate produced higher fall catch rates. <br> \n <br> \nPrior fall young of the year Walleye assessments were conducted utilizing one hour of on-time. On-time was increased to two hours beginning in 2020 as Big Birch Lake is included in a research study to assess the impacts of zebra mussels on Walleye recruitment. In fall 2023, electrofishing efforts were performed to evaluate fry stocking success. No young of the year Walleye were captured in 1.5 hours of sampling effort. Historically, fall electrofishing catch rates have ranged from 0.0/hour (1994, 2019 and 2020) to 74.5/hour (2011) with a median of 16.1/hour. Young of the year Walleye fall electrofishing catch rates typically correlate well with future Walleye year class strength. Typically, fall catch rates above 35 YWAE per hour indicate good future year classes (greater than 2.0/gill net in standard surveys) whereas lower catch rates predict poorer year classes. A total of 8 yearling Walleye ranging from 9.25 to 12.52 inches were captured for a catch rate of 5.33/hour. <br> \n <br> \nDue to low fall young of the year Walleye electrofishing catches since 2016, the stocking strategy has been changed on Big Birch Lake. Walleye fry will continue to be stocked in odd numbered years. In even years, 642 pounds of Walleye fingerlings will be stocked by DNR, and an option will be given to the lake group to purchase an additional 642 pounds from a private producer. It is hoped that this strategy will help maintain the Walleye population at a level consistent with management goals. It is important to note that a recent infestation of Zebra Mussels may impact future Walleye populations by impacting productivity in the lake. Big Birch Lake has been included in important ongoing research to determine potential impacts of Zebra Mussels on Walleye populations in lakes in Minnesota. <br> \n <br> \nOther species commonly observed during sampling included Black Crappie, Bluegill, Bowfin, Brook Silverside, Hybrid Sunfish, Largemouth Bass, Pumpkinseed, Rock Bass, Smallmouth Bass and White Sucker. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Big Birch Lake straddles the Todd/Stearns County border and can provide a multitude of quality angling experiences.  The lake has a maximum depth of 81 feet and covers 2,108 acres in two connected basins.  Approximately 30% of the lake's area is less than 15 feet deep.  Water clarity is typically moderate in summer and good during winter.  Occasional algae blooms can cause the water to have a greenish appearance.  Big Birch Lake has an outlet that flows to Little Birch Lake and eventually empties into the Sauk River via Adley Creek.  Bottom types in shallow water (shoalwater) were mainly sand although some areas had gravel, rubble, and boulder.  Marl was present as an additional component in much of the shoalwater substrate.  Vegetation was found growing to a depth of 19 feet with coontail, northern water milfoil, bushy pondweed, and flatstem pondweed having the highest frequency of occurrence.  Common emergent type plants included waterlily (both white and yellow), bulrush, and cattail.   A campground, which is currently being upgraded, is located within the Big Birch State Forest.  The Big Birch Lake Property Owners Association has taken a proactive approach in maintaining and improving water quality by encouraging local agricultural producers and lakeshore property owners to use best management practices.     Big Birch Lake is a multi-species angler's dream with quality populations of walleye, northern pike, panfish, largemouth bass and smallmouth bass present.  Walleye numbers were well above average when compared to similar lakes and past surveys suggest this is typical.  This population is almost entirely the result of stocking as very few naturally produced fish have been observed in surveys.  Currently, a huge year class of \"keeper\" size walleye has resulted from of fry stocking in the spring of 1996.  This year class produced fast action during the 1999 season. The presence of another good year class from 1998 should ensure continued excellent walleye angling in the next few years.  Walleye captured during the survey ranged from 7.8 to 25.3 inches with the majority in the 12 to 16 inch range.  Trophy fish are available as anglers occasionally report catching 10 pounders.     Big Birch Lake has not had a reputation for producing large northern pike although this may change in the future.  An experimental regulation requiring the release of all northern pike 24 inches and larger was implemented in 1996.  Benefits of this regulation are possibly being seen already as the mean length of pike sampled in nets has jumped from 20.6 inches in 1995 to 23.1 inches during this survey.  In addition, the number of fish 24 inches and larger has increased from 14% of the catch in 1995 to 40% of the catch in 1999.  It is hoped that having more large northern pike in the population will help keep totalpike numbers down.  This typically leads to a healthier fish community with a good balance of predators and prey.  Another desired outcome is to provide anglers an opportunity to catch trophy pike in excess of 20 pounds; a feat becoming increasingly difficult in Minnesota.  Compliance with the regulation is important to achieve improvements in both northern pike and walleye populations.     Bass anglers have their choice of pursuing either largemouth or smallmouth bass on Big Birch Lake as excellent habitat exists for both species.  Spring electrofishing sampled largemouth between 4.2 and 17.2 inches and smallmouth between 7.4 and 18.9 inches.  Trophy individuals of both species exceeding 20 inches are commonly reported by anglers.  It is recommended that smallmouth over 10 inches and largemouth over 12 inches be released to help sustain these quality fisheries.            Bluegill and black crappie provide very good opportunities for panfish anglers.  Both species display normal to fast growth in Big Birch Lake and desirable sizes are present.  Bluegills in the 6 to 8 inch range were common and individuals exceeding 8.5 inches were seen.  Most black crappie caught during the survey were in the 8 inch range suggesting good fishing in the future.  Crappies over 10 inches were captured during the 1999 electrofishing assessment.     Big Birch lake has desirable populations of prey species which includes tullibee (cisco), white sucker, and yellow perch.  Tullibee from 12.4 to 18.0 inches and white suckers from 10.8 to 21.1 inches provide large predators with an excellent nutrient source.  High numbers of yellow perch in a range of sizes (5.4 to 8.2 inches) also provides an excellent prey base for all predator species, and is important for maintaining a walleye population at it's current level.     Other species present in Big Birch Lake include: bullhead (black, brown, yellow), bowfin (dogfish), common carp, green sunfish, hybrid sunfish, pumpkinseed sunfish, and rock bass.  Shoreline seining captured several shiner and minnow species as well as young-of-the-year bluegill, largemouth bass, smallmouth bass, and yellow perch.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>    A lake survey trapnet was set in Fish Creek at the end of March before the ice went out on the lake.  Flows were low for spring time and water temperature was about 39 degrees.  The net was pulled after 2 lifts and a modified lake survey net with two leads reset a day later.  Another lake survey trapnet was also set before ice-out on the south shore of Big Birch Lake by a culvert from a small wetland south of the lake.  After ice-out in the lake, large-frame trapnets and standard lake survey trapnets were set in locations targetting both northern pike and walleye.  Spring assessments for northern pike have been conducted on Big Birch Lake in odd numbered years since 2001, in 1998, and annually from 1993 to 1996.  A northern pike experimental regulation requiring the release of all pike over 24 inches to be released was implemted in 1996.  The regulation was modified in 2006 to a protected slot between 24 and 36 inches and a possession limit of three with one fish over 36 inches being allowed.  Evaluation of the regulation will continue until 2015.  Scales were taken from the pike and spines from the walleye for ageing data.  The length frequency distribution data does not include recaptured walleye.  A sample size of scales from 100 pike females and 100 males was desired for growth comparison.  The goal of the spring assessment is to have catches where 40% of the northern pike exceed 24 inches with at least 5% exceeding 36 inches.  The mid-term objective is to have 5% of the pike in the spring assessment exceed 30 inches in length. <br> \n     The stream net in Fish Creek captured 595 northern pike from 9 to 34 inches in length with a mean length of 18.8 inches.  Small pike dominated the catch as only 2% (n=13) of the fish were more than 24 inches in length and 0.1% (n=1) exceeded 30 inches.  Fifty-five percent (55%; n=327) of the pike were between 18 and 21 inches in length.  Males outnumbered females 3 to 1 in the stream sample.  The stream net in the 2005 northern pike assessment caught 799 pike between 10 and 33 inches in length.  Although the sample size was bigger than in 2007, the size structure of the catch was slightly better.  Mean length was 20.5 inches and 10% (n=83) of the fish exceeded 24 inches with 0.5% (n=4) more than 30 inches in length.  The best population size structure in the stream net was displayed in the 2003 catch of 117 northern pike.  Mean length for that sample was 22.7 inches with 35% (n=41) of the fish exceeding 24 inches with 15% (n=18)  exceeding 30 inches.  Ages 1 thru 6 and 8 were represented in the 2007 stream net with 2004 year class accounting for 57% of the catch. <br> \n     The 2007 standard lake survey trapnets set in the lake captured 741 northern pike between 10 and 36 inches in length.  The lake survey trapnet catch displayed the best catch size structure of the three sample methods used in the 2007 assessment.  Mean length was 20.8 inches with 12% (n=87) of the pike more than 24 inches in length and 2% (n=17) exceeding 30 inches.  The proportion of northern pike between 18 and 21 inches, however,  was comparable to that seen in the stream sample (54%; n=404).  The lake survey nets in 2005 captured 332 pike from 9 to 36 inches in length.  The sample size structure was similar to the 2007 results with a mean length of 20.7 inches  and 14% (n=45) of the fish over 24 inches with 2% (n=6) exceedng 30 inches.  The 2005 assessment was one of two spring nettings to capture a northern pike which exceeding 36 inches in length with the 1995 assessment being the other one.  One 37-inch pike was sampled by gillnet in the 2003 summer survey.  The males outnumbered the females almost 2 to 1 in the lake survey trapnets.   Ages 2 thru 8 were represented in the 2007 lake survey trapnets with the 2004 year class accounting for 55% of the catch. <br> \n     The large-frame trapnets in the 2007 assessment were more successful at capturing walleye than northern pike but that was likely more related to location of the nets.  The large nets netted 263 northern pike ranging from 12 to 34 inches in length with a mean length of 20.4 inches.   Pike exceeding 24 inches accounted for 6% (n=15) of the catch with 0.7% (n=2) more than 30 inches in length.  The large nets had the biggest proportion of pike between 18 and 21 inches of the three netting methods (59%; n=155).  Large-frame trapnets were also used in the 2003 and 2001 spring assessments, sampling 61 pike and 381 pike, respectively.  The 2001 assessment had the largest proportion of pike exceeding 24 inches, 20% (n=75) compared to 18% (n=11) in 2003.  The opposite was true for fish exceeding 30 inches, 7% (n=4) in 2003 compared to 2% (n=7) in 2001.  An equal number of male and female pike were caught in the large frame nets.  Few of the northern pike from the large frame nets were aged due to the large samples from the other two gear types. <br> \n       Ages 2 thru 8 were represented in the female portion of the 2007 spring assessment northern pike catch and ages 1 thru 6 and 8 in the male portion in the combined ageing for all gear types.  The female pike displayed normal growth up to age 7 and fast growth thereafter.  The male pike exhibited fast growth for the first year, normal growth from age 2 to 6, and slow growth at age 8.  Between ages 2 and 4 the female pike grew an average of 2.5 inches longer than males of the same age.  After age 5 the females grew from 4 to 9 longer than the males of the same age.  When comparing growth rates between Big Birch Lake and Big Swan Lake the younger pike grew faster in Big Birch.  The female northern pike in Big Birch Lake grew up to 3.7 inches longer than the females in Big Swan at age 3.  By age 6 the females in Big Birch were still 2.3 inches longer than those in Big Swan but by age 8 the females in Big Swan were 2.3 inches longer than those in Big Birch.  The male pike in Big Birch were up to 2.7 inches longer than the males in Big Swan at age 1 and 2.  At age 4 thru 6 they displayed comparable growth, but at age 8 the males in Big Swan were up to 3.7 inches longer than those in Big Birch. <br> \n     The standard lake survey trapnets in the 2007 assessment caught only 57 walleye compared to 205 in the large-frame trapnets.  The largest walleye, however, was captured in the smaller nets, 30.3 inches compared to 28.7 in the large nets.  Mean length was similiar in both samples, 20.4 inches in the small nets and 20.2 inches in the large.  The biggest difference in the two net catches, other than the sample size, was the proportion of walleye over 20 inches in length, 40% (n=23) in the small nets compared to 50% (n=102) in the large nets.   Only 5 walleye were caught in the 2005 spring assessment which used small nets in the lake.  The 2003 spring assessment was conducted with large-frame trapnets and netted only 17 walleye.  Large-frame trapnets in 2001 sampled 144 walleye which was the second biggest catch in the spring assessments. The male walleye outnumbered the female walleye almost 3 to 1 in the 2007 assessment large frame trapnets and 1.4 to 1 in the lake survey trapnets.   Ages 4 thru 12+ were represented in the 2007 ice-out assessment female portion and ages 3 thru 12+ in the male portion of the walleye catch.  The two strongest year classes in the female sample were from 2001 (26%) and 1996 (20%) while the male sample had 5 year classes that were well represented.  The presence of several of the year classes suggests that natural reproduction may also be contributing to the  population but most appear to be from stocking. <br> \n     Two other gamefish species that were measured were largemouth bass and smallmouth bass.  The trapnets in the lake captured 68 largemouth bass between 6 and 18 inches and the 17 smallmouth bass that were caught were from 14 to 19 inches in length.  The PSD for the largemouth bass sample was 83 while it was 100 for the smallmouth bass catch.   <br> \n     An additional benefit of the 2007 northern pike assessment was the large sample sizes of black crappies and bluegills from the trapnets set in the lake.  A total of 282 crappies and 782 bluegills were captured in the trapnets along with the northern pike and walleye.  The crappies ranged in size from 5 to 15 inches with a mean length of 10.5 inches.  Modal length for the samples was an impressive 12 - 13 inches.  Crappies exceeding 9 inches accounted for 73% (n=206) of the catch and 36% (n=103) were over 12 inches in length.  The 2007 summer survey only sampled 18 crappies in the gillnets which measured from 5 to 13 inches in length.  Mean length for the sample was 9.7 inches with a modal length of 10 - 10.5 inches.  Crappies exceeding 9 inches accounted for 66% (n=12) of the catch with 3 of the fish (17%) more than 12 inches in length.  Ages 2 thur 6, 8, and 9 were represented in the 2007 northern pike assessment with all of the age groups displaying fast growth.  Two strong year classes from 2002 and 2004 accounted for 41% and 48% of the aged sample. <br> \n     The bluegills were between 3 and 10 inches with a mean length of 6.1 inches.  Modal length was smaller than expected for the time of year at 5.5 - 6 inches and only 21% (n=168) of the fish exceeded 7 inches in length.  The 2007 gillnets sampled 85 bluegills from 4 to 9 inches in length.  Mean length for the sample was 6 inches with a modal length of 4 - 4.5 inches.  Bluegills exceeding 7 inches comprised 24% (n=20) of the catch.  Ages 4 thru 10 were represented in the 2007 northern pike assessment with the 2001 year class accounting for 54% of the aged sample.  Ages 4 thru 7 displayed normal growth and the older fish fast growth. <br> \n    Other fish species that were caught included black bullheads, bowfin, brown bullheads, common carp, golden shiners, green sunfish, hybrid sunfish, pumpkinseeds, rock bass, white sucker, yellow bullheads, and yellow perch.  The catch rates for both bowfin and white suckers in the 2007 summer survey were below their respective 25% quartile suggesting low abundance.  The catches in the spring assessment, however, suggest that the lake supports healthy populations of both species.  A total of 627 bowfin and 527 white sucker were caught in the lake set trapnets although some were likely to have been recaptured several times. <br> \n     An area mean back-calculated length table was used to compare growth rates.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>   Fall night electrofishing was conducted on Big Birch Lake to evaluate the survival of the 1.9 million walleye fry stocked in May.  Five electrofishing runs were made around the south basin of the lake for a total of 1.3 hours of on-time.  Ninety-four (94) young-of-year walleye were netted for a catch rate of 73/hour along with 6 other walleye Age I and older.  The use of a new electrofishing boat may have aided in the 2008 higher fingerling catch.  The fingerlings measured from 4.4 to 6.6 inches in length.  Walleye fry are stocked in even numbered and fingerlings stocked in odd numbered years.  This will allow comparison of the effectiveness of the two methods.  Fry stocking appeared to work some years as fall electrofishing produced satisfactory catch rates.   <br> \n    The previous high walleye fingerling catch had been 70/hour in 1998, which was comparable to the 2008 catch.  The 1998 year class later showed up in assessments as strong year class.  Other catch rates have ranged from 39/hour in 1996 to 5.5/hour in 2001.  Catch rates in the last four walleye fingerling assessments have averaged about 6.1 walleye fingerlings per hour.  New catch rates will be produced from netting results with the new boat. <br> \n    The other six walleye netted in the 2008 electrofishing catch ranged from 8 to 17 inches in length.  Most of the older walleye as well as the majority of young-of-year walleye were captured in Run #2, which was along the more barren sand on the north shore of the main basin.  Those six walleye were from 1 to 4 years of age.  Growth appeared slow to normal when compared to an Area Mean Back-calculated Length Table. <br> \n     Vegetation density and substrate appears to have an influence on walleye fingerling location.  Electrofishing observations in 2006 found that more fingerlings were present on sandy substrate with little or no vegetation.  Observations in the 2008 electrofishing effort found the same results.</p>",

Previous management strategies included every other year fingerling stocking, stocking fry one year and fingerlings the next, and biennial fry stocking.  Fall nighttime electrofishing has been the method used to evaluate survival of juvenile Walleye.  Five electrofishing stations were conducted in the north and south basins of the lake for just over one hour of on-time. <br> \n      Thirty-three young of the year Walleye were netted in the 2015 fall night electrofishing assessment.  The 33/hour catch rate was fewer than the 2014 catch of 46/hour but twice the catch rates from 2013 and 2012 electrofishing of 16/hour.  A newer, more efficient electrofishing boat was acquired in 2007.  The new boat along with using two netters has generally increased the catch rates of most species.  The highest young of year Walleye catch since 2008 was 74/hour in 2011, followed by 73/hour in 2008.  Prior to 2007 and back to 1994 catch rates ranged from zero to 69 young of year Walleye/ hour with most of the catches being less than 39/hour. <br> \n       An additional three Walleye between 10.4 and 14.1 inches were netted during the 2015 fall electrofishing effort.  Catch rates of young of year Walleye in fall electrofishing have corresponded to year class strengths observed in subsequent gill net surveys.  However, some observations have been complicated by contingency fingerling stocking.

                "narrative": "<p>This standard survey report summarizes data collected from 15 gill nets that were deployed the week of August 9, 2021. This report is an update from the standard survey report completed in 2018 (LakeFinder, Standard Survey 2018-08-06). Catch comparisons can be made to previous standard surveys dating back to 1981. All nets are replicated from the previous survey during the same time of year so that valid comparisons can be made. Species targeted include Walleye, Northern Pike and Yellow Perch. Smallmouth Bass can also be effectively caught with gill nets on Big Birch but to a lesser extent.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye is the primary management species, and management objectives are generally accomplished through stocking fry and fingerlings. Evaluations of stocking success are completed by electrofishing (targeting young-of-year Walleyes in the fall of the year when spring-stocking of fry occurred) and by gill netting when adult fish are targeted 2-4 years after fry or fingerlings were stocked. The number and size of juvenile Walleye sampled by electrofishing can often predict the strength of that year class 2-4 years later. At this time, the 2018 year class appears to be fairly strong. These fish were about 13 inches long in 2021 and should be approaching 15 inches by the fall of 2022. Since 2014, the number of Walleyes seen in surveys has trended upward so it's reasonable to expect fishing to improve. As anglers are aware however, the fish can be there but may not always be willing to bite.  <br> \n <br> \nA slight decrease in Northern Pike numbers may be evident. Lower density pike populations can be beneficial to other species in the community. DNR's management objective is for a low density population comprised of good numbers of fish over 26 inches. Generally, we see pike in our gill nets ranging from 15-30 inches in Big Birch, with higher numbers of smaller fish than large. There is a history of targeted pike sampling which is completed right after spring ice-out using trap nets along the shoreline. This type of targeted survey was completed in March and April of 2021. Noteworthy observations include a reduction in pike measuring over 30 inches from earlier targeted surveys. This was expected following the elimination of protective regulations in 2015. Other results noted was the sample proportion of pike in the 22-26 inch range which corresponds to the statewide north-central zone pike regulation implemented in 2018.  Over 32% of pike in the 2021 ice-out nets were within the 22-26 inch protected slot, the highest percentage observed since 1994.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch, a primary prey species for pike and Walleye, have been quite variable in their abundance for the past 20 years in Big Birch. In 2010, we sampled above average numbers of perch, but in 2007 and 2018, we didn't sample a single one. Other years our catches were below average compared to other lakes similar to Big Birch. The perch population appears less robust than we'd like to see and may be comprised of mostly smaller fish that are not vulnerable to our gill nets. Larger perch (4-7 inches) are not present in consistent numbers helpful in maintaining healthy Northern Pike and Walleye populations.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Big Birch Lake is a 2,107-acre lake located near Grey Eagle, Minnesota. The lake has 15.25 miles of shoreline, a maximum depth of 81 feet, and a littoral area of 642 acres. Primary management species on Big Birch Lake are Walleye and Northern Pike while secondary species include Bluegill, Largemouth Bass, and Smallmouth Bass.  Night electrofishing in fall has been used to evaluate the success of natural reproduction or spring Walleye fry stocking. No spring fry stocking occurred in 2022 so this assessment was an attempt to document natural reproduction. <br> \n <br> \nFall night electrofishing has been completed on an annual or biennial basis since 1994 on Big Birch Lake to evaluate young of year Walleye abundance.  Fry stocking commenced in 1996 on a biennial basis through 2000.  Fry were stocked during odd numbered years from 2001 to 2005 in conjunction with contingency fingerling stocking.  Even year fry stocking took place from 2006 to 2010 and fry have been stocked on an annual basis since that time.  A stocking rate of roughly 3,000 fry per littoral acre was employed until 2016 when the use of a lower rate (1,500 per littoral acre) was incorporated in alternating years with the original higher rate to evaluate if a lower density stocking rate would meet management goals.  Initial results suggested the higher stocking rate produced higher fall catch rates. <br> \n <br> \nPrior fall young of the year Walleye assessments were conducted utilizing one hour of on-time.  On-time was increased to two hours beginning in 2020 as Big Birch Lake is included in a research study to assess the impacts of zebra mussels on Walleye recruitment.   In 2022 fall young of the year Walleye electrofishing efforts were performed to evaluate natural reproduction. Only one young of the year Walleye (7.5 inches in length) was captured in one hour of sampling effort. Mean lengths of juvenile Walleye sampled in previous fall assessments ranged from 5.5 to 7.3 inches and averaged 6.3 inches.  Fall electrofishing catch rates typically correlate fairly well with Walleye year class strength.  Typically, fall catch rates above 35 young of the year Walleye per hour indicate good future year classes (greater than 2.0/gillnet in standard surveys) whereas lower catch rates predict poorer year classes. <br> \n <br> \nDue to low fall juvenile Walleye electrofishing catches since 2016, the stocking strategy has been changed on Big Birch Lake. Walleye fry will continue to be stocked in odd numbered years. In even years, 642 pounds of Walleye fingerlings will be stocked by DNR and an option will be given to the lake group to purchase an additional 642 pounds from a private producer. It is hoped that this strategy will help maintain the Walleye population at a level consistent with management goals. It is important to note that a recent infestation of Zebra Mussels may impact future Walleye populations by impacting productivity in the lake. Big Birch Lake has been included in important ongoing research to determine potential impacts of Zebra Mussels on Walleye populations. <br> \n</p>",

MEAN WEIGHT HAS ALSO DECLINED FROM 2.48 POUNDS TO 2.03 POUNDS.  AGE CLASSES I THROUGH V WERE PRESENT IN THE CATCH.  AGES I AND II DISPLAYED FAST GROWTH WHILE AGES III-IV SHOWED NORMAL GROWTH.  AGE I AND II FISH COMPRISED 81% OF THE NET CATCH.  THE DECREASE IN NOP ABUNDANCE IS A DESIRED RESPONSE.  BARRIERS HAVE BEEN ERECTED ON INLETS AS DEEMED NECESSARY TO LIMIT NOP RECRUITMENT.  HIGH NOP LEVELS HAVE BEEN FOUND IN THE PAST WITH LIKELY ADVERSE IMPACTS ON YEP, WAE, AND LMB POPULATIONS.  A EVIDENT IN THE WAE GILLNET CATCH AS THE NUMBERS FELL FROM 19.47/SET IN 1986 TO 8.80/SET IN 1991. MEAN WEIGHT OF WAE DID INCREASE HOWEVER, FROM 1.15 POUNDS TO 1.51 POUNDS.  ALL AGE GROUPS I THROUGH VIII+ WERE REPRESENTED AND EXHIBITED NORMAL GROWTH RATES.  ANNUAL STOCKING OF FINGERLING WAES MAINTAINS THE POPULATION AND ACCOUNTS FOR THE CONSISTENT YEAR CLASSES PRESENT.  YEP NUMBERS DID NOT SHOW A CATCHES.  AGE GROUPS II THROUGH V WERE SAMPLED AND DISPLAYED NORMAL GROWTH.  AGE GROUP III MADE UP 76% OF THE NET CATCH.  THE MEAN WEIGHT OF BLG WAS LOW (0.10 POUNDS) AND HAS REMAINED LOW SINCE 1967. ONLY 3.5% OF THE BLGS CAPTURED WERE 7 INCHES OR LONGER.  GROWTH RATES FOR BLG WERE SLOW FOR AGE CLASSES II AND III AND NORMAL FOR OLDER CLASSES. THE BLC TRAPNET CATCH FELL FROM 3.90/SET IN 1986 TO 0.40/SET IN 1991, HOWEVER, SPRING ELECTRO- FISHING DURING SPAWNING INDICATED A LARGE NUMBER OF SPAWNING FISH IN THE 8 TO 10 INCH RANGE.  THE GILLNET CATCH FOR BLC DOUBLED SINCE 1986.  GROWTH RATES WERE FAST FOR AGE GROUPS III AND IV AND NORMAL FOR OTHER AGE GROUPS.  LMB WERE ASSESSED VIA ELECTROFISHING IN CONJUNCTION WITH LAKE SURVEY NETTING.  NIGHT ELECTROFISHING ACCOUNTED FOR 107 OF THE 149 LMB SAMPLED, LMB WERE CAPTURED ELECTRO- FISHING AT A RATE OF 25.2 PER HOUR AND HAD A PSD OF 19.  AGE GROUPS I THROUGH VIII WERE REPRESENTED AND ALL DEMONSTRATED NORMAL GROWTH.  AGE III FISH COMPRISED 58% OF THE TOTAL CATCH.  SMB WERE ALSO OBSERVED DURING ELECTROFISHING, HOWEVER, ONLY ONE FISH WAS CAPTURED.  GILLNETS CAPTURED 13 FISH, 12 OF WHICH WERE II AND III YEAR OLDS.  GROWTH RATES AND NET CATCHES WERE NORMAL FOR THIS SPECIES. THE TLC POPULATION REMAINS STABLE IN NUMBER.  AGE GROUPS I, II, AND V DISPLAYED FAST GROWTH WHILE NORMAL GROWTH WAS FOUND IN AGE GROUPS VI AND VII. THE CAP NET CATCHES REMAINED LOW AND STABLE.  THE FISH BARRIER BETWEEN BIG BIRCH AND LITTLE LAKES IMPEDED THE MOVEMENT OF CAP BETWEEN THE LAKES. LITTLE BIRCH, FULLER, AND HENNESSY LAKES E EXPERIENCED POPULATION BOOMS OF SMALL CAP LIKELY FROM THE SAUK RIVER.  SINCE 1986 27,700 POUNDS OF BLHS AND 700 POUNDS OF BOF (DOGFISH) HAVE BEEN REMOVED BY COMMERCIAL FISHERMEN UNDER CLASS PERMIT.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>      An ice-out assessment was conducted on Big Birch Lake in 2013 to evaluate the Northern Pike population.   A Northern Pike experimental regulation requiring the release of all pike over 24 inches was implemented in 1996.  The regulation was later modified in 2006 to a protected slot between 24 and 36 inches with one fish over 36 inches allowed in possession.  The regulation is up for review in March of 2015 and a decision will be made to either drop the regulation or make it permanent. <br> \n     The ice-out assessment included setting early nets in Fish Creek and near the inlet from a small marsh on the south side of Big Birch Lake to intercept spawning pike.  Attempts were made to set additional trap nets in the lake when access to open areas was possible.   Late ice melt and shifting ice in the lake allowed only ten trap nets to be set in a one week period.   The late, cooler spring and low stream flows likely had a negative effect on pike catches in both stream and lake trap nets. <br> \n      All Northern Pike, Walleye, Largemouth Bass, Black Crappie, and most of the Bluegill were measured.  Other fish species were identified and counted.  Scales were taken from male and female Northern Pike to compare age classes and growth rates between the sexes.   A partial fin-clip was given to the left anal fin to keep track of recaptures.  Recaptured fish were noted but not re-measured.   Seven females and sixteen males were recaptured in the stream sets.   All pike in the lake nets were new fish although one was a fish marked from a previous ice-out assessment.  <br> \n     A total of 458 Northern Pike were netted with the two gear types in the 2013 ice-out assessment.  Ice-out assessments were also conducted in 2010, odd years between 2001 and 2009, and five years between 1993 and 1998.  Not all of the ice-out assessments were conducted with the same gear types.  A table included at the end of the report shows the results from all ice-out assessments.  After the 2010 ice-out assessment, there appeared to be an improvement in the proportion of fish exceeding thirty inches in length, however, the percentage declined in 2013 and resembled results from the 2009 assessment. <br> \n     Ages 2 through 10 were represented in the female portion of the 2013 ice-out assessment and ages 1 through 8 in the male portion.   The abundant year classes suggest consistent recruitment.  A strong year class from 2009 accounted for 31% of the combined catch.  Prior to implementation of the regulation few Northern Pike were documented beyond 6 years of age.   Age 1 males displayed fast growth while the remaining age groups of both sexes showed normal growth when compared to an Area Mean Back-calculated Length table.  Females grew from 2.6 to 5.8 inches longer than males of the same age.   <br> \n      The small sample sizes for Northern Pike gathered in ice-out assessments prior to the regulation implementation (1996) may not have provided a reliably accurate representation of past pike populations.  Extensive ice-out netting completed since 1998 has not shown a trend of steadily increasing mean length, mean weight, % of fish over 24 inches, or % of females over 30 inches.  There does appear to be more Northern Pike exceeding thirty inches than were present before the regulation.   <br> \n     Lake trap nets in previous assessments typically were more effective than the stream nets at catching a sample size with a longer mean length and heavier mean weight.  With the late ice-out in 2013, the majority of pike likely spawned under the ice and did not frequent the shoal waters during the netting period.  In the 2013 assessment, more and larger female pike were netted in the stream nets.  Seventy-five of the pike from the stream sample were females greater than 24 inches in length compared to only six females in the lake nets.  In the 2010 pike assessment when comparing the same type of nets, seventy-two females exceeding twenty-four inches were caught in the lake trap nets while forty-one females were in the stream nets. <br> \n     Some of the previous ice-out assessments have also been used to provide data on the Walleye population in Big Birch Lake.  The lake nets were usually moved to rocky substrates or open sand favored by spawning Walleye later in the assessments and large-frame trap nets were also incorporated.  The ice-out assessments in 2010 and 2007 targeted both Northern Pike and Walleye and used standard lake survey trap nets as well as large-frame trap nets.    Catches of 219 and 262 Walleye were recorded in 2010 and 2007, respectively.  Fewer Walleye (n=32) were sampled in the 2013 assessment as Northern Pike was the target species.   <br> \n     Smaller Walleye comprised a greater proportion of the 2013 sample than in previous assessments.  The largest Walleye in 2013 was only 23.2 inches compared to maximum lengths of 27.5 to 30.3 inches in prior assessments.   This was likely due to the late ice-out and the majority of the female Walleyes having finished spawning. <br> \n     Other fish species sampled in the 2013 ice-out assessment included eight Largemouth Bass between 10.2 and 17.8 inches in length as well as fifty Black Crappie from 5.8 to 13 inches in length.  Twenty-eight Bluegill up to 8.7 inches were sampled in the lake trap nets.   Bowfin, Brown Bullhead, Green Sunfish, hybrid sunfish, Pumpkinseed, Rock Bass, and Yellow Perch were also sampled.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>      An ice-out assessment was conducted on Big Birch Lake in 2014 to evaluate the Northern Pike population.   A Northern Pike experimental regulation requiring the release of all pike over 24 inches was implemented in 1996.  The regulation was later modified in 2006 to a protected slot between 24 and 36 inches with one fish over 36 inches allowed in possession.  The regulation was up for review in March of 2015 and a decision was made to drop the regulation.  Public meetings held in September of 2014 to gage feelings about the regulation showed mostly opposition.   <br> \n      Netting pike proved to be a challenge again on Big Birch Lake with low stream flows, cooler weather, high winds, and delayed ice-out.   The majority of Northern Pike caught came from Fish Creek (58%; n=260) as that was the first location to open up.  This net was set and pulled several times to spread out the catch which was a strategy not used in previous assessments.  The Fish Creek location has typically provided a high pike catch which has been dominated by smaller fish.   An additional inlet on the south shore has traditionally been sampled prior to ice-out with a trap net with two leads set at the mouth.  This set has tended to capture more large pike.    <br> \n       The 2014 ice-out assessment included setting early nets in Fish Creek, near the inlet from a small marsh on the south side of Big Birch Lake, and the inlet from Bass Lake on the north shore to intercept spawning pike.   Attempts were made to set additional trap nets in the lake when access to open areas was possible.   Changing temperatures and strong winds dictated lake net set dates and locations.  There was a 20 day difference between when the first net was set at Fish Creek and the first net set in the lake.  By the time the lake nets were set, most of the female pike were ripe or spent indicating the primary spawning period was complete which is typical with late ice-out.  Only 42 of the pike caught came from the lake sets.  <br> \n      All Northern Pike, Walleye, Largemouth Bass, Black Crappie, and most of the Bluegill were measured.  Other fish species were identified and counted.  Scales were taken from Walleye to compare age classes and growth rates between the sexes.   Northern Pike scales were not taken as a sufficient number could be collected from the summer gill nets.   A partial fin clip was given to the pike to keep track of recaptures.  Recaptured fish were noted but not re-measured.  Two female and four male pike were recaptured during the netting period.   Several marked pike from a previous ice-out assessment were also caught in one of the lake nets.  <br> \n      A total of 451 Northern Pike were netted in the 2014 ice-out assessment.  Ice-out assessments were also conducted in 2013, 2010, odd years between 2001 and 2009, and five years between 1993 and 1998.  Not all of the ice-out assessments were conducted with the same gear types.  A table included at the end of the report shows the results from all ice-out assessments.  After the 2010 ice-out assessment, there appeared to be an improvement in the proportion of fish exceeding 30 inches in length, however, the percentage declined in 2013 and resembled results from the 2009 assessment.  The recent results were comparable to those from 2013.  <br> \n       The small sample sizes for Northern Pike caught in ice-out assessments prior to the regulation implementation (1996) may not have provided a reliably accurate representation of past pike populations.  Extensive ice-out netting completed since 1998 has not shown a trend of steadily increasing mean length, mean weight, % of fish over 24 inches, or % of females over 30 inches.  Through statistical analysis (Dave Staples, May, 2014) there does, however, appear to be more Northern Pike exceeding 30 inches than were present before the regulation.   <br> \n       Lake trap nets in previous assessments typically were more effective than the stream nets at catching a sample size with a longer mean length and heavier mean weight.  With the late ice-out conditions in both 2014 and 2013, the majority of pike likely spawned under the ice and did not frequent the shoal waters during the netting period.  In both assessments, more and larger female pike were netted in the stream nets.  Forty of the pike from Fish Creek and forty from the two early inlet sets were females which exceeded 24 inches in length.  The longest pike was 35.8 inches which came from the early inlet set on the south shore. Only 10 of the pike caught in lake trap nets were longer than 24 inches.   In 2013, 75 pike from the stream sample were females greater than 24 inches in length compared to only six females in the lake nets.   In the 2010 pike assessment when comparing the same gear types, 72 females exceeding 24 inches were caught in the lake trap nets compared to 41 females in stream nets.  (See Table 1:  Northern Pike \u0013 Big Birch Lake) <br> \n       Some of the previous ice-out assessments were also used to provide data on the Walleye population in Big Birch Lake.  The lake nets were usually moved to rocky substrates or open sand favored by spawning Walleye later in the assessments and large-frame trap nets were also incorporated.  Walleye were not a target species in 2014, although length measurements and scales were taken to supplement age data from the 2014 summer survey.   A total of 30 Walleye were caught that measured from 17.9 to 27.9 inches in length.  Fewer Walleye (n=32) were also sampled in the 2013 assessment as Northern Pike was the target species.  Catches of 219 and 262 walleye were recorded in 2010 and 2007, respectively.   <br> \n      Ages six, nine, and twelve were represented in the female Walleye sample and five through eight, and fifteen in the male portion.   Most of the fish in both samples, 85% of females, and 65% of males, came from the 2008 year class which corresponds to a fry stocked year.  Female Walleye showed normal to fast growth while males showed normal to slow growth rates when compared to an Area Mean Back-calculated Length table. <br> \n       Other fish species sampled in the 2014 ice-out assessment included six Largemouth Bass between 6.0 and 15.6 inches in length as well as twelve Black Crappie from 5.9 to 11.5 inches in length.  Eighteen  Bluegill up to 7.8 inches were sampled in the lake trap nets.   Bowfin, Brown Bullhead, hybrid sunfish, Pumpkinseed, Rock Bass, and White Sucker were also caught. <br> \n       Recent ice-out assessments have suggested that there has been an improvement in the number of Northern Pike exceeding 30 inches, but catch results have not met the management goals of the experimental regulation.  Following public meetings and comment period, there was little support for the regulation and the recommendation was to drop the regulation in the 2015 fishing season.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Big Birch Lake is a 2,107-acre lake located near Grey Eagle, Minnesota. The lake has 15.25 miles of shoreline, a maximum depth of 81 feet, and a littoral area of 642 acres. It has been primarily managed for Walleye and Northern Pike and secondarily for Bluegill, Largemouth Bass, and Smallmouth Bass.  Night electrofishing in fall has been used to evaluate the success of natural reproduction or spring Walleye fry stocking.  <br> \n <br> \nFall night electrofishing has been completed on an annual or biennial basis since 1994 on Big Birch Lake to evaluate young of year Walleye (YWAE) abundance.  Fry stocking commenced in 1996 on a biennial basis through 2000.  Fry were stocked during odd numbered years from 2001 to 2005 in conjunction with contingency fingerling stocking.  Even year fry stocking took place from 2006 to 2010 and fry have been stocked on an annual basis since that time.  A stocking rate of roughly 3,000 fry per littoral acre was employed until 2016 when the use of a lower rate (1,500 per littoral acre) was incorporated in alternating years with the original higher rate. <br> \n <br> \nPrior fall YWAE assessments were conducted utilizing one hour of on-time.  On-time was increased to two hours in this assessment as Big Birch Lake will be included in a research study to assess the impacts of zebra mussels on Walleye recruitment.   In 2020 fall YWAE electrofishing efforts were performed to evaluate success of natural reproduction as no stocking occurred due to state shutdown of DNR Fisheries egg-taking and hatchery operations due to the Covid-19 pandemic.  A total of 23 Walleye were captured during the assessment, none of which were determined to be YWAE.   <br> \n   <br> \nDue to the lower than desired rate of return from fry stocking since 2016 an unplanned stocking of 17,304 fingerlings took place in the fall of 2019.  Statewide availability of Walleye fingerlings was good in 2019 allowing for this additional stocking to occur.  The lake was stocked with a total of 618 lbs. (1 lb. /littoral area) of Walleye fingerlings that averaged 28 fish per pound.  In addition, a private producer bolstered this year class with 13,986 additional yearling Walleyes (518 pounds) in the spring of 2020.  Recent discussions with the lake group initiated a new Walleye stocking strategy.  Fingerlings will be stocked by the state at a rate of 1 lb./littoral acre in even years.  The lake group will also be allowed the option to stock an additional 1 lb./littoral acre of privately purchased fingerlings in even years.  Walleye fry will be stocked by the state in odd years and success will continue to be monitored with fall electrofishing. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",
