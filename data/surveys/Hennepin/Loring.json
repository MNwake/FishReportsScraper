The entire shoreline, which provides some shore angling opportunities and a fishing pier, is encompassed within a city park.  The pond has been managed in the Fishing In the Neighborhood program since 2001 and has been stocked annually with black crappies and bluegills.  The abundance of black crappies was above average for this type of lake.  Black crappies captured averaged 8.2 inches in length with some fish over 11 inches.  Also of interest to anglers are bluegills with half of the fish sampled at least seven inches in length.  The black bullhead abundance is above average and will keep anglers busy, as they are easy to catch.</p>",

The entire shoreline, which provides some shore angling opportunities and a fishing pier, is encompassed within Loring Park.  The pond has been managed in the Fishing in the Neighborhood program since 2001 and has been stocked annually with black crappies, bluegills and channel catfish in 2005 and 2006.   <br> \n <br> \nThe abundance of bluegills was above average for this type of lake.  Bluegills captured averaged 4.3 inches in length with a few fish over 6.5 inches.  Also of interest to anglers are black crappies, with some reaching over 13 inches in length.  The black bullhead abundance was above average and will keep anglers busy, as they are easy to catch. <br> \n <br> \nTo find out more about Loring Park, visit: www.minneapolisparks.org. <br> \n <br> \nFor more information about the FiN program or to see what FiN has done in your neighborhood, please visit us at: www.dnr.state.mn.us/fishing/fin. <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Loring Lake is a 7.6-acre pond located in Minneapolis, Minnesota. The entire shoreline, which provides some shore angling opportunities and a fishing pier, is encompassed within Loring Park. The pond has been managed in the Fishing in the Neighborhood (FiN) program since 2001. The pond has a summer aeration system that provides oxygen and is turned off in the fall.  A Standard Lake Survey was conducted on 8/1/2016, the first since 8/27/07.  Loring Lake has a maximum depth of 16 feet and water clarity was 3 feet at the time of the survey. Dissolved oxygen ranged from 3.5 parts per million (ppm) at the surface to 0.94 ppm at a depth of 14 feet.  Loring Lake has been classified as a Lake Class 40.   <br> \n <br> \nOne gillnet and 4 trap-nets were used in this survey, and 3 species were sampled. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie catch was above average for gillnets and well-above average for trap-nets at 18 and 82.5 fish per lift respectively.  Black Crappie averaged 5.63 inches in length in gillnet and 5.54 inches in length in trap-nets.  The average weight of Black Crappie in Loring Lake was 0.09 pounds. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill abundance was above average at 18.5 fish per lift in trap-nets, but Bluegills were below average in weight at 0.16 pounds per fish.  Bluegill in Loring Lake ranged from 3.94-6.34 inches and with a mean length of 5.62 inches.  One Bluegill was captured by gillnet, and was 4.21 inches in length. <br> \n <br> \nFive Channel Catfish were captured by gillnet in Loring Lake.  Channel Catfish averaged 2.71 pounds per fish and ranged in length from 16.77-22.05 inches.  Average length for Channel Catfish in Loring Lake was 19.75 inches. <br> \n <br> \nNo Black Bullheads were captured in the 2016 survey, most likely the result of a winterkill in 2009 as 1,744 Black Bullheads were sampled in the 2007 lake survey (all gear combined). <br> \n <br> \nLoring Lake is annually stocked with adult Channel Catfish (June 2016, 108 individuals) and biannually with Bluegill (Spring 2014, 35 individuals) and Black Crappie (Spring 2014, 92 individuals).
