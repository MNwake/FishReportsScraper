This population is composed entirely of age groups 5-7, reflecting the 1978, 1979 and 1980 fingerling stockings. Northern Pike are present at 3.3/gill net, an average level when compared to the local average of 5.7/gill net. The majority of Northern Pike were 17-21 inches long. Largemouth Bass abundance (7.7/trap net) is high and 15 times greater than in 1974, with growth near average. Bluegill (15.3/trap net) have decreased by a factor of 5 since 1974, but continue to show slow growth. Black Crappie (0.3/trap net) remain far below the local average. Walleye, Northern Pike, and Black Crappie all have good growth rates. Black and Brown Bullheads averaged 1.6 and 1.3 pounds, respectively, with Yellow Bullheads averaging 0.9 pounds.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Eagle Lake is a small (244 acre) lake located four miles northeast of the City of Maple Lake in Wright County.  There is a county-owned access with limited roadside parking located on the northeast end of the lake.  Although the watershed is not large, water clarity is low in summer months.  Curled pondweed grows very densely in spring, and the die-off in early summer can lead to nuisance algal blooms.  In August of 2004, a lake survey was conducted to assess the fish community of Eagle Lake.The catch rate of walleye in 2004 (5.2/gill net) was similar to 1996 (6.7/net), and was considered high compared to lakes similar to Eagle.  The average size of walleye was 3.4 pounds.  Most walleye ranged in length from 18 to 23 inches, and the largest was 27.4 inches.  Walleye is the only species stocked in Eagle Lake, and has been stocked four out of the last ten years.  The largest age classes seen in the survey were from the 2000 and 1996 stockings. The 2004 northern pike catch rate was similar to the 1996 survey, and was typical of lakes similar to Eagle.  The average size of northern pike was 2.9 pounds.  The majority of the northern pike were between 18 and 28 inches in length and averaged 23.2 inches; the largest was 31.5 inches.The catch rate of largemouth bass in Eagle Lake was approximately fifty percent higher than the median rate for lakes in the Montrose management area.  Of the catchable size bass (greater than 8 inches), 58 percent were greater than 12 inches, and 18 percent were greater than 15 inches.  The largest bass sampled in 2004 was 18.8 inches.  No black crappie were sampled in trap nets in 2004, but a few were caught in gill nets.  During summer, crappie are less likely to use areas near shore, and aren't as likely to be sampled.  The trap net catch of bluegill in Eagle Lake was similar to the previous survey, and was near the average for lake like Eagle.  The growth of bluegill in Eagle Lake is considered slow by statewide averages.  The majority of bluegill caught in trap nets ranged in size from 4.5 to 7.0 inches, with a maximum of 7.4 inches.  Yellow perch were small, and low in numbers.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Eagle Lake is a 244 acre lake located four miles northeast of the City of Maple Lake.  The maximum depth of the lake is 38 feet and during mid-July adequate oxygen was present down to 15 feet. Two public accesses are present on Eagle Lake.  The county-owned access is located on the northeast end of the lake off of the township road, while an unimproved access is located on the southwest side.  Eagle Lake is located within 50 miles of the Twin Cities Metropolitan Area, therefore, it receives a moderate amount of fishing pressure for a lake of its size.  Black Crappie, Largemouth Bass, Bluegill, Walleye and Northern Pike are all present in the lake.  In the summer of 1996, a lake survey was conducted on Eagle Lake.  The netting of the lake revealed the following information about the fish population. The Northern Pike catch rate in gill nets (5.5/gill net) did not significantly change from the 1990 survey (6.2/gill net).  This catch rate of Northern Pike was within expected levels for lakes that are similar to Eagle Lake.  The average size Northern Pike caught in gill nets weighed 1.9 pounds and was 19.6 inches long.  The growth rate of Northern Pike was average when compared with lakes similar to Eagle Lake.The gill net catch rate of Walleye in Eagle Lake (6.7/gill net) significantly increased from the last survey (1.8/gill net) and rose above expected levels for this lake type.  Ages 2-4, 6, 8 and 10 were caught, with the majority coming from years when Walleye were stocked.  The average size Walleye caught in gill nets was 2.1 pounds and 17.6 inches. The overall growth rate of Walleye in Eagle Lake was average when compared with similar lakes.The trap net catch of Bluegill in Eagle Lake (25.7/trap net) appeared to decline slightly from the previous netting in 1990 (31.2/trap net) but remained within normal levels for this lake type. Bluegill caught in trap nets ranged in size from 3.2-8.3 inches and averaged 6.0 inches in length. The growth rate of Bluegill was fast for one and two year old fish and average for age three through six fish.The catch rate of Black Crappie in trap nets (5.5/trap net) appeared to increase from the last netting (0.8/trap net) and rose to within expected values for lakes similar to Eagle.  The average size Black Crappie caught in trap nets was 8 inches and weighed 0.3 pounds.  One to five year old fish were sampled and the growth rate of Black Crappie in Eagle Lake was fast when compared with similar lakes. The Largemouth Bass population was sampled by spring electrofishing.  A total of 53 bass were caught at a rate of 26.5 per hour.  This catch rate is above the Montrose Area average for Largemouth Bass (20.0 per hour).  Largemouth Bass lengths ranged from 5.4-17.5 inches and averaged 10.5 inches.  Two to eight year old fish were caught, with three and five year old fish being most common.  The growth rate of Largemouth Bass in Eagle Lake was average. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A survey of near shore fish species was conducted on June 27, 2016 by IBI Program Staff.  Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at all 10 sampling stations, a 50-foot seine was used to sample 8 stations, a 15-foot seine was used at 1 station, and site conditions prevented the use of a seine at 1 site due to abundant vegetation and soft sediments. Nearshore sampling captured 16 species and was dominated by Bluegill, Bluntnose Minnows, and Largemouth Bass.  Species intolerant of poor water quality and/or poor shoreline habitat were sampled in low numbers. <br> \n <br> \nThe near shore fish survey data is combined with gill net and trap net data from an August 2016 survey to describe the fish community and provide a fish-based Index of Biotic Integrity (FIBI) score based on expectations for similar lakes. The FIBI score for Eagle Lake is below an impairment threshold for aquatic life use developed for similar lakes.   <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to a watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.  Eagle Lake is located in the Mississippi River - St. Cloud Watershed.   <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Eagle Lake is a small (244 acre) lake located five miles west of Monticello in Wright County with a maximum depth of 38 feet. The 10 year average water clarity of six feet during the summer.  Eagle Lake has a small watershed (1,621 acres) in which land use consists primarily of 31% forest, 29% agriculture, 14% open water, 12% hay/pasture, 7% residential, 4% grassland, and 3% wetland. There is a state-owned access located on the northeast end of the lake with enough parking available for eight vehicle/trailer combinations as well as a dock and portable toilet. A standard summer survey was conducted in 2016 to monitor changes in the fishery from the last survey completed in 2004. Near shore Index of Biotic Integrity sampling and emergent and floating leaf vegetation mapping were also completed to evaluate the physical habitat of Eagle Lake. <br> \n <br> \nThe catch rate of Walleye in Eagle Lake has fluctuated over the past and catch rates in 2016 were down from the previous survey and below the long term average. The average size of Walleye was 0.9 pounds and most Walleye ranged in length from 9 to 12 inches, but fish between 17 and 19 inches are available. Walleye is the only species stocked by the DNR in Eagle Lake, and fingerlings are stocked on a biennial basis.  The largest age classes present were from the 2014 and 2012 stockings.  <br> \n  <br> \nThe 2016 Northern Pike catch rate was down from the previous survey, and fell below the lakes long term average. The average size of Northern Pike however increased to 4.2 pounds and 25 inches in length. Fifty percent of Northern Pike were greater than 24 inches in length; and the largest was nearly 36 inches.  Anglers are encouraged to harvest the small pike (under 22 inches) and release the larger ones to help achieve a more balanced fish community and to improve growth rates. Lower pike numbers may also increase Walleye stocking success and allow Yellow Perch numbers (which are low) to increase. Higher perch populations are desirable as they are an important prey species for both Walleye and Northern Pike. <br> \n <br> \nThe catch rate of Largemouth Bass in Eagle Lake was approximately twice the average rate for lakes in the Sauk Rapids Management Area although many of the fish sampled were small. Anglers can expect good Largemouth Bass fishing with an opportunity to catch fish over 18 inches. <br> \n <br> \nThe Bluegill trap net catch was similar to the previous survey and near the long term average. The average size of Bluegill (6 inches) has increased and fish up to eight inches were sampled. The average replacement time for an eight inch sunfish in central Minnesota is 5-8 years. Therefore angers are encouraged to limit their harvest of larger Bluegill especially adult males which are more colorful in the spring time when Bluegill are in the process of spawning and are more easily exploited by anglers. The larger male Bluegills are important to maintaining a healthy size structure as they restrict reproduction by smaller males, allowing the smaller males to put more energy into growth and less into reproduction. Anglers can help improve fishing for Bluegill on Eagle Lake by selectively harvesting medium sized females and let the largest males go. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie numbers increased from 2004, but remained relatively low as they have been historically in Eagle Lake. During late summer, crappie are less likely to use areas near shore, and aren't as likely to be sampled. Although relatively few Black Crappie were sampled, 41% were greater than 10 inches in length. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled during the survey included: Black Bullhead, Bowfin, Brown Bullhead, Common Carp, Golden Shiner, Green Sunfish, Hybrid Sunfish, Pumpkinseed Sunfish, and Yellow Bullhead. All of these species were sampled at rates either within or below the range of expected values for the respective lake class. <br> \n <br> \nNear shore IBI sampling was used to survey small minnow species that are sensitive to changes in water quality. During the near-shore sampling the following sensitive species were collected: Iowa Darter, Johnny Darter, Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, and Spottail Shiner. The presence of these species is an indicator that Eagle Lake has relatively good water quality and habitat. Changes in shoreline development have the potential to negatively affect the health of a lake.  It is important that all lake shore owners follow County shoreline rules and only mow a small area down to the lake to allow access and avoid clearing their entire shoreline. Native vegetation helps stabilize shoreline soils and acts as a buffer reducing the amount of pollution that enters a lake from runoff. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Important species caught in gill nets were Northern Pike, Yellow Perch and Walleye.  Northern Pike were caught at a rate of 6.2/gill net.  The size range was 16-33 inches with an average length group of 20 inches.  Growth was good for all ages and age 4 were the most abundant in the catch. Walleye abundance of 1.8/gill net was similar to 1985 (2.2/gill net). Walleye ranged in length from 10-26 inches and the average length group was 12 inches. Growth was good for all ages.  Yellow Perch numbers (1.7/gill net) continue to be low (0.8/gill net, 1985). The average length group was 5.5-5.9 inches. Seining during spring produced 65 Largemouth Bass in four hauls for a catch rate of 23.6 bass/acre seined (2.7 acres seined). Fish ranged from 2-14 inches in length with an average length group of 11.0-11.4 inches.  Several age classes were represented in the sample. \n\nImportant species caught in the trap nets were Bluegill and Yellow Bullhead.  Bluegill were abundant (31.2/trap net) and showed an apparent increase from 1985 (15.3/trap net).  The average length group was 5-5.9 inches (age 5) and growth was slow for all ages. Yellow Bullhead abundance of 14.8/trap net apparently increased from 5.0/trap net in 1985.  This was above the range of expected values for lakes similar to Eagle and the average length was 13 inches.</p>",
