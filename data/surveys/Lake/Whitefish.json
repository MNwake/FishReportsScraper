                "narrative": "<p>Whitefish Lake is a 339 acre body of water located approximately 13 miles northwest of Tofte, MN.  There is a carry-in public access and small (4 site) campground on the north end of the lake, three remote campsites are scattered along the shoreline, all maintained by the U. S. Forest Service (USFS).  Whitefish Lake is one of the entry points to the \"Timber - Frear canoe route\" that is managed by the USFS as a Semi-Primitive Motorized Area, providing a wilderness experience outside of the Boundary Waters Canoe Area (BWCA).  Portage trails from Elbow Lake (65 rods) and South Wigwam Lake (20 rods) also provide access to Whitefish Lake. <br> \n <br> \nWhitefish is a very soft-water lake with a total alkalinity of 16.0 ppm and pH 7.35, based on field measurements taken in 2010.  Dissolved oxygen was 5.1 ppm at 24 feet, dropping to 2.2 ppm at 26 feet in August 2010.  The secchi disk reading was 19.0 feet, in light green water. <br> \n <br> \nThe fish sample in 2010 consisted of northern pike, rock bass, walleye, white sucker and yellow perch.  The walleye numbers were well above average in 2010, for northeastern Minnesota lakes with similar characteristics (lake class).  Previous investigations have also recorded high walleye catches on Whitefish Lake.  The average size of walleye sampled was slightly below average, 1.2 pounds (14.7 inches) for the lake class; the largest walleye was 25.2 inches.  Thirty-one percent of the walleye sampled in 2010 were greater than 15 inches.  Walleye stocking was discontinued in 1986 when natural reproduction checks and assessment netting indicated that walleye reproduction was sufficient to maintain a walleye fishery in Whitefish Lake.  The carry-in access, suitable for small boats and canoes, probably limits the fishing pressure on Whitefish Lake which then allows the slow growing walleye an opportunity to attain quality size and maintain high numbers. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike were sampled in slightly below average numbers for the lake class, but similar to previous catches on Whitefish Lake.  The northern pike average size was 3.8 pounds (23 inches); 28% of the northern pike sample was greater than 29 inches the largest northern pike measuring 35.7 inches.  The average size recorded in the 2010 population assessment was larger than in previous investigations. <br> \n  <br> \nYellow perch were sampled in above average numbers for the lake class in the 2010 population assessment, the numbers of yellow perch have fluctuated widely in previous investigations.  The average weight of yellow perch sampled was about one-quarter pound (8.1 inches); 56% of the yellow perch sampled were greater than 8 inches, the largest 11 inches.   <br> \n</p>",

Natural reproduction is contributing significantly to the population, indicated by the strong year classes of II & III year olds which comprised 52% of the total catch. The Yellow Perch gillnet catch was 2.5 times higher than the previous assessment. This is a significant increase considering the high predator population. The Northern Pike catch was 2.6 times the historical average, however it was comprised of small fish that averaged about 1 pound.</p>",

Walleye were sampled in above average numbers, which is not unusual for this lake.  The average size of walleye collected in this survey was about 1.25 pounds, which is somewhat larger than fish taken in previous surveys.  The largest walleye sampled was 4.9 pounds.Northern pike were sampled in average numbers compared to other lakes in this class.  The fish in the sample were generally small, which is normal for this lake, averaging about 1.7 pounds.  The largest northern pike observed in this survey was only 2.7 pounds.Yellow perch were sampled in above average numbers compared to other lakes in this class.  A few yellow perch between 10 inches and 11.5 inches, and one 12.2 inch individual, were taken but most were too small to interest anglers.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A standard survey was completed in summer 2018 to monitor the status of the fish community. The lake is located within the Timber-Frear Canoe Route area managed by the US Forest Service as a semi-primitive motorized area. There is a carry-in access with a short but rocky trail suitable for canoes and small fishing boats in the northwest corner of the lake. The current fish community is the result of natural reproduction as no fish stocking has occurred since 1985. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye catch was above the normal range for similar lakes in standard sampling gear. High abundance has been recorded in each of the previous nine assessments dating back to 1970. Size in the 2018 standard survey gill nets ranged from 7.8 to 26.3 inches with an average of 15.2 inches and 1.33 pounds. Overall size structure was favorable for anglers as 65% of Walleye sampled were between 14 and 20 inches. Age analysis determined fish ranged from age-3 to age-16 with twelve year classes represented which indicates good natural reproduction with consistent recruitment to maturity. Growth was slow compared to other lakes in the area and fish reach 11.3 inches at age-4.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike catch was similar to the last assessment and within the normal range for this type of lake. Although the total number sampled was small the average size was 22 inches and 2.5 pounds. Historic data suggest Northern Pike rarely reach trophy size but do provide another opportunity to catch a larger predator.  <br> \n <br> \nWhite Sucker and Yellow Perch are important forage species in the lake. White Sucker gill net catch was above the expected range for the fourth consecutive survey. Yellow Perch gill net and trap net catches were similar to the last assessment and within the normal range for this type of lake. Perch size was poor with few fish over 9 inches sampled.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Walleye densities have historically been high but the gillnet catch in 1992 was unusually high. This high population is directly related to very strong year classes of Age II and Age IV fish which comprised 34% and 27% of the sample respectively. The average length of Walleye was 12.9\" which is larger than from any previous assessment. The Northern Pike gillnet catch of 3.3/lift represents a 27% decline from the previous assessment, however this decline is not unusual as fluctuations in Northern Pike densities have been observed for many years. Northern Pike are of small average size which is also normal for this lake. Yellow Perch numbers declined by nearly 50% compared to the previous assessment, however with a gillnet catch of 19.5/lift they are still abundant.</p>",
