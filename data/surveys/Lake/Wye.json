Public access is a 400 foot carry in along a trail that originates off of USFS 369 (Trappers Lake Road) where parking is available for about 3 vehicles. From 1981 to the present Walleye fingerlings have been stocked regularly at various different rates and sizes. Bluegill and Black Crappie fishing opportunities are limited in the Finland Area so adult Bluegill from Cedar Lake near Aurora were stocked into Wye Lake beginning in 2016 in an attempt to start a self-sustaining population. Black Crappie were also sampled from the lake in 2019 although no DNR stocking of the species has occurred. The purpose of this spring trap net survey was to check the status of both species and look for evidence of natural reproduction.   <br> \n <br> \nForty-Two Black Crappie were sampled and ranged in length from 4.6-13.2 inches. Five-year classes were identified with the 2018 year class making up 55% of the catch. Survey results indicate good opportunities for crappie around 10 inches long currently with the potential for good year classes to be produced in the future.  <br> \nSpring trap netting captured eighty Bluegill that ranged from 3-10 inches long. Three-year classes of naturally reproduced fish from 2018-2020 were sampled. The 2020-year class was the most abundant and accounted for 84% of the catch. These fish averaged 3.7 inches long at the time of the survey but their high abundance bodes well for Bluegill angling opportunities in the coming years. The three largest Bluegill sampled were all stocked fish from Cedar Lake suggesting the current population is a mix of stocked fish and naturally reproduced fish. Future surveys will determine if natural reproduction is sufficient to sustain the population into the future.  <br> \n <br> \nBluegill and Black Crappie populations in the Finland Area generally have sporadic reproduction and are supported by occasional strong year classes. For this reason, it is recommended to show a little restraint when the fishing is good. Taking some home for a fresh fish dinner is great. However, going back day after day when the bite is hot can do damage on a 50 acre lake. Future spring trap netting surveys will be used to monitor the Bluegill and Black Crappie population to determine what kind of angling opportunities the lake can support.</p>",

Both species are relatively new to the fish community of Wye Lake with Bluegill stocked by DNR biologists in 2016 and 2017 and Black Crappie presumably migrating from adjacent waterbodies and sampled for the first time in 2019. The purpose of the 2024 targeted survey was to monitor the status of both populations and collect updated information on opportunities they provide to anglers. <br> \n <br> \nSpring trap netting collected a sample of 34 Black Crappie that ranged from 4.4 to 13.8 inches long with 29% of the catch greater than ten inches long. Each year class from 2017 to 2022 was sampled indicating natural reproduction and recruitment has been successful at maintaining the current population.  <br> \n <br> \nTargeted sampling also collected 42 Bluegill that ranged from 3.4 to 10.8 inches long with 31% greater than seven inches long. Age analysis determined eight unique year classes were present indicating successful natural reproduction and recruitment since the initial stocking.  <br> \n <br> \nResults from this survey indicate Black Crappie and Bluegill have established naturalized populations in Wye Lake that provide opportunities for anglers to catch and harvest both species. Biologists will continue to monitor the fish community to evaluate the status of these fisheries into the future. </p>",

There is a 400 foot carry-in trail from USFS Road #369 to the northeast shore, near the outlet.  A user developed trail out to the end of the major point, on the northeast corner of Wye Lake, provides a unique angling option in the Finland area where shore fishing for walleye and northern pike is difficult to find. <br> \n   <br> \nWye Lake is a very soft-water lake with a secchi disk reading of 8.0 feet in the brown, bog stained water.  The shore drops quickly off many of the points with significant aquatic vegetation in the bays. <br> \n  <br> \nIn addition to northern pike, rock bass, walleye, white sucker and yellow perch, other species collected in 2010 were:  burbot, rock bass, blacknose shiner, golden shiner, pumpkinseed, Iowa darter, central mudminnow, slimy sculpin. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye were sampled in below average numbers in gill nets and above average numbers in trap nets, compared to other northeastern Minnesota lakes with similar characteristics.  Wye Lake is one lake in the Finland area where walleye frequent the near shore habitat, resulting in higher catches in trap net sets. The size of walleye sampled was average for this lake class, at 1.2 pounds (14.5 inches); the largest walleye measured 24 inches.  Thirty-two percent of the total walleye catch was greater than 15 inches.  Walleye fingerling, scheduled for every other year stocking, supplements the poor walleye reproduction that is typical for Wye Lake. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike were sampled in below average numbers for the lake class.  The northern pike average size was less than 1 pound (16.4 inches); the largest northern pike was 19.1 inches.  Historically, the northern pike catch has ranged widely; the size has generally been small.  Northern pike growth was slow at all ages sampled, compared to northern pike sampled in other Finland area assessments. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch were sampled in below average numbers for the lake class in the 2010 population assessment.  The average weight of the yellow perch sampled was 0.2 pound (7.4 inches); 21% of the yellow perch sampled were greater than 8 inches, the largest was 10.2 inches.   <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Wye Lake is located 19 miles north-northeast of Finland near the intersection of Lake County Road 7 and USFS Road #369 (Trappers Lake Road) in the Superior National Forest.  Public access is a 100 yard carry in with a small parking lot along the Trappers Lake Road suitable for 2 or 3 vehicles.  The lake is 52 acres with a maximum depth of 13 feet.  A standard survey was completed the week of July 22, 2019 to evaluate current management goals and provide data to base future management decisions.  Walleye are the primary managed species with Bluegill listed as a secondary managed species.  Walleye fingerlings are stocked at a rate of 110 pounds in even numbered years.  About 2,000 Bluegill were stocked in 2016 and 2017 from Cedar Lake near Aurora with the intent of creating a self-sustaining population.  Due to a beaver dam built on the outlet, 2019 had the highest water level ever recorded in eight previous fish surveys dating back to 1982. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye gill net catch of 1.0/net was below average compared to similar lakes.  The average weight and length of 1.3 pounds and 15.8 inches would be considered normal.  Trap net catch of 1.1/net is normal while the average weight of 0.9 pounds would be considered slightly small.  The largest fish sampled was 18.3 inches long and weighed 1.8 pounds.  Five different year classes were sampled with 25% of Walleye coming from non-stocked years.  <br> \n <br> \nNo Bluegill were captured in gill nets and trap net catch was 1.3/net.  The average weight was almost 0.6 pounds.  The largest fish sampled was 9.3 inches long and 75% of the sample was longer than 8 inches.  Most of the fish sampled could be traced back to the 2016 and 2017 stocking events but some evidence of natural reproduction was observed.  Small fish collected in quarter inch mesh trap nets confirm that Bluegill can reproduce in the lake.  Future surveys will be used to determine if natural reproduction is sufficient to sustain a population. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie were sampled for the first time in 2019.  It is unknown whether they migrated to the lake naturally or were released by anglers.  The lake does have a connection with both Silver Island Lake and Harriet Lake which both have established Black Crappie populations.  Two small fish were caught in gill nets.  The trap net catch of 1.2/net is normal for similar lakes.  Average length and weight of 8.5 inches and just less than half pound is in the normal range.  The largest fish sampled was 10.4 inches long and weighed 0.7 pounds.  Three year classes were sampled along with young-of-the-year fish.  Growth was fast by Finland Area standards. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike gill net catch of 2.7/net with average length and weight 18.6 inches and 1.4 pounds are both in the normal range for similar lakes.  The largest fish sampled in all gear types was 23.2 inches long. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch and White Sucker catches were within the expected range for the lake and similar to past surveys.  Other fish sampled were Blacknose Shiner, Golden Shiner and Pumpkinseed. <br> \n <br> \nWye Lake is locally known as a decent Walleye lake with some shore fishing opportunities.  The lake's small size make it more popular on a windy day, especially with campers at nearby Silver Island Lake.  Recently Bluegill have been stocked into the lake and Black Crappie were sampled for the first time in 2019.  In the Finland Area, these fisheries tend to have low density populations with good growth rates and sporadic reproduction that can produce good angling when strong year classes mature.  Anglers are encouraged to show some restraint when the fishing is good especially on this lake where we are attempting to establish a self-sustaining population of Bluegill and the Black Crappie population is young. <br> \n</p>",

Walleye were sampled in average numbers compared to other lakes of this type.  They ranged in size from 6.7 inches to 22.8 inches with an average size of about 1.0 pounds.  The lake is stocked every other year with walleye fingerlings.     Northern pike are present in average numbers but their average size is small.  Test nets in 1999 collected northern pike from 8.8 inches to 23.4 inches but the average size was under 1.0 pounds.     Yellow perch are not abundant and most are to small to be of interest to anglers.</p>",

A scattered to moderate growth of various submerged and emergent aquatic plants is supported by the moderately soft lake water.  Soils of the lake bottom appear to be 40% gravel, 30% sand, 15% muck, 10% rubble and 5% boulder.  During the survey one inlet and the outlet had standing water but no flow.  Another inlet had only minute flow.  Shoreline marshes or lowlands are located on the south, southeast, and north shores.  A secchi disc could be seen in waters up to 5.8' deep.     When comparing numbers of fish caught per net set with net catch averages of the watershed it seems that White Sucker, Northern Pike, and Walleye populations are fair to poor.  Yellow Perch and Rock Bass numbers are indicated to be good.     No information of fishing pressure was obtained, but the pressure is believed to be no more than light.</p>",

Walleye were sampled in average numbers although fewer were taken in this assessment than in some of the other recent assessments.  Walleye averaged about 15 inches and the largest fish collected was 20.8 inches.  Most of the walleye were between 14 and 17.9 inches.Northern pike were collected in somewhat higher numbers than in past assessments with the catch in 2004 being slightly above average.  Northern pike in this lake are typically smaller than average with an average size of 1.2 pound in this assessment.  The largest northern pike taken in this assessment was 24.6 inches (3 pounds).Yellow perch were not abundant and most of the fish were probably too small to interest anglers.  Yellow perch up to 11.3 inches were sampled, but most were smaller than 8 inches.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey using trap nets was completed in spring of 2019 to investigate the status of the Bluegill population in Wye Lake.   About 2,000 Bluegill of various sizes were stocked in 2016 and 2017.  Spring trap netting captured 32 Bluegill that ranged from 6.6 to 9.0 inches long and had an average length of 8.1 inches and weight of 0.5 pounds.  All of the Bluegill sampled were fish that had been stocked in previous years.  In the Finland Area, Bluegill and Crappie fisheries tend to have low density populations with good growth rates and sporadic reproduction that can produce good angling when strong year classes mature.  Anglers are encouraged to show some restraint when the fishing is good especially on this lake where we are attempting to establish a self-sustaining population.  Bringing a few fish home for a meal is great but taking repeated limits can put a serious dent in the number of spawning adults.  Some evidence of natural reproduction was documented during a standard fish survey completed in summer of 2019. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie were sampled for the first time during this survey.  It is unknown whether they migrated into the lake naturally or were released by anglers.  The lake does have a connection with both Silver Island Lake and Harriet Lake which both have established Black Crappie populations.  Thirteen Black Crappie were captured ranging in size from 5.2 to 9.4 inches with an average length and weight of 8.3 inches and a third of a pound.  The population appears to be newly established as all of the fish were from just two year classes with fish being age 2 and age 3. <br> \n <br> \nWhile not specifically targeted during this survey 55 Northern Pike were sampled with spring trap nets.  Average size was 17.7 inches and 1.5 pounds with the largest fish being 35.4 inches long.  The lake may not be a destination for trophy Northern Pike, but anglers can encounter decent opportunities for this top predator. <br> \n <br> \nEight adult Walleye were also captured during this assessment with an average size of about 16 inches and 2 pounds.  The largest fish sampled was 26.8 inches long.  Size distribution was slightly larger than the summer sampling, which is typically used to describe Walleye populations in local lakes.  Walleye fingerlings are stocked in even numbered years.  More information can be found from the standard survey completed the week of July 22, 2019. <br> \n</p>",

Nearly all year classes were represented and age analysis showed the most evidence of natural reproduction of any assessment. In particular the 1987 year class (Age V) indicated a strong year class as it also did in the 1989 assessment.      Northern Pike catch per gillnet has remained quite stable over many years but the average size of 2 pounds this year is the largest yet.      The yellow Perch catch is up for the second straight assessment and is near historical levels.</p>",

Some 1/4 inch mesh trap net stations had been established in previous investigations and were included in both assessments in 2010 on Wye Lake.  The new 1/4 inch mesh trap net stations established exclusively for IBI sampling in both assessments have a Station ID number in the 100s. <br> \n <br> \nTwo IBI stations were sampled with 15 foot (1/8 inch mesh) seines and collected six species - pumpkinseed, blacknose shiner, Iowa darter, golden shiner, slimy sculpin and unidentified sunfish.  Eight IBI stations that were not sampled by seining were sampled with 1/4 inch mesh trap nets and collected eight species - yellow perch, pumpkinseed, blacknose shiner, golden shiner, rock bass, white sucker, northern pike and unidentified sunfish.  Back-pack electro-fishing, as a second sampling method, was conducted all ten IBI stations and collected 12 species - central mudminnow, yellow perch, pumpkinseed, Iowa darter, golden shiner, blacknose shiner, rock bass, northern pike, burbot, slimy sculpin, unidentified sunfish and unidentified minnows. <br> \n <br> \nVouchered specimens were sent to MNDNR Ecological and Water Resources for identification.  The unidentified sunfish were too small to be positively identified; however they were probably pumpkinseed.  The unidentified minnows were probably young-of-the-year blacknose shiner, but could not be confirmed in the field.  On 03/17/201, the identification results were not available and not used in this report.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Wye Lake is located six miles north and 10 miles east of Isabella in the Superior National Forest.  Public access is a 400 foot carry-in trail from USFS Road 369.  The lake is 52 acres, with a maximum depth of 13 feet.  Parking is limited to one or two vehicles.  Most open water angling occurs from a canoe or small boat.  There are a few spots for shore angling.  A user developed trail out to the end of the major point, on the northeast corner of Wye Lake, provides a good angling option.   <br> \n <br> \nWye Lake is a very soft-water lake with a Secchi disk reading of 5.0 feet in the brown, bog stained water.  The shore drops quickly off many of the points with significant aquatic vegetation in the bays. <br> \n <br> \nWye Lake is known as a lake that you can catch Walleyes during the day because of the dark bog stained water.  Walleye were sampled in below average numbers in gill nets and above average numbers in trap nets, compared to other northeastern Minnesota lakes with similar characteristics.  Wye Lake is one lake in the Finland area where Walleye frequent the near shore habitat, resulting in higher catches in trap net sets.  In the 2014 survey, 35.7% of Walleye caught were greater than 15 inches with the largest fish sampled at 18.50 inches and weighed 1.94 pounds.  The average weight of 0.8 pounds was below average and growth of Walleye in Wye Lake was slightly slower than the Finland Area average.  Walleye fingerling stocking, scheduled for every other year stocking, supplements the poor Walleye reproduction that is typical for Wye Lake. <br> \n <br> \nPike tend to be abundant but small in Wye Lake.  Northern Pike gill net catch of 4.7/lift was above average for lake class 12 and similar to the catch the past three investigations.  Mean weight of 1.7 pounds was average for the lake class and was larger than the past three investigations.  The largest fish sampled was 24.2 inches and weighed 3.1 pounds. The aged sample contained three year classes' age-2, 3 and 4. Northern Pike growth was faster than the Finland Area average. <br> \n <br> \nThere are also some nice size perch that can be caught in Wye Lake.  Yellow Perch gill net catch of 4.3/lift was slightly above average for the lake class and equal to the 2010 assessment.  Mean weight of 0.27 pounds was above average and slightly larger than 2010 (0.2 pounds).  One-third of the total catch was larger than nine inches with the largest individual 10.6 inches.  Historically the Yellow Perch in Wye Lake are larger than average.  <br> \n <br> \nIn addition to Northern Pike, Walleye, White Sucker and Yellow Perch, other species collected in 2014 were: Blacknose Shiner, Common Shiner, Golden Shiner and Pumpkinseed Sunfish. <br> \n</p>",
