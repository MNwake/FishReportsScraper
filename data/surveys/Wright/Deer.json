Walleye were not stocked into Deer Lake, but moved either from the North Fork of the Crow River or Buffalo Lake into Deer Lake.  Various sizes of Walleye were sampled with lengths ranging from 8.3 to 21.9 inches and an average length and weight of 13.2 inches and 0.9 pounds.  Yellow Perch numbers increased significantly from 3.6/gill net in 1988 to 32.0/gill net in 1993.  The sizes were fair, averaging 8.2 inches and 0.3 pounds with 67% 8.0 inches and longer and 1% 10 inches and longer.   The 1993 survey was the first year a Channel Catfish was sampled in Deer Lake.  The one fish sampled was 19.3 inches long and weighed 2.9 pounds.  Many Channel Catfish were seined at the Deer Lake Trap (at the outlet of Deer Lake) during the spring of 1993.The Black Crappie catch rate (3.0/gill net) was low but within the expected range of values for lakes similar to Deer.  The catch rate was much higher in 1988 (63.6/gill net), but the majority of the fish were small and from a strong 1986 year class.  The Northern Pike catch rate (1.3/gill net) was lower than the expected range for similar lakes and decreased significantly from the 1988 survey (32.0/gill net).  The size structure remained similar to the 1982 and 1988 surveys.  During the 1993 survey, Northern Pike ranged in length from 20.2 to 26.5 inches and averaged 22.9 inches and 2.6 pounds.The most abundant fish in both gill nets and trap nets were Black Bullhead.  Both trap net catch (143/net) and gill net catch (380/net) were much greater than expected for lakes like Deer.  The catch consisted mostly of small 5 to 7 inch fish.  Common Carp were captured in trap nets at a rate (1.3/net) similar to previous surveys, suggesting the numbers were stable.Largemouth Bass were caught at a rate of 21.9 fish per hour of electrofishing.  These were mostly small, ranging in size from 9.6 to 16.1 inches.  The average length was 11.3 inches and 0.8 pounds, with only 27% longer than 12 inches. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Deer Lake is located south of the city of Buffalo in Wright County. The lake is 163 acres and has a maximum depth of 27 feet. Deer Lake has a large watershed with land use dominated by agriculture, development, and pasture. A public access is located on the south end near the outlet. Mill Creek flows through Buffalo Lake into Deer Lake via a navigable channel and flows out of Deer Lake to the North Fork Crow River. Deer Lake was last surveyed in 2013. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye are not stocked, but likely immigrate from Buffalo Lake and the North Fork Crow River. Walleye net catches were within the expected range of values for lakes similar to Deer and have increased since the last survey to a record high for Deer Lake. Walleye ranged in length from 10.4 to 25.0 inches , with an average length and weight of 16.0 inches and 1.7 pounds. Growth was fast compared to the statewide average, taking two years to reach 15 inches. Fifty-three percent of Walleye were longer than 15 inches, and anglers may find themselves encountering more Walleye in Deer Lake for the next few years.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike numbers were also higher than 2013, but both catch rate and size were still within the range of expected values for similar lakes. Northern Pike ranged in length from 13.3 to 32.8 inches with an average length and weight of 21.8 inches and 2.4 pounds. Forty-five percent of Northern Pike were longer than 21 inches with nineteen percent longer than 26 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass were sampled by boat electrofishing in the spring and the catch rate was similar to the Sauk Rapid's area average . Largemouth bass lengths ranged from 6.8 to 20.5 inches with an average length and weight of 14.0 inches and 1.8 pounds. Forty-six percent of Largemouth Bass were longer than 15 inches. <br> \n  <br> \nBlack Crappie net catches were within the range of expected values for lakes similar to Deer, but were higher than 2013 and 1993. Black Crappie lengths ranged from 5.8 to 12.8 inches with an average length and weight of 8.5 inches and 0.4 pounds. Seventy-two percent of Black Crappie were longer than 8 inches and fourteen percent were longer than 10 inches. Anglers may find a higher abundance of Black Crappie in coming years, and larger fish with more opportunity for harvest than in the past. <br> \n <br> \nThe Bluegill catch was the highest on record for Deer Lake, consisting of many, smaller fish. Bluegill lengths ranged from 3.1 to 9.1 inches with an average length and weight of 5.4 inches and 0.2 pounds. Yellow perch numbers have been highly variable, possibly due to the fluctuation in Northern Pike numbers, but were higher in 2023 than in 2013. Yellow Perch lengths in 2023 ranged from 4.5 to 7.4 inches with a mean length of 5.9 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nOther species captured included: Black Bullhead, Brown Bullhead, Bowfin (Dogfish), Channel Catfish, Common Carp, Golden Shiner, Green Sunfish, Hybrid Sunfish, Pumpkinseed, Bigmouth Buffalo, White Sucker, and Yellow Bullhead. The black bullhead numbers have increased from 2013 to 2023 but remain lower than previous surveys.  <br> \n</p>",

The average length group was 5.5-5.9 inches. \n\nImportant species caught in the trap nets were Black Crappie, Bluegill, Yellow Bullhead, and Black Bullhead. Black Crappie were captured at a rate of 13.3/trap net, a decline from 1982. However, they were caught at a rate of 63.6/net in the gill nets. Fish ranged in size from 5-13.3 inches with an average length group of 5.5-5.9 inches. Growth for Black Crappie was good. Bluegill were captured at a rate of 3.7/trap net, comparable to 1982. The average length group was 5.5-5.9 inches. Growth was good. Black Bullhead are abundant and net catches were up from 1982. The average length group was 5.5-5.9 inches.

                "narrative": "<p>Deer Lake is located south of Buffalo Lake and the city of Buffalo in Wright County. The lake is 163 acres and has a maximum depth of 27 feet. Deer Lake has a large watershed with most land use in agriculture or development. A public access is located on the south end near the outlet. Mill Creek runs through Buffalo Lake into Deer Lake via a navigable channel and flows out of Deer Lake to the North Fork Crow River. Deer Lake was last surveyed in 1993. Eleven aquatic plant species were found; sago pondweed and coontail were the most common, but curly-leaf pondweed and Eurasian watermilfoil (invasive species) were also widespread. Curly-leaf pondweed covered 1.3% of the lake surface area in June. No water lilies, bulrush or cattail were found. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye are not stocked, but likely immigrate from Buffalo Lake and the North Fork Crow River. Walleye net catches were within the expected range of values for lakes similar to Deer, but have declined since 1993. Walleye ranged in length from 18.5 to 23.5 inches with an average length and weight of 20.6 inches and 2.8 pounds. Growth was average; age five Walleye reached almost 20 inches. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike numbers were much higher than in 1993, but both catch rate and size were still within the range of expected   values for similar lakes. Northern Pike ranged in length from 18.6 to 35.4 inches with an average length and weight of 22.9 inches and 2.8 pounds. Growth was average; Northern Pike reached 21-22 inches at age four. Nineteen percent were longer than 24 inches. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass were sampled by boat electrofishing in the spring and the catch rate was below the Montrose area average. Largemouth Bass ranged in length from 8.2 to 20.2 inches with an average length and weight of 13 inches and 1.4 pounds. Thirty percent were longer than 15 inches. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie net catches were within the range of expected values and similar to 1993. Black Crappie lengths ranged from 3.9 to 10.4 inches with an average length and weight of 7.4 inches and 0.26 pounds. Growth was average; Black Crappie averaged 7.8 inches at age three. <br> \n <br> \nThe Bluegill catch rate was lower than expected, but higher than 1993. Bluegill ranged in length from 3.5 to 8.4 inches with an average length and weight of 6.8 inches and 0.25 pounds. Bluegill growth was average, reaching 6.7 inches at age five. Yellow Perch numbers were very high historically, but low in 2013, perhaps due to increasing numbers of Northern Pike. Yellow Perch lengths ranged from 5.9 to 8.7 inches and averaged 7.2 inches and 0.16 pounds. <br> \n <br> \nOther species captured included: Bigmouth Buffalo, Black Bullhead, Bowfin, Channel Catfish, Common Carp, Hybrid Sunfish, Smallmouth Bass, and White Sucker. Black Bullhead numbers declined dramatically in 2013 and a possible explanation is an increase in the Channel Catfish population. Water quality has also improved in recent years, favoring other species. <br> \n</p>",
