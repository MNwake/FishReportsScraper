                "narrative": "<p>Medicine Lake is a 446-acre lake with a maximum depth of 44 feet located eight miles west of Blackduck in Beltrami County.  There is an unimproved public access on the northeast shore of the lake with parking for about ten trucks/trailers.  Most of the lakeshore remains undeveloped with the exception of one resort and a small number of lakeshore cabins.  Medicine Lake has abundant stands of aquatic vegetation, in particular several species of pondweed known as \"cabbage\" to anglers.  Many of the lake's fish species are associated with this type of habitat throughout the year.  Water quality measurements taken in August, 2013 showed good oxygen levels for fish down to a depth of 20 feet.  There is a special regulation for northern pike consisting of a 24 to 36-inch protected slot with one pike over 36 inches allowed in the daily possession limit of three fish.  Medicine Lake is managed for walleye, northern pike, bluegill, black crappie, and largemouth bass.  The lake's walleye population is maintained by fingerling stocking on alternate years.  The 2013 fish population assessment walleye catch rate of 5.33 fish per gill net (5.33/GN) was above the range of catch rates considered typical for Lake Class 29 lakes (3/GN).  Walleye up to 28.4 inches in length were captured in the assessment, with an average size of 16.1 inches in length and 1.58 lbs.  The walleye length frequency distribution consisted of fairly evenly distributed numbers of fish from sixteen to twenty inches (keepers) as well as younger fish less than 13 inches in length, which shows the success of recent stocking efforts and bodes well for the lake's walleye population.  The 2013 northern pike catch rate of 10.44/GN was within the normal range for Lake Class 29 lakes but higher than the management goal for the population.  Despite the high abundance of pike, the size structure of the population consisted of a good proportion of quality-size fish with 24% of the sample exceeding 30 inches in length.  Northern pike up to 35 inches in length were captured during the assessment, with an average size of 24.6 inches and 3.41 lbs.  The 2013 bluegill catch rate of 5.38 fish per trap net (5.38/TN) was below the normal range for Lake Class 29.  Bluegill have never been particularly abundant in Medicine Lake, although some quality-sized fish up to 9.2 inches in length were captured.  Fourteen percent of bluegill captured in the 2013 assessment were greater than eight inches in length.  Catch rates for black crappie (3.0/TN and 2.33/GN) were near the upper end of the normal range for Lake Class 29 lakes.  Forty-seven percent of black crappie captured were between ten and twelve inches in length.  Age-1, age-2 and age-3 black crappie were identified, indicating successful reproduction in recent years.  Largemouth bass are not sampled effectively in standard population assessments, but Medicine Lake is known for having a low-density largemouth bass population that produces some large individual fish from time to time.  Few anglers pursue the species in Medicine Lake.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Medicine Lake is about 10 miles north of Turtle River, Minnesota along County Road 23.  It has a small public access and one resort.  The lake watershed is divided between public lands and several small farms.  There is little shoreline development.     It is in fisheries lake class 29 a group of lakes, typically, moderate in size, regular in shape (lacking bays, points or islands) and with a high percentage of littoral area.  Littoral area is the productive zone generally less than fifteen feet in depth, where light penetration can reach the bottom.      Primary management is for walleye, and fingerlings are stocked during alternate years to supplement limited natural reproduction.  There is a good population of walleye  with many fish between 12 and 16 inches long, most originating from the 1996 stocking.  Walleye as large as 27 inches long were sampled.  About 10% of the walleye examined had Neascus, (Black spot) a visible parasite of fish but not harmful to humans.     Due to the increasing harvest of larger northern pike and consistent successful natural reproduction, Medicine lake developed a population dominated by many small pike.  Lakes like this are commonly called \"hammer-handle lakes,\" referring to the small average size of the pike.  In 1986 only about 4% of the pike population exceeded 22 inches (2.5 pounds).  In an attempt to improve the size structure, experimental regulations were set up to protect all pike between 22 and 30 inches, with only one over 30 inches allowed in possession.  Protection of pike in this size range is intended not only to increase their abundance but also to suppress the abundance of small fish by predation.  Ironically, by protecting some selected size fish from harvest, a reduction in pike abundance may be possible.  It appears this strategy may be working since pike abundance is as low as it has been since 1958, and there has been an improvement in size structure with 28% of the pike exceeding 22 inches in 1998.  This improvement is also confirmed by the resort owner who has seen a substantial increase in the number of pike caught that exceeded 30 inches in length.     Yellow perch are common but with an average length of about 6.8 inches most are not acceptable to anglers.  About one-half of the perch examined had yellow grub or Neascus.     Bluegill and black crappie are sparse but a few nice fish are present.  Low abundance can be attributed to successive year class failures in the early 1990's.  This occurred in many area lakes and is likely due to a colder weather pattern.  Fish of the ages (3-6 years old) would normally make up most of a panfish population.  Some older fish are still available,  providing quality size.  Survival of more recent year classes makes a return to normal abundance look promising.  Small pumpkinseed sunfish are now the most abundant panfish present.     Largemouth bass, which have some of the same spawning requirements, may be in a similar pattern.  Some quality size, older largemouth bass are present.  Exceptional numbers of small fish produced in 1998 were captured showing a potential for excellent fishing in the next few years as they grow to a catchable size.     Bullheads are present, and though they are not abundant, some acceptable sized fish are present.     The apparent response of the northern pike population to the experimental regulations illustrates the potential benefits of selective harvest.  Voluntary release of larger pike could have similar results on other waters if the practice were to gain widespread acceptance.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Medicine Lake is a 461-acre lake with a maximum depth of 44 feet located 8 miles west of the city of Blackduck in Beltrami County. There is a public access on the northeast shore of the lake with a gravel ramp and parking for about 10 trucks/trailers. Medicine Lake is managed for Walleye, Northern Pike, Bluegill, Black Crappie and Largemouth Bass. A special regulation for Northern Pike consisting of a 3 fish bag limit and protected length limit from 24 to 36 inches with one fish allowed over 36 inches is in effect. There is also a reduced bag limit of 5 sunfish per day. <br> \n <br> \nMedicine Lake is stocked with Walleye fingerlings every other year. The 2023 Walleye gill net catch rate of 1.8 fish per net was below the range found in previous surveys. Walleyes captured had a good size average of 15.7 inches and 1.3 lbs./fish with Walleyes just short of 20 inches measured in this survey.      <br> \n <br> \nThe Northern Pike population is one of lower density and higher quality compared to most lakes of this size in the North-central Management Zone. The special regulation on pike has been effective in producing a higher ratio of preferred sized fish. The gill net catch rate of 3.8 fish per net was lower than the previous survey but pike averaged 22.4 inches in length and the largest exceeded 32 inches.     <br> \n <br> \nBluegill and Black Crappie catch rates from standard surveys have always been low on Medicine Lake, although good fishing for both species can be found there. Bluegill up to 9.1 inches and Black Crappie up to 11.4 inches in length were captured in the 2023 survey.   <br> \n <br> \nOther species of fish captured in the 2023 survey were Bullhead species, Largemouth Bass, Pumpkinseed, White Sucker and Yellow Perch. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Medicine Lake is a 446-acre lake with a maximum depth of 44 feet.  The lake is located eight miles west of Blackduck in central Beltrami County.  There is a DNR public access on the east end of the lake off county road 23.  The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different lake classes based on physical and chemical characteristics.  Medicine Lake is in lake class 29.  Other lakes in the same lake class include Delwater, Jackson, Lost, Meadow, Sandy, Silver, Windigo and Bagley Lakes.  Typically lakes in this class have high amounts of shallow productive area (less than 15 feet deep) and have regular shaped shorelines (lacking islands and bays).The DNR manages Medicine Lake for walleye, northern pike, black crappie, bluegill and largemouth bass.  There is an experimental regulation in place to help improve the size of northern pike.  It is a protected slot limit 22\" - 30\" where anglers need to return all northern pike in this slot.  Only one pike more than 30 inches can be kept as part of their possession limit.Northern pike abundance had been increasing incrementally over the first four population assessments, from 1958 (5/gill net), to a historical high in 1986 (19/gill net).  Average size during those four assessments was fairly consistent, ranging from 1.1 - 1.4 pounds.  High abundance and small size of pike prompted implementation of the experimental size regulations in 1988.  Coincidentally, pike gill net catch rate dropped immediately to 8/net the year the regulation was implemented, certainly too early for effects to be noticeable.  More likely, a switch in the timing from traditional summer sampling to September netting may have actually influenced the catch rate.  The average weight of pike in 1988 remained at 1.2 pounds.  Comparable September assessments in 1998 and 2003 resulted in moderate declines in gill net catch rate.  Average size also showed moderate increases to 2.0 pounds (1998) and 2.1 pounds (2003).  The experimental regulation is being reviewed with a sunset date of March 1, 2007.  This current survey data, as well as special spring trap netting (2002 and 2003) and creel survey (2003 - 2004) will be used to evaluate the effectiveness of this regulation.  Public comment is encouraged any time, but a formal public review period will be announced prior to dropping, extending or modifying the current size regulations.  Walleye are stocked on alternating years in Medicine Lake.  In 2003 walleye abundance was higher than what you would typically find in other class 29 lakes.  Walleye sampled showed a wide range of lengths from 8 - 29.5 inches.Bluegill have never been extremely abundant in Medicine Lake, but it has long been known to produce some quality size fish.  The main reason for fluctuation in abundance may be inconsistent production of young bluegill.  In the past three surveys, the population has been made up of only two to five different ages of bluegills.  Lakes with consistent production may have as many as ten differnt ages present.  This pattern of inconsistent recruitment has been seen on other area lakes.  Since lakes in the Bemidji Area are near the northern edge of the bluegill range, they have very short growing seasons for bluegill.  While they may spawn every year, late spawning or cool temperatures during the growing season may result in young bluegill too small to survive their first winter.  This would explain the total absence of some ages of bluegill in the population.  The good news is that Medicine Lake bluegill grow very well.  At two years old bluegill were 3.5 inches long compared to the state average for this lake class of 2.4 inches.  Those conditions that result in missing ages result in reduced competition and better growth.  Those lakes with low to moderate abundance and good growth produce the quality size bluegill anglers prefer but may be most vulnerable to over harvest.In 2003 test netting assessment, black crappie abundance was the highest recorded in any previous assessment.  Black crappie sampled ranged in length from 4.3 - 9.0 inches.  Survey data is supported by the 2003 summer creel survey where black crappie were harvested more by anglers than any other fish in Medicine Lake.  Anglers interviewed during the creel survey harvested black crappie ranging from 7 - 15 inches with an average length of 10 inches.  Experimental nets select for slightly different size than anglers which explains the differing size ranges between test netting and angler harvest.Many lakes in the Bemidji/Blackduck area have had much development which has likely impacted fish habitat and water quality.  Over half the shoreline on Medicine Lake is privately owned and subject to development.  Shoreline areas are critical areas for fish production and water quality.  Overdeveloped shorelines can't support the fish, wildlife and clean water that is associated with natural undeveloped lakes.  The combined effects of all lakeshore owners \"fixing up\" their property can greatly affect a lake's ability to produce fish and protect water quality.  Lakeshore owners can minimize their impact on shoreline and maintain a more natural setting.  For more information on how to accomplish this, contact your nearest Area Fisheries office.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of nearshore fish species in Medicine Lake was conducted on July 18, 27, 31, 2023 by Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program Staff. Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at all ten sampling stations, but three stations were sampled from the boat due to site conditions. Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample five stations, a 15-foot seine was used to sample two stations, and site conditions prevented the use of seines at three stations. Nearshore sampling captured 12 species of fish including three species that are intolerant of disturbance (i.e., Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, and Iowa Darter). <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore data was combined with gill net and trap net data from an August 2023 survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based IBI (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment. In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g., Blackchin Shiner, Iowa Darter, and Rock Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g., Green Sunfish). The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.   <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Upper/Lower Red Lake River Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency. <br> \n <br> \nIBI Program staff also conducted an assessment of lakeshore habitat on May 25, 2023, following the Score the Shore survey protocols. The assessment consisted of 35 survey sites evenly spaced 100 meters around the lake. Assessments were made in three habitat zones: Shoreline Zone (the shore-water interface to the top of the natural bank), Shoreland Zone (land-ward from shoreline to development structure or 100 feet), and Aquatic Zone (lake-ward 50 feet of shoreline). The average lakewide habitat score was 89.1 (+/- 2.2) out of 100 possible. Approximately 14 percent of the sites were developed with a mean score of 72.0 (+/- 412.6), while undeveloped sites had a mean score of 92.0 (+/- 1.1). <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Medicine Lake is a 461-acre lake with a maximum depth of 44 feet located 8 miles west of the city of Blackduck in Beltrami County.  There is a public access on the northeast shore of the lake with a gravel ramp and parking for about 10 trucks/trailers.  Medicine Lake is managed for Walleye, Northern Pike, Bluegill, Black Crappie and Largemouth Bass.  A special regulation for Northern Pike consisting of a 3 fish bag limit and protected length limit from 24 to 36 inches with one fish allowed over 36 inches is in effect.  Statewide regulations apply to all other species in the lake.   <br> \n <br> \nMedicine Lake is stocked with Walleye fingerlings every other year.  The 2018 Walleye gill net catch rate of 4.78 fish per net was above the range typically found in similar lakes (0.50 fish to 3.0 fish per net).  Walleye captured had a good average size of 16.49 inches and 1.68 lbs/fish with fish up to 27.83 inches in length captured in this survey.      <br> \n <br> \nThe lake's Northern Pike population is doing well.  The special regulation on Northern Pike has been very effective in producing a high quality pike fishery not typical of most lakes of this size in the North-central Management Zone. The gill net catch rate of 6.11 fish per net was near the median catch rate of 8.44 fish per net from lakes similar to Medicine.  Northern Pike averaged 23.35 inches in length with fish up to 36.14 inches captured.      <br> \n <br> \nBluegill and Black Crappie catch rates from standard surveys have always been low on Medicine Lake although good fishing for both species can be found here.  Bluegill up to 9.33 inches and Black Crappie up to 13.35 inches in length were captured in gill nets in 2018.   <br> \n <br> \nThe Largemouth Bass population is typical of a smaller lake in Beltrami County.  Of the 44 fish captured, 45 percent were over 12 inches in length and one fish measured just under 19 inches showing a potential for larger fish.  This was the first year night electrofishing was conducted specifically for bass so little is certain about the bass population in Medicine but it appears to be expanding and maturing.   <br> \n <br> \nOther species of fish captured in the 2018 survey were Bullhead species, Pumpkinseed, White Sucker and Yellow Perch. <br> \n</p>",
