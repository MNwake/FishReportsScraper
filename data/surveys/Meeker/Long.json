                "narrative": "<p>STATUS OF THE FISHERY:\nNet catch data was compared to similar lakes around the state.  Gamefish species captured in the gillnets included northern pike, largemouth bass, black crappie, yellow perch and walleye.  Only one northern pike was captured in the gillnets, for a catch rate of 0.2/net.  No northern pike were captured in the trapnets.  The gillnet catch was below the normal range for this type of lake.  \n\nLargemouth bass were sampled in both the gillnets and trapnets.  The gillnet catch of 0.3/net was within the normal range for this type of lake.  The trapnet catch of largemouth bass was 1.8/net, which was above the normal range for this lake type.  Most bass sampled were age 1 fish, ranging in length from 5 to 8 inches.  Two age 3 fish were sampled and these fish were in the 9.5 to 10.4 inch range.  Long Lake should be sampled by electrofishing to further assess the largemouth bass population.  \n\nYellow perch were abundant in Long Lake.  Perch were captured in the gillnets at a rate of 76/net, which is above the normal range for this lake type.  This represents a large increase in perch abundance.  Over 80% of the perch were age 2 fish that ranged in length from 5.5 to 7 inches.  Walleye abundance appears to have increased in Long Lake.  They were captured in gillnets at a rate of 7/net, which is within the normal range for this lake type.  The 1989 survey showed walleye to be present at a rate of 1.7/gillnet.  Most of the walleye sampled this year were age 3 and 4 fish that ranged in length from 15 to 20 inches.  Nearly 50% of the walleye present in this year's survey were from the 1988 year class.  The age classes of walleye present in this year's assessment can be accounted for from past stocking records.\n\nOther important gamefish sampled in trapnets included pumpkinseed, bluegill and black crappie.  Pumpkinseed were abundant at 28/trapnet, which is above the normal range for this lake type.  Most of the pumpkinseed sampled were less than 6 inches long.  Bluegill were also abundant.  The trapnet catch of 180/net was well above the normal range for this type of lake.  This was the highest recorded catch of bluegill on Long Lake.  With the exception of the 1984 survey (109/net), bluegill numbers have been within the normal range for this type of lake.  Over 95% of the bluegill sampled this year were age 2 and most were from 4.5 to 5.5 inches long.  Black crappie numbers in trapnets (1.5/set) were below the normal range for this lake type.  The gillnet catch of black crappie was 3.8/set.  Almost all of the black crappie sampled were age 1 and age 2.\n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Long Lake is a small lake that sits at the top of a small watershed.  The result is a lake with good water quality anddiverse aquatic vegetation.  Due to these physical conditions Long Lake is probably best suited to largemouth bass andbluegill populations.A fisheries survey was conducted on Long Lake in 1994 that included an assessment of fish populations using standardlake survey gillnets, trapnets, shoreline seining and spring, night electrofishing.   Fish species of particular interest captured in the survey included black crappie, bluegill, largemouth bass, northernpike, walleye, yellow bullhead and yellow perch.The black crappie gillnet catch was slightly above the lake class average, but within the normal range.  No black crappie were sampled in trapnets.  Black crappie abundance appears to fluctuate on Long Lake.  Several age classes of black crappie were sampled, but age three fish represented 80% of the sample.  Growth was good with an average length of 8.4 inches for age three black crappie.  Bluegill were abundant with trapnet catches above the normal range for this lake class.  Above average numbers of bluegill have been documented in several past surveys.  Several age classes of bluegill were present, indicating consistent reproduction.  Bluegill sampled ranged in length from 5.1 to 7.2 inches with an average length of 6.4 inches.  Bluegill this size should interest anglers.  The largemouth bass population in Long Lake appears to be doing well.  Net catches of largemouth bass were above average for this lake class.  Largemouth bass were also sampled by night electrofishing in the spring.  Electrofishing sampled good numbers of bass over a wide size range.  Most bass sampled were young fish, but several nice size fish were collected.Northern pike numbers were below normal for this lake class.  Northern pike abundance may be dependent upon adequatewater levels to provide access to suitable spawning habitat.  Northern pike captured in gillnets ranged in length from17.4 to 25.9 inches with an average length of 20.9 inches.  Four of the five northern pike sampled were age one and exhibited good growth, with an average length of nearly 20 inches.  Similar to other Area lakes, increased numbers of young northern pike have been observed.  This may indicate a rebound of northern pike numbers with increasing water levels since the drought years of the late 1980's. The walleye gillnet catch was above the lake class average.  Various walleye stocking strategies have been employed onLong Lake, but it is uncertain if the present walleye population is the result of stocking or natural reproduction.  With the exception of a survey in 1992, previous surveys have documented below average walleye numbers.  Several age classes of walleye were present in the sample with age two fish representing 67% of the catch.  Average length of age two walleye was 11.4 inches.A yellow bullhead trapnet catch of 5.2 per net was slightly above the lake class average.  Yellow bullhead sampled in trapnets ranged in length from 5.5 to 12.2 inches with a mean length of 8.7 inches.  Yellow bullhead this size should interest anglers.Yellow perch were abundant with a gillnet catch well above the normal range for this lake class.  Past surveys have documented wide fluctuations in yellow perch numbers.  Average length of yellow perch was 6.5 inches, which is not an acceptable size to most anglers.  However, most perch were age three and may provide angling opportunities as they grow.           </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A resurvey was conducted at Long Lake in 2013 to monitor the Lake's chemical, physical, and biological characteristics.  The current Lake Management Plan listed Largemouth Bass and Bluegill as primary management species while Northern Pike and Black Crappie were listed as a secondary species.  Water clarity was good on June 24, with a secchi disk reading of 6.0 feet.  Long's lakeshed (983 acres) was mostly forest (32%), cropland (27%), and residential (23%).  Approximately 51% of the shoreline was developed with private homes, many being year round residences.  White water lilies were abundant, while yellow water lilies were rare on Long Lake.  A quality aquatic plant community was present at Long Lake in 2013.  The maximum depth at which submergent vegetation was found was 13.9 feet.  Curlyleaf pondweed can be abundant in May and June.  It usually begins dying back in early July.  For shoalwater substrates; sand and silt werel common.  Most of the eastern shoreline remained undeveloped in 2013.  Long Lake has a history of winterkill with a substantial kill (especially on Bluegill, Carp, and Largemouth Bass) occurring in 2011.  Fish populations can fluctuate greatly depending on the frequency and severity of winterkill.   <br> \n   <br> \nWalleye were not gill netted or trap netted in 2013.  Walleye were last stocked in 1994 and a substantial fishery has not existed since the mid 1990's.  Long Lake's habitat (abundant submergent vegetation and sandy shores) is better suited for Bluegill and Largemouth Bass.  <br> \n    <br> \nGill nets sampled 88 Northern Pike for a catch rate of 14.7/net, which was above the normal range and the highest on record for Long Lake.  Northern Pike were the most abundant fish sampled in the gill nets.  Catch rates from 1973 to 2013 (n=9) were mostly low, ranging from 0.2 to 14.7/net with an average of 3.3.  In 2013, gill netted Northern Pike were 15.8 to 33.5 inches long with an average of 22.2.  An impressive 7% of the gill net sample was 30 inches or longer.  Trap nets sampled 5 fish that were 29\" or longer, with a maximum length of 35.9 inches.  Average and maximum lengths indicated that a quality population was present.  Northern Pike were age-2 through age-6 with 5 year-classes present.  Age-2 through age-4 fish were well represented, accounting for 90% of the gill net sample.  A total of 391 Northern Pike were stocked on 12/11/09 weighing 326 pounds.  Many Northern Pike likely survived the winterkill, explaining the strong recruitment in 2011.  High numbers (50+) of yearling Northern Pike were observed during the 2012 spring nighttime electrofishing assessment for Largemouth Bass, indicating excellent reproduction in 2011.  Growth was moderate.     <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled 36 Yellow Perch for a catch rate of 6.0/net, which was within the normal range for a lake of this type.  Catch rates from 1973 to 2013 (n=9) were highly variable ranging from 2.0 to 96.2/net with an average of 25.3.  Gill netted Yellow Perch were 6.3 to 8.6 inches long with an average of 7.4.     <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled 2 Black Crappie for a catch rate of 0.3/net, which was below the normal range for a lake of this type and the lowest ever recorded at Long Lake.  The 2008 catch rate was 2.0/net.   Gill net catch rates from 1973 to 2013 (n=9) were mostly low, ranging from 0.3 to 10.0/net with an average of 4.6.  The latest three catch rates showed a possible decreasing trend in Black Crappie abundance.  In 2013, gill netted Black Crappie were 10.3 and 10.9 inches long.  Trap nets sampled 7 Black Crappie for a catch rate of 0.8/net, which was also below the normal range.  The 2008 trap net catch rate was similar at 0.6/net.  Trap net catch rates from 1973 to 2013 (n=10) were mostly low, ranging from 0.0 to 12.5/net with an average of 3.3.  Trap netted Black Crappie were 3.6 to 11.2 inches long with an average of 7.0.  Trap netted Black Crappie were age-2 to age-6, with three year-classes present.   <br> \n <br> \nTrap nets sampled 287 Bluegill for a catch rate of 31.9/net, which was within the normal range for a lake of this type.  Bluegill were the most abundant fish sampled in the trap nets in 2013.  The 2008 catch rate was at 129.2/net.  The 2011 winterkill was likely responsible for the large drop in Bluegill numbers.  Catch rates from 1973 to 2013 (n=10) were variable, ranging from 10.8 to 181.1/net with an average of 77.9.  In 2013, trap netted Bluegill were 2.3 to 8.6 inches long with an average of 6.5.  An impressive 58% of the trap net catch was 7 inches or longer, while 77% were 6 inches or longer.  The length frequency distribution indicated that a quality population was present.  Bluegill were age-2 to age-5 with four year-classes present.  Bluegill that survived the winterkill (age-3, age-4, and age-5's) were growing fast.  Good numbers of nice sized Bluegill should be of interest to sunfish anglers.  <br> \n  <br> \nSpring night-time electrofishing sampled 123 Largemouth Bass for a catch rate of 49.5/hr of electrofisher on-time.  The catch rates in 2011 and 2012, following the winterkill, were 0.0 and 28.3/hr.  The three most recent catch rates indicated an increasing trend in abundance of Largemouth Bass at Long Lake.  Catch rates from 1994 to 2013 (n=8) were variable, ranging from 0.0 to 72.9/hr of electrofisher on-time with an average of 41.0.  Electrofished Largemouth Bass were 4.5 to 18.4 inches long with an average of 9.4.  Approximately 87% of the catch was less than 12 inches in length.  The length frequency distribution indicated a population dominated by small fish, as would be expected following a severe winterkill.  Largemouth Bass were age-1 through age-6 with 5 year-classes being present.  Age-2 and age-1 fish made up 63% and 30% of the sample, respectively, that could be aged.  The older fish could either be from the 45 adult broodstock that were reintroduced following the kill or fish that survived the winterkill.  Growth was fast.  Good numbers of 11 to 14 inch fish should be present by the 2014 bass opener. <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled 0 Black Bullhead in 2013.  Catch rates from 1973 to 2013 (n=8) were mostly low, ranging from 0.0 to 27.7/net with an average of 10.9. Trap nets sampled 6 Black Bullhead for a catch rate of 0.7/net which was below the normal range for a lake of this type.  Catch rates from 1973 to 2013 (n=9) were mostly low ranging from 0.1 to 16.8/net with an average of 3.1.  Trap netted Black Bullhead were 10.1 to 13.2 inches long with an average of 11.2.        <br> \n <br> \nCarp were not sampled in 2013.  Carp have not been sampled in high numbers since the 1989 assessment (5.8/gill net).   </p>",

No spawning area for walleye and limited spawning for northern pike.  Crappie abundance is high.  White and black crappies - growth rate somewhat below average.  Strongest age groups in white and black crappies are 4, 5, and 6.  Prominent age classes of pumpkinseed are 3, 4, and 5.  Pumpkinseed average growth to age 4, decreased growth at age 5.  Bluegill abundant, average growth in ages 3 and 4, decreasing thereafter.  Black bullheads have a very high population.  Reproduction good for largemouth bass and bluegill.  Seine catches indicated low reproduction for crappies, perch, and pumpkinseed this year.   <br> \n</p>",

Trapnet catches for all species have declined since the last survey, but this may have been due to low water levels.  Bluegills are abundant (23.16/pot), though fishermen report them to be of a small size.  Northern pike were captured at 3.5/gillnet.  Largemouth bass fingerlings were captured during shoreline seining and angling is reported fair to excellent for this species. <br> \n</p>",

Spring night-time electrofishing (EF), targeting largemouth bass, was conducted on 6/03/03.  Bluegill dominated the trap net catch while pumpkinseed sunfish were the most abundant fish sampled in gill nets.  The lake is long and narrow with a maximum depth of 28 feet.  Aquatic vegetation is moderate to abundant, especially in May and June, and most of the east shore is undeveloped.  A small access is located on the south end of the 163 acre lake.  White and yellow waterlily along with hardstem bullrush are scattered around the lakes perimeter.Net catches in 2003 indicated that the lake was loaded with bluegill (132.0/net).  Unfortunately only 1% of the sample was 7\" or longer.  Small pumpkinseed sunfish, green sunfish and hybrid sunfish were also sampled in good numbers in this classic bass/panfish lake.  Black crappie, though not abundant (5.3/net), were nice sized.  Approximately 47% of the black crappie sampled were 8\" or longer, including three fish in the 12-13\" range.  The same can be said for the lakes northern pike population.  The northern pike catch rate (2.3/net) was low when compared to similar lakes around the state, but was actually average when compared to past nettings (1973-2003) at Long Lake.  Low catch rates usually mean a larger average size, and that was the case at Long Lake in 2003.  Gill net sampled pike averaged 26.8\" and the longest fish sampled was 37.2\".  One walleye was netted and it measured 23.7\" (5.1 lbs).  Walleye were last stocked in 1994 and the population is probably small.  If you're angling at Long Lake near Dassel your probably after largemouth bass.  The lake has a reputation for lots of action and the occasional lunker.  Spring night-time electrofishing sampled 148 bass ranging from 6.8-19.7\".  The average size was 11.6 inches.  Good numbers of bass from 12-17\" were sampled in 2003.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A standard survey was conducted at Long Lake near Dassel, beginning on June 25, 2018, to monitor the fish population.  Long is a class 34 lake and net catches were compared to similar lakes around the state.  The 2014 lake management plan (LMP) listed Bluegill and Largemouth Bass as the primary management species while Northern Pike were considered a secondary management species.  A total of 12 species, plus Hybrid Sunfish, were sampled in the gill nets (GN), trap nets (TN), or by spring night-time electrofishing, the latter of which targets Largemouth Bass.  On June 25, the dissolved oxygen concentration fell below 2.0 mg/l at 16.0 feet, indicating that some of the lake (maximum depth of 28 feet) lacked adequate oxygen for fish use at this time of the year.  Water clarity was excellent, with a secchi disk reading of 9.1 feet.  Long Lake has had a history of occasional winterkill, with the latest significant event occurring in 2011.  Fish populations can fluctuate greatly depending on the frequency and severity of winterkill at Long Lake.  Curlyleaf Pondweed, a non-native aquatic plant, can be abundant during May and June and then typically dies back in early July. <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled high numbers of Northern Pike (65) for a catch rate of 10.8/net, which was above the lake's normal range and was the second highest catch ever measured at Long Lake.  The 2014 LMP's Northern Pike long range goal (>2.3/net and <5.1/net) was not met.  The 2013 catch rate was also high (14.7/net).  Catch rates from 1973 to 2018 (n=10) were mostly low, ranging from 0.2 to 14.7/net with an average of 4.0.  Historically, recruitment could be classified as low at Long Lake.  In recent years (2013 to 2018, n=2) the average catch rate (12.7/GN) was six times higher than the average from the 1973 to 2008 time period (n=6) which was 1.9/GN.  In 2018, GN Northern Pike were 18.3 to 32.1 inches long with an average of 23.0.  Approximately 11% of the catch was 29 inches or longer, indicating a quality size structure.  Size distributions indicated that multiple age classes were present.  New Northern Pike zone regulations went into effect in the spring of 2018.  Long is in the north central regulation zone, which has a 10 fish bag limit, where all fish from 22 to 26 inches in length have to be immediately released and only two harvested fish can be over 26 inches long.  Darkhouse spearers are allowed to have one fish in the protected slot limit.  Over the last 19 years, Long Lake was rarely clear enough for spearing. <br> \n <br> \nTrap nets sampled low numbers of Black Crappie (2) for a catch rate of 0.2/net.  The 2018 TN catch rate was below the lake's normal range.  The 2013 TN catch rate was similar (0.8/net).  Catch rates from 1973 to 2018 (n=11) were mostly low, ranging from 0.0 to 12.5/net with an average of 3.0.  In 2018, the two TN Black Crappie were both 8.3 inches long.  Gill nets also sampled low numbers of Black Crappie (15) for a catch rate of 2.5/net, which was within the lake's normal range.  The 2013 GN catch rate was 0.3/net.  Gill net catch rates from 1973 to 2018 (n=10) were variable, ranging from 0.3 to 10.0/net with an average of 4.4.  Gill netted Black Crappie were 6.1 to 8.6 inches long with an average of 7.6.  Size distributions and catch rates indicated inconsistent recruitment.   <br> \n <br> \nGill nets and TN's failed to sample any Walleye in 2018.  The 2013 Walleye GN catch rate was also 0.0/net.  Catch rates from 1973 to 2018 (n=10), under various stocking regimes or no stocking, were mostly low, ranging from 0.0 to 7.0/net with an average of 1.6.  Walleye were last stocked in 1994.   <br> \n <br> \nTrap nets sampled high numbers of Bluegill (1,060) for a catch rate of 117.8/net which was above the lake's normal range.  The 2014 LMP's Bluegill long range goal (>5.9/TN and <43.3) was not met.  The 2013 catch rate was much lower at 31.9/net.  Catch rates from 1973 to 2018 (n=11) were variable, ranging from 10.8 to 181.1/net, with an average of 81.6.  In 2018, TN Bluegill were 3.2 to 7.8 inches long with an average of 5.6.  Approximately 8% of the catch was 7.0 inches or longer, indicating a poor size structure.  Historical TN data from 1992 to 2018 (n=6) indicated a poor size structure most years.  A partial winterkill in 2011 likely reduced Bluegill numbers significantly, allowing surviving fish to grow fast with reduced competition.  Anecdotal reports indicated that anglers started harvesting good numbers of larger sized (7.0 to 7.5 inches in length) Bluegill around 2012 and 2013.  In 2018, size distributions indicated that multiple year classes were present and recruitment was fairly consistent. <br> \n <br> \nSpring night-time electrofishing targeting Largemouth Bass sampled moderate numbers (73) of fish for a catch rate of 36.5/hour.  The 2014 LMP's long range goal (>22.5/hour) was met.  The 2013 electrofishing catch rate was 49.5/hour.  Electrofished Largemouth Bass were 6.1 to 21.7 inches long with an average of 14.0.  Approximately 56% of the electrofishing sample was 14 inches or longer, indicating a quality size structure.  The electrofishing size distribution indicated that multiple age classes were present, but recruitment was not strong every year.   <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled low numbers of Yellow Perch (7) for a catch rate of 1.2/net, which was below the lake's normal range.  The 2013 catch rate was 6.0/net.  Catch rates from 1973 to 2018 (n=10) were variable ranging from 1.2 to 96.2/net with an average of 22.9.  Yellow Perch were 5.4 to 6.0 inches long with an average of 5.7.  Data indicated inconsistent recruitment, possibly due to higher numbers of predatory Northern Pike over the last five years.   <br> \n     <br> \nTrap nets and GN's failed to sample any Common Carp in 2018.  Common Carp were also not sampled in the 2013 TN's or GN's, possibly indicating that they were no longer present in Long Lake or that numbers are at an undetectably low level.  Dead Common Carp were observed following the 2011 winterkill and none were sampled in the subsequent winterkill survey from the spring of that year.  Historic summer TN catch rates (n=11) from 1973 to 2018 were mostly low, ranging from 0.0 to 5.8/net with an average of 1.0.  Historic GN catch rates (n=10) were mostly low, ranging from 0.0 to 5.8/net with an average of 1.3.     <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled low numbers of Black Bullhead (5) for a catch rate of 0.8/net, which was below the lake's normal range.  The 2013 catch rate was even lower at 0.0/net.  Historic GN catch rates from 1973 to 2018 (n=9) were mostly low, ranging from 0.0 to 27.7/net with an average of 9.8.  Gill netted fish were 10.6 to 11.8 inches long with an average of 11.2.  Trap nets failed to sample Black Bullhead in 2018 (0.0/TN), which was the lowest catch rate ever recorded at Long.  The 2013 TN catch rate was 0.7/net.  Historic TN catch rates from 1973 to 2018 were mostly low, ranging from 0.0 to 16.8/net with an average of 2.9.  Size distributions indicated inconsistent recruitment.     <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled high numbers of Yellow Bullhead (239) for a catch rate of 39.8/net which was above the lake's normal range and the highest catch ever measured at Long Lake.  The 2013 GN catch rate was 1.0/net.  Historic GN catch rates from 1984 to 2018 (n=8) were variable ranging from 0.0 to 39.8/net with an average of 6.9.  In 2018, gill netted Yellow Bullhead were 5.4 to 15.1 inches long with an average of 10.3.  Approximately 88% of the GN catch was 9 inches or longer, indicating a quality size structure. <br> \n <br> \nAdditional species sampled in the standard gear included; Bowfin, Brown Bullhead, Golden Shiner, Green Sunfish, and Pumpkinseed Sunfish.   <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A population assessment was conducted at Long Lake in 2008 to monitor the fish population.  A total of 11 different species of fish were sampled, plus hybrid sunfish.  The county park on the south end of the lake offers shore fishing opportunities to bank anglers. <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled 7 walleye for a catch rate of 1.17/net, which was below the normal range for this type of lake.  The 2003 catch rate was 0.2/net.  Walleye were 20.5 to 24.5 inches long averaging 22.4 inches.  Walleye were 8 to 10 years old with 3 year-classes present.  Walleye were last stocked in 1994.  Long is managed as a bass/panfish type of lake.   <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled 5 northern pike for a catch rate of 0.8/net, which was less than the normal range for this type of lake.  The 2003 catch rate was 2.3/net.  Northern pike were 25.4 to 33.1 inches long averaging 29.2 inches.  Northern pike were 3 to 7 years old with 5 year-classes present.  The pike population in 2008 was similar to past assessments, showing low numbers of larger sized fish. <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled 102 yellow perch for a catch rate of 17.0 /net, which was within the normal range for this type of lake.  The 2003 catch rate was 1.2/net.  Yellow perch were 4.5 to 9.2 inches long averaging 5.8 inches.  Only 1 fish was over 6.5 inches in length.  Yellow perch were 3 to 6 years old with 3 year-classes present.  Yellow perch catch rates have been highly variable over the years at Long Lake. <br> \n <br> \nSpring night-time electrofishing sampled 67 largemouth bass for a catch rate of 32.4/hr.  The catch rate in 2003 was 72.9/hr.  Catch rates (n=5) from 1994 to 2008 ranged from 20.6 to 72.9/hr, averaging 50.0/hr.  Largemouth bass were 5.1 to 20.6 inches long averaging 12.1 inches.  Largemouth bass were 1 to 10 years old with 10 year-classes present.  Long Lake continues to be one of the better bass fishing lakes in the Meeker/McLeod County area. <br> \n <br> \nCarp were not sampled in either gill nets or trap nets in 2008. <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled 1 black bullhead for a catch rate of 0.2/net, which was below the normal range for this type of lake.  That fish was 13.6 inches long.  The 2003 catch rate was 1.8/net.  The trap net catch rate was 0.2/net.  Trap nets sampled 19 yellow bullhead, ranging from 9.1 to 13.1 inches in length and averaging 11.3 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nTrap nets sampled 5 black crappie for a catch rate of 0.6/net, which was below the normal range for this type of lake.  The 2003 catch rate was 1.4/net.  Black crappie were 5.7 to 7.8 inches long averaging 7.0 inches.  Gill nets sampled 12 black crappie for a catch rate of 2.0/net.  Gill netted black crappie were 5.6 to 8.1 inches long averaging 6.8 inches.  The 2003 catch rate was 5.3/net.  Black crappie were 2 to 4 years old with 3 year-classes present.  Growth was slow. <br> \n <br> \nTrap nets sampled 1,163 bluegill for a catch rate of 129.2/net, which was above the normal range for this type of lake.  The 2003 catch rate was similar at 132.0/net.  Bluegill were 2.8 to 7.4 inches long averaging 5.0 inches.  Approximately 23% of the trap net sample was 6 inches or longer, but less than 1% of them reached the 7 inch mark.  Bluegill were 2 to 7 years old with 6 year-classes present.  Growth was slow.  On average, it took six years to produce a 6-inch bluegill at Long Lake.   </p>",
