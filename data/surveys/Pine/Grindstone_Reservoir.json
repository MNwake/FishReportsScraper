                "narrative": "<p>  On May 28-29, 1992, a brief population assessment was conducted on the Grindstone Reservoir located in the city of Hinckley.  Six 3/4 inch trapnets were used to evaluate the present fish population status.  Annual assessments are used to determine fish abundance so management plans can be implemented.  Annual stocking of northern pike, bluegill, and black crappie is provided primarily based on the presence of the fishing pier located on the reservoir.\n  The 1992 net catch found ten species present.  The bluegill and black crappie net catches were low.  All other species captured by trapnets were similar to previous survey catches.  Historical net catches indicate low presence of all species.  Factors influencing low numbers by limited to lack of habitat, low dissolved oxygen during winter months, migration up or down stream of the reservoir.\n</p>",

Six 3/4 inch trapnets were set as part of an annual evaluation requested by Richard L. Trombley, Area Fisheries Supervisor.  At that time, there were no indications of the potential occurrence of a winter-kill.  Eleven fish species were recorded in the trapnet catches which had represented various year-classes.  Management plans call for annual stocking of northern pike, bluegill sunfish, and black crappie until a determination of stocking quotas is reevaluated.</p>",
