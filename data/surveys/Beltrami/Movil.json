                "narrative": "<p>Movil Lake is an 853-acre lake with a maximum depth of 50 feet located 10 miles north of Bemidji in Beltrami County, MN.  Movil Lake is accessed via a navigable channel from Big Turtle Lake, located just upstream on the Turtle River chain of lakes.  The DNR public water access for Big Turtle Lake is located on the west side of the lake off of County Road 15.  Movil Lake is managed for Northern Pike, Walleye, Bluegill, Black Crappie, and Largemouth Bass.  A special regulation for Northern Pike consisting of a protected slot limit from 24 to 36 inches with one fish over 36 inches allowed in the daily possession limit of three fish is in effect.   <br> \n <br> \nThe Minnesota Department of Natural Resources has classified Minnesota lakes based on similarities in lake basin (depth, size) and water chemistry (alkalinity, water clarity).  Movil Lake is in lake class 25.  The following discussion makes comparisons between Movil Lake and other class 25 lakes in the state.  Other Bemidji area lakes in this class include Turtle River Lake, Pimushe Lake and Lake Itasca. <br> \n <br> \nThe 2016 Northern Pike catch rate was 8.83/GN.  Northern Pike had an average size of 20.59 inches in length and 2.15 lbs/fish.  About 22% of the sample exceeded 24 inches, within the protected slot restriction.  The largest Northern Pike captured measured 36.89 inches in length. <br> \n <br> \nThe 2016 Walleye catch rate of 3.0/gill net was equal to the median catch rate for similar lakes.  Walleye captured had an average size of 18.70 inches in length and 2.26 lbs/fish.  The largest Walleye captured measured 26.57 inches in length.   <br> \n <br> \nThe 2016 Bluegill catch rate was 22.75/trap net.  Bluegill captured had an average size of 5.58 inches in length and 0.14 lbs/fish. Similar to connected waters the Bluegill population has been steadily increasing and is now providing an excellent fishery on Movil.       <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass were captured, measured and released using electrofishing in mid-June to evaluate the population in Movil Lake.  In just under two hours of effort, 44 bass were captured with lengths from 5.8 to 14.2 inches and an average length of 11.0 inches.  Smallmouth Bass were also observed in low numbers during the assessment but the population is expected to expand in coming years.   <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

Movil Lake can now be accessed from a launch site that was built on the south shore in 2020, as well as via water from Turtle Lake to the north. The new access is located off South Movil Lake Road and offers a paved parking lot, concrete ramp, and four parking spaces. <br> \n <br> \nMovil Lake is managed for Northern Pike, Walleye, Bluegill, Black Crappie, and Largemouth Bass. Special regulations are in effect for sunfish (daily limit of 5 fish) and Northern Pike (check the regulation booklet and/or signs at the public water access for the current regulation).  Statewide regulations apply to all other species.  Walleye fry stocking resumed in 2013 and continues in odd years with approximately 500,000 fry stocked per year. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike were captured at a moderate rate of just under 10 per gill net. Northern Pike had an average length of nearly 22 inches. The pike population did show some improvement in size structure since the 2016 survey, as 27% of the fish exceeded 24 inches in 2021 compared to 20% in 2016. The largest pike captured measured 36 inches. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye fishing remains good with plenty of keeper fish present. Walleye were captured at nearly 4 fish per gill net, which is slightly better than average for lakes of this type. Walleye caught ranged in length from 8 to 25 inches with an average length of 17 inches. Seventy-three percent of Walleye sampled were larger than 14 inches. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill ranged in length from 3 to 9 inches with an average size of 5 inches. Black Crappie ranged in length from 5 inches to 13 inches with an average of 11 inches. <br> \n <br> \nSmallmouth Bass are thriving in Movil and connected waters, ranging in size from 6 to nearly 19 inches with an average length of 15 inches. Largemouth Bass ranged from nearly 8 to over 15 inches with an average length of 13 inches. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A temperature-dissolved oxygen profile was collected in the deepest basin on Movil Lake on August 1, 2023, to evaluate the amount of cold, oxygenated water (i.e., oxythermal habitat) available to Cisco, also known as Tullibee. Based on the profile, the top of the thermocline (i.e., the location in the water column with the sharpest transition from warm to cold water) occurred at approximately 7 feet. Dissolved oxygen decreased to below 3.0 mg/L at 8.9 feet, which was within the thermocline, at the time of sampling. The temperature at which dissolved oxygen decreased to below 3.0 mg/L (i.e., TDO3, a single variable to characterize oxythermal habitat) was 11.3?C (52.3?F). <br> \n <br> \nTDO3 values cooler than 21.5?C indicate that oxythermal conditions are favorable for Cisco. Dissolved oxygen concentrations indicate that suitable oxythermal habitat for Cisco was available across some depths at the time of sampling during the summer of 2023. Data collected in 1998-2016 indicate marginal oxythermal habitat across years, with the least favorable conditions recorded in 2016. When inadequate oxythermal habitat is available, Cisco are squeezed into unfavorable, warmer water conditions and therefore experience higher levels of stress. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Movil Lake is a 923-acre lake with a maximum depth of 50 feet.  The lake is located seven miles north of Bemidji in central Beltrami County.  There is no public access on Movil, however, the public access on Big Turtle Lake serves as an access to these connected waters.  The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different lake classes based on physical and chemical characteristics.  Movil Lake is in lake class 25.  Other lakes in the same lake class include Balm, Beltrami, Big Buzzle, Gilstad, Big Moose, Turtle River and Itasca Lakes.  Typically lakes in this class are deep, have hardwater, are clear and have irregular shaped shorelines.  The DNR manages Movil Lake for walleye, northern pike, black crappie, bluegill and largemouth bass.Movil Lake, along with a number of other lakes in the Turtle River chain, had a 24\" - 36\" protected slot for northern pike implemented on opening day of the fishing season in 2003.  The goal is to reduce abundance of small northern pike and increase the proportion of large northern pike (greater than 24 inches) in the population.  This regulation will be reviewed in 2012 to determine whether to continue, revise or drop this regulation.Northern pike abundance has remained very high over the last four assessments.  That typifies how a population responds to removal of large fish.  It results in increased production of young small fish.  Though pike up to 35 inches were sampled, most were less than 22 inches and the average length and weight were 19.6 inches and 1.7 pounds.  The DNR management goals for pike are to improve the quality and reduce the numbers.  The intent is to shift the size structure to fewer but larger pike.Typically, for small to medium size pike, as well as all sizes of walleye, yellow perch is the primary food fish.  In 2003 yellow perch abundance was the lowest recorded of any survey conducted on the lake.  Perch abundance was still within the normal range of other class 25 lakes.  The diverse size structure ranging from 5 - 11.5 inches, makes them important as a recreational fish for anglers as well as forage for predators.  White sucker and tullibee were also sampled and are available as food especially by larger predators.  These alternative sources of larger prey assure the potential to produce large northern pike.Most anglers are happy with the Movil Lake walleye fishery.  Walleye are produced by natural reproduction within the chain of lakes and from regular stocking in Big Turtle Lake.  There is probable movement of walleye throughout the chain.  In 2003 walleye abundance was down slightly from 1998 findings but was still typical of other class 25 lakes.  With 10 different year classes identified in the sample, there is a wide range of lengths for anglers to catch.  Improvements in northern pike size resulting in fewer small pike could ease competition for young walleye, resulting in better growth and survival.The 2003 bluegill abundance was the highest recorded of any previous survey.  Along with an increase in numbers, the proportion of quality sized bluegill also increased.  In 2003, 19% of the bluegill sampled were greater than seven inches, compared to 10% in 1998, and 13% in 1989.  To improve and protect quality, anglers should use some restraint if large bluegill are really biting.  Release the larger bluegill and keep the smaller ones for eating.  Quality size bluegill have disappeared from many lakes due to excessive harvest by anglers.In 2003 a total of 44 largemouth bass was sampled that ranged in length from 5 - 19 inches.  Though standard assessment nets are not the preferred gear for sampling bass, these numbers suggest a sizable population.  There were six different year classes evident in the sample.  Few black crappie were sampled.  More specialized sampling directed at black crappie needs to be employed in order to determine if this is truly representing population abundance.As with many lakes in the Bemidji area, there has been much development that has likely impacted fish habitat and water quality.  Most of the shoreline on Movil Lake is privately owned and subject to development.  Shoreline areas are critical areas for fish production and water quality.  Overdeveloped shorelines can't support the fish, wildlife and clean water that is associated with natural undeveloped lakes.  The combined effects of all lakeshore owners \"fixing up\" their property can greatly affect a lake's ability to produce fish and protect water quality.  Lakeshore owners can minimize their impact on shoreline and maintain a more natural setting.  For more information on how to accomplish this, contact your nearest Area Fisheries office.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Movil Lake is a 923-acre lake with a maximum depth of 50 feet located in southern Beltrami County.  It is one of several connected lakes commonly referred to as the Turtle River Chain.  There is no public access on Movil Lake, however, boaters can access the lake via a channel from Big Turtle Lake.  The public access on Big Turtle Lake is on the west side of the lake off of county road 15.  <br> \n <br> \nThe Minnesota Department of Natural Resources has classified Minnesota lakes into 43 different lake classes based on physical and chemical characteristics.  Movil Lake is in lake class 25.  Typically lakes in this lake class are deep, have hard water, are clear, and have irregular shaped shorelines.  All fish species typically found in a lake class 25 fish community are found in Movil Lake.   <br> \n <br> \nAnglers have a variety of fish species to angle for.  No stocking of any species occurs in Movil Lake, however, walleye fry stocking that occurs in Big Turtle Lake is probably contributing to the Movil Lake fishery. <br> \n <br> \nMovil Lake is included in a special northern pike regulation consistent for all lakes on the Turtle River chain. The regulation requires anglers to immediately release all pike from 24-36 inches, with only one over 36 inches allowed.  This regulation, implemented in 2003, is intended to improve the quality of pike population and help maintain a more balanced predator population.  A long-term objective of the protected size regulation is to eventually shift the population from a high-density small pike population to a lower density population of larger pike.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike abundance in 2007 is similar to what was found in the 2003 assessment.  In 2007 pike ranged in length from 11 to 30 inches with an average length and weight of 20.5 inches and 1.4 pounds.  There are signs that the regulation is starting to improve the size structure of pike.  In 2007 there are more pike in the 24\" to 36\" protected slot than there were in 2003.  Significant improvement will take some time since so few fish were within the protected size range when the regulation was implemented.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance has declined slightly from 2003 but is within the historical range of previous assessments and comparable to other class 25 lakes.  No walleye stocking occurs in Movil Lake, however, alternate year fry stocking does occur in the connected Big Turtle Lake.  It is likely that emigration of walleye from Big Turtle Lake occurs.   <br> \n <br> \nTen different year-classes were identified in the 2007 walleye sample, with none particularly stronger than any other.  Some year-classes coincided with years when no stocking occurred in Big Turtle Lake indicating successful natural reproduction.   <br> \n <br> \nBluegill abundance declined slightly from 2003 but is still within the historical range of previous assessments and similar to other class 25 lakes.  The number of bluegill greater than seven inches has improved over previous assessments.  In order to maintain this quality, anglers are encouraged to show some voluntary restraint when bluegill are biting well.  By practicing selective harvest, anglers can harvest the smaller more abundant bluegill for eating and release more of the medium to large fish.  This will help maintain balance in the population and increase the opportunity to catch large bluegill in the future. <br> \n   <br> \nA total of 50 largemouth bass were sampled in this assessment that ranged in length from 5.2 to 15.6 inches.  Though standard assessment nets are not the preferred gear for sampling bass, these numbers suggest a sizable population.  There were eight different year-classes in the sample. <br> \n <br> \nOnly 11 black crappie were sampled.  Specialized sampling such as ice out trap netting directed at black crappie would need to be employed in order to obtain a larger sample representative of the entire population. <br> \n <br> \nRock Bass is another member of the sunfish family that is very abundant in Movil Lake.  Rock bass sampled ranged in length from 4 to 11.5 inches and will give anglers a lot of action.   <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch are common but an important species in this fish community.   Perch sampled range in length from 5.2 - 11.5 inches.  Young perch are a primary forage species for the larger predators such as walleye and northern pike, and 12% of the sample are greater than nine inches, sizes generally considered acceptable to anglers. <br> \n <br> \nDevelopment pressure is increasing around the shorelines and within the watersheds on Minnesota lakes.  This degrades water quality and impacts valuable shoreline habitat.  Native shoreline vegetation provides habitat for fish and wildlife, filters harmful nutrients, and protects against shoreline erosion.  Lakeshore owners can minimize their impact on shoreline and maintain a more natural setting while actually decreasing annual maintenance.

                "narrative": "<p>Movil Lake is in fisheries lake class 25 and fish communities and abundances are compared with similar lakes distributed throughout Minnesota.  Class 25 lakes are typically described as deep with clear hard water and having irregular shorelines.  Other Bemidji area lakes in this class include Big Moose, Pimushe, Turtle River, Beltrami, Balm, and Long Lost.  Movil Lake is located about 6 miles north of Bemidji off County Road 15.  Access to the lake is by way of the channel from Big Turtle lake. Primary management is for panfish species (centrarchids) with secondary species listed as walleye and northern pike.    Rock bass are common though their population has declined since the last assessment.  Most other panfish species, including bluegill, black crappie, and pumpkinseed sunfish, are lower in abundance than many similar lakes.    Walleye have not been stocked in Movil Lake since 1990 but migration from Big Turtle Lake (upstream) or Beltrami Lake (downstream) where walleye fry are stocked in alternate years may contribute significantly to the population.  The predominant year class sampled in this assessment originated from natural reproduction in 1996 when no stocking occurred in this chain of lakes.  The 1998 assessment captured walleye at a rate higher than most comparable lakes and at the highest recorded level for Movil Lake.  The average length was 15.4 inches and the largest walleye was 24.2 inches long.  About 30% of the walleye examined had Neascus (black spot).  This parasite is not harmful to humans, but fish should be cooked before eaten.     Northern pike are still common, but abundance is lower than during the 1989 assessment.  The average length is 18.8 inches with the largest pike sampled at 30.6 inches.  Neascus was observed on about 39% of the pike.      Yellow perch are common with an average length of 6.8 inches.  Most are probably not acceptable to anglers due to the small size.  They contribute more to this fish community as a forage fish for large predators than for the angling they provide.  About half the perch examined also had Neascus.    Minnows and tullibee, which are also present, are important forage species for the walleye and northern pike as well.    Bullheads are present, but the population has always been low.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Movil Lake is a 923-acre lake with a maximum depth of 50 feet located 5 miles north of Bemidji in Beltrami County.  Movil Lake is part of a chain of eleven lakes known as the Turtle River chain.  There are a fair number of lake homes surrounding this picturesque lake.  There is no public water access on Movil Lake, so boaters must access from Big Turtle Lake, which is directly upstream and connected by a navigable river channel.  The public access on Big Turtle is located on the west side of the lake off of CSAH 15, and serves as the access point for Little Turtle, Big Turtle, and Movil Lakes, providing  anglers with the opportunity to fish all three lakes in the same outing.  The fish community of Movil Lake consists of northern pike, walleye, panfish (including black crappie), largemouth bass, yellow perch, tullibee, redhorse/sucker and bullhead species.  Movil, along with many of the lakes in the Turtle River chain, is managed with a special regulation for northern pike (24 to 36-inch protected slot limit).  The regulation is intended to increase the average size of northern pike and improve the size structure of the population.  Statewide fishing regulations apply to all other species. <br> \n <br> \nMovil Lake is not stocked with walleye, but benefits from its connectivity with Big Turtle Lake, which is stocked with fry on alternate years and has detectable natural reproduction of walleye.  The 2011 Movil Lake population assessment captured walleye at 2.5/gill net, which is just below the median value for class 25 lakes.  Walleye had an average size of 16.4 inches and 1.6 lbs/fish, with fish up to 27 inches in length present in the sample.  Movil Lake contains good walleye habitat in the form of shoreline points, humps and sharp drop-offs.  Walleye also utilize the extensive aquatic vegetation found in Movil from time to time during summer and early fall. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike were captured at the rate of 9.5 fish/gill net, which is slightly above the upper quartile value for lake class.  The pike population of Movil Lake did show some improvement in size structure since the 2007 population assessment, with the proportion of fish greater than 24 inches in length remaining stable and an increase in the proportion of fish greater than 30 inches in length present in the sample.  Average size was 21 inches and 2.2 lbs/fish, which is above the median value of 2.0 lbs/fish for lake class.  Northern pike up to 38 inches in length were captured in 2011.  Northern pike habitat is excellent in Movil Lake. <br> \n <br> \nPanfish (bluegill, pumpkinseed sunfish, rock bass, and black crappie) are present in Movil Lake.  Average size of bluegill in Movil Lake has historically fluctuated around the median of 0.18 lbs/fish (approximately 6 inches in length).  The size structure of the bluegill population was dominated by smaller fish in the 2011 population assessment, with an average size of 5.7 inches.  Twenty-six percent of the bluegill catch was greater than 7 inches in length in 2011, and these fish should provide some opportunity for anglers to harvest some quality-size fish within the next few years.  The largest bluegill captured in 2011 was just over 9 inches in length.  Black crappie catch rates fell below the first quartile value for lake class in 2011.  A total of 7 black crappie were caught, with 3 year classes of black crappie identified (2008-2010); fish from the 2008 year class were approximately 9 inches in length.  Rock bass are very abundant in Movil Lake, and can provide anglers with a lot of action.  Rock bass are good table fare, although anglers should watch for and remove any yellow grub found in the flesh, which can be fairly common in rock bass.  Movil panfish anglers may want to take advantage of the easy access to Big and Little Turtle Lakes during their trips, as they hold better populations of panfish than Movil Lake at the current time. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch were captured at the rate of 11.7 fish/gill net, which is above the median value of 9.0/gill net for lake class.  A decent proportion of the sample (14%) was greater than 8 inches in length, with fish over 12 inches in length present.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Movil Lake is a 854-acre lake, located 10 miles north of Bemidji, MN. A targeted survey was completed on Movil Lake by Bemidji Area Fisheries staff during late July of 2021 to assess the nearshore fish community and overall health of the lake. <br> \n <br> \nIn this survey, 14 nearshore sites (100-foot) were evenly spaced along the lakeshore to sample a variety of aquatic habitat types and collect a representative sample of the nearshore fish community. Depending on the habitat conditions at each site, backpack electrofishing and shoreline seining were attempted where possible. A total of 12 sites were sampled with a seine, while backpack electrofishing was completed at all 14 sites. A total of 24 species of fish were sampled, which included eight species (Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, Northern Sunfish, Pugnose Shiner, Rock Bass, and Smallmouth Bass) that are intolerant to disturbance or poor water quality. <br> \n <br> \nNearshore fish community data was analyzed with information collected from standard survey completed in 2021 to calculate a Fish-based Index of Biologic Integrity (FIBI) score to measure the biological condition and overall health of Movil Lake. In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and healthy habitat (e.g. Blackchin Shiner, Tullibee (cisco), Least Darter, and Rock Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g. Black Bullhead, Fathead Minnow, and Green Sunfish). The combination of fish species present may identify stressors negatively affecting the lake environment. The FIBI score is composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics to indicate the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. For additional information on FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources website (www.mndnr.gov). <br> \n <br> \nResults from this survey indicate Movil Lake is in exceptional health with a FIBI score well above the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes. In coordination with the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency, data from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Mississippi River (Headwaters) Watershed assessment. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of the nearshore and littoral fish community in Movil Lake was conducted by Fisheries Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program Staff from 8-10 August 2022. Fourteen sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 15-foot or 50-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at all 14 sites with one site sampled from the boat. A 50-foot seine was used to sample ten sites, a 15-foot seine was used at three sites, and soft sediments with abundant vegetation and deep water prevented the use of seines at one sampling site. Nearshore sampling captured 22 native species of fish including eight species that are intolerant of disturbance (Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, Logperch, Northern Sunfish, Rock Bass, and Smallmouth Bass) and zero species that are tolerant of disturbance. <br> \n <br> \nA concurrent summer trap net survey was conducted on 8-10 August 2022 by IBI Program Staff. Twelve trap nets were set along the shoreline that encompassed multiple habitat types. Bluegill comprised a majority of the trap net catch by number and Bluegill, Northern Pike, and Bowfin comprised a majority of the catch by biomass. The number of Bluegill sampled per net was near but above the 50% quartile for similar Lake Class 25 lakes and the average length was 5.1 inches, with 20% over 7 inches. <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore and trap net data were combined with gill net data from an August 2021 survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based IBI (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment. In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g., Blackchin Shiner, Iowa Darter, and Rock Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g., Black Bullhead, Fathead Minnow, and Green Sunfish). The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.  <br> \n <br> \nResults from this survey indicates Movil Lake is in good health as indicated by an exceptionally high FIBI score, well above the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes. These survey results agree with the previous assessment decision for Movil Lake and confirms the exceptional fish community indicated from a 2021 survey. Data from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Mississippi River - Headwaters Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.</p>",
