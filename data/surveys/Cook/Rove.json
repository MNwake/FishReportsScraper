NO WAE FROM THE INTRODUCTORY STOCKINGS IN 1986-1988 WERE COLLECTED; HOWEVER, THERE WAS SOME SURVIVAL OF A SIMILAR INTRODUCTION IN WATAP LAKE, WHICH IS CONNECTED TO ROVE.  IT IS LIKELY THAT SOME WAE WERE PRESENT IN ROVE LAKE.  THERE WAS A DRAMATIC CHANGE IN THE YEP CPUE FROM 1978 TO 1991.  THIS IS PROBABLY A RESULT OF THE WAE INTRODUCTION, SINCE A SIMILAR DROP IN ABUNDANCE WAS OBSERVED IN WATAP LAKE.  YEP ABUNDANCE IS STILL ABOUT AVERAGE FOR LAKES OF THIS ECOLOGICAL CLASS.</p>",
