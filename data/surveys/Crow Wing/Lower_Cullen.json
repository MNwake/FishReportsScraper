There is a good Panfish population, although fish size is fairly small and could indicate some stunting.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lower Cullen is the largest of the three lakes in the \"Cullen lakes chain\" and lowest in the watershed.  The outlet flows to Nisswa Lake and eventually to Gull Lake.  Lower Cullen is just over 500 acres, maximum depth is about 39 feet and about 35% of the lake is shallower than 15 feet deep.  Bottom soils in shallow waters (less than 4 ft. deep) are fairly evenly divided between marl, sand and rubble-boulder (rock at least 3\" in diameter).  A fairly diverse variety of aquatic vegetation is present and grows to a depth of about 15 feet.  Bulrush beds are present along the east and southwest shorelines.  These beds are valuable to the lake because they provide erosion protection to adjacent shorelines and also provide excellent spawning habitat for bass and sunfishes.  The lake is a hardwater lake with low phosphorus fertility.  Water clarity is about average for this area.Largemouth bass, sunfish and black crappies are the species of fish most likely to be sought by anglers in Lower Cullen.  Sunfish and crappies were present in numbers that are average for lakes similar to Lower Cullen.  Bass were poorly sampled in 1993 but have been of average to high abundance in previous nettings, and most likely remain so.  Northern pike numbers were, typically, low in '93, but fish averaged 5.4 lbs. and had fast growth.  Spawning area is lacking in Lower Cullen but is present upstream, in Upper Cullen Lake.  Walleyes were found in average numbers compared to similar lakes.Forage species appeared to be present in adequate numbers in '93.  Tullibees were present in high numbers, compared to similar lakes, and are probably an important food fish for northern pike.  Yellow perch were present in average numbers and are important as food fish for both walleyes and northerns.  Yellow bullheads were also present in average numbers and dogfish (bowfin) were sampled in low numbers for similar type lakes.</p>",

All of the fish were over 15\". <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike numbers were the lowest since 1974 with only 2.2/gill net.  Average size was 24.3\" and 3.3 lbs.  These fish were fast growing and 35% were 24\" or larger. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass were captured in good numbers while spring electrofishing (84.0/hr run-time).  Average length was 12.0\" and 52% were 12\" or larger.  One smallmouth bass was also captured in gill nets. <br> \n <br> \nPanfish were caught in average numbers when compared to similar lakes.  Black crappies averaged 9.8\".  Bluegills averaged on the small side (5.3\") with 23% of the fish measuring 7\" or larger.  They were slow growing. <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species sampled include black bullhead, brown bullhead, green sunfish, hybrid sunfish, pumpkinseed, rock bass, tullibee (cisco), white sucker, yellow bullhead, and yellow perch. <br> \n</p>",

Walleye were nice size with an average length of 19.8\" and 88% of the fish measuring 12\" or larger. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike were caught in typical numbers for this type of lake (4.4/net).  Average length was 25.9\" and 55% of the fish measured 24\" or larger.  If anglers plan on keeping any northern pike, they are encouraged to keep fish under 24\" and release the larger ones to sustain a healthy population. <br> \n <br> \nThe bass population looked good, with a spring electrofishing catch rate of 84.8/hr.  Size was maybe a little small, with an average length of 10.6\" and only 26% of the fish measuring 12\" or larger. <br> \n <br> \nThe panfish numbers were mixed, with black crappie showing average numbers of decent size fish (89% were 8\" or larger) and bluegill numbers being the lowest to date at 9.8/net.  Bluegill size was small with an average size of 5.4\" and only 11% were 7\" or larger. <br> \n</p>",

Lower Cullen is located in the Crow Wing River watershed.  A nearshore survey was conducted to assess the populations of both game and non-game fish species.  Fourteen 100' long sampling stations were evenly spaced around the lakeshore.  Each station was then sampled by backpack electrofishing, and if conditions allowed with a 15' or 50' 1/8th inch seine. <br> \nThe survey took place July 19-22, 2021, with all 14 stations sampled by backpack electrofishing.  The 50' 1/8th inch seine was used at 6 stations and the 15' 1/8th inch seine was used at 5 stations.  Sixteen species were sampled, including six species that are intolerant of habitat disturbance: Banded Killifish, Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, Mottled Sculpin, Rock Bass, and Smallmouth Bass.  This nearshore survey will be used along with the gill net and trap net survey conducted the same week to calculate a Fish-Based Index of Biotic Integrity (FIBI) score.  The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health by the types of fish species present and comparing it to what is expected for this type of lake. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lower Cullen is a 512 acre lake located just north of Nisswa in Crow Wing County.  This is the lowest lake in a three lake chain that eventually drains into the Gull Lake Chain.  A public access is located on the southeast side of the lake.  The lake is heavily developed with 30.5 homes/cabins per mile of shoreline based on 1998 data.  The maximum depth is 39' and about 35% of the lake is 15' deep or less.  Shallow water substrates consist primarily of sand with some gravel and rubble areas as well.  The aquatic plant community is moderately diverse with 27 species present and is critical to maintaining healthy fish populations.  Emergent plants such as hardstem bulrush are somewhat common along the shoreline and are important for shoreline protection, maintaining water quality, and provide essential spawning habitat for bass and panfish species.  Submerged plants provide food and cover needed by fish and other aquatic species.  The 2003 walleye catch was similar to past nettings at 2.0/gill net and below average when compared to similar lakes.  The catch has been considered low in 5 of the 6 nettings since 1974.  Average length and weight increased from 20.3\" and 1.9 lbs in 1998 to 22.5\" and 3.5 lbs in 2003.  These fish tended to be old with 77% being at least age 10.  Northern pike were caught in average numbers in 2003 at 6.3/gill net.  The 2000 and 2001 year classes were the strongest and contributed 65% of the catch.  Average length and weight decreased slightly to 26.1\" and 4.5 lbs in 2003 from 27.7\" and 5.4 lbs in 1998.The largemouth bass catch was average in trap nets and above average in gill nets.  Spring electrofishing resulted in a largemouth bass catch rate of 79/hr with an average length of 11.1\" and 35% measuring at least 12\".  The bluegill catch of 26.3/trap net was typical for this type of lake.  Growth was slow with 5% of bluegills measuring at least 7\".  Black crappies were caught in average numbers and growth was good.  Tullibee and yellow perch are important forage species for the lake's game fish.  Yellow perch were sampled in relatively low numbers in 2003.  The tullibee catch of 8.6/gill net was the lowest catch on this lake to date, but is still considered high when compared to similar lakes.</p>",

Average populations were indicated for northern pike, pumpkinseed, largemouth bass and black crappie. Low populations of bowfin and white sucker were indicated. Northern pike sampled represented ages two thru eight. Ages four and five comprised 65% of the sample. Growth rates were average or a little above average when compared with statewide averages. Length frequency ranged from 20 to 33 inches. The average individual weights of the northern pike are a little over 4 pounds, so most are very nice fish. Bluegill sunfish were very abundant and exhibited very slow growth rates. Age classes 2 and 4 thru 8+ were sampled with 5 and 6 year old fish comprising 50% of the sample. Length frequencies ranged from 3 to 7 inches with 5\" and 6\" fish most abundant. Largemouth bass sampled ranged in age from 1 to 8 with ages 4 and 6 not sampled. The 2 and 3 year old fish comprised 65% of the sample. The 1, 2 and 3 year old fish showed slow growth rates while the 5, 7 and 8 year old fish exhibited average growth rates. Length frequencies ranged from 5 to 17 inches. The 7 inch group comprised 35% of the sample. Black crappies sampled showed average growth rates and age groups 3 to 8 present. Length frequencies from 6 to 11 1/2 inches were present. The 10 and 11 inch length group comprised 53% of the sample. Yellow perch exhibited a high catch rate when compared to the area median. Ages ranged from 4 to 8+, with 4, 5 and 6 year olds. The most abundant length frequencies ranged from 6 to 8 1/2 inches with 91% 6 and 7 inch fish. Walleyes also showed a high catch rate when compared to the area median. Fifty percent of the sample was 8 years old or older, with the balance of the sample equally distributed among the 4 to 7 year old fish. Length frequencies ranged from 9 to 29 inches, with the 20 and 22 inch fish comprising 40% of the sample. Individual weights showed a 3 pound average for the walleyes. Northern cisco also exhibited a high population. Length frequencies ranged from 7 to 14 inches, with the 8 inch group comprising 40% of the sample. The populations in Lower Cullen Lake of all species sampled have changed very little from the 1983 survey, with the exception of the walleye which has increased from 3.0/lift in 1983 to 10.0/lift in 1988.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lower Cullen is a 512 acre lake located at Nisswa, in Crow Wing County.  The lake is highly developed, with 30.3 homes/cabins per shoreline mile. Three resorts are present on the lake, as well.  A public access is located on the west shore.The lake has a maximum depth of 39 feet and about 35% of the surface area is less than 15 feet deep.  Lower Cullen is a hardwater lake with low phosphorus fertility.  Water clarity was above average for the area in 1998.Test netting was conducted in 1998.  When compared to similar type lakes, the walleye catch was in the \"low\" category.  However, the catch was similar to that in four of the six nettings conducted to date.  Three age classes were present among the six walleyes caught.  Only one fish aged to a year when stocking was done.  Similar results were noted in analysis of previous nettings.  Northern pike abundance was in the \"average\" category when compared to similar type lakes.  It was near the previous high catch for the lake.  Several age classes were present in fairly uniform abundance and growth was above average.  Size averaged 27 inches and 5.4 lbs., similar to results from the past two nettings.  Largemouth bass were present in \"high\" numbers but only younger aged fish were sampled.  Smallmouth bass were sampled for the first time in the lake, as young fish.  Black crappie numbers were in the \"high\" category.  Several year classes were present, in fairly uniform numbers, and growth was good.  Bluegill numbers were near historical lows for the lake, but remained near the cutoff for \"high\" catches when compared with similar type lakes.  Most bluegills were from strong 1994-'95 year classes and had good growth.  Only about 4% of the fish were 7.0 inches or more in length.  Yellow perch and tullibees are the most important forage fish for the lake's gamefish.  Perch were found in \"average\" numbers and most were from a strong 1994 year class.  Tullibees were present in \"high\" numbers, as they have been in each of the six nettings conducted to date.</p>",
