HOWEVER, THE YIELD PER GILLNET DECREASED FROM 10.8 LBS./GILLNET IN 1989 TO 9.1 LBS./GILLNET IN 1990.  THESE FINDINGS ARE THE RESULT OF THE PREDOMINANCE OF YOUNGER FISH IN THE 1990 CATCH. THE 1989 YEAR CLASS REPRESENTED 30% OF THE TOTAL CATCH, AND THE 1988 AND 1987 YEAR-CLASSES WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR 15 AND 16.5% OF THE TOTAL CATCH, RESPECTIVELY.  THE COHORTS FROM THE YEARS 1983- 1986 WERE REPRESENTED IN APPROXIMATELY EQUAL NUMBERS.  WAE GROWTH WAS LOWER IN 1990 THAN IN THE PREVIOUS YEAR.  NOP INDEX OF ABUNDANCE DECLINED SLIGHTLY FROM 1.67 FISH/GILLNET IN 1989 TO 1.27 FISH/GILLNET IN 1990.  THE INDEX OF ABUNDANCE OF CISCO, WTS, BLB, SHR, RKB, SMB, BLC AND YEP INCREASED FROM 1989, WHILE THAT OF LAKE WHITEFISH, BLG AND SAR DECREASED SLIGHTLY.

Experimental regulations designed to improve age and size structure were implemented in 1998.  The regulation restricts walleye harvest to lengths from 13 to 17 inches with one fish allowed over 23 inches.     Walleye abundance in the 1998 investigation was high, due in part to strong 1994 and 1996 year classes.  Average length was 12.6 inches with fish up to 27.2 inches present.  Growth rate was slow.  Sauger number, although low, were similar to historic catches.  Average length was 11.4 inches with a slow growth rate.  Yellow perch numbers were consistent with historic catches and within the normal range expected for this type of lake.  Average length was 6.2 inches indicating their importance as forage along with the numerous tullibees.     Northern pike abundance was low although it was typical for this type of lake.  Growth rate was faster than normal with an average length of 24.0 inches and a range of 18 to 29 inches.  Smallmouth bass, rock bass, bluegill and black crappie were also sampled in 1998.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Sand Point Lake lies within Voyageurs National Park and is part of the Namakan Reservoir.  Assessment netting is done annually to investigate the fish community.  Experimental regulations, establishing a walleye harvest slot of 13 to 17 inches with one walleye over 23 inches, became effective in March 1998.     Walleye abundance in the 1999 investigation remained high, due in part to strong 1994, 1996, and 1998 year classes.  Average length increased to 14.4 inches with fish over 25 inches present.  Growth rate was slow compared to state averages but was similar to other large natural walleye lakes in the International Falls area.  Sauger number, although low, were similar to historic catches.  Average length was 11.1 inches with a slow growth rate.  Yellow perch numbers declined although were within the normal range expected for this type of lake.  Average length was 6.5 inches indicating their importance as forage along with the numerous tullibees.     Northern pike abundance was above levels normally seen in  this type of lake.  Growth rate was faster than normal with an average length of 25.4 inches and a range of 19 to 41.5 inches.  Smallmouth bass, rock bass, bluegill, lake sturgeon, lake whitefish, black crappie, white sucker, redhorse, and silver lamprey were also sampled in 1999 albeit at low numbers.</p>",

There is no road access to several of the lakes.  Thus, anglers gain access by traveling by boat from road access points located on Crane or Kabetogama lakes.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie fishing has become more popular recently on Sand Point Lake and connected waters.  Abundance in the most recent survey was well above the majority of lakes that are similar, as has been the case for many years.  So, fishing should remain similar to past years.  Four year-classes were present and age ranged from 1-4 years.  Total length ranged from 3.6-10.6 inches and average was 5.5.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike gill-net abundance was above what is found in most lakes that are similar.  Anglers have a chance to catch large pike in Sand Point Lake, our sample found fish up to 35.0 inches in 2011.     <br> \n <br> \nSauger are present but generally rare and sizes are small.  The average size sampled in 2011 was 10.2 inches and the average weight for all sauger sampled was 0.30 pounds.   <br> \n <br> \nSmallmouth bass is another choice for anglers visiting Sand Point Lake.  Abundance in 2011 according to our netting results was much lower than the expected range for this lake type.  However, creel surveys show that anglers are successful on Sand Point Lake and trophy-sized fish are out there.   <br> \n <br> \nFor many years the walleye population has consistently been at the top of the expected range for this lake type and 2011 was no exception; in fact, 2011 was the second highest walleye abundance ever recorded for Sand Point Lake.  All five of the highest abundance levels ever recorded have occurred after a size regulation was implemented in 1998 to enhance the walleye population.  In the 2011 sample, 19 year-classes were present and age ranged from 1-21 years, which provides for a wide range of available sizes for anglers to catch.  Total length in the sample ranged from 7.6-26.4 inches and the average was 14.0.   <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch are present but abundance was low and sizes were small.  Yellow perch are likely more important as forage for predators rather than recreational fish for anglers.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Sand Point Lake is located on the border between Minnesota and the Province of Ontario and is part of the Namakan Reservoir, which also consists of Crane, Kabetogama, Little Vermilion, and Namakan lakes.  There is no road access to several of the lakes.  Thus, anglers gain access by traveling by boat from road access points located on Crane or Kabetogama lakes.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie fishing has become more popular recently on Sand Point Lake and connected waters.  Abundance in the most recent survey was slightly above the expected range for this lake type, as has been the case for many years.  So, fishing should remain similar to past years.  Three year-classes were present in the sample and age ranged from 1-4 years.  Fish up to 11.3 inches were sampled in 2013.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike gill-net abundance was above the expected range for this lake type.  Anglers have a chance to catch large pike in Sand Point Lake, our sample found fish up to 36.3 inches in 2013, but samples typically include Northern Pike over 40 inches.     <br> \n <br> \nSauger are present but generally rare and sizes are small.  The average size sampled in 2013 was 10.2 inches and the average weight for all Sauger sampled was 0.28 pounds.   <br> \n <br> \nSmallmouth Bass is another choice for anglers visiting Sand Point Lake.  Abundance in 2013 according to our netting results was slightly above the expected range for this lake type.  Angler creel surveys show that anglers are successful on Sand Point Lake and trophy-sized fish are out there.   <br> \n <br> \nFor many years the Walleye population has consistently been at the top of the expected range for this lake type.   All eight of the highest abundance levels ever recorded have occurred after a size regulation was implemented in 1998 to enhance the Walleye population.  However, abundance in 2013 was within the normal range for Sand Point Lake.  Fifteen year-classes were present and age ranged from 1-17 years, which provides for a wide range of available sizes for anglers to catch.  The 2011 year-class looked promising and should provide good fishing in the immediate future.  Total length in the sample ranged from 6.7-25.4 inches and the average weight was about one pound.   <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch are present but abundance was low and sizes were small.  Yellow Perch are likely more important as forage for predators rather than recreational fish for anglers.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Sand Point Lake is located on the border between Minnesota and the Province of Ontario and is part of the Namakan Reservoir, which also consists of Crane, Kabetogama, Little Vermilion, and Namakan lakes.  There is no road access to several of the lakes.  Thus, anglers gain access by traveling by boat from road access points located on Crane or Kabetogama lakes.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie fishing has become more popular recently on Sand Point Lake and connected waters.  Abundance in the most recent survey was slightly above the expected range for this lake type, as has been the case for many years.  So, fishing should remain similar to past years.  Several size-classes were present in the sample and fish up to 11.6 inches were sampled in 2015.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike abundance was well above the top of the expected range for this lake type.  Anglers have a chance to catch very large pike in Sand Point Lake; our samples commonly include fish over 40 inches.     <br> \n <br> \nSauger are present but generally rare and sizes are small.  The average size sampled in 2015 was 9.6 inches and the average weight for all Sauger sampled was 0.25 pounds.   <br> \n <br> \nSmallmouth Bass is another choice for anglers visiting Sand Point Lake.  Although abundance in 2015 according to our netting results was below the expected range for this lake type, angler creel surveys show that anglers catch good numbers on Sand Point Lake and trophy-sized fish are out there.   <br> \n <br> \nFor many years the Walleye population has consistently been at the top of the expected range for this lake type.   All eight of the highest abundance levels ever recorded have occurred after a size regulation was implemented in 1998 to enhance the Walleye population.  Abundance in 2015 was at the high end of the normal range for Sand Point Lake.  Fifteen year-classes were present and age ranged from 0-20 years, which provides for a wide range of available sizes for anglers to catch.  Many year-classes looked promising and should provide good fishing in the immediate future.  Total length in the sample ranged from 7.5-24.5 inches and the average weight was almost one pound.   <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch are present but abundance was low and sizes were small.  Yellow Perch are likely more important as forage for predators rather than recreational fish for anglers.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Sand Point Lake is located on the border between Minnesota and the Province of Ontario and is part of the Namakan Reservoir, which also consists of Crane, Kabetogama, Little Vermilion, and Namakan lakes.  There is no road access to several of the lakes.  Thus, anglers gain access by traveling by boat from road access points located on Crane or Kabetogama lakes.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie fishing has become more popular recently on Sand Point Lake and connected waters.  Abundance in the most recent survey was above the expected range for this lake type, as has been the case for many years.  So, fishing should remain similar to past years.  Several size-classes were present in the sample and fish up to 12.4 inches were sampled in 2017.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike abundance was above the top of the expected range for this lake type.  Anglers have a chance to catch very large pike in Sand Point Lake; our samples commonly include fish over 40 inches.     <br> \n <br> \nSauger are present but generally rare and sizes are small.  The average size sampled in 2017 was 10.1 inches and the average weight was 0.27 pounds.   <br> \n <br> \nSmallmouth Bass is another choice for anglers visiting Sand Point Lake.  Abundance in 2017 according to our netting results was within the expected range for this lake type.  Also, angler creel surveys show that anglers catch good numbers on Sand Point Lake and trophy-sized fish are out there.   <br> \n <br> \nFor many years the Walleye population has consistently been at the top of the expected range for this lake type.   All nine of the highest abundance levels ever recorded have occurred after a size regulation was implemented in 1998 to enhance the Walleye population.  Abundance in 2017, was again near the top of the normal range for this lake type.  Thirteen year-classes were present and age ranged from 1-13 years, which provides for a wide range of available sizes for anglers to catch.  Several year-classes looked promising and should provide good fishing in the immediate future.  Total length in the sample ranged from 7.1-26.4 inches and the average weight was 1.3 pounds.   <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch were sampled but abundance was low and sizes were small.  Yellow Perch are likely more important as forage for predators rather than recreational fish for anglers.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Sand Point Lake is located within Voyageurs National Park, approximately 5 miles north of Crane Lake, Minnesota on the International border between Minnesota and Ontario. Sand Point is a Class 2, mesotrophic lake with a total surface area of 8,526 acres, of which 4,848 acres (57%) are in Minnesota. Its waters are soft, and aquatic vegetation is sparse, except in the shallow bays. Sand Point Lake has a maximum depth of 184 feet, although almost one third (32%) of the lake is less than 15 feet deep. The mean summer transparency (Secchi) is 7.2 feet. Sand Point Lake is usually stratified from late May to late October of each year. Shoal water substrates are dominated by boulder, ledge rock, rubble, sand, and muck. Sand Point is part of the Namakan Reservoir, which also consists of Crane, Kabetogama, Little Vermilion, and Namakan lakes. Sand Point Lake has been sampled annually with fall gill nets since 1983. <br> \n <br> \nCurrent fishing regulations on Sand Point Lake follow the boarder waters (Canada-Minnesota) regulations. For Walleye and Sauger, the limit is six (not more than four can be Walleye), Walleye from 18\"-26\" must be immediately released, and only one Walleye over 26\" allowed in possession limit.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye gill-net catch rate was 9.7 fish per net which was above average for similar lakes. The catch rate is above the management goal of 6.3 fish per net for Sand Point Lake. Total length ranged from 7.5 to 26.7 inches and mean length was 13.9 inches. Mean weight was 1.1 pounds which was average for similar lakes. A total of 15 year classes were present and ages ranged from 1 to 17 years. Overall, there are good numbers of Walleye in Sand Point Lake, with the chance to catch Walleye over 26 inches. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike gill-net catch rate was 3.9 fish per net which was well above average for similar lakes. The catch rate is above the management goal of 1.6 fish per net for Sand Point Lake. Total length ranged from 18.9 to 28.9 inches and the mean length was 23.8 inches. The mean weight was 2.8 pounds which was below average for similar lakes. A total of six year classes were present, and ages ranged from 2 to 8. <br> \n <br> \nSauger gill-net catch rate was 0.7 fish per net which was below average for similar lakes. Total length ranged from 8.9 to 13.4 inches and the mean length was 10.5 inches. Mean weight was 0.3 pounds which was well below average for similar class lakes. A total of four year-classes were present, and ages ranged from 1 to 6. The 2015 year class was strong compared to recent years. Sauger provide additional harvest opportunities for anglers.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch gill-net catch rate was 2.5 fish per net which was below average for similar lakes. Total length ranged from 5.5 to 9.6 inches and the mean length was 6.7 inches. The mean weight of 0.1 pounds was below average for similar lakes. A total of five year-classes were present in the sample and ages ranged from 2 to 6 years. Yellow Perch offer an additional fishing opportunity and forage for Walleye and Northern Pike.  <br> \n <br> \nTullibee (Cisco) gill-net catch rate was 8.2 fish per net. Total length ranged from 6.1 to 18.1 inches, and the mean length was 11.2 inches. The mean weight was 0.6 pounds. Tullibee (Cisco) offer an additional fishing opportunity as well as forage for Walleye and Northern Pike. <br> \n</p>",

WALLEYE CPUE WAS UP 4% FROM 1986. OTHER SPECIES UP FROM 1986 INCLUDE: YELLOW PERCH, 19%; BLACK CRAPPIE, 71% WHITE SUCKER, 43%. MOST SPECIES WERE DOWN IN CPUE FROM 1986; NORTHERN PIKE, 42% ROCK BASS, 10% SMALLMOUTH BASS, 108%; SAUGER, 10%; AND CISCO, 147%. OF MAJOR CONCERN IS THE INDEX OF ABUNDANCE FOR NORTHERN PIKE WHICH HAS BEEN REFLECTING A GENERAL DECLINE IN THE POPULATION IN THIS DECADE. IF A CAUSE-AND-EFFECT RELATIONSHIP EXISTS, IT WOULD APPEAR THAT THE WALLEYE POPULATION IS INCREASING FROM AN INCREASE IN THE FORAGE BASE (YELLOW PERCH) DUE TO THE PERCEIVED NORTHERN PIKE DECLINE. GROWTH RATES FOR WALLEYE, HOWEVER, HAVE DECLINED FROM 1986. SUMMER BIWEEKLY SEINING INDICATED 1985 WAS A GOOD YEAR FOR WALLEYE REPRODUCTION (BASED ON ANNUAL MEAN CATCH/HAUL VALUES); THIS YEAR CLASS APPEARS TO BE CONTRIBUTING TO THE FISHERY (2 YEAR OLDS REPRE- SENTED 24.1% OF THE POPULATION SAMPLED BY GILL- NETS THIS YEAR).</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Sand Point Lake is part of the Namakan Resevoir that includes Kabetogama, Namakan, Sand Point, Crane, and Little Vermilion lakes.  Population assessments are conducted annually on Kabetogama, Namakan, and Sand Point lakes.The most abundant game species sampled was walleye, with gill nets catches of 9.0/net.  This was a normal walleye catch rate for this type of lake.  Most of the fish were young, from age 1 to 3.  The 1994 year class (age 3) was especially strong, and should contribute harvestable fish for the next two years.  Growth rates were fairly normal, and the average size of walleye in 1997 was 13.2\".  Sauger catch rate in Sand Point Lake was below normal for this lake type, at 1.1/set, and growth rates wre slow.  The average length of sauger in the gill nets was 10.9\", and is prabably an overestimate since the sauger are too small to be reliably caught until they are age 3.Northern pike catch rates were typical at 1.5/set.  Growth rates were good and most of the pike were large enough to keep for most anglers with an average length of almost 25\".  Northern pike in Sand Point Lake have historically been fairly large.Tullibee were very common.  Tullibee and perch likely contribute the most to the prey base for the lakes walleye and pike.  Other gamefish collected included smallmouth bass, black crappie, bluegill, and lake sturgeon.  Bullhead, burbot, redhorse, and white suckers were also collected.    </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Sand Point Lake is a 8,869 acre, class 2 lake, located along the border between Minnesota and the Province of Ontario.  The Minnesota portion (5,179 acres) is located in Voyageurs National Park.  Sand Point Lake is part of the Namakan Reservoir, which also consists of Crane, Kabetogama, Little Vermilion, and Namakan lakes.  There is no road access on the Minnesota portion of the lake.  Thus, anglers gain access by traveling by boat from road access points located on Crane or Kabetogama lakes.       Black crappie gill-net abundance was more than three times greater than the median for similar lakes (class 2).  Age ranged from 1-8 years and total length (TL) ranged from 4.3-12.0 inches.      Northern pike gill-net abundance was 2.73 fish/set, which was above what is found in more than 75% of the class 2 lakes.  Six year-classes were present and age ranged from 2-8 years, with age 3 fish representing 44% of the sample.  Total length ranged from 17.1-39.2 inches.  Growth rate was above the statewide and area means.       Walleye gill-net abundance was 7.87 fish/set, which was above what is found in most class 2 lakes.  Fourteen year-classes were present and age ranged from 0-22 years.  Total length ranged from 4.3-26.3 inches and the average was 14.4.  Growth was well below the area and statewide averages.  Average weight was nearly equal to the third quartile for class 2 lakes.       Yellow perch gill-net abundance was 4.33 fish/set, which was the highest recorded in the past few years and near the median of 4.53 fish/set for class 2 lakes.  Five year-classes were present and age ranged from 2-6 years.  However, ages 2 and 3 represented most of the sample (89%).  Total length ranged from 5.3-8.9 inches and the average was 6.2.  Growth was lower than the area and statewide averages.   </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Sand Point Lake is a 8,869 acre, softwater lake, located along the border between Minnesota and the Province of Ontario. Sand Point Lake has a rocky irregular shoreline and tannin stained water typical of Canadian Shield type lakes.  The Minnesota portion (5,179 acres) is located within the boundaries of Voyageurs National Park. Sand Point Lake is part of the Namakan Reservoir, which also includes Crane, Kabetogama, Namakan and Little Vermilion lakes. There is no road access on the Minnesota portion of the lake. Thus, most anglers gain access by traveling by boat or snowmobile from road access points located on Crane or Kabetogama Lakes.Thirteen species were present in the 2005 fall assessment gill netting on Sand Point Lake.  Other than cisco, walleye was the most common species in the catch making up 28% of the total by number. Walleye also accounted for the highest total weight in the catch followed by northern pike.Walleye abundance in Sand Point Lake in 2005 (8.13/net) was similar to the year before (7.87/net) and higher than the lake class median (6.32/net). Gill-net abundance in Sand Point Lake has increased annually since 2002.  The gill-net abundance of walleye over 17 inches in length (2.27/net) exceeded the lake's historical average.  The average weight of walleye sampled during this investigation was exceptional (1.34 lbs.) ranking in the upper 25th percentile of all lakes in the same classification. Walleye growth for Sand Point Lake was among the slowest in the International Falls Area.Fifteen year-classes were present in the walleye catch and ages ranged from 0-21 years. Most walleye were from the 2001 year-class (25% of captured walleye) and the 2004 year-class (22% of captured walleye).  Fewer age-2 (2003 year-class) and age-3 (2002 year-class) walleye were captured than is normal for these age-groups.  All walleye from the strong 1996 year-class were within the protected slot length limit and are now protected by regulation.  Northern pike abundance (1.73/net) exceeded the median of 1.62/net for lakes of this classification.  Gill-net abundance of pike has increased since 1990 on Sand Point Lake.  The average weight of pike sampled during this investigation was exceptional (4.7 pounds per fish). Lengths of northern pike ranged from 19.3 to 35.4 inches with an average of 26.6 inches.  Growth of Sand Point Lake northern pike exceeded the Area median.  Age-4 northern pike were the most common age-group present in the pike catch contributing 46% to the total.Black crappie abundance (1.53/net) in Sand Point Lake in 2005 was high.  Crappie gill-net abundance has increased since standardized assessments began in 1983.   Black crappie captured during the gill-net assessment ranged in length from 4.6 to 10.9 inches with an average of 7.3 inches.  Crappie growth was below the Area median.Other species present in the gill-net catch included black bullhead, burbot, lake whitefish, rainbow smelt, rock bass, smallmouth bass, cisco, white sucker and yellow perch.   </p>",

There is no road access to several of the lakes.  Thus, anglers gain access by traveling by boat from road access points located on Crane or Kabetogama lakes.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie fishing has, at times, been popular on Sand Point Lake and connected waters.  Abundance in the most recent survey was within the expected range for this lake type, but slightly below levels seen in recent years.  In 2018, several size-classes were present and fish up to 9.3 inches were sampled.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike abundance was above the top of the expected range for this lake type.  Anglers have a chance to catch very large pike in Sand Point Lake; our samples often include fish over 40 inches.     <br> \n <br> \nSauger are present but generally rare and sizes are small.  The average size sampled in 2018 was 9.3 inches and the average weight was 0.22 pounds.   <br> \n <br> \nSmallmouth Bass is another choice for anglers visiting Sand Point Lake.  Abundance according to our netting results was just above the expected range for this lake type in 2018.  Also, angler creel surveys show that anglers catch good numbers on Sand Point Lake and trophy-sized fish are out there.   <br> \n <br> \nFor many years the Walleye population has consistently been at the top of the expected range for this lake type.   All nine of the highest abundance levels ever recorded have occurred after a size regulation was implemented in 1998 to enhance the Walleye population.  Abundance in 2018, was again near the top of the normal range for this lake type.  Fourteen year-classes were present and age ranged from 0-19 years, which provides for a wide range of available sizes for anglers to catch.  Several year-classes looked promising and should provide good fishing in the immediate future.  Total length in the sample ranged from 4.3-26.4 inches and the average weight was one pound.   <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch were sampled but abundance was low and sizes were small.  Yellow Perch are likely more important as forage for predators rather than recreational fish for anglers.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Introduction <br> \nThis investigation was designed to document the population characteristics of Lake Whitefish (Coregonus clupeaformis) found in Namakan and Sand Point Lakes, Minnesota. Changes in water level management first enacted by the International Joint Commission (IJC) in 2000 were expected to be beneficial to Lake Whitefish in the Namakan Reservoir. Lake Whitefish spawn in shallow water during October and November with eggs hatching early in the following spring. Whitefish eggs, therefore, are susceptible to desiccation during winters with significant water level drawdown.   <br> \n <br> \nThis investigation used the Fish Community Index Netting (FCIN) protocol developed by the Province of Ontario (LNFAU 2001) to collect long-term population characteristics of Lake Whitefish in Namakan and Sand Point Lakes. FCIN is carried out on a two out of four year rotation. The 2021 sampling season represents the first of two surveys in the current four year rotation on the Namakan Reservoir.  <br> \nMethods <br> \n <br> \nNine FCIN nets were set from August 15th through August 18rd, 2021 on Namakan Lake. Three additional sets were made on Sand Point Lake on August 18th and lifted on August 19th. Sets were approximately 24-hours in duration. Gill nets used were eight feet tall and consisted of nine 50-foot panels of various mesh gill net (1.0, 2.25, 0.75, 1.5, 2.5, 1.75, 0.5, 2.0, and 1.25 inch bar measure). Net locations were selected to sample two depth strata (50'-90' and greater than 90'). Six nets were set in the shallow-water stratum and three were set in the deep-water stratum of Namakan Lake, and two were set in the shallow-water stratum and one in the deep-water stratum of Sand Point Lake (Figure 1). Net location and orientation was chosen randomly within strata across the entire lake. However, nets could not be within 330 feet of shore or exposed shoals.  <br> \n <br> \nAll fish captured in each net were separated by species and capture mesh. Total length, weight, sex, and state of maturity were recorded for all Lake Whitefish captured. Otoliths were collected from Lake Whitefish for aging.  <br> \n <br> \nFive metrics were incorporated to track long-term trends in the Lake Whitefish population (LNFAU 2001). <br> \n1)\tMean age of first maturity <br> \n2)\tMean age of FCIN catch <br> \n3)\tRelative abundance (Catch per unit effort (CPUE)) <br> \n4)\tRecruitment/ juvenile abundance (CPUE of age 3, 4 and 5) <br> \n5)\tSpatial distribution of FCIN catch <br> \n <br> \nResults and Discussion <br> \n <br> \nSeven species totaling 457 individual fish were caught in the 2021 summer FCIN assessment (Table 1). Cisco species were the most common fish by number and weight, making up 72.4 percent of the total catch by number and 31.9 percent of the catch by weight. Walleyes and Lake Whitefish made up the next largest portion of the total weight at 22.3 and 18.0 percent of the catch, respectively. Twenty-eight Lake Whitefish were sampled for a catch rate of 2.3 per lift. A total of 331 Cisco (27.6 per net), 40 Burbot (3.3 per net), 35 Walleyes (2.9 per net), 12 Sauger (1.0 per net), nine White Suckers (0.8 per net), and two Northern Pike (0.3 per net) were caught during the 2021 FCIN survey.  <br> \n <br> \nLake Whitefish ranged in length from 9.8 to 21.7 inches, with a mean of 16.3 (Table 2). The mean weight was 1.7 pounds. Twelve age-classes were represented in the 2021 catch with the age 7 year-class composing 25.0 percent of the total catch while the age 2 and age 5 year-classes each made up an additional 14.3 percent of the total catch (Table 3).  <br> \n <br> \nFive metrics for evaluating the Lake Whitefish population were calculated. The age of 50% maturity (females) was 10.6 years. The mean age of Lake Whitefish in the FCIN catch was 6.8 years. Recruitment criteria showed that the juvenile abundance (CPUE of age 3, 4, 5) of Lake Whitefish was 0.5 per net, although there were five additional juvenile fish caught that were less than age 3 (4 age-2 and 1 age-1). Lake Whitefish were sampled at 10 of 12 stations (Figure 2). <br> \n <br> \nFCIN sampling from recent years suggest the Lake Whitefish population is relatively stable. Sampling was carried out in a two of four year rotation resulting in 10 years of sampling between 2004 and 2021. Lake Whitefish catch rates have fluctuated between 1.33 per net and 4.60 per net and averaged 3.0 per net. There is no longer a commercial fishery for Lake Whitefish on the Minnesota side of the Namakan Reservoir and recreational harvest is likely low. There were several age classes of Lake Whitefish present in the 2021 catch with individuals up to 16 years old along with several juvenile fish. Consistent catch rates of juvenile Lake Whitefish suggest good reproduction and recruitment. Monitoring of the Lake Whitefish population for signs of stress should continue.      <br> \n <br> \nReferences <br> \nLNFAU, 1999.

Many large fish were sampled (up to 30\"), and the average length was 14.9\", with an average weight of 1.5 pounds.  Walleye ages 1 through 12, 15 and 16 were sampled; all a result of natural reproduction.     Northern pike abundance as sampled by test nets is comparable to what is typically observed on similar lakes, but is still a low density population.  However, the northern pike in Sand Point lake are large and fast growing, with an average length of 26.5\" and average weight of 5.0 pounds for those sampled.     Sauger abundance as measured by test nets is lower than comparable lakes in the area, which is consistent with past investigations on Sand Point Lake.     </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Sand Point Lake is located on the border between Minnesota and the Province of Ontario and is part of the Namakan Reservoir, which also consists of Crane, Kabetogama, Little Vermilion, and Namakan lakes.  There is no road access to several of the lakes.  Thus, anglers gain access by traveling by boat from road access points located on Crane or Kabetogama lakes.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie fishing has become more popular recently on Sand Point Lake and connected waters.  Abundance in the most recent survey was well above the majority of lakes that are similar, as has been the case for many years.  So, fishing should remain similar to past years.  Three year-classes were present and age ranged from 2-4 years.  Total length ranged from 5.9-9.8 inches and average was 7.7.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike gill-net abundance was above what is found in most lakes that are similar and size was outstanding.  Anglers have a chance to catch very large pike in Sand Point Lake, our sample found fish up to 38.4 inches in 2009.     <br> \n <br> \nSauger are present but generally rare and sizes are small.  The largest sampled in 2009 was 11.1 inches and the average weight for all sauger sampled was 0.23 pounds.   <br> \n <br> \nFor many years the walleye population has consistently been at the top of the expected range for this lake type and 2009 was no exception, abundance was similar to the long-term average.  Seventeen year-classes were present and age ranged from 1-18 years, which provides for a wide range of available sizes for anglers to catch.  Total length in the sample ranged from 6.8-26.3 inches and the average was 14.2.   <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch are present but abundance was low and sizes were small.  Yellow perch are likely more important as forage for predators rather than recreational fish for anglers.</p>",

The Minnesota portion (5,179 acres) is located in Voyageurs National Park.  Sand Point Lake is part of the Namakan Reservoir, which also consists of Crane, Kabetogama, Little Vermilion, and Namakan lakes.  There is no road access on the Minnesota portion of the lake.  Thus, anglers gain access by traveling by boat from road access points located on Crane or Kabetogama lakes.       Black crappie gill-net abundance was more than four times greater than the median for similar lakes (class 2).  Length ranged from 4.3-11.5 inches with an average of 8.0 inches.      Northern pike gill-net abundance was 2.53 fish/set, which was above what is found in more than 75% of the class 2 lakes.  Growth rate and average weight was above average.  Six year-classes were present and age ranged from 2-7 years, with ages 4 and 5 representing 60% of the sample.  Total length ranged from 20.0-37.0 inches.       Walleye gill-net abundance was 7.40 fish/set, which was above the median of 6.32 for class 2 lakes.  Twelve year-classes were present and age ranged from 1-14 years.  Total length ranged from 7.4-25.2 inches and the mean was 14.3.  Growth was well below the area and statewide averages.         Yellow perch gill-net abundance was 1.53 fish/set, which was below what is found in most class 2 lakes.  Five year-classes were present and age ranged from 2-7 years.  Total length ranged from 5.0-10.1 inches and the mean was 6.4.  Growth was below the area and statewide averages.   </p>",

There is no road access to several of the lakes.  Thus, anglers gain access by traveling by boat from road access points located on Crane or Kabetogama lakes.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie gill-net abundance was 1.60 fish/set, which was well above what is typically observed in similar lakes.  Five year-classes were present and age ranged from 1-7 years, with many young fish present.  Total length ranged from 4.0-12.4 inches and mean was 6.9.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike gill-net abundance was 3.07 fish/set, which was almost twice as high as the median for similar lakes.  Seven year-classes were present and age ranged from 1-7 years, with age-3 fish representing 44% of the sample.  Total length ranged from 16.6-40.8 inches and mean was 23.8.   <br> \n <br> \nSauger gill-net abundance was 1.07 fish/set, which was lower than 75% of class 2 lakes.  Five year-classes were present and age ranged from 2-7 years.  Total length ranged from 7.5-16.1 inches and the mean was 11.5.  Mean weight was 0.45 pounds. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye gill-net abundance was 8.27 fish/set, which was above the median of 6.32 fish/set for lake class 2 and similar to the long term median for Sand Point Lake (8.63 fish/set).  However, abundance in 2008 was much lower than levels observed in 2006 (13.00 fish/set) and 2007 (11.93 fish/set).  Fourteen year-classes were present and age ranged from 0-16 years.  Total length ranged from 4.4-21.6 inches.  Mean weight was 0.84 pounds. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch gill-net abundance was 1.07 fish/set, which was less than the first quartile of 1.43 fish/set for class 2 lakes.  Five year-classes were present and age ranged from 2-7 years.  Age-3 fish represented 56% of the sample.  Total length ranged from 5.7-9.2 inches and the mean was 6.3. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Sand Point Lake is a 8,869 acre, softwater lake, located along the border between Minnesota and the Province of Ontario. Sand Point Lake has a rocky irregular shoreline and tannin stained water typical of Canadian Shield type lakes.  The Minnesota portion (5,179 acres) is located within the boundaries of Voyageurs National Park. Sand Point Lake is part of the Namakan Reservoir, which also includes Crane, Kabetogama, Namakan and Little Vermilion lakes. There is no road access on the Minnesota portion of the lake. Thus, most anglers gain access by traveling by boat or snowmobile from road access points located on Crane or Kabetogama Lakes. <br> \n <br> \nTwelve species were present in the 2006 fall assessment gill netting on Sand Point Lake.  Walleye was far and away the most common species in the catch making up 46% of the total by number. Walleye also accounted for the highest total weight in the catch followed by northern pike. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance in Sand Point Lake in 2006 (13.00/net) was the highest on record dating back to the first investigation conducted in 1970.  The previous high occurred in 1999 (11.93/net).  The lake median was 8.83/net. Gill-net abundance in Sand Point Lake has increased annually since 2002 and, in general, has demonstrated an increasing trend since the mid-1980's. The gill-net abundance of walleye over 17 inches in length (2.67/net) also was high relative to the lake average.  Walleye captured in this investigation ranged in length from 4.8 to 26.1 inches with an average of 13.1 inches.  Walleye growth for Sand Point Lake was among the slowest in the International Falls Area. <br> \n <br> \nThirteen year-classes were present in the walleye catch and ages ranged from 0-14 years. Most walleye were from the 2004 year-class (32% of captured walleye) and the 2001 year-class (23% of captured walleye).  The 1999 year-class also contributed substantially to the catch.  More young-of-the-year walleye were captured during the 2006 investigation than during any previous.  Several strong year-classes are all currently present in the fishery resulting in the high walleye abundance observed during this investigation.    <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike abundance (2.40/net) was high in Sand Point Lake during the 2006 investigation.  The number of pike caught in our nets was substantially above the lake average as well as the average for lakes in the same classification as Sand Point.  Gill-net abundance of pike has generally been increasing since the early-1990's.  The average weight of pike sampled during this investigation was 3.8 pounds. Pike up to 36.2 inches were present in the catch.  Growth of Sand Point Lake northern pike was comparable to the Area median. Eight age-groups were present in the catch with age-5 being the most common contributing 33% to the total. <br> \n <br> \nLike northern pike, black crappie abundance (1.60/net) in 2006 was high.  Crappie gill-net abundance has increased since standardized assessments began in 1983.   Black crappie captured during the gill-net assessment ranged in length from 4.4 to 10.8 inches with an average of 7.2 inches.  Crappie growth was comparable to the Area median. <br> \n <br> \nOther species present in the gill-net catch included bluegill, largemouth bass, rock bass, sauger, silver redhorse, smallmouth bass, tullibee (cisco), white sucker and yellow perch.    <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Sand Point Lake is located on the border between Minnesota and the Province of Ontario and is part of the Namakan Reservoir, which also consists of Crane, Kabetogama, Little Vermilion, and Namakan lakes.  There is no road access to several of the lakes.  Thus, anglers gain access by traveling by boat from road access points located on Crane or Kabetogama lakes.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie fishing has become more popular recently on Sand Point Lake and connected waters.  Abundance in the most recent survey was well above the majority of lakes that are similar, as has been the case for many years.  So, fishing should remain similar to past years.  Three year-classes were present and age ranged from 1-3 years.  Fish up to 12.9 inches were found in the sample in 2012.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike gill-net abundance was above what is found in most lakes that are similar.  Anglers have a chance to catch large pike in Sand Point Lake, our sample found fish up to 41.9 inches in 2012.     <br> \n <br> \nSauger are present but generally rare and sizes are small.  The average size sampled in 2012 was 10.2 inches and the average weight for all sauger sampled was 0.29 pounds.   <br> \n <br> \nSmallmouth bass is another choice for anglers visiting Sand Point Lake.  Abundance in 2012 according to our netting results was much lower than the expected range for this lake type.  However, creel surveys show that anglers are successful on Sand Point Lake and trophy-sized fish are out there.   <br> \n <br> \nFor many years the walleye population has consistently been at the top of the expected range for this lake type and 2012 was no exception; in fact, 2011 was the second highest walleye abundance ever recorded for Sand Point Lake.  All eight of the highest abundance levels ever recorded have occurred after a size regulation was implemented in 1998 to enhance the walleye population.  In the 2012 sample, 17 year-classes were present and age ranged from 1-22 years, which provides for a wide range of available sizes for anglers to catch.  Total length in the sample ranged from 5.0-24.2 inches and the average weight was one pound.   <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch are present but abundance was low and sizes were small.  Yellow perch are likely more important as forage for predators rather than recreational fish for anglers.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Sand Point is part of the Namakan Reservoir, which also consists of Crane, Kabetogama, Little Vermilion, and Namakan lakes. There is no road access to this lake. Anglers can access Sand Point from the south from connected Crane Lake. Another viable, yet much longer option, is to enter the north end of Sand Point by launching in Kabetogama and crossing Namakan Lake. Annual sampling with gill nets has taken place since 1983 to monitor the fish populations of Sand Point. A survey was completed in the fall of 2020 to add to this dataset. <br> \n <br> \nSand Point is currently managed for Walleye, Northern Pike, and Lake Sturgeon. This designation of management species allow us to monitor annual catch rates compared to lakes of similar fish communities and water quality characteristics to ensure both a quality fishery and fish community.  <br> \n <br> \nThe first protected slot limit for Walleye was put into place on Sand Point Lake in 1998. Since then, there has been an increase in the average catch rates for this lake. Walleye catch rates were up from the 2019 survey and above the expected catch rate for Sand Point Lake. Walleye up to 27 inches were caught during the survey with an average size of 14.5 inches. A number of year classes were present in our sample indicating a healthy and relatively stable population. The 2017 year class is continuing to look like it may be the strongest since the record breaking 2006 year class, and anticipate seeing them predominantly in our next survey.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike abundance was also greater than expected for this lake type, and the 2020 catch rate was slightly more than the historic average for gill net surveys in Sand Point Lake. The largest fish was <30 inches in our sample, and the average was 22\". Despite a lack of large fish in the nets in 2019, Sand Point does have trophy potential.  <br> \n <br> \nOur standard gill net sampling is not the most effective method to capture Lake Sturgeon, although we did sample two individuals in 2020. We will continue to take lengths and immediately release these important native species back to the water when incidentally captured. <br> \n <br> \nSand Point Lake has a diverse and active fishery with populations of Black Crappie, Sauger, Yellow Perch and Smallmouth Bass present. While not detected in our survey this year, there is a history of Bluegill and Largemouth Bass in these waters as well. Cisco and Yellow Perch provide a suitable forage base for top predators of this lake. This varied fishery can provide ample angler opportunities in a pristine waterbody. </p>",

Sauger abundance was low, but 6 year classes were sampled.  Average length was 11.6 inches, and average weight was 0.4 pounds.        Northern pike size and abundance were average for this lake type, indicating low numbers of quality size fish.  Average length was 26.3 inches, and average weight was 4.3 pounds.             Smallmouth bass, largemouth bass, rock bass, black crappie, and yellow perch offer alternative fishing opportunities.</p>",

Walleye from 7.1\" to 28.5\" were sampled, with an average length of 13.1\", and an average weight of 1.0 pounds.  Eleven year-classes were sampled, and the 1994 year-class appears strong.  This could provide improved angling opportunities for eating sized fish in 1996.Northern pike were present in low numbers, but growth is fast.  The average weight of northern pike sampled was 4.0 pounds, with one fish measuring 31.7\", or 11.5 pounds.Black crappie abundance was above average for lakes of this type, with an average length of 7.0\".  Sauger abundance remains low, while catches of tullibee, yellow perch, and white sucker were comparable to similar lakes.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Sand Point Lake is located on the border between Minnesota and the Province of Ontario and is part of the Namakan Reservoir, which also consists of Crane, Kabetogama, Little Vermilion, and Namakan lakes.  There is no road access to several of the lakes.  Thus, anglers gain access by traveling by boat from road access points located on Crane or Kabetogama lakes.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie fishing has become more popular recently on Sand Point Lake and connected waters.  Abundance in the most recent survey was slightly above the expected range for this lake type, as has been the case for many years.  So, fishing should remain similar to past years.  Several size-classes were present in the sample and fish up to 10.4 inches were sampled in 2014.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike abundance was near the top of the expected range for this lake type.  Anglers have a chance to catch very large pike in Sand Point Lake; our sample found fish up to 42.4 inches in 2014.     <br> \n <br> \nSauger are present but generally rare and sizes are small.  The average size sampled in 2014 was 10.3 inches and the average weight for all Sauger sampled was 0.30 pounds.   <br> \n <br> \nSmallmouth Bass is another choice for anglers visiting Sand Point Lake.  Abundance in 2014 according to our netting results was slightly above the low end of the expected range for this lake type.  Angler creel surveys show that anglers are successful on Sand Point Lake and trophy-sized fish are out there.   <br> \n <br> \nFor many years the Walleye population has consistently been at the top of the expected range for this lake type.   All eight of the highest abundance levels ever recorded have occurred after a size regulation was implemented in 1998 to enhance the Walleye population.  Abundance in 2014 was at the high end of the normal range for Sand Point Lake.  Fifteen year-classes were present and age ranged from 1-16 years, which provides for a wide range of available sizes for anglers to catch.  Many year-classes looked promising and should provide good fishing in the immediate future.  Total length in the sample ranged from 4.4-24.6 inches and the average weight was about one pound.   <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch are present but abundance was low and sizes were small.  Yellow Perch are likely more important as forage for predators rather than recreational fish for anglers.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Sand Point Lake is part of the Namakan Resevoir.  Assessments are conducted annually.  In 1996, the most abundant species was walleye, with catches of 11.4 per gill net.  This was the highest walleye catch rate ever observed on Sand point Lake.  The average size of walleye was 13.1\".  A strong 1994 year class should provide good angling opportunities over the next several years.  Abundances of other gamefish were low compared to the walleye, but were normal for this lake type, and normal for Sand Point Lake.  The most notable species was northern pike, which were very fast growing.  Even at age 2, most of the northern pike were over 20\" long.  The average size of northern pike was 25.5\".Yellow perch and sauger were both present, but low abundance and slow growth rates probably limit the contributions to anglers in most years.  In 1996, however, more sauger were over 11\" than under 11\" because of strong 1989 and 1990 year classes.  Other game species sampled included smallmouth bass, black crappie, bluegill, and lake sturgeon.  Tullibee were abundant.Four small mesh gill nets were set for rainbow smelt sampling.  No smelt were collected.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Sand Point Lake is a 8,869 acre, class 2 lake, located along the border between Minnesota and the Province of Ontario.  The Minnesota portion (5,179 acres) is located in Voyageurs National Park.  Sand Point Lake is part of the Namakan Reservoir, which also includes Crane, Kabetogama, Little Vermilion, and Namakan lakes.  There is no road access on the Minnesota portion of the lake.  Thus, anglers gain access by traveling by boat from road access points located on Crane or Kabetogama lakes.       Black bullheads, black crappies, bluegills, cisco, golden shiners, northern pike, rock bass, saugers, shorthead redhorse, walleyes, white suckers, and yellow perch were captured in gill nets in 2000.  Generally, fish population abundances were similar to previous assessments.          Black crappie abundance was 1.20 fish/set, which was four times greater than the average class 2 lake.  Age ranged from 1-3, with age-2 composing 67% of the sample.  Total length (TL) ranged from 4.2-9.4 inches.      Northern pike gill net abundance was slightly above average for class 2 lakes.  Seven year-classes were present and age ranged from 2-8 years, with age-4 composing 54% of the sample.  Total length ranged from 20.0-41.1 inches.  Growth and mean weight were above average.       Walleye gill net abundance was 9.20 fish/set, which was much greater than the average of 6.32 fish/set for lake class 2.  Ten year-classes were present and age ranged from 1-11 years.  Strong year-classes were produced in 1994, 1996, and 1998.  Total length ranged from 6.3-25.6 inches and the mean was 13.3.  Mean length at age-4 was less than the area and statewide averages.  Mean weight was the same as walleyes sampled in other class 2 lakes.      Yellow perch gill net abundance was slighty above average for class 2 lakes.  Five year-classes were present and age ranged from 2-6 years.  Ages 3 and 4 fish composed 84% of the sample.  Total length ranged from 5.3-8.7 inches and the mean was 6.6.  Mean TL at age-4 was lower than what is typically observed in the area and state.   </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Sand Point Lake is a 8,869 acre, class 2 lake, located along the border between Minnesota and the Province of Ontario.  The Minnesota portion (5,179 acres) is located in Voyageurs National Park.  Sand Point Lake is part of the Namakan Reservoir, which also consists of Crane, Kabetogama, Little Vermilion, and Namakan lakes.  There is no road access on the Minnesota portion of the lake.  Thus, anglers gain access by traveling from road access points located on Crane or Kabetogama lakes.       Black crappie abundance was 0.53 fish/net, which was above most lakes of this type.  Age ranged from 2-4 years and total length ranged from 6.4-10.6 inches.      Northern pike abundance was 2.40 fish/net, which was well above what is expected for this lake type.  Six year-classes were present and age ranged from 2-7 years, with ages 4 and 5 representing most of the sample.  Total length ranged from 21.3-35.4 inches and growth was faster than the statewide average.  Fish were also heavier than what is observed in most lakes of this type.     Sauger abundance was the second highest ever recorded on Sand Point Lake, however, it was lower than most lakes of this type.  Total length ranged from 7.5-14.8 inches and growth was above the area average.      Walleye abundance was 11.87 fish/net, which was much higher than similar lakes.  Thirteen year-classes were present and age ranged from 0-15 years.  Total length ranged from 4.5-26.4 inches and the average was 13.0.  Growth was slower than the area and statewide averages.         Yellow perch abundance was 1.40 fish/net, a decrease from the previous investigation and lower than most lakes of this type.  Four year-classes were present and age ranged from 3-6 years.  Age-3 fish represented 48% of the sample.  Total length ranged from 5.6-8.5 inches and the mean was 6.6.  Growth was slower than the area and statewide averages.   </p>",

The Minnesota portion (5,179 acres) is located in Voyageurs National Park.  Sand Point Lake is part of the Namakan Reservoir, which also consists of Crane, Kabetogama, Little Vermilion, and Namakan lakes.  There is no road access on the Minnesota portion of the lake.  Thus, anglers gain access by traveling by boat from road access points located on Crane or Kabetogama lakes.       Black crappie abundance was more than three times greater than the median for similar lakes (class 2).  Growth was above the area average and individuals up to 12.0 inches were captured.      Walleye gill net abundance was 6.20 fish/set, which was slightly below what is observed in most class 2 lakes and the lowest abundance in Sand Point Lake since 1988.  Many year classes were present and age ranged from 1-13 years.  Total length ranged from 7.0-26.8 inches and the mean was 13.7.  Growth was slower than the area and statewide averages.  However, mean weight of walleyes was greater than observed in most class 2 lakes.       Yellow perch and sauger gill net abundance was low and sizes were small.  Northern pike abundance, growth, mean weight, and size structure was similar to what is expected for this lake type.   </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Sand Point Lake is located on the border between Minnesota and the Province of Ontario and is part of the Namakan Reservoir, which also consists of Crane, Kabetogama, Little Vermilion, and Namakan lakes.  There is no road access to several of the lakes.  Thus, anglers gain access by traveling by boat from road access points located on Crane or Kabetogama lakes.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie fishing has become more popular recently on Sand Point Lake and connected waters.  Abundance in the most recent survey was above the majority of lakes that are similar, as has been the case for many years.  So, fishing should remain similar to past years.  Anglers have a chance to catch very large crappies in Sand Point Lake; our sample found fish up to 11.0 inches in 2010. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike abundance was above what is normally found in similar lakes.  Abundance in 2010 was the second highest ever recorded for Sand Point Lake.  Furthermore, three of the four highest abundance levels ever recorded have all occurred after 2000; the year in which the rule-curve used to regulate water levels was changed to enhance northern pike spawning habitat.  Long-term trends also suggest that the change in water levels has improved northern pike abundance; mean abundance has increased almost 40% after the change in water levels was made.   Although abundance is increasing, size remains impressive; our sample in 2010 included fish up to 36.1 inches.     <br> \n <br> \nSauger are present but generally rare and sizes are small.  The largest sampled in 2010 was 11.1 inches and the average weight was 0.26 pounds.   <br> \n <br> \nSmallmouth bass is another choice for anglers visiting Sand Point Lake.  Abundance in 2010 according to our netting results was much lower than the expected range for this lake type.  However, creel surveys show that anglers are successful on Sand Point Lake and trophy-sized fish are out there.   <br> \n <br> \nFor many years the walleye population has consistently been at the top of the expected range for this lake type and 2010 was no exception; in fact, 2010 was the highest walleye abundance ever recorded for Sand Point Lake.  All five of the highest abundance levels ever recorded have occurred after a size regulation was implemented in 1998 to enhance the walleye population.  In the 2010 sample, 19 year-classes were present and age ranged from 0-20 years, which provides for a wide range of available sizes for anglers to catch.  Total length in the sample ranged from 6.2-27.5 inches and the average weighed about 1 pound.   <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch are present but abundance was low and sizes were small.  Yellow perch are likely more important as forage for predators rather than recreational fish for anglers.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Sand Point Lake is a 8,869 acre, softwater lake, located along the border between Minnesota and the Province of Ontario. Sand Point Lake has a rocky irregular shoreline and tannin stained water typical of Canadian Shield lakes.  The Minnesota portion (5,179 acres) is located within the boundaries of Voyageurs National Park. Sand Point Lake is part of the Namakan Reservoir, which also includes Crane, Kabetogama, Namakan and Little Vermilion lakes. There is no road access on the Minnesota side. Thus, most anglers gain access by traveling by boat or snowmobile from road access points located on Crane or Kabetogama Lakes. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye were the most abundant species during the 2007 investigation.  Walleye abundance (11.93/net) was the second highest on record dating back to 1970.  Only the abundance recorded in 2006 (13.00/net) was higher.  Gillnet abundance in Sand Point Lake has recovered from low abundance noted between 2002-05, and, in general, has demonstrated an upward trend since the mid-1980's. The gill-net abundance of walleye over 17 inches in length (2.87/net) also was high relative to the lake average.  Walleye captured in this investigation ranged in length from 4.7 to 24.3 inches with an average of 13.0 inches.  Walleye growth for Sand Point Lake was among the slowest in the International Falls Area. <br> \n <br> \nFifteen year-classes were present in the walleye catch and ages ranged from 0-19 years. Most walleye were from the 2006 year-class (28% of captured walleye) and the 2004 year-class (25% of captured walleye).  The 2001 year-class also contributed substantially to the catch.  Several strong year-classes are all currently present in the fishery resulting in the high walleye abundance observed during this investigation.    <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike abundance (4.27/net) in 2007 was the highest recorded for Sand Point Lake and was exceptional when compared to other lakes in the same classification as Sand Point.  Gillnet abundance of pike has generally been increasing since the early-1990's.  The average weight of pike sampled during this investigation was 3.6 pounds. Pike up to 38.6 inches were present in the catch.  The 2001 and 2005 year-classes appeared to be strong. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie gillnet abundance (2.60/net) in 2007 was high, the second highest on record.  Crappie gill-net abundance has increased since standardized assessments began in 1983.   Black crappie captured during the gill-net assessment ranged in length from 4.2 to 11.1 inches with an average of 6.8 inches. <br> \n <br> \nOther species present in the gill-net catch included burbot, rock bass, sauger, smallmouth bass, tullibee (cisco), white sucker and yellow perch.  The seven smallmouth bass captured during this investigation averaged 2.0 pounds. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Sand Point Lake is located on the border between Minnesota and the Province of Ontario and is part of the Namakan Reservoir, which also consists of Crane, Kabetogama, Little Vermilion, and Namakan lakes.  There is no road access to several of the lakes.  Thus, anglers gain access by traveling by boat from road access points located on Crane or Kabetogama lakes.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie fishing has become more popular recently on Sand Point Lake and connected waters.  Abundance in the most recent survey was slightly above the expected range for this lake type, as has been the case for many years.  So, fishing should remain similar to past years.  Several size-classes were present in the sample and fish up to 10.6 inches were sampled in 2016.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike abundance was well above the top of the expected range for this lake type.  Anglers have a chance to catch very large pike in Sand Point Lake; our samples commonly include fish over 40 inches.     <br> \n <br> \nSauger are present but generally rare and sizes are small.  The average size sampled in 2016 was 10.0 inches and the average weight for all Sauger sampled was 0.28 pounds.   <br> \n <br> \nSmallmouth Bass is another choice for anglers visiting Sand Point Lake.  Abundance in 2016 according to our netting results was within the expected range for this lake type.  Also, angler creel surveys show that anglers catch good numbers on Sand Point Lake and trophy-sized fish are out there.   <br> \n <br> \nFor many years the Walleye population has consistently been at the top of the expected range for this lake type.   All nine of the highest abundance levels ever recorded have occurred after a size regulation was implemented in 1998 to enhance the Walleye population.  Abundance in 2016, was again above the normal range for Sand Point Lake.  Fifteen year-classes were present and age ranged from 1-20 years, which provides for a wide range of available sizes for anglers to catch.  Many year-classes looked promising and should provide good fishing in the immediate future.  Total length in the sample ranged from 7.4-28.0 inches and the average weight was about one pound.   <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch are present but abundance was low and sizes were small.  Yellow Perch are likely more important as forage for predators rather than recreational fish for anglers.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Sand Point Lake is located on the Minnesota-Ontario border approximately 5 miles north of the community of Crane Lake, Minnesota. This border lake has a total surface area of 8,526 acres, with 4,848 in Minnesota. Sand Point is part of the Namakan Reservoir, which also consists of Crane, Kabetogama, Little Vermilion, and Namakan lakes. There is no road access to this lake. Anglers can access Sand Point from the south from connected Crane Lake. Another viable, yet much longer option, is to enter the north end of Sand Point by launching in Kabetogama and crossing Namakan Lake. Annual sampling with gill nets has taken place since 1983 to monitor the fish populations of Sand Point. A survey was completed in the fall of 2019 to add to this dataset.  <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie abundance was higher than expected for this type of lake, which is often the case for Sand Point. Most of these were young fish from the 2017 and 2018 year classes, so the average size was small. Average length was 7 inches, and the largest was over 10 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike abundance was also greater than expected for this lake type, and the 2019 catch rate was slightly more than the historic average for gill net surveys in Sand Point. About 70% of the sample was made up of fish that were 4 years old or younger, but ages up to 11 years old were caught. The average size was approximately 23 inches and the largest caught during this survey was 36 inches. Despite a lack of large fish in the nets in 2019, Sand Point does have trophy potential.  <br> \n <br> \nSauger abundance was similar to past surveys. Sand Point tends to have below average Sauger abundance compared to similar lakes. The average size in 2019 was approximately 10 inches. Sauger up to 13 years old were caught, and a strong 2015 year class made up over half of the sample.  <br> \n <br> \nSmallmouth Bass are not typically caught in high numbers in gill nets. The small sample caught in 2019 showed that abundance is near average for similar lakes. The average size was 15 inches, and the maximum size in 2019 was nearly 20 inches. A single Largemouth Bass was also sampled in 2019, which is a fairly rare encounter in Sand Point. The Largemouth was a 19 inch, 16 year old fish. Smallmouth ages ranged from 2 to 13 years old.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye catch rates were down from the last survey, but still near the expected catch rate for Sand Point. The average size was 15 inches, which is larger than what would be expected for this type of lake. Walleye up to 25 inches were caught during the survey. The first protected slot limit was put into place on Sand Point in 1998. Since then, there has been an increase in the average catch rates for this lake. Remnants of an extremely strong 2006 year class are still present in the system. The 2011 to 2013 year classes were fairly strong, and make up a lot of the fish that anglers may encounter now. The 2017 year class looks like it may be the strongest since the record breaking 2006 year class, but more time is needed to evaluate survival of those young Walleye.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch catch rates were similar to recent surveys, but less than the historic average for Sand Point. Sizes are very similar to the average for similar lakes. The average length of Yellow Perch during the 2019 survey was just under 7 inches, and the largest were over 10 inches. The 2016 year class made up nearly half of the catch.  <br> \n <br> \nOther fish sampled during the 2019 survey include Bluegill, Cisco, Lake Whitefish, Mooneye, Pumpkinseed, and White Sucker. <br> \n</p>",
