                "narrative": "<p>Lester Lake has a surface area of 67 acres and is located six miles south of Laporte in northeastern Hubbard County.  Lester Lake and the surrounding shoreline were purchased by the state in 2010 and is managed as a Scientific and Natural Area and Aquatic Management Area.  There is a carry-in access located on the northeast shore of the lake.  The 2010 survey was the first time that the lake has been surveyed by the DNR.  Due to its small size and potential for over-harvest, a catch and release regulation for all species was implemented in the fall of 2010.  Lester Lake provides fishing opportunities for bluegill, largemouth bass, and northern pike. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill were sampled in moderate numbers (18.5 bluegill/trapnet) for this area.  The bluegill population was composed of quality-sized fish for this area.  Sampled bluegill had an average length and weight of 8.1 inches and 0.5 pounds, with fish measured up to 10.6 inches.  Pumpkinseed were sampled in low numbers with fish in the 5 to 7 inch size range.  Local anglers have reported good fishing for largemouth bass and an occasional large northern pike.  Northern pike abundance (11.0 pike/gillnet) was high for this area.  Average size of sampled northern pike was small (17.7 inches); however, larger fish are present with pike measured up to 37.2 inches.  Largemouth bass up to 19.1 inches were sampled. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled included rock bass and yellow bullhead in low numbers. <br> \n</p>",
