                "narrative": "<p>Northern pike CPUE (14.0/gillnet lift) was above the third quartile value (10.00) for Lake Class 36.  These fish ranged in length from 10.5 - 34.9 inches, with a modal length group of 18.0-18.9 inches.  The PSD value of 24 was low, but there were a few fish over 28 inches (RSD-P=14).  Age III northern pike was by far the strongest year class making up 44 percent of the catch.  There was a distinct difference between sexes as far as growth, an age III female was 19.8 inches long and an age III male was only 14.3 inches long.Only one walleye was captured in the gillnets (0.3 CPUE).  This was a 17.8 inch long male that showed good growth.  No stocking has been done on this lake.Bluegill were caught at a rate of 27.9/trapnet lift, which fell between the median (16.75) and the third quartile (45.13) for this lake class.  These fish ranged in length from 4.0-8.4 inches, with a modal length group of 7.0-7.4 inches.  The PSD and RSD(7) values were high at 98 and 56 repsectively.  Growth was good at all ages compared to other area lakes with an age V fish being 5.8 inches long.There were 18 black crappie captured that ranged in length from 7.5-10.4 inches, with a modal length group of 8.5-8.9 inches.  The PSD and RSD-P values were 94 and 11 respectively.Forage fish were represented mostly by white sucker (1.8/gillnet lift) and yellow perch (10.3/gillnet lift).  Their catch rates fell within the interquartile ranges for this lake class.No largemouth bass were captured in the gillnets or trapnets.  Since electrofishing is a better sampling gear for largemouth bass, electrofishing should be conducted during the next fish population assessment.</p>",
