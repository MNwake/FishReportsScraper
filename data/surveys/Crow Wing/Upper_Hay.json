                "narrative": "<p>Upper Hay Lake is a 581 acre lake located just east of Jenkins in Crow Wing County.  A public access is located on the west side of the lake.  The lake is heavily developed with over 104 homes/cabins along 4 miles of shoreline as of 1997.  The maximum depth is 42' and about 32% of the lake is 15' deep or less.  Shallow water substrates are promarily sand, gravel, and rock/rubble.  The aquatic plant community is relatively diverse with 31 species present and is critical to maintaining healthy fish populations.  Emergent plants such as bulrush and water lilies are important for shoreline protection, maintaining water quality, and provide essential spawning habitat for bass and panfish species.  Submerged plants provide food and cover needed by fish and other aquatic species.Walleyes are currently stocked annually as fry at a rate of 1,000 per littoral acre (184,000 fry).  Historical catches have ranged from 1.5 to 8.0/gill net and averaged 3.6/gill net since 1950.  The 2002 walleye catch of 4.2/gill net was average when compared to similar lakes and is the second highest catch to date.  The 1996, 2000, and 2001 year classes each represented 18% of the catch.  Average length and weight remained similar to 1997 at 15.2\" and 1.4lbs.  Spring electrofishing indicated a strong 2001 year class which accounted for 84% of the fish caught by electrofishing.  These fish ranged in size from 6.4\" to 8.7\" and averaged 7.4\".Northern pike were caught in average numbers in 2002 at 5.3/gill net.  Past catches have ranged from 2.0 to 9.3/gill net.  The 1997 and 1998 year classes each contributed 35% of the catch with most of these fish measuring 19.5\" to 22\".  Average length and weight were 20.3\" and 1.8lbs, which is very similar to 1997.The largemouth bass catch of 0.8/trap net was average when compared to similar lakes and the second highest catch to date.  About 64% of all bass measured (gill nets and trap nets combined) were 12\" or larger.  Spring electrofishing resulted in a largemouth bass catch rate of 8.7/hr with an average length of 14.9\" and 92% measuring at least 12\".  The bluegill catch of 19.7/trap net was average and 5.7% of trap netted bluegills measured 7\" or larger, compared to 24% in 1997.  Black crappie abundance measured by gill nets was average at 1.2/gill net, but the trap net catch was below average at 0.1/trap net.  Average weight was 0.7lbs and all of the fish sampled were 8\" or larger.Yellow perch catches have ranged from 4.2/gill net (1997) to 115/gill net (1960) in the past.  At 6.4/gill net, the 2002 catch was below average for the second consecutive netting with the 1998 year class representing 81% of the catch.  Young-of-the-year and small perch in general were relatively abundant in shoreline seining and are important as forage for the lake's game fish.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Upper Hay is a 581 acre lake located one mile east of Jenkins in northern Crow Wing County.   It reaches depths of 42', with 36% shallower than 15' deep.  Extensive bulrush beds are located around the lake.   Protecting aquatic vegetation, especially emergent vegetation, is important because it provides critical spawning habitat for fish as well as habitat for other aquatic life, and is essential to maintain good water quality. <br> \n <br> \nWalleyes are stocked annually as fry into Upper Hay (184,000 fry/year).  The Walleye gill net catch of 3.4 was average when compared to similar lakes.  Average length was 16.7\", with Walleyes up to 28.5\" sampled.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike were also sampled in average numbers at 3.4/gill net.  Most ran on the small size, with an average length of 19.0\".  Northern Pike in the protected 22-26\" made up 13% of the catch, with 3% at least 26\" in length.  Lakes in this part of the state have a new Northern Pike regulation enacted in 2018: possession limit of 10 with not more than 2 over 26\".  All from 22-26\" must be immediately released.  Please refer to the current Minnesota Fishing Regulations for additional information. <br> \n <br> \nPanfish are a popular target for anglers on Upper Hay.  Black Crappies were sampled in average numbers in both gill and trap nets.  Average length was 8.9\" in gill nets and 7.3\" in trap nets.  For both gears combined, 47% measured at least 8\" in length.  Black Crappies up to 12.2\" were sampled.  Bluegills were sampled in average numbers in trap nets.  Most ran on the small side, with an average length of 4.9\".  Bluegills measuring at least 7\" in length made up 7% of the catch. <br> \n <br> \nZebra mussels are present in Upper Hay Lake.  Before and after launching lake users are required to inspect and remove any aquatic plants and animals from their watercraft and trailers as well as pull the plug and drain all water from the watercraft, including bilges, livewells and baitwells. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Upper Hay Lake is a 581 acre lake located 1 mile east of Jenkins in Crow Wing County.  It reaches depths of 42', with 36% shallower than 15' deep.  Upper Hay is heavily developed.  A public access is located on the west side.   The aquatic plant community is quite diverse, with large emergent beds located on the north and east shores.  Protection of aquatic vegetation, especially emergent vegetation, is important for maintaining good water quality.  Aquatic vegetation is critical for fish spawning areas as well as providing habitat for fish and other aquatic life.   <br> \n <br> \nWalleye fry are stocked annually into Upper Hay.  The walleye catch in 2014 was below average, compared to similar lakes, at 1.9/gillnet.  Average size was 15.6\" and 1.7 lbs., with the largest measuring 28.2\".   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike were caught in high numbers at 12.4/gillnet.  This was the highest catch in Upper Hay to date.  Most ran on the small side, with an average size of 20.4\" and 1.9 lbs.  A few larger northern pike were present, with 10% greater than 24\" in length.  Voluntary catch and release of these larger fish will help keep a balanced northern pike population. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass were sampled during a spring electrofishing survey, at a rate of 33.0/hr.  Size was nice with an average length of 13.6\" and 67% at least 12\".  Largemouth were caught in average numbers in gillnets at 0.4/net with an average length of 15.3\".   <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappies were captured in average numbers in gillnets at 2.2/net, and in above average numbers in trapnets at 2.8/net.  For both gears combined 49% measured at least 8\" in length.  The bluegill trapnet catch of 12.9/net was average compared to similar lakes.  Average length was 5.7\", with 13% measuring at least 7\". <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch were captured in low numbers at 1.2/gillnet.  This is the lowest catch to date in Upper Hay.  Past catches have ranged as high as 115.0/gillnet (1960).  The high abundance of small northern pike is likely keeping the population of yellow perch down.  Yellow perch are an important prey species for walleye and northern pike. <br> \n <br> \nUpper Hay is listed as infested with zebra mussels.  Lake users are required to inspect and remove any aquatic plants and animals from their watercraft and trailers as well as pull the plug and drain all water from the watercraft, including bilges, livewells and baitwells. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Upper Hay is a 581 acre lake located just east of Jenkins in northwestern Crow Wing County.  The lake is 42 feet deep and about 32% of the surface area is less than 15 feet deep.  It is a hardwater lake with moderate fertility.  Water clarity is somewhat below average for the area.  Bottom soils in water less than four feet deep are primarily sand, gravel and rubble sized rock (3-10\" diameter).  The aquatic plant community is fairly diverse and plants grew to a depth of about 18 feet in 1997.  The aquatic plant community is important to maintaining healthy fish populations.  Submergent/floating leaf species provide critical cover and food resources for many fish species.  Emergent species provide shoreline protection and species like wild rice and bulrush enhance the quality of spawning areas for bass, panfish and northern pike.In the 1997 test netting, northern pike and bowfin (dogfish) catches were in the \"high\" category when compared to similar type lakes.  Catches of walleyes, yellow perch, black crappies and yellow bullheads were in the \"low\" category.  Catches of bluegills, pumpkinseeds, rock bass, largemouth bass, white suckers and brown bullheads were in the \"average\" category.Northern pike catches have historically been around 2-3/gill net lift.  The 1997 catch of 9.3/gill net was high, but a large majority of individuals were from either the 1993 or '94 year classes.  Pike averaged 20 inches long and 2 lbs. in weight.The walleye catch of 1.8/gill net was in the \"low\" category, but within the range of catches made in previous nettings of Upper Hay.  The averages of 15 inches and 1.4 lbs. are near or equal to the highest values from previous nettings.  Walleye fingerlings are currently being stocked.  Stocking was annual from 1984-1993.  It was recently changed to alternate year stocking in order to better detect natural reproduction and evaluate success of the stocking plan.Largemouth bass were only sampled by gill nets but appeared to be present in \"average\" numbers.  Young bass were found in shoreline seine hauls and averaged 2.1 inches long in early August.Bluegills were found in \"average\" numbers.  At least six age classes were present.  Most abundant were fish from the 1995 year class.  Bluegills averaged 4.5-5.0 inches in length and growth was \"good.\"  Trap netted bluegills ranged from 3.5-9.3 inches long and about 24% were at least 7.0 inches long; an improvement from 3% of similar size in the '92 netting.The black crappie catch was \"low\" in '97 but the catch was nearly the same as in '92 when the catch was in the \"average\" category.  Historically, the crappie catch has been variable.  It was in the \"average range in the 1970's.  Nettings in the 1980's saw catches in the \"high\" range.  Catches in the 1990's have bordered on \"low.\"Yellow perch are an important forage species for gamefish.  Historically, catches were very \"high\" in 1950 and 1960.  From 1972-'92, catches were in the \"average\" range.  The '92 catch fell into the \"low\" category.  One explanation may be increased predation by northern pike, especially the two large year classes described above.  Young perch were abundant in shoreline seine hauls.  Perch growth bordered on slow in 1997.</p>",

The net catch of 3.7/net is within the historical range of 1.5 to 8.0/gill net. The average catch rate has been around 3.2/gill net.  Sizes in 2008 ranged from 12.3 to 23.7 inches and averaged 17.1 inches. Fry stocking success has been good. Growth rate is also good.  The northern pike catch of 8.3/gill net is on the higher end of historical net catches. The average size was 21.4 inches with fish as large as 31.4 inches. Black crappie were captured in both gear types in moderate numbers, and averaged 8.4 inches. Largest fish was 12.9 inches. Bluegill numbers were moderate with fish as large as 9.3 inches.  A total of 17 % were over 7.0 inches.   Both black crappie and bluegill receive heavy fishing pressure and anglers have good success.   <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of nearshore fish species in Upper Hay Lake was conducted on June 27-29, 2022, by Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program staff. Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake, and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at fourteen sampling stations. Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample twelve stations and a 15-foot seine was used at two stations. Nearshore sampling captured twenty species of fish including five species that are intolerant of disturbance (i.e., Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Iowa Darter, Mimic Shiner, and Rock Bass) and two that are tolerant of disturbance (i.e., Fathead Minnow and Green Sunfish). <br> \n <br> \nA concurrent summer trap net survey was also conducted by IBI Program staff. Nine trap nets were set along the shoreline in locations that encompassed multiple habitat types. Trap net sampling captured ten species of fish, including one that is intolerant of disturbance (i.e., Rock Bass). Bluegill comprised a majority of the catch by number, whereas Bowfin comprised a majority by biomass. <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore and trap net data were combined with gill net data from an August 2020 survey to describe the fish community and provide a fish-based IBI (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment. In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g., Blackchin Shiner, Iowa Darter, and Rock Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g., Fathead Minnow and Green Sunfish). The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.  <br> \n <br> \nResults from this survey indicate that the fish community in Upper Hay Lake is healthy as indicated by an FIBI score above the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes. These results will be considered when the biological health of the lake is assessed during the Pine River Watershed assessment process, which will be completed in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.</p>",

THESE SPECIES EXHIBITED CATCH RATES WHICH EXCEEDED THE THIRD QUARTILE OF THE BRAINERED AREA MEDIAN FOR LAKES THAT RANGE IN SIZE FROM 511-1074 ACRES. NORTHERN PIKE, YELLOW BULLHEAD, BROWN BULLHEAD, ROCK BASS, PUMPKINSEED, LARGEMOUTH BASS AND YELLOW PERCH CATCH RATES INDICATE AVERAGE POPULATIONS BECAUSE THE NET CATCHES FELL BETWEEN THE FIRST QUARTILE AND THE THIRD QUARTILE OF THE AREA MEDIAN BLUEGILL AND WALLEYE NET CATCHES INDICATED LOW POPULATIONS WITH NET CATCHES BELOW THE FIRST QUARTILE OF THE AREA MEDIAN. THE 1987 NORTHERN PIKE GILLNET CATCH IS ABOUT NORMAL FOR UPPER HAY LAKE. THE CATCH RATES HAVE RANGED FROM 2.0 TO 6.0/GILLNET WITH 4 OUT OF 6 NETTINGS RANGING FROM 2.0 TO 2.3/GILLNET. NORTHERN PIKE RANGED IN SIZE FROM 10.5 TO 34.9 INCHES IN 1987. FOUR YEAR CLASSES WERE REPRESENTED IN THE NETS WITH NO PREDOMINATE YEAR CLASS. GROWTH RATE WAS AVEAGE FOR ALL YEAR CLASSES WHEN COMPARED TO STATEWIDE AVERAGES. THE WHITE SUCKER POPULATION WAS EXCEEDINGLY HIGH IN 1987 AND NET CATCHES WERE ALSO COMPARATIVELY HIGH IN PAST NETTINGS. THE BLACK, YELLOW AND BROWN BULLHEAD POPULATIONS WERE SIMILAR TO PAST NETTINGS. THERE IS NO HISTORY OF UPPER HAY EVER HAVING OVER-ABUNDANT BULLHEAD POPULATIONS DURING ANY PAST SURVEY. THE BLUEGILL NET CATCH IN 1987, AS IN PAST SURVEYS WAS LOW IN COMPARISON TO OTHER AREA LAKES. SIX YEAR CLASSES WERE REPRESENTED IN THE NETS WITH YEAR CLASS II AND III INDICATING SLOW GROWTH RATES AND V THRU VIII INDICATING AVERAGE GROWTH COMPARED TO STATEWIDE AVERAGES. THE LARGEMOUTH BASS POPULATION IS GOOD WITH THE CATCH EXCEEDING PAST NETTINGS. THREE YEAR CLASSES WERE REPRESENTED IN THE NETS AND ALL EXHIBITED GOOD GROWTH RATES COMPARED TO STATEWIDE AVERAGES. YEAR CLASS I WAS DOMINANT IN THE NETS. BLACK CRAPPIE ABUNDANCE, AS IN PAST SURVEYS, REMAINED HIGH. FOUR YEAR CLASSES WERE PRESENT IN THE NETS WITH ALL INDICATING GOOD GROWTH RATE. YEAR CLASS I WAS DOMINANT AND MEASURED 2.36 INCHES AT ANNULI I. YELLOW PERCH ABUNDANCE IS MODERATE AND COMPARES WITH THE 1972, 1978 AND 1982 SURVEYS BUT IS BELOW THE 73.6/GILLNET IN 1950 AND THE 115/GILLNET IN 1960. THE WALLEYE POPULATION HAS EXHIBITED A SIGNIFICANT DECLINE IN ABUNDANCE COMPARED TO ANY SURVEY SINCE 1950. GROWTH RATES WERE GOOD FOR YEAR CLASSES III THRU VI AND SLOW FOR YEAR CLASS I. WALLEYE SIZE RANGED FROM 12.0 TO 16.9 INCHES LONG.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of nearshore fish species in Upper Hay Lake was conducted beginning on August 19th, 2020 by Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program Staff. Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at 14 sampling stations. Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample 12 stations and a 15-foot seine was used at two stations. Nearshore sampling captured 26 species of fish including eight species that are intolerant of disturbance (Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, Logperch, Mimic Shiner, Mottled Sculpin, and Rock Bass) and one that is tolerant of disturbance (Green Sunfish). <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore data were combined with trap net and gill net data from an August 2020 survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based IBI (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment. In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g. Iowa Darter, Logperch, Mottled Sculpin), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g. Fathead Minnow and Green Sunfish). The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.  <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey indicates Upper Hay Lake is in good health as indicated by an exceptionally high FIBI score, well above the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes. Data from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Pine River Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.</p>",
