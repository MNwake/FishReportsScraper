These two environmental conditions, along with heavy winter snowfall that cuts down light penetration into the water will contribute to occasional winterkill, with usually a partial die-off of existing fish populations. This past winter of 2007-08 was one of those years. The largemouth bass, black crappie, and bluegill were affected the most. Northern pike populations are still high, at 12.5/gill net and averaging 22.3 inches.  Fish up to 32.4 inches were observed. Growth rate was normal.  Black crappie was observed in moderate numbers, with a mean size of only 5.6 inches. Many of the bigger crappies that were present died-off this past winter. Growth rate should be good for the remaining crappies this year because of less competition for food, and larger fish should return in a short time. The small population of bluegill and largemouth bass that remains should be able to repopulate the lake.   <br> \n</p>",
