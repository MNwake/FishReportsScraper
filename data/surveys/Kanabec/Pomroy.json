                "narrative": "<p>Pomroy Lake is a shallow 422 acre lake that is managed for northern pike, walleye, largemouth bass, bluegill, and black crappie.  This lake is subject to frequent low oxygen levels in winter, leading to winterkills every 3-4 years on the average.  Most often, the winterkills are not complete; although dead fish may be seen as the ice goes out, many fish do survive.  In a situation like this, fishing can vary greatly from one year to the next, and is difficult to predict.     Northern pike benefitted from a good spawning year in 1992; many of the northerns seen in the 1995 lake survey were from that year class.  The average northern pike was 2.1 pounds (about 21 inches), but some larger northerns (4-5 pounds) were also present.     Walleye fry (newly hatched walleye) were stocked into Pomroy Lake in 1989 in an attempt to raise fingerlings to stock into other area lakes.  While the fingerlings were too small at the time of harvest to be of much use for stocking, they have grown and provided a \"bonus\" to anglers on Pomroy Lake over the past few years.  These fish now average about two pounds.  While walleye spawning is usually highly unlikely in this type of lake, there is evidence that walleye did spawn once, in 1993; one two year old, 12-inch walleye was netted during this survey.     Largemouth bass were sampled by night electrofishing in early June.  The number of bass netted during this sampling indicates that bass abundance is fairly low in Pomroy Lake.  However, adult spawners were present and good numbers of young-of-year largemouth bass were seen in late summer.     The black crappie appears to be one species that is well adapted to this lake.  Crappies of all ages from 0-6 were seen in test nets, with sizes ranging from 3.5-11.9 inches.  Crappie numbers were above average for this type of lake.     Bluegill numbers, on the other hand, were low compared with typical catches for this lake type.  Past surveys indicate that bluegill abundance has usually been low in this lake, but the average size of individuals is usually good.     Other species present in Pomroy Lake include yellow perch, black bullhead, yellow bullhead, brown bullhead, golden shiner, pumpkinseed sunfish, and green sunfish.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Pomroy is a 422 acre shallow, soft water lake assigned to lake class 39.  It is subject to frequent winter kills of varying degrees, the latest on record having occurred during the winter of 1995-96.  To reestablish game fish Pomroy Lake was stocked with walleye fry (211,500), northern pike fingerlings (7,213), and adult largemouth bass and bluegill in the spring and summer of 1996.  Adult black crappie were stocked in the spring of 1997.          In order to evaluate the goals of the Pomroy Lake management plan a fish population assessment was conducted during the week of 09/05/2000.  This assessment included six gill net sets, nine trap net sets, three shoreline seine hauls, and fifty minutes of night electrofishing.          Barring winter kill, anglers should expect quality fishing for walleye and northern pike.  While northerns were not overly abundant, they averaged 3.2 pounds and 24.1 inches.  Walleye were both abundant and large.  The 2000 net catch was the highest on record for Pomroy Lake with walleye averaging 19.8 inches and 2.8 pounds.  Black crappie were sampled in normal numbers with a 7.4 inch average.  Largemouth bass and bluegill populations were low.  Black bullheads were extremely abundant and small in size.  Other species present during the survey include;  golden shiner, creek chub, brown bullhead, yellow bullhead, rock bass, pumpkinseed, bluegill, painted turtle, and snapping turtle.  Other species present during the assessment include;   golden shiner, creek chub, brown bullhead, yellow bullhead, rock bass, pumpkinseed, painted turtle, and snapping turtle.                 Fishing pressure on Pomroy Lake is typically light with much of the summer pressure directed at crappies.  Winter pressure includes a high proportion of northern spearers.  The public access can accommodate up to 15 vehicles and has a cement ramp.   </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Pomroy is a 422 acre shallow, soft water lake assigned to lake class 39.  The shore is predominately sand with some silt.  Water clarity is generally good but the water is bog stained.  Pomroy is subject to frequent winter kills of varying degrees, the latest on record having occurred during the winter of 2000-01.  To reestablish game fish Pomroy Lake was stocked with walleye fry (211,500) and adult northern pike (105), largemouth bass (30), bluegill (40), and black crappie (40) in the spring of 2001.  In order to evaluate the goals of the Pomroy Lake management plan and to monitor the recovery of the fish population, a lake survey was conducted during the week of 09/06/2005.  This assessment included six gill net sets, nine trap net sets, twenty vegetation transects, and night electrofishing.     Barring winter kill, anglers should expect quality fishing for walleye, bass, and northern pike.  While none of the three were overly abundant, numbers are high enough to provide angler success.  Most bass were between 14 and 17 inches while walleye and northerns averaged 19.2 and 23.9 inches respectively.  Black crappie and bluegill numbers were typical for the lake type.  Bluegill size may be an issue with some anglers with only 14% over 7 inches in length.  Crappie averaged over 8 inches, a size acceptable to many anglers.  Yellow perch were scarce while bullheads were abundant.  Both were small on average.  Other species present during the survey included golden shiner, brown bullhead, yellow bullhead, and pumpkinseed sunfish.     Fishing pressure on Pomroy Lake has increased recently with much of the summer pressure directed at bass.  Winter pressure includes a high proportion of northern spearers.  The public access can accommodate up to 15 vehicles and has a cement ramp.   </p>",

Water color is bog stained but clarity is generally good.  Pomroy is subject to frequent winter kills of varying degrees, the latest on record having occurred during the winter of 2000-01.  To reestablish game fish Pomroy Lake was stocked with walleye fry (211,500) and adult northern pike (105), largemouth bass (30), bluegill (40), and black crappie (40) in the spring of 2001.  In order to evaluate the goals of the Pomroy Lake management plan and to monitor the recovery of the fish population, a population assessment was conducted during the week of 09/06/2010.  This assessment included six gill net sets, nine trap net sets, and night electrofishing. <br> \n <br> \nBarring winter kill, angling for walleye, bass, and northern pike is available.  While none of the three are overly abundant, numbers remain high enough to provide angler success.  Black crappie and bluegill numbers were typical for the lake type.  Bluegill size should be acceptable to most anglers with half the catch exceeding 7 inches in length.  Crappie averaged only 7.5 inches, but 12 inch fish are present.  The yellow perch abundance increased while bullheads numbers continue to diminish since the winter kill.  Most perch are below harvestable size but black bullheads averaged 11.1 inches.  Other species present during the survey included yellow bullhead and pumpkinseed sunfish. <br> \n      <br> \nFishing pressure on Pomroy Lake has increased recently with much of the summer pressure directed at panfish and bass.  Spearing remains a popular winter activity on the lake.  The public access can accommodate up to 15 vehicles and has a cement ramp.</p>",

IT REMAINS SUBSTANTIALLY ABOVE THE LOCAL MEDIAN (3.88/SET). NORTHERN PIKE GROWTH RATE FALLS IN THE NORMAL RANGE WITH GOOD YEAR CLASS REPRESENTATION. THE YELLOW PERCH POPULATION (60.33/SET) REMAINS VERY HIGH COMPARED TO THE LOCAL MEDIAN ( 24.27/SET). THE MEAN LENGTH OF YELLOW PERCH IS 6.7 INCHES. LARGEMOUTH BASS WERE NOT TAKEN IN TEST NETS BUT 4 YEARLINGS WERE RECORDED DURING SHORELINE SEINING SHORELINE SEINING DID NOT RECORD ANY YOY LARGE- MOUTH BASS. BLUEGILLS (1.67/SET) REMAIN AT VERY LOW LEVELS CONSISTENT WITH THER PREVIOUS SURVEY (2.50/SET). IN CONTRAST, PUMPKINSEEDS (54.33/SET) HAVE EXPANDED DRAMATICALLY FROM THE 1982 SURVEY (0.75/SET) TO A LEVEL FAR ABOVE THE LOCAL MEDIAN (5.40/SET). PUMPKINSEEDS RANGED FROM 5 INCHES TO 7.4 INCHES WITH A MEAN LENGTH OF 6.1 INCHES. BLACK CRAPPIES (10.33/SET) HAVE INCRASED SUBSTAN- TIALLY FROM 1982 (4.00/SET) BUT REMAIN BELOW THE LOCAL MEDIAN (18.45/SET). THE MEAN LENGTH OF BLACK CRAPPIES IS 7.8 INCHES. ALTHOUGH BLACK BULLHEADS (14.00/SET) REMAIN RELATIVELY CONSISTENT WITH THE PREVIOUS SURVEY (12.00/SET) IN THE TRAPNETS, THEY SHOW A PRO- NOUNCED DECLINE IN THE GILLNETS, 68.67/SET TO 2.33/SET RESPECTIVELY. YELLOW BULLHEADS (1.00/ SET), LOCAL MEDIAN 4.74/SET, AND BROWN BULLHEADS 10.00/SET, LOCAL MEDIAN 4.55/SET, DO NOT SHOW NOTEWORTHY CHANGES FROM THE PREVIOUS SURVEY. SIL- VER REDHORSE, GOLDEN REDHORSE, AND HYBRID SUNFISH WERE TAKEN IN SMALL NUMBERS FOR THE FIRST TIME DURING THE CURRENT SURVEY. A NUMBER OF SPECIES IN POMROY LAKE HAVE UNDERGONE EXTREME POPULATION FLUCTUATIONS SINCE THE FIRST SURVEY IN 1959 (SEE TEST NET SUMMARY PAGE). THESE FLUCTUATIONS ARE ASSUMED TO BE THE EFFECT, AT LEAST IN PART, OF VARYING DEGREES OF WINTERKILL ON DIFFERENT SPECIES AND THE CONSEQUENT DISRUPTION OF INTERRELATION- SHIPS. NOTE:  WALLEYE FRY STOCKED IN 1986 AND 1987 ARE NOT YET SUSCEPTIBLE TO TEST NET GEAR AND WILL BE EVALUATED IN THE 1990 POPULATION ASSESSMENT.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Pomroy is a 422 acre shallow, soft water lake assigned to lake class 39.  The shore is predominately sand with some silt.  Water color is bog stained but clarity is generally good.  Pomroy is subject to frequent winter kills of varying degrees, the latest on record having occurred during the winter of 2013-14.  To evaluate the recovery of the fishery, a lake survey was conducted the week of September 2nd 2019.  This assessment included six gill net sets, nine trap net sets, and night electrofishing. <br> \n <br> \nBarring winter kill, angling for Walleye, Largemouth Bass, and Northern Pike is available.  All three are fairly abundant and in sizes acceptable to most anglers.   Black Crappie and Bluegill are typical for the lake type but not especially numerous.  Few Bluegill exceeded 7 inches in length.  Crappie near twelve inches were caught but the sample size was not really large enough to generalize the size structure.  The Yellow Perch catch was low, possibly due to Pike and Walleye predation.  Other species present during the survey included Yellow and Black Bullhead, Golden Shiner, and Pumpkinseed Sunfish. <br> \n      <br> \nFishing pressure on Pomroy Lake is dependent on the duration since the last winterkill.   Recently much of the summer pressure has been directed at Panfish and Largemouth Bass.  Spearing remains a popular winter activity on the lake.  The public access can accommodate up to 10 vehicles and has a cement ramp.</p>",
