                "narrative": "<p>    Peavy Lake is a small, clear, relatively deep lake in northeast Morrison County.  The lake has a variety of offshore fishing structures for anglers such as points, sunken islands, and steep dropoffs as well as dense vegetation beds.  Water clarity was excellent with a secchi disk reading of 20 feet in late August.  Submergent vegetation was found down to a depth of 16 feet with largeleaf pondweed and Robbins' pondweed being the most common species.  Sand was the most common shallow water substrate around the lake.  Much of the lakeshore that can be developed has homes on it.  This lake survey does not have any fish report components because past surveys have shown that gillnets catch few fish in this lake at this time of year.  A black crappie assessment was conducted in late May to evaluate the fish community in the lake.  The fish management focus is on black crappie, bluegill, largemouth bass, and northern pike. <br> \n     Panfish probably provide the most important fishery on the lake and anglers have a chance to catch a crappie in a variety of sizes.   Crappies between 6 and 13 inches were seen in the spring assessment with the  average size being almost 9 inches.   The bluegill population size structure looked good with many of the fish in the spring assessment being over 6 inches in length with some up 8 inches being measured.  Some nice size pumpkinseed were also caught in the spring netting.  A few of the fish were over 9 inches and fish over 7 inches were common.  <br> \n     The average size of the northern pike seen in the spring assessment was about 19 inches or 2 pounds, although some nicer pike up to 33 inches were measured.   Peavy Lake has a low walleye population that appears to be sustained through natural reproduction since stocking was discontinued in 1988.  Only two walleye were caught in the spring assessment but they were nice ones between 21 and 25 inches in length.  Most of the largemouth bass caught by anglers are likely to be between 10 and 13 inches, however, trophy size bass have been measured in other assessments.  Only one yellow perch was caught in the spring assessment which could mean that abundance is low.  A healthy perch population is desirable as they can be an important food source for northern pike, walleye, and largemouth bass. <br> \n     All three species of bullhead, black, brown, and yellow, are present in Peavy Lake with the yellow bullhead being the most abundant.  Some of the brown bullheads were up to 15 inches in length, while the other two species had individuals up to 12 inches.  Anglers also have the opportunity to catch a bowfin or dogfish which could provide a good fight.  Dogfish can also be an efficient predator on small bluegills which could help keep the bluegill population in check.   <br> \n     Maintaining and protecting the water quality in Peavy Lake should be a high priority of the lakeshore land owners.  Buffer strips along the shoreline is encouraged to reduce nutrients entering the water.  Maintaining adequate septics, keeping grass clippings and raked leaves out of the lake, and common sense use of lawn fertilizers will also help reduce nutrient loading, thus slowing algae and excess weed growth.  Two websites which have some good information for shoreline property owners are: <br> \n <br> \nMPCA - \"Guide to Lake Protection & Management\" <br> \n   www.pca.state.mn.us/water/lakeprotection.html <br> \n <br> \nMinnesota Shoreline Management Resource Guide <br> \n   www.shorelandmanagement.org/index.html</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Peavy Lake (DOW# 49-0005-00; Lake Class 32) is a 140 acre lake located near Sullivan, Minnesota. A Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MNDNR) owned concrete boat ramp is located on the east shore. Peavy Lake has 2.71 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 63 feet. Lake is in Lake Class 32; lakes in this class are generally large, have a high amount of water less than 15 feet deep, turbid, and are an irregular shape. <br> \n <br> \nPeavy Lake is a multi-species lake that can offer a little something for every angler. Peavy Lake should be of most interest to panfish anglers. Good numbers of Bluegill were sampled with many over 7 inches and fish up to 9 inches. Also there were good numbers of Black Crappie with almost half larger than 9 inches and fish up to 12 inches. While not many Northern Pike and Walleye were sampled biologists did see some larger fish. Largemouth Bass were similar to past surveys with bass up to 19 inches. <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species that anglers can expect to encounter include Bowfin (Dogfish), Green Sunfish, Hybrid Sunfish, Pumpkinseed Sunfish, and Yellow Bullhead. <br> \n <br> \nPeople can have significant impacts on lakes and the fish populations they support. Fish harvest, lakeshore development, removal of shoreline vegetation, and introductions of aquatic invasive species (AIS) can all adversely affect fish populations. Curly Leaf Pondweed has been identified in Peavy Lake. AIS can be moved from infested to non-infested waters by anglers, boaters, and lake shore owners and can adversely impact lakes and fish populations. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access. If you suspect an infestation of an invasive species in this lake, save a specimen and report it to a local natural resource office. Additional information on all of these topics can be found on the DNR website (www.dnr.state.mn.us) or by contacting the Little Falls Area Fisheries office. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>     A panfish assessment was conducted on Peavy Lake in mid-May to evaluate the black crappie and bluegill populations.  Six standard lake survey trap nets were set and lifted twice for a total of 12 lifts.  Two of the trap nets were moved to new locations after the first lift in an attempt to improve the catch.  Panfish assessments conducted in 2006 and 2000 each had 18 lifts.  All fish were identified and measured in the 2012 assessment with scales taken from crappie and bluegill for age and growth data.  A scheduled population assessment using only gill nets was conducted in mid-August to evaluate the gamefish population. <br> \n     Ninety-one black crappie (7.6/TN) ranging from 4.7 to 11.8 inches in length were netted in the 2012 panfish assessment.   Mean length was 9.1 inches and modal length 8.5 -9 inches.   Fish exceeding nine inches in length comprised 48% (n=44) of the sample with 21% (n=19) more than ten inches.    Results from the 2012 panfish assessment were below the lake management goal of having at least 75% of the crappie in the spring assessment exceeding nines inches in length.  Ages 2 through 8 were represented in the 2012 panfish assessment with all age groups displaying normal growth when compared to an Area Mean Back-calculated Length table.    The dominant year class was 2007 (Age 5) which accounted for 48% of the sample. <br> \n     The panfish assessments in 2006 and 2000 produced catches of 252 crappie and 150 crappie, respectively.  The 2000 catch rate (8.3/TN) was comparable to the 2012 catch rate while the 2006 catch rate was higher (14/TN).  Both assessments caught crappie which exceeded thirteen inches in length.  Mean length in 2006 was comparable to that in 2012 at nine inches, while in 2000 mean length was 10.3 inches.  Size structure of the 2000 crappie sample was more desirable with 81% (n=121) of the fish exceeding nine inches, 42% (n=63) exceeding ten inches, and 9% (n=13) more than twelve inches in length.  Fish more than nine inches in length comprised 43% (n=107) of the 2006 catch with 12% (n=31) exceeding ten inches and 0.8% (n=2) exceeding twelve inches. <br> \n      The 2012 summer gill nets had a catch of 22 black crappie for a catch rate of 3.7/GN which was within the normal range for lake class 32 (interquartile range = 1 - 3.9/GN).   The fish ranged from 4.5 to 12.2 inches in length with a mean length of 8.8 inches.  Fish exceeding nine inches accounted for 43% (n=9) of the catch with 23% (n=5) more than ten inches and 4% (n=1) more than twelve inches in length.   <br> \n       Ten black crappie were also netted during the 2012 largemouth bass electrofishing assessment.  The fish measured from 8.9 to 11.9 inches in length with a mean length of 9.9 inches.  Ninety percent (n=9) of the crappie were over nine inches with 40% (n=4) more than ten inches in length.  Ages 5, 6, and 9 were represented.  Ages 5 and 6 displayed normal growth when compared to an Area Mean Back-calculated Length table.   Four of the fish were from the 2007 year class (Age 5) and five from 2006 year class (Age 6). <br> \n       Peavy's bluegill population has shown increasing improvement in size structure since the 2000 panfish assessment other than the absence of nine-inch bluegill in the last two spring assessments.   Portions of the catch exceeding seven inches have shown increases in the last two panfish assessments.  In 2000, 349 bluegill (19.4/TN) were caught with 7% (n=23) exceeding seven inches and 0.6% (n=2) exceeding both eight and nine inches.  In 2006, 648 bluegill (36.1/TN) were netted.  Fish more than seven inches accounted for 27% (n=178) of the catch, however, none of the fish exceeded eight inches.  The 2012 panfish assessment had a catch of 381 (31.8/TN) bluegill between 3.3 and 8.8 inches in length.  Fish exceeding seven inches comprised 36% (n=135) of the catch with 2% (n=7) more than eight inches in length.   <br> \n      Ages 2 through 9 were represented in the 2012 panfish assessment.  All of the age groups showed normal growth when compared to an Area Mean Back-calculated Length table.  Two year classes, 2007 (Age 5) and 2005 (Age 7), comprised over half (54%) of the catch.   Each year class contributed 27% of the sample.   <br> \n      Forty-nine bluegill were caught in the 2012 summer gill nets.  The fish measured from 3.8 to 8.1 inches in length with a mean length of 5.9 inches.  Only 14% (n=7) of the bluegill exceeded seven inches with 2% (n=1) more than eight inches in length.   <br> \n      Six northern pike and one walleye were also caught in the 2012 panfish assessment.  The pike ranged from 12.7 inches to 35.7 inches in length with a mean length of 19.5 inches.  All but one of the fish was less than 21 inches in length.  The walleye was 22.6 inches in length.  Other fish species sampled in the assessment included bowfin, brown bullhead, green sunfish, hybrid sunfish, pumpkinseed sunfish, and yellow bullhead.    <br> \n      The 2012 panfish assessment was more effective at sampling diversity in the fish community than the summer population assessment.  Ten fish species were caught in the spring assessment and seven species in the summer assessment.  Four species caught in the spring and not the summer included bowfin, green sunfish, hybrid sunfish, and pumpkinseed sunfish while largemouth bass were caught in the summer but not the spring netting.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Peavy Lake is a small (123 acres), fairly deep (63 feet), clear lake.  Thelake's low fertility and insufficient prey base limit the lake's productivecapacity.  The lake receives little recreational use and fishing pressure islight.     Northern pike numbers have remained fairly stable and continue to be atnormal levels for its lake type.  Twenty percent of the northern pike sampledwere larger than 24 inches.  Most anglers report catching small northerns withan occasional large pike.     Peavy Lake historically has had low numbers of yellow perch. No perch weresampled in the lake survey test nets during 1994 or in all previous nettings. Low adult perch abundance is a significant limiting factor on Peavy Lake becauselarge predators rely on perch or an alternative prey base for good growth.     The largemouth bass population appears to be maintaining itself at lowlevels and anglers reported fair bass fishing success.  Bass sampled in springelectrofishing ranged in size from 6.5 to 15.8 inches.     Bluegills are present in moderate numbers but small sunnies are abundant. Crappies continue to be present in average numbers for lakes similar to Peavy. Black crappies up to 3/4 pound are caught by anglers during the spring.     Walleyes are present in low numbers.  Annual fingerling stocking between1981 and 1988 failed to produce good fishing and this management wasdiscontinued.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>     Peavy Lake is a small, clear, relatively deep lake in northeast Morrison County.  The lake has a variety of offshore fishing structures for anglers such as points, sunken islands, and steep dropoffs as well as dense vegetation beds.  Water clarity is excellent with a secchi disk reading of 13.5 feet in late August.  Peavy  is a soft water lake meaning that it has less fertility than many lakes in the area resulting in lower population abundance for some species.  Much of the lakeshore suitable for development has homes present.  Fish management focus is on black crappie, bluegill, largemouth bass, and northern pike. <br> \n     Panfish probably provide the most important fishery on the lake and anglers have a chance to catch crappie in a variety of sizes.   Crappies between 4.5 and 12 inches were observed in the 2012 nets with the average size about 9 inches.   Bluegill in Peavy Lake average about six inches although some nicer fish up to almost nine inches were caught in both the summer assessment and a spring assessment.  Some nice size pumpkinseed sunfish were also caught in the spring netting.   <br> \n     Anglers looking for northern pike have the potential to catch some desirable sized fish as the average weight in the summer survey was about three pounds and several of the fish caught in 2012 were over thirty inches.   Peavy Lake has a low walleye population that appears to be sustained through natural reproduction as stocking was discontinued in 1988.  Only two walleye were caught in the summer and spring assessments and they were both around 22 inches.  Most of the largemouth bass caught by anglers are likely to be between 10 and 13 inches, however, trophy size bass have been measured in other assessments.   <br> \n     Yellow bullhead was the most abundant of the two bullhead species caught in the 2012 assessments.  Quality size individuals over thirteen inches were observed in both the yellow and brown bullhead catches.  Anglers also have the opportunity to catch a bowfin or dogfish which could provide a good fight.  Dogfish can also be an efficient predator on small bluegills which could help keep the bluegill population in check and reduce chances of stunting.   <br> \n     Maintaining and protecting the water quality in Peavy Lake should be a high priority of the lakeshore land owners.  Buffer strips along the shoreline are encouraged to reduce nutrients entering the water.  Maintaining adequate septic systems, keeping grass clippings and raked leaves out of the lake, and common sense use of lawn fertilizers will also help reduce nutrient loading, thus slowing algae and excess weed growth.   <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>    A special trapnet assessment targetting black crappies was conducted on Peavy Lake the week of May 23, 2006.  Six lake survey trapnets were set over a four day period for a total of 18 lifts.  A summer lake survey was scheduled toward the end of August but past surveys have shown that few fish are sampled during the summer surveys so no nets were set.  Adequate catches in spring time resulted in no summer netting being necessary.  Scales were taken from the black crappies, bluegill, and northern pike for age and growth data.  All of the gamefish were measured as well as most of the other species of fish.   <br> \n    A total of 252 black crappies were caught during the spring netting that ranged from 6 to 13.4 inches in length.  Modal length for the sample was 8.5 - 9 inches with a mean length of 9 inches, and 42% (n=106) of the fish exceeding 9 inches in length.  The lake management goal for Peavy Lake is to maintain a crappie population where at least 75% of the fish from spring netting exceed 9 inches in length.   A similar trapnetting effort in 2000 captured 150 crappies measuring between 7 and 13.5  inches in length.  Large fish dominated the sample as modal length for the catch was 10.5 - 11 inches, mean length 10.3 inches, and 81% (n=121) of the crappies were more than 9 inches in length.  The lake survey in 2000 sampled only 17 crappies in the trapnets for a catch rate of 1.9/set which was about normal when compared to past surveys and also fell within the normal range for the lake class.  The fish in the 2000 summer survey were much smaller than those seen in the spring.  The length range was between 4.3 and 10.8 inches while the mean length was 8.2 inches and only 39% (n=7) of the fish were over 9 inches in length.   Ages 3 - 9 were represented in the 2006 panfish assessment with the majority of age groups displaying normal growth.  The aged sample was dominated by the 2001 year class which accounted for 44% of the sample. <br> \n    A sample size of 649 bluegills was caught in the 2006 spring assessment.  The fish measured from 3 to 8 inches in length successfully documenting presence of desirable size fish.  Modal length of the catch was 7 - 7.5 inches, with a mean length of 6.3 inches, and 29% (n=189) of the fish exceeding 7 inches in length.  Fewer bluegills (n=350) were netted in the 2000 spring assessment and the size structure of the sample was dominated by smaller fish, however, a 9.4-inch bluegill was sampled.  Modal length for that sample was 5.5 - 6 inches with a mean length of 5.4 inches and only 7% (n=23) of the fish being over 7 inches in length.  Smaller fish were even more prevelent in the 2000 summer lake survey which historically has produced few fish over 7 inches.   Sampled were 155 bluegills in the trapnets between 3 and 7 inches in length with a modal length of 4.5 - 5 inches with a mean length of 5 inches.  Ages 4 - 11 were represented in the 2006 spring assessment with 61% of the aged sample being from 8 - 10 years of age.  Ages 4 - 7 displayed slow growth while the older fish showed normal growth. <br> \n    Netted along with the panfish were 25 northern pike ranging from 9 to 33 inches in length which was an adequate sample and documented large fish.  Mean length for the  fish in the sample was 19 inches and 16% (n=4) of the pike exceeded 24 inches.  The pike (n=17) in the 2000 spring crappie assessment were slightly bigger than in 2006.  The length frequency ranged from 12 to 36 inches with a mean length of 20.5 inches and 18% (n=3) of the fish exceeding 24 inches in length.  The 2000 lake survey sampled 20 pike in the gillnets and 13 pike in the trapnets.  The pike in the gillnet catch were from 14 to 35 inches while the fish in the trapnets were from 12 to 26 inches with mean lengths of 19 and 18 inches, respectively.   Fish more than 24 inches in length accounted for 25% (n=5) of the gillnet catch while those over 24 inches comprised only 7% (n=1) of the trapnet catch.  Ages 2 - 7 and 9 - 11 were represented in the 2006 panfish assessment with all of the age groups displaying slow growth. <br> \n    Another panfish species sampled in the lake was pumpkinseeds.  The 67 pumpkinseeds caught were between 4 and 9 inches in length indicating quality.  Modal length for the sample was 7.5 - 8 inches with a mean length of 7.5 inches and 73% (n=49) of the fish exceeding 7 inches.  The 2000 spring assessment captured 64 pumpkinseeds but only 3 of the biggest fish were measured.  The 2000 lake survey trapnets caught only 29 pumpkinseeds which measured from 4 to 8 inches in length. <br> \n    Other fish species sampled in the 2006 spring assessment were black bullheads, bowfin (dogfish), brown bullheads, hybrid sunfish, largemouth bass, walleye, yellow bullheads, and yellow perch.  Yellow bullheads were the most numerous of the three species of bullheads.  Brown bullheads were the biggest, growing to a length of 14.6 inches with blacks measured to 11.7 inches and yellows to 12.3 inches.  The biggest bass measured of the three caught was only 12.8 inches while the biggest walleye of the two caught was almost 25 inches. <br> \n    An Area Mean Back-calculated Length Table was used to compare growth rates.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Peavy Lake is a small (123 acres), relatively deep (63 foot maximum), infertile lake in northeast Morrison County.  Water clarity was excellent at 16.2 feet even in late summer.  The lake's low fertility and limited prey base resticts the lake's productive capacity.  Lake management focus has been on largemouth bass, northern pike, and black crappies.       The northern pike population displayed some desirable characteristics in the summer survey.  The pike gillnet catch was low for the lake type while the size structure of the sample displayed an improvement since the last survey.  Twenty-five percent of the pike sampled were larger than 24 inches in length, with individual up to 35 inches observed.  Peavy Lake historically has had low numbers of yellow perch.  Presence of the perch have been noted in predator fish stomachs and natural reproduction checks although none have ever been documented in lake survey test nets.  Low adult perch abundance could be a limiting factor in growth rates for predator fish such as pike, walleye, and bass.  The low northern pike population may encourage an increase in yellow perch.     Peavy has a good largemouth bass population.  Abundance appeared normal when compared to similar types of lakes.  While the average bass size in the sampling efforts was 12 inches, fish up to 16 inches were observed.     Black crappies and bluegills are the two main panfish species in the lake.  Net catches for both species exhibited normal abundance when compared to similar types of lakes.  Crappies can be a difficult species to sample with standard lake survey gear.  A spring netting targetting crappies sampled fish up to 13.5 inches with the average crappie size being 10 inches.  Crappies in the lake seem to be most targetted by fishermen in the spring while the fish are in the shallow water for spawning.  A small area of the lake has been posted to no fishing to protect some the fish while they are on their spawning beds.  Bluegills should provide more fishing action than the crappies, however,  finding \"trophy\" size fish could be a challenge.  The population seems to be dominanted by medium size bluegills, 4 - 6.5 inches inches in length, however, fish up to 9 inches were documented.     Walleye continue to be present in low numbers in the lake despite discontinued stocking in 1988.  The population appears to be sustained by low natural reproduction.  Annual fingerling stocking between 1981 and 1988 failed to produce better fishing or an increased gillnet catch, prompting the discontinuation of the management strategy.     Other species providing angling opportunties include black bullheads, bowfin or dogfish, brown bullheads, hybrid sunfish, pumpkinseeds, and yellow bullheads.  Pumpkinseeds, a sunfish species, up to 9 inches in length were observed along with good size bullheads up to almost 13 inches.     Neascus or black spot was common on several of the fish species, northern pike, largemouth bass, bluegills, and pumpkinseeds.  Neascus is a trematode or parasite that is usually found in the skin of the fish.  The life cycle of the parasite also includes snails and fish-eating birds, such as herons and bitterns.  Skinning the fish removes most of the parasites and cooking will kill the rest.  Human cannot be infested.      Fish in Peavy Lake exhibit slow growth probably due to the low lake fertility.  Anglers are encouraged to release the larger individuals of each species to maintain a balanced fish community.  With Peavy Lake being small and infertile, panfish grow slow.  To prevent overharvest of the panfish populations, please keep only enough fish for a meal.  Protecting Peavy Lake's water quality should be a high priorty for lakeshore owners.  Non-conforming septics should be brought up to code and zoning regulations followed.  Keeping grass clippings and raked leaves out of the lake, along with using zero phosphorus lawn fertilizer would help reduce nitrogen and phosphorous leaching into the lake, thus reducing algae and excess vegetation growth.  Buffer strips along the shoreline would also slow runoff and trap nutrients and sediment before they enter the lake. </p>",
