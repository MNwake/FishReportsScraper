Most of the shoreline is state forest lands, but some of the eastern and southern shore is private.   <br> \n <br> \nA survey of the fish community in Green Bass Lake was conducted in mid-July 2017.  Two gill nets and six trap nets were set on July 17 and lifted on July 18.  Bluegills and northern pike were the most common fish in the gill nets.  Trap net catches were dominated by bluegills.  Bluegills captured in the trap nets ranged from 2.9 to 8.0 inches long with an average length of 4.2 inches.  Northern pike captured in the gill nets ranged from 15.2 to 31.7 inches with an average length of 19.1 inches.  Only 2 of the 12 black crappies captured were greater than 8 inches long.  Four of the seven largemouth bass caught in the gill nets were fairly large at around 15 to 17 inches long.  Other species captured in low numbers were brown bullheads, golden shiners, and hybrid sunfish.   <br> \n</p>",
