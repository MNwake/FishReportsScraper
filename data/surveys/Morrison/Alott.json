Fish species are not as varied as other lakes, but goodangling opportunities exist.  Species that could interest an angler includemuskellunge, walleye, northern pike, largemouth bass, smallmouth bass, andpumpkinseed. A creel survey has been ongoing since 1991 using postcards providedto anglers requesting access to the lake.  Annual walleye stocking provides afishery with a wide range of sizes and weights.  However, creel data showed thatnorthern pike were the most commonly caught gamefish.  Northern pike over 24 incheswere common in the assessment, while some anglers report catching pike over 36inches in past years.  Although no muskies were caught in this assessment, fishexceeding 40 inches have been reported.  A catch and release policy for muskie wasadopted by the Camp Commander in 1991 to protect the fishery.  Muskie stocking anduse as brood fish lake was terminated in 1991.  Both species of bass are presentin the lake, however, evaluation of the populations is difficult with standard lakesurvey gear.  While most fishermen chose to pursue the larger gamefish in the lake,an excellent pumpkinseed population does exist.  Sunfish up to eight inches weresampled in the assessment and fish over six inches are common.  Yellow perch, white suckers, and black bullheads are also present.</p>",
