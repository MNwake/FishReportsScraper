                "narrative": "<p>Catches from 1998 gill nets consisted of six primary fish species: Yellow Perch (26.4/gill net), Northern Pike (8.8/gill net), Black Crappie (4.6/gill net), Walleye (3.4/gill net), Black Bullhead (49.4/gill net), and Yellow Bullhead (31.8/gill net).  Northern Pike, Black Bullhead, and Yellow Bullhead numbers were above the range of expected values for lakes similar to Ramsey, Yellow Perch numbers were slightly below the range of expected values, and Walleye numbers were within the expected range for similar lakes.The gill net catch for Yellow Perch decreased from 98.3/gill net in 1992 to 26.4/gill net in 1998, and average weight per fish decreased from 0.2 to 0.1 pounds.  Yellow Perch caught in 1998 ranged in length from 5.0 to 8.5 inches, with an average length of 6.0 inches.  Yellow Perch growth was average compared to other Minnesota lakes as Age 2, 3, and 4 fish reached 5.7, 6.5, and 7.6 inches, respectively. The gill net catch for Northern Pike increased from 3.5/gill net in 1992 to 8.8/gill net in 1998; however, average weight decreased from 3.5 pounds to 2.8 pounds.  Northern Pike in 1998 ranged in length from 17.0 to 29.0 inches with an average length of 22.2 inches.  Growth was above average for Minnesota lakes as Age 2, 3, 4, and 5 fish reached 19.3, 21.1, 23.5, and 26.4 inches, respectively. The gill net catch for Walleye remained similar with 3.5/gill net in 1992 and 3.4/gill net in 1998; however, average weight increased from 1.7 pounds to 2.1 pounds.  Walleye in 1998 ranged in length from 11.5 to 26.0 inches with an average length of 17.4 inches. Growth was above average for Minnesota lakes as individuals reached 15.0 and 22.1 inches by Age 2 and 5.  Walleye fingerling survival was documented from fish stocked in Ramsey Lake in 1993 and 1996, as these two year classes were found in the 1998 nets.  Trap net catches in 1998 consisted of six main fish species: Bluegill (72.5/trap net), Yellow Perch (7.7/trap net), Black Crappie (5.1/trap net), Pumpkinseed (4.0/trap net), Hybrid Sunfish (3.1/trap net), and Green Sunfish (2.9/trap net).  Bluegill, Pumpkinseed, Yellow Perch and Green Sunfish abundance were above expected values for lakes similar to Ramsey Lake, whereas Black Crappie abundance was within the range of expected values. The trap net catch for Bluegill increased from 10.0/trap net in 1992 to 72.5/trap net in 1998; however, average weight decreased from 0.2 pounds to 0.1 pounds.  Bluegill in 1998 ranged in length from 3.0 to 7.0 inches, with an average length of 5.2 inches. Growth was above average when compared to other Minnesota lakes as Age 1 through 4 fish reached 3.4, 4.4, 5.9, and 5.9 inches, respectively. The trap net catch for Black Crappie increased from 3.0/trap net in 1992 to 5.1/trap net in 1998; however, average weight decreased from 0.3 pounds to 0.1 pounds.  Fish caught in 1998 ranged in length from 4.5 to 9.0 inches, with an average length of 5.9 inches.  Black Crappie growth in 1998 was above average for Minnesota lakes as Age 1, 2, and 3 fish reached 5.0, 7.6, and 9.2 inches, respectively.The trap net catch for Pumpkinseed increased from 2.7/trap net in 1992 to 4.0/trap net in 1998. Pumpkinseed caught in 1998 ranged in length from 3.5 to 6.0 inches, with an average length of 5.1 inches.  The trap net catch for Hybrid Sunfish increased from 1.0/trap net in 1992 to 3.1/trap net in 1998. Hybrid Sunfish caught in 1998 ranged in length from 3.0 to 6.5 inches with an average length of 5.3 inches.  Largemouth Bass in Ramsey Lake were caught by night electrofishing during spring.  The electrofishing catch rate for Largemouth Bass was 21.5/hour, with an average weight of 1.4 pounds.  Largemouth Bass in 1998 ranged in length from 6.0 to 20.0 inches, with an average length of 12.3 inches. Largemouth Bass growth was slightly above average for Age 1, 2, 3, 7, and 8 as fish reached 5.6, 7.7, 11.2, 17.5, and 18.9 inches, respectively, while Age 4 and 6 growth was average.  Of the catchable Largemouth Bass (larger than 8 inches), 55% were longer than 12 inches and 35% were longer than 15 inches.</p>",

Ten sampling sites were evenly spaced around the shoreline and each site was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining, except one site where soft sediments prevented the use of a seine. Nearshore sampling captured 24 species of fish, including several species that are intolerant of shoreline disturbance and/or poor water quality (Banded Killifish, Blacknose Shiner, Blackchin Shiner, Iowa Darter, Least Darter, and Pugnose Shiner). <br> \n <br> \nThe near shore fish survey data will be combined with gill net and trap net data from a July 2017 survey to describe the fish community and provide a fish based Index of Biotic Integrity (FIBI) score based on expectations for similar lakes. The FIBI score for Ramsey Lake is above an impairment threshold developed for similar lakes. <br> \n <br> \nThis survey is contributing to a watershed assessment process in coordination with the MN Pollution Control Agency. Ramsey Lake is located in the North Fork Crow River Watershed.</p>",

Forage species included: White Sucker, Yellow Perch, Golden, Blacknose, and Spottail Shiners, Bluntnose Minnow, Banded Killifish, Iowa and Johnny Darters. Other species found were: Bowfin, Common Carp, Black, Yellow and Brown Bullhead, Green Sunfish, Pumpkinseed, and Hybrid Sunfish. \n\nWalleye, Largemouth Bass, Yellow Perch, Green Sunfish, Pumpkinseed, and Hybrid Sunfish catches indicated high populations, because catch rates were above the expected range of values for area lakes. The populations of Northern Pike, Bluegill, Black Crappie, White Sucker, Bowfin, Common Carp, and Black Bullhead were average and fell within the range of expected values for area lakes.  The Yellow Bullhead catch was lower than the expected range for area lakes, indicating a low population. Only two Brown Bullheads were caught, indicating a low population. \n\nThe Northern Pike catch was lower than the 1980 assessment, but similar to 1974 and 1955 and growth was below average. Northern Pike ranged in length from 8.3-27.5 inches with the 1982 and 1983 year classes making up 55% of the catch. The strength of these two year classes may be the result of adult stocking in 1983-85. Bluegill exhibited below average growth and ranged in length from 2.8-9.4 inches. Bluegill represented year classes 1978-85 except for 1980, with 44% from the 1985 year class. Numbers were similar to 1980, but much lower than 1974. \n\nLargemouth Bass numbers were up from 1980 and represented three year classes, with the 1985 year class making up 50% of the total. Spring seining of 2.0 acres captured 26 Largemouth Bass for a total of 13 per acre seined. Largemouth Bass from this sample represented 1979-85 year classes. Largemouth Bass caught in summer nets exhibited average growth, whereas the spring sample had below average growth. The Black Crappie catch was close to 1980 but down from 1955. Five year classes were caught, with the 1983 year class making up 68% of the sample. Crappies averaged 7.5-7.9 inches and had below average growth. Walleye numbers increased from previous nettings. Walleye had average growth, with lengths ranging from 12.9-18.2 inches and an average of 14 inches. All Walleye aged were from the 1983 year class and represented a fingerling stocking. Natural reproduction is apparently lacking in Ramsey Lake.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Ramsey Lake is a 275-acre recreational development lake located on the south side of the City of Maple Lake in central Wright County.  It has a maximum depth of 80 feet and water clarity of 2.7 feet.  The aquatic plant community was diverse and vegetation grew to a depth of nine feet.  Since Eurasian water milfoil was discovered it has now become abundant and was found on 95% of plant survey transects.  Curled pondweed, another exotic plant species, grew over 4.8 acres, 1.5% of the lakes\u0019 surface. <br> \n <br> \nRamsey Lake has a history of walleye stocking.  After the 1998 survey, fry were stocked for two years.  However, fall electrofishing surveys showed little fry survival so fingerling stocking every other year was resumed.  Ramsey Lake was first surveyed in 1955.  This was the first survey since 1998. <br> \n <br> \nRamsey Lake is considered to be a \"good fishing lake.\"  It consistently provides crappie and sunfish angling.  If an angler were looking for good bass, northern pike and walleye fishing all together, Ramsey Lake would be the place to go.  <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass were captured by night electrofishing in June 2008.  The catch rate exceeded the normal rate for area lakes by 30 percent.  Bass up to 20 inches can be found though an average fish might be 12 inches long.  <br> \n <br> \nThe average northern pike was 25 inches long and weighed 3.5 pounds.   More than half of the northern pike were longer than 24 inches.  This percentage is much better than average and better than some lakes that are regulated for quality northern pike. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye numbers increased significantly in the 10 years between surveys.  The gill net catch of walleye (8.5/gill net) exceeds the range of normal values for lakes similar to Ramsey.  These fish were the result of the successful fingerling stocking in 2005.  The average walleye was 18 inches long and weighed two pounds. <br> \n   <br> \nIf there is a concern for the fishery it would be for the yellow perch.  Catch rates have declined significantly.  Yellow perch are frequently cyclic in abundance but this population needs to increase in order to balance the fish community.  <br> \n <br> \nSunfish net catches were within the range of expected values but black crappies were not.  Other species sampled during the survey included: black, brown and yellow bullheads, bowfin, carp, golden shiner, hybrid, green and pumpkinseed sunfish, white sucker, and rock bass.  The first channel catfish was reported for Ramsey Lake.</p>",

The Ramsey Lake watershed is 6,037 acres with land use consisting of 38% agriculture, 22% marsh/open water, 14% forest, 13% residential, 11% pasture, and 2% grassland. A standard survey was conducted in 2017 to monitor changes in the fishery from the last survey completed in 2008.  <br> \nRamsey Lake has a diverse aquatic plant community. While no submerged plant survey was conducted in 2017, the last submerged plant survey conducted in 2008 found 24 species of aquatic plants growing to a depth of  nine feet. Coontail, sago pondweed, and Eurasian watermilfoil were the most common. Emergent and floating-leaf plants were mapped in 2017 and found to cover 47% of the shoreline. Species found were cattail spp. (54 acres), white waterlily (4 acres), and bulrush spp. (0.1 acres). <br> \n <br> \nRamsey Lake is considered to be a \"good fishing lake\" and consistently provides crappie and sunfish angling.  If an angler were looking for good bass, Northern Pike and Walleye fishing all together, Ramsey Lake would be the place to go.  <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass were captured by night electrofishing in May 2017. The catch rate in 2017 exceeded the average catch rate for lakes in the Sauk Rapids Management area and was similar to the rate observed in 2008. Bass up to 19 inches can be found though the average fish runs about 12 inches. <br> \n <br> \nThe average Northern Pike was 24 inches long and weighed 3.4 pounds. Thirty eight percent of the Northern Pike were longer than 24 inches and 15 percent were longer than 30 inches. This percentage is much better than average and even better than some of our lakes that are regulated for quality Northern Pike. <br> \n <br> \nRamsey Lake has been stocked with Walleye fingerlings every other year for several decades. Walleye numbers decreased significantly since 2008 but remained within the range of expected values for the lake class. The average Walleye was 20 inches long and weighed 3.7 pounds. Growth of Walleye was fast as stocked fish grew to nearly 20 inches in four years. <br> \n <br> \nThe catch of Yellow Perch increased from the 2008 survey but remained well below the lake's long term average. Yellow Perch are often cyclic in abundance but this population needs to increase in order to balance the fish community. <br> \n  <br> \nThe catch rate of Bluegill was similar to the last survey in 2008 and typical for lakes with similar characteristics. The average length of Bluegill (five inches) was small but fish up to nine inches were sampled. The catch rate of Black Crappie was also similar to 2008 and remained below the range of expected values. Although the average length of Black Crappie was relatively small (under eight inches), fish up to 15 inches were sampled. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled during the survey included: Bowfin (dogfish), Common Carp, Golden Shiner, Green Sunfish, Hybrid Sunfish, Pumpkinseed Sunfish, and Yellow Bullhead. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Principal species captured in gill nets included: Northern Pike, Walleye, Yellow Perch, and White Sucker.  High numbers of Bluegill, Black Crappie, and Black Bullhead, Yellow Bullhead, and Brown Bullhead, were caught in gill nets and in trap nets.  The Northern Pike catch rate (3.5/gill net) was within the range of expected values for lakes similar to Ramsey. Growth rates for Northern Pike were average, whereas average weight (3.5 pounds) was above average.  Northern Pike from 5 year classes (age 1-6) were caught and lengths ranged from 19 to 30 inches.  The Northern Pike population appears stable when compared with historical netting data.  The Walleye catch dropped significantly from 6.3/gill net in 1986 (which was above the expected range), to 3.5/gill net (which was just above the average value).  Average weight (1.7 pounds) was within the range of expected values, and growth rates were average compared to statewide data.  Three year classes (ages 2, 3, and 6) with lengths from 10 to 26 inches were represented and all related to recent fingerling stockings. Yellow Perch (98.3/gill net) numbers were higher than the range of expected values for similar lakes. \n\nThe Yellow Perch catch rose significantly between the 1980 and 1986 assessments (from 1.0 to 193/gill net) and dropped significantly from 1986 to 1993.  Yellow Perch average weight (0.18 pounds) was above the range of expected values.  White Sucker (2.0/gill net) numbers were also above the expected range, whereas average weight (1.1 pounds) was below the expected range of values. White Sucker net catches have been stable over time.  \n\nThe trap net catch of Bluegill (10.0/trap net) was below the expected range for similar lakes, but gill net numbers (14.0/trap net) were above the expected range.  In this instance, gill net catch might be a better indicator of population status, as Bluegill appear to be abundant from angler catches. Average weight of Bluegill (0.23 pounds) was above the expected range for both gear types (gill net and trap net), and the most common length was seven inches.  Black Crappie catch and average weight were within the range of expected values for both types of gear.  Black Crappie lengths ranged from 6.5 to 9.5 inches.  Anglers reported good catches during winter and spring.  The trap net catch of Black Bullhead (2.0/trap net) was below the expected range, whereas average weight (0.8 pounds) was above the expected range.  \n\nYellow Bullhead and Brown Bullhead catches (10.0/trap net and 2.5/trap net, respectively) were above the range of expected values.  Average weight for Yellow Bullhead (0.5 pounds) was below the expected range, whereas average weight for Brown Bullheads (1.2 pounds) was above the expected range.  The Largemouth Bass catch (0.5/trap net) and average weight (0.25 pounds) were within the expected range.  Twelve Largemouth Bass, from young-of-year to six years old (up to 16 inches), were caught.  Growth was average compared to other Minnesota lakes, and the catch has remained stable over time.  Other species captured included Common Carp, Green Sunfish, Pumpkinseed, Hybrid Sunfish, and Bluntnose Minnow.\n</p>",
