                "narrative": "<p>Sylvan Lake is a small impoundment of Canby Creek, located within the city limits of Canby.  Due to its location it receives a high amount of fishing pressure, particularly by children.  Many of the fish in Sylvan Lake likely originated in Del Clark Lake a short distance upstream.  Fisheries management activities include netting surveys and adult game fish stockings.  Curly-leaf pondweed was discovered in Sylvan Lake in 2010.  By 2011, it was abundant and covered the entire basin.  The lake was treated with herbicide in 2012 and 2014 to reduce curly-leaf abundance in order to improve fishing opportunity.  The treatments were temporarily successful, but in 2016 dense vegetation was again present from late spring through summer. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappies, Bluegills, Northern Pike, Walleyes, and Yellow Perch were caught in low numbers during 2016.  Recent stockings include adult Walleyes, Northern Pike and Yellow Perch during 2015, and adult Walleyes during 2016.  Sylvan Lake will continue to be managed as a Kids Fishing Pond and annual stockings of adult game fish are planned.</p>",

THE 1985 INITIAL STREAM SURVEY AND 1987 STREAM POPULATION ASSESSMENTS ON CANBY CREEK SAMPLED ALL MINNOW AND DARTER SPECIES CURRENTLY PRESENT IN SYLAN RESERVOIR.  THE 1988 POPULATION ASSESSMENT ON DEL CLARK RESERVOIR SAMPLED RBT, WTS, BLB, GSF, BLG, LMB, BLC ,YEP AND WAE.  ONLY BLG ADULTS HAVE BEEN STOCKED INTO SYLVAN RESERVOIR, YET ALL THE OTHER SPECIES WERE COLLECTED IN THE 1990 SAMPLES.  FOUR RBT RANGING IN LENGTH FROM 10.3 TO 12.1 INCHES WERE SAMPLED IN 1/4 INCH TRAPNETS IN AUGUST OF 1990.  THESE FISH WERE AGE 1+ ADULTS WITH FAST GROWTH RATES.  THEIR AGE AND SIZES CORRESPOND TO STOCKING AND GROWTH PATTERNS SEEN IN DEL CLARK RESERVOIR INVESTIGATIONS.  TWO AGE 1+ BLC RANGING IN LENGTH FROM 5.6 TO 6.4 INCHES WERE SAMPLED IN 1/4 INCH TRAPNETS.  GROWTH RATE WAS AVERAGE WHEN COMPARED WITH STATE SIDE AVERAGES.  TWO YOUNG OF THE YEAR (YOY) LMB, 3.2 AND 3.4 INCHES LONG AND THREE YOY WHITE CRAPPIES WERE ALSO SAMPLED IN AUGUST 1/4 INCH TRAPNETTING.  WHILE THE ORIGIN OF THE LMB COULD BE DEL CLARK RESERVOIR, THE PRESENCE OF WHC IN THE CANBY CREEK STREAM SYSTEM HAS NEVER BEFORE BEEN DOCUMENTED.  THE MOST NUMEROUS GAME SPECIES SAMPLED IN THE 1990 INITIAL LAKE SURVEY WAS YEP.  TWENTY FIVE PERCH FROM THREE YEAR CLASSES, 1987 (AGE 3+) WERE SAMPLED DURING BOTH THE MAY SURVEY NETTING AND AUGUST NATURAL REPRODUCTION SAMPLING.  CATCH RATES OF 3.5 FISH AND 5.0 POUNDS PER TRAPNET SET ARE 2.3 AND 2.6 TIMES THE STATE AND 5.0 AND 4.0 TIMES LOCAL TRAP- NET CATCH MEDIANS.  GROWTH RATES FOR ALL YEAR CLASSES WERE FAST, MORE THAN 20% GREATER THAN STATE WIDE AVERAGES.  MAXIMUM TOTAL LENGTHS AT CAPTURE RANGED FROM 3.9 TO 9.7 INCHES WITH A MEAN LENGTH AND WEIGHT AT CAPTURE OF 8.2 INCHES AND 0.2 POUNDS.  THREE YOY PERCH, 2.3 TO 2.5 INCHES IN LENGTH AND 25 ADDITIONAL AGE 1+ FISH WERE SAMPLED IN THE NATURAL REPRODUCTION NETTING IN AUGUST. FOUR OF THESE AGE 1+ YELLOW PERCH APPEAR IN THE DISBCAL LENGTH AT CAPTURE AND BACK CALCULATED LENGTH TABLES AND AGE AND GROWTH RATE TABLES FOUND ON PAGE NINE.  THESE FISH DO NOT APPEAR IN AGE CLASS DISTRIBUTION OR LENGTH FREQUENCY TABLES BECAUSE WHOLE NET SUBSAMPLES WERE NOT MEASURED FROM THIS SAMPLING GEAR.  A TOTAL OF FIVE ADULT WAE FROM 17.0 TO 18.2 INCHES IN LENGTH WERE SAMPLED FROM SYLVAN RESERVOIR.  THESE FISH WERE ALL FROM THE 1986 (AGE 4+) YEAR CLASS.  GROWTH RATES WERE AVERAGE WHEN COMPARED TO OTHER LAKES STATE WIDE, BUT SLOW WHEN COMPARED TO WAE POPULATIONS FROM OTHER LOCAL AREA LAKES.  MEAN LENGTH AND WEIGHT AT CAPTURE WAS 17.9 INCHES AND 2.1 POUNDS.  THESE FISH APPEAR TO CORRESPOND TO A 1986 WAE FRY STOCKING IN DEL CLARK RESERVOIR.  ALL AVAILABLE EVIDENCE FROM PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS, STOCKING RECORDS AND FIELD OBSERVATIONS INDICATE THAT THE FISHERY OF SYLVAN RESERVOIR IS PRESENTLY AND WILL IN THE FUTURE CONTINUE TO BE INFLUENCED BY FISH SPECIES WHICH ARE PRESENT IN THE CANBY CREEK WATERSHED AND DEL CLARK RESERVOIR.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Sylvan Lake is a small (15 acre) impoundment of Canby Creek located within the city of Canby.  It is a shallow (7 foot maximum depth), muck-bottom reservoir that contains only marginal game fish habitat.  Historic population assessments have indicated an absence of self-sustaining game fish populations.     In the fall of 1998, approximately 3,000 channel catfish (CCF) fingerlings, a species more tolerant of degraded habitat, were stocked into Sylvan Lake.  This stocking apparently failed, as no catfish were caught during a 1999 special assessment.  The failure may have been caused by disease.  The hatchery from which the fingerlings were obtained experienced 100% mortality in the remaining catfish due to Henneguya, an internal protozoan disease.  A considerable increase of black crappie, walleye and yellow perch was documented.  This increase was likely due to a draw-down of Del Clark lake during the summer of 1999.  Del Clark Lake is less than a mile upstream of Sylvan Lake (Canby Creek), and migration of fish into Sylvan could have easily occurred.     Approximately 3,000 channel catfish (CCF) were stocked into Sylvan Lake in the fall of 1999.  Three catfish were caught during the 2000 assessment, suggesting poor survival of the 1999 stocking.  However, this may have been incorrect because anglers commented that they had caught numerous catfish while fishing during the 2000 season.  Population assessments scheduled for 2001-2003 will further document the success of the 1999 stocking.       Black crappie were moderately abundant (10.9/trap net) in 2000.  This catch rate was similar to the 1999 catch rate, but considerably higher than those of the previous three assessments (1998, 1994, 1990).  Most fish were small (6.5-7.0 inches), although a few 9.0-10.5 inch fish were also caught.  Future assessments should determine the age and growth potential of the black crappie population in Sylvan Lake.     Walleye and yellow perch were found in low abundance in the 2000 assessment.  Their catch rates were also similar to 1999's, and higher than the three previous assessments.  Walleye size varied widely, with the largest being 24 inches.  Yellow perch size also varied, with the largest being 10.5 inches.       Eight northern pike were caught during the 2000 assessment.  No more than two pike had been caught in any previous assessment.  The pike ranged in size from 22.0 to 32.7 inches.       Black bullhead were moderately abundant.  The bullhead ranged from 6.0-8.5 inches, and probably would not offer a quality fishing opportunity.       A natural reproduction assessment of Sylvan Lake indicated that no or very poor natural reproduction of any fish species occurred in 2000.  Therefore, it appears the the majority of game fish have migrated from Del Clark Lake.      Other fish species caught in low abundance include orangespotted sunfish, white sucker, common shiner and bluntnose minnow.              Fishery management plans for Sylvan Lake include stocking 3,000 additional CCF fingerlings in 2001, population assessments from 2001-2003 to evaluate fisheries management, and annual winter monitoring of dissolved oxygen and fishing pressure. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Sylvan Lake is a small impoundment of Canby Creek located within the Canby city limits.  Although self-sustaining gamefish populations have not become establisted in Sylvan Lake due to its marginal habitat, past assessments have found that fish migration from Del Clark Lake has provided some angling opportunities.  Because of its high angler use, recent management of Sylvan Lake has focused on supplementing this migration by stocking various fish species.     Adult bluegill were stocked in 2003.  Most stocked bluegill stocked were stunted and measured less than 5 inches.  According to test nets in 2004, stocked bluegill had improved growth and had survived in good numbers.  Nearly half of the bluegill sampled measured over six inches in 2004.  Because of the lack of natural reproduction, bluegill anglers are encouraged to limit harvest to individuals greater than seven inches.  This would allow a quality bluegill fishery to be sustained over a longer period of time.     Adult northern pike were also stocked in 2003.  Stocked northern measured 21-24 inches.  Although few northerns were sampled in test nets, anglers reported fair catches during late spring.      Channel catfish were stocked in 1998, 1999 and 2001.  Except in 2000, catfish have not been sampled in test nets.  However, anglers have reported numerous catfish catches in each year, including 2004.  According to anglers, catfish caught in 2004 weighed over one pound.     Migration from Del Clark accounted for the black crappie, walleye and yellow perch sampled in Sylvan Lake.  Walleye were the most numerous, and individuals up to 14 inches were sampled.  Management plans include stocking additional adult walleye in 2005.  Anglers should keep only a few walleye to eat, and release the rest.  As with bluegill, this will sustain the walleye fishery over a longer period of time.     Management plans for Sylvan Lake will focus on frequent assessment and stocking of various game fish based upon availability and need.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Sylvan Lake is a small impoundment of Candy Creek located within the city limits of Canby.   Due to its location it receives a high amount of fishing pressure, particularly by youth.  Past investigations have indicated that migration from Del Clark Lake has primarily been responsible for game fish populations in Sylvan Lake.   Management efforts have included stocking adult walleye and northern pike as part of a put and take fishery.  Curly-leaf pondweed was discovered in Sylvan Lake in 2010.  By 2011, it was abundant and covered the entire basin.  A whole lake treatment was conducted in 2012 in an effort to reduce vegetation abundance to enhance fishing opportunity.  The treatment successfully reduced vegetation abundance and will be repeated in 2014. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie, bluegill, northern pike, walleye, and yellow perch were all sampled in low abundance in 2013.  Adult northern pike and walleye were stocked in the fall of 2013.  If available, adult northern pike and walleye will be stocked again in the spring of 2014 to increase recreational opportunity.  Annual stockings of adult black crappie, bluegill, northern pike or walleye will be conducted when deemed necessary and are available. <br> \n</p>",

It is a shallow, muck-bottomed, turbid reservoir containing only marginal game fish habitat.  A 1990 initial survey reported poor to fair spawning areas for game fish species.  Fish management has centered on production of self- sustaining bluegill and largemouth bass populations.  A 1990 introductory bluegill stocking apparently failed because no bluegill were sampled during June sampling.  Bluegill were sampled during a natural reproduction check in July which occurred after an upstream reservoir containing bluegill was drained through Sylvan Lake.  The MN DNR plans to continue monitoring Sylvan Reservoir for the development of a self-sustaining bluegill population.  If one develops, largemouth bass may be introduced to provide additional angling opportunities, and to act as a predatory control on bluegill in an attempt to maintain a bluegill population of desirable abundance and size structure.  If bluegill cannot be successfully managed at Sylvan Lake, considering the habitat limitations, black bullhead will likely become the primary species managed to provide angling opportunities.       </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Sylvan Lake is a small impoundment of Canby Creek located within the city of Canby.  It is a shallow, muck-bottomed reservoir that contains only marginal game fish habitat.  Previous assessments have indicated the absence of self-sustaining game fish populations.     Channel catfish (CCF) fingerlings were stocked in 1998 and 1999.  The 1998 stocking failed due to Henneguya, an internal protozoan.  Channel catfish stocked in 1999 were sampled in 2000 but not in 2001.  However, a channel catfish population of unknown abundance still existed since DNR fisheries personnel observed a channel catfish being caught in 2001.  Other local anglers also reported catching channel catfish during the 2001 season.  Electrofishing will be used in future assessments to better evaluate the CCF population.  Yearling channel catfish were stocked in 2001.  Yearling CCF are considerably larger than fingerlings and survival of these fish should increase.       Black crappie, bluegill, walleye and yellow perch were all sampled in low abundance.  Available data strongly suggest migration from Del Clark Lake is reponsible for the presence of these species.  Black crappie measured from 6.0-9.5 inches, with the majority 8.5-9.5 inches.  Bluegill measured 5-6 inches, walleye 14-24.0 inches, and yellow perch 5-7 inches.  Anglers reported to have good success for black crappie and walleye during the 2000 and 2001 seasons.        A low abundance of black bullhead was also sampled.  Most of the bullhead were quality sized, measuring over 10.0 inches.       Northern pike were sampled in 2000 but not in 2001.  Anglers reported catching several pike in 2001 prior to this investigation and their presence in Sylvan Lake is still likely.     Other species caught in the investigation include low abundances of common shiners, orange spotted sunfish and white suckers.     Fishery manangement plans for Sylvan Lake include fish population assessments scheduled 2002 and 2003 and annual monitoring of winter dissolved oxygen and angling pressure.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Sylvan Lake is a small, 15 acres impoundment of Canby Creek located within the city of Canby.  It is a shallow, muck-bottomed reservoir that contains only marginal game fish habitat.     Channel catfish (CCF) were stocked in 1998, 1999 and 2001.  Annual assessments have been conducted since 1999 to evaluate the success of these stockings.  With the exception of 2000, zero CCF have been sampled.  In 2000, three catfish from the 1999 stocking were caught.  Local anglers also reported catching numerous CCF during the 2000 season.  Anglers reported very limited success in 2001 and 2002.  Data suggests that channel catfish survival has been poor, and that the goal of establishing a viable population has failed.  Future stockings of channel catfish is not recommended.     Low numbers of black crappie, northern pike, walleye and yellow perch were sampled in 2002.  Migration from Del Clark Lake has been responsible for maintaining these populations.  Black crappie measured from 6-11 inches, northern pike from 14-18 inches, walleye from 13-22 inches and yellow perch from 6-9 inches.  Anglers have reported good success for walleye and northern pike during the 2002 season.       Other species sampled in 2002 include low numbers of bluegill, green sunfish, hybrid sunfish and white sucker.  All black bullhead sampled were of quality size, measuring 9-13 inches.     Due to its high use potential, management of Sylvan Lake will be changed to a put-and-take fishery.  Adult black crappie, northern pike, walleye and yellow perch will be stocked when available and when deemed necessary.  Other management plans include annual winter monitoring of dissolved oxygen concentration and fishing pressure, and fisheries population assessment in 2005.  </p>",
