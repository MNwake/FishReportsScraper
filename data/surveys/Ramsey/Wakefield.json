The shoreline on the east side of the lake is gradual with a walking path and fishable areas.  The west side of the lake has private residences.  The north and south sides are park property, but the shorelines are less fishable than the east side.  Lake size is 22.5 acres and maximum depth is 9.5 feet.Black bullhead was the most abundant species sampled, with lengths up to 9.25\".  Green sunfish were also abundant.  The only gamefish sampled was one 6.8\" black crappie.  The hard winter of 2000-2001 may have resulted in winterkill of any existing panfish population.  Other species sampled in low numbers were pumpkinseed, hybrid sunfish, and goldfish.The lake is scheduled to be stocked with catchable size bluegill and black crappie in the spring of 2002.</p>",

It is located in Wakefield Park which is managed by the City of Maplewood and has ballfields, toilets, picnic tables, walking paths and ample parking. A fishing pier, three formal shore fishing sites and an open area near the playground all provide easy access for fishing. Dense submerged aquatic vegetation can interfere with shorefishing by mid-summer, making the fishing pier the best place to use at that time. <br> \n <br> \nThe lake has been stocked on an almost annual basis since 2002 with a variety of species, including: bluegill sunfish, black crappie, northern pike, and yellow perch. The 2007 survey found bluegill in low to moderate abundance but of a satisfactory size (average length=7.1 inches). Only two black crappie were seen during this survey, but both exceeded nine inches in length. These two species are stocked almost every year into Wakefield Lake and provide plenty of action for the young anglers on the fishing pier. Northern pike were sampled in high numbers for a small lake such as Wakefield and ranged in size from 12.8 inches up to 23.4 inches. Black bullhead were quite abundant and ranged from 3.8 inches up to 9.7 inches with most in the 5-6 inch range. Yellow perch and hybrid sunfish were also caught during this survey but in low numbers. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Wakefield Lake is 23 acres in size and has a maximum depth of approximately nine feet. Wakefield lake has been managed as part of the Fishing in the Neighborhood Program (FiN) since 2001 when the first fisheries population assessment was conducted. Prior to this time, fisheries management consisted of fish stocking in 1944 and the 1960's as well as reproduction checks in the 1950's and 1960's. The first full lake survey was conducted in 2006. It is located in Wakefield Park which is managed by the City of Maplewood and has ballfields, toilets, picnic tables, walking paths and ample parking. A fishing pier, three formal shore fishing sites and an open area near the playground all provide easy access for fishing. Dense submerged aquatic vegetation can interfere with shorefishing by mid-summer, making the fishing pier the best place to use at that time. <br> \n <br> \nThe lake has been stocked on an almost annual basis since 2002 with a variety of species, including: Bluegill Sunfish, Black Crappie, Northern Pike, and Yellow Perch. The 2016 survey found Bluegill in high abundance but of a small size (average length=4.22 inches). Northern Pike were sampled in high numbers for a small lake such as Wakefield and ranged in size from 20 inches up to 25.5 inches. Black Bullhead are abundant and ranged from 4.5 inches up to 8.5 inches with most in the 5-6 inch range. Yellow Perch were also found in good abundance and their presence may be due to recent stockings. Yellow Perch size ranged from 4.5 to almost 10 inches with most fish being in the 5 to 8 inch range. Pumpkinseed Sunfish were also caught during this survey in moderate numbers but of small size. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Wakefield Lake is 23 acres with a maximum depth of about nine feet.  It is located in Wakefield Park operated by the City of Maplewood.  The park offers a playground, ball fields, toilets, picnic tables, walking paths, and parking, plus skating and sledding in the winter.  There are various places to fish from shore on the east and north sides, including three formal shorefishing structures.  Dense vegetation can interfere with fishing in mid-summer. <br> \n <br> \nThe lake has been stocked with bluegill, black crappie, northern pike, and yellow perch since 2001.   The 2006 survey found good numbers of bluegill.  Lengths ranged from 3 to 7 inches, with most between 5.5 and 6.5 inches.  Pumpkinseed and green sunfish are also abundant.  Black crappie were sampled in moderate numbers, with lengths ranging from 4.5 to 7 inches, but anglers have reported crappie up to 12 inches.   The largemouth bass population seems to be dominated by young fish, but adults are present.  The largest fish sampled was 17 inches.  Yellow perch were sampled in low to moderate numbers; all were between 6.5 and 8.5 inches.  Black bullhead abundance has declined from high in 2001 to moderate in 2006.  Bullhead lengths ranged from 4.5 to 12.5 inches, with a 6.5-inch average.  No northern pike were sampled, but adults were stocked in 2004 and 2005.  Golden shiners were also sampled in high numbers. <br> \n</p>",
