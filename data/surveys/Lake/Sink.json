The lake lies in the Superior National Forest and is accessible only by a logging road and trail during dry weather.  There are two small inlets and one outlet which is blocked by a large beaver dam.  Shoal water soils are largely muck and muck over gravelly boulder base.  Shorelines are forested with boggy marshes around most of the lake except the east side.Water levels were about normal at the time of the survey and submerged vegetation was found in shallow areas to 8 feet.Test netting indicated an abundance of small Northern Pike, all under 22 inches in length, and a large population of Yellow Perch, about half between 7.5 and 12 inches. No other species were taken.Northern Pike spawning apparently occurs on the marshy edges of the lake.  There is little suitable spawning area for other species of game fish.Sink Lake receives light fishing pressure as indicated by two boats present at the lake.  Access is limited to dry weather conditions of the logging road.Moose frequent the area in the vicinity of the lake and were observed in the marsh on the southwest side of the lake.</p>",

A few fish in the 23-26 inch range were collected however the majority of the fish were smaller than 20 inches.Yellow perch were sampled in fair numbers but most were smaller than 8.0 inches and probably too small to interest most anglers.

                "narrative": "<p>Sink Lake is an 18.2 acre lake located approximately 12 miles west of Finland, MN.  The maximum depth is 22.0 feet and water clarity was measured as 4.0 feet in brown bog-stained water.  The shoreline around the lake was a mixture of coniferous forest and bog.  The shoreline around the lake is undeveloped and under State ownership.  Thirty-one aquatic plant species were observed in the survey.  Muck and detritus were the most abundant substrates in the lake with a small area of rubble near the access.  The gamefish community consists of Northern Pike and Yellow Perch.  Blacknose Shiner and White Sucker have also been sampled in the lake. <br> \n <br> \nThe access road (USFS Rd. 105) to Sink Lake is off of the Cloquet Lake Road (USFS Rd. 102) about 0.6 miles north of the Cloquet Lake access.  The access road is 1.2 miles and leads to a 130 yard carry-in access.   <br> \n <br> \nA survey was conducted in 2015 to assess the status of the fishery and aquatic habitat.  The survey found good numbers of small Northern Pike and high numbers of large Yellow Perch.  Northern Pike were sampled at above average numbers and growth rate compared to similar lakes in the area.  Three year classes of Northern Pike were present and the average size was 17.0 inches and weighed 1.0 pound, similar to previous investigations on the lake.   <br> \n <br> \nThe Yellow Perch catch numbers and growth rate were above average compared to similar lakes in northeastern Minnesota.  The length of Yellow perch would appeal to anglers as over 50 percent of the catch measured over 10.0 inches and average weight of perch was 0.5 pounds.  The largest Yellow Perch sampled was 13.0 inches and weighed 1.0 pound (and aged to be ten years old).  Ten year classes were represented in the sample, indicating good natural reproduction.  Dissolved oxygen levels tend to be low in deeper water therefore fishing should be limited to depths above 10 feet in the summer.   <br> \n</p>",
