Bluegill numbers were low (6.2/trap net), with an average length of 5.3\".  Only 11% were 7\" or larger. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike numbers were average for this type of lake (3.5/gill net) and average length was 23.1\".  While 43% were above the 22-26\" protected slot, the largest fish was only 27.8\".  Largemouth Bass were sampled by electrofishing at the rate of 32.5/hour.  Average length was 13.8\" and 79% of the fish were over 12\", with fish up to 19.3\" captured. <br> \n</p>",
