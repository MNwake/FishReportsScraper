                "narrative": "<p>Graham Lake is a 210-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located in north-central Otter Tail County one mile southwest of Frazee, MN.  The northern portion of the lake is located within Becker County.  Graham Lake is connected to Wimar Lake via a culvert under a township road along the southeast shoreline.  The maximum depth is 34 feet and 60% of the lake is 15 feet or less in depth.  The shoreline length is 2.8 miles.  The secchi disk reading, a standard measure of water clarity, was 10.8 feet.  Previous secchi disk readings have ranged from 4.2 to 11.0 feet.  Graham Lake is susceptible to periodic winterkill events.  Although winterkill has never been documented, the lake has been monitored during severe winters and dissolved oxygen readings have reached low levels.  Graham Lake is included in lake class 31 of the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources' (DNR) lake classification scheme.      The majority of the shoreline of Graham Lake is undeveloped.  The development that exists is located primarily on the northeast shore.  A private earthen boat access is located along the southeast shore.   The immediate watershed is composed of pastured hardwood woodlots.  Emergent aquatic plants, such as hardstem bulrush and common cattail, are prevalent in the shallow water areas. These emergent plants provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat and are critical in maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms from wave erosion and help absorb excess nutrients.  Emergent plants also provide critical spawning habitat for several fish species including northern pike, largemouth bass and panfish.  They also serve as important nursery areas for many species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants cannot be removed without a DNR permit.     Graham Lake can be ecologically classified as a bass-panfish type of lake and this is reflected in the assemblage of the fish community.  Northern pike, largemouth bass, and bluegill are the dominant fish species in Graham Lake.  The prolificacy of these species can be attributed to the abundance of suitable spawning habitat that is available.     A high-density northern pike population exists.  The northern pike gill net catch rate exceeded the upper limit of the normal range for class 31 lakes.  Age data indicate that pike reproduction is consistently good.  Pike ranged in length from 11.9 to 30.7 inches with an average length and weight of 21.2 inches and 2.1 pounds.  Northern pike attain an average length of 20.1 inches at four years of age.        Test-net catch data suggest that largemouth bass are abundant.  Bass ranged in length from 9.0 to 16.4 inches.  A strong 1998 year class composed a majority of the bass sample and should provide good bass angling for several years.  Bass growth rates are good with an average length of 12.4 inches at four years of age.     The bluegill trap net catch rate was well in excess of the upper limit of the normal range for class 31 lakes.  Age data indicate that bluegill reproduction is consistently good.  Seven percent of the bluegill sampled were 8.0 inches or greater in length and 22% were 7.0 inches or greater in length.  Bluegill reach an average length of 7.2 inches at six years of age.       The walleye gill net catch rate was within the normal range for class 31 lakes.  Walleye ranged in length from 16.5 to 25.9 inches with an average length and weight of 21.7 inches and 3.4 pounds.  Walleye stocking was discontinued in 1990 due to the lack of a public access.  All walleye corresponded to the 1995 or 1996 year classes.  The 1996 year class was an exceptionally strong year class in many lakes throughout the state.     Anglers can maintain the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large-size fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future.        </p>",

Walleye numbers are above the state net-catch median and below the local median. Yellow perch numbers have remained consistent since the 1980 survey and are maintaining a stable forage base.  Bluegill numbers have increased since 1980, and are providing a satisfactory fishery at this time.  Northern pike numbers are on an upward trend.  Walleye numbers have increased since the last survey and the average weight has more than doubled.  </p>",
