                "narrative": "<p>Pfeiffer Lake is located approximately 9 miles southwest of Tower. It has a surface area of 57 acres and a maximum depth of 26 feet. There is a concrete ramp and dock located at the USFS campground. <br> \n <br> \nLake bottom substrates along the shoreline of Pfeiffer Lake range from rubble to muck. Aquatic plants grow to a depth of 13 feet and are generally sparse with concentrations in the small bays. There are no inlets. The small outlet has a beaver dam that limits fish movement. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill numbers in 2012 (25/trap net) were lower than the long term average for all assessments on this lake. The average bluegill sampled was 7 inches long and about six years old. The largest bluegill sampled was 9 inches long. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie numbers in 2012 (2/trap net) were lower than the long term average for all assessments on this lake. Most crappie were less than six inches long and would be about three years old. The largest crappie sampled was almost 11 inches long. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye numbers in 2012 (4/gill net) were lower than the long term average for all assessments on this lake but still of moderate abundance. Most sampled walleye were aged to years that the lake was fingerling stocked, either in 2006 or 2009. Because of the two age classes, sizes grouped around 15 or 20 inches.  The largest walleye sampled was 21 inches long.        <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass and yellow perch were the only other fish species sampled in 2012. Yellow perch (25/gill net) were slightly higher than the long term average and the average length was 9 inches.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Pfeiffer Lake is located approximately 9 miles southwest of Tower within the Superior National Forest. Aside from the US Forest Service campground located on the east side of the lake there was only one cabin located on the west side. <br> \n <br> \nThere is a concrete planked boat ramp located at the campground for access with a small parking lot adjacent. Several of the campsites have walk-down water access and there is a swimming beach located nearby. <br> \n <br> \nSeven species of fish were sampled during the 2017 survey of Pfeiffer Lake. Yellow perch (83%) dominated the gill net catch, while bluegill (93%) were by far the most abundant species in the trap net catch. Largemouth bass were targeted by night electrofishing and were also abundant, sampled at a rate of 186/hour. There is a low density walleye population currently present with some larger individuals in the population. Black crappie were sampled again in 2017 and their numbers indicate a population with low relative abundance.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye numbers in 2017 were below the historic average of 5.5/gill net but similar to other area lakes of this type. The average walleye sampled with the gill nets was 14 inches long and about 4 years old. The average walleye sampled in the trap nets was 21 inches long. The largest walleye sampled in 2017 was 30.4 inches long which is the largest individual sampled to date. Walleye fingerlings are currently being stocked triennially on Pfeiffer Lake with the most recent stocking completed in 2015. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass were sampled with three methods in 2017. The average largemouth sampled by electrofishing was 10 inches long and about 5 years old. The largest bass measured in the survey was almost 19 inches long. Sixteen percent of the largemouth sampled with electrofishing were 12 inches or larger.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch numbers in 2017 (45.0/gill net) were well above the historic average (23.7/gill net) for this lake and greatly above average (2.6/gill net) when compared to other similar lakes in the area. The average perch sampled was 10.2 inches long and the largest perch measured 12.2 inches long. Sixty-two percent of the perch sampled were 10 inches or larger. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill numbers in 2017 (40.8/trap net) were identical to the historic average and greater than average (10.3/trap net) compared to other similar area lakes. The average bluegill sampled was 7.4 inches long and about 7 years old. The largest bluegill sampled was 10.2 inches in length. Nineteen percent of the bluegill sampled were 8 inches or larger. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie numbers in 2017 were below average compared to other similar area lakes with crappies however average crappie size was almost 10 inches long. <br> \n <br> \nSome fish were infected with black spot (Neascus) or yellow grub. Black spot and yellow grub are common parasites that are native to the area. Filleting can remove some of these parasites. The fillets are safe to eat when well cooked. More information can be found on the DNR website under \"Fish Information\". <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

It is likely that the two walleye aged VI were incorrectly aged and actually came from the 1985 or 1983 classes. Centrarchid and yellow perch recruitment is somewhat erratic, with large year classes produced in 1987. Crappie, bluegill, and yellow perch growth is average for the area.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Pfeiffer Lake is in Ecological Lake Class 10, which consists of 76 lakes in northeast Minnesota that are small and have very soft (unmineralized) water.  <br> \n <br> \nPfeiffer Lake was thermally stratified on 07/30/2007, with a surface temperature of 78 F and a bottom temperature of 53 F.  Adequate oxygen for fish (more than 2 ppm) was retained to a depth of 15 ft, where the temperature was 70 F.  Lake bottom substrates along the shoreline of Pfeiffer Lake range from rubble to muck.  Aquatic plants grow to a depth of 13 ft and are generally sparse with concentrations in the small bays.  There are no inlets.  The small outlet has a beaver dam that limits fish movement. <br> \n <br> \nFish sampling in 2007 consisted of two gillnets and nine trapnets, set in late July.  Previously, two Fisheries lake surveys and three fish population assessments dating back to 1977 each used of two gillnets and 4-9 trapnets.  Shoreline seining was done during both lake surveys, and night electrofishing for bass was done in the fall of 1997.  Most of these previous investigations were done in late July. <br> \n <br> \nThe total catch of fish (all species combined) in the trapnets in 2007 of 83 fish/net (20 lb/net) was higher than the median catch of 62 fish/net (19 lb/net) in all investigations on this lake.  More bluegill sunfish were captured in 2007 than in most previous investigations. <br> \n <br> \nThe total catch of fish in the gillnets in 2007 of 49 fish/net (28 lb/net) was in the fourth quartile for this lake class and was similar to the median catch of 45 fish/net (28 lb/net) in all investigations on this lake.  Lake Class 10 is one of the least productive lake classes in northeast Minnesota, in terms of gillnet catches of fish. <br> \n <br> \nFish populations in 2007, as in most previous investigations on this lake, were dominated by walleye and bluegill sunfish, followed by yellow perch.  Largemouth bass are more abundant than indicated by the gillnet and trapnet catches, because bass are \"net shy\" and tend to avoid standard sampling nets.  Largemouth sizes are mostly small.  Notable by their absence in this lake are northern pike. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye were not present in Pfeiffer Lake until they were stocked beginning in the 1980's.  Walleye numbers in 2007 (6.0/gillnet) were in the fourth quartile for this lake class and were also at the median catch of 6.0/gillnet in all investigations on this lake since their introduction.  Walleye sizes in 2007 averaged 19.0\" (2.4 lb), which was in the fourth quartile for this lake class and was larger than the average size of 16.6\" in all investigations on this lake.  The largest walleye captured in 2007 was 24.5\".   Many of the walleye (47 percent) were age four, from the 2003 year-class.  Growth of walleye captured in 2007 was faster than normal by area standards. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill numbers in 2007 (81.4/trapnet) were in the fourth quartile for this lake class and were higher than the median catch of 48.2/trapnet in all investigations on this lake.  Bluegill sizes in 2007 averaged 6.6\" (0.23 lb), which was in the third quartile for this lake class and was larger than the average size of 6.1\" in all investigations on this lake.  The largest bluegill captured in 2007 was 8.3\".  Most of the bluegill (77 percent) were age five, from the 2002 year-class.  Growth of bluegill captured in 2007 was normal by area standards. <br> \n <br> \nPerch numbers in 2007 (22.0/gillnet) were in the fourth quartile for this lake class and were similar to the median catch of 21.0/gillnet in all investigations on this lake.  Perch sizes in 2007 averaged 9.0\" (0.32 lb), which was in the fourth quartile for this lake class and was larger than the average size of 7.4\" in all investigations on this lake.  The largest perch captured in 2007 was 9.0\".  Most of the perch were ages four (39 percent) or age five (45 percent).  Growth of perch captured in 2007 was normal by area standards. <br> \n <br> \nMany of the fish examined in 2007 were infected with neascus (black spot).  Many of the bass had bass tapeworm larvae in their viscera, and some of the perch were infected with yellow grub.  Neascus, bass tapeworm, and yellow grub are all native parasites that are common to the area.  They cannot infect humans, are often removed by filleting, and are killed at temperatures used to cook fish.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Pfeiffer Lake is a 60 acre lake located 10 miles west of Tower.  It is accessed by a concrete ramp and has a US Forest Service Campground located on the north and east sides of the lake.  The lake is surrounded mostly by public land, except one small area on the west shore that is in private ownership.  The lake has a maximum depth of 26 feet and at the time of this survey the water color was clear.  \n\nOn June 28, 2022, the lake was thermally stratified with a surface temperature of 70 F and a bottom temperature of 50 F.  Oxygen levels were adequate for gamefish to a depth of 17 feet where the temperature was 55 F.  Lake bottom substrates along the shoreline are mostly rubble, gravel, and sand with muck in the bays.  \n\nPfeiffer is currently being stocked every third year with walleye fingerlings.  \n\nThe overall gillnet catch rate for all fish combined was 59.3 fish/net which was the second highest catch rate on record for the lake.  Fish species sampled were yellow perch, largemouth bass, bluegill, and walleye.  Trap nets caught fish at an overall rate of 43.3 fish/net which was very close to the average overall catch rate for the lake.  Black crappie were the only additional species sampled in trap nets that weren't also sampled in gill nets.  \n\nFive walleye were sampled in gill nets for a catch rate of 1.7 fish/net, which was the lowest on record for the lake but not far off the average when compared to other similar lakes.  Walleye lengths ranged from 16 to 21.5 inches with an average of nearly 18 inches.  Six additional walleye were captured in trap nets.  Their sizes were larger than the gillnetted fish with a range from 16 to 28.5 inches and an average of just over 24 inches.  Only the five fish captured in the gill nets were used for aging.  Three fish were age-4 and two were age-7.  All came from fingerling stocked years.      \n\nThirty-two largemouth bass were sampled in trap nets for a catch rate of 3.6 fish/net which was better than average for the lake, and quite good when compared to other similar lakes.  Ten additional fish were sampled in the gill nets.  Combining the catches from both gear types, lengths ranged from 5 to 15 inches with an average of nearly 8 inches.  Growth rates were average with a four-year-old fish measuring 10 inches.  \n\nTwenty-one black crappie were sampled in trap nets for a catch rate of 2.3 fish/net.  This was just below average compared to other similar lakes but right at the average historic catch rate for Pfeiffer Lake.  Lengths ranged from 4.5 to just over 10 inches with an average of over 8 inches.  Ages ranged from 2 to 4 years old.  Growth was exceptional with the average crappie nearing 10 inches at age-4.  \n\nThe bluegill trapnet catch was 36.8 fish/net which was very good compared to other similar lakes, but slightly below average for Pfeiffer Lake.  Sizes ranged from 3.5 to just over 10 inches with an average of 6.5 inches.  Seventeen individuals measured longer than nine inches.  Ages ranged from 3 to 12 years with strong representation (nearly 77% of the total catch) coming from the 2018 year class.  Growth rates were average when compared to other bluegill populations in the Tower area.  \n\nThe yellow perch gillnet catch rate was 52.7 fish/net which was the second highest on record for the lake.  Lengths ranged from 6 to nearly 13 inches with an average of 9 inches.\n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Pfeiffer Lake is in Ecological Lake Class 10, which consists of 76 lakes in northeast Minnesota that are small and have very soft (unmineralized) water.  Pfeiffer Lake is typical of lakes in this lake class, except that it is smaller and has clearer water.Pfeiffer Lake stratifies thermally in midsummer and has less than 2 ppm oxygen below 13 ft, where the temperature is 65 F.  Lake bottom substrates along the shoreline range from rubble to muck.  Aquatic plants grow to a depth of 13 ft with concentrations in the small bays.  There are no inlets.  The outlet is small and has a beaver dam which limits upstream fish movement.The total catch of fish (all species combined) in the gillnets in 1997 of 22 fish/net (26 lb/net) was higher than normal for this lake class.  Lake Class 10 is one of the least productive lake classes in northeast Minnesota, in terms of fish numbers and biomass.  Fish populations in 1997 were dominated by largemouth bass, white sucker, and walleye.  Bluegill and yellow perch numbers in 1997 were lower than in three previous gillnettings and trapnettings done in 1977, 1985, and 1990.Largemouth bass numbers in 1997 (6/trapnet) were higher than normal for this lake class, and were similar to the average of 4/trapnet in the previous trapnettings in Pfeiffer Lake.  Many largemouth were also captured in shoreline seining and in night electrofishing in 1997.  Recent largemouth reproduction  was erratic, as few largemouth were produced during the cold summers of 1992 and 1993.  Largemouth sizes were generally small, averaging 6\" in the trapnet catch and 10\" in the electrofishing catch.  The largest, caught while electrofishing, was 18\".  Growth of young largemouth (2\" at age one) was slower than normal for the area, while growth of older largemouth (8\" at age three) was faster than normal for the area.Walleye numbers in 1997 (5/gillnet, 4/trapnet) were higher than normal for this lake class.  Walleye were not originally present in Pfeiffer Lake and were first stocked in 1982.  Walleye are maintained in Pfeiffer Lake by stocking fingerlings once every three years.  All except one walleye captured in 1997 were from fingerling-stocked year classes, indicating that the natural reproduction of walleye in Pfeiffer Lake is almost nonexistent.  Walleye sizes in 1997 averaged 16\"; the largest was 24\".  Walleye growth (14\" at age three, 21\" at age six) is faster than normal.Bluegill numbers in 1997 (10/trapnet) were normal for this lake class, but were much lower than the average catch of 74/trapnet in the previous trapnettings in this lake.  Bluegill reproduction has been erratic; most bluegill in 1997 were from strong 1991 and 1995 year classes.  Few bluegill were produced in 1992, 1993, and 1994, which resulted in lower than average bluegill numbers in 1997.  Bluegill sizes in 1997 averaged 5\"; the largest was 7\".  Growth of young bluegill (3\" at age two) was normal for the area, but growth of older bluegill (5\" at age six) was slower than normal.Yellow perch numbers in 1997 (9/gillnet) were higher than normal for this lake class, but were much lower than the average catch of 42/gillnet in the previous gillnettings in this lake.  Recent perch reproduction has been erratic, with most perch from the 1994 year class.  Predation on perch by stocked walleye is also probably responsible for the decline in perch numbers.  Perch sizes in 1997 averaged 7\"; the largest was 10\".  Perch growth (5\" at age three) was slower than normal.Black crappie numbers in 1997 (4/trapnet) were normal for this lake class and were similar to the average of 5/trapnet in the previous trapnettings in this lake.  Most crappie caught in 1997 were young; only two were older than age three.  Crappie sizes were small, averaging 7\"; the largest was 12\".  Crappie growth (4\" at age two) was normal.Most of the bluegill examined for diseases and parasites had Neascus, as did half of the walleye and yellow perch which were examined.  Neascus, also known as \"black spot\", is a small parasite found in or just under the skin.  It is usually removed by filleting, cannot infect humans, and is killed by cooking.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Pfeiffer Lake is in Ecological Lake Class 10, which consists of 76 lakes in northeast Minnesota that are small and have very soft (unmineralized) water.  Pfeiffer Lake was thermally stratified on 07/22/2002, with a surface temperature of 77 F and a bottom temperature of 52 F.  Adequate oxygen for fish (2 ppm) was retained to a depth of 15 ft, where the temperature was 66 F.  Shoal water substrates range from rubble to muck.  Aquatic plants grow to a depth of 13 ft and are generally sparse with concentrations in the small bays.  There are no inlets.  The small outlet has a beaver dam which limits fish movement.Fish sampling in 2002 consisted of two gillnets and nine trapnets set in late July.  Previously, two Fisheries lake surveys and two fish population assessments dating back to 1977 each consisted of two gillnets and 4-9 trapnets.  Shoreline seining was done during both lake surveys, and night electrofishing for bass was done in the fall of 1997.  Most of these previous investigations were done in late July.The total catch of fish (all species combined) in the trapnets in 2002 of 40.9 fish/net (19.4 lb/net) was lower than the median catch of 61.5 fish/net (19.2 lb/net) in all investigations on this lake.  Fewer bluegill sunfish and largemouth bass were captured in 2002 than in most previous investigations.The total catch of fish in the gillnets in 2002 of 33.5 fish/net (27.8 lb/net) was in the fourth quartile for this lake class and was similar to the median catch of 41.5 fish/net (27.8 lb/net) in all investigations on this lake.  Lake Class 10 is one of the least productive lake classes in northeast Minnesota, in terms of catches of fish in gillnets.Fish populations in 2002 were dominated by walleye and bluegill sunfish, followed by yellow perch.  Black crappie numbers were low, but some were large (up to 13\").  Largemouth bass are more abundant than indicated by the gillnet and trapnet catches, but are mostly small.Walleye were not present in Pfeiffer Lake until they were stocked beginning in the 1980's.  Walleye numbers in 2002 (14.0/gillnet) were in the fourth quartile for this lake class and were higher than the median catch of 9.8/gillnet in all investigations on this lake since their introduction.  Walleye sizes in 2002 averaged 14.9\" (1.4 lb), which was in the second quartile for this lake class and was smaller than the average size of 16.1\" in all investigations on this lake.  The largest walleye captured in 2002 was 27.6\".   Growth of walleye captured in 2002 was faster than normal (in the fourth quartile) by area standards.Bluegill numbers in 2002 (31.1/trapnet) were in the third quartile for this lake class and were lower than the median catch of 40.8/trapnet in all investigations on this lake.  Bluegill sizes in 2002 averaged 6.7\" (0.26 lb), which was in the fourth quartile for this lake class and was larger than the average size of 5.9\" in all investigations on this lake.  The largest bluegill captured in 2002 was 9.2\".  Growth of bluegill captured in 2002 was normal by area standards.Perch numbers in 2002 (13.0/gillnet) were in the fourth quartile for this lake class and were lower than the median catch of 20.0/gillnet in all investigations on this lake.  Perch sizes in 2002 averaged 7.1\" (0.14 lb), which was at the median for this lake class and was identical to the average size of 7.1\" in all investigations on this lake.  The largest perch captured in 2002 was 8.9\".  Perch scales were difficult to read, but the growth of perch captured in 2002 appeared to be somewhat slower than normal (in the second quartile) by area standards.</p>",
