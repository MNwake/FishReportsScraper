                "narrative": "<p>This is a generally shallow (67% littoral), fertile lake, comprised of many different interconnected bays.  It has been subject to periodic winterkills.  Partial winterkills may occur in some of the bays even when the majority of the lake does not winterkill.  The Cormorant Lakes Sportsman's Club operates aeration equipment to prevent winterkill but in the severest of winters it is probably not adequate.  The latest documented partial winterkill occurred in the winter of '85-'86.  Largemouth bass, bluegills, and walleyes apparently did not survive that event, none were found in the 1986 survey.  Walleyes and bluegills were subsequently stocked and although largemouth bass have appeared in later surveys it is not known if there were some survivors or if some were stocked by an unknown party.Northern pike were apparently increasing prior to the '85-'86 winterkill and were not significantly affected by the episode.  They increased from a gillnet catch of 0.25/GN in '83 to 6.63/GN in '86.  Northern pike likely benefitted from the loss of other predators and peaked at 11.25/GN in '88 before declining to the current 6.00/GN.  This is between the first and third quartile for this lake class.  Northern pike exhibit a fast growth rate, particularly in their early years.  The presence of an abundant yellow perch population may account for their fast growth-rate.Both black and brown bullheads are present and very abundant, far above third quartile values for this lake class.  This is characteristic and to be expected in a winterkill prone lake.  Their size distribution is generally too small to be of interest to commercial fishermen.The centrarchid species are at a disadvantage in this lake since they are usually the first to succumb to winterkill.  Black crappies have been the most resistent, maintaning a modest population in spite of winterkill events.  Bluegills were stocked in 1987 following the '85-'86 winterkill and only recently have they reached a level between the first and third quartile for this lake class.  Growth rates for both bluegills and black crappies are normal but PSD and RSD values are generally poor (BLG PSD=24 and RSD(8)=1, BLC PSD=32 and RSD(10)=3).  Large year classes of two, three, and four-year-olds are present for both species and, barring a winterkill event, should provide some angling opportunities in the near future.  Only six largemouth bass were sampled in the current survey and their growth-rate appears to be good.Yellow perch gillnet catches have varied widely from survey to survey, from very low to extremely high.  These changes do not appear to be related directly to winterkill events but more as an aftermath associated with alterations in the rest of the fish community.  The current gillnet catch of 119.88/GN is nearly four times the third quartile value for this lake class, a significant increase from the 15.25/GN recorded 1988.  The 1988 survey was at the peak of northern pike abundance and, undoubtedly, heavy predation on yellow perch was occurring.Walleye fry were stocked annually from 1986 through 1989 following the '85-'86 winterkill.  The 1988 survey found a large '86 year class of two-year-olds that exhibited fast growth.  Now six-year-olds, that '86 year class is still dominant, although the '87 year class is nearly as large.  Growth rate in the current survey is close to normal.  Two, three, and four-year-olds are also present but much less abundant than the five and six-year-olds.  Natural reproduction is likely negligible and the present population is the result of walleye fry stocking.  The current gillnet catch of 5.88/GN (above the third quartile for this lake class) with PSD=98 and RSD(20)=30 represents an excellent opportunity for the angler.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of the nearshore fish community in Little Cormorant Lake was conducted by Fisheries Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program Staff from 5-6 July 2023.  Fourteen sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 15-foot or 50-foot seine, where possible.  Backpack electrofishing was completed at all 14 sites with three sites sampled from the boat.  A 50-foot seine was used to sample 7 sites, a 15-foot seine was used at four sites, and soft sediments with abundant vegetation and deep water prevented the use of seines at three sampling sites.  Nearshore sampling captured 11 native species of fish including one species that is intolerant of disturbance (Rock Bass) and one species (Green Sunfish) that is tolerant of disturbance. <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore data were combined with trap net data from a July 2023 survey and gill net data from a June 2022 survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based IBI (FIBI) score.  The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment.  In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g., Blackchin Shiner, Iowa Darter, and Rock Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g., Black Bullhead, Fathead Minnow, and Green Sunfish).  The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake.  An additional survey was completed on Little Cormorant Lake in late July 2023 resulting in a slightly higher FIBI score.  For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.   <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey and the additional survey in late July indicate the fish community in Little Cormorant Lake is adversely impacted by stressors as indicated by an FIBI score below the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes.  These results are similar to previous findings, which indicated that Little Cormorant Lake was impaired for aquatic life use based on the Fish IBI. Data from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Otter Tail River Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Little Cormorant is a popular fishing lake that provides good, all-around angling in between winterkills.  A combination of factors including high water levels, mild winters, and lake aeration by the Cormorant Lake Sportsmen's Club have helped to prevent severe winterkill for several years.The walleye population is one of several species which has benefited from higher dissolved oxygen levels during recent winters.  Very little walleye spawning habitat exists in Little Cormorant Lake and the walleye fishery is maintained by biennial fry stocking.  There was a good range of sizes found during the 2002 fish population assessment (7.7 to 28.0 inches).  The average length of sampled walleyes was just under 17 inches and the average weight was two pounds.Other popular species including bluegill, black crappie, largemouth bass, and northern pike were stocked after the most recent moderate to severe winterkills (1977 and 1986).  These species have an abundance of spawning habitat in the lake and populations have sustained themselves.  In 2002, sampled bluegills averaged seven inches in length while black crappies averaged nearly 11 inches, but few crappies were found.  Northern pike were generally small and abundant but several over 30 inches were also present.Net catches of yellow perch decreased since the 1997 assessment.  This species is not only a popular angling target in Little Cormorant, but also an important forage fish for predators like walleye, northern pike, and largemouth bass.  Perch up to 11 inches in length were sampled in test nets.Minnesota's Pollution Control Agency (PCA) classifies Little Cormorant as eutrophic.  Lakes in the early stages of eutrophy are generally very productive fish lakes but may also be subject to algal blooms and winterkills.  Lakeshore and watershed property owners need to use the best land management practices available to slow down eutrophication (aging) of the lake.  These practices include (1) exceeding setbacks for structures and septic systems, (2) leaving buffer strips of natural vegetation along the shoreline, (3) leaving aquatic vegetation stands (especially bulrush and cattail) intact, (4) and not fertilizing lawns or using phosphorus free fertilizers.  Help is available from the DNR for landowners wishing to restore shorelines or landscape shoreline properties in ways that help protect water quality, property values, and fish populations.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Little Cormorant is a popular fishing lake that provides good, all-around angling between very infrequent winterkills.  A combination of factors including high water levels, mild winters, and lake aeration by the Cormorant Lake Sportsmen's Club have helped to prevent severe winterkill for the past 27 years. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye is one of several species benefiting from higher dissolved oxygen levels during recent winters.  Very little walleye spawning habitat exists in Little Cormorant Lake and the modest walleye fishery is maintained primarily by biennial fry stocking.  Walleyes found during the 2012 fish population assessment were very nice, on average, with an average length of 20 inches and an average weight of nearly three pounds. <br> \n <br> \nOther popular species including bluegill, black crappie, largemouth bass, and northern pike were stocked after the most recent moderate to severe winterkills (1977 and 1986).  These species have an abundance of preferred spawning habitat in the lake and populations have sustained themselves.  Pike were again abundant in 2012 and the average size increased to 23 inches (about 2.7 pounds) with a couple over 30 inches.  In 2012, sampled bluegills were smaller, younger, and more abundant than they were ten years ago with an average length of 5.9 inches.  Black crappies and largemouth bass were not abundant, but were present. <br> \n <br> \nNet catches of yellow perch increased slightly since the 2007 assessment.  This species has been a popular angling target in Little Cormorant and also an important forage fish for predators like walleye, northern pike, and largemouth bass.  Perch up to 11 inches in length were sampled in test nets in the past, but none over 9.5 inches were found in 2012. <br> \n <br> \nSpecial fishing regulations went into effect in 2008 for crappie (10-inch minimum, bag limit of five); for sunfish (bag limit of five); and for walleye (17-inch minimum).  Though it is far too soon to evaluate, it is hoped that these regulations will eventually result in more fishing opportunities for larger fish in Little Cormorant.  Though there is no special regulation for northern pike in place, anglers are encouraged to release pike over 24 inches in length and keep more small fish for eating.  Lakes that regularly winterkill do not generally make good candidates for special fishing regulations because winterkill can eliminate the fish that regulations attempt to increase.  However as stated above, Little Cormorant has not experienced winterkill for well over twenty years. <br> \n <br> \nMinnesota's Pollution Control Agency (PCA) classifies Little Cormorant as eutrophic.  Lakes in the early stages of eutrophy are generally very productive fish lakes but may also be subject to algal blooms and winterkills.  Lakeshore and watershed property owners are strongly encouraged to use the best land management practices available to slow down eutrophication (aging) of the lake.  These practices include (1) exceeding setbacks for structures and septic systems, (2) leaving buffer strips of natural vegetation along the shoreline, (3) leaving aquatic vegetation stands (especially bulrush and cattail) intact, (4) and not fertilizing lawns or using phosphorus free fertilizers.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A survey of nearshore fish species was conducted on July 18, 2016 by IBI Program Staff.  Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible.  Backpack electrofishing was completed at all 14 sampling stations, but 3 stations were sampled from the boat due to site conditions.  Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample 6 stations, a 15-foot seine was used at 5 stations, and site conditions prevented the use of seines at 3 stations.  Nearshore sampling captured 10 species of fish including 2 species that are tolerant of disturbance (Black Bullhead and Green Sunfish). <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore fish data was combined with gill net and trap net data from a June 2012 survey to describe the fish community and provide a fish-based Index of Biological Integrity (FIBI) score based on expectations for similar lakes.  The FIBI score for Little Cormorant Lake is below the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes.  Data from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to a watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.  Little Cormorant Lake is located in the Ottertail River Watershed. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Little Cormorant is a 924-acre, class 25 lake located in southwestern Becker County, four miles south of Audubon.  The lake's irregular shape, with its many bays and islands, displays the highest shoreline to surface area ratio of any lake in the Detroit Lakes Management Area.  Water levels are primarily influenced by ground water and runoff from the immediate watershed.  With its many shallow bays and high productivity, Little Cormorant is susceptible to periodic winterkill, although none have occurred for 32 years.  In an effort to reduce the effects of winterkill, the Cormorant Lakes Sportsmen's Club has operated lake aeration systems frequently since the 1980's.  Since 2008, Little Cormorant Lake has regulations for Walleye (17-inch minimum length limit), Bluegill (five fish bag limit), and Black Crappie (five fish bag limit and 10 inch minimum length limit).  A standard fisheries survey was conducted at the end of June 2022 to evaluate the fish populations in Little Cormorant Lake. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance continues to remain low in Little Cormorant Lake.  Only a total of 12 Walleye were caught during the 2022 survey.  Walleye had an average length of 19 inches.  In contrast, Northern Pike were caught in record numbers in 2022.  Although some pike were found to be over 30 inches long, anglers can expect pike to average 22 inches long.  Bluegill abundance also remains high in Little Cormorant Lake.  Bluegill were primarily six inches long, but fish over nine inches were observed.  A total of 17 Black Crappie were captured in nets in 2022.  Crappie had an average size of seven inches with the largest fish measuring almost 11 inches.  Largemouth Bass were primarily caught in nets set in offshore areas and had an average length of 15 inches.  One bass was measured that was 19.5 inches long.  Other fish species captured during the survey included Black Bullhead, Brown Bullhead, Pumpkinseed, Rock Bass, Yellow Bullhead, and Yellow Perch.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Little Cormorant is a popular fishing lake that provides good, all-around angling between very infrequent winterkills.  A combination of factors including high water levels, mild winters, and lake aeration by the Cormorant Lake Sportsmen's Club have helped to prevent severe winterkill for over 20 years. <br> \n <br> \nThe walleye population is one of several species which has benefited from higher dissolved oxygen levels during recent winters.  Very little walleye spawning habitat exists in Little Cormorant Lake and the walleye fishery is maintained by biennial fry stocking.  Walleyes found during the 2007 fish population assessment were very nice, on average, with an average length of nearly 20 inches and an average weight of nearly three pounds. <br> \n <br> \nOther popular species including bluegill, black crappie, largemouth bass, and northern pike were stocked after the most recent moderate to severe winterkills (1977 and 1986).  These species have an abundance of spawning habitat in the lake and populations have sustained themselves.  Pike were especially abundant in 2007 and the average size increased to 22 inches (about 2.3 pounds) with few over 30 inches.  In 2007, sampled bluegills were smaller, younger, and more abundant than they were five years ago with an average length of 5.6 inches.  Black crappies and largemouth bass were not abundant, but were present. <br> \n <br> \nNet catches of yellow perch increased slightly since the 2002 assessment.  This species has been a popular angling target in Little Cormorant and also an important forage fish for predators like walleye, northern pike, and largemouth bass.  Perch up to 11 inches in length were sampled in test nets in the past, but none over 9.5 inches were found in 2007. <br> \n <br> \nSpecial fishing regulations will go into effect in 2008 for crappie (10 inch minimum, bag limit of five); for sunfish (bag limit of five); and for walleye (17 inch minimum).  It is hoped that these regulations will result in more fishing opportunities for larger fish in Little Cormorant in the future.  Though there is no special regulation for northern pike in place, anglers are encouraged to release pike over 24 inches in length and keep more small fish for eating.  Lakes that regularly winterkill do not generally make good candidates for special fishing regulations because winterkill can eliminate the fish that regulations attempt to increase.  However, Little Cormorant has not experienced winterkill for over twenty years. <br> \n <br> \nMinnesota's Pollution Control Agency (PCA) classifies Little Cormorant as eutrophic.  Lakes in the early stages of eutrophy are generally very productive fish lakes but may also be subject to algal blooms and winterkills.  Lakeshore and watershed property owners need to use the best land management practices available to slow down eutrophication (aging) of the lake.  These practices include (1) exceeding setbacks for structures and septic systems, (2) leaving buffer strips of natural vegetation along the shoreline, (3) leaving aquatic vegetation stands (especially bulrush and cattail) intact, (4) and not fertilizing lawns or using phosphorus free fertilizers.  Help is available from the DNR for landowners wishing to restore shorelines or landscape shoreline properties in ways that help protect water quality, property values, and fish populations. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Little Cormorant Lake is located in southwestern Becker County, four miles south of Audubon, MN.  The lake's irregular shape and its many bays and islands gives it the highest shoreline to area ratio of any area lake.  A landlocked lake lying within the NW reaches of the Ottertail River Watershed, Little Cormorant is influenced primarily by ground water and runoff.  With its many shallow bays and high productivity, Little Cormorant is susceptible to periodic winterkill.  In an effort to reduce the potential of winterkill, the Cormorant Lakes Sportsmen Club has operated lake aeration systems since the early 1980's.  Little Cormorant Lake greatly differs from other lakes in its ecological lake class due to its potential for winterkill and its advance eutrophic state.  Physical and biological comparisons with other lakes within its class would have limited value.Little Cormorant Lake has a history of seven fish population assessments, dating back to 1966.  Also documented are numerous fish stocking and removal records dating back to 1915.  Since 1949 walleye have been stocked in twenty-nine different years, bluegill eight years, northern pike six years, black crappie five years, largemouth bass three years, and yellow perch one year.  Since 1959 nearly 200,000 pounds of bullhead have been commercially harvested from these waters.Little Cormorant possesses little suitable walleye spawning habitat, relying upon biennial fry stocking to maintain abundances at or slightly below lake class median values.  The current gillnet catch rate (1.0/set) is below the first quartile (1.3/set) and is at its lowest level since 1986.  The 1994 year class (age III) walleye was the most abundant age group identified, displaying a mean length of 15 inches and growth rates slightly above average.The current gillnet catch rate for northern pike (10.0/set) is nearly double the lake class average and is the second highest recorded for these waters.  Five age groups (I-V) of northern pike were identified, with age III fish comprising 52% of the sample.  The average length (20.8 in.) and weight (2.2 lbs.) of the sample also reflects a population dominated by young fish.  Growth of northern pike was slightly above statewide averages.Bluegills were sampled at record high numbers (29/set).  Though the population is dominated by fish seven inches or less, many anglers are taking advantage of the recent upswing in the bluegill population.  The large 1994 and 1995 year classes should provide the angler with an abundance of quality sized bluegill provided they can survive into their fifth and sixth years.  Growth appears to be slightly above average through all age groups.More than any other species, yellow perch have experienced great fluctuations in abundance over the past thirty years.  Winter fishing of perch becomes very popular during periods of high abundance, despite the relatively heavy infestation of parasites within the population.  An important forage species, yellow perch often describe the limits of growth and abundance of predatory species within the fish community.  In recent years this relationship has been most evident between yellow perch and northern pike.  The current yellow perch gillnet catch rate (105.0/set) far exceeds the third quartile value (24.2/set) and is the third highest reported from these waters.  Average length (7.1 in.) and weight (0.2 lbs.) of the sample are very similar to those reported from previous assessments.Largemouth bass and black crappie are two of the most sought after species targeted by anglers fishing these waters.  Over the past 15 years both species have maintained stable but relatively low population levels based on survey data.  Because of the small sample size obtained during midsummer testnetting, little can be said about these populations.  Early spring electrofishing and trapnetting may provide a better picture of bass and crappie populations.Current black and brown bullhead catch rates are at near historical low levels.  Populations of these species were much higher through the 1980's and early 1990's possibly taking advantage of a partial winterkill situation.  In recent years black bullhead has been the most dominant bullhead species, a condition often reflective of a decline in a lake's trophic state.Like many area lakes, Little Cormorant has experienced a tremendous increase in shoreline development, bringing with it the possibility of increased nutrification.  This, along with agricultural runoff, high alkalinity, and a very slow nutrient flushing rate, could dramatically increase the rate of eutrophication in this water body.A mean trophic state index (TSI) value of 57.0 was calculated for June, July and August 1993 from lake monitoring data supplied by the Becker County COLA.  A TSI of 57.0 describes a lake in the early stages of classical eutrophy, a trophic state often displaying decreased light transparency (<6ft.), an anoxic hypolimnia during the summer months, macrophyte and algal problems, and the absence of cold water fish species.Lakes are a valuable and vulnerable resource, requiring vigilant stewardship from government agencies and the private citizen alike.  Stewardship requires the understanding that what we do on the land and in the water has a direct impact on the lake, chemically, biologically and aesthetically.  Lake stewardship extends beyond the shoreline to the watershed where agricultural, residential, and urban land management practices can greatly impact a lake.  As a lakeshore owner, supporting your lakeshore association and adopting shoreline best management practices* can yield big dividends for the individual, the lake, and the watershed.*The series of publications \"Shoreline Best Management Practices\" is available from Minnesota DNR offices.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Little Cormorant is a 924-acre, class 25 lake located in southwestern Becker County, four miles south of Audubon.  The lake's irregular shape, with its many bays and islands, displays the highest shoreline to surface area ratio of any Detroit Lakes Management Area lake.  Water levels are primarily influenced by ground water and runoff from the immediate watershed.  With its many shallow bays and high productivity, Little Cormorant is susceptible to periodic winterkill, although none have occurred for 32 years.  In an effort to reduce the effects of winterkill, the Cormorant Lakes Sportsmen's Club has operated lake aeration systems frequently since the 1980's.  Since 2008, Little Cormorant Lake has had regulations for Walleye (17 inch minimum length limit), Bluegill (five fish bag limit), and Black Crappie (five fish bag limit and 10 inch minimum length limit). <br> \n <br> \nSuitable Walleye spawning habitat is rare and the Walleye fishery in Little Cormorant is primarily the result of every other year fry stocking.  Although the 2017 gill net catch rate for Walleyes of 0.78 fish per net was extremely low, this was not the lowest catch ever observed.  In fact, five of the past 11 surveys recorded Walleye catch rates of 1.0 or less.  The lake's historic mean Walleye catch rate is 5.7 fish per net.  However, the historic mean includes an abnormally high catch of 33.3 Walleyes per set from 1966 when post-winterkill conditions meant there was no competition from Northern Pike and other fish species.  Since 1977, the mean catch rate has been considerably less at 2.9 Walleyes per net.  The mean Walleye size in 2017 was 21.1 inches in length and 2.8 pounds.  Walleye lengths ranged 12.7 to 28.9 inches.  Five of the seven Walleyes sampled were at least 16 years old.   <br> \n <br> \nThe mean Northern Pike catch rate remained high at 13.0 per gill net.  Little Cormorant's historical mean is 8.1 Northern Pike per net.  The mean length of sampled pike was 24.7 inches and lengths ranged from 18.5 to 32.3 inches.  Northern Pike recruitment appears stable as fish from age classes 2-8, with very similar contribution of ages 3-7.  The average Northern Pike growth rate in Little Cormorant continues to be relatively fast compared to statewide indices with pike growing to an average length of 22.2 inches in four years. <br> \n <br> \nA strong population of Yellow Perch is typical for this lake.  In 2017, Yellow Perch catches remained below the lake's historic average (58.1 per set) at 27.4 Yellow Perch per net.  The mean length of sampled perch was 5.9 inches and lengths ranged from 5.2 to 7.6 inches.  These sizes were considerably smaller than those found in 2002 when perch over 11 inches were found and the mean perch length was over 8 inches. <br> \n <br> \nThe trap net catch rate of Bluegill doubled from the previous survey to 46.1 fish per net.  The lake's historical mean is 17.3 Bluegills per net.  Bluegill sizes were down from those sampled in the 2002 assessment.  Similar to Yellow Perch, Bluegill size indices were larger in the 2002 survey.  The mean Bluegill length was 6.1 inches and lengths of sampled fish ranged from 3.7 to 8.3 inches.  The 2013 year class (age 4) made up 35% of Bluegills sampled.  Bluegill averaged 5.0 inches in length at age 4. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie catch rates were not high during this summer survey, but an early spring trap netting survey captured 31 crappie with lengths ranging from 7.3 to 11.7 inches long.  Other species caught in test nets during the summer survey included Black and Brown Bullheads, Green, Hybrid, and Pumpkinseed Sunfish, Largemouth Bass, Rock Bass, and White Sucker.  </p>",
