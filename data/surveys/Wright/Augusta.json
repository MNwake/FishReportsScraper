                "narrative": "<p>Augusta Lake is a 178 acre lake located five miles northwest of Annandale.  The lake is part of the Clearwater River system, has 4.5 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 82 feet.  During early July 1997, there was adequate dissolved oxygen for fish present to a depth of 15 feet.  The lakeshore is developed with 138 homes, cabins, and permanent trailers. Thirty-four aquatic plant species were identified in the 1997 survey.  Public access to the lake is available via the Clearwater River from Clearwater Lake.  Black Crappie, Bluegill, Northern Pike, Yellow Perch, and Walleye are all present in the lake.  A lake survey conducted in the summer of 1997 revealed the following information about the fish population.     Northern Pike numbers were 5.3/gill net, which is in the expected range for lakes similar to Augusta.. The average Northern Pike weighed 2.1 pounds and was 20.3 inches long, which is in the expected range for similar lakes.  Pike growth was average compared to other populations in the state.  Gill net catch of Walleye (5.5/net) was normal for this lake type.  Walleye averaged 2.8 pounds and 18.8 inches long, which is slightly larger than expected for similar lakes.  Walleye are not stocked into Augusta Lake and no young hatched in 1997 were sampled.  Walleye most likely move into Augusta Lake from Clearwater Lake via the Clearwater River.       Yellow Perch numbers were 21.2/gill net, which is in the normal range.  Perch averaged 5.7 inches long and no fish were larger than 7.5 inches.  Young-of-year perch were caught in shoreline seining.  Cisco were also sampled in gill nets at a rate of 0.7/gill net and an average weight of 0.7 pounds, which is in the normal range for this lake type.      The trap net catch of Bluegill was 9.3/net, which in within the normal range for this lake type.  Bluegill averaged 5.3 inches long, and lengths ranged from 3.7-7.4 inches.  Bluegill reproduction is good, and a typical Bluegill reaches 6 inches in its fourth year.  The trap net catch of Black Crappie (3.2/net) was in the expected range for the lake class.  The average size crappie was 7.1 inches long.     Largemouth Bass are relatively abundant throughout the Clearwater Chain of lakes, but they are difficult to catch in trap nets.  Spawning habitat is present in Augusta Lake and young-of-year bass were caught in shoreline seine hauls. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Augusta is a 177 acre lake located along the Clearwater River in Wright County.  Lake Augusta can be accessed from Clearwater Lake which has two public boat accesses on its west side. In 2014, water clarity ranged from 4 to 9.5 feet in mid to late summer. Oxygen was adequate for sport fish to a depth of 18 feet. Lake Augusta has a moderate diversity of aquatic plants growing in sparse beds around the lake out to a depth of 14 feet. Eurasian water milfoil and curly leaf pondweed (both invasive aquatic species) are found in moderate abundance throughout the lake, so the potential for spreading these species into and out of the lake is high. Anglers and boaters should take extra precautions to prevent the further spread of all invasive species. <br> \n <br> \nThe day time electrofishing catch rate of Largemouth Bass in 2014 (25/ hour) was lower than the average value for Montrose Area lakes, (38/hour) but higher than the night time rate observed in 2005 (16/hour).  Largemouth Bass ranged in length from 11.1 to 18.5 inches with an average length of 14.6 inches. The size structure of the Largemouth Bass population in Augusta is well balanced and the fish are in good condition. Of the catchable size Largemouth Bass, 89% were greater than 12 inches and 46% were greater than 15 inches.  The Largemouth Bass population in adjacent Clearwater Lake has a reputation for quality fishing and anglers can expect good fishing for largemouth in Augusta as well. <br> \n <br> \nThe Northern Pike gill net catch in 2014 was lower than that observed in 2005 but remained above average compared to similar lakes. Northern Pike abundance has decreased since 2005, although the average size has improved. The Northern Pike sampled in 2014 ranged in length from 17.4 to 33.0 inches and averaged 23.2 inches and 2.7 pounds.  Forty three percent of Northern Pike sampled were longer than 24 inches. <br> \n <br> \nThe Walleye gill net catch increased from 2005 and was near the average for similar lakes.  Walleye ranged in length from 15.4 to 29.1 inches and averaged 20.6 inches and 2.6 pounds.  No Walleye are stocked in Lake Augusta, but fish likely move into the lake from adjoining Clearwater Lake.  After several years of successful Walleye stocking in Clearwater Lake it appears that Walleye have become more abundant in Lake Augusta as well. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill was the dominant species sampled with trap nets however, the catch rate was below the expected range for lakes similar to Augusta and the lowest recorded since 1979.  Bluegill ranged in length from 3.2 inches to 8.3 inches with a mean length of 6.5 inches. The size structure of Bluegill in Augusta was good as 48% of the fish sampled were longer than 7 inches. <br> \n <br> \nThe catch of Black Crappie was similar to 2005 and within the range of expected values.  Black Crappies ranged in length from 4.2 to 11.2 inches with an average length of 9.0 inches.  Sixty nine percent of the Black Crappie sampled were longer than 9 inches. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled included: Bowfin (dogfish), Brown Bullhead, Common Carp, Golden Shiner, Hybrid and Pumpkinseed Sunfish, Tullibee (Cisco), Rock Bass, White Sucker, Yellow Bullhead, and Yellow Perch. <br> \n <br> \nThe protection of water quality and habitat is critical in maintaining and improving fish and wildlife populations. Unfortunately, human activities often negatively impact our lakes. Fertilized turf grass lawns and failing septic systems along with the removal of shoreline and aquatic vegetation, mowing to the shore, and installing sand blanket beaches result in destabilized shorelines, uncontrolled erosion, and increased run off, contributing excess nutrients and sediment to the lake and degrading water quality and habitat. By understanding the cumulative impacts of our actions and taking steps to avoid or minimize them, we can help insure that our water resources can be enjoyed into the future. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Important species caught in gill nets were: Northern Pike, Yellow Perch, and Walleye.  Northern Pike numbers (4.7/gill net) were within the range of expected values for lakes similar to Augusta.  Northern Pike lengths ranged from 19 to 30 inches and age groups 2-6 were present.  Growth rates of Northern Pike were average.  Yellow Perch numbers showed a significant increase since the 1985 survey, and are now in the average range for similar lakes.  Most Yellow Perch caught were in the 6.0-6.4 inch length group.  Walleye numbers were average for similar lakes (3.5/gill net).  Numbers were similar to the 1985 survey. Except for age 2, which was absent, all age groups 1-8 were represented in gill net catches.  Both male and female growth was average.  The average length of Walleye was 20 inches, with a range of 11.0-28.9 inches. \n\nImportant species caught in trap nets were: Black Bullhead, Yellow Bullhead, Brown Bullhead, Pumpkinseed, Bluegill, Black Crappie, and Largemouth Bass.  Yellow Bullhead were very abundant (29.8/trap net), with an average size of 0.6 pounds.  Large Black and Brown Bullhead were present; Black Bullhead averaged 0.8 pounds and Brown Bullhead averaged 1.1 pounds.  High numbers of Bluegill (134/trap net) and Black Crappie (18.2/trap net) were caught.  Both had average lengths in the 6.0-6.4 length group.  Pumpkinseed showed average numbers (5.0/trap net) and size (0.14 pounds). \n\nLargemouth Bass were caught by electrofishing at a rate of 5.2 per hour.  Lengths ranged from 5-15 inches 78% of catchable size fish (> 8 inches) were longer than 12 inches.  Growth of Largemouth Bass was average.  Ciscoes were sampled in both gill and trap nets.  The gill net catch was high for this lake class, and the highest ever recorded for this lake.  This species generally prefer deep waters of low fertility; considering the water quality and temperature/oxygen profiles of this lake, the high number of ciscoes is unusual.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Augusta Lake is a 177 acre lake located on the Clearwater River near the town of South Haven in Wright County. The lake has a maximum depth of 82 feet and good water clarity; Secchi depth was 7.0 feet in early July and MPCA data show a ten year summer average of 6.6 feet. The watershed is large and land use is primarily agriculture with some pasture. There is no public boat access, but the lake can be reached from nearby Clearwater Lake. Anglers can expect good fishing for Northern Pike and panfish. The last survey was in 2014. <br> \n <br> \nEmergent plants are common in the lake, primarily cattails. Submerged vegetation is abundant, but has not been surveyed recently. Eurasian watermilfoil and zebra mussels (invasive species) are present and boaters should take extra precautions to prevent their spread to other lakes.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike numbers were above the expected range of values for lakes similar to Augusta and much higher than 2015. Lengths ranged from 17.6 inches to 32.0 inches with an average length and weight of 22.4 inches and 2.4 pounds. Eleven percent of Northern Pike were 26 inches or longer. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass were sampled by day time electrofishing on June 3rd. The catch (21.2/hour) was well below the Sauk Rapids average (43/hour), but similar to 2014 (25/hour). Bass size was good; lengths ranged from 7.1 to 19.7 inches with an average length of 14.4 inches. Fifty percent were 15 inches or longer. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye are not stocked in Augusta Lake but likely immigrate from Clearwater Lake. The Walleye catch was low, but within the expected range of values for lakes similar to Augusta and close to past results. Lengths ranged from 14.4 to 21.9 inches with an average length and weight of 19.5 inches and 2.4 pounds.  <br> \n <br> \nBluegill numbers were higher than 2014 but within the expected range of values for similar lakes. Bluegill lengths ranged from 3.2 to 8.7 inches with an average length of 5.2 inches. Two percent of Bluegill caught were eight inches or longer. Black Crappie numbers were higher than 2014 and within the expected range of values. Black Crappie lengths ranged from 3.2 to 13.5 inches with an average length of 7.9 inches. Forty-six percent of Black Crappie were 10 inches or longer. <br> \n <br> \nThe Yellow Perch catch rate was much higher than 2014 but within the expected range of values for lakes similar to Augusta. Lengths ranged from 4.9 to 7.6 inches with an average length of 5.6 inches. It seems surprising that both perch and pike numbers have increased since 2014.  <br> \n <br> \nOther species captured included: Black Bullhead, Brown Bullhead, Channel Catfish, Cisco (Tullibee), Common Carp, Hybrid Sunfish, Pumpkinseed, White Sucker, and Yellow Bullhead. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Augusta is a 177 acre lake located along the Clearwater River in Wright County.  Lake Augusta may be accessed from Clearwater Lake.  In 2005, all of the lakes along the Clearwater River were surveyed including Louisa/Marie, Caroline, Augusta, Clearwater, and Grass lakes.  Largemouth Bass Night electrofishing on May 19, 2005 produced a catch of 16.3 largemouth per hour.  The mean length of largemouth was 12.5 inches. Some problems were encountered with the electrofishing gear so the sampling effort was incomplete.  Connecting lake, Clearwater, produced a catch of 48.9 and 98.2 largemouth per hr in the east and west basins, respectively.  Anglers can expect good fishing for largemouth.Northern PikeThe northern pike gill net catch rate in 2005 (14.3 fish/net) was significantly higher than that observed in 1997 (5.3 fish/net).  Northern pike ranged in length from 14.6 to 36.0 inches.  Mean length and weight of northern pike sampled was 21.8 inches and 2.4 pounds.  Anglers have reported good fishing for smaller sized northern pike.WalleyeThe walleye gill net catch rate in 2005 (1.2 fish/net) declined from that observed in 1997 (5.5 fish/net).  However, the mean length and weight for walleye sampled was above average at 19.3 inches and 3.2 pounds.  No walleye are stocked in Lake Augusta, but fish may move into the lake from adjoining Clearwater Lake.  With recent stocking success at Clearwater Lake it is expected that walleye will become more abundant at Augusta Lake also.BluegillThe bluegill catch rate (13.9 fish/net) was similar to that observed during the 1997survey (9.3 fish/net).    Bluegill sampled ranged in length from 3.2 inches to 8.3 inches with a mean length of 6.5 inches.  Sunfish are the most commonly caught fish in Augusta and Clearwater Lakes.Black CrappieThe catch rate of black crappie (2.9 fish/net) was similar to that observed in 1997 (3.2 fish/net) and is within the range of expected values for similar lakes.  Black crappies ranged in length from 7.8  to 10.4 inches with a mean length of 9.2 inches.Other fish species sampled during the survey included: black, brown and yellow bullheads, bowfin, common carp, green and pumpkinseed sunfish, tullibee, and white sucker.  </p>",
