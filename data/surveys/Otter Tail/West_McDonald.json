                "narrative": "<p>     West McDonald Lake is located in north-central Otter Tail County approximately four miles south of Vergas, MN.  West McDonald Lake is a 573-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake that is located within the Otter Tail River Watershed.  There are no inlets or outlets connected to West McDonald Lake.  The immediate watershed is composed of agricultural land interspersed with hardwood woodlots.  The maximum depth of West McDonald Lake is 75 feet; however, 32% of the lake is less than 15 feet in depth.  The secchi disk reading during the 2011 lake survey was 14.1 feet, which indicates excellent water clarity.  Previous secchi disk readings have ranged from 13.6 to 17.1 feet.   <br> \n     The majority of the shoreline of West McDonald Lake has been extensively developed.  The development is primarily composed of homes and cabins.  A DNR owned concrete public water access is located off of County Road 85 along the southwest shoreline of the lake.  The shoal water substrates consist of sand and gravel.  Small stands of hardstem bulrush and common cattail are scattered along the south and east shorelines of the lake.  Emergent aquatic plants such as bulrush and cattail provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat, and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms, and can actually absorb and break down polluting chemicals.  Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish such as northern pike, largemouth bass, and panfish.  They also serve as important nursery areas for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit.  To maintain the excellent water quality and angling that this lake has to offer, it is imperative to preserve the quality of the aquatic habitat. <br> \n     West McDonald Lake can be ecologically classified as a bass-panfish type of lake and this is reflected in the assemblage of the fish community.  Largemouth bass, walleye, and bluegill are the dominant gamefish species in the fish community.  <br> \n      Catch data from recent test-netting and electrofishing assessments indicate that a high-density largemouth bass population exists in West McDonald Lake.  Length data from these assessments indicate that the bass population is dominated by small fish.  Age data from recent assessments also indicate that bass reproduction levels are consistently high.  Growth rate estimates indicate that bass growth is slow, most likely due to the high-density population which increases competition for the available forage.  Bass attain an average length of 12.5 inches at six years of age.   <br> \n     The bluegill test-net catch rate has remained stable over the recent series of lake surveys; however, the long-term trend has been a decline in bluegill catch rates.  The decline in catch rates corresponds with a long-term increase in the average size of bluegill.  Forty-two percent of the bluegills were at least 7.0 inches in length.  Bluegills attain an average length of 6.6 inches at six years of age. <br> \n     The walleye test-net catch rate was the highest ever recorded for this lake.  Walleyes ranged in length from 8.7 to 26.4 inches with an average length and weight of 16.4 inches and 1.7 pounds.  The 2009 and 2010 year classes appear to be strong and should provide consistently good walleye angling for several years.  Walleyes attain an average length of 14.7 inches at four years of age.     <br> \n     Anglers can maintain the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large-size fish while allowing the harvest of the more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of nearshore fish species in West McDonald Lake was conducted on August 28-29, 2023, by Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program staff. Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake, and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot seine were completed at fourteen sampling stations. Nearshore sampling captured fourteen species of fish including five species that are intolerant of disturbance (i.e., Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, and Mimic Shiner) and one that is tolerant of disturbance (i.e., Green Sunfish). <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore data will be combined with gill net and trap net data from a survey planned for 2025 to describe the fish community and provide a fish-based IBI (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment. In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g., Blackchin Shiner, Iowa Darter, and Rock Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g., Black Bullhead and Green Sunfish). The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.  <br> \n <br> \nResults from this survey will be considered when the biological health of West McDonald Lake is assessed during the Otter Tail River Watershed assessment process, which will be completed in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.</p>",

The bluegill trap net catch rate declined to about half the level in 1982; however, the catch rate is still very high and was dominated by smaller sized fish. The walleye gillnet catch rate increased from 8.6 per net in the 1982 survey to 10.4 per net.  Evaluation of walleye natural reproduction is confounded by the lack of skip years; however, representatives of the 1985 year-class (a skip year) were sampled, indicating that natural reproduction is occurring.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>West McDonald Lake is located in north-central Otter Tail County approximately four miles south of Vergas, MN.  West McDonald Lake is a 573-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake that is located within the Otter Tail River Watershed.  There are no inlets or outlets connected to West McDonald Lake.  The immediate watershed is composed of agricultural land interspersed with hardwood woodlots.  The maximum depth of West McDonald Lake is 75 feet; however, 32% of the lake is less than 15 feet in depth.  The secchi disk reading during the 2003 lake survey was 13.6 feet which indicates excellent water clarity.  Previous secchi disk readings have ranged from 14.4 to 17.1 feet.  Periodic plankton/algae blooms throughout the summer months can influence secchi disk readings.  West McDonald Lake is included in class 23 of the MNDNR lake classification scheme.       The majority of the shoreline of West McDonald Lake has been extensively developed.  The development is comprised primarily of homes and cabins.  The 1981 lake resurvey referenced 182 homes/cabins along the shoreline.  A DNR owned concrete public water access is located off of county road 85 along the southwest shoreline of the lake.  The shoal water substrates consist of sand and gravel.  Small stands of hardstem bulrush and common cattail are scattered along the south and east shorelines of the lake.  Emergent aquatic plants such as bulrush and cattail provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat, and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms, and can actually absorb and break down polluting chemicals.  Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish such as northern pike, largemouth bass, and panfish.  They also serve as important nursery areas for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit.  To maintain the excellent water quality and angling that this lake has to offer, it is imperative to preserve the quality of the aquatic habitat.     West McDonald Lake can be ecologically classified as a bass-panfish type of lake and this is reflected in the assemblage of the fish community.  Largemouth bass, walleye, and bluegill are the dominant species in the fish community.      Catch data from recent test-netting and electrofishing assessments indicate that a high-density largemouth bass population exists in West McDonald Lake.  Length data from these assessments indicate that the bass population is dominated by fish less than 14.0 inches in length.  Growth rate estimates indicate that bass growth is slow, most likely due to the high-density population which increases competition for the available forage.  Bass attain an average length of 11.6 inches at four years of age.       The bluegill test-net catch rate has remained stable over the recent series of lake surveys; however, the long-term trend has been a decline in bluegill catch rates.  The current catch rate is within the normal range for lake class 23 lakes.  The decline in catch rates corresponds with a long-term increase in the average size of bluegill.  Bluegills attain an average length of 7.0 inches at six years of age.     The walleye test-net catch rate exceeded the upper limit of the normal range for class 23 lakes.  The walleye catch rate has exceeded the upper limit in every survey conducted.  Walleye ranged in length from 12.2 to 27.0 inches with an average length and weight of 16.5 inches and 1.6 pounds.  The 2000 year class appears to be strong and should provide consistently good walleye angling for several years.  Walleye attain an average length of 14.8 inches at four years of age.         Data from recent test-netting assessments indicate that walleye natural reproduction is very limited in West McDonald Lake and that walleye fingerling stocking is maintaining the population.  Catch rate data over the recent series of surveys indicate that the walleye population can be maintained at or above management goals by stocking walleye fingerlings on a biennial basis.  The DNR does not stock any fish species other than walleye in West McDonald Lake.  The other species present are able to sustain their levels at or above management goals without stocking.  This is an indication of the excellent water quality and fish habitat that is available.  To maintain the excellent fishing that this lake has to offer, it is imperative to preserve the water quality and fish habitat.     Anglers can also maintain the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large-size fish while allowing the harvest of the more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future.         </p>",

Other area lakes in this class are:  East Silent, Ethel, Paul, Seven, and Six. <br> \n     Northern pike abundance decreased from 2.0 per gill net lift in the 1987 survey to 0.4 per net, which is well below the normal range for this lake class.   <br> \n     Bluegill abundance decreased from 109.5 per trap net lift in 1987 to 44.0 per net, but remains above the normal range.  Three year classes of bluegills dominated the sample.  Bluegill growth rates are very slow when compared to statewide averages.  Six percent of the bluegills measured were 7.0 inches or greater in length compared to 14% in 1987.   <br> \n     Yellow perch abundance increased from 1.0 per gill net lift in 1987 to 1.8 per net, which is in the lower portion of the normal range.   <br> \n     Walleye abundance decreased from 10.4 per gill net lift on 1987 to 7.2 per net, but remains well above the upper limit of the normal range.  Average weight of individual walleye increased from 0.9 pounds in 1987 to 1.2 pounds. The 1984 and 1989 year classes dominated the sample, comprising 29% and 56% of the sample, respectively.  These year classes correspond to years of walleye fingerling stocking.  Year classes appear to be weak in years when walleye were not stocked, indicating limited reproduction. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>     West McDonald Lake is located in north-central Otter Tail County approximately four miles south of Vergas, MN.  West McDonald Lake is a 573-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake that is located within the Otter Tail River Watershed.  There are no inlets or outlets connected to West McDonald Lake.  The immediate watershed is composed of agricultural land interspersed with hardwood woodlots.  The maximum depth of West McDonald Lake is 75 feet; however, 32% of the lake is less than 15 feet in depth.  The secchi disk reading during the 2007 lake survey was 15.2 feet, which indicates excellent water clarity.  Previous secchi disk readings have ranged from 13.6 to 17.1 feet.   <br> \n     The majority of the shoreline of West McDonald Lake has been extensively developed.  The development is primarily composed of homes and cabins.  The 1981 lake resurvey referenced 182 homes/cabins along the shoreline.  A DNR owned concrete public water access is located off of county road 85 along the southwest shoreline of the lake.  The shoal water substrates consist of sand and gravel.  Small stands of hardstem bulrush and common cattail are scattered along the south and east shorelines of the lake.  Emergent aquatic plants such as bulrush and cattail provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat, and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms, and can actually absorb and break down polluting chemicals.      Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish such as northern pike, largemouth bass, and panfish.  They also serve as important nursery areas for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit.  To maintain the excellent water quality and angling that this lake has to offer, it is imperative to preserve the quality of the aquatic habitat. <br> \n     West McDonald Lake can be ecologically classified as a bass-panfish type of lake and this is reflected in the assemblage of the fish community.  Largemouth bass, walleye, black crappie, and bluegill are the dominant gamefish species in the fish community.  <br> \n      Catch data from recent test-netting and electrofishing assessments indicate that a high-density largemouth bass population exists in West McDonald Lake.  Length data from these assessments indicate that the bass population is dominated by small fish.  Age data from recent assessments also indicate that bass reproduction levels are consistently high.  Growth rate estimates indicate that bass growth is slow, most likely due to the high-density population which increases competition for the available forage.  Bass attain an average length of 11.0 inches at four years of age.   <br> \n     Catch data from a spring trapnetting assessment indicate that black crappies are abundant.  Age data indicate that black crappie reproduction is consistently good.  Black crappie size structure is also good; seventy percent of the sample was at least 10.0 inches in length.  Black crappie attain an average length of 9.5 inches at four years of age. <br> \n     The bluegill test-net catch rate has remained stable over the recent series of lake surveys; however, the long-term trend has been a decline in bluegill catch rates.  The decline in catch rates corresponds with a long-term increase in the average size of bluegill.  Twenty-five percent of the bluegills were at least 7.0 inches in length.  Bluegills attain an average length of 6.6 inches at seven years of age. <br> \n     The walleye test-net catch rate has also remained stable over the recent series of lake surveys. Walleye ranged in length from 8.3 to 23.7 inches with an average length and weight of 15.7 inches and 1.4 pounds.  The 2004 year class appears to be strong and should provide consistently good walleye angling for several years.  Walleye attain an average length of 13.2 inches at three years of age.     <br> \n     Data from recent test-netting assessments indicate that walleye natural reproduction is very limited in West McDonald Lake and that walleye fingerling stocking is maintaining the population.  Catch rate data over the recent series of surveys indicate that the walleye population can be maintained at or above management goals by stocking walleye fingerlings on a biennial basis.   <br> \n     The DNR does not stock any fish species other than walleye in West McDonald Lake.  The other species present are able to sustain their levels at or above management goals without stocking.  This is an indication of the excellent water quality and fish habitat that is available.  To maintain the excellent fishing that this lake has to offer, it is imperative to preserve the water quality and fish habitat. <br> \n     Anglers can also maintain the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large-size fish while allowing the harvest of the more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>     West McDonald Lake is located in north-central Otter Tail County approximately four miles south of Vergas, MN.  West McDonald Lake is a 573-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake that is located within the Otter Tail River Watershed.  There are no inlets or outlets connected to West McDonald Lake.  The immediate watershed is composed of agricultural land interspersed with hardwood woodlots.  The maximum depth of West McDonald Lake is 75 feet; however, 32% of the lake is less than 15 feet in depth.  The secchi disk reading during the 2015 lake survey was 13.2 feet.  Previous secchi disk readings have ranged from 13.6 to 17.1 feet.   <br> \n     The majority of the shoreline of West McDonald Lake has been extensively developed.  The development is primarily composed of homes and cabins.  A DNR owned concrete public water access is located off of County Road 85 along the southwest shoreline of the lake.  The shoal water substrates consist of sand and gravel.  Small stands of hardstem bulrush and common cattail are scattered along the south and east shorelines of the lake.  Emergent aquatic plants such as bulrush and cattail provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat, and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms, and can actually absorb and break down polluting chemicals.  Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish such as Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, and panfish.  They also serve as important nursery areas for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit.  To maintain the excellent water quality and angling that this lake has to offer, it is imperative to preserve the quality of the aquatic habitat. <br> \n     West McDonald Lake can be ecologically classified as a bass-panfish type of lake and this is reflected in the assemblage of the fish community.  Largemouth bass, Walleye, and Bluegill are the dominant gamefish species in the fish community.  <br> \n      Catch data from recent test-netting and electrofishing assessments indicate that a high-density Largemouth Bass population exists in West McDonald Lake.  Length data from these assessments indicate that the bass population is dominated by small fish.  Age data from recent assessments also indicate that bass reproduction levels are consistently high.  Growth rate estimates indicate that bass growth is slow, most likely due to the high-density population which increases competition for the available forage.  Bass ranged in length from 4.5 to 14.0 inches with an average length and weight of 10.4 inches and 0.6 pounds.  Bass attain an average length of 11.1 inches at four years of age.   <br> \n     The long-term trend has been a decline in Bluegil abundance.  The decline in abundance corresponds with a long-term increase in the average size of Bluegill.  Thirty-nine percent of the Bluegills were at least 7.0 inches in length.  Bluegills attain an average length of 7.0 inches at five years of age. <br> \n     Walleye abundance has consistently exceeded management goals.  Walleyes ranged in length from 10.4 to 24.1 inches with an average length and weight of 15.8 inches and 1.4 pounds.  Multiple year classes appear to be strong and should provide consistently good Walleye angling for several years.  Walleyes attain an average length of 15.1 inches at four years of age.     <br> \n     Anglers can maintain the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large-size fish while allowing the harvest of the more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>     West McDonald Lake is a 573-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located in north-central Otter Tail County, approximately four miles south of Vergas, MN.  West McDonald Lake is within the Otter Tail River Watershed.  There are no inlets or outlets connected to West McDonald Lake.  The immediate watershed is composed of agricultural land interspersed with hardwood woodlots.  The maximum depth is 75 feet; however, 32% of the lake is 15 feet or less in depth.  The secchi disk reading during the 2019 lake survey was 14.1 feet, which indicates excellent water clarity.  Previous secchi disk readings have ranged from 13.2 to 17.1 feet.   <br> \n     The majority of the shoreline of West McDonald Lake has been extensively developed with homes and cabins.  A DNR owned concrete public water access is located off of County Road 85 along the southwest shoreline of the lake.  The shoal water substrates consist of sand and gravel.  Small stands of hardstem bulrush and common cattail are scattered along the south and east shorelines of the lake.  Emergent aquatic plants such as bulrush and cattail provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat, and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms, and can absorb and break down polluting chemicals.  Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish such as Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, and panfish.  They also serve as important nursery areas for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit.  To maintain the excellent water quality and angling that this lake has to offer, it is imperative to preserve the quality of the aquatic habitat. <br> \n     West McDonald Lake can be ecologically classified as a bass-panfish-walleye type of lake and this is reflected in the assemblage of the fish community.  Largemouth Bass, Walleye, and Bluegill are the dominant gamefish species.  <br> \n      Catch and length data from recent surveys indicate that a high-density Largemouth Bass population that is dominated by small fish is present.  Growth rate estimates indicate that bass growth is slow, most likely due to the high-density population which increases competition for the available forage.  Bass ranged in length from 6.8 to 15.4 inches with an average length and weight of 10.9 inches and 0.8 pounds.  Bass attain an average length of 11.0 inches at four years of age.   <br> \n     The long-term trend is an increase in the average size of Bluegills.  Thirty-four percent of the Bluegills were at least 7.0 inches in length and 8% were 8.0 inches or greater in length.  Bluegills attain an average length of 6.9 inches at six years of age. <br> \n     Walleyes ranged in length from 11.3 to 21.9 inches with an average length and weight of 17.5 inches and 1.8 pounds.  Multiple year classes are present and should provide consistent Walleye angling for several years.  Walleyes attain an average length of 15.4 inches at four years of age.     <br> \n     Anglers can maintain the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large-size fish while allowing the harvest of the more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future. <br> \n     West McDonald Lake was designated as infested with zebra mussels in 2019.  Aquatic invasive species are threatening Minnesota waters.  Aquatic invasive species can potentially harm water quality, water recreation, aquatic habitat, native species, and fish populations.  Anglers can help prevent the introduction and spread of invasive species by following watercraft transportation laws.  <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>West McDonald Lake is located in north-central Otter Tail County approximately four miles south of Vergas, MN.  West McDonald Lake is a 573-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake that is located within the Otter Tail River Watershed.  There are no inlets or outlets connected to West McDonald Lake.  The immediate watershed is composed of agricultural land interspersed with hardwood woodlots.  The maximum depth of West McDonald Lake is 75 feet; however, 32% of the lake is less than 15 feet in depth.  The secchi disk reading during the 1999 lake survey was 14.4 feet which indicates excellent water clarity.  Previous secchi disk readings have ranged from 15.0 to 17.1 feet.  Periodic plankton/algae blooms throughout the summer months can influence secchi disk readings.  Benchmark records indicated that the water level at the time of the survey was at least one-foot higher than in the three previous surveys (1987 to 1995).  The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different lake classes based on physical and chemical characteristics of the lakes.  West McDonald Lake is included in lake class 23 of this classification scheme.  West McDonald Lake is located within the DNR's Fergus Falls Management Area.     The majority of the shoreline of West McDonald Lake has been extensively developed.  The development is comprised primarily of homes and cabins.  The 1981 lake resurvey referenced 182 homes/cabins along the shoreline.  A DNR owned concrete public water access is located off of county road 85 along the southwest shoreline of the lake.  The shoal water substrates consist of sand and gravel.  Small stands of hardstem bulrush and common cattail are scattered along the south and east shorelines of the lake.  Emergent aquatic plants such as bulrush and cattail provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat, and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms, and can actually absorb and break down polluting chemicals.  Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish such as northern pike, largemouth bass, and panfish.  They also serve as important nursery areas for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit.  To maintain the excellent water quality and angling that this lake has to offer, it is imperative to preserve the quality of the aquatic habitat.     West McDonald Lake can be ecologically classified as a bass-panfish type of lake and this is reflected in the assemblage of the fish community.  Largemouth bass, walleye, and bluegill are the dominant species in the fish community.      Catch data from recent test-netting and electrofishing assessments indicate that a high-density largemouth bass population exists in West McDonald Lake.  Length data from these assessments indicate that the bass population is dominated by fish less than twelve inches in length.  Growth rate estimates indicate that bass growth is slow; bass reach an average length of 11.6 inches at four years of age.  The slow growth rates are most likely due to the high-density population which increases competition for the available forage.       The bluegill test-net catch rate has remained stable over the recent series of lake surveys; however, the long-term trend has been a decline in bluegill catch rates.  The current catch rate is equivalent to the upper limit of the normal range for lake class 23 lakes.  The decline in catch rates corresponds with a long-term increase in the average size of bluegill.  Thirty-nine percent of the bluegills in the 1999 survey were at least seven inches in length.  Bluegills reach an average length of 6.7 inches at eight years of age which is equivalent to the lower limit of the statewide normal range of growth for bluegills.     The walleye test-net catch rate exceeded the upper limit of the normal range for lake class 23.  The walleye catch rate has exceeded the upper limit in every survey conducted.  Walleye ranged in length from 10.4 to 19.9 inches with an average length and weight of 15.2 inches and 1.1 pounds.  The 1996 year class appears to be strong and should provide consistently good walleye angling for several years.  Walleye reach an average length of 15.0 inches at four years of age.  Growth rates are equivalent to average growth rates for walleye in lake class 23 lakes in the Fergus Falls Management Area.       Data from recent test-netting assessments indicate that walleye natural reproduction is very limited in West McDonald Lake and that walleye stocking is maintaining the population.  Catch rate data from the recent series of surveys indicate that the walleye population can be maintained at or above management goals by stocking walleye fingerlings on a biennial basis.  The DNR does not stock any fish species other than walleye in West McDonald Lake.  The other species present are able to sustain their levels at or above management goals without stocking.  This is an indication of the excellent water quality and fish habitat that is available.  To maintain the excellent fishing that this lake has to offer, it is imperative to preserve the water quality and fish habitat.     Anglers can also maintain the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large-size fish while allowing the harvest of the more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future.         </p>",
