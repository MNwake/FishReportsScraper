Ringo is a moderate sized (735 acres), shallow (10 feet maximum depth), aerated and productive lake located in Kandiyohi County. Ringo is connected and flows into Long Lake (aerated and fry stocked). <br> \n <br> \nWalleye fry are usually stocked every other year. Recent stockings include 2011 (540,541 Spicer strain fry), 2013 (537,536 Spicer strain fry), 2015 (500,110 Pike River strain fry) and 2017 (317,760 Pike River strain fry). Movement of fish between Ringo and Long Lake is possible. Walleye natural reproduction also occurs periodically in Ringo Lake. Both fry stockings and natural reproduction have contributed to the Walleye population based on surveys and historical data review. Ringo had been used as a local Walleye egg take lake in the past. <br> \n <br> \nAbundant YOY Walleye numbers (88.00 YOY/hour, 6.01 inches average) were captured in the 2017 fall night electrofishing survey. Moderate yearling Walleye numbers (12.00 fish/hour, 11.40 inches average) were also captured in 2017. Moderate YOY Walleye numbers (60.00 YOY/hour, 6.00 inches average) were captured in the 2015 fall electrofishing survey. No yearling Walleye were captured in 2015. Abundant numbers of small YOY Walleye (96.67 YOY/hour, 4.92 inches average) were captured in the 2013 fall electrofishing survey. Abundant numbers of small YOY Walleye (210.00 YOY/hour, 4.51 inches average) were also captured in the previous 2011 fall electrofishing survey. No Walleye yearlings were observed in the 2013 or 2011 fall surveys. The Ringo Lake historical average catch rate is 102.36 YOY/hour.  <br> \n <br> \nThe Ringo Lake fishery will be surveyed in the 2020 summer for all fish species. The next Walleye fry stocking is scheduled for 2019. Fall electrofishing surveys will be conducted during Walleye fry stocked years to assess the success or failure of the stockings. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

COMPARED TO OTHER LAKES IN CLASS 40, WAE, CAP, BLB (TRAPNETS ONLY), AND BLC (TRAPNETS ONLY) CATCH INDICES ARE HIGHER THAN THE MAJORITY OF THESE SIMILAR LAKES.  THERE APPEARS TO BE AN EXTREMELY LARGE 1990 YEAR CLASS OF WAE (FRY STOCKED) WHICH ARE GROWING AT AN ABOVE AVERAGE RATE.  THESE FISH COULD PROVIDE SOME TREMENDOUS ANGLING DURING THE 1992-93 SEASON FOR 13-15 INCH FISH.  ALL WAE FRY STOCKINGS SINCE 1986 HAVE PRODUCED YEAR CLASSES WITH 3-5 POUNDS FISH (1986, 1988 STOCKINGS) COMMONLY CAUGHT.  THE STOCKINGS OF BLC IN 1987 AND 1988 APPEAR TO HAVE ACCELERATED THE GROWTH OF THE BLC POPULATION THROUGH EXCELLENT NATURAL REPRODUCTION SUCCESS. INDIVIDUAL GROWTH RATES ARE AVERAGE.  NOP APPEAR TO BE AT A MODERATE ABUNDANCE FOR THIS CLASS OF LAKE, HOWEVER, THE MAJORITY OF THE FISH ARE OF QUALITY SIZE AND ARE EXHIBITING ABOVE AVERAGE GROWTH RATES.  BLG AND LMB APPEAR TO BE AT LOW ABUNDANCES WITH POOR NATURAL REPRODUCTION/ SURVIVAL SUCCESS.  THE MAJORITY OF CAP AND BLB ARE RELATIVELY SMALL (CARP, 4-9 INCHES, 12-17 INCHES: BLB, 6-8 INCHES), BUT ARE LARGE ENOUGH TO AVOID PREDATION FROM MOST OF THE PISCIVORES.  THE POPULATIONS OF CARP AND BLB ARE EXPECTED TO EXPAND (AT LEAST IN BIOMASS IF NOT IN NUMBERS ALSO) WHICH MAY FURTHER EXACERBATE THE HIGH TURBIDITY (ALGAE/ SUSPENDED SEDIMENTS) ALREADY FOUND IN THE LAKE.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Ringo is a moderate sized, shallow, and productive lake located in Kandiyohi County. Asix unit subsurface helixor aeration system is operated each winter to prevent winterkill ofgamefish in Ringo. Aeration was first operated in Ringo during the 1986-87 winter. Aquaticvegetation stands of hardstem bulrush and sago pondweed are common in Ringo. Blue-green algaeblooms are typical during the late summer months. A majority of Ringo is still undeveloped.The surrounding shoreland characteristics include hardwood and cedar trees, adjacent orconnected wetlands, pastures, 9 residential homes (1995 survey). Ringo is connected toHenderson Lake via an inlet along the east side and Long Lake via the outlet along thesoutheast side. In recent years, anglers have reported good fishing success for walleye andblack crappie.     Walleye were abundant in the 2000 summer assessment (14.25 fish/gillnet). The 2000walleye average size was adequate (1.14 lbs. and 14.65 inches, gillnets). The 1997 year classcomprised 37% of the 2000 total walleye catch. The walleye population is maintained by frystocking and natural reproduction. Walleye natural reproduction was moderate to excellent in1995, 1997, and 1999. Approximately 560,660 walleye fry were stocked in the spring of 2000.The 2000 walleye YOY abundance due to the fry stocking or natural reproduction was low (13.33YOY/hour, 5.80 inches average size).     Northern pike numbers were low in 2000 (1.00 fish/gillnet). The 2000 northern pikeaverage size was moderate (3.42 lbs. and 24.72 inches, gillnets). The largest northern pikecaptured was 32.48 inches.      Yellow perch numbers were nonexistent in the gillnets and low in the trapnets (0.22fish/trapnet) for the 2000 summer assessment. Yellow perch abundance was low in the threeprevious assessments for Ringo (<5.00 fish/gillnet).     Bluegill numbers were low in 2000 (1.56 fish/trapnet), but similar to the historicalaverage (1.22 fish/trapnet).  The 2000 bluegill average size from the trapnets was moderateto large (0.28 lbs. and 6.41 inches, trapnets). Bluegill growth rates in Ringo were at orabove the normal levels compared to area lakes.     Black crappie numbers were abundant in the 2000 assessment (21.78 fish/trapnet). The2000 black crappie average size from the trapnets was small (0.25 lbs. and 7.14 inches,trapnets). The largest black crappie captured in the 2000 summer assessment was 11.65 inches.The 1997 year class comprised 57% of the total 2000 summer assessment black crappie catch.Black crappie growth rates were normal compared to area lakes.     Carp numbers were moderately abundant in 2000 (7.50 fish/gillnet), but below the 1995survey (18.75 fish/gillnet). The 2000 carp average size from the gillnets was moderate (3.00lbs. and 19.39 inches, gillnets).     Black bullhead numbers were abundant in 2000 (67.00 fish/gillnet). The 2000 blackbullhead average size was large (0.43 lbs. and 9.03 inches, gillnets).     Future development has potential for negative impacts on the fishery and water qualityof Ringo Lake. Presently, the lake's water quality is fair to moderate. Blue-green algaeblooms can sometimes become a problem in the late summer. Although, these blooms are more aproduct of the lake's morphology (shallow depth, large fetch, frequent mixing of internalnutrients) than low nutrient inputs from external sources (row crop/septic/lawn runoff). Thefishery appears to be healthy for a variety of fish species. A population assessment will beconducted in 2004 to assess adult gamefish abundance, size, and growth.</p>",

Ringo is a moderate sized (735 acres), shallow (10 feet maximum depth), aerated and productive lake located in Kandiyohi County. Ringo is connected and flows into Long Lake (aerated and fry stocked). <br> \n <br> \nWalleye fry are usually stocked every other year. Recent stockings include 2011 (540,541 Spicer strain fry), 2013 (537,536 Spicer strain fry), 2015 (500,110 Pike River strain fry), 2017 (317,760 Pike River strain fry) and 2019 (501,661 Spicer Strain fry). Movement of fish between Ringo and Long Lake is possible. Walleye natural reproduction also occurs periodically in Ringo Lake. Both fry stockings and natural reproduction have contributed to the Walleye population based on previous surveys. Ringo had been used as a local Walleye egg take lake in the past. <br> \n <br> \nModerate YOY Walleye numbers (40.00 YOY/hour, 7.02 inches) were captured in the 2019 fall electrofishing survey. Abundant yearling Walleye (28.00 fish/hour, 11.18 inches) were captured in 2019. Abundant YOY Walleye numbers (88.00 YOY/hour, 6.01 inches) were captured in the 2017 fall electrofishing survey. Moderate yearling Walleye numbers (12.00 fish/hour, 11.40 inches) were captured in the 2017 fall electrofishing survey. Moderate YOY Walleye numbers (60.00 YOY/hour, 6.00 inches) were caught in the 2015 fall electrofishing survey. No yearling Walleye were captured in 2015. Abundant small sized YOY Walleye numbers were captured in the 2013 (96.67 YOY/hour, 4.92 inches) and 2011 (210.00 YOY/hour, 4.51 inches) fall electrofishing surveys. No Walleye yearlings were observed in the 2013 or 2011 fall surveys. The Ringo Lake historical average catch rate is 99.07 YOY/hour.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance in the most recent 2014 summer survey (6.50 fish/gillnet) was below the historical average (20.67 fish/gillnet) for Ringo. The 2014 Walleye average weight and length were 1.23 pounds and 14.95 inches from gillnets. The 2011 Walleye year class comprised 70% of the 2014 Walleye catch. <br> \n <br> \nThe Ringo Lake fishery will be surveyed in the 2020 summer for all fish species. The next Walleye fry stocking is scheduled for 2021. Fall electrofishing surveys will be conducted during Walleye fry stocked years to assess the success or failure of the stockings. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted fall daytime electrofishing survey was conducted for young of year \"YOY\" (fingerling sized) Walleye on Ringo during September 7, 2023. Fall electrofishing was conducted at two stations for a total of 25 minutes. The water temperature was 77 F. during the 2023 fall electrofishing survey. Submergent vegetation densities (sago pondweed, northern milfoil and coontail) were light in 2023. Water clarity was poor (0.5 feet). Blue-green algae bloom was moderate. We observed moderate numbers of adult Walleye, Common Carp, Bigmouth Buffalo, Largemouth Bass, Bluegill, Northern Pike, and Yellow Perch in the 2023 fall electrofishing survey. A targeted survey is generally used for sampling a specific kind of fish or time of year (i.e., spawning season, fall season, etc.) unlike a standard survey which samples a wider range of fish species during the summer months using standard methodology (i.e., standard time of year, set sampling stations, taking water clarity readings and oxygen/temperature profiles, etc.) and gears (i.e. lake survey gillnets, trapnets and possibly spring electrofishing for Largemouth Bass). <br> \n <br> \nRingo is a moderate sized (735 acres), shallow (10 feet maximum depth), aerated, and productive lake located in Kandiyohi County. Blue-green algae blooms are common during the late summer months on Ringo Lake. Clarity is often poor especially during late summer in Ringo. Emergent vegetation (hardstem bulrush, cattails) was abundant throughout the lake, especially near the islands, bay areas, and peninsulas. Shoalwater substrates consist primarily of sand, detritus, silt, and gravel. Water levels were low during 2021-23.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye natural reproduction occurs in Ringo, but is sporadic based on previous surveys. Walleye fry were recently stocked (300,000-540,000 fish) into Ringo Lake during 2011, 2013, 2015, 2017, 2019, 2022 and 2023. Approximately 351,600 Spicer Strain Walleye fry were stocked in 2023. <br> \n <br> \nLow YOY Walleye numbers (7.20 YOY/hour, 6.22 inches) were caught in the 2023 fall daytime electrofishing survey. Abundant YOY Walleye numbers (56.00 YOY/hour, 6.9 inches) were captured in the 2022 fall daytime electrofishing survey. YOY Walleye are probably more numerous than documented in 2022 and 2023 due to daytime electrofishing being less effective than nighttime electrofishing for catching YOY Walleye. The YOY Walleye numbers were low (4.00 YOY/hour, 7.7 inches) in the 2021 fall night electrofishing survey due to natural reproduction. There were moderate young of year \"YOY\" Walleye numbers captured in the 2019 fall night electrofishing survey (40.00 YOY/hour, 7.0 inches). Abundant YOY Walleye numbers were captured in 2017 (88.00 YOY/hour, 6.0 inches), 2015 (60.00 YOY/hour, 6.0 inches) and 2013 (96.67 YOY/hour, 4.9 inches) and 2011 (210.00 YOY/hour, 4.5 inches average length) fall night electrofishing surveys. The Ringo Lake fall electrofishing historical average catch rate and length are 88.62 YOY/hour and 6.0 inches respectively. The highest fall electrofishing catch rate of YOY Walleye occurred in 1994 (520.00 YOY/hour, 4.6 inches average length) during a fry stocked year. The highest fall electrofishing catch rate for YOY Walleye due solely to natural reproduction occurred in 1995 (129.00 fish/hour, 6.2 inches average length).  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance in 2020 summer survey (14.50 fish/gillnet) was below the historical average catch rate (19.90 fish/gillnet) for Ringo. The 2020 Walleye average size was moderate (1.52 pounds and 15.9 inches) from gillnets. The Walleye historical average weight is 1.07 pounds from gillnets. The 2020 Walleye catch rate of quality size (15.0 inches plus) was high (10.00 fish/gillnet). The 2017 Walleye year class comprised 58% of the 2020 Walleye catch. Walleye natural reproduction in Ringo is frequent, but often variable for producing successful year classes. Walleye fry are scheduled for annual. <br> \n <br> \nCurrent fish management activities on Ringo include monitoring the fish population on a periodic basis, monitoring winter dissolved oxygen levels, assisting the county with the operation of the aeration system, protecting aquatic vegetation through the permit process, preventing and educating about the spread of invasive species, participating in local watershed initiatives, and stocking various fish species as warranted. The Ringo Lake fishery will be sampled in the 2025 summer for all fish species and periodically for YOY Walleye by fall electrofishing. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Ringo Lake is located about 3 miles west of Spicer, MN. Ringo is a moderate size lake(716 acres) with a maximum depth of 10 ft. Nutrient levels are often high. Water clarity isvariable on Ringo depending upon the presence or absence of algae blooms. The past waterclarity readings taken on Ringo were 1.8 ft on 6/12/95, 0.5 ft on 6/18/91, 7.5 ft on 5/29/86.Ringo has two small islands and a large peninsula. In the 1930's, Ringo Lake was mostly dry.Winterkill was a common occurrence in Ringo Lake prior to 1986. A severe winterkill occurredduring the 1985-86 winter. An aeration (6 helixors) system was first installed in the winterof 1986-87 and has been in operation to the present time. There is a large double-crestedcormorant rookery located nearby on Long Lake and also scattered nesting along Ringo Lake.Emergent vegetation (hardstem bulrush, reed canary grass, common cattail, others) is abundantthroughout the adjacent shoreline areas. Submergent vegetation is low-moderate around themajority of the shoreline and bay areas. The most common submergent species include sagopondweed, coontail, water moss, and northern watermilfoil. Blue-green algae blooms are acommon occurrence on Ringo Lake. Filamentous algae can become abundant on the shoalwatersubstrates. The shoalwater substrates are mostly sand, detritus, muck, and silt. There areseveral marsh areas that connect or are adjacent to the lake. There are several intermittentinlets that enter Ringo Lake. One inlet connects Ringo Lake to Henderson Lake (grate barrierpresent) and another inlet to West Twin Lake (shallow winterkill lake). The outlet connectsto Long Lake. Residential development is limited to the north shore of Ringo (9 homes totalin 1995). Ringo Lake was managed as a game/waterfowl lake prior to the early 1980's. Thefishery consisted mostly of black bullhead, minnow species, and yellow perch prior toaeration. The 1947 waterfowl survey indicated that carp were not present within the lake.Gamefish were limited due to frequent winterkill conditions. Presently, Ringo Lake is managedfor walleye as primary species and black crappie, bluegill, northern pike, and largemouthbass as secondary species. Walleye fry were first stocked in 1986. Walleye fry are currentlyscheduled to be stocked (about 700,000 fry) after one documented poor year class asdetermined by fall electrofishing. Ringo was a popular walleye angling lake in the late1980's to the early 1990's. Presently, walleye numbers are moderate and angling success hasbeen fair to good during recent years. Local residents and anglers have expressed concernabout the increasing number of cormorants within the area and the birds effect on gamefishpopulations. Presently, cormorants are a federally protected bird.     Walleye abundance in 1995 (11.5 fish/gillnet) was within the normal range (3.2 - 15.3fish/gillnet) for similar lakes, and below the historical average (30.9 fish/gillnet).Walleye numbers significantly increased after the aeration system began operating in 1986(81.0 fish/gillnet, average size=10.8 inches during the 1991 survey). It is often typical forgamefish populations to first boom several years after aeration systems are installed inproductive lakes, then decrease to moderate levels. The cause of the initial boom is usuallyrelated to the high abundance of forage species (black bullhead) present, initial lack ofpredators, and the ability of gamefish to survive due to the aeration system. An importantforage species, black bullhead, has decreased substantially in recent years. The lack offorage species abundance is one of the limiting factors negatively affecting walleyeabundance in Ringo. The average size in 1995 (1.1 lbs) was above the historical average (0.7lbs). The largest walleye caught was 23.5 inches. Growth rates appear poor/fair the firstyear then good to excellent for older fish. There appears to be adequate walleye numbers froma 1992 year class (due to fry stocking or natural reproduction). Large numbers of walleyeyoung of year \"YOY\" were documented in 1995 (129.0 YOY/hour) and 1994 (520.0 YOY/hour). Theaverage YOY sizes were large in 1995 (6.2 inches), but small in 1994 (4.5 inches). The 1995year class was a result of natural reproduction. This 1994 year class may have been theresult of a fry stocking (716,000 fry in 1994) and/or natural reproduction. The 1995 springelectrofishing indicated a lower abundance (25.1 fish/hour) of the 1994 year class remaining(about 5%) compared to the previous fall survey. The overwinter survival estimate is probablyconservative due to potential differences in catchability (due to spatial distributions) offingerlings in the fall and spring electrofishing surveys. Overwinter survival of YOY fishmay be a problem during harsh winters even with aeration systems operating within the lake.     Northern pike abundance in 1995 (3.0 fish/gillnet) was within the normal range (1.2 -7.8 fish/gillnet) for similar lakes, but slightly below the historical average (4.4fish/gillnet). The 1995 catch rate of quality size plus fish (4.5 fish > 21 inches/net) wasslightly below the historical average (5.6 fish/net). The 1995 average length (23.4 inches)was slightly below the historical average (24.5 inches). The average weight was 2.8 lbs in1995. The largest northern pike caught was 33.0 inches. Growth rates appear good toexcellent. About 89% of the northern pike captured were from the 1993 year class. There wereno northern pike YOY captured during the 1994 and 3.0 YOY/hour in the 1995 fallelectrofishing surveys.     Yellow perch abundance in 1995 (3.0 fish/gillnet) was within the normal range (3.0 -22.5 fish/gillnet) for similar lakes, and comparable to the historical average (2.6fish/gillnet). The highest abundance occurred in 1986 (4.6 fish/gillnet). The 1995 averagesize (5.9 inches) was below the historical average (6.9 inches). The largest yellow perchcaught was 8.3 inches. Growth rates appear good. About 72% of the fish captured were from the1993 year class.     Bluegill abundance in 1995 (1.4 fish/trapnet) was within the normal range (1.0 - 14.9fish/trapnet) for similar lakes, but slightly above the historical average (1.1fish/trapnet). The 1995 average size (4.6 inches) was similar to the historical average (4.7inches). Growth rates appear average. Young of year bluegill were documented during the 1995August seining (3.3 fish/seine haul, average size=1.3 inches).     Largemouth bass abundance from the 1995 spring electrofishing survey (0.7 fish/hour) wasbelow the previous 1991 survey (1.3 fish/hour), and below the local area average (41.7fish/hour). The 1995 spring electrofishing average size was 7.5 inches. Natural reproductionappeared to be successful in 1994 and/or 1995 due to many small (3-8 inch) largemouth bassseen during the 1995 fall electrofishing survey.     Black crappie gillnet abundance in 1995 (16.0 fish/gillnet) was above the normal range(0.8 - 11.1 fish/gillnet) for similar lakes, and above the historical average (5.7fish/gillnet). The 1995 average size (6.4 inches) was below the historical average (7.2inches). Growth rates appear average. About 79% of the fish caught were from the 1993 yearclass.     Black bullhead abundance in 1995 (4.2 fish/trapnet) was within the normal range (1.3 -78.1 fish/trapnet) for similar lakes, but the lowest recorded value for Ringo Lake(historical average=149.3 fish/trapnet). Black bullhead abundance was 307.7 fish/trapnet in1986, and 136.1 fish/trapnet in 1991. The 1995 average size (8.4 inches) was above thehistorical average (7.0 inches). Commercial fishermen removed 11,700 lbs in 1986, 5,500 lbsin 1987, 600 lbs in 1989, 1,600 lbs in 1993, and 1,100 lbs in 1995. A combination of factorsprobably resulted in the black bullhead population decline which includes high predator fish(walleye) abundance during the late 1980's, high cormorant numbers, and commercial removal.Black bullhead numbers throughout Kandiyohi County lakes have significantly declined in thelast five years.     Carp abundance in 1995 (10.3 fish/trapnet) was above the normal range (0.7 - 5.1fish/trapnet) for similar lakes, and above the historical average (6.7 fish/trapnet). The1995 average size was 3.2 lbs from trapnets (historical average=1.9 lbs). There appears tobe moderate to abundant carp numbers throughout the chain of Ringo, Long, and East Solomonlakes.     Ringo Lake has undergone dramatic changes in the fish community structure since thestart of winter aeration in 1986-87. Walleye numbers boomed during the late 1980's and hassince dropped off to moderate levels in recent years. The initial boom and subsequent declineof gamefish numbers is typical after aeration systems are first operated for several yearsin productive lakes. Non-gamefish such as black bullhead (important forage for walleye insome lakes) have steadily decreased since aeration was initiated in 1986-87. However, othernon-gamefish such as carp have not declined, but these fish grow rapidly and may be in apredator's \"window of opportunity\" for only a short period of time. The abundant carp numbersare probably increasing turbidity in the lake (stirring up the bottom during feeding), thusinhibiting submergent vegetation growth. Black crappie numbers appear abundant which is dueto the abundant bulrush habitat and the species ability to thrive in turbid water conditionscaused by wind/wave action and carp feeding. The abundance of yellow perch (important foragefor walleye and northern pike) is low. Walleye fry stocking which produces large numbers ofsmall fingerlings (< 5 inches) by fall in shallow productive lakes may actually provide animportant forage base for both northern pike and adult walleye when other forage numbers arelow. It appears that high densities of walleye (6-8 inches) were present in Ringo for both1994 and 1995 due to fry stocking or natural reproduction. There was significant walleyenatural reproduction in Ringo Lake and connected Long Lake during 1995. Walleye naturalreproduction has been documented during other non-stocking years based on age classdistributions of fish caught in the summer survey nets. A combination of abundant fish(northern pike) and bird (cormorants) predators, low forage numbers of black bullhead(throughout Kandiyohi County) and yellow perch, possible competition for limited foodresources with abundant crappies, and perhaps poor overwinter survival of walleye fingerlingsduring some years may be limiting walleye numbers to successfully survive and recruit toquality size (15 inches). In past years, cormorants preyed primarily on abundant blackbullhead, thus cormorant predation on gamefish probably occurred but with minimal affect onthe total gamefish population numbers. Presently, black bullhead numbers are low, thusgamefish may be a greater portion of the cormorants's diet than in past years. In 1995, localresidents made counts of cormorants feeding on nearby Long Lake. An in depth study of thefood habitats and numbers of cormorants utilizing Long and other local lakes with follow uplake surveys of the fish populations is necessary to determine what impact these birds arehaving if any on the local fisheries. Future management activities include monitoring fishpopulations through lake population assessments and electrofishing surveys, stocking walleyefry as needed, protecting emergent vegetation habitat from increasing development pressures,and encouraging the implementation of best management practices within the watershed.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A re-survey was conducted on Ringo Lake during mid-June of 2014. Ringo is a moderate sized (735 acres), shallow (10 feet maximum depth), aerated, and productive lake located in Kandiyohi County. Ringo is part of the Hawk Creek Watershed. Total phosphorus levels were moderately high (0.066 ppm) for Ringo on June 9, 2014. Water clarity was poor (secchi=1.50 feet) and brown stained on June 16, 2014, but typical for Ringo Lake. Blue-green algae blooms are common during the late summer months on Ringo Lake. Sago pondweed has been the most frequently occurring submergent vegetation species in Ringo Lake. Submergent vegetation densities were generally low throughout the lake. Emergent vegetation (hardstem bulrush, cattails) was abundant throughout the lake, especially near the islands, bay areas, and peninsulas. Shoalwater substrates consist primarily of sand, detritus, silt, and gravel. A public shore fishing area is located along the north shore of Ringo. A public access boat ramp is located along the northwest corner. The immediate watershed consists primarily of wetlands, hardwoods, agricultural row crops, gravel pits, asphalt plant, and residential housing. There were 27 homes located along the Ringo lakeshore in 2014. Several new homes were constructed along the northwest corner within the past ten years. A new housing development is occurring along the southwest side of the lake. There are seven inlets that enter Ringo Lake. The largest inlet drains a large cattail marsh area \"Ringo-Nest Wildlife Management Area\" into Ringo Lake. Ringo connects to the Henderson outlet via a marsh during high water. This connection is a potential watershed breach to the Middle Fork of Crow River Watershed via Nest Lake. The Ringo outlet drains into Long Lake. Water levels were high during June and July of 2014. A slow no-wake zone was put in place for lakes in Kandiyohi and Stearns Counties during June thru early July of 2014. The DNR Spicer Fisheries Office manages Ringo for walleye, northern pike, bluegill, yellow perch and black crappie. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill numbers were low in 2014 (1.22 fish/trapnet), but similar to the historical average of 1.87 fish/trapnet. The bluegill average size was large (0.45 pounds and 7.78 inches) from trapnets in 2014. The bluegill historical average weight is 0.22 pounds from trapnets. Bluegill growth rates were excellent. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie numbers were abundant in 2014 (13.00 fish/trapnet) compared to similar lakes, but below the historical average of 20.27 fish/trapnet. The 2014 black crappie average size was moderate (0.31 pounds and 7.84 inches) from trapnets. The black crappie historical average weight is 0.22 pounds from trapnets. There were abundant numbers of moderate sized and larger (8.00 plus inches) black crappie (7.00 fish/trapnet) in the trapnets. Black crappie growth rates were moderate. The majority of black crappie captured were from the 2012 and 2010 year classes.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike numbers were abundant in 2014 (8.00 fish/gillnet) compared to the historical average of 4.39 fish/gillnet for Ringo. The 2014 northern pike average size was small (2.12 pounds and 21.47 inches) from gillnets. The northern pike historical average weight is 2.93 pounds from gillnets. The 2014 catch rate of moderate sized northern pike (21.00 plus inches) was high (4.00 fish/gillnet) and above the historical average (2.50 fish/gillnet). Northern pike growth rates were poor to fair. The 2011 year class comprised 45% of the 2014 northern pike catch.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye numbers were low in 2014 (6.50 fish/gillnet) compared to the historical average of 20.67 fish/gillnet. Walleye numbers were also low in the 2014 trapnets (0.78 fish/trapnet, 1.45 pounds average size). The 2014 walleye average size was moderate (1.23 pounds and 14.95 inches) from gillnets. The walleye historical average weight is 1.00 pounds from gillnets. Walleye growth rates were poor to fair for ages 1-3, but moderate for ages 4-6. The 2011 year class (fry stocked year) comprised 70% of the 2014 walleye catch. Walleye natural reproduction in Ringo is frequent, but variable for successful year classes produced. Walleye fry were recently stocked (approximately 540,000 fish) into Ringo Lake during 2007, 2009, 2011 and 2013. Fall electrofishing surveys have been conducted to evaluate spring walleye fry stockings. There were abundant young of year \"YOY\" walleye numbers captured in the 2013 (96.67 YOY/hour, 4.92 inches average length) and 2011 (210.00 YOY/hour, 4.51 inches average length) fall electrofishing surveys.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch numbers were low in 2014 (1.50 fish/gillnet) compared to similar lakes. The yellow perch historical average catch rate is 1.45 fish/gillnet for Ringo. The yellow perch average size was moderate (0.15 pounds and 6.92 inches) from gillnets. The yellow perch historical average weight is 0.14 pounds from gillnets. Yellow perch growth rates were moderate to excellent. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass numbers were fair in 2014 trapnets (0.44 fish/trapnet) for Ringo. The 2014 largemouth bass average size was 2.28 pounds. Growth rates were excellent. Although hardstem bulrush stands are abundant within Ringo, poor clarity and sparse submergent vegetation generally limits largemouth bass survival and numbers. <br> \n <br> \nBlack bullhead numbers were low in 2014 (8.00 fish/gillnet) compared to the historical average of 33.16 fish/gillnet. Black bullhead numbers were also low in the 2014 trapnets (8.22 fish/trapnet, 0.90 pounds average weight). The black bullhead average size was large (0.74 pounds and 10.85 inches) from gillnets. The black bullhead historical average weight is 0.46 pounds from gillnets. <br> \n <br> \nCarp numbers were moderate in 2014 (3.00 fish/trapnet) compared to the historical average of 3.79 fish/trapnet. The carp average size was large (6.28 pounds and 23.29 inches) from trapnets. The carp historical average weight is 3.42 pounds from trapnets. <br> \n <br> \nCurrent fish management activities on Ringo include monitoring the fish population on a periodic basis, monitoring winter dissolved oxygen levels, assisting the county with the operation of the aeration system, protecting aquatic vegetation through the permit process, preventing and educating about the spread of invasive species, participating in local watershed initiatives, and stocking various fish species as warranted. The Ringo Lake fishery will be sampled in the 2015 fall for young of year walleye and the 2019 summer for all fish species. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A population assessment was conducted on Ringo Lake during mid June of 2009. Ringo is a moderate sized (716 acres), shallow (10 feet maximum depth), aerated, and productive lake located in Kandiyohi County. Water clarity was poor (secchi=1.00 feet) and brown stained on June 23, 2009, but typical for Ringo Lake. Nutrient levels were high during June of 2004 (total phosphorus=0.118 ppm), but also typical for Ringo Lake. Blue-green algae blooms are common during the late summer months on Ringo Lake. Sago pondweed has been the most frequently occurring submergent vegetation species in Ringo Lake. Submergent vegetation densities were generally low throughout the lake. Emergent vegetation (hardstem bulrush, cattails) was abundant throughout the lake, especially near the islands, bay areas, and peninsulas. Shoalwater substrates consist primarily of sand, detritus, silt, and gravel. A public shore fishing area is located along the north shore of Ringo. A public access boat ramp is located along the northwest corner. The immediate watershed consists primarily of wetlands, hardwoods, agricultural row crops, gravel pits, asphalt plant, and residential housing. There were 14 homes located along the Ringo lakeshore in 2004. Several new homes were constructed along the northwest corner within the past ten years. A new housing development is occurring along the southwest side of the lake. There are six small inlets that enter Ringo Lake. The outlet connects to Long Lake. The DNR Spicer Fisheries Office manages Ringo primarily for walleye, northern pike, and black crappie. If a fry stocking is a failure, then the lake will generally be stocked again with fry the following spring. Walleye fingerling stocking is contingent in Ringo after successive fry stocking failures. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill numbers were high in 2009 (4.00 fish/trapnet) compared to historical catches, but moderate compared to similar lakes. The bluegill historical average catch rate is 1.98 fish/trapnet for Ringo. The 2009 bluegill average size was large (0.24 pounds and 6.28 inches) from trapnets. The bluegill historical average weight is 0.18 pounds from trapnets.  <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie numbers were moderate in 2009 (22.00 fish/trapnet) compared to historical catches, but abundant compared to similar lakes. The black crappie historical average catch rate is 21.48 fish/trapnet for Ringo Lake. The 2009 black crappie average size was small (0.13 pounds and 5.61 inches) from trapnets. The black crappie historical average weight is 0.20 pounds from trapnets. The 2009 catch rate of quality size (8.00 inches and larger) black crappie was moderate (4.22 fish/trapnet) in Ringo. Black crappie growth rates in Ringo were near the low end of the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-6. The 2008 black crappie year class comprised 51% of the 2009 black crappie population assessment catch. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike numbers were abundant to moderate in 2009 (5.50 fish/gillnet) compared to historical catches and similar lakes. The northern pike historical average catch rate is 3.79 fish/gillnet for Ringo. The 2009 northern pike average size was small (2.48 pounds and 20.44 inches) from gillnets. The northern pike historical average weight is 3.07 pounds from gillnets. The 2009 catch rate of preferred size (28.00 inches and larger) northern pike was moderate to high (2.00 fish/gillnet). Northern pike growth rates in Ringo were below the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-3, but within the normal ranges for ages 4-8. The 2006 northern pike year class comprised 22% of the 2009 population assessment northern pike catch.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye numbers were abundant in 2009 (24.00 fish/gillnet) compared to historical catches and similar lakes. Walleye were also abundant in the 2009 trapnets (6.33 fish/trapnet, 1.44 pounds average size). The walleye historical average catch rate is 23.03 fish/gillnet for Ringo. The 2009 walleye average size was small (0.65 pounds and 12.17 inches) from gillnets. The walleye historical average weight is 0.96 pounds from gillnets. The 2009 catch rate of quality size (15.00 inches and larger) walleye was low (1.50 fish/gillnet). Walleye growth rates in Ringo were near the low end or below the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-5, but above the normal ranges for ages 6-8. The 2005 and 2007 walleye year classes comprised 56% and 17% respectively of the 2009 walleye gillnet and trapnet catch. Walleye natural reproduction in Ringo is frequent, but variable for numbers produced.  <br> \n <br> \nA fall electrofishing survey of Ringo Lake was conducted on August 26, 2009. The fall electrofishing survey was conducted to evaluate a 2009 spring walleye fry stocking (537,116 fry). There were moderate numbers of small young of year \"YOY\" walleye (40.00 YOY/hour, 4.76 inches average length) captured in 2009. The Ringo Lake fall electrofishing historical average catch rate and length are 99.12 YOY/hour and 5.90 inches respectively. Walleye fry were also recently stocked into Ringo Lake during 2002-2005, 2007, and 2009. The highest fall electrofishing catch rate of YOY walleye occurred in 1994 (520.00 YOY/hour, 4.47 inches average length) during a fry stocked year. The highest fall electrofishing catch rate for YOY walleye due solely to natural reproduction occurred in 1995 (129.00 fish/hour, 6.16 inches average length).  <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch numbers were low in 2009 (0.50 fish/gillnet) compared to similar lakes. The yellow perch historical average catch rate is 1.44 fish/gillnet for Ringo. The 2009 yellow perch average size was moderate (0.18 pounds and 7.32 inches) from gillnets. The yellow perch historical average weight is 0.14 pounds from gillnets. <br> \n <br> \nBlack bullhead numbers were low in 2009 (1.50 fish/gillnet) compared to historical catches and similar lakes. Black bullhead numbers were also low in the 2009 trapnets (3.56 fish/trapnet, 1.02 pounds average weight). The black bullhead historical average catch rate is 37.36 fish/gillnet for Ringo. The 2009 black bullhead average size was large (1.04 pounds and 11.48 inches) from gillnets. The black bullhead historical average weight is 0.42 pounds from gillnets. <br> \n <br> \nCarp numbers were low in 2009 (1.00 fish/trapnet) compared to historical catches and similar lakes. The carp historical average catch rate is 3.93 fish/trapnet for Ringo Lake. The 2009 carp average size was small to moderate (2.60 pounds and 17.26 inches) from trapnets. The carp historical average weight is 2.84 pounds from trapnets. <br> \n <br> \nCurrent fish management activities on Ringo include monitoring the fish population on a periodic basis, monitoring winter dissolved oxygen levels, assisting the county with the operation of the aeration system, protecting aquatic vegetation through the permit process, participating in local watershed initiatives, and stocking various fish species as warranted. The Ringo fishery will be sampled in the 2014 summer for all fish species. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted fall night electrofishing survey was conducted for young of year \"YOY\" (fingerling sized) Walleye on Ringo during September 21, 2021. Fall electrofishing was conducted at six stations for a total of 60 minutes. The water temperature was 67 F. during the 2021 fall electrofishing survey. Submergent vegetation densities were generally absent or light at the different stations in 2021. Water clarity was poor (0.5 feet). We observed abundant numbers of Bluegill, Largemouth Bass, Shiner species and Yellow Perch in the 2021 fall electrofishing survey. <br> \n <br> \nRingo is a moderate sized (735 acres), shallow (10 feet maximum depth), aerated, and productive lake located in Kandiyohi County. Blue-green algae blooms are common during the late summer months on Ringo Lake. Sago pondweed has been the most frequently occurring submergent vegetation species in Ringo Lake. Submergent vegetation densities were generally low throughout the lake. Emergent vegetation (hardstem bulrush, cattails) was abundant throughout the lake, especially near the islands, bay areas, and peninsulas. Shoalwater substrates consist primarily of sand, detritus, silt, and gravel. Water levels were low during 2021.  <br> \n <br> \nYOY Walleye numbers were low (4.00 YOY/hour, 7.74 inches) in the 2021 fall electrofishing survey due to natural reproduction. There were moderate young of year \"YOY\" Walleye numbers captured in the 2019 fall electrofishing survey (40.00 YOY/hour, 7.02 inches). Abundant YOY Walleye numbers were captured in 2017 (88.00 YOY/hour, 6.01 inches), 2015 (60.00 YOY/hour, 6.00 inches) and 2013 (96.67 YOY/hour, 4.92 inches) and 2011 (210.00 YOY/hour, 4.51 inches average length) fall electrofishing surveys. The Ringo Lake fall electrofishing historical average catch rate and length are 94.32 YOY/hour and 5.94 inches respectively. Walleye fry were recently stocked (300,000-540,000 fish) into Ringo Lake during 2011, 2013, 2015, 2017 and 2019. The highest fall electrofishing catch rate of YOY Walleye occurred in 1994 (520.00 YOY/hour, 4.47 inches average length) during a fry stocked year. The highest fall electrofishing catch rate for YOY Walleye due solely to natural reproduction occurred in 1995 (129.00 fish/hour, 6.16 inches average length).  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance in 2020 summer survey (14.50 fish/gillnet) was below the historical average catch rate (19.90 fish/gillnet) for Ringo. The 2020 Walleye average size was moderate (1.52 pounds and 15.92 inches) from gillnets. The Walleye historical average weight is 1.07 pounds from gillnets. The 2020 catch rate of quality size (15.00 plus inches) Walleye was high (10.00 fish/gillnet). The 2017 Walleye year class comprised 58% of the 2020 Walleye catch. Walleye natural reproduction in Ringo is frequent, but often variable for successful year classes produced. Walleye fry are scheduled for stocking 2022. <br> \n <br> \nCurrent fish management activities on Ringo include monitoring the fish population on a periodic basis, monitoring winter dissolved oxygen levels, assisting the county with the operation of the aeration system, protecting aquatic vegetation through the permit process, preventing and educating about the spread of invasive species, participating in local watershed initiatives, and stocking various fish species as warranted. The Ringo Lake fishery will be sampled in the 2025 summer for all fish species. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A resurvey was conducted on Ringo Lake during mid June of 2004. Ringo is a moderate sized (716 acres), shallow (10 feet maximum depth), aerated, and productive lake located in Kandiyohi County. Water clarity was poor (secchi=1.17 feet) and brown stained in June of 2004, but typical for Ringo Lake. Nutrient levels were high (total phosphorus=0.118 ppm), but also typical for Ringo Lake. Blue-green algae blooms are common during the late summer months on Ringo Lake. Sago pondweed was the most frequently occurring submergent vegetation species in Ringo Lake. Submergent vegetation densities were generally low throughout the lake. Emergent vegetation (hardstem bulrush, cattails) was abundant throughout the lake, especially near the islands, bay areas, and peninsulas. Shoalwater substrates consist primarily of sand, detritus, silt, and gravel. A public shore fishing area is located along the north shore of Ringo. A public access boat ramp is located along the northwest corner. The immediate watershed consists primarily of wetlands, hardwoods, agricultural row crops, gravel pits, asphalt plant, and residential housing. Presently, there are 14 homes located along the Ringo lakeshore. Several new homes were constructed along the northwest corner within the past ten years. A new housing development is occurring along the southwest side of the lake. There are six small inlets that enter Ringo Lake. The outlet connects to Long Lake. The DNR Spicer Fisheries Office manages Ringo primarily for walleye, northern pike, and black crappie. In recent years, walleye fry have been stocked into Ringo Lake annually because walleye eggs have been for statewide hatching operations. If a fry stocking is a failure, then the lake will generally be stocked again with fry the following spring. Walleye fingerling stocking is contingent in Ringo after successive fry stocking failures.Bluegill numbers were moderate in 2004 (3.00 fish/trapnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes. The bluegill historical average catch rate is 1.58 fish/trapnet for Ringo. The 2004 bluegill average size was moderate (0.18 pounds and 5.72 inches) from trapnets. The bluegill historical average weight is 0.16 pounds from trapnets. The largest bluegill captured was 7.36 inches in the 2004 resurvey. Bluegill growth rates for Ringo were above the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-4. The 2001 bluegill year class comprised 46% of the 2004 bluegill resurvey catch.Black crappie numbers were abundant in 2004 (35.89 fish/trapnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes. The black crappie historical average catch rate is 21.40 fish/trapnet for Ringo Lake. The 2004 black crappie average size was small (0.15 pounds and 6.09 inches) from trapnets. The black crappie historical average weight is 0.22 pounds from trapnets. The largest black crappie captured was 12.91 inches in the 2004 resurvey. The 2004 catch rate of black crappie 8.00 inches and larger was moderate (6.83 fish/trapnet) in Ringo. Black crappie growth rates in Ringo were within the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-4. The 2003 black crappie year class comprised 52% of the 2004 black crappie resurvey catch.Northern pike numbers were moderate in 2004 (3.00 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes. The northern pike historical average catch rate is 3.45 fish/gillnet for Ringo. The 2004 northern pike average size was moderate to small (2.37 pounds and 23.60 inches) from gillnets. The northern pike historical average weight is 3.19 pounds from gillnets. Northern pike growth rates in Ringo were within the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-3. The 2001 northern pike year class comprised 87% of the 2004 resurvey northern pike catch. Walleye numbers were moderate in 2004 (7.33 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes, but low compared to the walleye historical average catch rate (22.84 fish/gillnet) for Ringo. The 2004 walleye average size was moderate (1.83 pounds and 15.98 inches) from gillnets. The walleye historical average weight is 1.03 pounds from gillnets. The largest walleye captured was 26.97 inches in the 2004 resurvey. The catch rate of walleye 15.00 inches and larger walleye was moderate (3.33 fish/gillnet) in 2004. Walleye growth rates in Ringo were within the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-3, and above the normal ranges for ages 4-8. The 2001 walleye year class comprised 26% of the 2004 resurvey walleye catch. Walleye natural reproduction in Ringo is frequent, but variable for numbers produced. A fall electrofishing survey of Ringo Lake was conducted on September 27, 2004. The fall electrofishing survey was conducted to evaluate a 2004 spring walleye fry stocking (441,943 fry). There were moderate young of year \"YOY\" walleye numbers (64.00 YOY/hour, 5.16 inches average length) captured in 2004. Other area walleye fry stocked lakes had generally low YOY walleye catch rates in 2004 fall electrofishing surveys. The Ringo Lake fall electrofishing historical average catch rate and length are 104.72 YOY/hour and 5.81 inches respectively. Walleye fry were also stocked into Ringo Lake during 1994, 1998, 2000, 2002, and 2003. The highest fall electrofishing catch rate of YOY walleye occurred in 1994 (520.00 YOY/hour, 4.47 inches average length) for a fry stocked year. The highest fall electrofishing catch rate for YOY walleye due to natural reproduction occurred in 1995 (129.00 fish/hour, 6.16 inches average length).Yellow perch numbers were low in 2004 (0.33 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes. The yellow perch historical average catch rate is 1.63 fish/gillnet for Ringo. The 2004 yellow perch average weight and length were 0.07 pounds and 5.59 inches from gillnets. The yellow perch historical average weight is 0.13 pounds from gillnets.Black bullhead numbers were moderate to abundant in 2004 (65.00 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes. The black bullhead historical average catch rate is 44.53 fish/gillnet for Ringo. The 2004 black bullhead average size was moderate (0.26 pounds and 7.86 inches) from gillnets. The black bullhead historical average weight is 0.29 pounds from gillnets.Carp numbers were moderate in 2004 (1.33 fish/trapnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes, but below the carp historical average catch rate (4.51 fish/gillnet) for Ringo Lake. The 2004 carp average size was moderate (4.26 pounds and 21.53 inches) from gillnets. The carp historical average weight is 2.91 pounds from gillnets.Current fish management activities on Ringo include monitoring the fish population on a periodic basis, monitoring winter dissolved oxygen levels, assisting the county with the operation of the aeration system, protecting aquatic vegetation through the permit process, participating in local watershed initiatives, and stocking various fish species as warranted. The Ringo fishery will be sampled in the 2008 summer for all fish species.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A standard survey was conducted on Ringo Lake during late June of 2020. A targeted survey is generally used for sampling a specific kind of fish or time of year (i.e. spawning season, fall season, etc.) unlike a standard survey which samples a wider range of fish species during the summer months using standard methodology (i.e. standard time of year, set sampling stations, taking water clarity readings and oxygen/temperature profiles, etc.) and gears (i.e. lake survey gillnets, trapnets and possibly spring electrofishing for Largemouth Bass). <br> \n <br> \nRingo is a moderate sized (735 acres), shallow (10 feet maximum depth), aerated, and productive lake located in Kandiyohi County. Ringo is part of the Hawk Creek Watershed. Total phosphorus levels were moderately high (0.066 ppm) for Ringo on June 9, 2014. Water clarity was fair (secchi=2.50 feet) and brown stained on June 29, 2020, but typical for Ringo Lake. Blue-green algae blooms are common during the late summer months on Ringo Lake. Sago pondweed has been the most frequently occurring submergent vegetation species in Ringo Lake. Submergent vegetation densities were generally low throughout the lake. Emergent vegetation (hardstem bulrush, cattails) was abundant throughout the lake, especially near the islands, bay areas, and peninsulas. Shoalwater substrates consist primarily of sand, detritus, silt, and gravel. A public shore fishing area is located along the northeast shore of Ringo. A public access boat ramp is located along the north side. The immediate watershed consists primarily of wetlands, hardwoods, agricultural row crops, gravel pits, asphalt plant, and residential housing. There were 27 homes located along the Ringo lakeshore in 2014. Several new homes were constructed in a new development area along the northwest corner of the southwest bay during recent years. There are seven inlets that enter Ringo Lake. The largest inlet drains a large cattail marsh area \"Ringo-Nest Wildlife Management Area\" into Ringo Lake. This connection is a potential watershed breach to the Middle Fork of Crow River Watershed via Nest Lake. Ringo connects to the Henderson outlet via a marsh during high water. The Ringo outlet drains into Long Lake. Water levels were low during 2020. The DNR Spicer Fisheries Office manages Ringo for Walleye, Northern Pike, Bluegill, Yellow Perch and Black Crappie.  <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie numbers were abundant in 2020 (56.78 fish/trapnet). The Black Crappie historical average catch rate is 24.83 fish/trapnet for Ringo Lake. The 2020 Black Crappie average size was small (0.18 pounds and 5.52 inches from trapnets). The Black Crappie historical average weight is 0.21 pounds from trapnets. The 2020 Black Crappie catch rate of fish 10.00 plus inches was low (4.00 fish/trapnet). Black Crappie growth rates were slow for ages 1-8. The 2019 and 2018 Black Crappie year classes comprised 65% and 20% respectively of the 2020 Black Crappie catch. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill numbers were abundant in 2020 (8.56 fish/trapnet) compared to the historical average (2.71 fish/trapnet). The 2020 Bluegill average size was moderate (0.23 pounds and 6.39 inches) from trapnets. The Bluegill historical average weight is 0.22 pounds from trapnets. The largest Bluegill captured was 10.31 inches in Ringo.  <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass were not sampled in gillnets or trapnets during the 2020 survey. Low numbers (0.44 fish/trapnet) were sampled in the previous 2014 survey. Summer gillnets and trapnets generally do not effectively sample Largemouth Bass compared to electrofishing. Although habitat such as bulrush stands are abundant within Ringo, poor water clarity and variable submergent vegetation generally limits Largemouth Bass survival and abundance. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike numbers were moderate in 2020 (3.00 fish/gillnet). The Northern Pike historical average catch rate is 4.22 fish/gillnet for Ringo. The 2020 Northern Pike average size was small (1.63 pounds and 19.17 inches) from gillnets. The Northern Pike historical average weight is 2.77 pounds from gillnets. The largest Northern Pike captured was 37.80 inches in the 2020 survey. Local Northern Pike fingerling production has occurred in recent years from various lakes. Pre-spawn Northern Pike were captured and moved from Ringo to drainable New London State Hatchery ponds for fingerling production in 2014. Northern Pike brood stock (68 adults) and part of the fingerling production (336 fish) were then returned to Ringo in 2014. Northern Pike possession limit regulations for Ringo in the North-central Zone are as follows: anglers can keep 10 Northern Pike, but not more than two pike longer than 26 inches; and all from 22 to 26 inches must be released. Northern Pike taken by spearing follow the same rules except one pike may be between 22 and 26 inches or two larger than 26 inches. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye numbers were abundant in 2020 (14.50 fish/gillnet). The Walleye average size was moderate (1.52 pounds and 15.92 inches) from gillnets. The Walleye historical average weight is 1.07 pounds from gillnets. The 2020 catch rate of quality size of Walleye 15.00 plus inches was high (10.00 fish/gillnet). Walleye growth rates were good for ages 1-8. The 2017 Walleye year class comprised 58% of the 2020 Walleye catch. Walleye natural reproduction in Ringo is frequent, but often variable for successful year classes produced.  <br> \n <br> \nFall electrofishing surveys have been conducted to evaluate a spring Walleye fry stockings or natural reproduction. There were moderate young of year \"YOY\" Walleye numbers captured in the 2019 fall electrofishing survey (40.00 YOY/hour, 7.02 inches). Abundant YOY Walleye numbers were captured in 2017 (88.00 YOY/hour, 6.01 inches), 2015 (60.00 YOY/hour, 6.00 inches) and 2013 (96.67 YOY/hour, 4.92 inches) and 2011 (210.00 YOY/hour, 4.51 inches average length) fall electrofishing surveys. The Ringo Lake fall electrofishing historical average catch rate and length are 99.07 YOY/hour and 5.84 inches respectively. Walleye fry were recently stocked (300,000-540,000 fish) into Ringo Lake during 2011, 2013, 2015, 2017 and 2019.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch numbers were moderate in abundance during 2020 (4.00 fish/gillnet) compared to the historical average catch rate (1.77 fish/gillnet) for Ringo. The 2020 Yellow Perch average size was small (0.09 pounds and 5.95 inches) from gillnets. The Yellow Perch historical average weight is 0.14 pounds from gillnets.  <br> \n <br> \nBlack Bullhead numbers were low in 2020 (6.00 fish/gillnet). Black Bullhead numbers were also low in the 2020 trapnets (2.22 fish/trapnet, 0.77 pounds average weight). The Black Bullhead historical average catch rate is 29.77 fish/gillnet for Ringo. The 2020 Black Bullhead average size was moderate (0.63 pounds and 10.07 inches) from gillnets.
