Total length in gill nets ranged from 9.5-23.6 inches and the average was 17.4.  Length at age-4 was 16.7 inches, which was 2 inches more than the average for the International Falls Management Area.

Over three times the lake class average number of northerns were sampled.  Average size sampled was 19.4 inches and 1.8 pounds.  The largest northern pike sampled was 28.3 inches.    Walleye were sampled in average to high numbers for this lake type.  Average size was 18.0 inches and 2.0 pounds.  The largest walleye sampled was 25.2 inches.  Natural reproduction appeared to be sufficient and consistent.    Yellow perch were sampled at a level almost three times the average for this lake type.  Average length sampled was 7.0 inches, and the largest perch sampled was 10.5 inches.    Growth for all species was similar to that in other Minnesota lakes.  Reproduction for all species appeared consistent, and  adequate.</p>",

Check with the US Forest Service to be sure the trail is currently open to ATV before making the trip. For those who make the effort to access the lake, Franklin should provide ample angling opportunities. Northern Pike are abundant, with an average length of 20 inches, and fish up to 31.9 inches sampled. Walleye are naturally reproducing and well above average in numbers for similar lakes. They also average over 16 inches and 1.5 pounds. Yellow Perch are fast growing and fairly abundant with fish up to 10.9 inches sampled. </p>",

Walleye, northern pike and yellow perch dominate the fish community.     The 1999 population assessment found walleye numbers remaining high with the average fish measuring 17.0 inches and weighing 1.7 pounds.  Walleyes up to 10 years old and 27.0 inches in length were found during this investigation.     Good numbers of northern pike were also present, although average length was only 19.2 inches and average weight was 1.7 pounds.  There was an occasional pike over 30 inches sampled in 1999.     High numbers of yellow perch were sampled with an average length of 8.5 inches and a range from 5.7 to 12.5 inches.  One additional forage species, white sucker, was also documented.</p>",

Check with the US Forest Service to be sure the trail is currently open to ATV before making the trip. Walleye are naturally reproducing and well above average in numbers for similar lakes, and are over 18 inches in length and just shy of 2 pounds on average. Northern Pike are abundant, with an average length of 20 inches, and fish up to 31.5 inches sampled. For those who make the effort to access the lake, Franklin should provide ample angling opportunities.</p>",
