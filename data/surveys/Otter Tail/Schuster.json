                "narrative": "<p>     Schuster Lake is included in class 28 of the MN DNR lake classification system.  Other area lakes in this classification are: Fladmark, Twenty-One and German. <br> \n     The gill net catch rate of 3.5 northern pike per net lift was within the normal range; however, the average pounds per lift was below normal with individual pike averaging 1.4 pounds.  Four year classes of pike were sampled, suggesting that adequate natural reproduction exists.   <br> \n     Bluegill abundance is high as the trap net catch rate of 208.3 per net lift is five times greater than the upper limit of the normal range.  Despite the high abundance of bluegill, the quality of the population is good with 34% measuring 7.0 inches or greater in length. Six consecutive year classes were documented, indicating that recruitment is consistent.  Bluegill growth rates are very slow with an average length of 3.9 inches at age-IV.   <br> \n     Natural reproduction of largemouth bass is documented by the presence of three year classes. Bass growth rates are slow with an average length of 9.3 inches at age-IV.  <br> \n     Two year classes of black crappies were sampled and growth rates approximate statewide averages.   <br> \n     The yellow perch gill net catch rate of 1.8 per net lift was below the normal range.  The wide range of yellow perch lengths sampled suggest multiple year classes are present.   <br> \n     Walleyes were not sampled. <br> \n</p>",
