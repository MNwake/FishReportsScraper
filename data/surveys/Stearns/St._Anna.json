                "narrative": "<p>St Anna Lake is a 119 acre lake located eight miles east of the city of St Rosa.  The maximum depth of the lake is 107 feet and during early July adequate oxygen is present down to 45 feet.  The main access is located on the west side of the lake.       St Anna Lake is located within 30 miles of the St Cloud area and therefore it receives light to moderate amounts of fishing pressure for a lake of its size.  Black crappie, largemouth bass, bluegill, walleye and northern pike are all present in the lake.  In the summer of 1996, a lake survey was conducted on St Anna Lake.  The netting of the lake revealed the following information about the fish population.        The northern pike catch rate in gill nets (11.3/lift) significantly increased from the 1991 survey (5.8/gill net).  This catch rate of northern pike was above expected levels for lakes that are similar to St Anna Lake.  The average size northern caught in gill nets weighed 2.7 pounds and was 22.8 inches long.  The growth rate of northern pike was average when compared with lakes similar to St Anna Lake.       The gill net catch rate of yellow perch in St Anna Lake (11.8/gill net) significantly increased from the last survey (2.0/gill net) but remained within expected levels for this lake type.  The average size yellow perch caught in gill nets was 6.2 inches in length and 0.1 pounds in weight.  While this average size may seem small, yellow perch are very important in a lake as they are a major source of food for larger predators like the northern pike and walleye.  The growth rate of yellow perch was average when compared with lakes similar to St Anna Lake.       The gill net catch rate of walleye in St Anna Lake (2.3/gill net) did not change from the last survey and remained within expected levels for this lake type.  The average size walleye caught in gill nets was 20.1 inches and 3.2 pounds.  The growth rate of walleye in St Anna Lake was average when compared with similar lakes.       The trap net catch of bluegills in St Anna Lake (106.5/trap net) did not appear to increase from the previous netting in 1991 (53.0/trap net) and remained above normal levels for this lake type.  Bluegill caught in trap nets ranged in size from 2.8-6.9 inches and averaged 5.1 inches in length.  The growth rate of bluegill was average when compared with lakes similar to St Anna Lake.       The catch rate of black crappie in trap nets (7.3/trap net) appeared to increase from the last netting (3.0/trap net) but remained above expected values for lakes similar to St Anna.  Two to five year old fish were caught and the average size black crappie was 5.7 inches.  The growth rate of black crappie in St Anna Lake was average when compared with similar lakes.       Largemouth bass were sampled by spring electrofishing.  A total of 23 bass were sampled at a rate of 11.5 per hour of run-time.  This catch rate was below the Montrose Area median for largemouth bass (20.0 bass per hour shocked).  The sampling occurred near the end of May, when historically electrofishing catch declines, therefore this lower rate may be an artifact of later sampling time rather than an indicator of a below average bass population.  Largemouth bass sampled ranged in size from 8.8-17.3 inches and averaged 15.2 inches in length.  The mean weight of bass caught (2.4 pounds) was large and the growth rate of largemouth bass was average.  In addition to this information, a population estimate for largemouth bass was done on St Anna Lake in 1992.  A total of 188 bass were marked during the initial survey and these fish ranged in length from 3.0- 21.0 inches.  The most common length group of bass sampled was from 11.5-11.9 inches.  A total of 78 fish were sampled during the second run, 6 of which were marked.  This provided a population estimate of 2,133 largemouth bass age I and older in St Anna Lake. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>St. Anna Lake (Rooney) is a 119-acre lake located eight miles east of St. Rosa in northern Stearns County.  The lake has a maximum depth of 107 feet with 26% of the lake area considered littoral (<15 ft deep).  The lake has 1.8 miles of shoreline and a water clarity of 7.5 feet.  There is one public access located on the west side of the lake.  The access was originally owned and maintained by the Albany Sportsmen's Club, but was donated to the DNR in 1992.  Walleye were originally stocked in 1971, but was discontinued in 1990 because of poor returns.  However, in 2005 and 2006 walleye fingerlings (1,000 in 2005 and 3,000 in 2006) were stocked by the Albany Sportsmen's Club.  Tullibees (Cisco) were also once present, however due to non-point source pollution they have been eliminated from the lake. <br> \n <br> \nNight electrofishing conducted on May 11, 2006 indicated that largemouth were abundant (254.7/hour).  This catch rate was over 20 times higher than in 1996 and over four times higher than the average catch rate for Montrose Area lakes (59/hr).  Largemouth bass ranged in length from 3 - 18 inches.  Reproduction has been consistent with multiple year classes being sampled during the survey.  Largemouth bass in St Anna Lake take 4 - 5 years to reach 12 inches.  Previous studies of largemouth bass conducted by DNR research personnel in 1992-1993 estimated the population of largemouth bass (greater than eight inches) to be 1,300 - 2,300. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike catch (8.5/gill net) was similar to 1996 and higher than average for similar lakes.  Northern pike ranged in length from 15 - 32 inches with a average length and weight of 21.7 inches and 2.3 pounds.  Multiple year classes were sampled during the survey, however no fish younger than 3 years old were sampled.  Northern pike in St Anna Lake reach 24 inches in length in five years. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye are not abundant in St. Anna Lake.  The catch rate of walleye in 2006 (2.2/gill net) was similar to 1991 and 1996, but within the expected range for similar lakes.  Walleye ranged in length from 7 - 25 inches with an average length and weight of 17.8 inches and 2.7 pounds.  Walleye were originally stocked in 1971, but was discontinued in 1990 due to poor returns.  In 2005 and 2006, the Albany Sportsmen's Club stocked 1,000 and 3,000 fingerlings. <br> \n <br> \nThe catch rate of bluegill (177.0/trap net) was 1.5 times higher than 1996 and almost nine times higher than the median value for similar lakes.  Bluegill ranged in length from 2 - 9 inches.  Reproduction has been consistent with multiple year classes being found during the survey.  Bluegills in St Anna Lake reach a length of seven inches in four years. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie catch (4.2/trap net) was similar to 1991 and 1996 and above average for similar lakes.  Black crappie ranged in length from 3 - 11 inches.  Reproduction has been consistent with multiple year classes being sampled during the survey.  Black crappies from St Anna Lake reach a length of eight inches 5 - 6. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled during the survey included: bowfin, brown bullhead, carp, hybrid sunfish, Johnny darter, pumpkinseed sunfish, white sucker and yellow bullhead.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Gamefish species present in St. Anna (Rooney) Lake were Northern Pike, Walleye, Largemouth Bass, Bluegill, and Black Crappie. Forage species present are Brassy Minnow, Golden Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, White Sucker, and Yellow Perch. Northern Pike were sampled at a rate of 3.5/gill net less than the local median but within the expected range. Age classes 3-8 were represented in the sample with age 5 being most abundant at 36% of the sample. Growth rates for all ages were normal. Numbers of pike are similar to that of the 1980 survey. The average weight of sampled northern pike was large at 5.9 pounds. The Walleye catch was also near the local median and similar to that of the 1980 survey age classes 2, 4, 6 and 7 were represented, which precisely corresponds to stocking records. Growth rates were fast during year 3 and then declined to average rates thereafter. Bluegill numbers were twice the local median, yet remain within the expected range. This figure is also twice that of the 1980 survey. Age classes 1-5 were represented and age 3 was predominant with 111 of 141 fish. Growth rates were normal. Lengths ranged from 3.2 to 8.2 inches. Other species present in St. Anna were Bowfin (dogfish), Black and Yellow Bullheads, Green, Pumpkinseed, and Hybrid Sunfish, and Johnny Darters. Ciscoes (Tullibee), Common Carp, and Greater Redhorse have appeared in past fisheries surverys.</p>",

All were taken in average numbers, within the 1st-3rd quartile range for lake class 23; and all catches were similar to the last two surveys.  Northern pike were caught at a rate of 5.8/gill net with an average weight of 2.5 pounds.  Growth was average for both sexes.  Fish ranged in length from 14-31 inches and the modal length was 22 inches.  The walleye catch was 2.3/gill net and fish ranged in length from 14-26 inches.  Growth was average for both sexes.  A total of nine fish were captured. Yellow perch (2.0/gill net) ranged in length from 6-7.5 inches; and the modal length was 6.5-6.9 inches. Important species captured in trapnets were bluegill, black crappie, black bullhead and yellow bullheads.  All were abundant and catches were above the third quartile value for lake class 23.  Catches of these four species were similar to the 1986 resurvey.  Bluegill (53.0/trap net) were small and the modal length group was 3.5-3.9 inches.  Black crappie ranged in size from 5.5-10.9 inches and averaged 0.39 pounds. Black bullhead and yellow bullhead were captured at a rate of 2.7 and 8.5/trap net, respectively.  The average weight of black bullhead and yellow bullhead was 0.9 and 0.8 pounds, respectively.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>St. Anna Lake is a lightly developed natural environment lake located five miles east of St. Rosa in northern Stearns County.  A survey conducted in 2015 was designed to monitor changes in the fishery which may have occurred over the past nine years since the last survey was done. Land use in the watershed is predominantly agricultural which has had an effect on the water quality and non point pollution has caused Tullibee to disappear. <br> \n <br> \nThe water clarity in St. Anna Lake averages about 10 feet over the summer. Based on the 2006 aquatic plant survey, northern watermilfoil and coontail were the most common species of submergent vegetation and grew to a depth of 10 feet. The lake has very little fishing structure other than along weedlines and steep drop offs. Public access is available at the state owned access located on the northwest side of the lake.  <br> \n <br> \nThe summer survey on St. Anna Lake had low fish catches and may not have provided an accurate picture of the fish community. Species which may interest anglers include Northern Pike, Bluegill, Black Crappie, and Largemouth Bass. <br> \n <br> \nSt. Anna Lake has the reputation of being a good Bluegill lake. The average length of Bluegill was nearly seven inches and fish over nine inches were sampled. Thirty seven percent of the Bluegills sampled were greater than seven inches in length. Few Black Crappie were sampled but the majority were more than 10 inches. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass are abundant in St Anna Lake and anglers have an opportunity to catch bass over 18 inches. All of the Northern Pike netted were small to medium in size which is typical of most lakes in the area. Walleye fingerlings have been stocked by the local sportsmen's club most recently in 2008; however based on the results of the survey Walleye numbers continue to be low. Both Yellow and Black Bullhead were caught with Yellow Bullheads being the more abundant of the two species. Yellow Bullhead can be an indicator of good water quality as they are less tolerant of turbid water than Black Bullhead. Other fish species that can be found are Bowfin (dogfish), Common Carp, Hybrid Sunfish, Pumpkinseed Sunfish, and Yellow Perch. <br> \n <br> \nRemoving cattle from the immediate shoreline and better agricultural practices within the watershed are encouraged to improve water quality in St. Anna Lake. Selective harvest is also encouraged to minimize the impact on the fish community. Releasing larger Northern Pike and voluntarily limiting harvest of large panfish will help sustain the quality and balance of the fish community in St. Anna Lake.</p>",

The lake has a maximum depth of 107 feet and much of the lake is undeveloped. The Walleye population was lower than statewide average, but above average in size. The Northern Pike population was almost twice the statewide median.  Bluegill were twice the statewide average in numbers and have increased in size since 1973 lake survey.  Black Crappie were numerous, but small.  Although Largemouth Bass were not sampled in test nets, shoreline seining did sample young of the year bass.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of the nearshore fish community in St. Anna Lake was conducted by Fisheries Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program Staff starting July 2, 2018. Ten sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 15-foot or 50-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at all ten sites with three sites sampled from the boat. Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample two sites, a 15-foot seine was used at five sites, and deep water and soft sediments prevented the use of seines at three sampling sites. Nearshore sampling captured 12 native species of fish including one species that is intolerant of disturbance (Iowa Darter) and two species that are tolerant of disturbance (Common Carp and Green Sunfish). <br> \n <br> \nData from this targeted nearshore survey is combined with trap net and gill net data from a June 2015 standard survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based Index of Biological Integrity (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment. The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. The FIBI score for St. Anna Lake from this survey is just below an impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes. For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website. <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Sauk River Watershed assessment of surface waters process completed in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.</p>",
