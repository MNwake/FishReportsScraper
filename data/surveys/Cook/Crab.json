Yellow perch, white sucker, walleye, rock bass, northern pike, bluegill, pumpkinseed sunfish, and smallmouth bass were captured, but only northern pike were somewhat abundant.  Northern pike averaged about 20 inches and 2.3 pounds, and they ranged up to 35 inches and 7 pounds.  The walleye population appears modest, and it appears that except for two older individuals, the walleye caught were one and three years old, which are the year classes that were stocked as fingerlings (1999 and 2001).  Walleye fingerling stocking has replaced the unsuccessful fry stocking of 1985-1992, and if the current trend continues, stocking will show more success in the future.It was noted in the 1997 resurvey of Crab Lake that anglers reported good fishing for smallmouth bass that averaged about one pound, but no smallmouth bass were caught in the 1997 assessment and only one was caught during this assessment.  Smallmouth bass are not easily caught in assessment nets.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Crab Lake lies in the headwaters of the Rainy River watershed, draining to that system via an unnamed stream to Gunflint Lake, then to Saganaga Lake via the Granite River. It is located approximately 38 miles north of Grand Marais and public access is through a channel on the east end of Loon Lake, where a public boat landing is on the northwestern corner of the lake. Crab Lake is currently managed for northern pike and walleye. The 2023 survey was conducted to evaluate the survival and growth of the northern pike and walleye population. <br> \n <br> \nThe walleye catch in the 2023 survey was very low and fell below average for similar lakes in the area. Only two good sized walleye were captured at 16.8 and 21.4 inches. Both walleye appear to be naturally reproduced 4 year olds from the 2019 year class. Crab Lake has not supported a good walleye fishery in a very long time and even with many years of fry stocking have not resulted in any major improvements to the fishery. Walleye have persisted but may no longer be considered a managed species in Crab Lake.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike abundance was good and about average for Crab Lake, and above average for similar lakes in the area. Northern pike ranged from 11.3 to 27.8 inches with a mean length of 21.3 inches. Crab continues to support a relatively high density northern pike population that may provide good action for anglers, especially for fish larger than 25 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nLow numbers of bluegill, pumpkinseed, and rock bass were collected in the survey. None were greater than 7 inches and would not provide any significant angling opportunities. Cisco were collected in low numbers, but likely provide high quality forage for northern pike within the lake. <br> \n <br> \nCook County, Minnesota lakes continue to be susceptible to aquatic invasive species introductions. Invasive species have the potential to significantly alter fish communities and overall lake health. Anglers should clean watercraft and fishing gear, drain all water, and dispose of unused bait in the trash to prevent accidental introductions. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>The 2010 assessment was scheduled to evaluate walleye fingerling stocking done in 2007 and 2005.  The walleye gill net catch fell well short of the long range goal (4.0 fish/set) in the 2008 lake management plan, and was well below the normal range for the lake class.  It was the lowest catch observed to date in this lake, despite regular walleye fingerling stocking since 1999.  One of the walleye collected in 2010 was from a year class supported by stocking, while the other was not.  Fingerling stockings in 2007 and 2005 apparently failed, as had previous stockings. <br> \n <br> \nCrab Lake supported an exceptionally high quality northern pike population in 2010, with a fairly high number of fish and an excellent average size.   Long range goals for the species were met or exceeded by the 2010 catch.  Lengths for eight of the 29 northern pike collected in gill nets were 25 inches or greater, and some fish over 30 inches were taken.  Northern pike growth had been fairly fast; three-year-old fish averaged 19.9 inches at the end of their third year, compared to an area mean of 18.1 inches.  Fish as old as seven years were collected. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill seemed to have been abundant in 2010, but they were small.  All but one of the bluegill collected in gill nets were four years old, from what must have been a strong 2006 year class.  Growth had been very slow; four-year-old fish averaged just 3.6 inches at the end of their fourth year. <br> \n <br> \nSmallmouth bass had not been sampled in gill nets in this lake since 1987; however, two (8.3 and 13.5 inches) were taken in quarter-inch-mesh trap nets in 2010.  Quarter-inch trap nets also collected a few young-of-year smallmouth bass; their advanced size (average length 1.0 inches) so early in the season suggested the 2010 year class might be a fairly strong one. <br> \n <br> \n  </p>",

White sucker, northern cisco, northern pike, rock bass, bluegill, yellow perch, and walleye were caught, but were not abundant. Some large northern pike and walleye were present. Walleye were more abundant in the 1970s, but their numbers have been low since at least 1987. Stocking walleye fry (1985-1988, 1990, and 1992) was unsuccessful, and nearly all walleye caught in this assessment resulted from natural reproduction. According to angler reports, Crab Lake provides good fishing for smallmouth bass, which average 1 lb or more. Smallmouth bass are not readily caught in assessment nets.</p>",
