Age groups I, II, and III are present as well as a few older fish (one of 35\", 16 lb., taken in spring trap netting removal efforts).  Perhaps our netting efforts are reducing numbers of these fish.  Centrarchids (bass/panfish) were all taken in comparatively low numbers.  Black crappies were also present in modest numbers.  Trout and salmon were not sampled since the nets were set in the \"upper\" story of the lake.  Rainbow trout taken in the spring trapnetting northern pike removal effort were 7-10\" in length; October creel information showed rainbows being caught in the 16-17 inch range.</p>",

Netting results indicate there has been no change in the bluegill population from earlier ice out investigations done between 1982 and 1986.  The catch rate of bluegill was low, but within the historical range for the lake.  The quality of the bluegill sample was excellent.  More than 80% of the bluegill sampled in 2012 were larger than 6\", with more than 1/3 of the bluegill sampled being larger than 7.5\".  These values are within the historical range for this lake.</p>",

Rainbow trout are the primary management species for this lake. 5000 are stocked each year, 3000 in the spring and 2000 in the fall. Bluegills were the most abundant species sampled in the lake. While not as abundant as in similar lakes, the quality of the population is good. Nearly 67% of the bluegills sampled exceeded 6 inches, with individuals up to 8.75 inches found. Pumpkinseed, hybrid, and green sunfish are also present. Northern pike were found in average abundance. Pike over 36 inches were captured. Black crappies were found in low numbers when compared to similar lakes. Black bullhead and yellow bullhead are each present in the lake. Individuals of both species exceeded 12 inches in length. Largemouth bass were sampled in average numbers for this type of lake.</p>",

The water quality in Square Lake is among the best in the Twin Cities metro area, a secchi disk reading in 2014 was 18.0 feet, and the lake supports a diverse near shore fish community.  A near shore Index of Biotic Integrity survey (IBI) was conducted on August 10-11, 2016 to assess populations of non-game species, young-of-the-year (YOY) sport fish, and overall lake health using backpack electrofishing and seining. Electrofishing with a backpack unit and seining were conducted at 10 stations around the perimeter of Square Lake.   <br> \n <br> \nEight different species including Iowa Darter, Johnny Darter, Banded Killifish, Blacknose Shiner, Bluegill, Bluntnose Minnow, Central Mudminnow, and Spotfin Shiner were sampled by backpack electrofishing.  Bluntnose Minnow and Spotfin Shiner were the most abundant species sampled by backpack electrofishing.  Thirteen species were sampled by seining including Iowa Darter, Johhny Darter, Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Bluegill, Bluntnose Minnow, Central Mudminnow, Green Sunfish, Largemouth Bass, Pumpkinseed, Spotfin Shiner, and Spottail Shiner.  Bluegill, Bluntnose Minnow, and Spotfin Shiner were the most abundant species sampled by seining.  (Insert info from Jacquelyn here) <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>The water quality in Square Lake is the best in the Twin Cities metro area. The secchi disk reading for 2014 was 18.0 feet. In 1974, due to high water quality and to provide a unique fishery in a major metropolitan area, the management of the lake was changed from warm water gamefish to include Salmonids. Rainbow Trout are now the primary  management species with Bluegills the secondary management species. There were no trout sampled in the 2014 assessment. However, there is a stocking moratorium on Rainbow Trout in effect from 2013 through 2015 while the watershed district investigates any connections between the trout and zooplankton interactions on water clarity. Bluegill abundance was below the median level for trap nets, however, it falls in the historic catch range for this lake. The average size of Bluegills sampled was 6.42 inches. Northern Pike were sampled above the median level for abundance in gill nets. Lengths of pike ranged from 9.96 to 37.76 inches with an average of 17.93 inches and 2.24 pounds. Approximately 27% of NOP sampled were at or above 25 inches in total length. Black Crappie abundance during this assessment was the highest since 1994. Lengths ranged from 3.35 to 10.28 inches in length. Two Largemouth Bass were captured in the gill nets and were 9.96 and 9.84 inches in length. These two bass were aged to be 3 years old and 12 years old respectivley, indicating a potentially wide range of growth in this lake. Yellow Perch were sampled at a rate of 1.25 fish/net set, which is below the first quartile for abundance. Lengths ranged from 6.06 to 10.87 inches in length. Black Bullheads, Brown Bullheads and Yellow Bullheads were sampled at a rate above the third quartile for abundance for gill nets. </p>",

Yellow bullhead, northern pike, pumpkinseed, and hybrid sunfish were sampled at above local median levels.  Rainbow trout were found at near the statewide median for gill net catches.  Although present, no brown trout were sampled.  Bullhead numbers have remained relatively stable since 1979, and yellow bullheads predominate indicating good overall water quality.  Northern pike numbers are somewhat lower than previous years, but are still more than two times the local median despite removal.  Bluegill abundance is down slightly from 1983 but above 1982 and 1979 netting levels.  Average size of bluegills has been stable since 1982 and nearly 42% of the sampled bluegills were 6.0\" or longer in length.</p>",

In 1974, due to high water quality and to provide a unique fishery in a major metropolitan area, the management of the lake was changed from warm water gamefish to include salmonids. Rainbow trout are now the primary management species with bluegills the secondary management species. Rainbow trout were sampled at 1.17/gill net set. This is the first time since the 1994 survey where trout were sampled.  Bluegills were the most abundant species sampled. While not as abundant as other area lakes they were of better quality. Over 60% of the bluegills sampled exceeded 6 inches in length. Pumpkinseed, green, and hybrid sunfish are also present. Northern pike were found in average abundance. Black crappies were found in low abundance when compared to other area lakes. Black bullhead, brown bullhead and yellow bullhead were all sampled in the lake. Yellow bullhead exceeding 15 inches were sampled.  </p>",

Black and yellow bullheads are present respectively less than and greater than the LCMR and 31% of bullheads are greater than 12\" in length.  White suckers are also present but the population is probably affected by the inlet barrier and high predation on smaller size classes from northern pike.</p>",

Brown bullhead, pumpkinseed, and bluegill were significantly below the statewide median.  Black crappie were taken only in gill nets (1 fish) and yellow perch only by shoreline seining.Brown trout are present due to stocking of fish culled from an experimental program at the St. Paul hatchery in 1977 and 1978.  Due to hatchery rearing some annuli were lacking and accurate aging impossible.  The trout stocked have apparently survived well based on the net catch and angler catch reports received.  Northern pike are present in very high numbers being over 4 times the local median catch figure.  The northern pike population, as gauged from scale reading, is made up of primarily young fish.  II annulus northern pike followed by III annulus fish were the most numerous groups.  These two groups exhibited average growth.  Largemouth bass were taken in both trap nets and shoreline seining.  Young of the year and II, III, and IV annulus fish were found.Black crappie were found in average numbers in trap nets in 1974 test netting.  Only one (1) crappie was taken in 1979 and that was in the gill nets.  During the 1974 test netting 22.3 bluegill per trap net lift were taken.  The survey (1979) found but 7.29 bluegill per trap net lift.  The local median is 20.43.  Bluegills aged were from II to VI annuli fish, with III, IV, and V annulus fish being approximately co-equal.  These fish exhibited average growth.  Young of the year were found during shoreline seining.  Pumpkinseed numbers are significantly lower than the local median.  II, IV, and V annulus fish were found to be present.  Hybrid sunfish are present in relatively high numbers with II to V annulus fish present.  III annulus fish were the most common.  Yellow perch were taken only by shoreline seining.  The 1974 test netting also indicated their presence in low numbers.  Yellow bullhead were the only bullhead species indicated to be in high numbers.  Many of these fish were large.</p>",

Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot seine.  Nearshore sampling captured a diverse suite of species, with 17 total species of fish surveyed, including four species that are intolerant of excessive shoreline disturbance and/or poor water quality (Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, and Iowa Darter). <br> \n <br> \nThe near shore fish survey data is combined with gill net and trap net data from an August 2014 survey to describe the fish community and provide a fish-based Index of Biotic Integrity (FIBI) score based on expectations for similar lakes. The FIBI score for Square Lake is near an impairment threshold for aquatic life use developed for similar lakes.   <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to a watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.  Square Lake is located in the St. Croix River (Stillwater) Watershed.   <br> \n</p>",
