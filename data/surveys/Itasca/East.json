Most of shoreline is owned by the US Forest Service and is undeveloped.  Primary fish species include northern pike and panfish.   <br> \n <br> \nThe northern pike catch rate was 10.5/net, which was within the expected range of similar lakes.  Size structure was good for fish up to 24 inches, however few fish exceeded this length.  Growth was similar to the statewide average with fish averaging 24 inches by age five. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill catch rate was 37.3/trap net, which was also within the expected range for similar lakes.  The most common length range sampled were fish between 3 to 4 inches, however fish up to 8 inches were sampled.  Growth was slightly faster than the lake class average with fish growing to around 7 inches by age 6. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie gill net catch rate was 1.5/net and the trap net catch rate was also 1.5/net.  Size structure was good with fish up to 11 inches sampled.  Growth was similar to the statewide average with fish growing to 8 inches by age 5. <br> \n <br> \nFive walleye were sampled in gill nets that varied in length from 22 to 26 inches.  Walleye were not aged in this assessment, but are likely the result of natural reproduction. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled include golden shiner, pumpkinseed sunfish, white sucker and yellow perch. <br> \n <br> \nEast Lake is only 83 acres and because of its small size is especially susceptible to angler overhavest.  Anglers should consider harvesting less than the statewide limits and harvest the smaller to medium sized fish and release larger ones.   <br> \n <br> \n</p>",
