A nearshore survey was conducted to assess the populations of both game and non-game fish species.  Ten 100' long sampling stations were evenly spaced around the lakeshore.  Each station was then sampled by backpack electrofishing, and if conditions allowed with a 15' or 50' 1/8th inch seine. <br> \n <br> \nThe survey took place July 24, 2023, with all 10 stations sampled by backpack electrofishing.  The 50' 1/8th inch seine was used at 4 stations and the 15' 1/8th inch seine was used at an additional 4 stations.  Soft bottom and heavy vegetation prevented the use of seines at the other sampling sites.  Fifteen species were sampled, including 3 species that are intolerant of habitat disturbance:  Banded Killifish, Blacknose Shiner, and Iowa Darter.  This nearshore survey will be used along with the gill net and trap net survey conducted on July 10-12, 2023, to calculate a Fish-Based Index of Biotic Integrity (FIBI) score.  The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health by the types of fish species present and comparing it to what is expected for this type of lake. <br> \n</p>",

The maximum depth is 27' and 52% of the lake is less than 15' deep.  The lake has relatively soft water, moderate fertility, and good clarity with a secchi disk reading of 17' in 2023. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike were sampled in high numbers, when compared to similar lakes, at 13.5/gill net.  Most ran on the small side with an average length of 18.0\".  Some larger Northern Pike are present with 11% measuring at least 26\" in length.  Fish up to 38.9\" were sampled. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass are very abundant and were sampled by a spring electrofishing survey at a rate of 284.2/hr of run time.  Average length was 12.2\", with 58% at least 12\" in length.  Largemouth Bass were also sampled in high number in gill nets at 8.0/net.  Average length was 12.2\".   <br> \n <br> \nBluegills were sampled in average number at 16.6/trap net.  Average length was 7.4\", with 86% measuring at least 7\" in length.  Black Crappies were sampled in average numbers at 3.3/gill net.  Average length was 10.1\". <br> \n <br> \nA unique fish to catch on Adney would be Yellow Bullheads.  They were sampled in high numbers at 133.3/gill net.   Average length was 10.2\", with fish up to 13.7\" sampled. <br> \n <br> \nNo invasive species have been discovered in Adney, but they are in the area.   Lake users are required to inspect and remove any aquatic plants and animals from their watercraft and trailers, as well as pull the plug and drain all water from the watercraft, including bilges, livewells and baitwells. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Adney Lake is a 304 acre lake located 4 miles southeast of Crosslake, in Crow Wing County.  A public access is located on the east side of the lake.  The maximum depth is 27 feet and 52% of the lake is less than 15 feet deep.  The lake has relatively soft water, moderate fertility, and good clarity.  The number of cabins/homes around the lake increased slightly from the previous count in 1998 to a relatively high density of 26 cabins/homes per shoreline mile in 2010.  Shallow water substrates are primarily sand, with some gravel, rubble, and muck also present.  The lake supports a diverse aquatic plant community consisting of 30 species.  Aquatic plants help prevent erosion, stabilize bottom sediments, provide spawning habitat, and provide food and shelter for a variety of aquatic organisms.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike were captured at a rate of 21.2 per gill net in 2010.  This is, the highest catch of the previous four surveys on the lake dating back to 1967 and is high when compared to similar lakes.  Pike growth was good and fish averaged 20.9\".  <br> \n <br> \nSpring electrofishing was used to sample largemouth bass in Adney Lake for the first time in 2010.  The catch of 191 fish per hour was very high for the area.  Several year classes were identified and although growth was slow, fish averaged 11.7\" and measured up to 20\".   <br> \n <br> \nThe catch of black crappie was typical for this type of lake and remained similar to previous surveys.  The bluegill catch was also normal for this type of lake, but was a decrease from pervious catches on Adney.  Size was decent for both species. <br> \n <br> \nAdditional sampling for nearshore fish was also conducted using shoreline seining and backpack electrofishing.  Several species of darters, shiners, and other minnows were collected.  In addition, a single young of the year smallmouth bass was collected.  This was the first record of smallmouth in this lake, and indicates at least a small population capable of reproducing.  A total of 17 species of fish were collected in all sampling methods combined during the 2010 survey.     <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Adney is a 304 acre lake located about four miles southeast of Cross Lake in Crow Wing County.  There is a public access located on the east side of the lake.  Development is relatively high, with about 24 homes/cabins per shoreline mile in 1998.The lake has a maximum depth of 27 feet and about 52% of the surface area is less than fifteen feet deep.  Adney has moderately hard water and phosphorus fertility is in the low category.  Water clarity is at or above average for the area.  Soils in water less than four feet deep are primarily sandy, with fair amounts of boulder, rubble sized (3-10\") rock and gravel also present.The aquatic plant community is fairly diverse and plants grew to a depth of 22 feet in 1998.  Healthy aquatic plant communities are important.  Emergents such as bulrush and cattail help regulate nutrient levels and often provide quality spawning habitat for northern pike, bass and panfish species.  Submergent species provide food sources and cover for a wide variety of aquatic species.Adney lake was test netted in 1998. Catches were similar to past nettings for most species of fish.  Previous nettings were done in 1967, 1980 and 1985.Northern pike is the primary game species present.  The catch rate in '98 was typical for Adney Lake but was categorized as \"high\" when compared to similar type lakes.  Most pike sampled were from the strong 1995 and '96 year classes and their growth bordered on slow.  Older fish had better growth rates.  The largemouth bass catch was also typical for Adney Lake.  The '95 and '96 year classes of bass were also most common in the catch.  The trapnet sample of ten fish represented five different year classes and growth appeared to be good.  Young bass were common in shoreline seine samples.Bluegill was the most abundant panfish sampled.  The catch rate remained in the \"high\" category when compared to similar type lakes but was similar to past catch rates for the lake.  Bluegills caught in trap nets ranged from 3.4-8.3 inches long and about 45% were at least 7.0 inches in length.  Six age classes were sampled and growth was good.  The strongest year classes were 1992 and 1993.  Black crappie numbers were higher than in 1985 but the catch rate remained in the \"average\" category when compared to similar type lakes.  Three age classes were sampled and growth was good.  Most crappies sampled were from the 1994 year class.Yellow perch is an important food source for the lake's gamefish.  The 1998 perch catch bordered on \"low\" and was similar to the 1985 catch rate.  Three age classes were sampled and growth appeared to be good.  Average size was about 9 inches in '98.  Young perch were also sampled and appeared to have good growth.A variety of other species were present in the '98 catch, all in \"average\" numbers when compared to similar type lakes.  These fish included: rock bass, pumpkinseed, hybrid sunfish and yellow bullhead.  White suckers, bowfin (dogfish), black bullhead and golden shiner were present in past nettings but were not sampled in 1998.</p>",
