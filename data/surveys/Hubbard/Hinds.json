                "narrative": "<p>Hinds Lake is located five miles south of Park Rapids in southern Hubbard County.  Hinds Lake has a surface area of 294 acres and a maximum depth of 36 feet.  A county-owned public access with an earthen ramp is located on the northeast shore of the lake.  Hinds Lake has good water quality and excellent fish habitat of submerged and emergent aquatic vegetation.  Hardstem bulrush beds ring much of the lake shoreline.  Hinds Lake provides angling opportunities for northern pike, largemouth bass, and panfish. <br> \n <br> \nThe Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics.  Hinds Lake is in lake class 31.  Other area lakes in this same classification include: Second Crow Wing, Fifth through Eighth Crow Wing Lakes, Duck, and Lower Twin. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike abundance was high, similar to the 1987, 1992, and 1999 surveys.  Abundant northern pike spawning habitat of shallow, submerged aquatic vegetation results in excellent reproduction and recruitment of pike in Hinds Lake.  The northern pike population in Hinds Lake is known more for numbers than size, dominated by small, \"hammer handle\" pike.  Sampled northern pike had an average length and weight of 17.6 inches and 1.3 pounds.  Northern pike up to 33.1 inches were sampled, but overall numbers of larger pike were low.  Northern pike growth rates were slow when compared to other area lakes.  The forage base for northern pike is poor, with low abundance of yellow perch, tullibee (cisco), and low to moderate numbers of white sucker.  The northern pike population in Hinds is limited by high reproduction and recruitment of young pike and slow growth rates. <br> \n <br> \nHinds Lake supports a good largemouth bass population.  Spring electrofishing results sampled moderate numbers of largemouth bass.  The largemouth bass sample was dominated by small sized fish, as the number of bass sampled over 15.0 inches was low when compared to other area lakes.  Anglers have reported catching some big bass on Hinds Lake. <br> \n <br> \nHinds Lake has an abundant panfish population of bluegill, pumpkinseed, and hybrid sunfish, and moderate numbers of black crappie.  Bluegill abundance was within the range \"typical\" for this lake class.  Bluegill abundance in past surveys has fluctuated from moderate to high numbers.  Anglers will find good numbers of bluegill, pumpkinseed, and hybrid sunfish in the 6-8 inch size range.  Black crappie were sampled in low numbers, with catch rates below the range \"typical\" for this lake class.  Black crappie abundance in past surveys has fluctuated from low to moderate numbers. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled in moderate numbers included bowfin (dogfish) and yellow bullhead, and low numbers of brown bullhead, black bullhead, and rock bass.</p>",

A county owned public access is located on the northeast shore of the lake off Blue Spruce Road. Hinds provides angling opportunities for Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass and panfish. <br> \nThe Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics. Hinds is in class 31. Class 31 lakes generally have very hard water and are regularly shaped. Other class 31 lakes in the work area include: Duck, Eighth Crow Wing, Evergreen, Fifth Crow Wing, Hattie, Lower Twin, Second Crow Wing, Seventh Crow Wing, Shingobee, Sixth Crow Wing, and Tripp. <br> \nNorthern Pike abundance was high, in line with the past two surveys. Anglers will find northerns spread out from 14 - 32 inches in length. Northern Pike sampled had an average length of 21.7 inches and weighed 1.9 pounds. <br> \nLargemouth Bass were sampled in good numbers again in 2022.  They had an average length of 13 inches, with the longest sampled at 18.3 inches.  Smallmouth Bass were first sampled by the DNR in 2017, and two were again sampled in 2022 both around 17 inches in length. <br> \nHinds supports a Black Crappie population and angling for them is popular year-round.  Only a few crappies were sampled in this survey, with the largest at 10.4 inches. Hinds also provides good fishing for Bluegill and Pumpkinseed; with most fish under 8 inches. <br> \nCurrently, no Aquatic Invasive Species (AIS) have been identified in Hinds Lake. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access.</p>",

It has a maximum depth of 36 feet.The lake's immediate watershed is composed of 55 percent pine and aspen woodland and 45 percent pasture land.Hinds Lake is a hard-water lake with a total alkalinity reading of 147.5 ppm.Fish spawning conditions are rated as good for northern pike, largemouth bass and panfish, and poor for walleye.Test netting indicates that the lake contains good populations of northern pike, perch, bullheads, sunfish, and rock bass; and lower populations of tullibee, dogfish, sucker, walleye, and largemouth bass.Fishing success in recent years, as rated by local residents, has been good for sunfish and largemouth bass; fair for northern pike and crappies; and poor for walleye.Notes by Watershed Biologist:No further walleye stocking is recommended since physical characteristics of the lake do not appear suitable, and previous stocking has failed to establish them, or provide a fishery.The lake does, however, appear well suited for panfish, largemouth bass, and northern pike, and since adequate spawning facilities are available for them, no special fish management appears to be needed to sustain this fishery.</p>",

There seems to be a large population of largemouth bass, but most of these are small.  The large bluegill population in the lake has become a problem in recent years because the majority are stunted.  There also seems to be a large population of dogfish, yellow and black bullheads.Management Recommendations:Continue to manage as a largemouth bass, northern pike lake.  Additional northern pike may be stocked, due to the large population of bluegill.  Walleye have been stocked many times in the past with no results, therefore this management should be discontinued.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Number of walleye sampled (0.50 fish/gillnet) was slightly below the first quartile, whereas 2.15 lbs/set was within the normal range for Lake Class 29.  1975 was the only year wallleye abundance was within the normal range, at 1.00 fish/gillnet.  The two walleye sampled in 1992 were both in the 22.0 to 22.9 inch length range and averaged 4.3 pounds.  Walleye have not been stocked into Hinds Lake since 1972.Northern pike gillnet catch rates have gradually increased since 1963 to rise above the third quartile in 1992 (12.75 fish/set and 22.28 lbs/set).  However, mean weight of individual northern pike has remained unchanged since 1975.  In 1992, mean weight was 1.8 pounds.  The size structure (PSD=31) is also indicative of a small-sized northern pike population.  No northern pike sampled were > 28 inches, even though 56% of the aged fish were age 6 or older.  Northern pike exhibit slow growth rates, averaging 19.56 inches at age 5.  Lack of suitable prey for the high density northern pike population leads to the slow growth and small sizes.  The 1986 and 1987 year classes are large and account for 67% of the aged northern pike.Trapnet catches of pumpkinseed, bluegill, largemouth bass, black crappie and yellow perch were all within the normal ranges for lakes in Class 29.  Largemouth bass catches have generally been within the normal ranges since 1963.  The size structure of the few largemouth bass sampled (PSD=50, RSD-P=13) suggests a population with the potential to produce large fish.  Largemouth bass growth rates are slow the first two years, but improve as fish age.  Mean length at age 4 is 10.15 inches.  Black crappie also have a good proportion of quality-length fish; however, none sampled were >8 inches (preferred length).  Unlike largemouth bass, black crappie growth rates decline after age 1, resulting in a mean length of 6.52 inches at age 4.  Black crappie abundance has fluctuated little since 1963.  Pumpkinseed numbers have been gradually increasing since 1975 while remaining within the normal range.  Bluegill density had also been increasing until a steep decrease was observed in 1992.  Both of these species have identical small size structures (PSD=11) and slow growth rates.  Bluegill average only 3.40 inches at age 4.  Although trapnet catches of yellow perch were within the normal ranges in 1992, none were sampled in gillnets.  This is a large decrease from 1963, when 18.83 yellow perch were sampled per gillnet.White sucker were the only non-game species to have net catches above the third quartile.  Bowfin, black, yellow and brown bullhead, rock bass and green sunfish catch rates were all within the normal ranges for Lake Class 29.</p>",

A survey targeting near shore fish species was conducted by Park Rapids Fisheries Staff on July 7, 2017 to assess populations of non-game and small sport fish. Ten 100-foot sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake shore, sampling a variety of habitat types. Each site was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot 1/8th-inch mesh seine, depending on habitat conditions.   <br> \n <br> \nDuring this assessment, one site was sampled with a 50-foot seine and one site was sampled with a 15-foot seine. Site conditions prevented the use of seines at eight sites.  Backpack electrofishing was done at all ten sites, several of which were conducted from the side of the boat.  Nearshore sampling captured several species of fish including four species intolerant of disturbance; Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, and Least Darter.  Other species sampled during the nearshore effort included Bluegill, Bluntnose Minnow, Central Mudminnow, Green Sunfish, Hybrid Sunfish, Iowa Darter, Largemouth Bass, Pumpkinseed, White Sucker, Yellow Bullhead, and Yellow Perch.  Nearshore catches will be used along with gillnet and trapnet catch data from a standard survey on June 12, 2017, to calculate a fish-based Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) score which is indicative of the health of Hinds Lake.   <br> \n <br> \nThis survey is contributing to a watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.  Hinds Lake is located in the Crow Wing River Watershed. <br> \n</p>",

Spawning area good with normal water conditions.  Bluegills are about two times abundance for area; growth rate is slow.  Sucker, perch, bullhead, black crappie, pumpkinseed, rock bass, largemouth bass are present, but low in numbers.Management Recommendations:Continue to manage as a largemouth bass - panfish lake.  Stocking of northern pike from rescue operations should be carried out during years of poor natural reproduction at the rate of 1.0 pounds per littoral acre.  No other management required at this time.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Hinds Lake is located  five miles south of Park Rapids in southern Hubbard County.  Hinds Lake has a surface area of 294 acres and a maximum depth of 36 feet.  A county-owned public access with an earthen ramp is located on the northeast shore of the lake.  Hinds Lake has good water quality and excellent fish habitat of submerged and emergent aquatic vegetation.  Hardstem bulrush beds ring much of the lake shoreline.  Hinds Lake supports good populations of northern pike, largemouth bass, and panfish.The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical and chemical characteristics.  Hinds Lake is in class 31.  Other area lakes in this same classification include: Second Crow Wing, Fifth thru Eighth Crow Wing Lakes, Duck, and Lower Twin.Northern pike abundance was high (14.3 northern pike/gillnet), similar to the surveys in 1987 and 1992.  The northern pike sample was dominated by small fish with an average length and weight of 19.0 inches and 1.6 pounds.  Northern pike up to 30.5 inches were sampled, but overall numbers of larger pike were low.  Northern pike growth rates were slow when compared to other area lakes.  The forage base for northern pike is poor, with low abundance of yellow perch and tullibee (cisco), and low to moderate numbers of white sucker. Largemouth bass were sampled in good numbers in Hinds Lake.  Spring electrofishing was conducted for the first time and catch rates for largemouth bass were high (47 bass/hour).  Average size of largemouth bass was small (8.9 inches and 0.54 lbs), however, fish up to 18.2 inches were sampled.  Past surveys have shown that Hinds Lake has always supported good numbers of largemouth bass.Hinds Lake has an abundant panfish population of bluegill, pumpkinseed, and hybrid sunfish, and moderate numbers of black crappie.  Bluegill numbers were high (66.4 bluegill/trapnet), similar to past surveys.  Size of bluegill was fair, with 36% of the trapnet sample 7.0 inches or larger.  Pumpkinseed numbers were also high (14.5 pumpkinseed/trapnet), with an average length of 5.8 inches.  Hybrid sunfish are also common in Hinds Lake.  Sunfish species such as bluegill, pumpkinseed, and green sunfish often cross when spawning to form a hybrid sunfish.  Black crappie were sampled in moderate numbers with electrofishing gear (37 black crappie/hour).  Black crappie had an average length and weight of 9.3 inches and 0.46 pounds.  Other species sampled include yellow bullhead, rock bass, and bowfin (dogfish) in moderate numbers.  Brown and black bullhead were sampled in low numbers.</p>",

A county-owned public access with an earthen ramp is located on the northeast shore of the lake.  Hinds Lake has good water quality and excellent fish habitat of submerged and emergent aquatic vegetation.  Hardstem bulrush beds ring much of the lake shoreline.  Hinds Lake provides angling opportunities for northern pike, largemouth bass, and panfish. <br> \n <br> \nThe Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics.  Hinds Lake is in lake class 31, and these lakes generally have hard water with round, regular shaped shorelines. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike abundance was very high, above the normal range for similar type lakes.  Northern pike abundance has been very high since the late 1980's.  Abundant northern pike spawning habitat of shallow, submerged aquatic vegetation results in excellent reproduction and recruitment of pike in Hinds Lake.  The northern pike population in Hinds is known more for numbers than size, dominated by small, \"hammer handle\" pike.  Sampled northern pike were an average length and weight of 19 inches and 1.5 pounds.  Northern pike up to 39 inches were sampled, but overall numbers of larger pike were low.  Northern pike growth rates were slow when compared to other area lakes.  The forage base for northern pike is poor, with low abundance of yellow perch, tullibee (cisco), and low to moderate numbers of white sucker.   <br> \n <br> \nPanfish are a popular choice for anglers on Hinds Lake.  Bluegill abundance was within the normal range for similar type lakes.  Bluegill abundance in past surveys has fluctuated from moderate to high numbers.  Anglers will find good numbers of bluegill and pumpkinseed in the 6-8 inch size range.  Black crappie were sampled in low numbers, with catch rates below the normal range for similar type lakes.  Black crappie abundance in past surveys has fluctuated from low to moderate numbers. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass were sampled in moderate numbers when compared to other area lakes.  The proportion of larger bass sampled over 15 inches was high compared to other area lakes.  Anglers have reported catching bass up to 20 inches in Hinds Lake. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers and other recreational boaters should be aware that curly leaf pondweed, an aquatic invasive species (AIS), is present in Hinds Lake.  Boaters should take extra care and precaution to remove all aquatic vegetation from boats and trailers when leaving the lake. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Hinds Lake is located five miles south of Park Rapids, in southern Hubbard County. Hinds has a surface area of 305 acres and a maximum depth of 36 feet.  A county-owned public access with an earthen ramp is located on the northeast shore of the lake.  Hinds provides angling opportunities for Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass and panfish. <br> \nThe Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics. Hinds is in lake class 31. Class 31 lakes generally are regularly shaped with very hard water. Other class 31 lakes in the Park Rapids area include: Boulder; Evergreen; Hattie; Lower Twin; Tripp; Second, Fifth, Sixth, Seventh and Eighth Crow Wing. <br> \nNorthern Pike were sampled in very high numbers in 2017.  The average size of 20 inches and 1.9 pounds were larger than recent surveys.  Pike ranged from 13 to 31 inches in length, with most fish 16 to 21 inches.   <br> \nLargemouth Bass were sampled in good numbers, along with the first Smallmouth Bass ever sampled by the DNR in Hinds Lake.  Largemouth Bass ranged from 6 to 19.5 inches, with an average length of 12 inches.  Only one Smallmouth Bass was found, and it was almost 18 inches long.   <br> \nAngling opportunities for panfish include Bluegill, Pumpkinseed, hybrid sunfish and Black Crappies.  Sunfish were sampled in good numbers, but had an average size between 5 and 6 inches.  Bluegills were found up to 8 inches, Pumpkinseeds were up to 7 inches and hybrid sunfish up to 9.5 inches.  Black Crappie abundance was in line with past surveys, and were sampled from 4.5 to 11 inches in length. <br> \nCurrently no aquatic invasive species (AIS) have been identified in Hinds. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access.</p>",
