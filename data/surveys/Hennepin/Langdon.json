Of 79 fish measured, only 17 were longer than 6 inches, and none were sampled above 8 inches. Hybrid sunfish and pumpkinseed sunfish were captured in average numbers. The most common sizes sampled were between 4 and 6 inches in length. Both brown and yellow bullheads were sampled in average numbers for this lake class. Their average sizes were 9 and 10 inches respectively in both gear types. Only one creek chub and one black crappie were captured during the survey. The black crappie was 9.2 inches long and age three.</p>",
