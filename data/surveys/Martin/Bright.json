                "narrative": "<p>Bright Lake is a 645-acre lake located in Martin County.  Bright Lake is managed primarily for northern pike and secondarily for yellow perch.  Dissolved oxygen in lakes of the prairie pothole region can naturally drop to low enough levels (< 0.5 parts per million for a period of time) to kill fish during the winter.  Northern pike and yellow perch tend to be more tolerant of low dissolved oxygen levels because they have a life history which evolved to adapt and survive with these conditions.Trap net sets were used to assess the fisheries in Bright Lake in the spring of 1999.  The catch rates for northern pike was higher in 1994 compared to previous surveys in Bright Lake.  The average northern pike trap net catch rate was 0.30 fish/net set in 1999, 4.50 fish/net set in 1994, and 0.80 fish/net set in 1989.  Southwestern Minnesota was inundated with water during 1993 which meant that spawning conditions were probably favorable for northern pike during this period.  The high catch rate in 1994 was likely the result of habitat conditions during 1993.  Total lengths of northern pike sampled in trap nets in 1999 ranged between 22.7 and 26.9 inches, with an average of 24.3.  No northern pike have ever been stocked by the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources which means the population is self-sustaining.  Although the fish are not as numerous as in 1994, the fishery should provide some excitement to the dedicated pike angler.No yellow perch were sampled in 1999.  The average yellow perch trap net catch rate was 0 fish/net set in 1999, 1.60 fish/net set in 1994, and 0.80 fish/net set in 1989.  Yellow perch have not been stocked since 1979.  In most of the pothole prairie lakes, yellow perch and both black and white crappie populations tend to cycle from high catch rates to low catch rates in a matter of a few years.  Previous surveys indicate this phenomenon has not been occurring in Bright Lake.  The reason these populations tend to cycle is likely due to their spawning habitat tolerance, foraging capabilities, short life cycle, and few predators.The white crappie trap net catch rate was almost nine times higher than the upper normal range for this type of lake (5.96 fish/net set).  The white crappie catch rate was 41.20 in 1999, 4.60 in 1994, and 0.80 in 1989.  Total lengths of white crappie sampled in trap nets in 1999 ranged between 5.6 and 11.8 inches, with an average of 8.6.  These data suggest the density of white crappie was higher than other area lakes and the population size structure consisted of larger sized individuals.  Enjoy the \"boom\" in the white crappie fishery. The black bullhead trap net catch rate was 223.50 fish/net set which was almost twice the upper normal range (132.61 fish/net set) for this type of lake.  Total lengths of black bullheads ranged between 6.3 and 9.3 inches, with an average of 8.1.  This would indicate the density of black bullhead was high relative to other area lakes and the population size structure consisted mostly of smaller sized individuals.  Additionally, the average common carp trap net catch was 6.10 fish/net set which was higher than the upper normal range (5.51 fish/net set) for this type of lake.   To promote and maintain healthy fish populations, pollution and other inputs need to be controlled.  Fish habitats are directly affected by water quality.  Nutrient, sediment and other waste inputs can drastically alter the biological, chemical, and physical components of a lake.  It is paramount to maintain if not improve the current water quality of Bright Lake through watershed management to preserve this fishery for future generations to enjoy.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>INTRODUCTION <br> \n <br> \nBright Lake is a 645-acre lake located 2.5 miles northeast of the Town of Ceylon in Martin County.  The basin is relatively shallow, with a maximum depth of 6.0 feet observed during the survey, and a shoreline length of 4.4 miles.  A thick band of cattails is present around the perimeter of the lake, with some bulrush present.  The ample emergent vegetation provides spawning and nursery habitat for several species of fish.  Because of its shallowness and susceptibility to winterkill, Bright Lake is managed primarily for Northern Pike and secondarily for Yellow Perch, both of which can tolerate relatively low dissolved oxygen levels.  Fish populations maintain themselves naturally, as stocking hasn't occurred on Bright Lake since 2003.  Bright Lake's connection to other lakes and wetlands (Okamanpeedan, Pierce, Clayton, and Little Tuttle) allows movement of fish among the waterbodies, likely aiding in maintaining fish populations.  Because of this connectivity to the East Fork of the Des Moines Watershed, rough fish populations such as common carp, bigmouth buffalo, and black bullhead have persisted in this system of lakes.  Bright Lake was surveyed the week of June 8, 2015 to monitor fish populations using 11 trap nets.  <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nNORTHERN PIKE <br> \n <br> \nThe system of lakes, wetlands, and streams around Ceylon, MN, of which Bright Lake is included, has historically been a favorable system for northern pike production.  Excellent Northern Pike spawning habitat exists throughout the system.  The 2015 Northern Pike catch rate of 3.6 per trap net reflected these favorable conditions, as this was the second highest Northern Pike catch rate observed on Bright Lake and was higher than expected catch rates for similar lakes.  Catch rates have varied from 0.3 per trap net in 1999 to 4.5 per trap net in 1994, and have averaged 2.2 per trap net since 1989.  Lengths of Northern Pike ranged from 10.8 to 33.0 inches and averaged 18.1 inches.  Nearly every inch category between 10 and 33 was represented in the sample, indicating that natural reproduction is consistent in Bright Lake or the system of waterbodies connected to Bright Lake.  Northern Pike were healthy but not plump.  It appears that there is plenty of forage in Bright Lake including Bigmouth Buffalo, Common Carp, White Crappie, and Yellow Perch; however, the poor water quality may prevent Northern Pike from successfully foraging on the abundant prey fish.  Bright Lake should provide a good Northern Pike angling opportunity.  <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nYELLOW PERCH <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch have historically occurred in relatively low abundance in Bright Lake as catch rates have ranged from 0.0 per trap net in 1999 and 2003 to 1.6 per trap net in 1994.  In 2015, the Yellow Perch catch rate was 0.9 per trap net, which is slightly above the long term average of 0.7 per trap net and within the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes.  Size of Yellow Perch was small, with lengths ranging from 5.6 to 8.8 inches and averaging 6.9 inches.  Yellow Perch were plump indicating that forage is readily available.  Trap nets typically do not sample Yellow Perch well this time of year, so Yellow Perch may be more abundant that what the sample suggests.  Gill nets are typically used to sample Yellow Perch, but were not used because of the shallowness of Bright Lake.   <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nWHITE CRAPPIE <br> \n <br> \nWhite Crappie were captured at a rate of 61.7 per trap net in 2015, which is the highest recorded catch rate in Bright Lake.  Prior to 2015, catch rates varied from 0.8 per trap net in 1989 to 47.8 per trap net in 2007.  The 2015 catch rate of 61.7 per trap net greatly exceeds the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes.  Many of the White Crappies in Bright Lake are small; however, some fish over 10.0 inches are present (12 percent of the sample).  White Crappie ranged in length from 6.0 to 12.2 inches and averaged 8.0 inches.  White Crappie were plump, suggesting that the population is not stunted and that there is plenty of forage available.  The small size structure is likely a result of the population being comprised of young individuals and harvest of larger White Crappie. Size of Bright Lake's White Crappie should increase after a couple of year's growth.  Bright Lake currently provides a unique angling opportunity for White Crappie.  <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nBLACK BULLHEAD <br> \n <br> \nHistoric catch rates of Black Bullhead have been highly variable, ranging from 2.2 per trap net in 1989 to 283.5 per trap net in 2003.  In the two surveys since 2003, Black Bullhead abundance has been below the long term average of 122.0 per trap net, being captured at rates of 31.3 per trap net in 2007 and 77.0 per trap net in 2015.  Black Bullhead sampled in 2015 ranged in length from 5.3 to 15.2 inches and averaged 8.9 inches. <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nCHANNEL CATFISH <br> \n <br> \nChannel Catfish were captured at a rate of 1.2 per trap net which exceeds the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes, and is the highest recorded catch rate for Channel Catfish on Bright Lake.  Prior to 2015, catch rates varied from 0.0 per trap net in 1989 to 1.0 per trap net in 1994 and averaged 0.6 per trap net.  Lengths of Channel Catfish ranged from 10.5 to 21.8 inches and averaged 12.8 inches.  If Channel Catfish continue to increase in abundance, it is likely that they may help control the Black Bullhead population and provide an additional angling opportunity.  <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nOTHER SPECIES <br> \n <br> \nThe Bigmouth Buffalo catch rate was 3.6 per trap net. Lengths ranged from 9.8 to 29.6 inches and averaged 19.8 inches.  Three Black Crappie were sampled and have historically occurred in low numbers (less than 4.5 per trap net) in Bright Lake.  Common Carp abundance in 2015 (3.5 per trap net) remained consistent with 2013's catch rate of 3.7 per trap net.  Common Carp ranged in length from 5.9 to 30.8 inches and averaged 15.1 inches.  Five Quillback were sampled, marking the first time that they have been sampled in Bright Lake.  Other species sampled included Orangespotted Sunfish (N=1), White Sucker (N=8), and Yellow Bullhead (N=9).  <br> \n <br> \nPlants in the water and at the water's edge provide habitat, prevent erosion, and absorb excess nutrients.  Shrubs, trees, and woody debris such as fallen trees or limbs provide good habitat both above and below the water and should be left in place.  By leaving a buffer strip of natural vegetation along the shoreline, property owners can reduce erosion, help maintain or improve water quality, and provide habitat and travel corridors for wildlife. <br> \n <br> \nBest management practices within the watershed (no-till farming, cover crops, buffer strips, targeted fertilizer application, reduced or metered tiling) would help reduce nutrients entering the lake.  High nutrient and sediment input can cause algae blooms and reduce overall water quality.  Any improvements in the watershed are likely to have positive impacts on the fishery. <br> \nPrepared by Jonah Dagel <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Bright Lake is managed primarily for northern pike.  Bright Lake and the connecting lakes, sloughs, andstreams provide excellent spawning habitat for northern pike.  Northern pike are more tolerant to low oxygenlevels than many other species.  Because Bright Lake is not aerated and is sometimes subject to low oxygen duringthe winter, it is a good lake for northern pike management.     The northern pike population as of the summer of 1994 was doing very well.  Good numbers and various sizegroups were sampled during our survey.  Northern pike lengths ranged from 12 to 39 inches.  However, most of thefish were 1 year old (18 inches) because of the high water (good spawning conditions) present in 1993.     The yellow perch population was pretty low during the 1994 sample.  Yellow perch ranged in length from 5.7to 10.2 inches.  The higher water levels should help the yellow perch reproduction because more vegetation(cattails and over-hanging trees) should be available for them to spawn on.  However, there are a lot of variablesthat can effect the success of natural reproduction other than spawning habitat.  For instances, spring watertemperature fluctuations, wind, and the predator densities.     The density of black and white crappie may not be real high, but what they lack in abundance, they make upfor in their size.  We sampled black and white crappie that were longer than 14 inches and most of the fish wereat least 10 inches.  Bright Lake may be a real sleeper for a trophy crappie.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Bright is a 645-acre lake located near Ceylon in Martin County.  The lake has a maximum depth of 7.0 feet, a shoreline length of 4.4 miles and is a class 43 lake.  Bright is managed primarily for northern pike while yellow perch and walleye are managed secondarily.  Because of shallowness, gill nets were not used during the assessment.\n\nBright Lake and its connecting marshes, lakes (Clayton, Pierce, Bright and Okamanpeedan) and streams have been a factory for northern pike production for many years.  Excellent pike spawning habitat exists throughout this area, even though low winter dissolved oxygen sometimes takes its toll.\n\nThe northern pike population is similar to lakes with physical and chemical characteristics like Bright.  Net catches were down some from an all time high seen in 2003.  Because of the ability for fish to move from lake to lake, catch rates may vary from survey to survey.  Lengths of northern pike sampled in trap nets ranged from 19.2 to 29.2 inches with an average length of 23.9 inches.\n\nBased on our assessment in 2007, white crappie numbers are very high in Bright Lake.  Lengths of white crappie sampled in our trap nets ranged from 7.6 to 12.3 inches and averaged 9.9 inches.  Black crappie catch rate of 3.27 per set was similar to other years we have surveyed Bright Lake.  Lengths of black crappie sampled in trap nets ranged from 6.6 to 12.4 inches and averaged 9.7 inches.\n\nThe yellow perch population appears to be on the rise in Bright Lake.  No yellow perch were sampled in trap nets in 2003 and 1999.  An average number of yellow perch were caught in our nets in 2007.  Lengths of yellow perch caught in trap nets ranged from 6.7 to 9.8 inches and averaged 8.6 inches.\n\nTrap net catch rates for black bullhead were down from 283.4 per set in 2003 and 223.5 per set in 1999 to 31.3 per set in 2007.  Lengths of black bullhead sampled in trap nets in 2007 ranged from 5.8 to 11.6 inches and averaged 8.7 inches.\n\nOther fish sampled in trap nets included bigmouth buffalo, black crappie, channel catfish, common carp, green sunfish, white sucker, and yellow bullhead.\n\nTo maintain a healthy fishery in Bright Lake, we need to promote Best Management Practices (BMP\u0019s) within the watershed to help reduce nutrients entering the lake.  High nutrients and sediments in a lake can cause algae blooms and reduce water clarity.\n\n\n</p>",

TWO OF THE FISH WERE AGE 2, AVERAGED 18.85 INCHES AND WEIGHED AN AVERAGE OF 1.6 LBS. ONE FISH WAS AGE 5, MEASURED 28.3 INCHES AND WEIGHED 4.2 LBS. THE FOURTH FISH COULD NET BE AGED. THE GILLNET CATCH INDEX FOR YELLOW PERCH WAS 1.00 FISH PER SET WHICH IS 12.5% OF THE STATE MEDIAN AND 5% OF THE LOCAL MEDIAN. BOTH OF THE FISH SAMPLED WERE AGE 3 AND 6.0 INCHES LONG. SHORELINE SEINING ON AUGUST 29, 1989 PRODUCED 24 YOY YELLOW PERCH PER ACRE SEINED. BECAUSE THE LAKE WAS SO SHALLOW, TRAP NETS DID NOT CATCH WELL. NON INDICATOR GEAR CAUGHT SIGNIFICANT- LY MORE FISH, AND THEREFORE GIVE BETTER LENGTH DISTRIBUTIONS. THE WHITE CRAPPIE GILLNET CATCH INDEX IS 2.1 TIMES THE STATE MEDIAN AND 1.5 TIMES THE LOCAL MEDIAN. SCALES WERE TAKEN FROM FIVE FISH WITH THREE FISH BEING AGE 1 AND TWO FISH BEING AGE 3.

                "narrative": "<p>Bright Lake, in Martin County, is a 645-acre lake that has a maximum depth of 7.0 feet.  Most of this lake averages about 4 feet deep, which is typical of many of the pothole prairie lakes.  Bright Lake is one in a large chain of lakes where the fish community is substantially influenced by low dissolved oxygen in winter and water levels that are dictated by naturally occurring wet-dry cycles.  Due to the flat terrain of the Bright-Clayton-Pierce-Okamanpeedan chain of lakes and the connectivity of these systems, northern pike natural reproduction can be successful in high water years.  Bright Lake is managed primarily for northern pike and secondarily for yellow perch.  A resurvey was conducted the week of May 27, 2003 using 1 gill net and 11 trap nets.Northern pike numbers are average for this type of lake.  Most of the fish averaged 16.5 inches, so even though catch rates are near what we would expect, the sizes of fish are probably not what the average northern pike angler would prefer.  Most of the fish were in below average condition, suggesting that forage is not abundant.  This is further verified by the absence of yellow perch in the nets.   Northern pike fry and adults were both stocked in 2001.  Most of the northern pike sampled were from the 2001 year class which could be attributed to the fry stocking, but conditions in 2001 were also nearly ideal for natural reproduction.  So the take home message is that northern pike are present in average numbers, but the sizes of fish are smaller than anglers probably desire.  If you are targeting northern pike, Lake Ocheda or West Graham Lake might be  better options.Fish populations often fluctuate widely in pothole prairie lakes which is why we sometimes call one of the management schemes  \"boom and bust\".  Often panfish populations have a successful year class which creates catch rates in netting and angling that approach an all-time high and thus are called a \"boom\" cycle.  As time goes on, that particular year class of fish declines in numbers which can be described as the \"bust\" cycle.  Unfortunately, it appears as if yellow perch are in a \"bust\" cycle.  No yellow perch were captured in either gill nets or trap nets in 2003.  Adult yellow perch were stocked as adults in 2001 and fingerlings in fall 2003.  Perhaps conditions and habitat will facilitate a good spawn for the spring of 2004 and create a good year class of fish.Both black and white crappie numbers were within the expected range.  The catch rates indicate there are virtually equal numbers of both species in Bright Lake. Comparing the netting data from 1999 to 2003, it appears as if the white crappie are at or approaching the \"bust\" period of the cycle.  Data from 1999 documented a much more abundant white crappie population compared to netting data in 2003.  Both black and white crappie averaged 9 to 9.5 inches.   Although the numbers are not excessively high, the sizes of crappie would create excitement for most anglers.  Despite the history of low dissolved oxygen in winter, DNR netting sampled walleye and channel catfish.  Both of these species are not tolerant of low dissolved oxygen.  This may indicate refuge areas exist in Bright Lake that maintain higher dissolved oxygen, or that fish have moved into  Bright Lake.A total of twelve species of fish were sampled.  Other species caught were common carp, golden shiners, quillback, white sucker, and yellow bullhead.To promote and maintain healthy fish populations, pollution and other inputs need to be controlled.  Fish habitats are directly affected by water quality.  Nutrient, sediment and other waste inputs can drastically alter the biological, chemical, and physical components of a lake.  It is important to maintain if not improve the current water quality of Bright Lake through watershed management to preserve this fishery for future generations to enjoy.Prepared by Ryan Doorenbos  </p>",
