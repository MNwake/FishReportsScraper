TWO GILLNETS AND FOUR TRAPNETS WERE SET IN AN EFFORT TO OBTAIN DATA PERTAINING TO THE PRESENT FISH POPULATION. SHORE- LINE SEINING WAS PERFORMED IN LATE AUGUST TO EVALUATE NATURAL REPRODUCTION OF THE FISH SPECIES PRESENT. WITH RESPECT TO LOCAL MEDIANS FROM TEST NET INDICES THE PRESENT FISH POPULATION IS AS FOLLOWS: THE NORTHERN PIKE NET CATCH SHOWED A REAL DECREASE FROM THE PREVIOUS SURVEY IN 1960, AND IS ALSO WELL BELOW THE LOCAL MEDIAN OF 3.50/SET. ONLY TWO NORTHERN PIKE WERE TAKIN IN ALL NETTING AND WERE 12.0 AND 23.0 INCHES IN LENGTH. THESE FISH REPRE- SENTED AGE GROUPS II AND VI, RESPECTIVELY. THE AGE II FISH EXHIBITED A SLOW GROWTH RATE WHEN COMPARED TO NORMAL STATEWIDE AVERAGES WHILE THE AGE VI FISH SHOWED NORMAL GROWTH. THE BLUGGILL SUNFISH NET CATCH WAS UP FROM THE PREVIOUS SURVEY AND ABOVE THE LOCAL MEDIAN CATCH OF 20.00/SET. THE LENGTH FREQUENCY DISTRIBUTION RANGED FROM 4.0 TO 7.9 INHCES WITH A MEDIAN LENGTH GROUP OF 6.5-6.9 INCHES. AGE GROUPS II-V WERE PRESENT IN THE NET CATCHES AND THEY EXHIBIT NORMAL GROWTH RATES. THE BLACK CRAPPIE NET CATCH WAS DOWN FROM THE PREVIOUS SURVEY, HOWEVER, THE CATCH IS STILL ABOVE THE LOCAL MEDIAN CATCH. THE LENGTH FREQUENCY DISTRIBUTION RANGED FROM 5.5 TO 8.9 INCHES WITH 6.5-6.9 INCHES BEING THE MEDIAN LENGTH GROUP. AGE GROUPS III AND IV WERE REPRESENTED AND DIS- PLAYED NORMAL GROWTH RATES. THE PUMPKINSEED SUNFISH NET CATCH WAS UP FROM THE PREVIOUS SURVEY AND ABOVE THE LOCAL MEDIAN. THE LENGTH FREQUENCY DISTRIBUTION RANGED FROM 3.5 TO 6.9 INCHES WITH A MEDIAN LENGTH GROUP OF 5.5-5.9 INCHES. AGE GROUPS III-VI WERE REPRESENTED IN THE NET CATCHES. THE HYBRID SUNFISH NET CATCH WAS DOWN FROM THE PREVIOUS SURVEY AND BELOW THE LOCAL MEDIAN OF 1.00/SET. ONLY TWO FISH WERE CAUGHT IN THE TRAP- NETTING AND BOTH FELL IN THE 6.5-6.9 INCH SIZE RANGE. FIVE ADDITIONAL SPECIES WERE TAKEN DURING THE TEST NETTING (BOWFIN, WHITE SUCKER, GOLDEN SHINER, BLACK BULLHEAD, AND BROWN BULLHEAD). THE BLACK BULLHEAD SHOWED BOTH TRAPNET AND GILLNET CATCHES ABOVE THE LOCAL MEDIANS OF 2.33/SET AND 6.50/SET, RESPECTIVELY. BLACK BULLHEADS RANGED IN LENGTH FROM 7.0 TO 11.4 INCHES IN THE TRAPNETS AND HAD A MEAN WEIGHT OF 0.39 POUNDS. THE FOUR OTHER SPECIES LISTED EXHIBITED NET CATCHES BELOW LOCAL MEDIANS. LARGEMOUTH BASS WERE NOT TAKEN IN ANY SAMPLING EXCEPT FOR SHORELINE SEINING DURING WHICH FIFTEEN YOUNG OF THE YEAR FISH WERE CAUGHT ALONG WITH YOUNG OF THE YEAR BLUEGILL SUNFISH AND BLACK CRAPPIE. LARGEMOUTH BASS WERE NOTED ON SPAWNING BEDS DURING THE SURVEY AND ARE REPORTEDLY TAKEN IN FAIR NUMBERS BY ANGLERS.</p>",
