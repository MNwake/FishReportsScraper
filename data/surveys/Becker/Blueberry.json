                "narrative": "<p>Little Blueberry is located in eastern Becker County, seven miles southeast of Osage.  Little Blueberry has a surface area of 69 acres and a maximum depth of 47 feet.  There is a county access with an earthen ramp on the north shore of the lake.  Little Blueberry provides fishing opportunities for northern pike, panfish, and largemouth bass.  Due to its small size, Little Blueberry is very susceptible to over-harvest.  Anglers must practice selective harvest if they want to maintain or improve the fishery in Little Blueberry.The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical and chemical characteristics.  Little Blueberry is in lake class 28.  Other area lakes in this same classification include: Big Bass, Dinner, Emma, Gilmore, Indian, Nagel, Newman, Thomas, and Williams.Anglers can expect to find lots of small, \"hammer handle\" northern pike in Little Blueberry, with an occasional large pike.  Sampled northern pike had an average length and weight of 19.3 inches and 1.9 pounds, with pike measured up to 33.9 inches.  The panfish population in Little Blueberry is in good shape with good numbers and sizes of fish sampled when compared to other area lakes.  Anglers will find good numbers of crappie in the 9-10 inch range and bluegill and pumpkinseed in the 6-8 inch range.  Largemouth bass are present in Little Blueberry and bass were sampled in moderate numbers with standard survey gear.  No special sampling such as spring electrofishing has been conducted on Little Blueberry to adequately assess largemouth bass abundance or size.  Walleye are present in Little Blueberry in low numbers.  Walleye have not been stocked into Little Blueberry since 1974.  Other species sampled included moderate numbers of yellow perch, bowfin (dogfish), and yellow bullhead.  Black bullhead, brown bullhead, and white sucker were sampled in low numbers.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Little Blueberry is located in eastern Becker County, seven miles southeast of Osage.  Little Blueberry has a surface area of 69 acres and a maximum depth of 47 feet.  There is a county access with an earthen ramp on the north shore of the lake.  Little Blueberry provides fishing opportunities for northern pike, panfish, and largemouth bass.  Due to its small size, Little Blueberry is very susceptible to over-harvest.  Anglers must practice selective harvest if they want to maintain or improve the fishery in Little Blueberry. <br> \n <br> \nThe Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics.  Little Blueberry is in lake class 28.  Other area lakes in this same classification include: Big Bass, Dinner, Emma, Gilmore, Indian, Nagel, Newman, Thomas, and Williams. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike abundance (1.5 pike/gillnet) was down from past surveys and below the range \"typical\" for this lake class.  Past surveys have shown the northern pike population to be dominated by small, \"hammer handle\" pike, with an occasional large fish.  Little Blueberry has good panfish populations, composed of black crappie, bluegill, and pumpkinseed.  Anglers will find bluegill and pumpkinseed in the 6-8 inch size range.   Black crappie abundance (0.8 black crappie/trapnet) was down from past surveys.  Largemouth bass are present and were sampled in moderate numbers with standard survey gear.  Largemouth bass up to 18.0 inches were sampled.  Yellow perch were sampled in moderate numbers with fish measured up to 11.1 inches.  Walleye were not sampled in 2010, but have been sampled in past surveys in very low numbers.  Other species sampled included moderate numbers of bowfin (dogfish), and low numbers of black, brown, and yellow bullhead. <br> \n</p>",

It has a total area of 69 acres with a maximum depth of 47 feet.  The lake has a history of a fairly constant water level.  There is no lake water control stucture at the outlet, the Blueberry River.Ninety-five percent of the lake's immediate watershed is forest - aspen, Norway and jack pines - with some birch.  The other 5 percent is marsh.At the time of this survey, one cottage and eleven boats were reported on the lake.About 10 percent of the present lake is covered by standing emergent vegetation.Good fishing is reported for northern pike, crappies, largemouth bass, and bluegills.Notes by Watershed Biologist:This lake appears to ideally suited for centrarchid (largemouth bass) management.  Good populations of these species and northern pike are present, and fishing reportedly is good.  Spawning conditions were evaluated to be adequate for these species, and no special fish management appears to be needed to maintain the present status of fishing.Walleye stocking should be discontinued, since the lake does not appear to be suited for them.  No walleyes were taken in the test nets, and no fishing success is reported for them.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Little Blueberry Lake is located seven miles southeast of Osage in eastern Becker County.  Little Blueberry Lake has a surface area of 69 acres and a maximum depth of 47 feet.  The public access is located on the north shore of the lake and is owned and maintained by Becker County.  The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types, based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics.  Little Blueberry Lake is in lake class 28.  Other area lakes in this same class include Buck (15 miles northeast of Park Rapids), Emma (4.5 miles north of Dorset), Gilmore (3 miles northeast of Dorset), Ida 1.5 miles north ofDorset), Indian (4.5 miles northwest of Akeley), Loon (8 miles northeast of Park Rapids), Nagel (11 miles south of Akeley), Newman (9 miles southwest of Bemidji), Shingobee (2 miles southeast of Akeley), Williams (4 miles southeast of Akeley), Morgan (2 miles northeast of Menahga), and Dinner (15 miles northwest of Park Rapids).  The only other netting that has been conducted on Little Blueberry was the initial survey in 1963.       The northern pike gillnet catch of 7.8/net is within the range typical for lake class 28.  Sampled northern pike had an average length and weight of 19.0 inches and 1.7 pounds.  The 1963 survey had a lower northern pike gillnet catch (3.3/net), with a larger mean weight (3.4 lbs).  Though the northern pike sample was dominated by small fish, larger fish were present with fish measured up to 30.6 inches.  Northern pike growth was slow andbelow the average lengths of other class 28 lakes.     Little Blueberry Lake has a small walleye population that is probably the remnants of a private walleye stocking in the 1980's.  Six walleye were sampled, and were large in size ranging from 22.6 to 28.3 inches.  Walleye growth rates were similar to other area lakes.  Age analysis found the walleyes to be nine and eleven years old.  No walleye were sampled in the 1963 survey.  Migration of walleye from the Blueberry river into Little Blueberry Lake is a possibility, however, numerous beaver dams would likely prevent this.  Natural reproduction of walleye isnot likely due to lack of preferred spawning habitat.       Black crappie were sampled at 3.0/trapnet, within the range typical for lake class 28.  The 1963 survey had the identical trapnet catch rate, however, mean weight was slightly larger (0.5 lbs as compared to 0.3 lbs).  Black crappie had a average length of 7.9 inches with fish measured up to 11.8 inches.  Twenty-seven percent of the black crappie catch was 9.0 inches or larger.  Black crappie growth rates were slow and below the average lengths of other class 28 lakes.     Bluegill were sampled at 40.1/trapnet, within the range typical for lake class 28 and similar to the 1963 survey.  Sampled bluegill had an average length of 6.6 inches with fish measured up to 8.3 inches.  A quality bluegill population is present, with thirty-eight percent of the catch 7.0 inches or larger.  Bluegill growth rates were good and above the average lengths of other class 28 lakes.     Eight largemouth bass were sampled (1.0/trapnet), within the typical range of other class 28 lakes.  Largemouth bass up to 13.2 inches were measured.  Standard survey gear (gillnets and trapnets) are not effective tools in assessing largemouth bass populations.  To adequately assess largemouth bass abundance and size distribution, special sampling such as spring electrofishing needs to be conducted.  No electrofishing has been conducted onLittle Blueberry Lake..     The yellow perch gillnet catch of 10.3/net is within the range typical for lake class 28.  The yellow perch gillnet catch was much lower in 1963 (0.2/net).  Yellow perch were small in size, with an average length of 6.2 inches and with fish measured up to 9.6 inches.  Yellow perch are too small in size to provide a fishery to the angler, and are primarily a forage base for the northern pike and walleye populations.     Yellow, brown, and black bullhead were all sampled in Little Blueberry Lake.  Yellow bullhead were sampled in moderate numbers, while brown and black bullhead were sampled in low numbers.  Black bullhead were not sampled in the 1963 survey.     Other species sampled were white sucker and bowfin (dogfish).  White sucker catches were typical for lake class 28, while bowfin catches were high (1.8/trapnet).     Anglers can help maintain or improve the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for table fare, but to release medium to large-size fish.  Releasing these fish will help maintain the fish population in Stocking Lake and provides anglers with opportunities to catch more and larger fish in the future.</p>",
