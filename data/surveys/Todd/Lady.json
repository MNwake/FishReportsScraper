Bluegills under 7 inches dominated the trapnet catch, some larger bluegills 7 to 9 inches were sampled in the gillnets.  Anglers also report catching larger bluegills fairly consistently.  The walleye and northern pike gillnet catches in 1993 were similar to catches in 1988 and are within the normal range for lake class 24.  Walleye are not commonly caught from Lady Lake.  Small northern pike, 18 to 19 inches, are common.  The yellow perch population has increased dramtically since the 1988 survey.  The reason for this increase is unknown, but the predetor population should benefit from this more abundant prey base.  A higher perch population should also help maintain quality in the bluegill population by limiting recruitment.  Trapnet catches of black crappie are low but stable and anglers reported good success for this species in 1993.  The largemouth bass population is difficult to assess using standard lake survey gear.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Spring Trap netting was performed May 19-21 to provide pre-regulation data on the Bluegill size structure.  A bag limit of 5 sunfish was implemented on March 1, 2021 as Lady Lake was selected for participation in the statewide Quality Sunfish Initiative.  The objective of the lowered bag limit is to reduce sunfish harvest and allow for more fish to attain larger sizes (8-10 inches).  Data collected during this survey is considered pre-regulation data due to the short time period since the inception of the reduced bag limit.  Spring trap netting is the preferred method for evaluating panfish populations and has been conducted on the lake six previous times since 1999.  Several future evaluations are planned during the 10 year regulation evaluation period and will incorporate trap netting to provide proper comparisons. <br> \n <br> \nSpring trap netting in 2021 captured 378 Bluegill of which 358 were measured.  Large sample sizes are typical for Bluegill in Lady Lake as previous spring catches have ranged from 356-2025 fish.  Bluegill in 2021 ranged from 3.6 - 9.8 inches and mean length was 7.01 inches.  Many of the fish were of sizes desired by anglers as Bluegills over 7 inches comprised 60% of the catch and fish greater than 8 inches made up over 12% of the sample.  No previous trap net assessment on this lake caught a higher proportion of Bluegill exceeding 7 inches, and the percentage over 8 inches was at the higher end of the range of previous catches.  Five fish over 9 inches were measured.  Bluegill 10 inches or larger have not been sampled since 2014.  Bluegill size structure goals developed for the Quality Sunfish Initiative aim for at least 50% of the sample to exceed 7 inches, 20% to exceed 8 inches, 5% over 9 inches and the persistent presence of fish 10 inches or longer.  Whether voluntary or required due to the reduced bag limit, release of larger sunfish, especially fish over 9 inches will be important if the lake is to realize its potential in reaching management goals.  Additional criteria that may be used to measure success of the reduced sunfish bag limit include mean size, catch rate of fish over 8 inches, and mean length of top 10% of fish.  When combining the six pre-regulation spring trap net surveys mean size was 6.53 inches, mean catch rate of fish over 8 inches was 6.9/net, and mean length of the top 10% was 8.58 inches.   Aging data shows that Bluegill display good growth (mean length of 7.3 inches at Age 5) which was sustained well past 8 inches.    <br> \n  <br> \nBlack Crappie spring trap net catches can vary considerably due to sampling conditions and the Lady Lake catches have demonstrated this variability.  Spring trap net catches in Lady Lake have ranged from 4 to 133 fish.  A total of 130 crappies were captured in 2021 ranging in size from 5.6 to 14 inches, mean length was 9.9 inches with 55% of the sample 10 inches or longer.  Aging data from 2021 indicated that crappies display relatively fast growth, attaining 9.9 inches by Age 4 and 11.2 inches by Age 5.   A nice proportion of the crappies currently in Lady Lake are in the 9.5-10.5 inch range which should be attractive to anglers.  The crappie bag limit remains at 10 fish. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lady Lake is a popular panfish lake in Todd County, providing bluegill and black crappies fishing all year round.  The lake is lightly developed and has a cattail fringe around most of its shoreline.  Water clarity remains quite good for a lake in this area of the state.  Steep drop-offs and several underwater humps provide plenty of fishing structure.     Lady Lake supports a variety of fish species along with bluegills and crappies that may interest anglers, such as largemouth bass, northern pike, and walleye.  Bluegill numbers have increased since the last survey and medium size fish from 5 to 7 inches appear to dominate the population.  Some quality size fish up to 10 inches have been documented.  Another species of sunfish present in the lake is pumpkinseeds.  While not as numerous as the bluegills, they can reach quality size and provide a meal.  Black crappie numbers also increased and the majority of the fish captured in the  survey exceeded 9 inches in length.  Largemouth bass abundance appeared normal when compared to similar lakes.  Spring electrofishing for bass did produce a wide range of sizes with some individuals up to almost 20 inches being seen.  One undesirable change since the last survey was an increase in northern pike numbers.  The pike population has not been this high since 1983.  The average size for the pike was about 1.5 pounds, although an occassional bigger fish may be caught.  Yellow perch abundance has decreased since the last survey which may be a result of the high pike population.  Perch are an important prey species for gamefish to maintain good growth rates and they also help maintain a balanced bluegill population.  Walleye abundance has remained relatively stable since 1988.  Catching a walleye may take some patience, but may be well worth the time as all the walleye captured by the various sampling methods measured over 18 inches in length.  Walleye stocking was discontinued in 1991, but the population appears to be sustained by limited natural reproduction or immigration from Big Swan Lake.  Other species in the fish community included bowfin or dogfish, brown and yellow bullheads, green sunfish, rock bass, and carp.     Wetlands around the lake have helped to filter pollutants and sediment coming from the surrounding watershed thus improving the water quality entering the lake.  Minimizing impacts to the emergent vegetation around the lake is encouraged to maintain water quality in the lake while enjoying your lakeshore property.  Anglers are encouraged to release larger northern pike, walleye, and largemouth bass along with practicing selective harvest of bluegills and crappies to help sustain the quality and balance of the fish community.  Harvesting the small northern pike will decrease predation pressure on the yellow perch population and support better growth rates in the remaining pike.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>     Lady Lake is a popular panfish lake in Todd County, providing bluegill and black crappie fishing all year round.  The lake is lightly developed due to the abundance of marsh areas and cattail fringe around the shoreline.  Water clarity was good for a lake in this area of the State with a reading of 13.4 feet.  Steep drop-offs, weedlines, and several underwater humps provide plenty of fishing structure.  The lake supports a variety of fish species in addition to bluegill and crappie that may interest anglers, such as largemouth bass, northern pike, walleye, and bullheads. <br> \n      The bluegill population in Lady Lake looks to be in excellent condition in both numbers and size.  A significant portion of both the summer and spring catches consisted of fish over seven inches with quality size fish up to ten inches documented.  Black crappie have been a difficult species to sample in Lady Lake, but quality size fish over nine inches were observed in the various 2011 sampling efforts.  The lake also has a good bass population with some trophy size fish present although anglers are likely to see an average size of around 12-13 inches.  Northern pike numbers appear to have increased since the last survey in 2005, which may have a negative effect on the fish community.  The summer catch was dominated by small pike less than 21 inches in length, so keeping them off of your line could be a challenge.  Anglers should feel free to harvest surplus small northern pike.  Lady Lake's walleye population appears to be self sustaining though either natural reproduction or immigration from Big Swan Lake.  Population abundance has remained relatively stable and appears to be dominated by larger fish as all the walleye caught in the summer survey were over nineteen inches in length.  Yellow perch abundance, which was low in the last survey, continues to decline.  Low numbers of perch could have a negative effect on growth rates in the gamefish.  Yellow bullhead were the only bullhead species caught in the summer survey, however,  both brown bullhead and yellow bullhead were sampled in a 2011 spring assessment.  Some quality size individuals were observed of both species.    Other fish species in the fish community include pumpkinseed sunfish, rock bass, and bowfin or dogfish.   <br> \n      The wetlands around Lady Lake have helped to filter pollutants and sediment coming from the surrounding watershed thus improving the quality of water entering the lake.  Minimizing impacts to the emergent vegetation around the lake while enjoying your lakeshore property is encouraged to help filter the water and nutrients before entering the lake.  Anglers are encouraged to release larger northern pike, walleye, and largemouth bass along with practicing selective harvest of panfish to help sustain the quality and balance of the fish community.  Harvesting the smaller northern pike will decrease the predation pressure on the yellow perch and support better growth rates in the remaining pike. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lady Lake is a popular panfish lake in Todd County, providing bluegill and black crappie fishing all year round.  The lake is lightly developed due to the abundance of marsh areas and cattail fringe around the lake.  Water clarity was average for a lake in this area of the state with a reading of 7.5 feet.  Aquatic vegetation was found to grow to a depth of 18 feet.  The most common submerged plants, those growing primarily under the water surface, included muskgrass, coontail, northern water milfoil, and flatstem pondweed.  The most common shallow water bottom types were sand and marl.  Steep drop-offs, weedlines, and several underwater humps provide plenty of fishing structure.    The lake supports a variety of fish species along with bluegills and crappies that may interest anglers, such as largemouth bass, northern pike, walleye, and bullheads.  Lady Lake appears to have an excellent bluegill population with a good number of fish over 7 inches.  Crappie numbers were down from the last survey but nice size fish over 12 inches have been caught by anglers.  The lake also has a good bass population with some trophy size fish present although anglers are more likely to see an average size of about 12 inches.  Northern pike numbers appear to have declined which should be good for the rest of the fish community.  Some nice size pike up to 30 inches were seen in the survey but the average size was about 20 inches or just under 2 pounds.  Anglers looking for walleye may have to have some patience but the size may be worth the time as all of the walleye in the survey were over 17 inches in length.  Stocking was discontinued in 1991 but there may be some natural reproduction or migration from Trace Lake or Big Swan Lake.  Yellow perch numbers continue to be low which can have a negative effect on growth rates in the gamefish.  All three species of bullheads were caught in the survey but the yellow bullheads were by far more abundant than the brown and black bullheads.  Some quality individuals over 11 inches were observed from all three species.  Other species in the fish community include bowfin, hybrid sunfish, and pumpkinseeds.    The wetlands around the lake around the lake have helped to filter pollutants and sediment coming from the surrounding watershed thus improving the water quality entering the lake.  Minimizing impacts to the emergent vegetation around the lake is encouraged to maintain water quality in the lake while enjoying your lakeshore property.  Anglers are encouraged to release larger northern pike, walleye, and largemouth bass along with practicing selective harvest of bluegills and crappies to help sustain the quality and balance of the fish community.  Harvesting the small northern pike will decrease predation pressure on the yellow perch and support better growth rates in the remaining pike.

                "narrative": "<p>       A panfish assessment was conducted on Lady Lake in early June to evaluate the Bluegill and Black Crappie populations.  A special Bluegill regulation reducing the bag limit to ten fish is being proposed on six area lakes and Lady Lake would be a potential \"control\" lake for evaluation purposes.  Lady Lake is considered to have growth rates, length and age distribution, Bluegill abundance, and fishing pressure similar to the proposed regulation lakes. <br> \n       Four spring panfish assessments have been conducted on Lady Lake since 1999 and the 2014 assessment produced the lowest Bluegill catch (n=356; 35.6/TN) of the four assessments.  The highest catch was 2,025 Bluegill (225/TN) in 1999.  The 2011 panfish assessment also produced a good sample size, (n=1,234; 102.8/TN) with 981 Bluegill caught in 2005 (81.7/TN).  The one limitation of the larger catches was that a smaller portion of the fish were measured, 29% in 2011 and 11% in 1999, which likely biased the length frequency in favor of the larger fish. <br> \n       Lady Lake has a reputation of producing quality size fish and Bluegill up to 10 inches were caught in all but the 2005 panfish assessment.  The largest Bluegill in the 2005 panfish assessment was 9.4 inches.  Fish in the 2014 panfish assessment ranged from 2.9 to 10 inches with a mean length of 6.2 inches and modal length of 6 - 6.5 inches.  Bluegill larger than seven inches in length accounted for 23% (n=81) of the catch with 11% (n=41) over eight inches, 4% (n=15) over nine inches, and 0.6% (n=2) at 10 inches.   <br> \n       Fish up 10.2 inches were measured in the 2011 panfish assessment among all Bluegill greater than nine inches (n=9).  With the length frequency expansion, it appeared that about 53% of the fish exceeded seven inches with 9% (n=114) more than eight inches in length.  Mean length was 6.8 inches with a modal length of 7 - 7.5 inches.  Approximately 35% of the Bluegill in the 2005 panfish assessment exceeded seven inches and in 1999 approximately 15% of the catch was more than seven inches in length. <br> \n       The lake management goal for Lady Lake is to have a spring trap net catch of at least 50 Bluegill per trap net with 25% or more of the fish larger than seven inches.  The 2014 panfish assessment fell below both management goals whereas the previous three assessments surpassed the trap net catch goal.  Both the 2011 and 2005 assessments appeared to meet the percentage of fish greater than seven inches while the 1999 assessment was below that goal. <br> \n       Ages 2 through 10 and 12 were represented in the 2014 spring Bluegill catch.  A majority (60%) of the fish in the sample appeared to come from one year class, 2010, which strongly influenced mean and modal lengths.  All the year classes displayed fast growth rates when compared to an Area Mean Back-calculated Length table. <br> \n       The 2014 panfish assessment produced the highest Black Crappie catch (n=94) of the four panfish assessments, compared to 21 fish in 2011, 17 in 2005, and 4 in 1999.  The 2014 crappie ranged from 4.8 to 12.5 inches in length with a mean length of 8.8 inches and modal length of 8 - 8.5 inches.  Fish larger than nine inches comprised 38% (n=36) of the catch with 20% (n=19) more than 10 inches, 4% (n=4) over 11 inches, and 2% (n=2) exceeding 12 inches. <br> \n       The crappie sample size structure was more desirable in the three earlier panfish assessments.  While the mean length in 2011 was the same as in 2014 at 8.8 inches, modal length was 9 - 9.5 inches with 48% (n=10) of the fish exceeded nine inches and 14% (n=3) more than 11 inches.  Mean length in 2005 was 10 inches and modal length 10.5 - 11 inches.  Crappie over nine inches in length comprised 81% (n=13) of the sample with 31% (n=5) greater than 11 inches.  In 1999, three of the four crappie exceeded both nine inches and 11 inches in length. <br> \n       Ages 3 through 8 and 10 were represented in the 2014 crappie sample suggesting consistent year class production.  The majority of the fish were from the 2011 (32%) and 2010 (33%) year classes.  All age groups exhibited normal growth rates when compared to an Area Mean Back-calculated Length table. <br> \n        Current management goals on Lady Lake for Black Crappie are based on the lake survey gill net catches.  Spring electrofishing may be considered in the future to evaluate Black Crappie if few are caught in spring panfish trap net assessments. <br> \n       Two game fish species, Largemouth Bass and Northern Pike, were also captured during the 2014 spring panfish assessment.  The two bass were 16 and 19 inches in length while the eight pike were between 15 and 35 inches.  Other fish species sampled included Bowfin, Brown Bullhead, Golden Shiner, hybrid sunfish, Pumpkinseed, Rock Bass, and Yellow Bullhead.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>      A panfish assessment was conducted on Lady Lake in early June to evaluate the black crappie and bluegill populations.   Summer trap nets typically provide limited samples of larger individuals in a lake.  Six standard lake survey trap nets were set and lifted twice.  Scales were taken from both black crappie and bluegill for age and growth data.   As only a few bluegill over nine inches were caught, all fish over nine inches were measured and not included in the length frequency expansion.  <br> \n      Historically panfish assessments have not captured large numbers of black crappie.  The 2011 panfish assessment caught 21 black crappie between 5.1 and 11.8 inches in length.   Mean length was 8.8 inches and modal length 9 - 9.5 inches.  Crappie exceeding nine inches accounted for 48% (n=10) of the catch.   A similar assessment was conducted in June of 2005.  Seventeen crappie ranging from 4.1 to 13.4 inches were netted.  Size structure of the sample was dominated by larger fish.  Mean length was ten inches, modal length 10.5 - 11 inches, and 81% (n=13) of the fish were more than nine inches in length.   Twenty-four percent (n=5) exceeded eleven inches in length.  A panfish assessment in 1999 caught only four black crappie.  Three of the four fish were over nine inches, of which two exceeded eleven inches, with the longest being 11.6 inches. <br> \n      Ages 2 and 4 through 7 were represented in the 2011 panfish assessment.  The 2007 year class accounted for 52% (n=11) of the sample.  All ages displayed normal growth except for the single Age 6 fish which showed fast growth when compared to an area mean back-calculated length table. <br> \n      The 2011 summer population assessment was conducted using gill nets and spring daytime electrofishing.  Three crappie were caught in the gill nets while eight crappie were netted in the electrofishing runs.  The gill net fish measured from 10.8 to 11.8 inches and the electrofishing sample from 4.7 to 11.3 inches in length.  Crappie exceeding nine inches accounted for 75% (n=6) of the electrofishing catch.  The 1999 summer survey had the highest gill net and trap net catches of the summer surveys.  Twenty-eight crappie were caught in the gill nets and 10 in the trap nets.  The fish measured up to 11.6 inches in the gill nets and 10.2 inches in the trap nets.  Half the gill net catch were more than nine inches in length compared to 90% in the trap nets. <br> \n      Panfish assessments have been effective at catching bluegill.  The 2011 assessment sampled 1,234 bluegill, the 2005 assessment 981 bluegill, and the 1999 assessment 2,025 bluegill.  Ten-inch bluegill were measured in both 2011 and 1999 while the 2005 assessment had fish up to 9.4 inches.  Lady Lake has a reputation as a good panfish lake.  Over half (53%) of the measured fish in the 2011 panfish assessment were more than seven inches in length.  In the 2005 assessment, 35% of the catch was comprised of fish over seven inches, while in 1999, it was 15%. <br> \n      Ten year classes were represented in the 2011 panfish assessment, 2000 through 2009.  The 2005 year class dominated the catch, accounting for almost half of the sample (48%).  Two age groups, 3 and 4, displayed normal growth while the remaining age groups showed fast growth when compared to an area mean back-calculated length table. <br> \n      Larger bluegill were also evident in the 2011 summer gill net catch.  Twenty-one bluegill between 5.6 and 8.7 inches were caught with 52% (n=11) of the fish more than seven inches in length.  The summer gill nets in 2005 caught 26 bluegill that measured up to 7.4 inches with 19% (n=5) more than seven inches.  Smaller fish dominated the 1999 gill net catch (n=51).  Only one bluegill was more than seven inches in length.  Bluegill up to 9.1 inches were caught in the 1993 gill nets.  Twenty-eight percent (n=13) of the 47 bluegill caught exceeded seven inches.   <br> \n      Summer trap nets were used in 1999 and 1993.  Smaller bluegill dominated the catches in both of the surveys.  The 1999 trap nets netted 428 bluegill that measured up to 7.1 inches but mean length was 4.9 inches and 3% (n=14) were more than seven inches in length.  None of the 149 bluegill caught in the 1993 summer trap nets were over seven inches in length.   <br> \n      Gamefish species caught in the 2011 panfish assessment included two small largemouth bass, 5 and 7.5 inches in length, seven northern pike between 13 and 27 inches, and four walleye between 23 and 29 inches.  Additional fish species sampled included bowfin, brown bullhead, hybrid sunfish, pumpkinseed, rock bass, white sucker, and yellow bullhead. <br> \n      Black crappie appear to be a difficult species to catch in Lady Lake.  Summer gill nets have at times produced the same number of crappie as the panfish assessments.  Both methods have also produced good size fish and percent over nine inches.   The daytime spring electrofishing also showed some promise in sampling crappie.   An ice-out assessment could be tried as an alternative method.  The panfish assessments have worked better to evaluate the bluegill population.  The assessments have not only been effective at catching big sample sizes, they have also provided high numbers of fish over seven inches.  The panfish assessments have also provided the largest individuals recorded for the lake. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lady Lake (DOW# 77-0032-00; Lake Class 31) is a 174 acre lake located near Grey Eagle, Minnesota. A Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MNDNR) owned concrete boat ramp is located on the northeast Shore. Lady Lake has 3.35 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 62 feet. DNR has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different classes based on physical, chemical and other characteristics. Lady Lake is in Lake Class 31. Lakes in this class generally have a high amount of water less than 15 feet deep and are regular shaped. <br> \n <br> \nLady Lake should be a top destination for panfish anglers in the Little Falls area. It has both good numbers and size for Bluegill and Black Crappie. Bluegill up to 10 inches and Black Crappie up to 12 inches were sampled. Similarly Lady Lake has very good size structure for Largemouth Bass with fish up to 19 inches sampled. While anglers may have a tough time finding larger Northern Pike, there should be plenty of harvest opportunities of fish between 20-22 inches. <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species that anglers can expect to encounter include Bowfin (Dogfish), Brown Bullhead, Hybrid Sunfish, Pumpkinseed Sunfish, Rock Bass, Tullibee (Cisco), Walleye. Yellow Bullhead, and Yellow Perch. <br> \n <br> \nPeople can have significant impacts on lakes and the fish populations they support. Harvest, lakeshore development, removal of shoreline vegetation, and introductions of invasive species can all adversely affect fish populations. Curly Leaf Pondweed has been identified in Lady Lake. AIS can be moved from infested to non-infested waters by anglers, boaters, and lake shore owners and can adversely impact lakes and fish populations. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access. If you suspect an infestation of an invasive species in this lake, save a specimen and report it to a local natural resource office. Additional information on all of these topics can be found on the DNR website (www.dnr.state.mn.us) or by contacting the Little Falls Area Fisheries office. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lady Lake is a 207 acre bass/panfish lake located in central Todd County just north of Grey Eagle, MN.  A panfish assessment was conducted on Lady Lake in early June to evaluate Bluegill and Black Crappie populations.  A special Bluegill regulation reducing the bag limit to ten fish was implemented on six area lakes and Lady Lake is a \"control\" lake for evaluation purposes.  Lady Lake is considered to have growth rates, length and age distribution, Bluegill abundance, and fishing pressure similar to regulation lakes in the area. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill catches in five previous assessments ranged from 356 in 2014 to 2,025 in 1999.  A total of 550 Bluegill were captured during this survey ranging from 3.19 to 8.98 inches in total length.  Mean length of Bluegill sampled was 6.20 inches.  Bluegill exceeding 7 inches and 8 inches comprised 20% and 8% of the catch respectively.  Bluegill percentage over 7 inches in past surveys ranged from 15% in 1999 to 46% in 2016.  Bluegill over 10 inches, although rare, were captured in four of the previous five panfish assessments on Lady Lake, and 2019 was the first survey that failed to sample a Bluegill over 9 inches.  A subsample of Bluegill were aged and most fish in the eight inch range were 8 years old.  Angler behavior can have a large impact on Bluegill quality on area lakes.  To maintain quality Bluegill in local lakes, fisheries managers suggest anglers concentrate harvest on more abundant fish in the 6 and 7 inch range, limit harvest of fish in the 8 inch range, and release trophy size Bluegill greater than 9 inches in length. <br> \n <br> \nThe Black Crappie catch in 2019 was similar to previous panfish assessments.  A total of 26 Black Crappies were captured in 2019 ranging from 5.67 to 12.68 inches and averaging 8.20 inches.  Crappies exceeding 10 inches comprised 15% of the catch.  With the exception of 2014, previous spring panfish surveys also sampled low numbers of crappie.  Spring Black Crappie catches can be extremely variable in spring netting depending on weather and survey timing.  Low catches are not necessarily an indication of a low crappie population. <br> \n <br> \nIn additon to Bluegill and Black Crappie, Largemouth Bass, Northern Pike and Walleye were captured in spring trapnets.  Six Largemouth Bass sampled ranged from approximately 7 to 18.5 inches in length.  A total of nine Northern Pike from 17 to 30.5 inches were caught and three Walleyes from 21 to 27 inches were sampled.  Other fish sampled but not measured included:  Bowfin (Dogfish), Brown Bullhead, Common Carp, Hybrid Sunfish, Pumpkinseed, Rock Bass, and Yellow Bullhead.</p>",
