                "narrative": "<p>Carp, northern pike, and black crappie are present in higher than expected numbers for lakes in this area.  Black and yellow bullheads and white sucker were caught in average numbers.  Bluegill numbers are low.  Yellow perch were taken only by shoreline seining and must be considered to be present in very low numbers.  Northern pike are apparently either naturally reproducing or result from migration from Long Lake or a combination.  Several year classes are present with II and III annulus fish, respectively, being the most abundant.  Growth was good at these ages.  Bluegill numbers are low with virtually the entire population made up of 1979 year class fish.  Winterkills, high carp numbers and consequently low amounts of rooted vegetation combine to effectively keep bluegill numbers low.  Growth of I annulus bluegill was good.  Black crappie numbers are high with four year classes represented.  Age III fish were most abundant and showed good growth.  Age I and IV fish were equally abundant and showed fast and good growth respectively.  The combined effects which keep bluegill numbers low seemingly do not have similar effects on the black crappie.  The carp population is very high with the bulk of the fish falling between 11.0 and 12.9 inches with an average weight of slightly under one pound for all fish combined.  The black bullhead population was made up primarily of fish under 6.5 inches (median 5.5-5.9) and the yellow bullhead population made up primarily of fish over 7.5 inches (median 9.5-9.9).</p>",
