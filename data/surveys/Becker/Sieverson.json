                "narrative": "<p>Sieverson Lake is a 77-acre, relatively undeveloped, non-meandered lake surrounded by a mixed hardwood and coniferous forest.  There is only one home on the lake and an individual owns the majority of surrounding shoreland.  There is a public access on the north shore off State Highway 34 maintained by the DNR.  The lake's small size and popularity as an angling lake appear to make its fish populations susceptible to over fishing.Four lake surveys have been done on this lake since it was initially surveyed in 1983.  The most recent was in 2005.  Sieverson Lake is best suited to bass, northern pike, and panfish like bluegills and crappies.  Northern pike catches were relatively high and average sizes were relatively low.  The mean length of sampled pike was 20.2 inches and the mean weight was 1.7 pounds.  None larger than 29 inches were sampled.  Bluegills, black crappies, and largemouth bass were all sampled at normal rates of abundance compared to other similar lakes.  Bluegills in this lake grow more slowly than the statewide average and it takes over six years for bluegills to reach 7.0 inches in length.  Small lakes with moderate fishing pressure and slow growth rates are especially vulnerable to over-fishing, leading to further stunting and the lack of large bluegills in the fishery.  Anglers are encouraged to release a portion of larger fish and keep smaller ones for eating.There is very little natural reproduction of walleye in Sieverson Lake and periodic stocking sustains the modest population that exists.  Walleye fingerlings have been stocked approximately biennially since their introduction in 1984.  Walleye in Sieverson Lake are now considered \"normal\" in abundance compared to similar lakes.  Walleye size tends to be larger than normal and average length of captured walleye was 21.1 inches while the maximum length was 23.6 inches.  Other fish sampled in Sieverson Lake include all three species of bullhead, pumpkinseed sunfish, hybrid sunfish, and white sucker.  A white sucker was captured for the first time in 1994, which was probably a bait bucket introduction.  None were found in 2005.  Yellow bullheads are \"normal\" in number, but are much more abundant than either black or brown bullhead.  This is an indicator that the lake's water quality is good.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Sieverson Lake is a small, relatively undeveloped lake surrounded by a mixed hardwood and coniferous forest.  There is only one lakeshore home, and one individual owns the majority of the surrounding shoreland.  There is a state-owned public access on the north shore off State Highway 34.  Sieverson Lake is ecologically best suited for Largemouth Bass, Northern Pike, and panfish like Bluegills and Black Crappies.   <br> \n <br> \nIn 2023, Northern Pike catches were close to average at about nine fish per gill net.  The average length of sampled pike was 20 inches, and the average weight was 2 pounds.  There is very little, if any, natural reproduction of Walleye in Sieverson Lake and periodic stocking sustains the modest population that exists.  Walleye fingerlings have been stocked approximately every other year since their introduction in 1984.  Walleye numbers are low, but still considered normal compared to similar lakes.  Walleye sizes in Sieverson tend to be larger than the statewide average.  During the 2023 survey, the average length of sampled Walleyes was 21 inches. <br> \nBluegills and Black Crappies were sampled at normal rates of abundance compared to other ecologically similar lakes.  Bluegills were primarily small, with an average length of six inches and only 3% of mature Bluegills measuring longer than eight inches.  Bluegills in Sieverson Lake are somewhat slow growing and require almost nine years of growth to produce an eight-inch fish.  The average length of Black Crappie was eight inches, with eight percent of Black Crappie measuring longer than 10 inches.  Largemouth Bass sizes were good with fish averaging 15 inches and the largest bass captured measuring almost 19 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species sampled in Sieverson Lake in 2023 include Black Bullhead, Yellow Bullhead, Pumpkinseed, Hybrid Sunfish, and Yellow Perch.  Perch numbers were extremely low during the 2023 survey and the large numbers of pike are likely keeping the Yellow Perch population suppressed.</p>",

Bluegill numbers remain close to local median with good individual growth.  Youngest year classes are predominant as in '83 survey.  Largemouth bass and black crappies are present.  Walleye fingerlings were stocked in '84, '85 and '87, but only two were caught in test nets.  Growth appears to be fast; abundance is low; and natural spawning habitat is poor at best.  Yellow perch population has declined significantly while the yellow bullhead population appears to have increased since 1983.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Sieverson Lake is a 77 acre, relatively undeveloped, non-meandered lake surrounded by mixed hardwood/coniferous forest.  There is only one home on the lakeshore and the majority of surrounding land is owned by an individual.  There is a public access on the north shore off State Highway 34 maintained by the MN D.N.R.  The lake's small size and popularity as an angling lake would appear to make it's fish populations vulnerable to over exploitation.     Since the lake was initially surveyed in 1983, only a short history of fish population trends exist.  The northern pike population appears to have steadily declined during that time.  Although northern pike are less numerous in the lake than in the past, they tend to be somewhat larger.  Mean length of sampled pike is 22.9 inches and mean weight is 2.5 pounds.  However, none larger than thirty inches were captured.  The apparent decline in pike numbers in Sieverson Lake may have one or more causes including: (1) a decline in yellow perch between 1983 and 1989, (2) competition from walleye, originally introduced in 1984, (3) increased angling pressure, or (4) unfavorable spring spawning conditions due to drought or beaver activity.  The trapnet catch of yearling pike indicates that recent natural reproduction was good and abundance will probably rebound.     The gillnet catch of yellow perch has already rebounded from a low of 6.0/GN in 1989 to the current 63.0/GN, well above the \"normal\" range for similar lakes.  The apparent perch crash in the late eighties may have been caused by the introduction of walleye.  The primary prey for both walleye and northern pike in Sieverson Lake is yellow perch.     Walleye fingerlings have been stocked approximately biennially since introduction in 1984.  Walleye in Sieverson Lake are now considered \"normal\" in abundance for similar lakes.  Walleye size tends to be larger than normal and average length of captured walleye is 21.0 inches while the maximum length is 27.2 inches.  Evidence is not completely clear, but, the stocking of walleye may have caused or contibuted to the short term crash in yellow perch numbers and the decline in northern pike in Sieverson Lake.  A reduction in walleye stocking rates in the nineties is paralleled by the strong recovery of yellow perch.     Panfish populations are also average in abundance compared to similar lakes.  Mean length of sampled bluegill is presently 6.3 inches and maximum is 8.9 inches.  Although \"keeper\" size bluegill appear to be more numerous than in the past, large crappie (over 11 inches) and bluegill (over 8 inches) are fewer than in past surveys.  Anglers may be \"cropping off\" large panfish as soon as they reach preferred size.  Largemouth bass are present and may have increased in number over the past decade.     Other fish sampled in Sieverson Lake include all three species of bullhead, pumpkinseed sunfish, hybrid sunfish, and white sucker.  A white sucker was captured for the first time in 1994, probably a bait bucket introduction.  Yellow bullhead are \"normal\" in number, but, are much more abundant than either black or brown bullhead.  This is an indicator that the lake's water quality is fairly high.     It's relatively small size and angling popularity appear to cause Sieverson Lake to be susceptible to over-fishing.  Generally speaking, however, fish populations appear to be maintaining abundance and size structures.  One exception to this statement is the possibility that the proportion of large (preferred length) bluegill and black crappie may be declining.  This phenomenon is not unique to Sieverson Lake but will soon require some tough choices (bigger or more fish?, more or fewer regulations?) for Minnesota's anglers.  The lack of shoreline development and historical presence of relatively large bluegill appear to make this lake an ideal candidate for special regulations.  It is a testament to nature's resilience that fish populations have maintained themselves as well as they have despite continued increasing demand.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Sieverson Lake is a small, relatively undeveloped, non-meandered lake surrounded by a mixed hardwood and coniferous forest.  There is only one lakeshore home and one individual owns the majority of the surrounding shoreland.  There is a state-owned public access on the north shore off State Highway 34.  The lake's small size and popularity as an angling lake appear to make its fish populations susceptible to over-fishing. <br> \n <br> \nFive lake surveys have been done on this lake since it was initially surveyed in 1983.  The most recent was in 2014.  Sieverson Lake is ecologically best suited to Largemouth Bass, Northern Pike, and panfish like Bluegills and Black Crappies.  In 2014, Northern Pike catches were high and average sizes were low.  The average length of sampled pike was 19.6 inches and the average weight was 1.6 pounds.  No pike larger than 29 inches were found.  Bluegills and Black Crappies were sampled at normal rates of abundance compared to other ecologically similar lakes.  Largemouth Bass numbers were down somewhat in 2014, but sizes were good.  Average lengths for Bluegill, Black Crappie, and Largemouth Bass were 6.3, 9.4, and 14.1 inches, respectively.  Approximately 14% of mature Bluegills were longer than eight inches and 28% of mature Black Crappie were over 10 inches in length.  Bluegills in Sieverson Lake are somewhat slow growing and about eight or nine years are required to produce an eight-inch fish.  Small lakes with moderate to heavy fishing pressure and slow growth rates can be vulnerable to over-fishing, leading to further stunting and a lack of large Bluegills in the fishery.  Consequently, anglers are encouraged to release a portion of larger fish and keep smaller ones for eating. <br> \n <br> \nThere is very little, if any, natural reproduction of Walleye in Sieverson Lake and periodic stocking sustains the modest population that exists.  Walleye fingerlings have been stocked approximately biennially since their introduction in 1984.  Walleye numbers are low, but still considered normal compared to similar lakes.  Walleye sizes tend to be larger than normal and the average length of sampled Walleye was 22 inches. <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species sampled in this lake in 2014 include Yellow Bullhead, Pumpkinseed, hybrid sunfish, and yellow perch.  Perch numbers have been very low during the past two fisheries surveys and the large numbers of pike are likely keeping the Yellow Perch population suppressed.</p>",
