                "narrative": "<p>Katherine Lake is a 66.6 acre, soft-water lake with a maximum depth of 6 feet. This lake is the headwaters of the Cloquet River system. The inlet consists of variable undefined springs on the northeast side, and the Cloquet River is the outlet. The lake level is relatively stable. The lake is surrounded by forest, and most of the shoreline is marsh of floating bog. Shoal soils are gravel and some rubble mostly covered by muck.     Three stands of bulrush are found in the lake, and largeleaf pondweed occurs in deeper water in the north-central section of the lake.     Northern Pike and Yellow Perch were the only fish taken in test netting and shoreline seining. Northern Pike are numerous (6.5 fish per gillnet) but none over 25\" were taken. Yellow Perch were abundant and reached a maximum of 11.0\" in size.     Spawning areas are adequate for Northern Pike and poor for other species.     There is no designated public access, although the public is presently using a private access at the southwest end of the lake.     Fishing pressure is apparently light and no increase is foreseen for this lake in the near future.</p>",
