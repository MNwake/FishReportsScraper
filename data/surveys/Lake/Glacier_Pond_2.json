Glacier Pond 2 differs in that it drops off quicker along shore, and has clearer and harder (more mineralized) water than average for this lake class.Glacier Pond 2 stratifies in midsummer and has less than 5 ppm oxygen below about 17 ft, at which depth the water temperature is 45-50 F.  There is an inlet from an adjacent pond, but no outlet.  Lake bottom substrates are dominated by gravel and boulder.  Aquatic plants, mostly pondweeds, are found in a narrow fringe along the mostly steep shoreline, and in the small bays.Glacier Pond 2 has been stocked with trout since 1948.  The lake was reclaimed (poisoned) in 1952 and again in 1985 to remove competing fish species, mostly small white sucker.  The 1997 assessment catch of 1.7 lb of trout per gillnet was lower than the average of 5.1 lb/gillnet in three previous assessments done after the 1985 reclamation, but was similar to the average of 1.5 lb/gillnet in six assessments prior to 1985.  By comparison, the median catch of trout in 24 stream trout lakes in the Ely Fisheries Management Area was 6.0 lb/gillnet.A total of 21 brook trout were caught in the 1997 assessment; 15 in the gillnets and 6 in the trapnets.  All were between 5.8\" and 9.3\" and had been stocked the previous fall as fingerlings.  No brook trout from the 1996 and 1995 stockings were captured, nor were rainbow trout from the 1994 stocking.  Trout stomachs contained daphnids and chironomids.  In addition to brook trout and minnows, the trapnets contained an average of 27 native crayfish.  The minnow population, mostly fatheads and dace, was similar to recent assessments.</p>",

Glacier Pond 2 differs in that it drops off quicker along the shore and has clearer and harder (more mineralized) water than average for this lake class.Glacier Pond 2 thermally stratifies in midsummer and retains 5 ppm oxygen to a depth of about 17 ft, at which depth the water temperature is 45-50 F.  Note that the oxygen levels during this assessment, in early June, were higher than is normal for midsummer.  Winter oxygen levels are good, with more than 5 ppm just underneath the ice.  There is an inlet from an adjacent pond, but no outlet.  Bottom substrates are mostly gravel and boulder.  Aquatic plants, mostly pondweeds, are found in a narrow fringe along the mostly steep shoreline, and in the small bays.This assessment consisted of two gillnets and four 1/4\" trapnets, set in early June.  Ten previous assessments, dating back to 1969, consisted of 1-2 gillnets and 0-2 trapnets.  Assessments have been done in late May or early June beginning in 1981.Glacier Pond 2 has been stocked with trout since 1948, was reclaimed in 1952, and was again reclaimed in 1985 due to the presence of many small white sucker.  Brook trout were stocked annually, except in reclamation years, and except in 1994, when rainbow trout fingerlings were stocked.  Stocking was changed to alternate year stockings of brook trout and rainbow trout beginning with the stocking of rainbow trout in 1998, based on plankton tows in 1992 which showed good numbers of plankton forage for rainbow trout.The 2000 catch of 3.5 lb of brook trout per gillnet was lower than the median catch of 5.4 lb of stream trout per gillnet in 25 stream trout lakes (excluding mine pit lakes) in the Ely Management Area, and  lower than the median catch of 5.0 lb of trout per gillnet in four assessments in Glacier Pond 2 following the 1985 reclamation.  All of the brook trout captured in 2000 had been stocked the previous September at the rate of 30/lb, and had grown to an average length of 8.0\" (range: 6.5-10.0\") in the eight months since being stocked.  Brook trout stomachs contained the following: empty (9), minnows (11), midge larvae (8), midges (3), crayfish (2), sculpin (1), fathead minnow (1), unidentified insect (1), and dragonfly nymph (1).No rainbow trout from the 1998 fingerling stocking were captured by our sampling gear in this assessment, although an angler fishing on the lake during the assessment caught a 18.0\" rainbow and reported catching others on previous trips to the lake.  The angler-caught rainbow had several fathead minnows in its stomach.The small mesh trapnets in 2000 contained similar numbers and sizes of brook trout as the gillnets, and in addition contained many fathead minnows, some finescale dace, and an average of 17 native crayfish per net.           </p>",

Glacier Pond 2 drops off more quickly along the shoreline and has clearer and harder (more mineralized) water than most of the lakes in this lake class. <br> \n <br> \nGlacier Pond 2 thermally stratifies in midsummer with surface temperatures about 70 F and bottom temperatures about 40 F.  Good oxygen for trout (more than 5 ppm) is retained to a depth of about 21 feet, where the temperature is about 44 F.  Winter oxygen levels are good, with more than 5 ppm just underneath the ice.  There is an inlet from a small adjacent pond, but no outlet.  Lake bottom substrates along the shoreline are mostly gravel and boulder.  Aquatic plants, mostly pondweeds, are found in a narrow fringe along the steep shoreline, and in the small bays. <br> \n <br> \nGlacier Pond 2 has been stocked with trout since 1948, and has been poisoned twice, in 1952 (to remove walleye) and 1985 (to remove many small white sucker).  Rainbow trout were initially stocked, then brook trout were stocked for many years.  Rainbow trout were stocked periodically from 1994 through 2004 in the hope they would forage on zooplankton populations that appeared to be abundant.  Rainbow stocking was discontinued due to poor survival, and only brook trout have been stocked the last few years. <br> \n <br> \n The 2006 fish population assessment consisted of two standard gillnets and four small mesh (1/4 inch bar mesh) trapnets.  Twelve previous assessments, dating back to 1969, consisted of 1-2 gillnets and 0-2 trapnets.  Assessments have been done in late May or early June since 1981. <br> \n <br> \nThirty-five brook trout were captured in the standard gillnets and 13 were caught in the small mesh trapnets.  All except one of these trout had been stocked the previous fall as fingerlings averaging 30/lb and 4.5 inches, and had grown to an average length of 7.6 inches (range: 6.2 to 9.2 inches) when recaptured eight months later.  One larger brook trout (17.7 inches) was also captured in 2006.  The stomachs of these trout contained a variety of items: midges (6 stomachs), daphnia and midges (6), minnows (5), minnows and midges (5), crayfish (5), empty (4), daphnia (3), minnows and daphnia (1). <br> \n <br> \nHigh numbers of fathead minnows were caught in the small mesh trapnets in 2006.  Dace (northern redbelly and pearl) were also caught in these trapnets, as were 126 native crayfish (Orconectes virilis).    <br> \n <br> \nThe 2006 catch of trout by weight of 4.7 lb/gillnet was higher than the median trout catch of 1.9 lb/gillnet in all investigations on this lake and was similar to the median catch of 4.2 lb/gillnet in recent investigations of 25 stream trout lakes in the Tower Fisheries Management Area.</p>",

The average brook trout sampled was 9.1 inches and about 0.4 pounds each. The length range of brookies sampled was from 6.2 inches to a maximum length of 15 inches.

Glacier Pond 2 differs in that it drops off quicker along the shoreline and has clearer and harder (more mineralized) water than average for this lake class.Glacier Pond 2 thermally stratifies in midsummer and retains adequate oxygen for trout (more than 5 ppm) to a depth of about 17 ft, at which depth the water temperature is 45-50 F.  Note that the oxygen levels during this assessment, in early June, were higher than is normal for midsummer.  Winter oxygen levels are good, with more than 5 ppm just underneath the ice.  There is an inlet from an adjacent pond, but no outlet.  Bottom substrates are mostly gravel and boulder.  Aquatic plants, mostly pondweeds, are found in a narrow fringe along the mostly steep shoreline, and in the small bays.This assessment consisted of two gillnets and four 1/4\" bar mesh trapnets, set in early June.  Eleven previous assessments, dating back to 1969, consisted of 1-2 gillnets and 0-2 trapnets.  Assessments have been done in late May or early June since 1981.Glacier Pond 2 has been stocked with trout since 1948, was reclaimed in 1952, and was again reclaimed in 1985 due to the presence of many small white sucker.  Brook trout were stocked annually, except in reclamation years and except in 1994, when rainbow trout fingerlings were stocked.  Stocking was changed to alternate year stockings of brook trout and rainbow trout in 1998, based on plankton tows in 1992 which showed good numbers of plankton forage for rainbow trout.The 2003 catch of 3.5 lb of trout per gillnet was near the median catch of 4.6 lb of stream trout per gillnet in recent investigations of 25 stream trout lakes (excluding mine pit lakes) in the Tower Fisheries Management Area, and was similar to the median catch of 4.0 lbs per gillnet in six investigations of Glacier Pond 2 following the 1985 reclamation.  The average size of the brook trout captured in 2003 was 14.0\", which was larger than the average size of 10.3\" in the six investigations following the 1985 reclamation.  Brook trout were not stocked in the fall of 2002 and the larger average size of brook trout in the 2003 assessment was due to the absence of brook trout from the previous fall's fingerling stocking which comprised the majority of brook trout caught in previous assessments.  The stomachs of brook trout captured in 2003 contained fathead minnows and dace.No rainbow trout were captured during the 2003 investigation, even though rainbow fingerlings were stocked the previous fall.The small mesh trapnets in 2003 contained high numbers of fathead minnows (1,410/net) and moderate numbers of dace (95/net).  These numbers are much higher than seen in other investigations on this lake following the 1985 reclamation.  The small mesh trapnets in 2003 also captured 16 native crayfish/net, which was similar to the 17/net captured in 2000. </p>",
