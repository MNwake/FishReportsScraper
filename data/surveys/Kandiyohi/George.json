                "narrative": "<p>George is a small (231 acres) lake with a maximum depth of 34 feet. Water clarity hasbeen generally good (11.3 feet on 6-26-94). Submergent vegetation is abundant within thesouthern bay and northwest corner, but limited around the remaining portion of the lake.Hardstem bulrush is limited to one patch (< 30 ft sq. area) in the southern bay, a smallpatch (< 5 stems) along the northwest shore, and a small patch (< 5 stems) along the westshore. Nutrient levels (phosphorous) have been moderate in George (0.027 ppm on 8-22-90,0.055 ppm on 8-16-81). Drainage into George is limited to a small inlet (wetland/agriculturaloriginated) entering the west shore, a culvert inlet connecting to a wetland on the northshore, a culvert intake on the south shore, and an outlet that connects to Nest Lake (34-154)via a small wetland on the north shore. The outlet connection to Nest Lake can act as aninlet during high water within the Middle Fork of the Crow River watershed. Fish screens andwood panels have blocked these connections in the past, but fish (northern pike) have enteredthe two wetlands to spawn when the panels were damaged during high water. The shoreline iscomprised mostly of hardwood fringes and residential lawns on gradually sloped shorelines.There are two small wetlands located adjacent to the lake (south shore and north shore). Thelake is highly developed (95 homes/cabins) around the entire shoreline with the exception ofthe church camp property along the northeast shore. George is a popular recreational lake(swimming, boating, skiing, etc.). Anglers generally seek largemouth bass, walleye, northernpike, and bluegill on George. Although bluegill are readily caught, the fish are usuallysmall. Walleye angling can be good at times, but are generally susceptible to angling onlyduring brief periods of the year (first ice, May/June, etc.). Largemouth bass have beenreported fair to good for numbers, but the size has been generally small (<12 inches).Management activities have included biennial walleye fingerling stocking, winter rescuenorthern pike stocking, and removal of stunted bluegill from 1980-1990.     Walleye abundance in 1994 (6.8 fish/gillnet) was above the normal range (1.3 - 5.0fish/gillnet) for similar lakes, but comparable to the historical average (7.1 fish/gillnet).The 1994 average size (1.2 lbs from gillnets) was the same as the historical average. Thelargest walleye caught was 22.1 inches. The population size structures from previous surveyshave been fairly consistent. Growth rates appear average for the first four years, butslightly below average afterwards. There appears to be a good walleye year class present froma 1992 stocking in addition to fair numbers of other stocked year classes. It appears thatsome limited natural reproduction may be occurring, however this will not be confirmed untilfall electrofishing surveys are conducted on George. Local reports have indicated goodwalleye angling success during the early 1995 summer season.     Northern pike abundance in 1994 (1.0 fish/gillnet) was below the normal range (3.5 -10.5 fish/gillnet) for similar lakes and below the historical average (2.3 fish/gillnet). The1994 average size (3.8 lbs from gillnets) was above the historical average (2.9 lbs). Thelargest fish caught was 28.3 inches. Growth rates appear moderate. Northern pike spawningareas are limited. High northern pike numbers in previous surveys (5.2 fish/gillnet in 1975,4.5 fish/gillnet in 1981) appear to coincide with intensive winter rescue northern pikestocking. In recent years, available winter rescue northern pike have been limited due to lowarea population numbers and few lakes experiencing winterkill.     Largemouth bass abundance in the 1994 spring electrofishing survey appears moderate(18.0 fish/hour), but below the 1990 survey (79.6 fish/hour). Largemouth bass populationgreater than 8 inches was estimated at 3,862 fish in 1990. The 1994 average size (1.0 lbs)was above the 1990 survey (0.5 lbs). The largest fish captured in 1994 was 18.4 inches.Growth rates appear slightly below average especially for fish older than five years. Youngof year largemouth bass captured from late August seining were below average size (2.1inches).     Bluegill abundance in 1994 (76.5 fish/trapnet) was above the normal range (6.1 - 46.6fish/trapnet) for similar lakes and above the historical average (50.2 fish/trapnet). The1994 average size (4.5 inches from gillnets and trapnets) was below the historical average(5.1 inches). The current population size structure is poor, however, it had been steadilyincreasing during the three previous surveys. Stunted bluegill removal occurred in 1980 (368fish), 1982-83 (128 fish), 1985 (1,330 fish), 1986 (4,555 fish), 1987 (1,551 fish), 1988(1,800 fish), 1989 (2,719 fish), and 1990 (182 fish). Initially it appeared that bluegillremoval may have aided bluegill growth. However, it is unlikely that bluegill removal alonewas the major factor for improving bluegill growth rates during this time frame (1981-1990)due to the small quantities of fish removed in relation to total numbers present. Anotherpotential factor that could have influenced improved bluegill population growth rates priorto 1990 were high numbers of potential predators (largemouth bass). These predators presentwere small (8-12 inches), but could target young of year and yearling bluegill. In addition,bluegill population size structures in other area lakes also appeared optimal during thissame time period. Current bluegill growth rates are below average.     Yellow perch abundance in 1994 (4.6 fish/gillnet) was within the normal range (3.4 -43.6 fish/gillnet) for similar lakes, but below the historical average (8.7 fish/gillnet).The 1994 average size (6.2 inches from gillnets and trapnets) was slightly below thehistorical average (6.4 inches). Growth rates appear average.     Black crappie abundance in 1994 (0.2 fish/gillnet) were below the normal range (0.6 -3.5 fish/gillnet) for similar lakes and below the historical average (9.5 fish/gillnet).Black crappie abundance has been below 1.0 fish/gillnet since the 1990 and 1986 surveys. InJune of 1994, 877 black crappie adults were stocked into George to boost naturalreproduction, however no young of year black crappie were caught in the 1994 August seinehauls.     Black bullhead abundance in 1994 (0.3 fish/trapnet) was within the normal range (0.3 -3.2 fish/trapnet) for similar lakes, but below the historical average (1.0 fish/trapnet). The1994 black bullhead average size (11.0 inches from gillnets and trapnets combined) wassimilar to the historical average (10.5 inches). Yellow bullhead abundance in 1994 (1.5fish/trapnet) was within the normal range (1.3 - 9.8 fish/trapnet) for similar lakes andcomparable to the historical average (1.7 fish/trapnet). The 1994 yellow bullhead averagesize (11.8 inches from gillnets and trapnets combined) was above the historical average (10.8inches).     Management priorities for George Lake are to maintain present water quality, increasehabitat (transplanting hardstem bulrush) for black crappie and largemouth bass, continuewinter rescue northern pike and biennial walleye fingerling stocking to meet target levelsspecified in the Lake Management Plan. Encouraging residential lakeshore owners and areafarmers to use best land management practices (planting buffer strips, reducing nutrientrunoff by limiting lawn fertilizing or using no phosphorous fertilizers, using conservationaltillage) is the key to maintaining present water quality due to the small subwatersheddrainage area entering into George. Increasing bluegill average size appears unlikely withcurrent management techniques (bluegill removal alone). It appears that past bluegill removallevels have not been sufficient. Perhaps stricter harvest regulations are needed to protectboth predator fish (largemouth bass) and potential genetically superior bluegill (fish > 7.0inches) in conjunction with stunted bluegill removal (if time permits) in order to producea long term change in bluegill growth rates.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A standard survey was conducted on George Lake in late June of 2018. A night spring electrofishing survey for Largemouth Bass (post spawn) was also conducted in mid-June of 2018. A targeted survey is generally used for sampling a specific kind of fish or time of year (i.e. spawning season, fall season, etc.) unlike a standard survey which samples a wider range of fish species during the summer months using standard methodology (i.e. standard time of year, set sampling stations, taking water clarity readings and oxygen/temperature profiles, etc.) and gears (i.e. lake survey gillnets, trapnets and possibly spring electrofishing for Largemouth Bass). <br> \n <br> \nGeorge is a small (231 acres), moderately deep (34 feet maximum), and low to moderately productive lake located in Kandiyohi County. The shoreline is composed of primarily residential homes (99 homes), in addition to hardwood trees, a large church property and adjacent wetland areas. The immediate watershed is composed of residential homes, hardwood trees, wetlands, grasslands and agricultural row crops. Agricultural row crop inputs into George Lake are minimal. There are three small inlets that drain into George and an outlet that connects to Nest Lake during high water. The Nest Lake connection may flow either way depending upon water levels in both lakes. Late ice out (late April-early May) occurred on area lakes in 2018. The water clarity was good on June 25, 2018 (secchi=12.0 feet). Dissolved oxygen levels were above 5.0 ppm down to 18 feet deep during the 2018 survey. Total phosphorus was low (0.013 ppm) in early June of 2013. Water levels were slightly above normal during the 2018 survey. Submergent vegetation species (muskgrass, various pondweeds, water moss, northern milfoil, bladderwort, and filamentous algae) are moderately abundant within the lake. Emergent vegetation is limited to small stands of hardstem bulrush along the northeast and southeast areas. Zebra Mussels were found in George during 2017. Shoalwater substrates consist mostly of sand, gravel, and rubble. George is a popular fishing lake for Bluegill, Black Crappie, Largemouth Bass and Northern Pike. Local anglers have reported good winter angling success for Black Crappie, Bluegill and Walleye during recent years. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie numbers were abundant in 2018 (4.33 fish/gillnet) compared to similar lakes. The Black Crappie gillnet historical average catch rate is 5.84 fish/gillnet. Low numbers of Black Crappie were caught in the 2018 trapnets (0.10 fish/trapnet). The Black Crappie average size was large (9.3 inches and 0.49 pounds) from gillnets. Black Crappie growth rates were below average. The 2013 and 2012 year classes comprised 21% and 33% respectively of the 2018 Black Crappie catch.

The Walleye historical catch rate is 5.11 fish/gillnet for George. The 2018 Walleye average size was moderate (1.88 pounds and 17.3 inches) from gillnets. Walleye growth rates were average. The 2015 and 2014 year classes comprised 28% and 33% respectively of the 2018 Walleye catch. Older year classes were also present. Walleye (yearlings, adults, fingerlings) were stocked recently in 2010 (61 adult/yearlings, 58 pounds; 3,704 fingerlings, 347 pounds;), 2012 (16,29 yearlings, 435 pounds), 2013 (221 yearlings, 96 pounds), 2014 (77 adults, 102 pounds; 1,412 yearlings, 321 pounds), 2016 (133 adults, 173 pounds; 326 yearlings, 151 pounds) and 2017 (137 adults, 231 pounds; 614 yearlings, 144 pounds; 18 fingerlings, 2 pounds). <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass (post spawn) numbers were abundant (58.86 fish/hour) in the 2018 mid-June night electrofishing survey.

Post spawn electrofishing surveys generally catch greater numbers of smaller or younger Largemouth bass than previous electrofishing surveys conducting during the spawning season. Largemouth Bass also tend to be found near docks, downed trees in the water or within submergent vegetation adjacent to deep water during post spawn conditions versus shallow spawning bay areas often containing bulrush. Largemouth Bass growth rates were below average.

                "narrative": "<p>A standard survey was conducted on George Lake during late June of 2023. A nearshore fish survey was also conducted in July of 2023. A targeted survey is generally used for sampling a specific kind of fish or time of year (i.e. spawning season, fall season, etc.) unlike a standard survey which samples a wider range of fish species during the summer months using standard methodology (i.e. standard time of year, set sampling stations, taking water clarity readings and oxygen/temperature profiles, etc.) and gears (i.e. lake survey gillnets, trapnets and possibly spring electrofishing for Largemouth Bass). <br> \n <br> \nGeorge is a small (231 acres), moderately deep (34 feet maximum), and low to moderately productive lake located in Kandiyohi County. The shoreline is composed of primarily residential homes (99 homes), in addition to hardwood trees, a bible camp and adjacent wetland areas. The immediate watershed is composed of residential homes, hardwood trees, wetlands, grasslands and agricultural row crops. Agricultural row crop inputs into George Lake are minimal. There are three small inlets that drain into George and an outlet that connects to Nest Lake during high water. The Nest Lake connection may flow either way depending upon water levels in both lakes. Late ice out (late April-early May) occurred on area lakes in 2023. The water clarity was good on June 27, 2023 (secchi=12.2 feet). Dissolved oxygen levels were above 8.0 ppm down to 25 feet deep during the 2023 survey. Total phosphorus was low (0.013 ppm) in early June of 2013. Water levels were slightly below normal during the 2023 survey. Submergent vegetation species (muskgrass, various pondweeds, water moss, northern milfoil, bladderwort, and filamentous algae) are moderately abundant within the lake. Emergent vegetation is limited to small stands of hardstem bulrush along the northeast and southeast areas. Zebra Mussels were found in George during 2017. Shoalwater substrates consist mostly of sand, gravel, and rubble. George is a popular fishing lake for Bluegill, Black Crappie, Largemouth Bass and Northern Pike. Quality Sunfish Initiative \"QSI\" was recently enacted during 2021. Special regulations for several area lakes (Nest, Long, Diamond, George and Florida) including George Lake entail reduced bag limits (i.e., 5 or 10 fish) for Sunfish in five lakes and Crappie in one lake. Special regulations for George entail reduced bag limits of five fish for Sunfish and five fish for Crappie. These regulations are evaluated by special sampling in May with standard lake survey trapnets. The Bluegill and Black Crappie populations in George Lake were last sampled in May of 2021. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie abundance in 2023 (5.00 fish/gillnet) was above the 75th quartiles for George Lake (25th=0.80, 50th=2.00, 75th=4.00 fish/gillnet) and Lake Class 31 lakes (75th=3.50 fish/gillnet). The Black Crappie gillnet historical average catch rates are 5.77 fish/gillnet and 1.39 fish/trapnet. Low numbers of Black Crappie were caught in the 2023 trapnets (1.10 fish/trapnet). The 2023 Black Crappie average length was 7.47 inches from gillnets. The historical average length is 7.96 inches from gillnets. The Black Crappie average weights were 0.24 pounds and 0.27 pounds from 2023 gillnets and trapnets respectively. The 2023 Black Crappie catch rate of quality size (8.00 inches plus) was poor (1.33 fish/gillnet, 0.40 fish/trapnet). Black Crappie growth rates were below the Spicer Area 25th quartiles for ages 1-6. The 2019 year class comprised 77% of the 2023 Black Crappie catch. Black Crappie adults (1,344 fish, 336 pounds) were last stocked into George during 2010.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike abundance in 2023 (13.00 fish/gillnet) was above the 75th quartiles for George Lake (25th=1.80, 50th=5.20, 75th=7.20 fish/gillnet) and Lake Class 31 lakes (75th=10.50/gillnet. The historical average catch rate is 5.70 fish/gillnet. The 2023 Northern Pike average weight and length were 1.23 pounds and 16.52 inches from gillnets. The Northern Pike historical average weight is 2.68 pounds from gillnets. The 2023 Northern Pike catch rate of quality size (21.00 inches plus) Northern Pike was 2.00 fish/gillnet. The 2023 Northern Pike catch rate of preferred size (28.00 inches plus) was 0.67 fish/gillnet. Northern Pike possession limit regulations for George in the North-central Zone are as follows: anglers can keep 10 Northern Pike, but not more than two pike longer than 26.0 inches; and all from 22.0 to 26.0 inches must be released. Northern Pike taken by spearing follow the same rules except one pike may be between 22.0 and 26.0 inches or two larger than 26.0 inches. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch abundance in 2023 (0.00 fish/gillnet, 0.40 fish/trapnet) was low. The Yellow Perch historical average catch rates are 5.48 fish/gillnet and 0.56 fish/trapnet. The 2023 Yellow Perch average weight and length were 0.10 pounds and 6.04 inches from trapnets.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance in 2023 (2.67 fish/gillnet) was slightly above the 25th quartile for George Lake (25th=2.00, 50th=5.00, 75th=6.80 fish/gillnet) and near the 50th quartile (2.50 fish/gillnet) for Lake Class 31 lakes. The Walleye historical catch rate is 4.93 fish/gillnet for George. The 2023 Walleye average weight and length were 1.96 pounds and 17.96 inches from gillnets. The Walleye historical average weight and length were 1.60 pounds and 16.25 inches respectively from gillnets. The 2023 Walleye catch rate of quality size (15.00 inches plus) was 2.67 fish/gillnet. Walleye growth rates were near the Spicer Area 25th quartiles for ages 1-8. The 2022 and 2019 year classes comprised 33% and 27% respectively of the 2023 Walleye catch. Walleye (yearlings, adults, fingerlings) were stocked recently in 2010 (61 adult/yearlings, 58 pounds; 3,704 fingerlings, 347 pounds), 2012 (16,29 yearlings, 435 pounds), 2013 (221 yearlings, 96 pounds), 2014 (77 adults, 102 pounds; 1,412 yearlings, 321 pounds), 2016 (133 adults, 173 pounds; 326 yearlings, 151 pounds), 2017 (137 adults, 231 pounds; 614 yearlings, 144 pounds; 18 fingerlings, 2 pounds), 2019 (11 yearlings, 4 pounds; 3,445 fingerlings, 335 pounds), 2020 (36 adults, 72 pounds; 270 yearlings, 180 pounds), 2022 (2,775 fingerlings, 185 pounds) and 2023 (243 yearlings, 147 pounds; 60 fingerlings; 15 pounds; 70 adults, 112 pounds). <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass abundance was low (1.00 fish/gillnet) in the 2023 survey. The Largemouth Bass average weight and length were 1.02 pounds and 12.09 inches from 2023 gillnets. A boat electrofishing survey was not conducted for Largemouth Bass in 2023. Largemouth Bass (post spawn) numbers were abundant (58.86 fish/hour) in the previous 2018 mid-June night electrofishing survey. The 2018 Largemouth Bass average weight and length were 0.69 pounds and 10.55 inches from spring electrofishing. The 2018 catch rate of quality size (12.00 inches plus) Largemouth Bass was 18.86 fish/hour. The 2018 catch rate of preferred size (15.00 inches plus) Largemouth Bass was 0.00 fish/hour. Post spawn electrofishing surveys generally catch greater numbers of smaller or younger Largemouth bass than previous electrofishing surveys conducting during the spawning season. Largemouth Bass also tend to be found near docks, downed trees in the water or within submergent vegetation adjacent to deep water during post spawn conditions versus shallow spawning bay areas often containing bulrush.  <br> \n <br> \nBluegill abundance in 2023 (28.50 fish/trapnet) was near the 25th quartile for George Lake (25th=26.60, 50th=31.40, 75th=63.63 fish/trapnet) and above the 50th quartile (21.50 fish/trapnet) for Lake Class 31 lakes. The Bluegill historical average catch rate is 47.06 fish/trapnet for George Lake. The 2023 Bluegill gillnet catch rate was 14.00 fish/gillnet, which was above the historical average (9.55 fish/gillnet). The 2023 Bluegill average weight and length were 0.16 pounds and 5.76 inches from trapnets. The 2023 Bluegill average weight and length were 0.19 pounds and 6.06 inches from gillnets. The Bluegill historical average weights are 0.20 and 0.13 pounds from gillnets and trapnets respectively. The 2023 Bluegill catch rate of quality size (6.00 inches plus) (14.75 fish/trapnet) was above the historical average (9.34 fish/trapnet). The 2023 Bluegill catch rate of preferred size (8.00 inches plus) was low (0.10 fish/trapnet). Bluegill growth rates in George Lake were near or below the Spicer Area 25th quartiles for ages 1-8. The 2016 and 2018 year classes comprised 24% and 23% of the 2023 Bluegill catch.  <br> \n <br> \nPumpkinseed Sunfish abundance in 2023 (3.00 fish/trapnet) was at the 50th quartile for George (25th=2.17, 50th=3.00, 75th=4.20 fish/trapnet) but below the 50th quartile (4.17 fish/trapnet) for Lake Class 31 lakes. The 2023 Pumpkinseed Sunfish gillnet catch rate was 15.67 fish/gillnet. The Pumpkinseed Sunfish historical average catch rates are 3.20 fish/gillnet and 3.80 fish/trapnet for George. The 2023 Pumpkinseed Sunfish average weights were 0.20 and 0.25 pounds from gillnets and trapnets respectively. <br> \n <br> \nHybrid Sunfish abundance in 2023 (1.60 fish/trapnet) was below historical average (5.91 fish/trapnet). The 2023 Hybrid Sunfish average weight and length were 0.19 pounds and 5.84 inches from trapnets. The Hybrid Sunfish historical average weight and length are 0.18 pounds and 5.80 inches from trapnets. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Bullhead abundance in 2023 (2.33 fish/gillnet) was near the 75th quartile for George Lake (25th=0.44, 50th=1.40, 75th=2.40 fish/gillnet) and near the 50th quartile for Lake Class 31 lakes (50th=2.29 fish/gillnet). The Black Bullhead historical average catch rate is 1.86 fish/gillnet. Black Bullhead abundance was low in the 2023 trapnets (0.40 fish/trapnet). The 2023 Black Bullhead average length was 10.93 inches from gillnets and trapnets combined. The Black Bullhead historical average length is 11.56 inches from gillnets and trapnets combined. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Bullhead abundance in 2023 (21.00 fish/gillnet) was above the 75th quartiles for George (25th=0.60, 50th=3.00, 75th=7.00 fish/gillnet) and Lake Class 31 lakes (10.50 fish/gillnet). The Yellow Bullhead historical average catch rate is 5.44 fish/gillnet. The 2023 Yellow Bullhead average weight was 0.53 pounds from gillnets. The Yellow Bullhead historical average weight is 0.65 pounds from gillnets. <br> \n <br> \nA nearshore fish survey was also conducted from July 18-19, 2023. Seine hauls were conducted at 10 Fish-based Index of Biologic Integrity \"FIBI\" stations. Sampling stations site were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by either or both back-pack electrofishing and seining. Approximately 16 different fish species (13 species from back-pack electrofishing, and 15 species from seining) were captured from electrofishing and seining combined. Low species numbers of intolerant habitat disturbance (Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner and Iowa Darter) were captured in George Lake. Tolerant fish species captured included Black Bullhead and Green Sunfish. The nearshore data were combined with trap net and gill net data from a standard survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based IBI (FIBI) score. FIBI tool 4 was used for scoring and resulted in an FIBI score of 34 which is below the impairment threshold (38). <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore data were combined with trap net and gill net data from a June 2023 standard survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based IBI (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment. In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g. Blackchin Shiner, Iowa Darter, and Rock Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g. Green Sunfish). The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website. Data from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the North Fork Crow River Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.  <br> \n <br> \nCurrent fish management activities on George include monitoring the fish population on a periodic basis, protecting native aquatic vegetation through the permit process, preventing and educating about the spread of invasive species, participating in local watershed initiatives, and stocking various fish species as warranted. The George Lake fishery is scheduled for sampling in the 2028 spring and summer for all fish species. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of nearshore fish species in George Lake was conducted on June 21, 2018 by Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program Staff.  Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible.  Backpack electrofishing and a 50-foot seine were used to sample ten stations.  Nearshore sampling captured 17 species of fish including five species that are intolerant of disturbance (Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, and Pugnose Shiner) and one that is tolerant of disturbance (Green Sunfish). <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore data were combined with trap net and gill net data from a June 2018 standard survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based IBI (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment.  In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g. Blackchin Shiner, Iowa Darter, and Rock Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g. Green Sunfish).  The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake.  For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.   <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the North Fork Crow River Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A resurvey was conducted on George Lake in late June of 2004. George is a small (231 acres), moderately deep (34 feet maximum), and low productivity lake (total phosphorus=0.015 ppm) located in Kandiyohi County. The water clarity was excellent on June 14, 2004 (secchi=15.5 feet). Submergent vegetation (muskgrass, various pondweeds, water moss, coontail, northern milfoil, bladderwort, and filamentous algae) is moderate to abundant within the lake. Emergent vegetation is limited to a few small stands of hardstem bulrush. Hardstem bulrush was transplanted to an area along the northeast shore in 1994. The transplanted bulrush stand is still present, but has expanded only minimally from the transplant area. Shoalwater substrates consist mostly of sand, gravel, and rubble. The immediate watershed is small with hardwoods, wetlands, residential housing, agricultural row crops, and grasslands. There are three small inlets that flow into George Lake. Also, George Lake can connect to Nest Lake during high water periods via a tile that can act as an inlet or outlet depending on which lake has higher water levels. There are 98 homes and a bible camp located along the lakeshore. The DNR Spicer Fisheries Office manages George for largemouth bass, black crappie, bluegill, northern pike, and walleye. George Lake is a study lake for a DNR Research project (2001-2006) on walleye stocking. Largemouth bass numbers were abundant in the 2004 spring electrofishing survey (114.67 fish/hour) compared to the average catch rate from area lakes (47.22 fish/hour). The largemouth bass historical average catch rate is 60.21 fish/hour for George Lake. The 2004 largemouth bass average size was small (0.51 pounds and 9.75 inches) from spring electrofishing. The largest largemouth bass captured from the 2004 resurvey was 18.82 inches. Largemouth bass growth rates in George were below the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-8. The 2000 year class comprised 49% of the 2004 total largemouth bass spring electrofishing catch measured. Black crappie numbers were moderate in 2004 (2.30 fish/trapnet) compared to normal range for similar lakes. The black crappie trapnet historical average catch rate is 1.39 fish/trapnet for George Lake. The black crappie average size was moderate (0.33 pounds and 8.60 inches) from trapnets. The black crappie historical average weight is 0.27 pounds from trapnets. Black crappie growth rates in George were generally above the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-4. The 2002 black crappie year class comprised 39% of the 2004 black crappie resurvey catch. Black crappie adults (1,077 fish) were stocked into George during 2000. Northern pike numbers were moderate in 2004 (5.40 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes. The northern pike historical average catch rate is 2.80 fish/gillnet for George Lake. The 2004 northern pike average size was moderate (2.88 pounds and 22.90 inches) from gillnets. The northern pike historical average weight is 3.04 pounds from gillnets. The largest northern pike captured in the 2004 resurvey was 30.75 inches. The 2004 catch rate of northern pike 21.00 inches and larger was moderate (3.60 fish/gillnet). Northern pike growth rates in George were near or above the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-5. The 2002 northern pike year class comprised 45% of the 2004 northern pike resurvey catch. Yellow perch numbers were moderate in 2004 (7.80 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes. The yellow perch historical average catch rate is 8.14 fish/gillnet for George Lake. The 2004 yellow perch average size was moderate (0.15 pounds and 7.15 inches) from gillnets. The yellow perch historical average weight is 0.13 pounds. Yellow perch growth rates were below the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-5. The 1999 yellow perch year class comprised 49% of the 2004 yellow perch resurvey catch.Walleye numbers were low in 2004 (2.00 fish/gillnet) compared to the George Lake historical average (6.21 fish/gillnet), but within the normal range for similar lakes. The 2004 walleye average size was moderate (1.62 pounds and 15.50 inches) from gillnets. The walleye historical average weight was 1.21 pounds from gillnets. The largest walleye captured during the 2004 resurvey was 26.06 inches. Walleye growth rates in George were generally below the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-4, but above the normal ranges for ages 5-8. The 2000 walleye year class comprised 65% of the 2004 walleye resurvey catch from gillnets and trapnets. Walleye natural reproduction has generally been infrequent and insignificant in George Lake base on previous surveys.A 2004 spring electrofishing survey was conducted to evaluate a 2003 walleye fry stocking for a DNR Research study. Walleye fry were marked with oxytetracycline, then stocked as fingerlings in 2001 (112 pounds, 1,792 fish) and fry in 2003 (118,731 fish). No walleye were stocked in 2002. There were no walleye captured from the 2001 or 2003 stocked year classes in the 2004 spring electrofishing survey. There were low to moderate numbers of walleye captured (3.33 fish/hour, 13.71 inches average length) from the 2000 year class (6,826 fingerlings, 173 pounds stocked in 2000) in George during the 2004 spring electrofishing survey. The walleye fingerlings stocked in 2000 were unmarked. The dominant 2000 walleye year class present in the 2004 spring electrofishing and summer nets was probably due to stocking and not natural reproduction based on the lake history and limited walleye spawning habitat present within the lake.Bluegill numbers were moderate in 2004 (26.60 fish/trapnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes. The bluegill historical average catch rate is 59.65 fish/trapnet for George Lake. The 2004 bluegill average size was moderate to large (0.20 pounds and 6.34 inches) from trapnets. The bluegill historical average weight is 0.12 pounds from trapnets. The 2004 catch rate of bluegill 6.00 inches and larger was high (20.22 fish/trapnet). Bluegill growth rates in George Lake were below the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-6. The 1999 bluegill year class comprised 48% of the total bluegill catch in the 2004 resurvey catch.Black bullhead numbers were high in 2004 (7.40 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes and the historical average catch rate for George Lake (1.61 fish/gillnet historical average). The 2004 black bullhead average size was large (0.97 pounds and 11.36 inches) from gillnets. The black bullhead historical average weight is 0.85 pounds from gillnets.Current fish management activities on George include monitoring the fish population on a periodic basis, protecting aquatic vegetation through the permit process, participating in local watershed initiatives, and stocking various fish species as warranted. The George Lake fishery will be sampled in the 2006 summer for all fish species as part of the DNR Research walleye stocking study.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A population assessment was conducted on George Lake in late June of 2006. George is a small (231 acres), moderately deep (34 feet maximum), and low productivity lake (located in Kandiyohi County. The water clarity was good on June 26, 2006 (secchi=11.0 feet). Submergent vegetation (muskgrass, various pondweeds, water moss, coontail, northern milfoil, bladderwort, and filamentous algae) is moderate to abundant within the lake. Emergent vegetation is limited to a few small stands of hardstem bulrush. Shoalwater substrates consist mostly of sand, gravel, and rubble. The immediate watershed is small with hardwoods, wetlands, residential housing, agricultural row crops, and grasslands. There are three small inlets that flow into George Lake. The DNR Spicer Fisheries Office manages George for largemouth bass, black crappie, bluegill, northern pike, and walleye. George Lake is a study lake for a DNR Research project on walleye stocking.  <br> \n <br> \nBlack numbers were low to moderate in 2006 (1.60 fish/trapnet) based on the normal range for similar lakes. The black crappie trapnet historical average catch rate is 1.41 fish/trapnet. The black crappie average size was moderate (0.31 pounds and 8.30 inches from trapnets). The black crappie historical average weight is 0.27 pounds from trapnets. Black crappie growth rates in George were below the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-6. The 2003 black crappie year class comprised the majority of the 2006 black crappie population assessment catch. Black crappie adults (1,077 fish) were stocked into George during 2000.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike numbers were moderate to high in 2006 (7.20 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes. The northern pike historical average catch rate is 3.29 fish/gillnet. The 2006 northern pike average size was small (2.23 pounds and 20.05 inches from gillnets). The northern pike historical average weight is 2.95 pounds from gillnets. Northern pike growth rates in George were within the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-5. The 2004 and 2005 northern pike year classes comprised the majority of the 2006 northern pike population assessment catch.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch numbers were low in 2006 (2.00 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes. The yellow perch historical average catch rate is 7.46 fish/gillnet. The 2006 yellow perch average size was moderate (0.16 pounds and 7.18 inches from gillnets). The yellow perch historical average weight is 0.13 pounds. Yellow perch growth rates were generally within the Spicer Area normal ranges. The 2002 yellow perch year class comprised the majority of the 2006 yellow perch population assessment catch. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye numbers were low in 2006 (1.60 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes. The walleye historical catch rate is 5.70 fish/gillnet for George. The 2006 walleye average size was moderate to large (2.47 pounds and 18.06 inches from gillnets). The walleye historical average weight was 1.35 pounds from gillnets.  <br> \n <br> \nA 2006 spring electrofishing survey was conducted to evaluate a 2005 walleye fryling stocking for a DNR Research study. Walleye fry were marked with oxytetracycline, then stocked as fingerlings in 2001 (112 pounds, 1,792 fish), fry in 2003 (118,731 fish), and frylings in 2005 (17,593). No walleye were stocked in 2002 or 2004. There were no walleye captured from the 2005 year class in the 2006 spring electrofishing survey.  <br> \n <br> \nA spring electrofishing survey was not conducted for largemouth bass in 2006. Largemouth bass abundance was high (114.67 fish/hour) in the 2004 spring electrofishing survey compared to the average catch rate from area lakes (47.22 fish/hour). The largemouth bass historical average catch rate is 60.21 fish/hour for George Lake. The 2004 largemouth bass average size was small (0.51 pounds and 9.75 inches from the spring electrofishing). <br> \n <br> \nBluegill numbers were abundant in 2006 (41.60 fish/trapnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes. The bluegill historical average catch rate is 57.64 fish/trapnet for George Lake. The 2006 bluegill numbers were also abundant in gillnets (13.60 fish/gillnet). The 2006 bluegill average size was small (0.10 pounds and 4.75 inches) from trapnets, but large from gillnets (0.28 pounds). The bluegill historical average weight is 0.11 pounds from trapnets. The catch rate of quality size (6.00 inches) and larger bluegill was high (9.10 fish/trapnet) in 2006. Bluegill growth rates in George Lake were below the Spicer Area 25th normal ranges for ages 1-6. The 2003 bluegill year class comprised the majority of the total bluegill catch in the 2006 population assessment catch. <br> \n <br> \nBlack bullhead numbers were moderate in 2006 (3.80 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes. The 2006 black bullhead average size was large (1.10 pounds and 11.89 inches from gillnets). The black bullhead historical average weight is 0.88 pounds from gillnets. <br> \n <br> \nCurrent fish management activities on George include monitoring the fish population on a periodic basis, protecting aquatic vegetation through the permit process, participating in local watershed initiatives, and stocking various fish species as warranted. The George Lake fishery will be sampled in the 2008 spring and summer for all fish species as part of the DNR Research walleye stocking study. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>George is a small and moderately deep lake with good water quality and clarity. Thesecchi disk reading on June 21, 1999 was 10.0 feet. Submergent vegetation densities are thegreatest in the southwest bay. The shoreline is fully developed with residential homesexcluding the bible camp property along the northeast shore. Fishing pressure has beenrelatively low during recent years. Anglers generally seek walleye, northern pike, largemouthbass, or bluegill in George Lake. Walleye fingerlings were last stocked in 1998 (4,545 fish,582 lbs.). Black crappie were last stocked in 1996 (886 fish, 334 lbs.). Northern pike werelast stocked in 1995 (184 fish, 168 lbs.). George is a popular lake for boating and swimming.     Northern pike were present in moderate numbers (3.33 fish/gillnet) compared to thehistorical average (2.30 fish/gillnet), but with a large average size (24.84 inches,gillnets) in 1999. was below the normal range (3.50 - 10.50 fish/gillnet) for similar lakes,but above the historical average (2.30 fish/gillnet).  The 1999 northern pike average sizewas 24.84 inches (gillnets).     Walleye were also present in moderate numbers (5.00 fish/gillnet) in 1999 was within thenormal range (1.33 - 5.00 fish/gillnet) for similar lakes, The 1999 walleye average size wassmall (12.35 inches, gillnets), but this was due to the abundance of young walleye present.The 1998 walleye year class (stocked) comprised 50% of the total 1999 walleye catch.     Largemouth bass numbers were moderate (30.70 fish/hour) in the 1999 springelectrofishing survey. The 1999 largemouth bass average size was small (10.23 inches, springelectrofishing) and grow rates were slow.      Bluegill were overly abundant (149.40 fish/trapnet) in 1999. The 1999 bluegill averagesize was small (4.94 inches, trapnets) and growth rates were slow.      Black crappie numbers were low (2.67 fish/gillnet) in 1999 compared to the historicalaverage (8.53 fish/gillnet). The 1999 black crappie average size was moderate (8.17 inches,gillnets), but grow rates were slightly below average. The 1996 black crappie year classcomprised 58% of the total 1999 black crappie catch. The 1999 year class may have beenpartially or fully produced by stocked adult brood fish, but the contribution of these broodstock is unknown.      It appears that walleye fingerling stocking was successful for producing an adequatewalleye fishery in George. It is unclear the contribution of black crappie stocking in themid 1990's due to good black crappie natural reproduction success and survival in area lakesduring this same time period. The northern pike fishery was in good shape for both numbersand sizes. Bluegill and largemouth bass growth rates were slow. Bluegill removal may be amanagement option at increasing bluegill growth rates in George. The DNR Spicer FisheriesOffice will continue to monitor adult fish populations every four years by summer testnetting and spring electrofishing in order to evaluate the effectiveness of managementpractices.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A population assessment was conducted on George Lake in late June of 2008. George is a small (231 acres), moderately deep (34 feet maximum), and low to moderately productive lake located in Kandiyohi County. The water clarity was good on June 30, 2008 (secchi=11.0 feet). Dissolved oxygen levels were above 5.0 ppm down to 24 feet deep. Submergent vegetation (muskgrass, various pondweeds, water moss, coontail, northern milfoil, bladderwort, and filamentous algae) was moderate to abundant within the lake. Emergent vegetation is limited to a few small stands of hardstem bulrush. Shoalwater substrates consist mostly of sand, gravel, and rubble. The immediate watershed is small with hardwoods, wetlands, residential housing, agricultural row crops, and grasslands. There are three small inlets that flow into George Lake. The DNR Spicer Fisheries Office manages George primarily for largemouth bass, walleye, bluegill and secondarily for black crappie, yellow perch, and northern pike. George Lake was a study lake for a DNR Research project on walleye stocking.  <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie were not captured in the 2008 trapnets or gillnets. The black crappie historical average catch rates are 1.27 fish/trapnet and 6.17 fish/gillnet. The black crappie historical average weight is approximately 0.27 pounds from both gillnets and trapnets. Black crappie adults (1,077 fish, 336 pounds) were stocked into George during 2000.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike numbers were abundant in 2008 (11.20 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal ranges for George Lake (25th=1.20, 50th=3.92, 75th=5.35 fish/gillnet) and similar lakes. The northern pike historical average catch rate is 4.08 fish/gillnet. The 2008 northern pike average size was small (2.50 pounds and 21.59 inches) from gillnets. The northern pike historical average weight is 2.91 pounds from gillnets. The 2008 catch rate of quality size (21.00 inches) and larger northern pike was moderate (4.80 fish/gillnet). The 2008 catch rate of preferred size (28.00 inches) and larger northern pike was low to moderate (1.40 fish/gillnet). Northern pike growth rates in George were below the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-4 and within the normal ranges for ages 5-7. The 2004 northern pike year class comprised 37% of the 2008 northern pike population assessment catch.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch numbers were low in 2008 (0.40 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal ranges for George Lake (25th=2.65, 50th=5.50, 75th=10.50 fish/gillnet) and similar lakes. The yellow perch historical average catch rate is 6.76 fish/gillnet. The 2008 yellow perch average size was moderate (0.17 pounds and 6.99 inches) from gillnets. The yellow perch historical average weight is 0.14 pounds from gillnets.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye numbers were low in 2008 (0.60 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal ranges for George Lake (25th=1.70, 50th=5.60, 75th=6.80 fish/gillnet) and similar lakes. The walleye historical catch rate is 5.19 fish/gillnet for George. Low numbers of small walleye (7.23 inches average length, 2007 year class) were captured in the 2008 trapnets (0.50 fish/trapnet). The 2008 walleye average size was large (3.38 pounds and 20.13 inches) from gillnets. The walleye historical average weight was 1.55 pounds from gillnets. Walleye growth rates were generally above the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-6. <br> \n <br> \nA 2006 spring electrofishing survey was conducted to evaluate a 2005 walleye fryling stocking for a DNR Research study. Walleye fry were marked with oxytetracycline, then stocked as fingerlings in 2001 (112 pounds, 1,792 fish), fry in 2003 (118,731 fish), and frylings in 2005 (17,593). No walleye were stocked in 2002 or 2004. There were no walleye captured from the 2005 year class in the 2006 spring electrofishing survey. Unmarked walleye fingerlings (4,932 fish, 240 pounds) were stocked into George during the 2007 fall. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass were abundant (90.00 fish/hour) in the 2008 spring electrofishing survey compared to the Spicer Area average catch rate (47.78 fish/hour). The largemouth bass historical average catch rate is 66.17 fish/hour for George Lake. The 2008 largemouth bass average size was small (0.70 pounds and 10.60 inches) from spring electrofishing. The largemouth bass historical average weight and length are 0.69 pounds and 10.51 inches from spring electrofishing for George Lake. The 2008 catch rate of quality size (12.00 inches) and larger largemouth bass was moderate (13.95 fish/hour). The 2008 catch rate of preferred size (15.00 inches) and larger largemouth bass was low (1.40 fish/hour). Largemouth bass growth rates were below the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-8. The 2003 largemouth bass year class accounted for 43% of the 2008 spring electrofishing catch. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill numbers were moderate in 2008 (31.40 fish/trapnet) compared to the normal ranges for George Lake (25th=27.80, 50th=39.72, 75th=73.21 fish/trapnet) and similar lakes. The bluegill historical average catch rate is 55.02 fish/trapnet for George Lake. The 2008 bluegill gillnet catch rate (11.80 fish/gillnet) was slightly above the George Lake historical average (9.24 fish/gillnet). The 2008 bluegill average size was small (0.13 pounds and 5.14 inches) from trapnets, but moderate (0.22 pounds and 6.47 inches) from gillnets. The bluegill historical average weights are 0.15 and 0.12 pounds from gillnets and trapnets respectively. The catch rate of quality size (6.00 inches) and larger bluegill was moderate (11.44 fish/trapnet) in 2008. Bluegill growth rates in George Lake were below the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-5, but within the normal ranges for ages 6-8. The 2002 year class comprised 25% of the 2008 bluegill population assessment catch. The 2003 and 2005 year classes each comprised 21% of the 2008 bluegill catch.  <br> \n <br> \nPumpkinseed sunfish numbers were low to moderate in 2008 (2.60 fish/trapnet) compared to the normal ranges for George (25th=2.28, 50th=3.53, 75th=5.03 fish/trapnet) and similar lakes. The 2008 pumpkinseed sunfish gillnet catch rate was moderate (3.00 fish/gillnet). The historical average pumpkinseed sunfish catch rates are 1.40 fish/gillnet and 4.27 fish/trapnet for George. The 2008 pumpkinseed sunfish average weights were moderate (0.25 from gillnets and 0.19 pounds from trapnets). <br> \n <br> \nBlack bullhead numbers were moderate in 2008 (2.40 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes. The black bullhead historical average catch rate is 1.91 fish/gillnet for George. The 2008 black bullhead average size was large (0.96 pounds and 11.91 inches) from gillnets. The black bullhead historical average weight is 0.89 pounds from gillnets. <br> \n <br> \nYellow bullhead numbers were abundant to moderate in 2008 (4.40 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal ranges for George (25th=0.45, 50th=1.63, 75th=4.05 fish/gillnet) and similar lakes.

                "narrative": "<p>A resurvey was conducted on George Lake in late June of 2013. George is a small (231 acres), moderately deep (34 feet maximum), and low to moderately productive lake located in Kandiyohi County. The shoreline is composed of primarily residential homes (99 homes), in addition to hardwood trees, a bible camp and adjacent wetland areas. Agricultural row crop inputs into George Lake are minimal. There are three small inlets that drain into George and an outlet that connects to Nest Lake during high water. The Nest Lake connection may flow either way depending upon water levels in both lakes. Water levels were normal during the survey. The water clarity was good on June 25, 2013 (secchi=15.4 feet). Dissolved oxygen levels were above 5.0 ppm from the surface down to 27 feet deep. Total phosphorus was low (0.013 ppm) in early June of 2013. Submergent vegetation species (muskgrass, various pondweeds, water moss, northern milfoil, bladderwort, and filamentous algae) were moderately abundant within the lake. Emergent vegetation is limited to small stands of hardstem bulrush along the northeast and southeast areas. Shoalwater substrates consist mostly of sand, gravel, and rubble. George is a popular fishing lake for bluegill, black crappie, largemouth bass, walleye and northern pike.  <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie numbers were moderately abundant in 2013 (4.11 fish/trapnet). The black crappie trapnet historical average catch rate is 1.53 fish/trapnet. The black crappie historical average size was moderate (0.29 pounds, 7.90 inches) from trapnets. The 2013 catch rate of moderately large (>8.00 inches) black crappie was fair (1.44 fish/trapnet). Black crappie growth rates were below the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-4, but above the normal range for age 5. The 2010 year class comprised 60% of the 2013 black crappie catch. Black crappie adults (1,344 fish, 336 pounds) were last stocked into George during 2010.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike numbers were abundant in 2013 (15.00 fish/gillnet). The northern pike historical average catch rate is 5.07 fish/gillnet. The 2013 northern pike average size was small (2.45 pounds and 21.06 inches) from gillnets. The northern pike historical average weight is 2.86 pounds from gillnets. The 2013 catch rate of larger (>28 inches) northern pike was high (3.00 fish/gillnet). Northern pike growth rates in George were below the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-3 and within the normal ranges for ages 4-8. The 2011 and 2010 northern pike year classes comprised 35% and 33% of the 2013 northern pike catch.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch numbers were low in 2013 (3.00 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range of similar lakes. The yellow perch historical average catch rate is 6.41 fish/gillnet for George. The 2013 yellow perch average size was small to moderate (0.15 pounds and 6.54 inches) from gillnets. The yellow perch historical average weight is 0.14 pounds from gillnets. Yellow perch growth rates were near or below the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-6.   <br> \n <br> \nWalleye numbers were moderately abundant (5.50 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes in 2013. The walleye historical catch rate is 5.21 fish/gillnet for George. The 2013 walleye average size was moderate (1.47 pounds and 14.83 inches) and similar to the historical average (1.54 pounds and 14.73 inches) from gillnets. The 2013 catch rate of moderate sized (>15 inches) walleye was adequate (2.50 fish/gillnet). Walleye growth rates were within the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-7. The 2010 and 2011 year classes comprised 43% and 29% respectively of the 2013 walleye catch. Walleye (yearlings, adults, fingerlings) were stocked recently in 2013 (221 yearlings, 96 pounds), 2012 (1,629 yearlings, 435 pounds), and 2010(3,704 fingerlings, 347 pounds; 61 adult/yearlings, 58 pounds). <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass numbers were abundant (132.00 fish/hour) in the 2013 spring electrofishing survey. The largemouth bass historical average catch rate is 77.14 fish/hour for George. The 2013 largemouth bass average size was small (0.70 pounds and 10.73 inches), but similar to the historical average (0.70 pounds and 10.55 inches) from spring electrofishing. The 2013 catch rates of both moderately sized (16.76 fish/hour >12 inches) and larger (1.57 fish/hour >15 inches) largemouth bass were similar to historical averages. Largemouth bass growth rates were below the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-8. The 2009 largemouth bass year class accounted for 32% of the 2013 spring electrofishing catch. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill numbers were low (3.33 fish/trapnet), but the average size was large (0.29 pounds and 7.00 inches) in 2013 trapnets. The bluegill historical average catch rate is 50.32 fish/trapnet for George Lake. However, bluegill catch rates were more typical in deeper water gear sets (9.50 fish/gillnet) in 2013 compared to the historical average (9.26 fish/gillnet). Adult bluegills were not actively spawning or concentrated near shore as expected when the 2013 survey was conducted on George. The late/cold 2013 spring probably delayed or hindered spawning behavior/activity of adult bluegill, which resulted in poor catches from the near shore gear (trapnets). The bluegill historical average weights are 0.17 and 0.13 pounds from gillnets and trapnets respectively. Bluegill growth rates in George Lake were generally below the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-8. The 2005 year class comprised 38% of the 2013 bluegill catch.  <br> \n <br> \nOther sunfish species were present in moderate numbers (3.00 pumpkinseed sunfish/trapnet, 7.33 hybrid sunfish/trapnet) in 2013. The 2013 pumpkinseed sunfish (0.26 pounds) and hybrid sunfish (0.36 pounds) average weights were both large in George. <br> \n <br> \nBlack bullhead numbers were moderate in 2013 (2.50 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range of similar lakes. The black bullhead historical average catch rate is 1.96 fish/gillnet. The 2013 black bullhead average size was large (1.05 pounds and 11.35 inches) from gillnets.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow bullhead numbers were also moderate in 2013 (7.00 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range of similar lakes. The yellow bullhead historical average catch rate is 2.79 fish/gillnet. The 2013 yellow bullhead average weight was moderate (0.62 pounds) from gillnets.  <br> \n <br> \nCurrent fish management activities on George include monitoring the fish population on a periodic basis, protecting native aquatic vegetation through the permit process, preventing and educating about the spread of invasive species, participating in local watershed initiatives, and stocking various fish species as warranted. The George Lake fishery is scheduled for sampling in the 2018 spring and summer for all fish species. <br> \n</p>",
