They occupy a cold-water portion of the lake that is generally not utilized by the lake's cool and warmwater species like bluegill sunfish, largemouth bass, and northern pike.  The trout stocking strategy has been to provide trout that are readily caught by anglers (rainbows) and trout that are not as easily caught, but have the potential to reach trophy size (browns).Test nets in 2002 showed a continued increase in the number of northern pike per gill net and low numbers of cold-water species, including tullibees.  Northern pike catch per gill net increased from 6.8 in 1997 to 9.0 per net in 2002.  Along with the increase in number per gill net came a decline in average size from 3.3 pounds in 1997 to 1.5 pounds in 2002.  No brown trout were collected in 2002 test nets.  Ten rainbow trout and eight cisco were sampled.Other species present in Meadow Lake and sought by anglers include bluegill sunfish, largemouth bass, and black crappie.Aquatic vegetation (especially bulrushes and cattails) should be protected on this small lake.  Shoreland developers and landowners should use practices that preserve water quality, fish populations, and property values.</p>",

They occupy a cold water portion of the lake that is generally not inhabited by the lake's cool and warm water fish species like bluegill, largemouth bass, and northern pike.  The trout stocking strategy has been to provide trout that are readily caught by anglers (rainbows) and trout that are not as easily caught, but have the potential to reach trophy size (browns).Brown trout captured in test nets averaged 10.3 inches in length while rainbow trout averaged 12.3 inches.  No trout older than age three were captured, probably due to angler harvest.Northern pike were average in abundance compared to similar lakes and were fast growing.  The mean weight of sampled pike was 3.3 pounds.Bluegills were abundant, slow growing (stunted), and older than normal.  Largemouth bass were also relatively abundant while black crappie were not.Fish habitat (especially bulrushes and cattails) should be protected as much as possible on this small lake.  Shoreland development should consider best management practices to ensure good water quality, fish populations, and property values.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>In 1969 this lake was reclassified from bass-panfish to trout-bass panfish in anticipation of creating a two-story fishery.  Rainbow trout yearlings were stocked in 1970 and 1971 with little success.  Speculating that a high predator population had inhibited the success of the rainbows, spring trapnet removal of northern pike was initiated in 1987 in conjunction with a renewed trout stocking effort, both rainbow and brown trout were stocked.  Three years of spring trapnet removal (1987-1989) significantly lowered northern pike numbers, from 9.25/gillnet in 1987 to 0.75/gillnet in 1991.  A reduction in the number of predators has been only marginally helpful in establishing a trout population.  Annual trout stocking since 1987 has resulted in a gillnet catch of 0.50/set for rainbow trout and 1.00/set for brown trout in the current survey.  The reduced predator population appears to have significantly benefitted tullibees, the gillnet catch nearly doubled from the previous survey, from 38.75/set in 1987 to 68.00/set in 1991.  A dramatic and rather perplexing decline in centrarchid abundance apparently accompanied the reduction of large predators.  A bluegill trapnet catch of 92.00/set in 1987 declined to 22.25/set in the current survey.  Bluegills exhibit a slow growth rate.  Another enigma is the failure of yellow perch to increase significantly following northern pike reduction, a phenomenon that commonly occurs.  Yellow perch remain at very low levels.  One might theorize that the abundant tullibee population so effectively harvests zooplankton stocks that other plantivores (trout, sunfish, and yellow perch) are left with an inadequate forage base.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Although Meadow Lake has the capability of supporting both cold water and warm water fish species, it is no longer managed as a two-story fishery.  Both Rainbow and Brown Trout were stocked regularly from 1987 through 2009 with very limited success.  Meadow Lake functions naturally as a pike/bass/panfish lake.  Biennial Walleye fry stocking was initiated in 2010 in attempt to provide a modest fishery for this species, as well.  A few additional years of stocking are required to evaluate the success of the Walleye stocking, but early indications are that Walleye survival has been very poor and the lake remains best suited for Largemouth Bass, Bluegills, Black Crappies, and Northern Pike. <br> \n <br> \nTest nets in 2014 showed continued strong catch rates of Northern Pike and low catches of cold-water species  such as Tullibee and trout.  The Northern Pike catch per gill net was near the historic high at 11.0 per net in 2014.  The average pike weight was 1.8 pounds and length was 20.2 inches.  No Brown or Rainbow Trout were collected in 2014 test nets.  A few, large Cisco (Tullibee) were sampled once again. <br> \n <br> \nOther species present in Meadow Lake and sought by anglers include Bluegill, Largemouth Bass, and Black Crappie.  Bluegills are relatively abundant with a wide range of sizes present.  Bluegills over eight inches are not abundant, but can be found, and there are good numbers from seven to eight inches in length.  The Black Crappie sample was strong in numbers, but predominated by young, small fish.  A relatively strong 2012 year class may provide good crappie opportunities in the future.  Largemouth Bass catches were consistent with historical Meadow Lake catches and slightly higher than normal compared to other lakes of the same ecological classification. <br> \n <br> \nAquatic vegetation (especially bulrushes and cattails) should be protected on this small lake.  Shoreland developers and landowners should use practices that preserve water quality, fish populations, and property values.  Small lakes tend to be particularly vulnerable to development-related pressures and the eutrophication process.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Meadow Lake is somewhat of an anomaly amoung western Minnesota Lakes.  Since its thermocline is well-oxygenated, there is a band of water in the lake where temperatures are cool enough and dissolved oxygen levels are high enough to support trout even during the hottest Minnesota weather.  In order to provide an angling opportunity that is rather rare in this part of the state, Meadow Lake has been managed as a \"two-story\" lake since 1987.  Rainbow and brown trout yearlings are stocked annually.  They occupy a cold water portion of the lake that is generally not inhabited by the lake's cool and warm water species like bluegill, largemouth bass, and northern pike.  Hence, the term \"two-story\".  The idea behind stocking rainbow trout AND brown trout is to provide both trout that bite readily (rainbow) and trout that are not as easily caught, but have the potential to reach trophy size (browns).Fish populations are dynamic in all Minnesota lakes and Meadow Lake is no exception.  Even under the most stable conditions, fish community makeup fluctuates over time.  Obviously, the fish community was changed by the addition of trout and other fish stocking efforts.  However, not all changes to the fish populations in Meadow Lake are due to fish stocking or other fisheries management.  For instance, the initial lake survey report in 1959 listed only one cottage and five boats on the lake with no public access.  The 1984 lake survey reported two homes, a resort/campground with three cabins and 69 camper trailers, 41 boats and a public access.  Fortunately, fish spawning and cover habitat (cattail and bulrush beds) have not been as severely impacted in Meadow Lake as in many other lakes.  With the exception of the heavily developed southeast shore, where much emergent vegetation has been removed, Meadow Lake's shoal waters remain rimmed with hardstem bulrush and cattails.  These two aquatic \"weeds\" are not only valuable fish habitat,but are also home to waterfowl and other wildlife, as well as insects and invertebrates which are fish and wildlife food.  Aquatic plants help to maintain water quality by removing certain pollutants from the water and by reducing shoreline erosion due to wave action.Other than the addition of trout, the fish community makeup is similar to what it was in 1959, the initial survey year.  Individual fish species in the lake have experienced ups and downs since then, but abundances are roughly equivalent to what they were then.  One species of notable exception is tullibee (cisco).  Cisco began an unexplained increase in numbers during the eighties and abundance remains significantly higher than normal for this type of lake.  The presence of a large population of small cisco in the lake contributes to the relatively rapid growth rates for northern pike.  Another difference since 1959 concerns not the abundance, but the size of bluegill present.  As in most Minnesota lakes, bluegill are currently smaller in Meadow than they were forty years ago.  The 1959 sample found 89% of the sexually mature bluegills captured were between six and eight inches long.  Currently, only 26% of the bluegills sampled were of that size; most were smaller.Black crappie and largemouth bass abundances are within the \"normal\" range for similar lakes.  Although crappie are not particularly abundant in Meadow Lake and have only been considered \"above normal\" in abundance in one of six survey reports since 1959, the average size seems to be improving slightly.  Half of the crappie sampled in test nets in 1994 were longer than 10 inches.Few northern pike are present in Meadow Lake.  This is desirable for lakes stocked with stream trout.  However, the pike that are present in the lake are fast growing and tend to be larger than the pike collected in pre-nineties assessments.Test nets show catchable populations of both brown and rainbow trout.  All trout sampled were yearlings and it is unclear whether older, larger trout are not present or simply harder to catch with test nets.  Given the expense of creel surveys, voluntary angler feedback concerning trout fishing success on Meadow Lake is greatly appreciated.</p>",

They occupy a cold-water portion of the lake that is generally not utilized by the lake's cool and warmwater species like bluegill sunfish, largemouth bass, and northern pike.  The trout stocking strategy has been to provide trout that are readily caught by anglers (rainbows) and trout that are not as easily caught, but have the potential to reach trophy size (browns). <br> \n <br> \nTest nets in 2007 showed a continued increase in the number of northern pike per gill net and low numbers of cold-water species (tullibee, trout).  The northern pike catch per gill net increased from 9.0 per net in 2002 to a historic high of 12.3 per net in 2007.  The average pike weight was 2.6 pounds and length was 21.2 inches.  No brown trout or cisco (tullibee) were collected in 2007 test nets.  Nine rainbow trout were sampled. <br> \n <br> \nOther species present in Meadow Lake and sought by anglers include bluegill, largemouth bass, and black crappie. <br> \n <br> \nAquatic vegetation (especially bulrushes and cattails) should be protected on this small lake.  Shoreland developers and landowners should use practices that preserve water quality, fish populations, and property values.</p>",
