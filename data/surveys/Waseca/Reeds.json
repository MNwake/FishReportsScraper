The 30-inch minimum size limit was started in May 1998.  Many northern pike in St. Reeds Lake are marked with individually number tags as part of the assessment of the effectiveness of the 30-inch minimum size limit.  The yellow tags are located on the back of the fish adjacent to the dorsal fin.  Anglers who catch tagged northern pike and are able to read the tag number should contact the DNR Waterville Fisheries Office.  Bluegill are abundant although there tends to be many small fish, 3 to 6 inches long.  Both black and white crappie are common with the white crappie tending to be a bit bigger than the blacks.  Good largemouth bass angling is also available.  </p>",

Sampling stations were evenly spaced around the lake and backpack electrofishing was completed at 9 of 10 sampling stations, 2 of which were sampled from the boat due to site conditions. Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample 1 station, a 15-foot seine was used at 5 stations, and site conditions prevented the use of seines at 4 stations. Nearshore sampling captured 14 species of fish including 3 species that are intolerant of disturbance (Banded Killifish, Iowa Darter, and Least Darter) and one species that is tolerant of disturbance (Green Sunfish). <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey is combined with data from a standard game fish survey completed in June 2016 to calculate a Fish-based Index of Biological Integrity (FIBI) score that describes the overall health of the lake. The FIBI score for Reeds Lake from this survey is near an impairment threshold for aquatic life use developed for similar lakes. <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community as part of a process to assess the condition of surface waters of the Le Sueur River Watershed. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p> At this time, Reeds Lake supports a small, but viable population of northern pike comprised of a large proportion of mature, quality-sized individuals.  The population contains a moderate spawning stock, although reproduction and recruitment appear to be limited by lack of access to good spawning habitat.   The mature size and age structures suggest the population is at an apex and in a relatively unexploited state.  From a management standpoint, the population is likely producing at or near its full potential for size and abundance given the limitations of slow growth and poor reproductive and recruitment potential.  The implementation of the 30-inch minimum size limit appears to have contributed to a fishery for quality-sized pike with good opportunity to catch preferred-sized or larger individuals.  Since most fish do not achieve the minimum size limit, angler exploitation is likely very low.  Low abundance and relatively slow growth appears to be the greatest limit to the fishery potential of pike in Reeds Lake. <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nReeds Lake supports an extremely high bluegill density with a poor size distribution characteristic of a stunted population.  Although the high numbers provide good angling opportunity, the lack of quality-sized individuals limits the fishery potential of this species.  Both black and white crappie are present and large individuals are present.  Largemouth bass are common and provide good angling opportunity for this species. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Status of the Fishery <br> \nIntroduction <br> \nReeds Lake is a 193 acre lake located in Waseca County 2 miles east of the city of Elysian. Reeds Lake has a maximum depth of 58 feet and 110 acres of littoral area. A county-maintained public access is located on the southwest side of the lake. Reeds Lake has a small watershed with minimal agricultural run-off and is one of the clearest lakes in the Waterville Fisheries Management Area. Residential development surrounds much of the lake, but most of the riparian zone remains intact and aquatic vegetation is abundant, which provides valuable fish habitat. Reeds Lake is managed primarily for Northern Pike and Largemouth Bass and secondarily for Bluegill and crappie species.  The base stocking plan for Reeds Lake includes stocking Northern Pike fry annually into a nearby pond, which are removed each fall for stocking into Reeds Lake as fingerlings. All other fish species are the result of natural reproduction. <br> \n <br> \nReeds Lake is designated as an infested water due to the presence of Eurasian water-milfoil, which was first documented in the lake in 2014. Eurasian water-milfoil limits recreational activities by forming dense mats on the water surface and disrupts aquatic ecosystems by competing with and displacing native plants. Eurasian water-milfoil is spread primarily by the introduction of plant fragments, which can easily be transported by boaters. Always be sure to clean all aquatic plant material and drain all water from boats, trailers, and equipment before leaving the lake access. <br> \n <br> \nReeds Lake was surveyed the week of June 20, 2016 by the MN DNR as part of a regularly scheduled monitoring program. This survey included deploying 4 gill nets and 12 trap nets, as well as recording water quality parameters. Since Largemouth Bass are not effectively sampled in nets, electrofishing was conducted on May 24, 2016 to assess the Largemouth Bass population. Reeds Lake is scheduled to be surveyed again in 2022. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike <br> \nNorthern Pike were sampled in very high abundance in the 2016 survey. The gill net catch rate was 25.5 fish/net, which was above the long-term average for Reeds Lake (12.5 fish/net) and far above the catch rate of the previous survey in 2011 (4.6 fish/net). Pike were also sampled in trap nets at a rate of 1.4 fish/net. The size structure was generally small, with an average of 20.5 inches and a range of 16.1 to 29.7 inches. About 39% of the sample were 21 inches or longer. Ages ranged from 1 to 8 years old. Most (76%) of the aged fish were age-2, which suggested that the 2014 stocking effort was successful. The average length at capture was 16.1 inches at age-1, 19.5 inches at age-2, 19.7 inches at age-3, and 22.3 inches at age-4. Northern Pike fry are stocked into a nearby pond annually, which are collected as fingerlings and stocked in to Reeds Lake when available. Most recent stocking events took place in 2014 and 2015.  <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass <br> \nLargemouth Bass are not effectively sampled in traditional gears, like gill and trap net. As a result, targeted sampling using an electrofishing boat is required to assess the population. Electrofishing was conducted on May 24, 2016 to target and assess the Largemouth Bass population in Reeds Lake. The catch rate was 83.1 fish/hour, which was greater than the long-term average for Reeds Lake (44.2 fish/hour). Although in low abundance, Largemouth Bass were also sampled in gill nets and trap nets (1.8 and 0.6 fish/net, respectively). The size structure of Largemouth Bass was respectable, with total lengths ranging from 4.1 to 19.8 inches and averaging 10.5 inches. The abundant and diverse aquatic vegetation, woody debris along the shoreline, and relatively clear water in Reeds Lake provide ideal Largemouth Bass habitat. Largemouth Bass are not stocked in Reeds Lake, so the population persists through natural reproduction. Spring electrofishing surveys targeting Largemouth Bass will complement each Standard Survey that is completed on Reeds Lake (every six years). <br> \n <br> \nBluegill <br> \nBluegills were sampled in trap nets at a rate of 50.8 fish/net, which was lower than the long-term average for Reeds Lake (137.5 fish/net) and was the lowest catch rate on record. Bluegills were also sampled in gill nets at a rate of 22.3 fish/net, which was higher than the long-term average for Reeds Lake (11.6 fish/net). Bluegill lengths averaged 5.5 inches from trap nets and 6.8 inches from gill nets (5.7 inches, collectively). The largest individual that was sampled measured 8.0 inches, which suggested that the Reeds Lake Bluegill population exhibits a small size structure. Bluegill ages ranged from 1 to 11 years old. The oldest fish (11 year old) was only 8.0 inches long, which suggested a very slow growth rate. The average length at capture was 2.3 inches at age-1, 3.1 inches at age-2, 3.8 inches at age-3, 5.0 inches at age-4, 5.8 inches at age-5, 5.8 inches at age-6, 7.1 inches at age-7, 7.2 inches at age-8, and 7.0 inches at age-9. The Bluegill in Reeds Lake are the result of natural reproduction.  <br> \n <br> \nCrappie Species <br> \nReeds Lake produces 2 crappie species, the Black Crappie and the White Crappie. The 2 species of crappies look similar, but certain characteristics can tell them apart. Black Crappies are generally darker overall and typically have 7 or 8 dorsal spines. White Crappies have silver sides with light black vertical barring and typically has 5 or 6 dorsal spines. Black Crappies are more widely distributed throughout Minnesota and are typically found in deeper, clearer waters than White Crappies. Black Crappies were sampled in gill nets at a rate of 11.5 fish/net.  This catch rate was above the long-term average for Reeds Lake (9.4 fish/net). Black Crappies were also sampled in trap nets at a rate of 4.5 fish/net, which was slightly above the long-term average (4.0 fish/net). The lengths of Black Crappie from both gear types ranged from 4.6 to 13.0 inches and averaged 7.7 inches. This size structure was similar to that of the 2011 survey, when the overall average length was 8.2 inches. Black Crappies were aged using scales and otoliths. The average length at capture of Black Crappies was 5.3 inches at age-2, 7.5 inches at age-3, 6.6 inches at age-4, 8.2 inches at age-5, and 9.1 inches at age-6.  <br> \n <br> \nThe White Crappie gill net catch rate was 13.5 fish/net, which was above the long-term average for Reeds Lake (5.8 fish/net). White Crappies were sampled in trap nets in low abundance (0.4 fish/net). The size structure was small, with an average length of 6.5 inches. White Crappies were aged using scales and otoliths. The oldest individual was 5 years old and measured 11.6 inches. The average length at capture of White Crappies was 6.1 inches at age-2, 6.8 inches at age-3, and 11.3 inches at age-5. Neither of the crappie species are stocked in Reeds Lake.  <br> \n <br> \nOther Species <br> \nA total of 91 Yellow Bullheads were sampled in gill nets (12.8 fish/net) and trap nets (3.3 fish/net). The average length of Yellow Bullheads was 10.8 inches. Yellow Bullheads are typically found in lakes with higher water clarity, like Reeds Lake. Other fish species sampled in low abundance included hybrid sunfish, Pumpkinseed, Black Bullhead, Common Carp, Walleye, Yellow Perch, and White Sucker. <br> \n <br> \nAngling Summary <br> \nAt the time of the 2016 survey, Northern Pike were very abundant and should provide good angling. However, most of the Pike were generally small. Reeds Lake provides an excellent opportunity for Largemouth Bass angling. Bass numbers were high and the size structure was respectable in 2016. Although the size structures of panfish was small, anecdotal reports of very large crappies caught through the ice exist. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers can play an important role in maintaining or improving a fish population by practicing selective harvest. Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for consumption, while encouraging the release of medium to large fish that may contribute to natural reproduction. This practice helps maintain balance in the fish populations and provides anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future. Additionally, smaller fish often taste better and have fewer contaminants than larger, older fish from the same water body. <br> \n <br> \nShoreline property owners also play an important role in the overall health of an aquatic ecosystem, including the fish population. Natural shorelines, including vegetation, woody debris, and bottom substrates, provide valuable habitat for fish and wildlife, help maintain water quality, and reduce bank erosion. Cattails and bulrushes are particularly beneficial for fish spawning, rearing, and feeding. By leaving natural shorelines unaltered or restoring them to natural conditions, shoreline property owners are doing their part to maintain or improve a healthy ecosystem in the lake and protect the resource for future generations. <br> \n <br> \n-Kip Rounds, Fisheries Specialist <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Reeds Lake is a 193-acre lake located in Waseca County 2 miles east of the city of Elysian. Reeds Lake has a maximum depth of 58 feet. A county-maintained public access is located on the southwest side of the lake. Reeds Lake has a small watershed with minimal agricultural run-off and is one of the clearest lakes in the Waterville Fisheries Management Area. Residential development surrounds much of the lake, but most of the riparian zone remains intact and aquatic vegetation is abundant, which provides valuable fish habitat. Reeds Lake is managed primarily for Northern Pike and Largemouth Bass and secondarily for Bluegill and crappie species.  The base stocking plan for Reeds Lake includes stocking Northern Pike fry annually into a nearby pond, which are removed each fall for stocking into Reeds Lake as fingerlings. All other fish species are the result of natural reproduction. <br> \n <br> \nReeds Lake is designated as an infested water due to the presence of Eurasian water-milfoil, which was first documented in the lake in 2014. Eurasian water-milfoil limits recreational activities by forming dense mats on the water surface and disrupts aquatic ecosystems by competing with and displacing native plants. Eurasian water-milfoil is spread primarily by the introduction of plant fragments, which can easily be transported by boaters. Always be sure to clean all aquatic plant material and drain all water from boats, trailers, and equipment before leaving the lake access. <br> \n <br> \nReeds Lake was surveyed the week of June 13, 2022, by the MN DNR as part of a regularly scheduled monitoring program. A standard survey is used for sampling a wide range of fish species during the summer months using standard methods (i.e., standard time of year, set sampling stations, taking water clarity readings and oxygen/temperature profiles, etc.) and gears (i.e., lake survey gillnets, trap nets, and spring electrofishing for Largemouth Bass). This survey included deploying 4 gill nets and 12 trap nets, as well as recording water quality parameters. Since Largemouth Bass are not effectively sampled in nets, electrofishing was conducted on May 18, 2022, to assess the Largemouth Bass population. Reeds Lake is scheduled to be surveyed again in 2028. <br> \n <br> \nThe 2022 gill net catch rate for Northern Pike was 9.5 fish/net, which was below the long-term average for Reeds Lake (12.1 fish/net) and far below the catch rate of the previous survey in 2016 (25.5 fish/net). The size structure was moderate to small, with an average of 23.6 inches and a range of 18.8 to 38.2 inches. About 30% of the sample were of legal length (24 inches) or longer. Ages ranged from 1 to 9 years old. Most (58%) of the aged fish were age-4 or age-5. The most recent Northern Pike stocking events took place in 2019 and 2022.  <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass are not effectively sampled in traditional gears, like gill nets or trap nets. As a result, sampling using an electrofishing boat is required to assess the population. Electrofishing was conducted on May 18, 2022, to target and assess the Largemouth Bass population in Reeds Lake. The catch rate was 68.9 fish/hour, which was greater than the long-term average for Reeds Lake (50.3 fish/hour). The size structure of Largemouth Bass was respectable, with total lengths ranging from 4.1 to 18.0 inches and averaging 12.8 inches. Largemouth Bass ranged from 1 to 8 years old, with the 2019 year-class being the most abundant. Average length at age for age-1 was 2.8 inches, 5.0 inches at age-2, 8.8 inches at age-3, and 11.4 inches at age-4. The abundant and diverse aquatic vegetation, woody debris along the shoreline, and relatively clear water in Reeds Lake provide ideal Largemouth Bass habitat. Largemouth Bass are not stocked in Reeds Lake, so the population persists through natural reproduction. Spring electrofishing targeting Largemouth Bass will complement each Standard Survey that is completed on Reeds Lake (every six years). <br> \n <br> \nBluegills were sampled in trap nets at a rate of 122.4 fish/net, which was slightly lower than the long-term average for Reeds Lake (135.7 fish/net). This catch rate was well above the lake class third quartile (62.5 fish/net). Bluegill lengths averaged 6.1 inches. The largest individual that was sampled measured 9.0 inches, which suggests that the Reeds Lake Bluegill population exhibits a small size structure. Bluegill ages ranged from 2 to 9 years old. The oldest fish (9 years old) was only 8.0 inches long, which suggested a very slow growth rate. The Bluegill in Reeds Lake are the result of natural reproduction. The management plan goal for Reeds Lake is 50.0 to 100.0 fish/trap net, which was exceeded in 2022.  <br> \n <br> \nReeds Lake produces 2 crappie species, the Black Crappie and the White Crappie. Black Crappies were sampled in gill nets at a rate of 10.3 fish/net.  This catch rate was above the long-term average for Reeds Lake (9.5 fish/net). Black Crappies were also sampled in trap nets at a rate of 2.5 fish/net, which was below the long-term average (3.8 fish/net). Lengths of Black Crappie from both gear types ranged from 4.5 to 15.5 inches and averaged 7.0 inches. Black Crappies were aged using scales and otoliths, ages sampled were 2-5 and 13. The White Crappie gill net catch rate was 2.0 fish/net, which was below the long-term average for Reeds Lake (5.3 fish/net). White Crappies were not sampled in trap nets. The size structure was small, with an average length of 8.0 inches. The oldest individual was 8 years old and measured 13.2 inches. Neither of the crappie species are stocked in Reeds Lake.  <br> \n <br> \nIn 2016, a total of 91 Yellow Bullheads were sampled in gill nets (12.8 fish/net) and trap nets (3.3 fish/net). In 2022, 21 yellow bullheads were sampled (0.8/GN and 1.6/TN) The average length of Yellow Bullheads was 11.5 inches. Yellow Bullheads are typically found in lakes with higher water clarity, like Reeds Lake. Other fish species sampled in low abundance included hybrid sunfish, Pumpkinseed, Yellow Perch, and Golden Shiner.  <br> \n <br> \nWater quality measurements recorded in the 2022 survey included secchi depth, water temperature, and dissolved oxygen readings. The secchi depth reading was 8.0 feet. Water temperatures and dissolved oxygen readings throughout the water column ranged from 72.0 degrees Fahrenheit and 8.0 ppm at the surface to 57.9 degrees Fahrenheit and 0.1 ppm at 20.0 feet. The thermocline was established at about 12.0 feet below the surface. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers can play an important role in maintaining or improving a fish population by practicing selective harvest. Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for consumption, while encouraging the release of medium to large fish that may contribute to natural reproduction. This practice helps maintain balance in the fish populations and provides anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future. Additionally, smaller fish often taste better and have fewer contaminants than larger, older fish from the same water body. <br> \n <br> \nShoreline property owners also play an important role in the overall health of an aquatic ecosystem, including the fish population. Natural shorelines, including vegetation, woody debris, and bottom substrates, provide valuable habitat for fish and wildlife, help maintain water quality, and reduce bank erosion. Cattails and bulrushes are particularly beneficial for fish spawning, rearing, and feeding. By leaving natural shorelines unaltered or restoring them to natural conditions, shoreline property owners are doing their part to maintain or improve a healthy ecosystem in the lake and protect the resource for future generations. <br> \n <br> \n-Tyler Fellows, fisheries specialist <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Reeds Lake is a deep, clear, 193-acre lake located in Waseca County near the Town of Elysian.  Most of the shoreline and riparian zone around Reeds Lake has been modified for residential development, except for the eastern portion of the shoreline, which contains an extensive wetland.  Despite abundant residential development, water quality has remained good.  The 2006 survey indicated that Reeds Lake supports a diverse plant community.  The abundant aquatic vegetation provides important habitat for a variety of fish species.  A county-owned, concrete ramp located on the southern shore of the lake provides access for the public.  The sport fish community is dominated by bluegills, but also contains northern pike, black crappies, and largemouth bass.  Northern pike fingerlings were stocked in 2009 and northern pike fry were stocked in 2010.  The current management plan calls for northern pike fry to be stocked annually beginning in 2009.  Northern pike are stocked in Reeds Lake via a partnership with the Reeds Lake Sportsman's Club, where northern pike fry are stocked into Kaplan's Pond by the DNR and then the fingerlings are harvested by the Sportsman's Club and stocked into Reeds Lake during the summer and fall.  Reeds Lake was surveyed the week of 6-13-2011 to monitor the fish community.  <br> \n <br> \nSince 1996, catch rates of northern pike have ranged from 4.2/gill net to 7.8/gill net.  Catch rates in 2011 fell within this range, averaging 4.6/gill net, slightly above average for similar lakes.  Size structure of northern pike appears to have decreased from the 2006 survey.  In 2006, northern pike ranged from 22.5 to 31.9 inches in length and averaged 27.4 inches whereas in 2011 northern pike ranged from 17.8 to 31.9 inches in length and averaged 22.7 inches.  Mean weight of northern pike also decreased from 5.0 pounds in 2006 to 3.0 pounds in 2011. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill remain extremely abundant, with an average catch rate of 230.7/trap net in 2011.  Historically, bluegill catch rates have been high ranging from 58.7/trap net to 268.5/trap net.  Blue gill catch rates increased from 190.6/trap net in 2006 to 230.7/trap net in 2011.  Size structure of bluegills remained poor, with fish ranging from 3.6 to 7.1 inches in length and averaging 6.1 inches.  Approximately 93% of bluegills sampled were between 5.0 to 7.0 inches in length. <br> \n <br> \nSince 2002, black crappies have been low in abundance, with catch rates not exceeding 6.0/trap net.  The 2011 catch rate was similar at 4.0/trap net.  Black crappies ranged from 5.0 to 13.0 inches in length and averaged 7.8 inches, which was similar to what was observed in 2006.  White crappies were also sampled, but in low abundance (N=4).  <br> \n <br> \nYellow bullheads were sampled at a rate of 3.2/gill net and 2.9/trap net.  Yellow bullheads are typically found in clear lakes with abundant aquatic vegetation. <br> \n <br> \nOne channel catfish was collected.  Channel catfish have not been sampled in Reeds Lake prior to this survey.  Largemouth bass, common carp, black bullhead, walleye, pumpkinseed, and hybrid sunfish were present but occurred in low numbers.  <br> \n <br> \nAnglers can help maintain or improve the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for table fare, but encourages release of medium- to large-sized fish.  Releasing these fish can help maintain balance in the fish community in Reeds Lake and provide anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future.  <br> \n <br> \nShoreline areas on the land and into the shallow water provide essential habitat for fish and wildlife that live in or near Minnesota's lakes.  Overdeveloped shorelines cannot support the fish, wildlife, and clean water that are associated with natural undeveloped lakes.  Shoreline habitat consists of aquatic plants, woody plants, and natural lake bottom soils.  <br> \n <br> \nPlants in the water and at the water's edge provide habitat, prevent erosion, and absorb excess nutrients.  Shrubs, trees, and woody debris such as fallen trees or limbs provide good habitat both above and below the water and should be left in place.  By leaving a buffer strip of natural vegetation along the shoreline, property owners can reduce erosion, help maintain water quality, and provide habitat and travel corridors for wildlife. <br> \n</p>",
