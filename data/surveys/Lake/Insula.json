                "narrative": "<p>Insula Lake is in Ecological Lake Class 7, which consists of 41 lakes in northeast Minnesota that are very large, have very irregular shoreline shapes, and have very soft (unmineralized) water.  Insula Lake was thermally stratified on 07/09/2001 and retained 5 ppm oxygen to a depth of 19 ft, where the temperature was 60 F, and 2 ppm oxygen to within a foot of the bottom, where the temperature was 43 F.  Insula Lake has a number of inlets, with the Kawishiwi River, from Alice Lake, being the largest.  Most of the inlets and the outlet to Hudson Lake have no barriers to fish movement.  Lake bottom substrates along the shoreline are 55% boulder, 24% ledgerock, 10% rubble, 9% sand, and 2% muck.  Aquatic plants are sparse and grow to a depth of 8 ft; largeleaf pondweed, white and yellow waterlily, bulrush and spikerush are the most common plants.Fish sampling in the 2001 fish population assessment consisted of 12 gillnet sets.  Three previous investigations, dating back to 1950, used 4-20 gillnet sets.  Trapnets have not been used on this lake due to the difficult portage access.The total catch of fish (all species combined) in the gillnets in 2001 of 16.1 fish/net (21.1 lb/net) was in the first quartile for this lake class and was lower than the median catch of 28.3 fish/net (26.0 lb/net) in all investigations on this lake.  Fewer walleye and cisco were caught in 2001 than in most previous investigations.  Lake Class 7 is one of the most productive lake classes in northeast Minnesota, in terms of gillnet catches of fish.Walleye numbers in 2001 (2.4/gillnet) were in the first quartile for this lake class and were lower than the median catch of 8.9/gillnet in all investigations on this lake.  Walleye sizes in 2001 averaged 13.8\" (1.2 lb), which was in the third quartile for this lake class and was similar to walleye sizes in previous investigations on this lake.  The largest walleye captured in 2001 was 29.7\" (10.1 lb).  Walleye scales were difficult to read, but the growth of walleye captured in 2001 appeared to be slower than normal by area standards.  Walleye from seven year classes were present.Northern pike numbers in 2001 (2.6/gillnet) were in the third quartile for this lake class and were similar to the median catch of 3.4/gillnet in all investigations on this lake.  Pike sizes in 2001 averaged 24.0\" (3.8 lb) which was in the fourth quartile for this lake class and was larger than the average size of 21.5\" in all investigations on this lake.  The largest pike captured in 2001 was 37.6\" (14.1 lb).  Pike scales were difficult to read, but pike growth appeared to be somewhat faster than normal by area standards. Pike from eight year classes were present.Cisco numbers in 2001 (3.8/gillnet) were in the second quartile for this lake class and were lower than the median catch of 9.4/gillnet in all investigations on this lake.  Cisco sizes in 2001 averaged 6.9\" (0.1 lb), which was in the first quartile for this lake class and was smaller than the    average size of 8.1\" in all investigations on this lake.  The largest cisco captured in 2001 was 8.9\".White sucker numbers in 2001 (5.9/gillnet) were in the third quartile for this lake class and were similar to the median catch of 5.0/gillnet in all investigations on this lake.  Sucker sizes in 2001 averaged 13.8\" (1.3 lb) which was at the first quartile for this lake class and was similar to the average size of 14.0\" in all investigations on this lake.  Other fish species captured in 2001 were present in low numbers.   </p>",
