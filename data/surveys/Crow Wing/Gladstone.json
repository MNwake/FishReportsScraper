                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of the nearshore fish community was conducted in Gladstone Lake on July 17-18, 2018 by Fisheries Lake IBI program staff. Sampling stations were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at all 10 stations with two sites sampled from the boat. A 50-foot seine was used to sample eight stations, a 15-foot seine was used to sample one station, and one sampling station had conditions that prevented the use of seines. Nearshore sampling captured 19 native species of fish including five species that are intolerant of habitat disturbance (Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, and Pugnose Shiner) as well as one tolerant species (Green Sunfish).   <br> \n <br> \nData from this targeted nearshore survey is combined with data from standard gill and trap netting surveys to calculate a Fish-based Index of Biological Integrity (FIBI) that describes the overall health of the lake. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment.  The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. The FIBI score for Gladstone Lake based on this survey is well above the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes.  Data from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Crow Wing River Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.  <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

The same age classes comprised 67% of the 1986 sample.  Median length dropped two inches to 15 from 17. Growth was slow through age 2 but good thereafter.  The bluegill catch dropped from high abundance in 1986 (78.85/trapnet) to average in 1991 (26.71/trapnet). Size improved from small (0.06 lb in 1986) to average (0.20 lb in 1991).  Length range (3.0-8.9 inches) of measured fish remained the same as in 1986 but median rose to 6.0 inches.  Several year classes (3-6) were present in good numbers.  Growth was slow for all age classes.  Four age classes of largemouth bass were sampled in gillnets and trapnets. In addition, shoreline seining produced good numbers of young of year bass.  Black crappie (2.71/trapnet) were caught in average numbers for the lake class.  Size (0.21/ lb) became average for the lake class but was similar to 1986 (0.19 lb).  Five age classes were sampled and growth was good.  Walleye abundance (2.0/gillnet) remained in the average category despite a 240% increase since 1986 (0.83/gillnet). Three age classes were sampled and 60% were from the 1986 year class.  Average size rose from 2.06 lb in 1986 (average) to 3.69 lb (large) in 1991.  Yellow perch (6.0/gillnet) catch was similar to 1986 (3.5/gillnet) and was average for the lake class.  Sample lengths ranged from 5.0-10.9 inches in 1986 and size average 0.19 lb compared to 0.20 lb in 1986.  Both yellow bullhead (7.29/trapnet) and brown bullhead (0.71/trapnet) were present in average numbers. Both were also more readily caught in gillnets. Bullheads in the 12-13 inch classes were sampled mostly by gillnet.</p>",

Hybrid sunfish were taken (4.85/trapnet) at a rate considerably higher than the statewide median (0.40/trapnet). Black bullhead, brown bullhead, largemouth bass, black crappie, yellow perch and walleye catches indicated average size populations since these catches all fell between the first and third quartile of the range around the regional median for these species. Largemouth bass exhibited a catch rate between the first and third quartiles in gillnets and those fish were not taken in the trapnets. Yellow bullhead were taken (14.1/gillnet at a rate considerable higher than the local median of (1.70/gillnet). Northern pike aged (49 of 52 fish) showed age classes from 1-8. The fish grew at average rates at annulus 1-8, 86% of the catch of northern pike were in the 2-4 age classes. The northern pike population has increased through the years from 1948-86. The yellow perch population has decreased in population through the years from 1948-1986. The walleye population apparently has increased from 0.2 in 1981 to 0.83 in 1986. The largemouth bass indicated the presence of at least three age classes. Ages 5 and 6 were equally abundant (2 fish each). Black crappie average 0.26 lbs with a length frequency distribution from 4.0 to 9.9 inches. Ten of fourteen crappies measured 6.9 inches in length. Bluegill ranged in size from 3.2 to 7.9 inches.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Gladstone Lake is a 437 acre lake located in west-central Crow Wing County that is managed primarily for largemouth bass.  Standard survey nets do not sample bass well; therefore electrofishing is used to sample bass populations.  Largemouth bass were sampled at a rate of 94/hr when electrofishing was conducted on May 21, 2012.  The average length of these fish was 12\" while the largest fish measured 17.4\".  Nearly 43% were 12\" or larger. <br> \n <br> \nFor anglers who are looking for another aggressive fish to keep them busy in the boat there are ample numbers of northern pike.  Their catch rate was well above average at 18.2/ gill net.  The average size, however, tended to run on the small side, at 17.4\".  There were fish up to 35.7\" sampled during the survey, though only 9% were 24\" or greater.   Fishermen are encouraged to keep the smaller northern pike and release the larger ones to create a more desirable size distribution of northern pike. <br> \n <br> \nThe black crappie catch rate was 4.2/gill net, which is the historical high for Gladstone.  The average size was 7.1\" with just over 47% measuring 8\" or larger.  The bluegill catch rate was 23.3/trap net.  This is average for lakes with similar characteristics to Gladstone.  The average size was 5.4\" with the largest measuring 8.6\", however only 11% were 7\" or larger. <br> \n <br> \nSome other fish species sampled during the survey included bowfin (dogfish), brown bullhead, common carp, hybrid sunfish, pumpkinseed, rock bass, yellow bullhead, yellow perch, and a variety of minnow species. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Gladstone is roughly 400 acres in size and is located about three miles southeast of Nisswa.  Residential development is highest along the north and east sides and an average of 22.4 homes/shoreline mile were present in 1991 and 1996.  Maximum depth is about 36 feet and about 60% of the lake is shallower than 15 feet.  Shallow water soils are primarily sandy, with limited amounts of gravel, rubble sized rock and silt also present.  The aquatic plant community  is fairly diverse and includes important emergent species like bulrush and wild rice.  These beds of emergent plants provide important spawning habitat for fish species like bass, sunfish, crappies and perch.Compared to similar type lakes, northern pike and yellow bullheads were caught in \"high\" numbers in 1996, while black bullheads, bowfin (dogfish) and pumpkinseeds were caught in \"low\" numbers.  Northern pike numbers have been high for a number of years.  Average size was 17 inches long and 1.3 lbs. in 1996.  Pike growth remained good, however.  The walleye catch was in the \"average\" category and has been in the range of 0-2 fish/gillnet for several decades.  Largemouth bass were caught in \"average\" numbers in 1996, as well.  Bluegills were also caught in \"average\" numbers.  Their growth was slow but about 35% of trapnetted bluegills were at least 7.0 inches long, similar to the catch in 1991.  Black crappies were caught in \"average\" numbers and had good growth.  Only the 1994 year class was present in the trapnet sample, but crappies are generally known to have erratic spawning success and produce dominant year classes every few years.  Yellow perch provide a major food source for predators like pike, walleyes and bass.  The perch catch was in the average category in 1996 and several strong year classes were present.  Growth was good.</p>",

The northern pike catch rate in gill nets in 2006 was high compared to similar lake types.  Compared to historical net catches on Gladstone it was about average. The average size was 20.9 inches, and 23% were 24.0 inches or larger with fish up to 34.6 inches observed. Walleye were present in low numbers as they were in past surveys, with size in 2006 at least 19.0 inches. Black crappie was captured in low numbers, and size was usually small.  Bluegill numbers were good and fish as large as 8.9 inches were captured and 34.0% were at least 7.0 inches. The lake has a very high number of largemouth bass and fish up to 18.0 inches were sampled.   </p>",

Gladstone Lake is a reference lake for special panfish regulations (bag of 5 fish for each species) that is in effect on Goodrich Lake.  Only 2 black crappies were sampled in 2015, an 8.3\" and an 8.5\" fish.  Due to the weather and warmer water temperatures, the black crappies had most likely moved out from the shallows by the time the assessment had begun.  There were 171 bluegills sampled.  The average size was 7.0\" with fish up to 8.8\" sampled.  Just over 64 percent were at least 7\" while 11 percent were at least 8\".</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Gladstone is a 407 acre lake located in west central Crow Wing County.  Gladstone reaches depths of 36', with 60% of the lake less than 15' deep.  Emergent vegetation such as cattails and bulrush beds are located around the lake.    Protection of aquatic vegetation, especially emergent vegetation, is important for maintaining good water quality.  Aquatic vegetation is critical for fish spawning areas as well as providing habitat for fish and other aquatic life.  Water clarity was good with a Secchi disk reading of 14'. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass were sampled by a spring electrofishing survey at a rate 125.0/hr run time.  Average length was 12.9\", with 71% measuring at least 12\" in length.  Largemouth bass were sampled in high numbers in gill nets, when compared to similar lakes, at 1.9/net.  Average length was 13.4\". <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike were sampled in high numbers at 18.6/gill net.  Most were on the smaller side with an average length of 18.3\".  Fish over 24\" made up 12% of the catch.  Northerns up to 36.0\" were sampled.  Voluntary catch and release of these larger fish will help create a balanced population.  Lakes in this part of the state have a new northern pike regulation enacted in 2018: possession limit of 10 with not more than 2 over 26\".  All from 22\"-26\" must be immediately released.  Please refer to the current Minnesota Fishing Regulations for additional information. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappies were sampled in average numbers in both gill nets (1.9/net) and trap nets (1.0/net).  Average length was 7.5\" for gillnets and 7.6\" for trapnets.  For both gear types combined, 42% of black crappies measured at least 8\" in length.  Bluegills were also sampled in average numbers at 19.1/trap net.  Average length was 6.6\", with 38% measuring at least 7\" in length. <br> \n <br> \nNo invasive species have been discovered in Gladstone Lake, but they are located in the area.  Before and after launching lake users should inspect and remove any aquatic plants and animals from their watercraft and trailers as well as pull the plug and drain all water from the watercraft, including bilges, livewells and baitwells. <br> \n</p>",
