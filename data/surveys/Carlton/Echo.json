There is one MDNR administered boat access in the northeast bay of the lake off County Road 137.  Previous assessments or surveys have been conducted in 1993, 1991, 1985, 1977, 1972, and 1967.     Echo Lake is one of the best largemouth bass lakes in the Duluth area.  Electrofishing catch rates, from this assessment and from two previous assessments in 1993 and 1991, have been good.  Growth rates for largemouth bass are near the top for lakes in the Duluth area, and there is good age and size distribution in the catch.  The panfish fishery consists mainly of black crappie and bluegill.  Both are present in good numbers and have good growth rates for the Duluth area.  Both also have strong 1995 and 1994 year classes which should provide good fishing in the future.  Northern pike are present in good numbers and growth rates are typical.  Yellow perch catch rates were typical but have fluctuated greatly in the previous assessments and surveys.  However, relatively few have ever attained \"keeper\" size.  Yellow perch may primarily be important as a prey item in Echo Lake.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Echo Lake is a 104.5-acre lake with 19.3 (18%) acres of littoral area and a maximum depth of 47 feet. The lake is located partially within Moose Lake State Park, east of Moose Lake, MN and has one MNDNR-owned concrete access on the northeast side of the lake. Echo Lake is managed as primarily a largemouth bass fishery.  Echo Lake was last assessed in 2003.  Echo Lake was assessed during the summer of 2011 to update information about fish populations.  <br> \n <br> \nA total of 107 largemouth bass were sampled with electrofishing equipment.  The catch rate of largemouth bass was 136.4 fish per hour of electrofishing on-time.  Previous electrofishing catch rates for largemouth bass on Echo have ranged from 36.2 in 1993 to 116.0 in 1991.  Largemouth bass average length was 12.3 inches and growth was average compared to other Duluth Area lakes.  All year-classes from 2002 through 2009 were represented in the sample.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike abundance of 5.5 per gillnet lift was up from 2003 (4.8) and average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Northern pike average length was 21.0 inches and growth was average compared to other Duluth Area lakes.  All year-classes from 2005 to 2009 were represented.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie abundance of 1.0 per trapnet lift was up from 2003 (0.4) and was average when compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Black crappie mean length was 7.6 inches but not enough individuals were captured to evaluate stock density or growth.  Recruitment is sporadic with three year classes absent from 2003 through 2010. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill abundance of 3.7 per trapnet lift was up from 2003 (5.3) and was below average when compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Average length of sampled bluegills was 5.1 inches and growth was slow compared to other Duluth Area lakes.  All year-classes from 2001 through 2007 were represented. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch abundance of 0.0 per gillnet lift was down from 2003 (1.0) and was below average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Yellow perch catch has been steadily declining since 1990 when 6.3 per lift were observed.  No yellow perch were captured in any other gears during the assessment. <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species sampled include brown and yellow bullhead, Iowa darter, Johnny darter, blackchin shiner, golden shiner, northern redbelly dace, rock bass, tadpole madtom, bluntnose minnow, fathead minnow, central mudminnow and pumpkinseed.    <br> \n <br> \nEcho Lake was included in an index of biotic integrity (IBI) assessment in 2011.  In addition to standard gillnets and trapnets, beach seines and backpack electrofishing equipment were used to index species richness of the nearshore lake habitat.</p>",

The lake is located partially within Moose Lake State Park, east of Moose Lake, MN and has a MN DNR owned concrete access on the northeast side of the lake.  Echo Lake is managed as primarily a Largemouth Bass fishery, and was last assessed in 2011.  Echo Lake was surveyed during the summer of 2021 to update information about fish populations.  <br> \n <br> \nA total of 93 Largemouth Bass were sampled with electrofishing equipment.  The catch rate of Largemouth Bass was 61.2 fish per hour of electrofishing on-time.  Largemouth Bass average length was 13.0 inches and growth was average compared to other Duluth Area lakes.  The proportion of adult Largemouth Bass that exceeded quality size (greater than 12 inches) was 82%, while the proportion that exceeded preferred size (greater than 15 inches) was 33%.  The 2015 year-class was very strong, and other younger cohorts observed will continue to provide strong catch rates for anglers into the future at Echo Lake.  Some very old Largemouth Bass were observed with a maximum age of 28 years old.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike abundance of 3.5 per gillnet lift was down from 2011 (5.5) and was average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Northern Pike average length was 21.5 inches and growth was average compared to other Duluth Area lakes. The proportion of adult Northern Pike that exceeded quality size (greater than 21 inches) was 60%, while the proportion that exceeded preferred size (greater than 28 inches) was 5%.    <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie abundance of 2.7 per gillnet lift was up from 2011 (0.5) and was average when compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Black Crappie mean length was 7.1 inches.  The proportion of adult Black Crappie that exceeded quality size (greater than 8 inches) was 20%, while the proportion that exceeded preferred size (greater than 10 inches) was 13%.   One large specimen over 13 inches long was captured. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill abundance of 5.0 per trapnet lift was up from 2011 (3.7) and was below average when compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Average length of sampled Bluegills was 5.0 inches and growth was slow compared to other Duluth Area lakes.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch were scarce and catch has remained low for the last several investigations.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Echo Lake is a 104.5 acre lake with 19.3 (18%) acres of littoral area and a maximum depth of 47 feet.  The lake is located partially within Moose Lake State Park, east of Moose Lake, MN and has one MNDNR-owned concrete access on the northeast side of the lake.  Previous population assessments have occurred in 1972, 1977 and 1985; special assessments in 1967, 1991 and 1993; and lake surveys in 1990 and 1998.  Echo Lake is managed as primarily a largemouth bass fishery.    Largemouth bass abundance from spring electrofishing was average (46.4 fish/hr on-time) for Duluth Area lakes.  The mean length of fish captured was 12.9 inches. Growth was average for Duluth Area lakes.  Multiple age classes were sampled during the assessment with 45% of the fish being age 5 or 6.    Northern pike abundance was 4.8 fish/gillnet which was average for Minnesota lakes of similar type.  The mean length of fish captured was 21.7 inches.  Growth of age 4 fish were average for Duluth Area lakes.  Multiple age classes with strong year classes in 1999 and 2000 were present.  Bluegill abundance was 5.3 fish/trapnet which was below average for Minnesota lakes of similar type.  The mean length of fish captured was average at 5.8 inches.  Growth of age 4 fish was below average with the mean length of fish at 4.2 inches.  Sixty-two percent (28 out of 46) fish aged were from the 1998 and 1999 year classes.  Black crappie abundance was 0.4 fish/trapnet.  Yellow perch abundance was 1.0 fish/gillnet.  Both species abundances were below average for Minnesota lakes of similar type.    Other species sampled were brown bullhead, golden shiner and pumpkinseed.  Spring electrofishing assessments in 1991, 1993, 1998 and 2003 indicate that largemouth bass abundance was average to above average for Duluth Area lakes.       The trend in summer assessment catch for northern pike, bluegill, yellow perch and black crappie showed that catch rates have declined over the last three assessments (1990, 1998, 2003).     </p>",
