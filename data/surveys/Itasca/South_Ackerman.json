                "narrative": "<p>South Ackerman lake is a small (23 acre) lake surrounded by a bog and fringed with water lilies.  The lake has relatively clear water with a secchi disk reading of 11.0 ft,  and a maximum depth of about 50 feet.  The dissolved oxygen levels were adequate for game fish down to 18 feet of water.  This lake is primarily a northern pike/largemouth bass/panfish lake.  Nine trap net stations were established that captured fish moving among the water lilies near the edge of the bog, while three gill-net stations sampled the open water area which had suitable dissolved  oxygen levels.      Twenty three northern pike were sampled in the gill nets which yielded a catch rate of 7.7 fish/net which is near the upper end of the expected range for similar lakes.  Most northern pike were small as the mean length was 19.4 inches.  Ageing reveled that most northern pike caught were either age-3 or age-4.  Northern pike growth was less than 85% of the statewide average for  ages-1 and 2, but attained lengths within 85%-115% of the statewide averages for ages-3 and older.     Bluegills were the most abundant species in the trap nets with a catch rate of 28.9 fish/set which is within the expected range for similar lakes.  Although most bluegills were small, a few fish over 8 inches were sampled.  Bluegills up to age-9 were sampled and growth rates  for each age class (1-9) were within  the 85%-115%  range of the statewide averages.          Black crappies were also sampled for a catch rate of 1.0 fish per gill net and 2.4 fish per trap net . These catches are within the respective expected ranges for each gear type.  The trap-net catch had a mean length of 7.9 inches and 66% were age-4  fish. Black crappie up to age-7 were sampled and the growth rates for each year class were within the 85%-115% range of the statewide averages.    Largemouth bass were frequently spotted among the floating leaf plant community but only 6 individuals were caught  in either trap nets or gill nets.  Ageing indicated that growth is below the 85%-115% range of statewide averages for ages1-3, but was within this range for ages 3-7.       Pumpkinseed sunfish were also frequently captured in trap nets and their catch rate of 4.9 fish/net is within the expected range of similar lakes.  They averaged 6.2 inches in length with a few fish exceeding 8 inches.     Eighteen small yellow perch, with an average length of 6 inches, were also caught in gill nets at a rate of 6.0 fish/net.  </p>",
