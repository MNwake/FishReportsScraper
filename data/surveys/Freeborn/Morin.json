                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey was conducted at Morin Lake on September 14th, 2017 to assess the fish community. A targeted survey is generally used for sampling a specific kind of fish or time of year (i.e. spawning season, fall season, etc.) unlike a standard survey which samples a wider range of fish species during the summer months using standard methods (i.e. standard time of year, set sampling stations, taking water clarity readings and oxygen/temperature profiles, etc.) and gears (i.e. lake survey gillnets, trap nets, and spring electrofishing for Largemouth Bass). This survey consisted of four trap nets set for 24 hours. Results from this targeted survey should not be compared to results from standard surveys. <br> \n <br> \nThe current management plan calls for Morin Lake to be managed as a put-and-take fishery similar to an urban kid's fishing pond, rather than as a stable fishery. Walleye will no longer be stocked as fingerlings and will only be stocked as adult fish. In the spring of 2017, 40 adult Northern Pike, 15 adult Largemouth Bass, and 40 adult Black Crappies were stocked. Also, in the fall of 2017, 55 adult Channel Catfish were stocked in Morin Lake to provide an angling opportunity and hopefully provide predation on the abundant Black Bullhead population. Management species will be stocked following winterkill events or as needed and available. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Bullheads were the primary species sampled. Trap nets sampled 1,741 Black Bullheads for a catch rate of 435.3/trap net. Black Bullheads averaged 5.6 inches total length and ranged from 4.2 inches to 9.1 inches. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie and Bluegill were the only other species sampled in moderate numbers.  Black Crappie catch rate was 8.8/trap net. Black Crappies were generally small - averaging 7.6 inches total length and ranging from 4.8 inches to 11.8 inches. Bluegill catch rate was 10.0/trap net. Bluegill were also generally small - averaging 5.4 inches total length and ranging from 4.2 inches to 8.0 inches. Management goals call for 20-40 Black Crappie per trap net and 40-80 Bluegills per trap net. Management goals were not met during the 2017 targeted survey. <br> \n <br> \nOnly one Walleye was sampled in 2017, however trap nets are not an effective gear for sampling Walleye and the population may be greater than indicated by trap netting. The Walleye sampled measured 16.8 inches total length. <br> \n <br> \nNine Yellow Bullhead and one Yellow Perch were also sampled during the survey. <br> \n <br> \n-Brandon Eder, assistant area supervisor <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A population assessment was completed on Morin Lake, Freeborn County the first week of July in 2003.  This assessment is a follow-up to the one completed in the summer of 2000 to monitor the changes in the fish populations after a winterkill took place in the winter of 1998-99.  The lake was sampled with 6 standard trap nets set at traditional locations throughout Morin Lake.  The entire shoreline was also electrofished with a boat boomshocker on September 15, 2003 to sample the largemouth bass and walleye populations.  A dissolved oxygen profile, temperature profile and secchi disc reading were also completed on July 7, 2003.  No shoreline seining was done during the 2003 assessment.  Scale samples were taken from all species of game fish and used to determine age and growth rates.     The black crappie population has continued to expand in Morin Lake following the winterkill in 1998-99.  The crappie abundance is currently over twice the average of the 75% quartile for lakes of this class and size structure has improved dramatically since 2000.  During the 2000 assessment only 8% of the population (n-6) were over 8 inches in total length, currrently 15% of the fish (n-57) that were captured in trap nets were greater than 8 inches long.  Four crappies were over 12 inches long with the largest fish measuring 13.6 inches in length and weighing 1.24 pounds.  This species currently represents the bulk of sport angling opportunites in Morin Lake, as the only other species of game fish present (bluegills & perch) lack the necessary size structure to be acceptable to anglers.  Fish less than 6 inches in length currently dominates the bluegill population; only 6% of the fish (n-6) were greater than 6 inches long.     The populations of largemouth bass and walleyes have all but disappeared since 1998.  Six walleyes and no bass were seen during the 2000 assessments; neither species was represented in the trap nets or the electrofishing sample in 2003 even though walleyes have been stocked twice (2001 & 1999) since the winterkill.  Largemouth bass have not been sampled in Morin Lake since 1997, even then only 3 fish were seen between the electrofishing stations and the trap net sets.  Bass have not been stocked in Morin Lake since 1993, apparently the few remaining brood stock have been wiped out by the winterkill in 1998-99.     The fish community in Morin Lake continues to be dominated in number and weight by \"rough\" fishes, as it was in 2000.  Collectively the rough fish contributed 84% of the total catch from all the nets in 2003.  By far the most dominate of these species is the black bulhead which comprises 73% of the catch, followed by green sunfish , hybrid sunfish, and finally common carp.  The 2000 assessment was very similar in proportion with the rough fish comprising 92% of the total catch.  In comparison the 1997 assessment found only 44% of the total fish captured to be rough fish.  </p>",

This assessment was done due to the fish kill which occurred in the lake during the winter of 1998-1999.  The only gamefish species we found was walleye and only six in total were captured in the trap-nets (4 fish) and with electrofishing (2 fish).  No largemouth bass were observed in this survey and this species has probably been eliminated from the lake due to a combination ofangler harvest, reproductive failures and winterkill.  Other signs of winterkill include the predominance of green sunfish and black bullheads in the fish community, comprising no less than 87 percent of the total net catch, and the presence of a large number of green sunfish-bluegill hybrids.  Bluegill are also fewer in numbers than in the past and their growth rate is poor.  The black crappie population is rapidly expanding, although there are few fish over eight inches in length.  White crappie and carp were observed for the first time ever in the trap-net samples.The fish community is currently unbalanced, with too few gamefish and a large number of rough fishes, and there are few sport angling opportunities.</p>",

The lake is especially well suited for young anglers, as fish densities are high and shore fishing access exists around much of the lake.  The lake supports high densities of black crappie and black bullhead.  Although the average size was small with at least some fish of desirable size are present.  Walleye were also present in low numbers but were typically large.  Blugill, green sunfish, yellow perch, and common carp were also present, providing good anger opportunity.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A fish population assessment of Morin Lake was conducted in 1997.  This assessment consisted of trap-netting seven shoreline areas on July 14 and 15.  In addition, the lake was surveyed using an electrofishing boat on September 4.  This survey was scheduled to update an existing DNR lake management plan (1994).The annual walleye stocking program has been successful in terms of providing an adult stock composed of several age groups.  Though overall abundance has been declining steadily since 1990, the walleye population is relatively high for this type of lake.  Growth rates of walleye are higher than statewide averages for most of the adult year-classes.  Walleyes do not naturally reproduce in Morin Lake and their continued presence in the lake is dependent upon the stocking program.  Because of this, walleyes will never be very abundant in Morin Lake.  However, walleyes have the potential to reach desirable sizes very quickly due to favorable growing conditions.  The largest walleye sampled in 1997 was 23.4 inches long and it weighed 2.15 pounds.Only three largemouth bass were captured during this assessment.  Bass do not trap well in nets and the electrofishing survey probably would have caught more fish if it had been conducted at night.  Thick weed beds also reduced our ability to see and capture bass.  The largest bass captured was 18.3 inches long and weighed just under four pounds.Bluegills are once again very abundant in Morin Lake.  However, they are now smaller on average, since they are now reproducing very rapidly in the lake.  The average size caught in the trap nets was only 5.5 inches, but individual fish exceeding eight inches are still present in the lake.  Bluegill growth rates are higher than statewide averages. Black crappies are also present in Morin Lake, however, they remain at a very low abundance.  Like bluegills, their rate of growth is above the statewide average for black crappie.Numbers and size of black bullheads are continuing to decline in the lake.  Bullheads can reach desirable sizes of nine inches and larger in Morin Lake, and they will always be present due to unathorized stocking.A lake aeration system installed and operated by the City of Alden and approved vegetation management plan have improved fishing opportunities in Morin Lake.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Morin Lake is a small 21.0 acre lake located in Freeborn County in the town of Alden. Morin Lake provides ample opportunity for anglers, as much of the shoreline is accessible to the public. Morin Lake reaches a maximum depth of 5 feet and much of the substrate is composed of silt. Water quality in Morin Lake was poor with a secchi depth of less than 1 foot and the water color brown/green. A dissolved oxygen profile was taken and ranged from 5.0 ppm at the surface to 2.9 ppm at 4.0 feet. The game fish community at Morin Lake is limited to black crappie, bluegill, and walleye. Walleye fingerlings, yearlings, or adults are stocked annually (2003, 2006-2011). A population assessment was conducted on 8-13-2012 to monitor the fish community of Morin Lake using 6 trap nets.  <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappies were the most abundant species captured at 109.2/trap net, which is the highest catch rate recorded for this water body and is high when compared to similar lakes. Historical catch rates have ranged from 0.2/trap net in 1992 to 105.7/trap net in 2007. The high density black crappie population is small, ranging in length from 5.8 to 8.5 inches and averaging 7.2 inches. Ninety percent of black crappies captured were less than 8.0 inches long.  <br> \n <br> \nBluegill catch rates increased ten-fold since the 2007 survey and were captured at a rate of 32.2/trap net which is average when compared to similar lakes. Bluegill catch rates have been highly variable since monitoring began in 1987, ranging from 1.4/trap net in 2000 to 67.3/trap net in 1997. Size structure of the bluegill population was also small with 80% of the bluegills being less than 6.0 inches long. The largest bluegill captured was 6.8 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nAlthough stocked annually, only 3 walleyes were captured in the trap nets (0.5/trap net). Walleyes captured were large measuring 25.8 to 26.3 inches and averaging 26.0 inches. Otoliths were not collected because the fish were released; therefore, it is unknown which stocking they originated from. A few smaller walleyes (approximately 9-10 inches) were observed during the electrofishing survey done on 5-15-12; however these fish were not observed in the trap nets. <br> \n <br> \nBlack bullheads have historically been abundant in Morin Lake; however, the trap net catch rate has decreased from 381.5/trap net in 2003, to 134.8/trap net in 2007, to 54.8/trap net in 2012.. The black bullheads were small ranging in length from 3.2 to 8.7 inches and averaging 7.2 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nMorin Lake was electrofished on 5-15-2012 to monitor the largemouth bass population. No largemouth bass were collected during the survey.  <br> \n <br> \nOne yellow bullhead was captured, which is the first time this species has been observed in Morin Lake. Green sunfish were abundant and were captured at a rate of 33.2/trap net, but were all less than 5.5 inches in length. Hybrid sunfish, white crappie, and yellow perch were also present but occurred in low numbers.  <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

AT LEAST FIVE AGE CLASSES OF BLG HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED IN MORIN LAKE DUE, IN PART, TO ANNUAL STOCKING OF CULLED MALE BLG SINCE 1986.  DESPITE ANNUAL PLANTING OF WAE FINGERLINGS FROM 1986 TO 1992, ONLY THREE AGE-CLASSESS OF WAE WERE DETECTED. THIS MAY BE A RESULT OF THE 1991 WINTERKILL.</p>",
