White crappie have become exceptionally abundant in Richardson.  The white crappie trap net catch rate was 187.00 fish per lift, which is above the normal range for the lake class.  White crappie in the sample ranged from 5.9 to 12.8 inches in length, and averaged 8.1 inches.  Most of the white crappie sampled were age 3.  Black crappie were also abundant in trap net samples, averaging 9.5 fish per lift, which is within the normal range for the lake class.  Black crappie sampled ranged from 5.9 to 9.4 inches and averaged 7.6 inches in length.  The bluegill trap net catch rate, at 23.25 fish per lift, was within the normal range for this type of lake.  The average length of bluegill sampled was 6.6 inches, with 23% of the sample at 7.0 inches or greater.  The gillnet catch rate was low for both northern pike (0.17 fish/lift) and walleye (1.50 fish/lift).  Northern pike and walleye have been stocked into Richardson only one in the last ten years preceding 1990.  Yellow perch were sampled in gill nets at a rate of 6.5 per gill net lift.  Perch ranged from 5.0 to 7.9 inches and average 6.6 inches in length.</p>",

Smaller numbers of Carp (1.0/gillnet and 0.0/trapnet), Pumpkinseed (6.0/trapnet), Largemouth Bass (1.0/trapnet), Bluegill (1.0/trapnet), and Green Sunfish (0.5/trapnet) were also sampled.  Northern Pike were exclusively of the age III year class and showing normal growth.  Bluegills appear to be growing somewhat fast, and are of age class II, III, and IV.\n\n</p>",

The resurvey included standard gill nets, trap nets, shoreline seinging, and spring night-time electrofishing to sample the fishery.  A total of 14 species of fish were sampled.  The lake is primarily managed for white crappie and northern pike.Trap nets sampled 897 white crappie, for a catch rate of 99.7 per net lift.  Fish ranged in length from 6.9 to 14.8 inches, and 44% of the catch was 8 inches or longer.  Average length was 8.1 inches.Trap nets sampled 112 bluegill for a catch rate of 12.4 per set.  Fish ranged in length from 5.3 to 8.1 inches, and 14% were 7 inches or longer.  Average length was 6.3 inches. Gill nets sampled 22 northern pike for a catch rate of 3.7 per net.  Fish ranged in length from 13.1 to 31.9 inches and had an average length of 22.4 inches.Spring electrofishing for largemouth bass resulted in a total of 70 fish being captured.  Fish ranged in length from 5.4 to 17.6 inches and had an average length of 8.5 inches. </p>",

Specific changes are decreased numbers of black and brown bullheads, and carp, and increased numbers of black and white crappies, and bluegills.  No bullheads or largemouth bass were observed during this assessment.  Bluegill growth rate is good.  White crappie growth rate is fast.  Black crappie growth rate appears fast during the first two years, but decreases to good growth in following years.  Insufficient numbers of northern pike and walleye were collected to determine growth rates.  The white crappie population shows two strong year classes (age 2 and 3), and year class strength appears to be more sporadic than in the black crappie population.  Only one flathead catfish was taken during the assessment.  This may be due to a decrease in population, or the flathead catfish may not have been vulnerable the nets, due to decreased movement.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A standard survey was conducted at Richardson Lake on June 11, 2018, to monitor the lake's fish population and to do a preliminary evaluation of the Walleye stocking regime.   Richardson is a class 24 lake and net catches were compared to similar lakes around the state.  The 2013 lake management plan (LMP) listed Black Crappie, Northern Pike, and White Crappie as primary management species, while Bluegill, Largemouth Bass, and Walleye were ranked as secondary species at Richardson.  In 2018, a total of 9 species were sampled in the gill nets (GN), trap nets (TN), and by spring night-time electrofishing (EF), targeting Largemouth Bass.  The dissolved oxygen concentration fell below 2.0 mg/l at 17 feet, indicating that deeper parts of the lake were not suitable for fish use on June 12.  Water clarity was poor with a secchi disk reading of 2.0 feet.  The cause for the reduced visibility was due to an algae bloom.  Only Walleye were aged for this survey.  Richardson had a history of occasional partial winterkill with the last event occurring in 1997.   <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled moderate numbers (30) of Walleye for a catch rate of 5.0/net, which was within the lake's normal range and the highest ever recorded at Richardson Lake.  The 2013 LMP's long range Walleye goal (>2.8/GN) was met.  The 2012 GN catch rate was 2.2/net.  Historic catch rates from 1951 to 2018 (n=14), under various stocking regimes or no stocking were mostly low, ranging from 0.0 to 5.0/net with an average of 1.4.  In 2018, Walleye were 17.4 to 23.4 inches long with an average of 19.5.  Approximately 87% of the GN catch was 18 inches or longer, indicating a quality size structure.  Walleye were age-4 to age-10 with 4 year classes being present.  Age-4 fish, tracked to a fingerling stocked year (2014), were the most abundant in the catch, accounting for 83% of the GN aged fish.  The 2014 year class would be considered strong.  All other year classes were considered weak.  Age classes from non-stocked year classes accounted for 1 of the 30 (3%) Walleye that were aged, possibly indicating that natural reproduction and immigration from the North Fork of the Crow River were not significant at Richardson.  Connected Dunns Lake was stocked in the same years with the same year classes (fingerlings or yearlings) of fish from 2004 through 2016.  From 1981 to 2003, Walleye were not stocked into Richardson Lake and the GN catch rate in 1999 was 0.0/net, indicating that stocking is necessary to produce a Walleye fishery at Richardson.  In 2018, growth for age-4 Walleye was fast when compared to other lakes statewide.  The current high numbers of Yellow Perch (20.5/net in 2018) and low numbers of Northern Pike (2.2/net in 2018) were likely key factors that contributed to higher Walleye GN catch rate in 2018.     <br> \n  <br> \nGill nets sampled low numbers of Northern Pike (13) for a catch rate of 2.2/net, which was within the lake's normal range.  The 2013 LMP's Northern Pike long range goal (>1.5/GN) was met.  The 2012 GN catch rate was similar (3.8/net).  Historical catch rates (n=14) from 1951 to 2018 were mostly low, ranging from to 0.0 to 9.3/net with an average of 2.8, indicating low recruitment most years.  In 2018, gill netted Northern Pike were 22.0 to 31.5 inches long with an average of 26.9.  Northern Pike were last stocked into Richardson Lake in 1992.  Northern Pike were not aged, but size distribution data indicated that multiple year classes were present, although recruitment would probably be classified as sporadic.  New Northern Pike zone regulations went into effect in the spring of 2018.  Richardson is in the north central regulation zone, which has a 10 fish bag limit, where all fish from 22 to 26 inches in length have to be immediately released and only two harvested fish can be over 26 inches long.  Darkhouse spearers are allowed to have one fish in the protected slot limit.        <br> \n <br> \nTrap nets sampled high numbers (339) of Black Crappie in 2018 for a catch rate of 37.7/net, which was above the lake's normal range.  The 2008 catch rate was even higher at 122.1/net.  The 2013 LMP's long range goal (>6.5/TN) was met in 2018.  Catch rates from 1951 to 2018 (n=14) were variable, ranging from 0.0 to 122.1/net with an average of 30.4.  Trap netted Black Crappie were 3.5 to 11.3 inches long with an average of 6.7.  Approximately 12% of the TN catch was 9 inches or longer, indicating a modest size structure.  Gill nets also sampled high numbers of Black Crappie (615) for a catch rate of 102.5/net, which was above the lake's normal range and the second highest GN catch ever recorded at Richardson.  The 2012 GN catch rate was 19.5/net.  Gill net catch rates from 1971 to 2018 (n=13) were variable, ranging from 0.0 to 122.0/net with an average of 38.5, indicating a moderate to high abundance most of the time.  Gill netted Black Crappie were 3.5 to 10.9 inches long with an average of 6.2.  Black Crappie were not aged, but size distributions indicated adequate recruitment.      <br> \n <br> \nTrap nets sampled moderate to high numbers of Bluegill (293) for a catch rate of 32.6/net which was within the lake's normal range.  The 2013 LMP's long range goal for Bluegill (>7.5) was met.  The 2008 TN catch rate was 16.2/net.  Catch rates from 1951 to 2018 (n=14) were variable, ranging from 1.0 to 65.5/net, with an average of 24.0.  In 2018, TN Bluegill were 4.7 to 8.1 inches long with an impressive average length of 7.1 inches.  Approximately 67% of the TN catch was 7 inches or longer.  Data indicated a quality size structure.  Bluegill were not aged, but size distributions indicated that multiple year classes were present, however recruitment was not consistent.  Bluegill were last stocked in 1972.   <br> \n <br> \nSpring night-time electrofishing targeting Largemouth Bass sampled high numbers (113) of fish for a catch rate of 108.5/hour, which was the highest catch ever recorded at Richardson.  The 2013 LMP's long range goal (>10/hour) was met.  The 2008 EF catch rate was 22.4/hour.  Historic catch rates from 1991 to 2018 (n=7) were variable, ranging from 2.4 to 108.5/hour with an average of 42.1.  Largemouth Bass were 8.5 to 20.6 inches long with an average of 13.0, indicating that a quality population was present.  Fish were not aged but size distributions indicated that multiple age classes were present.  Recruitment would not be considered consistent.  Bass anglers may want to target docks, as submergent vegetation was typically not abundant at Richardson Lake.     <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled high numbers (123) of Yellow Perch for a catch rate of 20.5/net which was within the lake's normal range.  The 2012 catch rate was 14.7/GN.  Catch rates from 1951 to 2018 (n=14) were variable, ranging from 3.5 to 164.3/net with an average of 32.5.  Gill netted Yellow Perch were 5.4 to 9.1 inches long with an average of 7.5, indicating a poor size structure as far as anglers were concerned.  Yellow Perch were likely an important forage item for Walleye and Northern Pike.     <br> \n <br> \nTrap nets failed to sample White Crappie in 2018 for a catch rate of 0.0/net, which was below the lake's normal range and tied with 1951 and 1974 for the lowest catches on record.  The 2008 TN catch rate was 67.0/net.  The 2013 LMP's long range goal (>6.5/TN) was not met in 2018.  Catch rates from 1951 to 2018 (n=14) were variable, ranging from 0.0 to 187.0/net with an average of 45.0.  Gill nets failed to sample White Crappie in 2018 for a catch rate of 0.0/net, which was below the lake's normal range and was tied with 1974 for the lowest catch rate on record.  The 2012 GN catch rate was 0.7/net.  White Crappie GN catch rates from 1971 to 2018 (n=13) were mostly low, ranging from 0.0 to 17.2/net with an average of 6.5.   <br> \n <br> \nTrap nets sampled low numbers (10) of Common Carp for a catch rate of 1.1/net, which was within the lake's normal range.  The 2008 TN catch rate was 0.2/net.  Historic TN catch rates (n=14) from 1951 to 2018 were mostly low, ranging from 0.8 to 12.9/net with an average of 2.2.  In 2018, TN Common Carp were 19.0 to 27.4 inches long with an average of 24.5.  Gill nets also sampled low numbers of Common Carp (2) for a catch rate of 0.3/net, which was within the lake's normal range.  Historic GN catch rates from 1971 to 2018 (n=13) were mostly low, ranging from 0.0 to 44.5/net with an average of 4.4.  Gill netted Common Carp were 23.5 and 25.9 inches long.      <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled low numbers (2) of Black Bullhead for a catch rate of 0.3/net, which was below the lake's normal range.  The 2012 catch rate was also low at 2.3/net.  Historic GN catch rates from 1971 to 2018 (n=13) were variable, ranging from 0.0 to 42.2/net with an average of 10.9.   Gill netted Black Bullhead were 8.4 and 9.8 inches long with an average of 9.1.  Trap nets also sampled low numbers (1) of Black Bullhead for a catch rate of 0.1/net which was below the lake's normal range.  Historic TN catch rates from 1971 to 2018 (n=13) were mostly low, ranging from 0.0 to 13.9/net with an average of 2.1.  Black Bullhead catch rates have not been high since 2003 (42.2/GN).   <br> \n <br> \nAdditional species sampled in the standard gear included; White Sucker (0.2/GN). <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>STATUS OF THE FISHERY:\nBlack and white crappie were the most numerous species present in both the gill net and trap net samples in Lake Richardson.  Gill net catch rates for black and white crappies were 20.0 and 11.3 fish per lift, respectively, and trap net catch rates were 47.3 and 85.8 fish per lift, respectively.  Average length of both black and white crappie sampled in trap nets was 8.0 inches.  The bluegill trap net catch rate, at 16.5 fish per lift, was within the normal range for lakes in the same ecological classification.  No young of the year bluegill were sampled during shoreline seining.  Young of the year largemouth bass were present in seining samples at 7.5 fish per haul. Walleye were present in the gill net samples at 1.2 fish per lift.  Most of the walleye sampled were age 3, and as Richardson has not been stocked with walleye since 1981, it is likely that the walleye emigrated from Dunn's Lake, which is stocked regularly.  The gill net catch rate for northern pike was 0.5 fish per lift, which is below the normal range for lakes of this type.  Northern pike fingerlings were stocked in Richardson in 1990 and 1991, but were likely not yet large enough to be caught in the gill nets.  Low numbers (3) of largemouth bass were sampled during spring electrofishing, but had an impressive maximum length of 20.5 inches.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Richardson Lake is a small lake (111 acres) with a maximum epth of 47 feet located in Meeker County.  Richardson Lakes fish populations were assessed in 1993 with the use of gillnets and trapnets.  Shoreline seining was conducted later in the summer to assess natural reproduction and forage species.  The results of that netting were compared to lake class 24 data.  Fish species of particular interest captured in the testnets included black crappie, white crappie, bluegill, largemouth bass, northern pike, walleye and yellow perch.  Other species captured in testnets included common carp, green sunfish, yellow bullhead and white sucker.     Black crappie, white crappie, bluegill and yellow perch were the most abundant fish species captured during the survey.  Black crappie numbers (40 per trapnet) were well above average for this lake class.  Nearly 70% of the black crappie were age I and II and not yet of a size to interest anglers, but should provide good angling opportunities within the next several years.  Only 13% of the black crappie were longer than 9 inches.  A white crappie trapnet catch of 37 per net was also well above average for lakes of this class.  White crappie numbers have been above average in Richardson Lake over the past five years.  Age II and V white crappie comprised 65% of the catch.  Approximately 45% of the white crappie were longer than 9 inches.  Both white and black crappie numbers have fluctuated widely over the past five years and seem to indicate inconsistent year class strength.     The bluegill trapnet catch of 29 per net was near the lake class median.  Approximately 60% of the bluegill were longer than 6.5 inches.  Bluegill from age II through V were represented in the sample.  Only one largemouth bass was captured in a trapnet during the survey.  However, shoreline seining later in the summer captured 141 young of the year largemouth bass.  No electrofishing assessment of largemouth bass populations was done during this years survey.     Seven northern pike were captured in gillnets for a catch rate  of 1.2 per net which is below the normal range for this lake class.  Six of the seven northern pike were age I and II fish.  This has been typical of many Area lakes, where northern pike populations seem to be rebounding with increased water levels after extended droughts during the late 1980's.      Gillnets captured eleven walleye for a catch rate of 1.8 per net.  This is slightly below the median level but within the normal range for this lake.  Walleye gillnet catches have remained fairly stable in Richardson Lake for the past five surveys.  Three age classes of walleye were present (II, IV and VI) and they exhibited good growth.  Walleye have not been stocked in Richardson Lake for many years, but they have been stocked on nearly an annual basis on adjoining Dunns Lake.  This is the most likely source of the walleye population, as Richardson Lake has few suitable areas for natural reproduction of walleye.       Yellow perch numbers in gillnets (48 per net) were above the average range for this lake class.  This is a large increase in yellow perch numbers from past surveys when they were usually below the median level.  Age I and II yellow perch comprised 80% of the catch.  Growth was good with age II perch averaging 7.4 inches long.  These fish may provide good angling over the next several years.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A population assessment was conducted at Richardson Lake in Meeker County beginging on 6/16/03 to evaluate the fish population.  Spring night-time electrofishing, targeting largemouth bass, was conducted on 5/23/03.  Richardson Lake is 111 acres and has a maximum depth of 47 feet.  The public access is located on the southwest shore.  Summer algal blooms can be intense on Richardson Lake.  Water clarity was 2.9 feet during the week that netting took place.  The lake is primarily managed for northern pike and white crappie.Netting in 2003 inidcated high numbers of northern pike (9.3/net) at Richardson Lake.  This was the largest gill net catch rate observed since netting began in 1951.  Pike were 15.2-26.6 inches long averaging 20.7 inches.  Approximately 70% of the sample was between 19 and 22 inches.  The white crappie trap net catch rate (3.0/net), indicated a small population of fish.  This was a large drop from the 1999 catch rate of 99.7/net.  A strong 1997 year class was all but gone by 2003.  Many crappie populations in this area exhibit a similar chaotic nature.  A spring fish kill was reported at connected Dunns Lake in 2001 and crappie in Richardson Lake may also have suffered losses.  What the white crappie lack in numbers they make up for in size.  White crappie were 4.6-11.4 inches long, averaging 9.9 inches.  The black crappie catch rate (24.0/net) was similar to the lakes historical average (20.8/net), indicating a typical population for Richardson Lake.  The averaged size for black crappie was 7.1 inches.  Age 2 fish made up 82% of the sample, implying that the 2001 year class was moderately strong.  Fair numbers of bluegill were sampled (13.3/net).  Fish were 3.0 to 8.3 inches long.  Approximately 42% of the bluegill sampled in trap nets were 7 inches or longer.  A total of 2 walleye were netted in this assessment.  Walleye were last stocked in 1981.  The fish could be a result of natural reproduction or they may have migrated in from Dunns Lake.  A fish ladder was recently built at the Dunns Lake outlet allowing fish from the North Fork of the Crow River to access the lake.  Once in Dunns they could easily swim through the channel into Richardson.  The EF assessment sampled high numbers of largemouth bass (62.6/hour).  Unfortuneately, most of the fish were small, averaging 8.6 inches.  Only 6% of the sample was 11 inches or longer.  The longest bass captured was 14.1 inches.  Carp numbers in 2003 (4.2/net) appeared to have dropped since the record catch rate in 1999 (12.9/net).  The northern pike, black crappie and bluegill populations could be characterized as fair to good.  </p>",

A total of 10 different species of fish were sampled.   <br> \n <br> \nRichardson's lakeshed (5,084 acres) was dominated by row crop agriculture.  The lakeshed to lake ratio was 45:1.  Roughly 2/3 of the shoreline was undeveloped, with forest being the dominant coverage.  Aquatic vegetation was sparse and with little diversity (6 varieties).  The two species of submergent vegetation present, curlyleaf pondweed and sago pondweed, were both classified as rare.  Sand and silt were the only shoalwater substrates classified as abundant.  Dissolved oxygen dropped below 2 mg/l at 24 foot on 6/16/08.  Water clarity was fair, with a secchi disk reading of 5.0 feet in mid June. <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled 19 walleye for a catch rate of 3.2/net, which was within the normal range for this type of lake.  The 2008 catch rate was the highest ever recorded at Richardson Lake.  The 2003 catch rate was 0.3/net.  Walleye were 12.4 to 21.1 inches long averaging 16.8 inches.  Walleye were 2 to 5 years old with 3 year-classes present.  Approximately 5% of the gill netted fish (1 fish) came from non-stocked years, which likely indicated that the stockings were successful.  Growth was fast.  The latest stocking regime (1 pound of fingerlings every-other-year) was initiated in 2004.   <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled 13 northern pike for a catch rate of 2.2/net, which was within the normal range for this type of lake.  The 2003 catch rate was 9.3/net.  Northern pike were 18.2 to 31.6 inches long averaging 27.0 inches.  Northern pike were 1 to 4 years old with 4 year-classes present.  Growth was fast.     <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled 39 yellow perch for a catch rate of 6.5/net, which was within the normal range for lakes of this type.  The 2003 catch rate was 25.0/net.  The latest three catch rates indicated a downward trend in the number of fish caught per net. Yellow perch were 5.6 to 8.7 inches long averaging 6.7 inches.  Yellow perch were 2 to 4 years old with 3 year-classes present.   <br> \n <br> \nSpring night-time electrofishing sampled 18 largemouth bass for a catch rate of 22.4/hr of electrofisher on-time.  The 2003 catch rate was 62.6/hr.  Catch rates (n=6) from 1991 to 2008 ranged from 2.4 to 64.6/hr, averaging 31.1/hr.  The latest three catch rates indicated a downward trend for the number of fish caught per hour.   Largemouth bass were 9.5 to 16.7 inches long averaging 11.3 inches.  Largemouth bass were 3 to 6 years old with 2 year-classes present.  Age 3 fish accounted for 89% of the electrofishing sample.  The mean length at third annulus formation was 10.9 inches.  A poor size structure and few year-classes indicated a marginal largemouth bass population.  A lack of aquatic vegetation is likely limiting largemouth bass recruitment at Richardson Lake.   <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled 8 carp for a catch rate of 1.3/net, which was withing the normal range for this type of lake.  The 2003 catch rate was 5.5/net.  Carp were 20.1 to 23.6 inches long averaging 21.7 inches.  The trap net catch rate was 0.2/net.  Trap net catch rates have been steadily declining since the all time high catch in 1999. <br> \n <br> \nBlack bullhead were not sampled in 2008.  A total of 2 yellow bullhead were trap netted for a catch rate of 0.2/net.   <br> \n <br> \nTrap nets sampled 1,099 black crappie for a catch rate of 122.1/net, which was above the normal range for this type of lake.  The 2008 catch rate was the highest ever recorded at Richardson Lake.  The 2003 catch rate was 24.0/net.  Black crappie were 6.3 to 10.9 inches long averaging 7.4 inches.  Approximately 16% of the trap net catch was 8 inches or longer.  Gill nets sampled 732 black crappie for a catch rate of 122.0/net, with fish lengths ranging from 5.2 to 11.2 inches.  Black crappie were 2 to 5 years old with 4 year-classes present.  The majority of the fish appeared to be from the 2005 year-class (age 3).  Growth was slow.  Black crappie have a history of producing sporadic strong year-classes at Richardson Lake and the 2005 age-class should provide plenty of angling opportunity. <br> \n <br> \nTrap nets sampled 603 white crappie for a catch rate of 67.0/net, which was above the normal range for this lake type.  The 2003 catch rate was 3.0/net.  White crappie were 6.5 to 12.4 inches long averaging 8.3 inches.  Approximately 64% of the trap net catch was 8 inches or longer, while 9% were 9 inches or longer.  Gill nets sampled 72 white crappie for a catch rate of 12.0/net, with fish lengths ranging from 4.1 to 9.5 inches.  White crappie were 1 to 6 years old with 6 year-classes present.  The majority of the fish appeared to be from the 2005 year-class (age 3).  On average, white crappie grew faster than black crappie did for every year-class (ages1-5).  White crappie have a history of producing strong year-classes and the 2005 age-class should provide good angling opportunities. <br> \n <br> \nTrap nets sampled 146 bluegill for a catch rate of 16.2/net, which was within the normal range for lakes of this type.  The 2003 catch rate was 13.3/net.  Bluegill were 4.2 to 8.2 inches long averaging 6.3 inches.  Approximately 66% of the trap net catch was 6 inches or longer, while 23% were 7 inches or longer and 8% reached the 8 inch mark.  Bluegill were 2 to 6 years old with 5 year-classes present.  Growth was fast. <br> \n <br> \nShoreline seining sampled young-of-the-year: largemouth bass (69).  Bluntnose minnow  (17) were also seined.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>STATUS OF THE FISHERY:\nNet catches were compared to similar lakes (class 24) across the state.  Gamefish species captured in the nets included northern pike, bluegill, white crappie, black crappie, yellow perch and walleye.  The northern pike catch of 2.5/net was below the normal range for this type of lake.  Northern pike numbers have declined in Richardson Lake since the mid 1970's and have been at low levels recently.  This may be due to recent drought conditions.  Northern pike fingerlings have been stocked the past two years and may account for some of the fish sampled.  The white crappie catch for both gillnet and trapnet (17.2 and 73.0/net, respectively) was above the normal range for this lake type.  Age three fish were missing from the sample, but all other age classes, through age six were represented.  A large portion of the catch (40%) were age 5.  Most younger age classes were equally represented in the sample.  Many of the white crappie ranged in length from 8 to 10 inches and are acceptable to anglers.  A black crappie gillnet catch of 14.2/net was above the lake class normal range also.  However, the trapnet catch of 3.8/net was below the median value.  Age classes of black crappie were evenly distributed, with the exception of age 3 fish, which represented only 7% of the catch.  This is similar to the catch composition for white crappie.  Growth for both crappie species appears to be good for the first two years and then slows.  This may be due to low densities of optimum size forage, as the fish switch from plankton to a fish diet.  Yellow perch numbers were within the normal range for this lake type.  Nearly 70% of the catch were age 1 and 2 fish.  Perch through age 4 were present in the sample and growth appears to be good.  Walleye were present in the gillnets at 1.3/net, which is within the normal range for this type of lake.  Only eight walleye were sampled, ranging in size from 12 to 21 inches long.  No walleye have been stocked in Richardson Lake since 1981, but they have been stocked in Dunns's Lake on an annual basis, which is connected through an outlet.  Trapnets also sampled bluegill at a rate of 43.5/net.  This number is within the normal range for this lake type.  The catch was comprised almost entirely (96%) of age 2 fish, ranging in length from 3.5 to 6.9 inches.  These fish might be expected to enter the creel in the next several years.  Bluegill abundance has declined in Richardson Lake since 1986, but now appears to be increasing.  This variability appears to be common in Richardson Lake as well as many other area lakes.  Nighttime electrofishing was conducted on Richardson Lake in the spring.  This sampling targeted largemouth bass.  A total of 10 bass were captured for a catch of 7.8 bass per hour of electrofishing.  All bass sampled were age 1 fish, ranging in size from 3.6 to 7.0 inches long.  No bass were sampled during the standard survey.  Flathead catfish have been stocked in Richardson Lake in the past, most recently in 1989.  At that time, 23 adult fish, with an average weight of 15 pounds each, were stocked.  None of these fish were sampled during the survey.  However, it is not expected that the standard sampling gear would efficiently capture these large fish.</p>",
