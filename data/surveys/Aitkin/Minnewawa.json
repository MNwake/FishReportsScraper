                "narrative": "<p>Minnewawa is a large, relatively shallow lake with bog stained water and abundant aquatic vegetation located in northeastern Aitkin County.  There is a large state-owned public access with two concrete log ramps on the south side of the lake as well as numerous smaller state and township accesses scattered around the lake.  Residential development is heavy with most of the desirable lakeshore developed with seasonal cabins or permanent homes before 1970.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie catch, 6.3 per gill net and 2.7 per trap net, was similar to the last assessment and within the normal range for similar lakes.  Size in standard survey gear ranged from 3.8 to 12.2 inches with an average of 6.9 inches.  Growth was below average with fish reaching 7.4 inches in five growing seasons. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill abundance, 31.9 per trap net, remained above the normal range for the third consecutive assessment dating back to 2002.  This is a high rate compared to the average catch from the six surveys conducted from 1956-1997, of 10.2 per trap net.  Growth was below average with fish reaching 5.0 inches by age 5. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance decreased from the last assessment to 0.8 per gill net, below the normal range for similar lakes.  Age analysis of gill netted fish revealed all individuals were age-7 and older.  As with the last assessment, the 2002 and 2003 year-classes were the most abundant, suggesting that no strong year-classes have been produced since that time.  Annual walleye fry stocking resumed in 2011, and although no fish were sampled from these years they were likely too small to be effectively captured by survey nets.   <br> \n <br> \nThe northern pike catch of 10.3 per gill net was a decrease from 2007, but remained above the normal range for similar lakes.  Size was fair as fish averaged 21.0 inches and 2.1 pounds with 21% greater than 24 inches and fish up to 32 inches sampled.  <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass were sampled in low numbers in standard survey gear, 0.1 per gill net and 0.3 per trap net.  Spring trap netting, conducted in addition to standard gear, captured 49 bass ranging from 6.7 to 19.1 inches with an average of 16.1 inches and 2.4 pounds.   <br> \n <br> \nOther observations from the 2012 survey include an increase in yellow perch abundance in gill nets to 12.3 per net, the highest catch since 1992.  Conversely, the abundance of yellow bullhead decreased in gill nets and in trap nets.  These conditions, increasing abundance of important prey and decreasing abundance of undesirable predators, may indicate a favorable trend for the fishery into the near future. <br> \n</p>",

This was the fourth annual survey to look for young-of-the-year (YOY) walleye.  The total sample time was 1.75 hours with 2 YOY-walleyes sampled (1.1/hr), which is the first time YOY-walleye have been captured to date.  No other walleye were captured. <br> \n <br> \nResults of the first four years of fall electrofishing suggest either 1). This method is not effective at capturing enough walleye to be useful as an index of walleye fry survival.  2). Stocked walleye fry do not survive at high enough rates to be sampled in the fall.  An informal survey conducted by the lake association in 2013 found that anglers reported catching some small walleye during the open-water season despite not having been sampled in any fall electrofishing surveys.   <br> \n <br> \nFall or spring electrofishing should continue through 2015 as staff time permits to develop an index of YOY abundance and determine the effectiveness of the restarted fry stocking strategy.  A population assessment scheduled for 2015 should provide additional information on the success of walleye fry stocking and direction for future walleye stocking prescriptions and evaluations.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Minnewawa is a large, relatively shallow lake with bog stained water and abundant aquatic vegetation and is located in northeastern Aitkin County.  There is a large state-owned public access with two concrete log ramps on the south side of the lake as well as numerous smaller state and township accesses scattered around the lake.  Residential development is heavy with most of the desirable lakeshore developed before 1970 with seasonal cabins or permanent homes.  The lake association operates an aquatic vegetation harvester to maintain recreational access for property owners.  Lake Minnewawa is managed primarily for Walleye and Bluegill. Special regulations for each of these species have been implemented and reduced bag limits of 3 for Walleye and 10 for Sunfish now exist for Lake Minnewawa. <br> \n <br> \nDue to poor natural reproduction of Walleye from 2004 thru 2010, Walleye fry stocking resumed in 2011.  Currently Walleye fry (1.15 million) are being stocked in even years as we assess natural reproduction. Walleye abundance has increased in each of the past three surveys and was 4.1/gill net in 2021, which continues to meet the goal listed in the current management plan of 3/gill net and exceeds the long term average of 3.1/ net.  Age analysis of gillnetted fish revealed individuals from 1 to 9 years old and most (69%) were age 3 and 4, from the 2017 and 2018 year classes respectively, both of which were fry stocked year classes.  While no fish were observed from the 2019 year class that was not stocked, a reasonable number of fish were observed from the 2020 year class which was also not stocked. Previously, genetic analysis of the spawning Walleye population suggested that about 40% were from natural reproduction.  Growth rates for Walleye were good, averaging 14.7 inches in four years. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill abundance (13.2/trap net) was relatively unchanged from 2018 and is near the long term average of 14.6/trap net.  The size structure for Bluegill currently meets management goals.  Fifty-six percent of Bluegills were 7 inches or larger.  Growth rates were average for the area.  Hybrid sunfish are also present in the lake and can reach sizes greater than 10 inches on occasion.  The newer Sunfish bag limit regulation (10 fish) should help to maintain this high quality. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie increased from 1.7/ gill net in 2018 to 4.3/gill net in 2021, however trap net catches decreased slightly, 1.3/net in 2018 to .8/net in 2021, which is the lowest we've seen.  Aside from this year's gill net catch, numbers had been declining in both gears.  It's possible that higher Walleye numbers may be influencing crappie abundance, a trend that's been noted in other waters.  Mean size was 6.7 inches in gill nets and 8.7 inches in trap nets.  Fish up to 12.3 inches were sampled and growth rate was normal. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike abundance increased slightly from 3.2/gill net in 2018 to 4.4/gill net in 2021.  The catch rate for Northern Pike is now slightly below the long term average for Minnewawa and meets the management goal for the lake (3-6/gill net) for the third survey in a row.  However, only ten percent were greater than 24 inches, which is short of the management goal of 25% greater than 24 inches.  The average size of pike was 19.4 inches, with a maximum size of 34.1 inches.  This condition of lower pike abundance including lower numbers of recruits bodes well for Walleye management in the near future. <br> \n <br> \nSimilar to the previous survey Largemouth Bass were sampled in low numbers.  Trap nets had a catch rate of (0.8/net) and gill nets had a catch rate of (0.3/net).  On 5/12/2021, spring bass electrofishing was conducted for the second time.  Largemouth Bass were caught at a rate of 6/hour in 2021, compared with 20.7/hr in 2018. They ranged in length from 8.2 to 15.4 inches with a mean size of 13.6 inches. Water temperatures were still relatively cool during sampling (upper 50's to lower 60's) and may have affected catch rates.  Known as a good bass lake, numbers appear to still be recovering from a recent winterkill (2014-15) and several other stressful winters since then.  Partial kills on bass in shallower lakes in the Aitkin area are not unusual and often affect just the larger individuals.  <br> \n <br> \nThe 2021 catch rate of Yellow Perch (3.9/gill net) decreased from 2018 (9.2/gill net) and is on the lower end of the range for similar lakes.  Fish ranged from 3.4 to 9.6 inches with a mean of 6.2 inches.  </p>",

This data is pre-regulation and will help provide a baseline to determine if a 10 fish bag limit (implementation 2021) is having any effect on the fishery. Two daytime electrofishing runs were completed for a total of 0.8 hours of sampling effort. The catch rate for Bluegill was 93 per hour with 1 netter. Bluegill sampled ranged from 4.5 inches to 8.8 inches with an average size of 6.8 inches. Eight Bluegill larger than 8 inches were sampled and three Hybrid Sunfish were also caught, including 1 surpassing 10 inches. Future spring surveys and standard survey data will be used to evaluate the regulation. <br> \n</p>",

Recent gill net assessment data (2007) and increasing angler complaints of poor walleye fishing, however, suggest that walleye recruitment over the last 7 years or so has been poor.  While the walleye biomass in 2007 was high, there was only 1 fish less than 14\".  To verify this poor recruitment, fall electrofishing was conducted for the first time in 2010 to look for young-of-the-year (YOY) walleye.  No YOY were caught and only 4 adults were caught (3.1/hr, and all were age 8 and older) in 1.3 hours of electrofishing.  Despite the low catch in 2010, fall electrofishing should continue in the immediate future to determine if a restarted fry stocking program results in recruitment, develop a baseline index for YOY abundance and further determine the need for the walleye stocking program.</p>",

This method is not effective at capturing enough walleye to be useful as an index of walleye fry survival. 2). Stocked walleye fry do not survive at high enough rates to be sampled in the fall. An informal survey conducted by the lake association in 2013 found that anglers reported catching some small walleye during the open-water season despite not having been sampled in any fall electrofishing surveys. A population assessment scheduled for 2015 should provide additional information on the success of walleye fry stocking and direction for future walleye stocking prescriptions and evaluations. Spring electrofishing or trap netting should be considered as staff time permits to help evaluate the success of the current strategies. <br> \n</p>",

Standard survey trap nets were set at 14 locations around the lake and fished over three days with 34 total lifts.  Spring trap nets captured more black crappie (8.8/lift) than summer resurvey trap nets (2.7/lift).  Fish were also larger, with an average size of 9.0\" in spring compared to 7.2\" in summer trap nets.  Spring trap nets also provide important data on the largemouth bass population size structure, since few fish are typically captured in standard summer gear.  The spring assessment captured 49 largemouth bass ranging from 6.7 to 19.1\" with an average of 16.1\" and 2.4 pounds.   <br> \n <br> \nBluegill catch was similar in both spring (35.7/lift with an average size of 6.7\") and summer trap nets (31.1/lift with an average size of 6.5\").  Northern pike size structure was also similar in spring trap nets (average size of 21.1\" and 14% greater than 24\") and summer gill nets (average size of 21.0\" and 21% greater than 24\").  Sampling occurred too late in the spring to effectively sample the spawning population of northern pike and their size structure. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Minnewawa is a large, relatively shallow lake with bog stained water and abundant aquatic vegetation, and is located in northeastern Aitkin County.  There is a large state-owned public access with two concrete log ramps on the south side of the lake as well as numerous smaller state and township accesses scattered around the lake.  Residential development is heavy with most of the desirable lakeshore developed before 1970 with seasonal cabins or permanent homes. The lake association operates an aquatic vegetation harvester to maintain recreational access for property owners. Lake Minnewawa is managed primarily for walleye and bluegill.  <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie catch rates of 1.4 per gill net and 1.9 per trap net were less than the last assessment, but still within the normal range for similar lakes.  Sizes in standard survey gear ranged from 4.0 to 10.8 inches, with an average of 8.7 inches.  Growth was average with fish reaching 8.5 inches in five growing seasons. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill abundance dropped to 7.3 per trap net, which is in the normal range for this lake class.   Bluegill abundance was above normal from 2002 to 2012 and exhibited slow growth (5 inches by age 5).  Growth returned to average in recent years, with fish reaching 6.3 inches by age 5. <br> \n <br> \nDue to poor natural reproduction of walleye since 2005, annual walleye fry stocking resumed in 2011.  Walleye abundance increased from the last assessment to 2.3 per gill net, but was still below the normal range for similar lakes and the long term goal for walleye management of 3 per gill net.  Age analysis of gill netted fish revealed all individuals were age 1-3 or 10 and older. The age 2 (2013 year class) was the most abundant and grew well (11.0 inches average).  Genetic analysis indicated that about 20% of the young walleye were from natural reproduction. <br> \n <br> \nThe northern pike catch rate of 4.6 per gill net was a decrease from 2012, but remained in the normal range for similar lakes.  Size was fair and fish averaged 21.8 inches and 2.4 pounds, with 29% greater than 24 inches.  Fish up to 31.9 inches were sampled.  <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass were sampled in low numbers in standard survey gear, 0.3 per trap net and none in the gill nets.   While conducting spring ice out walleye work, numerous dead largemouth bass were observed, suggesting some over winter mortality.   <br> \n <br> \nAnother observation from the 2012 survey is a stable and abundant perch population for game fish forage. This forage base, along with lower pike and bass populations, should help with the recovery and growth of the walleye population and growth of northern pike. <br> \n</p>",

The purpose was to collect fin clips to later be used for genetic analysis determining strain and furthermore which strain was contributing the most to the fishery. Ten standard trap nets were lifted over a period of 3 days for a total of 30 lifts.  Nets were mainly scattered along the west side of Sheshebee point and a couple were on the point directly north of there. A total of 170 Walleye (112 male/57 female/1 unknown) were caught from 13.5 to 27.5 inches with a mean length of 18.3 inches.  Preserved fin clips were sent to Loren Miller, Fisheries Geneticist at the University of Minnesota for testing. Though there is variability in the analysis the results were 62 percent Pine River strain and 38 percent Minnewawa strain.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Minneawawa is a large, relatively shallow, dark water lake located in east central Aitkin County.  The lake is comprised of three basins.  The northeast basin is a long narrow body of water that can be separated into two distinct habitat types.  The southeastern one-forth and the northwestern one-fourth of the basin are shallow areas with extensive wild rice beds.  The central portion of the basin is moderately deep (maximum depth 17 feet) with sand, gravel and rubble shorelines.  The southwest basin is a long, narrow, shallow bay (less than 10 feet) with a marshy shoreline and mud bottom.  The central basin is the largest of the three basins and is best described as a large shallow bowl.  This is the deepest bay of the lake (Maximum depth 21 feet).   The shoreline varies from long expanses of gently sloping sand to areas of sharper drop-offs with rock and rubble.Minnewawa has historically been noted for its panfish and walleye fishing.  The species commonly sought by anglers in both the open water and winter seasons are bluegill and black crappie.  While no large specimens of these two species were sampled in this survey, bluegills up to 10 inches and black crappies up to 13 in length have been sampled in past surveys.The walleye population has been very stable over the years ranging from a low of 2.2 to a high of 4.7 walleye per gill net.  Walleye management practices have employed both fry and fingerling stocking to enhance abundance.  Evaluation of both fry and fingerling stock did not appreciably contribute to the abundance above levels supported by natural reproduction.  The walleye age distribution indicates varying annual success of natural reproduction with a strong year class in 1998 that should provide some good fishing over the next few years.The northern pike population, like the walleye population, has been stable over the years, usually ranging between the second and third quartiles for this lake class.  The length frequency distribution for northern pike is dominated by smaller fish, however a few larger fish were caught with two measuring over 30 inches in length.  In addition to angling, northern pike provide winter spearering opprotunities.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Minnewawa is moderately large and shallow, has a relatively complex shape, and has low water clarity due to bog staining. Based on these characteristics, the lake is placed in Lake Class 41 within the Section of Fisheries' lake typing system. Much of the shoreline of the main basin contains sparse or no emergent vegetation and is underlain in sand or sand and gravel. Extensive bulrush and cane beds occur in the central area of the main basin and in the main basin's southeast corner, near the state public access. Much of the shoreline in the east or inlet bay is covered in large beds of wild rice, bulrushes and floatingleaf waterlilies and the shoreline substrate is varied. The outlet bay has extensive submergent plant beds over a muck bottom. Most of the wild rice in the outlet bay is gone. Submerged plants occur throughout the lake and the Minnewawa Lake Association operates an aquatic plant harvester during the summer in large areas of the lake to control submerged plant growth under DNR permit.    The walleye population is self-sustaining and is maintaining itself within the low end of the lake class average of 3.2 to 15.3 walleyes per gillnet lift. The walleyes ranged from 7.2 to 24.0 inches, average 14.2 inches, and ranged from 1 to 14 years of age with only 2 missing year classes. The 1994 year class was the strongest samples and averaged 13 inches in length. Angler harvest is likely to increase in the next year or two as the 1994 year class of walleyes reaches harvestable size.    Northern pike were caught at rates similar to previous surveys. The northerns ranged from 10.0 to 31.8 inches and averaged 18.7 inches in length. Only one pike over 5 years of age was sampled. The abundance of larger and older northern pike is probably limited by a combination of low natural reproduction prior to the adequate year class in 1993 and high angling harvest which reduces survival of harvestable-size pike.    Bluegills were sampled at a normal rate for this lake type but at rates which were lower than in the previous three surveys. The bluegills in the trap nets averaged a respectable 6.4 inches and ranged from 3.2 to 9.6 inches. Relatively consistent year- class strength indicates the bluegill population will likely maintain its present structure.    The black crappie population, though only average in abundance for this lake type, contains some quality-sized fish. Twelve percent of the crappies were at least 10 inches long, the largest was 12.5 inches. The two strongest year classes sampled in this survey were young, two and three years old. In the next two years crappie fishing is likely to increase as these fish reach harvestable size.    The yellow perch catch rate was lower than in any previous survey. Nearly all of the perch were smaller than anglers prefer.     Bullhead catches were generally lower than in the 1992 assessment. The low abundance may be a result of commercial harvest of bullheads in recent years.     Largemouth bass were not adequately sampled by the nets used in this survey. Electrofishing sampling will be necessary to evaluate the largemouth bass population status.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Minnewawa is a large, relatively shallow, dark water lake located in east central Aitkin County. The lake is comprised of three basins of varying habitats, ranging from extensive wild rice beds or marshy shorelines, to a large windswept bowl with sand, gravel, and rubble shorelines. Maximum depth is 21 feet and shoreline topography ranges from gentle slopes to steep drop offs.  There are two concrete public accesses located along the south side of the lake off of county road 6 and another one on the north side off of county road 14.  There are also some unimproved township access points located around the lake.  Historically Minnewawa has been noted for its open water and winter panfish and walleye fisheries. <br> \n <br> \nThe gillnet catches for crappie were the highest ever documented on the lake at 8.4 per net, while the trap net catches were about normal at 1.5 per net. Crappies up to 11.6 inches were sampled with a mean size of 7.4 inches. The 2002 and 2003 year classes are strong, with fish from these year classes averaging between 7.5 and 8.5 inches at the time of the survey.   <br> \n <br> \nBluegill trap net catch rates were slightly lower than in 2002; however, biomass was the highest we've observed.  There has been an overall trend of increasing abundance since the first trap net assessment in 1956.  Along with the increased densities has come a reduction in growth rate.  In previous surveys, fish reached 6 inches after four years; whereas, in the 2007 sample, bluegill were less than 4.5 inches at the same age.    Currently, the 2002-year class of bluegill, which is very strong, had a mean length of 5.9 inches.  Fish of this age in previous samplings would have averaged about 7.5 inches.  The decrease in growth rate is likely the primary reason only one fish was sampled that was over 8 inches long. The younger year classes do appear to be weaker, so there may be an increase in growth rates as the 2002 year class leaves the system by angler harvest or natural mortality and then the younger fish will have less competition among themselves. <br> \n <br> \nThe walleye population appears to have been very stable over the years, ranging from a low of 2.2 to a high of 4.7 walleye per gill net. In 2007, the gill net catch per unit effort for walleye was 3.7 fish per net.  Although this index was very near the long-term mean (3.2 fish per net), the index of biomass for walleye was the highest observed (8.4 pounds per net vs. mean of 4.1 pounds per net).  Mean weight of walleye in the gill net was 2.25 pounds, which was also the highest observed. Much of these increases in weight/biomass can be attributed to strong 2002 and 2003 year classes, as well as good recruitment for much of the later 1990s. The walleyes from these year classes, (2002 and 2003), are providing fish to anglers in the 16 to 20 inch range. Walleye management on Minnewawa dates back to 1917.  Until 1982, both fry and fingerling stocking were used in an attempt to enhance walleye abundance. Evaluations of these methods indicated that neither methods of stocking appreciably contributed to the abundance of walleye. <br> \n <br> \nThe northern pike population, like the walleye population, has been stable over the years, ranging between 2 to 5 fish per net, back to 1946; however, in 2007 pike numbers increased significantly jumping to 13.2 fish per net.  This was more than twice as high as previously observed, and well above the 75th percentile for similar lakes. Although the numbers were very high, growth rates were still good, and size distribution indicated a quality fishery. The northern pike had a mean weight of 2.36 pounds and maximum length of 35 inches. <br> \nAnglers are encouraged to release larger fish to help maintain the desirable size distribution presently exhibited by the fish populations in Lake Minnewawa.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Minnewawa is a large, relatively shallow lake with bog stained water and abundant aquatic vegetation, and is located in northeastern Aitkin County.  There is a large state-owned public access with two concrete log ramps on the south side of the lake as well as numerous smaller state and township accesses scattered around the lake.  Residential development is heavy with most of the desirable lakeshore developed before 1970 with seasonal cabins or permanent homes.  The lake association operates an aquatic vegetation harvester to maintain recreational access for property owners.  Lake Minnewawa is managed primarily for Walleye and Bluegill.  <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie (1.7/gill net and1.3/trap net) respectively were captured just below the expected range for lakes of this type, and were essentially unchanged from the previous survey in 2015.  Mean size was 6.4 inches in gill nets and 10.3 inches in trap nets.  Fish up to 11.5 inches were sampled. Growth was average with fish reaching 9.5 inches in five growing seasons. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill abundance (14.7/trap net) increased from 2015, and is now near the long term average of 14.8.  The size structure for Bluegill currently exceeds management goals.  Thirty percent of Bluegills were 7 inches or larger.  Growth rates were slower for fish up to 3 years old and then improved after that achieving 5.5 inches by age 4. <br> \n <br> \nDue to poor natural reproduction of Walleye since 2005, annual Walleye fry stocking resumed in 2011.  Currently Walleye fry (1.15 million) are being stocked in even years.  Overall, Walleye abundance has been increasing over the past three surveys.  The 2018 catch of 3.2/gill net met the goal listed in the current management plan of 3/gill net, which is near the long term average and was a modest increase from the previous assessment in 2015 (2.3/gill net).  Age analysis of gill netted fish revealed all individuals were age 1-5 or 16 and older.  The age 3 year class (2015) was the most abundant and grew well averaging nearly 14 inches.  The age 5 (2013 year class), which is considered to be strong, is still significantly contributing to the fishery and individuals from this cohort were averaging 18.5 inches long. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike abundance (3.2/gill net) has decreased over the past several surveys, and is now near the expected range for similar lakes.  Their abundance is currently just below the historic gill net catch rate average of 5.3/net, and meets the management goal for the lake of 3-6/net, although the size structure was smaller than preferred.  Only six percent of Northern Pike were greater than 24 inches.  The average size of pike was 19.5 inches with one individual fish reaching 33.6 inches.  Poor recruitment of the 2016 year class will likely lighten the burden on the forage base and allow the stock to improve in size structure within the next few years.  This should also allow for better survival of young Walleye too. <br> \n <br> \nSimilar to the previous surveys, Largemouth Bass were sampled in low numbers in trap nets (0.4/net) and none were sampled in gill nets.  Spring bass electrofishing runs were conducted for the first time in 2018.  Largemouth Bass were caught at a modest rate of 20.7/hr and ranged in length from 9.8 - 15.5 inches.  The average size was 11.5 inches and growth rates were good.  Known as a good bass lake, numbers in Lake Minnewawa are likely still recovering from a recent winterkill (2014-15).  Partial kills on bass in shallower lakes in the Aitkin area are not unusual and often affect just the larger individuals.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch abundance decreased slightly, but has remained within normal levels and has been fairly stable over time.  This forage base, along with lower pike and bass populations, should help with the recovery and growth of the Walleye population and growth of Northern Pike. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Electrofishing to monitor the abundance of young-of-the-year (YOY) walleyes was conducted on October 1, 2012.  This survey was intended to provide information on the success of walleye fry stocking, which was restarted in 2011.  Fall electrofishing has been conducted annually since 2010.  Extreme weather conditions were experienced in spring and summer 2012.  Many lakes in the area were ice-free earlier than any other year that data has been collected.  Above average temperatures occurred in every month from January to September.  Unusually large rainfall events in late May and June resulted in approximately 22 inches of precipitation, compared to 7.5 inches during average years.  The highest lake level ever recorded on the lake occurred on June 26, 2012.  Water levels had returned to near-normal levels for this survey. <br> \n <br> \nWeather conditions were fair for electrofishing but visibility was poor due to a combination of pine pollen, filamentous algae, and vegetation.  No walleye were captured during fall night electrofishing for the second year in a row.  It is unclear whether the lack of fish indicates the failure of fry stocking, or that fall electrofishing is not a reliable technique to evaluated stocked fry survival to fall on this lake.  Fall electrofishing should continue to be conducted as long as fry are stocked to determine its effectiveness as a monitoring tool.  <br> \n</p>",

Trap nets and night electrofishing were used to mark the walleyes and electrofishing was used as the primary recapture method.  Trap nets were placed in areas judged to be suitable spawning habitat throughout the lake and electrofishing was conducted in these same general areas.  A total of 42 trap nets lifts were completed the week of 4/13/2015.  During the marking phase of the project electrofishing was conducted on 4/13 and 4/16 and the recapture portion of the project was done on the night of 5/4/15.  Fish were measured, sexed, and marked by removing the third dorsal spine from all walleye and a lower caudal fin clip (hole punch) was also applied to each fish.  A total of 70 walleye were marked from trap netting and electrofishing efforts during the marking phase.  Only fish longer than 300 mm were marked.  After allowing a period of time for the fish to mix, a recapture electrofishing run was conducted on 5/4/2015.  During the recapture phase a total of 91 walleyes were sampled, however only 5 fish were longer than 300 mm, and none of those fish were marked, so we were unable to generate a population estimate.  Though we were unable to attain desirable sample size of walleye for a reliable population estimate it was encouraging to see the numbers of juvenile fish in the spring as they have been difficult to sample in the fall of the year (none sampled in 5 years of fall electrofishing sampling, 3 with fry stocking).  <br> \n  <br> \nAdditionally, scale samples from fish sampled in this survey were sent to University of Minnesota for determination of genetic strain.  Previously, it had been determined that fish from Big Sandy and Lake Minnewawa were genetically similar, yet distinguishable, from fish that are used in our fry stocking program, which originate from the Pine River upstream of Whitefish Lake in Crow Wing County.  Results of the genetic testing suggest the sample of young fish collected in this assessment were approximately 80% from the Pine River (stocked as fry), while 20% were from natural reproduction.  Given the poor recruitment of natural fish in the last decade, this ratio is not unexpected.  The current lake management plan calls for annual fry stocking through at least 2018.  After this date, it was suggested that a gap in stocking occur to determine the extent of contribution of the new strain to the natural reproduction in Lake Minnewawa.   <br> \n</p>",
