                "narrative": "<p>Elm Island Lake is located about six miles southeast of Aitkin.  The lake is 522 acres with 75% of the lake being less than 15 feet deep and a maximum depth of 25 feet.  A public access is located at the Ripple River outlet on the west side of the lake.  Development is moderate along most of the shoreline.  Shallow water substrates consist of rock, silt, sand, and muck.  The aquatic plant community is relatively diverse and is integral to maintaining good water quality as well as maintaining healthy fish populations.  Emergent plants such as bulrush are important for shoreline protection, maintaining water quality, and provide essential spawning habitat for bass and panfish species.  Submerged plants provide food and cover needed by fish and other aquatic species.   <br> \n <br> \nElm Island has been regularly stocked with walleyes since 1950.  Although the number and size have varied, the current strategy is to stock 2 lbs per littoral acre in alternate years.  The 2010 walleye catch of 2.4/gill net was the second highest to date.  Past catches averaged 1.3/gill net.  Average length and weight were 17.5\" and 2.1 lbs. <br> \n <br> \nThe northern pike catch was average when compared to similar lakes at 9.6/gill net in 2010.  Past catches have ranged from 3.2 to 14.3/gill net with an average of 8.1/gill net.  Average length and weight were 20.9\" and 2.3 lbs with 21% measuring at least 24\".   <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch are an important forage species for the lake's game fish.  Though the 2010 catch of 8.3/gill net was the second lowest to date, it is still average when compared to similar lakes.  <br> \n <br> \n Crappies continue to be present in high numbers at 14.2/gill net.  A strong 2006 year class averaged 7.3\" at the time of sampling and should provide good fishing for the next few years. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Elm Island Lake is located about six miles southeast of Aitkin and is part of the Ripple River chain of lakes.  There is a small public access on the west shore near the lake's outlet.  The earthen ramp and relatively shallow depth limit the size of watercraft able to be launched.  Winter access is also limited due to flowing water at the outlet, which creates poor ice conditions that make vehicle travel from the access unsafe.  The lake provides good opportunities for panfish and northern pike fishing with some anglers able to catch a few walleyes at certain times of the year.   <br> \n <br> \nPanfish species have significantly different population characteristics, which have persisted throughout the history of fisheries surveys at Elm Island Lake.  Black crappie are abundant, grow slowly, and rarely exceed 10\".  On the other hand, bluegill are relatively low density, grow quickly, and commonly reach larger sizes.  The combination of the two populations provides ample harvest opportunity for crappie, as well as a quality size component for bluegill, each of which is desirable to anglers.  The abundance of harvestable black crappie may help to preserve the favorable size structure of the bluegill population by buffering exploitation of larger individuals.  Selective harvest of bluegill is encouraged to maintain their quality size structure.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike abundance was within the expected range for this type of lake and similar to the Elm Island Lake historic average.  Pike size structure was good with fish ranging from 15.9 to 34.0\" and averaging 22.8\" and 3.0 pounds.  Larger pike play an important role in regulating survival and growth of various species.  Anglers are encouraged to release pike greater than 24\" to help protect the vital function these fish provide in the ecosystem and to allow additional opportunities for others through recycling these sporting fish. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye stocking has occurred regularly since the 1970's at various frequencies, sizes, and densities of fish, but has produced only limited success.  Lakes with similar physical characteristics typically support a low density walleye population and while the 2013 catch was low, it was still within the expected range for similar lakes.  Historic catches from the nine previous surveys of this lake have ranged from 0.1 to 2.7 per gill net.  <br> \n <br> \nMaintaining habitat is important for both fish and wildlife resources.  In addition to the excellent stands of wild rice and the generally sparse bulrush along the shoreline, coarse woody habitat such as fallen trees and branches offer additional habitat that should be left in place for the benefit of most fish species in Elm Island Lake.  While it can be inconvenient when a tree falls into one's dock or swimming area, consider moving it to an area along your shoreline that is clear of your activity, rather than removing it from the lake.  Benefits of good habitat stewardship are often rewarded with good fishing. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Elm Island Lake is located about six miles southeast of Aitkin and is part of the Ripple River chain of lakes. There is a small public access on the west shore near the lake's outlet. The earthen ramp and relatively shallow depth limit the size of watercraft able to be launched. Winter access is also limited due to flowing water at the outlet, which creates poor ice conditions that make vehicle travel from the access unsafe. The lake provides good opportunities for panfish and Northern Pike fishing, with some anglers able to catch a few Walleyes at certain times of the year.  <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie and Bluegills in Elm Island Lake have significantly different population characteristics, which have persisted throughout the history of fisheries surveys. Black Crappie are abundant, grow slowly, and rarely exceed 10\". On the other hand, Bluegill are relatively low density, grow quickly, and commonly reach larger sizes. The combination of the two populations provides ample harvest opportunity for Black Crappie, as well as a quality size component for Bluegill, each of which is desirable to anglers. The abundance of harvestable Black Crappie may help to preserve the favorable size structure of the Bluegill population by buffering exploitation of larger individuals. Selective harvest of Bluegill is encouraged to maintain their quality size structure.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike abundance has decreased somewhat since the previous survey but is within the expected range for this type of lake and similar to the Elm Island Lake historic average. Pike size structure remained good with fish ranging from 10.1 to 31.0\" and averaging 21.0\" and 2.2 pounds. Larger pike play an important role in regulating survival and growth of various species. Anglers are encouraged to release pike greater than 26\" to help protect the vital function these fish provide in the ecosystem and to allow additional opportunities for others through recycling these sporting fish. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye stocking has occurred regularly since the 1970's at various frequencies, sizes, and densities of fish, but has produced only limited success. Lakes with similar physical characteristics typically support a low density Walleye population. The 2019 catch was 1.4/gill net, which is near the long term average and within the expected range for similar lakes. Historical catches from nine previous surveys of Elm Island Lake have ranged from 0.1 to 2.7 per gill net.  <br> \n <br> \nMaintaining habitat is important for both fish and wildlife resources. In addition to the excellent stands of wild rice and the generally sparse bulrush along the shoreline, coarse woody habitat such as fallen trees and branches offer additional habitat that should be left in place for the benefit of most fish species in Elm Island Lake. While it can be inconvenient when a tree falls into one's dock or swimming area, consider moving it to an area along your shoreline that is clear of your activity, rather than removing it from the lake. Benefits of good habitat stewardship are often rewarded with good fishing. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Elm Island Lake is located about six miles southeast of Aitkin and is a popular destination for many local anglers.  Summer anglers target northern pike, black crappie, bluegill and walleye, while winter anglers primarily target black crappie. Northern pike showed a wide range of sizes available to the angler with several fish over 25 inches in length sampled during the survey.  Black crappie were abundant in the lake and primarily less than 6 years of age which should provide successful angling for several years.  Bluegill were also abundant with several year classes contributing to the fishery.  With younger year classes contributing heavily to the population, the average size bluegill appears to be small despite the presence of several memorable sized individuals captured during the survey. The public access, which is located on the Ripple River by the lakes outlet, is unsafe for vehicular traffic in the wintertime.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Elm Island Lake is located about six miles southeast of Aitkin and is a popular destination for local anglers.  Summer anglers target northern pike, black crappie, bluegill and walleye, while winter anglers primarily target black crappie.  The public access, which is located on the Ripple River by the lakes outlet, is a drop in type access and is unsafe for vehicular traffic in the wintertime. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie abundance increased since the last survey, with 9 different year-classes present up to 13 years old.  The average size was only 6.8 inches long, but the large 2006 year class brought the average down.  Eleven percent of the population was over 9 inches, and growth rates are average for Aitkin County, so they should continue to grow into acceptable sized fish. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill averaged one-third of a pound, which is well above the average size for this lake type.  Fish up to 9 years old were sampled with an average length of 7.1 inches, and maximum length of 9.4 inches.   While catches were below average for this lake type, the growth rates are the similar or higher than the county wide average.   This is a more desirable condition than having a high catch rate and a low average size, which is common at other lakes in Aitkin County.  Elm Island Lake is one of few lakes in the county that has the potential to produce memorable sized bluegill. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike are abundant, but the average size is still above the statewide average for this lake type.  In addition, twenty percent of the catch was over 24 inches in length.  These larger pike are an important component of the fish community and we continue to encourage their release, which help control recruitment of small northern pike in the population.  Fish communities dominated by small northern pike often result in degraded panfish populations and limit success of fingerling walleye stocking. We do not want the population to become skewed towards small northern pike. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance has increased since the survey in 2003.  The average size, 15.7 inches, is small, but all the fish were four years of age and younger, so they will continue to grow and provide good angling opportunities in the future.  The walleye population in Elm Island Lake is maintained by stocking.  All walleye captured in 2008 were from recent years that received fingerling stocking.  Fry stocking that occurred between 1999 and 2002 had been largely unsuccessful. It is uncertain yet whether the increase in fingerling stocking rate, beginning in 2006, will result in an increase in walleye abundance.   <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of nearshore fish species in Elm Island Lake was conducted on July 30, 2019 by DNR Fisheries staff.  Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot seine or 15-foot seine, where possible.  Backpack electrofishing was completed at all fourteen sampling stations, but two stations were sampled from the boat due to site conditions.  Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample three stations, a 15-foot seine was used to sample eight stations, and site conditions prevented the use of seines at three stations.  Nearshore sampling captured 18 species of fish including three species that are intolerant of disturbance (i.e., Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, and Rock Bass) and one species that are tolerant of disturbance (i.e., Black Bullhead). <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore data were combined with trap net and gill net data from a June 2019 survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based IBI (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment.  In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g., Blackchin Shiner and Rock Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g., Black Bullhead).  The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake.  For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.   <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Mississippi River (Brainerd) Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Elm Island Lake is located about six miles southeast of Aitkin and is part of the Ripple River chain of lakes. There is a small public access on the west shore near the lake's outlet. The earthen ramp and relatively shallow depth limit the size of watercraft able to be launched. Winter access is also limited due to flowing water at the outlet, which creates poor ice conditions that make vehicle travel from the access unsafe. The lake provides good opportunities for panfish and Northern Pike fishing, with some anglers able to catch a few Walleyes at certain times of the year.  <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie and Bluegills in Elm Island Lake have significantly different population characteristics, which have persisted throughout the history of fisheries surveys. Black Crappie are abundant, grow slowly, and rarely exceed 10 inches. On the other hand, Bluegill are relatively low density, grow quickly, and commonly reach larger sizes. The combination of the two populations provides ample harvest opportunity for Black Crappie, as well as a quality size component for Bluegill, each of which is desirable to anglers. The abundance of harvestable Black Crappie may help to preserve the favorable size structure of the Bluegill population by buffering exploitation of larger individuals. Selective harvest of Bluegill is encouraged to maintain their quality size structure.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike abundance has increased since the previous survey and is on the upper range for this type of lake and above the Elm Island Lake historic average. Pike size structure remained good with fish ranging from 13.8 to 31.5 inches and averaged 22.8 inches and 2.7 pounds. Larger pike play an important role in regulating survival and growth of various species. Anglers are encouraged to release pike greater than 26 inches to help protect the vital function these fish provide in the ecosystem and to allow additional opportunities for others through recycling these sporting fish. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye stocking has occurred regularly since the 1970's at various frequencies, sizes, and densities of fish, but has had only limited success. Lakes with similar physical characteristics typically support a low density Walleye population. The 2023 catch rate of 1.2 per gill net was near the long-term average and within the expected range for similar lakes. Historical catch rates from ten previous surveys of Elm Island Lake have ranged from 0.1 to 2.7 per gill net.  <br> \n <br> \nMaintaining habitat is important for both fish and wildlife resources. In addition to the excellent stands of wild rice and the generally sparse bulrush along the shoreline, coarse woody habitat such as fallen trees and branches offer additional habitat that should be left in place for the benefit of most fish species in Elm Island Lake. While it can be inconvenient when a tree falls into one's dock or swimming area, consider moving it to an area along your shoreline that is clear of your activity, rather than removing it from the lake. Benefits of good habitat stewardship are often rewarded with good fishing. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of nearshore fish species in Elm Island Lake was conducted on August 6, 2023 by Aitkin Area Fisheries staff.  Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible.  Backpack electrofishing was completed at all fourteen sampling stations, but six stations were sampled from the boat due to site conditions. Only eight stations were suitable for seine netting. A 50-foot seine was used to sample two stations and a 15-foot seine was used at six stations. Nearshore sampling captured 17 species of fish including three species that were intolerant of disturbance (ie., Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, and Rock Bass) and one that was tolerant of disturbance (ie., Black Bullhead). <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore data were combined with trap net and gill net data from a August 2023 survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based IBI (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment.  In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g., Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, and Rock Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g., Black Bullhead).  The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake.  For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.   <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey indicates Elm Island Lake is in good health as indicated by an FIBI score above the impairment threshold for aquatic life used determined for similar lakes. Data from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to Mississippi River (Brainerd) Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency. <br> \n</p>",

Northern pike (54 of 55 aged) ranged from two to eight years of age with strong year classes indicated for 1987 and 1988.  Growth rates for the fourth through the eighth annual increments were slower than normal. Bluegill (45 of 115 aged) ranged from two to eight years of age with strong year classes indicated for 1987 and 1988.  Growth rates for the third and fourth annual increments were faster than normal.  Black crappie (58 of 157 aged) ranged from two to eight years of age with strong year classes indicated for 1987, 1988, and 1989.  Growth rates were normal.  Yep (42 of 151 aged) ranged from three to seven years of age with a strong year class indicated for 1989.  The growth rate for the first annual increment was slower than normal. Growth rates for other annual increments were normal.  Walleye (24 of 24 aged) ranged from three to eight plus years of age with strong year classes indicated for 1986 and 1989.  The 1986 year class corresponds to a stocking of approximately 10,000 (25/lb) walleye fingerlings.  The strong 1989 year class corresponds to a fingerling stocking in 1989 and a yearling stocking in 1990.  The lack of fish sampled from the 1987 and 1988 year classes indicates poor recruitment from natural reproduction.  The lack of fish from the 1988 year class is particularly important in that data from other area lakes indicate that 1988 was a good year for walleye spawning success and recruitment. Growth rates for the second and third annual increments were faster than normal.  Yellow bullhead, brown bullhead, and bluegill trap net catches decreased from the 1986 assessment to the 1992 survey (Wilcoxon's signed rank test: yellow bullhead, p=0.0684, n=12; p=0.0025, n=12; bluegill, p=0.0229, n=12).  Yellow perch and walleye gill net catches increased from the 1986 assessment to the 1992 survey (Wilcoxon's signed rank test: yep, p=0.0092, n=9; walleye, p=0092, n=9).</p>",

This survey was completed in addition to the standard resurvey conducted the week of June 24, 2013.  Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake (14 stations) and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible.  Species information was gathered as part of a statewide project to evaluate the fish Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) for Minnesota lakes.  <br> \n <br> \nBackpack electrofishing was completed at all 14 stations, but five sites were sampled from the boat due to unstable footing.  A 15-foot seine was used at 5 stations, and site conditions prevented the use of seines at 9 sites.  Nearshore sampling captured relatively few species of fish including bluegill, fathead minnow, Johnny darter, largemouth bass, rock bass, and yellow perch.  The preliminary IBI score (per Drake and Pereira, 2002) calculated from this survey, and using standard gill net and trap net data from the resurvey, was 62. <br> \n</p>",

The average length was 7.5 inches and 17% of the fish were greater than 9 inches.  Black crappie year classes of 1995 through 1992 were strong.  The lake a has good population of northern pike with fish up to 30 inches measured.  The northern pike ranged in age from one to seven years with strong year classes indicated in 1996 and 1995.  Bluegill ranged from two to seven years of age and their abundance was low.  However, the  average length of a typical bluegill was 7.5 inches, and over 50% were greater than 7 inches.  Pumpkinseed sunfish were also sampled in the trap nets and averaged 6.25 inches in length.  Walleye ranged from two to ten years of age with year classes present from the 1996, 1994, and 1992 fingerling stockings.  The lack of fish sampled from non-stocking years indicates poor natural recruitment in this lake.  Walleye abundance indicated by gill net catches were in the normal range for this lake type.  Abundance of yellow perch was average.  The 1994 year class of yellow perch was strong.  This species provides a good forage base for the northern pike and walleye.  Yellow, black, and brown bullheads were all sampled during the survey.  Yellow and black bullheads numbers were lower than average.  Brown bullheads were sampled within its species normal range for abundance and were larger than average.  Bowfin (dogfish) were sampled in average numbers.</p>",

Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible.  Backpack electrofishing was completed at all 14 sampling stations, but 3 stations were sampled from the boat due to site conditions. Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample 8 stations, a 15-foot seine was used at 2 stations, and site conditions prevented the use of seines at 4 stations.  Nearshore sampling captured 14 species of fish including 2 species that are intolerant of disturbance (Logperch and Rock Bass) and 1 that is tolerant of disturbance (Fathead Minnow). <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore fish data was combined with gill net and trap net data from a June 2013 survey to describe the fish community and provide a fish-based Index of Biological Integrity (FIBI) score based on expectations for similar lakes.  Data from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to a watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.  Elm Island Lake is located in the Mississippi River-Brainerd Watershed.</p>",
