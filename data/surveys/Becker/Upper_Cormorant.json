                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of nearshore fish species in Upper Cormorant Lake was conducted on August 22, 2022, by Detroit Lakes Area Fisheries Staff.  Data collected during this nearshore survey were combined with trap net and gill net data to calculate a Fish-based IBI (FIBI) score for the lake. <br> \n <br> \nThe FIBI Tool-2 was used for scoring and resulted in a FIBI score of 40.  The previous score for Upper Cormorant Lake was 27 in July 2017.  The impairment threshold score is 45, suggesting that the fish population in Upper Cormorant Lake does not meet expectations for lakes of similar characteristics, and the fish community of Upper Cormorant Lake is affected by disturbances within the watershed or along the shoreline of Upper Cormorant Lake.  Data from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Otter Tail River Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.  The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake.  For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>The current northern pike gillnet catch-rate has not changed since the previous survey (1988).  At 3.38/GN it is between the first and third quartile for this lake class (#32).  A large year class of three-year-olds comprises the bulk of the population.  Northern pike growth rate appears to be somewhat above average.  Earlier surveys ('63, '76, and '83) found a greater abundance of northern pike but smaller average size.  The current PSD and RSD indicate a moderately good size structure, PSD=43, and RSD(30)=10.Black, yellow, and brown bullheads are all present and abundant for this lake class.  Despite the presence of grubs that make them somewhat less marketable, they have been routinely harvested by commercial fishermen since the late 1950's.  Current test net data indicates they are perhaps more abundant now than they were in the past.  The most recent commercial harvest occurred in 1987.The trapnet catch for bluegills, above the third quartile value for this lake class in the previous two surveys (49.80/TN and 57.90/TN) is currently between the first and third quartile at 25.58/TN.  The apparent decline in abundance has not been accompanied by an improvement in size.  In fact, average size continues to decline.  What was a desirable size structure in 1976, PSD=84 and RSD(8)=22, has declined since then to the current PSD=26 and RSD(8)=0.  Bluegill growth rate is slow.  A slow growth rate requires only modest fishing pressure to effectively suppress PSD and RSD values.  Reduced growth rate is often a result of intraspecific competition in an over-abundant population, but that does not appear to be the case here.  Bluegill abundance is moderate, and the factors inhibiting growth are not apparent.Past netting data indicates that this lake has historically supported modest populations of largemouth bass and black crappies.  Current netting results are not significantly different.  Although sample size is small, growth rate for both species appears to be normal.  Anglers have periodically reported good black crappie fishing.In only one survey, the 1976 survey, has yellow perch gillnet data indicated a population above the first quartile value for this lake class.  All others have been below the first quartile, as in the current survey (3.12/GN).  This historically small yellow perch population still appears to play a vital role in the fish community.  Stomach contents from many of the walleyes taken in test nets during the current survey revealed that YOY yellow perch are an important food item in their diet.The current walleye gillnet catch-rate of 8.88/GN is over double the third quartile value for this lake class.  It is greater than the previous survey's 6.00/GN but is not sufficient to indicate a \"significant\" increase in abundance.  Nearly annual walleye stocking from the mid-40's through the 70's and biennial stocking from 1980 to the present, has, for the most part, sustained the population at a level above the third quartile value.  Major year classes in the current survey coincide with walleye fingerling/yearling stocking.  Natural reproduction appears to be minimal.  Walleye growth rate is normal.  The current population, PSD=51 and RSD(20)=6, represents a moderately good size structure that should appeal to anglers.Standard lake survey test nets are not reliable indicators of carp abundance.  Only ten carp were taken in the current survey's nets but large numbers were observed by the survey crew in shallow water.  Carp were first observed in the 1976 survey and a removal effort by Cormorant Lakes Sportsmen's Club began in 1989.  Survey crew observations suggest that carp numbers continue to grow.  An increasing carp population and the availability of substantial carp habitat throughout this chain of lakes is a potential threat to future water quality and gamefish communities.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Upper Cormorant is a popular, all-around fishing lake located in southwestern Becker County.  This 856-acre lake is part of a chain of lakes that has been affected by high water levels during recent years.  Two narrow channels that may not be navigable during lower water years connect Upper Cormorant Lake with Rossman Lake and Nelson Lake to the east.  Upper Cormorant has a diverse fish community that offers anglers a variety of fishing opportunities. <br> \n <br> \nTop predators include northern pike, walleye, and largemouth bass.  Pike were present in numbers typical for this lake.  Although northern pike growth rates are good in Upper Cormorant, few large pike were found.  Eighty percent of sampled pike were age three or younger.  Test net catches of walleye were near the lake's historical average at 7.9 per set in 2012.  The average weight of a sampled walleye was 1.5 pounds.  Walleye fingerlings are stocked in this lake annually to supplement very limited natural reproduction. <br> \n <br> \nBluegills and black crappies are also common.  Although bluegills are somewhat slow growing in this lake, there were enough older fish present to provide opportunities to catch good numbers of bluegills over seven inches in length.  The black crappie sample was comprised of fish from several year classes, but none was particularly strong compared to the others.  The average size of Upper Cormorant crappies was 8.5 inches or a little under a half pound.  Some crappies over a pound were also found. <br> \n <br> \nInformation provided by the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency and this survey indicates that Upper Cormorant is eutrophic.  This means that the lake is fertile and productive.  However, an increasing trophic state also increases algal blooms and decreases water clarity.  The aging rate of a lake can increase with shoreline development and certain watershed uses.  Lakeshore and watershed property owners help to slow the aging process and protect water quality by using shore land best management practices.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Upper Cormorant Lake is an 856-acre lake located in southwestern Becker County.  It consists of a main basin and a long, narrow, northern arm with several shallow bays.  Two narrow channels, not navigable in low water years, provide access to Rossman and Nelson Lakes to the east.  Upper Cormorant Lake is relatively shallow (29-foot maximum depth).  There is a state-owned access on the west shore of the southernmost bay.  A standard fisheries survey was conducted in Late August 2022 to assess the fish populations at Upper Cormorant Lake. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance was similar to past surveys and the lake's average.  The average length of sampled Walleyes was 18 inches, but fish up to 23.0 inches were captured.  Northern Pike abundance was at a record high in 2022.  Pike ranged from 13 to 35 inches in length with an average of 21 inches.  Sixteen percent of the Northern Pike sampled were 24 inches or greater.  Bluegill abundance was below average, but size was respectable.  Bluegill up to almost 9 inches long were found and 25% of the fish measured were eight inches or longer.  Black Crappie abundance was also below average in 2022.  Crappie average length was 10 inches and fish up to 13 inches long were sampled.  Largemouth Bass were also captured in survey nets, with fish having an average length of 14 inches.  Yellow Perch have always been found in low abundance in fisheries surveys, and 2022 was no exception.  Other fish species sampled in 2022 included Brown and Yellow Bullhead, Common Carp, Green Sunfish, Pumpkinseed, and White Sucker.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Upper Cormorant is a popular, all-around fishing lake located in southwestern Becker County.  This 856-acre lake is part of a chain of lakes that has been affected by high water levels during recent years.  Two narrow channels that may not be navigable during lower water years connect Upper Cormorant Lake with Rossman Lake and Nelson Lake to the east.  Upper Cormorant has a diverse fish community that offers anglers a variety of fishing opportunities. <br> \n <br> \nTop predators include northern pike, walleye, and largemouth bass.  Pike were present in numbers typical for this lake.  Although northern pike growth rates are good in Upper Cormorant, few large pike were found.  Half the sampled pike were attributed to the 2005 year-class (age two).  Test net catches of walleye were near the lake's historic average at 6.2 per set in 2007.  The average weight of a sampled walleye was 1.7 pounds.  Walleye fingerlings are stocked in this lake annually to supplement very limited natural reproduction. <br> \n <br> \nBluegills and black crappies are also common.  Although bluegills are somewhat slow growing in this lake, there were enough older fish present to provide opportunities to catch good numbers of bluegills over seven inches in length.  The black crappie sample was comprised of fish from several year classes, but age four crappies made up one-third of sampled fish.  The average size of Upper Cormorant crappies was 9.6 inches or about a half pound. <br> \n <br> \nInformation provided by the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency and this survey indicates that Upper Cormorant is eutrophic.  This means that the lake is fertile and productive.  However, an increasing trophic state also increases algae blooms and decreases water clarity.   <br> \n <br> \nThe aging rate of a lake can be increased by shoreline development.  Lakeshore and watershed property owners can help to slow the aging process and protect water quality by using shore land best management practices.  Two excellent sources are available to help landscape in ways that do the least damage and have the most benefit to the lake's water quality, fish community, and property values.  \"Lakescaping for Wildlife and Water Quality\" and the computer CD \"Restore Your Shore\" are available through the Minnesota Bookstore.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Upper Cormorant is an 856-acre, class 25 lake located in southwestern Becker County.  It consists of a main basin and a long, narrow, northern arm with several shallow bays.  Two narrow channels, not navigable in low water years, provide access to Rossman and Nelson Lakes to the east.  Upper Cormorant is relatively shallow (29 foot maximum depth) and summer stratification rarely occurs.  No thermocline was present in August 2017.  The ecological status of Upper Cormorant Lake is eutrophic, as determined by measures of total phosphorus, water transparency, and chlorophyll-a. <br> \n <br> \nThe 2017 Northern Pike gill net catch rate of 4.9 fish per net was just below the lake's historical mean of 5.0 per net.  Net catches of Northern Pike have remained relatively consistent over time and within the expected range for similar lakes.  Sampled Northern Pike ranged from 16.9 to 31.1 inches in length with a mean of 21.3 inches.  The Northern Pike population in Upper Cormorant appears to have consistent recruitment, but suffers from high mortality of adult fish.  Despite the historically consistent presence of fish longer than 30 inches, age frequencies have been remarkably young.   <br> \n <br> \nGill net catches of Walleye have also remained relatively stable over time.  The 2017 gill net catch rate of 6.8 fish per net was nearly equivalent to the lake's historical mean of 6.9 fish per net.  The mean length of sampled Walleyes was 16.6 inches and the mean weight was 2.0 pounds.  Lengths of Walleye ranged from 8.9 to 26.4 inches.  Natural reproduction has historically been very limited, annual fingerling stocking has occurred since 2005 so evaluation is difficult.   <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch abundance has been historically very low, and was again the case in 2017 when the catch rate was 0.1 fish per net.  Yellow Perch catch rates have ranged from 0.0 to 6.4 fish per net.  This phenomena is quite intriguing considering the overall low abundance of Northern Pike.  <br> \n <br> \nThe trap net catch rate of Bluegill in 2017 of 46.9 fish per net was above the historical mean of 41.1 fish per net for the first time since 1988.  Trap net sampled Bluegills ranged from 2.8 to 11.0 inches in length with a mean of 5.7 inches.  Despite slow growth rates, enough older Bluegills were present so that 33% of the fish sampled were over seven inches in length.   <br> \n <br> \nIn 2017, the Black Crappie catch rate increased to 3.3 fish per trap net, which bested the lake's historical average of 2.3 fish per net for the first time since 2002.  The overall mean length of sampled crappies was 8.5 inches and lengths ranged from 4.8 to 10.6 inches.  Black Crappies grew to an average length of 8.6 inches by age four. <br> \n <br> \nBrown and Yellow Bullhead numbers were fairly high.  Average sizes for both Brown and Yellow Bullhead were about 11-12 inches and 0.75 pounds.  Black Bullheads were not sampled in 2012 or 2017.  <br> \n <br> \nCommon Carp abundance remained low in 2017.  Carp were first caught in assessment nets in 1976.  Although carp habitat appears to be abundant, carp have not increased substantially in numbers or created water quality or fish community problems in Upper Cormorant.  Other fish species sampled in 2012 included Largemouth Bass, Hybrid and Pumpkinseed Sunfish, and White Sucker.   <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Upper Cormorant is a popular, all-around fishing lake located in southwestern Becker County.  This 856 acre lake is part of a chain of lakes that has been affected by high water levels during recent years.  Two narrow channels that may not be navigable during lower water years connect the lake with Rossman Lake and Nelson Lake to the east.  Upper Cormorant has a diverse fish community that offers anglers a variety of opportunities.Top predators include northern pike, walleye, and largemouth bass.  Test net catches of walleye were above the lake's historic average at 8.6 per set in 2002.  Average size of these walleyes was 1.7 pounds.  The walleye population can be partially attributed to natural reproduction or immigration, but, the strongest year class (1999) came from a year in which fingerlings were stocked in Upper Cormorant.  Walleye fingerlings are stocked in this lake every two years to supplement what is believed to be low levels of natural reproduction.Bluegills and black crappies are also relatively abundant.  Although bluegills are somewhat slow-growing in this lake, there were enough older fish present to provide opportunities to catch good numbers of bluegills over seven inches in length.  The black crappie sample was dominated by a very young (one year old) year class.  Some larger crappies are now present, but the 2001 year class may provide greater numbers of nice-sized fish three or four years down the road.Information provided by the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency coupled with this survey showed that Upper Cormorant is categorized as a mesotrophic lake.  This means that the lake is about midway in the aging spectrum between a young, clear, infertile lake (oligotrophic) and an older, turbid, fertile lake (eutrophic).The aging rate of a lake can be increased by shoreline development.  Lakeshore and watershed property owners can help to slow the aging process by using best management practices for all landscaping activities.  For those who are planning to work on their shoreline property, two excellent sources are available to help landscape in ways that do the least damage and have the most benefit to the lake's water quality, fish community, and property values.  \"Lakescaping for Wildlife and Water Quality\" and the computer CD \"Restore Your Shore\" are available through the Minnesota Bookstore.</p>",

This fact may indicate a \"cropping off\" of acceptable fish (over harvest).  Yellow perch are rare, but have never been abundant.  Bluegill have increased in number and decreased in average size in the past several years.  Yellow bullheads are abundant, large and grubby.  Carp numbers have increased significantly since the mid 1970's.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Upper Cormorant Lake is an 856 acre lake in southwestern Becker County.  It consists of a large main basin and a number of shallow bay areas.  Two narrow channels (not navigable in low water years) provide access to Rossman and Nelson Lakes to the east.  It is a moderately fertile lake that has experienced record high water levels in recent years.  Upper Cormorant has a diverse fish community that offers the angler a variety of opportunities.Upper Cormorant's northern pike and largemouth bass populations are about average for lakes of this ecological type while walleye abundance is somewhat above average.  Walleyes sampled in test nets ranged from nine to 25 inches in length.  Sixteen inches was the average length.Bluegill and black crappie are present in average abundance but bluegills exhibit a slow growth rate in Upper Cormorant Lake.  Despite the slow growth rate, enough older bluegills are present that nearly 30% of the bluegills sampled were 7-8 inches in length (\"keeper size\").  Two and three year old fish comprised the bulk of the crappies sampled, indicating some good year class strength for future angling.The recent high water levels on Upper Cormorant Lake make it imperative for lakeshore property owners to practice \"Best Management Practices\" in order to minimize impacts on water quality.  This includes leaving aquatic vegetation in place and establishing shoreland vegetation to prevent erosion and provide protection from nutrient-rich runoff.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A Targeted survey was completed on Upper Cormorant Lake on July 12th and 13th, 2017 to assess the near-shore fish population.  This data will be analyzed in conjunction with the gill net and trap net survey completed in 2017 to provide a complete assessment of the fish community that will be used to evaluate the biological condition of Upper Cormorant Lake, and contribute to the assessment of the watershed.  Sampling gear utilized during this survey targets fish species not commonly sampled by gill nets and trap nets. <br> \nFourteen sites within Upper Cormorant Lake were sampled during this survey.  Electrofishing was conducted at all 14 sites, and seining was completed at nine sites.  Difficult sampling conditions prevented the use of seines at five sites.   <br> \nFifteen native fish species were sampled during this survey, three of which are species that are intolerant of poor habitat conditions (Blackchin Shiner, Banded Killifish, and Iowa Darter).  Carp are present in Upper Cormorant, although they were not sampled during this survey.  The results of this survey, combined with results of the gill net and trap net survey done in 2017, indicate that the fish community in Upper Cormorant Lake does not meet expectations based on the characteristics of the lake. <br> \nShoreline habitat on Upper Cormorant Lake is limited, with very little undeveloped shoreline and a watershed dominated by agriculture use.  </p>",
