Bluegill were captured in the highest abundance of any fish species, but they averaged only 5.6 inches long. Only about 28.0 percent of captured bluegill were 6.0 inches or longer and growth rate was found to be above average. Black crappie were sampled in the second highest abundance of any species and averaged 7.2 inches in length. Northern pike, walleye, Hybrid Muskellunge, and largemouth bass were present in this assessment but in relatively low numbers. All walleye and Hybrid Muskellunge have migrated from other waters in the chain of lakes as neither has ever been stocked in Brownie Lake.</p>",

Panfish were the only sportfish sampled during this assessment.  Nearly 67% of the bluegill population was below 5.5 inches in length, with no fish exceeding 7.0 inches.  Similarly, sampled black crappie did not exceed 7.5 inches.  Ten pumpkinseed sunfish, between 4.0 and 6.0 inches, were additionally sampled.
