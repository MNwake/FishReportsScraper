Walleye population is not changed significantly from past surveys and is about half the statewide median.  Forage does not appear to be the problem but northern pike and panfish predation on young walleyes probably is.  Although the sample is small (10), the best represented walleye year-class is the minimal stocking of 942 yearlings in 1981.  This may indicate that stocking larger fish eliminates some predation.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Eunice is a 325-acre lake located in Becker County eleven miles southwest of the city of Detroit Lakes. Lake Eunice is positioned directly southeast of Maud Lake, separated by County Highway 22. Similar to Maud Lake, Lake Eunice has special regulations for Largemouth Bass, Black Crappie, and Bluegill. Zebra mussels were discovered in the lake in 2015. A standard fisheries survey was completed on Lake Eunice in June 2021. <br> \n <br> \nThe average catch rate of Walleye in Lake Eunice has remained low since the 1950s. Walleye abundance in 2021 appeared to be no different, with only one Walleye captured per gill net. Sampled Walleye ranged in length from 11.7 to 26.1 inches, averaging 16.1 inches long.   <br> \n <br> \nUnlike Walleye, Northern Pike abundance in Lake Eunice has had no issues remaining high. Gill nets in 2021 caught 10 pike per net. Sampled pike ranged in length from 10.2 to 37.6 inches, averaging 17.3 inches long.   <br> \n <br> \nBluegill abundance was below average in 2021, with trap nets catching an average of 24 fish per net. Bluegill ranged in length from 2.5 to 9.1 inches, averaging 5.7 inches long. A six-year-old Bluegill was found to be 5 inches long.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie catch rates have remained low (less than one crappie per trap net) in Lake Eunice since the 1970 survey. In 2021, a total of three crappie were caught during the entire survey. Sampled Black Crappie ranged in length from 9.6 to 11.0 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass are abundant in Lake Eunice. Bass ranged in size from 6.7 to 16.3 inches, and averaged 12.7 inches long. Additional species sampled in 2021 included Yellow Perch, Yellow Bullhead, Black Bullhead, Bowfin, Green Sunfish, hybrid sunfish, Pumpkinseed, Rock Bass, Cisco, and White Sucker. Common Carp are present in Lake Eunice, though none were captured during this survey.   <br> \nAnglers can help maintain and improve Lake Eunice's fishery by harvesting small-moderately sized fish for eating and releasing larger fish, as well as taking precautions to prevent the spread of aquatic invasive species. Shoreline owners can help to improve water quality and fish habit in the lake by maintaining shoreline buffer zones and leaving native aquatic vegetation stands intact. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Eunice has a relatively diverse fishery that ranges from species that prefer cold, clean water (tullibee) to those that prefer warmer, more turbid water (bullhead and carp).  Ecologically, the lake is best suited for northern pike, largemouth bass, and panfish.  In efforts to provide more balanced fish populations with the opportunities to catch large fish, special regulations were implemented for four species in 2008.  Bass have a 12-20 inch protected slot with one fish over 20 inches allowed.  Crappies have a minimum length regulation of 10 inches and a bag limit of five.  Sunfish have a bag limit of five.  Northern pike have a 24-36 inch protected slot with one fish over 36 inches allowed. <br> \n <br> \nTest net catches for bass and northern pike were slightly above the high ends of normal ranges for ecologically similar lakes.  These species, along with bluegills, have generally remained the most abundant among Lake Eunice's fish populations ever since assessments were begun in 1954.  Bluegill catches, however, were down in 2010.  The up side for anglers is that bluegills over eight inches in length are once again present in catchable numbers.  In 1954, 42% of the sampled bluegills in Lake Eunice were over 8.0 inches long.  In 2004, fewer than 1.0% were that length.  In 2010, nearly 8% of sexually mature bluegills were longer than eight inches in length.  Bluegills in Lake Eunice still do not have fast growth rates.  Instead, there was a higher proportion of older bluegills in 2010 than during the previous three decades.  It is not likely that the special bluegill regulation has affected the population this quickly, but it may be having some positive impact. <br> \n <br> \nSmall northern pike are abundant in the lake.  The average length of sampled pike in 2010 was 16.4 inches.  However, the second largest portion of pike over 30 inches in length (historically) was sampled in 2010.  Lake Eunice has some of the necessary components to produce large northern pike.  It has refuge areas with relatively cool, well-oxygenated water during the heat of summer and it has a tullibee (cisco) population.  However, the lake's relatively small size makes it vulnerable to fishing pressure. <br> \n <br> \nA modest walleye fishery in Lake Eunice is sustained by stocking.  Walleye spawning habitat is rare in this lake and natural reproduction is minimal.  Heavier than normal stocking during the 1970's and 1980's did not result in increased test net catches of walleye.  Consequently, the fingerling stocking frequency changed to every third year to maintain a modest fishery.  In 2007, walleye fry stocking was also added every third year to evaluate the success of fry vs. fingerling stocking.  Consequently, the lake is now stocked with walleyes during two of every three years.  Although walleyes have never been considered abundant in Lake Eunice, they tend to run large.  The average weight of walleye sampled in 2010 was 2.8 pounds. <br> \n <br> \nEven though the most abundant gamefish species (northern pike and bluegill) have consistently been smaller than anglers prefer in recent decades, that may be slowly changing with the special regulations.  Anglers are encouraged to adhere to regulations to help foster more balanced fish populations and the opportunity to catch larger fish. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Fisheries Lake Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) program staff conducted a targeted survey of the nearshore fish community on August 1, 2017. Sampling stations were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at all 10 stations, a 50-foot seine was used to sample eight stations, and a 15-foot seine was used at two stations. Nearshore sampling captured 16 native species of fish including five species that are intolerant of habitat disturbance (Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, and Rock Bass) as well as two tolerant species (Black Bullhead and Green Sunfish).   <br> \n <br> \nData from this targeted nearshore survey is combined with data from standard gill and trap netting surveys to calculate a Fish-based Index of Biological Integrity (FIBI) that describes the overall health of the lake.  The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment.  The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.  The FIBI score for Eunice Lake based on this survey is above the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes.  Data from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Otter Tail River Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Eunice has a relatively diverse fish community that ranges from species that prefer cold, clean water (tullibee) to those that prefer warmer, more turbid water (bullhead).  Ecologically, the lake remains best suited for northern pike, largemouth bass, and panfish.Test net catches for bluegill, bass, and northern pike were each above normal ranges for similar lakes.  These species have generally remained the most abundant among Lake Eunice's fish community ever since test netting assessments were begun in 1954.  Of these species, the major change is in the numbers of large bluegills (over 8.0 inches) available.  In 1954, 42% of the sampled bluegills in Lake Eunice were over 8.0 inches long.  In 1999, fewer than 1% were that length.  The most likely reason for the lack of large bluegills in the most recent surveys is what biologists term \"angler exploitation\".  Fishing pressure for bluegills has undoubtedly increased since 1954, when there were only nine cottages on the lake.  Upon reaching what most anglers consider \"keeper\" size, large bluegills are probably harvested.  Since it takes Lake Eunice bluegills about seven years to reach seven inches in length, the big ones are not quickly replaced.  It can be a difficult thing for panfish anglers to do, but, if large bluegills are desired in Lake Eunice, they can only get that way if the larger (seven inches and up) bluegills are voluntarily released and smaller ones are harvested for the frying pan.In addition to the northern pike/bass/panfish fishery, there is a modest fishery for walleye.  Walleyes have never been particularly abundant in the lake but tend to be larger than average.  In 1999, the average weight of sampled walleyes was nearly two and a half pounds.  Unlike the species mentioned above, walleyes generally do not reproduce successfully in Lake Eunice. Experimental heavy stocking during the 1980s failed to increase the walleye population.  It likely provided food for the extremely abundant northern pike population, however.  Since then, they have been stocked as fingerlings every third year to maintain the modest walleye fishery.While several indicators of water quality show that Lake Eunice's is relatively good, there are things lakeshore owners and other watershed dwellers can do to help sustain quality water, fish populations, and property values.  Some of these include: (1) exceeding shoreline setbacks for buildings and septic systems, (2) not fertilizing or using phosphorus free fertilizers, (3) leaving wide shoreline buffer zones of unmowed, natural vegetation, (4) leaving as much aquatic vegetation (especially bulrushes and cattails) intact as possible when obtaining access to open water, (5) actively participating in the lake association, and (6) following practices illustrated in the DNR document \"Lakescaping for Wildlife and Water Quality\" when landscaping shoreline property.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Eunice has a relatively diverse fishery that ranges from species that prefer cold, clean water (tullibee) to those that prefer warmer, more turbid water (bullhead and carp).  Ecologically, the lake is best suited for northern pike, largemouth bass, and panfish.Test net catches for bluegill, bass, and northern pike remained near the high end of normal ranges for ecologically similar lakes.  These species have generally remained the most abundant among Lake Eunice's fish populations ever since assessments were begun in 1954.  Of these species, the major change has occurred in the numbers of bluegills over 8.0 inches.  In 1954, 42% of the sampled bluegills in Lake Eunice were over 8.0 inches long.  In 2004, fewer than 1.0% were that length.  Since bluegills in Lake Eunice are not believed to have had faster growth rates in the past, the most likely reason for the recent lack of large bluegills is that anglers harvest fish as soon as they reach an acceptable size.  Since there is more fishing pressure now than in the past, bluegills are harvested before reaching large sizes.Small northern pike are abundant in the lake.  The average length of sampled pike in 2004 was 18.2 inches, but a few large pike were also found.  Lake Eunice has some of the necessary components to produce large northern pike.  It has refuge areas with relatively cool, well-oxygenated water during the heat of summer and it has a tullibee (cisco) population.  However, the lake's relatively small size makes it vulnerable to fishing pressure.A modest walleye fishery in Lake Eunice is sustained by stocking.  Walleye spawning habitat is rare in this lake and natural reproduction is minimal.  Heavier than normal stocking during the 1980's did not result in increased test net catches of walleye.  Consequently, the lake is stocked every third year to maintain a modest fishery.  While the walleye population has never been considered abundant in this lake, walleyes tend to be large.  The average weight of walleye sampled in 2004 was 1.8 pounds.Even though the most abundant gamefish species (northern pike and bluegill) tend to be smaller than anglers prefer, it may be possible to increase the average sizes of these species.  Anglers are encouraged to release pike over 24 inches long and bluegills over seven inches long.  Voluntary compliance would lead to more balanced fish populations and to the opportunity to catch larger fish.  Experimental regulations for bluegill and northern pike could be considered if public support exists.</p>",

Northern pike and yellow perch populations exploded in number concurrently during the seventies.  Pike are presently about four times the local median in abundance while yellow perch numbers have subsequently declined to the area average.  The dramatic pike increase was undoubtedly a result of heavy \"rescue fish\" stocking during the seventies, but, the reason for perch population fluctation is unclear.  Walleye numbers have traditionally fluctuated at less than the area median and stocking of large fingerlings in '81, '83, '85 and '87 does not seem to have changed this pattern.  Three year classes-'81, '85 and '87-were represented in the minimal net catch.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Fish populations are dynamic in all Minnesota lakes and Eunice is no exception.  Even under the most stable conditions, fish community makeup will fluctuate over time and conditions on Lake Eunice have not been particularly stable.  For instance, the initial lake survey report in 1954 listed only nine homes or cottages on the lake, compared to 141 lake homes in 1994.  Coupled with the sixteen-fold increase in shoreline development was a loss of fish spawning and cover habitat.  In particular, bulrush beds once common along the southwest and mid-west shores (where shoreline development is heavy) are no longer present in those areas.  Other factors that can magnify fluctuations in fish populations include fish stocking and increased fishing pressure, both of which have occurred in Lake Eunice.  Yet, with a few notable exceptions, the lake's fish community is largely the same as it was in 1954, ecologically best suited for northern pike/bass/panfish.Northern pike, bluegill, tullibee, and yellow perch populations in Lake Eunice are all within the \"normal\" range for similar lakes.  Largemouth and rock bass are more abundant than normal and black crappie have all but disappeared from recent samples.  Walleye, even with regular fingerling stocking, remain lower than normal in abundance.  Even the high density stockings of 1981 and 1985 failed to significantly increase walleye numbers.  Northern pike numbers were exceptionally high during those years, as well.  Northern pike are both predator and competitor to walleye.  Although small pike currently dominate the catch, approximately 10% of the sexually mature northern pike in Lake Eunice were longer than thirty inches.The bluegill population contains significantly fewer large fish (over eight inches long) than in 1954, when fishing pressure was less of a factor.  Yet, a few remain.  It is unclear what specifically caused the decline in black crappie abundance.  Increased fishing pressure, stocking of northern pike and walleye, and spawning habitat (bulrush bed) destruction may have all been contributing factors.Bulrushes are valuable not only for fish habitat (spawning, rearing, feeding, and cover), but also for erosion protection, water quality improvement, and waterfowl habitat.  Remaining stands deserve utmost protection for the good of the lake.  Additionally, where native aquatic plants have been removed, conditions are favorable for invasion of exotic species.  Where new plant species have been introduced to a lake, for instance, the initial tendency is for that plant to occupy disturbed areas where native vegetation has already been removed rather than to invade healthy stands of native plants.To summarize, fish populations in Lake Eunice, and most other lakes, are in a constant state of change and are affected by many factors.  Watershed land and water management practices, shoreline alterations, riparian land use, vegetation removal, weather patterns, fish stocking, fish removal, fishing pressure, and other factors act together to impact the fish community in the lake.  Though shifts in fish populations have occurred during recent history, the basic ecological type of the lake has remained the same.  Lake Eunice's fish community continues to be dominated by the species for which it is best suited; pike, bass, and panfish.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Eunice is a heavily-developed, 325-acre, class 31 lake located approximately eight miles south of Audubon, MN.  Despite drastic increases in shoreline development and the destruction of extensive areas of bulrush, the fish community remained resilient and similar to what it was 50 years ago, except that Bluegill and Black Crappie populations have declined.  The lake remains ecologically best suited for Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, and panfish.  Cisco are present in modest numbers and Walleyes have been frequently stocked since the 1940's to provide additional fishing opportunities.  Special regulations have existed for Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, Bluegill, and Black Crappie since 2008. <br> \n <br> \nGill net catch rates for Northern Pike averaged were quite low during the first two surveys in 1954 and 1970.  Since then, catch rates have remained at higher levels with the historical mean of 12.3 fish per net.  In 2016, the catch rate for Northern Pike in Lake Eunice was 15.89 fish per net which was an increase from the last two surveys.  Northern Pike of various sizes were stocked irregularly from 1941 through 1978, but none have been stocked since.  Northern Pike sampled in 2016 exhibited a wide variety of length and age groups indicating adequate natural reproduction.  Lengths ranged from 10.0 to 38.4 inches with a mean of 16.4 inches.  The Northern Pike population was dominated by young fish as 91% of the aged sample were less than 4 years of age.  Northern Pike grew to an average length of 19.4 inches by age four.  A regulation requiring anglers to release all pike from 24 to 36 inches went into effect in 2008.  The goal of this regulation is to increase the size of Northern Pike in the population.  Although this is only the second survey since the regulation went into effect, the number of pike over 24 inches was not found to have increased in 2016 compared to previous surveys.  <br> \n <br> \nLake Eunice's Walleye catch rates have remained relatively low and stable for fifty years.  The historical mean gill net catch rate is 1.2 Walleyes per net.  The 2016 catch rate was 0.8 Walleyes per net.  The mean length of these Walleyes was 21.6 inches and lengths ranged from 19.6 to 28.5 inches.  Heavy Walleye fingerling stocking at rates during the late 1970's and early 1980's did not appear to boost the population.  A Walleye fingerling stocking frequency of every third year has been in effect since 1996 with no discernable effect on Walleye abundance.  In order to compare the potential success of Walleye fry vs. fingerling stocking, fry stocking was added in 2007 with a frequency of one year in three.  Again, there has been no discernable difference in the Lake Eunice Walleye population before these life stage and frequency changes.  <br> \n <br> \nBluegill catch rates increased to 15.6 fish per net following the historic low of 8.7 per net in 2010, but remain well below the historic average of 49.4 fish per net.  The mean length of Bluegills sampled in trap nets in 2016 was 5.9 inches, and ranged 2.6 to 8.9 inches.  A targeted survey using trap nets one month prior captured larger Bluegills on average (8.0 inches) than this survey with 88% of sampled Bluegills larger than 7.0 inches.  No exceptionally strong year classes were evident, but good numbers of four to nine-year-old Bluegills were found.  Bluegills up to 11 years of age were sampled.  Lake Eunice Bluegills have been considered abundant and slow-growing since the initial lake survey.  The average Bluegill length at age four in 2016 was 3.7 inches.  The potential for Lake Eunice to produce quality-sized Bluegills led to a special regulation that limited the bag limit to five Bluegills.  The goal of this regulation was to increase Bluegill size.  Preliminary evidence suggests that while Bluegill abundance continues to be down in 2016, this regulation is having some success at increasing the overall size of Bluegill in Lake Eunice. <br> \n <br> \nNighttime, late-spring electrofishing was conducted in Lake Eunice in 2016 for Black Crappie and Largemouth Bass.  Only ten Black Crappie were sampled with a mean length of 9.6 inches; however, this represents one of the biggest samples of Black Crappie in any survey on Lake Eunice.  No Black Crappies were sampled in the 2010 survey.  Simply put, abundance of Black Crappies in Lake Eunice is low.  These low sample sizes make it difficult to evaluate the success of the special regulation for Black Crappie that consists of a bag limit of 5 and a minimum length limit of 10 inches. <br> \n  <br> \n Sample sizes of Largemouth Bass were lowest in trap nets, with similar numbers from gill nets and electrofishing.  Lengths of Largemouth Bass were also roughly equivalent in all three sampling gears, averaging 12.9 inches in trap nets and 11.3 inches via electrofishing.  Largemouth Bass up to age 18 were sampled.  The average Largemouth Bass length by age four was 10.3 inches, which was similar to growth rates in the past for this lake.  A special regulation exists for Largemouth Bass on Lake Eunice that consists of a protected slot of 12-20 inches with only one over 20 inches allowed in possession.  The goal of this regulation is to increase the size of bass in the population, and the survey in 2016 found that this goal was being achieved. <br> \n <br> \nGill net catches of Yellow Perch declined to a historic low of 0.3 per net in 2004, increasingly slightly to 1.4 perch per net in 2016.  The lake's historic mean is 11.5 perch per net.  The mean length of sampled Yellow Perch was an impressive 10.1 inches. <br> \n <br> \nCisco catch rates dropped to 0.2 fish per net following the historic high of 1.9 per net in the previous 2010 survey.  The lake's historic mean is 0.7 per net.  None were sampled during the initial two studies (1954 and 1970), but they have been found in every assessment since then.   <br> \n <br> \nLake Eunice appears ecologically best suited for Northern Pike and panfish.  Although definite changes have occurred in the fish community during the past 50 years, Largemouth Bass, Bluegill, and Northern Pike remain most abundant and able to rebound from both internal and external influences.  Walleye stocking, using several stocking regimes, has maintained a stable, but relatively low, Walleye population in Lake Eunice. <br> \n</p>",
