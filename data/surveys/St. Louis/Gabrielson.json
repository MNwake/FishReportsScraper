A reclamation was done in 1953 and the lake was managed for trout from 1954 to 1986 by stocking (primarily Rainbow Trout).  Stocking was discontinued in 1986 due to frequent winterkills.  Recent stocking has been geared toward establishing a bass and panfish fishery.  Largemouth Bass were stocked in 1991 (number=15) and in 2014 (n=18).  Black Crappie (n=20) and Bluegill (n=150) were stocked in 2013.     <br> \n <br> \nA special assessment was completed on Gabrielson Lake in June 2014 to assess the success of Bluegill and Black Crappie stocking in 2013.  Six trap net sets caught just four Golden Shiner. No Black Crappie or Bluegill were sampled.  <br> \n <br> \nIn 2015, drastic changes were evident in the fish community.  Surprisingly, again, neither Black Crappie nor Bluegill were sampled.  Northern Pike abundance decreased to 6.5 fish per net compared to 18.0 fish per net in 2010.  Total length of northern pike in gill nets ranged from 9.2 to 21.1 inches; the average length was 13.8 inches which was well below the average of 23.3 inches found in the 1996 investigation.  <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass were present in 2015 but sizes were small since they were only recently stocked.  Total length from the electrofishing sample ranged from 3.4 to 11.8 inches and the average was 5.3.   <br> \n <br> \nWalleye were stocked in 1988.  However, past investigations show no record of Walleye becoming established and none were captured during the 2015 assessment. <br> \n</p>",

Gabrielson Lake was managed for stream trout from 1985 to 1986, primarily by stocking rainbow trout.  Stocking was discontinued in 1986 due to frequent winterkills.   <br> \n <br> \nBluegill and pumpkinseed were first sampled in the population assessment conducted in 1986.  In 2010, one only of each species was captured.  <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass were stocked in 1991.  However, past investigations show no record of bass becoming established and none were captured or observed during the 2010 assessment.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike were very abundant in 2010, likely too abundant for a healthy balance.  Sizes are small and growth is slow.  The mean length in 2010 was 16.4 inches which was well below the mean of 23.3 inches found in the 1996 investigation when abundance was much lower.   <br> \n <br> \nWalleye were stocked in 1988.  However, past investigations show no record of walleye becoming established and none were captured during the 2010 assessment. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

Adult largemouth bass were stocked in 1991, and have apparently provided some fishing opportunity, with fish as large as 3.5 lbs. reported.  Illegal introductions included northern pike, yellow perch, bluegill, pumpkinseed, and golden shiner.  Yellow perch are abundant, but too small to have much value to anglers at this time.  The northern pike are fast growing, but most fish sampled were young, and the average length was 23.3\".  Bluegill appeared stunted.</p>",
