The assessment consisted of 32 survey sites evenly spaced 150 meters around the lake. Assessments were made in three habitat zones: Shoreline Zone (the shore-water interface to the top of the natural bank), Shoreland Zone (land-ward from shoreline to development structure or 100 feet), and Aquatic Zone (lake-ward 50 feet of shoreline). The average lakewide habitat score was 89.3 (?2.6) out of 100 possible. Approximately 53 percent of the sites were developed with a mean score of 85.1 (?4.1), while undeveloped sites had a mean score of 94.1 (?2.6).</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of nearshore fish species in Widow Lake was conducted on July 7, 2021, by Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program staff. Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake, and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at all 10 sampling stations. Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample six stations, a 15-foot seine was used to sample three stations, and site conditions prevented the use of a seine at one station. Nearshore sampling captured 16 species of fish including six species that are intolerant of disturbance (i.e., Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, Least Darter, and Rock Bass) and none that are tolerant of disturbance. <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore data were combined with trap net and gill net data from an August 2020 survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based IBI (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment. In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g., Blackchin Shiner, Least Darter, and Rock Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g., Green Sunfish). The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.  <br> \n <br> \nResults from this survey indicate that the fish community in Widow Lake is healthy as indicated by an FIBI score that exceeds the exceptional use threshold determined for similar lakes. These results will be considered when the biological health of the lake is assessed during the Leech Lake River Watershed assessment process, which will be completed in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Widow Lake (DOW # 11-273: Lake Class 31) is a 180-acre lake located 8.5 miles east of Hackensack, Minnesota. The lake has 2.98 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 46 feet. Widow Lake is in Lake Class 31; lakes in this class are generally clear, productive, and with moderate depths. Nearby lakes in the same lake class are Child, Five Point, and Sanborn.  There is a DNR-owned public access on the south end of the lake off County Road 46. <br> \n <br> \nWidow Lake offers good opportunities for anglers seeking a variety of species that include largemouth bass, black crappie, northern pike, bluegill, yellow perch and walleye. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass are abundant in Widow Lake, but fish greater than 15\" in length are uncommon. Bass sampled in 2006 had an average length and weight of 10.67 inches and 0.89 pounds and lengths ranged from 4.6 to 15.0 inches. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie are moderately abundant. Black crappie sampled from the summer assessment in 2006 averaged 6.7 inches in length and lengths ranged 4.2 to 11.1 inches. Fish greater than 12 inches in length are present in the lake, but are uncommon. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike are moderately abundant and generally are small. Average length and weight of sampled northern pike was 18.2 inches and 1.5 pounds. Fish up to 30.3 inches in length were sampled. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill were moderately abundant, as well. Bluegill mean length and weight was 5.0 inches and 0.1 pounds, and lengths ranged from 3.0 to 7.2 inches. Fish greater than 8 inches in length are present, but are uncommon. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch numbers were down in Widow Lake in 2006. Yellow perch mean length and weight was 6.8 inches and 0.2 pounds, and lengths ranged from 5.6 to 8.7 inches. <br> \n  <br> \nWalleye gill net catch was the highest ever recorded for Widow Lake. Since 1977 there has been an upward trend in walleye gill net catch rates. Walleye mean length and weight was 19.4 inches and 2.4 pounds, and lengths ranged from 15.4 to 26.8 inches. Several age classes were represented in the sample. The walleye population is sustained by natural reproduction. <br> \n <br> \nOther species present that may interest anglers are rock bass, pumpkinseed, and bowfin (dogfish). <br> \n <br> \nAnglers can help maintain or improve the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for table fare, but encourages release of medium- to large-sized fish.  Releasing these fish can help maintain balance in the fish community in Widow Lake and provide anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future.   <br> \n <br> \nShoreline areas on the land and into the shallow water provide essential habitat for fish and wildlife that live in or near Minnesota\u0019s lakes.  Overdeveloped shorelines can\u0019t support the fish, wildlife, and clean water that are associated with natural undeveloped lakes.  <br> \n <br> \nShoreline habitat consists of aquatic plants, woody plants and natural lake bottom soils.  Plants in the water and at the water\u0019s edge provide habitat, prevent erosion and absorb excess nutrients. Shrubs, trees, and woody debris such as fallen trees or limbs provide good habitat both above and below the water and should be left in place.  By leaving a buffer strip of natural vegetation along the shoreline, property owners can reduce erosion, help maintain water quality, and provide habitat and travel corridors for wildlife.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Widow Lake (DOW # 11-273: Lake Class 31) is a 197-acre lake located 8.5 miles east of Hackensack, Minnesota. Widow Lake has 2.98 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 46 feet. There is a DNR-owned public access on the south end of the lake off County Road 46.  <br> \nWidow Lake is in Lake Class 31; lakes in this class are generally clear, productive, and have moderate depth. The lake is primarily managed for Largemouth Bass and Black Crappie, and secondarily for Northern Pike, Bluegill, Yellow Perch, and Walleye. <br> \n <br> \nWidow Lake offers opportunities for anglers seeking a variety of species that include Largemouth Bass, Black Crappie, Northern Pike, Bluegill, Yellow Perch and Walleye. Largemouth bass are abundant in Widow Lake, but fish greater than 15 inches in length are uncommon. Largemouth Bass sampled in 2013 had an average length and weight of 10.3 inches and 0.6 pounds and lengths ranged from 5.0 to 14.7 inches.  Black Crappie are moderately abundant. Black crappie sampled from the summer assessment in 2013 averaged 7.8 inches in length and lengths ranged 4.3 to 11.6 inches. Northern pike are moderately abundant and generally are small, but fish up to 34 inches long were sampled. Average length and weight of sampled Northern Pike was 18.1 inches and 1.5 pounds. Bluegill were moderately abundant as well and the size structure of the Bluegill population has improved over the years to include fish approaching 8 inches long. Bluegill mean length and weight was 6.2 inches and 0.2 pounds, and lengths ranged from 3.0 to 7.9 inches. Yellow perch numbers declined to a record low in Widow Lake in 2013, and subsequently Walleye gill net catches were also the lowest observed since 1984. Yellow Perch play an integral part in the success of Walleye populations. Walleye ranged in length from 19.8 to 27.0 inches. Other species present that may interest anglers are Rock Bass, Pumpkinseed, and Bowfin (dogfish). <br> \n <br> \nPeople can have significant impacts on lakes and the fish populations they support. Harvest, lakeshore development, removal of shoreline vegetation, and introductions of invasive species can all adversely affect fish populations. Currently no aquatic invasive species (AIS) have been identified in Widow Lake. AIS are moved from infested to non-infested waters by anglers, boaters, and lake shore owners and can adversely impact lakes and fish populations. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access. If you suspect an infestation of an invasive species in this lake, save a specimen and report it to a local natural resource office. Additional information on all of these topics can be found on the DNR website (www.dnr.state.mn.us) or by contacting the Walker Area Fisheries office. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Widow (Rice) (DOW# 11-0273; Lake Class 31) is a 198-acre lake with 2.98 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 46 feet located south-west of Longville, MN. There is a DNR-owned public access on the south end of the lake off Cass County Road 46.  The DNR has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different classes based on physical, chemical and other characteristics.  Widow Lake is in Lake Class 31; lakes in this class are generally clear, productive, and have moderate depth.  Nearby lakes in the same lake class are Child, Five Point, and Sanborn. The lake is primarily managed for Largemouth Bass and Black Crappie. Secondary management species include Northern Pike, Bluegill, Walleye and Yellow Perch.  <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass were abundant in Widow Lake in 2020 with over five fish per gill net, the highest catch observed in this lake. Largemouth Bass ranged in length from 4 to 18 inches with an average of 11 inches. Goals for Largemouth Bass are assessed using spring electro-fishing which was not conducted in 2020. Black Crappie were very abundant with over 28 fish per gill net, the highest catch observed to date and nearly three times the next highest gill net catch. The long term management goal of two crappie per trap net was not met in this survey. Black Crappie ranged in length from 5 to 12 inches with an average length of 9 inches. Moderate numbers of Northern Pike were caught during this survey with six fish per gillnet sampled meeting the management goal of 5 to 8 fish per gill net. Northern Pike had a length range of 11 to 33 inches, with an average of 19 inches and two pounds. Bluegill were caught at moderate levels at eight fish per trap net, which was below the management goal of 20-40 fish per trap net. Bluegill had an average length of 5.7 inches and a range of 3 to 8 inches.  Walleye abundance was slightly above the management goal of two fish per gillnet. This catch is an increase over the last survey in 2013. Walleye in 2020 ranged in length from 12 to 28 inches with an average length of 17 inches. Over a quarter of the catch was greater than 20 inches. Walleye are stocked as fingerlings in odd numbered years. Yellow Perch were caught at rate of less than one fish per gillnet below the management goal of at least 10 fish per net.    <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species sampled include, Brown Bullhead, Yellow Bullhead, Rock Bass, Hybrid Sunfish, Pumpkinseed, Bowfin (Dogfish) and Yellow Perch. <br> \n <br> \nPeople can have significant impacts on lakes and the fish populations they support. Harvest, lakeshore development, removal of shoreline vegetation, and introductions of invasive species can all adversely affect fish populations. Currently, no aquatic invasive species (AIS) have been identified in Widow Lake. AIS are moved from infested to non-infested waters by anglers, boaters, and lake shore owners and can adversely impact lakes and fish populations. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access. If you suspect an infestation of an invasive species in this lake, save a specimen and report it to a local natural resource office. Additional information on all of these topics can be found on the DNR website (www.dnr.state.mn.us) or by contacting the Walker Area Fisheries office. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Widow Lake is located 8.5 miles east of Hackensack in northern Cass County.  There is a DNR public access on the south end of  the lake off of County Road 46.  Widow Lake has an area of 180 acres with a maximum depth of 46 feet.  The Minnesota DNR has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different lake classes based on chemical and physical characteristics.  Widow Lake is in lake class 31.  Lakes in this lake class are typically smaller and have moderate depths, and moderate water clarity.  Other area lakes in the same lake class include Child, Five Point, Ox Yoke,      Sanburne, Widow, and Welsh Lakes.  An angler fishing on Widow Lake has an opportunity to catch  a multitude of fish species.  The lake is managed primarily for largemouth bass and black crappie.  There were three years of creel survey conducted on Widow Lake to determine fishing pressure.  Fishing pressure was typical of other lake class 31 lakes.  Northern pike are abundant but small.  Fish were growing slightly slower than other area lake class 31 lakes.  At five years old, Widow Lake northern pike were 23 inches long.Bluegill abundance in the summer sampling was down from what was found in the 1994 survey possibly due to thunderstorms that occurred at the time of the 1999 survey.  Spring sampling of bluegill showed that they were abundant but small.  Few bluegill sampled in either the summer or the spring were over five years old.  To maintain or improve the quality, anglers need to use some restraint if large bluegill  are really biting.  Release the      larger fish and keep the smaller ones for eating.  Quality size bluegill have disappeared from many lakes due to excessive harvest by anglers.Largemouth bass and black crappie are two species that anglers have had good success catching in Widow Lake.  The average size of black crappie sampled in 1999 was the best of any survey conducted on Widow Lake.Walleye were sampled at a rate that was the highest recorded on Widow Lake.  Fish showed a wide range of lengths and ages.  All fish sampled were the result of natural reproduction.  Yellow perch abundance was the highest recorded.  Yellow perch are a common food fish for walleye and other predator fish.Other panfish sampled include rock bass, pumpkinseed sunfish, and yellow perch.There has been much development on Widow Lake.  Most of the shoreline around the lake is privately owned and subject to development.  In 1969 there were 16 lakehomes.  By 1994 the number of lakehomes had increased to 37. Shoreline areas - on the land and into the shallow water - provide essential habitat for fish and wildlife that live in or near Minnesota's lakes.  Overdeveloped shorelines can't support the fish, wildlife, and clean water that are associated with natural undeveloped lakes. The combined effects of all lakeshore owners \"fixing up\" their property can destroy a lake's valuable natural shorelines.Shoreline habitat consists of aquatic plants, woody plants and natural lake bottom soils.  Plants in the water and at the water's edge provide habitat, prevent erosion, and absorb excess nutrients. Shrubs, trees, and woody debris such as fallen trees or limbs provide good habitat both above and below the water and should be left in place.  Natural lake bottom materials like silt or gravel are more ecologically productive than pure sand trucked in for a swimming beach.  A tidy lawn and a sandy beach make great spots for sunbathing and swimming but do little to provide habitat for fish and wildlife. By leaving a buffer strip of natural vegetation along the shoreline, property owners can reduce erosion, help maintain water quality, and provide habitat and travel corridors for wildlife.Only if more lakeshore owners manage their shoreline in a natural condition can fish and wildlife populations on Minnesota lakes remain healthy and abundant.  More specific information on protecting or restoring shorelines and watersheds is available through DNR Fisheries offices.          </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of nearshore fish species in Widow Lake was conducted on June 21-23, 2022 by Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program Staff. Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at all ten sampling stations, but one station was sampled from the boat due to site conditions. Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample seven stations, a 15-foot seine was used to sample two stations, and site conditions prevented the use of seines at one station. Nearshore sampling captured 15 species of fish including six species that are intolerant of disturbance (i.e., Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, Least Darter, and Rock Bass) and no species that are tolerant of disturbance. <br> \n <br> \nA concurrent summer trap net survey was conducted by IBI Program Staff. Nine trap nets were set along the shoreline and in shallow offshore locations that encompassed multiple habitat types. Bluegill, Black Crappie, and Yellow Bullhead comprised a majority of the trap net catch by number and Bluegill, Bowfin, and Black Crappie comprised a majority of the catch by biomass. The number of Bluegill sampled per net was above the 50% quartile for similar Lake Class 31 lakes and the average length was 6.8 inches, with 42% over 7 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore and trap net data were combined with gill net data from an August 2020 survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based IBI (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment. In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g., Blackchin Shiner, Iowa Darter, and Rock Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g., Green Sunfish). The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.  <br> \n  <br> \nData from this survey indicates Widow Lake is healthy as indicated by an FIBI score, well above the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes. Data from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Leech Lake River Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Widow Lake is a 180-acre lake located in northern Cass County.  The lake is about 0.9 miles long and has a maximumdepth of 46 feet.  It has a variety of bottom soil types including sand, silt, and rubble.  Aquatic vegetationis abundant and diverse. The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different lake typesbased on their physical and chemical characteristics.  Widow is in lake class 31.  Other area lakes in this sameclass include Child (2 miles north), Five Point (6 miles southwest), Oxyoke (7 miles southwest), and Sanburn (8miles southwest).  There is a DNR-owned access on the south end of Widow.  Netting surveys have been done fivetimes on Widow from 1969 to 1994, and a survey of anglers, also known as a \"creel survey\" was done in 1994.1994 Creel SurveyThe creel survey of anglers extended from May 14, 1994 (opening day) through September 5, 1994 (Labor Day).Preliminary findings of the 1994 creel survey estimated that 6179 angler-hours (34.3 angler-hours per acre) werespent fishing on Widow during this 115-day period.  Anglers who said that they were fishing for bluegill had acatch rate (including both kept and released fish) of 1.34 bluegill per hour.  Estimated numbers of fish keptincluded 130 black crappie, 2101 bluegill, 324 largemouth bass, 329 northern pike, 88 pumpkinseed sunfish, 335rock bass, and 83 yellow perch.  No walleye were caught by interviewed anglers. 1994 Netting Survey ResultsThe catch rate of bluegill in Widow was within the middle range of catch rates for this type of lake. Most of thebluegill sampled were small: the only about one-fifth were 6 inches or greater, and the largest fish sampled was7.8 inches.  It appears that the average size of bluegill sampled was smaller in 1994 than in most earliersurveys.  Widow Lake bluegill grew slowly: the average length of a bluegill at the time it reached age 5 was just4.1 inches.  The apparent decline in average size of bluegill and slow growth rates are factors that prompted DNR fisheriesbiologists to include Widow in a bluegill research project. This project is investigating regulations designedto increase the harvest of bluegill greater than eight inches.  The three types of regulations being consideredare:     1)   Regulations that influence the bag limit and/or size        limit of bluegill.     2)   Regulations that influence the bag limit and/or size        limit of large predators that feed onbluegill.     3)   Regulations using a combination of both 1 and 2.Pre-regulation data will be collected in 1994 and 1995.  If acceptable to the public, new regulations will beimplemented during 1996.  Monitoring will continue until the year 2001.  Data will then be analyzed and resultswill be used to help manage bluegill in Minnesota. A good sample of largemouth bass were sampled using both summer netting and spring electrofishing.  These basswere generally small with a few larger bass present.  An average 12-inch bass was 5 years old.In 1994 the number of walleye sampled per net was higher than in previous netting surveys.  Most sampled walleyewere older fish with an average size of 20.5 inches and a weight of 3 pounds.  Walleye ranged from 1 to 7 yearsold.  Stocking occurred in only two of these years, so natural reproduction is the main producer of walleye inWidow Lake.Northern pike were sampled in numbers that were comparable to previous surveys.  Northern pike were generallysmall with an average size of 19 inches and 1.5 pounds.  Northern pike natural reproduction appeared to beconsistent, with ages 1 through 6 represented among the sampled fish.To maintain and promote a healthy fish population on this lake, lake shore residents and other users of the lakeshould protect fish habitat by preserving natural aquatic vegetation.  Lake shore residents can also help preserveWidow's water quality by such actions as having a properly built and maintained septic system; by avoiding theuse of lawn or garden chemicals near the lake; and by establishing a buffer strip of natural vegetation alongtheir shoreline.  Anglers can help maintain fishing quality by practicing catch and release of larger fish.    </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>HISTORICALLY THE GILLNET CATCH OF NORTHERN PIKE HAS RANGED FROM 5.2 TI 8.5 PER NET. THE PRESENT GILLNET CATCH OF 6.5 IS WITHIN THIS RANGE. THE 1986 YEAR CLASS CONTRIBUTED 80% OF THE SAMPLE COLLECTED; RANGED IN LENGTH FROM 18 TO 27 INCHES. THE GROWTH RATE FOR NORTHERN PIKE IS GOOD. QUALITY SIZE FISH WERE COLLECTED. THE BULLHEAD POPULATION OF WIDOW LAKE IS MADE UP OF YELLOW BULLHEAD. NO BLACK BULLHEAD WERE COLLEC- TED DURING THIS ASSESSMENT. THE 1989 BLUEGILL TRAPNET OF 56 IS WITHIN THE HISTORICAL RANGE OF 42 TO 62. THERE IS NO OBVIOUS TREND IN THE QUALITY OF THE BLUEGILL POPULATION SINCE THE 1969 ASSESSMENT. THE GROWTH RATE FOR BLUEGILL IS SLOW. CONSIDERING THE TYPES OF SAMPLING GEAR USED FAIR NUMBERS OF BLACK CRAPPIE AND LARGEMOUTH BASS WERE COLLECTED. BOTH SPECIES HAD MOST YEAR CLASSES REPRESENTED IN THE SAMPLE COLLECTED INDICATING CONSISTENT NATURAL REPRODUCTION. THE GROWTH RATE FOR EITHER SPECIES IS NOT FAST. THE YELLOW PERCH POPULATION IS LOW IN WIDOW LAKE. A TOTAL OF 2 FISH IN 6 GILLNETS AND 8 TRAPNETS WERE COLLECTED. THE GILLNET CATCH OF YELLOW PERCH HAS BEEN HIGHER DURING PREVIOUS ASSESSMENTS. PREVIOUS GILLNET CATCHES OF WALLEYE HAVE BEEN LESS THAN ONE PER GILLNET. THE CATCH RATE DURING THIS ASSESSMENT WAS 2.7. ORIGINAL ATTEMPTS TO AGE THESE WALLEYE INDICATED THAT OVER 90% WERE FROM NATURAL REPRODUCTION. LATER, SEVEN SCALE READERS ASSIGNED AGES I+ THROUGH IV+ TO THESE 11 TO 12 INCHES WALLEYE. BECAUSE OF THE INCONSISTENCIES IN AGING AND THE PAST KNOWLEDGE OF THIS LAKE IT IS ASSUMED THAT THE WALLEYE SAMPLED ARE FROM THE 1986 AND 1987 FINGERLING STOCKINGS THOUGH IT IS POSSIBLE SOME OR ALL ARE FROM NATURAL REPRODUCTION.</p>",
