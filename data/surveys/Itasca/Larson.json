                "narrative": "<p>A total of nine fish species were sampled in the population assessment using gill nets and trap nets.  Two of these fish species were stream trout.  Splake were the most abundant with a total of twenty-seven fish sampled and a catch per unit effort (CPUE) of 3.0 in the gill nets and 0.1 in the trap nets  Splake total length (TL) ranged in size from 6.9 to 25.5 inches.  Splake fingerlings were introduced into Larson Lake in 1988 and have been stocked annually.  Scales from splake were collected during the assessment and analyzed.  Splake from each of the stockings were represented.  Age 1 splake made up 48% (12) of the sample, age 2-32% (8), age 3-16% (4), and age 4-4% (1).  Splake have demonstrated fast growth in our limited sample size, with age 1 splake TL ranging in size from 6.9 to 12.4 inches, age 2 from 13.0 to 15.7 inches, age 3 from 19.0 to 22.4 inches and age 4 splake at 25.5 inches.Twelve rainbow trout were sampled with a gill net CPUE of 0.4 and a trap net CPUE of 0.2.  Rainbow trout TL ranged in size from 11.3 to 13.8 inches.  Rainbow trout have been stocked into Larson Lake annually since 1968.  Scales from rainbow trout were collected and analyzed.  All sampled rainbow trout were determined to be yearling trout stocked in spring 1992.Other fish species caught during sampling included:  northern pike, golden shiner, white sucker, black bullhead, tadpole madtom, pumpkinseed and yellow perch.A total of eight northern pike were sampled.  Only one northern pike was sampled in the trap net for a CPUE of <0.1 and the gill net CPUE was 1.0.  The CPUE's for both gear types fall below the statewide mean, and the first quartile of the lake class median.  Northern pike TL ranged in size from 20.6 to 39.2 inches.  Northern pike were determined to be age 1, age 2, and age 6.  Northern pike growth was extremely rapid, with a back-calculated mean length-at-age 1 of 12.9 inches, and a mean lenght-at-age 2 of 23.5 inches.  Larson Lake has a low density, fast-growing population of northern pike.  The fast growth of northern pike can probably be attributed to the large prey base of yellow perch and trout.Three hundred and thirty-two yellow perch were sampled with a gill net CPUE of 29.6 and trap net CPUE of 3.1.  Both trap net and gill net CPUE's are greater than the statewide mean and lake class median.  The gill net CPUE falls well outside the third quartile of the lake class median, while the trap net CPUE is equal to the third quartile of the lake class median.The fish species diversity of Larson Lake is similar to other area lakes that are not managed for stream trout.  Stocked trout species in Larson Lake must, therefore, compete with other fish species for similar prey and avoid northern pike in order to survive and grow to larger sizes. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Larson Lake is located 13 miles east of Effie, MN in the Big Fork River watershed.  The lake has a surface area of 198 acres and a maximum depth of 177 feet.  Larson Lake is in ecological lake class #23.  Other area lakes in this class include Antler, Caribou and Thistledew Lakes.  There is a public access on the west shore at the DNR campground.\n\nThe current lake management plan lists splake and brown trout as the primary species of management.  Splake have been stocked in Larson Lake since 1988.  The current state record splake (13 lbs. 5.4 oz.) was caught from the lake during the winter of 2001.  In 2007, a total of 41 splake were caught in gill nets for a catch rate of 6.8/net.  This is well above the 2002 catch rate of 1.3/net and the management plan goal of 2.0/net.  By comparing the length-frequency distribution of sampled splake against the alternate year stocking regime, it was determined that most of the splake (75.6%) were stocked in the fall of 2006.  These age 1+ fish ranged from 7 to 11 inches.  The remaining splake ranged from 16 to 24 inches and were attributed to the 2004 and 2002 stockings.   \n\nBrown trout yearlings were stocked in the spring of 2005 and 2007.  Only one brown trout (17.8 inches) was sampled in the 2007 assessment, indicating poor survival.  Rainbow trout were stocked as recently as 2003, but none were sampled in this assessment.  Previous surveys indicated poor returns from rainbow trout stocking efforts. \n\nLarson Lake was chemically reclaimed in 1966 to remove undesirable species.  Several undesirable species have become re-established in the lake since that time.  Similar to the previous two assessments, the 2007 gill-net catch rate for yellow perch was high at 33.8/net.  Perch sampled in this assessment were small, ranging from 6.1 to 9.8 inches, with an average length of 7.2 inches.  Yellow perch are thought to be a competitor with stream trout in lakes since they both utilize invertebrates as a primary prey source.  Other species sampled in this assessment included black bullhead, golden shiner, northern pike, pumpkinseed sunfish and white sucker.   \n</p>",

There is a DNR-administered access at the State Campground on the west side of the lake. <br> \n <br> \nThe current lake management plan lists Splake as the primary species of management, with a goal of maintaining a gill-net catch at 2.0/net.  Splake have been stocked in Larson Lake since 1988.  The current state record Splake (13 lbs. 5.4 oz.) was caught from the lake in February 2001.  Splake fingerlings are stocked in the fall in even-numbered years at a rate of 50/acre.  A standard lake survey was conducted in August 2020 to assess the status of the fishery and the effectiveness of the stocking plan.  <br> \n <br> \nGill-net catches for Splake ranged from 0.8 to 6.8/net in previous surveys.  The 2020 gill-net catch was 0.3/net, well below the management plan goal.  The low catch rate suggests poor survival of stocked fingerlings.  A change to stocking a more advanced life-stage (yearlings) could be considered.  The two fish sampled were 10.2 and 30.5 inches.  The largest trout was quickly measured, weighed and released, and weighed approximately 13.65 lbs.  If accurate, this weight would exceed the current state record.   <br> \n <br> \nManagement of other trout species has been attempted in Larson Lake.  Brown Trout yearlings were stocked in the springs of 2005 and 2007.  Brown Trout management was discontinued after these initial stockings failed to produce a fishable population.  Rainbow Trout were stocked as recently as 2003.  Previous surveys indicated poor returns from Rainbow Trout stocking. <br> \n <br> \nLarson Lake was chemically reclaimed in 1966 to remove undesirable species.  Several undesirable species have become re-established in the lake since that time.  Yellow Perch were sampled at 10.5/gill net, up from the previous survey but near the historical average (10.1).    Yellow Perch can be a competitor with stream trout in lakes, since they both utilize invertebrates as a prey source; however, Yellow Perch in Larson Lake also provide a prey source for Splake.  Other species sampled in this survey included Black Bullhead, Northern Pike, Pumpkinseed Sunfish and White Sucker.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Larson Lake is managed primarily for rainbow trout and splake.  Yearling rainbow and fingerling splake have been stocked in alternate years.     Five splake were sampled in gill nets for a catch rate of 0.8/set.  No expected ranges are available for comparison.  The mean length was 15.2 inches, ranging from 8.9 to 22.8 inches.  The mean weight was 2.0 pounds.  The 1992 survey gill net catch rate was 3.0/set, with a mean weight of 1.1 pounds.     The northern pike gill net catch rate (1.3/set) is below the expected range (2.2-8.7/set).  However, the mean weight (6.5 pounds) greatly exceeded the expected range (1.5-3.2 pounds).  Growth rates for pike were greater (>115%) than the statewide mean.     The yellow perch gill net catch rate (16.8/set) exceeded the expected range.  The mean length was 7.3 inches, ranging from 5.7 to 10.2 inches.  Trap nets sampled yellow perch at a rate (3.3/set) that exceeded the expected range for this type of lake, but was significantly down from the catch rate from 1984 (42.7/set).  The mean length of trap net caught yellow perch was 6.9 inches, with a range from 3.5 to 10.3 inches.     White suckers were sampled in gill nets within the expected range with a catch rate of 1.0/set.  Trap net sampled white suckers also was within the expected range, with a catch rate of 0.3/set.     The trap net catch rate for black bullhead (11.6/set) was much greater than the expected rate.     Tadpole madtoms were sampled in trap nets at a rate of 9.1/set, with no expected range for comparison.     Although rainbow trout have been stocked and were sampled in 1992, none were sampled during the 1997 survey.     Other species sampled in test nets include: blackchin and golden shiners, johnny darter, and pumpkinseed.     Anglers have a unique opportunity in fishing Larson Lake.  Large northern pike, rainbow trout, and splake may be caught.  Practicing catch and release fishing will provide great angling opportunities in the future on Larson Lake.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Larson Lake is a class 23 lake located 13 miles east of Effie.  There is a public access on the west shore at the DNR campground.  The lake management plan indicates rainbow trout and splake are the primary species of management at the time of this assessment.  The lake was chemically reclaimed in 1966 to remove undesirable species.Rainbow trout were not sampled in the 2002 assessment despite being stocked in spring of 2001.  The fish were highly stressed at the time of stocking which likely resulted in poor survival.  According to gill-net catch rates, it appears that rainbow trout have never done extremely well in the lake.  Gill nets and trap nets have sampled rainbow trout in the past but competition with other species in recent years, like yellow perch, may be affecting their survival.Splake have been stocked in Larson Lake since 1988.  The current state record was caught from this lake during the winter of 2001.  In 2002, eight splake were caught in gill nets for a catch rate of 1.3 fish/net. These fish ranged in length from 10.2 to 13.8 inches and had a mean length of 12.3 inches.  From the every other year stocking regime it was determined that the splake were stocked in the fall of 2000, making them two plus years old.Yellow perch numbers have been at a distinctly higher level in the last three assessments, ranging from 16.8 to 37.0 fish/gill net.  The three prior assessments from 1970 to 1972 documented a catch rate of 0.0 to 1.0 fish/gill net.  Apparently between 1972 and 1992, yellow perch became well established.  The 2002 catch was at an all-time high of 37.0 fish/gill net.  Yellow perch were typically small with fish ranging from 5.8 to 8.7 inches and averaged 6.9 inches.  Yellow perch are suspected to be a competitor for stream trout in lakes since they both utilize invertebrates as a primary prey source.Other species sampled in 2002 included black bullhead, golden shiner, northern pike, pumpkinseed sunfish, walleye, and white sucker.  The walleye sampled in this assessment was the first ever observed.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Larson Lake is located 12 miles east of Effie, MN in the Big Fork River watershed.  The lake has a surface area of 198 acres and a maximum depth of 177 feet.  Larson Lake is in ecological lake class 23.  Class 23 lakes are relatively small, deep and clear with high alkalinity.  Other area lakes in this class are Bluewater and Caribou Lakes.  There is a DNR-administered access at the State Campground on the west side of the lake. <br> \n <br> \nThe current lake management plan lists Splake as the primary species of management.  Splake have been stocked in Larson Lake since 1988.  The current state record Splake (13 lbs. 5.4 oz.) was caught from the lake in February 2001.  Splake fingerlings are stocked in the fall in even-numbered years at a rate of 50/acre. <br> \n <br> \nThe 2014 gill-net catch for Splake was 2.2/net, near the management plan goal of 2.0/net.  Sampled fish ranged from 10.6 to 23.0 inches.  Comparing the length-frequency distribution of sampled Splake against the alternate-year stocking regime indicated most of the fish were stocked in 2012.  These age 2 fish ranged from 10 to 16 inches.  Two larger Splake (22 to 23 inches) were attributed to the 2010 stocking. <br> \n <br> \nBrown Trout yearlings were stocked in the springs of 2005 and 2007.  Only one Brown Trout (17.8 inches) was captured in the 2007 assessment, indicating poor survival.  Another Brown Trout (27.4 inches) was sampled in 2014.  Brown Trout management was discontinued after these initial stockings failed to produce a fishable population.  <br> \n <br> \nRainbow Trout were stocked as recently as 2003.  Previous surveys indicated poor returns from Rainbow Trout stocking. <br> \n <br> \nLarson Lake was chemically reclaimed in 1966 to remove undesirable species.  Several undesirable species have become re-established in the lake since that time.  Yellow Perch were sampled at 1.8/gill net, down substantially from the 2007 catch rate of 33.8/net.  Yellow Perch can be a competitor with stream trout in lakes, since they both utilize invertebrates as a prey source; however, Yellow Perch in Larson Lake also provide a prey source for Splake.  Other species sampled in this assessment included Black Bullhead, Northern Pike, Pumpkinseed Sunfish and White Sucker.  <br> \n</p>",
