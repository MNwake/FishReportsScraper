A Mr. Stevens, owner of one of the cottages, stated that he had the legal right to stop people from crossing his land at the end of the county road.  He said that he had never exercised his rights in this regard.  In Schroeder, Dyers Lake is considered a favorite local swimming and boating spot.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Dyers Lake was managed as a designated trout lake until 1999, when trout stocking was discontinued due to the presence of northern pike and yellow perch.  The lake will now be managed for northern pike, bluegill and black crappie.  Bluegill were stocked in 1999 and black crappie were stocked in 2002 in Dyers Lake.Test nets in 2004 sampled bluegill in fair numbers with some quality size fish in the sample.  Bluegill averaged 7.4 inches with fish up to 9.2 inches sampled.  Bluegill growth was good, which could be expected in a recently introduced population.  Dyers Lake will be considered for special regulations to maintain the quality and increase the relative abundance of bluegill.Black crappie were collected in low numbers in the 2004 assessment, and all the fish were from the 2002 stocking.  The fish were not sexually mature and probably a year or two away from being able to reproduce.  The fish had exhibited good growth and averaged 8.9 inches, with crappie up to 9.4 inches sampled.Northern pike were abundant but small.  Average weight was about 1.25 lb/fish; the largest northern pike sampled was 6.5 pounds.  Northern pike have preyed heavily on yellow perch in Dyers Lake and have reduced perch numbers significantly.  The reduced forage base has led to a decline in the average size of the northern pike, in part by reducing growth rates.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Dyers Lake is 69 acres with 85% littoral area, having a maximum depth of 23 feet and is located approximately 4 miles west-southwest of Schroeder, MN.  The back-in gravel access at the end of Cook County Road #30 is about 0.6 mile south of Cook County Road #1.  There is a small parking area and small dock at this site. <br> \n <br> \nDyers Lake was managed as a stream trout lake until it became apparent that a successful trout fishery could not be maintained due to competition from undesirable species.  Management focus shifted to panfish with the stocking of bluegill (1999) and black crappie (2002), with populations of northern pike and yellow perch also present at that time.  A special regulation was enacted in 2006 that restricts the bluegill and black crappie bag limit to 5 fish per day.  This regulation was designed to protect the newly introduced bluegill and black crappie populations from over-harvest and allow development of high-quality bluegill and black crappie populations and fisheries in Dyers Lake. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill numbers were below average for the lake class; however, the 2011 catch was the highest recorded on Dyers Lake.  The 2008 year-class (age-3) represented 75% of the standard trap net catch in 2011 while ages 2-6 were also present.  The average size of the bluegill sampled 6.2 inches (0.25 pound), the largest 9.5 inches (0.8 pound).  Growth was near average for ages 1-3 and above average for ages 4-6 compared to the average of aged samples from the Finland Fisheries area. <br> \n   <br> \nBlack crappie catch in 2011 was above the lake class average.  Seventy-two percent of crappie catch was from the 2006 year-class (age-5), ages 1, 2 and 6 were also represented.  The average size of the black crappie sampled was 9.7 inches (0.6 pound).  Growth measured from the 2011 black crappie sample was very near the average at all ages for black crappies sampled in the Finland Management Area. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike catch in 2011 was above average for the lake class.  Northern pike were first documented in Dyers Lake in 1992.  The average length of northern pike sampled in 2011 was 16.4 inches (1.1 pounds) the maximum length taken in was 24.3 inches (3.2 pounds).  Ages 1-8 were identified in the 2011sample, natural reproduction appeared sufficient to maintain the northern pike population in Dyers Lake. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch are present in Dyers Lake but the size would not excite anglers.  Yellow perch in Dyers Lake provide a good forage base for the northern pike population. <br> \n <br> \nOne 7.8 inch brook trout was collected in the 2011population assessment.  Dyers Lake is no longer stocked with brook trout or any other stream trout species.  The brook trout likely entered Dyers Lake via the outlet which is a tributary of the Two Island River, which has a self-sustaining brook trout population.  The presence of brook trout in Dyers Lake does not indicate there is a fishable population   <br> \n</p>",

The back-in gravel access at the end of Cook County Road #30 is about 0.6 mile south of Cook County Road #1. There is a small parking area and small dock at this site. <br> \n <br> \nA special regulation restricting the daily and possession bag limit of Bluegill and Black Crappie to five fish of each species was enacted in May 2006 to limit the exploitation of the developing Bluegill and Black Crappie brood stock populations in Dyers Lake.  This special regulation will be reviewed along with the Dyers Lake management plan by March 2016.  This (2014) population assessment was the third investigation designed to monitor the special regulation. <br> \n <br> \nThe average size of Black Crappie in the 2014 assessment was 5.6 inches; the largest was 13.1 inches (1.1 pounds).  There were gaps noted in the Black Crappie reproduction, based on the scale ageing, these missing year-classes should allow for good growth of the two and three year-old fish present in the population in 2014.  Two strong years of Black Crappie reproduction in 2011 and 2012 bodes well for crappie angling in Dyers Lake over the next few years.   <br> \n <br> \nBluegill numbers sampled in 2014 were the highest recorded in Dyers Lake since the introduction in 1999 and above average for lakes with similar characteristics having Bluegill populations.  The average size of the Bluegill sample was 6.3 inches (0.25 pound) the largest 10.0 inches (0.9 pound).  Three good years of Bluegill reproduction in 2010, 2011 and 2012 should provide quality Bluegill angling for some years. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike and Yellow Perch are also present in Dyers Lake in numbers that may interest anglers.  The average size of the Northern Pike sampled was 21.9 inches with thirty-nine percent greater than 24 inches; the largest Northern Pike sampled was 28.4 inches (5 pounds).  The Yellow Perch averaged 7.0 inches with seventeen percent greater than 8 inches; the largest Yellow Perch was 9.6 inches (0.4 pound).  <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

Management shifted to panfish with the stocking of bluegill (1999) and black crappie (2002), with incidental populations of northern pike and yellow perch.  Special regulations were enacted in 2006 that restricted the bluegill and black crappie bag limit to 5 fish.  This regulation was designed to protect the newly introduced bluegill and black crappie populations from over-harvest and allow development of high-quality populations and fisheries. <br> \n <br> \nAverage numbers and sizes of bluegills and black crappies were present in this assessment with fast growth exhibited that bodes well for a quality fishery.  Two additional investigations in 2011 and 2014 will be conducted before the regulation evaluation is complete and a new lake management plan is written. <br> \n</p>",

Yellow Perch continue to be very abundant, but small in size, averaging 6.5 inches.     Northern Pike were sampled for the first time, although in low numbers. One Northern Pike weighing 6.3 pounds was taken.      Bluegill numbers are increasing. Several Bluegill over 8.0 inches were taken.     In recent years several warmwater species have shown up in net catches. These are probably the result of unauthorized stockings by individuals who would rather see the lake managed for other species.</p>",

Access is by Cook County Road #30 which terminates on the north side of the lake at a small gravel ramp.The lake was stocked with yearling brook trout in the three years prior to the 1998 survey and splake were stocked as recently as 1995.  Test nets in 1998 indicate that northern pike have become very abundant and have preyed heavily on trout.  No trout were sampled in the survey despite the recent stockings.  The northern pike averaged 2.5 pounds with fish up to 8.4 pounds observed.The abundance of northern pike in the lake and the impact on trout nubmers has led to a decision to stop stocking trout and a proposal to remove Dyers Lake from the designated stream trout lake list.  It is anticipated this will take effect by the summer of 1999 and angling with live mnnows will then be allowed.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Dyers Lake had been managed as a stream trout lake until recently, when it became apparent that a successful trout fishery could not be maintained due to competition from undesirable species.  The lake is now managed for bluegill, black crappie and in addition to these species has a population of northern pike and yellow perch.The bluegill and black crappie populations are relatively new introductions and in order to protect them from over-harvest and allow development of high-quality populations and fisheries, special regulations will be implemented beginning in May 2006.  The regulations will limit the daily bag and possession limit to five daily for both species.Test nets in the spring of 2005 found bluegill have been reproducing and have started to expand the population although the overall catch was relatively low.  Bluegill from age-2 thru age-6 were sampled, and ranged in size from 2.1 inches to 9.3 inches.  A number of bluegill over 8.0 inches were collected.Black crappie were sampled in low numbers; however, this species was introduced as fingerlings in 2002 and likely were not sexually mature until 2005, so no reproduction could have occurred to increase their numbers.  Black crappie ranged from 9.3-10.4 inches and had exhibited good growth since being introduced.Northern pike were collected in relatively low numbers and the size was small, averaging about 1.1 lb/fish.  The largest northern pike collected in this assessment was 2.9 lb.Yellow perch were not abundant in netting gear in the 2005 assessment.  The largest yellow perch sampled was 10.3 inches but relatively few of the fish sampled were large enough to interest anglers.</p>",

There is a public access with a gravel boat ramp and dock at the end of Cook County 30 (Dyers Lake Road) south from Cook County 1. A targeted survey was completed in the spring of 2021 to monitor the Bluegill and Black Crappie populations. Both species were introduced into the lake about twenty years ago and have since established self-sustaining populations. There is a special regulation on the lake which reduces the sunfish daily limit to 5 and the daily limit of crappie to 5 fish. The regulation was placed on the lake in 2006 with the purpose to protect the newly established populations from overharvest. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill catch of 36.2 per trap net was significantly higher than previous surveys of the lake. Size ranged from 3.0 to 8.5 inches with an average length of 6.1 inches. The maximum length of Bluegill caught and the proportion of fish longer than 8 inches were both the lowest to date. Future surveys will continue to monitor the status of the population to determine if harvest levels are contributing to the poorer size structure. <br> \n <br> \nThe 2021 Black Crappie catch of 16.58 per trap net was lower than the previous survey, but above the normal range for similar lakes. The average length of crappie was 6.7 inches and fish up to 12 inches were sampled, although only 2% of the catch was longer than 10 inches. <br> \n <br> \nAge analysis determined several year classes of both Bluegill and Black Crappie were present indicating both species have been successful at establishing self-sustaining populations. Anglers should continue to find decent opportunities for these species which are not abundant in this part of the state.       </p>",
