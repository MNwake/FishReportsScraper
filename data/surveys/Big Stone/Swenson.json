Water levels are 6 - 8 feet above the ordinary high water mark and the majority of the lake is greater than 12 feet deep. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye were found in low abundance in Swenson Lake in 2013.  Sampled walleye had grown fast and measured 15 - 17 inches.  Considering their low abundance and number of forage fish available, anglers may have a hard time getting walleye to bite. <br> \n <br> \nBlack bullheads were present in moderate numbers and ranged from 4 - 13 inches.  Brook stickleback, fathead minnow, and orangespotted sunfish were the only other fish sampled in 2013.  Orangespotted sunfish are the smallest member of the sunfish family and seldom attain lengths greater than 4 inches. <br> \n <br> \nFuture management activities for Swenson Lake will include population assessments and winter-dissolved oxygen monitoring.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>This was an initial survey of Swenson Lake.  Above normal precipitation over the last 8-10 years has substantially increased the lake volume and depth of Swenson Lake.  Water basins to the south, southwest and southeast of become connected to the main water basin during this time period.  Nineteen feet of water was recorded in the southwest bay and the majority of the lake was greater than 12 feet.     The present fishery of Swenson Lake would not be of much interest to anglers.  Black bullhead, brook stickleback and fathead minnows were the only fish species sampled in test nets.  Black bullhead were abundant and most fish measured 6.5-8.5 inches.  An abundant population of young-of-year bullhead was also sampled.  Brook stickleback were moderately abundant and fathead minnow abundant.     Fisheries management activities for Swenson Lake include annual winter dissolved oxygen monitoring to evaluate winterkill potential, persuit of a permanant public access to ensure accessibility if water levels decrease, and development of a management plan.         </p>",
