                "narrative": "<p>Lower LaSalle is a 211 acre lake located in northwestern Hubbard County, 4.5 miles west of Becida.  The lake basin is steep-sided and extremely deep (over 200 feet maximum depth).  The part of the lake generally most productive for fish is the area under 15 feet, called the littoral zone.  Only 16 acres or 7% of Lower LaSalle is littoral, so the potential for fish production is limited.  There is no developed public access at the present time.  The DNR is in the process of attempting to aquire lakeshore property with future plans of a public access.  Lower LaSalle provides fishing opportunities for northern pike, largemouth bass, panfish, and walleye. <br> \n <br> \nLakes in Minnesota are classified into 43 different types based on physical and chemical characteristics.  Lower LaSalle is in lake class 23.  Other area lakes in this same classification include Big Bass, Benedict, Blue, East Crooked, and Spearhead. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike abundance (6.6 pike/gillnet) was within the range \"typical\" for this lake class and similar to past surveys.  Sampled northern pike had an average length and weight of 20.5 inches and 2.2 pounds, with pike measured up to 35.7 inches.  Walleye abundance (2.8 walleye/gillnet) was up from past surveys.  Twelve different year classes of walleye were sampled with fish ranging in size from 12.0 to 27.8 inches.  Lower LaSalle has not been stocked with walleye since 1941.  Important forage species for walleye and northern pike such as tullibee (cisco), yellow perch, and white sucker are present, but found in low numbers. <br> \n <br> \nWhile not known as a \"bass-panfish\" lake, these species are found in Lower LaSalle and provide angling opportunities.  Lower LaSalle has excellent water quality, but has limited areas of submerged aquatic vegetation that bass and panfish prefer.  Present and past surveys have shown bluegill, black crappie, and largemouth bass abundance to fluctuate from low to moderate numbers.  Anglers will find bluegill in the 6-8 inch size range and black crappie in the 9-11 inch size range.  The number of larger bluegill (> 8.0 inches) was low when compared to other area lakes.  Largemouth bass and panfish growth rates were slow when compared to area lakes. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled included moderate numbers of rock bass and hybrid sunfish, and low numbers of pumpkinseed, yellow bullhead, and shorthead redhorse. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

Park Rapids Fisheries staff conducted a survey targeting near shore fish species on July 17, 2020 to assess populations of non-game and small sport fish.  Ten 100-foot sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake shore, sampling a variety of habitat types.  Each site was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot 1/8th-inch mesh seine, depending on habitat conditions.   <br> \n <br> \nDuring this assessment, one site was sampled with a 50-foot seine and seven sites were sampled with a 15-foot seine.  Site conditions prevented the use of seines at two sites.  Backpack electrofishing was done at all 10 sites.  Nearshore sampling captured seventeen species of fish including two species intolerant of disturbance; Banded Killifish, and Blacknose Shiner.  Other species sampled during the nearshore effort included Black Crappie, Bluegill, Bluntnose Minnow, Central Mudminnow, Common Shiner, Green Sunfish, Hybrid Sunfish, Iowa Darter, Johnny Darter, Largemouth Bass, Molted Sculpin, Rock Bass, Tadpole Madtom, White Sucker, and Yellow Perch.  Nearshore catches will be used along with gill net and trap net catch data from a standard fisheries survey conducted on August 31, 2020, to calculate a fish-based Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) score, which is indicative of the health of LaSalle Lake.   <br> \n <br> \nThis survey is contributing to a watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.  LaSalle Lake is located in the Mississippi River - Headwaters Watershed. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lower LaSalle is a 211 acre lake located in northwestern Hubbard County, 4.5 miles west of Becida. The lake basin is steep-sided and extremely deep (over 200 feet maximum). There is no public access on the lake. Lakes in Minnesota are classified into 43 different types based on physical and chemical characteristics. Lower LaSalle is in Lake Class 23. Other area lakes in the same class include Big Bass (near Akeley), Benedict, Blue, East Crooked, and Spearhead.  The part of a lake generally most productive for fish is the area under 15 feet deep, called the littoral zone. Only 16 acres, or 7% of Lower LaSalle is littoral, so the potential for fish production is limited. The volume of water available to fish is limited as well; in the summer there is no dissolved oxygen below 30 feet. Despite these limitations, Lower LaSalle maintains populations of northern pike, walleye, largemouth bass, black crappie, and bluegill.  Northern pike abundance was within normal range for this lake class. Sizes were small, running mostly between 15-22 inches. Walleye were present in test nets; abundance was low but average size was good at 3.4 pounds. The shoreline offers little spawning habitat for walleye but the inlet and outlet may provide spawning and/or migration routes from other sources. Walleye are not stocked in Lower LaSalle; the low littoral area and low abundance of yellow perch make stocking success unlikely.  Northern pike and walleye depend on species like yellow perch, tullibee (cisco) and white sucker for their forage base; these species are present with low to average abundance. Large schools of small yellow perch and shiners were seen near shore during the 2000 survey. Black crappie catch rates (0.63/trap net) were in the average range for this lake class. Two distinct sizes were present, one at 4 inches and one at 11 inches. Bluegill numbers were lower than average for this lake type. Most bluegill sampled were under 5 inches but there were a few 7-8 inch bluegills. This lake lacks the shallow areas that provide good spawning habitat for crappies and bluegills. Other species sampled included largemouth bass and rock bass; abundance of both species was low.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>LaSalle Lake is a 211 acre lake located in northwestern Hubbard County, 4.5 miles west of Becida.  The lake has steep drop offs and is extremely deep, with a maximum depth of 213 feet.  The part of the lake generally most productive for fish is the area less than 15 feet in depth, called the littoral zone.  Only 16 acres or 7% of LaSalle is littoral, so the potential for fish production is limited.  Because of this, there is a special regulation on LaSalle to reduce possession limits on most species.  These reduced limits include five crappies, five sunfish, two Walleye, ten Yellow Perch, and catch and release only for bass.  Anglers will need a Minnesota state vehicle pass to drive into LaSalle state recreational area that surrounds the lake.  Within the Recreational Area, a concrete boat ramp, and a fishing pier is located on the north end of the lake.  Fishing opportunities within LaSalle Lake include Northern Pike, Walleye, Yellow Perch, Largemouth Bass, Bluegill, and Black Crappie. <br> \n <br> \nMinnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical and chemical characteristics.  LaSalle Lake is in class 23.  Class 23 lakes are irregularly shaped, have deep basins, and have hard water with good water clarity.  Other lakes in the Park Rapids area include, Spearhead, Benedict, Blue, Boot, East Crooked, and 11th Crow Wing. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike abundance was higher than past surveys, but within the typical range for lake class 23.  Sampled Northern Pike had an average length of 21.25 inches and weight of 2.2 pounds, with pike measured up to 30 inches during the survey.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance was up from previous surveys.  Several different year classes of walleye were sampled with fish ranging in size from 11.7 to 24.4 inches.  Yellow Perch sampled during the survey ranged from 5-9.5 inches.  Although they may be too small for some anglers, smaller perch are an Important forage species for Walleye and Northern Pike.  <br> \n <br> \nWhile LaSalle Lake is not a typical Largemouth Bass lake due to the low littoral area and limited areas of submerged aquatic vegetation.  Largemouth Bass were sampled with an average length of over 12 inches, and the Largemouth Bass sampled in the gill nets averaged 1.8 pounds. <br> \n <br> \nThe same factors that limit bass within the lake also limit panfish.  Bluegill abundance was normal for the lake class but most Bluegills measured under 5.5 inches with a sampled fish measuring up to 8 inches.  Black Crappies were sampled in numbers below the typical range for lake class 23, and measured from 7.8-9.2 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species that anglers might encounter include Brook Trout, Greater Redhorse, Green Sunfish, Hybrid Sunfish, Pumpkinseed, Rock Bass, Tadpole Madtom, Tullibee (Cisco), and White Sucker. <br> \n</p>",
