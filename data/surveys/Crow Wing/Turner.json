                "narrative": "<p>Turner (Curley) is a rather small (53 acres), hardwater lake with low phosphorus fertility and good water clarity.  The maximum depth is 36 feet and about 49% of the lake is less than 15 feet deep.  Bottom soils in water less than four feet deep are mostly muck, sand and marl, with some gravel present as well.  A fairly diverse aquatic plant community was present during the 1993 lake survey.  Fair to good spawning habitat was present in the lake for bass and panfish, especially in areas with bulrush and firm bottom soils.  Good habitat for northern pike spawning was present along inlets.Northern pike were present in high numbers in 1993 and average size was 2.0 lbs..  The sample of largemouth bass was rather small, however several age classes were present.  Bluegills were found in \"average\" numbers, while pumpkinseeds were present in \"high\" numbers compared to similar lakes.  Black crappies and rock bass also were taken in \"average\" numbers.  Yellow perch were present and provide a important food source for gamefish.  Other species taken in testnets included \"high\" numbers of bowfin (dogfish) and yellow bullheads.  Brown bullheads were \"average\" in number but \"large\" in size (1.0 lb. average weight).</p>",
