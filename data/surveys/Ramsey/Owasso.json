The average size of walleye sampled measured 19.4\" and weighed 2.8 lbs.  More than 50% the walleye sampled exceeded 20\".  Northern pike were also sampled in high numbers.  The pike observed were of quality size, averaging more than 5 pounds each.  Largemouth bass were sampled in average numbers and were average size. Only 1 bass larger than 16\" was observed.  Bluegill and crappie were abundant, but small.  Only 1 in 6 bluegill sampled exceeded 6\", with only one bluegill in excess of 7\" observed.  Only 8% of the crappie sampled were longer than 8\".  Yellow perch were common, but small.  No muskellunge were sampled in this investigation.  Further evaluation of the musky population is scheduled for the spring of 2013.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Owasso is a 375-acre lake with a maximum depth of 37 feet and mean depth of 11 feet. DNR Fisheries manages the lake primarily for Walleye and Muskellunge with Largemouth Bass and Bluegill as secondary management species. The 2021 spring trap netting survey was conducted to provide baseline information on Bluegill for the new 5-fish bag limit experimental fishing regulation that went into effect in 2021. The goal of this regulation on Owasso Lake is to increase the size structure of Bluegill.  <br> \nNine trap nets were set on April 28, 2021 and lifted on April 29, 2021 catching a total of 252 Bluegill. Bluegill ranged in size from 3.7 inches up to 7.3 inches in length, with an average size of 5.3 inches. Aging structures (otoliths) were collected from 82 Bluegill. The largest number of fish were from 2018 (3 years old). The oldest Bluegill sampled in 2021 was determined to be from the 2015 year-class (6 years old). The size structure of Bluegill found in Owasso Lake is below average for East Metro-area lakes, with only 1% of the fish larger than 7 inches. <br> \nA fish-kill event has potentially changed the fish structure of Lake Owasso. Over Thanksgiving weekend in 2013 a presumed oxygen super-saturation event caused a large number of fish mortalities in Lake Owasso. An assessment in the spring of 2014 discovered that it was not a complete kill, with Walleye, Northern Pike, Bluegill, Black Crappie, Largemouth Bass and Common Carp present. It is interesting to note that the oldest fish sampled in 2021 were all age 6 and from the 2015 year-class. It is possible that the kill event wiped out the majority of mature Bluegill and the spring 2014 spawning biomass was greatly reduced and did not recover until 2015.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of the nearshore fish community on Owasso Lake was conducted July 2nd and 3rd, 2018 by Fisheries staff. Sampling stations were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at all 10 stations and seining occurred at 8 of the 10 stations. Nearshore sampling captured 15 native species of fish. Largemouth Bass and Bluegill Sunfish were the most abundant species sampled followed by Bluntnose Minnows. Owasso Lake has high density, urban development on most of the lakeshore and a long history of submerged aquatic plant treatments which may be why only one intolerant species (Iowa Darter) was sampled in 2018.  <br> \n <br> \nData from this targeted nearshore survey is combined with data from a standard gill and trap netting survey in early August 2018 to calculate a Fish-based Index of Biologic Integrity (FIBI) score that describes the overall health of the lake. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment.  The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. The FIBI score of 36 for Owasso Lake based on this survey is below the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes.  Data from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Mississippi River - Twin Cities Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency. For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website. <br> \n</p>",

Black crappie numbers were on the low side of normal for this type of lake with few over 9 inches.Northern pike were the most abundant predator species sampled.  Over a third of the fish measured at least 25 inches in length and over a tenth were at least 33 inches long.  Walleye were present in moderate numbers with all fish between 14.4 and 21.3 inches in length.  Largemouth bass were sampled in low numbers.  One muskellunge was sampled, measuring 24.3 inches, from the 1994 stocking.Yellow bullhead were present in moderate numbers with a fifth of the fish over 11 inches.

Bluegill PSD was 36.1.  Gillnet catches of pumpkinseed were above local median abundance, while trapnet catches were below local median levels.  Largemouth bass, white sucker and brown bullhead were found at near local median levels.  Trapnet catches of hybrid sunfish were above local median abundance, while gillnet catches were below local median levels.  Largemouth bass were sampled in all gear types, and natural reproduction was verified by shoreline seining.  Growth of largemouth bass was average.  Muskellunge(L) sampled from the 1987 and 1982 stockings showed good growth.  Five year classes of northern pike and three year classes of walleye showed good growth.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Owasso is a 375 acre, eutrophic lake located in the cities of Shoreview and Roseville. Seventy-eight percent (292 acres) of the lake is littoral (less than 15 feet deep) and it has a maximum depth is 37 feet. DNR Fisheries manages the lake for Walleye and Muskellunge. A fish-kill event over Thanksgiving weekend in 2013 caused a large number of fish mortalities in Lake Owasso. An assessment in the spring of 2014 discovered that it was not a complete kill though, with Walleye, Northern Pike, Bluegill, Black Crappie, Largemouth Bass and Common Carp present. In 2018 two surveys were conducted on Lake Owasso, a standard fishery survey using trap nets, gill nets and electrofishing as well as a fish index of biotic integrity (IBI) survey which is used to assess the nearshore species composition of the lake. The IBI typically samples many non-game species and minnows that the standard nets do not sample. <br> \n <br> \nLake Owasso is stocked annually with 293 pounds of Walleye fingerlings. The Walleye gill net catch rate in 2018 was 3.50 which is in the normal range for Lake Owasso. The average size of Walleye sampled was 19.3 inches long, similar to the previous lake survey in 2012. Aging structures were collected from the Walleye and it was found that the 2014 year-class (age 4) were the most abundant (9 of 12 Walleye). In response to the fish-kill in 2013, Walleye fry (350,000), fingerlings (23,757) and yearlings (12,407) were stocked in 2014, creating a large year-class in Lake Owasso. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike numbers in Lake Owasso continued their upward trend over the past 20 years and the 2018 catch is the highest on record. Concurrent with the increased catch rate is a decrease in the average size, dropping five inches compared to the past two surveys. In 2018 the average length of pike sampled was 21.7 inches long. Large fish do still exist in the lake, with the largest this year measuring 36 inches long. The changes that are being observed with the Northern Pike may have been accelerated following the fish kill in 2013 which may have opened up a niche for the pike to fill, especially with a lack of large Muskellunge in the lake to control them. Beginning in 2018 the new Northern Pike zone management regulations went into effect. Lake Owasso is in the North-Central Zone which allows a harvest of 10 fish, with two fish allowed over 26 inches in length and a protected slot between 22 and 26 inches. The pike sampled in this survey mostly fell below the protected slot limit, with 57% of the fish under 22 inches long. Increased angler harvest of these smaller fish could help shift the size structure toward larger fish in Lake Owasso. <br> \n <br> \nLeech Lake Muskellunge fingerlings (147 fish) are stocked in odd numbered years in Lake Owasso and a population estimate is scheduled for 2021 and 2022. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill numbers were very high in the trap net sample and continues a pattern seen over the history of Lake Owasso surveys. Bluegill average size of 4.55 inches was also the smallest since at least 1996. Black Crappie abundance was in the normal range for Lake Owasso but the fish sampled were also very small, with an average size of only 4.75 inches. Small Yellow Perch were observed in high numbers while night electrofishing but only two fish were sampled during the netting survey. It is possible that the higher abundance of Northern Pike and Walleye is putting downward pressure on the larger perch in this lake. <br> \n <br> \nThe Fish IBI near-shore survey using backpack electrofishing and beach seines sampled 15 different species of fish. The three most abundant species sampled were Bluntnose Minnow, Bluegill Sunfish and Largemouth Bass. Other species included Iowa and Johnny Darters, Golden, Spotfin and Spottail Shiners, Black Crappie, Green, Hybrid and Pumpkinseed Sunfish, a Northern Pike, Yellow Perch and a Yellow Bullhead. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of nearshore and littoral fish species in Owasso Lake was conducted on June 30th, 2021 by Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program Staff. Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at ten sampling stations, but one station was sampled from the boat due to site conditions. Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample four stations, a 15-foot seine was used at five stations, and site conditions prevented the use of seines at one station. Nearshore sampling captured 14 species of fish including one species that is intolerant of disturbance (Iowa Darter), and one species that is tolerant of disturbance (Green Sunfish). <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore data were combined with trap net and gill net data from a July 26th, 2021 standard survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based IBI (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment. In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g. Blackchin Shiner, Iowa Darter, and Rock Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g. Black Bullhead, Green Sunfish, Common Carp). The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.  <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Mississippi River-Twin Cities Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.</p>",

Catch rates for bluegill exceded historic levels, but the average size of sampled fish was only 4.6 inches and 0.06 pounds (16.7 fish/lb.). Only 5.9% of all bluegill captured measured 6.0 inches or longer, and no fish measured 7.0 inches or larger. Pumpkinseed sunfish were also captured at record levels of abundance, but averaged small in size. Black crappie were sampled within normal levels of abundance, but averaged 5.6 inches in length. Growth rates for these three species were found to be slow. Yellow perch were sampled above median levels for gill net abundance and the long term average for this lake. Sampled yellow perch averaged only 6.1 inches and exhibited average rates of growth. Muskellunge and walleye are the primary management species in Lake Owasso. Experimental regulations were established in 1989 with a 48.0 inch minimum harvest size for Muskellunge to protect potential broodstock fish. Muskellunge are stocked biennially on odd numbered years at a rate of one fish/surface acre. Only one 40 inch muskellunge was sampled in this survey. Walleye are stocked biennially on even numbered years at a rate of 3.0 pounds/littoral acre. Walleye were captured within the normal interquartile range for abundance in gill nets. The catch rate reflected no significant change in sampling abundance from those observed in assessments since 1986. The average walleye sampled was 21.3 inches and 3.7 pounds. Northern pike were sampled above median levels for abundance. The average individual sampled was 25.4 inches and 4.1 pounds. Over 11% of all northern pike sampled were 30.0 inches or longer. Growth rates for all major predator species was found to be good.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Owasso is primarily managed for Walleye (WAE) and Muskellunge (MUE). Walleye stocking is conducted biennially on even numbered years at a rate of 3.0 pounds/littoral-acre (879.0 lbs). Muskellunge stocking currently consists of stocking fall fingerlings at a rate of 1.0 fish/surface-acre (384 fish) biennially on odd numbered years. All Muskellunge stocked in Lake Owasso have been the Leech Lake Strain. Walleye were sampled below the median levels for abundance in gill nets. The gill net catch rate for WAE has shown little change since 1986. The average size of gill net sampled WAE in 2006 was 17.5 inches and 2.17 pounds. Fifty percent of all WAE captured measured 20.0 inches or longer. Only one 25.3 inch MUE was captured during this assessment. Northern Pike (NOP) were sampled above median levels for abundance and mean weight and reflected an increase in catch rate from the 2001 assessment. The average size NOP captured was approximately 26.7 inches and 4.5 pounds. Over 29 percent of sampled NOP measured 28.0 inches or larger. Yellow Perch (YEP) catch rates continue to exhibit a steady decline in abundance since 1996. The average size of YEP sampled was 6.4 inches and 0.10 pounds. No YEP sampled measured over 8.0 inches in length. Bluegill (BLG) abundance still remains very high with the average size of fish sampled being 6.2 inches and 0.15 pounds. Only 2 percent of sampled BLG measured 7.0 inches or longer. Black Crappie (BLC) abundance exhibited a significant increase since the 2001 fisheries survey. The average size of BLC sampled measured 6.0 inches and 0.11 pounds. Less than 4 percent of all BLC captured measured 8.0 inches or longer. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Owasso is a 375 acre eutrophic lake assigned to lake class 24 in the Cities of Roseville and Shoreview, Ramsey County. Seventy-eight percent (292 acres) of the lake is littoral and it has a maximum depth is 37 feet and mean depth of 11 feet. The fishery is predominantly managed for Walleye and Muskellunge. Walleye fingerlings are stocked at a rate of 1 lb. per littoral acre while Muskellunge fingerlings are stocked at a rate of 0.5 fish per littoral acre in odd years. A fish-kill occurred in 2013 when, shortly after ice covered the lake, a presumed oxygen super-saturation event caused a large number of fish mortalities in Lake Owasso. An assessment in the spring of 2014 discovered that it was not a complete kill, with Walleye, Northern Pike, Bluegill, Black Crappie, Largemouth Bass and Common Carp present. This survey was conducted with gill nets and trap nets in July 2021 with electrofishing for Largemouth Bass in early June. The previous survey occurred in 2018. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye were sampled at a rate of 7.5 fish per gill net. This is the highest catch rate in the lakes history and twice the previous survey. Fish size was typical for the lake and large relative to similar lakes with a mean length of 19.4 inches. Not many small fish were sampled in gill nets but these fish were well represented in trap nets with a mean length in that gear of 13.5 inches. The largest fish was also caught in trap nets with a length of 26.6 inches. Only fish from gill nets were aged as trap net fish could be released with a high certainty of survival. Ages varied from 2 to 13 years old but 7 year old fish dominated with over 60 percent of the catch. The relatively large number of smaller fish sampled in trap nets indicates that there are also younger year classes coming up. The long range goal of providing a Walleye fishery with catches in the normal range for the lake class is currently being exceeded.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike were sampled by gill nets at a rate of 10.5 fish per net. This is high relative to similar lakes but is typical relative to historical surveys. Fish size was smaller than average with a mean length of 22.7 inches and a maximum of 29 inches. Northern Pike are not a management priority on this lake as it is primarily managed for Muskellunge. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch were sampled by gill nets at a rate of 20.3 fish per net. This is a typical rate although catch rates have been widely variable with the previous survey sampling only a single Yellow Perch in gill nets. Fish size was also typical with a mean length of 6.3 inches. Fish size only ranged from 5.5 to 7 inches in length. This small size range and historical variability in catch rates may indicate that recruitment in this lake is highly episodic.  <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie were sampled at a rate of 3.5 fish per trap net but at a rate of 11 fish per gill net. The trap net rate is below average while the gill net rate is above average. Fish size was similar in both gears and a slight improvement over previous surveys. The larger sample size from gill nets had a mean length of 7.5 inches with a maximum of 10.7 inches. That single largest fish was the only one sampled over 9 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nBluegill were sampled at a rate of 37.8 fish per trap net. This rate is typical but this lake has had a relatively variable history of catch rates. Fish size was quite a bit smaller than average relative to similar lakes which is historically typical for the lake. Mean length was only 5 inches and the maximum size was 7.4 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nSpring time electrofishing sampled Largemouth Bass at a rate of 43 fish per hour. This was the same rate as the only other electrofishing effort conducted on the lake with occurred in 2012. Fish size was also fairly similar with a mean length of 9.8 inches. Sizes were fairly evenly distributed across the range of sizes with a maximum length of 17.9 inches and a PSD of 46. <br> \n <br> \nAlthough the Muskellunge population is assessed by spring time sampling,  one 25.5 inch fish was sampled in this survey. Other species sampled included: Black Bullhead, Common Carp, Hybrid Sunfish, Pumpkinseed, White Sucker, and Yellow Bullhead. <br> \n</p>",
