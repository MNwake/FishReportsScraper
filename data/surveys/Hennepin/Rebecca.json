BASS WERE SAMPLED BY ELECTROFISHING IN NUMBERS LOWER THAN ANY OF THE PREVIOUS YEARS OF THIS STUDY.  THIS IS DUE TO THE POOR WATER CLARITY AT THE TIME OF ELECTROFISHING FROM A VERY HEAVY ALGAE BLOOM.  STUNNED FISH WERE NOT VISIBLE UNTIL THEY WERE RIGHT AT THE SURFACE.  LMB EXHIBITED THE SECOND HIGHEST PSD (25.0%) SINCE THE SPECIAL REGULATIONS STUDY BEGAN.  ALTHOUGH ELECTROFISHING YIELDED NO FISH OVER 16 SAMPLED FISH WERE IN THE 12-16 INCH SLOT.  THE TRAPNET SAMPLE DID YIELD ONE FISH OVER 16 INCHES. LMB GROWTH IS SLIGHTLY ABOVE AVERAGE.  BLG WERE SAMPLED WELL ABOVE STATE AND LOCAL MEDIAN LEVELS FOR NUMBER AND EXHIBITED A CPUE SLIGHTLY BELOW PREVIOUS STUDY YEARS.  CAPTURED FISH EXHIBITED A PSD=75.8% AND AN AVERAGE RATE OF 5.6 FISH PER POUND.  BLG SEVEN INCHES AND LARGER MADE UP 3.1% OF THE SAMPLE.  SCALE ANALYSIS INDICATES THAT BLG GROWTH IS BELOW AVERAGE.  PMK AND HSF AVERAGED 6.67 FISH PER POUND AND BOTH SPECIES WERE SAMPLED BELOW ALL MEDIAN LEVELS.  BLCS WHILE BEING SAMPLED ABOVE ALL MEDIAN LEVELS, AVERAGED ONLY 9.0 FISH PER POUND.  YEP WERE ALSO SAMPLED BELOW MEDIAN LEVELS AND AVERAGE 8.0 FISH PER POUND.  BLB WERE SAMPLED BELOW THE LOCAL MEDIAN FOR ABUNDANCE, BUT AT TWICE THE LOCAL MEDIAN FOR POUNDS PER TRAPNET SET.  YOUNG CAP (AGE II+) ARE BECOMING MORE EVIDENT IN THE LAKE, BUT ARE STILL BELOW STATE AND LOCAL MEDIAN LEVELS.  WAE WERE SAMPLED ABOVE ALL MEDIAN LEVELS AND EXHIBITED AN AVERAGE SIZE OF OVER FOUR POUNDS PER INDIVIDUAL.  THIS IS REFLECTED BY AN RSD=90.0%.  NO WAE UNDER 19.0 INCHES WERE CAPTURED.  WAE GROWTH RATE IS AVERAGE. SEVEN MUE WERE SAMPLED FROM FOUR DIFFERENT YEAR CLASSES.  THREE OF THESE INDIVIDUALS WERE CAPTURED WHILE SEINING.  THE LARGER FISH IN THE TRAPNET SAMPLE WERE MALES.  LENGTH-AT-AGE DATA REFLECTS THE SLOWER GROWTH RATE FOR MALES AS THEY GET OLDER.  GROWTH RATE UP TO AGE SEVEN IS ABOVE AVERAGE FOR THIS SPECIES.  SEINING YIELDED YOUNG- OF-YEAR FOR BLG, LMB, BLC, AND YEP.  OVER HALF OF THE 3,360 BLG SEINED WERE YEARLINGS (APPROX. 2</p>",

Only 5.7 percent of the bluegill captured were 7.0 inches or longer. Bluegill production was observed to be very high and rate of growth was found to be slow. Pumpkinseed sunfish were sampled in normal abundance and averaged 5.8 inches in length. Black crappie were also found to be very abundant with the average length being only 6.7 inches in length. Less than one percent of the black crappie sampled in this assessment were 8.0 inches or longer. Walleye were sampled in relatively low numbers but the average size was 23.1 inches in length and 4.6 pounds in weight. Walleye growth rates were observed to be slow. Two Muskellunge were also sampled with trapnets. Muskellunge were above average in size but below average for abundance. The relative weight for length was also below average for adult Muskellunge. Neither fish was of legal minimum harvest size. Largemouth bass were observed in good numbers, but no large individuals were captured during this assessment. Yellow perch were captured in normal abundance and exhibited good growth. Carp were sampled in the highest numbers since 1983. No black bullheads were captured during this assessment.</p>",

THE ACTUAL NUMBER OF BLUEGILLS CAUGHT WAS LESS THAN HALF OF THE 1985 CATCH. BLUEGILL PSD (%) (TRAPNETS ONLY) WAS 44.8 (39.6 IN 1985). NUMBERS OF LARGEMOUTH BASS, BLACK BULLHEAD, WALLEYE, GREEN SUNFISH, AND HYBRID SUN- FISH CAPTURED WERE ALSO SUBSTANTIALLY LESS THAN IN 1985. ONLY BLACK CRAPPIE AND YELLOW PERCH NUMBER INCREASED FROM 1985. FOUR MUSKELLUNGE WERE SAMPLED SAME AS IN 1985, AND GROWTH WAS GOOD. INDIVIDUALS FROM THE 1984 CLASS THAT WERE 14.0'-14.9' IN 1985 ARE NOW 20.0' TO 21.9' IN LENGTH. SPRING ELECTRO- FISHING YIELDED 149 LMB IN 45 MINUTES VS 92 LMB IN 45 MINUTES IN 1985. THE BASS PSD VALUE OF 45.5% IS MORE THAN DOUBLE THAT FOUND IN 1985. THIS REFLECTS THE GROUP OF BASS WHICH HAVE ENTERED THE SLOT OVER THE PAST YEAR. NO CARP WERE SAMPLED IN 1986.</p>",

The average size for bluegill at the time of this assessment was 6.1 inches long and 0.16 pounds. Although the abundance has remained fairly stable since 1996, the average size for bluegill has improved slightly.  Pumpkinseed sunfish have memained fairly stable in abundance and increased slightly in average size (5.2\") over the last 3 years. Black crappie have also shown a slight increase in both size and abundance in this same time period, however, their average size remains small (6.5\" and 0.15 pounds per fish). Yellow perch have exhibited the most significant increase in abundance, but the average length is only 6.5 inches. Largemouth bass were collected in fairly high numbers for trap net sampling, but the average size fish captured was only 6.4 inches in length. Growth rates for all species were found to be near average. No Muskellunge were captured during this assessment and spring nettings indicate a declining abundance of this species. Black bullhead and white suckers were again present in the netting assessment for the first time in several years, but at very low abundance.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Rebecca is a 254-acre, class 24 lake, located one mile south of Rockford in western Hennepin County.  Since 1987, Lake Rebecca has been Minnesota's primary source for Leech Lake strain muskellunge eggs.  The sportfish sampled during June 2005 consisted of black crappie, bluegill, green sunfish, muskellunge, pumpkinseed sunfish, and yellow perch.  Other species sampled include black bullheads, common carp, and golden shiner.    Coinciding with the 1999 fingerling stocking, one age-6 muskellunge measuring 36.6 inches and weighing 12.7 pounds was sampled by trap net.  Black crappie, bluegill, and pumpkinseed sunfish were very abundant while green sunfish and yellow perch were low in numbers.   Bluegill numbers (280/trap net) nearly doubled and average length of bluegills decreased by 0.4 inches since last survey in 1999.  Approximately 75% of the bluegills sampled were below 6.0 inches, with only 2% exceeding 7.0 inches.  Of the 213 black crappies sampled, approximately 97% of the crappie population was below 8.0 inches, with no fish exceeding 8.5 inches.  Of the 154 pumpkinseeds sampled, eighty-two percent of population was between 4.5 and 5.5 inches.  Although yellow perch numbers have dropped considerably since last survey, mean length has increased by nearly an inch.  The largest perch measured 8.6 inches.  Additionally, three green sunfish averaged 5.3 inches, with the largest specimen measuring 6.5 inches.  Black bullheads, common carp and golden shiners displayed low abundance.  One carp (26.2 inches), one golden shiner (5.9 inches), and two black bullheads averaging 8.1 inches were sampled in trap nets.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Rebecca is a 254-acre, Class 24 lake located south of Rockford in western Hennepin County.  It is entirely within the Lake Rebecca Park Reserve, operated by the Three Rivers Park District.  The lake is primarily managed for Muskellunge and secondarily managed for Bluegill and Largemouth Bass.  Since 1987, Lake Rebecca has been Minnesota's primary source for Leech Lake strain Muskellunge eggs.  It is important for anglers to handle these fish carefully and return them to the water quickly to ensure these fish will be able to contribute to future generations of Minnesota Muskellunge.   <br> \n <br> \nA fish Standard Survey was conducted during the first week in June 2016 to evaluate the size structure and abundance of game fish species in the lake.  Only trap nets were used during this assessment to limit physically damaging and physiologically stressing Muskellunge. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill abundance was above average (27.3/ trap net).  Historically Bluegill abundance has been extremely high; the previous 5 assessments (1993 - 2011) have averaged 224.6 Bluegill per net.  While abundance has decreased, size structure has not changed much over the years and continues to be small.  Bluegill averaged 5.4 inches and 0.12 lb, with the largest reaching 7.6 inches.  Seventy-three percent of Bluegill sampled were between 3 and 6 inches, and 26% of the fish were between 6 and 7.6 inches.  Ages ranged from 1 through 5, with the 2013 year class being the most abundant (42% of catch).  The fish are growing fast compared to the statewide average.  At age 3, Bluegill averaged 5.8 inches.       <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie abundance was average in the 2016 survey (7.2/ trap net).  Black Crappie averaged 4.4 inches and 0.04 lb, with the largest reaching 8.3 inches.  Size structure is small.  In 2016, 93% of the fish sampled were smaller than 5 inches.  Ages ranged from 1 through 3; eighty-two percent of the catch was age 1.  Black Crappie growth was fast; the fish reached an average of 5.8 inches by age 2.   <br> \n   <br> \nNighttime electrofishing was conducted during the spring to survey the Largemouth Bass population.  One hundred ninety-five bass were collected, resulting in a catch rate of 100 fish per hour of on-time, which is high for this area.  Average size of fish was 8.9 inches and 0.49 pounds.  The largest fish measured 20.1 inches.  Bass ages 1 through 6 and 8 through 11 were collected, reflecting regular recruitment.  Forty-eight percent of the fish collected were age 2.  Growth rate was above average relative to other lakes in the state; fish reach an average of 10.0 inches by age 3 and 13.2 inches by age 5. <br> \n <br> \nOther fishes sampled in low abundance were Muskellunge, Black Bullhead, Common Carp, Golden Shiner, Green Sunfish, hybrid sunfish, Northern Pike, Pumpkinseed and Yellow Perch.   <br> \n</p>",

The average size for bluegill at the time of this assessment was 5.8 inches long and 0.14 pounds. Although there has been a decrease in abundance since 1993, the average size for bluegill has remained about the same. Pumpkinseed sunfish have shown a big increase in abundance, but have decreased in average length approximately 1 inch. Black crappie have shown a decrease in both size and abundance since 1993. Yellow Perch have shown an increase in abundance, but the average length is only 6.0 inches. Largemouth bass were collected in above normal numbers for trap nets, but averaged very small in size. Growth rates for all species except largemouth bass were found to be good. Only one yearling Muskie measuring 12.4 inches was netted. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Rebecca is a 263-acre lake with a maximum depth of 30 feet.  The lake is located south of Rockford in western Hennepin County.  It is entirely within the Lake Rebecca Park Reserve, operated by the Three Rivers Park District.  The lake is primarily managed for Muskellunge and secondarily managed for Bluegill and Largemouth Bass.  Since 1987, Lake Rebecca has been Minnesota's primary source for Leech Lake strain Muskellunge eggs.  It is important for anglers to handle these fish carefully and return them to the water quickly to ensure these fish will be able to contribute to future generations of Minnesota Muskellunge.   <br> \n <br> \nA Standard Survey was conducted during the first week in June 2016 to evaluate the size structure and abundance of game fish species (other than Muskellunge) in the lake.  Only trap nets were used during this assessment to limit physically damaging and physiologically stressing Muskellunge. <br> \n <br> \nIn 2021, Bluegill were sampled in extremely high numbers.  Of the 2,433 Bluegill that were sampled, 97% were between 4.5 and 6.0 inches in length.  The largest fish was 6.5 inches long.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie were sampled at above average, though not extremely high, numbers.  Fish lengths were between 3.5 and 10.0 inches, with an average of 5.9 inches.  Ninety percent of the fish were smaller than 7.5 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nA good number of Yellow Perch were sampled in 2021, and their size was small.  Fish lengths were between 4.5 and 7.5 inches, with an average of 5.9 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nSampling for Largemouth Bass was not conducted in 2021, and none were sampled in the trap nets.  Other fishes sampled in low abundance were Golden Shiner, Green Sunfish, hybrid sunfish, and Pumpkinseed.   <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Rebecca is a 254-acre lake located south of Rockford in western Hennepin County.  It is entirely within the Lake Rebecca Park Reserve, operated by the Three Rivers Park District.  The lake is primarily managed for muskellunge and secondarily managed for bluegill and largemouth bass.  Since 1987, Lake Rebecca has been Minnesota's primary source for Leech Lake strain muskellunge eggs.  While there is a 48-inch minimum size limit on muskellunge, it is important for anglers to handle these fish carefully and return them to the water quickly to ensure these fish will be able to contribute to future generations of Minnesota muskellunge.   <br> \n <br> \nA fish population assessment was conducted during the first week in June 2011 to evaluate the size structure and abundance of game fish species in the lake.  Only trap nets were used during this assessment to limit physically damaging and physiologically stressing muskellunge. <br> \n <br> \nDuring the June summer assessment, 5 muskellunge were sampled, ranging in length from 37.0 to 41.3 inches in length.  Early every spring, muskellunge are netted for the egg-take operation.  In spring 2011, 48 were netted, averaging 39.5 inches and 14.8 lbs, with the largest reaching 45.7 inches and 28.1 lbs.      <br> \n <br> \nBluegill abundance is high (260.9/ trap net).  Historically this has been the case as the previous 4 assessments have averaged 215.5 per net.  Size structure has not changed much over the previous assessments and continues to be small.  Bluegill averaged 6.1 inches long and 0.17 lbs, with the largest reaching 7.1 inches and 0.25 lbs.  Thirty-six percent of bluegill sampled were between 3 and 6 inches, and the majority (64%) were between 6 and 7.1 inches (PSD = 64).  Bluegill body condition was good; however there was a decrease in condition for fish over 6 inches in length.  Ages ranged from 2 through 7, with the 2006 (45% of the total sampled) and 2007 (35% of the total sampled) year classes being the most abundant.  Growth was slow compared to the statewide average.  At age 3, bluegill averaged 4.8 inches, and at age 6 they averaged 6.6 inches.       <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie abundance is moderately high (16.0/ trap net).  Crappie catch over the previous 4 assessments has varied from 7.2 to 25.4 per net, averaging 20.9 per net.  Black crappie averaged 7.3 inches and 0.21 lbs, with the largest reaching 9.1 inches and 0.40 lbs.  Size structure has improved from the previous assessment in 2005, where black crappie averaged 6.5 inches and 0.14 lbs.   In 2011, 83% were between 5 and 8 inches  (PSD = 16), and 16% were 8 inches or longer.  Black crappie body condition was good on average but fish 5 to 8 inches were in better condition than fish 8 inches and longer.  Ages ranged from 2 through 6, with most fish evenly distributed between ages 2 through 5.  Growth was average until age 5, when it slowed considerably.  Black crappie averaged 7.0 inches at age 3 and 8.3 inches at age 5.        <br> \n <br> \nSeventeen largemouth bass were collected during the assessment; however, passive sampling gears, such as trap nets, are not effective methods for collecting largemouth bass.  The data presented for this species is not indicative of relative abundance or size structure.  Electrofishing is the typical method for largemouth bass assessments but was not conducted during this survey.  Mean size was 9.4 inches and 0.38 pounds with the largest reaching 11.9 inches and 0.68 lbs.  A largemouth bass fishery is present in Lake Rebecca; however a full, accurate status of the adult population can't made based on this survey's net-based sampling.        <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled in low abundance were black bullhead (0.20/net), common carp (0.80/net), golden shiner (3.20/net), hybrid sunfish (1.20/net), pumpkinseed (8.9 / net), and yellow perch (1.50/net). <br> \n <br> \nAn assessment of fish in the shallow, nearshore habitats was also conducted using backpack electrofishing and seining.  Seven species were sampled, the two most abundant were bluegill and black crappie.  Other species sampled were central mudminnow, green sunfish, hybrid sunfish, largemouth bass, and yellow perch.   The purpose of the nearshore sampling is to calculate an Index of Biotic Integrity score.  An Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) is estimated based on all fish sampled in this assessment.  The absence of sensitive species such as minnows and darters contribute to a low IBI score.  <br> \n</p>",
