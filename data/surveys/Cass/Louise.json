Bullhead fishing has been good with large numbers being caught some years and very few other years with the same amount of fishing pressure.Special Problems and Conditions:Partial winterkill 1962.  Bullhead and perch populations appear to be large.  Lake fluctuates considerably with season and the presence of beaver dams in oulet and/or inlet.Additional Field Notes:Beaver dam (approximatley 300 feet long, six feet high, holding approximately 5 ft. head of water) near mouth of inlet from Blind Lake, flooding approximately 80 acres of woods and field. (No flow measurements available.)Five mallards, 12 blue-wing teal, 3 wood ducks observed in west bay of lake.  Food sources good, brood cover poor, loafing sites poor.</p>",

The 1990 sample exhibited good quality.Net catches of bullheads were considerably lower during 1990 than from previous assessments.The bluegill trapnet catch of 23.0/net is equivalent to the catch from the 1983 assessment, but considerably higher than the catches from the 1966 and 1976 assessments.  The quality indices, PSD and RSD, were considerably lower in 1990 compared to previous assessments.  The growth of bluegill from Lake Louise is fast.Few largemouth bass were sampled.  Night electrofishing needs to be conducted to better assess this population.Black crappie net catches are high when compared to most area lakes.  The sample collected was dominated by fish 5 to 7 inches long.  Several year classes were sampled.  The growth rate for black crappie is slow.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Louise Lake is a 46-acre lake with a maximum depth of 26 feet.  It is located 14 miles east of Backus in northern Cass County.  Based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics, the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types.  Louise Lake is in Lake Class 21.  Other area lakes in this same class include Blind (located 1.5 miles east of Louise Lake), Silver (located four miles southeast of Whipholt), and Stocking (located four miles south of Whipholt).  There is a user-developed access on county land on the north side of the lake.Northern pike were quite abundant in Louise Lake.  Sampled northern pike ranged in length from 11 to 27 inches and had an average length and weight of 21 inches and 2.3 pounds.  These averages are similar to previous test netting.  However, fewer large northern pike (> 28 inches) were sampled in 1995.  Northern pike grew at a rate that was comparable to other area class 23 lakes.An excellent population of bluegill exists both in quantity and quality.  More than 33% of the sampled bluegill were seven inches or greater in length.  However, bluegill have declined in quality over the past thirty years.  In 1966,  59 percent of sampled bluegill were seven inches or greater.A sample of twenty-two black crappie were collected that ranged in length from 3.8 - 9.3 inches.None of these fish were older than four years of age.The primary food fish for large predators was yellow perch.  Yellow perch were sampled at rates similar to 1990 test netting and area class 21 lakes.  Sampled yellow perch ranged in length from 4 to 8.9 inches.Other species of fish sampled include pumpkinseed, yellow bullhead, brown bullhead, black bullhead, green sunfish, and largemouth bass.To help maintain quality fish populations in Louise Lake, lake users should safeguard aquatic habitats by preserving or reestablishing aquatic plants and natural shorelines.  Aquatic and terrestrial plants provide food and cover for fish and wildlife. They also help protect shorelines from erosion, and absorb nutrients and pollutants.  Natural shorelines, shorelines that have not been altered by man, help protect a lake from silt-laden runoff waters. They also provide excellent places for wildlife to feed, hide, and raise their young. Protection of the Louise Lake watershed is also  needed for maintaining  water quality.Anglers can help maintain or improve the quality of fishing by practicing catch and release of medium to large-sized fish. Releasing these fish will help maintain the fish population in Louise Lake and provides anglers with more opportunities to catch more large fish in the future.</p>",
