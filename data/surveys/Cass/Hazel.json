It was first used as a stream-trout lake in 1960.  The lake was rehabilitated in 1972, and rainbow trout have stocked each year since then.          Sixteen rainbow trout were sampled, and all the fish came from the 1999 stocking.  The average length of rainbow trout was 8.9 inches.  Low density and biomass of zooplankton which is an important food for rainbow trout may be a contributing factor to the lack of older fish sampled in Hazel Lake.</p>",

Gill net catch rates have varied since this lake was initially surveyed in 1959 and since 1988 the management goal of 10-20 rainbow trout/ gill net set has only been achieved twice, in 1988 and 1995.  Several anglers have indicated that fishing for rainbow trout on Hazel Lake is poor.   </p>",

Hazel Lake is one of five lakes in the Walker Fisheries Management Area stocked annually with rainbow trout.  The other designated stream trout lakes in the Walker Management Area are Diamond, Perch, Teepee and Willard Lakes. The trout population in Hazel Lake depends upon stocking because rainbow trout do not naturally reproduce in this lake.Hazel Lake was reclaimed in 1972 and rainbow trout have been stocked each year.  Gill net catch rates have varied since this lake was initially surveyed in 1959.  Since 1988, the management goal of 10 to 20 fish per lift has only been achieved three times, in 1988, 1995, and 2003.  The other goal of three year-classes of rainbow trout present was met this year.  The average length was 11 inches and the lengths ranged from 8 to 15 inches.  Since 1998, Fisheries personnel have been sampling zooplankton, the tiny animals on which Hazel Lake rainbow trout feed.  The quantity of zooplankton available in Hazel Lake is relatively low and biologists are currently investigating the annual fluctuation in trout survival by examining the food supply.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p> <br> \nHazel Lake (DOW #11-0295; Lake Class 21) is a 14.7 acre lake located near Longville, MN. There is a US Forest Service owned public access located on the south shore of the lake at the end of a US Forest Service trail. Hazel Lake has 0.71 miles of shoreline, and a maximum depth of 38 feet. Hazel Lake offers rainbow trout fishing in a remote, wilderness-like setting. The lake is totally within the Chippewa National Forest and the shoreline is undeveloped. Because of its small size, the lake is ideal for canoes or float tubes. Hazel Lake is one of four lakes in the Walker Fisheries Management Area stocked annually with Rainbow Trout. The other designated stream-trout lakes in the Walker Management Area are Diamond, Perch, and Teepee Lakes.  <br> \n <br> \nHazel Lake was first used as a stream trout lake in 1959 after being reclaimed. Rainbow Trout do not reproduce in this lake and the population is instead supported entirely by stocking to provide unique angling opportunities. The average length of Rainbow Trout sampled in 2015 was 12 inches and lengths ranged from 10 to 17 inches. Historically, Hazel has had some over summer-winter survival leading to larger fish. The majority of fish captured were likely from 2014 or previous stockings, offering opportunities for larger fish. Catch rates were also the highest since 2006. In addition annual spring stockings should provide anglers Rainbow Trout during the summer season. In January 2015, Hazel Lake was opened to winter trout fishing and provided increased opportunities for trout anglers in the Walker area. <br> \n <br> \nPeople can have significant impacts on lakes and the fish populations they support. Harvest, lakeshore development, removal of shoreline vegetation, and introductions of invasive species can all adversely affect fish populations. Currently no aquatic invasive species (AIS) have been identified in Hazel Lake. AIS are moved from infested to non-infested waters by anglers, boaters, and lake shore owners and can adversely impact lakes and fish populations. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access. If you suspect an infestation of an invasive species in this lake, save a specimen and report it to a local natural resource office. Additional information on all of these topics can be found on the DNR website (www.dnr.state.mn.us) or by contacting the Walker Area Fisheries office. <br> \n</p>",

All trout existing in the lake are the result of stocking.  Various strains of rainbow trout have been stocked over the years.  For the past several years, anglers have reported poor angling success in Hazel Lake.Testnetting results in 1999 sampled nine rainbow trout.  Trout ranged in length from 9.7 to 11.0 inches and all were from the 1998 stocking.  In 1998 and 1999, at various times through the summer, the lake was sampled for zooplankton (tiny animals that are important food for trout).  In 1998, low numbers of zooplankton were found.  Due to what appears to be limited food availability, the stocking quota was reduced by 50 percent starting in 1998.  In 1999, there appeared to be an increase in invertebrates especially Daphnia which is preferred by trout.  Further assessments will determine if this reduction in stocking has the potential to increase zooplankton numbers and ultimately angling success.</p>",

There is a Chippewa National Forest Service (CNF) owned public access on the south end of the lake at the end of a CNF trail. Hazel Lake offers rainbow trout fishing in a remote, wilderness-like setting. The lake is totally within the Chippewa National Forest and the shoreline is undeveloped. Because of its small size, the lake is ideal for canoes or float tubes. Hazel Lake is one of five lakes in the Walker Fisheries Management Area stocked annually with rainbow trout. The other designated stream-trout lakes in the Walker Management Area are Diamond, Perch, Teepee and Willard Lakes. The trout population in Hazel Lake depends upon stocking because rainbow trout do not naturally reproduce in this lake. <br> \n <br> \nHazel Lake was reclaimed in 1972 and rainbow trout have been stocked each year.  In 2008, five rainbow trout were captured, and the mean length was 13 inches. One rainbow trout captured was 18 inches long. Rainbow trout abundance has varied greatly with good abundance in 2006, 2003, 2000, and 1995; moderate abundance in 1999, 2002, 2007, and 2008; and low abundance in 1996, 1998, 2001, 2004, and 2005.  <br> \n <br> \nSince 1998, Fisheries personnel have been sampling zooplankton, a significant food source for Hazel Lake rainbow trout.  The quantity of zooplankton available in Hazel Lake is relatively low and biologists are currently investigating the relationship of stocking rates and size of trout stocked to the abundance of large zooplankton and trout survival in stream-trout lakes.   <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Hazel Lake is a 14.7-acre lake with 0.71 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 38 feet located near Longville, MN. The lake is accessible via a US Forest Service owned public access located on the south shore of the lake at the end of a US Forest Service trail. That trail splits off USFS Road 2850 which is 4 miles West of Longville on County Road 5. Hazel Lake offers Rainbow Trout fishing in a remote, wilderness-like setting. The lake is entirely within the Chippewa National Forest and the shoreline is undeveloped. Because of its small size, the lake is ideal for canoes or float tubes. Hazel Lake was first used as a stream trout lake in 1959 after being reclaimed. Hazel Lake is one of five lakes in the Walker Fisheries Management Area stocked annually with Rainbow Trout. The other designated stream-trout lakes in the Walker Management Area are Diamond, Perch, and Teepee Lakes. Long Lake, just north of Longville is also stocked with Rainbow Trout but it is not a designated trout lake.  <br> \n <br> \nRainbow Trout do not reproduce in this lake and the population is supported entirely by stocking to provide a unique angling opportunity. The Rainbow Trout gill net catch rate of 32.5 fish per net was the second highest observed historically. The average length of Rainbow Trout sampled in 2018 was 11 inches and lengths ranged from 8 to 13 inches. Historically, Hazel has produced fish greater than 15 inches. <br> \n <br> \nPeople can have significant impacts on lakes and the fish populations they support. Harvest, lakeshore development, removal of shoreline vegetation, and introductions of invasive species can all adversely affect fish populations. Currently, no aquatic invasive species (AIS) have been identified in Hazel Lake. AIS are moved from infested to non-infested waters by anglers, boaters, and lakeshore owners and can adversely impact lakes and fish populations. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access. If you suspect an infestation of an invasive species in this lake, save a specimen and report it to a local natural resource office. Additional information on all of these topics can be found on the DNR website (www.dnr.state.mn.us) or by contacting the Walker Area Fisheries office. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Hazel Lake (DOW #11-295; Lake Class 21) is a 14.7 acre lake located near Longville, MN. There is a US Forest Service owned public access located on the south shore of the lake at the end of a US Forest Service trail. Hazel Lake has 0.71 miles of shoreline, and a maximum depth of 38 feet. Hazel Lake offers rainbow trout fishing in a remote, wilderness-like setting. The lake is totally within the Chippewa National Forest and the shoreline is undeveloped. Because of its small size, the lake is ideal for canoes or float tubes. Hazel Lake is one of four lakes in the Walker Fisheries Management Area stocked annually with Rainbow Trout. The other designated stream-trout lakes in the Walker Management Area are Diamond, Perch, and Teepee Lakes.  <br> \n <br> \nHazel Lake was first used as a stream trout lake in 1959 after being reclaimed. Rainbow Trout do not reproduce in this lake and the population is instead supported entirely by stocking to provide unique angling opportunities. The average length of Rainbow Trout sampled in 2014 was 14 inches and lengths ranged from 12 to 15 inches. Historically, Hazel has had some over summer-winter survival leading to larger fish. The majority of fish captured were likely from 2013 or previous stockings, offering opportunities for larger fish. While catch rates were down from previous years, annual spring stockings should provide anglers Rainbow Trout during the summer season. In January 2015 Hazel Lake was opened to winter Trout fishing, providing increased opportunities for trout anglers in the Walker area. <br> \n <br> \nPeople can have significant impacts on lakes and the fish populations they support. Harvest, lakeshore development, removal of shoreline vegetation, and introductions of invasive species can all adversely affect fish populations. Currently not aquatic invasive species (AIS) have been identified in Hazel Lake. AIS are moved from infested to non-infested waters by anglers, boaters, and lake shore owners and can adversely impact lakes and fish populations. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access. If you suspect an infestation of an invasive species in this lake, save a specimen and report it to a local natural resource office. Additional information on all of these topics can be found on the DNR website (www.dnr.state.mn.us) or by contacting the Walker Area Fisheries office. <br> \n</p>",

This was also the case in 1996 with the same amount of sampling effort.  At various times through the summer, the lake was  sampled for zooplankton (tiny animals that are important food for trout).  Low numbers of zooplankton were found.  Due to what appears to be limited food availability, the stocking quota was reduced by 50 percent.  Further assessments will determine if this reduction      has the potential to improve angling success.</p>",
