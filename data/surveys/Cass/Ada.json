                "narrative": "<p>Ada Lake is a 963-acre lake with 7.21 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 60 feet located east of Backus, MN. A DNR owned public access is located on the northeast shore. The DNR has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different classes based on physical, chemical and other characteristics. Ada Lake is in Lake Class 27; lakes in this class are fairly deep and large. Other area lakes in this class include Crooked, Lower Sucker, Pleasant, Webb and Six Mile Lake. Ada Lake possesses a highly developed shoreline. The lake is primarily managed for Black Crappie, Bluegill, Largemouth Bass, and Northern Pike and secondarily for Walleye, Yellow Perch, and Cisco.  <br> \n <br> \nAda Lake provides multi-species angling opportunity with the potential to produce large fish. Northern Pike are abundant, exceeding the lake's maximum management goal. Sampled pike ranged from 14 to 39 inches long. Black Crappie catch rates met lake management size and catch goals and crappie 4 to 14 inches were sampled. Walleye abundance in the lake is low (3.2 fish per net) and lengths ranged from 13 to 25 inches long. Programmed Walleye stocking was discontinued after 2015 and replaced with surplus Walleye fry, fingerlings, or larger fish stockings when available, the most recent of which was in 2021. Bluegill catch rates fell within the target management range and exceeded size goals with roughly half of sampled fish measuring 6 inches or longer. Cisco and Yellow Perch abundance has remained low across historic surveys, though have consistently been present in catch since initial surveying.  <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species that anglers can expect to encounter include, Brown Bullhead, Bowfin, Hybrid Sunfish, Pumpkinseed, Rock Bass, White Sucker, and Yellow Bullhead. <br> \n <br> \nPeople can have significant impacts on lakes and the fish populations they support. Harvest, lakeshore development, removal of shoreline vegetation, and introductions of invasive species can all adversely affect fish populations. Currently, no aquatic invasive species (AIS) have been identified in Ada Lake. AIS are moved from infested to non-infested waters by anglers, boaters, and lake shore owners and can adversely impact lakes and fish populations. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access. If you suspect an infestation of an invasive species in this lake, save a specimen and report it to a local natural resource office. Additional information on all of these topics can be found on the DNR website (www.dnr.state.mn.us) or by contacting the Walker Area Fisheries office. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Ada Lake is a 975 acre lake with a maximum depth of 60 feet.  The lake is located six miles east of Backus.  The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different lake classes based on physical and chemical characteristics.  Ada Lake is in lake class 27.  Other area lakes in the same lake class include: Pleasant, Lower Sucker, Thirteen, and Webb Lakes.  Approximately 43% of the lake is 15 feet or less in depth.  There is a DNR concrete public access on the northeast end of the lake off of County Road 43.  Ada Lake provides fishing for northern pike, walleye, bluegill, black crappie, and largemouth bass.  The lake is managed primarily for northern pike, largemouth bass, and walleye.Walleye abundance was similar to most past surveys but below what is typically found in other lake class 27 lakes.  Sampled walleye ranged in length from 14 to 27 inches with an average length and weight of 18 inches and two pounds.  Age three walleye (1994 year class) comprised 59% of the sample.  There appears to be a      reduction in the  walleye natural reproduction compared to earlier years.  The reason for this is unknown at this time.  The DNR is stocking walleye fry or fingerlings periodically to help sustain the walleye population.  Growth was good when compared to other lake class 27 lakes.  A four year old walleye was 15 inches long.Northern pike are abundant and can offer the angler much action.  Anglers can expect to catch numerous northern pike 18 - 20 inches long with the opportunity to catch one over 30 inches long.  Many year classes were present in the sample indicating that spawning areas and subsequently natural reproduction is adequate for      Ada Lake.  There is competition between northern pike and walleye for the few yellow perch as a food source.  This could be impacting growth and survival of walleye to catchable size. If the angler wants plenty of action then bluegill would be a good choice.  Bluegill were sampled in the testnets at rates that were highter than what is found in other lake class 27 lakes.  Expect to catch bluegill three to eight inches long.Largemouth bass is another abundant fish for anglers to catch.  Bass up to 17 inches were sampled by DNR personnel.Other fish that make up the diverse fish community of Ada Lake include black crappie, bullheads, rock bass, white sucker, and cisco.There has been much development on Ada Lake.  In 1975 there were 144 lake homes on Ada Lake, however, by 1995 numbers had increased to 192.  This development has likely impacted fish habitat and water quality.  There is evidence that much bulrush has been removed around the lake.  Earlier surveys indicated that      bulrush was more abundant than it is now.  This increase in riparian development has impacted other aquatic habitat used by fish during different life stages. Lakeshore that is not currently developed is some of the most sensitive and important shoreline for maintaining water quality and fish habitat.  These shorelines and shallow water areas with their aquatic plants, help protect the lake from erosion and absorb nutrients and pollutants as well as provide excellent places for wildlife and      fish to feed, hide, and raise their young.  Protection of the larger watershed that drains into Ada Lake is also needed to maintain water quality.  Based on the increasing value of lakeshore in this area, there will be much demand to develop the remaining lakeshore on Ada Lake.Anglers can help maintain or improve the quality of fishing by practicing catch and release of medium to large-sized fish.  Information obtained from DNR creel surveys on area lakes shows that less than 20% of the walleye 20 inches or larger that were caught by anglers were released.  Releasing these fish will help maintain the quality of the fish population and provide anglers with more opportunities to catch more large fish in the future.       </p>",

The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MNDNR) has classified Minnesota lakes into 43 different classes based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics.  Ada Lake is in Lake Class 27; lakes in the class are generally very large, deep, regularly shaped lakes.  This lake is primarily managed for northern pike, largemouth bass, and walleye and secondarily for bluegill, black crappie, yellow perch, and tullibee (cisco).     Northern pike are abundant in Ada Lake and the 2004 catch rate was the historical high for Ada Lake.  The mean length for northern pike was 18 inches and fish up to 36 inches were sampled.  A 24- to 36-inch protected slot for northern pike was implemented in 2003.  Largemouth bass are present in Ada Lake and fish up to 18 inches are present.  Though Ada Lake has been stocked with walleye fry or fingerlings on an every other year basis, walleye abundance is relatively low.  The walleye population consists of larger fish (27% of the walleye sampled were greater than 25 inches); the mean length was 19 inches and fish up to 28 inches were sampled.  Other fish species that are available to anglers to catch are black crappie, bluegill, bowfin (dogfish), brown bullhead, pumpkinseed sunfish, rock bass, tullibee (cisco), white sucker, yellow bullhead, and yellow perch.     Anglers can help maintain or improve the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for table fare, but encourages release of medium- to large-sized fish.  Releasing these fish can help maintain balance in the fish community in Ada Lake and provide anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future.  Shoreline areas on the land and into the shallow water provide essential habitat for fish and wildlife that live in or near Minnesota's lakes.  Overdeveloped shorelines can't support the fish, wildlife, and clean water that are associated with natural undeveloped lakes. The combined effects of all lakeshore owners \"fixing up\" their property can destroy a lake's valuable natural shorelines.Shoreline habitat consists of aquatic plants, woody plants and natural lake bottom soils.Plants in the water and at the water's edge provide habitat, prevent erosion and absorb excess nutrients. Shrubs, trees, and woody debris such as fallen trees or limbs provide good habitat both above and below the water and should be left in place.  Natural lake bottom materials like silt or gravel are more ecologically productive than pure sand trucked in for a swimming beach.  A tidy lawn and a sandy beach make great spots for sunbathing and swimming but do little to provide habitat for fish and wildlife. By leaving a buffer strip of natural vegetation along the shoreline, property owners can reduce erosion, help maintain water quality, and provide habitat and travel corridors for wildlife.Only if more lakeshore owners manage their shoreline in a natural condition can fish and wildlife populations on Minnesota lakes remain healthy and abundant.  More specific information on protecting or restoring shorelines and watersheds is available through the local DNR Fisheries office.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Ada Lake is a 963-acre lake located east of Backus, Minnesota that has 7.21 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 60 ft. There is a state owned public access on the north shore. The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MNDNR) has classified Minnesota lakes into 43 different classes based on physical, chemical and other characteristics.  Ada Lake is in Lake Class 27; lakes in this class are generally large, deep, regularly shaped lakes.  This lake is primarily managed for Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, and Walleye, and secondarily for Bluegill, Black Crappie, Yellow Perch, and Tullibee (Cisco).  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike are abundant in Ada Lake. A 24 to 36 inch protected slot limit was implemented in 2003 to increase the proportion of larger pike in the population.  The average length of Northern Pike sampled in 2016 was 18 inches and lengths ranged from 10 to 37 inches. The proportion of Northern Pike 24 inches or longer increased steadily since 2004-2012 but decreased slightly in 2016.  Largemouth Bass are typically smaller; lengths ranged from 4 to 15 inches and averaged 11 inches during this survey. Largemouth Bass longer than 18 inches long have been sampled in previous assessments. Ada Lake has been heavily stocked with varying combinations of Walleye fry, fingerlings, yearlings, and adults since 1971, yet abundance remains very low when compared to similar lakes.  Average Walleye length was 19 inches and fish up to 24 inches were sampled in 2016. . Black Crappie sampled in 2016 averaged 9 inches and lengths ranged from 7 to 12 inches.  Bluegill abundance was similar to other Class 27 lakes.  Average length of Bluegill was 5 inches and fish up to about 10 inches were sampled. Yellow Perch numbers are also at very low levels, as only two Yellow Perch were sampled in 2016.   Tullibee (Cisco) numbers rebounded from 2012. The abundance of Black Crappie appears to be slightly above average when compared to similar lakes. Other species available for anglers include bowfin (dogfish), brown bullhead, rock bass, yellow bullhead, and pumpkinseed sunfish. <br> \n <br> \nPeople can have significant impacts on lakes and the fish populations they support.  Harvest, lakeshore development, removal of shoreline vegetation, and introductions of invasive species can all adversely affect fish populations.  Rusty crayfish and banded mystery snails are aquatic invasive species (AIS) currently identified in Ada Lake.  AIS are moved from infested to non-infested waters by anglers, boaters, and lake shore owners and can adversely impact lakes and fish populations.  To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access.  If you suspect an infestation of an invasive species in this lake, save a specimen and report it to a local natural resource office.  Additional information on all of these topics can be found on the DNR website (www.dnr.state.mn.us) or by contacting the Walker Area Fisheries office. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Ada Lake is a 974-acre lake with a maximum depth of 60 feet.  The lake is located six miles east of Backus.  The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different lake classes based on physical and chemical characteristics.  Ada Lake is in Lake Class 27.  Other area lakes in the same lake class include: Pleasant, Lower Sucker, Thirteen, and Webb Lakes.  Approximately 44% of the lake is 15 feet or less in depth.  There is a DNR concrete public access on the northeast end of the lake off of County Road 43.  Ada Lake provides fishing for northern pike, walleye, bluegill, black crappie, and largemouth bass.  The lake is managed primarily for northern pike, largemouth bass, and walleye.      Walleye abundance during the 2001 assessment was similar to most past surveys but below what is typically found in other Lake Class 27 lakes.  Sampled walleye ranged in length from 7 to 23 inches.  Walleye reproduce naturally in Ada Lake, however the DNR has stocked walleye fry (newly hatched from the egg) or fingerlings (fish less than one year old which are generally 4 to 6 inches long) periodically in an effort to increase the walleye population. This stocking has been intensified in recent years.  In May 2001, walleye fry were stocked into Ada Lake.  Low numbers of walleye fingerlings (from 2001 natural reproduction or fry stocking) were sampled in September 2001, so fingerlings were stocked in fall 2001 also.       Northern pike are abundant in Ada Lake and can offer anglers much action.  Many of the northern pike in Ada Lake are less than 20 inches long, however larger fish (up to 30 inches) were also sampled by DNR personnel in 2001.  Many year classes were present in the sample indicating that spawning areas and subsequently natural reproduction is adequate for Ada Lake.  Competition with northern pike could be impacting growth and survival of walleye to catchable size.      Bluegill from 3 to 7 inches long were found during the 2001 survey.  Largemouth bass are abundant in Ada Lake, and DNR personnel sampled bass up to 18 inches long. Other fish that make up the diverse fish community of Ada Lake include black crappie, bullheads, rock bass, white sucker, and cisco.     There has been much development on Ada Lake.  In 1975 there were 144 lake homes on Ada Lake, however, by 1995 the number of homes had increased to 192.  Shoreline areas - on the land and into the shallow water - provide essential habitat for fish and wildlife that live in or near Minnesota's lakes.  Overdeveloped shorelines can't support the fish, wildlife, and clean water that are associated with natural undeveloped lakes. The combined effects of all lakeshore owners \"fixing up\" their property can destroy a lake's valuable natural shorelines.     Shoreline habitat consists of aquatic plants, woody plants and natural lake bottom soils.  Plants in the water and at the water's edge provide habitat, prevent erosion and absorb excess nutrients. Shrubs, trees, and woody debris such as fallen trees or limbs provide good habitat both above and below the water and should be left in place.  Natural lake bottom materials like silt or gravel are more ecologically productive than pure sand trucked in for a swimming beach.  A tidy lawn and a sandy beach make great spots for sunbathing and swimming but do little to provide habitat for fish and wildlife. By leaving a buffer strip of natural vegetation along the shoreline, property owners can reduce erosion, help maintain water quality, and provide habitat and travel corridors for wildlife.     Lakeshore owners need to manage their shoreline in a natural condition if fish and wildlife populations on Minnesota lakes are to remain healthy and abundant.  More specific information on protecting or restoring shorelines and watersheds is available through MN DNR Fisheries offices.         Anglers can help maintain or improve the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for table fare, but encourages release of medium- to large-size fish.  Releasing these fish can help maintain balance in the fish community in Ada Lake and provide anglers with opportunities to catch more and larger fish in the future.       </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Ada is a 974-acre lake located eight miles east of Backus, Minnesota in northern Cass County.  The lake has a maximum depth of 60 feet with 44 percent of the lake less than 15 feet deep.  A state-owned public access is located at the north end of the lake.The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types, based on physical, chemical and other characteristics.  Ada is in Lake Class 27.  Other area lakes in this classification include Pleasant (two miles east of Hackensack), Portage (six miles north of Hackensack), and Webb (six miles east of Hackensack).The Walleye catch during the 1995 survey was 2.5 fish per experimental gill net. This catch was below the average for other lakes of this class.  Walleye sampled during this survey averaged 2.8 lbs. and ranged in length from 11.0 to 26.9 inches. The average length at age four was 17.5 inches and indicated good growth. Ada Lake had been stocked with walleye 10 of the past 15 years. However, age and growth analysis revealed walleye originating in years stocking never occurred. This shows that some walleye natural reproduction does in Ada Lake. Ada has a good population of northern pike in terms of numbers and size.  The abundance of northern pike (4.9 fish/gill net) was similar to other lakes of the same type.  The average weight of sampled northern pike was 2.6 lbs. Of northern pike 14 inches or longer, about 10 percent were greater than 28 inches.  Growth of northern pike in Ada was close to that found in other lakes of this type. The average length at age four was 22.2 inches.Bluegill were abundant in the 1995 trap net sample (45.3 fish/net).  This catch rate was similar to several previous surveys, but higher than in most lakes of this class. About 20 percent of the sampled bluegill were 6 inches or longer.  The bluegill growth rate was slow with the average bluegill just 4.0 inches long at age five.The trap net catch rate of pumpkinseed (3.2 fish/net) was average for lakes of this type.  Of the pumpkinseed sampled in 1995, 38 percent were in the 6-inch category, while 8 percent were in the seven-inch group.Largemouth bass were abundant in trap nets (1.4 fish/net).  Similar to previous surveys, sampled largemouth bass ranged in length from 5.0 to 14.9 inches. Age and growth analysis revealed growth similar to lakes of this type. The average length at age four was 9.6 inches.Black crappie abundance in Ada (1.3 fish/trap net) was close to that found in most Class 27 lakes.  Sampled black crappie ranged in length from 4.0 to 10.7 inches. Growth was slightly slower in Ada than in other Class 27 lakes in this area.  Ada Lake black crappie averaged 7.7 inches at age four.Few yellow perch or cisco (tullibee) were caught in the 1995 survey.  Other species sampled included: bowfin, white sucker, yellow bullhead, brown bullhead, and rock bass. To help maintain quality fish populations in Ada Lake, lake users should safeguard aquatic habitat by preserving or reestablishing aquatic plants and natural shorelines.  Aquatic and terrestrial plants provide food and cover for fish and wildlife. They also help protect shorelines from erosion and absorb nutrients and pollutants.  Natural shorelines, shorelines that have not been altered by man, help protect a lake from silt-laden runoff waters They also provide excellent places for wildlife to feed, hide, and raise their young. Protection of the Ada Lake watershed is also needed for maintaining water quality.Anglers can help maintain or improve the quality of fishing by practicing catch and release of medium to large-sized fish. Releasing these fish will help maintain the fish population in Ada Lake and provides anglers with more opportunities to catch more large fish in the future.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Ada Lake is a 974-acre lake located east of Backus, Minnesota that has 7.21 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 60 ft. There is a state owned public access on the north shore. The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MNDNR) has classified Minnesota lakes into 43 different classes based on physical, chemical and other characteristics.  Ada Lake is in Lake Class 27; lakes in this class are generally large, deep, regularly shaped lakes.  This lake is primarily managed for northern pike, largemouth bass, and walleye, and secondarily for bluegill, black crappie, yellow perch, and cisco (tullibee).  <br> \nNorthern pike are abundant in Ada Lake and a 24 to 36 inch protected slot limit was implemented in 2003 to increase the proportion of larger pike in the population.  The average length of northern pike sampled in 2012 was 18 inches, and fish sampled ranged from 10 to 40 inches. The abundance of northern pike compared favorably to other lakes in this class. The proportion of northern pike 24 inches or longer has increased steadily since 2004.  The largemouth bass population was the highest observed since the lake was first sampled in 1958.  The longest bass sampled in 2012 was 14 inches long.  Ada Lake has been heavily stocked with varying combinations of walleye fry, fingerlings and adults since 1971 yet walleye abundance is relatively low when compared to similar lakes.  While walleye numbers are low, the average length was 18 inches and fish up to 27 inches were sampled in 2012.  Yellow perch and cisco (tullibee) numbers are also at very low levels, as only seven yellow perch and one cisco were sampled in 2012.    The abundance of black crappie appears to be slightly above average when compared to similar lakes. Black crappie sampled in 2012 averaged about 8 inches, with fish up to 12 inches being found.  Bluegill abundance was similar to other Class 27 lakes.  Average length of bluegill was about 6 inches and fish up to about 8 inches were sampled.  Other species available for anglers include bowfin (dogfish), brown bullhead, rock bass, yellow bullhead, and pumpkinseed sunfish.  <br> \nPeople can have significant impacts on lakes and the fish populations they support.  Harvest, lakeshore development, removal of shoreline vegetation, and introductions of invasive species can all adversely affect fish populations.  Currently the only aquatic invasive species (AIS) that have been identified in Ada Lake are the rusty crayfish and the banded mystery snail.  AIS are moved from infested to non-infested waters by anglers, boaters, and lake shore owners and can adversely impact lakes and fish populations.  To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access.  If you suspect an infestation of an invasive species in this lake, save a specimen and report it to a local natural resource office.  Additional information on all of these topics can be found on the DNR website (www.dnr.state.mn.us) or by contacting the Walker Area Fisheries office. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Ada Lake is a 974-acre lake located east of Backus, Minnesota that has 7.21 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 60 ft. There is a state-owned public access on the north shore. The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MNDNR) has classified Minnesota lakes into 43 different classes based on physical, chemical and other characteristics.  Ada Lake is in Lake Class 27; lakes in this class are generally very large, deep, regularly shaped lakes.  This lake is primarily managed for northern pike, largemouth bass, and walleye, and secondarily for bluegill, black crappie, yellow perch, and cisco (tullibee).  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike are abundant in Ada Lake.  The average length of northern pike sampled in 2007 was 19 inches, and fish ranged from 10 to 38 inches. The abundance of northern pike compared favorably to other lakes in this class. Since 2003, there has been a 24- to 36-inch protected slot limit for northern pike on Ada Lake.  This regulation is intended to improve the size structure of the northern pike population.  Since this regulation was put in place, the percentage of northern pike 24 inches or larger has increased.  Largemouth bass up to 18 inches were sampled. Though Ada Lake has been stocked with walleye fry or fingerlings at high levels on an every other year basis, walleye abundance is low.  The walleye population consists of larger fish.  The walleye average length was 19 inches and fish up to 26 inches were sampled in 2007.  The abundance of black crappie appears to be good.  Black crappie sampled in 2007 averaged about 8 inches in length, however fish up to 12 inches were found. Bluegill abundance was similar to other lakes in this Lake Class.  Average length of bluegill was about 6 inches, however fish up to about 9 inches were caught.  Other species available for anglers include bowfin (dogfish), brown bullhead, cisco (tullibee), hybrid sunfish, pumpkinseed sunfish, rock bass, white sucker, yellow bullhead, and yellow perch.  <br> \n <br> \nAnglers can help maintain or improve the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for table fare, but encourages release of medium- to large-sized fish.  Releasing these fish can help maintain balance in the fish community in Ada Lake and provide anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future.   <br> \n <br> \nShoreline areas on the land and into the shallow water provide essential habitat for fish and wildlife that live in or near Minnesota\u0019s lakes.  Overdeveloped shorelines can\u0019t support the fish, wildlife, and clean water that are associated with natural undeveloped lakes.   <br> \n <br> \nShoreline habitat consists of aquatic plants, woody plants and natural lake bottom soils.  Plants in the water and at the water\u0019s edge provide habitat, prevent erosion and absorb excess nutrients. Shrubs, trees, and woody debris such as fallen trees or limbs provide good habitat both above and below the water and should be left in place.  By leaving a buffer strip of natural vegetation along the shoreline, property owners can reduce erosion, help maintain water quality, and provide habitat and travel corridors for wildlife.</p>",
