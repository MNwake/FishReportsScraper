                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of nearshore fish species in Hay Lake was conducted on August 12th, 2019 by Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program Staff.  This survey was a repeated survey conducted to study variability of fish surveys during the season.  Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible.  Backpack electrofishing was completed at 10 sampling stations, but two stations were sampled from the boat due to site conditions.  Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample four stations, a 15-foot seine was used at four stations, and site conditions prevented the use of seines at two stations.  Nearshore sampling captured 18 species of fish including six species that are intolerant of disturbance (Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiners, Blacknose Shiners, Iowa Daters, Pugnose Shiners, and Rock Bass) and zero that are tolerant of disturbance. <br> \n <br> \nA concurrent summer trap net survey was conducted on August 12th-14th, 2019 by IBI Program Staff. Nine trap nets were set along the shoreline and in shallow offshore locations that encompassed multiple habitat types.  Bluegill and Yellow Bullhead comprised a majority of the trap net catch by number and Yellow Bullhead, Bluegill, and Northern Pike comprised a majority of the catch by biomass.  <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore and trap net data were combined with gill net data from a July 2019 survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based IBI (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment.  In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g. Blackchin Shiners, Blacknose Shiners, Pugnose Shiners), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g. Common Carp, Black Bullheads, Fathead Minnows).  The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake.  For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.   <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey and an earlier 2019 survey had similar FIBI scores. Combined, this indicates that Hay Lake is in good health, with FIBI scores above the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes.  Data from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Pine River Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.</p>",

HAY LAKE IS 350 ACRES, HAS 4.9 MILES OF SHORELINE AND A MAXIMUM DEPTH OF 56 FEET.  THERE IS ONE OUTLET.  THE SHOAL WATER SOILS ARE 75% SAND, 15% MUCK, 5% RUBBLE-BOULDER AND 5% GRAVEL.  SECCHI READING WAS 9 FEET.  TOTAL ALKALINITY WAS 80.5 PPM.  SEVERAL EMERGENT AND SUBMERGED AQUATIC PLANTS WERE FOUND IN HAY LAKE AND MOST OF THE PLANTS HAD A SPARSE DENSITY RATING.TEST NETTING INDICATED A GOOD FISH POPULATION OF NORTHERN PIKE, YELLOW AND BROWN BULLHEAD, PUMPKINSEED, BLUEGILL, AND BLACK CRAPPIE.  SPAWNING AREAS ARE EXCELLENT FOR NORTHERN PIKE AND ARE GOOD FOR LARGEMOUTH BASS AND CENTRARCHIDS.  BLACK GRUB (NEASCUS) WAS THE ONLY PARASITE FOUND.

Two profiles were collected due to the size and complexity of the lake (i.e., Water Quality Station 1 and 2).  Based on the average of the two profiles, the top of the thermocline (i.e., the location in the water column with the sharpest transition from warm to cold water) occurred at approximately 13 feet. Dissolved oxygen decreased to below 3.0 mg/L at 21.5 feet in Water Quality Station 1 (WQ 1), and 10.0 feet in WQ 2, which were within the thermocline at the time of sampling. The temperature at which dissolved oxygen decreased to below 3.0 mg/L in WQ 1 (i.e., TDO3, a single variable to characterize oxythermal habitat) was 13.6?C (56.5?F). <br> \n <br> \nTDO3 values cooler than 21.5?C indicate that oxythermal conditions are favorable for Cisco. Dissolved oxygen concentrations within the thermocline indicate that suitable oxythermal habitat for Cisco was available across a range of depths at the time of sampling during the summer of 2023. However, data collected in 1996, 2001, 2006, 2004, and 2019 indicates oxythermal habitat that is marginal in most years, with the least favorable conditions recorded in 2001. When inadequate oxythermal habitat is available, Cisco are squeezed into unfavorable, warmer water conditions and therefore experience higher levels of stress.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of the nearshore fish community was conducted on June 26, 2019 by Fisheries Lake IBI program staff. Sampling stations were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at all 10 stations with three sites sampled from the boat due to site conditions. A 15-foot seine was used to sample two stations and a 50-foot seine was used to sample five stations. Nearshore sampling captured 17 native species of fish including six species (Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, Pugnose Shiner, Rock Bass) intolerant of habitat disturbance and no tolerant species. <br> \n <br> \nData from this targeted nearshore survey is combined with data from standard gill and trap netting surveys to calculate a Fish-based Index of Biological Integrity (FIBI) score that describes the overall health of the lake. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment.  The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. The FIBI score for Hay Lake based on this survey is above the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes.   <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Pine River Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.  <br> \n</p>",

THE 1991 RATE WAS SLIGHTLY ABOVE THE MEDIAN FOR LAKES IN THE SAME CLASS.  NORTHERN PIKE RANGED IN LENGTH FROM 14 TO 26 INCHES, WITH A MODE OF 16 INCHES.  THE MODE IN 1986 FOR NORTHERN PIKE WAS SLIGHTLY BETTER AT 18 INCHES.  HOWEVER, WHEN LOOKING AT THE PSD, THE 1991 ASSESSMENT HAD A HIGHER SCORE (29) THAN IN 1986 (3).  GROWTH WAS GOOD FOR ALL AGES.   WHEN LOOKING AT FORAGE AVAILABILITY, NO YELLOW PERCH OR WHITE SUCKER WERE CAUGHT.  THERE WERE SOME CISCO CAUGHT IN THE GILLNETS (1.50/LIFT).  SHORELINE SEINING NEEDS TO BE DONE DURING THE NEXT ASSESSMENT TO DEFINE THE QUALITY AND QUANTITY OF FORAGE FISH.WALLEYE ABUNDANCE (2.0/GN LIFT) WAS SLIGHTLY BETTER THAN IN 1986 (1.0/LIFT), BUT WASN'T SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT. WALLEYE CATCHES IN PREVIOUS SURVEYS RANGED FROM 0.3 TO 1.33.  THE 1991 ABUNDANCE OF WALLEYE FALLS BETWEEN THE FIRST QUARTILE AND MEDIAN FOR LAKE CLASS 25.  BY COMBINING SCALE SAMPLES COLLECTED DURING GILLNETTING AND ELECTROFISHING, WE WERE ABLE TO OBTAIN ENOUGH OF A SAMPLE TO DO AGE AND GROWTH CALCULATIONS.  THEY SHOWED GOOD GROWTH AT ALL AGES.  WHEN LOOKING AT THE LENGTH FREQUENCY SHEET FOR ELECTROFISHED WALLEYE, THERE WAS GOOD RECRUITMENT FROM 1989.  IT IS DIFFICULT TO DETERMINE IF THIS IS FROM NATURAL REPRODUCTION AND/OR STOCKING.  WHEN LOOKING AT THE LENGTH FREQUENCY SHEET FOR GILLNETTED WALLEYE, A GOOD VARIETY OF YEAR CLASSES ARE PRESENT.  THIS WOULD INDICATE CONSISTENT NATURAL REPRODUCTION.BLUEGILL ABUNDANCE FOR 1991 (10.50/TN LIFT) WAS BELOW THE HISTORICAL RANGE OF 15.67 TO 91.00.  THIS 1991 AVERAGE WAS EQUAL TO THE FIRST QUARTILE FOR LAKES WITHIN THE SAME LAKE CLASS.  WHEN LOOKING AT PSD AND RSD OVER THE LAST FOUR ASSESSMENTS (1967, 1980, 1986, 1991), THERE HAS BEEN A GENERAL DECLINE IN THE QUALITY OF BLUEGILL.  THE RSD-7 AND RSD-8 FOR 1967 WERE 52 AND 15 RESPECTIVELY.  WHEN COMARED TO THE 1991 LENGTHS, RSD-7 WAS 16 AND RSD-8 WAS 1.  THE ONLY EXCEPTION TO THIS DONWARD TREND IN QUALITY WAS THAT THE PSD WENT UP OVER THE PREVIOUS ASSESSMENT (1991=67 AND 1986=23).  GROWTH WAS SLOW FOR ALL AGES.  THE RANGE IN LENGTHS WAS FROM 3 TO 8 INCHES, WITH THE MODAL LENGTH BEING 6.5-6.9 INCHES.NIGHT ELECTROFISHING PRODUCED A GOOD SAMPLE OF 49 LARGEMOUTH BASS FOR A CPE OF 23.0/HOUR.  THEY RANGED IN LENGTH FROM 5 TO 16 INCHES, WITH BIMODAL LENGTH GROUPS OF 8.5-8.9 AND 12.0-12.9 INCHES.  AGES 2-7 WERE REPRESENTED WITH GROWTH SLOW DURING THE FIRST YEAR AND GOOD THE ENSUING YEARS.BLACK CRAPPIE WERE CAUGHT AT A RATE OF 1.33/TN LIFT, WHICH WAS TYPICAL OF LAKE CLASS 25 (MEDIAN=1.33).  THEY RANGED IN LENGTH FROM 8 TO 11 INCHES.  NIGHT ELECTROFISHING PRODUCED 21 BLACK CRAPPIE (CPE=9.9) THAT RANGED IN LENGTH FROM 5.5 TO 9.5 INCHES.  GROWTH WAS GOOD FOR ALL AGES.BLACK, BROWN, AND YELLOW BULLHEAD WERE CAUGHT IN LOW NUMBERS.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Hay Lake is a 350-acre lake with a maximum depth of 56 feet.  The lake is located ten miles east and three miles north of Backus, Minnesota.  The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different lake classes based on physical and chemical characteristics.  Hay Lake is in Lake Class 23.  Waters in this class are typically deep, clear, hard water lakes.  Other area waters in the same lake class include: Kid, Mule, and Stony Lakes.  Approximately 51% of the lake is 15 feet or less in depth.  There is a DNR-owned developed public access on the west side of the lake.  Hay Lake provides fishing for northern pike, walleye, bluegill, black crappie, and largemouth bass.  The lake is managed primarily for northern pike, largemouth bass, and black crappie.      The 2001 survey of Hay Lake showed an abundant population of smaller northern pike.  The average size northern pike sampled during the survey was about 18 inches, however several fish up to 33 inches were captured.  Many different year classes of northern pike were found, indicating good natural reproduction.  Bluegill were moderately abundant.  Most were small, though fish up to 8.9 inches were found during the 2001 survey.  Pumpkinseed sunfish were also found in Hay Lake, and fish up to 8.3 inches were sampled.  Hay Lake had a good population of largemouth bass, and DNR personnel sampled bass from 5 to 14 inches long. Black crappie were sampled during 2001, and fish up to 10 inches were found.  Walleye were not abundant during the 2001 survey, however those captured were large, ranging from 18 to 27 inches.  Other species that make up the fish community of Hay Lake include black bullhead, brown bullhead, yellow bullhead, yellow perch, rock bass, cisco (tullibee), and bowfin (dogfish).       Shoreline areas - on the land and into the shallow water - provide essential habitat for fish and wildlife that live in or near Minnesota's lakes.  Overdeveloped shorelines can't support the fish, wildlife, and clean water that are associated with natural undeveloped lakes. The combined effects of all lakeshore owners \"fixing up\" their property can destroy a lake's valuable natural shorelines.     Shoreline habitat consists of aquatic plants, woody plants and natural lake bottom soils.  Plants in the water and at the water's edge provide habitat, prevent erosion and absorb excess nutrients. Shrubs, trees, and woody debris such as fallen trees or limbs provide good habitat both above and below the water and should be left in place.  Natural lake bottom materials like silt or gravel are more ecologically productive than pure sand trucked in for a swimming beach.  A tidy lawn and a sandy beach make great spots for sunbathing and swimming but do little to provide habitat for fish and wildlife.  By leaving a buffer strip of natural vegetation along the shoreline, property owners can reduce erosion, help maintain water quality, and provide habitat and travel corridors for wildlife.     Lakeshore owners need to manage their shoreline in a natural condition if fish and wildlife populations on Minnesota lakes are to remain healthy and abundant.  More specific information on protecting or restoring shorelines and watersheds is available through MN DNR Fisheries offices.         Anglers can help maintain or improve the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for table fare, but encourages release of medium- to large-size fish.  Releasing these fish can help maintain balance in the fish community in Hay Lake and provide anglers with opportunities to catch more and larger fish in the future.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Hay Lake is a 350-acre lake located near Backus, Minnesota that has 5.22 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 56 feet.  There is a state-owned public access on the west shore.  The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MNDNR) has classified Minnesota lakes into 43 different classes based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics.  Hay Lake is in Lake Class 23. Lakes in the class are generally very deep and very clear lakes.   <br> \n <br> \nHay Lake has a good population of northern pike with fish up to 30 inches sampled.  The abundance of northern pike caught compared favorably to other lakes in this class.  Largemouth bass up to 15 inches were sampled.  The number of black crappie taken in DNR test nets was similar to numbers found in other lakes of this type, and some of these black crappie were close to 11 inches.  Bluegill abundance was similar to other lakes in this class.  The average length of bluegill was about 6 inches, and some fish over 7 inches were caught.  Only a few walleye were sampled, and these fish ranged from 26 to 28 inches.  Other species available for anglers include black bullhead, bowfin (dogfish), brown bullhead, cisco (tullibee), hybrid sunfish, rock bass, white sucker, and yellow bullhead   <br> \n <br> \nAnglers can help maintain or improve the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for table fare, but encourages release of medium- to large-sized fish.  Releasing these fish can help maintain balance in the fish community in Hay Lake and provide anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future.   <br> \n <br> \nShoreline areas on the land and into the shallow water provide essential habitat for fish and wildlife that live in or near Minnesotas lakes.  Overdeveloped shorelines cant support the fish, wildlife, and clean water that are associated with natural undeveloped lakes.  <br> \n <br> \nShoreline habitat consists of aquatic plants, woody plants and natural lake bottom soils.  Plants in the water and at the waters edge provide habitat, prevent erosion and absorb excess nutrients. Shrubs, trees, and woody debris such as fallen trees or limbs provide good habitat both above and below the water and should be left in place.  By leaving a buffer strip of natural vegetation along the shoreline, property owners can reduce erosion, help maintain water quality, and provide habitat and travel corridors for wildlife.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Hay Lake is a 350-acre lake with a maximum depth of 56 feet.  It is located three miles north and ten miles east of Backus.  The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different lake classes based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics.  Hay Lake is in lake class 23.  Other lakes in this same class include: Baby (located one mile north and six and a half miles east of Hackensack), Big Deep (located one mile south and five and a half miles east of Hackensack), Horseshoe (located one mile north and one and a half miles east of Backus), Kid (located six miles east of Hackensack), and Island (located three miles south and seven miles east of Longville) Lakes.Northern pike were sampled at a rate that was typical of past surveys and of other class 23 lakes.  Northern pike ranged in length from 10 to 28 inches with an average length and weight of 18.0 inches and 1.2 pounds.  Similar to previous surveys,  numerous smaller fish were sampled.  Growth was typical of other class 23 lakes.  A 19 inch northern pike was five years old.A total of 23 largemouth bass were sampled during night electrofishing.  These fish ranged in length from 5 to 19 inches with an average length and weight of 14.2 inches and 1.9 pounds.  Fifty-two percent of the bass were 15 inches or larger.  Growth was typical of other area class 23 lakes.  A 13.6 inch bass was five years old.A total of 28 black crappie were sampled when combining all sampling efforts. These fish ranged in length from 4.6 to 10 inches with an average length and weight of 6.3 inches and 0.2 pounds.  Black crappie growth was typical of other class 23 lakes.  A 10.6 inch crappie was five years old.Walleye were sampled at a rate that was similar to past surveys and of other class 23 lakes.  These fish ranged in length from 15 to 23 inches and had an average length and weight of 20.4 inches and 2.8 pounds.  Most of the walleye were five years old or older. Sixty-four percent of the walleye were 20 inches or larger.  Growth was typical of other area class 23 lakes.  An 18.8 inch walleye was five years old.Bluegill were abundant and ranged in length from 3.2 to 8.0 inches. The average length and weight of 5.8 inches and 0.15 pound.  Fifty-six percent of the bluegill were 6 inches or longer.  Growth was slow with a five year old bluegill being 4.1 inches long.  For lakes in this class, a five year old fish would be an inch longer.Although yellow perch and cisco are the main forage fish for northern pike and walleye, they were not found to be abundant.  Cisco, because of their fast growth, are used more by the larger, trophy-sized fish.All three species of bullheads were sampled with yellow bullhead being the most common.  Abundance of yellow bullhead is associated with good water quality.Other species sampled were pumpkinseed, rock bass, and bowfin.The number of lake homes increased from 33 in 1967 to 39 in 1996.To help maintain quality fish populations in Hay Lake, lake users should safeguard aquatic habitat by preserving or reestablishing aquatic plants and natural shorelines.  Aquatic and terrestrial plants provide food and cover for fish and wildlife.  They also help protect shorelines from erosion, and absorb nutrients and pollutants.  Natural shorelines, shorelines that have not been altered by man, help protect a lake from silt-laden runoff water.  They also provide excellent places for wildlife to feed, hide, and raise their young.  Protection of the larger watershed that drains into Hay Lake is also needed for maintaining water quality.Anglers can help maintain or improve the quality fishing by practicing catch and release of medium to large-sized fish.  Releasing these fish will help maintain the quality of the fish population and provide anglers with more opportunities to catch more large fish in the future.     </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Hay Lake (DOW# 11-0199; Lake Class 23) is a 364-acre lake located east of Backus, MN. There is a state owned public access on the west shore. Hay Lake has 5.22 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 56 feet. The lake is primarily managed for Largemouth Bass, Black Crappie and Northern Pike and secondarily for Bluegill, and Tullibee (Cisco). The DNR has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different classes based on physical, chemical and other characteristics. Hay Lake is in Lake Class 23; lakes in this class are generally very clear, very deep, have a low percentage of shallow water area, and have very irregularly shaped shoreline with many bays or points.   <br> \n <br> \nHay Lake has a fish community that is dominated by Largemouth Bass and Bluegill. The majority of Largemouth Bass were between 10 to 14 inches, but Bass up to 18 inches were sampled. Bluegills averaged less than 6 inches in the 2014 sample, but a few larger fish were sampled. Northern Pike numbers are down from the last few years, but more fish over 28 inches should be present. Other fish species that anglers can expect to encounter include Black Crappie,  Bowfin (Dogfish), Brown Bullhead, Tullibee (Cisco) Pumpkinseed, Rock Bass, Walleye, Yellow Bullhead, and Yellow Perch. <br> \n <br> \nPeople can have significant impacts on lakes and the fish populations they support. Harvest, lakeshore development, removal of shoreline vegetation, and introductions of invasive species can all adversely affect fish populations. Currently no aquatic invasive species (AIS) have been identified in Hay Lake. AIS are moved from infested to non-infested waters by anglers, boaters, and lake shore owners and can adversely impact lakes and fish populations. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access. If you suspect an infestation of an invasive species in this lake, save a specimen and report it to a local natural resource office. Additional information on all of these topics can be found on the DNR website (www.dnr.state.mn.us) or by contacting the Walker Area Fisheries office. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Hay Lake is a 350-acre lake with 179 littoral acres (less than 15 feet deep), 5.22 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 56 feet.  Hay Lake is located 17 miles south of Longville, MN and 13 miles north east of Backus MN. A DNR owned public access is located on the west shore.  Hay Lake has a small outlet stream that flows into Hand Lake. The DNR has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different classes based on physical, chemical and other characteristics. Hay Lake is in Lake Class 23; lakes in this class are generally deep and very clear lakes. Other area lakes in this class include Jack, Ponto, Stony, and Baby. The lake is primarily managed for Largemouth Bass, Black Crappie, Northern Pike secondarily for Bluegill, Tullibee (Cisco) and Walleye.   <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass are moderately abundant and ranged in length from 8 to 16 inches.  Black Crappie and Bluegill abundance varies between low to moderate with low numbers of both species sampled in 2019. Bluegill ranged in length from 4 to 9 inches with 77 percent of the sample measuring 7 inches or greater in length and Black Crappie up to 10 inches long were present.  Northern Pike are moderately abundant and ranged in length from 9 to 28 inches with most pike measuring less than22 inches in length. Walleye were below the management goal of two fish per gillnet. No fish from recent year classes stocked with mixed ages of fingerlings and adults were sampled, and Walleye may be limited by low availability of Yellow Perch. Walleye ranged in length from 15-21 inches with an average length of 17 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species that anglers can expect to encounter include, Bowfin (Dogfish), Brown Bullhead, Black Bullhead, Yellow Bullhead, Hybrid Sunfish, Tullibee (Cisco), Pumpkinseed and Rock Bass. <br> \n <br> \nPeople can have significant impacts on lakes and the fish populations they support.  Harvest, lakeshore development, removal of shoreline vegetation, and introductions of invasive species can all adversely affect fish populations.  Currently, no aquatic invasive species (AIS) have been identified in Hay Lake.  AIS are moved from infested to non-infested waters by anglers, boaters, and lake shore owners and can adversely impact lakes and fish populations.  To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access.  If you suspect an infestation of an invasive species in this lake, save a specimen and report it to a local natural resource office.  Additional information on all of these topics can be found on the DNR website (www.dnr.state.mn.us) or by contacting the Walker Area Fisheries office. <br> \n</p>",
