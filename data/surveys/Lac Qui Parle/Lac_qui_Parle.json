                "narrative": "<p>CURRENT NET CATCH DATA, WHEN COMPARED TO THE 1986 ASSESSMENT NETTING, INDICATE AN INCREASE IN THE GILLNET CATCH PER SET RATES FOR CAP, QBS, BIB, SHR BRB, AND CCF. A DECREASE OCCURRED FOR WTS, BLB, WHC, YEP AND WAE. NOP, YEB, WHB AND FRD CATCH RATES REMAINED RELATIVELY UNCHANGED. WALLEYE CATCH RATES DECREASED APPROXIMATELY 49% FROM 11.37 FISH WEIGHING 17.49 PDS TO 5.83 FISH WEIGHING 12.0 PDS PER GILLNET SET. DESPITE THIS DECREASE, GILLNET CATCH RATES REMAINED 1.6 TIMES THE STATE AND 2.1 TIMES LOCAL MEDIANS FOR NUMBER PER SET AND 2.3 TIMES THE STATE AND 7.0 TIMES LOCAL MEDIANS FOR PODS PER SET. MEAN LENGTH AT CAPTURE, FOR ALL TYPES OF SAMPLING GEAR, WAS 16.9 INCHES. MEAN INDIVIDUAL FISH WEIGHT WAS 2.2 PDS. OVERALL, THE WALLEYE POPULATION APPEARS HEALTHY AND STABLE. GROWTH RATES ARE FAST WHEN COMPARED STATE WIDE. ALL YEAR CLASSES FROM 1989 THROUGH 1981 WERE REPRESENTED IN THE SAMPLING DATA. THE 1986 YEAR CLASS WERE NATURALLY REPRODUCED FISH. THE 1985 YEAR CLASS REPRESENTED BOTH NATURAL REPRODUCTION AND FRY STOCKING. PREVIOUS INVESTI- GATIONS AND ANNUAL NATURAL REPRODUCTION CHECKS IN- DICATE THAT NATURAL REPRODUCTION IS CONTRIBUTING TO THE WALLEYE FISHERY OF LAC QUI PARLE. YELLOW PERCH CATCH RATES HAVE SHOWN A STEADY DECLINE SINCE THE 1981 ASSESSMENT NETTING. THEY HAVE DROPPED APPROXIMATELY 84%, FROM 24.8 FISH WEIGHING 12.8 PDS PER GILLNET SET IN 1986 TO 4.0 FISH WEIGHING 1.62 PDS PER SET. CATCH RATES ARE NOW BELOW BOTH STATE AND LOCAL MEDIANS FOR NUMBERS AND PDS PER SET. WHILE LOW IN NUMBERS, THE PRESENT POPULATION EXHIBITS A FAST GROWTH RATE. ALL YEAR CLASSES FROM THROUGH WERE REPRESENTED, WITH THE 1988. 1986 AND 1985 HAVING THE STRONGEST REPRESENTATION. MEAN LENGTH AT CAPTURE FOR ALL SAMPLING GEAR WAS 8.4 INCHES, WITH A MEAN INDIVI- DUAL WEIGHT 0.4 PDS. BLACK CRAPPIE CATCH RATES INCREASED SLIGHTLY IN THE GILLNET CATCH BUT DECREASED BY 99% IN THE TRAPNET CATCH, FROM 8.45 FISH WEIGHING 1.50 PDS TO 0.08 FISH WEIGHING 0.02 PDS PER SET. WHEN COMPARED STATE WIDE, CATCH INDICES WERE APPROXIMATELY THE SAME, BUT ONLY HALF THE LOCAL MEDIAN. NATURAL REPRODUCTION CHECKS INDICATE THAT THE BLACK CRAPPIE POPULATION IS RE- PRODUCING SUCCESSFULLY. YEAR CLASS REPRESENTATION WAS IN CONTINUOUS SUCCESSION FROM 0+ THROUGH 4+ YEARS. COMMERCIAL UNDER ICE SEINING OPERATIONS DURING THIS SEASON CONSISTENTLY SAMPLED BLACK CRAPPIE, AND ON ONE HAUL BROUGHT IN OVER 250 FISH. THESE FACTORS INDICATE THAT THE POPULATION IS SELF-SUSTAINING AND MAY BE PRESENT IN LARGER NUMBERS THEN THE ASSESSMENT NETTING EFFECTIVELY SAMPLED. MEAN LENGTH AT CAPTURE FOR ALL SAMPLING GEAR WAS 8.0 INCHES, 0.4 PDS. DATA FROM FALL ELECTROFISHING RUNS, THE 1989 CREEL AND RECREATIONAL USE SURVEY AND LOCAL REPORTS INDICATE THE PRESENCE OF ADULT AND YOY LARGEMOUTH BASS AND BLUEGILL, WHICH WERE ABSENT FROM THE NETTING RESULTS. GROWTH RATES FOR BOTH SPECIES WERE FAST BUT NUMBERS WITHIN THE OVERALL FISHERY APPEAR TO BE LOW. NORTHERN PIKE CATCH RATES REMAINED BASICALLY UNCHANGED, SLIGHTLY BELOW THE STATE MEDIAN AND SLIGHTLY ABOVE THE LOCAL MEDIAN FOR GILLNET CATCH PER SET, NUMBERS AND PDS. MEAN LENGTH AT CAPTURE FOR ALL SAMPLING GEAR WAS 21.7 INCHES. MEAN INDIVIDUALS WEIGHT 2.3 PDS. THE 1986 AND 1985 YEAR CLASSES REPRESENTED 91% OF THE TOTAL NORTHERN PIKE CAUGHT. THESE FISH RANGED IN LENGTH FROM 20.0 TO 23.0 INCHES. NORTHERN PIKE HAVE BEEN STOCKED ANNUALLY FROM 1982 THROUGH 1988 AS BOTH ADULTS AND FINGERLINGS. THE PRESENCE OF TWO FISH IN THE CURRENT GILLNET CATCH ALONG WITH 2 SAMPLED FROM EMILY CREEK STREAM SURVEY PROVIDES EVIDENCE OF NATURAL REPRODUCTION. SHORELINE SEINING DATA RE- VEALED THAT WHB, BLG, BLC, YEP, WAE AND FRD ARE ALL REPRODUCING NATURALLY.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lac qui Parle Lake is a large (5,589 acres) lake in west central Minnesota located in Lac qui Parle, Chippewa, and Swift Counties.  It is an impoundment of the Minnesota River, which is its major inlet and outlet.  The lake is primarily managed for walleye and northern pike, but also provides fishing opportunities for yellow perch, crappie, and channel catfish\n\nWalleye abundance appears to have declined in Lac qui Parle Lake due to a decrease in abundance of fish from the 2003 year-class.  Of all the walleyes aged in 2005, 17% were from the 2003 year-class, whereas only 9% of the walleyes aged in 2006 were from the 2003 year-class.  Although fish numbers appeared to have declined, average size increased from 15 inches and 1.4 lbs. in 2005 to 16.6 inches and 1.6 lbs. in 2006.  Over 31% of the walleyes measured during this survey were 18 inches or greater whereas only 17% of walleyes measured in 2005 were 18 inches or greater.  In the spring of 2006, 3 million walleye fry were stocked into Lac qui Parle Lake.  However, survival was only marginal.  An OTC (oxytetracycline) marking study indicated that 33% of the 2006 year-class was stocked fish.  However, due to migration from other systems, this number may be higher.  To supplement the walleye population, 90 adults, 288 yearlings, and 88,722 fingerlings were stocked into Lac qui Parle in the fall of 2006.  Previous stockings have suggested that walleye fingerling and yearling stockings are more successful than fry stocking.  Future assessments will provide the opportunity to evaluate the success of these stockings.\n\nIn contrast to the walleye abundance, northern pike abundance appears to have increased slightly to be within the normal range for Lac qui Parle.  Pike sampled in 2006 averaged 3.5 lbs. and 24.4 inches long, an increase in size from the 2005 average of 1.9 lbs. and 18.9 inches long.  \n\nWhite bass abundance continues to be high in Lac qui Parle due to the abundance of the 2005 year-class.  Of all the white bass aged, 78% of them were from the 2005 year-class.  White bass averaged 9 inches and 0.3 lb.  \n\nThe abundance of black and white crappies in 2006 increased moderately from 2005.  Black crappie averaged 7.7 inches long and 0.3 lb.  Channel catfish were sampled (8.1 per gill net) at the highest number since 1991 (7 per net).  Catfish up to 26 inches were sampled, but 22% were 7.5-8.5 inches long.  Average size was 13.7 inches and 1.1 lbs.  Other game fish species in low abundance were bluegill, rock bass, and yellow perch.  Freshwater drum continue to be abundant, but not as abundant as in 1995.  Other common non-game fish sampled were black bullhead, common carp, white sucker, and redhorse.\n\nFuture management activities include annual fisheries surveys, winter dissolved oxygen monitoring and ice-house counts, fish stocking, and shoreline fishing access improvements.\n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>     Lac qui Parle Lake (LQP) is located three miles southwest of Milan in western Minnesota.  It is an impoundment of the Minnesota River and its water level is controlled by Churchill Dam.  LQP is a highly productive lake that measures 5,589 acres and has a maximum depth of 15 feet.  Watersheds that ultimately drain into LQP include the Upper Minnesota, Yellow Bank, Lac qui Parle, Pomme de Terre and a portion of the Chippewa.  LQP is operated as a flood control reservoir and some years water levels will fluctuate by more than five feet.  Depending on the timing and extent of the water level fluctuations, fish may experience good or poor natural reproduction.  Some species do well when spring water levels are high, whereas others benefit from lower water levels. <br> \n     LQP has frequently provided good fishing for walleye.  Walleye numbers have been lower than normal since 2006, with the exception of 2011.  This has occurred even though high numbers of walleye fry and fingerlings have been stocked.  Seven walleye were caught per gill net during 2012, which was slightly below LQP's normal range of 8-28.  The walleye were primarily from the 2008, 2009, and 2010 year classes and were 12-22 inches.  Fingerling stocking and natural reproduction have both made substantial contributions to the walleye population based on marking studies.  Natural reproduction has produced the two strongest walleye year classes on record (2001 and 2011), however it has been very inconsistent and the population has been supplemented by stocking when appropriate.  The 2011 walleye have grown slowly and were only eight inches after two summers.  Normal growth would have been 12 inches or larger.  These young walleye have the potential to improve the walleye population during the next couple of years if they can find adequate forage, otherwise they may fail to recruit to the population.  Assessments of walleye growth, condition, and stomach contents have revealed young walleye struggle at times to find adequate forage. <br> \n     Crappie fishing has been good during recent years.  The crappie population increased substantially following the decrease in the walleye population.  High numbers of 2011 year class crappie were caught during sampling and those fish are expected to provide continued good fishing. <br> \n High numbers of freshwater drum and white bass have been present at times.  Although these are important forage species for walleye, they also compete with them for resources.  Anglers are encouraged to harvest drum and white bass.  Both species are good to eat, especially if the small amounts of red meat are trimmed from the fillets.  Excellent recipes for cooking drum can be found by searching the internet for \"drum recipes\". <br> \n     Several additional species were present in numbers worth pursuing.  A moderate bluegill population has developed during recent years and anglers occasionally report good catches of large bluegills from localized areas.  Northern pike were moderately abundant with fish from the 2007-11 year classes present, including fish that exceeded 30 inches.  Channel catfish were abundant with many fish over 20 inches.  Very limited angling for channel catfish has been observed.  Considering their high numbers and large sizes, catfish enthusiasts should consider a trip to Lac qui Parle Lake.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lac qui Parle Lake (LQP) is located three miles southwest of Milan in western Minnesota.  It is an impoundment of the Minnesota River and its water level is controlled by Churchill Dam.  LQP is a highly productive lake that measures 5,589 acres and has a maximum depth of 15 feet.  Watersheds that ultimately drain into LQP include the Upper Minnesota, Yellow Bank, Lac qui Parle, Pomme de Terre and a portion of the Chippewa.  LQP is operated as a flood control reservoir and some years water levels will fluctuate by more than five feet.  Depending on the timing and extent of the water level fluctuations, fish may experience good or poor natural reproduction. <br> \n     <br> \n LQP often provides good Walleye fishing.  Fourteen Walleyes were caught per gill net in 2016, indicating a moderate population.  The Walleyes were primarily from the 2013 and 2014 year classes and were 13-16 inches.  Natural reproduction, downstream migration and fingerling/yearling stockings have contributed to the population.  Walleyes have grown slower than normal during recent years, likely due to low food availability.  Stomach analyses have indicated that young Walleyes have struggled at times to find adequate forage to insure good growth and condition.  LQP experiences extremely high sediment suspension during strong winds, which limits the ability of important food organisms to reproduce and grow.  In addition, the highly fluctuating water levels likely affect the ability of many fish species to successfully spawn.  These factors impact the production of food that is important for successful growth and recruitment of young Walleyes. <br> \n <br> \nCrappie fishing has been very good for many years.  The crappie population has typically been higher when the Walleye population has been lower.  High crappie numbers from a wide range of sizes were present in 2016, with many fish over 11 inches.  Good fishing for crappies is expected to continue. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike were abundant and growing fast with fish sampled up to 38 inches.  Anglers reported good catches of pike during 2016.  Spearers have also reported good success during recent years. <br> \n <br> \nHigh numbers of Freshwater Drum were sampled.  Smaller drum are important food for other game fish, however larger drum compete with them for resources.  Anglers are encouraged to harvest drum.  They are good to eat, especially if the small amounts of red meat are trimmed from the fillets.  Excellent recipes for cooking drum can be found on the internet by searching \"drum recipes\". <br> \n <br> \nChannel Catfish were moderately abundant with many fish over 20 inches.  Very little angling for catfish has been known to occur.  Considering their high numbers and large sizes, catfish enthusiasts should consider a trip to LQP Lake. <br> \n <br> \nManagement activities for LQP Lake include annual fish surveys, forage evaluations, monitoring winter dissolved oxygen concentrations, annual ice-house counts and Walleye stocking.  Zebra mussels were confirmed to be present during 2016.  Anglers are reminded to drain all water from their boat, ballast tanks, bait containers, motor, bilge, livewell and baitwell before leaving the lake.  Keep drain plugs out and water-draining devices open while transporting watercraft. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lac qui Parle Lake is a large, windswept, nutrient rich lake located in west-central Minnesota.  Water level is controlled by a dam near the lake's outlet.  The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers manages the lake for flood control purposes.  Lac qui Parle Lake's watershed measures over 4,000 square miles.  It is comprised primarily of intensively drained agricultural land.  This has been to the detriment of Lac qui Parle Lake.  Today the lake suffers from algal blooms, turbid water, sedimentation, extreme water level fluctuations, and shoreline erosion.  These are the direct result of heavy flows from the watershed that carry large amounts of nutrients and soil.  This hasn't always been the case.  In the 1930s Lac qui Parle Lake was described as clean and clear with an abundance of freshwater clams.  Unless major land use changes are made in the watershed, it is unlikely Lac qui Parle Lake will be anything more than a shallow, silt-laden, cattail marsh in a few hundred years.     In 1996 walleye abundance was well above what is considered normal for similar lakes.  Most of these fish measured from 11-13 and 15-22 inches.  However, some trophy-sized walleye measuring 25 inches or more were also present.  Most of the walleye were from the 1992-1995 year classes.  Fluctuations in walleye abundance have generally corresponded to stockings.  Strong year classes in 1989, 1992, and 1995 corresponded to years when walleye fry were stocked.  A moderately strong 1993 year class corresponded to a year when walleye fingerlings were stocked by the Lac Qui Parle Lake Association, and a moderately strong 1990 year class corresponded to a year when fry and fingerlings were stocked.  However, fall electrofishing in 1990 and 1993 indicated moderately strong walleye year classes were already present from natural reproduction or fry stocking, before fingerlings were stocked.  A mark and recapture experiment found stocked fingerlings only accounted for 12% of the 1993 walleye year class.  The remaining 88% of the year class was the result of natural production.  A moderately strong year class also occurred in 1994, a nonstocked year.  Considering all available data, fry stocking appears to be the largest contributor to the walleye population, however natural reproduction also makes a substantial contribution, especially during high water years.     Northern pike were abundant with many fish measuring from 17-30 inches in 1996.  Strong 1993 and 1994 year classes were present.  Good reproduction occurred those years because high water levels provided suitable spawning and nursery habitat throughout the watershed.     Other species that were present in decent numbers and sizes included yellow perch, white bass, and black crappie.  Bullhead and channel catfish abundances have continued to remain low.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lac qui Parle Lake is a large, windswept, nutrient rich lake located in west-central Minnesota.  Water level is controlled by a dam near the lake's outlet.  The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers manages the lake for flood control purposes.  Lac qui Parle Lake's watershed measures over 4,000 square miles.  It is comprised primarily of intensively drained agricultural land.  This has been to the detriment of Lac qui Parle Lake.  Today the lake suffers from algal blooms, turbid water, sedimentation, extreme water level fluctuations, and shoreline erosion.  These are the direct result of heavy flows from the watershed that carry large amounts of nutrients and soil.  This hasn't always been the case.  Lac qui Parle Lake was described in the 1930s as \"clean and clear with an abundance of freshwater clams\".  Unless major land use changes are made in the watershed, it is unlikely Lac qui Parle Lake will be anything more than a shallow, silt-laden, cattail marsh in a few hundred years.     Walleye abundance in 1997 was well above what is considered normal for similar lakes.  Fish were abundant at all sizes from 10-23 inches.  Most of the walleye were from the 1992-1996 year classes.  Fluctuations in walleye abundance have generally corresponded to stockings.  Strong year classes in 1992 and 1995 corresponded to years of fry stocking.  A strong 1990 year class corresponded to a year of fry and fingerling stocking.  Moderately strong 1993 and 1996 year classes corresponded to years when fingerlings were stocked by the Lac Qui Parle Lake Association.  However, mark and recapture experiments found stocked fingerlings contributed only 12% to the 1993 walleye year class, and 20% to the 1996 year class.  The vast majority of walleye from those year classes were the result of natural reproduction.  A moderately strong walleye year class also occurred in 1994, a nonstocked year.  Considering all available data, fry stocking appears to be the largest contributor to the walleye population, however natural reproduction also makes a substantial contribution, especially during high water years.     Northern pike were abundant in 1997 with the majority of them weighing from 2-6 pounds, however fish weighing over 10 pounds were also present.  Strong 1994-1996 year classes were present.  Northern pike abundance has been high since 1993.  This probably has been the result of good spring spawning conditions. Lac qui Parle Lake's watershed has some good pike spawning and nursery habitat in the form of seasonally flooded wetlands.  Unfortunately, most seasonally flooded wetlands have been drained.  The long term sustainability of the northern pike population depends on the protection and restoration of these wetland habitats.     Other species that were present in 1997 in decent numbers and sizes included yellow perch, white bass, and black crappie.  Bullhead numbers remained low, however an increase in channel catfish abundance occurred.  Catfish apparently migrated into Lac qui Parle Lake during the high spring water levels in 1997 from the Minnesota River downstream.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lac qui Parle Lake is a large (5,589 acres) class 41 lake in west central Minnesota located in Lac qui Parle, Chippewa, and Swift Counties.  It is an impoundment of the Minnesota River, which is its major inlet and outlet.  The lake is primarily managed for walleye and northern pike, but also provides fishing opportunities for yellow perch, crappie, and channel catfish.   <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance appears to have declined for a second year in Lac qui Parle Lake.  Walleye gill net catch per unit effort (CPUE) was 29.3 per net in 2005, 13.8 per net in 2006, and was only 6.2 per net during this survey.   This catch rate is the lowest observation since 1989 and is well below the average range for Lac qui Parle Lake.  Walleye averaged 16.5 inches long and 1.7 lbs.  Three-year-old fish were the most abundant, with average growth.  <br> \n <br> \nThe decreased catch rate of walleye appears to be due to loss of fish from the 2001 year class coupled with inconsistent year classes.  Based on walleye that have been aged from gill nets, the 2001 year class made up 37% of the sample in 2005 and 31% of the sample in 2006.  During this survey, however, only 19% of the walleye were from the 2001 year class.  The catch rate of young-of-year (YOY) walleye in 2001 was an unprecedented 1,012 YOY walleye per hour electrofishing.  Since 2001, the number of YOY walleye per hour of electrofishing averaged only 12 per hour.  This lack of YOY walleye has prompted the stocking of fingerling, yearling, and adult walleye into Lac qui Parle from 2004-2006.  These stockings have likely kept the walleye population from declining further in Lac qui Parle.   <br> \n <br> \nWalleye fry were stocked into Lac qui Parle in 2007.  Prior to stocking, the fry were marked with oxytetracycline (OTC).  Fall electrofishing for YOY walleye conducted during this survey resulted in 68 YOY walleye per hour, the highest catch rate since 2001.  Evaluation of the OTC marks indicated that only 7.4% of the YOY walleye were stocked fish.  To supplement the walleye population, 2,251 yearlings and 582 adults were stocked into Lac qui Parle in the spring and fall of 2007.  Walleye frylings are planned to be stocked into Lac qui Parle in 2008.  If the fryling stocking is unsuccessful and forage is abundant, walleye fingerlings will be stocked in the fall of 2008.  Future assessments will allow for continued evaluation of the success of these stocked fish.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike gill net CPUE (5.1) was similar to 2006 (4.8).  This catch rate is within the interquartile range for Lac qui Parle (3.4-8 per net) but is still below the historic average catch of 5.9 per net.  Pike sampled in 2007 averaged  3.8 lbs. and 25.6 inches long, similar to the average size in 2006 of 3.5 lbs. and 24.4 inches long.  Pike from six year classes were sampled, but the 2005 year class (two years old) were the most abundant.  Growth was fast compared to the Lac qui Parle average. <br> \n <br> \nWhite bass abundance in gill nets was lower than previous years.  Gill nets sampled 13.4 white bass per net during this survey compared to 30.1 per net in 2006.  Despite the decline, the 2007 catch rate was much higher than the upper quartile (5 per net) for Lac qui Parle.  Average size was 10.3 inches and 0.5 lb.  All white bass were less than three-years-old with the 2005 year class being the most abundant.  Growth was slightly below average for Lac qui Parle. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie CPUE in gill nets increased to a record high 16.8 per net in 2007.  This increase is primarily due to an abundant 2005 year class.  This year class made up 84% of the black crappie sampled.  Black crappie average size increased from 7.7 inches long and 0.3 lb. in 2006 to 8.4 inches and 0.4 lb. in 2007.  Growth was below average until age 2, after which growth was above average.  Anglers should expect good fishing for black crappie during the next few years.  <br> \n <br> \nGill net CPUE of channel catfish declined from the record high 8.1 per gill net in 2006 to 5.9 per net in 2007.    <br> \nThis catch rate is close to the upper quartile (6.4 per net) established for Lac qui Parle Lake.  Catfish up to 29 inches long were sampled, but 55% were 15 inches or less.   <br> \n <br> \nOther game fish species sampled in low abundance were bluegill, rock bass, white crappie, and yellow perch.  Freshwater drum were sampled (55.3 per net) at record levels in 2007.  Drum were small, with 90% being ten inches or less.  Other common non-game fish sampled were black bullhead, common carp, white sucker, and redhorse. <br> \n <br> \nFuture management activities planned for Lac qui Parle include monitoring of winter dissolved oxygen levels and fishing pressure, fish stocking as needed, fall population assessments and electrofishing for YOY walleye, and sampling for viral hemorrhagic septicemia (VHS).    <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lac qui Parle Lake is located in western Minnesota three miles southwest of Milan.  The lake is an impoundment on the Minnesota River and water levels are controlled by the Churchill Dam at its outlet.  The lake measures 5,589 acres with a maximum depth of 15 feet and is highly productive. <br> \n      <br> \nLac qui Parle has historically had a high quality walleye population with high numbers of fish from a wide range of sizes.  Recently, the walleye population has been at a lower level.  This has occurred even though a more aggressive walleye stocking strategy has been occurring during recent years.  The 2009 walleye population primarily consisted of fish from the 2006-09 year classes, however some older fish measuring up to 28 inches were present.  Walleye growth rates were poor for Lac qui Parle Lake.  Walleye population characteristics and stocking success will continue to be evaluated with annual fish assessments.  Natural reproduction has contributed substantially to the walleye population at times, and it produced the strongest year class ever recorded (2001). <br> \n      <br> \nGood fishing for black crappie and white bass has occurred during recent years.  Populations of both species have been high and anglers have reported high catches.  A moderate bluegill population has developed during recent years and anglers occasionally report catching large bluegills from localized areas.  Northern pike were moderately abundant with fish from the 2004-08 year classes present, including a fair number of fish that exceeded 30 inches.  Channel catfish were very numerous with many fish in excess of 20 inches.  Very limited angling for them has been observed.  Considering their high numbers and large sizes, catfish enthusiasts should consider a trip to Lac qui Parle Lake. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lac qui Parle lake is a large, nutrient rich reservoir located in west-central Minnesota.  The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers manages the lake for flood control purposes.  The lake currently suffers from severe algae blooms, high turbidity, sedimentation, and extreme water level fluctuations.  Fluctuating water levels have led to increased shoreline erosion.  Recent projects complete by the MN DNR has stabilized severely eroded areas at Hanthos Beach and Clay Banks.       In spite of its serious water quality problems, Lac qui Parle Lake is one of Minnesota's premier walleye lakes, and walleye were moderately abundant in 2001.  Although most walleye measured less than 12 inches, a good number of 15-20 inch fish were also sampled.  Fall electrofishing indicated an extremely abundant 2001 year class was present with over 1000 young-of-year walleye caught per electrofishing hour.  Approximately 2.7 million walleye fry were stocked into Lac qui Parle Lake in 2001.  Prior to stocking, walleye fry were marked using oxytetracycline (OTC).  According to OTC mark evaluation, natural reproduction accounted for the entire 2001 year class.  Previous OTC evaluations revealed that fry stocking accounted for 32 percent of a weak 1999 year class and 65 percent of a weak 2000 year class.  Walleye fingerlings were stocked in 2000 to bolster the weak 2000 year class.  Fall gill netting indicated this stocking contributed substantially.       A 15 inch minimum walleye length limit was implemented on Lac qui Parle in 1996 as part of a statewide experimental regulations study.  Its objectives are to increase the average length of walleye harvested, and to increase the number of larger walleye in the lake.  Although preliminary evaluation has indicated the obectives of the regulation may not be realized, it will continue to be evaluated through early 2003.  At that time, a recomendation to keep, change or abolish the regulation will be made.     A moderate population of northern pike was sampled.  Strong northern pike year classes correlate to years with high spring water levels.  Such was the case in 2001, and many young-of-year pike were sampled.  Good numbers of 22-28 inch fish were also sampled.  Several northern pike over 30 inches were measured during the 2001 creel survey.     Channel catfish abundance has increased each year since 1995.  The 2001 catch of 7 per gill net was the highest recorded on Lac qui Parle Lake.  Although limited reproduction has occurred, many of the catfish present likely migrated into the lake during the flood of 1997 and 2001.     Crappie were present in moderate abundance.  The majority were of a quality size, measuring 11-13 inches.       Low to moderate numbers of white bass and yellow perch were present in 2001.  Most white bass measured 12-13 inches and most perch 5-7 inches.      Fisheries management activities scheduled for Lac qui Parle Lake include annual fish population assessments, evaluation of the 15 inch minimum size regulation, annual monitoring of winter dissolved oxygen concentrations and fishing pressure, stocking as needed, and work within the watershed to help improve the water quality of the lake and its associated streams.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lac qui Parle is a 5,589 acre lake located west of Milan in west-central Minnesota.  The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers manages the lake for flood control purposes.  Fisheries management is primarily for walleye and northern pike with secondary emphasis on channel catfish, crappie and yellow perch.     A 15 inch minimum size regulation for walleye was implemented in 1996.  The objectives of this regulation are to increase the average length of walleye harvested, and to increase the number of larger walleye in the lake.  Although preliminary indications are that the objectives may not be realized, evaluation will continue through early 2004.  At that time, a recommendation to keep, change or abolish the regulation will be made.     Test nets revealed an abundant walleye population in 2002.  Most walleye measured less than 15 inches, although a fair number of 16-20 inch fish were also sampled.  Growth of smaller walleye was slightly slower than normal for Lac qui Parle Lake due to increased competion for limited forage.  If slow growth persists, walleye may take considerably longer than expected to obtain the 15 inch minimum size limit.  Future assessments will continue to monitor growth patterns.     Approximately 3 million walleye fry are stocked into Lac qui Parle Lake in two of three years.  Walleye fry were not stocked in 2002.  Fall electrofishing indicated a weak, naturally reproduced 2002 year class was present.  While electrofishing, high numbers of yearling walleye (2001 year class) were observed.  Walleye fry stocked in 2001 were marked with oxytetracycline (OTC).  Evaluations of young walleye indicated that natural reproduction accounted for the entire 2001 year class.  Other available data, including OTC evaluation in 1999 and 2000, suggests that natural reproduction has been primarily responsible for the present walleye population in Lac qui Parle Lake, however fry and fingerling stocking has also contributed.     Northern pike were moderately abundant in 2002.  Most pike sampled belonged to the 2001 year class and measured 13-22 inches, although individuals up to 31 inches were also sampled.  Northern pike were growing normally, which should allow for most of the 2001 year class to measure 22-26 inches by late summmer, 2003.     The channel catfish population has increased substantially since 1996.  Many catfish sampled likely migrated into Lac qui Parle Lake from the Minnesota River during flood conditions in 1997 and 2001.  Catfish measured from 7-28 inches with the majority from 13-17 inches.  Only limited natural reproduction of channel catfish has been documented in Lac qui Parle Lake.  The ability for natural reproduction to sustain high numbers of catfish will be evaluated in future assessments.     Crappie were moderately abundant.  Although individuals up to 14 inches were sampled, most measured less than 8 inches.  Crappie growth was fast and anglers should expect a fair number of 9-11 inch fish by late summer, 2003.          White bass and yellow perch were sampled in low abundance.  White bass measured 9-11 inches and most perch 7-9 inches.       Other fish species sampled included low abundance of black and brown bullhead, bigmouth buffalo, carp, golden and shorthead redhorse, and quillback, and moderately abundant freshwater drum and white sucker.  Abundant young-of-year fresh water drum were observed during electrofishing.         Fisheries management activities scheduled for 2003 include stocking 3 million walleye fry, oxytetracycline marking evaluation of walleye fry, a fish population assessment, evaluation of the 15 inch minimum size regulation, monitoring of winter dissolved oxygen and fishing pressure, and work within the watershed to help improve the water quality of the lake and associated stream.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>     Lac qui Parle Lake (LQP) is located in western Minnesota three miles southwest of Milan.  The lake is an impoundment on the Minnesota River and Churchill Dam at its outlet is used to control water levels.  LQP is a highly productive lake that measures 5,589 acres and has a maximum depth of 15 feet.  The water level at LQP was 4-7 feet above normal from April-August of 2011 due to heavy runoff from its watershed.  The flooded riparian areas provided excellent fish habitat which resulted in good natural reproduction by numerous game and forage fish species. <br> \n     Lac qui Parle Lake has typically provided an abundant walleye population with fish present from a wide range of sizes.  However, walleye numbers were low from 2007-09, even though high numbers of walleye fry and fingerlings had been stocked.  Recently the population has rebounded to a moderate level with 16 walleye caught per gill net in 2011.  The majority of the walleye were from the 2008, 2009, and 2010 year classes and they measured 12-20 inches.  Fingerling stocking and natural reproduction have both made substantial contributions to the present walleye population.  Excellent spawning conditions in 2011 resulted in a very strong natural 2011 walleye year class.  These young walleye will substantially improve the overall walleye population during the next couple of years if sufficient forage is present to provide good growth.  Natural reproduction has produced the two strongest year classes recorded at Lac qui Parle Lake (2001 and 2011).  However, it has been inconsistent and the walleye population will continue to be supplemented as needed by stocking.   <br> \n     Crappie fishing has been very good during recent years, especially during winter.  The crappie population increased substantially during the period of lower walleye abundance.  During the winter of 2011-12 anglers were reporting good fishing for crappie measuring 10-15 inches, and also reported releasing numerous smaller fish.  Crappie also experienced good reproduction on 2011 and numerous young-of-year crappie were noted during sampling. <br> \n High numbers of freshwater drum and white bass are often present.  Although these are important forage species for walleye, they also compete for resources.  Anglers are encouraged to harvest adult drum and white bass to reduce competition with walleye.  Both species have a delicate white flesh and provide excellent table fair.  Their flavor can be improved further by trimming the reddish \"mud line\" meat from the fillets when cleaning.  Excellent drum recipes can be located on the internet by searching \"drum recipes\". <br> \n     A moderate bluegill population has developed during recent years and anglers occasionally report catching large bluegills from localized areas.  Northern pike were moderately abundant with fish from the 2006-11 year classes present, including fish that exceeded 30 inches.  Channel catfish were numerous with fish exceeding 20 inches.  Very limited angling for channel catfish has been observed.  Considering their high numbers and large sizes, catfish enthusiasts should consider a trip to Lac qui Parle Lake.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lac qui Parle Lake (LQP) is located three miles southwest of Milan in western Minnesota.  It is an impoundment of the Minnesota River and water level is controlled by Churchill Dam.  LQP is a highly productive lake that measures 5,589 acres and has a maximum depth of 15 feet.  Watersheds that drain into LQP include the Upper Minnesota, Yellow Bank, Lac qui Parle, Pomme de Terre and a portion of the Chippewa.  LQP is operated as a flood control reservoir and some years water levels will fluctuate by more than five feet.  Depending on the timing and extent of the water level fluctuations, fish may experience from good to poor natural reproduction.  This survey was conducted to collect routine fish population data using gill nets, shoreline seining and fall night electrofishing.  These data can be compared to historical standard and targeted survey data from Lac qui Parle Lake. <br> \n <br> \nLQP often provides good Walleye fishing.  The Walleye population has resulted from natural reproduction, stocking and migration of Walleyes from upstream water bodies.  Fifteen Walleyes were caught per gill net in 2018, indicating a moderate population.  Walleyes were present from a wide range of sizes with the largest measuring 28 inches.  The 2016 and 2017 year classes accounted for majority of the sample and they averaged 16 and 13 inches, respectively.  Walleyes have grown slower than expected at times, especially young Walleyes, likely due to limited food.  LQP becomes extremely turbid during strong winds due to sediment suspension.  This limits the ability of important food organisms to reproduce and grow, especially beneficial algae, zooplankton and small fish.  In addition, the highly fluctuating water levels likely affect the ability of many fish species to successfully spawn.  These factors impact the production of food items that are important for successful growth and recruitment of Walleyes. <br> \n <br> \nCrappie fishing has been good to very good for many years.  The crappie population has typically been higher when the Walleye population has been lower.  Crappies were moderately abundant during 2018.  Many were 11-13 inches and several strong year classes of smaller crappies should keep the population healthy into the future. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike were moderately abundant and sizes were from 13 to 36 inches with many in the 20 to 23 inch range.  Anglers and spearers have reported some good catches of pike during recent years.  Pike have shown relatively consistent natural reproduction regardless of spring water levels.  It's likely they have been finding suitable spawning habitat along the north end of the lake where beaver dams have created wetlands.  Beginning May 2018, new regulations for Northern Pike are in effect.  Lac qui Parle is in the southern management zone meaning anglers/spearers are allowed to possess 2 pike that have a minimum size of 24 inches.  See the regulations booklet for more details.   <br> \n <br> \nHigh numbers of Freshwater Drum were caught.  Small drum are important food for other game fish, however large drum compete with them for resources.  Anglers are encouraged to harvest drum.  They are good to eat, especially if the small amounts of red meat are trimmed from the fillets.  Excellent recipes for cooking drum can be found on the internet by searching \"drum recipes\". <br> \n <br> \nChannel Catfish were abundant with many fish in the 13 to 18 inch range.  Very little angling for catfish has been known to occur.  Considering their high numbers and large sizes (some over 30 inches), catfish enthusiasts should consider a trip to LQP. <br> \n <br> \nManagement activities for LQP include annual fish surveys, stocking, monitoring winter dissolved oxygen and ice-house counts.  Zebra mussels were found to be present in 2016.  Anglers are reminded to drain all water from boats, motors, compartments and containers before leaving the lake, and to keep drain plugs out and water-draining devices open while transporting watercraft. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lac qui Parle (LQP) Lake is located three miles southwest of Milan in western Minnesota.  It is a 5,589-acre impoundment of the Minnesota River with a maximum depth of 15 feet.  LQP Lake's water level is controlled by Churchill Dam, which is located one-half mile downstream on the Minnesota River.  Watersheds that drain into LQP Lake include the Upper Minnesota, Yellow Bank, Lac qui Parle, Pomme de Terre and a portion of the Chippewa. <br> \n <br> \nLQP Lake is managed as a flood control reservoir and some years water levels will fluctuate by more than five feet.  LQP Lake frequently becomes extremely turbid during strong winds due to sediment suspension.  The lake can also experience dense blooms of blue-green algae.  These factors all negatively impact the food web and desirable fish species.  Even though challenging habitat conditions have been common at LQP Lake, game fish species continue to maintain decent populations. <br> \n <br> \nThis 2021 Targeted Survey was conducted to collect routine fish population data using gill nets, shoreline seining and fall night electrofishing.  These data can be compared to historical Standard and Targeted survey data from LQP Lake. <br> \n <br> \nLQP Lake has frequently provided good Walleye fishing.  The Walleye population has resulted from stocking, natural reproduction and migration from upstream water bodies.  Although the 2021 gill net catch was lower than in recent assessments, there were still good numbers of 12 to 15-inch Walleye present; with some larger fish as well.  Good numbers of young Walleyes were also present in 2021 and should contribute to the fishery within a year or two.     <br> \n <br> \nCrappie fishing has been very good for many years.  The crappie population has typically been higher when the Walleye population has been lower.  Crappies were moderately abundant in the 2021 survey and many were 10-12 inches with some fish over 13 inches.  Smaller crappies were also present which should keep the population healthy into the future. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike abundance was lower than previous surveys, but their average size was large.  Mean length was 27 inches and they ranged from 17 to 35 inches.  Anglers and spearers have reported good pike fishing during recent years.  Pike have experienced relatively consistent natural reproduction regardless of spring water levels.  They have likely been finding suitable spawning habitat in wetlands adjacent to the lake created by beaver dams, or along the edges of emergent vegetation.  LQP Lake is in the southern Northern Pike management zone and the possession limit is two fish with a minimum size limit of 24 inches.  See the Minnesota Fishing Regulations for more details. <br> \n  <br> \nHigh numbers of Freshwater Drum were present.  Small drum are an important food for many species of fish, however large drum compete with game fish for resources.  Anglers are encouraged to harvest drum.  They are good to eat, especially if the small amounts of red meat are trimmed from the fillets. Drum are an excellent choice for a fish fry because there is no possession limit. <br> \n <br> \nChannel Catfish were abundant from a wide range of sizes.  Very little angling for catfish has been known to occur.  Considering their high numbers and large sizes, catfish enthusiasts should consider a trip to LQP Lake. <br> \n <br> \nFuture management activities for LQP Lake include annual fish surveys, Walleye stocking and winter dissolved oxygen monitoring.  Zebra mussels exist in the lake.  Please remember to drain all water from boats, motors, compartments, and containers before leaving the lake, and to keep drain plugs out while transporting watercraft. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lac qui Parle (LQP) Lake is located three miles southwest of Milan in western Minnesota.  It is a 5,589 acre impoundment of the Minnesota River with a maximum depth of 15 feet.  LQP Lake's water level is controlled by Churchill Dam, which is located one-half mile downstream on the Minnesota River.  Watersheds that drain into LQP Lake include the Upper Minnesota, Yellow Bank, Lac qui Parle, Pomme de Terre and a portion of the Chippewa. <br> \n <br> \nLQP Lake is managed as a flood control reservoir and some years water levels will fluctuate by more than five feet.  LQP Lake can become extremely turbid during strong winds due to sediment suspension.  The lake can also experience dense blooms of blue-green algae.  These factors all negatively impact the food web and desirable fish species.  Even though challenging habitat conditions have been common at LQP Lake, several game fish species continue to maintain decent populations. <br> \n <br> \nThis 2023 Targeted Survey was conducted to collect routine fish population data using gill nets, shoreline seining and fall night electrofishing.  This data can be compared to historical Standard and Targeted Survey data from LQP Lake. <br> \n <br> \nLQP Lake has frequently provided good walleye fishing.  The walleye population has resulted from stocking, natural reproduction, and migration from upstream water bodies.  Walleye numbers in 2023 were moderate and similar to recent years.  Walleye were present from a wide range of sizes, with those from 13-15 inches most abundant.  Decent numbers of young walleyes were also found in 2023 which should contribute to the fishery within a year or two.  However, this depends on whether adequate forage is present to provide good survival and growth.   <br> \n <br> \nCrappie fishing has been very good for many years.  The crappie population has typically been higher when the walleye population has been lower.  Crappies were moderately abundant, with the 2023 catch similar to that from the 2022 survey.  Many crappies were 10-12 inches and good numbers of smaller fish were also present which should help maintain the population into the future. <br> \n <br> \nLow numbers of northern pike were present, but some fish were over 40 inches.   Anglers and spearers have reported good pike fishing during recent years.  Pike have experienced relatively consistent natural reproduction regardless of spring water levels.  They probably find suitable spawning habitat in wetlands adjacent to the lake created by beaver dams, or along the edges of emergent vegetation in bay areas.  LQP Lake is in the southern northern pike management zone and the possession limit is two pike with a minimum size limit of 24 inches.  See the Minnesota Fishing Regulations for more details. <br> \n  <br> \nHigh numbers of freshwater drum were present.  Small drum are an important food for many species of fish, however large drum compete with game fish for resources.  Anglers are encouraged to harvest drum.  They are good to eat, especially if the small amounts of red meat are trimmed from the fillets. Drum are an excellent choice for a fish fry since they can be easy to catch in high numbers. <br> \n <br> \nChannel catfish were abundant from a wide range of sizes.  Very little angling for catfish has been known to occur.  Considering their high numbers and large sizes, catfish enthusiasts should consider a trip to LQP Lake. <br> \n <br> \nFuture management activities for LQP Lake include annual fish surveys, walleye stocking and winter dissolved oxygen monitoring.  Zebra mussels exist in the lake.  Please remember to drain all water from boats, motors, compartments, and containers before leaving the lake, and to keep drain plugs out while transporting watercraft. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Although walleye abundance in Lac qui Parle Lake has fluctuated, it has generally increased through the late 1980's and early 1990's, and been considerably above normal compared to other similar lakes.  A strong 1992 year class corresponds to a year when walleye fry were stocked.  Another strong year class from 1993 corresponds to a year when walleye fingerlings were stocked.  However, studies showed that naturally reproduced walleye fingerlings were already fairly abundant in the lake.  The stocked fingerlings made up only 12% of the total number in the lake that fall while the other 88% came from natural reproduction.  Those two consecutive strong year classes resulted in a particularly high abundance of walleye, and a lot of fish in the 12 to 17 inch size range.     Northern pike abundance increased in 1994, due mainly to a very strong 1993 year class.  That year class was a result of high water levels which flooded vegetation around the lake and in wetlands within the watershed, providing good spawning habitat for northerns.  Suitable water levels in tributary streams allowed the pike to reach those spawning areas.  Because of the large '93 year class, most of the northerns ranged from 17 to 23 inches, but several larger were collected, up to 37 inches long.     Abundance of yellow perch increased above the normal range for similar lakes.  Almost 55% of the perch were larger than 8 inches.  Crappie abundance has typically been in the low end of the normal range.  More consistent year class strength in recent years indicates more regular natural reproduction, but numbers will probably remain somewhat low.  White bass evidently had a good year for natural reproduction in 1994, with a strong year class and higher abundance that year.  Most of the white bass were 5-6 inches long, but individuals up to 16 inches were observed.</p>",

THIS YEAR'S ASSESSMENT MAY MORE VALIDLY BE COMPARED TO 1991 THAN PREVIOUS ASSESSMENTS WHICH WERE CONDUCTED IN SUMMER. TWENTY SPECIES OF FISH WERE SAMPLED IN THIS ASSESSMENT.  LMB WAS THE ONLY SPECIES SAMPLED IN 1991 THAT WASN'T SAMPLED IN 1992.  CATCH RATES OF ALL SPECIES IN 1992 WERE LOWER THAN IN 1991. THESE DECREASES CAN BE PARTIALLY ATTRIBUTED TO COLLECTION OF NUMEROUS YOY OF MOST SPECIES IN 1991 AND A LACK OF YOY IN 1992.  YOY IN 1992 WERE SMALLER THAN IN 1991 AND DID NOT APPEAR TO BE FULLY RECRUITED TO THE GILL NETS.  NOP CATCH PER GILL NET DECREASED FORM 7.0 FISH IN 1991 TO 3.3 IN 1992.  THE PRESENT CATCH RATE IS STILL WELL WITHIN THE NORMAL RANGE FOR LAKES WITH SIMILAR PHYSICAL AND CHEMICAL CHARACTERISTICS.  MEAN LENGTH AND WEIGHT OF FISH SAMPLED INCREASED SLIGHTLY FROM 23.3 INCHES AND 3.5 POUNDS IN 1991 TO 25.0 INCHES AND 3.6 POUNDS IN 1992.  AGE CLASSES 1+ THROUGH 4+ WERE ALL PRESENT.  ALL AGE CLASSES EXHIBITED FAST GROWTH RELATIVE TO STATE GAME FISH GROWTH RATE TABLES.  AGE 1+ THROUGH 3+ NOP REPRESENTED 98% OF THE TOTAL CATCH.  THESE FISH WERE FROM NATURAL REPRODUCTION.  NO YOY WERE SAMPLED, BUT YOY PIKE HAVE BEEN SAMPLED IN PAST ASSESSMENTS. IN 1991, THE STRONGEST YEAR CLASS WAS FROM 1989. THIS YEAR CLASS ALSO MADE UP A MAJOR PORTION OF THE 1992 SAMPLE (45%).  THE 1990 YEAR CLASS REPRESENTS ANOTHER 50%.  NOP WERE LAST STOCKED IN 1988.  CCF  CATCH PER GILL NET DECREASED FROM 0.7 FISH IN 1991 TO 0.3 IN 1992.  MEAN SIZES DECREASED FROM 21.0 INCHES AND 3.9 POUNDS IN 1991 TO 17.7 INCHES AND 2.1 POUNDS IN 1992.  THIS IS DECEPTIVE AS THE SAMPLE SIZE WAS SMALL (ONLY F FISH).  NO YOY WERE SAMPLED IN 1992, BUT THEY HAVE BEEN SAMPLED IN PAST ASSESSMENTS.  CATFISH WERE LAST STOCKED IN 1983 AND HAVE BEEN SAMPLED IN EVERY ASSESSMENT SINCE 1986.  ENOUGH NATURAL REPRODUCTION SEEMS TO BE OCCURRING TO MAINTAIN THE POPULATION AT A LOW LEVEL.  WHB CATCH PER GILL NET DECREASED FROM 10.1 FISH IN 1991 TO 1.3 IN 1992.  THIS CATCH RATE IS WITHIN THE NORMAL RANGE FOR SIMILAR LAKES AND IS COMPARABLE TO CATCH RATES OBTAINED FROM 1981 TO 1989.  THE CATCH FROM 1991 WAS HIGH BECAUSE A LARGE NUMBER OF YOY WERE CAUGHT, 97% OF THE TOTAL CATCH.  ONLY ONE YOY FISH WAS CAUGHT IN 1992.  MEAN SIZES OF WHB INCREASED FROM 7.1 INCHES AND 0.2 POUNDS IN 1991 TO 10.7 INCHES AND 0.7 POUNDS IN 1992.  AGE CLASSES 0+ THROUGH 3+ WERE PRESENT IN 1992, WITH AGE 1+ FISH COMPRISING 80% OF THE SAMPLE.  THIS YEAR CLASS REPRESENTED 97% OF THE WHB SAMPLED IN 1991.  ONLY TWO RKB WERE COLLECTED IN 1992 COMPARED TO THREE IN 1991.  THESE TWO ASSESSMENTS ARE THE ONLY NETTINGS IN WHICH RKB HAVE BEEN SAMPLED.  ONLY ONE BLG WAS SAMPLED IN 1992.   BLG ARE BETTER SAMPLED WITH TRAP NETS OR ELECTROFISHING.  WHC CATCH PER GILL NET DECREASED FROM 15.0 FISH IN 1991 TO 2.5 IN 1992.  THE 1992 CATCH RATE IS WITHIN THE NORMAL RANGE FOR SIMILAR LAKES.  PART OF THE REDUCTION IN CATCH RATES WAS DUE TO THE LACK OF YOY CRAPPIES.  NO YOY WERE SAMPLED THIS YEAR, BUT YOY MADE UP 99% OF THE 1991 SAMPLE.  AGE 1+ AND 5+ CRAPPIES WERE PRESENT. AGE 1+ FISH COMPRISED 97% OF THE TOTAL CATCH. THESE WERE THE YOY FISH THAT DOMINATED THE CATCH IN 1991.  MEAN SIZE OIF WHC INCREASED FROM 4.8 INCHES AND 0.1 POUNDS IN 1991 TO 7.9 INCHES AND 0.3 POUNDS IN 1992.  BLC CATCH PER GILL NET ALSO DECREASED FROM 15.6 FISH IN 1991 TO 3.3 IN 1992. THE 1992 CATCH RATE IS WITHIN THE NORMAL RANGE FOR LAKES WITH SIMILAR CHARACTERISTICS.  LIKE THE WHC, THE DECREASE IN BLC CATCH RATES WAS PARTLY DUE TO THE LACK OF YOY.  NO YOY WERE CAUGHT IN 1992, BUT 80% OF THE 1991 SAMPLE WAS YOY.  THREE AGE CLASSES OF BLC WERE REPRESENTED IN THE CATCH, 1+ THROUGH 3+.  THE STRONGEST AGE CLASS WAS 1+, COMPRISING 92% OF THE TOTAL CATCH.  THESE FISH REPRESENTED THE STRONGEST AGE CLASS IN 1991 ALSO WHEN THEY WERE YOY AND CONSTITUTED 80% OF THE CRAPPIE CATCH.  ALL AGE CLASSES EXHIBITED FAST GROWTH.  MEAN SIZES OF FISH SAMPLED INCREASED FROM 5.0 INCHES AND 0.1 POUNDS IN 1991 TO 7.2 INCHES AND 0.2 POUNDS IN 1992.  YEP CATCH PER GILL NET DECREASED FROM 21.9 FISH IN 1991 TO 11.9 IN 1992. THE 1992 CATCH RATE IS WITHIN THE NORMAL RANGE FOR LAKES WITH SIMILAR CHARACTERISTICS.  MEAN SIZES OF FISH DECLINED SLIGHTLY FROM 8.9 INCHES AND 0.4 POUNDS IN 1991 TO 8.1 INCHES AND 0.3 POUNDS IN 1992.  FIVE AGE CLASSES WERE PRESENT, 1+ THROUGH 5+.  ALL AGE CLASSES EXHIBITED FAST GROWTH.  THE STRONGEST AGE CLASS WAS 1+, COMPRISING 69% OF THE TOTAL CATCH.  AGE 1+ AND  2+ FISH WERE THE STRONGEST AGE CLASSES IN 1991, CONSTITUTING 93% OF THE CATCH.  THESE FISH, NOW AGE 2+ AND 3+, REPRESENTED 29% OF THE 1992 SAMPLE.  NO YOY WERE SAMPLED IN 1992, BUT THEY HAVE BEEN SAMPLED IN PAST ASSESSMENTS.  WAE CATCH PER GILL NET DECREASED FROM 30.6 FISH IN 1991 TO 10.1 IN 1992.  THE 1992 CATCH RATE IS SLIGHTLY ABOVE THE HIGH END OF THE NORMAL RANGE FOR LAKES WITH SIMILAR CHARACTERISTICS.  MEAN SIZES OF FISH INCREASED FROM 12.7 INCHES AND 0.9 POUNDS TO 16.0 INCHES AND 1.6 POUNDS IN 1992.  THIS SIZE INCREASE WAS APPARENTLY DUE TO A LACK OF YOY FISH IN THE 1992 GILL NET SAMPLE.  EIGHT AGE CLASSES WERE PRESENT IN THE 1992 SAMPLE, YOY THROUGH 3+, 5+, 7+,8+ AND 10+.  AGE CLASSES 1+ THROUGH 3+ EXHIBITED FAST GROWTH.  ALL OTHER AGE CLASSES DISPLAYED AVERAGE GROWTH.  MISSING AGE CLASSES CORRESPONDED WITH NON-STOCKED YEARS EXCEPT FOR AGE 9+ FISH WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN FROM 1983, A YEAR OF FRY STOCKING.  IN GILL NETS, THE TWO STRONGEST AGE CLASSES, 2+ AND 3+, WERE BOTH FROM STOCKED YEARS (1990 AND 1989).  THESE TWO AGE CLASSES COMPRISED 70% OF THE GILL NET SAMPLE.  ONLY SIX YOY WAE WERE CAUGHT IN GILL NETS.  OVER 1300 YOY WAE SAMPLED BY ELECTROFISHING, BUT MOST YOY WAE RANGED FROM 5 TO 7 INCHES LONG AND WERE TOO SMALL TO BE ADEQUATELY SAMPLED BY GILL NETS.  SOME NATURAL REPRODUCTION SEEMS TO OCCUR REGULARLY. PRIOR TO 1990, WAE FRY WERE STOCKED IN ODD NUMBERED YEARS.  STARTING IN 1990 A REVISED STOCKING SCHEDULE WAS INSTITUTED IN WHICH STOCKING WOULD BE ON A THREE YEAR ROTATION OF FINGERLINGS, NO STOCKING AND FRY.  THIS STOCKING SCHEDULE IS CURRENTLY BEING EVALUATED BY ANNUAL FALL GILLNETTING AND ELECTROFISHING TO DETERMINE WAE ABUNDANCE AND THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF NATURAL REPRODUCTION, FRY STOCKING AND FINGERLING STOCKING TO THE WAE POPULATION.  A TOTAL OF 1335 WAE, 1307 YOY AND 28 1+ OR OLDER, WERE SAMPLED IN 6.0 HOURS OF ELECTROFISHING (222.5 FISH/HR).  THE CATCH RATE OF YOY WAS 217.8 FISH/HR AND THEY COMPRISED 98% OF THE TOTAL CATCH.  THESE FISH WERE FROM NATURAL REPRODUCTION AND/OR 3 MILLION STOCKED FRY.  IN 1990, A YEAR WHEN 1.4 MILLION FRY WERE STOCKED THE CATCH RATE OF YOY WAS 106.0 FISH/ HR. AND THEY COMPRISED 83% OF THE TOTAL CATCH. THE CATCH RATE OF YOY FOR 1991, A NON-STOCKED YEAR, WAS 14.5 FISH/HR AND THEY COMPRISED 69% OF THE TOTAL CATCH.  AVERAGE LENGTHS OF YOY FISH IN 1992. AND 1990, THE FRY STOCKED YEARS, WERE 5.92 AND 5.91 INCHES, RESPECTIVELY.  IN THE NON-STOCKED YEAR OF 1991, THE AVERAGE LENGTH OF YOY FISH WAS 8 .35 INCHES.  AVERAGE CONDITION FACTOR (K) OF YOY WAE IN 1992 AND 1990 WERE 0.77 AND 0.79, RESPECTIVELY.  AVERAGE 5 OF YOY WAE IN 1991 WAS 0.88.  ALTHOUGH THESE DATA ARE LIMITED, IT APPEARS THAT YOY WAE EXPERIENCE BETTER GROWTH AND FITNESS DURING NON-STOCKED YEARS.  CARP ARE A MAJOR COMPONENT OF THE COMMERCIA FISHERY IN LAC QUI PARLE.  AN AVERAGE OF 183,010 POUNDS PER YEAR HAVE BEEN REMOVED OVER THE LAST THREE WINTER SEASONS. THE COMMERCIAL HARVEST OF CARP DECREASED OVER THIS THREE YEAR PERIOD FROM 302,000 POUNDS IN 1989-90 TO 600 POUNDS IN 1991-92.  EFFORT DECREASED FROM 17 SEINE HAULS IN 1989-90 TO 5 HAULS IN 1991-92.  IN ADDITION TO DECREASED EFFORT, THE LACK OF SCHOOLING OF CARP MAY HAVE EFFECTED THE CATCH.  THERE HAD BEEN COMPLAINTS BY COMMERCIAL FISHERMEN ON AREA LAKES THAT THE FISH WERE SCATTERED AND THEREFORE MORE DIFFECULT TO CATCH.  CATCH PER GILL NET DECREASED FROM 5.9 FISH IN 1991 TO 1.7 IN 1992.  THE 1992 CATCH RATE IS WITHIN THE NORMAL RANGE FOR LAKES WITH SIMILAR CHARACTERISTICS.  MEAN LENGTH OF SAMPLED CARP INCREASED FROM 8.8 INCHES IN 1991 TO 19.0 IN 1992. BIB ARE ANOTHER COMPONENT OF THE COMMERCIAL FISHERY.  AN AVERAGE OF 184,518 POUNDS PER YEAR HAVE BEEN REMOVED OVER THE LAST THREE WINTER SEASONS.  THE COMMERCIAL HARVEST OF BIB DECREASED OVER THIS THREE YEAR PERIOD FROM 384,000 POUNDS IN 1989-90 TO 5,100 POUNDS IN 1991-92.  LACK OF EFFORT AND SCATTERED FISH ARE POSSIBLE REASONS FOR THIS DECLINE.  THE CATCH RATE DECREASED FROM 4.4 FISH PER GILL NET IN 1991 TO 0.1 IN 1992.  THE 1992 CATCH RATE IS SIGNIFICANTLY LESS THAN THE LOW END OF THE NORMAL RANGE FOR LAKES WITH SIMILAR CHARACTERISTICS.  BLB ARE ALSO PART OF THE COMMERCIAL FISHERY.  THEIR CATCH RATE DECREASED FROM 14.9 FISH PER GILL NET IN 1991 TO 1.6 IN 1992.  THE 1992 CATCH RATE IS SIGNIFICANTLY LESS THAN THE LOW END OF THE NORMAL RANGE FOR LAKES WITH SIMILAR CHARACTERISTICS.  MEAN FISH SIZE WERE SIMILAR TO 1991 IN 1992 AND WERE 9.1 INCHES AND 0.5 POUNDS.  FRD ARE ALSO SOUGHT BY COMMERCIAL FISHERMEN.  AN AVERAGE OF 51,099 POUNDS PER YEAR HAVE BEEN REMOVED OVER THE LAST THREE YEARS.  THE DRUM CATCH RATE DECREASED FROM 31.4 FISH PER GILL NET IN 1991 TO 7.7 IN 1992.  THE 1992 CATCH RATE IS WITHIN THE NORMAL RANGE FOR LAKES WITH SIMILAR CHARACTERISTICS.  MEAN LENGTH OF DRUM INCREASED FROM 7.1 INCHES IN 1991 TO 9.4 IN 1992.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Although walleye abundance in Lac qui Parle Lake has fluctuated from year to year, it has generally increased through the late 1980s and early 1990s, and been above normal compared to similar lakes.  Walleye from a strong 1990 year class were still common in the 1993 survey and ranged in length from 16 to 20 inches.  A very strong 1992 year class made up over 75% of the walleye sampled and they ranged from 10 to 14 inches long.  Those fish are from year when walleye fry were stocked.  Northern pike have also generally increased in abundance during the early 1990s.  Pike abundance in 1993 was higher than any previous survey.  Over 82% of the northern pike sampled were young of the year, ranging from 9 to 14 inches.  That extremely large 1993 year class was a result of high water levels and northern pike being able to find suitable wetland spawning habitat after a droughty period in the late 1980s.  The remaining northern pike ranged up to 36 inches in length.  With the increasing populations of predators, yellow perch abundance has declined somewhat since the early 1980s. Perch numbers are still within the normal range for similar lakes.  Over 47% of the perch sampled were larger than 8 inches and almost 15% were larger than 10 inches.  With the exception of a strong 1991 year class, black crappie abundance has typically been low probably due to poor reproduction.  Crappies from the 1991 year class were 8 to 10 inches long.  White bass numbers have also been somewhat low except for a strong year class in 1991.  Although most of the white bass in the sample were from the 1991 year class and ranged from 13 to 14 inches, fish over 16 inches were observed.</p>",

A strong 1992 year class corresponds to a year when walleye fry were stocked.  Another strong year class from 1993 corresponds to a year when walleye fingerlings were stocked.  However, studies showed that naturally reproduced walleye fingerlings were already fairly abundant in the lake.  The stocked fingerlings made up only 12% of the total number in the lake that fall while the other 88% came from natural reproduction.  Those two consecutive strong year classes resulted in a high abundance of walleye, and a lot of fish in the 15 to 20 inch size range.     Northern pike abundance is also quite high, due mainly to a strong 1993 year class.  That year class is the result of high water levels which flooded vegetation around the lake and in wetlands within the watershed, providing good spawning habitat for northerns.  Suitable water levels in tributary streams allowed the pike to reach those spawning areas.  Most of the northerns are ranging from 20 to 28 inches.     Abundance of yellow perch is near the high end of the normal range for similar lakes.  Over 56% of the perch were larger than 8 inches.  Crappie abundance has typically been in the low end of the normal range.  Occasional high numbers of young of the year crappies have not seemed to recruit, or increase population size.  White bass abundance was about normal for similar lakes.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lac qui Parle is a 5,589 acre lake located in west-central Minnesota that is managed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers as a flood control impoundment.  The Department of Natural Resourses manages the lake primarily for walleye and northern pike.     A 15 inch walleye minimum size regulation was implemented on Lac qui Parle Lake in 1996.  Evaluation of this regulation concluded it was not effective in increasing the number of walleye 15 inches or larger.  It was also concluded that the regulation was potentially detrimental as it could result in an over-abundance of smaller walleye.  Too many small walleye could cause slow growth and increased death rates due to competition for limited forage.  It was the recommendation of the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources to abolish the 15 inch minimum size regulation and to implement a 4 walleye daily limit, in which one could be 20 inches or larger.  Public input during meetings held in 2004 was favorable and the new regulation will be put into effect on May 14, 2005.     Net catches indicated walleye were moderately abundant in 2004.  Over 80 percent of the sampled walleye were from the 2001 year class and measured less than the 15 inch minimum.  Growth of these walleye has been considerably slower than normal for Lac qui Parle Lake.  The mean length of the 2001 year class was 14 inches.  With normal growth, these fish should have measured closer to 18 inches.  This year class will be subject to angler harvest when the minimum size regulation is abolished in 2005.  The effects that harvest has on growth will be evaluated in future assessments.      Approximately three million walleye fry were stocked into Lac qui Parle Lake in 2004.  Prior to stocking, fry were marked with oxytetracycline (OTC).  Evaluation of young-of-year walleye sampled during fall night electrofishing revealed that fry stocking accounted for 76 percent of a weak to moderate 2004 year class.  Management plans for Lac qui Parle Lake call for a supplemental fingerling stocking when assessments indicate consecutive weak or missing year classes and the electofishing catch is 50 or less young-of-year walleye per hour.  Adequate forage should also exist.  These criteria were met in 2004 and 95,549 fingerling, 5,041 yearling, and 17 adult walleye were stocked.  Approximately 15,000 additional walleye yearling will be stocked in the spring of 2005.  The contribution of these stockings will be monitored in future assessments.     Northern pike were sampled in their lowest abundance since 1989.  Sampled pike were age three or older and measured 20-36 inches.  Poor northern pike spawning conditions caused by low spring run-off have occurred over the past three years and have resulted in weak or missing 2002-2004 year classes.  Normal or above normal spring run-off will be necessary to increase pike abundance.     The channel catfish population has increased considerably since 1998.  Migration of catfish into Lac qui Parle from the Minnesota River during flood conditions in 1997 and 2001 caused the catfish population to increase.  However, recent assessments have indicated that natural reproduction in the lake has been sufficient to maintain the higher population.  Catfish sampled in 2004 ranged from 6-30 inches, with most 13-16 inches.     Black crappie were moderately abundant in 2004.  Most sampled crappie were quality sized, measuring over 10 inches.  A fair number of young-of-year black crappie were also sampled.  Anglers frequently target crappie on Lac qui Parle and have historically enjoyed good success, particularily during the winter and early spring.     Bluegill, white bass, and yellow perch were all sampled in low abundance in 2004.  Bluegill measured 7 and 8 inches.  A low number of large bluegill were also observed during fall electrofishing.  White bass ranged from 4-14 inches.  High numbers of young-of-year white bass were also sampled.  Yellow perch measured 9-10 inches.     Good numbers of freshwater drum (sheephead) measuring 12-15 inches were sampled.  Anglers are targeting sheephead, particularily in this size range, more frequently as a food fish.  Typically only the meat above the rib cage is used and care is given to remove excess red tissue near the skin.  High numbers of young-of-year drum were also sampled.  Young-of-year drum (YFRD) are a valuable forage for northern pike and walleye.  A 2003 stomach content analysis of walleye found that YFRD comprised over 40 percent of consumed forage.  Similar analysis on other lakes found YFRD comprised over 60 percent of consumed forage.  Increased abundance of YFRD may improve growth and condition of walleye in Lac qui Parle Lake.     Management activities scheduled for Lac qui Parle Lake in 2005 include stocking yearling walleye, monitoring of winter dissolved oxygen and fishing pressure, and a fish assessment.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>     Lac qui Parle Lake is located in western Minnesota three miles southwest of Milan.  The lake is an impoundment on the Minnesota River and water levels are controlled by the Churchill Dam at its outlet.  Lac qui Parle is a highly productive lake that measures 5,589 acres and has a maximum depth of 15 feet. <br> \n     Historically, Lac qui Parle Lake has often displayed a quality walleye population with high numbers of fish from a wide range of sizes.  Natural reproduction has contributed substantially to the walleye population at times, and it produced the strongest year class ever recorded (2001).  Recently, walleye numbers and sizes have been at a lower level.  This has occurred even though an aggressive walleye stocking program has been underway.  The 2010 walleye population consisted primarily of fish from the 2007-2010 year classes, with lower numbers of larger, older fish also present.  Ten walleye were caught per gill net, up from a low of 4 per net observed in 2009.  Walleye growth has been slow during recent years, and the availability of suitable forage likely plays a limiting role in development of the population.  Walleye population characteristics and stocking success will continue to be evaluated with annual fish assessments. <br> \n     High numbers of freshwater drum and white bass often occur.  Although these are important forage species for walleye, they also compete for resources.  Anglers are encouraged to harvest adult drum and white bass to reduce competition between them and walleye.  Both species are quite palatable, especially if the small amounts of red meat are trimmed from the fillets. <br> \n     Good fishing for black crappie and white bass has occurred during recent years.  Populations of both species have been high and anglers have reported good catches.  A moderate bluegill population has developed during recent years and anglers occasionally report catching large bluegills from localized areas.  Northern pike were moderately abundant with fish from the 2004-10 year classes present, including fish that exceeded 30 inches.  Channel catfish were numerous with fish exceeding 20 inches.  Very limited angling for channel catfish has been observed.  Considering their high numbers and large sizes, catfish enthusiasts should consider a trip to Lac qui Parle Lake.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lac qui Parle Lake (LQP) is a large, shallow nutrient rich reservoir located in west-central Minnesota.  The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers manages the lake for flood control purposes.  Lac qui Parle Lake suffers from severe algae blooms, high turbidity, sedimentation, shoreline erosion, and extreme water level fluctuations.  These are the result of high flows which contain excessive nutrients and sediments entering from the watershed.      In spite of its serious water quality problems, LQP Lake is one of Minnesota's premier walleye lakes.  Walleye were moderately abundant in 2000 with most fish measuring 15-17 inches long.  According to their ages, these fish had grown slowly and should have measured 16-22 inches.  The slow growth was probably due to a decline in forage fish the past few years.  Fall electrofishing the past two years revealed an increase in forage abundance which should lead to increased growth rates.     A 15 inches minimum walleye length limit was implemented on LQP in 1996 as part of a statewide experimental regulations study.  Its objectives are to increase the average length of walleye harvested by anglers, and to increase the number of larger walleye in the lake.  The regulation will be evaluated through 2002, and depending upon its effectiveness it will remain in effect, be changed, or removed.     Natural reproduction can produce large numbers of walleye during springs with suitable spawning conditions.  However, walleye stocking is an important management tool for LQP Lake.  Fry are routinely stocked two of three years.  Fingerlings have also been stocked when annual assessments revealed a need.  Available data have shown that fry and fingerling stocking, under suitable conditions, can contribute substantially to the walleye population.  Approximately four million walleye fry were stocked into LQP Lake in 2000.  Fall electrofishing revealed a low number of young walleye were present.  Due to consecutive weak year classes, walleye fingerlings were also stocked in 2000.  Future assessments will evaluate the success of the fingerling stocking.     A moderate population of northern pike that measured 17-34 inches in length was present in 2000.  Pike numbers have declined considerably since the mid-1990's, probably due to poor spawning conditions due to low water levels.  Increased water levels will enhance pike spawning habitat and will likely increase their numbers.     Crappie were present in moderate abundance.  The majority were of a quality size, measuring 10-13 inches in length.  Several anglers reported good crappie fishing during the spring of 2000.     The channel catfish gill net catch has increased each year since 1995.  The 2000 catch of four per net was the highest recorded in LQP Lake.  Catfish ranged from 6-28 inches, suggesting limited natural reproduction is occurring.  Numerous catfish have been caught the past couple of years just upstream from LQP Lake at the Marsh Lake spillway.     Low numbers of white bass and yellow perch were present in 2000.  Most white bass measured 10-16 inches, and most yellow perch measured 10-11 inches.     Future management activities will include annual assessments, stocking as needed, and work within the watershed to help improve the water quality of the lake and its associated streams.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lac qui Parle is a 5,589 acre lake located in west-central Minnesota that is managed for flood control purposes by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.  The Department of Natural Resourses Section of Fisheries manages the lake primarily for walleye and northern pike with secondary emphasis on channel catfish, crappie and yellow perch.     A 15 inch minimum size regulation for walleye was implemented in 1996.  The objectives of this regulation are to increase the average length of walleye harvested, and to increase the number of larger walleye in the lake.  Although preliminary indictations are that the objectives may not be realized, evaluation will continue through early 2004.  At that time, a recommendation to keep, change or abolish the regulation will be made.     Walleye were moderately abundant in 2003.  Although walleye up to 23.5 inches were sampled, the vast majority measured less than the 15 inch minimum size regulation.  A creel survey conducted during the 2003 open water season estimated over 55,000 walleye were caught, however, only 3,300 of these fish were harvested.  Slow growth has been well documented for these small walleye, and it continued in 2003.  Slow growth has been attributed to increased competition for a limited forage base.  Considering slow growth, most walleye will continue to measure less than 15 inches throughout the 2004 open water season.  A forage investigation indicated an apparent increase in forage abundance during the summer of 2003.  The response of walleye growth to this apparent forage increase will be further monitored in 2004.       Approximately 3 million walleye were stocked into Lac qui Parle Lake in 2003.  Prior to stocking, fry were marked using oxytetracycline (OTC).  Evaluation of young walleye sampled during fall night electrofishing revealed that fry stocking accounted for 74% of a weak 2003 year class.  Available data, including OTC evaluations in 1999, 2000, and 2001 indicates that natural reproduction has been primarily responsible for maintaining the Lac qui Parle walleye population, although fry and fingerling stocking have also contributed.  The survival an contribution of the 2003 year class will be monitored in future assessments.     Northern pike were moderately abundant in 2003.  Most pike sampled were quality sized, measuring over 21 inches.  Trophy pike up to 36 inches were also sampled.  Northern pike growth was fast, and anglers can expect a fair number of 24-28 inch pike during the 2004 fishing season.  Recent year classes of northern pike appeared weak.  The past three winters and springs have been drier than normal and have resulted in poor northern pike production.  A northern pike rearing area enhancement project was completed on adjacent wetlands to Lac qui Parle Lake in 2003.  This project should allow for increased reproduction of northern pike, especially with normal or above normal spring runoff.     The channel catfish population has increased considerably since 1996.  Many catfish sampled likely migrated into Lac qui Parle from the Minnesota River during flood conditions in 1997 and 2001.  Catfish ranged from 7-29 inches, with the majority measuring 13-17 inches.  Only limited natural reproduction has been documented in Lac qui Parle Lake and the ability for the catfish population to sustain itself at current levels will be monitored in future assessments.     Black and white crappie were sampled in low abundance in test nets.  However, numberous crappie were observed during spring electrofishing.  Most crappie were quality sized, measuring around 9 inches.  Anglers have recently reported modest success for crappie in Lac qui Parle Lake.  The 2003 creel survey estimated approximately 1,100 crappie were harvested during 2003/2004 open water and ice fishing seasons.     White bass and yellow perch were sampled in low abundance.  White bass mostly measured around 12 inches and yellow perch 8-9 inches.       Freshwater drum (sheephead) were sampled in moderate abundance in test nets.  However, abundant young-of-year were sampled during electrofishing and seining.  Young-of-year drum are an important forage for walleye.  Stomach content analysis of walleye found that freshwater drum comprised 42 percent of consumed forage.     Lac qui Parle Lake fisheries management activities scheduled for 2004 include stocking 3 million fry, OTC evaluation of fry stocking, evaluation of the 15 inch minimum size regulation, monitoring of winter dissolved oxygen and fishing pressure, a fish population assessment, and work within the watershed to improve the water quality of the lake and associated streams.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lac qui Parle Lake (LQP) is located three miles southwest of Milan in western Minnesota.  It is an impoundment of the Minnesota River and its water level is controlled by Churchill Dam.  LQP is a highly productive lake that measures 5,589 acres and has a maximum depth of 15 feet.  Watersheds that ultimately drain into LQP include the Upper Minnesota, Yellow Bank, Lac qui Parle, Pomme de Terre and a portion of the Chippewa.  LQP is operated as a flood control reservoir and some years water levels will fluctuate by more than five feet.  Depending on the timing and extent of the water level fluctuations, fish may experience good or poor natural reproduction.  Some species do well when spring water levels are high, whereas others benefit from lower water levels. <br> \n <br> \nLQP has frequently provided good fishing for walleye.  However, during recent years walleye numbers have been lower and fishing for them has been slower than preferred.  This has occurred even though numerous walleye have been stocked, and very good natural reproduction occurred during 2011.  Stomach analyses have indicated that young walleye have struggled to find adequate food to insure good growth and condition.  LQP Lake suffers from extremely high sediment suspension during strong winds, which limits the ability of numerous important food organisms to reproduce and grow.  In addition, the highly fluctuating water levels likely affect the ability of many fish species to successfully spawn.  These factors combine to substantially impact the availability of food that is important for successful growth and recruitment of young walleye. <br> \n <br> \nTen walleye were caught per gill net during 2014, a low to moderate number for the lake.  The walleye were primarily from the 2011 and 2013 year classes and were 10-18 inches.  Natural reproduction, downstream migration, and fingerling/yearling stockings have all made substantial contributions to the walleye population.  Walleye less than 15 inches have grown slower than normal during recent years, likely due to low food availability.   <br> \n <br> \nCrappie fishing has been very good in recent years.  The crappie population increased substantially when the walleye population decreased.  High crappie numbers from a wide range of sizes were present during 2014.  Continued good fishing for crappie is expected to occur. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike were abundant, including some large fish around 35 inches.  Most of them were around 20 inches and from the 2013 year class.  These pike had experienced good growth and will likely provide some good fishing during 2015.      <br> \n <br> \nHigh numbers of freshwater drum were present.  Small drum are important food for other game fish, however they also compete with them for resources.  Anglers are encouraged to harvest drum.  They are good to eat, especially if the small amounts of red meat are trimmed from the fillets.  Excellent recipes for cooking drum can be found on the internet by searching \"drum recipes\". <br> \n <br> \nChannel catfish were moderately abundant with many fish over 20 inches.  Very limited angling for catfish has been observed.  Considering their high numbers and large sizes, catfish enthusiasts should consider a trip to LQP Lake. <br> \n <br> \nManagement activities for LQP Lake include stocking walleye as appropriate, annual population assessments, continued forage evaluations, monitoring winter dissolved oxygen concentrations, and annual ice-house counts. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lac qui Parle Lake (LQP) is located three miles southwest of Milan in western Minnesota.  It is an impoundment of the Minnesota River and its water level is controlled by Churchill Dam.  LQP is a highly productive lake that measures 5,589 acres and has a maximum depth of 15 feet.  Watersheds that ultimately drain into LQP include the Upper Minnesota, Yellow Bank, Lac qui Parle, Pomme de Terre and a portion of the Chippewa.  LQP is operated as a flood control reservoir and some years water levels will fluctuate by more than five feet.  Depending on the timing and extent of the water level fluctuations, fish may experience good or poor natural reproduction. <br> \n <br> \nLQP has frequently provided good fishing for Walleyes.  However, during recent years Walleye numbers have been lower and fishing for them has been slower than preferred.  This has occurred even though numerous Walleyes have been stocked, and very good natural reproduction occurred during 2011.  Stomach analyses have indicated that young Walleyes have struggled to find adequate food to insure good growth and condition.  LQP suffers from extremely high sediment suspension during strong winds, which limits the ability of important food organisms to reproduce and grow.  In addition, the highly fluctuating water levels likely affect the ability of many fish species to successfully spawn.  These factors combine to substantially impact the availability of food that is important for successful growth and recruitment of young Walleyes. <br> \n <br> \nFourteen Walleyes were caught per gill net in 2015, a moderate number for the lake.  The Walleyes were primarily from the 2011, 2013, and 2014 year classes and were 11-19 inches.  Natural reproduction, downstream migration, and fingerling/yearling stockings have all made substantial contributions to the Walleye population.  Walleyes less than 15 inches have grown slower than normal during recent years, likely due to low food availability.   <br> \n <br> \nCrappie fishing has been very good in recent years.  The crappie population increased substantially when the Walleye population decreased.  High crappie numbers from a wide range of sizes were present during 2015.  Continued good fishing for crappies is expected to occur. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike were abundant and growing fast with fish sampled up to 35 inches.  Anglers reported good catches of pike during 2015. <br> \n <br> \nHigh numbers of Freshwater Drum were sampled.  Small drum are important food for other game fish, however they also compete with them for resources.  Anglers are encouraged to harvest drum.  They are good to eat, especially if the small amounts of red meat are trimmed from the fillets.  Excellent recipes for cooking drum can be found on the internet by searching \"drum recipes\". <br> \n <br> \nChannel Catfish were moderately abundant with many fish over 20 inches.  Very limited angling for catfish has been observed.  Considering their high numbers and large sizes, catfish enthusiasts should consider a trip to LQP Lake. <br> \n <br> \nManagement activities for LQP Lake include stocking Walleyes as appropriate, annual population assessments, continued forage evaluations, monitoring winter dissolved oxygen concentrations, and annual ice-house counts. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lac qui Parle Lake (LQP) is located three miles southwest of Milan in western Minnesota.  It is an impoundment of the Minnesota River and water level is controlled by Churchill Dam.  LQP is a highly productive lake that measures 5,589 acres and has a maximum depth of 15 feet.  Watersheds that drain into LQP include the Upper Minnesota, Yellow Bank, Lac qui Parle, Pomme de Terre and a portion of the Chippewa.  LQP is operated as a flood control reservoir and some years water levels will fluctuate by more than five feet.  Depending on the timing and extent of the water level fluctuations, fish may experience good or poor natural reproduction.  This targeted survey was conducted to collect routine fish population data using gill nets, shoreline seining and fall night electrofishing.  These data can be compared to historical standard and targeted survey data from Lac qui Parle Lake. <br> \n <br> \nLQP often provides good Walleye fishing.  Nine Walleyes were caught per gill net in 2017, indicating a moderate population.  Walleyes were present from a wide range of sizes, with fish 14-19 inches most abundant.  Natural reproduction, downstream migrations and fingerling/yearling stockings have contributed to the population.  Walleyes have grown slower than normal during recent years, likely due to limited food.  Stomach analyses have indicated that young Walleyes have struggled at times to find adequate food to insure good growth and condition.  When strong winds blow LQP becomes extremely turbid due to sediment suspension.  This limits the ability of important food organisms to reproduce and grow, especially beneficial algae, zooplankton and small fish.  In addition, the highly fluctuating water levels likely affect the ability of many fish species to successfully spawn.  These factors impact the production of food items that are important for successful growth and recruitment of young Walleyes. <br> \n <br> \nCrappie fishing has been good to very good for many years.  The crappie population has typically been higher when the Walleye population has been lower.  Crappies were moderately abundant during 2017.  A wide range of sizes were present with many fish over 11 inches. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike were moderately abundant from a wide range of sizes, with the largest measuring 38 inches.  Anglers and spearers have reported some good catches of pike during recent years.  Pike have shown decent natural reproduction during recent years although spring water levels have often been low.  It's likely they are accessing impounded spring areas along the northern portion of the lake where beaver activity has provided some suitable spawning habitat. <br> \n <br> \nHigh numbers of Freshwater Drum were sampled.  Small drum are important food for other game fish, however large drum compete with them for resources.  Anglers are encouraged to harvest drum.  They are good to eat, especially if the small amounts of red meat are trimmed from the fillets.  Excellent recipes for cooking drum can be found on the internet by searching \"drum recipes\". <br> \n <br> \nChannel Catfish were abundant with many fish in the 14 to 17 inch range.  Very little angling for catfish has been known to occur.  Considering their high numbers and large sizes (up to 30 inches), catfish enthusiasts should consider a trip to LQP Lake. <br> \n <br> \nManagement activities for LQP Lake include annual fish surveys, forage evaluations, monitoring winter dissolved oxygen, annual ice-house counts and Walleye stocking.  The presence of Zebra mussels was confirmed in 2016.  Anglers are reminded to drain all water from their boat, ballast tanks, bait containers, motor, bilge, livewell and baitwell before leaving the lake.  Keep drain plugs out and water-draining devices open while transporting watercraft. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lac qui Parle (LQP) Lake is located three miles southwest of Milan in western Minnesota.  It is a 5,589 acre impoundment of the Minnesota River with a maximum depth of 15 feet.  LQP Lake's water level is controlled by Churchill Dam, which is located one-half mile downstream on the Minnesota River.  Watersheds that drain into LQP Lake include the Upper Minnesota, Yellow Bank, Lac qui Parle, Pomme de Terre and a portion of the Chippewa. <br> \n <br> \nLQP Lake is managed as a flood control reservoir and some years water levels will fluctuate by more than five feet.  LQP Lake frequently becomes extremely turbid during strong winds due to sediment suspension.  The lake can also experience dense blooms of blue-green algae.  These factors all negatively impact the food web and desirable fish species in LQP Lake.  However, even though \"challenging\" habitat conditions have been common at LQP Lake, game fish species continue to maintain decent populations. <br> \n <br> \nThis 2020 Targeted Survey was conducted to collect routine fish population data using gill nets, shoreline seining and fall night electrofishing.  These data can be compared to historical Standard and Targeted survey data from LQP Lake. <br> \n <br> \nLQP Lake has frequently provided good Walleye fishing.  The Walleye population has resulted from stocking, natural reproduction and migration from upstream water bodies.  Walleye gill net catches have been similar for several years.  Twelve Walleyes were caught per gill net in 2020, indicating a moderate population.  Walleyes were well represented from a wide range of sizes, indicating a relatively balanced population.  Eight year classes were caught.  Walleyes were most common from the 2017 (26%) and 2018 (34%) year classes.  Smaller Walleyes have often experienced slow growth, likely due to limited food. <br> \n <br> \nCrappie fishing has been very good for many years.  The crappie population has typically been higher when the Walleye population has been lower.  Crappies were moderately abundant in the 2020 survey and many were 9-11 inches with some fish over 13 inches.  Smaller crappies were also present which should keep the population healthy into the future. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike were moderately abundant and they were 16-38 inches, averaging 25 inches.  Anglers and spearers have reported good pike fishing during recent years.  Pike have experienced relatively consistent natural reproduction regardless of spring water levels.  They have likely been finding suitable spawning habitat in wetlands adjacent to lake created by beaver dams, or along the edges of emergent vegetation.  LQP Lake is in the southern Northern Pike management zone and the possession limit is two fish with a minimum size limit of 24 inches.  See the Minnesota Fishing Regulations booklet for more details. <br> \n <br> \nHigh numbers of Freshwater Drum were present.  Small drum are important food for many species of fish, however large drum compete with game fish for resources.  Anglers are encouraged to harvest drum.  They are good to eat, especially if the small amounts of red meat are trimmed from the fillets. Drum are an excellent choice for a fish fry because there is no possession limit. <br> \n <br> \nChannel Catfish were abundant from a wide range of sizes.  Very little angling for catfish has been known to occur.  Considering their high numbers and large sizes, catfish enthusiasts should consider a trip to LQP Lake. <br> \n <br> \nFuture management activities for LQP Lake include annual fish surveys, Walleye stocking and winter dissolved oxygen monitoring.  Zebra mussels exist in the lake.  Please remember to drain all water from boats, motors, compartments and containers before leaving the lake, and to keep drain plugs out while transporting watercraft. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lac qui Parle (LQP) Lake is located three miles southwest of Milan in western Minnesota.  It is a 5,589-acre impoundment of the Minnesota River with a maximum depth of 15 feet.  LQP Lake's water level is controlled by Churchill Dam, which is located one-half mile downstream on the Minnesota River.  Watersheds that drain into LQP Lake include the Upper Minnesota, Yellow Bank, Lac qui Parle, Pomme de Terre and a portion of the Chippewa. <br> \n <br> \nLQP Lake is managed as a flood control reservoir and some years water levels will fluctuate by more than five feet.  LQP Lake can become extremely turbid during strong winds due to sediment suspension.  The lake can also experience dense blooms of blue-green algae.  These factors all negatively impact the food web and desirable fish species.  Even though challenging habitat conditions have been common at LQP Lake, several game fish species continue to maintain decent populations. <br> \n <br> \nThis 2022 Targeted Survey was conducted to collect routine fish population data using gill nets, shoreline seining and fall night electrofishing.  These data can be compared to historical Standard and Targeted survey data from LQP Lake. <br> \n <br> \nLQP Lake has frequently provided good Walleye fishing.  The Walleye population has resulted from stocking, natural reproduction, and migration from upstream water bodies.  The 2022 gill net catch was lower than recent assessments, but there were still good numbers of 12-17 inch Walleyes, and some larger fish as well.  Decent numbers of young Walleyes were also present in 2022 and should contribute to the fishery within a year or two.  Although young Walleyes can often be abundant, sometimes they do not recruit well to the fishery, likely due to a lack of suitable forage.   <br> \n <br> \nCrappie fishing has been very good for many years.  The crappie population has typically been higher when the Walleye population has been lower.  Crappies were moderately abundant in the 2022 survey.  Most crappies were 11-12 inches, with some over 13 inches.  Smaller crappies were also present which should help maintain the population into the future. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike were moderately abundant, with some fish up to 36 inches caught.  Anglers and spearers have reported good pike fishing during recent years.  Pike have experienced relatively consistent natural reproduction regardless of spring water levels.  They have likely been finding suitable spawning habitat in wetlands adjacent to the lake created by beaver dams, or along the edges of emergent vegetation.  LQP Lake is in the southern Northern Pike management zone and the possession limit is two fish with a minimum size limit of 24 inches.  See the Minnesota Fishing Regulations for more details. <br> \n  <br> \nHigh numbers of Freshwater Drum were present.  Small drum are an important food for many species of fish, however large drum compete with game fish for resources.  Anglers are encouraged to harvest drum.  They are good to eat, especially if the small amounts of red meat are trimmed from the fillets. Drum are an excellent choice for a fish fry because there is no possession limit. <br> \n <br> \nChannel Catfish were abundant from a wide range of sizes.  Very little angling for catfish has been known to occur.  Considering their high numbers and large sizes, catfish enthusiasts should consider a trip to LQP Lake. <br> \n <br> \nFuture management activities for LQP Lake include annual fish surveys, Walleye stocking and winter dissolved oxygen monitoring.  Zebra mussels exist in the lake.  Please remember to drain all water from boats, motors, compartments, and containers before leaving the lake, and to keep drain plugs out while transporting watercraft. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>IN 1991 ANNUAL FALL SAMPLING (SEPT) WAS INITIATED ON LAC QUI PARLE IN AN ATTEMPT TO BETTER QUANTIFY THE FISHERY.  PREVIOUS SURVEYS FOR THE MOST PART WERE CONDUCTED IN MID TO LATE JULY.  THEREFORE, THE DIFFERENCE IN SAMPLING PERIODS MUST BE KEPT IN MIND WHEN COMPARING THE PRESENT ASSESSMENT WITH PREVIOUS ASSESSMENTS.  THE PRESENT ASSESSMENT MAY MORE VALIDILY BE COMPARED TO CATCH STATISTICS IN FUTURE FALL SAMPLINGS.  TWENTY ONE SPECIES OF FISH WERE SAMPLED IN THIS ASSESSMENT.  CATCH PER EFFORT INCREASED SINCE 1989 FOR ALL SPECIES EXCEPT FOR QUILLBACK AND SHR WHICH DECREASED AND CCF WHICH STAYED THE SAME.  THIS OVERALL INCREASE IN CATCH RATES CAN PROBABLY BE PARTLY ATTRIBUTED TO THE FALL SAMPLING PERIOD WHICH ENABLED MORE YOUNG OF YEAR FISH TO BE SAMPLED.  THESE SMALL FISH MAY NOT HAVE BEEN READILY SAMPLED EARLIER IN THE SUMMER. SLR, RKB,BLG AND LMB WERE SAMPLED FOR THE FIRST TIME IN GILL NETS IN THIS ASSESSMENT.  NOP CATCH RATES INCREASED APPROXIMATELY FOUR TIMES FROM 1.7 TO 7 .0 PER GILL NET SET.  POUNDS PER SET INCREASED FROM 3.9 TO 24.5.  GILL NET CATCH RATES WERE SEVEN TIMES THE LOCAL MEDIAN FOR NUMBER PER SET AND EIGHT TIMES THE LOCAL MEDIAN FOR POUNDS PER SET.  MEAN LENGTH OF FISH SAMPLED IN GILL NETS INCREASED FROM 20.7 INCHES TO 23.3 INCHES.  MEAN WEIGHT INCREASED FROM 2.3 POUNDS TO 3 .5 POUNDS.  AGE CLASSES 1+ THROUGH 5+ AND 7+ WERE ALL PRESENT.  ALL THESE AGE CLASSES EXHIBITED FAST GROWTH ACCORDING TO STATE GAME FISH GROWTH RATE TABLES.  NO YOUNG OF YEAR FISH WERE SAMPLED, BUT AGE 1+ AND 2+ (STRONGEST AGE CLASS) WERE PRESENT.  THESE FISH WERE FROM NATURAL REPRODUCTION AS THE LAST STOCKING OF NOP WAS IN 1988.  YOUNG OF YEAR PIKE HAVE BEEN SAMPLED IN PAST ASSESSMENTS.  AGE 2+ THROUGH 4+ FISH REPRESENTED 83% OF THE TOTAL NOP CATCH.  IN 1989, AGE 3+ AND 4+ FISH REPRESENTED 91% OF THE TOTAL NOP CATCH.  THOSE FISH WOULD BE AGE 5+ OR 6+ AND OVER 30 INCHES LONG IN THIS ASSESSMENT.  CATCH RATES OF THOSE TWO AGE CLASSES HAS DECLINED SINCE 1989 FROM 1.6 TO 2.0 FISH PER GILL NET SET. POSSIBLE REASONS FOR THIS DECLINE WOULD BE INEFFICIENCY OF THE SAMPLING GEAR IN CAPTURING LARGE NOP AND A DECREASE IN ABUNDANCE OF FISH FROM THOSE AGE CLASSES DUE TO MORTALITY.  CCF CATCH RATES BY NUMBER HAS DECREASED SLIGHTLY SINCE 1989 FROM 0.9 TO 0.7 PER GILL NET SET.  POUNDS PER SET DECREASED FROM 4.2 TO 2.6.  GILL NET CATCH RATES BY NUMBER ARE EQUAL TO THE STATEWIDE MEDIAN.  MEAN LENGTH OF FISH HAS REMAINED CONSTANT AT APPROXIMATELY 21 INCHES LONG, BUT MEAN WEIGHT HAD DECLINED FROM 4.6 TO 3.9 POUNDS.  THE DECREASE IN CATCH RATE ACCOUNTS FOR THE DIFFERENCE IN MEAN WEIGHT.  NO YOUNG OF YEAR FISH SAMPLED IN 1991, BUT THEY BEEN SAMPLED IN PAST ASSESSMENTS. CATFISH WERE LAST STOCKED IN 1983 AND HAVE BEEN SAMPLED IN EVERY ASSESSMENT SINCE 1986.  ENOUGH NATURAL REPRODUCTION SEEMS TO BE OCCURRING TO MAINTAIN POPULATION LEVELS AT THE STATEWIDE MEDIAN.  WHB CATCH RATES BY NUMBER HAS INCREASED FROM 1.3 TO 10.1 PER GILL NET SET.  THIS INCREASE IS DUE TO THE LARGER NUMBER OF YOUNG OF YEAR FISH CAUGHT.  CATCH RATES OF YOUNG OF YEAR FISH HAS INCREASED FROM 1.1 TO 9.8 PER GILL NET SET SINCE 1989.  MEAN LENTH HAS DECREASED FROM 12.6 INCHES TO 7.1 INCHES AND MEAN WEIGHT HAS DECREASED FROM 1.1 POUNDS TO 0.2 POUNDS.  THESE CHANGES ARE AGAIN DUE TO THE LARGE NUMBER OF YOUNG OF YEAR FISH SAMPLED.  FALL SAMPLING MAY HAVE INCREASED THE EFFICIENCY OF CAPTURING YOUNG WHB.  IN ANY CASE, 1991 WAS A GOOD YEAR OF NATURAL REPRODUCTION FOR WHB.  FOUR AGE CLASSES OF WHB WERE SAMPLED, 0+ THROUGH 2+ AND 5+.  ALL EXHIBITED FAST GROWTH. BLG WERE SAMPLED IN GILL NETS FOR THE FIRST TIME IN 1991.  ALL ADULT BLG PREVIOUSLY SAMPLED, SINCE 1975, HAD BEEN COLLECTED BY ELECTROFISHING IN ROCK PILES.  BLG SAMPLED IN THE PRESENT SURVEY WERE ALL CAUGHT IN GILL NET SETS OFF ROCKY POINTS AND ISLANDS.  DUE TO A LACK OF WEED BEDS IN LAC QUI PARLE, THE BLGS SEEM TO PREFER ROCKY AREAS FOR THE COVER AND FORAGE THEY PROVIDE.  TEN FISH WITH A MEAN LENGTH OF 5.9 INCHES AND MEAN WEIGHT OF 0.2 POUNDS WERE SAMPLED.  NUMBERS PER SET WERE APPROXIMATELY EQUAL TO THE LOCAL MEDIAN.  THREE AGE CLASSES, 0+ THROUGH 2+ WERE PRESENT.  SIXTY PERCENT OF THE FISH WERE FROM THE 2+ AGE CLASS. ALL AGE CLASSES EXHIBITED FAST GROWTH.  ONE YOUNG OF YEAR FISH WAS SAMPLED IN 1991 AND YOUNG OF YEAR HAVE BEEN SAMPLED REGULARLY IN PAST ASSESSMENTS. LMB WERE ALSO SAMPLED IN GILL NETS FOR THE FIRST TIME IN 1991.  NUMBER PER SET WAS 0.8 WHICH IS ALMOST THREE TIMES THE LOCAL MEDIAN.  AGE CLASSES 0+ AND 3+ WERE COLLECTED AND 8 OF THE 9 FISH SAMPLED WERE YOUNG OF THE YEAR, RANGING FROM 5.5- 6.9 INCHES LONG.  BOTH AGE CLASSES EXHIBITED FAST GROWTH.  WHC INCREASED FROM 0.4 PER GILL NET SET IN 1986 TO 15.0 PER SET IN 1991.  HOWEVER, NO WHC WERE SAMPLED IN 1989.  NUMBERS PER SET WERE 21 TIMES GREATER THAN THE STATE MEDIAN IN 1991.  MEAN LENGTH OF FISH WAS 4.8 INCHES AND MEAN WEIGHT WAS 0.06 POUNDS.  NINETY NINE PERCENT OF THE WHC SAMPLED WERE YOUNG OF THE YEAR FISH RANGING IN LENGTH FROM 4.2 INCHES TO 5.9 INCHES.  BOTH OF THE ADULT FISH SAMPLED WERE AGE 2+ AND WERE IN THE 8 INCH LENGTH GROUP.  BLC CATCH RATES HAVE INCREASED APPROXIMATELY 10 TIMES SINCE 1989, FROM 1.6 PER SET TO 10.6 PER SET.  EIGHTY PERCENT OF THIS INCREASED CATCH CONSISTED OF YOUNG OF YEAR FISH 3.7 TO 5.4 INCHES LONG.  A COMBINATION OF THE FALL SAMPLING PERIOD AND A VERY GOOD REPRODUCTIVE YEAR OF BLC IN 1991 PROBABLY ACCOUNT FOR THE INCREASED CATCH OF YOUNG OF YEAR.  NO YOUNG OF YEAR CAUGHT IN GILL NETS IN 1989.  MEAN LENGTH OF FISH SAMPLED WAS 5.0 INCHES WITH A MEAN WEIGHT OF 0.1 POUNDS. THIS WAS A DECREASE FROM 1989 WHEN MEAN LENGTH AND WEIGHT WERE 8.6 INCHES AND 0.4 POUNDS, RESPECTIVELY.  THIS DECREASE IN MEAN LENGTH AND WEIGHT WAS DUE TO THE INCREASED CATCH OF YOUNG OF YEAR BLC.  BLC CATCH RATES WERE APPROXIMATELY FOUR TIMES THE LOCAL MEDIAN.  FOUR AGE CLASSES OF BLC WERE REPRESENTED IN THE CATCH, 0+ THROUGH AND 5+. THE STRONGEST AGE CLASSES WERE 0+ AND 1+.  YOUNG OF YEAR BLC HAVE BEEN SAMPLED REGULARLY IN SHORELINE SEINING IN PAST YEARS.  IN 1989, FOUR AGE CLASSES WERE REPRESENTED, 1+ THROUGH 4+, WITH 1+ AND 3+ BEING MOST PREVALENT.  THOSE FISH WOULD NOW BE AGE 3+ AND 5+ IN THIS ASSESSMENT.  NO AGE 3+ FISH WERE SAMPLED AND ONLY ONE AGE 5+ FISH. THOSE FISH WOULD BE APPROXIMATELY 11 TO 13 INCHES LONG ACCORDING TO PAST SAMPLES.  THE DECLINE IN THE CATCH OF THOSE TWO AGE CLASSES MAY BE DUE TO DECREASED EFFICIENCY OF THE GEAR IN SAMPLING LARGE CRAPPIE AND A DECREASE IN NUMBERS OF LARGE CRAPPIE DUE TO MORTALITY.  TRAPNETTING IN THE SPRING MAY BETTER SAMPLE LARGER BLC.  ALL AGE CLASSES IN THIS ASSESSMENT EXHIBITED FAST GROWTH. YEP CATCH RATES INCREASED APPROXIMATELY FIVE TIMES SINCE 1989, FROM 4.0 PER GILL NET SET TO 21.9 PER GILL NET SET.  NUMBER PER SET IN 1991 WAS TWICE THE LOCAL MEDIAN.  MEAN LENGTH AND WEIGHT OF FISH SAMPLED WERE 8.9 INCHES AND 0.4 POUNDS.  THESE SIZE CHARACTERISTICS HAVE REMAINED SIMILAR SINCE THE 1989 SURVEY.  FOUR AGE CLASSES WERE PRESENT, 1+ THROUGH 4+.  ALL AGE CLASSES EXHIBITED FAST GROWTH.  AGE CLASSES 1+ AND 2+ MADE UP 26% AND 67% OF SAMPLED FISH RESPECTIVELY.  IN 1989, 4+ FISH WERE THE STRONGEST AGE CLASS, COMPRISING 58% OF THE CATCH.  VERY FEW FISH OLDER THAN 4 HAVE BEEN SAMPLED.  THESE FISH WOULD BE LONGER THAN 12 INCHES.  PERCH PROBABLY DON'T LIVE MUCH LONGER THAN FOUR YEARS IN THE CONDITIONS FOUND IN LAC QUI PARLE.  DUE TO THE FERTILITY OF THE WATER, YEP GROWTH IS VERY RAPID AND THIS MOST LIKELY DECREASES THE LIFE SPAN OF THIS FISH.  YOUNG OF YEAR PERCH HAVE BEEN SAMPLED REGULARLY IN PAST ASSESSMENTS.  WAE CATCH RATES INCREASED FIVE TIMES SINCE 1989 FROM 5.8 TO 30.6 FISH PER GILL NET SET. NUMBERS PER SET WERE APPROXIMATELY 11 TIMES THE LOCAL MEDIAN.  MEAN LENGTH AND WEIGHT OF FISH SAMPLED IN GILL NETS DECLINED FROM 17.7 INCHES TO 12.7 INCHES AND 2.1 POUNDS TO 0.9 POUNDS, RESPECTIVELY.  THIS DECREASE IN SIZE IS DUE TO THE LARGE NUMBER OF YOUNG OF YEAR FISH CAUGHT, 37% OF THE TOTAL CATCH .  YOUNG OF YEAR WAE RANGED IN LENGTH FROM 6.0 TO 10.2 INCHES.  IN 1989, ONLY TWO FISH LESS THAN 12 INCHES WERE SAMPLED IN GILL NETS. ALL AGE CLASSES FROM 0+ TO 10+ SAMPLED IN THE PRESENT SURVEY.  ALL YEAR CLASSES EXHIBITED FAST GROWTH.  AGE CLASSES 0+ THROUGH 2+ MADE UP 93% OF THE SAMPLE.  THE 1991 YEAR CLASS COMPRISED 45% OF THE TOTAL CATCH, AND WAS DUE ENTIRELY TO NATURAL REPRODUCTION.  NATURAL REPRODUCTION ALSO PRODUCED THE TWO STRONGEST YEAR CLASSES, (1988 AND 1984), OF FISH SAMPLED THREE YEARS AND OLDER. IN 1989, THE STRONGEST YEAR CLASSES WERE 1987 THROUGH 1985.  TWO OF THESE THREE YEAR CLASSES WERE FROM STOCKED YEARS.  ALL THREE OF THESE YEAR CLASSES WERE STILL PRESENT, IN LOW NUMBERS, IN THE PRESENT ASSESSMENT.  SOME NATURAL REPRODUCTION IS OCCURRING EVERY YEAR AS THERE ARE NO MISSING YEAR CLASSES.  SOME STRONG YEAR CLASSES ARE FROM NATURAL REPRODUCTION AND SOME FROM A COMBINATION OF NATURAL REPRODUCTION AND STOCKING.  PRIOR TO 1990 WAE FRY WERE STOCKED IN ODD NUMBERS YEARS.  STARTING IN 1990 A REVISED STOCKING SCHEDULE WAS INSTITUTED IN WHICH STOCKING WOULD BE ON A THREE YEAR ROTATION OF FINGERLINGS, NO STOCKING AND FRY.  THIS STOCKING SCHEDULE IS CURRENTLY BEING EVALUATED BY ANNUAL FALL GILL- NETTING AND ELECTROFISHING TO DETERMINE YEAR CLASS STRENGTH, THE EXTENT OF NATURAL REPRODUCTION, SUCCESS OF WAE FRY AND FINGERLING STOCKINGS AND THE CONTRIBUTION OF STOCKING TO THE WAE POPULATION OF LAC QUI PARLE.  CARP ARE A MAJOR COMPONENT OF THE COMMERCIAL FISHERY IN LAC QUI PARLE.  AN AVERAGE OF 250,263 POUNDS PER YEAR HAVE BEEN REMOVED OVER THE LAST THREE WINTER SEASONS.  CARP CATCH RATES INCREASED 2.5 TIMES FROM 2.3 TO 5.9 FISH PER GILL NET SET, BUT POUNDS PER SET DECREASED FROM 13.3 TO 4.9.  THIS DECREASE IN POUNDS PER SET WAS BECAUSE 76% OF THE CATCH WERE YOUNG OF YEAR FISH.  MEAN LENGTH OF CARP WAS 8.8 INCHES.  CARP CATCH RATES ARE 2.5 TIMES THE LOCAL MEDIAN.  BIB ARE THE OTHER MAJOR COMPONENT OF THE COMMERCIAL FISHERY.  AN AVERAGE OF 260,041 POUNDS PER YEAR HAVE BEEN REMOVED OVER THE LAST THREE YEARS.  96% OF BUFFALO SAMPLED IN 1991 WERE YOUNG OF YEAR FISH, RANGING FROM 4.5 TO 7.4 INCHES LONG. CATCH RATES WERE 14.6 TIMES THE STATEWIDE MEDIAN. BLB ARE ALSO SOUGHT BY THE COMMERCIAL FISHERY. THE CATCH RATE OF BLB INCREASED 9.9 TIMES, FROM 1.5 PER GILL NET SET IN 1989 TO 14.9 PER GILL NET SET IN 1991.  1991 CATCH RATE WERE APPROXIMATELY EQUAL TO THE LOCAL MEDIAN.  MEAN LENGTH AND WEIGHT OF BLH WERE 9.0 INCHES AND 0.4 POUNDS, RESPECTIVELY.  THIS SIZE BLH IS READILY ACCEPTED BY ANGLERS AND COMMERCIAL FISHERMEN.  FRD ARE ANOTHER COMPONENT OF THE COMMERCIAL FISHERY. THEY, ALONG WITH OTHER NON-GAME FISH SUCH AS YOUNG CARP AND BUFFALO ARE IMPORTANT FORAGE FOR TOP PREDATORS IN THE LAKE.  DRUM CATCH RATE BY NUMBER HAS INCREASED FROM 14.6 PER GILL NET SET IN 1989 TO 31.4 PER GILL NET SET IN 1991.  CATCH RATE BY WEIGHT HAS DECREASED FROM 11.0 TO 4.6 POUNDS PER SET.  THIS DECREASE IN SIZE IS AGAIN DUE TO THE LARGE NUMBER OF YOUNG OF YEAR SAMPLED.  SEVENTY EIGHT PERCENT OF THE CATCH WAS YOY.  DRUM CATCHES WERE 2.6 TIMES THE LOCAL MEDIAN.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lac qui Parle Lake is a large, windswept, nutrient rich lake located in west-central Minnesota.  The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers manages the lake for flood control purposes.  Lac qui Parle's watershed measures over 4,000 square miles.  It is comprised primarily of intensively drained agricultural land.  This has been to the detriment of Lac qui Parle Lake.  Today the lake suffers from algal blooms, turbid water, sedimentation, extreme water level fluctuations, and shoreline erosion.  These are the direct result of heavy flows from the watershed that carry large amounts of nutrients and soil.  This hasn't always been the case.  Lac qui Parle Lake was described in the 1930s as \"clean and clear with an abundance of freshwater clams\".  Unless major land use changes are made in the watershed, it is unlikely that Lac qui Parle Lake will be anything more than a shallow, silt-laden, cattail marsh in a few hundred years.     Walleye abundance in Lac qui Parle Lake exceeded what is considered normal for similar lakes in 1998 when 22 walleye were caught per gill net.  These fish were from moderate to strong 1995-96 year classes and primarily measured 12-17 inches.  Fry were stocked in 1995 and fingerlings in 1996.  A fin-clipping study revealed that stocked fingerlings comprised 20% of the 1996 year class, whereas 80% was from natural reproduction.  Natural reproduction has, at times, produced large numbers of walleye in Lac qui Parle Lake.  However supplemental stockings are probably necessary to maintain a consistent high quality population.     Young-of-year walleye are sampled every fall with electrofishing.  A poor catch in 1998 suggested that the spring fry stocking had met with very limited success.  Electrofishing in 1997 also suggested a weak year class.  Considering the unattractive scenario of two consecutively weak walleye year classes, approximately 42,000 walleye fingerlings were stocked during the fall of 1998.  These fish received a fin clip and their contribution to the walleye population will be evaluated in 1999 through electrofishing and netting.     In 1999 a new walleye stocking program will be initiated at Lac qui Parle Lake.  The program is based on the results of a stocking evaluation that has been underway at the lake since 1990.  Three million fry will be stocked two of three years under the new program, instead of the previous three year rotation of fry, fingerlings, and no stocking.  If neccessary, fingerlings will be stocked as a backup option.  The walleye stocking program will continue to be evaluated with annual sampling.     Moderate numbers of northern pike were present in 1998 with the majority of them weighing from 2-6 pounds.  Northerns were present from the 1994-1998 year classes, an indication of consistent spawning success.  Northern pike abundance has been moderate to high since 1991.  This has probably been the result of good spring spawning conditions.  Lac qui Parle's watershed has some good pike spawning and nursery habitat in the form of seasonally flooded wetlands.  Unfortunately, most seasonally flooded wetlands have been drained.  The long term sustainability of the northern pike population depends on the protection and restoration of these wetland habitats.     Other species that were present in 1998 in decent numbers and sizes included yellow perch, white bass, and black crappie.  A large year class of white bass was spawned in 1998.  Bullhead numbers remained low, however channel catfish abundance has increased in recent years.  Catfish apparently migrated into Lac qui Parle during the high spring water levels in 1997 from the Minnesota River downstream.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lac qui Parle is a 5,589 acre lake located in west-central Minnesota that is managed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers as a flood control impoundment.  The Department of Natural Resources manages the lake primarily for walleye and northern pike.     A 15-inch walleye minimum size regulation was implemented on Lac qui Parle Lake in 1996.  Evaluation of this regulation concluded it was not effective in increasing averate size of walleye and may have caused an over-abundance of smaller walleye.  Too many small walleye can cause slow growth and increased death rates due to competition for limited forage.  The minimum size regulation was abolished in 2005 and replaced by a four fish daily limit, in which one could be 20 inches or larger.  The impacts of this new regulation will continue to be monitored with future assessments.     Walleye abundance in Lac qui Parle Lake had declined in recent years.  As a result of this decline, a combination of adult, fingerling and yearling walleye were stocked in the fall of 2004 and spring of 2005.  These stockings appeared to have contributed as the 2005 assessment indicated that walleye abundance had improved substantially.  Most sampled walleye ranged from 12-18 inches.  High spring water levels in 2005 had allowed for increased production of forage fish, particularly minnow species, and young-of-year sheepshead and white bass.  As a result, walleye growth improved.  Considering improved growth, anglers can expect good numbers of 14-20 inch walleye to persist in 2006.     Northern pike abundance was considered typical for Lac qui Parle Lake.  As a result of poor spawning conditions caused by low spring runoff, recent year classes of pike were weak or missing.  However, although 2005 was another spring with below average runoff, good reproduction was documented.  Construction of a northern pike spawning area was completed in the summer of 2004 and may have contributed to improved reproduction.  With the upcoming 2005 year class, anglers can expect an increase in the numbers of 20-23 inch pike in 2006.     Channel catfish abundance remained in the upper end of the normal range for Lac qui Parle Lake.  Catfish ranged from 11-22 inches, with most measuring 16-19 inches.  Shoreline seining sampled numerous young-of-year channel catfish.  This was the first substantial catfish reproduction documented in Lac qui Parle Lake.  High water levels during June and July appeared to enhance spawning habitat and increased reproductive success.     Black and white crappie abundance was in the lower end of the normal range for Lac qui Parle Lake.  However, anglers have reported fair success for these species in recent years, particularly in spring and winter.  Most crappie sampled in 2005 were quality sized, measuring 10-12 inches.       White bass abundance was the highest recorded for Lac qui Parle Lake.  However, the majority of sampled bass were young-of-year measuring less than 6 inches.  Past assessments indicate that small bass experience high mortality and few survive to age one.  The contribution of the 2005 year class will be further evaluated with future assessments.     Bluegill and yellow perch were sampled in low abundance, but in numbers consistent with recent assessments.  Anglers reported fair success for bluegill in 2005, mainly around the rocks in the southern part of the lake.  Most sampled perch were quality sized measuring over 10 inches.     Management activies scheduled for Lac qui Parle lake in 2006 include stocking approximately 3 million walleye fry, monitoring of winter dissolved oxygen and fishing pressure, and a fisheries population assessment.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lac qui Parle Lake (LQP) is located three miles southwest of Milan in western Minnesota.  It is an impoundment of the Minnesota River and its water level is controlled by Churchill Dam.  LQP is a highly productive lake that measures 5,589 acres and has a maximum depth of 15 feet.  Watersheds that ultimately drain into LQP include the Upper Minnesota, Yellow Bank, Lac qui Parle, Pomme de Terre and a portion of the Chippewa.  LQP is operated as a flood control reservoir and some years water levels will fluctuate by more than five feet.  Depending on the timing and extent of the water level fluctuations, fish may experience good or poor natural reproduction.  Some species do well when spring water levels are high, whereas others benefit from lower water levels. <br> \n <br> \n LQP has frequently provided good fishing for walleye.  Walleye numbers have been lower than normal since 2006, with the exception of 2011.  This has occurred even though high numbers of walleye fry and fingerlings have been stocked.  Five walleye were caught per gill net during 2012, which was slightly below LQP's normal range of 7-27.  The walleye were primarily from the 2010 and 2011 year classes and were 12-18 inches.  Fingerling stocking and natural reproduction have both made substantial contributions to the walleye population based on marking studies.  Natural reproduction has produced the two strongest walleye year classes on record (2001 and 2011), however it has been very inconsistent and the population has been supplemented by stocking when appropriate.  The 2011 walleye have grown slowly and were only 13.5 inches after three summers.  Normal growth would have been 15.5 inches or larger.  Slow growth of walleye has occurred at times on Lac qui Parle Lake and is attributed to low forage availability.   <br> \n <br> \nCrappie fishing has been good to excellent in recent years.  The crappie population increased substantially following the decrease in the walleye population.  High numbers of 2010 and 2011 year class crappie were caught during sampling and those fish are expected to provide continued good fishing.  Most crappie in 2013 measured 8-11 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nHigh numbers of freshwater drum and white bass have been present at times.  Although these are important forage species for walleye, they also compete with them for resources.  Anglers are encouraged to harvest drum and white bass.  Both species are good to eat, especially if the small amounts of red meat are trimmed from the fillets.  Excellent recipes for cooking drum can be found by searching the internet for \"drum recipes\". <br> \n <br> \nSeveral additional species were present in numbers worth pursuing.  Northern pike were moderately abundant with fish from the 2007-11 year classes present, including fish that exceeded 30 inches.  Channel catfish were abundant with many fish over 20 inches.  Very limited angling for channel catfish has been observed.  Considering their high numbers and large sizes, catfish enthusiasts should consider a trip to Lac qui Parle Lake. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lac qui Parle (LQP) Lake is a large, shallow, windswept, nutrient rich reservoir located in west-central Minnesota.  The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers manages the lake for flood control purposes.  Its watershed measures over 4,000 square miles and consists primarily of intensively drained agricultural land.  Lac qui Parle Lake suffers from severe algae blooms, high turbidity, sedimentation, shoreline erosion, and extreme water level fluctuations.  These are the result of high flows which contain excessive nutrients and sediments entering from the watershed.  LQP Lake hasn't always been this way.  In the 1930's it was described as clean and clear with an abundance of freshwater clams.  Unless major land use changes occur in the watershed, LQP Lake will probably become a shallow, silt-laden cattail marsh within a few hundred years.       Although LQP Lake has serious water quality problems, it remains one of Minnesota's premier walleye lakes.  Walleye were moderately abundant in 1999, with fish present from ten year classes.  Most walleye were from the 1995 and 1996 year classes and measured 14-21 inches.  These fish were small for their age and should have measured 16-22 inches.  Their poor growth was probably due to a decline in forage during recent years, and a less than ideal 1997 growing season.     A 15 inch minimum walleye length limit was implemented on LQP Lake in 1996 as part of a statewide experimental regulations study.  Its objectives are to increase the average length of walleye harvested by anglers, and to increase the number of larger walleye in the lake.  The regulation will be evaluated through 2002, and depending upon its effectiveness it will remain in effect, be changed, or abolished.     Walleye stocking is an important management tool at LQP Lake.  Several studies have shown that fry stocking, natural reproduction, and under certain conditions, fingerling stocking can all contribute substantially to the walleye population.  Fry are routinely stocked two of three years.  If annual assessments reveal a need, fingerlings may also be stocked.  Natural reproduction can produce large numbers of young walleye during springs with suitable spawning conditions.     Moderate numbers of northern pike, crappie, white bass, and channel catfish were present in 1999.  The pike population has declined considerably since the mid 1990's, probably due to poor spawning conditions during the last few years.  Ideal pike spawning areas are seasonally flooded, grassy wetlands that hold spring run-off for at least a month.  Unfortunately, most of these in the LQP Lake watershed have been drained.  The long term sustainability of the northern pike population depends on the protection and restoration of these wetland habitats.     Channel catfish abundance increased considerably during 1997 when they migrated into the lake from the Minnesota River during the \"great flood\".  Anglers caught numerous channel catfish just upstream from LQP Lake at the Marsh Lake spillway during the summer.     A new public access was installed on the upper basin of LQP Lake at Hanthos Beach in 1999, and 1900 feet of shoreline at the site were stabilized with riprap.  These were cooperative projects completed by Eagle Scout Noah Borstad, the LQP Lake Association, the LQP Watershed Project Association, the Appleton Sportsmens Club, Chippewa County Pheasants Forever, MinnKota Sportsmens Club, LQP County Pheasants Forever, LQP County, LQP SWCD, and the MN DNR.     Future management activities will include annual assessments, stocking as needed, and work within the watershed to help improve the water quality of the lake and its associated streams.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lac qui Parle Lake is a large (5,589 acres) class 41 lake in west central Minnesota located in Lac qui Parle, Chippewa, and Swift Counties.  It is an impoundment of the Minnesota River, which is its major inlet and outlet.  The lake is primarily managed for walleye and northern pike, but also provides fishing opportunities for white bass, crappie, and channel catfish.   <br> \n <br> \nAnglers can expect walleye fishing to be difficult on Lac qui Parle.  Walleye abundance in 2008 was at its lowest level ever recorded.  Those walleye that are caught are going to average 14.6 inches long and 1.3 lbs.  Walleye fishing is likely going to improve, as two abundant year classes (2007 and 2008) continue to grow and provide opportunities for anglers.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie continue to provide excellent opportunities for anglers.  This is due to an abundant 2005 year class of fish.  Anglers can expect to see black crappie 10.2 inches and 0.7 lb.  Unfortunately, the black crappie population will likely decline over the next few years due to limited numbers of younger fish.   <br> \n <br> \nAlthough abundance has declined slightly from 2007, fishermen can still expect to see northern pike show up in their catches.  The northern pike that were sampled in 2008 had an average size of 3.2 lbs. and 22.3 inches.  Pike abundance will likely remain stable as several young of year fish were sampled in 2008.   <br> \n <br> \nWhite bass abundance was at its lowest level since 2004.  Most of the fish were three-years-old and had an average size of 10 inches and 0.6 lb.  Catfish anglers should be pleased with Lac qui Parle.  Channel catfish are at their highest abundance ever recorded.  Catfish up to 28 inches long were sampled, but 67% were 12-15 inches long.  <br> \n <br> \nOther game fish species sampled in low abundance were bluegill and yellow perch.  Freshwater drum abundance from 2007, 82% being eleven inches or less.  Other common non-game fish sampled were black bullhead, common carp, white sucker, and redhorse. <br> \n <br> \nFuture management activities planned for Lac qui Parle include monitoring of winter dissolved oxygen levels and fishing pressure, fish stocking as needed, fall population assessments and electrofishing for young-of-year walleye.   </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lac qui Parle Lake (LQP) is located three miles southwest of Milan in western Minnesota.  It is a 5,589 acre impoundment of the Minnesota River with a maximum depth of 15 feet.  Its water level is controlled by Churchill Dam which is located ? mile downstream on the Minnesota River.  Watersheds that drain into LQP include the Upper Minnesota, Yellow Bank, Lac qui Parle, Pomme de Terre and a portion of the Chippewa.  LQP is operated as a flood control reservoir and some years water levels will fluctuate by more than five feet.  Depending on the timing and extent of the water level fluctuations, fish may experience good to poor natural reproduction.   <br> \nThis 2019 survey was conducted to collect routine fish population data using gill nets, shoreline seining and fall night electrofishing.  These data can be compared to historical standard and targeted survey data from LQP. <br> \n <br> \nLQP often provides good Walleye fishing.  The Walleye population has resulted from natural reproduction, stocking and migration from upstream water bodies.  Walleye numbers have remained relatively stable over the last several years.  Fourteen Walleyes were caught per gill net in 2019, indicating a moderate population.  Walleyes were present from a wide range of sizes.  The 2017 year class comprised 51% of the sample and they averaged 16 inches.  Walleyes have grown slower than expected at times, especially young Walleyes, likely due to limited food.  LQP becomes extremely turbid during strong winds due to sediment suspension.  This limits the ability of important food organisms to reproduce and grow, especially beneficial algae, zooplankton and small fish.  In addition, the highly variable water levels affect the ability of many fish species to successfully spawn.  These factors impact the production of food items that are important for successful growth and recruitment of Walleyes. <br> \n <br> \nCrappie fishing has been very good for many years.  The crappie population has typically been higher when the Walleye population has been lower.  Crappies were abundant in the 2019 survey and many were 11-13 inches.  Smaller crappies were also abundant which should keep the population healthy into the future. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike were moderately abundant from a wide range of sizes, including large pike up to 38 inches.  Anglers and spearers have reported good pike fishing during recent years.  Pike have experienced relatively consistent natural reproduction regardless of spring water levels.  It's likely they have been finding suitable spawning habitat along the north end of the lake where wetlands have been formed by beaver dams, or along the edges of emergent vegetation.  LQP is in the southern Northern Pike zone where the possession limit is two fish with a minimum size limit of 24 inches.  See the Minnesota Fishing Regulations booklet for more details. <br> \n <br> \nHigh numbers of Freshwater Drum were present.  Small drum are important food for many species of fish, however large drum compete with game fish for resources.  Anglers are encouraged to harvest drum.  They are good to eat, especially if the small amounts of red meat are trimmed from the fillets.  Excellent recipes for cooking drum can be found on the internet by searching \"drum recipes\".  Drum are an excellent choice for a fish fry because there is no possession limit. <br> \n <br> \nChannel Catfish were abundant from a wide range of sizes.  Very little angling for catfish has been known to occur.  Considering their high numbers and large sizes, catfish enthusiasts should consider a trip to LQP. <br> \n <br> \nManagement activities for LQP include annual fish surveys, Walleye stocking, monitoring winter dissolved oxygen and ice-house counts.  Zebra mussels were found to be present in 2016.  Anglers are reminded to drain all water from boats, motors, compartments and containers before leaving the lake, and to keep drain plugs out while transporting watercraft. <br> \n</p>",
