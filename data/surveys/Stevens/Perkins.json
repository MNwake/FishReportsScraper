Backpack electrofishing and/or seining (15 ft or 50 ft) were conducted at 14 stations, representing a variety of habitat types, along the shoreline of Perkins Lake.  The survey was conducted during the five-year sampling window for intensive monitoring efforts within the Pomme de Terre River watershed, and will be contributing to a watershed assessment process in coordination with Minnesota Pollution Control Agency.\n\nNineteen species were collected during this survey, indicating a relatively diverse nearshore fish community.  Three species (Banded Killifish, Iowa Darter, and Logperch) were considered \"intolerant\" and three species (Black Bullhead, Common Carp, and Green Sunfish) were considered \"tolerant\" based on current tolerance classifications for Minnesota lakes.\n\nNearshore catch data will be used along with gill and trap net catch data to develop an Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) score, which is indicative of the health of Perkins Lake.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Perkins Lake is a shallow, eutrophic lake situated on the Pomme de Terre River. It is the lower lake on a chain of three lakes.  Water quality is impaired due to the nutrients and sediments carried in by the Pomme de Terre River which is fed from an extensive agriculture-based watershed.  Wind induced re-suspension of sediments is also common.  Dense algal blooms can occur during the summer months.  Both emergent and submergent vegetation is rare.  The lakes location on the Pomme de Terre River makes it subject to frequent fluctuations in water level.  Despite these severe limiting environmental conditions, this fertile lake continues to  sustain good quality fishing opportunities for walleye, yellow perch and black crappie.Walleye catches of 25.2 fish per net is well above the expected range for this lake.  It is also the highest catch rate ever recorded for this lake.  The fish tend to run small with a mean length of 12.4 inches.  The largest fish sampled was 27.4 inches.  A very strong 1996 natural year class comprised the majority of the catch.  These two year old fish averaged 12 inches and will grow to approximately 15 inches by the 1999 fishing season to provide an excellent fishing opportunity.   The walleye population is also supplemented with fry stocking during odd numbered years.Yellow perch numbers were also good.  Catches of 10.3 fish per net are normal for this lake type.  Size distribution is favorable with almost 70% of the fish exceeding 8 inches.  The largest fish sampled was 10.7 inches.  Black crappie are also relatively abundant.  The fish are of good size with 81% of the fish exceeding 9 inches and the largest fish going almost 13 inches.  This fishery may provide good ice-out angling opportunity in the northeast bay or in Middle Pomme de Terre Lake.Lakeshore residents have expressed concerns regarding roughfish abundance, however, the riverine system and degraded water quality are ideal conditions for roughfish to flourish.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Perkins Lake is a 516-acre shallow impoundment of the Pomme de Terre River.  It is approximately nine miles northeast of Morris.  The existing dam creating the pool within the river was constructed by Works Progress Administration crews in 1938.  A public access site is located on the southwest shore just north of the Donnelly Rod & Gun Club park facility.   <br> \n <br> \nMaximum depth of the pool is 13.0 feet.  Average depth is estimated as 8.0 feet.  Low water clarity limits coverage and diversity of aquatic vegetation within the lake.  Due to high fertility of the water fish grow rapidly and Perkins Lake can provide good fishing opportunities.   <br> \n <br> \nA fisheries survey was completed on Perkins Lake, June 12-15, 2017.  A combination of six gill nets and nine trap nets were used to sample the fish community.  Netting was preceded by electrofishing on May 18 to gain estimates of Largemouth Bass abundance and population size structure.   <br> \n <br> \nWalleye catches in gill nets (8.0/gill net) were above average for similar lakes in Minnesota.  Lengths varied from 12.1-22.5 inches.  Average size was 16.5 inches and 1.6 pounds.  Age distribution of Walleyes provided documentation that natural reproduction and fry stocking contribute to population abundance.  Walleye fry are stocked in odd-numbered years to supplement natural production.  Northern Pike are moderately abundant (5.5/gill net).  Average size was 25.3 inches and 3.7 pounds (maximum length was 33.3 inches).  Perkins Lake supports both Black and White Crappie.  Black Crappie are more common (3.2/trap net) than White Crappie (0.1/trap net).  Average size of Black and White Crappie was 6.5 and 8.9 inches, respectively.  A majority (83%) of Black Crappie were young (age 2).  Fishing quality will improve with additional growth and this dominant year class will likely reach harvestable size early in 2019.  Bluegill catches continued to be modest (8.6/trap net) during the 2017 survey.  Most (53%) were young (age 2), thus average length was low at 5.8 inches.  Despite a modest average length, rapid growth has allowed some individuals to exceed 10.0 inches.  Spring electrofishing efforts documented an expanded Largemouth Bass population.  Eighty-seven bass were captured in 2017 as compared to a total of seven collected in the three previous surveys since 1998.  Average length was 8.7 inches, but larger individuals are present (maximum length 19.6 inches).  A substantial 2015 year class will likely provide good fishing opportunities in the coming years.  Yellow Perch remain common (15.8/gill net) in Perkins Lake.  Individuals averaged 6.4 inches.  The largest perch collected was 10.7 inches and six-years-old.  Most perch are not currently a harvestable size.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack Bullhead, Common Carp, and White Sucker tend to be abundant in systems with high productivity and low water clarity.  These three underutilized species comprised approximately 55% of total number and weight of fish captured in gill nets during the survey. <br> \n <br> \nPerkins Lake is not currently known to be infested with any aquatic invasive species beyond Common Carp.  Anglers are reminded to drain boats and equipment prior to moving between bodies of water to minimize the risk of transferring aquatic invasive species to this or other lakes. <br> \n</p>",

Walleye numbers are down slightly from the 1980 survey but it is not a significant change. Northern Pike numbers remain low but several quality size individuals were sampled. Black Bullhead and Carp indices are still very high. Bluegill numbers have declined since 1980 when approximately 10,500 stunted Bluegills were stocked from Vermont Lake. This stocking seems to have had only a short term effect on the lake. This indicates limited natural reproduction in the lake.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Perkins Lake is a shallow, turbid lake located on the Pomme de Terre River in Stevens County. Poor water quality, lack of submerged aquatic vegetation and degraded aquatic habitat has been described in lake survey reports since the initial survey in 1947. The river transports excessive amounts of nutrients and sediments through the lake from very expansive and predominately cultivated watershed area. High total phosphorous and total suspended solid concentrations have been documented in annual water quality monitoring conducted by the Perkins Lake Association.  Water transparency during the 2007 assessment was 1.2 feet. Dense blue-green algae blooms are common in July and August. <br> \n <br> \nDespite the adverse environmental conditions, Perkins Lake supports a viable fishery. Those native gamefishes reasonably tolerant of existing habitat conditions include walleye and crappie.   <br> \n <br> \nPerkins Lake or the Pomme de Terre River supports a naturally recruiting walleye population.  Supplemental fry stockings are programmed in odd-numbered years to sustain greater walleye abundance and a more consistent fishery.  Walleye are abundant and grow exceptionally fast in absence of competition with other predators.  Size distribution of the walleye population is skewed toward a high proportion of one-year-old fish established from natural reproduction in 2006.  Average size of walleye measured during the 2007 survey was correspondingly small, but yet big enough to interest consumptive anglers. Captures averaged 15.7 inches in length and 1.5 pounds.  Anglers seeking larger walleye have reason to be optimistic.  Fifteen percent of the walleye catch exceeded 20.0 inches in length.  Twenty-five inch and larger walleye have been captured in prior surveys.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie reproductive success and recruitment to the fishery have been good in recent years.  Elevated catches in 2007 stemmed from presence of two strong year classes established in 2004 and 2005.  Two- and three-year-old crappie made up 88% of the total catch recorded from trapnets.  Crappie also grow fast.  Many of the three-year-old crappie had already grown to 10.0 inches in length. The largest black crappie caught was 13.0 inches in length.  Perkins Lake also supports a white crappie population.  This species in less abundant, but age and size structure are very similar to black crappie. <br> \n <br> \nVegetation dependent and ambush feeders such as northern pike and largemouth bass don't fare well in Perkins Lake.  Only seven northern pike were captured in gillnets.  The captures averaged 19.2 inches.  The largest captured was 25.0 inches in length.  No largemouth bass were captured during the 2007 spring electrofishing survey.  The few recorded in trapnet catches averaged only 10.5 inches in length.  Bluegill abundance is similarly limited.  Nineteen bluegill were captured in trapnets.  While not abundant, they grow fast and can add to the fishing experience.  Ten of those 19 captured were near or exceeded 8.0 inches in length.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch have been able to sustain a moderately abundant population.  Anglers can anticipate a modest fishery for the next few years.  Two strong age groups are recruiting towards a harvestable-size.  Thirty-seven percent of the perch measured in 2007 exceeded 9.0 inches in length. Cohorts of the second age group averaged 7.0 inches.  It is reasonable to project that these fish will grow to exceed 10.0 inches. <br> \n <br> \nDue to limiting habitat conditions for various gamefishes, underutilized or roughfish species constitute much of the lake's carrying capacity.  Black bullhead, common carp, and white sucker attributed to over 50% of the poundage of all fish caught in gillnets. <br> \n</p>",

Backpack electrofishing and/or seining were conducted at 14 stations, representing a variety of habitat types, along the shoreline of Perkins Lake.  The survey was conducted during the five-year sampling window for intensive monitoring efforts within the Pomme de Terre River watershed, and will be contributing to a watershed assessment process in coordination with Minnesota Pollution Control Agency.\n\nTwenty species were collected during this survey.  Two species (Iowa Darter and Logperch) were considered \"intolerant\" and five species (Black Bullhead, Common Carp, Fathead Minnow, Green Sunfish, and Orangespotted Sunfish) were considered \"tolerant\" based on current tolerance classifications for Minnesota lakes. \n\nNearshore catch data will be used along with gill and trap net catch data to develop an Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) score, which is indicative of the health of Perkins Lake.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Perkins Lake is a shallow, turbid lake located on the Pomme de Terre River in Stevens County.  Poor water clarity, lack of aquatic vegetation, and degraded aquatic habitat have been described in lake survey reports since the initial survey in 1947.  The river transports excessive amounts of nutrients and sediment to the lake from the predominately agricultural watershed.  High total phosphorus and total suspended solid concentrations have been documented in annual water quality monitoring done by the Perkins Lake Association, as part of the Stevens County Water Plan.  Seechi disk transparency averages about 2.0 feet during summer months.  Dense blue-green algal blooms are common in July and August.Despite the adverse environmental conditions, Perkins Lake supports a viable fishery.  Walleye are relatively abundant.  Gill net catches averaged 13.6 fish/net in 2003.  Fish ranged from 9 to 28 inches in length.  Over one-half of the fish captured were two-year-old fish that averaged about 12.5 inches in length.  This year class corresponds to a year of fry stocking in 2001.  Walleye fry are stocked in odd-numbered years to supplement the natural reproduction that is known to occur throughout the Pomme de Terre River system.      Black crappie are also relatively abundant.  The fish are mostly fast growing two and three year olds.  The age-3 fish averaged 10.5 inches in length in early August of 2003.  Bluegill numbers are limited, but they are also experiencing rapid growth rates.  Two-thirds of the fish captured were 8.0 inches or greater in length.  Yellow perch may also provide an additional angling opportunity.  Most of the fish were between 7 and 9 inches in length.   </p>",

The Northern Pike population appears to be healthy and has a relatively large mean size.  Walleye numbers reflect stocking efforts over the past 3 yrs.  Roughfish (Black Bullhead & Carp) are abundant. Susceptibility of Bigmouth Buffalo to the gear probably changed as the size frequency shifted upward.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Perkins Lake is a shallow, turbid, and hypereutrophic lake located at the lower end of the Pomme DeTerre River Basin.  Poor water clarity, lack of aquatic vegetation, and degraded aquatic habitat havebeen described in lake survey reports since the initial survey in 1947.  Walleye gillnet catches averaged 16.0 fish/net in 1994.  Gillnet catches have ranged from  8.5 to 13.5fish/net in previous surveys dating back to 1979.  The normal range of mean catch rates from lakes withsimilar physical and chemical characteristics is 2.3 - 17.8 fish/gillnet.  Age-1 and age-2 fishcomprised 88% of the fish captured in gillnets in 1994.  Size structure of the walleye population isreflective of this age class distribution.  Mean weight of fish captured was 0.9 pounds.  Growth ofwalleye in Perkins Lake is rapid.  Age-3 fish average 17.3 inches in total length at time of capture. Both walleye fry and fingerling stockings have apparently been successful in producing correspondingyear classes, however the strong 1993 year class (age-1 fish) is the result of natural reproduction. Northern pike abundance is low as in past surveys.  Two fish were captured in gillnets which equatesto a catch rate of 0.3 fish/net.  Catch rates have ranged from 0.7 to 2.3 fish/net in previous surveysdating back to 1979.  The normal range of mean catch rates for similar lakes is 1.5 - 9.0 fish/net. Bluegill abundance is also limited.  Trapnet catches averaged 3.3 fish/net.  Historical catch rateshave ranged from 0.3 - 8.8 fish/trapnet.  Most of the bluegill present in Perkins Lake are largeindividuals.  Approximately 80% of the fish are 6 inches in length or greater and 30% exceed 8 inches. Mean weight of fish captured was 0.4 pounds.  Low bluegill density results in a rapid growth rate inPerkins Lake.  Black crappie trapnet catches averaged 1.8 fish/net.  Mean weight of fish captured was0.6 pounds.  Trapnet catches have ranged from 1.0 - 8.9 fish/net in previous surveys dating back to1979.  The highest catch rate of 8.9 fish/net was recorded in 1989 when age-1 fish comprised over 80%of the fish captured.  Occasional strong year classes are typical of black crappie populations in theselake types.  Yellow perch gillnet catches averaged 15.5 fish/net.  Gillnet catches have ranged from 1.0to 21.5 fish/net in previous surveys dating back to 1979.  The normal range of mean catch rates forsimilar lakes is 2.5 - 25.8 fish/gillnet.  Mean weight of fish captured was 0.2 pounds.  Bullheadgillnet catch rate decreased from 106.8 fish/net in 1989 to 8.5 fish/net in 1994.  Catches ranged from50.0 to 139.8 fish/gillnet in previous surveys dating back to 1979.  Mean weight of fish captured in1994 was 0.7 pounds.  There is no apparent explanation for the decline in bullhead abundance. Commercial removal of bullheads between 1989 and 1994 was limited.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Perkins Lake is a 516-acre shallow impoundment of the Pomme de Terre River. It is approximately nine miles north of Morris. The existing dam creating the pool within the river was constructed by Works Progress Administration crews in 1938. A public access site is located on the southwest shore just north of the Donnelly Rod & Gun Club park facility. Maximum depth is 13.0 feet and average depth is estimated as 8.0 feet. Low water clarity limits coverage and diversity of aquatic vegetation within the lake. Due to high fertility of the water fish grow rapidly and Perkins Lake can provide good fishing opportunities.  Primary management efforts on Perkins Lake are directed towards Walleye. Natural reproduction sustains a large proportion of this population and Walleye fry are stocked every other year to supplement the population. <br> \n <br> \nA fisheries survey was completed on Perkins Lake, June 12-15, 2023. A combination of six gill nets and nine trap nets were used to sample the fish community. Netting was preceded by electrofishing on May 30 to gain estimates of Largemouth Bass abundance and population size structure. The Walleye catch rate (10.2 fish/gill net) was above average for similar lakes in Minnesota. Lengths ranged from 13.0-26.5 inches. Average size was 17.3 inches and 1.9 pounds. Walleye grow fast in Perkins Lake, reaching 15 inches by age 3. Survival of young Walleye has been above average recently and multiple year classes were present from both stocked and non-stocked years. Walleye fry are stocked in odd-numbered years to supplement natural reproduction, but in the last several surveys, it appears naturally reproduced fish make up a majority of the population. Northern Pike abundance is low. Average size was 22.9 inches and the largest pike observed was 28.0 inches. Perkins Lake supports both Black and White Crappie. Black Crappie are more common than White Crappie. Many of the Black Crappie caught in this survey were large, average length was 11.1 inches and the largest crappie was 13.5 inches. Bluegill catches continued to be high for Perkins Lake. High Bluegill catches in the last 2 surveys are a result of a very large 2015 year class. Bluegill from this year class are now 8 years old and averaged 10.1 inches. Spring electrofishing efforts caught only a few Largemouth Bass. Low water made electrofishing difficult and habitat conditions were less than ideal for bass. Only four Largemouth Bass were observed. Yellow Perch abundance was also low for Perkins Lake. Perch occasionally get large enough to keep, but the few observed in this survey averaged 5.5 inches. <br> \n <br> \nAbundance of most underutilized species declined from the previous survey. Abundance of Black Bullhead, Common Carp, and White Sucker was much lower than the previous survey. Freshwater Drum is one species that has been increasing. First recorded in the 2012 survey, they are now abundant. Freshwater Drum are native to the Pomme de Terre River system, but have only recently been recorded in lakes above Crissy Dam in Morris, MN. They are thought to have expanded above Crissy Dam in 2012 during flood conditions.  <br> \n <br> \nPerkins Lake was designated as an infested water after the discovery of zebra mussels in 2018. Recreational users should take necessary precautions to prevent the further spread of invasive species. Drain all water and remove all aquatic vegetation from your boat and trailer when leaving any body of water. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Walleye gillnet catches averaged 13.5 fish/net night. Mean weight of the walleye captured was 2.32 lbs/fish. Walleye PSD was 98.0 percent. This high value and relatively large average size is the result of establishment of strong year classes in 1984, 1985, and 1986 and very rapid growth. Age 3 Walleye average 16.2 inches in length while age 4 and 5 fish averaged 17.5 and 20.8 inches in total length, respectively. There is a strong correlation between year class strength and Walleye stocking. The 1984 and 1986 year classes are the result of fry stockings. The 1985 year class is probably the result of a fingerling stocking. Although they may not be fully vulnerable to netting efforts, there appears to be a fairly weak 1987 year class. No stocking occurred in 1987. Northern Pike abundance has always been quite low. Thermal stress may be a limiting factor Yellow Perch numbers have increased from previous surveys. Size distribution has also increased. Forty-four percent of Yellow Perch captured measured over 9.0 inches in length and could contribute to the sport fishery. Water turbidity and lack of submerged vegetation may favor Black Crappie as the dominant Centrarchid species. Trap net catches averaged 8.9 fish/trap net. Growth rates are fast with age 3 Black Crappies averaging 9.8 inches in total length. The length frequency distribution suggests adequate recruitment to catchable size. One White Crappie was captured for the first time in the 1989 survey. A stocking of 10,500 adult Bluegill in 1980 temporarily created a pulse or increase in catch rates. The 1980 assessment yielded a catch of 8.75 fish/trap net night. All other assessments had catches less than 1.0 fish/trap net night. Although most Bullhead appear to be too small for commercial value, these species along with Carp, White Suckers, and Bigmouth Buffalo should be commercially exploited.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Perkins Lake is a shallow, turbid lake located on the Pomme de Terre River in Stevens County. Poor water quality, lack of submerged aquatic vegetation, and degraded aquatic habitat has been described in lake survey reports since the initial survey in 1947.  The river transports excessive amounts of nutrients and sediments through the lake from a very expansive and predominately cultivated watershed area.  High total phosphorous and total suspended solid concentrations have been documented in annual water quality monitoring conducted by the Perkins Lake Association.  Water transparency during the 2012 assessment was 3.0 feet.  Blue-green algae blooms are common in July and August due to elevated nitrogen concentrations.  <br> \n <br> \nPreceding fish population assessments were conducted in August.  The 2012 fish population assessment was rescheduled to occur in June in order to complete surveys on non infested basins before surveys are conducted in AIS infested waters.   Scheduling changes can result in substantial increases or decreases in catch rates and size distribution of gamefish in response to seasonal habitat changes such as water temperature differences, aquatic plant coverage and diversity, or thermal stratification of the water column.  Projected impacts of changing the survey date from August to mid-June included a lower walleye catch rate,  but greater catches of northern pike, largemouth bass, bluegills, black and white crappies;and yellow perch.  Anticipated changes in catch rates were realilzed for some gamefishes.  Threre proved to be sufficient changes in capture rates of walleye and northern pike by survey timing to preclude utilization of 2012 catch statistics in trend analyses. <br> \n <br> \nBluegills are not abundant in Perkins Lake due to limiting habitat conditions, thus the survey timing change had little impact of catch rates.  Though not abundant, bluegills grow fast.  Most bluegill captures exceeded 8.0 inches in length. <br> \n <br> \nSight-feeding, ambush predators such as largemouth bass and northern pike face difficult feeding condition and other harsh habitat conditons that limit abundance.  Only seven largemmouth bass were captured during the spring electrofishing survey.  All were young fish.  As projected, the greatest gillnet catch rate of 3.0-pike/net occurred during the June 2012 survey.  Pike captures averaged 19.4 inches.  The largest caught measured 29.8 inches. <br> \n <br> \nPerkins Lake in the Pomme de Terre River supports a naturally recruiting walleye population.  Supplemental fry stockings are programmed in odd-numbered years to sustain greater walleye abundance and a more consistent fishery.   Walleye catch rates among surveys completed in August average an exceptional 14.0 walleyes/gillnet.  Gillnet catches during thte June 2012 survey averaged only 2.8 fish/net.  The population sample was comprised of relatively young walleyes.  Captures averaged 15.7 inches in length and 1.5 pounds.  No 20.0-inch and larger walleyes common in preceding surveys were recorded in the total walleye catch.  It can be assumed that walleye are more abundant than characterized by 2012 survey findings. <br> \n <br> \nBoth black and white crappies exist in Perkins Lake.   White crappie captures outnumber black crappies.  Catch rates of both species exceeded average catches for lakes similar to Perkins Lake.  White crappie catches were elevated in response to establishment of a strong year class in 2006.  This population offers good fishing, since cohorts of the 2006 year class are 10.0 inches and larger.  The largest white crappie captured measured 13.9 inches in length.  Black crappie abundance is bouyed by a strong year class established in 2010.  Cohorts of this age class should grow to exceed 10.0 inches in length in 2013. <br> \n <br> \nContrary to expectations, fewer yellow perch were captured during the 2012 survey than the seven preceding surveys.  Gillnet catches averaged 6.3 perch/net.  Lower catches is concerning since yellow perch grow large enough to add to the fishery.  Eighteen percent of perch captured during the 2012 survey exceeded 10.0 inches in length.   <br> \n <br> \nDue to limiting habitat conditions for various gamefishes, underutilized or roughfish species constitute much of the lake's carrying capacity.  Black bullhead and white sucker comprised over 65% of the poundage of all fish caught in gillnets.  Opportunities exist to catch fishes more common to river systems.  Survey catches included bigmouth buffalo, river redhorse, shorthead redhorse, and freshwater drum. <br> \n</p>",
