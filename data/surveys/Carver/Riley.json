Northern pike are very abundant and over half of the fish handled during the survey exceeded 25 inches in length. Only one largemouth bass was sampled during netting, but 23 were sampled electrofishing. They averaged 10.2 inches in length. Bluegills are very abundant in this lake. Nearly 20% of the bluegills netted were larger than 7 inches. Walleyes are present in good numbers in this lake from private stocking and movement from Susan Lake through Riley Creek. Walleyes sampled in the gillnets averaged 16.0 inches in length. Yellow perch are also abundant, but average only about 6.6 inches in length. Carp and black bullhead are present in abundant numbers. White sucker and yellow bullhead are also present, but in much lower numbers.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Several species provide fishing opportunities in Riley Lake.  Northern pike are abundant (11.2 per gill net), and their numbers have increased from 1999 when the number per gill net was 7.5.  Size was similar to the 1999 survey with fish averaging 23 inches long and 3.4 lbs.  Pike up to 39 inches were sampled.  The Riley Lake Association funds walleye fingerling stocking, which has occurred annually from 1997-2004.  The number of walleye per gill net in 1999 was 4.5 compared to 3.3 during this survey.  Walleyes captured during this survey were bigger than in 1999.  Average length and weight in 1999 was 16 inches and 1.9 lbs., respectively, and average length and weight in 2005 was 19 inches and 2.6 lbs., respectively.  Fish close to 24 inches were sampled.  Bluegill catch in trap nets during this survey (61 per net) was down from the 1999 survey (97 per net).  Bluegill size is similar with fish surveyed in 2005 averaging 6.4 inches long and 0.23 lb.  Most bluegill are 6-7.5 inches long, but several bluegill 8-8.5 inches were also sampled.  Black crappie catch in trap nets also declined from the 1999 survey.  In 1999, 65 black crappies per trap net were sampled whereas only 12.5 per trap net were sampled during this survey.  Size appears to have remained the same.  Black crappies in 1999 averaged 7.5 inches and 0.22 lb. and black crappies in 2005 averaged 8.1 inches and 0.28 lb.  Black crappies reaching almost 11 inches were sampled.  The yellow perch population appears to be similar to 1999.  Gill net catches in 1999 averaged 30 perch per net and gill net catches in 2005 averaged 27 perch per net.  Size was also similar with fish sampled in 2005 having a mean length of 6.5 inches and a mean weight of 0.12 lb.  No perch over 8.5 inches was sampled.  Black bullheads were not sampled near as frequently as in the 1999 survey.  Gill net catches declined from 15 per net to less than 2 per net in 2005.  Size has slightly increased from 8.8 inches mean length in 1999 to 9.9 inches mean length in 2005.Other species sampled in minimal abundance were largemouth bass (4 captured), common carp (5 captured), pumpkinseeds (3 captured), white suckers (19 captured), and yellow bullheads (18 captured).</p>",

Lake Riley provides abundant recreational opportunities.  Fishing and boating are very popular.  Beaches provide swimming opportunities and a fishing pier is located on the eastern shore.  Water quality in Lake Riley is good, compared to other West Metro lakes.  By late summer most species of fish cannot inhabit water deeper than 18 feet for extended periods of time.  Anglers should keep this in mind when pursuing walleye and northern pike.  Fishing in water deeper than 18 feet in mid to late summer could yield very few fish.  Boaters should also keep in mind that new state laws require the drain plug be removed while traveling on public roadways.    <br> \n <br> \nThe predator community in Lake Riley is typical of many Minnesota lakes.  Stocking of walleye occurs.  Fingerlings are purchased by the Lake Riley Association.  Walleye average length was 19.7 inches.  Average weight was 2.67 pounds.  Abundance was in the average range for this type of lake.  Walleye mean weight was above average.  Northern pike numbers were within the historic average for Lake Riley.  Compared to similar lakes, northern pike abundance is very high.  Average length was 24.0 inches.  In the 2011 population assessment largemouth bass abundance increased slightly compared to past surveys, but is average for lakes similar to Riley.  Average length was 12.3 inches. Standard lake survey gear does not consistently provide an accurate estimate of largemouth bass abundance. <br> \n <br> \nFive species of panfish are present in Lake Riley.  Black crappie abundance is below average.  Very few large fish were sampled.  Average length was 7.3 inches.  Bluegill abundance decreased slightly compared to the 2005 survey, but stayed within the historic range.  Abundance remains above average compared to other lakes.  Over 70% of sampled bluegill were 6 inches or larger.  Less than 1% were 8 inches.  Yellow perch abundance in Lake Riley is average.  Mean weight of yellow perch was above average.  Average length was 6.9 inches.  Pumpkinseed were sampled at a low abundance.  Hybrid sunfish and golden shiner were also sampled.   <br> \n <br> \nRough fish are present.   Common carp abundance increased slightly since the 2005 survey, but remains below average for this class of lakes.  Black bullhead were also sampled at as abundance well below the historic average for Lake Riley.  Yellow bullhead were sampled at an all-time high for this lake. Overall, yellow bullhead is above average compared to similar lakes.  White sucker are present in low numbers, but average weight is high.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A survey of nearshore fish species was conducted on July 7, 2015 by IBI Program Staff. The survey consisted of 10 sampling stations evenly spaced around the lake. Backpack electrofishing was completed at 9 stations, a 50-foot seine was used at 9 stations, and 1 station was sampled with a 15-foot seine. Backpack electrofishing could not be completed a one station because of its proximity to an active swimming area. Nearshore sampling captured 10 species of fish, which included no intolerant species and 2 tolerant species (Black Bullhead and Fathead Minnow). <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore fish survey data was combined with gill net and trap net data from a June 2015 survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based Index of Biotic Integrity (FIBI) score based on expectations for similar lakes. Lake Riley scored poorly with the FIBI compared to a threshold developed for similar lakes. The low score was driven by the low diversity of small benthic dwelling species, the low relative abundance of small benthic dwelling individuals captured, and the low relative abundance of intolerant individuals in the nearshore gear.  <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to a watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.  Lake Riley is located in the Lower Minnesota River Watershed.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Riley is a 296-acre lake with a maximum depth of 49 feet.  The lake is located west of Eden Prairie, and Walleye are stocked each year by the lake association.  During the summer of 2021, water clarity was neither extremely high nor extremely low, and the lake held good levels of dissolved oxygen to a depth of 32 feet.  Zebra mussels and Eurasian watermilfoil are present in Riley.   <br> \n <br> \nIn 2021, a special regulation for Bluegill and Crappie was implemented; anglers are now allowed to harvest only 5 fish of each species.  The goal of the regulation is to reduce harvest of panfish so that they can live longer and grow to a larger size.  A Standard Survey was conducted during the summer of 2021 to assess the gamefish populations.   <br> \n <br> \nWalleye were caught in low numbers in 2021, and a broad range of sizes of fish were present.  Annual Walleye stocking by the lake association began in 2015, and the fish in the 2021 survey give a snapshot of the population that those efforts have established.  Fish lengths were between 9 and 26 inches, with an average of 18 inches.  The presence of smaller fish shows that recent stockings have been successful.  Although not highly abundant, Walleye are persisting in the lake. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike were sampled in high numbers in 2021, and fish size was good.  Lengths were between 18 and 39 inches, with an average of 27 inches.  A lot of the fish were in the 22 to 26 inch protected slot, and 40% of the catch exceeded 26 inches.  Riley should provide quality Northern Pike fishing for both catch and release and harvest angling.   <br> \n <br> \nBluegill were moderately abundant and tended to be smaller in size.  Fish lengths were between 2 and 8 inches, with a 5 inch average.  Since Bluegill were not highly abundant in Riley, competition for food should not limit their growth.  With a reduction in harvest from the new 5 fish possession limit, these fish will hopefully live longer, and attain greater size. It takes a Bluegill 8 years to reach 8 inches in Riley.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie were caught in low numbers, but size was good.  Fish lengths were between 5 and 11 inches, with a 7 inch average.  Twenty percent of the catch were larger than 9 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nYellow Bullhead were highly abundant in 2021. Fish lengths were between 8 and 12 inches, with a 10 inch average.   <br> \n <br> \nOther fishes caught in low abundance included Black Bullhead, Brown Bullhead, Largemouth Bass, Pumpkinseed, and Yellow Perch.   <br> \n</p>",

Northern Pike were sampled in relatively high numbers with some quality individuals present. Approximately one of every 6 Northern Pike sampled was 28.0 inches or longer. Largemouth bass are reported to be abundant, but did not show up in high numbers during this survey. Walleye are present even though they have never been stocked. It is suspected that walleye are migrating down Riley Creek from Susan Lake where fry have been stocked on a regular basis. Bluegill, pumpkinseed sunfish, and black crappie were abundant in the trap net samples with some quality size fish present in the population. Almost 1/3 of the bluegill captured were 7.0 inches or longer. Although 3 species of bullhead are present in the lake, black bullhead are the most abundant. Carp and white suckers are also present in above average abundance.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Riley is a 296-acre Class 24 lake with a maximum depth of 49 feet.  The lake is located in Carver County, northeast of Chanhassen, MN.  Stocking of Riley is funded by the lake association. Walleye fingerlings were stocked from 1997-2002, in 2004, 2006-2008, 2010 and 2015.  (The 2015 stocking occurred after this survey was conducted.)  Yellow Perch were stocked in 2012.  Lake Riley is primarily managed for Northern Pike and Largemouth Bass, and secondarily managed for Bluegill. In 2015, a Standard Survey was conducted to assess the gamefish populations.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike were highly abundant in 2015; the catch rate of 17.5 fish per gill net greatly exceeds the 75th percentile for this lake (7.3 fish per net).  Fish are of quality size; 86% of the gill-netted fish exceeded 21 inches, and 12% exceeded 28 inches.  The average Northern Pike was 24.1 inches and 3.23 pounds.  The largest fish was 36.7 inches and 10.60 pounds.   <br> \n <br> \nBluegill were moderately abundant and size tended to be small.  The catch rate of 11.4 fish per trap net falls between the 25th percentile and median for this Lake Class.  Twelve percent of the sample exceeded 7 inches, and the largest trap-netted fish was 8.3 inches.  The average Bluegill was 5.3 inches and 0.14 pounds.  <br> \n  <br> \nIn 2015, Walleye were caught at a rate of 2.0 fish per gill net.  This catch rate falls between the 25th percentile and median for Lake Class 24.  Size structure was skewed to larger individuals; all of the sampled Walleye exceeded 15 inches, and 92% exceeded 20 inches.  The average fish was 22.0 inches and 4.02 pounds.  The largest fish was 26.7 inches and 6.46 pounds.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie were caught at a rate of 1.3 per gill net, which falls below the 25th percentile for this Lake Class.  Sixty-three percent of the fish exceeded 8 inches, and the average size of gill-netted Black Crappie was 8.5 inches and 0.5 pounds.  The largest fish caught was 14.4 inches and 1.79 pounds.   <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch were moderately abundant in 2015, and size structure was skewed to small individuals.  The catch rate of 6.0 fish per gill net falls between the 25th percentile and median for this Lake Class.  Nineteen percent of the fish exceeded 8 inches, and the average size was 7.12 inches and 0.17pounds.  The largest Yellow Perch was 8.7 inches and 0.28 pounds.   <br> \n <br> \nYellow Bullhead were highly abundant in the gill nets.  The catch rate of 34.7 fish per net greatly exceeded the 75th percentile of 7.5 fish per net.  All of the sampled fish exceeded 9 inches.  The average size of Yellow Bullhead was 10.6 inches and 0.65 pounds.  The largest fish was 14.0 inches and 1.3 pounds.   <br> \n <br> \nOther fishes caught in low abundance included Black Bullhead, White Sucker, Green Sunfish, hybrid sunfish, Largemouth Bass, and Pumpkinseed.   <br> \n</p>",
