The average weight of northern pike sampled was 2.4 pounds.  Northern pike ranged from 18 to 27 inches in this assessment.  Growth was average when compared to other northern pike lakes in the area; five-year old northern pike averaged 22.6 inches at last annulus formation.   <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch were sampled in average numbers for this lake class, but the size was small, averaging 0.1 pounds.
