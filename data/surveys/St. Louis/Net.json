                "narrative": "<p>Antoinette is a 31 acre lake with 100% littoral area and a maximum depth of 8 feet. The lake is located five miles north of Duluth, MN and has no public access.  Prior to this survey, Antoinette had never been surveyed by DNR Fisheries.  Antoinette was surveyed during the summer of 2014 to gather baseline information about fish populations and aquatic habitat.   <br> \n <br> \nNo game fish were captured during the survey as the fish community is dominated by mostly native minnow species.  The fish community of Antoinette Lake is reflective of a lake that is subject to winter oxygen stress.  The lake likely experiences hypoxic (< 2 ppm dissolved oxygen) conditions during severe winters, limiting game fish populations.  In addition, connectivity to other water-bodies is poor, but trout from Amity Creek may occasionally use the lake when not blocked by beaver dams.  Antoinette Lake has been used as a walleye rearing pond in the past and Brook Trout have been captured as by-catch. <br> \n <br> \nWhite Sucker abundance of 2.5 per gillnet lift was average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Average length of gillnet captured White Sucker was 11.2 inches.  White Sucker trapnet abundance of 4.8 per lift was above average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type and mean length was 10.7 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nInformation was also collected on aquatic vegetation.  Twenty-six aquatic plant species or species groups were identified along 92 survey points.  Watershield, common bladderwort, large-leaf pondweed, narrow-leaf pondweed group and northern milfoil were the most frequently found plants (67%, 58%, 52%, 38% and 35% respectively). All other plants were found in low abundance with less than 10% frequency of occurrence.</p>",
