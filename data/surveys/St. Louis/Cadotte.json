Very strong young and old year classes are present with or without stocking.  Had the lake not been stocked in 1986, 1984 or 1982 and no natural reproduction occureed these years, the 1989 catch rate still would have been 13.7.  This compares to a state-wide median of 3.6 and a local median of 7.1 for this lake type.    Yellow perch levels are also high at 61.5 per gill net lift.  Their trend has been increasing throughout the assessment history.  The average size has also been increasing although scale accuracy over the years certainly is questionable.       White sucker and panfish remain at or below index medians with no discernible trends.</p>",

Bluegill were first noted in 1976 and remain below the first quartile for this lake class.  Catch per unit of effort of yellow perch has declined dramatically since 1989, yet remains above the third quartile for lake class 10.  Yellow perch show one of the fastest growth rates for the Duluth area with 63% of the sample being longer than 10 inches.  The CPUE for walleye has declined along with the yellow perch.  The number per lift of 12.8 remains above the third quartile for this lake class and is near the goal of 8 per gillnet lift as stated in the Lake Management Plan.  The decline in number per lift may be influenced more by number of perch than any other factor.  18% of the sample was longer than 15 inches and the mean length has remained fairly constant at 13.4 inches.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Cadotte Lake is a 325 acre lake with 230 (71%) littoral acres and a maximum depth of 18 feet. The lake is located near Fairbanks, MN and lies within the Superior National Forest. The public access is located on the west side of the lake through the U.S. Forest Service campground.  Walleye is the primary management species and yellow perch is the secondary management species. Cadotte was last surveyed in 2003.  Cadotte was assessed during the summer of 2011 to update information about fish populations.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance of 18.2 per gillnet lift was up from 2003 (14.1) and above average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Walleye average length was 14.6 inches and growth was slow compared to other Duluth Area lakes.  All year-classes from 2001 through 2010 were represented with strong 2006 and 2009 year-classes.  One other specimen was captured from the 1995 year-class.  In conjunction with the Fond du Lac Band of Lake Superior Chippewa, a walleye population estimate was derived.  The estimate was 5,390 walleyes greater than 10 inches in Cadotte Lake.   <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch abundance of 54.1 per gillnet lift was up from 2003 (21.8) and was above average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Yellow perch average length was 7.5 inches and growth was fast compared to other Duluth Area lakes.  All year-classes from 2004 through 2010 were represented.  Two other older perch were captured, one from 1997 and the other from the 2001 year-class. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike abundance of 0.9 per gillnet lift was up from 2003 (0.4) and below average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Northern pike average length was 24.8 inches but not enough individuals were sampled to evaluate stock density or growth.  All year-classes from 2006 to 2009 were represented. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill abundance of 0.8 per trapnet lift was up from 2003 (0.7) and was below average when compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Average length of sampled bluegills was 4.6 inches but not enough individuals were sampled to evaluate stock density or growth.  Bluegill from the 2003, 2007 and 2010 year-classes were sampled.     <br> \n <br> \nOne small largemouth bass (4.9 inches) was sampled with electrofishing equipment.  The catch rate of largemouth bass was 1.5 fish per hour of electrofishing on-time.  No prior largemouth bass electrofishing assessments have been conducted on Cadotte Lake.  One other 7.8 inch largemouth bass was captured in a trapnet.  Not enough individuals were captured to evaluate stock density or growth.  Largemouth bass had not been sampled in any of the last nine investigations since 1958.   <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species sampled include burbot, Iowa darter, Johnny darter, mottled sculpin, common shiner, golden shiner, pumpkinseed and white sucker. <br> \n <br> \nCadotte Lake was included in an index of biotic integrity (IBI) assessment in 2011.  In addition to standard gillnets and trapnets, beach seines and backpack electrofishing equipment were used to index species richness of the nearshore lake habitat. <br> \n</p>",

The lake is located near Fairbanks, MN and lies within the Superior National Forest. The public access is located on the west side of the lake and is near a U.S. Forest Service campground.  Walleye is the primary management species and Yellow Perch is the secondary management species.  Cadotte was last surveyed in 2011.  Cadotte was surveyed during the summer of 2020 to update information about fish populations.  <br> \n <br> \nThe Walleye reproduce naturally in Cadotte and the lake has not been stocked since 1986.  Walleye abundance of 9.9 per gillnet lift was down from 2011 (18.2) but still above average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Walleye average length was 14.6 inches and growth was average compared to other Duluth Area lakes.  The proportion of adult Walleye captured that exceeded quality size (greater than 15 inches) was 29%.  Back to back strong year-classes were evident from 2016 and 2017 but representation from the 2013 through 2015 year-classes was poor.  <br> \n <br> \nIn addition to Walleye, Cadotte Lake offers quality angling opportunities for Yellow Perch.  Yellow Perch abundance of 20.1 per gillnet lift was down from 2011 (54.1) but still above average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Yellow Perch average length was 7.7 inches and growth was fast compared to other Duluth Area lakes.  The proportion of adult Yellow Perch captured that exceeded preferred size (greater than 10 inches) was 21%.  Bluegill were scarce and small and no Black Crappies were captured.     <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike abundance of 1.4 per gillnet lift was up from 2011 (0.9) and average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Northern Pike average length was 25.1 inches and one large specimen was captured that exceeded 42 inches in length.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Cadotte Lake is a 325 acre lake with 230 (71%) littoral acres and a maximum depth of 18 feet.  The lake is located near Fairbanks, MN and lies within the Superior National Forest.  The public access is located on the west side of the lake through the U.S. Forest Service campground.  Walleye is the primary management species and yellow perch is the secondary management species.    Walleye abundance was 14.1 fish/gillnet.  Historically, walleye catch rates ( > 12 fish/gillnet) have been above average for Minnesota lakes of similar type.  The mean length of age 4 fish was 13.8 inches which represents average growth for Duluth Area lakes.  The mean length was 13.1 inches, an increase from 12.6 inches in 1995.  Nine age classes (age 1-9) were present in the assessment with strong representation from the age 2 fish (27% of the catch).    Yellow perch abundance was 21.8 fish/gillnet.  This was above average for Minnesota lakes of similar type and reflected a historical trend of high yellow perch catch rates.  Growth was fast for Duluth Area lakes with a mean length of age 4 fish being 9.4 inches.  The mean length of fish increased from 8.1 inches in 1995 to 10.4 inches in 2003.  Eight age classes (ages 1-8) were present with strong representation from age 2 and age 6 fish, 32% and 20% of the catch, respectively.    White sucker gillnet abundance was 5.1 fish/gillnet.  This was a decrease from 10.8 fish/gillnet in 1995 and was average for Minnesota lakes of similar type.    Other species sampled during the assessment included bluegill, black crappie and common shiner.  Cadotte Lake has a simple, but productive fishery.  Walleye and yellow perch catch rates continue to be above average for Duluth Area lakes and due to high water clarity and submerged structures present a challenge to anglers.  The abundance of various sizes of yellow perch indicate that they can provide forage to walleye was well as another target species for anglers.    </p>",
