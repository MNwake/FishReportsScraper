Park Rapids Fisheries staff conducted a survey targeting near shore fish species on July 20, 2023, to assess populations of non-game and small sport fish.  Ten 100-foot sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake shore, sampling a variety of habitat types.  Each site was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot 1/8th-inch mesh seine, depending on habitat conditions.   <br> \n <br> \nDuring this assessment, five sites were sampled with a 15-foot seine.  Site conditions prevented the use of seines at five sites.  Backpack electrofishing was done at all 10 sites with three being conducted from the side of the boat.  Nearshore sampling captured nine species of fish including a species intolerant of disturbance; Banded Killifish.  Other species sampled during the nearshore effort included Bluegill, Central Mudminnow, Green Sunfish, hybrid sunfish, Iowa Darter, Largemouth Bass, Pumpkinseed, and Yellow Perch.  Nearshore catches will be used along with gill net and trap net catch data from a standard fisheries survey conducted on July 31, 2023 to calculate a fish-based Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) score, which is indicative of the health of Hattie Lake.   <br> \n <br> \nThis survey is contributing to a watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.  Hattie Lake is located in the Mississippi River - Headwaters Watershed. <br> \n</p>",

Hattie Lake has a surface area of 259 acres and a maximum depth of 39 feet.  There is a public access on the east shore of the lake.  Anglers will find good populations of northern pike, largemouth bass, panfish, as well as a bonus walleye population. <br> \n <br> \nThe Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics.  Hattie is in lake class 31.  Other area lakes in this same classification include: Boulder, Fifth through Eighth Crow Wing Lakes, and Evergreen. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike were sampled in moderate numbers (6.1 pike/gillnet), within the range \"typical\" for this lake class and similar to past surveys.  While larger northern pike are present, the sample was dominated by small \"hammer handle\" pike.  Sampled northern pike had an average length and weight of 19.1 inches and 1.6 pounds.  Northern pike growth rates were slow when compared to other class 31 lakes.  The northern pike population in Hattie is limited by moderate to high recruitment of young pike and slow growth rates. <br> \n <br> \nHattie supports good panfish and largemouth bass populations.  Anglers can expect to find bluegill and pumpkinseed in the 6-8 inch range and black crappie in the 9-10 inch range.  Anglers have reported good largemouth bass fishing with bass of all sizes caught. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance (1.6 walleye/gillnet) was at the low end of the range \"typical\" for this lake class, similar to recent surveys.  Hattie is stocked annually with walleye fry (80,000 fry). <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled included moderate numbers of hybrid sunfish, and low numbers of rock bass and white sucker. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Hattie Lake is located 5 miles north of Lake George, MN in northern Hubbard County. Hattie has a surface area of 359 acres and a maximum depth of 39 feet. A Department of Natural Resources (DNR) owned public access is located on the east shore of the lake. The Minnesota DNR has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics. Hattie Lake is in lake class 31. Class 31 lakes generally have hard water and are regularly shaped. Other class 31 lakes in the Park Rapids area include: Boulder; Evergreen; and Fifth, Sixth, Seventh and Eighth Crow Wing Lakes. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance was low but consistent in previous years, but dropped further in 2016. The few walleyes that were sampled were larger, from 17-24.5 inches. Yellow Perch are important forage for Walleyes and Northern Pike, and their numbers were in line with other class 31 lakes. Perch had an average size of 6.5 inches and were sampled up to 9.5 inches. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike abundance was similar to class 31 lakes, and on the high end of past surveys of Hattie. Pike ranged from 12 inches to 30 inches in length.  The average size of 18.5 inches and 1.4 pounds were in line with past surveys. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass were sampled in high numbers compared to class 31 lakes, and on the high end of past surveys of Hattie.  Fish ranged from 6.5 to 16 inches, with fish spread out evenly over this range. <br> \n <br> \nAngling opportunities for panfish include Black Crappie, Bluegill and Pumpkinseed. Black Crappie numbers were in line with lake class 31 lakes, and most crappies were 8-10 inches. Bluegills and Pumpkinseeds were sampled in higher numbers compared to recent years, with most fish 4.5-7.5 inches long. <br> \n <br> \nCurrently, no Aquatic Invasive Species (AIS) have been identified in Hattie Lake. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Hattie Lake is a 259 acre lake located five miles northwest of Lake George in northern Hubbard County.Walleye were sampled in low numbers at 1.7/gillnet, which is lower than the two previous surveys: 4.0/gillnet in 1990 and 3.5/gillnet in 1985.  Size of walleye was large, with an average length of 20.5 inches and 3.2 lbs, with fish measured up to 28.0 inches.  Hattie Lake was stocked with walleye fingerlings in 1987, 1989, and 1991.  Walleyes have not been stocked since 1991, so stocking and natural reproduction success could be evaluated.  Of the walleyes sampled in the 1995 survey, 56% correspond to years of walleye stocking.  Natural reproduction has not produced a strong year class in the last several years.  Only one small walleye (9.1 inches) from natural reproduction was sampled during the 1995 survey. Hattie Lake has been know for having an abundant northern pike population, and the 1995 survey was no different, with a gillnet catch of 7.9/net.  The previous survey in 1990 had a similar gillnet catch, while the catch in 1985 was higher at 15.0/gillnet.  Average size of the northern pike was small; 19.5 inches and 1.9 lbs.  However, large northern pike were present, with 14% of the sample 25.0 inches or larger and with fish measured up to 33.9 inches.Bluegill were sampled in high numbers at 35.0/trapnet.  The bluegill trapnet catch has been increasing from past surveys; 25.0/net in 1990 and 14.4/net in 1985.  Size of bluegills was fair, with an average length of 6.1 inches and with 14% of the sample 7.0 inches or larger.  Bluegill were sampled up to 8.1 inches.Standard survey gear (gillnets and trapnets) are usually not effective in evaluation of black crappie and largemouth bass populations, but some general inferences can be made.  Black crappie were sampled in low numbers, similar to past surveys.  Largemouth bass were sampled in moderate numbers, similar to past surveys, with fish measured up to 14.4 inches.Three species of bullhead are found in Hattie Lake: yellow bullhead, black bullhead, and brown bullhead.  Yellow bullhead were sampled in moderate numbers (5.6/gillnet).  The previous survey in 1990 had a higher gillnet catch (8.5/net), while no yellow bullhead were sampled in 1985.  Black bullhead were sampled in moderate numbers (3.3/gillnet), down from the 1990 catch of 14.5/gillnet.  Brown bullhead were sampled in low numbers (0.6/gillnet).  Previous catches of brown bullhead have been higher; 2.3/gillnet in 1990 and 2.5/gillnet in 1985.Yellow perch were sampled in moderate numbers (16.1/gillnet).  The previous survey in 1990 had a similar catch of 17.0/gillnet, while the catch was higher in 1985 at 43.0/gillnet.  Yellow perch were small in size with an average length of 7.3 inches.  Yellow perch provide a forage base for the walleye and northern pike populations and are too small to be an acceptable size for the anglers.Pumpkinseed, rock bass, and tullibee (cisco) were sampled in low numbers.  Hybrid sunfish were sampled in moderate numbers at 5.0/trapnet.</p>",

Hattie Lake has a surface area of 259 acres and a maximum depth of 39 feet.  There is a public access on the east shore of the lake.  Anglers will find good populations of northern pike, largemouth bass, and panfish, as well as a bonus walleye population.The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical and chemical characteristics.  Hattie Lake is in class 31.  Other area lakes in this same classification include: Boulder, Fifth through Eighth Crow Wing Lakes, and Evergreen.Northern pike were sampled in moderate numbers (5.3 pike/gillnet), within the range \"typical\" for this lake class and  similar to past surveys.  While larger northern pike are present, the sample was dominated by small \"hammer handle\" pike.  Sampled northern pike had an average length and weight of 17.6 inches and 1.3 pounds.  Northern pike growth rates were very slow when compared to other class 31 lakes.  The northern pike population in Hattie is limited by moderate to high recruitment of young pike and very slow growth rates.Hattie supports good panfish and largemouth bass populations.  Anglers can expect to find bluegill in the 6-7 inch range and black crappie in the 9-10 inch range common.  Anglers have reported good largemouth bass fishing with bass of all sizes caught.Walleye were sampled in low numbers (1.3 walleye/gillnet), at the low end of the range \"typcial\" for this lake class and below the current management goal of 4.0 walleye/gillnet.  Past surveys have shown the walleye abudance was also low in the 1995 survey, while surveys in 1985 and 1990 had walleye catch rates near or at the management goal (4.0 walleye/gillnet).  Hattie was stocked  with walleye fingerlings in odd numbered years from 1987 to 1991 then switched over to walleye fry in even numbered years starting in 1998.  Further evaluation is needed to see if walleye fry stocking and limited natural reproduction is successful at reaching and maintaining the current walleye management goal.Other species sampled included very high numbers of yellow bullhead and moderate numbers of yellow perch and pumpkinseed. Brown bullhead, black bullhead, hybrid sunfish, and rock bass were sampled in low numbers.</p>",

Hattie has a surface area of 359 acres and a maximum depth of 39 feet.  There is a state-owned public access located on the east shore of the lake.  Anglers will find good populations of Largemouth Bass, Bluegill, Northern Pike, Black Crappie, as well as a bonus Walleye population. <br> \n <br> \nThe Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics.  Hattie is in lake class 31.  Class 31 lakes generally have hard water and a regularly shaped shoreline.  Other class 31 lakes in the Park Rapids management area include Boulder, Evergreen, and Fifth, Sixth, Seventh, and Eighth Crow Wing lakes. <br> \n <br> \nHattie supports good populations of Largemouth Bass and panfish.  Anglers have reported good Largemouth Bass fishing with bass of all sizes caught.   <br> \n <br> \nGood numbers of Bluegill, Pumpkinseed, and Black Crappie were sampled. However, the size of panfish ran small with Bluegill in the 6-7 inch size range and Black Crappie in the 9-10 inch size range.   <br> \n <br> \nPresent and past surveys have shown an abundant Northern Pike population.  Sampled Northern Pike had an average length of 20.4 inches and weight of 2.2 pounds with fish measured up to 31.5 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nThe Walleye population in Hattie has fluctuated from low to moderate numbers over the years.  Walleye were sampled in low numbers in 2023 with fish ranging from 19.6 to 26.3 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch are present in moderate numbers but tend to run small for angling with most fish under 9.0 inches in length. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled included high numbers of Yellow Bullhead.  Hybrid Sunfish were sampled in moderate numbers, while Rock Bass, Tullibee (Cisco), and Brown Bullhead were sampled in low numbers. <br> \n <br> \nCurrently no aquatic invasive species (AIS) have been identified in Hattie.  To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants and animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the lake. <br> \n</p>",
