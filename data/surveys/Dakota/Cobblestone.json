The City of Apple Valley owns the entire shoreline and operates Cobblestone Lake Park.  The park provides a fishing pier, shorefishing access, playground, picnic tables, a walking path and canoe/kayak storage.  The sport fish community consists of Black Crappie, Bluegill, Green, Pumpkinseed and Hybrid Sunfish, Largemouth Bass and Walleye and Yellow Perch.  Stocking has consisted of Bluegills and Black Crappies in 2005 and 2006, Walleyes since 2005 and Yellow Perch in 2018.  A more balanced fish community has been established with the addition of Black Crappies, Largemouth Bass, Yellow Perch and Walleye. Water clarity has averaged about 3 feet for the last ten years according the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye and Largemouth Bass are the primary predator species in Cobblestone Lake.  Walleye numbers (11.0/gill net) were above average when compared to other similar lakes in Minnesota.  Sampled Walleyes ranged from 7.5 to 26.0 inches with an average length of 15.8 inches. Largemouth Bass averaged over 11.8 inches during this survey and the panfish population was dominated by Bluegill and Black Crappie in 2020.  Bluegill numbers (6.0/trap net) were down from the 2015 survey (30.0/trap net) but are still about average for lakes like Cobblestone.  Bluegill mean size was 6.0 inches with a range of 3.0 to 8.0 inches. Black Crappie catch rates in 2020 were 9.0/gill net and 1.6/trap net and about average for lakes similar to Cobblestone.  Only three Black Crappie exceeded the 9.0 inch mark. Green Sunfish numbers were low and consistent with the previous assessments. Pumpkinseed Sunfish were sampled in below average numbers for lakes like Cobblestone. Yellow Perch, sampled for the first time in Cobblestone, were found in above average abundance, with some quality fish in the population. Black Bullheads continue to be found in low abundance. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A former gravel pit, Cobblestone Lake is a 37-acre, class 36 'Fishing in the Neighborhood' (FiN) lake located at Diamond Path Road and County Road 36.  The City of Apple Valley owns the entire shoreline and operates Cobblestone Lake Park.  The park provides a fishing pier, shorefishing access, playground, picnic tables and a walking path.  The sport fish community consists of black crappie, bluegill, green sunfish, hybrid sunfish, largemouth bass, pumpkinseed sunfish, and walleye.  Bluegills and black crappies were stocked in 2005 and 2006 and walleyes have been stocked in odd numbered years since 2005.  Water clarity has increased from 1.25 feet in 2005 to 8.5 feet in 2010.  A more balanced fish community has been established with the addition of black crappies, largemouth bass and walleye.   <br> \n <br> \nWalleye and largemouth bass are the primary predator species in Cobblestone Lake.  Walleye numbers (7.0/gill net) were above average when compared to other similar lakes in Minnesota.  Sampled walleyes ranged from 14.8 to 23.1 inches and averaged approximately 2.2 pounds.  Age-5 (2005 fryling stocking) and age-3 (2007 fry stocking) walleyes comprised 88% and 12% of the population, respectively.  Although only one 16.2 inch largemouth bass was sampled by a trap net, we observed many largemouth bass below ten inches in the shallows during survey.   <br> \n <br> \nThe panfish population shifted from one dominated by hybrid sunfish in 2005 to one dominated by bluegills and black crappies in 2010.  Bluegill numbers (16.8/trap net) were up from the 2005 survey (9.2/trap net).  Of the 84 bluegills sampled using trap nets, approximately 57% were above 6.0 inches with no fish exceeding 7.5 inches.  Although no black crappies were sampled in the 2005 population assessment, 2010 gill net (13.0/net) and trap net (20.2/ net) catches were above average when compared to similar lakes in Minnesota.  No crappies exceeding 7.0 inches or age 3 were sampled.  Green sunfish numbers were low and consistent with the 2005 assessment.  Conversely, 2010 hybrid sunfish numbers (5.8/trap net) are considerably down from the 2005 assessment (51.2/trap net).  One 5.6 inch pumpkinseed sunfish was additionally sampled in a trap net.     <br> \n <br> \nBlack bullheads numbers (7.5/gill net and 19.6/trap net) are considerably down from the 2005 population assessment (147.4/gill net; 60.0/trap net).        <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A former gravel pit, Cobblestone Lake is a 37-acre, class 36 'Fishing in the Neighborhood' (FiN) lake located at Diamond Path Road and County Road 36.  The City of Apple Valley owns the entire shoreline and operates Cobblestone Lake Park.  The park provides a fishing pier, shorefishing access, playground, picnic tables, a walking path and canoe and kayak storage.  The sport fish community consists of Black Crappie, Bluegill, Green, Pumpkinseed and Hybrid Sunfish, Largemouth Bass and Walleye.  Bluegills and Black Crappies were stocked in 2005 and 2006 and Walleyes have been stocked in odd numbered years since 2005.  Water clarity has increased from 1.25 feet in 2005 to 3.2 feet in 2014.  A more balanced fish community has been established with the addition of Black Crappies, Largemouth Bass and Walleye.   <br> \nWalleye and Largemouth Bass are the primary predator species in Cobblestone Lake.  Walleye numbers (2.0/gill net) were above average when compared to other similar lakes in Minnesota.  Sampled Walleyes ranged from 12.64 to 25.0 inches with an average length of 16.9 inches.  Although only six Largemouth Bass was sampled by the gear, we observed several other Largemouth Bass below ten inches in the shallows during survey. Largemouth Bass averaged over 11 inches during this survey. <br> \nThe panfish population shifted from one dominated by Hybrid Sunfish in 2005 to one dominated by Bluegill and Black Crappie in 2015.  Bluegill numbers (30.6/trap net) were up from the 2010 survey (16.8/trap net).  Of the 167 Bluegills sampled using trap nets, approximately 80% were above 6.0 inches with no fish exceeding 7.5 inches. Bluegill mean size was 6.3 inches with a range of 4.17 to 7.1 inches. Although no Black Crappies were sampled in the 2005 population assessment, 2010 gill net (13.0/net) and trap net (20.2/ net) catches exceeded the 1st quartiles for both gear types. Black Crappie (N= 159) catch rates in 2015 were 79.0/gill net and 16.0/ trap net, which is above average when compared to similar lakes in Minnesota.  No Black Crappie exceeded 9.0 inches. Green Sunfish numbers were low and consistent with the 2005 and 2010 assessment.  Conversely, 2015 Hybrid Sunfish numbers (4.4/trap net) are considerably down from the 2005 assessment (51.2/trap net).  Pumpkinseed Sunfish were sampled in below average numbers for lakes like Cobblestone.     <br> \nBlack Bullheads numbers (6.0/gill net and 5.6/trap net) are considerably down from the 2005 and 2010 population assessments (147.4/gill net; 60.0/trap net and 7.50/gill net; 19.60/trapnet respectively).    <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

The lake is a former gravel mining pit that has been allowed to fill with groundwater and is now an amenity for the housing development built around it. Property along the shoreline is an Apple Valley Park and provides for public access to the lake for recreational purposes. Mid-way along the north shore a large 200 foot long pier is sited and designed for recreational use. A second smaller fishing pier will be located in the northeastern corner of the lake. The maximum depth found during the survey was 18 feet. The 2005 netting survey is the first fish survey conducted on Cobblestone Lake.Black bullhead were the fish sampled in the highest numbers during the survey. Some bluegill were sampled in the trapnets but were of a small average size (4.1 inches). Green sunfish were present and hybrid sunfish were sampled in high abundance. No other gamefish were sampled during this survey.</p>",
