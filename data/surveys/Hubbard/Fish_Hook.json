                "narrative": "<p>Fish Hook Lake is located just north of Park Rapids in Hubbard County.  Fish Hook has a surface area of 1,632 acres and a maximum depth of 76 feet.  There are county-owned public accesses located on the southwest shore of the lake and on the Fish Hook River south of the lake in Heartland Park.  Fish Hook is a popular lake and receives a fair amount of fishing and recreational activity year around.  The Minnesota Dept. of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical and chemical characteristics.  Fish Hook is in lake class 27.  Other area lakes in this same classification are Upper Bottle, Garfield, and Lake George. <br> \n <br> \nFish Hook is an excellent fishing lake and is known as one of the best \"multi-species\" lakes around, providing good fishing opportunites for walleye, northern pike, largemouth bass, and panfish.  Fish Hook has good water quality, bottom substrate, and aquatic vegetation that provides excellent habitat for a variety of gamefish species.  Important emergent aquatic vegetation such as hardstem bulrush are found along the southwest and north shores.  Good beds of submerged aquatic vegetation such as claspingleaf and whitestem pondweed (\"cabbage\"), coontail, and northern milfoil are common and found out to 20 foot depths. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance (7.0 walleye/gillnet) was up from past surveys and above the current management goal of 5 walleye/gillnet.  Anglers can expect to find good numbers of 16-20 inch walleye as well as larger fish up to 30 inches.  Fish Hook Lake is known as one of the better lakes in this area for the opportunity of catching a trophy walleye (30 inch plus).  Fish Hook Lake is currently stocked with walleye fingerlings during odd numbered years. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike were sampled in high numbers (10.2 pike/gillnet), above the range \"typical\" for this lake class.  Northern pike abundance in past surveys has fluctuated from moderate to high numbers.  Sampled northern pike had an average length and weight of 21.1 inches and 2.2 pounds with pike measured up to 36.2 inches. <br> \n <br> \nFish Hook has an excellent population of largemouth bass and panfish.  Largemouth bass in the 14-16 inch size range are common as well as bass up to 20 inches.  Smallmouth bass are present in low numbers.  Anglers will find good numbers of bluegill in the 7-8 inch range.  The black crappie population in Fish Hook fluctuates from low to moderate numbers.  Anglers will find black crappie in the 10-12 inch size range.  <br> \n</p>",

A DNR owned public access is located on the west shore of the lake off US-71. Access is also available from the Fish Hook River, with a county access in Heartland Park. Fish Hook is a very popular lake for fishing and recreation during the summer and winter. Fish Hook provides angling opportunities for Walleye, Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass and panfish. <br> \nThe Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics. Fish Hook is in class 27. Class 27 lakes are generally very large, deep, have very hard water and are regularly shaped. Other class 27 lakes in the work area include: Garfield, George, and Upper Bottle. <br> \nWalleye abundance was in line with recent surveys, and above the management goal. Most adult fish were spread out from 8 - 23 inches, with a strong class of 14 -16 inch Walleye for anglers. Walleye sampled had an average length of 15.5 inches with fish measuring up to 26.4 inches. Yellow Perch, an important forage species for Walleye were sampled in average numbers, but very few were large enough for anglers to target. <br> \nLargemouth Bass were sampled in good numbers again in 2022, with fish averaging just over 11 inches.  The longest Largemouth Bass sampled was 19 inches in length.  Smallmouth bass have been sampled in the past, but none were sampled in 2022. <br> \nNorthern Pike abundance was down, but still in moderate numbers for this lake class. Anglers will find most northern from 18 - 24 inches in length, with fish up to 38 inches. Northern Pike sampled had an average length of 21.7 inches and weighed 2.3 pounds. <br> \nOnly a few crappies were sampled in this survey, with the largest at 11 inches. Fish Hook also provides fishing for Bluegill and Pumpkinseed; with some nicer fish up to 8.5 inches. <br> \nCurly-leaf Pondweed is an aquatic invasive species (AIS) that has been identified in Fish Hook Lake. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Fish Hook Lake is located in southern Hubbard County just north of Park Rapids.  Fish Hook has a surface area of 1,632 acres and a maximum depth of 76 feet.  There is a county-owned public access located on the southwest shore of the lake and on the Fish Hook River south of the lake in Heartland Park.  Fish Hook lake is a popular lake and receives a fair amount of fishing and recreational activity year around.  The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical and chemical characteristics.  Fish Hook Lake is in lake class 27.  Other area lakes in this class include: Upper Bottle (11 miles northeast of Park Rapids), Garfield (north of Laporte), and Lake George (located by the town of Lake George). The walleye gillnet catch rate of 4.8/net is within the range typical for lake class 27.  Walleye gillnet catch rates have been similar in the two previous surveys: 4.2/net (1988) and 4.9/net (1992).  Historical walleye gillnet catch rates have ranged from 2.3/net (1977) to 8.7/net (1983).  Sampled walleye ranged in length from 6.8 to 25.0 inches with an average length and weight of 16.1 inches and 1.7 pounds.  Strongest walleye year classes corresponded to years of walleye fingerling stocking.  Of the 55 walleye sampled, 45 fish (82%) corresponded to years of walleye stocking.  A strong 1994 year class (16 to 18 inch fish) accounted for 36% of the sample.  Walleye fingerlings are stocked into Fish Hook Lake on even calendar years.  Walleye growth rates were slightly below other class 27 lakes.The northern pike gillnet catch rate of 13.8/net is above the range typical for lake class 27.  Of the six previous surveys on Fish Hook Lake dating back to 1958, three surveys have had northern pike at high abundance ranging from 11.5/net (1988) to 13.2/net (1983), and three surveys at moderate levels ranging from 4.7/net (1958) to 6.3/net (1977).  Size of northern pike was small, with an average length and weight of 19.0 inches and 1.7 pounds.  Two and three year old northern pike made up 70% of the sample (71 fish).  Larger northern pike are present, however, with fish measured up to 35.5 inches.  Northern pike exhibited good growth rates after age three when compared to other class 27 lakes.The yellow perch gillnet catch rate of 4.4/net is below the range typical for lake class 27.  Yellow perch gillnet catch in previous surveys have ranged from low to moderate levels.  Historical yellow perch gillnet catch rates have ranged from 2.3/net (1988) to 12.4/net (1992).  The yellow perch in Fish Hook lake are primarily a forage base for the walleye and northern pike populations, but do provide a limited fishery  with a few fish of acceptable size for angling.  Yellow perch were measured up to 11.0 inches.The bluegill trapnet catch rate of 4.9/net is within the range typical for lake class 27, but much lower than past surveys.  Previous surveys have had bluegill trapnet catch rates that have ranged from 42.9/net (1983) to 124.2/net (1967).  Bluegill up to 8.0 inches were sampled.  Bluegill growth rates were fast to age three, then slowed to average levels when compared to other class 27 lakes.Fish Hook lake is known for having a low density, but quality-sized black crappie population.  No black crappie were sampled during the 1997 survey.Nine largemouth bass were sampled, with fish measured up to 20.0 inches.  Two smallmouth bass were sampled in the gillnets and measured 11.1 and 11.7 inches.  Smallmouth bass had not been sampled in previous surveys on Fish Hook Lake.  Standard survey gear (gillnets and trapnets) are not effective methods to assess largemouth or smallmouth bass abundance or size distribution.  To adequately assess a bass population, special sampling such as spring electrofishing needs to be conducted.  No electrofishing has been conducted on Fish Hook Lake.  Fish Hook Lake has good water quality, bottom substrate, and aquatic vegetation that will help insure a healthy largemouth bass and smallmouth bass population.Black, brown, and yellow bullhead are present in Fish Hook Lake.  Black and brown bullhead were sampled in moderate numbers, while yellow bullhead were sampled in low numbers.Anglers can help maintain or improve the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for table fare, but encourages release of medium to large-size fish.  Releasing these fish will help maintain the fish population in Fish Hook and provides anglers with opportunities to catch more and larger fish in the future.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Walleye gillnet catch rates (4.91 fish/set and 11.21 lbs/set) were within the normal ranges for Lake Class 27.  The 1967 and 1977 surveys were the only years with walleye abundance below the first quartile.  Mean weight of individual walleye in 1992 was 2.28 pounds, the highest it has been since 1977.  The size structure (PSD=79, RSD-P=32) is also indicative of a large-sized walleye population.  However, no walleye sampled were > 25 inches.  Growth rates are varialbe among year classes, but generally were good through age 6.  Mean length at age 4 is 15.58 inches.  After age 6, growth is minimal and contributes to the absence of memorable-length walleye.  Some walleye natural reproduction is occurring in Fish Hook Lake, as evidenced by the 1987, 1989 and 1991 year classes, which accounted for 22% of the aged fish.Number of northern pike sampled (5.55 fish/gillnet) was within the normal range, whereas 17.93 lbs/gillnet was above the third quartile for lakes in Class 27.  This was the smallest sample of  northern pike since 1958, but the largest average size ever surveyed.  Mean weight in 1992 was 3.23 pounds.  The size structure (PSD=70, RSD-P=15, RSD-M=3) is also indicative of a large-sized northern pike population.  Northern pike exhibit fast growth through age 3, averaging 18.35 inches at age 3.  However, growth rates decrease sharply thereafter.  Analysis of northern pike age structure suggests consistent annual recruitment.  The strong 1987 and 1988 year classes account for 65% of the aged northern pike.  Rock bass, bluegill and largemouth bass catch rates were above the third quartile for this class of lakes.  Gillnet catches of rock bass have been above the third quartile since 1958, but the 1992 abundance was a four fold increase over 1988.  Bluegill density has also been above the third quartile for every survey except 1983.  Bluegill size structure is small (PSD=25) due to slow growth rates.  Mean bluegill length at age 3 is 3.42 inches.  Largemouth bass also exhibit slow growth, except between the ages of 3 and 5, averaging 8.90 inches at age 3.  Size structure varied greatly among sampling gear.  However, largemouth bass up to 19.9 inches were sampled.  Pumpkinseed, black crappie and yellow perch catch rates were within the normal ranges for Lake Class 27.  1988 was the only previous survey with pumpkinseed abundance not above the third quartile.  In contrast, yellow perch density was below the first quartile from 1967 to 1988.  Both pumpkinseed (PSD=13) and yellow perch (PSD=23) have small size structures.  Black crappie ranged in length from 8.0 to 10.9 inches and appeared to have the best size structure of all panfish species.Catch rates of tullibee, white sucker, shorthead redhorse and black, yellow and brown bullhead were all within the normal ranges for lakes in Class 27.  Golden shiner were the only non-game species to have net catches above the third quartile.</p>",

Walleye pike about the average, redhorse, yellow bullhead, yellow perch, crappie, amd tullibee are below the state-wide average.Management Recommendations:With the abundance of good spawning areas, the northern pike are self-supporting, and will continue to provide a good fishery without additional stocking.  The catch on yellow perch was quite low in comparison to the local average; this might be the answer to the continued below average walleye catch per net.  Walleye fingerlings should be stocked each year, or at least alternate years to try and build up this population.  Walleye spawning area is lacking.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Fish Hook Lake is a large, deep, hard-water lake.  It has 3 permanent inlets.  Portage Creek enters on the west shore from Portage Lake, Sand Creek enters on the northwest shore from adjacent marshland, and the Rapid River enters on the north shore from Potato Lake.  The Rapid River is by far the largest of the three inlets.  All of the streams support fish spawning runs in the spring.  Portage and Sand Creeks contain excellent northern pike spawning habitat, but are not well suited to walleye spawning.  The Rapid River is better suited for walleye spawning.The entire shoal area of Fish Hook Lake has a firm sand bottom.  In some places rocks, rubble and gravel are scattered over the sand, and some marl is also mixed with the sand at various places.Aquatic vegetation was just beginning to grow at the time of the survey; however, bulrushes and various submerged aquatic plants will be found in abundance along much of the shoreline later in the summer.  A dense stand of wild rice was observed starting to grow in and around the mouth of the Rapid River.Twenty species of fish were taken in the test nets and by seining during the survey.  When compared with the statewide figures, the test net catches of tullibee, white suckers, brown bullheads, yellow bullheads, northern pike, largemouth bass, pumpkinseed sunfish, bluegills, hybrid sunfish, and rock bass were all above average.  The walleye catch was about average and the catches of black bullheads, yellow perch and black crappies were below average.  The most significant feature of the net catches were the high tullibee, northern pike, bluegill, and rock bass catches and the low catch of yellow perch and black crappies.A comparison between the 1958 and 1967 lake survey test net catches shows that in 1958 the catches per set of yellow perch, walleyes and largemouth bass were over twice as high as in 1967 and in 1967 the catches per set of tullibee, northern pike, bullheads, bluegills, and rock bass were over twice as high as in 1958.  The catches of other species were quite similar.Spawning conditions were evaluated as good for northern pike, largemouth bass and panfish, and fair for walleye.Reports from local residents indicated that fishing in general has been good over past years.  Fish Hook Lake receives moderate to heavy summer and winter fishing pressure.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Fish Hook Lake is located just north of Park Rapids in Hubbard County.  Fish Hook has a surface area of 1,642 acres and a maximum depth of 76 feet.  There are county-owned public accesses located on the southwest shore of the lake and on the Fish Hook River south of the lake in Heartland Park.  Fish Hook is a popular lake and receives a fair amount of fishing and recreational activity year around.  The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics.  Fish Hook is in lake class 27 and these lakes are generally deep with hard water and have a regularly shaped shoreline.  Other class 27 lakes in the Park Rapids area include Upper Bottle, Garfield, and George. <br> \n <br> \nFish Hook is an excellent fishing lake and is known as one of the best \"multi-species\" lakes around, providing good fishing opportunities for walleye, northern pike, largemouth bass, and panfish.  Fish Hook has good water quality, bottom substrate, and aquatic vegetation that provides excellent habitat for a variety of gamefish species.  Important emergent aquatic vegetation such as hardstem bulrush is found along the southwest and north shores.  Good beds of submerged aquatic vegetation such as claspingleaf and whitestem pond weed (\"cabbage\"), coontail and northern milfoil are common and found out to 20 foot depths. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance was above the current management goal and at the upper end of the range for similar type lakes.  Anglers will find good numbers of walleye in the 16-20 inch size range as well as larger fish up to 30 inches.  Fish Hook Lake is known as one of the better lakes in this area for the opportunity of catching a trophy walleye (30 inch plus).  Fish Hook is currently stocked with walleye fingerlings during odd numbered years.  Yellow perch, an important forage species for walleye, were sampled in low numbers.  Yellow perch abundance in past surveys has fluctuated from low to moderate levels.  Yellow perch generally are small in size with few perch of an acceptable size for angling.  Tullibee (cisco) are present in low numbers, and provide an additional forage species for walleye and northern pike. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike abundance was very high, above the range for similar type lakes.  Northern pike abundance in past surveys has fluctuated from moderate to high numbers.  Sampled northern pike had an average length and weight of 21 inches and 2.1 pounds, with fish measured up to 34 inches. <br> \n <br> \nPresent and past surveys have shown Fish Hook Lake to have an excellent population of largemouth bass and panfish.  Largemouth bass in the 14-16 inch size range are common as well as bass up to 20 inches.  Smallmouth bass are present in low numbers.  Anglers will find good numbers of bluegill in the 6-8 inch size range.  The black crappie population in Fish Hook fluctuates from low to moderate numbers.  Anglers will find black crappie in the 10-12 inch size range.  Fish Hook has an abundant rock bass population.  <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled in low to moderate numbers included white sucker, yellow bullhead, brown bullhead, black bullhead, shorthead redhorse, and greater redhorse. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers and other recreational boaters should be aware that curly leaf pondweed, an aquatic invasive species (AIS), is present in Fish Hook Lake.  To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

Spawning conditions are considered to be good for both game and panfish species.  Northern pike and largemouth bass show good growth rates.  However, walleye and panfish growth is below the statewide median which may indicate high population densities for existing environmental conditions.As compared with the statewide figures, the net cathces are as follows:(1)  There were above average catches of tullibee, northern redhorse, common suckers, yellow bullheads, northern pike, yellow perch, walleyes, largemouth bass, pumpkinseeds, bluegills, and rock bass, and (2) below average catches of black bullheads, brown bullheads, and black crappies.The growth rates of the northern pike and largemouth bass were above average, and the growth rates of walleyes, pumpkinseeds, and bluegills were below average when compared with the statewide figures.Fish Stocking:Although walleye spawning conditions appear to be adequate, there is some indications that stocking has contributed to the population.  Strong 1956 and 1952 year-classes agree with years of stocking.  If future walleye stocking were restricted to alternate years, a second investigation may show more conclusively whether or not stocking is necessary to maintain a good walleye population.Sunfish and bass stocking should be discontinued.With good spawning conditions for northern pike, it is doubtful that additional fry or fingerling stocking contributes significantly to the population.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Fish Hook Lake is located just north of Park Rapids in Hubbard County.  Fish Hook has a surface area of 1,632 acres and a maximum depth of 76 feet.  There are county-owned public accesses located on the southwest shore of the lake and on the Fish Hook River south of the lake in Heartland Park.  Fish Hook is a popular lake and receives a fair amount of fishing and recreational activity year around.  The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical and chemical characteristics.  Fish Hook is in lake class 27.  Other area lakes in this same classification are Upper Bottle, Garfield, and Lake George.Fish Hook is an excellent fishing lake and is known as one of the best \"multi-species\" lakes around.  \"The Hook\" has good water quality, bottom substrate, and aquatic vegetation that provides excellent habitat for a variety of gamefish species.  Important emergent aquatic vegetation such as hardstem bulrush are found along the southwest and north shores.  Good beds of submerged aquatic vegetation such as claspingleaf and whitestem pondweed (\"cabbage\"), coontail, and northern milfoil are common and found out to 20 foot depths.The 2002 survey showed walleye numbers (3.3 walleye/gillnet) to be down and below the current management goal of 5.0 walleye/gillnet.  Walleye abundance in past surveys has been higher, generally near or above the management goal.  Anglers can expect to find good numbers of 16-20 inch walleye as well as larger fish up to 30 inches.  Fish Hook is known as one of the better lakes in this area for the opportunity of catching a trophy walleye (30 inch plus).  While natural reproduction is occurring, the good walleye population found in Fish Hook is the  result of an aggressive and successful stocking program by the DNR.  Fish Hook is stocked with walleye fingerlings in odd numbered years.Northern pike numbers were up, with the gillnet catch rate of 19.6 pike/net the highest recorded for all surveys.  Past surveys have shown northern pike abundance to fluctuate from moderate to high numbers.  While small, \"hammer handle\" northern pike dominated the catch, larger pike are present with fish measured up to 34.6 inches.Fish Hook has excellent populations of largemouth bass and panfish. Largemouth bass in the 14-16 inch size range are common as well as bass up to 20 inches.  Anglers will find good numbers of bluegill in the 7-8 inch range.  The black crappie population in Fish Hook is known more for quality than quantity.  Typically low numbers of crappie are present, with fish in the 10-12 inch size range.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Fish Hook Lake is located two miles north of Park Rapids in Hubbard County. Fish Hook has a surface area of 1,643 acres and a maximum depth of 76 feet.  A county owned public access is located on the southwest shore of the lake off US Highway 71.  There is an additional access on the Fishhook River in Heartland Park.  Fish Hook provides angling opportunities for Walleye, Northern Pike, bass and panfish. <br> \nThe Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics.  Fish Hook Lake is in lake class 27. Class 27 lakes generally are very large, regularly shaped, deep, with very hard water.  Other class 27 lakes in the Park Rapids area include: Upper Bottle, Garfield, and George.  <br> \nWalleye abundance was good and most are a great size for anglers of 15-22 inches, with a number of smaller fish for the future. The average length was 16 inches, with the largest sampled at 28.5 inches. Yellow Perch are important forage for Walleyes and Northern Pike, and perch abundance was in line with past samples. Yellow Perch had an average size of 6 inches and fish were sampled up to 9 inches. <br> \nNorthern Pike abundance was high with an average size of 21.5 inches.  Most fish were 18 to 24 inches, with the largest sampled at 37.5 inches. <br> \nBoth Largemouth and Smallmouth Bass are found in Fish Hook Lake.  Largemouth Bass have been sampled in much higher numbers by the DNR, and all sizes were seen from 6 to 19 inches.  Only one Smallmouth was sampled, and it was 18.5 inches. <br> \nAngling opportunities for panfish include Black Crappie, Bluegill and Pumpkinseed. Black Crappie abundance was similar to past surveys, but most fish were small.  Bluegills and Pumpkinseeds abundance was higher than recent years.  The majority were 3-7.5 inches, but some were sampled up to 9 inches.  <br> \nCurly-leaf Pondweed is an aquatic invasive species (AIS) that has been identified in Fish Hook Lake. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Fish Hook Lake (29-0242-00) is a 1,642.57-acre lake with a maximum depth of 76 feet located two miles north of Park Rapids, MN.  A survey targeting near shore fish species was conducted by Park Rapids Fisheries Staff on July 17-18, 2017 to assess populations of non-game and small sport fish. Eighteen 100-foot sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake shore, sampling a variety of habitat types. Each site was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot 1/8th-inch mesh seine, depending on habitat conditions.   <br> \n <br> \nDuring this assessment, seven sites were sampled with a 50-foot seine and seven were sampled with a 15-foot seine. Site conditions prevented the use of seines at four sites.  Backpack electrofishing was done at 13 sites, several of which were conducted from the side of the boat.  Equipment failure prevented the use of backpack electrofishing at five sites.   Nearshore sampling captured several species of fish including seven species intolerant of disturbance; Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Least Darter, Logperch, Longnose Dace, and Mottled Sculpin.  Other species sampled during the nearshore effort included Bluegill, Bluntnose Minnow, Central Mudminnow, Common Shiner, Fathead Minnow, Iowa Darter, Johnny Darter, Largemouth Bass, Pumpkinseed, Rock Bass, Spottail Shiner, White Sucker, and Yellow Perch.  Nearshore catches will be used along with gillnet and trapnet catch data from a standard fisheries survey on July 17, 2017, to calculate a fish-based Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) score which is indicative of the health of Fish Hook Lake.  <br> \n <br> \nThis survey is contributing to a watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.  Fish Hook Lake is located in the Crow Wing River Watershed. <br> \n</p>",
