                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of nearshore fish species in Mayo Lake was conducted on June 17-18, 2019 by Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program Staff.  Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible.  Backpack electrofishing was completed at all ten sampling stations, but two stations were sampled from the boat due to site conditions.  Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample seven stations, a 15-foot seine was used at one stations, and site conditions prevented the use of seines at two stations.  Nearshore sampling captured nine species of fish including one species that is intolerant of disturbance (i.e., Least Darter) and one that is tolerant of disturbance (i.e., Green Sunfish). <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore data were combined with trap net and gill net data from a July 2019 survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based IBI (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment.  In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g., Blackchin Shiner, Least Darter, and Rock Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g., Fathead Minnow and Green Sunfish).  The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake.  An additional survey was completed on Mayo Lake in July 2019 that resulted in a similar FIBI score.  For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.   <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey indicates Mayo Lake is in good health as indicated by an FIBI score above the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes.  Data from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Crow Wing River Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program Staff conducted a targeted survey of nearshore fish species in Mayo Lake on July 31st, 2019.  Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible.  Backpack electrofishing was completed at 10 sampling stations, but three stations were sampled from the boat due to site conditions.  Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample four stations, a 15-foot seine was used at three stations, and site conditions prevented the use of seines at three stations.  Nearshore sampling captured 13 species of fish including two species that are intolerant of disturbance (Least Darter and Iowa Darter) and one that is tolerant of disturbance (Green Sunfish). <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore data were combined with trap net and gill net data from a survey the week of August 5th, 2019 survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based IBI (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment.  In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g. Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, and Logperch), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g. Fathead Minnow, Green Sunfish, Common Carp).  The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake.  An additional survey was completed on Mayo Lake in June 2019 that resulted in a similar FIBI score. For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.   <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey indicates Mayo Lake is in good health as indicated by an FIBI score above the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes.  Data from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Crow Wing River Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Mayo is a 155 acre lake located just south of Pequot Lakes in Crow Wing County.  There is an undesignated and undeveloped access on State owned property at the south end of the lake.  In 1997 there were 48 homes/cabins located along the lake's 3.2 miles of shoreline.  The lake has a maximum depth of 22 feet and about 95% of the surface area is less than fifteen feet deep.  The lake has moderately hard water and low phosphorus fertility.  Water clarity was somewhat below average for the area in 1997.  Soils in water less than four feet deep were sand and gravel.The aquatic plant community is fairly diverse.  Emergent species help control nutrients and can reduce the amount of erosion due to wave action.  Species like bulrush enhance the quality of spawning habitat for bass and panfish species.  Wild rice often improves the quality of spawning habitat for northern pike.  Submergent and floating leafed species provide cover and food resources for a wide variety of aquatic species.Test netting was conducted in 1997.  A fairly diverse fish population was present.  When compared to similar type lakes, the northern pike catch was in the \"average\" category, and was similar to previous catch rates in Mayo.  Pike averaged 21 inches and 2.1 lbs. in size and growth rate was good.The walleye catch was in the \"low\" category.  The only other time walleyes were caught in test nets was in 1964.Largemouth bass were caught in \"average\" numbers, but only in gill nets.  Young bass were present and averaged 2.6 inches long by mid August.The bluegill catch was in the \"average\" category and was identical to the 1985 catch.  A variety of age classes were present, with fish from the 1994 year class being most abundant.  Bluegill growth bordered on slow.  About 16% of bluegills measured were at least 7.0 inches long.The black crappie catch bordered on \"low\" and was similar to results seen in 1985.  Past crappie catches have varied between the \"low\" and \"average\" categories, not uncommon for this species.Yellow perch is an important forage species.  The perch catch was in the \"low\" category in both 1985 and 1997.  Perch growth was slow.Other species sampled in '97 included pumpkinseed, bowfin (dogfish) and yellow bullhead, all caught in \"average\" numbers.  Brown bullhead, black bullhead and white sucker were all caught in \"low\" numbers.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Mayo Lake is a 155 acre lake located just south of Pequot Lakes in Crow Wing County.  There is an undesignated and undeveloped access on State owned property at the south end of the lake.  The lake is moderately developed with 15 homes/cabins per shoreline mile based on 1997 data.  The maximum depth is 22' and about 95% of the lake is 15' deep or less.  Shallow water substrates consist primarily of sand and gravel.  The lake's aquatic plant community is moderately diverse with 31 species present in 2003 and is critical to maintaining healthy fish populations.  Emergent plants such as bulrush and water lillies are common along much of the shoreline.  It is essential to protect and maintain these plants as they are important for shoreline protection, maintaining water quality, and provide critical habitat for bass and panfish species.  Submerged plants provide food and cover needed by fish and other aquatic species.  \n\nNorthern pike were caught in the highest numbers to date in 2007 at 13.3/gill net.  Average length and weight were above average at 23.4\" and 2.9 lbs. with 33% of these fish measuring at least 24\".  The 2003 and 2004 year classes each accounted for 30% of the catch and measuring approximately 18 to 23\".  \n\nTwo walleyes were caught in 2007 (0.7/gill net).  Only 3 other walleyes have been caught in all previous surveys.  The few fish that are present likely migrate upstream via Mayo Creek from Upper Gull Lake.  \n\nThe 2007 bluegill catch of 39.2/trap net is the highest catch to date, and considered above average when compared to similar lakes.  Black crappies were present in average numbers at 2.0/gill net and 1.7/trap net.  No yellow perch were sampled in 2007.\n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Mayo Lake is a 165 acre lake located two miles southwest of Pequot Lakes in Crow Wing County.  The maximum depth is 22', with 95% of the lake 15' or less.  Emergent vegetation such as bulrush and water lilies surround much of the lake.  Protection of aquatic vegetation, especially emergent vegetation, is important for maintaining good water quality.  Aquatic vegetation is critical for fish spawning areas as well as providing habitat for fish and other aquatic life.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike were sampled in average numbers, when compared to similar lakes at 10.0/ gill net.  Average length was 23.8\" with 43% in the protected 22\" to 26\" slot.  Fish over 26\" made up 23% of the catch.  Lakes in this part of the state have a new northern pike regulation enacted in 2018: possession limit of 10 with not more than 2 over 26\".  All from 22\"-26\" must be immediately released.  Please refer to the current Minnesota Fishing Regulations for additional information. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappies were sampled in high numbers at 9.0/gill net.  Average length was 7.7\".  The trap net catch was average at 2.2/net.  Average length was 7.0\".  For both gears combined 38% measured at least 8.0\" in length.  Bluegills were sampled in average numbers at 16.0/ trap net.  Bluegills averaged 5.4\" with only 3% measuring at least 7.0\" in length.  Mayo Lake bluegills over 7\" were at least 7-years old. <br> \n <br> \nNo invasive species have been discovered in Mayo Lake, but they are located in the area.   Lake users are required to inspect and remove any aquatic plants and animals from their watercraft and trailers, as well as pull the plug and drain all water from the watercraft, including bilges, livewells and baitwells. <br> \n</p>",
