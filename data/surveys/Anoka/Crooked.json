                "narrative": "<p>Crooked Lake is a 115 acre class 30 lake in Anoka County primarily managed for Walleye and Channel Catfish.  Largemouth Bass are a secondary management species.  Walleye fry are currently stocked in the spring of odd numbered years at a rate of 2,000 per littoral acre (172,000 fish), and Channel Catfish yearlings are stocked at a rate of 30 per littoral acre (2,600 fish), also in odd numbered years.  A winter aeration system to reduce winterkill was installed in 1987 and stocking of Walleye and Channel Catfish was initiated in 2001.  A special catch and release only regulation for Largemouth Bass was implemented in 2002, and is still in effect. <br> \n <br> \nWalleyes were sampled at a catch per unit effort (CPUE) of 1.50 fish per net, at the median rate for class 30 lakes.  Three Walleyes were sampled, and ranged from 20.79 to 22.22 inches in length.  Channel Catfish were sampled at a CPUE of 6.0 fish per gillnet, the highest CPUE for Channel Catfish since stocking was initiated in 2001.  The average size Channel Catfish sampled in 2015 was 16.97 inches, with fish up to 22.28 inches observed.  Northern Pike were sampled at a CPUE of 10.5 fish per gillnet, above the third quartile for abundance in class 30 lakes.  The average size Northern Pike sampled in 2015 was 23 inches long, and the largest was 28.74 inches.  Largemouth Bass were sampled at a CPUE of 4.0 fish per gillnet, above the third quartile for abundance for class 30 lakes.  The average size Largemouth Bass sampled was 15.22 inches long and the largest was 20 inches.  Bluegills were sampled at a CPUE of 36.50 fish per trap net, between the second and third quartiles for class 30 lakes.  The average Bluegill sampled in 2015 was 4.88 inches long and the largest was 7.13 inches.  Black Crappies were sampled at a CPUE of 0.88 fish per trap net in the 2015 survey, below the first quartile for abundance in class 30 lakes.  The average Black Crappie sampled in 2015 was 6.19 inches long and the largest was 8.78 inches.  <br> \n</p>",

Operation of an aeration system during the winter months has prevented periodic winter kills in recent years.  Largemouth bass catches from electrofishing were high (41 bass/hour).  Average size of largemouth bass was 9.2 inches, however, fish up to 20.7 inches were sampled.  Bluegill catches were high (106/trapnet), with fish up to 7.7 inches sampled.  Size of bluegill was fair for the area, with 5% of the sampled bluegill seven inches or larger.  Black crappie catches were moderate, with fish up to 9.1 inches sampled.  Black crappie were small, and had an average length of 7.0 inches.  Northern pike catches were moderate for the area (4.5/gillnet).  Northern pike ranged in length from 14.8 to 31.1 inches.  Yellow perch catches were high (12.0/gillnet), with fish up to 8.0 inches sampled.  Average size of yellow perch was small, 6.8 inches.  Two walleye, 11.4 and 16.9 inches, were sampled in the gillnets.  No DNR or permitted private stockings of walleye have been recorded for Crooked Lake.  The following species were sampled in low numbers: pumpkinseed, hybrid sunfish, green sunfish, black bullhead, yellow bullhead, carp, and white sucker.</p>",

Operation of an aeration system during the winter months has prevented periodic winter kills in recent years.  Largemouth bass catches from electrofishing were moderate (29.5 bass/hour).  Average size of largemouth bass was near 9.0 inches, with fish measured up to 13.6 inches.  Bluegill catches were high (198/trapnet), with fish up to 7.5 inches sampled.  Size of bluegill was small, with an average length near 5.3 inches.  Less than 1% of the bluegill sampled were 7.0 inches or larger.  Northern pike catches were moderate (6.5/gillnet), with fish measured up to 34.3 inches.  Black crappie catches were moderate and fish were measured up to 8.3 inches.  Yellow perch catches were high (22.0/gillnet), but average size was small (6.4 inches).  Two walleye, 12.2 and 20.6 inches, were sampled during the survey.  No DNR or permitted private stocking of walleye have been recorded for Crooked Lake.  The following species were sampled in low numbers: pumpkinseed, hybrid sunfish, carp, white sucker, black bullhead, and yellow bullhead.</p>",

A winter aeration system to reduce winterkill was installed in 1987 and a special catch and release only regulation for Largemouth Bass was implemented in 2002, and is still in effect.  Crooked lake was sampled by night time boat electrofishing on June 8, 2016 to assess the Largemouth Bass population. <br> \n\tLargemouth Bass catch rate was 22.85 fish per hour of on time, suggesting a low to moderate abundance of bass compared to other east metro area lakes.   Size structure of bass sampled during this survey was good, 94% of sampled bass were greater than 12 inches in length and 32% of sampled bass were greater than 16 inches.  The catch and release regulation appears to have been successful at creating a Largemouth Bass fishery with a moderate density and high quality size structure. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Crooked Lake is a 115 acre lake in Anoka County assigned to lake class 30.  Primarily managed for Largemouth Bass, a special catch and release only regulation for Bass was implemented in 2002.  Walleye and Channel Catfish have been stocked previously but these efforts were discontinued after 2015 since they failed to create a feasible fishery.  A winter aeration system to reduce winterkill was installed in 1987. This survey was conducted in July 2021 with gill nets and trap nets. Electrofishing to target Largemouth Bass was conducted in May 2021. The previous Survey was conducted in 2015 with the previous electrofishing effort occurring in 2016. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass were sampled by electrofishing at a rate of 81 fish per hour, the highest catch rate in the lake's history. It is nearly four times as high as the previous electrofishing effort but on par with the next most recent sampling in 1999 of 70.9 fish per hour. Average size was smaller than previous surveys with a mean length of 9.9 inches. This may be due to the large number of particularly small fish that were sampled rather than a lack of larger fish. The largest individual measured 19.5 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike were sampled at a rate of 11.5 fish per gill net. This higher than average for similar lakes but is typical relative to the previous survey. Fish size was slightly smaller than previous surveys with a mean length of 22.3 inches. Sizes were fairly well distributed between 15 and 30 inches.  <br> \nTrap nets sampled Black Crappie at a rate of only 0.25 fish per net and gill nets at only 3 fish per net. This rate is low but rates have been relatively low in most previous surveys. The low number of fish sampled makes it impossible to extrapolate any size data to the entire population but the largest fish measured was 8.4 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nBluegill were sampled by trap nets at a rate of 40.5 fish per net. This is higher than average for similar lakes but typical of previous surveys. Fish size was also typical relative to previous surveys with a mean length of 5.5 inches. The longest fish sampled was 7.5 inches. <br> \n <br> \nFour Channel Catfish with a mean length of 22.4 inches were sampled in this survey. These fish have persisted since the cessation of stocking in 2015 and may still offer a limited angling opportunity. Other species sampled included: Common Carp, Green Sunfish, Hybrid Sunfish, Pumpkinseed, White Sucker, Yellow Bullhead, and Yellow Perch. <br> \n</p>",

The  PSD value is 21.2 vs 40.2 in 1986.  The remainder of the species sampled were below the medians; carp, black bullhead, rock bass, pumpkinseed, and black crappie.  Northern pike were not sampled but are known to inhabit the waters and are of moderate size and numbers.  Largemouth bass were sampled by electrofishing.  Good growth rates were observed for age I and II bluegills, but below normal growth was observed for older bluegills.</p>",

Although the bluegill catch was high, the catch was lower than other recent assessments Bluegill PSD was 60 and growth was slow.  Black bullhead, pumpkinseed, and black crappie were taken in low numbers.  Hybrid sunfish were sampled in above average numbers.  Largemouth bass sampled by electrofishing were taken at similar rates to 1989 sampling, but bass taken were only from four age classes.  The cause for the apparent reduction in year classes sampled in 1989 and 1990 is unknown.</p>",

Although their numbers found during this assessment were lower than in previous years, they are still within the normal range for this type of lake. The average size sampled was 6.4 inches. Over 8% of the bluegills sampled exceeded 7 inches. Black crappies were sampled in average numbers, but the sizes are small. Only 20% of the crappies sampled were larger than 8 inches and none over 10 inches. Northern pike were captured at the highest population for this lake since 1969. The northern pike size structure is good. More than 50% of the fish sampled exceeded 25 inches in length. Walleye from the 2001 and 2003 stockings were sampled. These fish are still too small to effectively be sampled by trap nets or gill nets at this time. In 2004 anglers began catching these small walleyes in abundance according to reports. Largemouth bass were sampled in average numbers and good sizes. Channel catfish were also sampled. These fish were a result of a stocking in 2001. The fish average 18.8 inches and 2.19 pounds. </p>",

The regulation started in 1986 and is scheduled to end March 1, 2001.Largemouth bass sampled by spring electrofishing had the highest catch rate recorded for the lake.  Due to strong year-classes in 1997 and 1994, most fish were less than 16 inches long (87.5% of the fish).  Bluegill were abundant, dominating the gill and trap net catch.  Two-thirds of the fish were between 5.5 and 6.5 inches long.  A few were over 7.0 inches long.  Black crappie were present in average numbers.  Most of the fish were from the 1997 and 1996 year-classes and small in size.  Northern pike were few in number - seven fish captured in the nets.  All were from the 1996 year-class and exhibited above average growth.  Hybrid, pumpkinseed, and green sunfish, yellow perch, yellow bullhead, and white sucker were present in average to below average numbers in the nets.  One walleye, one sauger, and one smallmouth bass were captured.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Carp, green sunfish and pumpkinseed are present in numbers wellbelow the state and local medians.  Black bullheads, northern pike, bluegill, black crappie, and hybrid sunfish were all found in numbers significantly (greater than 20% higher) than the statewide medians.  This is also true for the comparison to local medians with the exception of black bullhead.  Black bullhead were taken in numbers significantly lower (greater than 20% lower) than the local median.  Yellow perch numbers were not significantly different than the statewide median but were significantly higher than the local median.  Northern pike aged were III and VII annulus fish.  V annulus northern pike were the most abundant, followed by IV annulus fish.  Fish of these two year classes exhibited good growth.  Based on the length frequency distribution and ages found from scales, the northern pike population in Crooked Lake is made up primarily of older fish with little natural recruitment occurring.  No northern pike stocking has occurred since 1975.  Bluegill aged represented II, III, and IV annulus fish with III annulus fish being most abundant.  III annulus fish exhibited good growth.  Young of the year bluegill were found during shoreline seining.  Black crappie aged were II and III annulus fish with II annulus fish showing good growth being the most abundant.  Young of the year crappie were taken in the shoreline seining.  Only 5 largemouth bass scales were read, the fish having I annulus (two fish) and II annulus (one fish).  Largemouth bass young of the year were taken in shoreline seining.  Black bullhead tend to be small the most abundant size being 6.0-6.4 inches with few larger fish observed.  At this time these fish are smaller than would be desirable to a commercial fisherman.  Although carp sampled were of a size that may be commercially desirable, their numbers are low.</p>",

Black crappies were found in moderate numbers, but their sizes were also small. Northern pike were found in low abundance during this survey. Walleye numbers have increased since the 2004 assessment. Their numbers are now in the normal range for this type of lake. Channel catfish abundance has also increased. Channel cats exceeding 25 inches were caught. Largemouth bass were found in average numbers with some quality sized individuals.   </p>",
