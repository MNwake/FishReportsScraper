The trap net index for bluegill is above tis respective third regional quartile. Northern pike ranged from three to six years of age. Growth rates were normal. Pumpkinseed ranged from four to eight years of age. Growth for the first three growth increments is slow (30-57/5 slower than normal) with the slowest relative growth during the second year. Bluegill ranged from three to eight plus years of age. Strong year classes were established in 1981, 1982, and 1983. Growth increments for the first five years ranged from 20 to 60% slower than normal with the slowest relative growth during the second and third years. Largemouth bass ranged from two to eight plus years of age. The first three growth increments ranged from 37 to 46% slower than normal. Growth for older fish was erratic ranging from 30% slower than normal to 70% faster than normal. Black crappie ranged from three to eight plus years of age and shows erratic reproduction with strong year classes in 1981 and 1983. Growth for the first three increments ranged from 29 to 58% slower than normal with the slowest relative growth during the second and third years. Yellow perch ranged from three to six years of age. Growth increments for the first and second increments were 31 and 37 percent slower than normal. Growth increments for all other years was normal. The catch index for northern pike has increased significantly since 1981 but since both samples were so small it may not be a true index of a change in the population abundance of northern pike.</p>",

The trap net indices for pumpkinseed and bluegill were above the lake class 20 third quartiles. The trap net indices for golden shiner and black bullhead were below the lake class 20 first quartiles. Northern pike sampled ranged from one to seven years of age. The growth rate for the second increment was faster than normal. The length at formation of the seventh annulus was normal. Bluegill sampled ranged from two to seven years of age with strong year classes indicated for 1984 and 1985. The growth rates for the second third and fourth increments were slower than normal. Largemouth bass sampled ranged from to five years of age. The growth rate of the first increment was slower than normal. The length at formation of the fifth annulus was normal. Black crappie sampled ranged from two to eight plus years of age. The growth rates for the second and third increments were slower than normal. Length at formation of the sixth annulus indicates slow growth. Yellow perch sampled were three and four years of age and was probably from the 1987 stocking. Growth rates were normal. Yellow perch have increased significantly in abundance since 1987 based on six gill nets sets.</p>",

This survey was completed in addition to the standard resurvey conducted the week of June 23, 2014. Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake (10 stations) and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible.  Species information was gathered as part of a statewide project to evaluate the fish Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) for Minnesota lakes.  <br> \n <br> \nBackpack electrofishing was completed at all 10 stations, but three sites were sampled from the boat due to unstable footing.  A 50-foot seine was not used, a 15-foot seine was used at 7 stations, and site conditions prevented the use of seines at 3 sites.  Nearshore sampling captured several fish species; bluntnose minnow, central mudminnow, golden shiner, Iowa darter, and Johnny darter.  <br> \n <br> \nRabbit Lake falls within lake class 23 based on the Schupp lake classification used by MnDNR and within Group 2 lakes for evaluating IBI data.  IBI scores range from 0 to 100 and the draft impairment threshold for this group of lakes is 45 (90% CI 36-54) and the exceptional quality level is set at 64.  The IBI score calculated from this survey, using standard gill net and trap net data from the 2014 resurvey was 55. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Rabbit Lake is located in east central Aitkin County approximately 3.5 miles north of Glen. Rabbit Lake has a surface area of 214 acres with a maximum depth of 51 feet.  The water is brownish in color with a secchi disc reading of 9.5 feet in 2019.  There is a small state owned public access with an earthen ramp and no dock located on a small bay on the east part of the lake. <br> \n <br> \nRabbit Lake is known for having a few nice sized Northern Pike and an over abundant population of small Bluegill.  In 2019, Northern Pike sampled in gill nets (4.7/gill net) ranged in size from 15.6 to 31.5\" long, with an average length of 21.5\" and an average weight of 2.4 pounds. Growth rates and size structure appear to have decreased in recent years as well.  This may be related to the decrease in the Yellow Perch population.  Between 1987 and 1992, adult Yellow Perch were stocked to help increase growth rates of Northern Pike by re-establishing the perch population.  By 1999, the perch population had increased substantially and pike growth rates showed a marked improvement.  However, the perch population has declined steadily in the last four assessments to less than one fish per gill net in 2008 and 2014 and to zero in 2019.  It is unclear whether the stocking of Walleye fingerlings beginning in 2000, was causative or just coincidental to the decrease in perch abundance.  Anglers are encouraged to continue releasing Northern Pike greater than 26\" in length.  <br> \n <br> \nBluegill numbers have also decreased in abundance the previous two surveys since 2008 to a more moderate level and the average size (6.0\") has increased by over an inch from the previous survey.  Though none were caught in this survey, fish longer than 8\" have been sampled in each of the last two surveys.  While not overly abundant in 2019 Hybrid Sunfish are present and generally grow larger than Bluegill. Trap nets caught 2.2/net with 35 percent over 8\".   <br> \n <br> \nOther species available to anglers on Rabbit include Walleye, Black Crappie and Largemouth Bass. Walleye fry were originally stocked in the 1920's with early fingerling stockings taking place in 1966 and 1968.  Walleye fingerling stocking was resumed in 2000, but following assessments have yielded minimal Walleye catches. While local residents have commented about catching an occasional Walleye over the years, survey data indicate none of these stockings produced a viable Walleye population.  There still is however some remnant Walleyes that remain from the last stocked years as two were caught in this survey. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Rabbit Lake is located in east central Aitkin County approximately 3.5 miles north of Glen.  Rabbit Lake has a surface area of 214 acres with a maximum depth of 51 feet.  The water is brownish in color with a secchi disc reading of 13 feet in 2008.  The public access is located on a small bay on the east part of the lake. <br> \n <br> \nRabbit Lake has been noted for having a few larger northern pike and an over abundant population of small bluegill.  In 2008, northern pike sampled in gill nets ranged in size from 18 to 37 inches long, with an average length of 26 inches and an average weight of 4.5 pounds. While the abundance has increased significantly since 2004, most of the increase appears to have been in the numbers of larger pike (over 24 inches).  Although growth rates are still much better than observed in 1987 and earlier, they appear to have decreased in recent years.  This may be related to the decrease in the yellow perch population. Between 1990 and 1992, adult yellow perch were stocked to help increase growth rates of northern pike by re-establishing the perch population.  By 1999, the perch population had increased substantially and pike growth rates showed a marked improvement.  However, the perch population has again declined steadily in the last three assessments to less than one fish per gill net in 2008.  It is unclear whether the stocking of walleye fingerlings beginning in 2000 was causative or just coincidental to the decrease in perch abundance.  Anglers are encouraged to continue releasing fish greater than 24 inches in length.  <br> \n <br> \nBluegill numbers have increased in abundance since 2004, and are similar to what was observed in the 1990s.  However, the mean size of bluegill was larger in 2008 by nearly an inch, and the maximum size has increased as well, to 8.8 inches.  This was the first time that we have observed bluegills greater than 8 inches.  The peak of the size distribution also improved to over 6.5 inches.  In comparison, all previous surveys indicated modal length to be in the 4 to 5 inch size class.  Hybrid sunfish were also relatively abundant (15 per net), and they too had fish over 8 inches in the population. <br> \n <br> \nOther species available to anglers on Rabbit include walleye and black crappie.  Walleye fry were originally stocked in the 1920s with early fingerling stockings taking place in 1966 and 1968.  While local residents have commented about catching an occasional walleye over the years, none of these stockings produced a viable walleye population. We began stocking walleye fingerlings in Rabbit Lake again in 2000.  Three surveys of the walleye population have since yielded minimal walleye catch rates of about 1 per net.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie have continued to maintain a good population for this lake type, with both gill net and trap net catches about average or above. While black crappies are fairly abundant, most are not very large.  They ranged in length from 5.5 to 11.7 inches with an average length of slightly over 8 inches. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Rabbit Lake is located about four miles northwest of Glen with a public access located on the southeast side of the lake.  The lake consists of several small bays connecting to a larger basin comprising 214 acres.  The lake historically has been known for small sunfish and a few large northern pike.  Yellow perch were stocked in 1987 and 1990-1992 in an effort to improve bluegill sizes by providing predation pressure on young-of year panfish.  Yellow perch would also provide additional forage for northern pike.  Northern pike abundance was low for this lake type however they grow well on the yellow perch and numerous undersized bluegills in the lake.  Northern pike in Rabbit Lake averaged 25.2 inches and about 4.5 pounds.  Although large pike are not numerous, release of these fish is encouraged to preserve their catch rates and maintain predation pressure on the smaller bluegills and northern pike.  The bluegills averaged about 5.0 inches long and provide consistent action for young anglers.  The largest bluegills measured were about 7.5 inches long.  Some of the best locations to catch bluegills are off lily pads in five to fifteen of water.  Over 90% of the yellow perch sampled were the result of natural reproduction in the lake.  The abundance of yellow perch was similar to those from the last survey in 1994 and about average for this lake type.  Net catches of black crappie suggest average to above average abundance in the lake.  Black crappies averaged 7.3 inches and ranged in size from 6 to 9.5 inches long.  Largemouth bass abundance is similar to other lakes of this type.  Largemouth bass averaged about 8 inches long with the largest fish measuring about 12.5 inches.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Rabbit Lake is located in east central Aitkin County approximately 3.5 miles north of Glen.  Rabbit Lake has a surface area of 214 acres with a maximum depth of 51 feet.  The water is brownish in color with a secchi disc reading of 8 feet.  The public access is located on a small bay in the southeast part of the lake.Historically, Rabbit Lake has been noted for having a few larger northern pike and an over abundant population of small bluegill.  Northern pike sampled in gill nets ranged in size from 21 to almost 32 inches long with an average length of 24 inches and an average weight of 3.5 pounds. The size of fish caught is similar to what we have seen in the past.  In order to maintain a fishery with these large fish anglers will need to continue releasing fish greater than 24 inches in length. Bluegill have decreased in abundance over the last few surveys and numbers are similar to what was observed in the 1970's.  The trap net catch of bluegill decreased from almost 80 fish per lift in 1999 to less than 40 per lift in 2004.  The size of the fish seen remains small, ranging from 3 to 7.5 inches in length.  The average size appears to have increased about three-fourths of an inch, but this increase in average length is probably the result of a weak 2000 year class as growth rates remain slow for the first four years of age. Other species available to anglers on Rabbit include walleye and black crappie.  Walleye fry were originally stocked in the 1920's with early fingerling stockings taking place in 1966 and 1968.  While local residents have commented about catching an occasional walleye over the years none of these stockings produced a viable walleye population and walleye were never sampled in any of our lake surveys until 2004.  In 2000, 150 pounds of walleye fingerlings were stocked followed with two subsequent stockings of 80 pounds of fingerlings in 2001 and 2003.  In 2005, 80 pounds of walleye fingerlings will be stocked and evaluated again in the spring of 2006.  Black crappie have continued to maintain a good population for this lake type, with both gillnet and trapnet indices above average. While black crappie are fairly abundant they are not very large, ranging in length from 4.5 to 9.5 inches with an average length of about 8 inches.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Rabbit Lake is located in east central Aitkin County approximately 3.5 miles north of Glen. Rabbit Lake has a surface area of 214 acres with a maximum depth of 51 feet.  The water is brownish in color with a secchi disc reading of 8 feet in 2014.  There is a small state owned public access with an earthen ramp and no dock located on a small bay on the east part of the lake. <br> \n <br> \nRabbit Lake is known for having a few nice sized northern pike and an over abundant population of small bluegill.  In 2008, northern pike sampled in gill nets (3.8/gill net) ranged in size from 18 to 37\" long, with an average length of 26\" and an average weight of 4.5 pounds.  In 2014, the gill net catch had fallen to (2.2/gill net) and average size was 21.5\" and 2.2 pounds, with no fish larger than 26.5\" sampled.  Growth rates appear to have decreased in recent years as well. This may be related to the decrease in the yellow perch population.  Between 1987 and 1992, adult yellow perch were stocked to help increase growth rates of northern pike by re-establishing the perch population.  By 1999, the perch population had increased substantially and pike growth rates showed a marked improvement.  However, the perch population has declined steadily in the last four assessments to less than one fish per gill net in 2008 and 2014.  It is unclear whether the stocking of walleye fingerlings beginning in 2000, was causative or just coincidental to the decrease in perch abundance.  Anglers are encouraged to continue releasing northern pike greater than 24\" in length.  <br> \n <br> \nBluegill numbers have also decreased in abundance since 2008 to a more moderate level and the average size (4.9\") also decreased by over an inch from the previous survey.  Though not found in abundance, fish longer than 8\" have been sampled in each of the last two surveys.  Similarly, hybrid sunfish showed a significant decrease in numbers, but size remained respectable averaging 6.2\" with a maximum length of 8.3\". <br> \n <br> \nOther species available to anglers on Rabbit include walleye, black crappie and largemouth bass. Walleye fry were originally stocked in the 1920's with early fingerling stockings taking place in 1966 and 1968.  Walleye fingerling stocking was resumed in 2000, and the four assessments to date have yielded minimal walleye catches. While local residents have commented about catching an occasional walleye over the years, survey data indicate none of these stockings produced a viable walleye population.  Black crappie catches were at the upper end of normal level for this lake class, however the average size remained on the smaller side.  Largemouth bass are also found in Rabbit Lake.  A late ice out date coupled with cooler than normal spring temperatures may have contributed to lower catch rates for many species in this survey, which is typically conducted in mid-June. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Rabbit Lake is an interesting, structurally complex lake with a history of producing small sunfish, a  few large northern pike and variable fishing for other species. The net catches in this survey documented the continuation of these trends. Bluegills were caught at a rate of 70.8 fish per trapnet set, which is high for this type of lake. The catches in the first three surveys (1959, 1971 and 1981) had been normal for this type of lake. Bluegills caught in the trap nets in this survey averaged just 5.6 inches long and reached a maximum length of 7.2 inches.  Northern pike were caught at a rate of 1.8 fish per gill net, which is low for this type of lake. Although not numerous, the northern pike are large. The mean length of northern pike caught in the gill net was 26.2 inches and growth rates were faster than in any previous survey. The yellow perch population is up to 7.5 fish per gillnet set. This rate represents an increase over historical levels of less than 1.0 fish per gillnet set and occurred due to the stocking of 5 pounds per acre of yellow perch in each of the following years: 1987, 1990, 1991 and 1992. The first objective of yellow perch stocking was to provide a larger spawning population which would maintain adequate forage for the northern pike. A second objective of the yellow perch stocking was to shift energy flow away from the numerous bluegills and reduce their recruitment.Black crappies were also not numerous in the net catches and the largest fish caught was only 8.4 inches long. Largemouth bass were caught at an average rate for this type of lake and the largest fish caught was 12.5 inches. Additional sampling will be conducted in the future to better document the health of the largemouth bass population.  Walleyes have not been caught in any of the surveys, despite having been stocked in 1966 and 1968.</p>",
