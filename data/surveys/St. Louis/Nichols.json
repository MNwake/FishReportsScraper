                "narrative": "<p>Nichols is a 413 acre lake with 362 acres (88%) of littoral area and a maximum depth of 31 feet.  The lake is located approximately 18 miles northwest of Duluth, MN.  There is a state administered, concrete back-in access located on the north side of the lake off Highway 53 on Lake Nichols Road.  Nichols was last surveyed in 2012.  Nichols was surveyed during the summer of 2017 to update information about fish populations and evaluate the success of the Walleye stocking program.   <br> \n <br> \nCurrently, Walleye fingerlings are stocked into Nichols at a rate of one pound per littoral acre (362 pounds) every odd year.  Walleye abundance of 4.7 was up substantially from 2012 and was average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Walleye average length was 15.4 inches and growth was fast when compared to other Duluth Area lakes.  Ninety-eight percent of the Walleyes aged corresponded to stocked year-classes.  Walleye angling in Nichols Lake should be good in coming years with strong 2013 and 2015 year-classes present.     <br> \n <br> \nA total of 40 Largemouth Bass were sampled by electrofishing.  The Largemouth Bass catch rate was 38.1 fish per hour, which was lower than 2012 (48.8 per hour).  Average length of sampled Largemouth Bass was 12.4 inches, but large fish over 19 inches were sampled and should provide quality angling opportunities.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie and Bluegill population densities were average compared to other similar Minnesota lakes.  Black Crappie average length was small at 6.6 inches.  Bluegill average length was 6.9 inches.  Yellow Perch were scarce and small.</p>",

The yellow perch population has been in question in the past and although it appears low, most year classes are present.  The walleye catch rate is slightly below the state average.  Year  class IV and V are well represented.  This relates to stocking fry at a high rate (2,400/acre) in 1985 and a light fingerling plant in 1986 (1/4 lb/littoral acre).  Panfish growth rates are good for this area.  Largemouth bass are reproducing.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Nichols is a 413 acre lake with 362 acres (88%) of littoral area and a maximum depth of 31 feet.  The lake is located approximately 18 miles northwest of Duluth, MN.  There is a state administered, concrete back-in access located on the north side of the lake off Highway 53 on Lake Nichols Road.  Nichols was surveyed during the summer of 2007 to update information about fish populations and habitat.   <br> \n <br> \nCurrently, walleye fingerlings are stocked into Nichols at a rate of 1/2 pound per littoral acre (181 pounds) every third year.  Walleye abundance of 1.1 remained steady from 2002 but was below average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Walleye mean length was good at 19.7 inches and growth was very fast when compared to other Duluth Area lakes.  Forty percent of the walleyes sampled were over 22 inches in length.  Five year-classes were present corresponding to stocked years.  The bulk of the catch (54%) was comprised of the 2004 year-class. <br> \n <br> \nA total of 8 largemouth bass were sampled by electrofishing.  The largemouth bass catch rate was 13.9 fish per hour, which is similar to what was found in 1991 (13.0) and 1997 (12.9).  Mean length of sampled bass was 10.6 inches, and growth was average when compared to other Duluth Area lakes.  All year-classes from 1999 to 2002 were represented in the survey.  Shoreline seining sampled an additional 10 young-of-the-year bass.     <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike abundance of 7.9 per gillnet lift was up from 2002 (3.9) and was above average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  The northern pike catch in Nichols was the highest since 1976 when 8.0 fish per gillnet were captured.  Mean length was 21.2 inches and growth was average when compared to other Duluth Area lakes.  Twenty percent of the sample was over 24 inches in length and a fish over 38 inches was sampled.  All year-classes from 1999 to 2005 were represented in the survey except the 2000 year-class.  The 2003 and 2004 year-classes were strong, contributing 69% of the captured fish. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie abundance of 2.2 per trapnet lift was up from 2002 (1.7) and was average when compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Black crappie mean length was 6.8 inches and growth was slow when compared to other Duluth Area lakes.  All year-classes from 2000 to 2005 were represented in the survey except the 2004 year-class.   <br> \n <br> \nBluegill abundance of 21.0 per trapnet lift was above average when compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type and was higher than 2002 (7.8).  Bluegill abundance continues to vary greatly over the past nine investigations in Nichols ranging from 2.0 in 1951 to 40.3 in 1976.  Average length of sampled bluegills was 6.3 inches and growth was slow when compared to other Duluth Area lakes.  Recruitment was consistent with all year-classes from 1997 to 2003 represented in the survey.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch were scarce and small, only 11 fish captured and no fish over 7.4 inches was sampled.  Yellow perch abundance of 1.2 per gillnet lift was below average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type and down from 2002 (5.1).  Perch abundance has been falling over the past three investigations, but these rates have been historically cyclical in Nichols.  Average length of perch was 6.4 inches and growth was slow when compared to other Duluth Area lakes.  Only two year-classes were present, 2002 and 2003. <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species sampled include white suckers, pumpkinseed sunfish, brown, black and yellow bullheads.    <br> \n <br> \nInformation was collected on aquatic vegetation, substrate and water quality.  Diversity of aquatic plants was very good with 37 species or species groups identified along 20 transects.  The pondweeds (clasping-leaf, narrow leaf, large leaf, Robbins and variable leaf) and coontail were the most frequently found plants (90% of transects).  Rare species include water arum and cane, which were identified at 5% of the sampling stations.  Joe-pye weed, pipewort, water smartweed and wild rice were found at 10% of the sampling stations.  The most common substrate types were sand and detritus, which were identified along 75%, and 55% of the transects, respectively.  Results of laboratory water analysis indicate Nichols is a slightly basic, moderately hard water lake with low fertility.     <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Nichols is a 413 acre lake located approximately 18 miles northwest of Duluth, MN off of Highway 53.  Nichols has a state administered, concrete, back-in access on the north side of the lake on County Rd. #232.  Maximum depth is 31 feet, with 82% of the lake shallower than 15 feet.     Nichols has been stocked with walleye fry in 1989, 1991, 1993, and 1995; and fingerlings in 1998 and 2001.  Walleye abundance in 2002 of 1.1 per gillnet lift was below average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Mean length of 19.2 inches was good.  Growth was fast, with length at age four of 17.1 inches.  Six year-classes were represented from 1991 through 2001 and all but one walleye were from years in which walleye were stocked.     Northern pike abundance of 3.9 per gillnet lift was average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Mean length of northern pike was 19.9 inches.  Growth was slow, with length at age four of 19.7 inches.  Six year-classes were represented from 1995 through 2001.     Black crappie abundance of 1.7 per trapnet lift was average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Mean length of black crappie was 7.2 inches.  Growth was average, with length at age four of 6.9 inches.  Six year-classes were represented from 1995 through 2001.  Black crappie were also captured in gillnets with an abundance of 3.3 per lift which is average.  Mean length of these fish was smaller at 6.0 inches.     Bluegill abundance of 7.8 per trapnet lift was average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Mean length of bluegill was 6.2 inches.  Growth was slow, with length at age four of 4.1 inches.  The 1997 and 1998 year classes accounted for 70% of the fish, with all year-classes represented from 1992 through 1999.     Yellow perch abundance of 5.1 per gillnet was average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Mean length was small at 6.2 inches.     Nichols has a little bit of everything for anglers to catch, however, most fish are on the small side.  The large 1997 and 1998 year-classes of bluegill could provide good angling in a few years.  Other fish sampled included black bullhead, yellow bullhead, brown bullhead, largemouth bass, pumpkinseed sunfish, and white sucker.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Walleye fry have been stocked in Nichols Lake in 1993, 1991, 1989 and 1985.  Fingerlings were stocked in 1986.  Only 3 of 19 walleye sampled from the 1995 population assessment were born in years that wallye were stocked, indicating strong contribution of natural reproduction to the population.  Gillnet abundance index for walleye was below the accepted range compared to other lakes of similar type. Quality of walleye size structure was fair, with 42% of sampled walleye longer than 15 inches.  Walleye growth rates were average to fast with aged walleye reaching 15.4 iches at age IV.     Gillnet catch rates for northern pike, yellow perch, white sucker, yellow bullhead and brown bullhead were all within accepted ranges compared to lakes of similar type.  Northern pike and yellow perch size structure was poor with only 20% of sampled northern longer than 21 inches and 2% of sampled perch longer than 8 inches.  Northern pike and yellow perch were 19.5 and 5.3 inches long at age IV, which is slow compared to other populations from Duluth Area.     Trapnet catch rates for bluegill and black crappie were both within accepted ranges compared to other lakes of similar type.  Bluegill size structure was good, with 75% of sampled bluegill longer than 6 inches.  Conversely, black crappie size structure was poor with 27% of sampled crappie longer than 8 inches.  Black crappie size structure was influenced by strong 1994 and 1993 year classess which were only 3 to 4 inches long.  Growth rate for both bluegill and black crappie were average compared to other Duluth Area populations.     Two largemouth bass were also sampled from gillnet samples in the 1995 assessment.  An electrofishing assessment scheduled for the spring of 1995 was unable to be completed due to unavailability of an electrofishing boat.  Depending upon availability of equipment and man-hours, the bass population will be sampled in the spring of 1996.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Nichols is a 413 acre lake with 362 acres (88%) of littoral area and a maximum depth of 31 feet.  The lake is located approximately 18 miles northwest of Duluth, MN.  There is a state administered, concrete back-in access located on the north side of the lake off Highway 53 on Lake Nichols Road.  Nichols was last surveyed in 2007.  Nichols was assessed during the summer of 2012 to update information about fish populations and evaluated the success of the walleye stocking program.   <br> \n <br> \nCurrently, walleye fingerlings are stocked into Nichols at a rate of 1 pound per littoral acre (362 pounds) every odd year.  Walleye abundance of 1.1 remained steady from 2007 but was below average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Walleye mean length was 16.1 inches and growth was average when compared to other Duluth Area lakes.  Three year-classes were present (1995, 2007 and 2011).  Eighty-nine percent of the walleyes aged corresponded to stocked year-classes.  The bulk of the catch (56%) was comprised of the 2007 year-class. <br> \n <br> \nA total of 30 largemouth bass were sampled by electrofishing.  The largemouth bass catch rate was 48.8 fish per hour, which is much higher than what was found in 1991 (13.0), 1997 (12.9) and 2007 (13.9).  Mean length of sampled bass was 15.0 inches, and growth was slow when compared to other Duluth Area lakes.  All year-classes from 2001 to 2009 were represented except 2008.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike abundance of 5.5 per gillnet lift was down from 2007 (7.9) and was average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Northern pike abundance in Nichols has been relatively stable over the past eight investigations dating back to 1951 (range, 3.0-7.9).  Mean length was 19.0 inches and growth was slow when compared to other Duluth Area lakes.  All year-classes from 1999 to 2005 were represented in the survey except the 2000 year-class.  All year-classes from 2006 to 2010 were represented. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie abundance of 3.4 per trapnet lift was up from 2007 (2.2) and was average when compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Black crappie mean length was 8.6 inches and growth was slow when compared to other Duluth Area lakes.  All year-classes from 2004 to 2010 were represented except the 2009 year-class.   <br> \n <br> \nBluegill abundance of 7.0 per trapnet lift was average when compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type and was much lower than 2007 (21.0).  Average length of sampled bluegills was 6.1 inches and growth was slow when compared to other Duluth Area lakes.  All year-classes from 2003 to 2009 were represented.   <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch abundance of 1.6 per gillnet lift was below average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type and up from 2007 (1.2).  Average length of perch was 6.4 inches and growth was slow when compared to other Duluth Area lakes.  All year-classes from 2005 to 2008 were represented.   <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species sampled include Iowa darter, blacknose shiner, common shiner, central mudminnow, white suckers, pumpkinseed sunfish, brown bullhead, black bullhead and yellow bullhead.    <br> \n <br> \nNichols Lake was included in an index of biotic integrity (IBI) assessment in 2012.  In addition to standard gillnets and trapnets, beach seines and backpack electrofishing equipment were used to index species richness of the nearshore lake habitat.   <br> \n</p>",
