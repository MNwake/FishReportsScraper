Bowfin, pumpkinseed, bluegill, largemouth bass, black crappie and walleye net catches showed average populations by falling between the first and third quartiles. Yellow perch and yellow bullhead net catches showed a high population by being above the third quartile. The northern pike population has shown a decrease since the 1982 survey, but have shown an increase in weight per fish from 2.95 lbs in 1982 to 4.1 lbs in 1987. The length frequency of fish remained relatively the same with the majority of fish falling between 22.0 and 28.0 inches. The length frequency was from 18.0 to 29.9 inches. Age classes from 4 to 7 were represented with 5 of 7 fish being in the 5 and 6 year old age classes. Fish in the 4- year old class showed an average growth rate, while fish in 5, 6, and 7 year old class showed a slower growth rate than the state average. The yellow bullhead net catch indicated an increase in the population since the 1982 survey, with the majority of fish falling in the 10.0 to 12.9 inches size classes. The brown bullhead net catch showed a slight decrease in population since the 1982 survey with fish falling in the 11.0 to 11.4 inches size class. The bluegill population has shown a slight decrease in numbers since 1982. Ages range from 4 to 8. The growth rate is slower than state averages. The black crappie population has shown a decrease in numbers since 1982. Ages range from 1 to 6 years old. All of the age classes show average growth rates. Lengths ranged from 4.0 to 10.9 inches. Yellow perch from 1 to 6 years old. All of the age classes show average growth rates. Lengths ranged from 4.0 to 10.9 inches. Yellow perch have shown a significant increase since 1982. Gillnet lifts were 35.4 perch per lift compared to 11.33 in 1982. Lengths ranged from 6.0 to 9.4 inches. Ages ranged from 3 to 7 years. Growth rates were on the slower side of state averages. Largemouth bass have shown a decrease in the population level since 1982. Ages ranged from 1 to 8 years. The size classes ranged from 5.0 to 11.9 inches. The growth rates were low compared to the state averages. Walleyes have shown an increase in the population level since 1982. Ages range from 4 to 9 years of age. Year classes 5 and 6 dominated the age class distribution. The growth rates were average when compared to the state averages. The lengths ranged from 17.0 to 25.9 inches.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>East Rabbit Lake is the larger of the two basins which comprise Rabbit Lake.  The east basin is 638 acres and located at the City of Cuyuna, in Crow Wing County.  There is a public access on the west basin, near the channel connecting the two basins.In the 1950's and '60's the east basin was diked off, drained and mined for iron ore.  The basin refilled with water in the '60's and '70's.  It was reconnected to the west basin by a channel in 1978.  In 1992 there were 20 homes/cabins located on the basin's 5.2 miles of shoreline, mostly along the north and east sides.  Due to the past mining activity, maximum depth is over 300 feet.  About 38% of the surface area is less than 15 feet deep.  The basin has \"hard\" water and low phosphorus fertility.  Water clarity is about average for area lakes.  Bottom soils in water less than four feet deep were a fairly even mix between rubble-boulder size rock, sand, marl and muck.The aquatic plant community is fairly diverse.  Emergent species help control nutrients and can reduce the amount of erosion caused by wave action.  Species like bulrush enhance the quality of spawning habitat for bass and panfish species.  Submergent and floating leafed species provide cover and food resources for a wide variety of aquatic species.Test netting was conducted in 1997.  When compared to similar type lakes, catches of northern pike, bluegill, pumpkinseed and bowfin (dogfish) fell into the \"high\" category.  The catch of yellow perch fell into the \"low\" category.In 1997, the northern pike catch was nearly double the '92 catch.  Statistical tests did not show an increase in pike abundance, however.  Pike growth remained in the \"good\" category in '97, after being \"fast\" for the same aged fish in '92.  As a result, average size decreased.Walleye fingerlings have been stocked annually since 1988.  The walleye catch has risen steadily from 0.3/GN in 1982 to 4/GN in '97.  Although seven age classes were present in the '97 catch, fish stocked in 1988-'90 comprised 70% of the sample.  These same year classes made up 69% of the walleye sample in the '92 netting.  Walleye growth also appeared to be slower in '97 than in '92, but remained in the \"good\" category.Few largemouth bass were caught in the '97 netting, but several year classes were present in the catch, including young bass.  Bluegills were caught in \"high\" numbers in '97. their catch rate was similar to that found in the lake's west basin.  Bluegill growth remained \"slow,\" but about 9% of the sampled bluegills were at least 7.0 inches long (compared to 5% in '92).  The black crappie catch was similar to the '92 catch.  Three age classes were sampled.  Most crappies aged were from the 1995 year class and had slow growth.Yellow perch is an important food source for northern pike, walleye and bass.  The perch catch was in the \"low\" category in both the '92 and '97 nettings.  Young perch continued to be sampled in shoreline seining stations.Other fish species sampled in the '97 netting included: rock bass, brown bullhead and yellow bullhead.  All were caught in numbers which can be considered to be \"typical\" when compared to similar type lakes.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>East Rabbit Lake is a 638 acre lake located just north of Cuyuna in Crow Wing County.  East Rabbit has an interesting history.  It was diked off and drained in the 1950s in order to mine the iron ore located below the lake.  In the 1960s and 70s the lake refilled, and in 1978 was reconnected to West Rabbit.  A public access is located in the channel between the two lakes.  Thanks to the old mine pit, the lake reaches depths of 337'.   The remainder of the lake is shallower, with 31' being the maximum depth.  Overall, 38% of the lake is 15' deep or less.  Water clarity was good with a secchi disk reading of 15.5'.   <br> \n <br> \nWalleye fingerlings are stocked in alternate years (484 lbs).  The walleye catch of 4.0/gill net was average compared to similar lakes.  Size was nice, with an average length of 20.1\"and 95% of the fish measuring 12\" or larger.   <br> \n <br> \nA 24\"-36\" protected slot regulation is in effect for Northern Pike in East Rabbit.  The catch rate was average at 5.6/gill net.  Average length was 22.2\" and 35% of the fish were 24\" or larger.     <br> \nLargemouth Bass were sampled by a spring electrofishing survey at a rate of 112/hr.  Average length was 12.2\" and 61% measured at least 12\" in length.  Fish ranged in size from 6.9\" to 17.8\" <br> \n <br> \nBluegills were sampled in average numbers (13.8/trap net) although their size was small.  Bluegills averaged 5.2\" in length, with only 8% measuring at least 7\" in length.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappies were captured in average numbers at 0.4/trap net for this type of lake.  Size was good, with 71% of the fish being 8\" or larger.  Fish as large as 12.3\" were caught. <br> \n <br> \nNo invasive species have been discovered in East Rabbit Lake, but they are located in the local area.  Before and after launching lake users are required to inspect and remove any aquatic plants and animals from their watercraft and trailers as well as pull the plug and drain all water from the watercraft, including bilges, livewells and baitwells. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Experimental regulations on immediate release of northern pike 24.0 inches or greater on the two Rabbit lakes have been effect since 2002. Special spring time trap netting was done in 2000, 2001, and 2002. Spring trap netting was also completed in 2004 and 2005 to evaluate the special regulation.  The 2002 netting was mainly for Big Rabbit, due to ice conditions and the inability to get to East Rabbit.  Trap nets were set from April 22-24, 2009 for a total of 17 sets.   Sixty-seven northern pike were captured.  Sizes ranged from 9.6 to 30.8 inches, with a mean of 21.6 inches.   A total of 28.4% were 24.0 inches or greater.  The 2000 and 2001 spring trap netting catch of fish 24.0 inches or greater was 7.6% and 18.9% respectively.  Mean size was 20.9 inches in 2000 and 21.5 inches for 2001.  The 2009 trap net survey indicates that the percent of fish over 24.0 inches has increased, but mean size has stayed about the same.  To get a more complete picture of how the regulation on improving the size of northern pike is working, data from gill net surveys from these lakes should be analyzed. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>East Rabbit Lake is a 638 acre lake located just north of Cuyuna in Crow Wing County.  East Rabbit is a natural lake which was drained in the 1950's in order to mine the iron ore located beneath the lake.  Thanks to the old mine pit the lake reaches depths of 337'.   The remainder of the lake is shallower with 31' being the maximum depth.  Overall 38% of the lake is 15' deep or less.  A nearshore survey was conducted to assess the populations of both game and non-game fish species.  Fourteen 100' long sampling stations were evenly spaced around the lakeshore.  Each station was then sampled by backpack electrofishing, and if conditions allowed with a 15' or 50' 1/8th inch seine.   <br> \n <br> \nIn this survey all 14 stations were sampled by backpack electrofishing.  The 15' 1/8th inch seine was used at four stations, and the 50' 1/8th inch seine was used at four additional stations.  Six stations had heavy vegetation and/or soft sediment which did not allow for seining.  A total of 21 species were sampled including blacknose shiner, blackchin shiner, mimic shiner, and pugnose shiner.  This nearshore survey will be used along with the gillnet and trapnet survey on 13-16 July 2015, to calculate an Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) score.  This score will be an indicator of the health of East Rabbit Lake. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>              Status of the Fishery <br> \n <br> \nEast Big Rabbit is a 638 acre lake that was once drained in the 1950's and 60's to mine iron ore.  The basin started to refill in the 60's and was reconnected to Big (west) Rabbit in 1978. The public access is located in a channel between the two lakes.  East Rabbit is kind of unique in that much of the lake is characteristic of a mine pit lake with sharp drop-offs and a depth of at least 337 feet, and the rest of the lake has retained characters of a natural lake with 242 acres less than 15 feet deep.  The maximum depth in the lake was 21 feet before mining took place.   <br> \nThe walleye management plan calls for stocking on an every other year basis.  Walleye catch rate in 2009 was moderate at 4.3/gill net.  This is the highest walleye catch rate observed for this lake.  Size ranged from 8.2 to 27.1 inches, with an average size of 17.8 inches.  Northern pike in the rabbit lakes, since 2002 have had a special regulation of all northern pike 24.0 inches or larger must be returned to the water.  This is up for review and it may change to a slot of 24.0 to 36.0 inches as catch and release, and one over 36.0 inches may be kept.   The catch rate in 2009 was 2.8/gill net is lower than the past two surveys of 1997(11.6/gill net) and 2002(8.1/gill net).  Sizes ranged from 16.9 to 33.4 inches, with an average size of 21.6 inches.  Looking at past  summer gill net assessments the regulation has shown only a slight improvement in overall size. Special spring time trap netting also indicated a slight improvement in overall size.  Black crappies were present in low numbers.  Largemouth bass were observed in good numbers of 47.6 per hour during spring electro fishing.  Sizes ranged from 5.2 to 17.8 inches, with an average size of 11.9 inches. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>East Rabbit Lake is a 638 acre lake located just north of Cuyuna in Crow Wing County.  East Rabbit has an interesting history.  It was diked off and drained in the 1950s in order to mine the iron ore located below the lake.  In the 1960s and 70s the lake refilled, and in 1978 was reconnected to West Rabbit.  A public access is located in the channel between the two lakes.  Thanks to the old mine pit the lake reaches depths of 337'.   The remainder of the lake is shallower with 31' being the maximum depth.  Overall 38% of the lake is 15' deep or less.  Water clarity was good with a secchi disk reading of 15'.   <br> \n <br> \nA 24\"-36\" protected slot regulation is in effect for northern pike in East Rabbit.  When compared to similar lakes the northern pike gillnet catch of 4.8/net was average, but the average size of 24.8\" and 3.4 lbs was above average.  Northern pike at least 24\" in length made up 51% of the catch, with fish up to 34.5\" sampled. <br> \n   <br> \nWalleye fingerlings are stocked in alternate years (484 lbs).  The walleye gillnet catch of 2.6/net was low compared to similar lakes.  Average size was nice at 17.3\"and 2.1 lbs.  <br> \n  <br> \nLargemouth bass were sampled by a spring electrofishing survey at a rate of 33.5/hr.  Average length was 11.0\" and 42% measured at least 12\" in length.  Largemouth bass were captured in high numbers in gillnets at 1.2/net.  Average length was 13.2\".  In addition one 14.8\" smallmouth was captured in gillnets. <br> \n <br> \nBluegills were sampled in average numbers in trapnets, although their size was small.  Bluegills averaged 4.7\" in length, with only 2% measured at least 7\" in length.  Black crappies were captured in average numbers in trapnets.  Average length was 10.1\". <br> \n <br> \nNo invasive species have been discovered in East Rabbit Lake, but they are located in the local area.  Before and after launching lake users are required to inspect and remove any aquatic plants and animals from their watercraft and trailers as well as pull the plug and drain all water from the watercraft, including bilges, livewells and baitwells. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>East Big Rabbit is the larger of two basins that are known as Rabbit Lake.  East Big Rabbit is the eastern basin and is a 638 acre lake located just north of the city of Cuyuna in Crow Wing County.  A public access is located on the west basin (Big Rabbit), near the channel which connects the two basins.  In the 1950's and 60's this basin was drained and mined for iron ore.  The basin refilled with water in the 1960's and 70's and was reconnected to the west basin in 1978.  Portions of the lake are developed with 53 homes/cabins along 5.2 miles of shoreline, compared to 20 in 1992.  The maximum depth is 337' and about 38% of the lake is 15' deep or less.  Shallow water substrates are primarily sand, gravel, and rubble.  The aquatic plant community is relatively diverse with 33 species present and is critical to maintaining healthy fish populations.  Emergent plants such as bulrush and water lilies are important for shoreline protection, maintaining water quality, and provide essential spawning habitat for bass and panfish species.  Submerged plants provide food and cover needed by fish and other aquatic species.  Walleye stocking began in 1988 with annual fingerling stocking.  Fingerlings are currently stocked in alternate years at a rate of 1lb per littoral acre.  The 2002 catch of 3.1/gill net is below average when compared to similar lakes.  Average length and weight decreased from 19.2\" and 2.6lbs in 1997 to 18.3\" and 2.3lbs in 2002 with 71.4% of all walleyes sampled by gill net measuring at least 18\".  Spring electrofishing indicated a decent 2000 year class which accounted for 70% of the fish caught by electrofishing.  These fish measured approximately 9.5\" to 11\" when sampled.  Northern pike were caught in above average numbers for the second consecutive netting in 2002 at 8.0/gill net.  Past catches have ranged from 1.8 to 11.6/gill net.  The 1998 to 2000 year classes accounted for 73.6% of the catch.  Average length and weight in 2002 (20.5\" and 1.8lbs) increased from 1997 (18.9\" and 1.5 lbs).  The largemouth bass catch of 0.6/trap net was average and the gill net catch (1.4/gill net) was above average when compared to similar lakes.  About 55% of all bass measured (gill nets and trap nets) were 12\" or larger.  Spring electrofishing resulted in a largemouth bass catch rate of 90.4/hr with an average length of 12.5\" and 58% measuring at least 12\".  The bluegill catch of 21.7/trap net was average.  These fish are slow growing with 4.2% of trap netted bluegills measuring 7\" or larger, compared to 9.3% in 1997.  Only one black crappie was sampled in any gear type, resulting in an abundance of 0.1/gill net, which is below average for the lake class.  Yellow perch are an important forage species for the lake's game fish.  Past catches ranged from no fish sampled in 1997 to 44.3/gill net in 1987.  At 0.2/gill net, the 2002 catch was below average for the second consecutive netting.  </p>",
