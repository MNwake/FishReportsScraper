Two groups of mallards were observed one having 6 little ducklings, the other having 7.  No cabins were located on south and southeast shores.  Resort on Thunder Lake has landing and two boats on the lake.  They send customers to Little Bass for panfish and largemouth bass.  Report from one of the customers that fishing on the lake had been slow.  Few panfish (sunfish,crappie) were being caught but size ran very small.   Winter fishing pressure is light with only three to five houses on the lake.Present Fish Population Status: The northern pike, black crappie, bluegill, and pumpkinseed were all over the state and local mean for both Number/set and lbs./set.  The northern pike size over almost 21 lbs.  Fish looked very healthy (fat,meaty).  Maybe due to ample supply of food present.  Black crappie ran small with only a few weighing over 1/2 lbs.  Very large bluegill population but size small, 5\" long was average.  Some interbreeding was observed between pumpkinseed and bluegill.  Walleye population was above state and local mean in number/set but above local mean in lbs/set.  Walleye caught were good size- 4 lbs. average.  Largemouth bass population ran even with state and local means.</p>",

The assessment consisted of 30 survey sites evenly spaced 150 meters around the lake. Assessments were made in three habitat zones: Shoreline Zone (the shore-water interface to the top of the natural bank), Shoreland Zone (land-ward from shoreline to development structure or 100 feet), and Aquatic Zone (lake-ward 50 feet of shoreline). The average lakewide habitat score was 77.6 (?3.6) out of 100 possible, which is moderate and above the statewide average score of 73. A moderate score indicates a a high percentage of unaltered habitat but may lack an aspect of critical habitat. Approximately 53% of the sites were developed with a mean score of 63.0 (?4.0), while undeveloped sites had a mean score of 94.3 (? 1.4).</p>",

A nearshore survey was conducted to assess the populations of both game and non-game fish species.  Ten 100' long sampling stations were evenly spaced around the lakeshore.  Each station was then sampled by backpack electrofishing, and if conditions allowed with a 15' or 50' 1/8th inch seine. <br> \n <br> \nThe survey took place July 22, 2022, with all 10 stations sampled by backpack electrofishing.  The 50' 1/8th inch seine was used at 6 stations and the 15' 1/8th inch seine was used at 1 station.  Thirteen species were sampled, including four species that are intolerant of habitat disturbance: Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, and Banded Killifish. This nearshore survey will be used along with the gill net and trap net survey collected the same week to calculate a Fish-Based Index of Biotic Integrity (FIBI) score.  The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health by the types of fish species present and comparing it to what is expected for this type of lake.</p>",

Average length was 7.7\" in gill nets and 8.0\" for trap net sampled fish.  For both gears combined 50% measured at least 8.0\" in length.  Bluegills were sampled in average numbers at 10.7/trap net.  Average length was 6.2\" with 22% at least 7.0\" in length. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass were sampled in high numbers at 2.0/gillnet.
