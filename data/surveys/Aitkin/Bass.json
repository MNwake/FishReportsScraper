Bluegill sampled ranged from two to eight years of age with strong year classes indicated for 1982, 1983 and 1985. No fish were sampled from the 1986 or 1987 year classes. The growth rates for the first through the fifth increments were slower than normal. Black crappie sampled ranged from one to six years of age.

All of the fish species aged appear to be very slow growing. Natural reproduction appears to be lacking during some years as well.</p>",
