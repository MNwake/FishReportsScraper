                "narrative": "<p>South Heron Lake is part of the Heron Lake Restoration project (Wildlife) and is not specifically managedfor fish, although it has the potential to provide northern pike and yellow perch fisheries.  The northern pikeand yellow perch populations were very low during the drought years.  As the water levels increased, northern pikeand yellow perch spawning habitat availability improved, resulting in increased populations.  Northern pike andyellow perch populations were in very good shape as of the summer of 1994.     Northern pike numbers were 3 times as high as other lakes similar to South Heron.  There was a very strongyear class produced in 1993 and these fish averaged 18 inches in our summer survey.  Northern pike lengths rangedfrom 14 to 31.5 inches.     Yellow perch numbers were also 3 times as high as other lakes similar to South Heron.  Yellow perchreproduction was very successful in 1992 and 1993.  Yellow perch lengths ranged from 2.2 to 12.8 inches.     The future of these populations will likely be determined by the natural and man-induced water levelfluctuations.  However, as of 1994, these populations were doing well, so don't be afraid to give South Heron atry if you enjoy northern pike and yellow perch fishing.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>South Heron Lake is a 2,845-acre lake located 2 miles northwest of the City of Lakefield.  Heron Lake is a designated wildlife lake, therefore it is managed primarily for wildlife such as waterfowl, furbearers, and other game and non-game species.  Water levels are typically lowered during the fall to encourage winterkill of undesirable fish species such as Common Carp and Black Bullheads because they destroy aquatic vegetation which is important for waterfowl.  A rotenone rehabilitation project was done during the winter of 1997-1998 to decimate fish populations; however, this effort was not as successful as desired.  Because this is a designated wildlife lake that is prone to frequent winterkills because of water level manipulation, fisheries management is focused on providing a \"boom or bust\" fishery that is predator heavy for control of rough fish populations.  The species that are stocked is for the purpose of controlling non-desirable species such as fathead minnows and common carp.  Heron Lake may provide some benefit to anglers and at the same time help in controlling rough fish that cause turbidity and inhibits aquatic vegetation from thriving.  From a fisheries perspective, Heron Lake is managed primarily for Northern Pike and secondarily for Walleye and Yellow Perch.  Northern Pike fry were stocked in 2014 and 2016. Walleye fry are stocked if there is a surplus available and have been stocked annually since 2011.  A fisheries survey was conducted the week of May 22, 2017 to monitor fish populations using three gill nets and 11 trap nets.  <br> \n <br> \nThe 2017 Northern Pike catch rate was 24.0 per gill net, similar to the 2011 catch rate of 27.0 per gill net, and greatly exceeding the expected catch rates for similar lakes (1.2 to 7.8 per gill net).  Northern Pike lengths ranged from 15.0 to 29.1 inches and averaged 18.4 inches.  Growth of Northern Pike is fast, as the abundant 16 to 20 inch pike were likely from the 2016 stocking (age-1).  Anglers reported excellent Northern Pike fishing during the fall of 2017 and the winter of 2017-2018.  <br> \n <br> \nThe catch rate of Walleye in 2017 was 34.0 per gill net, an increase from the 2011 catch rate of 27.0 per gill net, and greatly exceeding the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (3.2 to 15.3 per gill net).  Lengths of Walleye ranged from 8.4 to 19.3 inches and averaged 10.4 inches, with 96 percent of the Walleye sampled being between 8.0 to 12.0 inches, which were age-1 fish (2016 stocking).  The four larger Walleye (18-19 inches) were age-3, corresponding to the 2014 stocking.  Growth was very fast as mean length at age-3 was 18.3 inches.  Anglers reported excellent Walleye fishing during the fall of 2017 and the winter of 2017-2018.  If the strong 2016 year class can survive the winter, Walleye angling should continue to be excellent on Heron Lake.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch were captured at a rate of 41.7 per gill net, which exceeds the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (3.0 to 22.5 per gill net).  Yellow Perch lengths ranged from 4.8 to 11.7 inches and averaged 6.2 inches. Yellow Perch are self-sustaining in Heron Lake.  <br> \n <br> \nThe Black Bullhead catch rate in 2017 was 60.3 per gill net, which is similar to the long term average of 63.3 per gill net since 1987. Black Bullhead lengths ranged from 3.9 to 10.8 inches and averaged 6.3 inches. Bigmouth Buffalo were captured at a rate of 9.7 per gill net, exceeding the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (0.3 to 6.1 per gill net). Lengths of Bigmouth Buffalo ranged from 4.5 to 30.7 inches and averaged 18.5 inches.  The largest buffalo sampled was nearly 20 pounds. Common Carp catch rates were 10.3 per gill net and 15.2 per trap net, exceeding the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes for both gears (0.5 to 9.1 per gill net; 0.7 to 5.1 per trap net).  Common Carp lengths ranged from 9.1 to 33.2 inches and averaged 20.4 inches.  The largest carp sampled was nearly 27.0 pounds.  The current water level drawdown management tool doesn't appear to be controlling rough fish populations in Heron Lake.   <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled include Creek Chub, Tadpole Madtom, White Sucker, Black Crappie, and Yellow Bullhead.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>South Heron Lake is part of the Heron Lake Restoration Project.  Fish management on the lake is primarily to attain Wildlife goals.  Any populations that develop and provide recreational angling opportunities are considered a bonus for local anglers.  Yellow perch and northern pike populations have provided excellent fishing at times.  Wildlife management activities as well as natural climatic changes will influence the quality of yellow perch and northern pike populations.  Assessments are conducted to determine the effects of the electric barrier and draw-down attempts on under-utilized fish populations.The primary role of northern pike in the Heron Lake system is to help control black bullhead, bigmouth buffalo, and common carp (\"the big three\").  In 1993, adult northern pike produced a very large year class of young fish.  Northern pike spawning conditions improve considerably during high water years and there was plenty of water in 1993.  Since 1994, northern pike numbers have declined because there has only been marginal reproduction.  However, the fish hatched in 1993 have had an opportunity to grow quite large fairly quickly.  Northern pike from the 1993 year class averaged 31 inches.  Northern pike sampled in 1997 ranged from 17.4 to 34.9 inches and averaged 28.7 inches.To some degree, the presence of yellow perch in Heron Lake hinders the effectiveness of northern pike to control bullhead, buffalo, and carp .  Since yellow perch are often a prefered food item, northern pike may feed on yellow perch before \"the big three\" species.  If there were no yellow perch, northern pike would be forced to eat \"the big three\" species just to survive.  However, there are yellow perch and they appear to be doing very well.  The number of yellow perch per net in 1997 was considerably higher than other lakes similar to South Heron.  Yellow perch ranged from 4.8 to 12.6 inches and averaged 8.1 inches.To promote and maintain healthy lakes, pollution needs to be controlled.  Fish and wildlife habitat are directly affected by water quality.  Nutrients, sediments and other waste can drastically alter the chemical and physical characteristics of lakes.  It is important to maintain, if not improve, the water quality of South Heron Lake through watershed management.  Improved land use practices will help insure this lake can be enjoyed by future generations.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>The Heron Lake system includes 8,151 acres of discontinuous lake basin.  Seventy-eight percent of this acreage is included in North Heron (3,526 acres) and South Heron (2,845 acres).  The watershed comprises 472 square miles (302,080 acres) for a watershed-to-lake ratio of 37 to 1.  Heron Lake has a renowned history for waterfowl hunting because of the historical production of aquatic vegetation.   In 1973, it was designated by the Commissioner of the Natural Resources as a wildlife management lake following public hearings in the local area.  The wildlife management goal is to improve the lake system for waterfowl, fur bearers, and numerous other species of game and nongame wildlife traditionally found in Southern Minnesota.  Effective management requires periodic but temporary draw-downs, such as occur during times of drought.  Extended periods of high water destroy the aquatic vegetation needed by wildlife.  Fish species can also destroy aquatic vegetation.  Common carp invaded South Heron Lake around 1918 and have made it difficult to maintain production of aquatic vegetation for northern pike spawning and for waterfowl foraging.   Efforts to reclaim South Heron with rotenone were conducted during the winter of 1997-98 with little success due to an unexpected thaw causing dilution of rotenone.  Fisheries management contributes to the overall goal of wildlife management by managing the lake to include a fishable northern pike population with fish 30 inches or greater found in the sample.  Additionally, yellow perch and walleye are maintained by stocking.  Addition of northern pike, yellow perch and walleye is beneficial to the lake because they may act as predators to keep common carp and other undesirable fish species in low abundance.  A population assessment was conducted on South Heron Lake during the week of June 13, 2011 using 1 gill net and 13 trap nets to assess the current management goals. <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike have been stocked in South Heron Lake to augment the population and achieve the management goals with adult (1998 and 1999), fingerling (2006), and fry (1998 and 2009) northern pike.  The northern pike gill net catch rate in 2011 was 27.0 fish per gill net which was greater than the normal range of 1.2 to 7.8 fish per gill net and the greatest observed catch rate since 1987.  Additionally, the 2011 gill net catch rate was greater than the long-term average of 14.3 fish per gill net.  South Heron Lake has historically been sampled with trap nets (11 years of data since 1981) while gill nets are used infrequently (5 years of data since 1987).  The 2011 trap net catch rate was 1.2 fish per trap net which is one of the lowest catch rates in Heron Lake and less than the long-term average catch rate of 5.6 northern pike per trap net.  The high gill net catch rate in combination with the low trap net catch rate indicates the sporadic nature of northern pike and the need for gill nets and trap nets to effectively sample the northern pike population in Heron Lake.  The average length of northern pike in the gill net catch was 16.9 inches and the average length in the trap net catch was 21.5 inches with the largest fish being 32 inches.  The size structure of the northern pike population was less than desired.  The population is currently dominated by smaller fish in the 14 to 21 inch range.  The condition of the northern pike in the sample was average indicating a population that is of expected weight for their length indicating adequate foraging success.  Overall, the northern pike population appears to be maintaining itself near the management goal with good abundance and good body condition.  Fishing for northern pike in South Heron Lake can be good with larger fish caught at opener in cooler water and again in the fall.    <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nThe yellow perch catch rates in 2011 were 13.0 fish per gill net and 0.6 fish per trap net.  The catch rates were within the normal ranges for gill nets (3.0 to 22.5 per net) and trap nets (0.3 to 2.6 per net) meeting the management goal, but they were less than the long-term catch rates of 37.4 per net and 7.9 per net for gill nets and trap nets respectively.  The average length of yellow perch in the sample was 7.2 inches in the gill net and 8.3 inches in the trap nets with fish ranging from 5.7 to 11.4 inches in the samples.  The size structure indicated a population that is dominated by fish in the 5 to 8 inch range.  The overall condition of the yellow perch in the sample was below average which is most likely a result of a decreased body condition shortly after the spring spawning period and not entirely related to poor foraging success.  Overall, the yellow perch population is within the normal range for South Heron Lake but the length and condition of the population does not indicate a population that would satisfy yellow perch anglers at this point.  At this stage in their population development, yellow perch appear to be a forage base for other species.  Given several years of population maturity, the yellow perch angling opportunity on South Heron Lake will improve and the population will contain fish of a larger average size.  <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nWalleye are maintained with stocking in South Heron Lake and for the last 2 years (2010 and 2011) walleye fry in excess of 1 million each year have been stocked.  Although it would not be considered a high priority for walleye fry given the shallowness of Heron Lake, the hatchery has had good hatching success so surplus walleye fry are stocked as an additional predator.  The gill net catch rate in 2011 was 27.0 fish per gill net which is greater than both the normal range of 3.2 to 15.3 per net and the long-term average of 6.5 per net.  The 2011 catch rate is also the greatest on record since 1987.  The trap net catch rate was 0.1 fish per trap net, less than the normal range of 0.3 to 1.7 fish per net and long-term average of 0.2 per net, but trap net catch rates are poor indicators of walleye abundance and gill nets are more reliable.  It appears the 2010 fry stocking is contributing to the population as 54% of the sample was from that age class.  The other ages represented in the sample were age 2 (42% of sample), and age 3 (4% of sample), both which were not stocked year classes and most likely a result of emigrants from other connected lakes or rivers or from natural reproduction.  As you might expect, there are several walleye managed lakes above Heron Lake.  The average length of walleye in the gill net sample was 12.5 inches with a range from 9.6 to 18.7 inches.  The lengths of walleye in the sample indicated a population that is nearing a balanced size structure with a good range of sizes present.  The overall condition of the population was good for a late spring sample and indicates a population that is foraging successfully.  Overall, the establishment of walleye as a predator to control unwanted species in South Heron Lake is successful and stocking will continue to maintain the population.  As a byproduct, a fantastic angling opportunity for walleye exists in South Heron.  South Heron Lake is vast and shallow, but walleye anglers that commit time to find the walleye will also find good success.  Walleye angling could be successful for those anglers that can figure out the patterns of walleye in South Heron.  <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled in the gill net and trap nets were bigmouth buffalo, black bullhead, black crappie, common carp, creek chub, tadpole madtom, white crappie, white sucker, and yellow bullhead for a total of 12 species including northern pike, yellow perch, and walleye.  Bigmouth buffalo, black bullhead, black crappie, white crappie, and white sucker were below long-term catch averages but within normal ranges for most species.  However, common carp catch rates were greater than the long-term catch average and greater than the normal range indicating the need for continued predator stocking in future years.  Creek chub, tadpole madtom, and yellow bullhead are infrequently sampled but near average catch rates for South Heron Lake.     <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nTo promote and maintain healthy fish populations, pollution and other inputs need to be controlled.  Fish habitats are directly affected by water quality.  Nutrient, sediment, and other waste inputs can alter the biological, chemical, and physical components of a lake.  It is paramount to maintain if not improve the current water quality of South Heron Lake through watershed best management practices to preserve this fishery for future generations to enjoy. <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nPrepared by Nate Hodgins <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>South Heron lake is primarily managed for wildlife and is part of the Heron Lake restoration program.  As a result, fisheries is secondary in importance.  South Heron lake does have the potential to provide good fisheries of yellow perch and northern pike at times.  Presently, the northern pike population is low.  Northern pike are most successful in producing a strong year class in years of high water.  Since drought conditions were present during the late 1980s and early 1990s, the northern pike population has been adversly affected.  However, three years of high water, makes us optimistic that the northern pike population will bounce back to some degree.  There are northern pike up to 10 pounds and probably even larger in South Heron lake right now.  Yellow perch populations tend to fluctuate greatly in our shallow prairie lakes.  In 1991, we only collected 5 yellow perch in our nets but we collected 401 in 1993.  The increase in yellow perch was due primarily to a strong year class that ranged from 5.0 to 7.0 inches.  This strong year class should be at the size anglers are willing to seek by now and may provide good fishing throughout 1994 and even 1995.  The question is always, where are they and when will they bite?  They may only be vulnerable to anglers throughout the winter but it is certainly a lake to try if you like perch fishing.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>The Heron Lake system includes 8,151 acres of meandered lake basin.  Seventy-eight percent of this acreage is included in North Heron (3,526 acres) and South Heron (2,845 acres).  The watershed comprises 472 square miles (302,080 acres).  In an average season, it is sufficient to fill both lakes almost three times and to fill them in slightly over thirty days during typical April flows.  In 1973, the system was designated by the Commissioner of Natural Resources as a wildlife management lake following public hearings in the local area.  The goal is to improve the lake system for waterfowl, fur bearers, and numerous other species of game and nongame wildlife traditionally found in Southern Minnesota.  Effective management requires periodic but temporary draw-downs, such as occur during times of drought.  Extended periods of high water destroy the aquatic vegetation needed by wildlife.Management of South Heron by The Section of Fisheries is limited to monitoring the fish population on an annual basis for the Section of Wildlife.  During the winter of 1997-98, the Section of Wildlife injected rotenone under the ice in order to rehabilitate the lake.  Prior to the reclamation, approximately 265,000 pounds of common carp were removed by a commercial fisherman.  It was estimated that an additional 320,000 pounds of common carp were killed by the rotenone.  Warm weather and increased  flow soon after the reclamation may have reduced the effect of the rotenone.  In the Spring of 1998 the Section of Wildlife stocked approximately 35,000 northern pike fry and 500 pair of bluegill in an attempt to control common carp.  An additional 4,200 winter rescue northern pike were stocked during the winter of 1998-99.In June of 1998 a population assessment was attempted on South Heron Lake.  The lake was approximately 2.1 feet shallower in 1998 than in 1997.  Because of the shallow water, only four trap nets were set in the 2,800 acre lake.  These nets were in two to three feet of water and could not be set in the same locations as the previous year.  It is likely that fish were congregated in these deeper areas during the survey thus biasing results. To promote and maintain a healthy fish population, pollution and other inputs need to be controlled.  Fish habitat is directly affected by water quality.  Nutrient, sediment and other waste inputs can drastically alter the chemical and physical components of a lake.  It is paramount to maintain if not improve the current water quality of South Heron Lake through watershed management to preserve this fishery for future generations to enjoy.   </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>South Heron Lake, located in Jackson County, is a 2,845-acre lake that is managed primarily for northern pike and secondarily for yellow perch.  South Heron Lake has been opened to liberalized fishing approximately every other year since 1948.  Heron Lake has a renowned history for waterfowl hunting because of the historical production of aquatic vegetation (Sago pondweed).  The Section of Wildlife takes the lead in management efforts on Heron Lake because of the waterfowl reputation.  Common carp invaded South Heron Lake in 1918 and have made it difficult to maintain production of aquatic vegetation for northern pike spawning and for waterfowl foraging.  Efforts to reclaim South Heron were conducted during the winter of 1997-98 with only partial success due in part to an unseasonable thaw which caused dilution of toxicant.  Trap netting has been conducted on South Heron Lake every year since 1993.  Water levels have varied at the time of sampling on South Heron over the years which challenge standard sampling logistics and thus make it more difficult to interpret fish population data. The catch rate for northern pike in trap nets was 5.00 fish/net set and has ranged between 0.23 and 18.57 fish/net set since 1993.  The highest catch rate of northern pike was recorded in the 1994 survey.  This high catch rate was likely a result of the favorable spawning conditions created from high water in 1993.  Total lengths of northern pike sampled in 1999 ranged between 16.6 and 29.0 inches, with an average of 20.6.  According to the stocking records, northern pike were first stocked in 1998.  Fishing for northern pike can be done on South Heron Lake but \"catch and release\" is encouraged.  It is believed that common carp numbers may be better kept in check by maintaining a higher predator base or northern pike density.The average yellow perch trap net catch rate was 4.17 fish/net set which was almost twice the upper normal range (2.62 fish/net set) for this lake class.  Yellow perch catch rates have fluctuated from 0.75 to 21.00 fish/net set since 1993.  Total lengths of yellow perch (N=25) sampled in 1999 ranged between 4.6 and 12.5 inches, with a mean of 7.5.  These data suggest the yellow perch population is relatively dense and the size structure consisted mostly of smaller individuals.Only one bluegill was sampled in trap nets in 1999.  The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources Section of Wildlife stocked one thousand bluegills at 5.0 fish/per pound in June of 1998.  The average common carp trap net catch rate was 36.33 fish/net set in 1999, 10.00 fish/net set in 1998, and 7.78 fish/net set in 1997.  The catch rate in 1999 was more than seven times the upper expected range (5.11 fish/net set).  Total lengths of common carp ranged between 7.3 and 27.4 inches, with an average of 13.1.  Unfortunately, a substantial mode was observed at 9.0 to 9.5 inches, which indicates this year class of carp will likely move through the population unless some unforeseen \"summerkill\" or \"winterkill\" occurs.  The latter part of 1999 in southwestern Minnesota had unseasonably dry conditions and symptoms of this were seen in dried up smaller wetlands in the area.  These dry conditions and lower water increases the probability of a \"winterkill\" which would probably reduce the number of common carp.The average black bullhead trap net catch rate was 69.83 fish/net set in 1999, 15.75 fish/net set in 1998, and 26.11 fish/net set in 1997.  The catch rate of black bullhead in 1999 was near the upper normal range (78.13 fish/net set) for this type of lake.  Total lengths of black bullhead sampled in trap nets ranged between 4.6 and 11.4 inches, with a mean of 7.5.  These data suggest the black bullhead population was high compared to other area lakes and the size structure consisted mostly of smaller individuals.  Other species sampled in South Heron were bigmouth buffalo, common shiner, golden shiner, green sunfish, orangespotted sunfish, tadpole madtom, and white sucker.     To promote and maintain healthy fish populations, pollution and other inputs need to be controlled.  Fish habitats are directly affected by water quality.  Nutrient, sediment and other waste inputs can drastically alter the biological, chemical, and physical components of a lake.  It is paramount to maintain if not improve the current water quality of South Heron Lake through watershed management to preserve this fishery for future generations to enjoy.</p>",

The net catches were dominated by large numbers of small fish, indicating that natural reproduction is very successful and that possibly most of the larger fish migrate out into the Des Moines river system.  Net catches also indicate that Heron Lake is a very efficient spawning and rearing area for undesirable fish species.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Heron Lake is a 2845 acre lake located in Jackson County near Lakefield.  The lake is about 5 miles long and has a maximum depth of 5 feet.  South Heron lake is part of the Heron Lake Restoration Project.  The lake is presently managed by the Section of Wildlife.  Fisheries role is limited to monitoring and stocking only after a catastrophic winterkill.  The Section of Fisheries is monitoring the lake on an annual basis to determine the effectiveness of the electric weir and to determine the effect of watershed restoration on the fish community.Our 1995 population assessment indicated a high number of northern pike compared to lakes similar to Heron.  Northern pike lengths ranged from 18 to 34.5 inches and had an average length of just over 24 inches.  The average weight of northern pike was about 3.5 lbs.  Local anglers reported excellent northern pike fishing during the summer of 1995.Summer trapnetting indicated that the yellow perch population is very high compared to lakes similar to South Heron.  The number of fish per net was almost 18 times higher than the local average.  Yellow perch lengths ranged from 4 to 11.5 inches and had an average length of just over 7 inches.  Yellow perch should provide excellent fishing during the winter of 1996.Black crappie numbers are down slightly since our 1994 survey but would still be considered normal for lakes similar to South Heron.  Black crappie lengths ranged from 4.5 to 12 inches and averaged about 8 inches.  The average weight of black crappie was almost 0.5 lb.Since the installation of the fish barrier in 1991, the carp population has decreased from 65.5 fish per trapnet in 1991 to 8.5 fish per trapnet in 1995.  The northern pike population has increased from 0.5 fish per trapnet in 1991 to to 6.5 fish per trapnet in 1995.  The yellow perch population has increased from 0.1 fish per trapnet in 1991 to 21 fish per trapnet in 1995.  It appears the restoration efforts have had some impact on the fish community.To promote and maintain a healthy fish population, pollution and other inputs need to be controlled.  Fish habitat is directly affected by water quality.  Nutrient, sediment and other waste inputs can drastically alter the chemical and physical components of a Lake.  It is paramount to maintain if not improve the current water quality of South Heron Lake through watershed management to preserve this fishery for future generations to enjoy.   </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>The Heron Lake system includes 8,151 acres of meandered lake basin.  Seventy-eight percent of this acreage is included in North Heron (3,526 acres) and South Heron (2,845 acres).  The watershed comprises 472 square miles (302,080 acres).  With a ratio of about 45 acres of upland to each acre of water in the two large lakes and the marsh, the water supply far exceeds that needed to sustain them in most years.  In an average season, it is sufficient to fill both lakes almost three times and to fill them in slightly over thirty days during typical April flows.This area has a unique history.  Through the centuries, it provided habitat for vast numbers of waterfowl along with an abundance of aquatic fur bearers and other wildlife.  Named for the black-crowned night herons which nested on the lake in great numbers at the time of settlement, Heron Lake was also noted for large numbers of Franklin's gulls nesting there early in the century.In 1973, it was designated by the Commissioner of Natural Resources as a wildlife management lake following public hearings in the local area.  The goal is to improve the lake system for waterfowl, fur bearers, and numerous other species of game and nongame wildlife traditionally found in Southern Minnesota.  Effective management requires periodic but temporary water level draw-downs, such as occur during times of drought.  Extended periods of high water destroy the aquatic vegetation needed by wildlife.In 1989, the Heron Lake Watershed Restoration Project was initiated to stop and reverse degredation to Heron Lake and its watershed, and to return the area to a migratory bird production and migration area of international significance.  Partners of the project include Federal and State Agencies, local units of Government, national, state, and local conservation groups, and private industries.  Heron Lake is presently part of a Clean Water Partnership effort.  An extensive data gathering effort began in 1992 to understand watershed nutrient loading and lake response dynamics.  A report compiled at Mankato State University estimated that approximately 90% of the total phosphorus load in Heron Lake originates from the city of Worthington through Okabena Creek in low water years.Northern pike numbers are high compared to lakes similar to South Heron.  Northern pike numbers are up from 0.4 fish/net in 1991 to 10.3 fish/net in 1996.  Lengths of northern pike ranged from 17.5 to almost 38 inches.  The average length of northern pike was just over 28 inches whereas the average weight was almost 5 ? pounds.  Local anglers reported a 17 pound northern pike was caught during the summer of 1996.  The high numbers of northern pike in South Heron may reduce the natural reproductive success of common carp.  Yellow perch numbers are high compared to lakes similar to South Heron.  Lengths of yellow perch ranged from 5 to almost 13 inches and averaged almost 10 inches.  The average weight of yellow perch was ? pound.  Three strong year classes of yellow perch were observed during the survey.The common carp catch rates have declined from a high of 65.6 fish/net in 1991 to 5.9 fish/net in 1996.  Large numbers of small carp have been linked to poor water clarity and lack of vegetation in many lakes.  It appears the carp population is moving from many small carp to fewer large carp which may improve water clarity and increase the amount of vegetation in the lake.  The change in the carp population may be due to a combination of the fish barrier installed in 1991 and the high northern pike population.Black bullhead numbers are average compared to lakes similar to South Heron Lake.  Black bullhead catch rates decreased from 131.3 fish/net in 1995 to 44.2 fish/net in 1996.  Black bullhead lengths ranged from 4 to almost 13 inches and averaged about 7 inches.  The average weight of black bullhead was about 1/4 pound.Other fish species collected during the population assessment in 1996 included black crappie, bigmouth buffalo, brown bullhead, orangespotted sunfish, white sucker, and yellow bullhead.  Water depth appears to have an impact on sago pondweed abundance in South Heron Lake.  Abundant sago pondweed was documented in 1987 and 1995 when maximum depth was about 5 feet in July.  In 1995, it was estimated that approximately 70 to 80% of South Heron Lake was covered with submergent vegetation.  Water levels were 1.7 feet above the 1995 levels in 1996 and approximately 20% of the lake was covered with submergent vegetation.To promote and maintain a healthy fish population, pollution and other inputs need to be controlled.  Fish habitat is directly affected by water quality.  Nutrient, sediment and other waste inputs can drastically alter the chemical and physical components of a Lake.  It is paramount to maintain if not improve the current water quality of South Heron Lake through watershed management to preserve this fishery for future generations to enjoy.   </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>South Heron Lake is a 2,845-acre lake located two miles northwest of the City of Lakefield in Jackson County.  Heron Lake is a designated wildlife lake, therefore it is managed primarily for wildlife such as waterfowl, furbearers, and other game and non-game species.  Historically, drawdowns were used to encourage winterkill of undesirable fish species (Fathead Minnow, Common Carp, and Black Bullhead); however, drawdowns have not occurred for decades due to the dam gate being inoperable, weather patterns in combination of a large drainage area.  The new Heron Lake Management Plan, approved in December 2021, includes the stocking of predator fish (Walleye and Northern Pike) as an additional tool to control undesirable fish species.  This survey served two purposes, 1) to determine the extent of the winterkill that occurred during the winter of 2020-2021, as several reports of dead fish were received after ice-out in the spring of 2021, and 2) to document the fish community that was present when the new Heron Lake Management plan was adopted.  A targeted survey was conducted the week of May 12, 2021 using a gill net and two trap nets.  Water levels at the time of the survey were still extremely low due to drought conditions and therefore limited areas were conducive to netting.  <br> \n <br> \nIn 2021, the Northern Pike catch rate was 7.0 per gill net, which is within the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (1.2 to 7.8 per gill net).  Lengths of Northern Pike ranged from 11.9 to 31.9 inches and averaged 26.0 inches. Northern Pike fry (about 160,000) were stocked in the spring of 2021 to supplement the existing population.  <br> \n <br> \nThe Walleye catch rate was 5.0 per gill net, which is within the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (3.2 to 15.3 per gill net).  Lengths of Walleye ranged from 13.6 to 21.4 inches and averaged 18.2 inches.  South Heron Lake is stocked with Walleye when surplus fry are available.  South Heron Lake was stocked with 1.4 million Walleye fry in the spring of 2021.  <br> \n <br> \nThe Yellow Perch catch rate was 8.0 per gill net, which is within the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (3.0 to 22.5 per gill net).  Lengths of Yellow Perch ranged from 6.3 to 10.1 inches and averaged 7.9 inches.  Yellow Perch are not stocked because they maintain the population through natural reproduction or through upstream lake sources in Nobles and Murray County.   <br> \n <br> \nWhile reports of dead fish were received in the spring of 2021, it appears that the partial winterkill in South Heron Lake was minimal, as several species of fish were sampled in addition to the management species discussed above. Other species sampled included Bigmouth Buffalo, Black Bullhead, Common Carp, Yellow Bullhead, and Tadpole Madtom.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>South Heron Lake is a 2,845-acre lake located 2 miles northwest of the City of Lakefield.  Heron Lake is a designated wildlife lake, therefore it is managed primarily for wildlife such as waterfowl, furbearers, and other game and non-game species.  Water levels are typically lowered during the fall to encourage winterkill of undesirable fish species such as Common Carp and Black Bullheads because they destroy aquatic vegetation which is important for waterfowl.  A rotenone rehabilitation project was done during the winter of 1997-1998 to decimate fish populations; however, this effort was not as successful as desired.  Because this is a designated wildlife lake that is prone to frequent winterkills because of water level manipulation, fisheries management is focused on providing a \"boom or bust\" fishery that is predator heavy for control of rough fish populations.  From a fisheries perspective, Heron Lake is managed primarily for Northern Pike and secondarily for Walleye and Yellow Perch.  Northern Pike fry were stocked in 2016, 2021, and 2022. Walleye fry are stocked if there is a surplus available and have been stocked annually beginning in 2021.  A fisheries survey was conducted the week of May 22, 2023 to monitor fish populations using three gill nets and 10 trap nets.  <br> \n <br> \nSince 1994, Northern Pike catch rates have exceeded 22.0 per gill net and have averaged 13.9 per gill net since 1987.  The 2023 catch rate was significantly lower than historic catches at 1.3 per gill net but was still within the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (1.2 to 7.8 per gill net).  Northern Pike fry were stocked in 2021 and 2022; however, based on the 2023 catch rate the stockings appear to have been unsuccessful.  Northern Pike lengths ranged from 13.5 to 26.0 inches and averaged 18.3 inches.  Northern Pike will continue to be stocked when available. Be aware that there are zonal regulations for Northern Pike. In order to harvest a Northern Pike in southern Minnesota the fish must be over 24 inches with a limit of 2 fish.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye catch rates have been extremely high in South Heron Lake since 2011 (27.0 per gill net in 2011; 34.0 per gill net in 2017).  In 2023, the Walleye catch rate was 13.3 per gill net which is above the long-term average of 11.4 per gill net and is within the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (3.2 to 15.3 per gill net).  Lengths of Walleye ranged from 6.7 to 18.9 inches and averaged 9.4 inches.  All of the Walleye were from the 2022 stocking (age-1), except for one age-2 Walleye.  Age-1 walleyes ranged from 6.7 to 10.4 inches in length and averaged 9.1 inches, indicating fast growth.  If growth continues to be fast, Walleye could be to a harvestable size in a year or two.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch catch rates have varied from 1.7 per gill net in 1991 to 80.2 per gill net in 1993 and have averaged 37.2 per gill net since 1987.  In 2023, the South Heron Lake catch rate was 31.7 per gill net which exceeds the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (3.0 to 22.5 per gill net).  Yellow Perch lengths ranged from 4.9 to 9.6 inches and averaged 5.8 inches.  Ninety-six percent of Yellow Perch captured were from one year class and were less than 6.3 inches in length.  Yellow perch were plump suggesting that they will grow fast and should be harvestable in a couple of years. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Bullhead abundance remained below the long-term average of 60.6 per gill net, as it was 44.3 per gill net in 2023.  Black Bullhead lengths ranged from 3.9 to 11.1 inches and averaged 6.4 inches.  Common Carp abundance remained above the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (0.5 to 9.1 per gill net) at 10.0 per gill net in 2023.  The Bigmouth Buffalo catch rate in 2023 was 16.3 per gill net, exceeding the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (0.3 to 6.1 per gill net).  Other species sampled included Black Crappie, Common Shiner, Orangespotted Sunfish, Tadpole Madtom, and White Sucker. <br> \n</p>",
