Northern pike were sampled in the gill nets at a rate lower than in past assessments but still within the expected range for this type of lake.  These fish had a mean length of 22.2 inches and a mean weight of 2.8 pounds.     The gill net catch rate for black crappie was below the expected range but the trap net catch rate was within the expected range.  The crappie that were sampled ranged from 3.8 to 11.9 inches in length and had a mean length of 8.0 inches.  They appear to grow relatively slowly.     Largemouth bass were not sampled in gill nets and only a few were sampled in trap nets or while electrofishing.     Walleye were sampled at low rates, but this has historically been the case.       Yellow perch were also sampled in the gill nets at a rate below the expected rate.  They ranged from 5.5 to 9.1 inches in length.     Pumpkinseed sunfish and golden shiner were the only other species of fish sampled.   </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Pughole Lake is a class 35 lake located 13 miles north of Grand Rapids, MN.  The lake has one public access and moderate shoreline development.  The 1997 lake management plan indicates northern pike is the primary species of management with black crappie as the secondary species.Black crappie gill-net (1.5/net) and trap-net (0.8/net) catch rates were towards the lower end of normal range for this type of lake.  The gill-net catch was the second highest on record while the trap-net catch was the second lowest on record.  Gill-net captured fish ranged from 5.7 to 9.9 inches with an average length of 8.0 inches.  Trap-net captured fish ranged from 7.5 to 11.8 inches with an average length of 9.3 inches.  Seven year classes were identified from scales that ranged from two to eight years old.  Black crappie growth was slower than the statewide average in this assessment.The bluegill population has increased from very low numbers in 1975 to consistently exceeding the lake class median in the last three assessments.  In 2002, the trap-net catch was 12.8 fish/net.  Bluegill captured in trap nets ranged from 3.2 to 8.1 inches with an average length of 5.6 inches.  Age and growth information was not collected in this assessmentThe northern pike gill-net catch was 5.8 fish/net in 2002 which was below average for this type of lake.  Gill-net catch rates have declined from a high of 15.3 fish/net in 1977 to a low of 4.0 fish/net in 1996.  Low to moderate northern pike populations are desired because they typically have better size distribution and growth rates.  Northern pike ranged from 13.5 to 36.2 inches and had an average length of 21.6 inches in 2002.  Eight year classes were identified from cliethra bones and scales ranging from one to eight years old.  Northern pike averaged 21.7 inches after four years of growth compared to the statewide average of 20.5. Four walleye were sampled in this assessment which corresponds to a catch of 0.7 fish/net.  Walleye were last stocked in 1994 from which two of the four fish were aged.  Despite more frequent stocking of walleye in the past, walleye numbers have remained low.  Gill-net catch rates have never exceeded the 1st quartile of 1.0 fish/net.Yellow perch gill-net catch rates have generally been low, ranging from 1.0 to 5.0 fish/net in all assessments except 1989 (18.0 fish/net).  In 2002, the catch was 5.0 fish/net which was below average for this type of lake.  Fish ranged from 5.6 to 8.1 inches and averaged 6.5 inches.  Age and growth information was not collected in this assessment.Other species sampled during the population assessment included largemouth bass and pumpkinseed sunfish.In order to maintain or improve fish and wildlife populations, water quality and habitat must be protected.  People often associate water quality problems with large-scale agricultural, forestry, urban development or industrial practices in the watershed.  In reality, the impact of land use decisions on one lake lot may be relatively small, yet, the cumulative impact of those decisions on many lake lots can result in a significant decline in water quality and habitat.  For example, removing shoreline and aquatic vegetation, fertilizing lawns, mowing to the waters edge, installing beach sand blankets, failing septic systems and uncontrolled run-off, all contribute excess nutrients and sediment, which degrade water quality and habitat.  Understanding these cumulative impacts and taking steps to avoid or minimize them will help to insure our quality fisheries can be enjoyed by future generations.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Pughole Lake is a moderately developed lake located 13 miles north of Grand Rapids, MN in the Mississippi River watershed.  The lake has no inlets or outlets, and floating leaf vegetation is common.  Secchi disk transparency has varied from 6 to 9 feet with bog-stained water.  Pughole Lake is in ecological lake class 35.  Other area lakes in this class include Big Island and Scrapper Lakes. <br> \n <br> \nThe 2010 lake management plan (LMP) listed Northern Pike as the primary management species and Black Crappie as a secondary management species.  A standard lake survey was conducted in mid-July 2024 to update information on the fishery. <br> \n <br> \nPrevious surveys on Pughole have found moderate density and size structure of Northern Pike.  Management goals for both number and size were generally met.  In 2024, Northern Pike were captured at a typical rate for Pughole and lakes with similar habitat.  Size structure was favorable; sampled pike ranged from 19.0 to 33.2 inches with an average length of 24.9 inches.  Twenty-four percent of pike exceeded 28 inches.  Ages 2-11 were represented with ages 5 and 6 the most abundant.  Northern Pike averaged 23.7 inches at age 5. <br> \n <br> \nLike many northern Minnesota lakes, net catches for Black Crappie on Pughole have fluctuated over time.  Black Crappie trap net catches were just above average in 2024 and exceeded the management goal.  Size structure was modest as crappie ranged from 4.3 to 10.8 inches and averaged 8.5 inches.  Twenty-six percent of Black Crappie exceeded 10 inches.  Ages 2-7 were represented with no dominant year class.  Growth was moderate with crappie averaging 8.7 inches after 5 years of growth. <br> \n   <br> \nHistorically, Pughole Lake has produced moderate numbers of Bluegill with modest size structure.  The 2024 trap-net catch rate was average for the lake and lakes with similar habitat.  Size structure was fair with Bluegill ranging in size from 3.6 to 7.8 inches and averaged 5.9 inches.  About half the sampled Bluegill exceeded 6 inches.  Ages 3-9 were represented with no dominant year class.  Growth was moderate with Bluegill averaging 6.2 inches after 6 years of growth. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass were sampled in low numbers with fish ranging from 11.2 to 13.7 inches.  An electrofishing assessment conducted in 2009 indicated a moderate population of Largemouth Bass of modest size. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch are often an important prey species and catches have typically been low in Pughole Lake.  The 2024 catch was the lowest on record, suggesting a limited prey base. <br> \n <br> \nOne Walleye (20.4 inches) was sampled in the 2024 survey.  Past Walleye stocking failed to produce a meaningful fishery and that management was discontinued in 1997.  A marginal Walleye population may persist through natural reproduction. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled in 2024 included Golden Shiner, Hybrid Sunfish and Pumpkinseed. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Pughole Lake is a class 35 lake located 13 miles north of Grand Rapids, MN in the Mississippi River watershed.  The lake has a surface area of 152 acres, a maximum depth of 23 feet, and moderate shoreline development.  Pughole Lake is primarily managed for northern pike and panfish. <br> \n <br> \nThe 2009 northern pike gill-net catch was 3.8/net, below the lake class median but similar to the two previous assessments.  Northern pike size structure was fairly poor.  Sampled pike ranged from 16.9 to 33.5 inches with a mean length of 20.6 inches.  Ages 2-4, and 8 were identified from cleithra and scale samples.  Growth was similar to the statewide average with individuals growing to 21.4 inches in 4 years. <br> \n <br> \nThe black crappie trap-net catch rate remained near the lake class first quartile at 1.0/net.  Trap-net sampled fish ranged from 5.6 to 11.5 inches with a mean length of 9.5 inches.  Ages 2-4, 6 and 7 were identified from scale samples.  Growth was similar to the statewide average for all ages, with fish reaching 10.1 inches in 6 years. <br> \n <br> \nThe trap-net catch rate for bluegill remained within the expected range at 14.9/net.  Size structure was moderate with fish ranging from 3.3 to 8.8 inches, with a mean length of 7.1 inches.  Recruitment appeared consistent, with ages 2-8, and 10 represented in the sample.  Growth was similar to the lake class average for all ages, with fish growing to 6.9 inches in 6 years. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass are also fairly abundant in Pughole Lake.  Since traditional summer test-netting does not give a good representation of a lake's bass population, night electrofishing was conducted in June 2009.  This assessment recorded a moderate catch rate of 21 fish/hour of on-time.  Largemouth bass size structure was modest.  Sampled bass ranged from 8.2 to 17.0 inches with a mean length of 12.3 inches and a mean weight of 1.1 pounds.  Age analysis revealed fish from age 3-7, and 10 were represented.  Back-calculated lengths-at-age were similar to the statewide average for all ages, with fish reaching 14.6 inches in 6 years.   <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch gill-net catch rates have generally been low, and declined in the 2009 assessment to below the first quartile at 1.8/net.  Sampled perch ranged from 5.9 to 6.6 inches with a mean length of 6.2 inches. <br> \n <br> \nOne walleye (23 inches) was captured in a trap net in the most recent assessment.  Despite frequent stocking in the past, walleye catch rates never exceeded the lake class first quartile of 1.0/gill net in any assessments since 1965.  Walleye management was discontinued in 1997. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled in this assessment included pumpkinseed, hybrid sunfish and golden shiner.   <br> \n</p>",
