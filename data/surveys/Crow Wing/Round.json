Average size remained large, rising from 4.38 to 6.66 lbs.  The eight fish aged represented five age classes.  Bluegill abundance dropped from 81.6/trapnet in 1986 to 55.0 in 1991, but remained high for the lake class.  Median length remained at 5.5 inches.  Aging showed 5 year classes present with 28% being from the 1988 year class, and 43% from the 1987 year class. Growth was slow for these fish and bordered on slow for the 1984 and 85 year classes.  Largemouth bass (0.6/trapnet) were sampled in average numbers for the lake class.  Five age classes were well represented in trap and gillnet catches and growth was consistently good.  Black crappie numbers fell from a high 3.7/trapnet in 1986 to 0.7 in 1991.  Size averaged 0.4 lb, and fish from 6-12 inches long were sampled.  The 12 fish aged were from 4 age classes, 50% from the 1989 year class.  Growth appeared to be good.  Yellow perch catch (39.22/gillnet) was similar to 1986 and remained average for the lake class.  Median length remained at 6.0 inches with perch to 9.4 inches present in the sample.  Growth was consistently good for the five age classes sampled.  Fifty seven percent of the sample was from the 1989 year class and 27% from the 1988 year class.  Walleye (14.11/gillnet) remained abundant.  Age 1-8 were sampled and had good growth.  The most abundant year class (27%) was 1988, only year since 1975 without stocking.  The 1985-'87 and 1989 year classes each contributed between 9 and 19% to the sample, showing walleye survival to be good and fairly consistent.</p>",

Night electrofishing was conducted on September 21, 2010 to monitor the abundance of Young-of-Year (YOY) or age-0 walleyes.  The total sample time was 1.5 hours resulting in a YOY catch rate of 15.3 fish/hour.  The YOY catch rate has ranged from 0 to 86.7 fish/hour from 1999 to date.  The 2010 catch ranged from 6.1 to 7.7 inches and averaged 6.9 inches long.  Fish age 1 and older were caught at a rate of 41.3 fish/hour and ranged from 6.9 to 20.0 inches, averaging 11.1 inches long.  Age 1 and 2 fish were at least as abundant in the catch as were the YOY fish, a good sign for the future.  Ages 0-2 were the most abundant in the 2010 catch. \n\nIn an attempt to boost walleye abundance when necessary, fingerling stocking will be done, in addition to the annual fry stocking, no more frequently than every other year if the fall electrofishing catch of YOY walleyes is less than 15 fish/hour, as described in the signed Fisheries Lake Management Plan.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Round Lake is a 1,650 acre lake located just south of Nisswa in Crow Wing County.  The lake reaches depths of 51', with 38% of the lake less than 15' deep.  Water clarity is good with a secchi disk reading of 22'.  Although the lake is heavily developed, there are still large beds of emergent vegetation (primarily bulrush).  Protection of aquatic vegetation, especially emergent vegetation, is important for maintaining good water quality.  Aquatic vegetation is also critical for fish spawning areas as well as providing cover for fish. <br> \n <br> \nRound Lake is stocked annually with newly hatched walleye fry (627,000/year).  A contingency stocking also added 607 lbs or 13,890 walleye fingerlings in 2018, and 714 lbs (8,094 fingerlings and yearlings) in 2014.  The gillnet catch of 5.5 walleyes/net was average compared to similar lakes.  Average length was 16.1\", with 93% measuring at least 12.0\" in length. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike on Round Lake have had a 30\" minimum size limit since 2003.  The northern pike gill net catch of 5.9/net was average when compared to similar lakes.  Average length was 26.0\", with 15% measuring at least 30.0\" in length. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass were sampled by spring electrofishing at a low rate of 11.4/ hr. run-time.  Average length was 13.1\".  Six smallmouth bass were also sampled, with an average length of 15.4\". <br> \n <br> \nBluegills were caught in average numbers at 20.4/trap net.  Average length was 4.9\", and 12% were at least 7.0\" in length.  Yellow perch were also caught in average numbers at 21.5/gill net.  Most of the perch caught were too small to be of interest to anglers with an average length of 6.6\".  However there were a few larger individuals caught with the biggest measuring 10.4\".  Yellow perch are an important forage species, especially for walleyes and northern pike. <br> \n <br> \nRound Lake is designated as AIS (aquatic invasive species) infested waters because of zebra mussels.  Lake users are required to inspect and remove any aquatic plants and animals from their watercraft and trailers as well as pull the plug and drain all water from the watercraft, including bilges, livewells and baitwells. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Bowfin, yellow bullhead, brown bullhead, white sucker, pumpkinseed, black crappie and northern pike catches indicated average or expected populations since the respective catches all fell within the first and third quartiles of the range around the median for region 3. Catches lower than the first quartile included only green sunfish and largemouth bass. Walleye, yellow perch, northern cisco, rock bass and bluegill exhibit high populations since the respective catch rates fell above the third quartile. Walleye were sampled at a rate considerably higher than both the statewide and local medians. The sample of largemouth bass from gillnets was relatively large however, due to net bias, other means of sampling are necessary to make an evaluation of the population with confidence. Based on catches from gillnets, the walleye population has increased significantly while the northern pike numbers have decreased and yellow perch have experienced a slight increase. Walleye aged was represented by age classes 2 through 7. The population structure appears to be bimodal with strong year class representation an annulus 2, 3 and 5. Year class 2 is the strongest class with 28 fish sampled. Generally growth is good through all year classes considering both at last annulus formation and back calculated lengths. The range in length in 1981 was 11.5 inches to 24.9 inches while the range in 1986 was 9.0 inches to 29.9 inches. The mean weight in 1981 was 2.4 lbs while it had decreased to 2.1 lbs in 1986. The yellow perch population has increased since 1981, however, not significantly enough to state with confidence. Four year classes were represented, of which year classes 4-6 were strongest and somewhat equal. By use of back calculated sizes, it appears as though growth is slow the first three years, however growth at annulus 4-6 is good. The length of fish sampled in 1981 was 5.0-9.9 inches with 45 of 292 fish, or 15.4%, being 7.0 inches or longer. In 1986 the length range was 4.0-9.9 inches with 75 of 270 fish or 28% being 7.0 inches or longer. Northern pike indicated age classes 2-6. Ages 3 and 4 represented the strongest year classes. Growth throughout the year classes as well as back-calculated lengths was good. There has been a significant decrease in the northern pike population which is reflected in the mean weight. In 1981 the mean weight was 3.7 lbs, while in 1986 it was 4.4 lbs. The length frequency has not shifted, however, fewer fish was sampled. Largemouth bass indicated the presence of five year classes, all of which were sampled with low frequency. The only prudent statement about the population is that the growth of the fish sampled was good. Bluegill numbers appear to have increased though not significantly. The length frequency distribution has not changed notably, however, in 1981 21.3% of the fish sampled were 7.0 inches or longer compared to only 17.4% in 1986. The shift toward smaller fish or fewer large fish is evident in the mean weight. In 1981 the fish sampled were 4.7/lb compared to a considerably smaller 7.0/lb in 1986. Growth of bluegills in all year classes sampled and back-calculated sizes was slow. Black crappie averaged 0.3 lb with a length frequency distribution of 7.0-11.9 inches. Thirty three percent of the crappies sampled were 9.0 inches or greater in length. Growth analysis for the age classes sampled was good as was growth for back calculated lengths at annulus 1-5. The northern cisco population exhibits a bimodal length frequency distribution according to the 1986 test netting data. The 1981 survey results bear out much the same configuration, however, trimodal instead of bimodal.</p>",

A special assessment was done on June 28, 2010 to check the status of the walleye and northern pike populations, as well as related forage species.  Numbers of both fish looked good.  Walleye were caught at a rate of 6.3/net and averaged 15.4\".  Northern pike were caught at a rate of 5.0/net and had a good average size (26.3\" and 4.2 lbs.). <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch and tullibee (cisco) are important forage fish for walleyes and northern pike.  The yellow perch catch was the lowest to date (18.7/net), but still acceptable for this lake type.  Tullibees (cisco) were also caught in average numbers.  Other fish species sampled included black crappie, bluegill, burbot, hybrid sunfish, largemouth bass, pumpkinseed, rock bass, white sucker, and yellow bullhead. <br> \n <br> \n*Note:  Zebra mussels are now in connected Gull Lake.  Please remember to follow all laws when entering and leaving Round and connected lakes.  Pull all your drain plugs, inspect and clean your boat thoroughly, and dispose of unused bait before leaving this lake so these exotics aren't spread elsewhere.  It is also recommended to spray/rinse your boat with hot water (above 120 F) or let it dry at least five days. <br> \n</p>",

Fingerling stocking is done on a contingency basis and was last done in 2021.  Night electrofishing was conducted on September 14, 2021, to monitor the abundance of young-of-the-year (YOY) Walleyes.  The total sample time was 2 hours, which resulted in a catch rate of 4.0/hour run-time.  Walleyes age 1 and older were sampled at a rate of 9.0/hour run-time.  These fish ranged in size from 17.4\" to 27.9\" and had a mean length of 21.3\".</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Round Lake is a 1,650 acre lake located just south of Nisswa in Crow Wing County.  The lake reaches depths of 51', with 38% of the lake less than 15' deep.  Water clarity is good with a secchi disk reading of 16'.  Although the lake is heavily developed, there are still large beds of emergent vegetation (primarily bulrush).  Protection of aquatic vegetation, especially emergent vegetation, is important for maintaining good water quality.  Aquatic vegetation is also critical for fish spawning areas as well as providing cover for fish. <br> \n <br> \nRound Lake is stocked annually with newly hatched Walleye fry (627,000/year).  A contingency stocking also added 596 lbs or 3,187 Walleye fingerlings in 2021.  The gillnet catch of 7.3 Walleyes/net was average compared to similar lakes.  Average length was 16.7\", with 74% measuring at least 12.0\" in length. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike on Round Lake have had a 30\" minimum size limit since 2003.  The Northern Pike gill net catch of 2.3/net was below average when compared to similar lakes.  Average length was 23.5\", with 46% measuring at least 24.0\" in length.  Only 1 Northern Pike over 30.0\" was sampled. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch were also caught in average numbers at 26.4/gill net.  Most of the perch caught were too small to be of interest to anglers with an average length of 7.0\".  However, there were a few larger individuals caught with the biggest measuring 11.1\".  Yellow Perch are an important forage species, especially for Walleye and Northern Pike. <br> \n <br> \nRound Lake is designated as AIS (aquatic invasive species) infested waters because of zebra mussels.  Lake users are required to inspect and remove any aquatic plants and animals from their watercraft and trailers as well as pull the plug and drain all water from the watercraft, including bilges, livewells and baitwells. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Round Lake is a 1,644 acre lake located just south of Nisswa in Crow Wing County.  The lake reaches depths of 51 feet, with 38% of the lake less than 15 feet deep.  Water clarity is good with a secchi disk reading of 12 feet.  Although the lake is heavily developed, there are still large beds of emergent vegetation (primarily bulrush).  Protection of aquatic vegetation, especially emergent vegetation, is important for maintaining good water quality.  Aquatic vegetation is also critical for fish spawning areas as well as providing cover for fish. <br> \n <br> \nRound Lake is stocked annually with walleye fry.  The 2013 gillnet catch of 7.3 walleyes/gillnet was average compared to similar lakes.   Past survey have had catch rate from 2.9/gillnet (2004) up to 14.1/gillnet (1991).  Average size was 13.4 inches and 1.1 lbs, with walleyes up to 26.3 inches captured.  Two year old fish (2011 year class) made up 50% of the catch.  These fish were between nine and eleven inches during the July survey. <br> \n <br> \nRound Lake has a 30-inch minimum size limit on northern pike which was established in 2003.  The northern pike gillnet catch of 13.3/gillnet was above average, and the highest to date.  Average size was 24.0 inches and 3.2 lbs.  Fish at least 24 inches long accounted for 40% of the catch, and 10% were 30 inches or greater.  Northern pike up to 37.4 inches were captured.   <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass were sampled by a spring electrofishing survey at a rate of 59.4/ hr. run-time.  Average length was 12.6 inches.  Black crappies were caught in low numbers in both gillnets and trapnets.  For both gears combined, 71% of the black crappies were at least 8 inches in length. <br> \n <br> \nBluegills were caught in average numbers at 12.3/trapnet.  Average length was 5.1 inches, and 21% were seven inches or greater.   Yellow perch were also caught in average numbers at 29.7/ gillnet.  Most of the perch caught were too small to be of interest to anglers at an average length of 6.9 inches. However there were a few larger individuals caught with the biggest measuring 9.8 inches.  Yellow perch are an important prey species, especially for walleyes and northern pike. <br> \n <br> \nRound Lake is designated as AIS (aquatic invasive species) infested waters because of zebra mussels.  Lake users should inspect and remove any aquatic plants and animals from their watercraft and trailers as well as pull the plug and drain all water from the watercraft, including bilges, livewells and baitwells. <br> \n</p>",

Night electrofishing was conducted on September 16th, 2013 to monitor the abundance of young-of-year (YOY) walleyes.  The total sample time was 1 hour and 28 minutes, resulting in a YOY catch rate of 8.9/hr run-time.  Previous catches have ranged from 0 to 86.7 fish/hr from 1999 to date.  The 2013 YOY catch ranged in length from 5.9 to 7.3 inches, with a mean length of 6.4 inches.  Fish age 1 and older were caught at a rate of 54.6/hr run-time.  These fish ranged in size from 8.1 to 26.3 inches and had a mean length of 11.7 inches. <br> \n <br> \nAs described in the Fisheries Lake Management Plan, should the 2014 catch rate of YOY walleye not reach 15 YOY/hr, fall fingerling will be stocked in 2014 in addition to annual fry stocking in an attempt to boost walleye abundance. <br> \n</p>",

The lake is heavily developed with 36.4 homes/cabins per shoreline mile as of 1991.  A public access is located on the south side of the lake.  The maximum depth is 51' and about 38% of the lake is 15' deep or less.  Shallow water substrate is primarily sand, although areas of gravel, rubble, and boulders are also present.  The aquatic plant community is relatively diverse with 31 species present and is critical to maintaining healthy fish populations.  Emergent plants such as bulrush are important for shoreline protection, maintaining water quality, and provide essential spawning habitat for bass and panfish species.  Submerged plants provide food and cover needed by fish and other aquatic species.  \n\nWalleyes were caught in relatively low numbers in 2007 at 3.3/gill net.  Average length and weight were 14.8\" and 1.3 lbs.  Eleven year classes were sampled with age 2 fish (2005) accounting for 49% of the gill net catch.  These fish measured approximately 11\" to 13\" at the time of the survey.  \n\nNorthern pike abundance in 2007 was typical of past catches on this and similar lakes at 3.7/gill net.  Average length and weight were 25.4\" and 3.7 lbs.  Growth was good with 65% of these fish measuring at least 24\". Spring electrofishing for largemouth bass resulted in a catch rate of 64/hr run-time.   Mean length of these fish was 11.1\" with a PSD of 41 and an RSD-P of 8.  Two smallmouth bass were also sampled \n\nBlack crappie abundance in gill nets was relatively high at 2.9/gill net, while in trap nets it was the lowest to date at 0.4/trap net.  The bluegill catch of 44.9/trap net was typical of past catches on this and similar lakes.  Yellow perch and tullibee are important forage species for the lake's gamefish.  The 2007 catch of 22.5 perch/gill net was the lowest since 1942, but is still above the lake class median.  Historical abundance of tullibee prior to 2004 has ranged from 2.8 to 9.1/gill net.  No tullibee were sampled in 2004 and only 2 were sampled in 2007 (0.1/gill net).  \n</p>",

Night electrofishing was conducted on September 21, 2016 to monitor the abundance of young-of-the-year (YOY) walleyes.  The abundance of YOY walleyes can be an early indicator of the strength of the year class.  Walleye fingerlings are stocked in the fall when fall YOY are sampled below 15/hr for 2 consecutive years in accordance with the fisheries lake management plan.  This last occurred in 2014.  The total sample time was 1 hour and 29 minutes, which resulted in a YOY catch rate of 35.7/hr run.  Previous catches have ranged from 0 to 86.7/hr.  The YOY walleyes ranged in size from 6.2\" to 8.6\", with an average length of 7.6\".  Walleyes age 1 and older were sampled at a rate of 18.2/hr.  These fish ranged in size from 12.0\" to 19.4\" and had an average length of 15.9\".</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Round is a 1,644 acre lake located about five miles south of Nisswa.  A public access is located on the south side.  Maximum depth is 51 feet and about 38% of the lake is shallower than 15 feet.  Round is a hardwater lake with moderate phosphorus fertility.  Water clarity is typical for area lakes.  Shallow water soils are predominately sand, with some areas of gravel, boulder and rubble sized rock.  The aquatic plant community is fairly diverse.  Emergent species are important.  Species like bulrush help prevent erosion caused by wave action, help to control excess nutrients and improve the quality of spawning habitat for bass and panfish species.  Wild rice often provides quality spawning habitat for northern pike, especially when found in shallow water.  Submergent species provide food and cover for a wide variety of aquatic species.Walleyes were the most abundant gamefish sampled in the 1996 test netting.  Walleyes have been stocked, usually as fry, on a nearly annual basis since 1976.  In 1994, the walleye stocking frequency was changed to alternate years in order to obtain more information about natural reproduction and survival of stocked fry.  The 1996 walleye catch was in the \"high\" category when compared with similar type lakes, as it was the previous two nettings.  Nine year classes were sampled and growth was good.  Average size was 16 inches and 1.5 lbs., similar to 1991 results.The northern pike catch was in the \"low\" category in 1996, as it was in the 1986 and '91 nettings, but appeared \"typical\" for Round Lake.  Four age classes were sampled and growth was generally fast.  Average size was 24 inches and 4.5 lbs., smaller than the 1991 average but similar to the 1986 values.Largemouth bass were taken in numbers which bordered on \"low\" for the lake class but in numbers similar to previous catches in Round.  The three bass sampled were from three different year classes.  Young bass were common in shoalwater seine hauls made in mid-August.Bluegills were caught in \"average\" numbers in 1996 but have generally been caught in \"high\" numbers in past nettings.  Seven age classes were sampled and growth was good.  About 33% of bluegills measured from trapnets were at least 7.0 inches long, compared to 7% in '91 and 17% in '86.  Black crappies were taken in \"average\" numbers in '96, as they were in most previous nettings.  Crappie growth was fast and most were from the 1994 year class.Yellow perch, white suckers and tullibees are important food fish for the lake's gamefish.  Perch were sampled in \"average\" numbers in 1991 and 1996.  Seven age classes were sampled and growth was good.  Young perch were numerous in shoalwater seine hauls.  White suckers were caught in \"high\" numbers in '96, compared to an \"average\" catch rate in '91.  Tullibees were caught in \"average\" numbers in both '91 and '96.Other species sampled in 1996 included \"low\" numbers of pumpkinseeds, black bullheads and brown bullheads.  Burbot, bowfin (dogfish), common carp, and yellow bullheads were found in \"average\" numbers.  Rock bass were present in \"high\" numbers.  Overall, the lake appears to have a diverse and fairly well balanced fish population.</p>",

Sampling stations were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at all 18 stations. A 15-foot seine was used to sample one station and a 50-foot seine was used to sample 17 stations. Nearshore sampling captured 17 native fish species with including six species (Banded Killifish, Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, Mimic Shiner, Rock Bass, and Smallmouth Bass) intolerant of habitat disturbance and one species (Green Sunfish) that is tolerant of disturbance. <br> \n <br> \nData from this targeted nearshore survey is combined with data from standard gill and trap netting surveys to calculate a Fish-based Index of Biological Integrity (FIBI) score that describes the overall health of the lake. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment.  The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. The FIBI score for Round Lake based on this survey is above the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes.   <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Crow Wing River Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Round Lake is 1,644 acres and is located about 5 miles south of Nisswa in Crow Wing County.  A public access is located on the south side of the lake.  It has a maximum depth of 51 feet and 38% of the lake is less than 15 feet deep.  Shallow water substrate is primarily sand with occasional areas of gravel, boulders, or rubble sized rock.  The aquatic plant community is relatively diverse with 31 species present.  Emergent plants such as bulrush and wild rice are important for shoreline protection, maintaining water quality, and provide essential spawning habitat for northern pike, bass, and panfish species.  Submerged plants provide food and cover needed by fish and other aquatic species.Walleyes have been stocked on a nearly annual basis since 1976.  Fry stocking was most common although a few fingerling stockings occurred as well.  Walleye were caught in average numbers, at 4.3/gill net, in 2001 and in numbers similar to catches prior to 1986.  Walleye abundance in 3 nettings from 1986-1996 was above average.  The 1999 year class was the strongest and accounted for 47% of the fish caught.  Recent creel survey information indicates that this year class will be commonly caught by anglers in 2002.  Year classes when stocking was not done accounted for 20% of the sample.  Average length and weight decreased to 14.7\" and 1.3lbs from 15.8\" and 1.5lbs in 1996.  Fall electrofishing indicated resonable survival of young-of-the-year walleyes, which ranged in size from 5.8\" to 7.1\" in mid September.The northern pike catch was 4.2/gill net and was average when compared to similar lakes.  The catch has been below average in the 3 nettings from 1986 to 1996.  Compared to 1996, the average length increased from 24\" to 25\", but average weight dropped from 4.5lbs to 3.8lbs.Largemouth bass were sampled in average numbers (0.8/trap net) when compared to similar lakes.  Past catches have ranged from 0.1 to 1.2/trap net.  Average weight was 0.6lbs and 27% of all largemouth bass measured were 12\" or larger.The bluegill catch of 64.1/trap net was above average for similar lakes and was comparable to typical catches on Round Lake.  The 1997 and 1998 year classes were most abundant and accounted for 81% of the fish sampled.  Growth was average and 8% of bluegills measured in trap nets were 7\" or larger.  Black crappie abundance was average in 2001 at 1.9/trap net.  The 1996 and 1997 year classes comprised 67% of the catch.  Growth was fast through the first two years and average thereafter.  Average weight was 0.6lbs and 94% of the fish sampled were 8\" or larger.Yellow perch, tullibees, and white suckers provide an important source of food for the lake's game fish.  Yellow perch were present in above average numbers and were more abundant than previous nettings to date.  The 1996 and 1998 year classes accounted for 85% of the catch.  Tullibee and white sucker abundance was average for the lake class at 3.3/gill net and 2.7/gill net, respectively.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Round Lake is a 1,644 acre lake located just south of Nisswa in Crow Wing County.  The lake reaches depths of 51', with 38% of the lake less than 15' deep.  Water clarity is good with a secchi disk reading of 13'.  Although the lake is heavily developed, there are still large beds of emergent vegetation (primarily bulrush).  Protection of aquatic vegetation, especially emergent vegetation, is important for maintaining good water quality.  Vegetation is also critical for fish spawning areas as well as providing cover for fish. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye fry are stocked annually into Round Lake (627,000 fry/year).  A contingency stocking in 2014 also added 714 lbs of fingerlings and yearling walleyes.  The walleye gillnet catch was average at 4.9/net when compared to similar lakes.  Average length was 15.5\", with 90% at least 12\" in length.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike have had a 30\" minimum size limit in place since 2003.  The northern pike gillnet catch of 3.5/net was average when compared to similar lakes.  Average length was 23.9\" and 43% of the catch measured at least 24\" in length. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch are an important forage fish for walleye and northern and were sampled in average numbers compared to similar lakes and well above average for lakes in this area at 19.7/gillnet.  Most ran on the small side with an average length of 6.9\".  Perch up to 10.1\" were sampled, with 19% measuring at least 8\" in length. <br> \n <br> \nFollowing a robust public input process, muskellunge management in the Gull Chain was initiated in the fall of 2016 with the stocking of 2,000 fingerlings into Gull Lake.  A viable fishery can be expected to develop in roughly 8-10 years.   <br> \n <br> \nRound Lake is designated as AIS (aquatic invasive species) infested waters because of zebra mussels.  Lake users are required to inspect and remove any aquatic plants and animals from their watercraft and trailers as well as pull the plug and drain all water from the watercraft, including bilges, livewells and baitwells. <br> \n</p>",

Annual night electrofishing was conducted on September 19, 2018 to monitor the abundance of young-of-the-year (YOY) walleyes.  Fall electrofishing on Round Lake is used to determine whether additional fingerling (4\"-6\") walleye stocking is needed.  Because YOY numbers were less than 15 per hour in two consecutive years (2017 and 2018), 13,890 fingerling walleyes were stocked in October 2018.  It takes roughly 3 years for walleyes in Round Lake to reach \"keeper\" size.  While only one YOY walleye was sampled, age 1 and older walleyes were sampled at the rate of 20/hr.  These fish ranged in size from 11.6\" to 25.2\" and had an average length of 17.7\".</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of nearshore fish species in Round Lake was conducted on July 25-29, 2019 by Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program Staff.  Eighteen sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot seine.  Nearshore sampling captured 23 species of fish including eight species that are intolerant of disturbance (i.e., Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, Longnose Dace, Mimic Shiner, Rock Bass, and Smallmouth Bass) and two that are tolerant of disturbance (i.e., Black Bullhead and Fathead Minnow). <br> \n <br> \nA concurrent summer trap net survey was conducted on July 29-31, 2019 by IBI Program Staff. Fifteen trap nets were set along the shoreline and in shallow offshore locations that encompassed multiple habitat types.  Bluegill, Pumpkinseed, Rock Bass, and Largemouth Bass comprised a majority of the trap net catch by number and Bluegill comprised a majority of the catch by biomass. The number of Bluegill sampled per net was above the 50% quartile for similar Lake Class 27 lakes and the average length was 5.4 inches, with 9% over 7 inches. Conversely, the number of Black Crappie sampled per net was below the 25% quartile for Lake Class 27 lakes. <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore and trap net data were combined with gill net data from a July 2019 survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based IBI (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment.  In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g., Blackchin Shiner, Iowa Darter, and Rock Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g., Black Bullhead, Fathead Minnow, and Green Sunfish).  The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake.  An additional survey was completed on Round Lake in June 2019 that resulted in a similar FIBI score.  For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.   <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey indicates Round Lake is in good health as indicated by an FIBI score above the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes.  Data from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Crow Wing River Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.</p>",

Fingerling stocking is done on a contingency basis and was last done in 2021.  Night electrofishing was conducted on September 19, 2022, to monitor the abundance of young-of-the-year (YOY) Walleyes.  The total sample time was 2 hours, which resulted in a catch rate of 1.5/hour run-time (3 fish).  Walleyes age 1 and older were sampled at a rate of 16.0/hour run-time.  These fish ranged in size from 10.9\" to 25.1\" and had a mean length of 18.0\".</p>",

Fingerling stocking is done on a contingency basis and was last done in 2023.  Night electrofishing was conducted on September 12, 2023, to monitor the abundance of young-of-the-year (YOY) Walleyes.  The total sample time was 2 hours and 20 minutes in which no YOY Walleyes were captured.  Walleyes age 1 and older were sampled at a rate of 11.1/hour run-time.  These fish ranged in size from 14.7\" to 24.6\" and had a mean length of 18.5\".  One Muskellunge was also captured and measured 17.9\".</p>",
