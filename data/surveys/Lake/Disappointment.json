                "narrative": "<p>Disappointment Lake is in Ecological Lake Class 7, which consists of 41 lakes in northeast Minnesota that are large, have irregular shoreline shapes, and have very soft (unmineralized) water.  Disappointment Lake is typical of lakes in this lake class except that it is smaller (867 acres) than the lake class average of 1,807 acres.Disappointment Lake was thermally stratified on 09/07/99 with an abrupt thermocline that retained 6 ppm oxygen to a depth of 22 ft, where the temperature was 68 F, but dropped to 1 ppm oxygen at a depth of 23 ft, where the temperature was 64 F.  Fish need a minimum of 2 ppm oxygen to survive.  Inlets drain local swamps and ponds.  The outlet to Parent Lake has a beaver dam which limits fish movement.  Lake bottom substrates along the shoreline are mostly rubble, boulder, and ledgerock.  Aquatic plants are sparse and grow to a depth of 10 ft.The total catch of fish (all species combined) in 1999 of 8 fish/net (21 lb/net) was lower than normal for this lake class and was lower than the median catch of 20 fish/net (27 lb/net) in seven previous assessments on this lake dating back to 1950.  Lower numbers of cisco and white sucker were captured in 1999 than in most previous assessments.  Fish populations in 1999 were dominated by walleye and northern pike.Walleye numbers in 1999 (3/net) were normal for this lake class and were at the median catch of 3/net (range: 2-6/net) in previous assessments on this lake.  Walleye sizes in 1999 averaged 18\" (3 lb), which is larger than normal for this lake class.  The largest walleye was 29.7\" (9.6 lb).  Walleye were present from many year classes, indicating good natural reproduction.  Walleye growth was faster than normal for area lakes.Northern pike numbers in 1999 (2/net) were normal for this lake class and were also at the median catch of 2/net (range: 1-2/net) in previous assessments on this lake.  Pike sizes in 1999 averaged 26\" (4.8 lb), which is larger than normal for this lake class.  The largest pike was 39.2\" (14.3 lb).  Reproduction of pike was good.  Pike growth was normal for this lake class.Cisco numbers in 1999 (1/net) were lower than normal for this lake class and were lower than the median catch of 9/net (range: 1-31/net) in previous assessments on this lake.  Cisco sizes in 1999 averaged 12\"; the largest was 15.4\".White sucker numbers in 1999 (0.2/net) were lower than normal for this lake class and were lower than the median catch of 2/net (range: 0.6-18/net) in previous assessments on this lake.  Sucker sizes in 1999 averaged 16\"; the largest was 17.6\".Other fish species captured in 1999 were present in the low numbers that are typical for this lake.  </p>",

Low numbers of white sucker, rock bass, largemouth bass, and yellow perch were also captured.Cisco sizes ranged from 8\" to 18\" and averaged 11.9\".  Some large northern pike (36\") and walleye (over 25\") were present.Recruitment of the major species is good.  Smallmouth bass growth (8.1\" at Annulus V) is slow by area standards.  Growth of northern pike and yellow perch is average.  Walleye growth is average at Annulus II (9.8\"), but is faster than average thereafter (14.7\" at Annulus III; 16.7\" at Annulus IV).Populations of all fish averaged 25.1 fish/gill net (27.8 lbs/gill net).</p>",
