The ages of the nine walleyes taken in nets indicate that natural reproduction is contributing to the population but is apparently not sufficient to sustain it. Natural reproduction is verified by the presence of young of the year walleyes in late June shoreline seining.  Growth rates for walleyes appear to be substantially below the average for this area.  Slow growth is possibly responsible for the absence of the walleye fingerlings stocked in 1984 and 1985 as they may not yet be susceptible to the gillnet.  Northern pike (0.25/set) remain at low levels consistent with previous surveys and still well below the local median (3.88/set). The yellow perch (3.83/set) is substantially below the local median (24.27/set and has shown a real decline from the 1981 survey (8.92/set). Yellow perch have a mean length of 7.4 inches. Large numbers of young of the year yellow perch were found during late June shoreline seining. Only one muskellunge (21 inches) was taken in the gillnet.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>  In June of 1990 a lake survey was conducted on Cross Lake to assess the fish population status.  Netting consisted of 12 gillnet and 8 trapnet sets and shoreline seining efforts.  Night shoreline electrofishing in early September took place to gather more data on the walleye relative abundance due to low catches during the survey.  Based on the results of these efforts, the status of the fish population compared to previous surveys and to lakes of the same classification statewide are as follows: \n  The walleye (0.25/set) net catch has shown a real decrease from the net catch of the previous survey in 1987 (0.50/set).  This catch exhibits a population lower than the statewide median catch (2.28/set) and falls below the first quartile (1.00/set).  Because the gillnet catch was a small sample (3 walleyes), electrofishing techniques were used to gather more information.  During electrofishing, 89 walleyes were captured.  The length frequency distribution ranged from 5.0 - 21.9 inches with a median length group of 9.0 - 9.4 inches.  Sixty-five (65) fish from this sample were aged between I-VII with 94% being ages I-III.  The fish in age classes I and II grew at normal rates.  Age classes III and IV grew at rates slower than normal.  Overall, walleye growth rates have increased slightly from the slow growth indicated in the 1987 survey.  Early shoreline seining checks in June failed to find any young-of-year walleyes, however, natural reproduction was evidenced in previous surveys.  Annual walleye fingerling stocking for Cross Lake has taken place since 1984, with the exception of 1986.  According to recent surveying techniques, there does not appear to be any positive impact on the walleye population, due to stocking.\n  Although the walleye net catches were low, additional information pertaining to the fish population status should be credited.  For example, the DNR creel census conducted on Cross Lake in 1988 recorded a high walleye catch rate of 1.04 walleyes /hour.  Comparative catch rates from two popular walleye lakes in Minnesota, Mille Lacs Lake and Lake of the Woods, recorded catch rates of 0.17 walleyes/hour and 0.30 walleyes/hour, respectively. \n  The northern pike (1.08/set) net catch has shown a real increase from the 1987 catch (0.25/set).  Historically, populations have been low as this catch was lower than the statewide median (3.43/set) and the first quartile (1.75/set).  The length frequency distribution ranged from 13.0 - 31.9 inches with a median length group of 24.0 to 24.9 inches. Mean weight was 4.5 pounds.  Age classes III-IX were represented by the sample and all expressed growth rates similar to normal. \n  The white crappie (31.62/set) catch was substantially higher than the statewide median (1.60/ set) and well above the third quartile (5.33/set).  White crappies were not present in trapnet catches during the 1987 survey.  Past surveys indicate that the trapnet catches were below 2.00/set.  The length frequency distribution ranged from 7.0 - 9.9 inches with a median length of 8.0 - 8.4 inches.  Age classes I-IV were represented by the sample and growth rates expressed normal to fast growth. \n  The black crappie (1.50/set) catch was up slightly from the previous survey (1.00/set) but lower than the statewide median (5.86/set) and falls below the first quartile (1.75/set).  The length frequency distribution ranged from 7.0 - 8.9 inches with a median length group of 8.0 - 8.4 inches. Growth rates were normal. \n  Largemouth and smallmouth bass, for the most part, have shown up in gillnet or trapnet sets only a few times dating back to 1955.  Shoreline seining has always recorded natural reproduction numbers to be low for largemouth bass.  The necessary suitable habitat in the lake appears to be limited.  Electrofishing recorded 6 largemouth bass and 8 smallmouth bass during the total shocking time of 7.12 hours. \n  The yellow perch (7.08/set) net catch showed a real increase from the 1987 catch (3.83/set).  Historically, the net catches were similar to the statewide median catch (12.75/set) except in 1987, where it fell below the first quartile (4.91/set).  The length frequency distribution ranged from 6.5 - 9.4 inches with a median length group of 8.0 - 8.4 inches.  Mean weight was 0.34 pounds.\n  The bluegill (5.88/set) catch was up from the previous survey (2.00/set) but lower than the statewide median (21.79/set) and falls below the first quartile (6.37/set).  The lengths ranged from 4.5 - 9.4 inches.  Historically, bluegill catches were considered low. \n  The channel catfish (0.83/set) net catch dropped from the previous survey net catch (4.58/set).  The length frequency distribution ranged from 12.0 - 26.9 inches.  Age classes III and V-VIII were represented by this sample.\n  Carp have been of concern in Cross Lake.  Removal by netting was attempted several times by State crews.  Since 1984, commercial fishing has removed 441,025 pounds of carp, yet, the survey net catches have not shown any impact to this removal.  In fact, net catches have slightly increased and the length frequencies remained similar to the past surveys. The 1990 net catch (2.62/set) was up from the previous survey (1.80/set) and higher than the statewide median and third quartile, 1.00/set and 2.25/set, respectively. \n  Like the carp, most anglers do not desire to harvest freshwater drum.  The drum net catch (4.75/set) was down from the 1987 catch (11.42/set) and lower than the statewide median and first quartile, 14.92/set and 7.00/set, respectively. \n  Ten (10) other species captured by gillnets and trapnets included:  lake sturgeon, muskellunge, quillback, white sucker, silver redhorse, golden redhorse, shorthead redhorse, black bullhead, yellow bullhead, and rock bass.  All species were not significantly above or below the statewide median catch, except the bullheads.  The black and yellow bullheads were lower than their first quartiles.\n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Cross Lake is a fertile 943 acre lake located near the town of Pine City, MN in southern Pine County. The lake and its fish community are largely influenced by the Snake River that runs through the southern portion. The lake is primarily managed for Walleye and Muskellunge.  Around 500 pounds of Walleye fingerlings and 500 Muskellunge fingerlings are stocked annually. The shore is predominantly sand and is highly developed especially the west shore.  Public access is available on the river just west of the lake and on the east shore near the river outlet. Anglers on Cross Lake should expect moderate to high user pressure from both fishing and recreational boating.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye catch rates have typically been low in Cross Lake despite substantial fingerling stocking from 1984 to 1991 and from 2001 to the present.  Walleye sampled during this survey ranged from 9.4 to 11.0 inches. Mean weight, 0.4 pounds, was below average when compared to similar lakes.   <br> \n <br> \nMuskellunge are not sampled effectively during typical fish population assessments conducted during the summer.  During 2009 a special assessment was conducted during the spring using large trap nets to target Muskellunge. A total of 47 Muskellunge were observed during the survey.  Mean length of sampled fish was 44 inches and lengths ranged from 35.1 to 51.0 inches.  Density was determined to be low, but if you catch one, the chances are that it will be large as 41 out of 47 fish were greater than 40 inches and 5 fish were greater than 50 inches. <br> \n <br> \nThe Northern Pike gill net catch of 0.7 per net was similar to the past two surveys in 2010 and 2005 and remained low when compared to similar lakes. Northern Pike caught in gill nets ranged from 13.5 to 33.4 inches with a mean of 23.0 inches. The mean weight of 3.2 pounds is above average. Catch rates of Northern Pike have typically been low in Cross Lake, with catch rates less than 1.2 fish per net in 7 of the last 9 surveys conducted since 1981. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie catch rates were high when compared to similar lakes. Gill net catch rates have continued on an increasing trend over the last 30 years, while trap net catch rates don't show any apparent trend.  White Crappie on the other hand were observed at historic lows during the 2014 survey at 0.2 per gill net. Some quality sized Black Crappie occur in Cross Lake, as many fish were greater than 8 inches and some fish over 10 inches were sampled.  Only two White Crappie were caught during the survey and were 8 and 9 inches in length.   <br> \n <br> \nBluegill catch rates in trap nets reached historic highs, but the 2014 catch rate of near 14 per net was still below average when compared to similar lakes. Bluegill mean weight was 0.33 pounds, which was greater than average and similar to the surveys conducted in 2005 and 2010. Keeper sized Bluegill were abundant during the survey, with fish between 6 and 8.5 inches making up 70 percent of the catch.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch were sampled at 5.8 fish per gill net, which is just below average when compared to similar lakes. Outside of the high Yellow Perch catch rates recorded during the 1995 and 2000 surveys, catch rates have been between 4 and 12 fish per net. Yellow Perch sampled in gill nets ranged from 5.3 to 9.2 inches with only 10 percent of the catch exceeding 8 inches. <br> \n <br> \nChannel Catfish were sampled at 1.0 fish per gill net, which remains on the low end of observed catch rates. Lengths ranged from 9.8 to 30.0 inches with a mean weight at an historic high for Cross Lake of 5.3 pounds. While the current population appears to be low, a great angling opportunity exists for large fish, with over half of the fish sampled being greater than 26 inches. <br> \n <br> \nFreshwater Drum catch rates in gill nets continue to be lower than the 25th percentile at 0.75 fish per net.  However, trap net catch rates returned to greater than the 75th percentile. Catch rates have decreased during each survey since the high of almost 12 per gill net in 1987.  Freshwater Drum averaged 13.6 inches and 0.55 pounds.  <br> \n <br> \nTwo Lake Sturgeon were present in the gill nets. Other species sampled during the survey include White Sucker, Golden Redhorse, Shorthead Redhorse, Silver Redhorse, Black Bullhead, Yellow Bullhead, Golden Shiner, Painted Turtle, Snapping Turtle, and Softshell Turtle. <br> \n <br> \nQuality fishing opportunities exist for multiple species in Cross Lake. At times fishing pressure on Cross Lake can be high and anglers are encouraged to practice selective harvest to help maintain and improve the quality of Cross Lake's fishery. Selective harvest encourages the release of larger fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish.  Releasing medium to large fish will help restore and maintain fish community balance, as well as increase opportunities to catch large fish in the future.   <br> \n <br> \nNon-native invasive species of vegetation are present in Cross Lake. Eurasian Watermilfoil and Curlyleaf Pondweed are both present, anglers and boaters should take necessary precautions to prevent the further spread of invasive species. <br> \n <br> \nSome shorelines of Cross Lake are highly developed, which can put stress on the lake's aquatic habitat and ecosystem integrity.  Environmentally friendly development practices, such as shoreline buffer strips of natural vegetation, are encouraged to help maintain and improve the water quality of Cross Lake. Also, if trees and branches have fallen in the water, consider leaving them where they are to provide important habitat for fish and wildlife that is often missing in highly developed lakes. <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Cross Lake is a 943 acre fertile basin in lake class 25 managed primarily for walleye and muskellunge.  Walleye stocking has recently been altered.  Beginning in 2010, five hundred pounds of walleye fingerlings will be stocked annually.  Muskellunge fingerlings are stocked biennially at a rate of one per littoral acre for a total of 507 fish.  Water clarity is moderate with algal blooms common in summer.  The shore is predominately sand and is highly developed especially the west shore.  Public access is available on the river just west of the lake and on the east shore near the river outlet.     <br> \n      <br> \nCross Lake anglers should expect moderate user pressure from both fishing and recreational boating.  Both bluegill and black crappie ought to provide anglers harvestable sized fish in typical abundance for the lake class.  Bluegill averaged 0.3 pounds and 7 inches while black crappie averaged 8.1 and 0.3 pounds.  Yellow perch should be available in good numbers with 23% of the catch eight inches and larger.  Muskellunge, northern pike, walleye, and channel catfish all offer quality size angling with catfish being the most abundant.   <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species present during the assessment were black, brown and yellow bullhead, golden redhorse, river redhorse, shorthead redhorse, greater redhorse, golden shiner, freshwater drum, white bass, pumpkinseed, common carp, and white sucker. <br> \n</p>",

The walleye was very low in the gillnet figures at 1.42 but was high in the trapnets at 2.38 per set.  Walleyes were very small: averaged approximately 0.20 pounds each.  At 0.25 per set, the northern pike was very low as has been its history in Cross Lake.  The yellow perch at 8.92 per set was very low with little change from previous surveys.  Muskellunge were absent in the gillnet but 3 (0.38) were taken in the trapnets and 2 while shoreline seining.  The bluegill, pumpkinseed, black crappie, and white crappie all had very low population figures.  The channel catfish, white bass, and bowfin had low population figures.  The black bullhead, yellow bullhead, and freshwater drum had very low populations.  The northern redhorse was absent in the gillnet but was high in the trapnet at 12.75 per set.  The white sucker was slightly high and the carp was slightly low.  The shovelnose sturgeon was about average.  The largemouth bass was present only in the shoreline seining results.  NOTE:  Although most fish species have low to very low population figures, fishing in general appears to be good with no complaints reaching the area office.  Verbal reports have been favorable.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Cross is a 942.8 acre lake managed primarily for walleye, muskellunge, and crappie.  Various stocking has occurred through the years but ceased in 1991, except for muskie stocking.  Commercial roughfish harvest still takes place on an occasional winter, with the last removal this past winter, 1995-96.  During June 26-30, 1995, a DNR fisheries crew conducted a population assessment to evaluate the present fish population on Cross Lake (lake class 25).  Gear types consisted of 12 gillnets and 12 trapnets.  Four of the 12 gillnets were intentionally set in shallow water (4.5-5.5') to see if walleye net catches would increase.  Past surveys indicated that walleye in Cross Lake frequent shallow water during the summer months.  Additional fish sampling included night electrofishing for bass and walleye and shoreline seine hauls to document young-of-year hatch/survival.Netting found the walleye abundance to be at low levels for this type of lake.  This was similar to the catches of the previous 3 surveys (1987, 1990, 1992) where walleye numbers were low.  Cross Lake has been gillnetted 9 times since 1955 and in 6 of the surveys the walleye catch was below normal.  The highest catch occurred in 1977 but fewer test nets were used that year.  From 1945 to 1983 walleye fry or fgl stocking occurred at infrequent intervals.  An intensive stocking program was started in 1984 with annual stocking from 1984 through 1991, except in 1986.  Since the walleye catch has historically been low in the surveys, especially in the last 15 years, it was time to try something a little different to see if the walleye population was as low as the gillnets indicated.  The 4 \"shallow\" gillnet sets were used in an attempt to sample more walleye from the shallower depths.  Of the 9 total walleye caught by gillnets in this survey, four of the fish were from shallow sets.  These shallow sets were set in known angler walleye haunts, i.e. Norway Point, the sunken rock island (which had great weed cover), etc...  Interviews with local anglers during the same week of the survey found that they had caught more walleye than the DNR crew sampled by all gear.  They did say the fish were small (8-12\").  Although this shallow netting method worked well in Pokegama Lake, it did not contribute to a greater number of walleye caught in Cross Lake as was hoped.  Therefore, it did not validate the assumption that walleye were frequently more common in shallow water in Cross Lake, during summer months.The walleye sampled by gillnet ranged from 9.1 to 19.2 inches with an average of 13.0 inches.  Average weight was 0.9 pounds which was below the norm for a lake of this type.  Ages 3-5 were sampled with age 3 representing naturally reproduced fish of the 1992 year class (recall final stocking was in 1991).  Walleye were not captured in the trapnet sets.  Night electrofishing on 6/16/95 sampled 23 walleye ranging from 5.2 to 18.4 inches with an average length of 10.2 inches.While tracking the stocking efforts since 1984 against netting results, it has become fairly obvious that stocking has had little impact on overall walleye abundance in Cross Lake.  There were enough fingerlings stocked to show some improvement, but it didn't.  Other local area lakes that are stocked with this amount of walleye usually show positive gains in the walleye abundance.  But most lakes stocked are not naturally reproducing walleye lakes as Cross Lake is.  Stocking walleye on top of a self-reproducing walleye population as been shown to have only limited success in increasing walleye abundance.  Even the first survey in 1955 picked up on this fact, showing many natural fish in the population coming from non-stocked years.  One thing that seemed to remain constant in all the surveys was that walleye in Cross Lake appear to be small and were low in numbers.  Large fish were hardly sampled.  Age versus growth varied from slow to normal growth.  This open-ended river system lake allows for many variables to act on the overall fish population.  Constant changes in water levels, minimal vegetative cover, a strong  presence of rough fish, excessive nutrients in the water, and general human disturbances are just a few of the common factors which influence success or failure of the game fish stability in this lake.  It seems apparent that the walleye will always be present but in low abundance and their size will be smaller than desired.  With a low number of small walleye to begin with, it would only make sense that there are fewer larger walleye as the fish get older.In most natural walleye lakes, the walleye spawning success is far from consistent.  Cross Lake is no exception.  Water levels bounce 2-3' annually which can directly affect hatching success.  The Snake River probably provides most of the walleye spawning grounds with also a few gravel/rubble areas in the lake.  Early seining checks can usually show the success of that year's spawning and in this year's seining efforts, only 1 young-of-year walleye was sampled on 6/26/95.  This seining check did not conclude a poor hatch occurred but it merely suggests it might be the case.  Follow up netting can better refine their population status when they are age 3 or older.  This is when their larger size permits them to be sampled in standard DNR nets.  Of course by then, hatches from 3 successive years will have occurred.  Any 1 year when there is a good hatch can really carry the strong makeup of the walleye population.  For example, if good hatches happened 3 or 4 years out of a 10 year period, that would make for a very adequate walleye fishery.  This is what really happens under normal or natural circumstances; it is what is termed \"year class strength\".  Think of the large natural walleye lakes; Mille Lacs, Leech, Cass, Winnibigoshish, etc...  Strong year classes are what these lakes are accustomed to for maintaining stable walleye populations, and that is a natural process.  Stocking does not occur in those lakes and any efforts to stock would be futile, disrupting the cycle.There are some other past evaluations of the walleye in Cross Lake which should be summarized here.  The Cross Lake Association submitted 4 years of angler diaries from 1986 to 1989.  In each of the 4 studies the average length of walleye caught was 10.1 inches and the catch rate was 0.42 walleye/1 hour of angling (4-year ave).  The DNR conducted a creel census during May - Sept. of 1988.  Results found exceptionally good catch rates (1.04 walleye/hour) but the average length was 8.0-8.5 inches.  No fish over 14.0 inches were recorded during that study.  Any walleye catch rate above 0.20 walleye/hour is considered very good.  These catch rates are excellent!  The 1990 DNR lake survey sampled 89 walleye during night electrofishing on 9/4-5/90.  The lengths ranged from 5.0 to 21.0 inches with a median length group of 9.0-9.4 inches.  Notice the same trend?  Walleye are caught readily but they are small and young fish, not stunted.  Another thing to ponder, is that Cross Lake harbors around 25 species of fish.  That's a lot of competition within the same food chain.  Normal bass-panfish lakes in east-central Minnesota have around 10-12 species present.Two muskies were observed in the nets which was normal for this lake.  They measured 39.2 and 44.0 inches.  The smaller fish was age 6, which dates it to the first Leech Lake strain stocking in 1989.  The 44 inch muskie was one of the Wisconsin strain fish which are no longer stocked in these waters.  Leech Lake strain fish are native to the Mississippi River and grow to larger sizes (50+ inches).  Night electrofishing recorded 1 muskie that was 13.4 inches.  Contrary to rumor, muskies do not eat all of the walleyes and crappies in a lake.  This is just a scare tactic or an excuse used by people who do not like muskies.  Yes, muskies are opportunistic and will eat gamefish along with any other type of rough fish, but their population numbers are not so high in the lake as to inflict reduction in numbers to a particular species in Cross Lake.   They are at times a territorial fish needing a few acres of water space for themselves.  Muskies are also a native to the St. Croix River which has attributed to their presence in the lower half of the Snake River.The northern pike abundance was normal for this lake type and was the highest recorded catch since 1955.  Their lengths ranged from 14.3 to 30.0 inches with an average of 20.8 inches.  These length figures were remarkably close to the Pokegama Lake northern pike catch this year, which in some ways is not surprising being that they are part of the same river system.  Historically, both lakes have carried low populations and now, for once, Cross Lake has a decent population.  Average weight was 2.2 pounds.  Ages 1-6 were represented by the catch.  The large presence of age 3 and 4 fish (72% of the total catch) showed signs of good reproduction in 1991 and 1992.  No young-of-year were captured during shoreline seining.  Good natural reproduction of northern pike in 1992 has been documented for many of the area lakes.The channel catfish again showed how their abundance levels maintain an important role in the general fish population.  They add a feature unique to Cross's fishery while providing a good size distribution.  Lengths ranged from 13.6 to 26.5 inches with a mean length of 19.8 inches.  Average weight was 3.0 pounds.  Catfish incidentally, probably consume more fish than muskies and there are more of them.The black crappie catch was typical of its \"cyclic\" historical catch and was considered normal for this lake type.  They are a boom and bust species, occurring at high levels for some years and them dropping to low levels.  Crappie in this lake, along with walleye, are the most sought after fish.  When caught, they are normally kept by the angler.  The netting did not detect any strong year classes coming up through the ranks but it did sample many sizes.  Lengths from the gillnets ranged from 3.2 to 11.1 inches with aa average length of 7.4 inches.  Only 4 young-of-year were sampled by seining which seemed to indicate a poor hatch this year.  Poor hatches occurred in all of the local lakes this year due to cool water temperatures.  Some crappie did not even spawn but rather absorbed the eggs for energy.The white crappie abundance has varied from normal to high levels throughout the years and now is at a normal level for this lake.  Their lengths ranged from 4.5 to 11.2 inches averaging 8.2 inches.  They too are characteristic of the black crappie's habits but seemed to have had population levels opposite of the black crappie, i.e. when one species was high the other was low.Bluegill net catches were within the historic range for this lake.  Past surveys have never shown bluegill to be a dominant panfish in the lake with net catches indicating low populations in 5 of 8 surveys.  Their sizes are usually well represented meaning annual spawn and hatch occurs.  This survey sampled bluegill ranging from 2.0 to 8.9 inches with an average of 5.6 inches.  The lack of lakewide submerged vegetation most likely determines their low presence.  Although vegetation in the lake may on some years seem abundant, it only grows along the shoreline in narrow bands due to abrupt depth changes and low clarity.  Shoreline seining sampled 767 young-of-year bluegill.Largemouth bass were rarely sampled by DNR gear in all of the surveys dating back to 1955.  In fact, only 1 bass was ever sampled before this survey.  This year there was 1 taken by gillnets which indicates a low presence.  It measured 7.2 inches and was age 2.  Night electrofishing only sampled 1 bass during 65 (on-time) minutes of shocking along the shore.  Early shoreline seining managed to capture 1 guard male bass and 350 of its young it was protecting.  All were released.  It was a matter of a lucky seine haul, because if we did not capture that male, chances are we would not have sampled any bass.  This lake is not suited as a bass lake given its lack of habitat and competition with 24 other species.Smallmouth bass were sampled at low levels but it is known that many of them use the river during the summer and return to the lake during the winter.  They were 10.7 and 15.0 inches long.  One 11.0 incher was sampled during night electrofishing.  One young-of-year was sampled during shoreline seining efforts along the tip of Norway Point.The yellow perch abundance turned out to be the highlight of the survey in terms of their increase in numbers.  For the first time they were recorded at high levels.  Perch are generally considered as a food source for the larger predator species.  Although they can grow to large sizes themselves (as in Mille Lacs, Winnie, etc.), they usually don't attain these sizes in smaller lakes, such as Cross Lake, before becoming eaten as prey.  Sizes ranged from 4.9 to 8.8 inches with an average length of 7.2 inches.  Shoreline seining captured 444 young-of- year.Lake sturgeon abundance has remained stable for the past 3 surveys.  Known to be in these waters longer than pre-European settlement, the sturgeon numbers apparently dropped drastically from over-harvest upon settlement in this area.  Stories and some photos of large catches remain in family memories or albums.  Recent studies suggest that their abundance is low but probably recovering.  The fair amount of smaller (young) sturgeon sampled lately seems to indicate this trend.  Practices such as size protection and season closure have no doubt protected this fragile population.  How well their recovery will be, also depends on issues like water quality and habitat protection.  An ongoing sturgeon tagging study by the DNR has been in progress on the Snake and Kettle River Systems since 1992.Freshwater drum (sheephead) have made their mark in the fish population of Cross Lake.  Sampled in each of the surveys since 1955, they have had abundance levels normal for this type of lake but were found at high levels in 1977.  This year they ranged from 5.7 to 22.0 inches and averaged 13.0 inches.  The 22.0 inch drum weighed 4.6 pounds.  Drum are caught almost as frequently as walleye and crappie, and that is unlikely to change in the foreseeable future.  Rough fish seining crews remove them during carp removal projects but few numbers ever turn up in the nets.Redhorse species, golden, greater, shorthead, and silver always make up a significant catch in the nets.  Unlike carp, these sucker-type fish are native to the Snake River system and are a natural part of the lake's ecosystem even though they sometimes appear to be very abundant.  Their natural diet consists of mostly small aquatic organisms, especially insect larvae.  They are actually considered by some to be an indicator of how healthy or clean the water is.   Past surveys had similar netting results.Common carp were sampled at normal abundance levels for this type of lake.  They were large fish averaging 26.7 inches.  Carp will always be present in the lake and river system.  As long as the game fish species remain at their recent levels, carp abundance should stay in check and hopefully their impact on the lake will be held to minimum.Eleven other species were represented in the netting gear; brown bullhead, fathead minnow, golden shiner, logperch, pumpkinseed, rock bass, spottail shiner, tadpole madtom, white bass, white sucker, and yellow bullhead.  The abundance of all eleven species were either normal or below their expected population levels for Cross Lake (lake class 25).The area fisheries office commonly fields questions about what to do with abundant aquatic vegetation in front of lakeshore property.  In some cases, these plants can be a nuisance, but because Cross Lake has such a narrow band of vegetation, fisheries recommends leaving as much vegetation intact as possible.  This narrow band acts as a nursery area for young fish, holds algae-eating invertebrates, and ties up some nutrients that would otherwise contribute to algae problems.

                "narrative": "<p>Cross Lake is a fertile 943 acre lake in lake located near the town of Pine City, MN in southern Pine County. The lake is primarily managed for Walleye and Muskellunge.  Approximately 500 pounds of Walleye fingerlings are stocked in odd-numbered years and 500 Muskellunge fingerlings are stocked annually.  A survey consisting of 12 gill nets, 12 trap nets, and night electrofishing was conducted in June of 2022 to assess fish populations. The previous survey was conducted in 2018.  <br> \n <br> \nGillnet catch of Walleye was 1.4 per net, which is an increase from the previous survey.  Walleye ranged from 7.8 to 21.4 inches in length in 2022 compared to 12.3 to 22.2 inches in length in 2018.  Walleye averaged 13.8 inches in 2022 compared to 18.2 inches in 2018.  Walleye lengths were good, with 41% of the catch over 12 inches. <br> \n <br> \nGill net catch of Northern Pike was 3.1 fish per net.  Pike ranged from 14.4 to 33.8 inches in length and averaged 22.1 inches in 2022.  The percentage of fish over 26 inches in the total catch was 14% in 2022 compared to 44% in 2018. Average size of pike has increased from 21.9 inches in 2018 to 27.2 inches in 2022.  Anglers can expect to catch good numbers of pike over 26 inches. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie were caught in gill nets at a rate of 10.2 fish per net which is twice as high as the previous survey.  Black Crappie lengths ranged from 4.2 to 11.8 inches with 41% of the catch over 8 inches. There are also White Crappie present in Cross Lake.  The size of the White Crappie sampled was quite large with the average weight being 0.8 lbs. which is substantially larger than similar lakes. The size of the White Crappie sampled were between 6.8 and 12.8 inches.  The outlook for Black crappie fishing on Cross lake is good, with the chance to catch an occasional White Crappie.   <br> \n <br> \nIn the Spring of 2022, a special regulation was implemented on Cross Lake which decreased the bag limits from 20 to 10 sunfish in order to protect quality sized Bluegills. The 2022 Sunfish survey is part of an  assessment to monitor  the special regulation to determine if it is effective in maintaining current sunfish size structure on Cross Lake. We want to be proactive and protect the current size structure of sunfish on Cross Lake to provide anglers the opportunity to catch quality sized Sunfish for years to come. The 2022 survey captured a total of 53 sunfish. The sunfish trap net catch rate was 5.0 fish per net. Sunfish lengths ranged from 3.8 to 9.1 inches with 90% of the catch over 6 inches and 66% of the catch over 8 inches. The average length of sunfish was 8.0 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nThe Yellow Perch catch rate of 11.5 fish per gill net is slightly above average for this lake.  The 2022 survey indicated that perch ranged from 3.4 to 9.5 inches in length and averaged 7.2 inches. Anglers can expect to catch good numbers of quality size perch, with 62% of the gillnet catch over 7 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nThe Largemouth Bass catch rate was 18.5 per hour, while not exceptional compared to some lakes, the catch rate was higher than the previous two surveys on Cross Lake.  Largemouth Bass sizes ranged from 7.5 inches to 15.8 inches with an average length of 12.8 inches.  Four Smallmouth Bass were captured during the survey, with lengths between 9.8 inches to 13.8 inches. <br> \n <br> \nChannel Catfish were sampled at a rate of 1.9 fish per gill net in 2022 compared to 2.2 fish per net in 2018. This is a slight decrease since the last survey but is about average relative to long term historical catch rates. Mean weight decreased slightly to 3.3 lbs. Average length was 20.1 inches with the longest sampled at 29.2 inches.  There are good numbers of quality sized catfish available to anglers, with 90% of the gillnet catch over 17 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nLake Sturgeon were caught in gill nets at a rate of 3.3 fish per net which is significantly higher than previous surveys. Historical catch rates of Lake Sturgeon have been low in Cross Lake, but fish migrate from the Snake River into Cross Lake at different times of the year and can provide an exciting angling opportunity for anglers.  Length averaged 20 inches with the largest fish being about 42.0 inches. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled during this survey were Brown Bullhead, Yellow Bullhead, Chestnut Lamprey, Common Carp, Freshwater Drum, Golden Shiner, Greater Redhorse, Lake Sturgeon, Rockbass, Shorthead Redhorse, Silver Redhorse, White Bass, Pumpkinseed Sunfish, Bigmouth Buffalo, White Sucker. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Cross Lake is a fertile 943 acre lake located near the town of Pine City, MN in southern Pine County. It can be accessed by a public concrete boat ramp in the Snake River near the western shore of the lake, or by a ramp near the lake's outlet on the east shore.  The lake is primarily managed for Walleye and Muskellunge.  Around 500 pounds of Walleye fingerlings are stocked in odd-numbered years and 500 Muskellunge fingerlings are stocked annually. A survey consisting of 12 gill net and 12 trap net sets was conducted in June 2018 to assess fish populations. The previous survey was conducted in 2014. Muskellunge are not effectively sampled by these gear types and a separate survey is conducted periodically to assess their population.  <br> \n <br> \nThe Walleye gill net catch rate was 0.5 which is very low compared to similar lakes but typical for Cross Lake. Walleye averaged 18 inches with the largest fish sampled being 22 inches. Nearly as many fish were sampled in trap nets and were of similar sizes.  <br> \n <br> \nGill net catch of Northern Pike was 1.5 fish per net. This catch rate is more than double the previous survey but it has historically always been low compared to similar lakes. Average weight was large at 3.7 lbs. and average length was 25 inches with the largest fish measuring 35 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie were caught in trap nets at a rate of 5.1 fish per net which is twice as high as the previous survey. Historical catch rates of Black Crappie have been pretty variable in Cross Lake but average weight has tended to be good and continues to be at 0.3 lbs. Length averaged 8 inches with the largest fish being about 10.5 inches. White Crappie also had an increased catch rate with 0.58 fish sampled per trap net. This is the highest catch since 2000 although it is lower than similar lakes.  The size of the White Crappie sampled was quite large with the average weight being 0.54 lbs. which is substantially larger than similar lakes. All White Crappie in trap nets were between 9.3 and 11.1 inches in length.   <br> \n <br> \nTrap nets sampled Bluegill at a rate of 8 fish per net which is quite low. It is lower than the previous survey but catch rates have historically been relatively low. Average weight was excellent at 0.32 lbs. Cross Lake has a history of a low density but large size Bluegill population. Fish averaged 7 inches in length and sizes were well distributed up to 9 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nThe Yellow Perch catch rate of 7.6 fish per gill net is low but typical relative to the last several surveys. Average weight of 0.20 lbs. had increased slightly and is large compared to similar lakes. Despite this there doesn't appear to be much draw for anglers with an average length of 7.6 inches and only 1 fish sampled over 9 inches.  <br> \n  <br> \nChannel Catfish were sampled at a rate of 2.2 fish per gill net. This is an increase over the last several surveys but is about average relative to long term historical catch rates. Average weight decreased slightly to 3.6 lbs. Average length was 20.5 inches with the majority of fish clustered around that size but several larger individuals reached up to 33 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nFour smaller Lake Sturgeon averaging 24 inches were sampled in gill nets. Other species sampled were Bowfin, Brown Bullhead, Chestnut Lamprey, Common Carp, Freshwater Drum, Golden Shiner, Pumpkinseed, Shorthead Redhorse, Silver Redhorse, White Bass, White Sucker, and Yellow Bullhead. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Cross Lake is a 943 acre fertile basin in lake class 25 managed primarily for walleye and muskellunge.  Walleye stocking has recently been increased.  Begining in 2005, one thousand pounds of walleye fingerlings will be stocked biennially.  Muskellunge fingerlings are also stocked on alternating years at a rate of one per littoral acre for a total of 507 fish.  Water clarity is moderate with algal blooms common in summer.  The shore is predominately sand and is highly developed especially the west shore.  Public access is available on the river just west of the lake and on the east shore near the river outlet.         Cross Lake anglers should expect moderate user pressure from both fishing and recreational boating.  Bluegill and both black and white crappie ought to provide anglers quality sized fish in typical abundance for the lake class.  Bluegill averaged 0.35 pounds and 7.4 inches with more than a third of the catch exceeding 8 inches.  Black crappie averaged 8.1 inches and ranged up to 11.4 inches.  White crappie, while less abundant, were larger with a 9.5 inch and 0.45 pound average.  Yellow perch should be available in good numbers with 22% of the catch eight inches and larger.  Muskellunge, northern pike and channel catfish offer quality size angling with catfish being the most abundant.  Walleye, largemouth, and smallmouth bass abundance is presumably low, at least during the summer months.Other fish species present during the assessment were brown and yellow bullhead, golden redhorse, silver redhorse, shorthead redhorse, greater redhorse, freshwater drum, white bass, pumpkinseed, quillback, and white sucker.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Cross Lake is a 943-acre lake located in Pine County that has been assigned to lake class 25.  The lake is managed primarily for Walleye and Muskellunge with crappies as the secondary species. <br> \n <br> \nA Muskellunge assessment was conducted on Cross Lake from April 13 to April 29, 2015.  A total of 60 fish were caught including 21 in-year recaptures.  Of the 39 new fish, there were 21 males and 18 females caught.  Total average length was 45.2 inches, slightly up from 42.0 inches in 2008 and 44.0 inches in 2009 with a range of 37.0 to 54.3 inches.  Male average length was 42.0 inches, with a range of 37.0 to 47.4 inches.  Male average weight was 19.4 pounds, with a range of 9.3 to 25.6 pounds.  Female average length was 49.0 inches, with a range of 38.6 to 54.3 inches.  Female average weight was 29.5 pounds, with a range of 13.4 to 38.6 pounds.  <br> \n <br> \nRelative weight (Wr), a measure of how plump a fish is, was calculated for all adult fish using an equation specific to Leech Lake strain Muskellunge.  A Wr of 100 or greater means that a fish is at its ideal weight.  Thirty-three of the fish in Cross Lake had a Wr above 80, 22 had a Wr over 90, and six had a Wr over 100.  The average Wr was 91.  Meaning, on average, the fish achieved 91% of their ideal weight.  <br> \n <br> \nCatch rate for the 2015 sample was 0.28 fish per set when including all 60 fish, and 0.18 per set when including only the 39 new fish.  This is about one half the catch rate of 2009 (0.50), but identical to 2008 and much greater than the 2003 catch rate of 0.15 per set.  Previous catch rates were 0.09/set in 1998 and 0.08/set in 1993.  Catch rates for earlier samples in 1988 and 1983 were 0.42/set and 0.62/set respectively.  The 1988 and 1983 sets were mostly Shoepack and Wisconsin strain fish, so they may have had a higher catch rate than the current Leech Lake strain.   <br> \n <br> \nA population estimate was calculated using the trap net catch.  The estimate was calculated as 56 fish, with a 95% confidence limit of 47 to 68 fish.  This is a density of 0.06 fish per acre, with a range of 0.05 to 0.07 fish per acre. <br> \n <br> \nA method for estimating fish mortality called catch curve analysis was done by combining males and females.  Mortality and survival was then estimated for ages 10 through 18.  Estimated annual mortality was 26% and estimated annual survival was 74% for this age group.  This indicates there is very little mortality of Muskellunge caused by natural mortality or harvest by fishermen. <br> \n <br> \nProportional stock density (PSD), a measure of the number of quality size fish divided by the number of stock size fish, was 100.  This means that all fish caught were of quality size (30 inches) or greater.  Relative stock density (RSD) was calculated for fish 40 inches and greater, 48 inches and greater, and 54 inches and greater.  The RSD40 was 85, very similar to the 87 in 2009 and the 83 in 2008.  This means about 85% of all fish sampled were 40 inches or longer.  The RSD48 value was 31, which is much higher than it was in 2009 when it was 17. This means the proportion of fish 48 inches and larger has increased.  This could be a result of the 48 inch size limit that was in place from 2010 to 2014.  A RSD54 was also calculated and that value was five.  This indicates that very few fish sampled were over the new legal minimum size limit of 54 inches. <br> \n <br> \nAges were determined by aging anal spines for all fish.  There were fish from the 1997 and 1999-2009 year classes represented.  Muskellunge were not stocked in 2001, 2003, 2005, and 2007, so assuming these fish were aged accurately, this indicates some natural reproduction in these years.  Anal fin rays have been highly variable in their utility though, and have not been validated against known ages (MDNR Muskellunge Sampling Guidelines).   <br> \n <br> \nOf the 39 unique fish sampled this year, 19 (49%) were tagged in 2008 and 2009, indicating low recruitment to this population.  The growth of previously-tagged fish was calculated between capture intervals.  Of fish that were tagged in 2008 and recaptured in 2015, the average increase in length was 5.0 inches (the maximum increase was 20.3 inches and the minimum increase was 1.3 inches).  Of fish that were tagged in 2009 and recaptured in 2015, the average increase in length was 3.5 inches (the maximum increase was 6.4 inches, and the minimum increase was 1.1 inches). <br> \n <br> \nFish movement was tracked by recording passive integrated transponder (PIT) tag numbers each time an individual fish was caught.  There were 15 fish that were caught multiple times in 2015.  One fish was caught four times, three fish were caught three times, and 11 fish were caught twice.  The greatest distance traveled between captures by an individual fish was approximately 2.0 miles.  Of the fish that were caught three times, two were caught in three different nets and one was caught in two different nets. Of the fish that were caught twice, two were caught in identical nets, the rest were caught in different nets each time.  Of the 15 fish, three moved in a southerly direction and the remainder moved in a northerly direction.  Of the 19 fish that were originally tagged in 2008 and 2009, only five returned to the same nets as they did previously in 2008 or 2009.  Six of the fish that did not return to the same nets traveled over 1.5 miles to new nets in 2015. <br> \n <br> \nOverall, the opportunity to catch a Muskellunge in this lake may be lower than in some lakes, but your chances of catching a nice fish here are good, as 33 of the 39 fish caught were 40 inches or larger and two fish were 54 inches or larger. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>  A population assessment of Cross Lake was conducted on June 29 - July 2, 1992 utilizing twelve gillnet sets and five shoreline seine hauls to evaluate walleye abundance.  The status of the present fish population of Cross Lake was determined by comparing the resultant data with that of previous Cross Lake investigations and medians of lake class 32.  \n  The walleye gillnet catch (0.25/set) was identical to the 1990 catch and still fell below the first quartile value (1.00/set) of the lake class, indicating a low abundance of walleye.  Sampled walleye ranged from 10.4-12.9 inches in length and had a mean weight 0.37 pounds which is below the first quartile value of 1.03 pounds.  Back-calculated age and growth data from scale and spine samples indicated that captured walleye were three years old.  Growth occurred at a normal rate based on the statewide growth rate of walleye.  Two young of the year were captured on June 29, 1992 in the shoreline seine hauls.  Recent survey sampling techniques have not shown any positive impact on the walleye fishery since yearly stocking began in 1984.  In fact, a quality walleye population, where 1/3 of fish >10\" are also >15\" (Anderson and Weithman 1978), has not been documented by net catch, electrofishing, angler diary, or creel data.\n  The northern pike gillnet catch has historically been low.  The 1992 catch (0.75/set) was a significant decrease from the 1990 catch of 1.08/set and below the first quartile value of 1.75/set.  Sampled northern pike ranged from 16.0-34.9 inches in length with a median length group of 26.0-26.9 inches.  Their mean weight was 4.68 pounds which is above the third quartile value of 3.29 pounds.  Back-calculated age and growth data from scale samples indicated that captured northern pike were three, five, and six years old.  Growth was normal compared to the statewide growth rate of the species.  \n  The white crappie gillnet catch (2.45/set) was down from the 1990 catch of 5.17/set but normal based on a lake class median of 6.34/set.  Sampled white crappie ranged in length from 4.5-10.4 inches with a median length group of 9.5-9.9 inches.  Their mean weight (0.38 pounds) was above the lake class third quartile value of 0.25 pounds.  Back- calculated age and growth data from scale samples indicated that captured white crappie ranged in age from one to four years with the 1988 year class representing 2/3 of the sample.  Growth was normal based on the statewide growth rate of black crappie.  \n  The black crappie net catch (2.58/set) was up from the 1990 catch of 0.33/set and normal based on the lake class median of 5.14/set.  Sampled black crappie ranged in length from 4.5-10.9 inches with a median length group of 9.5-9.9 inches.  Their mean weight (0.43 pounds) was above the third quartile value of 0.31 pounds.  Back-calculated age and growth data from scale samples indicated that captured black crappie ranged from one to five years of age with 1988 having the strongest year class.  Growth was normal based on the statewide growth rate of the species.  \n  The yellow perch net catch (4.33/set) decreased significantly from the 1990 catch of 7.08/set and fell below the first quartile value of 4.91/set.  Sampled yellow perch ranged in length from 5.0-10.4 inches with a median length group of 7.5-7.9 inches.  Their mean weight (0.19 pounds) was above the lake class third quartile value of 0.14 pounds.  \n  The channel catfish net catch (3.67/set) is up from the 1990 catch of 0.83 pounds and similar to the 1992 catch of other lakes in the Snake River watershed.  Sampled channel catfish ranged in length from 12.0-24.9 inches with a median length group of 18.0-18.9 inches.  Their mean weight (2.42 pounds) was also to that of other lakes in the Snake River watershed.  Back- calculated age and growth data from spine samples indicated that captured channel catfish ranged in age from two to eight years with 1986 having the strongest year class.  Growth occurred near the Snake River watershed rate for channel catfish.  \n  The lake sturgeon gillnet catch (0.50/set) was down from the 1990 catch of 0.67/ set.  However, the mean weight of sampled lake sturgeon was up from 2.28 to 2.52 pounds.  Sampled lake sturgeon ranged in length from 12.0-31.9 inches.  Back-calculated age data from spine samples indicated that captured lake sturgeon were three, six, seven, and nine years old.  \n  The bluegill net catch (0.25/set) was the first reported catch since 1.25/set were captured in 1955, and was below the first quartile value of 0.67/set.  The three sampled bluegill ranged from 5.0-7.4 inches in length and had a mean weight of 0.20 pounds.  \n  One muskellunge was captured in the gillnets.  It was 30.2 inches long, weighed 5.8 pounds, and was seven years old.\n  Five other species (white sucker, silver redhorse, golden redhorse, shorthead redhorse, and freshwater drum) were sampled by the gillnets.  All had normal catch rates except the freshwater drum (3.83/set) which was below its first quartile value (7.00/set).  All had normal mean weights based on their lake class medians.\n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Cross Lake is a 943 acre fertile basin in lake class 25 managed primarily for walleye and muskellunge.  During the week of June 26, 2000 a lake survey, consisting of 6 standard gill net sets, 6 shallow gill net sets (< 6 feet ), and 12 trap net sets, was conducted to evaluate the current lake management goals.  Additionally, 30 vegetation transects and 5 seine hauls were completed on August 22nd and 30th respectively.          Walleye abundance was low based on the gill net catch of 0.5 per set.  Despite substantial fingerling stocking from 1984 to 1991 the walleye abundance has remained low since 1981.  Sampled walleye ranged in length from 10.6 to 24.4 inches.  Walleye averaged 1.4 pounds.  Seven sampled walleye represented four year classes 1993, 1995, 1997, and 1998.  Two fingerling walleye were taken in the shoreline seining, apparently natural reproduction.  The Cross Lake walleye population has yet to meet the long range management goal of 1 to 4 walleye per gill net.              The northern pike catch was low when compared to similar lakes but was still the second highest on record for Cross Lake.   Captured northerns ranged from 19.5 to 31.3 inches with a very respectable mean of 26.9 inches.  The mean weight increased from 2.2 pounds in 1995 to 4.9 pounds in the 2000 survey.  Sampled northerns ranged in age from 3 to 8 years with a dominate 1994 year class (39%).  Northern pike were not sampled in the shoreline seining.           The black crappie catch rate was at an all time high for both trap nets and gill nets.  Overall, black crappie ranged from 5.8 to 11.7 inches with averages of 7.5 inches and 0.3 pounds.  Ages ranged from 2 to 7 years with the strongest year classes in 1994, 1997, and 1998.  Black crappie were not sampled in the shoreline seining.          Similar to the black crappie, the white crappie gill net catch was an all time high.  Lengths ranged from 6.3 to 11.7 inches with 72% of the catch between 7 and 8 inches.  All but 3 white crappie taken in the gill nets were from the 1997 or the 1998 year classes. White crappie were also absent in the shoreline seining.           Yellow perch had a high gill net catch rate for only the second time since 1955.   The size structure was nearly identical to the 1995 catch with averages of 7.2 inches and 0.2 pounds.  The 1996 and the 1997 year classes accounted for 71% of the catch.  Based on the shoreline seining , yellow perch reproduction was successful in 2000.          Both largemouth and smallmouth bass were electrofished in low abundance, 4.2 and 1.7 per hour respectively.  The catch for both species was slightly higher than that reported in the 1995 assessment, the only other electrofishing sample.  Both smallmouth were from the 1997 year class.  Four largemouth bass were split between the 1996 and the 1997 year class.  Fingerling largemouth were present in the shoreline seining, smalllmouth were not.          Channel catfish continue to be sampled in good numbers, 3.3 per gill net.  Lengths ranged from 11.3 to 28.6 inches with an average weight of 3.3 pounds.  Channel cats present a fishery of quality sized individuals to a growing number of Cross Lake anglers.          The bluegill trap net catch, 10.8 per set, was the highest on record.  Bluegill ranged from 4.2 to 8.7 inches with 83% of the catch between 6 and 7 inches.  The average length of bluegill increased from 5.6 in 1995 to 6.4 inches in 2000.  Ages ranged from 2 to 7 years with the 1996 year class representing 56% of the catch.  Bluegill fingerlings dominated the shoreline seining with 1,472 in the sample.              Other species sampled during the survey include; lake sturgeon, bowfin, muskellunge, spottail shiner, common carp, white sucker, shorthead redhorse, silver redhorse, quillback, yellow bullhead, brown bullhead, white bass, pumpkinseed, Iowa darter, logperch, freshwater drum, painted, snapping, and softshell turtle.          Cross Lake anglers should expect moderate user pressure from both fishing and recreational boating.  Black and white crappie should provide anglers with ample opportunities to harvest fish near 8 inches.  Yellow perch and bluegill should also be available in good numbers but their size may be unacceptable to some anglers. Both northern pike and channel catfish offer anglers quality size angling with catfish being more abundant.  Walleye, largemouth, and smallmouth bass abundance is presumably low.</p>",
