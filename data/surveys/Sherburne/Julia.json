                "narrative": "<p>Briggs, Julia, and Rush Lakes are located five miles north of the City of Clear Lake in northern Sherburne County.  The lakes are connected by a navigable channel and together make up the Briggs Chain of Lakes. The lakes are shallow and eutrophic.  Maximum depths range from 11 feet in Julia to 25 feet in Briggs. They also have relatively poor water quality and experience nuisance algal blooms throughout the summer. <br> \n <br> \nA targeted Bluegill assessment was conducted on the Briggs Chain of Lakes from June 17   June 24, 2015.  This assessment was conducted in order to get an idea of the size structure of the spawning Bluegills.  Many times these larger individuals are not sampled during the traditional summer surveys especially during surveys conducted in July and August.  A total of 65 Bluegills were sampled on Lake Julia during this survey.  Bluegill averaged 6.7 inches in length with the largest Bluegill measuring 8.8 inches.  The size structure of a fish population is often described using terms such as Proportional Stock Density (PSD) and Relative Stock Density (RSD).  For Bluegill, PSD is the percentage of Bluegill larger than 3\" that are also larger than 6\".  The PSD of Bluegill from Lake Julia was 69.  So, 69% of the Bluegill sampled larger than 3\" were also larger than 6\".  Similarly, RSD8 is the percentage of Bluegill larger than 3\" that are also larger than 8\". The RSD8 on Lake Julia was 22.  Although both of these indices indicate a healthy Bluegill population, the sample size on Lake Julia was the smallest of the three lakes in the Briggs Chain.  <br> \n <br> \nA total of 753 Bluegill were sampled across  the Briggs Chain of Lakes.  These Bluegill ranged from 3.5 to 9.8 inches and averaged 7.3 inches.  Proportional Stoock Density (PSD) and RSD8 for Bluegill was 86 and 32 respectively.  Of the three lakes in the Briggs Chain, Rush Lake had the largest overall sample of Bluegills. <br> \n <br> \nThe average replacement time for an eight inch sunfish in central Minnesota is 5 8 years.  Therefore anglers are encouraged to limit their harvest of larger Bluegill.  Especially adult males which are more colorful during the spring time when they are in the process of spawning and are more easily exploited by anglers.  The larger male Bluegills are important to maintaining a healthy size structure as they limit the potential that the rest of the population can get to.  Anglers can help to maintain good fishing for Bluegill on the Briggs Chain of Lakes by selectively harvesting medium sized females and releasing largest males. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Briggs, Julia, and Rush Lakes are located five miles north of the City of Clear Lake in northern Sherburne County. The lakes are connected by a navigable channel and together make up the Briggs Chain of Lakes. The lakes are shallow and eutrophic. Maximum depths range from 11 feet in Julia to 25 feet in Briggs. They also have relatively poor water quality and experience nuisance algal blooms throughout the summer. Trophic State Index (TSI) values, based on the 10 year average of summer water quality samples, ranged from 63 on Julia to 69 on Rush which classify the lakes as eutrophic. Walleye are the primary managed species on the Briggs Chain with fry being stocked every other year since 1990 with relatively good success based on fall electrofishing results. A standard survey was completed in 2019 to update data last collected in 2015 and included bass electrofishing and gill nets and trap nets. <br> \n <br> \nThese lakes are eutrophic and have relatively poor water quality and experience nuisance algal blooms throughout the summer. The immediate watershed surrounding the Briggs Chain is large (10,107 acres) and land use within the watershed is comprised of 33% cultivated crops, 23% forest, 27% open water/wetlands, 13% hay/pasture, and 6% developed. Because of the large agricultural influence within the watershed water quality of these relatively shallow lakes is affected.  <br> \n <br> \nThe Briggs Chain is connected to the Elk River through Briggs Creek and during periods of high water, fish from the Elk River can move around the barrier on Rush Lake and into the chain of lakes. Catches of riverine species such as White Sucker, Shorthead and Silver Redhorse, and Smallmouth Bass reflect this connection. Black Bullhead, Bowfin, Common Carp, and Yellow Bullhead are known to be present as well.  <br> \n <br> \nThe Walleye catch on the Briggs Chain of Lakes ranged from 2 4/gill net, which represents a decline from the catch rates observed in 2015 (5 10/gill net). Anglers have a wide range of sizes available to them as fish from eight to 28 inches were recorded during the survey. Over half of the fish caught were between 12 and 20 inches in length. Although there appears to be some natural reproduction, spring fry stocking will continue to be used as the   management strategy to sustain the population. Walleye grew quickly in the Briggs Chain, and reached a length of 15 inches by age three. <br> \n  <br> \nThe Northern Pike catch was lower in 2019 than 2015, but the average size was larger at 26 inches and 4.5 pounds. Fifty two percent of fish sampled were 26 inches or longer and 15% were 30 inches or longer. Anglers are encouraged to harvest fish smaller than 22 inches and release the larger pike. This will help maintain a healthy predator/prey balance within the fish community.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch numbers in 2019 were similar to 2015. Although not generally of much interest to anglers due to their small size, they are an important source of food for predators.  <br> \n <br> \nBoth Largemouth and Smallmouth Bass can be found in the Briggs Chain although Largemouth are more abundant. Quality fish up to 20 inches of both species have been documented and 39% of the Largemouth Bass sampled by electrofishing were 15 inches or longer.  <br> \n <br> \nPanfish species in the Briggs Chain include Bluegill, Black Crappie, Hybrid Sunfish, Pumpkinseed and White Crappie. Crappies provide a popular fishing opportunity in the Briggs Chain and although both species are present, Black Crappies are more common than White Crappie based on survey results. Black Crappie were sampled at a much higher rate than in 2015 and gill net catches exceeded the expected range for lakes with similar characteristics and were similar to the record high catches of the late 1990's. Black Crappie ranged in length from three to 13 inches but 62% of the crappies caught in the survey were less than eight inches in length and will need a year or two of growth before they are of interest to most anglers. Bluegill catches increased from the previous survey however, the average size was under six inches and no Bluegill larger than eight inches were sampled. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Julia, Briggs, and Rush Lakes are located five miles north of the City of Clear Lake in northern Sherburne County. The lakes are connected by a navigable channel and together make up the Briggs Chain of Lakes. The lakes are shallow and eutrophic. Maximum depths range from 11 feet in Julia to 25 feet in Briggs. They also have relatively poor water quality and experience nuisance algal blooms throughout the summer. A standard survey was completed in 1993 to update fisheries data last collected in 1982. This particular report are results from 155-acre Julia Lake.The Northern Pike catch rate increased from 1982. The average weight of Northern Pike sampled was 1.6 which was lower than expected, but a large number of pike less than 20 inches were sampled. Pike ranged in length from 13.1 - 28.3 inches and averaged 19.3 inches. Of the 42 Northern Pike sampled, 14 (33%) were longer than 20 inches. The Walleye catch rate was within the expected range of values and was similar to 1982. Walleye sampled had an average weight heavier than expected at 2.6 pounds. Walleye ranged in length from 11.8 - 27.4 inches and averaged 19.2 inches. Of the 16 Walleye sampled, 9 (56%) were longer than 20 inches. The Black Crappie catch rate was within the expected range of values, but had steadily decreased each of the last three surveys. The decrease appeared to result from the lack of strong year class development. Black Crappie ranged in length from 4.3 - 9.1 inches and averaged 6.9 inches.The White Crappie catch rate was similar to 1982 and within the expected range of values for the lake class. White Crappie ranged in the length from 7.4 - 10.8 inches and averaged 9.4 inches. The Yellow Perch catch rate was within the expected range of values for the lake class. Yellow Perch ranged in length from 5.7 - 9.3 inches and averaged 6.5 inches. Only one fish was over 9.0 inches.The Bluegill catch rate increased from 1982 and was within the expected range of values for the lake class. Bluegill were small and ranged in length from 2.4 - 7.2 inches and averaged 4.9 inches. Only four (3%) of the 120 Bluegill sampled were longer than 7.0 inches.Largemouth Bass were assessed with spring electrofishing. The Briggs Chain was sampled collectively on one day and was considered one lake for analysis. Thirty seven Largemouth Bass were sampled at a rate of 52.6/hour. Largemouth Bass ranged in length from 6.8 to 14.7 inches and averaged 12.5 inches with five (14%) of the 37 sampled measuring longer than 12 inches. One Largemouth Bass was sampled during the summer survey in Julia and was 18.5 inches and 3.1 pounds.Other species sampled included: Black, Brown, and Yellow Bullhead, Bowfin (dogfish), Common Carp, Golden Shiner, Greater Redhorse, Hybrid Sunfish, Pumpkinseed, Shorthead Redhorse, Silver Redhorse, and White Sucker.</p>",

Walleye fry have been stocked into the chain every other year since 1992. The Briggs Chain was scheduled to have been stocked in 2020, however due to COVID-19 restrictions stocking was postponed until 2021. Stocking was again completed in 2022 to get back on an even year stocking rotation. <br> \n <br> \nNight electrofishing was conducted during the evening of October 3, 2022. A total of 31 young of year (YOY) Walleye were collected across the three lakes in a total of 2.2 hours of electrofishing effort for a catch rate of 13.9/hr. This was a slight increase over the last stocking in 2021 (5.7/hr). Since 2006 the YOY catch rate across lakes has ranged from 5.7/hr to 131.5/hr with an average of 56.1/hr. Individual lake YOY Walleye catch rates for 2022 were 16.6/hr for Briggs, 32.8/hr for Rush, and 5.8/hr for Julia. Mean fingerling length across lakes was 7.9 inches. <br> \n <br> \nSurvival of Walleye age-1 and older was good. A total of 88 Walleye ? age-1 were collected across the three lakes in a total of 2.2 hours of electrofishing effort for a catch rate of 39.4/hr. Catch rates of age-1 and older Walleye was 39.8/hr for Briggs, 65.6/hr for Rush, and 31.2/hr for Julia. Age-1 or older Walleye sampled ranged in length from 10.8 to 27.0 inches and averaged 16.0 inches. <br> \n <br> \nFry stocking continues to be the preferred management strategy for Walleye in the Briggs Chain and will be stocked again in 2024 on an even year stocking rotation. <br> \n <br> \n Year   \tYOY/hr  <br> \n2006\t   58.8 <br> \n2008\t 100.1 <br> \n2010\t 131.5 <br> \n2012\t   25.3 <br> \n2014\t   88.8 <br> \n2016\t   19.4 <br> \n2018\t   61.9 <br> \n2021 5.7 <br> \n2022        13.2 <br> \nAverage   56.1</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Julia, Briggs, and Rush Lakes are located five miles north of the City of Clear Lake in northern Sherburne County. The lakes are connected by a navigable channel and together make up the Briggs Chain of Lakes. The lakes are shallow and eutrophic. Maximum depths range from 11 feet in Julia to 25 feet in Briggs. They also have relatively poor water quality and experience nuisance algal blooms throughout the summer. A standard survey was completed in 1982 to update fisheries data last collected in 1955 as an initial survey. This particular report are results from 155-acre Julia Lake.\n\nNorthern Pike abundance was about average in 1982 and was higher than 1955. Most Northern Pike were ages three and four. Growth was average. \n\nWalleye abundance was about average. Ages young of the year, one, three, and five were sampled with age three the most abundant. The Walleye sampled may be from natural reproduction, but most likely came from stocking in Briggs Lake.\n\nLargemouth Bass abundance was at least average with adequate natural reproduction. Growth appeared to be slow.\n\nBluegill abundance was below average.\n\nBlack Crappie abundance was high and fish were small. \n\nWhite Crappie abundance was about average.\n\nYellow Perch abundance was above average.\n\nOther species sampled included: Black, Brown, and Yellow Bullhead, Bowfin (dogfish), Common Carp, Golden Redhorse, Green Sunfish, Hybrid Sunfish, Pumpkinseed, Shorthead Redhorse, and White Sucker.\n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Julia Lake is located in Sherburne County, five miles north of Clear Lake.  Julia Lake is small (142 acres), but connected by navigable channels to Briggs and Rush Lakes.  The lake is shallow, with a mean depth of 8.2 feet and a maximum depth of 15 feet.  The bottom is mostly sandy, with little structure or vegetation except for curled pondweed, which becomes abundant in the spring.  The lakeshore is mostly developed with homes, except for a portion of the southwest shore.  A state-owned public access is located on the western shore of the lake, with a boat ramp and parking for 6-10 vehicles.Surveys conducted in 1999 showed that the walleye population in Julia Lake is typical for lakes similar to Julia, and has remained fairly stable from previous surveys.  The average size of walleye sampled in the nets was 16.6 inches, and the largest fish caught was 26 inches.  Many small walleye were also caught in spring while electrofishing for bass.  The lake has been stocked with walleye fry rather than fingerlings since 1983, and it has proved to be a less costly means of maintaining walleye in the lake.  Northern pike are abundant but small in Julia Lake, with an average size of 18 inches (1.3 pounds).  Like many other lakes with large numbers of small northern pike, there are also large numbers of small bluegill and black crappie in Julia Lake.  Anglers are encouraged to harvest smaller pike (less than 22 inches) to rebalance the fish community.  Yellow perch, a favorite food of walleye and northern pike, are average in number but small in size.  Largemouth bass are present in average numbers, with a few large (18 inches) individuals.  Bullheads, carp, redhorse, and white sucker can also be found in Julia Lake.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Briggs, Julia, and Rush Lakes are located five miles north of the City of Clear Lake in northern Sherburne County.  The lakes are connected by a navigable channel and together make up the Briggs Chain of Lakes.  The lakes are shallow and eutrophic.  Maximum depths range from 11 feet in Julia to 25 feet in Briggs.  Walleye and Northern Pike are the primary managed species on the Briggs Chain with Walleye fry being stocked every other year since 1990 with relatively good success based on fall electrofishing results.  Fish sampling in 2015 included bass electrofishing in May, a targeted Bluegill assessment in June, and a standard gill net and trap net survey in August. <br> \n <br> \nThese lakes are eutrophic and have relatively poor water quality and experience nuisance algal blooms throughout the summer.  The immediate watershed surrounding the Briggs Chain is large (10,107 acres) and land use within the watershed is comprised of 33% cultivated crops, 28% forest, 18% open water, 14% hay/pasture, and 7%.  Because of the large agricultural influence within the watershed water quality of these relatively shallow lakes is affected. <br> \n <br> \nNo aquatic plant survey was conducted in 2015; however in 2009 11 aquatic plant species were identified growing to a maximum depth of 5.5 feet.  Curly leaf pondweed was not found in Rush Lake; however it was were observed growing in Briggs (4.6 acres) and Julia (1.2 acres) in the spring of 2015.  <br> \n <br> \nThe Briggs Chain is connected to the Elk River through Briggs Creek and during periods of high water fish from the Elk River can move around the barrier on Rush Lake and into the chain of lakes.  Catches of riverine species such as White Sucker, Shorthead Redhorse, and Smallmouth Bass reflect this connection.  Black Bullhead, Bowfin, Common Carp, and Yellow Bullhead are known to be present as well.  <br> \n <br> \nThe Walleye catch on the Briggs Chain of Lakes ranged from 5 10/gill net, which represents a decline from the record high catch rates observed in 2009 (8 11/gill net).  Anglers have a wide range of sizes available to them as fish from 7 to 26 inches were recorded in the survey.  Over half of the fish caught were between 12 and 20 inches in length.  Although there appears to be some natural reproduction, spring fry stocking will continue to be used as a management strategy to sustain the population.  Walleye grew quickly in the Briggs Chain, and reached a length of 14 inches by age two.  <br> \n <br> \nThe Northern Pike catch was higher in 2015 than 2009, but the average size was smaller at two pounds or 20 inches in length.  Only 10 percent of fish sampled were greater than 24 inches.  Anglers are encouraged to harvest fish smaller than 22 inches and release the larger pike.  This will help maintain a healthy predator/prey balance within the fish community.  Yellow Perch numbers in 2015 were lower than 2009.  Although not generally of much interest to anglers due to their small size, they are an important source of food for predators.  Despite declines, catches of Yellow Perch in all three lakes remained within the range of expected values for similar lakes. <br> \n <br> \nBoth Largemouth and Smallmouth Bass can be found in the Briggs Chain although Largemouth are more abundant.  Quality fish up to 19 inches of both species have been documented however; the majority of bass sampled by electrofishing were between 14 to 15 inches long.   <br> \n <br> \nPanfish species in the Briggs Chain include Bluegill, Black Crappie, Hybrid Sunfish, Pumpkinseed and White Crappie.  While the Bluegill average size in the August survey was only about 6 inches, the spring survey showed that quality size Bluegill up to nearly 10 inches can be found.  Seasonal differences in trap net catches for panfish related to size and abundance have to do with water temperatures and the completion of spawning.  Generally catches are not as good in late summer due to the fact that larger mature fish move into deeper, cooler water where they are not sampled as well by trap nets that are set in shallow water near the shore.  Crappies provide a popular fishing opportunity in the Briggs Chain and although both species are present, Black Crappies are more common than White Crappie based on survey results.  While crappie can sometimes be difficult to catch in summer surveys, for the same reason mentioned previously for Bluegills, results from the 2015 survey suggest normal abundance for these types of lakes.  Most of the crappies caught in the summer survey however, were less than 8 inches in length and will need a year or two of growth before they are of interest to most anglers.</p>",

Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible.  Backpack electrofishing and a 50-foot seine were used to sample all 10 stations.  Nearshore sampling captured 23 species of fish including 4 species that are intolerant of disturbance (Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, Logperch, and Smallmouth Bass) and 3 that are tolerant of disturbance (Black Bullhead, Fathead Minnow, and Green Sunfish). <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore fish data was combined with gill net and trap net data from an August 2015 survey to describe the fish community and provide a fish-based Index of Biological Integrity (FIBI) score based on expectations for similar lakes.  The FIBI score for Julia Lake is above the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes and is indicative of a healthy fish community.  Data from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to a watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.  Julia Lake is located in the Mississippi River-Saint Cloud Watershed.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Briggs, Rush and Julia Lakes in western Sherburne County are recreational development lakes connected by navigable channels and together make up the Briggs Chain of Lakes. Rush and Julia are similar in size (142 acres) and maximum depth (11 and 15 feet, respectively).  Briggs Lake is the largest and deepest of the lakes (377 acres, 25 feet maximum) and tends to have the best water quality, with a mid-summer secchi reading of three feet or so.   <br> \n <br> \nWith a grant from the DNR a \"whole-lake\" treatment for curlyleaf pondweed was made on Rush and Julia Lakes, 2006-2009.  The treatment involves early season application of the aquatic herbicide Endothall.  Initially, it appears that the biomass of culyleaf pondweed has been reduced as well as turion production.  Evaluation has been via point-intercept plant surveys.  A native species that has responded is Elodea.  There may be other fisheries and aquatic changes to the ecosystem in the short term. <br> \n <br> \nThe Briggs Chain is overflowed by the Elk River during periods of high water.  Because of the large agricultural drainage water quality of the lakes is affected.  Catches of riverine species such as white sucker, golden, shorthead and silver redhorse, and smallmouth bass reflect the overflow connection.  Carp are known to be common as well. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye fry stocking has been successful in providing a walleye fishery in the Briggs Chain of Lakes and will remain the management strategy. This was the first survey since 1999 and an opportunity to judge the effectiveness of fry stocking as it relates to gill net catches.  Results showed that walleye catches increased significantly for Briggs and Rush Lakes and nearly so, for Julia.   At the same time northern pike populations declined.     <br> \n <br> \nWalleye gill net catches for the Briggs Chain of Lakes ranged from 8-11/gill net.  These numbers represent the historic high catch for each lake.  Small fish less than 12 inches comprised 33, 44 and 61% of the gill net catch for the three lakes. Walleye grew quickly in the Briggs Chain of Lakes, and reached a length of nearly 18 inches by age three.    Continued opportunities for walleye angling will be present as these fish mature. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike declined significantly in Briggs and Julia Lakes, but not Rush Lake.   Historically, gill net catches have been highest in Julia Lake.  Briggs Lake, which had the lowest gill net catch, had the highest percentage of northern pike greater than 24 inches, 43%.  Rush Lake, with the highest gill net catch, had the lowest percentage of northern pike greater than 24 inches, 4%. Northern pike also grew quickly in the Briggs Chain of Lakes and reached a length of 21 inches by age two. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch populations did not follow any pattern.  At Briggs Lake the catch was the same as that of 1999 and above the range of expected values for similar lakes.  Rush Lake  showed a significant increase over 1999; and Julia showed a significant decline.  Catches of yellow perch at Rush and Julia were within the range of expected values. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass were common in the Briggs Chain.  The catches for the three lakes were combined for this report.  A sample of 50 largemouth collected by electrofishing showed that 12 inch fish were common.  <br> \n <br> \nCatches of bluegill were relatively low on Briggs and Rush Lakes, though still within the range of expected values.  Bluegill were above the normal range on Julia, but of the lowest average size, 4.1 inches. Bluegill grew quickly in the Briggs Chain and reached a length of eight inches in six years.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie were most abundant on Briggs Lake.  Over the past five assessments at Briggs Lake the average catch of black crappie was 7.4/trap net. The average size of black crappie was small in each lake ranging from 6-8 inches.  Black crappie grew quickly in the Briggs Chain and reached a length of ten inches in four years. White crappie were also sampled in each of the three lakes but in lower numbers than black crappies, with the exception of Lake Julia were they appeared more abundant.</p>",

Individual catch rates for young of the year walleye in fall 2012 were 60.7/hr for Rush, 21.0/hr for Briggs, and 0/hr for Julia.  The average length of sampled fingerlings across lakes was 6.8 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nSurvival of walleye greater than age 1 appear good as catch rates ranged from 48.0/ hr in Julia, 131.7/hr in Briggs, to 182.1/hr in Rush. Otolith samples were taken from several larger walleye (10-12 inches in length) to verify their age. In each case, these walleye were determined to be age 2. This corresponds to the last prior fry stocking in 2010. <br> \n <br> \nFry stocking will continue to be the preferred strategy for walleye management in the Briggs Chain for the foreseeable future as it has proven to be effective at boosting walleye gill net catch rates. <br> \n</p>",
