                "narrative": "<p>Bear Head Lake is located approximately 12 miles SW of Ely and is entirely within a state park bearing its name. This scenic lake is largely undeveloped and its shorelines are mostly covered with coniferous tree species over coarse soil types. <br> \n <br> \nThere is a concrete ramp with an adjacent dock for public access. A nearby fishing pier is also popular with anglers. A Minnesota State Parks permit must be purchased to access the lake.  <br> \n <br> \nNine species of fish were sampled during the 2018 survey of Bear Head Lake. Walleye (33%) and bluegill (78%) dominated the gill net and trap net catches, respectively. Northern pike and black crappie continue to contribute to the catch. Good numbers of largemouth bass were also sampled during night electrofishing efforts. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye numbers in 2018 (8.7/gill net) were above the historic average (6.6/gill net) for this lake and above average (6.2/gill net) compared to other lakes in the area that are similar. The average walleye sampled was 14.4 inches which is similar to the historic average length of 14.8 inches. Seventy percent of the walleye sampled were 12 inches or larger. Walleye fry are stocked during odd-numbered years in Bear Head Lake and in 2018 approximately 84% of the walleye that were aged came from years where stocking occurred. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike numbers in 2018 (5.1/gill net) were above the historic average (2.0/gill net) for this lake and above average (2.1/gill net) when compared to similar lakes in the area. The average pike sampled measured 22.9 inches which is larger than the historic average length of 20.3 inches. Forty-six percent of the pike sampled in 2018 were 24 inches or larger with a maximum size of 32.1 inches recorded. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill abundance in 2018 (20.6/trap net) was similar to the historic average (20.9/trap net) for this lake and much higher than average (3.2/trap net) when compared to other similar lakes in the area. The average bluegill sampled in 2018 was 5.9 inches and between 6 and 7 years old. Very few large bluegill are currently present in Bear Head Lake. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie numbers in 2018 (1.8/trap net) were slightly lower than the historic average (2.6/trap net) for this lake and other similar lakes in the area. The average crappie sampled in 2018 measured 7.9 inches which is smaller than the historic average length of 9.3 inches. Very few crappie over 10 inches are currently present in the population. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass were sampled with all three gear types in 2018. Electrofishing at night is the preferred method for sampling largemouth bass and the 2018 average (63.4 largemouth/hour) was much higher than the historic average (21.2 largemouth/hour) for Bear Head Lake. The average largemouth sampled measured 10.9 inches which is smaller than the historic average length of 11.9 inches. Forty-five percent of the largemouth sampled by electrofishing in 2018 were 12 inches or larger up to a maximum length of 18.6 inches. <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Bear Head Lake is in Ecological Lake Class 7, which consists of 41 lakes in northeast Minnesota that are large, have irregular shoreline shapes, and have very soft (unmineralized) water.  Bear Head Lake is smaller than most of the lakes in this lake class. Bear Head Lake was thermally stratified on 08/23/2004 with a surface temperature of 62 F and a bottom temperature of 52 F.  Adequate oxygen for fish (more than 2 ppm) was retained to a depth of 33 ft, where the temperature was 61 F.  Bear Head Lake has no inlets or outlets.  Lake bottom substrates along the shoreline are mostly rubble and gravel, and there are large amounts of old slab wood on the bottom from lumber mill operations decades ago.  Aquatic plants are sparse and grow to a depth of 12 ft.  Riparian development, all associated with Bear Head Lake State Park, consists of campsites, a boat ramp and dock at the public access, and one log cabin.  Use of the public access requires purchase of a State Park permit.Fish sampling in the 2004 fish population assessment consisted of 12 gillnet sets and 12 trapnet sets.  Thirteen previous fisheries investigations, dating back to 1961, consisted of 3-12 gillnet sets.  Five of these previous investigations also used 6-20 trapnet sets.  Fish populations in 2004 were dominated by walleye, white sucker, northern pike, and bluegill sunfish.  Black crappie and yellow perch numbers in 2004 were lower than in recent investigations.  Largemouth bass are more abundant than indicated by the trapnet and gillnet catches, as bass are known to be \"net shy\".Walleye numbers in 2004 (4.8/gillnet) were in the second quartile for this lake class and were lower than the median catch of 6.4/gillnet in all investigations on this lake.  Walleye sizes in 2004 averaged 16.3\" (1.8 lb), which was in the fourth quartile for this lake class and was larger than the average size of 15.0\" in all investigations on this lake.  The largest walleye captured in 2004 was 31.0\" (12.0 lb).  Walleye were well distributed among ages 2-10.  Walleye growth was somewhat slower than normal (in the second quartile) by area standards.Northern pike numbers in 2004 (3.3/gillnet) were in the third quartile for this lake class and were higher than the median catch of 1.9/gillnet in all investigations on this lake.  Pike sizes in 2004 averaged 20.9\" (2.1 lb), which was in the second quartile for this lake class and was similar to the average size of 20.1\" in all investigations on this lake.  Most pike captured in 2004 (68 percent) were age three, and pike growth was somewhat slower than normal by area standards.Bluegill numbers in 2004 (11.6/trapnet) were in the fourth quartile for this lake class.  Bluegill were not captured in the initial investigation in 1961 and were first observed in the 1969 investigation.  Their numbers increased over time, with the highest catch (38.5/trapnet) occurring in 1999.  All bluegill captured in 2004 were ages 3-9, with most (57 percent) age six, from the 1998 year class.  Growth of bluegill captured in 2004 was somewhat slower than normal (in the second quartile) by area standards.Black crappie numbers in 2004 (2.2/trapnet) were in the second quartile for this lake class and were lower than the median catch of 8.0/trapnet in four assessments since black crappie were first observed in this lake.  Black crappie were not captured in initial investigations on this lake and were first observed in the 1989 gillnet assessment.  Black crappie numbers peaked in the trapnets in 1995 (14.2/trapnet) and have declined since then.  Some large black crappie (up to 14\") were captured in 2004.Many of the game fish examined in 2004 were infected with neascus.  Neascus (black spot) is a common parasite that is native to the area.  It cannot infect humans, is often removed by filleting the fish, and is killed at temperatures used to cook fish.</p>",

Bluegills were not captured in the initial investigation in 1961 and were first observed in the 1969 investigation.  Their numbers have increased over time, with the highest abundance occurring in 1999.  Many of the bluegill captured in 2010 (45 percent) were age 7, from the 2002 year class.  Twenty-two percent of the bluegill sampled  were  greater than seven inches in length.  Growth was slow. <br> \n <br> \nIn 2010, black crappie abundance was the lowest ever recorded, and was below what you would typically find in Tower area lakes.  Crappie ranged in length from 6.7 inches to 13.4 inches and were composed of five different year classes. <br> \n <br> \nSpring electrofishing conducted in 2010 sampled 42 largemouth bass.  In 2010, bass ranged in length from 7.2 inches to 18.1 inches with a mean of 12.4 inches.  In 2010, eight year classes were identified indicating consistent recruitment. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Bear Head Lake has a maximum depth of 46' and about half of the lake is shallower than 15'.  It is fairly clear and has a low chemical fertility.  It is typical of the 41 lakes in Ecological Lake Class 7, except that it is quite a bit smaller (674 acres) than the lake class average of 1800 acres.  Bear Head lake stratifies thermally in midsummer and has poor oxygen below about 25'.  There are no inlets or outlets.The total catch of fish (all species combined) is average for this lake class, and has been very consistent since the first lake survey in 1961.  Fish populations in 1995 were dominated by walleye, white sucker, bluegill sunfish, and black crappie.  Walleye numbers were in the average range for this lake class and were near the long term average for walleye in Bear Head Lake.  Walleye averaged 1.4 pounds each, which is above average for this lake class; the largest walleye caught, estimated at 12 pounds, was 31.3\" in length.  Many of the walleye caught in 1995 were hatched in 1990.  Sixty two percent of the walleye were age five or older - a far higher proportion of older fish than usual.  Walleye growth (13.7\" at age five) was slower than average for the area.  Bluegill and crappie numbers have increased in recent years.  The 1995 catch of bluegill and crappie was well above average for this lake class.  Bluegill sizes were good, with an average length of 6\" and a maximum length of 9\" inches.  Similarly, crappie sizes were good, with an average length of 9\" and a maximum length of 13\".  Most bluegill and crappie were age four or older; few were produced during the cold summers of 1992 and 1993.  Growth of each species was average at age four, then became faster than average.Northern pike numbers were average for this lake class and were near the long term average for Bear Head Lake.  Northern pike are not abundant in Bear Head Lake, nor are they in most lakes in this lake class.  Pike sizes in 1995 were small, averaging 17\" with a maximum length of 37\".  Yellow perch numbers were above average in 1995.  Perch sizes were small, averaging 6\" with a maximum length of 8\".The largemouth bass population is low, based on this assessment and on spring and fall electrofishing in 1994 and 1995.  Some quality sized bass (over 16\") have been reported by anglers; the largest observed during electrofishing was 18\". </p>",

Low numbers of hybrid sunfish, pumpkinseed sunfish, burbot, and largemouth bass were also present.  Largemouth bass are, according to angler reports, more abundant than the netting and electrofishing assessments indicated.Fish sizes were average for the area.  Some large bluegill (over 8\") and walleye (over 20\") were present.  Recruitment of the major species was good.  Bluegill growth was faster than average for the area.  Crappie and perch growth was average.  Northern pike growth was slow.  Walleye growth was slow before age 5 and fast after age 5.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Bear Head Lake is in Ecological Lake Class 7, which consists of 41 lakes in northeast Minnesota that are large, have irregular shoreline shapes, and have very soft (unmineralized) water.  Bear Head Lake is typical of lakes in this lake class except that it is smaller and has clearer water.Bear Head Lake was thermally stratified on 8/23/99 and retained adequate oxygen levels for fish (more than 2 ppm) to a depth of 26 ft, where the temperature was 65 F.  Bear Head Lake has no inlets or outlets.  Lake bottom substrates along the shoreline are mostly rubble and gravel, and there are large amounts of old submerged slab wood from lumbermill operations decades ago.  Aquatic plants are fairly sparse and grow to a depth of 12 ft.  Shoreline development, all associated with Bear Head Lake State Park, consists of campsites, a boat ramp and dock at the public access, and one log cabin.  Use of the public access requires the purchase of a State Park permit.The total catch of fish (all species combined) in the gillnets in 1999 of 30 fish/net (32 lb/net) was normal for this lake class and was nearly identical to the average catch of 30 fish/net (28 lb/net) in 12 previous gillnettings on this lake dating back to 1961.Four previous trapnettings have been conducted on Bear Head Lake dating back to 1961.  The total catch of fish in the trapnets has gradually increased over time, from 4 fish/net (7 lb/net) in 1961 to 53 fish/net (26 lb/net) in 1999.  These increasing trapnet catches have been due to increasing numbers of bluegill sunfish and black crappie.Fish populations in 1999 were dominated by bluegill sunfish, followed by white sucker, northern pike, walleye, black crappie, yellow perch, and largemouth bass.Bluegill were observed in Bear Head Lake in 1969 when a few were caught in gillnets.  Bluegill numbers increased sometime around 1990, and their numbers in 1993 (5.2/trapnet), 1995 (16.4/trapnet), and 1999 (38.5/trapnet) became higher than normal for this lake class.  Bluegill sizes in 1999 were similar to previous investigations, averaging 6.4\"; the largest was 9.0\".  Most bluegill in 1999 were ages four and five, from the 1995 and 1994 year classes.  Bluegill growth was normal for the area.Sucker numbers in 1999 (6.5/gillnet) were normal for this lake class and were similar to the average catch of 7.0/gillnet in previous investigations on this lake.  Sucker sizes in 1999 averaged 16.2\"; the largest (caught in a trapnet) was 20.7\".Northern pike numbers in 1999 (4.4/gillnet) were higher than normal for this lake class and were higher than the average catch of 1.6/gillnet in previous investigations on this lake.  Pike sizes in 1999 averaged 20.7\" and were similar to previous investigations; the largest pike in 1999 was 34.5\".  More young pikes (ages one and two) were caught in 1999 than in most previous investigations.  Pike growth was normal for the area.Walleye numbers in 1999 (5.8/gillnet) were normal for this lake class and were similar to the average catch of 6.6/gillnet in previous investigations on this lake.  Walleye sizes in 1999 averaged 14.9\", and were similar to previous investigations; the largest walleye in 1999 was 29.1\" (9.3 lb).  Most walleye were from the 1995 and 1997 year classes, both of which were stocked with walleye fry.  Walleye growth was normal for the area.Black crappie were absent in all DNR netting until they were first captured in gillnets in 1989.  This is also about when the Bear Head Lake State Park Manager recalled first observing them.  The crappie population then increased, and crappie numbers in 1993 (8.5/trapnet), 1995 (14.2/trapnet) and 1999 (7.5/trapnet) were all higher than normal for this lake class.  Crappie sizes also increased during this period, averaging 8.1\" in 1993, 8.9\" in 1995, and 10.6\" in 1999.  The largest crappie in 1999 was 13.3\".  Most crappie were from the 1991, 1994, and 1995 year classes; few crappie were produced during the cold summers of 1992 and 1993.  Crappie growth was faster than normal for the area.Yellow perch numbers in 1999 (10.2/gillnet) were higher than normal for this lake class and were similar to the average catch of 8.6/gillnet in previous investigations on this lake.  Perch sizes in 1999 averaged 6.7\"; the largest was 9.0\".  Most perch were from the 1995 and 1996 year classes.  Perch growth was normal for the area.Largemouth bass numbers in 1999 (0.5/gillnet, 0.3/trapnet) were normal for this lake class and were similar to catches in previous investigations on this lake.  Bass tend to avoid gillnets and trapnets more than other fish species, and they may be more abundant than indicated by the net catches.  Largemouth bass were the most abundant species in the shoreline seine catch in 1999.  Largemouth sizes in the gillnets and trapnets averaged 8\"; the largest was 18.6\" (3.8 lb).Neascus (black spot) was observed on many of the gamefish examined in 1999.  A few of the yellow perch had yellow grubs, and one of the largemouth bass had bass tapeworms.  Neascus and yellow grubs are found in or just under the skin and are often removed by filleting the fish and removing the skin.  Bass tapeworms larvae are found in the abdominal cavity of bass and cause the internal organs to stick together.  All of these parasites are native to the area, cannot infect humans, and are killed at temperatures used to cook fish.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Bear Head Lake is in Ecological Lake Class 7, which consists of 41 lakes in northeast Minnesota that are large, have irregular shoreline shapes, and have very soft (low mineral content) water.  Bear Head Lake is smaller than most of the lakes in this lake class.  Bear Head Lake ranks as mesotrophic according to Carlson's Trophic State Index.  <br> \n <br> \nBear Head Lake thermally stratifies during midsummer.  Adequate oxygen for fish (more than 2 ppm) in past surveys was retained to a depth of 20 to 35 ft, where the temperature was 59 to 71 ?F.  Bear Head Lake has no inlets or outlets.  Lake bottom substrates along the shoreline are mostly rubble and gravel, and there are large amounts of slab wood on the bottom in the large southern bay from lumber mill operations decades ago.  Aquatic plants are sparse and grow to a depth of 12 ft.  Riparian development, all associated with Bear Head Lake State Park, consists of campsites, a boat ramp and dock at the public access, and one log cabin.  Use of the public access requires purchase of a State Park permit. <br> \n <br> \nFish sampling in the 2009 fish population assessment was done with 12 trapnet sets.  Spring electrofishing for largemouth bass scheduled for 2009 was not completed.  Thirteen previous fisheries investigations, dating back to 1961, used 3-12 gillnet sets.  Five of these previous investigations also used 6-20 trapnet sets. <br> \n <br> \nBear Head Lake was included as a \"Sentinel Lake\" in the Sustaining Lakes in a Changing Environment (SLICE) research program that began in 2008.  Under SLICE, intensive sampling of biological, limnological, and sociological parameters will be done in 24 Sentinel Lakes across Minnesota to determine long-term changes in lakes and lake watersheds.  Fisheries sampling done in Bear Head Lake in 2008 and 2009 was part of the SLICE study. <br> \n <br> \nTrapnet fish numbers in 2009 were dominated by bluegill sunfish and black crappie.  Northern pike, white sucker, walleye, hybrid sunfish, and largemouth bass were caught in low numbers.   <br> \n <br> \nBluegill sunfish numbers in 2009 (19.5/trapnet) were in the fourth quartile for this lake class.  Bluegills were not captured in the initial investigation in 1961 and were first observed in the 1969 investigation.  Their numbers have increased over time, with the highest catch (38.5/trapnet) occurring in 1999.  Many of the bluegill captured in 2009 (45 percent) were age 7, from the 2002 year class.  Growth of bluegill captured in 2009 was slower than normal (first quartile) by area standards for fish age 6 and younger but normal (second quartile) for age 7 and 8 fish.  <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappies were first captured in Bear Head Lake in the 1989 gillnetting.  Black crappie numbers in 2009 (2.4/trapnet) were normal for this lake class but were lower than the median catch (5.0/trapnet) of all investigations since they were first observed in this lake.  Black crappie numbers peaked in the trapnets in 1995 (14.2/trapnet) and have declined since then.  The 2009 catch rate was similar to catch rates in 2004 (2.3/trapnet) and 2008 (2.3/trapnet).  Some large black crappies (up to 13 inches) were captured in 2009. <br> \n <br> \nOne largemouth bass was captured in a trapnet in the 2009 assessment, which is a typical trapnet catch in this lake.  Largemouth bass are better sampled by night electrofishing in the spring than in trapnets and gillnets, as bass are known to be \"net shy\" and avoid standard sampling nets.  Largemouth numbers were impressive in 2008 spring electrofishing, where 41/hour of run-time were captured.  A very wide range of sizes of largemouth were captured in the electrofishing, ranging from 4 inches to 19 inches.  Growth of largemouth captured in 2008 was somewhat faster than normal by area standards.  <br> \n <br> \nMany of the bluegill sunfish examined in 2009 (44 of 63) were infected with neascus (black spot).  Neascus is a common parasite that is native to the area, cannot infect humans, and is killed at temperatures used to cook fish.    <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Bear Head Lake is a 662 acre lake located 9 miles east of Tower and is contained entirely within Bear Head Lake State Park.  To access the lake by vehicle, a MN State Parks permit is required.  There is a public concrete ramp near the state park campground on the northwest bay.  Aside from the campground area, the shoreline is completely undeveloped.  Bear Head has a maximum depth of 46 feet and clear water.   <br> \n <br> \nBear Head Lake was identified as a candidate for bluegill regulation as part of the Quality Sunfish Initiative (QSI).  A daily bag limit of 5 bluegill was implemented in the spring of 2021.  This survey was conducted to gather additional data on the bluegill population prior to the regulation start date. <br> \n <br> \nThe bluegill trapnet catch was 13.9 fish/net which was low compared to some of the recent surveys on Bear Head, however it was better than the average for Tower Area lakes and other similar lakes throughout the state.  Sizes ranged from 4 to 9 inches with an average of 6 inches.  Size structure was on the small side with 88% of the bluegill under 7.5 inches long.  Ages ranged from 4 to 10 years old with strong representation from the 2012 year class.  Growth was slow compared to other bluegill populations in the area.  On average it takes 7 to 8 years for a bluegill in Bear Head to reach 6 inches.  The intent of the bluegill regulation is to reduce angler harvest which should give more fish a chance to achieve larger sizes and moves the overall population structure toward bigger bluegill.   <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Bear Head is a 674 acre lake located nine miles west of Ely in Bear Head State Park. On 07/31/23 the lake was stratified with a surface temperature of 72.7 F and a bottom temperature of 42.0 F. Oxygen sufficient for fish was present to a depth of 15 feet where the water temperature was 62.6 F. Secchi visibility was 13 feet and maximum depth is 46 ft. Aquatic vegetation is abundant in the northwest and south bays, with the northeast arm characterized by steep drop-offs and rock structure. <br> \n <br> \nIn this survey, fish were sampled with 9 gill nets and 12 trap nets. Night electrofishing targeting bass was not completed due to time limitations. Eight species of fish were sampled with walleye and bluegill dominating the gill net and trap net catches, respectively. Northern pike and black crappie were also prevalent in 2023. Walleye fry are currently stocked in odd years. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye were sampled at a rate of 11.4/net. This was above the long-term average in Bear Head and higher than average compared to similar Tower area lakes.  Walleye lengths ranged from 7.5 to 24 inches with a mean of 12.5 inches. Ages ranged from 1 to 16 years with consistent recruitment to age 4. Walleye growth was slightly below average. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike were sampled at a rate of 7.0/net. This is the highest rate from Bear Head to date and above average to similar area lakes. Lengths ranged from 9 to almost 40 inches with a mean of 24 inches. The mean length was the second highest on record and maximum length was the highest to date from Bear Head. Fish greater than 30 inches represented 19% of the catch.  <br> \n <br> \nBluegill were sampled at a rate of 24.8/net which was above average for Bear Head and the Tower area. Lengths ranged from 3.5 to 9 inches with a mean length of 5.5 inches. Bluegill greater than 8 inches represented 3% of the catch. Ages ranged from 3 to 12 years. Recruitment past age-5 was somewhat erratic, with 2016, 2015, and 2012 prominent years. Bluegill growth was slow. Bluegills in Bear Head are specially regulated with a 5 fish daily bag limit. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie were sampled at a rate of 3.4/net which was slightly above average. Lengths ranged from 5 to 12 inches with a mean length of about 8 inches. Black crappie greater than 10 inches represented 17% of the catch. Ages ranged from 1 to 8 years with no age-2 fish represented. Recruitment appears consistent, with a strong 2020 class making up about half of the catch. Growth was slower than average. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass were present in both gill nets and trap nets, but sizes and numbers captured poorly represent the population present. The previous survey in 2018  included night electrofishing and captured above average numbers of largemouth for the lake. Fish up to 18.5 inches were sampled and 45% of the catch was greater than 12 inches in length. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Bear Head Lake, located about 15 miles east of Tower, MN (by vehicle), is contained entirely within Bear Head Lake State Park.  The park requires a Minnesota State Parks permit to enter and the lake is accessed via a public concrete ramp near the state park campground on the northwest bay.  Bear Head Lake covers an area of 674 acres and has a mean depth of 12 feet and maximum depth of 46 feet.  The water quality is generally considered good compared to other lakes in the area.  \n\nAside from the campground area, the shoreline is completely undeveloped (i.e., no houses or cabins) with areas of sand, gravel, silt, boulder, rubble, and ledge rock substrates.  Additionally, coarse woody debris and aquatic vegetation in certain areas of the lake provide habitat for specific fish species.  Minnesota residents are exempt from purchasing a Minnesota Angling License for angling or retaining fish caught while angling on Bear Head Lake (following Minnesota fishing regulations as of 2014) since the lake is completely encompassed within state park boundaries.  Additionally, there is a 10 mph speed limit for motorized watercraft operating on the lake.  Bear Head Lake provides an ideal setting for fishing (pier present), camping, canoeing, kayaking, swimming (designated beach present), hiking and various other outdoor activities.  \n\nA total of eight different fish species were sampled during standard population assessments using gill nets and trap nets in 2013: bluegill, walleye, northern pike, black crappie, yellow perch, white sucker, largemouth bass, and pumpkinseed.  Gill net catches consisted primarily of walleye and northern pike and trap net catches were dominated by bluegill.  These species present excellent fishing opportunities on Bear Head Lake.\n\nThe 2013 bluegill catch rate of 22.3 fish/trap net was average compared to the catch rates observed from 1995 to 2011 (average=22.0 fish/trap net).  However, the catches are in the top 75% for this lake class.  Bluegill lengths ranged from 4 to 8 inches and averaged about 6 inches.  Bluegill growth was slow, falling in the bottom 25% of Tower area lakes.\n\nThe walleye catch rate of 8.1 fish/gill net was similar to the 2008 catch rate of 9.0 fish/gill net and slightly higher than catches from 1993-2004.  The average length was 14 inches and most walleye sampled were age-4 or less.  The largest walleye sampled was 26 inches long and about 11 years old.  Growth was below average when compared to other lakes in the Tower Fisheries Management area.  Approximately 350,000 walleye fry have been stocked in odd numbered years since 1981, but there is also natural reproduction by walleye in the lake.\n\nThe northern pike catch rate of 4.4 fish/gill net is slightly lower than the catch of 5.7 fish/gill net in 2008, but falls within the 1.4-5.7 fish/gill net range observed in 5 previous samples from 1993-2008.  The catch rate was in the top 75% for this lake class.  The average length of pike captured was 22 inches and the largest fish was 34 inches.\n\nBlack crappie catch rates of 3.3 fish/trap net in 2013 were in the top 75% for all Class 7 lakes.  The recent catch rate was the highest observed from the most recent 6 samples taken from 2004-2013.  Black crappie ranged in length from 4 to 12 inches and on average were 7 inches.  As is typical with black crappie, most fish came from one year class: 78% were 3 years old and about 7-8 inches long.\n\nA total of 9 largemouth bass were sampled ranging in size up to 16 inches.  The average size bass was about 12 inches.  Bass are likely more abundant than net catches reflect because they are better sampled with electrofishing.\n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Bear Head Lake is in Ecological Lake Class 7, which consists of 41 lakes in northeast Minnesota that are large, have irregular shoreline shapes, and have very soft (unmineralized) water.  Bear Head Lake is smaller than most of the lakes in this lake class.  Bear Head Lake ranks as mesotrophic according to Carlson's Trophic State Index.  <br> \n <br> \nBear Head Lake was thermally stratified on 08/19/2008 with a surface temperature of 71 F and a bottom temperature of 50 F.  Adequate oxygen for fish (more than 2 ppm) was retained to a depth of 22 ft, where the temperature was 66 F.  Bear Head Lake has no inlets or outlets.  Lake bottom substrates along the shoreline are mostly rubble and gravel, and there are large amounts of slab wood on the bottom in the large southern bay from lumber mill operations decades ago.  Aquatic plants are fairly sparse and grow to a depth of 12 ft.  Riparian development, all associated with Bear Head Lake State Park, consists of: campsites (some with adjacent docking); a boat ramp, fishing pier, and dock at the public access; and one log cabin.  Use of the public access requires purchase of a State Park permit. <br> \n <br> \nFish sampling in the 2008 fish population assessment was done with 12 gillnet sets, 12 trapnet sets, and spring electrofishing for largemouth bass.  Thirteen previous fisheries investigations, dating back to 1961, used 3-12 gillnet sets.  Five of these previous investigations also used 6-20 trapnet sets. <br> \n <br> \nBear Head Lake was included as a \"Sentinel Lake\" in the Sustaining Lakes in a Changing Environment (SLICE) research program that began in 2008.  Under SLICE, intensive sampling of biological, limnological, and sociological parameters will be done in 24 Sentinel Lakes across Minnesota to determine long-term changes in lakes and lake watersheds.  Fisheries sampling done in Bear Head Lake in 2008 will be a part of the SLICE study. <br> \n <br> \nFish populations in 2008 were dominated by walleye, northern pike, bluegill sunfish, and largemouth bass.  Black crappie, yellow perch, and white sucker numbers in 2008 were lower than in recent investigations.  Largemouth bass are better sampled by night electrofishing in the spring than in trapnets and gillnets, as bass are known to be \"net shy\" and avoid standard sampling nets. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye numbers in 2008 (9.0/gillnet) were in the third quartile for this lake class and were higher than the median walleye catch of 6.4/gillnet in all investigations on this lake.  Walleye sizes in 2008 averaged 13.8\" (1.0 lb), which was in the third quartile for this lake class, but was smaller than the average size of 14.9\" in all investigation on this lake.  The largest walleye captured in 2008 (caught in a trapnet) was 28.2\".  No ageing was done on walleye in 2008.  Eighty-five walleye from the gillnets in 2008 were stored in the walk-in freezer at French River to be used for an ageing study by Fisheries Research for the SLICE program; these walleye were mistakenly taken and processed for fish contaminant analysis before ageing structures were collected.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike numbers in 2008 (5.7/gillnet) were in the fourth quartile for this lake class and were higher than the median pike catch of 1.9/gillnet in all investigations on this lake.  Pike sizes in 2008 averaged 22.6\" (2.6 lb), which was near the median size for this lake class and was larger than the average size of 20.3\" in all investigations on this lake.  Growth of pike captured in 2008 was normal by area standards. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill numbers in 2008 (23.2/trapnet) were higher than normal for this lake class.  Bluegills were not captured in the initial investigation in 1961 and were first observed in the 1969 investigation.  Their numbers have increased over time, with the highest catch (38.5/trapnet) occurring in 1999.  Many of the bluegill captured in 2008 (47 percent) were age six, from the 2002 year class.  Growth of bluegill captured in 2008 was slower than normal by area standards. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass numbers in 2008 (1.2/gillnet) were higher than normal for this lake class and were higher than the median largemouth catch of 0.2/gillnet in all investigations on this lake.   Largemouth numbers were also impressive in the spring electrofishing, where 41/hour of run-time were captured.  A very wide range of sizes of largemouth were captured in the electrofishing, ranging from 4\" to 19\".  Growth of largemouth captured in 2008 was somewhat faster than normal by area standards.  <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie were first captured in Bear Head Lake in the 1989 gillnetting.  Black crappie numbers in 2008 (2.3/trapnet) were somewhat lower than normal for this lake class and were lower than the median catch of 7.5/trapnet in all investigations since they were first observed in this lake.  Black crappie numbers peaked in the trapnets in 1995 (14.2/trapnet) and have declined since then.  Some large black crappie (up to 12\") were captured in 2008.   <br> \n <br> \nMany of the game fish examined in 2008 were infected with Neascus.  One of the yellow perch was also infected with yellow grub.  Neascus (black spot) and yellow grub are common parasites that are native to the area.  They cannot infect humans, are often removed by filleting, and are killed at temperatures used to cook fish. <br> \n</p>",
