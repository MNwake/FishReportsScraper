Weights were also considerably higher except in the case of walleye. They are quite close to median weights considering how many were caught in each lift.  The northern pike were within limits of medians, along with the rock bass.Walleye, northern cisco, and yellow perch have gone up considerably, while northern pike has stayed the same, and white suckers have decreased in numbers since the last survey in 1978.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Jessie Lake is a 1,753-acre lake located in central Itasca County, near Talmoon, MN.   The lake has a maximum depth of 42 ft and a littoral area of 455 acres.  The lake has a public ramp with a concrete access on the southeast shore.  Jessie Lake is a popular lake for walleye fishing and is actively managed for walleye.Walleye gill net catch was 5.5/net, which was within the expected range for similar lakes.  Catch rates in past assessments have been highly variable ranging from 3.9 to 22.0/net.  Size structure was moderate with a few fish exceeding 20 inches.  Walleye fry were stocked in four out of the last eight years, and 78% of fish sampled were associated with stocked years.  Recruitment was consistent, all year classes from 1996 to 2004 were present.  Growth was similar to the statewide average with fish averaging 15 inches by age four.  Northern pike gill net catch rate was 4.1/net, which was within the expected range for similar lakes.  Catch rates in past assessments have varied from 0.4 to 8.6/net.  However, catch rates in most assessments have been less than 4.0/net.  Size structure was poor with few fish exceeding 28 inches.  Growth was faster than the statewide average for ages one to five and similar to the average for ages six to eight.  Northern pike averaged 24 inches by age four.  Bluegill trap net catch rate was 0.7/net, which was lower than the expected range for similar lakes.  Catch rates in past assessments have been extremely low varying from 0 to 0.7/trap net.  Trap nets may not adequately sample bluegill in Jessie Lake, and the actual abundance is likely higher than this assessment would indicate.  Size structure was moderate with a few fish reaching quality size of 8 inches.  Black crappie gill net catch rate was 1.0/net, which was within the expected range.  The trap net catch rate was 0.3/net, which was lower than the expected range.  Size structure was moderate with a few fish up to 10 inches sampled.  Yellow perch gill net catch rate was 12.9/gill net and was within the expected range.  Catch rates have varied from 14.3 to 105.2/net in past assessments.  Size structure was poor with few fish exceeding 9 inches.  Few largemouth bass have been sampled in most assessments including 2004 when one fish was sampled.  Although standard assessment gears do not sample largemouth bass effectively, the population is generally believed to be low.Other species sampled include brown bullhead, rock bass, tullibee, white sucker, bowfin, and pumpkinseed sunfish. Lakeshore owners may affect fish populations not only through harvesting fish, but also through land use practices.  It is important to leave a 30 to 50 ft buffer strip of native vegetation along the shoreline to prevent erosion and provide habitat for fish and wildlife.  Nonfunctioning septic systems can also lead to water quality problems.  Good water quality and fish populations are the direct result of good land use practices.  Anglers can also help to improve the size structure of the fish community by practicing selective harvest. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Yellow perch were the most common fish captured and the catch was typical for Jessie Lake.  Past catches have varied dramatically suggesting a dynamic population.  Most perch were too small to interest anglers, as perch averaged 7.1 inches in length and 80% of the sampled perch were less than 8 inches.  Although angler interest is likely limited, yellow perch are an important prey species in Jessie Lake. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike were the second most common fish captured.  Jessie Lake has a history of low to moderate pike catches but the catch in 2013 was quite high, and nearly doubles the previous high for Jessie Lake.  This marked increase of northern pike appears to be related to recent recruitment, as most pike were between 17 and 21 inches and were likely from one or two strong year classes (ages 2 and 3 based on length at capture data collected in 2009).  When northern pike occur at high density, size and age structures are typically poor.  Size structure was poor in 2013, as pike averaged 20.3 inches in length.  Currently, good angling opportunities appear to exist for high catches of small northern pike.  Northern pike size structure is typically density dependent and anglers can help improve the size structure by voluntarily releasing pike over 22 inches. <br> \n <br> \nThe 2013 walleye catch suggests that annual fry stocking has contributed to recent recruitment and may be a useful tool for future walleye management of Jessie Lake.  The catch rate of young walleye (ages-1 to 3) suggests that good angling opportunities should exist as these fish reach a desirable size.  .  The walleye population in Jessie Lake is primarily maintained via fry stocking so female biomass is not likely to limit recruitment, although it may be an indicator of angler exploitation.  The lack of walleye exceeding 20 inches, most notably mature females, is likely a reflection of angler harvest as larger, faster growing fish are targeted resulting in high adult mortality <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Jessie Lake is a relatively large, nutrient rich lake in northwestern Itasca County.  Jessie Lake has a total surface area of 1,753 acres and a maximum depth of 42 feet.  The lake has a history of poor water clarity.  High internal nutrient loading results in seasonal algae blooms, substantially decreasing water clarity.   <br> \n <br> \nThe fisheries lake management plan (LMP) was last revised in 2019.  Walleye were the primary management species because they are actively managed via annual fry stocking while Northern Pike and Yellow Perch were the secondary species because they are well suited for the lake.  Goals of the lake management plan were to produce high numbers of harvestable Walleye, maintain a relatively low Northern Pike gill net catch rate compared to similar lakes, and maintain adequate perch numbers to support the Walleye population.  It should be noted that low pike numbers are desirable for producing quality-sized Northern Pike and maintaining high Walleye abundance. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch are an important prey species and catches exceeding 8 per gill net are desirable for Walleye management.  Perch remained the most common fish captured and suggest that good conditions for Walleye management exist.  The 2021 catch was high compared to similar lakes and above average for Jessie Lake.  Past catches have varied considerably, suggesting a dynamic population.  Most perch were too small to interest anglers, as perch averaged 6.8 inches in length and 93% of the sampled perch were less than 8 inches.  Some large perch were present, however, as fish up to 10.6 inches were captured.  The larger perch may provide some angling and harvest opportunities.   <br> \n <br> \nPast surveys indicated poor natural reproduction of Walleye, although Jessie Lake occasionally produces high Walleye numbers.  The 2021 Walleye catch continued to suggest that annual fry stocking has contributed to recent recruitment and is a useful tool for future Walleye management of Jessie Lake.  The 2021 catch remained high compared to similar lakes, above average for Jessie Lake, and exceeded the 2019 LMP goal.  The size structure was moderate, as nearly 42% of the sampled fish exceeded 15 inches and 9% exceeded 20 inches.   Walleye averaged 14.9 inches and fish up to 24.1 inches were sampled.  Age and growth analysis identified 12 year-classes.  Frequent recruitment occurred.  The 2018 and 2019 year-classes were notably strong and comprised 61% of the catch.  Growth rate was near the statewide average with fish exceeding 15 inches in their fourth year.  Good angling opportunities appear to exist for Walleye, given the high numbers and favorable size structure.   <br> \n <br> \nPike numbers on Jessie have varied dramatically, although most surveys have resulted in relatively low numbers.  The 2021 catch was typical for lakes with similar habitats and above average for Jessie Lake.  Size structure appeared poor, as pike ranged from 19.2 to 29.1 inches and averaged around 23.7 inches.  Pike management changed in 2018 when the north central pike zone regulation was implemented.  This regulation requires anglers to release pike from 22-26 inches but allows increased harvest of small pike by allowing a 10 fish bag limit.  Only two pike exceeding 26 inches may be in possession (note-regulations for spearing are different, please consult the fishing regulations synopsis for more information).  It is hoped that this regulation will result in improved size quality of pike on Jessie Lake.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie numbers are often limited in exceptional Walleye lakes.  Crappie catches have varied dramatically in Jessie Lake but have often been low.  Several surveys did not sample crappie and none were sampled in the last two surveys.  Inconsistent recruitment of Black Crappie is a common life history trait for many populations, often resulting in \"boom and bust\" angling cycles.   <br> \n <br> \nOther sampled fish included Bowfin, Brown Bullhead, Rock Bass, Smallmouth Bass, Tullibee, and White Sucker.   <br> \n <br> \nInvasive species are species that are not native to Minnesota and cause economic or environmental harm or harm to human health.  Jessie Lake is not known to contain any invasive species.  Anglers and boaters are reminded to help stop the spread of invasive species by removing all aquatic plants from boats, trailers, and equipment.  All drain plugs must be removed and live and bait wells must be drained before leaving the access.  Anglers and boaters are encouraged to power wash and thoroughly dry all equipment prior to use in another water body. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Jessie Lake is a class 27 lake located about two miles west of Talmoon, MN in the Big Fork River watershed.  Fall, night electrofishing was conducted to sample young-of-the-year (YOY) Walleye as part of a statewide research project examining Walleye production in lakes with and without zebra mussels.   <br> \n <br> \nVarious management strategies have been attempted to produce a quality Walleye fishery on Jessie Lake.  Prior studies observed stronger Walleye year-classes were generally associated with years of stocking.  As a result, more than 10 years ago it was decided to stock Walleye fry on an annual basis but at lower densities.  The goal was to make sure fry were in the system when the environmental conditions were favorable for producing good year-classes and reduce the chance of creating the boom or bust fishery that had been observed earlier.   <br> \n <br> \nThe fall of 2024 electrofishing survey sampled 3 YOY Walleye for a catch rate of 1.4/hr on-time.  The fish ranged from 5.3 to 6.4 inches and averaged 5.9 inches.  Two additional yearling or Walleye were captured during electrofishing.  These fish ranged from 9.3 to 11.1 inches. The surface water temperature was in the low 70s F.  Visibility was poor at some stations due to algae and wind. <br> \n <br> \nThe spring of 2024 experienced an early ice-out but then a slow, drawn-out, cool spring.  These conditions are often associated with poor recruitment for natural and stocked Walleye fry alike.  Less than average catches and growth was also observed on Lake Winnibigoshish and Island Lake during the fall of 2024.. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers should note that reproduction and recruitment are variable in Walleye populations, and spring conditions (timing and water temperature fluctuations) can be an important factor in that variability.  Fall electrofishing can be an effective tool to document Walleye reproduction and/or survival to their first fall when conducted as part of a long-term evaluation, but individual electrofishing events are often a poor indicator of year-class strength or future angling success. <br> \n</p>",

Visibility was moderate to poor due to a fairly dense algae bloom and a moderate NW wind.  The water level was extremely low, preventing the same habitat from being sampled as in most prior assessments. <br> \n <br> \nThe young-of year walleye catch rate (on-time = 7.8/hr) were below the mean (on-time = 38.4/hr) for Jessie Lake, but above the median (on-time = 4.0/hr).  The fish were relatively small.  Young-of-year walleye ranged in length from 4.4 to 6.3 inches, with a mean of 5.22 inches.  The largest YOY walleye sampled was smaller than the meanlength of fish sampled in 2006 and the mean length was equal to the smallest mean sampled on Jessie Lake.  This is somewhat surprising since 2007 had a relatively early spring and warm summer.  Competition from the large 2006 year-class may explain the lower catch and growth rates observed in 2007. <br> \n <br> \nThe number of walleye observed that appeared to be age 1 was estimated at over 300.  If all those fish had been captured, it would have produced a catch rate of over 130/hr, higher than any young-of-year catch rate observed on Jessie Lake prior to 2006.   Jessie Lake was stocked with 1.755 million walleye fry in both 2006 and 2007.Young-of-year yellow perch appeared to be very abundant at several locations.   The 2006 walleye year-class appears to be very strong. <br> \n</p>",

Historically, the highest catch rates have corresponded to years of fry stocking.  Only two young of the year walleye were captured in 2008, for a catch rate of 1.3/hr of on-time.  The two walleye sampled were 6.0-6.1 inches in length.  No walleye fry were stocked in Jessie Lake in 2008.  Low to moderate catches of young of the year walleye were observed on other area walleye lakes in 2008, even those that did receive walleye fry.  Cooler than normal spring and summer weather likely reduced survival and growth of juvenile walleye.  Jessie Lake will be stocked with walleye fry again in 2010, with a fish population assessment to be conducted that year as well. <br> \n</p>",

Age III fish dominate the sample, with 66% from the 1987 year class.  This coincides with a year when 1.8 million fry were stocked.  The proportional stock density (PSD) value is 41.  The growth rate is similar to the statewide average for all age groups.Northern pike abundance is normal for lake class 27.  The gill net CPUE of 3.7 falls within the first (3.1) and third (8.4) quartiles.  The length frequency distribution indicates a wide variety of sizes, age III and IV comprise most of the sample.  The gill net PSD value is 73.  Growth is above the statewide average through age V, then a limited sample size prevents making any inferences.Black crappie abundance, indicated by a trap net CPUE of 2.1, is above the third quartile (1.7) for lake class 27.  Growth is similar to the statewide average for all year classes.  Age II comprise 77% of the sample.Forage species abundance is high.  Gill net CPUE's for yellow perch (46.7/lift), and white sucker (4.6/lift) are near or above the third quartile.  Tullibee (2.3/lift) are within the first and third quartile for lake class 27.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Jessie Lake is a relatively large, nutrient rich lake in northwestern Itasca County.  Jessie Lake has a total surface area of 1,753 acres and a maximum depth of 42 feet.  The lake has a history of poor water clarity.  High internal nutrient loading results in seasonal algae blooms, substantially decreasing water clarity.   <br> \n <br> \nThe fisheries lake management plan (LMP) was last revised in 2014.  Walleye and Northern Pike were the primary management species and Black Crappie was the secondary species.  Goals of the lake management plan were to produce high numbers of harvestable Walleye and maintain a relatively low Northern Pike gill net catch rate compared to similar lakes.  It should be noted that low pike numbers are desirable for producing quality-sized Northern Pike and maintaining high Walleye abundance. <br> \n <br> \nA standard survey was conducted in 2018 to determine the current status of the Walleye population and evaluate the success of reduced density annual fry stocking.  Gill netting was truncated at 9 net sets instead of the standard of 15 sets due to high Walleye catches in an effort to reduce mortality.  Catch per unit effort should be viewed cautiously given the reduction in netting effort, although the nine nets did have good geographical coverage of the lake and effort was similar to the previous survey. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch are an important prey species and catches exceeding 8 per gill net are desirable for Walleye management.  Perch remained the most common fish captured.  The 2018 catch was typical compared to similar lakes and average for Jessie Lake.  Past catches have varied considerably, suggesting a dynamic population.  Most perch were too small to interest anglers, as perch averaged 6.9 inches in length and 78% of the sampled perch were less than 8 inches.  Some large perch were present, however, as fish up to 10.6 inches were captured.  The larger perch may provide some angling and harvest opportunities.   <br> \n <br> \nPast assessments indicated poor natural reproduction of Walleye in Jessie Lake, although Jessie Lake occasionally produces high Walleye numbers.  The 2018 Walleye catch continues to suggest that annual fry stocking has contributed to recent recruitment and may be a useful tool for future walleye management of Jessie Lake.  The 2018 catch was high compared to similar lakes, above average for Jessie Lake, and exceeded the 2014 LMP goal.  The size structure was moderate, as nearly 60% of the sampled fish exceeded 15 inches and 5% exceeded 20 inches.   Walleye averaged 15 inches and fish up to 24.4 inches were sampled.  Growth was near the statewide average and Walleye averaged 14.1 inches at age 4.  Ten year classes with fish up to age 12 were present.  Most of the fish were ages 2-5, indicating strong year class production.  Good angling opportunities appear to exist for Walleye, given the high numbers and favorable size structure.   <br> \n <br> \nPike numbers on Jessie have varied dramatically, although most surveys have resulted in relatively low numbers.  The 2013 catch was nearly double the previous high for Jessie Lake and well above desirable levels for quality pike and Walleye management.  The high pike catch in 2013 was attributed to a period of very good natural reproduction and survival.  This period appears to have been short lived, however.  The 2018 survey resulted in a below average Northern Pike catch.  Size structure appeared moderate, as pike ranged from 21.5 to 31.3 inches and averaged around 24 inches.  Pike management changed in 2018 when the north central pike zone regulation was implemented.  This regulation requires anglers to release pike from 22-26 inches, but allows increased harvest of small pike by allowing a 10 fish bag limit.  Only two pike exceeding 26 inches may be in possession (note-regulations for spearing are different, please consult the fishing regulations synopsis for more information).  It is hoped that this regulation will result in improved size quality of pike on Jessie Lake.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie numbers are often limited in exceptional Walleye lakes.  Crappie catches have varied dramatically in Jessie Lake, but have often been low.  Several surveys did not sample crappie and none were sampled in the last two surveys.  Inconsistent recruitment of Black Crappie is a common life history trait for many populations, often resulting in \"boom and bust\" angling cycles.   <br> \n <br> \nOther sampled fish included Bluegill Sunfish, Bowfin, Brown Bullhead, Burbot, Common Shiner, Largemouth Bass, Pumpkinseed Sunfish, Rock Bass, Tullibee, and White Sucker.   <br> \n <br> \nInvasive species are species that are not native to Minnesota and cause economic or environmental harm or harm to human health.  Jessie Lake is not known to contain any invasive species.  Anglers and boaters are reminded to help stop the spread of invasive species by removing all aquatic plants from boats, trailers, and equipment.  All drain plugs must be removed and live and bait wells must be drained before leaving the access.  Anglers and boaters are encouraged to power wash and thoroughly dry all equipment prior to use in another water body.    <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Jessie Lake is managed primarily as a walleye lake.  It is currently stocked with walleye fry every three years.  The Jessie Lake Watershed Association is a very active group that is working with the DNR to restore walleye spawning habitat and maintain or improve water quality.     In this assessment, the walleye gill net catch rate was at an all time high (22.0/gill net) for Jessie Lake, far exceeding the expected range for this type of lake.  The majority of the walleye sampled were from the 1996 year class.  This was both a stocked year and a year in which many area lakes produced good natural year-classes.  The walleye caught in gill nets averaged 14.1 inches long and had an average weight of 1.0 pound.     The northern pike gill-net catch rate was the lowest ever observed on Jessie Lake.  The low abundance of northern pike may be one reason walleye abundance was so high, as northern pike and walleye compete for the same food.  Northern pike sampled in gill nets had an average weight of 2.8 pounds.     Yellow perch gill net abundance was within the expected range.  Yellow perch are important not only as a gamefish, but are also a major food source for walleye and northern pike.  Perch up to 11.5 inches were sampled (average size = 7.1 inches).     Black crappie were also sampled near the bottom of the expected range, although fish up to 12.5 inches were sampled.  Crappie have also been found to compete with walleye for food so their low abundance may have also contributed to the success of the 1996 walleye year class.     The bluegill trap-net catch was also below the expected range.  The bluegill sampled in our nets were small, averaging 4.4 inches.     The tullibee (cisco) gill-net catch rate was above the expected range.  The mean length (13.4 inches) was good and only a few (5%) had grubs.  Tullibee are also an important prey species for walleye and northern.     Other species sampled included black, brown and yellow bullhead, bowfin (dogfish), burbot (eelpout), common shiner, golden, shorthead and silver redhorse, largemouth bass, pumpkinseed sunfish, rock bass, tadpole madtom and white sucker.     Jessie Lake is one of the better fishing lakes in the Grand Rapids area.  Anglers and lakeshore owners in the watershed can help preserve this quality fishery.  Anglers should consider releasing a portion of their catch to allow more fish to grow to larger sizes.  Lakeshore owners can help maintain fish habitat and preserve water quality by managing their land carefully.  Leaving the natural plants in the lake and on the shore provides habitat for fish and wildlife, filters nutrients from runoff and helps reduce erosion of shoreline.  Maintaining a buffer of natural vegetation near the lake also can prevent geese from walking onto their lawn and creates a more natural looking lakeshore.  To further help maintain good water quality, lake shore owners can reduce the amount of nutrients reaching the water by not fertilizing their lawns (or using phosphorus free fertilizers), upgrading faulty septic systems and maintaining functioning ones.  If every user of the lake can contribute a little by following these suggestions, Jessie Lake will remain a valuable resource for years to come.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Jessie Lake is 1,753 acres, eutrophic lake in northern Itasca County.  The Secchi disc transparency during the 2009 assessment was 9.0 feet, indicating moderate water clarity.  The lake is fertile and is subject to seasonal algae blooms.  The lake management plan lists walleye and northern pike as the primary management species. <br> \n <br> \nTest netting was conducted from 8/31/2009 to 9/3/2009 and consisted of 12 gill net and 12 trap net sets.  The lake survey manual recommended 15 gill net and 15 trap net sets, but a decision was made to reduce the number of sets, as the gill net catch of walleye was high and a sufficient sample size was acquired with fewer nets.  Reducing the number of nets was also required to reduce gill net mortality.  The number of gill net sets was reduced to 10 in 1999 when walleye catches were similarly high. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch were the most common species captured in both the gill nets and trap nets.  The gill net catch rate of 50.7/net was high compared to similar lakes but was near the mean for Jessie Lake (47.7/gill net), which has a history of high yellow perch catches.  Most perch were small and only 18% exceeded 8 inches.  Given the relatively poor size structure, angler interest in the perch fishery is likely limited, but some incidental harvest may occur while targeting other species. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye were the second most common species captured in the gill nets.  The catch rate of 19.3/gill net was high compared to similar lakes and well above the median of 9.2/gill net for Jessie Lake.  Walleye catches from Jessie have fluctuated considerably from a low of 3.9/gill net in 1978 to a high of 22.0/gill net in 1999.  The 2009 catch is the second highest on record.  Relatively small fish dominated the sample, as most fish were 12 to 15 inches long and were from the strong 2006 year class.  Some larger individuals were present, as walleye up to 27 inches were captured.  The 2006 year classes comprised 79% of the aged individuals.  Strong walleye year classes in Jessie Lake have historically corresponded to years in which walleye fry were stocked as is the case with the 2006 year class.  Growth was near the statewide average, with individuals typically exceeded 14 inches by age-4.   Jessie Lake has the potential to provide good walleye angling opportunities for several years given the current walleye abundance, walleye size structure, and prey base.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike were captured at a rate of 2.2/gill net, which is relatively low when compared to similar lakes and below the median of 3.2/gill net for Jessie Lake.  Jessie Lake has a history of relatively low pike abundance as catches have only exceeded the median for similar lakes (5.1/gill net) once, in 1958 when a catch of 8.6/gill net was recorded.  In 2009, size structure was relatively good as 58% exceeded a quality size of 21 inches, 12% exceeded the angler preferred size of 28 inches, and 8% exceeded 34 inches.  Growth was average with individuals exceeding 22 inches by age-4.  Given the current density and size structure, good angling opportunities may exist for large northern pike.  Given the low density, however, anglers should be encouraged to practice catch and release. <br> \n <br> \nTullibee were captured at a rate of 4.9/gill net.  This catch rate is average when compared to similar lakes.  Tullibee catches have varied considerably in Jessie Lake as catches have ranged from 0.7/gill net in 2004 to 18.5/gill net in 1974.  The tullibee is important as a prey specie and is often associated with the production of large northern pike and walleye. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie were captured at a rate of 0.1/gill net and 0.8/trap net, within the expected range when compared to similar lakes but below average for Jessie Lake.  Size structure was moderate as most individuals range from 9 to 10 inches.  Crappie are difficult to sample in test nets and the low catch may not be indicative of abundance, but given the high walleye abundance, it is likely the crappie population is somewhat suppressed. <br> \n <br> \nOther species captured include bowfin, rock bass, white sucker, bluegill, pumpkinseed, brown bullhead, common shiner, and largemouth bass. <br> \n <br> \nThe protection of water quality and habitat is critical in maintaining or improving fish and wildlife populations.  Unfortunately, human activities often negatively impact our lakes.  Fertilized turf-grass lawns and failing septic systems along with the removal of shoreline and aquatic vegetation, mowing to the shore, and installing sand blanket beaches result in destabilized shorelines, uncontrolled erosion, and increased run-off, contributing excess nutrients and sediment to the lake and degrading water quality and habitat.  By understanding the cumulative impacts of our actions and taking steps to avoid or minimize them, we can help insure our quality water resources can be enjoyed well into the future. Anglers can further help insure quality fishing by practicing selective harvest and catch and release.   <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

Fall, night electrofishing was conducted to sample young-of-the-year (YOY) Walleye as part of a statewide research project examining Walleye production in lakes with and without zebra mussels.  The surface water temperature was 58 F.  Visibility was good throughout the night. <br> \n <br> \nVarious management strategies have been attempted to produce a quality Walleye fishery on Jessie Lake.  Prior studies observed stronger Walleye year-classes were generally associated with years of stocking.  As a result, more than 10 years ago it was decided to stock Walleye fry on an annual basis but at lower densities.  The goal was to make sure fry were in the system when the environmental conditions were favorable for producing good year-classes and reduce the chance of creating the boom or bust fishery that had been observed earlier.  The fall of 2023 electrofishing survey sampled 8 YOY Walleye for a catch rate of 4.7/hr on-time.  The fish ranged from 5.7 to 7.0 inches and averaged 6.4 inches.  An additional 32 yearling and 2+ Walleye were captured during electrofishing.  These fish ranged from 7.8 to 12.6 inches and averaged 10.2 inches. <br> \n <br> \nThe spring of 2023 experienced a late ice-out date but then rapid increases in air and water temperatures immediately followed.  Anglers should note that reproduction and recruitment are variable in Walleye populations, and spring conditions (timing and water temperature fluctuations) can be an important factor in that variability.  Fall electrofishing can be an effective tool to document Walleye reproduction and/or survival to their first fall when conducted as part of a long-term evaluation, but individual electrofishing events are often a poor indicator of year-class strength or future angling success.</p>",

The majority of the walleyes sampled were between 10 and 28 inches.  Many of these walleyes come from years in which walleyes were stocked, however, some of the fish that were sampled are clearly the result of natural reproduction.  The size of the walleyes is good, with an average weight of 1.7 pounds.     Northern pike numbers are low for this type of lake, but the average weight is 3.4 pounds.  The lengths of the northern pike that were sampled ranged from 18 to 33 inches.  Yellow perch are very abundant and range in size fron 4.5 to 11 inches.  Black crappie numbers were fairly high in this assessment but have been much lower in the past.  Their size is good, with 82% of the fish that were sampled being between 10 and 12 inches in length.</p>",

Boat problems prevented completion of all the sampling stations.  Only EW 1 and 2 were completed, along with approximately half of EW 3.   The electrofishing boat used 12 anodes in two Wisconsin droppers, pulsed DC, 5 amps and 250 volts.  Surface water temperature was 59 degrees F and conductivity was 231 mhos.  Visability was good at all stations sampled.  The water level was the lowest ever observed during a fall electrofishing assessment, which prevented the boat from sampling the same habitat that has typically been sampled in the past. <br> \n <br> \nYoung-of-year walleye catch rates (run-time = 214/hr and on-time = 246/hr) were the highest ever observed on Jessie Lake.  The number of fish shocked exceeded this rate, as many fish were missed because at times, the netter could not net all the fish.  Care must be taken when comparing this catch rate to catch rates based on assessments in which all five stations are fully sampled.  Only the first half of the lake was sampled, and since this is the section of lake that typically has the best habitat and therefore the highest catch rates, if all the stations had been sampled, catch rates may have been significantly lower.   <br> \n <br> \nWalleye sampled ranged from 5.5 to 7.2 inches with a mean length of 6.4 inches.  There were also a few walleye observed, and one netted, that appeared to be age 1.  In 2005, no young-of-year walleye were sampled during the fall assessment.  Walleye fry were stocked in 2006 and volunteers observed a record number of walleye spawning in Spring Creek as well. <br> \n <br> \nFewer largemouth bass seemed to be observed than in past electrofishing assessments, but this may be due to the change in habitat sampled due to extreme low water.  While still abundant, the number of young-of-year yellow perch observed seemed to be a little lower as well. <br> \n <br> \nFall electrofishing assessments will continue to be conducted annually.  Jessie Lake will again be stocked with walleye fry in 2007.  The next population assessment is scheduled for 2010. <br> \n</p>",

The lake is 1,753 acres and has a maximum depth of 42 feet.  A survey targeting nearshore fish species was conducted by Area staff on 27 June, 2018.  Eighteen sampling sites (100 feet long) were evenly spaced around the lake shore, sampling a variety of habitat types.  Each site is sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-ft or 15-ft 1/8th inch mesh seine, depending on habitat condition. <br> \n <br> \nShoreline seining was conducted at 16 sites; using 50-ft seine at 11 and the 15-ft seine at five sites.  Backpack electrofishing was completed at all 18 sites.  Nearshore sampling captured a total of 23 different species; 17 species by seining and 19 species by backpack electrofishing.  The species can be found in the gear-specific catch tables in this report. <br> \n <br> \nNearshore catches will be used with the gill net and trap net data from the standard survey conducted on 20 August, 2018, to calculate a fish-based Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) score which is indicative of lake health.  The surveys will assist the watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Electrofishing was previously conducted on Jessie Lake between 1995 and 2009 to determine the relative contribution of natural reproduction.  During this period, electrofishing catches varied dramatically but were often low (median = 1.3 per hour) and were a poor predictor of later gill net catches.  Despite frequent poor catches, the study found that electrofishing catches were positively correlated with fry stocked years and that natural reproduction was limited, which contributed to a strategy change in 2010.  Since that time, Walleye fry were stocked annually except for in 2020 when they were not available.   <br> \n <br> \nYoung of the year (YOY) Walleye were sampled at the end of August in 2022 on Jessie Lake with night boat electrofishing as part of a statewide research project.  Twenty-four YOY Walleye were captured from 5 stations for a catch rate of 13.2 per hour of on-time.  YOY Walleye averaged 5.6 inches.  This is the first electrofishing sample conducted since annual fry stocking began so comparisons to past electrofishing surveys should be viewed with caution.   <br> \n <br> \n</p>",
