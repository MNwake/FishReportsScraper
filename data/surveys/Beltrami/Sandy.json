                "narrative": "<p>Sandy Lake is a 260-acre lake with a maximum depth of 32 feet located eight miles northwest of Tenstrike in central Beltrami County.  There is a state-owned public access on the north end of the lake off of county road 203.  At times, water levels may limit launching of larger boats, so it may be worthwhile to check local conditions.  <br> \n <br> \nThe Minnesota Department of Natural Resources has classified lakes into 43 different lake classes based on physical and chemical characteristics.  Sandy Lake is in lake class 29; lakes in this class generally have high amounts of littoral area (less than 15 feet deep), and have a regular-shaped shoreline (few points, bays or islands).  The lake is managed for walleye, largemouth bass, black crappie, northern pike and bluegill. <br> \n <br> \nCrappie abundance is fairly consistent on Sandy, but good fishing may be somewhat cyclic. For the past three population assessments (1998, 2002 and 2008), black crappie abundance has been at or above that which is typical of a lake class 29 lake.  Crappie reproduction is typically cyclic. Five year-classes were represented with the majority either age-3 or age-6.  The angler exploitation rate on Sandy appears to be high. Crappie are just beginning to reach a desirable size for anglers at age 6 as they approach 10 inches, and no crappie in the sample had persisted beyond age 7, or 12.5 inches. <br> \n  <br> \nSandy Lake supports an abundant largemouth bass population.  Largemouth bass captured in 2008 ranged in length from 6 to 19 inches.  Sandy Lake has good water quality, suitable bottom substrates and a diversity of submerged and emergent aquatic plants that will ensure a healthy largemouth bass population in the future. <br> \n <br> \nIn 2008, bluegill abundance was similar to that found in 2002, but was below what is typical for lake class 29 lakes.  It appears that angler exploitation is also very high for bluegill since no bluegill greater than eight inches were captured. <br> \n <br> \nAlthough Sandy Lake is primarily a bass/panfish/pike fishery, walleye fingerlings are stocked every other year to provide an additional angling opportunity.  Walleye abundance has never been exceptionally high, but lake class 29 lakes do not typically have abundant walleye populations.  The 2008 catch rate of just one walleye per gill net is particularly disappointing for a fingerling stocked walleye population. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers should have good success catching northern pike up to 24 inches, with opportunity for quality-sized pike exceeding 30 inches in length.  Northern pike display consistent natural recruitment in Sandy Lake with seven different year classes evident in the sample. <br> \n <br> \nLike many of Minnesota's lakes, development pressure is increasing around the shorelines and in the watershed of Sandy Lake.  This development pressure degrades water quality and impacts valuable shoreline habitat.  Native shoreline vegetation provides habitat for fish and wildlife, filters harmful nutrients and protects against shoreline erosion.  Lakeshore owners can minimize their impact on shorelines and maintain a more natural setting while actually decreasing annual maintenance.  For more information on how to accomplish this, contact your nearest Area Fisheries office or go to the following website:   www.dnr.state.mn.us/shorelandmgmt. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Sandy Lake is a 260-acre lake with a maximum depth of 32 feet located 20 miles north of Bemidji.  The lake is located off the beaten path, and anglers should consult a county road map to navigate the series of gravel roads that lead to the DNR public water access located on the north end of the lake.  The access is shallow and can be difficult for larger boats.  Most of the lakeshore is undeveloped, with a small number of homes and one resort.  Sandy Lake is managed for walleye, Largemouth Bass, Black Crappie, Northern Pike and Bluegill. <br> \n <br> \nThe Minnesota Department of Natural Resources has classified Minnesota lakes into 43 different lake classes based on physical characteristics and the fish community present in the lake.   Sandy Lake is in lake class 29.  The following discussion makes comparisons between Sandy Lake and other class 29 lakes in the state.  Other Bemidji area lakes in this class include Medicine, Delwater, and Windigo. <br> \n <br> \nSandy Lake is stocked with Walleye fingerlings on alternate years.  The 2014 assessment catch rate for Walleye was 2.5/gill net, which was up from the previous assessment in 2008 (1/gill net) and nearly exceeded the normal range for class 29 catch rates (0.50/gill net to 3/gill net).  Walleye up to 26.06 inches in length were captured, with a good average size of 16.63 inches and 1.74 lbs/fish. <br> \n <br> \nSandy Lake has been known as a consistent producer of Black Crappie.  The 2014 Black Crappie catch rate of 3.56/trap net was also near the high end of the range for class 29 lakes (4.34/trap net).  A large proportion of the catch consisted of younger fish in the 6.0 to 9.0-inch length range, and these fish should grow to an acceptable size for anglers in 2015 and 2016.  Black Crappie up to 11.26 inches in length were captured in the 2014 assessment. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass are abundant in Sandy Lake.  An electrofishing assessment targeting bass was conducted as part of this assessment.  The Largemouth Bass catch rate was 29.96 fish/hour, which is a good catch rate for bass in the Bemidji Fisheries Area.  Largemouth Bass up to 18.9 inches in length were captured.  The habitat quality for Largemouth Bass in Sandy Lake is excellent. <br> \n <br> \nThe 2014 Bluegill catch rate of 9.22/trap net is within the normal range for class 29 lakes.  Most Bluegill captured were between 7.0 and 8.0 inches in length, with a few larger fish present.  The lack of larger Bluegill is the likely result of angler harvest, as growth rates are sufficient to produce larger fish in Sandy Lake. <br> \n <br> \nOther species of fish captured in the 2014 assessment included Hybrid Sunfish, Pumpkinseed, Brown Bullhead, and Yellow Perch. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Sandy Lake is a 260-acre lake with a maximum depth of 32 feet.  The lake is located eight miles northwest of Tenstrike in central Beltrami County.  There is a DNR public access on the north end of the lake off of Sandy Lake Road NE.  The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different lake classes based on physical and chemical characteristics.  Sandy Lake is in lake class 29.  Lakes in this lake class are typically small, with high percentage of the lake less than 15 deep and have a regular shape.  There are about 125 lakes statewide listed in this lake class, but most are located in central Minnesota.  Other Bemdji area lakes in the same lake class include Silver, Lost, Windigo, Meadow, Medicine, Little Turtle and Delwater Lakes.  Sandy Lake is managed for walleye, largemouth bass, black crappie, northern pike and bluegill.Black crappie is a popular fish for anglers on Sandy Lake.  They were abundant in 2002 but the quality had decreased from the previous survey.  The 1999 year class (age 3) is currently the dominant year class making up 64% of the sample.  These fish are about eight inches long.  Quality of the crappie fishery will likely improve as fish from this year class continue to grow.Sandy Lake provides a very consistent bluegill fishery.  Reproduction is dependable and growth rates are better than average.  Bluegill from 7 - 8.5 inches are common.  Relatively high harvest from this lake probably reduces the opportunity for large 10 inch bluegills.  None over nine inches were sampled in this assessment.Anglers would also have success fishing for walleye.  The small size of the lake allow anglers to get out of the wind.  The lake has the reputation of producing large-sized walleye.  The 2002 survey found numerous walleye in the 18 - 20 inch range and fair numbers from 20 - 25 inches.  The DNR stocks walleye in Sandy Lake every other year.Northern pike have been consistently abundant in all surveys.  The reason for this is that there are ample areas for pike to spawn in the spring allowing a consistent source of reproduction.  This generally results in lots of small fish in the population, but Sandy Lake has some quality with fair numbers of fish represented between 24 - 36 inches.There were few yellow perch sampled in 2002 compared to the previous survey in 1996.  Perch is the main food for predators like northern pike and walleye.  Other fish sampled include largemouth bass, pumpkinseed sunfish and brown bullhead.All of the shoreline around Sandy Lake is privately owned and subject to development.  Shoreline areas are important habitat for both fish and wildlife that live in or near our lakes.  Overdeveloped shorelines degrade both the habitat and water quality that are associated with natural undeveloped lakes.  The combined effects of all lakeshore owners \"fixing up\" their property can destroy a lake's valuable natural shorelines.A shoreline consists of many parts such as aquatic plants, woody debris and natural lake bottom soils.  Shrubs, trees and woody debris such as fallen trees or limbs provide a good habitat both above and below the water and should be left in place.  Natural lake bottom materials like silt or gravel is more ecologically productive than pure sand trucked in for a swimming beach.  A tidy lawn and a sandy beach make great spots for sunbathing and swimming but do little to provide habitat for fish and wildlife.  By leaving a buffer strip of natural vegetation along the shoreline, property owners can reduce erosion, help maintain water quality and provide habitat and travel corridors for wildlife.Only if more lakeshore owners manage their shoreline in a natural condition can fish and wildlife populations on Minnesota lakes remain healthy and abundant.  More specific information on protecting or restoring shorelines and watersheds is available at your area DNR Fisheries office.Anglers can help maintain or improve the quality of fishing by voluntary selective harvest.  Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for eating, but encourages release of larger sexually mature fish.  Releasing larger fish will help improve the quality of fishing in the future.  It will also help maintain a balanced fish community.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Sandy Lake, located about 8 miles north of the village of Turtle River, is in lake class 29.  Lakes of this class are often fairly shallow with two-thirds or more of the basin being less than 15 feet deep.  There are 125 lakes of this class distributed around central Minnesota.  Bemidji area lakes in this class include Medicine, Meadow, and Lost.    Sandy Lake is stocked with walleye fingerlings every third year.  Effective in 1996, walleye fingerling from the Red River watershed genetics will be stocked.  The 1996 assessment found walleye well above the normal lake class range.  The mean weight of 0.8 pounds though is below average and is in response to the strong 1993 year class.  Eighty percent of the walleye sampled in 1996 were from the 1993 year class which is a year when walleye fingerlings were stocked. These fish averaged 13 inches long.  The largest walleye sampled was 22.3 inches long and nine years old.    Northern pike abundance was within the normal range for this lake type but about one-half the catch rate found in the lowest previous survey.  The mean weight of northern pike in 1996 was 1.6 pounds which is also within the normal range but well below any previous survey.  Most of the pike sampled were 13-18 inches long with the largest 32.8 inches.  About 25 percent of the pike examined had the parasite Neascus (black spot).  Though unsightly, they do not affect eating quality.    Black crappie have been a large part of the Sandy Lake fishery though they are usually small.  The 1996 assessment found them more numerous than the average range for this lake type but less than recorded catches of 1990 and 1980.  The mean weight of 0.3 pounds is near the lake class average and comparable to previous surveys.  Black crappie averaged 7.9 inches in length in 1996.    Bluegill are common in Sandy Lake and were sampled at slightly below the lake class averages.  The average weight of 0.2 pounds is at the class average.  Most bluegill are 5.5-6.5 inches and the largest was 8.3 inches long.  Pumpkinseed sunfish are common but are smaller than bluegills.  Most of the bluegill and pumpkinseed examined had yellow grubs or Neascus (black spot).    Yellow perch were sampled at about average for the lake class.  The average size of 7.0 inches and 0.1 pound is probably too small to be attractive to most anglers.    Largemouth bass are difficult to sample with standard survey gear but appear to be present at near average abundance.  Mean weight of the bass sampled was 2.5 pounds which is well above the lake class average.    Brown bullheads were noted at near average abundance and have replaced the earlier black bullhead population.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Sandy Lake is a 260-acre lake with a maximum depth of 32 feet located about 20 miles north of Bemidji, MN.  There is a DNR public water access on the north shore of the lake with a concrete ramp and parking for eight trucks/trailers located off Sandy Lake Road.  The access is shallow and can be difficult for larger boats.  Largemouth Bass, Black Crappie, Bluegill, Northern Pike and Walleye are the primary species found in Sandy Lake.  Statewide fishing regulations apply to all species.   <br> \n <br> \nSandy Lake contains excellent habitat for Largemouth Bass.  Results from nighttime electrofishing in 2019 showed an abundant population for the Bemidji area with a good average size of 13 inches and fish over 18 inches in length captured.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie and Bluegill catch rates were comparable to other similar lakes.  Bluegill over 8 inches and Black Crappie over 11 inches in length were captured in this survey however the average sizes for these species were on the small side.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike are also a common species in Sandy Lake.  Pike up to 26 inches in length were captured but similar to the panfish species average size was on the small side at less than 18 inches in length.  Sandy Lake is stocked with Walleye fingerlings on alternate years.  Walleye numbers have declined from previous surveys and were low in 2019 compared to similar lakes.   <br> \n</p>",
