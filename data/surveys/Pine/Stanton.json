                "narrative": "<p>  Stanton Lake was surveyed on June 24-26, 1992 utilizing two gillnets and four trapnets.  Based on fish samples collected at this time, the present fish population of Stanton Lake was evaluated by comparisons with previous investigations and lake class medians (Lake Class 42).\n  The northern pike gillnet catch (1.00/set) was higher than both the previous samples (1967 and 1982) and considered normal in reference to the lake class median of 3.00/set.  Sampled northern pike ranged from 13.0-18.9 inches in length with a mean weight of 1.00 pounds which is below the first quartile value (1.51 pounds) for the lake class.  Back-calculated age data from scale samples indicated that captured northern pike were three and four years old.  Growth was slow compared to the statewide growth rate for the species.\n  The bluegill trapnet catch (4.25/set) was the highest ever recorded on Stanton Lake by DNR personnel since 1967, and considered normal compared to a lake class median of 8.80/set.  Sampled bluegill ranged from 6.0-9.4 inches in length with a median length group of 7.5-7.9 inches.  Their mean weight was 0.42 pounds which is above third quartile value (0.34 pounds) for the lake class.  Back-calculated age data from scale samples indicated that captured bluegill ranged in age from three to eight years with ages four and five representing 55% of the sample.  Growth occurred very near the statewide growth rate for the species.\n  The black crappie trapnet catch (2.25/set) was the highest ever recorded on Stanton Lake by DNR personnel dating back to 1967, but below the first quartile value (2.50/set) of the lake class.  Sampled black crappie ranged in length from 6.0-9.4 inches with a median length group of 7.5-7.9 inches.  Their mean weight was 0.20 pounds which is normal based on lake class mean weight of 0.25 pounds.  Back-calculated age data from scale samples indicated that captured black crappie were three and four years old.  Growth occurred at a normal rate compared to the statewide growth rate of black crappie.\n  The yellow perch gillnet catch (5.00/set) was down from the 1982 catch of 7.50/set but normal in relation to the lake class median of 9.35/set.  Sampled yellow perch ranged from 5.9-8.4 inches with a median length group of 7.0-7.4 inches.  Their mean weight was 0.21 pounds which is very near the lake class median of 0.20 pounds.  Back-calculated age data from scale samples indicated that captured yellow perch ranged from two to seven years of age with one nine year old.  Growth was normal with regard to the statewide growth rate for the species.\n  The walleye gillnet catch (0.50/set) was unchanged from the 1982 and 1967 catches.  The only walleye sampled was 13.8 inches long, weighed 0.90 pounds, and was three years old.\n  The pumpkinseed trapnet catch (0.75/set) was down from the 1982 catch of 1.00/set but is considered normal relative to the lake class median catch of 2.14/set.  Captured pumpkinseeds ranged in length from 5.0-7.9 inches and had a mean weight of 0.17 pounds.\n  Six other fish species were sampled during the survey (white sucker, shorthead redhorse, silver redhorse, greater redhorse, black bullhead, and rock bass).  White sucker and shorthead redhorse both had net catches of 2.50/set which is high based on their respective lake class medians of 0.70 and 1.25/ set.  The black bullhead net catch was below the first quartile value of 3.20/set.  All species had normal mean weights based on the lake class mean for the particular species.\n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Stanton Lake is a 95 acre reservoir bordering the town of Willow River in Pine County. A campground and boat access is located on the northeast end of the lake in General Andrews State Forest. Minnesota lakes managed for fishing are grouped into classes based on physical, chemical, and biological similarities.  Stanton Lake is a small, turbid, shallow lake with a relatively long shoreline, which places it in lake class 42. Historically, fish abundance has been low. The lake's management plan calls for biennial stocking of walleye fry. In order to compare the present fish population to others in the lake class and to assess the stocking protocol, Stanton Lake was netted in June of 2012. <br> \n <br> \nThree gillnet lifts and nine trapnet lifts failed to capture any walleye.  Since 1982, catch rates for walleye have ranged from 0.5 to 1.0 per gillnet, below the normal range for the lake class and below the long-range management goal of 2.0 per gillnet.   <br> \n <br> \nCatch rates for northern pike and black crappie were also below the lake class norm. Although the yellow perch catch rate reached the normal range for the first time since the 1992 assessment, perch size remains too small to garner much angler interest. <br> \n <br> \nBoth largemouth bass and bluegill were more abundant than in previous assessments. Electrofished bass averaged over two pounds while netted bluegill had a mean length near 6.5 inches. These two species currently provide the bulk of the lake's angling opportunity. <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species sampled during the survey included shorthead redhorse, pumpkinseed sunfish, white sucker, yellow bullhead, and brown bullhead.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Stanton Lake, a small (94 acre) reservoir lake, is a class 42 lake type.  On the southwest end of the lake a dam maintains the lake and is a barrier to fish movement.  Historical data incicates that the abundance of all sampled fish has always been low.  During the week of June 23, 1997, a population assessment was conducted on Stanton Lake utilizing 2 gillnets and 8 trapnets.  Night electrofishing (June 6, 1997) and shoreline seining (September 11, 1997) were also utilized in this assessment.In 1993, a revised lake management plan included alternate year walleye fry stocking which began in 1994 and will continue until the 2002 survey so walleye fry stocking can be evaluated.  Stocking previous to 1994 occurred in 1949 and consisted of an unknown size and number of sunfish and crappie.Netting results from the 1997 survey found the walleye abundance to be normal for this lake type.  Lengths ranged from 15.1 to 23.8 inches with an average length of 20.7 inches.  Walleye average weight, at 3.5 pounds, was determined from all types of netting gear.Northern pike abundance along with average weight (0.4 lbs.)  was below normal for this lake type.  Of the four fish sampled, lengths ranged from 9.0 to 15.0 inches with normal growth rates.Only three adult largemouth bass were sampled during the survey.  Lengths ranged from 11.4 to 15.6 inches and the average weight was 1.3 pounds.Both bluegill and pumpkinseed sunfish numbers were below normal for this lake type, however, the average weight for bluegill was above average.  Lengths for bluegill ranged from 6.6 to 9.2 inches with an average length of 7.8 inches while lengths for pumpkinseed fell between 3.5 and 4.8 inches.  Black crappie abundance was sampled below normal for this lake type.  However, the average weight (0.6 lbs.) was above normal.  Lengths ranged from 5.7 to 12.2 inches with an average length of 7.4 inches.Yellow perch abundance was below average, but the average weight was normal for this lake type.  Lengths ranged from 5.6 to 7.6 inches.Other species sampled in the 1997 assessment included; white sucker, shorthead redhorse, golden redhorse, black and brown bullhead, rock bass, common shiner, and logperch.  Shoreline seining showed successful natural reproduction for yellow perch, bluegill, and pumpkinseed.Prepared by Audrey Posterick, Fisheries Specialist</p>",

A public campground and boat access is located on the northeast end of the lake in General Andrews State Forest.  Stanton Lake is a small, turbid, shallow lake with a relatively long shoreline.  The lake is bordered to the southeast by homes and to the northwest by forest.  Historically, fish abundance has been low. In 2016 the dam washed out leaving the reservoir in essentially a riverine state until the dam was replaced in 2021.  The scheduled biennial stocking of walleye fry was suspended during this time. To monitor the status of the post dam replacement fish population, Stanton Lake was netted in August 2022. <br> \n <br> \nCatch rates for Bluegill, Black Crappie, Northern Pike and Walleye were all higher than in any of the pre-washout assessments with the Walleye catch meeting the management goal for the first time.  While none of the advances were significant statistically, they do show that the gamefish populations tolerated the five years of low water levels. <br> \n <br> \nAlthough harvestable sizes are present, anglers can expect smaller sizes of pike, sunfish and crappie.  Walleye and bass (based on angler reports) were larger overall.   <br> \n <br> \nOther fishes present included Golden Redhorse, Pumpkinseed Sunfish, Shorthead Redhorse, White Sucker, Yellow Bullhead and Yellow Perch. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Stanton Lake is a 94 acre reservoir bordering the town of Willow River in Pine County.  Minnesota lakes managed for fishing are grouped into classes based on physical, chemical, and biological similarities.  Stanton Lake is a small, turbid, shallow lake with a relatively long shoreline which places it in lake class 42.  Historically, fish abundance has been low.  In 1993 the lakes management plan was ammended to include bianual stocking of walleye fry through 2002.  In order to compare the present fish population to others in the lake class and to assess the stocking protocal, Stanton Lake was netted in June of 2002.Three gillnet lifts failed to to sample any walleye.  Since 1982, catch rates for walleye ranged from 0.5 to 1.0 per gillnet.  One walleye was captured in the 9 trapnet lifts for a catch rate of 0.1 per trapnet.  The catch rate from the 1997 netting was 0.4 per trapnet.  Catch rates for both sampling gears were below the normal range for the lake class and below the long range management goal of 2.0 per gillnet.  Despite fry stocking in the spring of 2002, young of the year walleye were not sampled in the shoreline seining.Northern pike abundance and size remained below the lake class norm.  The 3 northerns sampled by the gillnets averaged 16.2 inches and 1.4 pounds.  Shoreline seining failed to sample young northern pike.Largemouth bass were the bright spot of the survey.  The bass catch rate increased from just 3 per hour in 1997 to 11 per hour in 2002.  Twelve adult bass averaged 14.1 inches.  Young of the year largemouth bass were present in the shoreline seining, an indicator of natural reproduction.Catch rates for black crappie and yellow perch were both below the normal for the lake class.  Eight perch were sampled by the gillnets while the trapnets caught four black crappies.  One young perch was captured during the shoreline seining indicating that some reproduction is taking place.Bluegill were sampled by the trapnets at rate of 6.4 per net.  This catch rate is within the normal range for the lake class and high compared to historic netting data for Stanton Lake.  While bluegill ranged from 4.0 to 8.8 inches, three year olds betweem 5 and 6 inche made up 40% of the catch.Other fish species sampled during the survey included black bullhead, brown bullhead, golden redhorse, shorthead redhorse, pumpkinseed sunfish, rock bass, and white sucker.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Stanton Lake is a 95 -acre reservoir bordering the town of Willow River in Pine County.  Minnesota lakes managed for fishing are grouped into classes based on physical, chemical, and biological similarities.  Stanton Lake is a small, turbid, shallow lake with a relatively long shoreline, which places it in lake class 42.  Historically, fish abundance has been low.  In 1993 the lake's management plan was amended to include biennial stocking of walleye fry.  In order to compare the present fish population to others in the lake class and to assess the stocking protocol, Stanton Lake was netted in June of 2007. <br> \n <br> \nThree gillnet lifts sampled 2 walleye for a catch rate of 0.67 per gillnet.  Since 1982, catch rates for walleye ranged from 0.5 to 1.0 per gillnet.  As in the 2002 sample, one walleye was captured in the 9 trap net lifts for a catch rate of 0.1 per trap net.  Catch rates for both sampling gears were below the normal range for the lake class and below the long-range management goal of 2.0 per gillnet.  Despite fry stocking in the spring of 2007, young of the year walleye were not sampled in the September night electro-fishing. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike abundance and size increased since the 2002 sampling.  Both moved into the normal range for the lake class.  Overall, 9 northerns were sampled by the gillnets and trapnets.  These fish averaged 23.3 inches and 3 pounds, a big improvement since 2002.   <br> \n <br> \nCatch rates for black crappie and yellow perch were both below the normal for the lake class.  Five perch were sampled by the gillnets while the trap nets once again caught only four black crappies. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill were sampled by the trap nets at rate of 7.4 per net.  This catch rate is within the normal range for the lake class and high compared to historic netting data for Stanton Lake.  While bluegill ranged from 3.3 to 8.4 inches, only 11% of the sample exceeded 7 inches. <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species sampled during the survey included golden redhorse, shorthead redhorse, pumpkinseed sunfish, largemouth bass, and white sucker.  Bullheads were not present in the sample. <br> \n</p>",
