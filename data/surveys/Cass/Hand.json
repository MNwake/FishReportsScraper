THEY PROVIDE AN EXCELLENT FORAGE BASE FOR NORTHERN PIKE.THE 1990 GILLNET CATCH OF NORTHERN PIKE IS WITHIN THE HISTORICAL RANGE OF 5.6 TO 7.6 PER GILLNET.  THE FISH SAMPLED RANGED IN LENGTH FROM 12 TO 28 INCHES.  MOST ALL YEAR CLASSES WERE WELL REPRESENTED IN THE SAMPLE INDICATING ADEQUATE NATURAL REPRODUCTION AND RECRUITMENT.  THE GROWTH RATE FOR NORTHERN PIKE IS GOOD.THE BLUEGILL POPULATION APPEARS TO BE FAIRLY ABUNDANT AND THE PROPORTION OF QUALITY SIZE FISH IN THE SAMPLE IS BETTER THAN WHAT IS PRESENT IN MANY AREA LAKES (RSD-7 AND 8 VALUES OF 10 AND 2 RESPECTIVELY; PSD VALUE OF 45).  THE 1967 ASSESSMENT DID HAVE A MUCH HIGHER PROPORTION OF QUALITY SIZE BLUEGILL (PSD=92; RSD-7 AND 8 = 59 AND 19 RESPECTIVELY).  THE PRESENT GROWTH RATE FOR BLUEGILL IS SLOW - 6 YEAR OLD FISH IS 5.6 INCHES LONG.LARGEMOUTH BASS HAVE NOT BEEN WELL SAMPLED DURING PREVIOUS ASSESSMENTS WITH ONLY THE USE OF GILLNETS AND TRAPNETS.  NIGHT ELECTROFISHING WAS CONDUCTED JUNE 4, 1990 AND LARGEMOUTH BASS WERE CAPTURED AT THE RATE OF 23.9 PER HOUR.  THE FISH CAPTURED RANGED IN LENGTH FROM 5 TO 20 INCHES.  PSD AND RSD-15 VALUES WERE 40 AND 13 RESPECTIVELY, INDICATING A QUALITY POPULATION OF LARGEMOUTH BASS.EIGHTY-FOUR BLACK CRAPPIES WERE SAMPLED DURING THE 1990 ASSESSMENT.  MOST WERE CAPTURED BY ELECTROFISHING (57; 19.2/HOUR).  ALL FISH SAMPLED RANGED IN LENGTH FROM 6 TO 10.5 INCHES.  SEVENTY-SIX PERCENT OF THE BLACK CRAPPIES SAMPLED DURING AUGUST WERE FROM THE 1987 YEAR CLASS.  LENGTGH FREQUENCIES FROM THE SPRING TRAPNETTING AND ELECTROFISHING INDICATE THAT THE 1987 YEAR CLASS ALSO DOMINATED THOSE SAMPLES.NO YELLOW PERCH WERE SAMPLED BY GILLNETS OR TRAPNETS.  THE 1986 ASSESSMENT ALSO FAILED TO SAMPLE YELLOW PERCH AND EARLIER ASSESSMENTS HAD VERY LOW CATCH RATES.THE TOTAL FISH SAMPLING EFFORT EXPENDED DURING THE 1990 FISH POPULATION ASSESSMENT OF HAND LAKE CONSISTED OF 6 MAY TRAPNETS, 3 HOURS OF NIGHT ELECTROFISHING ON JUNE 4, AND 5 TRAPNETS AND 5 GILLNETS DURING AUGUST.  ELEVEN WALLEYES WERE SAMPLED WITH THIS EFFORT, OF WHICH ALL BUT ONE WERE GREATER THAN 17 INCHES IN LENGTH.  SCALE AGEING CONFIRMED THAT ALL OF THE 17 INCH PLUS WALLEYE WERE 5 OR GREATER YEARS OLD AND THUS NOT THE RESULT OF FINGERLING STOCKING THAT OCCURRED FROM 1986 TO 1988.  THE WALLEYE POPULATION PRESENT IN HAND LAKE APPEARS TO BE THE RESULT OF LIMITED NATURAL REPRODUCTION AND/OR IMMIGRATION OF WALLEYE FROM ADA LAKE.  THREE YEARS OF WALLEYE FINGERLING STOCKING DID NOT CONTRIBUTE TO THE WALLEYE SPORTFISHING POTENTIAL WITHIN HAND LAKE.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Hand Lake (DOW # 110242, Lake Class 25) is a 269-acre lake located about 11 miles east of Backus, MN.  Hand Lake has a state-owned public access with a concrete ramp. The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MNDNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different classes based on physical, chemical and other characteristics.  Hand Lake is in Lake Class 25; lakes in this class are generally deep, clear lakes that have irregular shorelines with many bays or points.  This lake is managed primarily for northern pike and largemouth bass and secondarily for black crappie, bluegill and walleyeHand Lake has an abundant northern pike population, and fish up to 27 inches were sampled.  Black crappie up to 9 inches were found in 2005.  Bluegill were abundant. Most bluegill were small, though fish in the 6- and 7-inch categories were available for anglers.  Other species sampled include black bullhead, bowfin (dogfish), brown bullhead, cisco (tullibee), hybrid sunfish, pumpkinseed sunfish, rock bass, walleye, and yellow bullhead. Anglers can help maintain or improve the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for table fare, but encourages release of medium- to large-sized fish.  Releasing these fish can help maintain balance in the fish community in Hand Lake and provide anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future.  Shoreline areas on the land and into the shallow water provide essential habitat for fish and wildlife that live in or near Minnesota's lakes.  Overdeveloped shorelines can't support the fish, wildlife, and clean water that are associated with natural undeveloped lakes. The combined effects of all lakeshore owners \"fixing up\" their property can destroy a lake's valuable natural shorelines.Shoreline habitat consists of aquatic plants, woody plants and natural lake bottom soils.Plants in the water and at the water's edge provide habitat, prevent erosion and absorb excess nutrients. Shrubs, trees, and woody debris such as fallen trees or limbs provide good habitat both above and below the water and should be left in place.  Natural lake bottom materials like silt or gravel are more ecologically productive than pure sand trucked in for a swimming beach.  A tidy lawn and a sandy beach make great spots for sunbathing and swimming but do little to provide habitat for fish and wildlife. By leaving a buffer strip of natural vegetation along the shoreline, property owners can reduce erosion, help maintain water quality, and provide habitat and travel corridors for wildlife.Only if more lakeshore owners manage their shoreline in a natural condition can fish and wildlife populations on Minnesota lakes remain healthy and abundant.  More specific information on protecting or restoring shorelines and watersheds is available through the local DNR Fisheries office </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Hand Lake (DOW # 110242, Lake Class 25) is a 289-acre lake located 11 miles east of Backus, MN.  Hand Lake has a state-owned public access with a concrete ramp on the west shoreline. The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MNDNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different classes based on physical, chemical and other characteristics.  Hand Lake is in Lake Class 25; lakes in this class are generally deep, clear lakes that have irregular shorelines with many bays or points. The lake is managed primarily for Northern Pike and Largemouth Bass and Secondarily for Black Crappie, Bluegill, Walleye and Tullibee (Cisco).   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike were abundant compared to other Lake Class 25 lakes. Northern Pike mean length was 19 inches and fish up to 35 inches were sampled. Large year classes in 2009 and 2010 should provide future opportunities for anglers targeting Northern Pike. Abundance of Black Crappie and Bluegill in Hand Lake was comparable to similar lakes. Black Crappie mean length was 10 inches with fish 12 inches in length present, and Bluegill averaged 6.8 inches long with fish up to 9 inches being sampled. The improved size quality of both Bluegill and Black Crappie populations will provide quality angling opportunities. Anglers may also encounter other species such as Bowfin (dogfish), Brown Bullhead, Largemouth Bass, Pumpkinseed, Rock Bass, Tullibee (Cisco), Yellow Bullhead and Yellow Perch.  <br> \n <br> \nPeople can have significant impacts on lakes and the fish populations they support. Harvest, lakeshore development, removal of shoreline vegetation, and introductions of invasive species can all adversely affect fish populations. Currently no aquatic invasive species (AIS) have been identified in Hand Lake. AIS are moved from infested to non-infested waters by anglers, boaters, and lake shore owners and can adversely impact lakes and fish populations. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access. If you suspect an infestation of an invasive species in this lake, save a specimen and report it to a local natural resource office. Additional information on all of these topics can be found on the DNR website (www.dnr.state.mn.us) or by contacting the Walker Area Fisheries office. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Hand Lake is a 269 acre lake with a maximum depth of 57 feet.  It is located nine miles east and one mile north of Backus.  The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types, based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics.  Hand Lake is in Lake Class 25.  Other area lakes in this same class include: Birch (located next to Hackensack), Blackwater (located nine miles east and one mile south of Hackensack), Big Boy (located seven miles north of Longville), and Inguadona (located three miles of Longville) Lakes.Sampling indicated an abundant northern pike population in Hand Lake.  Northern pike were sampled at a rate higher than what is typically found in a class 25 lake.  Natural reproduction has been exceptional especially during 1992 and 1993.  Northern pike from these years make up the majority of the sample and are relatively small.  However, northern pike up to 35 inches in length were sampled.  The growth rate was excellent when compared to other class 25 lakes.Bluegill were sampled at a rate similar to past Hand Lake surveys as well as other class 25 lakes.  Sampled bluegill ranged in length from 3 to 8 inches and had an average length of 5.6 inches.  Sixteen percent of the bluegill sampled were seven inches or greater in length.  Eight year classes were identified in the sample which indicates consistent natural reproduction.  Growth was similar to the average for class 25 lakes.  Age five BLG averaged 4.5 inches long.Only eight walleye were sampled during the 1995 survey.  Few walleye have been captured in previous surveys.  Most sampled walleye have been quite large (> 17 INCHES) and may have migrated into Hand Lake from Ada Lake.  The average length of sampled walleye was 18.6 inches and weighed 2.7 pounds. Past walleye stocking has had little success.  However, walleye sampled by electrofishing indicated walleye natural reproduction reproduction occurred in 1994.   A total of 20 largemouth bass were sampled.  These fish ranged in length from 4 to 17 inches and had an average length of 12 inches.  The growth rate for largemouth bass was slow when compared to other class 25 lakes.  At age 5 largemouth bass were just over 11 inches long.A total of 12 black crappie were sampled in 1995.  These fish had an  average length of eight inches.Average numbers of cisco (tullibee) were sampled in Hand Lake during the 1995 survey.  Over 67% of the cisco sampled were large enough (> 11 inches) to be acceptable to anglers.Other fish sampled in 1995 include: yellow perch, bowfin, brown bullhead, black bullhead, rock bass, and pumpkinseed.To help maintain quality fish populations in Hand Lake, lake users should safeguard aquatic habitats by preserving or reestablishing aquatic plants and natural shorelines.  Aquatic and terrestrial plants provide food and cover for fish and wildlife. They also help protect shorelines from erosion, and absorb nutrients and pollutants.  Natural shorelines, shorelines that have not been altered by man, help protect a lake from silt-laden runoff waters. They also provide excellent places for wildlife to feed, hide, and raise their young. Protection of the Hand Lake watershed is also  needed for maintaining  water quality.Anglers can help maintain or improve the quality of fishing by practicing catch and release of medium to large-sized fish. Releasing these fish will help maintain the fish population in Hand Lake and provides anglers with more opportunities to catch more large fish in the future.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Hand Lake is a 269-acre lake, 140 of which are littoral (less than 15 feet deep) with 5.83 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 57 feet. Hand Lake located 11 miles north east of Backus and 15 miles south west of Longville, MN. A DNR owned public access is located in the south western bay.  Hand Lake has a small outlet stream that flows into Lake Ada. The DNR has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different classes based on physical, chemical and other characteristics. Hand Lake is in Lake Class 25; lakes in this class are generally deep, clear lakes that have irregular shorelines with many bays and points. Other area lakes in this class include Hattie, Birch, Long (by Longville), Blackwater and Girl.  The lake is managed primarily for Northern Pike and Largemouth Bass and secondarily for Black Crappie, Bluegill, Walleye and Tullibee (Cisco).   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike are abundant in Hand Lake and size quality is generally low with most fish being 16 to 21 inches; however, some quality size Northern Pike up to 36 inches were sampled.  Anglers are encouraged to harvest the abundant Northern Pike less than 22 inches. Largemouth Bass are moderately abundant, and fish sampled in 2019 ranged from 8 to 17 inches long. Black Crappie are present with fish up to 12 inches sampled. Bluegill are abundant with quality-sized fish present. Bluegill lengths ranged from 3 to 9 inches with 56 percent of the sample measuring 7 inches or greater in length. Walleye management was discontinued in 2014 due to poor returns from stocking efforts. Walleye continue to be present in low numbers with only one 28 inch fish was sampled in 2019. Tullibee (Cisco) are present with fish up to 19 inches observed.  <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species that anglers can expect to encounter include, Bowfin (Dogfish), Brown Bullhead, Black Bullhead, Yellow Bullhead, Hybrid Sunfish, Pumpkinseed and Rock Bass. <br> \n <br> \nPeople can have significant impacts on lakes and the fish populations they support. Harvest, lakeshore development, removal of shoreline vegetation, and introductions of invasive species can all adversely affect fish populations. In July of 2019 adult Zebra Mussels were discovered on a boat docked on Hand Lake. Extra caution should be used when leaving this lake for other waters.  AIS are moved from infested to non-infested waters by anglers, boaters, and lake shore owners and can adversely impact lakes and fish populations. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access. If you suspect an infestation of an invasive species in this lake, save a specimen and report it to a local natural resource office. Additional information on all of these topics can be found on the DNR website (www.dnr.state.mn.us) or by contacting the Walker Area Fisheries office. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of nearshore fish species in Hand Lake was conducted on July 24, 2019 by Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program Staff.  Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible.  Backpack electrofishing was completed at all ten sampling stations, but two stations were sampled from the boat due to site conditions.  Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample five stations, a 15-foot seine was used at two stations, and site conditions prevented the use of seines at three stations.  Nearshore sampling captured 20 species of fish including seven species that are intolerant of disturbance (i.e., Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, Mottled Sculpin, Pugnose Shiner, and Rock Bass) and one that is tolerant of disturbance (i.e., Green Sunfish). <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore data were combined with trap net and gill net data from a June 2019 survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based IBI (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment.  In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g., Blackchin Shiner, Iowa Darter, and Rock Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g., Green Sunfish).  The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake.  For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.   <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey indicates Hand Lake is healthy as indicated by an exceptionally high FIBI score, well above the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes.  Data from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Pine River Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Hand Lake is eight miles east of the town of Backus in central Cass County.  Hay Lake drains into Hand Lake and Hand Lake drains into Ada Lake. The Department of Natural Resources has classified lakes into 43 lake classes based on chemical and physical characteristics of the lakes.  Hand Lake is in Lake Class 25.  Lakes in this lake class are characterized as moderately deep clear lakes that are irregular in shape.  The watershed (land      around the lake) is composed mostly of undeveloped forests and wetlands.  Agricultural land is a small part of the watershed.  Most of the shoreline is privately owned.  The number of lake homes on Hand Lake has increased to 94 compared to only 41 in 1967.  There is a DNR owned concrete public access on the south end of the lake off of county road 49.There are a variety of angling opportunities for anglers.  Northern pike, largemouth bass, bluegill, and black crappie are popular with anglers on Hand Lake.  Northern pike abundance in 2000 is typical of other Lake Class 25 lakes.  Most of the northern pike were small (14 to 20 inches) but a few are of quality size.  Most of the northern pike were two to five years old.Bluegill on Hand Lake are popular with anglers.  Bluegills sampled in 2000 were nice size with numbers of fish over seven inches long.  However, in 1967, bluegill showed better quality, and it appears that anglers are starting to affect the quality of bluegill.  To maintain or improve quality, anglers need to use some restraint if large panfish are really biting.  Anglers should release the larger panfish and keep the smaller ones for eating.  Quality size panfish have disappeared from many lakes due to excessive harvest by anglers.Only three walleye were sampled in Hand Lake in 2000.  Walleye never were abundant in Hand Lake.  Walleye were stocked in Hand Lake in 1986, 1987, and 1988 but did not help bolster the population.  The few walleye that are in Hand Lake are of quality size.  During the spring walleye spawning run, walleye may move up into Hand Lake from Ada Lake.Anglers can help maintain or improve the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for table fare, but encourages release of medium to large size fish.  Releasing medium to large size fish will provide anglers with opportunities to catch more and larger fish in the future and can help maintain balance in the fish community.        Shoreline areas - on the land and into the shallow water - provide essential habitat for fish and wildlife that live in or near Minnesota's lakes.  Overdeveloped shorelines can't support the fish, wildlife, and clean waters that are associated with natural undeveloped lakes.  The combined effects of all lakeshore owners \"fixing up\" their property can destroy a lake's valuable natural shorelines.A shoreline habitat consists of aquatic plants, woody plants, and natural lake bottom soils.  Shrubs, trees, and woody debris such as fallen trees or limbs provide a good habitat both above and below the water and should be left in place.  Natural lake bottom materials like silt or gravel is more ecologically productive that pure sand trucked in for a swimming beach.  A tidy lawn and a sandy beach make great spots for sunbathing and swimming but do little to provide habitat for fish and wildlife.  By leaving a buffer strip of natural vegetation along the shoreline, property owners can reduce erosion, help maintain water quality, and provide habitat and travel corridors for wildlife.Only if more lakeshore owners manage their shoreline in a natural condition can fish and wildlife populations on Minnesota lakes remain healthy and abundant.  More specific information on protecting or restoring shorelines and watersheds is available through DNR Fisheries offices.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of nearshore fish species in Hand Lake was conducted on August 22, 2022, by DNR Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program staff. Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake, and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at eight sampling stations, but two stations were sampled from the boat due to site conditions. Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample six stations, a 15-foot seine was used at one station, and site conditions prevented the use of seines at three stations. Nearshore sampling captured 22 species of fish including seven species that are intolerant of disturbance (i.e., Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, Mottled Sculpin, Pugnose Shiner, and Rock Bass) and one that is tolerant of disturbance (i.e., Green Sunfish). <br> \n <br> \nA summer trap net survey was also conducted by IBI Program staff on August 22-24, 2022. Nine trap nets were set along the shoreline in locations that encompassed multiple habitat types. Trap net sampling captured 10 species of fish, including one that is tolerant of disturbance (i.e., Black Bullhead). Bluegill comprised a majority of the catch by number, whereas Bowfin, Bluegill, and Largemouth Bass comprised a majority by biomass. <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore and trap net were combined with gill net data from a 2019 survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based IBI (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment. In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g., Blacknose Shiner, Blackchin Shiner, Iowa Darter), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g., Green Sunfish). The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.  <br> \n <br> \nA temperature-dissolved oxygen profile was collected in the deepest basin on Hand Lake on August 22nd, 2022, to evaluate the amount of cold, oxygenated water (i.e., oxythermal habitat) available to Cisco, also known as Tullibee. Based on the profile, the top of the thermocline (i.e., the location in the water column with the sharpest transition from warm to cold water) occurred at approximately 16 feet. Dissolved oxygen decreased to below 3.0 mg/L at 16.4 feet, which was within the thermocline, at the time of sampling. The temperature at which dissolved oxygen decreased to below 3.0 mg/L (i.e., TDO3, a single variable to characterize oxythermal habitat) was 19.7?C (68.0?F). <br> \n <br> \nTDO3 values near 21.5?C indicate that oxythermal conditions are marginal for Cisco. Dissolved oxygen concentrations near the thermocline indicate that oxythermal habitat was adequate for Cisco at limited depths at the time of sampling during the summer of 2022. However, low dissolved oxygen concentrations (less than 3 mg/L) below the thermocline and warm surface temperatures would likely limit available Cisco habitat within the water column to an extent. Data collected in 1990 indicated suitable oxythermal habitat at that time. When adequate oxythermal habitat is available, Cisco are not squeezed into unfavorable, warmer water conditions and therefore do not experience higher levels of stress. <br> \n <br> \nResults from the FIBI survey indicate that the warmwater fish community in Hand Lake is healthy as indicated by an FIBI score that is near the exceptional use threshold determined for similar lakes. Data from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Pine River Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency. <br> \n</p>",
