                "narrative": "<p>Northern pike and pumpkinseed net catches exceeded the third quartile of the regional median, thus indications are that an above average population exist. Pounds/lift were also above average. Black bullhead, brown bullhead, bluegill, largemouth bass, yellow perch and walleye net catches fell between the first and third quartile of the regional median, indicating a population which is average for this region. The yellow bullhead net catches were below the first quartile of the region median indicating a low population. Three gillnets were set in June of 1980 and 1986. Five gillnets were set in July of 1967. Northern pike abundance in 1986 is comparable to the 1967 netting, but significantly lower than the 1980 netting. The yellow perch population in 1986 is comparable to the netting and significantly higher than the 1980 netting. Walleye net catches in 1986 is comparable to the 1980 netting but significantly higher than the 1967 netting. Northern pike age classes 1-7 were present in the nets with age class 2 being the dominate group present. Age classes 4 and 6 exhibited an average growth rate while the other age classes had above average growth rates when compared to the statewide growth rate averages. The length frequency range was from 15.2-39.3 inches, with the median length being in the 21' group and weighing approximately 2.4 lbs which is larger than past surveys. Perry Lake, being an occasional winterkill lake, has great fluctuation in fish populations and structure. This is very noticeable in the bullhead populations. Black bullhead went from 14.6/trapnet and 0.0 in gillnets in 1967 to 47.0/trapnet and 7.7 in the gillnets. Yellow and brown bullhead abundance was highest in 1967 and has dropped in the last two surveys. Pumpkinseed in the net catches had a size range of 4.5- 8.4 inches with the median size approximately 7.0 inches. The mean weight was 0.3 lbs. Bluegill net catches in 1986 (18.8/trapnet) has rebounded from the 0.3/trapnet in 1980. The size range in 1986 was 3.5-9.9 inches with a mean weight was 0.3 lbs. Age classes 3-6 were present in the net catches with growth rates being average in all age classes when compared to statewide averages. Largemouth bass were present in low numbers as it was in past years. Only one fish was caught and it was in the 15\" group and weighed 2.3 lbs. Black crappie age classes 2-5 were present in the nets with age class 2 showing slow growth while the other age classes exhibited average growth. The 4.5-5.9 inch group comprises 84% of the black crappie population. The abundance has improved dramatically with 0 black crappie taken in the trapnets or gillnets in 1980 to 29/trapnet and 33.7/gillnet in 1986. Yellow perch size structure ranged from 4.0-8.9 inches with 6.0-6.4 inches being the median size group present. The population has rebounded from 0.0/gillnet in 1980 to 21.7/gillnet in 1986. Walleye age classes 5 and 7 were present with fish averaging 16.9 inches (5 fish) at annuli 5 and 17.0 inches (2 fish) at annuli 7. The walleye ranged from 16.0 inches to 23.9 inches. In comparing walleye age classes present and stocking records since 1980, only the fry stocking of 1981 took hold. This was a period immediately after our 1980 netting which showed all species except black bullheads present at lower levels than they were in 1986.</p>",

A public access is located on the east side of the lake.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappies are one of the main species targeted by anglers on Perry.  Black crappies were captured in high numbers when compared to similar lakes in both trapnets (7.6/net) and gillnets (8.5/net).  Average size was 8.4\" in trapnets, and 6.9\" in gillnets.  For both gear types combined, 56% were at least 8\" in length.  The bluegill catch of 25.3/trapnet was high when compared to similar lakes.  Average length was 6.3\", with 19% at least 7\" in length.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike were sampled in average numbers at 9.0/gillnet.  Size was quite nice with an average of 26.0\" and 4.1 lbs, with 61% measured at least 24\" in length.  Northern pike up to 35.2\" were sampled.  Voluntary catch and release of these larger fish will help maintain a balanced population. <br> \n <br> \nThe most abundant species in Perry are black bullheads.  They were sampled in high numbers in both gillnets (78.0/net) and trapnets (160.7/net).   <br> \n <br> \nWalleye fry are stocked occasionally into Perry following partial winterkill.   None were sampled in this survey, although a few may be present.  Dissolved oxygen testing on April 5, 2018 showed fairly low levels (2.3 ppm) below the ice.  Further monitoring will determine whether walleye fry stocking will be triggered.   <br> \n <br> \nTo help prevent the spread of invasive species lake users are required to inspect and remove any aquatic plants and animals from their watercraft and trailers, as well as pull the plug and drain all water from the watercraft, including bilges, livewells and baitwells. <br> \n</p>",
