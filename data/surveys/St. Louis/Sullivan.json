                "narrative": "<p>Sullivan is a 31 acre lake with 31 (100%) acres of littoral area and a maximum depth of seven feet.  Sullivan Lake is located eight miles southeast of Markham, MN off County #547.  Fish population investigations have been conducted in 1960 and 1999.     Yellow perch abundance indexed with assessment nets was 6.1 per lift in 1999.  This index value was higher than other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Size and growth of yellow perch was poor.  Mean length of sampled yellow perch was 6.4 inches and length at the beginning of their fourth year of life was 5.5 inches.     Black bullhead abundance indexed with assessment nets was 8.0 per lift in 1999.  Mean length of sampled bullheads was 6.0 inches.     Bluegill and pumpkinseed sunfish were both sampled at a low rate during the 1999 survey.  Size and growth of bluegill was poor.  Mean length of sampled bluegill was 4.5 inches and length at the beginning of their fourth year of life was 3.7 inches.  Mean length of sampled pumpkinseed sunfish was 3.9 inches.     White sucker abundance indexed with assessment nets was 9.3 per lift in 1999.  This index value is much higher than other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Mean length of sampled white sucker was 7.7 inches.     Other fish species sampled during the 1999 lake survey include creek chub, common shiner and golden shiner.  Sullivan Lake currently supports a very low quality fish population.  This may be caused by shallow depth which contributes to low oxygen levels during the winter.  Other limiting factors include low water clarity (2.2 feet), low pH (5.3), low alkalinity (6) and low density of aquatic plants.</p>",
