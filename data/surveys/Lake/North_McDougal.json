                "narrative": "<p>North McDougal Lake is the lower lake of the three McDougal Lakes and is located approximately 9 miles west of Isabella. The lake has a maximum depth of 13 feet and has brown-stained water with a Secchi disc visible to a depth of 4.0 feet. There is a federal boat launch and campground on the east end of the lake.  <br> \n <br> \nThe fish community in North McDougal Lake is comprised of walleyes, northern pike, yellow perch, smallmouth bass, bluegills, rock bass and white suckers. In 2006 walleyes were sampled in average numbers, which is normal for this lake. Walleyes were smaller than average compared to other lakes in this class, with a mean weight of just over 0.5 pounds per fish. The most common size sampled in 2006 was in the 12 to 13 inch range, and the largest walleye sampled was 21.5 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike were sampled in average numbers in 2006, with an average weight of about 1.2 pound per fish. Fish up to 30.3 inches were taken however only two fish in the sample were larger than 22 inches.    <br> \n <br> \nThe yellow perch catch in 2006 was in the normal range, with fish up to 11.4 inches sampled and approximately one third of the fish in the 8.5 to 10 inch range. <br> \n <br> \nSmallmouth bass and bluegills were sampled for the first time in this lake in 2006 and are likely the result of unauthorized stockings. Smallmouth bass were sampled in average numbers, with some fish in the 16-18 inch range captured. Bluegills were sampled in relatively low numbers with a few fish larger than 8.0 inches captured. <br> \n</p>",

A fee is charged for overnight camping at North McDougal Lake Campground.  The lake has dark bog stained water and like most lakes in the area, boulders are present. Caution is advised when boating on the McDougal chain. <br> \n <br> \nThe 2009 walleye population in North McDougal Lake was below average for the lake class although similar to past investigations. The average length was 11.5 inches with 10% of the catch larger than 16 inches. Reports from local fishermen indicate that the lake has smaller walleyes than average for the area, with an occasional large fish taken. <br> \n  <br> \nNorthern pike numbers were below average for the lake class although similar to catches in previous assessments on the lake.  The average length was smaller than average at 19.4 inches. Even so, northern pike over 30 inches were sampled in 2009.  <br> \nYellow perch numbers were below average but size was above average with 23% of the catch greater than nine inches. <br> \n   <br> \nBluegills were first sampled in trap nets in 2006 and their numbers are increasing. Bluegill numbers are slightly below average for the lake class with an average length of 7.8 inches.  <br> \nSmallmouth bass were also sampled for the first time in 2006. Two fish were caught in this assessment with the largest fish 17.5 inches and 2.8 pounds. Smallmouth bass are difficult to sample; the 2009 catch may not represent the actual smallmouth bass fishery. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>North McDougal Lake is in Lake County about ten miles west of Isabella and is within the Superior National Forest. There is a Forest Service campground with a concrete log boat ramp and dock that provides public access to the lake, as well as other connected waterbodies known collectively as the McDougal Chain of Lakes. These lakes have dark bog-colored water and are shallow but have diverse habitat that supports a naturally reproducing fish community with several popular species. <br> \n <br> \nThe 2023 Walleye catch was within the normal range and near the average from eleven historic surveys of the lake. The size structure of the population remains small with an average length of 12.8\" and average weight of 0.74 pounds. Analysis determined ten unique year classes were sampled with nearly half the catch from 2018 and 2020, collectively. Growth was slow compared to other area lakes with Walleye reaching just 13\" long at age-5.  <br> \n <br> \nBluegill catch has increased in each survey completed on the lake since they were first sampled in 2006. The population has a good size structure with an average length of nearly 8\" and fish over 10\" long present. Bluegill ranged from two to ten years old with each year class between also sampled. The 2017 year class accounted for 31% of the catch with fish from this year class ranging from 8.1 to 9.5\" long. Growth was good compared to other area lakes and compared to statewide averages. Results from this survey confirm that Bluegill have established a naturalized population that provides anglers with quality opportunities that are unique to the area.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike catch decreased to 2.17 per gill net in 2023 but was within the normal range and similar to historic surveys of the lake. Pike ranged from 9 to 41\" long with an average size of about 21\" long and 2.25 pounds. Age analysis determined consistent Northern Pike reproduction and recruitment in recent years. Anglers should continue to have decent opportunities for pike for the foreseeable future.   <br> \n <br> \nA small number of Smallmouth Bass were again sampled in 2023, which continued a trend of low catches observed since the species was first sampled in North McDougal Lake in 2006. Anglers may have a hard time targeting the species because of low abundance but might catch some bass incidentally while fishing for other species.</p>",

Northern Pike densities appear to be slightly lower than in previous assessments. Most Northern Pike are of less than acceptable size to the angler as maximum size sampled was only 17\".

Test nets in 1996 found walleye abundance about average compared to similar lakes in this class although sampled in lower numbers than in the 1991 assessment. Walleye ranged in size from 6.7 inches to 23.3 inches (4.3 pounds). The average size of walleye collected (11.2 inches) was below average for this lake class and smaller than in previous assessments. Over 80% of the walleye were smaller than 14 inches.     Northern pike abundance is average compared to similar lakes and is typical of previous net catches in this lake. Northern pike ranged in size from 9.5 inches to 34.6 inches (10.4 pounds). A small number of northern pike from 3.6 pounds - 5.7 pounds were sampled but over 80% were smaller than 1.7 pounds.     Yellow perch are present in average numbers and of sufficent size to be acceptable to anglers. Yellow perch ranged in size from 5.0 inches - 13.2 inches with approximately 31% in the 8.0 inch - 10.5 inch range.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of the Bluegill and Smallmouth Bass populations was completed in June to monitor the abundance of both species. Both species were first sampled in the McDougal Chain of Lakes in 2000. Special spring trap netting collected a larger number of Bluegill compared to standard summer trap netting, but the catch rate and size distribution were similar between both methods. Most of the fish sampled were greater than eight inches long with the largest measuring over eleven inches long. Age analysis identified ten unique year classes and much of the catch was between six and nine years old. These results confirm Bluegill have naturalized in the McDougal Chain of Lakes and the current population is dominated by older fish that can be susceptible to overharvest.  <br> \n <br> \nOnly a small number of Smallmouth Bass were sampled during spring trap netting and special night electrofishing, but the largest bass was over nineteen inches long. The low abundance and wide length distribution indicate a small population with limited recruitment continues to be maintain by natural reproduction. For more information about the fish community of North McDougal Lake see the standard survey dated July 10, 2023.</p>",

The lake is accessible through a public road to the east end of the lake, or through private roads to the northwest end. There is one resort and a children's camp on the lake.     Water levels are maintained by a dam on the outlet, and usually fluctuate less than 1.5 feet in a year.</p>",

Walleye were generally on the small side, averaging less than 1.0 pound.Test nets sampled northern pike in averge numbers with fish up to 36 inches (11.0 pounds) taken.  Average size was about 1.7 pounds.Yellow perch were collected in average numbers with some \"keeper size\" fish present.  Yellow perch up to 12 inches were sampled and approximately 33% of all the perch taken ranged between 9 inches and 11 inches.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>North McDougal Lake is located in Lake County approximately 9 miles west of Isabella.  It has a surface area of 273 acres and a maximum depth of 13 feet.  There is a concrete boat ramp in the northeast corner of the lake with a dock and an outhouse. This is also the access to Fourth McDougal, Middle McDougal, and South McDougal lakes; these lakes can be accessed from North McDougal by connecting channels.  The lake shore is in a combination of private and federal ownership.  There are cabins scattered along the south and west shores, there is a youth camp on the west shore, and there is a 26 site forest service fee campground on the north shore adjacent to the access.  The lake has dark bog stained water and like most lakes in the area and boulders are present; caution is advised when boating on the McDougal chain. <br> \n <br> \nNorth McDougal Lake has two inlets and one outlet.  The Stony River enters North McDougal Lake from the east.  Coyote Creek flows into the southwest corner of North McDougal Lake from South McDougal Lake, this forms the channel connecting North McDougal Lake to South McDougal Lake, small side channels off of this connect to Fourth McDougal Lake and Middle McDougal Lake.  The Stony River then flows out the west side of the lake.  There is a concrete dam located on the lake outlet; the dam is on private property and there is no portage trail.  The lake bed in the shallow areas of North McDougal Lake is dominated by rubble, gravel, and sand with some boulder, muck, and detritus also present.  Aquatic plants grew to a maximum depth of 7 feet and a total of 25 types of aquatic and riparian plants were observed.   <br> \n <br> \nWalleye is the primary management species on North McDougal Lake.  The population is maintained through natural reproduction.  Walleye catch in the 2016 survey was near average relative to similar lakes.  The average length of Walleye sampled was 12.2 inches, average weight was 1.3 pounds, with fish up to 27.3 inches long sampled.  A total of nine year classes not including young of the year were sampled with the 2013 year class making up 26 percent of the catch and the oldest fish being age-12.  Overall, growth was average relative to other area lakes.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike is a secondary managed species.  Gillnet catch was near average relative to similar lakes.  The average length of Northern Pike sampled in gillnets was 19.0 inches with the largest fish having a total length of 45.1 inches; only three percent of the catch was longer than 30 inches.  The average weight of Northern Pike sampled in gillnets was 1.8 pounds which is average compared to similar lakes.  A total of nine year classes were sampled with the 2012 year class making up 30 percent of the catch.  Growth was below average when compared to other area lakes.   <br> \n <br> \nBluegill is the other secondary managed species on North McDougal Lake.  Bluegill catch was well above average when compared to similar lakes.  The average length of Bluegill was 8.0 inches with the longest fish having a total length of 10.8 inches; 66 percent of the catch was at least eight inches long.  The average weight of Bluegill was 0.5 pounds, also well above average when compared to similar lakes.  Six year classes of Bluegill were sampled with the 2012 year class making up 51 percent of the catch, the oldest fish were age-6.  Bluegill growth was above average relative to other area lakes.   <br> \n <br> \nSmallmouth Bass were sampled in small numbers.  A total of eleven Smallmouth Bass were sampled in 2016.  The largest of these fish was 18.9 inches long.  Five of these fish were young of the year.  Five year classes were represented in the sample with the 2012 year class making up 33 percent of the catch.  Growth is fast relative to other area lakes. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch catch was average relative to similar lakes.  The average length of Yellow Perch sampled in was 6.9 inches with fish up to 10.8 inches long sampled.  The average weight of Yellow Perch sampled in gillnets was 0.2 pounds.  Seven year classes of Yellow Perch were sampled with the 2014 year class making up 28 percent of the catch.  Growth was average relative to other area lakes.   <br> \n <br> \nIn addition to these gamefish species, White Sucker were sampled in numbers average relative to similar lakes and one Rock Bass was sampled.  Johnny Darter, Golden Shiner, Pumpkinseed, Spottail Shiner, Tadpole Madtom, and Trout Perch were also sampled in quarter inch mesh trap nets. <br> \n <br> \nNorth McDougal Lake offers good access and a diverse fishery.  The fisheries for Walleye and Bluegill should be good for the foreseeable future, but there are also options for catching Northern Pike, Smallmouth Bass, and Yellow Perch.  The connections to Fourth McDougal, Middle McDougal, and South McDougal mean that anglers have plenty of area to fish within reach of the access on North McDougal Lake. <br> \n</p>",
