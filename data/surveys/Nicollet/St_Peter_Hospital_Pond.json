OF ADULT CRAPPIE/BLG ANNUALLY.  A GOOD PANFISH POPULATION WAS SAMPLED, AND STOCKING IN 1992 WAS OMITTED.  BLC AVERAGED 49.50/TRAP NET AND BLC HAD A MEDIAN LENGTH OF 7.0 INCHES.  BLC WERE WELL REPRESENTED BY AGES 2 AND 3, WITH SINGLE 5,6, AND 8 YEAR OLDS SAMPLED.  GROWTH FOR BLC IS AVERAGE. BLG AVERAGED 44.50/TRAP NET, WITH ALL BUT ONE OF THE FISH SAMPLED 4.5-6.9 INCHES.  GROWTH FOR BLG SLOWS AFTER AGE 2, AND BLGS SAMPLED WERE EQUALLY DISTRIBUTED AMONG AGES 2-5.  PMK SUNFISH AVERAGED 7.00/TRAP NET.  PMK WERE SMALL, WITH ALL BUT TWO < 6.00 INCHES.  PMK EXHIBIT SLOW GROW AFTER AGE 3 AND WERE REPRESENTED BY AGES 1 AND 3-5.  BLB WERE WELL REPRESENTED, AVERAGING 63.00/ TRAP NET, WITH ALL BUT ONE FISH SAMPLED 6.0-7.9 INCHES. ONE YEB WAS NETTED.  IT WOULD BE A GOOD IDEA TO SAMPLE THIS POND OVER THE NEXT 2 YEAR TO DETERMINE IF IT CAN SUSTAIN A QUALITY FISHERY.</p>",
