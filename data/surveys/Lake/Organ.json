Northern pike were collected in average numbers, compared to other lakes in this lake class, and the catch included fish up to 27.9 inches (5.0 pounds).  Mean size; however, was fairly small (1.5 pound) with most of the fish in the sample smaller than 19 inches.Yellow perch were sampled in relatively low numbers and their size was below average.  The largest yellow perch sampled was 8.1 inches; however, the average length was less than 7.0 inches and the perch were probably too small to interest most anglers.There is no developed access or campsites on Organ Lake.  A short, user developed, trail allows for small boats or canoes to be carried to the lake.  The lake is shallow and has many rocks that are a hazard to navigation.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>The fish population in Organ Lake is comprised of northern pike, yellow perch, and white sucker.  Northern pike were introduced into the lake in 1992 with 115 fish that averaged 1.4 pounds each.  Test nets in 1997 indicated these fish have been reproducing and establishing a self sustaining population.  Northern pike up to 3.9 pounds were sampled, however due to the young age of most of these fish the average size is fairly small averaging 18.3 inches (1.4 pounds).  Although northern pike abundance is about average for this type of lake it may be a few more years before anglers can expect to see many fish in the four to five pound range.     The 1997 survey indicated yellow perch numbers are just average, and probably too small to interest anglers.  Yellow perch averaged about 6.5 inches with the largest fish sampled being only 7.2 inches.     The access to Organ Lake is by gravel roads with the last mile quite rough and not suitable for low clearance vehicles.</p>",

There appeared to be little human activity on the access trail in 2013, with a dead balsam fir blocking a portion of the trail near the trailhead.  The lake is 41 acres having a maximum depth of seven feet in brown bog-stained water.  The Secchi disk was visible to three feet; there are many boulders at or near the lake surface that are boating hazards. <br> \n   <br> \nThe initial lake survey, in 1980, found only yellow perch and white sucker present in Organ Lake.  A population assessment, in 1988, sampled yellow perch, white sucker, creek chub and common shiner.  In 1992 adult northern pike were stocked into Organ Lake to provide an additional fishing opportunity for anglers on this little used lake.  Since the northern pike introduction in 1992 the yellow perch and white sucker catch has fallen significantly.  The 2013 yellow perch was the lowest recorded on Organ Lake, the average size of yellow perch was a little more than 7 inches. <br> \n <br> \nThe northern pike sample in 2013 was below average compared to lakes having similar characteristics.  The average length of northern pike in 2013 was 18.4 inches (1.3 pounds); the largest northern pike sampled was 24.5 inches.  Northern pike growth in Organ Lake was slower than average compared to other lakes in the Finland area, considering the poor forage base available to northern pike that slow growth was not surprising.  Organ Lake now has a self-sustaining population of northern pike; no northern pike have been stocked since the initial stocking in 1992. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Organ Lake is an approximately 40 acre lake with a maximum depth of seven feet located 15 miles northwest of Schroeder. The lake can be accessed by a mostly grown over 100 foot trail from US Forest Service Road 348 (Whitefish Lake Road) to the northeastern corner of the lake; parking is limited to wide areas of the road. The road is very rough beyond the Whitefish Lake rustic campground and a four wheel drive vehicle with good ground clearance is recommended. <br> \n <br> \nA survey was completed on Organ Lake during late June of 2022 to monitor the fish community and assess the current Northern Pike angling opportunities. The Northern Pike catch rate was the highest on record for Organ Lake, but was within the normal range relative to other similar lakes. The average length of Northern Pike was poor at just 18 inches and the largest pike sampled was only 22 inches long. Overall growth of pike was slow relative to other lakes in the area. Although the lake may not produce trophy pike, anglers that visit the lake should have good chances to catch smaller pike. Historically Yellow Perch were present in the lake, but none were sampled in the 2022 survey. <br> \n</p>",
