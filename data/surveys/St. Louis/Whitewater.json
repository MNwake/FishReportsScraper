                "narrative": "<p>Whitewater Lake is a 2,351-acre lake located one mile west of Hoyt Lakes. There is a public access with multiple boat ramps and ample parking space located within the city campground on Fisherman's Point. Whitewater Lake is up to 73 feet deep and has a mostly gravel bottom, with isolated areas of rock along the dikes and muck bottom with dense vegetation in some of the bays. The lake is relatively clear water with around 12 feet of visibility. Aside from the campground and several homes along part of the northeast shore, the entire shoreline of Whitewater Lake is undeveloped. <br> \n <br> \nWhitewater Lake was thermally stratified on August 21, 2023, with a surface temperature of 68 F, a bottom temperature of 46 F, and adequate oxygen warmwater fish species down to 18 feet where the water temperature was 62 F. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye were sampled at a rate of 6.3 fish/gill net, which was slightly below average for the lake. The walleye were 16.2 incles long on average and 74% of the fish were over 14.0 inches, providing ample opportunities for anglers hoping to harvest walleye. Walleye ages ranged from 1 to 21 and indicated consistent recruitment in this naturally reproducing population.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike were sampled at a rate of 7.2 fish/gill net, which was higher than average for Whitewater Lake. The pike were 19.6 inches long on average, which was slightly larger than the historical average for the lake. The largest pike sampled in 2023 was 41.7 inches long, which was the largest ever sampled from the lake. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill abundance was well above average in this survey, with catch rates of 12.4 fish/trap net and 14.9 fish/gill net. The overall average length of bluegill was 6.0 inches, and 29% of the catch was 7.0 inches or larger. The largest bluegill sampled was 9.5 inches in length, and bluegill ages ranged from 3 to 12. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie catch rates were close to the historical average for the lake, with catch rates of 0.7 fish/trap net and 1.6 fish/gill net. The average length of all sampled crappie was 8.4 inches, and the largest crappie sampled was 12.1 inches in length. Black crappie ages ranged from 3 to 7. <br> \n <br> \nAdditional species sampled in 2023 included burbot, brown bullhead, channel catfish, golden shiner, hybrid sunfish, largemouth bass, pumpkinseed, rock bass, shorthead redhorse, white sucker, yellow bullhead, and yellow perch. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Whitewater Lake is in Ecological Lake Class 7, which consists of 41 lakes in northeast Minnesota that are very large, have irregular shoreline shapes, and have very soft (unmineralized) water.  Whitewater Lake is deeper than many of the lakes in this lake class, and has clearer and harder (more mineralized) water.  Whitewater Lake ranks as mesotrophic according to Carlson's Trophic State Index.   <br> \n <br> \nWhitewater Lake was thermally stratified on 08/13/2007 with a surface temperature of 73 F and a bottom temperature of 42 F.  Adequate oxygen for fish (more than 2 ppm) was retained to a depth of 22 ft, where the temperature was 69 F.  Bottom substrates along the shoreline of Whitewater Lake are mostly gravel, rubble, and sand.  Aquatic plants grow to a depth of 8 ft and are found in a shoreline fringe around the lake with concentrations in shallow bays.  The most common plants are cattails, sedges, northern milfoil, and several species of pondweeds.  <br> \n <br> \nWhitewater Lake was impounded in 1955 for use as a water storage reservoir for the Erie Mining taconite operation to the north of adjacent Colby Lake.  Formerly known as Partridge Lake, this impoundment increased the size and depth of Whitewater Lake and subjected it to greater annual water level fluctuations.  The inlet/outlet control structure is now owned and controlled by Minnesota Power.  An overflow outlet to the St. Louis River on the southern dike is not used.  Water losses through the dike due to groundwater seepage are substantial.  Whitewater Lake receives sewage treatment effluent from Hoyt Lakes.  Various developments are being considered or under construction at the old Erie Mining (LTV) site: Polymet rare metals mining and concentrating, Mesabi Nugget steel production, Excelsior Energy coal-gasification electrical generation plant.  These developments all require water and may want to rely on the Whitewater Lake/Colby Lake water supply system developed for Erie Mining.  <br> \n <br> \nRiparian development on Whitewater Lake consists of the previously mentioned water control structures and a public access and campground with 70 campsites on a peninsula (Fisherman's Point) on the northeast shore of the lake.  Minnesota Power acquired the land around Whitewater Lake when it purchased the land from the defunct LTV taconite plant (formerly Erie taconite) in 2002.  It has developed about 20 lakeshore home lots on the Fisherman's Point peninsula, but transferred ownership of the campground and boat access to the City of Hoyt Lakes. <br> \n <br> \nTwelve fisheries lake surveys or fish population assessments have been conducted on Whitewater Lake.  The initial investigation, in 1950, was done before the impoundment of the lake in 1955.  For purposes of comparison, only data from the eleven investigations after impoundment (beginning with the 1967 investigation) will be used in the following discussion unless otherwise noted.  All eleven of these investigations used gillnets (2-12 nets) to sample fish populations.  Trapnets (4-14 nets) were used during seven of these investigations.  Shoreline seining was done in seven years during the period 1950 through 2002. <br> \n <br> \nTrapnets were not used during the 2007 investigation due to workload considerations and because the fish species of interest (walleye, perch, northern pike) are best sampled by gillnets. <br> \n <br> \nThe total catch of fish in the gillnets in 2007 (all species combined) of 54 fish/net (42 lb/net) was in the fourth quartile for this lake class and was higher than the median catch of 33 fish/net (26 lb/net) in all investigations on this lake.  More fish of all species (except white sucker) were caught in 2007 than is typical for this lake.  As in previous investigations, however, the gillnet catch in 2007 was dominated by walleye, northern pike, and yellow perch. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye were not present in Whitewater Lake during the initial investigation in 1950 and were stocked periodically after the 1955 impoundment, from 1956 through 1984.  Walleye numbers in 2007 (12.0/gillnet) were in the fourth quartile for this lake class and were higher than the median catch of 8.3/gillnet in all investigations on this lake.  Walleye sizes in 2007 averaged 15.0\" (1.6 lb), which was in the fourth quartile for this lake class and was larger than the average size of 13.1\" in all investigations on this lake.  The largest walleye in 2007 was 27.8\".  Recent walleye year-classes were very evenly distributed.  Walleye growth was slower than normal by area standards. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike numbers in 2007 (5.3/gillnet) were in the fourth quartile for this lake class and were higher than the median catch of 3.9/gillnet in all investigations on this lake.  Pike sizes in 2007 averaged 21.9\" (2.8 lb) which was near the median for this lake class and was larger than the average size of 18.4\" in all investigations on this lake.  The largest pike caught in 2007 was 33.0\".  Most pike captured in 2007 were ages 2-4.  Pike growth was normal by area standards.   <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch numbers in 2007 (17.8/gillnet) were in the fourth quartile for this lake class and were higher than the median catch of 13.8/gillnet in all investigations on this lake.  Perch sizes in 2007 averaged 7.4\" (0.19 lb) which was near the median for this lake class and was similar to the average size of 7.6\" in all investigations on this lake.  The largest perch in 2007 was 10.5\".  Recent perch year-classes were very evenly distributed.  Perch growth was normal by area standards. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie and bluegill sunfish catches were higher in 2007 than in most previous investigations on this lake, although trapnets (not gillnets) are the primary sampling gear for these species.  Bluegill numbers have increased in many area lakes in recent years, perhaps due to longer and warmer summers. Largemouth bass are probably more abundant in Whitewater Lake than indicated by the gillnet catch.  Bass are \"net-shy\" and are difficult to catch with standard sampling nets.   <br> \n <br> \nMany of the game fish examined in 2007 were infected with neascus.  Some of the yellow perch were also infected with yellow grub.   Neascus (black spot) and yellow grub are common parasites that are native to the area.  They cannot infect humans, are often removed by filleting fish, and are killed at temperatures used to cook fish. <br> \n <br> \nMany native crayfish (26/gillnet) were captured in 2007. </p>",

Formerly known as Partridge Lake, it was impounded in 1955 for use as a water storage reservoir for a nearby mining company. There are three boat ramps located at Fisherman's Point Campground for public access. Most of the shoreline is undeveloped and cattail beds are common, particularly on the E and SE shores. \n\nThirteen species of fish were sampled during the 2016 survey. Walleye, northern pike and largemouth bass were common. The panfish community is dominated by abundant bluegill and rock bass are common. Two large channel catfish were sampled representing the third occurrence of this species in the sampling gear.\n\nWalleye numbers in 2016 (5.9/gill net) were below the long term average (8.3/gill net) for all assessments on this lake. The average walleye sampled was 16.1 inches long and about 5 to 6 years old. Wallleye were sampled from 14 different year classes including one that was 22 years old. The largest walleye sampled was 28.2 inches long.\n\nNorthern pike abundance in 2016 (9.0/gill net) was above the long term average (3.9/gill net) for all surveys on this lake. The average pike sampled was 19.7 inches long which is larger than the historic average length (18.6 inches). The largest pike sampled was 28.2 inches long.\n\nLargemouth bass in 2016 appear to be increasing in abundance and were sampled with both gear types in above average numbers. The average largemouth sampled in the gill nets was 12.1 inches long and about 5 years old. The longest largemouth sampled was 16.6 inches.\n\nBluegill numbers in 2016 (30.5/trap net) were much higher than the long term average (6.2/trap net) on this lake. The average bluegill was 5.4 inches long and about 6 years old. Only 4 percent of the bluegill sampled were 8 inches or larger and the largest bluegill  was 9.2 inches long.\n\n</p>",

Yellow bullheads are present, but they have been variously identified as yellow brown, and black bullheads over the years. They have white barbells. Channel catfish have not been captured in test nets since 1968, and largemouth bass not since 1950 (before impoundment). Walleye are somewhat small (mean length in gillnet catch=12.2 at annulus IV). Walleye recruitment appears sufficient to maintain the walleye population, and the present population is dominated by strong II and IV year classes.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Whitewater Lake is in Ecological Lake Class 7, which consists of 41 lakes in northeast Minnesota that are very large, have irregular shoreline shapes, and have very soft (unmineralized) water.  Whitewater Lake is typical of these lakes, except that it is deeper, has clearer water, and has harder (more mineralized) water.  Whitewater Lake stratifies thermally in midsummer and has poor oxygen (less than 2 ppm) below 25 ft in most summers, although in 1997 it retained 2 ppm oxygen to a depth of 50 ft (where the temperature was 48 F).  The outlet to the St Louis River has a dam which limits fish movement.  The lake bottom along the shoreline is mostly gravel and silt.  Aquatic plants grow to a depth of 8 ft; cattails, arrowhead, and various pondweeds are the most common plants.The total catch of fish (all species combined) in the gillnets in 1997 of 33 fish/net (23 lb/net) was normal for this lake class and was similar to the average catch of 35 fish/net (26 lb/net) for eight previous gillnettings on this lake dating back to 1967.  Lake Class 7 is one of the more productive lake classes in northeast Minnesota, in terms of fish numbers and biomass in gillnet catches.The total catch of fish in the trapnets in 1997 of 26 fish/net was higher than the average catch of 17 fish/net in five previous trapnettings on this lake dating back to 1968.  The total catch by weight of 11 lb/net was lower than the average catch of 20 lb/net in previous trapnettings.  More and smaller bluegill and perch were caught in 1997 than in most previous trapnettings.  The cold summers of 1992 and 1993 were poor years for fish reproduction, and many of the fish caught in the 1997 assessment were ages two and three which were produced in 1994 and 1995.Fish populations in 1997 were dominated by walleye, northern pike, and yellow perch.Walleye numbers in 1997 (8/gillnet) were normal for this lake class and were similar to the average catch of 7/gillnet in previous nettings in this lake.  Walleye sizes in 1997 averaged 13\"; the largest was 26.4\".  About half of the walleye were three years old, from a very strong 1994 year class.  Growth of young walleye (10\" at age three) was slower than normal for the area, but growth of older walleye (15\" at age five) was normal.Northern pike numbers in 1997 (4/gillnet) were higher than normal for this lake class and were identical to the average catch of 4/gillnet in previous nettings.  Pike sizes in 1997 averaged 20\"; the largest was 25.8\".  Most pike captured in 1997 were ages two and three.  Pike growth (20\" at age four) was normal for the area.Yellow perch numbers in 1997 (13/gillnet) were higher than normal for this lake class and were similar to the average catch of 15/gillnet in previous nettings.  Perch sizes in 1997 averaged 7\"; the largest was 12.6\".  Most perch captured in 1997 were ages two and three.  Growth of young perch (5\" at age two) was normal for the area.  Older perch scales were difficult to read and the growth calculation may be unreliable.Bluegill numbers in 1997 (6/trapnet) were normal for this lake class and were higher than the average catch of 4/trapnet in previous nettings.  Bluegill sizes in 1997 averaged 5\"; the largest was 8.9\".  Most bluegill captured in 1997 were ages two and three.  Few older bluegill were present.  Bluegill growth (5\" at age three) was faster than normal for the area.Low numbers of channel catfish were caught in a few previous nettings, but were not observed in 1997.  Low numbers of crappie were captured in 1997.Most of the gamefish examined in 1997 were fairly free of diseases or parasites, however about half of the northern pike had Neascus and 38 percent of the yellow perch had Neascus or yellow grub.  Neascus (black spot) and yellow grub are small parasites found in or just under the skin.  They cannot infect humans, are usually removed by filleting, and are killed by cooking.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Whitewater Lake is in Ecological Lake Class 7, which consists of 41 lakes in northeast Minnesota that are very large, have irregular shoreline shapes, and have very soft (unmineralized) water.  Whitewater lake is typical of these lakes except that it is deeper, and has clearer and harder (more mineralized) water.Whitewater Lake ranks as mesotrophic according to Carlson's Trophic State Index, with Secchi water clarity of 3.7 m and chlorophyll-a of 3.4 ppb.  Total phosphorus was at or below the laboratory detection limit of 20 ppb, which ranks as mesotrophic-to-eutrophic.Whitewater Lake was thermally stratified on 08/12/2002 with a surface temperature of 72 F and a bottom temperature of 48 F.  Adequate oxygen for fish (more than 2 ppm) was retained to a depth of 25 ft, where the temperature was 66 F.  Lake bottom substrates along the shoreline are mostly gravel, rubble, and sand.  Aquatic plants grow to a depth of 8 ft and are found in a shoreline fringe around the lake with concentrations in shallow bays.  The most common plants are cattails, sedges, northern milfoil, and several species of pondweeds. Whitewater Lake was impounded in 1955 for use as a water storage reservoir for the Erie Mining taconite operation.  Formerly known as Partridge Lake, this impoundment increased the size and depth of the lake and subjected it to greater annual water level fluctuations.  The inlet/outlet control structure is now owned and controlled by Minnesota Power.  An overflow outlet to the St. Louis River on the southern dike is not used.  Water losses due to groundwater seepage are substantial.  Whitewater Lake receives sewage treatment effluent from Hoyt Lakes.  A water management model and water use plan is currently being developed.Riparian development on Whitewater Lake consists of the water control structures and a public access and campground with 70 campsites on a peninsula (Fisherman's Point) on the northeast shore of the lake.  Minnesota Power acquired the land around Whitewater Lake when it purchased the land from the defunct LTV taconite plant (formerly Erie taconite) in 2002.  It plans to develop about 20 lakeshore home lots on the Fisherman's Point peninsula, but has agreed to transfer ownership of the campground and boat access to the City of Hoyt Lakes.Eleven fisheries lake surveys and fish population assessments have been conducted on Whitewater Lake.  The initial investigation, in 1950, was done before the impoundment of the lake in 1955.  For purposes of comparison, only data from the ten investigations after impoundment (beginning with the 1967 investigation) will be used in the following discussion unless otherwise noted.  All ten of these investigations used gillnets (2-12 net sets) to sample fish populations.  Trapnets (4-14 net sets) were used during seven of these investigations.  Shoreline seining was done in seven years during the period 1950 through 2002.The total catch of fish (all species combined) in the trapnets in 2002 of 15.2 fish/net (15.7 lb/net) was similar to the median catch of 18.3 fish/net (19.4 lb/net) in all investigations on this lake.  The trapnet catch in 2002 was dominated by northern pike.The total catch of fish in the gillnets in 2002 of 37.2 fish/net (26.9 lb/net) was near the median for this lake class and was similar to the median catch of 33.2 fish/net (25.0 lb/net) in all investigations on this lake.  The gillnet catch in 2002 was dominated by walleye, northern pike, and yellow perch.Walleye were not present in Whitewater Lake during the initial investigation in 1950 and were stocked periodically after the 1955 impoundment, from 1956 through 1984.  Walleye numbers in 2002 (9.7/gillnet) were in the third quartile for this lake class and were higher than the median catch of 7.9/gillnet in all investigations on this lake.  Walleye sizes in 2002 averaged 13.5\" (1.15 lb), which was in the third quartile for this lake class and was similar to the average size of 13.0\" in all investigations on this lake.  The largest walleye in 2002 was 23.3\".   Recent walleye year classes were very evenly distributed except for a weak 2000 year class.  Growth of walleye captured in 2002 was slower than normal by area standards.Northern pike numbers in 2002 (3.9/gillnet) were in the fourth quartile for this lake class and were at the median catch of 3.9/gillnet in all investigations on this lake.  The trapnet catch of northern pike in 2002 of 4.3/net was higher than the median catch of 2.4/trapnet in all investigations on this lake.  Pike sizes in the gillnets in 2002 averaged 19.7\" (1.9 lb) which was in the first quartile for this lake class, but was larger than the average size of 18.1\" in all investigations on this lake.  The largest pike in 2002, caught in a trapnet, was 41.5\".  Pike scales were difficult to read, but pike growth appeared to be somewhat slower than normal by area standards.Yellow perch numbers in 2002 (13.7/gillnet) were in the fourth quartile for this lake class and were at the median catch of 13.7/gillnet in all investigations on this lake.  Perch sizes in 2002 averaged 6.7\" (0.15 lb) which was in the second quartile for this lake class and was smaller than the average size of 7.6\" in all investigations on this lake.  The largest perch in 2002 was 11.2\".  Perch scales were difficult to read, but perch growth appeared to be normal by area standards.A few of the game fish examined in 2002 were infected with neascus.  Some of the yellow perch were infected with yellow grub.  Neascus (black spot) and yellow grub are common parasites of fish that are native to the area.  They cannot infect humans, are often removed by filleting, and are killed at temperatures used to cook fish.  </p>",

Public access is located at the municipal campground on the east side of the lake. <br> \n <br> \nWhitewater Lake was impounded in 1955 for use as a water storage reservoir for the Erie Mining taconite operation to the north of adjacent Colby Lake. Formerly known as Partridge Lake, this impoundment increased the size and depth of Whitewater Lake and subjected it to greater annual water level fluctuations. The inlet/outlet control structure is controlled by Minnesota Power. Water losses through the dike due to groundwater seepage are substantial. Whitewater Lake receives sewage treatment effluent from Hoyt Lakes.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye numbers in 2012 (8.4/gill net) were identical to the long term average for all assessments on this lake. The average walleye sampled was 15.2 inches long and about six years old. The growth rate was slower than average compared to other lakes in this class. The largest walleye sampled was 26.2\". Walleye were not present in 1950 before the impoundment was created but were stocked periodically 1956 through 1984. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike numbers in 2012 (6.3/gill net) were higher than the long term average for all assessments on this lake. The average pike sampled was 19.8 inches long and about four years old. The growth rate was slower than average compared to other lakes in this class. The largest pike sampled was 33.4\". <br> \n <br> \nBluegill numbers in 2012 (21.5/trap net) were higher than the long term average for all assessments on this lake. The average bluegill sampled was 5.9 inches long and about six years old. The growth rate was slower than average compared to other lakes in this class. The largest bluegill sampled was 8.9\". <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie (1.5/trap net), largemouth bass and yellow perch (4.8/gill net) were also sampled. One channel catfish was sampled. Channel catfish were previously sampled in 1968.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Whitewater Lake is a 1,212 acre lake located one mile west of Hoyt Lakes.  There is one access but it contains two ramps, one on each side of Fisherman's Point.  A large joint parking area is accessible regardless of which ramp is used.  The lake has a maximum depth of 73 feet and clear water. <br> \n <br> \nWhitewater Lake, previously known as Partridge Lake, became an impoundment in 1955 when dikes were created on the south and west sides which raised the water level around 30 feet.  The purpose for raising the water levels was to maintain higher water levels in connected Colby Lake, which Erie Mining and later LTV steel drew from for taconite mining operations.  This impoundment tripled the original surface area of Partridge and the lake was renamed Whitewater.  Even though it is over 60 years old, Whitewater Lake is a young reservoir and still in transition as it ages.  Often newly created reservoirs have boom populations of fish that through time will settle to more typical levels of production for the given lake's size and physical characteristics.  Whitewater is likely going through a transformation in its fish community that reflects some of the lake's physical changes.    <br> \n <br> \nWhitewater was thermally stratified on August 26, 2019 with a surface temperature of 68 F and a bottom temperature of 46 F.  Oxygen levels were adequate for gamefish to a depth of 23.0 feet where the temperature was 64 F.  There is one inlet, a small drainage on the east side and one outlet, which is a seep of water out the south end under a manmade dike.  A gate on the north end owned and operated by Minnesota Power can be used to control water level both up and down, depending on the elevation of Colby Lake.  Lake bottom substrates along the shoreline are mostly gravel covered clay, with some rocky areas along the dikes and muck areas in the bays.  Several of the shallow bays (especially the eastern-most arm) contain thick submergent vegetation and have shorelines rimmed with cattails.  Aquatic vegetation grows to a depth of around 10.0 feet.  Except for part of the northeast shore, the lake is entirely undeveloped.  Fisherman's Point Campground is a city run municipal campground that exists on the long southwest running peninsula.  There are 93 campsites many of which have lake access.     <br> \n <br> \nThe gill nets sampled 65 walleye for a catch rate of 5.4 fish/net.  This catch rate was above average compared to other walleye lakes in the Tower area but below average compared to past surveys on Whitewater.  The lower walleye catch rate, coupled with increasing catch rates of pike, bass, and bluegill, may be an indication of the lake's changing ecology.  Lengths ranged from 7 to just over 29 inches with an average of nearly 15 inches which was good compared to past surveys.  The average weight was nearly 2 pounds which was better than other similar lakes in the state.  Growth rates however were somewhat slow requiring 5 years to approach 15 inches long.  Walleye reproduction was good with a wide range of age classes. Ages ranged from 1 to 20 years. <br> \n <br> \nEighty northern pike were sampled in gill nets for a catch rate of 6.7 fish/net which was above average for Whitewater and considerably higher than other similar lakes.  Lengths ranged from 10 to 31 inches with an average of 20 inches.  The average weight was nearly 2 pounds which was on the small side compared to other similar lakes.   <br> \n <br> \nElectrofishing was used for the first time on Whitewater Lake for largemouth bass sampling.  One-hundred seventy-three largemouth were captured in the 2.0 hours of electrofishing for a catch rate of 86.5 fish/hour.  This was very good compared to other recent largemouth bass electrofishing surveys in the area.  Lengths ranged from 7 to 19.5 inches with an average of nearly 13 inches.  Just over 65% of the catch was 12 inches or longer.  Growth rates were above average for the area taking on average 5 years to reach 12 inches long.  Shallow vegetated bays on the east side of the lake offer excellent largemouth habitat. <br> \n <br> \nTwo channel catfish were caught in gill nets and one was caught in a trap net.  Sizes ranged from 21 to nearly 26 inches long.  Colby and Whitewater are the only two lakes in the Tower area where channel cats are semi routinely caught.  The first catfish caught in Whitewater came in 1968 and there wasn't another sampled until 2012.  Channel cats have now been caught in the past three surveys on Whitewater. <br> \n <br> \nTwelve black crappie were sampled in trap nets for a catch rate of 1.0 fish/net which was low compared to other similar lakes but average compared to past surveys on Whitewater.  Fourteen additional crappie were also sampled in the gill nets for a catch rate of 1.2 fish/net which was better than average compared to other similar lakes.  Lengths of the combined catch ranged from 6 to 12 inches with an average of 9 inches, which was similar to past surveys on the lake.  Ages ranged from 2 to 9 with the strongest year class from 2015.  Growth rates were average for the area taking on average 5 years to approach 9 inches.     <br> \n <br> \nThe bluegill trapnet catch was 33.3 fish/net which was very high compared to other similar lakes and the record high for Whitewater.  Sizes from the trap nets ranged from 3.5 to just over 8 inches with an average of just over 6 inches.  Ages ranged from 3 to 14 years with strong representation from the 2012 year class.  Growth rates however, were slow with the average bluegill taking 6 years to get over 5 inches.  The shallow and vegetated habitat that the largemouth prefer is also used by the expanding bluegill population.  These two species often thrive well together in lakes with suitable habitat.       <br> \n <br> \nThe yellow perch gillnet catch rate was 2.4 fish/net which was the lowest on record for the lake and below average compared to other similar lakes.  Lengths were similar to past surveys with a range from 6 to 11 inches and an average of nearly 7 inches.  Perch are an important forage fish for walleye and this lower abundance may be influencing current walleye abundance. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled in low numbers (both this survey and historically) were brown bullhead, pumpkinseed, rock bass, shorthead redhorse, white sucker, and yellow bullhead. <br> \n <br> \nRusty crayfish (an invasive species) were first observed in the 2012 investigation when four were caught in gill nets.  Their population has not expanded much as 14 were sampled in the 2016 survey and 13 were captured in this 2019 survey.   <br> \n <br> \nSome of the northern pike and bluegill had light to moderate neascus (black spot) infestations. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",
