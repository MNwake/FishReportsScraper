AGES II THROUGH V WERE REPRESENTED IN THE CATCH WITH THE MAJORITY (82%) BEING AGES II AND III.  GROWTH FOR ALL AGES WAS NORMAL WHEN COMPARED TO STATEWIDE MEANS.  ONE LMB YEARLING WAS CAPTURED IN THE TRAP NETS IN 1991.  THESE LOW CATCH RATES WERE ALSO SEEN IN 1986 WHEN 2 BASS WERE CAUGHT.  SEVERAL YOY AND YEARLING LMB WERE OBSERVED IN THE SHALLOWS BUT WERE NOT SAMPLED IN THE NATURAL REPRODUCTION CHECKS.  IT APPEARS AN AVERAGE POPULATION EXISTS.  BLG CATCHES (41.75/ TRAPNET SET) WERE HIGH FOR THIS LAKE CLASS AND SIMILAR TO CATCHES OBSERVED IN 1986 (39.5/SET). SIZE OF BLGS WAS AVERAGE WHEN COMPARED TO OTHER LAKES IN THIS CLASS.  THIRTEEN PERCENT OF THE BLGS SAMPLED WERE 7 INCHES OR GREATER.  BLC CATCHES DECLINED FROM 4.5/TRAPNET IN 1986 TO 1.25/TRAPNET IN 1991.  DESPITE THIS DECLINE, 1991 CATCH RATES WERE AVERAGE FOR THIS LAKE CLASS.  SIZE OF BLC FROM COMBINED GILL AND TRAPNET CATCHES RANGED FROM 4.5 TO 10.9 INCHES WITH THE MAJORITY IN THE 6.0 TO 8.0 INCH CLASS.  BOF, BLB, YEB, GSF, AND PMK TRAPNET CATCHES WERE AVERAGE FOR THIS LAKE CLASS.  BOF AND YEB WERE LARGE IN SIZE WHEN COMPARED TO STATE MEANS WHILE BLC WERE AVERAGE AND GSF AND PMK SMALL IN SIZE.  YEP NUMBERS AND SIZE WERE SMALL WHEN COMPARED TO STATEWIDE MEANS.  CAP WERE WELL REPRESENTED IN THE GILLNET CATCH (6.5/ LIFT).</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>     A special assessment targeting Black Crappie and Bluegill was conducted on Fuller Lake in early June to evaluate those populations as panfish provide an important fishery in the area.  Due to Fuller Lake's small size and priority ranking, spring trap nets are used to evaluate the fisheries.   <br> \n       A total of 27 Black Crappie (3.4/trap net) were caught during the assessment.  The fish ranged from 3.9 to 12 inches in length with a mean length of 8.2 inches.  The population size structure displayed some desirable characteristics as 48% (n=13) of the sample exceeded 9 inches in length and 33% (n=9) of the fish were more than 10 inches.   Age groups 2-7 were represented in the 2015 trap nets indicating consistent recruitment.  Growth rates of all year classes were in the normal range for the work area. <br> \n       Bluegill were the most abundant species netted in the 2015 spring panfish trap net assessment.  A total of 189 fish (23.6/TN) were sampled that ranged from 4.2 to 10 inches in length with a mean length of 7.1 inches for the sample.  Modal length was 7.5 \u0013 8 inches with 64% (n=122) of the fish exceeding seven inches, 12% (n=23) more than eight inches, and 3% (n=5) over nine inches in length.   Age groups 3-11 were represented suggesting consistent reproductive success.  Bluegills exhibited fast growth when compared to work area averages.  <br> \n        Gamefish measured in the 2015 panfish assessment included ten Northern Pike between twelve and twenty-six inches in length and three Largemouth Bass, one eight inches and the two about fourteen inches in length.  Other fish species netted included Bowfin, Brown Bullhead, Common Carp, hybrid sunfish, and Yellow Bullhead. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>       A special assessment targeting black crappie and bluegill was conducted on Fuller Lake in early June to evaluate those populations as panfish provide an important fishery in the area.  Standard summer lake surveys typically do not sample many of the larger panfish that may be present in a lake.   Four lake survey trapnets were set and lifted twice for eight net lifts.  Some black crappie and bluegill nest sites were visible near a few of the net locations.  Gamefish were also measured while other fish species were only identified and counted. <br> \n       A total of 27 black crappie ( 3.4/trapnet) were caught during the assessment.  The fish ranged from 3.9 to 12 inches in length with a mean length of 8.2 inches and modal length of 9 - 9.5 inches.  The population size structure displayed some desirable characteristics as 48% (n=13) of the sample exceeded 9 inches in length and 33% (n=9) of the fish were more than 10 inches.  Ages 2 thru 7 were represented in the 2009 aged sample.  All of the age groups displayed normal growth rates when compared to an area mean back-calculated length table.  Year class strengths suggest low but steady recruitment.  <br> \n       Variability in spring trapnet catches for crappie is common in area lakes.  A similar panfish assessment in 2003 caught a larger sample of crappie, 126 fish ( 15.8/trapnet), which  measured from 4.6 - 12.5 inches in length.  The mean length was similar to that from 2009, 8.3 inches, but modal length was shorter, 8.5 - 9 inches.  There did not appear to be as many fish of a desirable size to anglers in the population as only 7% (n=18) of the crappie in the sample exceeded 9 inches in length and 6% (n=7) were more than 10 inches.   Although the proportion of larger crappie was much better in the 2009 assessment, the number of quality crappie caught was about the same in both spring assessments. <br> \n       Bluegill were the most abundant species netted in the 2009 spring assessment.  There were 175 bluegill (21.9/trapnet) caught between 4.4 and 9.1 inches in length with a mean length of 6.9 inches and modal length of 6.5 - 7 inches.   Fish over 7 inches in length comprised a significant portion of the catch (47%; n = 82) with 11% (n=19) more than 8 inches and 1% (n=2) exceeding 9 inches.  Ages 3 thru 8 were represented in the aged sample with all of the age groups exhibiting fast growth rates.  Year class strengths suggest low exploitation as most of the fish appear to be over 5 years of age.   <br> \n       The 2003 spring assessment captured 332 bluegill (41.5/trapnet) between 3.7 and 9.1 inches in length.  The mean length of 6.5 inches was slightly shorter than that in 2009, but there was a longer modal length group, 7 - 7.5 inches.  The proportion of larger fish in the sample was less in 2003, 37% (n=123) were more than 7 inches in length. Seven percent of the catch (n=22) exceeded 8 inches with 0.8% (n=1) over 9 inches in length.   Although larger bluegill made up a bigger proportion of the 2009 catch, there were more quality bluegill in the 2003 assessment. <br> \n       Gamefish measured in the 2009 panfish assessment included six northern pike between 11 and 18 inches in length and two largemouth bass about 15 inches in length.  Other fish species netted included bowfin, brown bullhead, common carp, hybrid sunfish, and yellow bullhead. <br> \n       Spring trapnetting has proven to be an effective method for assessing the bluegill and crappie populations in Fuller Lake.   The last summer survey was in 2001 which caught some crappie up to almost 14 inches in the trapnets and bluegill up to 8 inches.  However, only 21% of the crappie exceeded 9 inches and only 7% of the bluegill were more than 7 inches in length.  Spring trapnets will continue to be used as a tool to evaluate the quality in the panfish populations. <br> \n       An area mean back-calculated length table was used to compare growth rates of the black crappie and bluegill.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Fuller Lake received a survey using four trap nets fished over two nights to specifically target Bluegill and Black Crappie in early June 2022. The last time a panfish-targeted survey was completed was in 2015. Standard survey trap netting typically involves net placement during the summer months at the same time gill nets are used. Because panfish occupy near-shore habitat during the spring, early-season netting targets panfish in the shallows and sample sizes increase, allowing better data interpretation. We captured a total of 165 Bluegills averaging 7.5 inches in length. There are good numbers (35 percent of the sample) of Bluegills over 8 inches, better than many lakes in the Little Falls Management Area. Maximum length measured was 9.1 inches. It takes about seven years for Bluegills to reach 8 inches in Fuller Lake.  <br> \n <br> \nFor crappies, we caught a total of 75; average size was 8.6 inches and maximum length was 12.7 inches. Sixteen percent of the sample measured 10 inches or greater. Crappie data from 2015 are variable by comparison - average length was 8.9 inches and maximum length was 11.3 inches. It takes about seven years for crappies in Fuller Lake to reach 10 inches. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled during this targeted survey include 13 Bigmouth Buffalo (15-inch mean length), Largemouth Bass, Northern Pike, Brown Bullhead, Yellow Bullhead, Pumpkinseed and White Sucker. Bluegill, Black Crappie and Bigmouth Buffalo comprised over 95 percent of the total catch.  <br> \n <br> \nAnglers and canoeists or kayakers can enjoy quietness in a natural setting on Fuller Lake because it's small in size and not affected too much by strong winds. A short, upstream navigation from Todd County Road 98 is required. The shoreline has very little residential development, water clarity is very good and there is an abundance of submerged, floating-leaf and emergent vegetation.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Fuller Lake is a small, relatively undeveloped lake in Todd County.  The lake has good water quality with much of its watershed being in the Grey Eagle State Wildlife Management Area.  Access to the lake is usually gained from County Road 98 right-of-way and traveling up the broad connection between the lake and Prairie Brook.  Low water levels can impede travel to the lake.  Fish populations in Fuller Lake are likely influenced by migrations from and to Prairie Brook which flows through Hennessy Lake down to Little Birch Lake.      The northern pike numbers in Fuller Lake were high and the population dominated by fish between 18 and 21 inches in length.  An occassional larger pike can be found, however.  The lake is probably better known for its panfish populations.  Black crappies were abundant with an average size of 8 inches seen in the survey, however fish up to 14 inches were observed.  Bluegill numbers were within the normal range for this type of lake and the fish fast growing.  Nice size bluegills, 6 - 7 inches, were common in the survey.  With the good growth rates and high number of fish just under 7 inches, suspect lots of fish to grow into the 7 inch range soon.  The lake also supports a largemouth bass population that has the potential to produce some trophy size fish.  Channel catfish were sampled for the first time in the lake and likely came from Little Birch Lake via Prairie Brooks.  Other riverine fish species in Fuller include shorthead redhorse and carp.  Bowfin, brown bullhead, hybrid sunfish, white suckers, and yellow bullheads are also present in the lake.  All the bullheads seen in the survey were over 12 inches in length.    Fuller Lake's small size (54 acres) makes it vulnerable to overharvest of several species including bluegill, crappie, largemouth bass, and larger northern pike (over 24 inches).  Increased residential development along the lake's shoreline has the potential to degrade important habitat and effect water quality if proper land use practices are not employed.</p>",

A special assessment was conducted in  <br> \nmid-June targetting panfish to gather additional population size  <br> \nstructure data.  Standard lake surveys typically do not sample  <br> \nmany of the larger panfish that may be present in a lake.  Four  <br> \nlake survey trapnets were set and lifted twice for a total of 8  <br> \nlifts.  The crappies, bluegills, and gamefish were measured and  <br> \nscales taken from the panfish for age and growth data.  All other  <br> \nfish species were identified and counted. <br> \n    The spring assessment captured 126 black crappies ranging  <br> \nfrom 5 to 13 inches in length.  Modal length for the sample was  <br> \n8.5 - 9 inches with 14% (n=18) of the fish exceeding 9 inches.   <br> \nThe last lake survey was conducted in mid-July of 2001.  The  <br> \ntrapnets caught 38 crappies that measured from 5 to 14 inches  <br> \nlong.  The modal length for the sample was 5.5 - 6 inches while  <br> \nfish more than 9 inches in length accounted for 21% (n=8) of the  <br> \ncatch.  Ages 2 thru 7 were represented in the 2003 assessment  <br> \nwith 1999 year class accounting for 71% of the catch.  All of the  <br> \nage groups displayed normal growth rates. <br> \n    Bluegills made up the majority of the fish catch in the 2003  <br> \nspring assessment.  A total of 331 bluegills were sampled that  <br> \nranged from 4 to 9 inches in length.  The catch displayed an  <br> \nimpressive modal length of 7 - 7.5 inches with 37% (n=123) of the  <br> \nfish exceeding 7 inches in length.  The 2001 summer survey  <br> \nsampled only 73 bluegills between 4 and 8 inches.  The sample  <br> \nexhibited a slightly smaller modal length of 6 - 6.5 inches when  <br> \ncompared to the mid-June assessment and only 7% (n=5) of the fish  <br> \nwere more than 7 inches in length.  Ages 2 thru 7 and 9 were  <br> \nrepresented in the 2003 spring netting.  Two year classes, 1999  <br> \nand 1998, comprised 43% and 32% of the sample, respectively.  All  <br> \nof the age groups displayed fast growth when compared to an area  <br> \nmean back-calculated length table. <br> \n    The 2003 spring assessment also captured 15 northern pike  <br> \nbetween 12 and 31 inches in length.  Small fish dominated the  <br> \ncatch as 47% (n=7) of the fish were between 16 and 18 inches.   <br> \nOther fish species netted included black bullheads, bowfin, brown  <br> \nbullheads, carp, hybrid sunfish, pumpkinseeds, white sucker,  <br> \nyellow bullheads, and yellow perch. <br> \n    Spring trapnetting proved to be an effective method for  <br> \nassessing the bluegill and crappie populations in Fuller Lake.   <br> \nThis method will continue to used as a tool to evaluate the  <br> \nquality in the panfish populations.</p>",
