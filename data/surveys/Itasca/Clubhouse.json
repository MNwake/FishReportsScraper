                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of the nearshore and littoral fish community in Clubhouse Lake was conducted by Fisheries Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program Staff from 18-20 July 2022. Ten sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 15-foot or 50-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at all 10 sites. A 50-foot seine was used to sample five sites with two of these being boat-aided seines, a 15-foot seine was used at three sites, and soft sediments with abundant vegetation and deep water prevented the use of seines at two sampling sites.  Nearshore sampling captured 26 native species of fish including ten species that are intolerant of disturbance (Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, Mimic Shiner, Mottled Sculpin, Northern Sunfish, Pugnose Shiner, Rock Bass, and Smallmouth Bass) and one species (Fathead Minnow) that is tolerant of disturbance. <br> \n <br> \nA concurrent summer trap net survey was conducted on 18-20 July 2022 by IBI Program Staff. Nine trap nets were set along the shoreline that encompassed multiple habitat types. Bluegill and Yellow Bullhead comprised a majority of the trap net catch by number and Yellow Bullhead and Bluegill comprised a majority of the catch by biomass. The number of Bluegill sampled per net was below the 25% quartile for similar Lake Class 23 lakes and the average length was 5.6 inches, with 23% over 7 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore and trap net data were combined with gill net data from a June 2021 survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based IBI (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment. In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g., Blackchin Shiner, Iowa Darter, and Rock Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g., Black Bullhead, Fathead Minnow, and Green Sunfish). The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.  <br> \n <br> \nResults from this survey indicates Clubhouse Lake is in good health as indicated by an exceptionally high FIBI score, well above the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes. Data from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Big Fork River Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Clubhouse Lake is assigned to lake class #23, according to selected physical and chemical parameters.  The parameters and mean values for lake class #23 are as follows:  area=285 acres, maximum depth=77.6 ft., 28% littoral area, total akalinity=121.8, and Secchi disc transparency=14.2 ft.  In general, lake basins in this class are small, deep, have a small littoral ratio, and contain hardwater with excellent clarity.  There are thirty-five lakes in this classification within the Grand Rapids fisheries management jurisdiction and many are considered to be pristine, oligotrophic lakes.Gill net and trap net catches (CPUE's) were evaluated using interquartile ranges developed for lake class #23.  Gill net catches of all species and trap net catches of all species, except yellow perch, were within this range, indicating normal abundance.  Yellow perch abundance is probably very low, as none were caught in gill nets and only one in trap nets.Northern pike appeared to be the dominant species in gill nets (8.0 per set) as they constituted 68% of the total biomass (mean weight per fish=1.73 lbs.).  The proportion of the gill net catch that exceeded 21 inches was 32%.  Therefore, it can generally be stated that one third of the northern pike may be of acceptable size for anglers to keep.  Net catches of northern pike consisted of age 2-5 fish.  Growth for each age class was within 10% of the statewide average.  Northern pike reach 21 inches in approximately four years.Bluegills were most prevalent in trap net catches (10.2 per net) and were relatively small-sized.  Only 21% of the trap net catch exceeded 6 inches, the arbitrary minimum size fish that anglers prefer to keep.  There were almost no bluegills over 8 inches in trap nets.  The trap net catch of bluegills consisted of all age classes while ages 4, 5, and 7 were most prevalent.  All age classes had growth rates below the statewide averages in the following proportions:  age 3-45% below, age 4-37% below, age 5-35% below, age 6-15% below, age 7-33% below, and age 8-18% below.  It requires about six or seven years for a bluegill in Clubhouse Lake to reach 6 inches.The black crappie sample was relatively small (only nine fish from trap net and gill net combined) but tends to indicate that they are medium-sized (7-9 inches).  This sample consisted of age 3 and 4 fish that appear to have average growth rates.  It appears that black crappies require about five years to reach a quality size of 8 inches.There are several species of nongame fish that may be important from a biological perspective.  There is a large proportion of the lake that provides a cool water refuge suitable for tullibee and large northern pike.  Tullibee were fairly common in net catches (2.8 per gill net) and most ranged in size from 7.0-11.0 inches.  These fish should provide ideal prey for larger pike.  Bowfin are fairly abundant and may provide another predator for bluegill population control.  Yellow bullheads were also commonly caught in gill nets and trap nets and provide an alternate species for the angler as they were large-sized.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Clubhouse Lake is a centrarchid lake that is located about 7 miles east of Marcell, MN. within the Chippewa National Forest.  The lake is located in lake class #23 and has 210 acres of which 32 acres are littoral.  It has a maximum depth of 103 feet and a secchi disc reading of 17 feet.     The northern pike population is characterized by high numbers (10.0/set) of small fish.  The mean weight of those sampled in the gill net was 1.8 pounds.  The northern pike in this assessment ranged in length from 11.0 to 29.1 inches and had a mean length of 20.3 inches.  Growth rates were below but within 15% of the statewide medians.     Typical of summer test netting, few largemouth bass were sampled in the past 5 assessments.  The exception was in 2004 when they were sampled at 1.1/trap net and in 1982 when 1.3/trap net were sampled.  The electrofishing portion of the 2004 summer assessment sampled largemouth at the rate of 68.3/hour.  The 91 largemouth ranged in length from 5.4 to 17.7 inches and had a mean length of 10.8 inches.  Likewise, only 5 smallmouth bass have been sampled in any of the 5 assessments.  Eight smallmouth were sampled at 6.0/hour in the electrofishing in this assessment. They ranged in length from 5.4 to 17.8 inches and had a mean length of 14.0 inches.  Growth rates were similar to the statewide averages.     Bluegill are abundant but small.  The trap net catch of 35.0/set was well above the median and the second highest observed.  The bluegill ranged in length from 3.4 to 8.3 inches and had a mean length of 5.9 inches.  Growth rates were within 15% of the lake class averages.               No black crappies were captured in the gill nets and only 16 (1.8/set) were sampled in the trap net.  The crappie sampled ranged in length from 6.5 to 10.3 inches and had a mean length of 7.8 inches.            Unusual for this type of lake, only one yellow perch has been sampled in the gill nets in any of the past assessments.  Only a few were sampled in the trap nets in this assessment (0.3/set).     Tullibee, an important forage species, have historically been sampled in the gill nets.  In this assessment, they were sampled at 4.2/gill net.  The size of the fish is generally small in Clubhouse Lake ranging from 7.5 to 10.6 inches with a mean length of 8.8 inches.      Other species sampled were bowfin, pumpkinseed sunfish, rock bass, white sucker and yellow bullhead. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Clubhouse Lake is located about six miles east of Marcell, MN, and within the Chippewa National Forest.  The 210 acre lake has 32 littoral acres, a maximum depth of 103 feet, and about 4.7 miles of shoreline.  The lake is split into two distinct basins with connectivity to Rice River and numerous other lakes within the drainage.  There is a popular National Forest Campground on the west shore where the public access is located.  The majority of the shoreline is in private ownership, yet development appears to be minimal.  Largemouth Bass and Bluegill are the primary management species, though the lake is likely known as a Northern Pike lake. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass were sampled at a rate of 60.0/hour in spring night electrofishing, similar to the 2005 catch rate of 68.3/hr.  Size structure was moderate with 44% of the sample exceeding 12 inches.  Lengths ranged from 5.9 to 18.7 inches with a mean length of 10.9 inches.  Scale analysis identified ages 1 to 10, indicating consistent recruitment.  Growth was typically slow, but similar to the statewide average from ages 4 to 6.  Largemouth Bass averaged 11.8 inches by age 5.  Smallmouth Bass were occasionally sampled in past assessments, however none were sampled in 2014.  One large smallmouth was observed during spring night electrofishing, but was not captured. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike were sampled at a rate of 6.2/gill net, similar to the lake class median (5.0/net).  The 2014 catch was down from the historically high catch of 10.0/net in 2004.  Most assessments sampled pike within the lake class expected range.  Size structure was poor with few fish being sampled over 28 inches.  Scale and bone analysis identified ages 1 to 7 with growth similar to the statewide average.  Age classes were relatively similar suggesting consistent recruitment.  Northern Pike averaged 24.7 inches by age 5. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill trap net catches have been variable but never exceeding the lake class third quartile.  Bluegill were sampled at a rate of 5.8/trap net, below the lake class first quartile and the previous assessment (35.0/net).  Size structure was moderate with some fish exceeding eight inches.  Lengths ranged from 3.4 to 9.2 inches with a mean length of 7.6 inches. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie have been observed in all assessments and were sampled at a rate of 0.2/gill net and 0.5/trap net, similar to, or below, the lake class first quartile.  Sample size was too small to accurately assess size structure, yet lengths from the five fish sampled in trap nets were 5.3 to 10.6 inches with a mean length of 7.7 inches.  Scale analysis of a combined sample identified ages 2 to 5 present, suggesting consistent recruitment.  Growth was slow early, but similar to the statewide average by age 2.  Black Crappie were almost nine inches by age 4. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch, an important prey species, were not sampled in this assessment.  When sampled in past assessments, the catches were very low.  Another important prey species, Tullibee, were sampled at a rate of 10.2/gill net, near the lake class third quartile.  Lengths were from 7.1 to 12.2 inches with a mean length of 9.2 inches.  Tullibee are likely a significant prey species, especially with the lack of Yellow Perch. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled include Bowfin, Hybrid Sunfish, Pumpkinseed Sunfish, Rock Bass, White Sucker, and Yellow Bullhead. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Clubhouse Lake is located about six miles east of Marcell, MN in the Chippewa National Forest and the Big Fork River watershed.  The lake is split into two distinct basins with connectivity to the Rice River and numerous other lakes within the drainage.  There is a national forest campground on the west shore where the public access is located.  The majority of shoreline is in private ownership, but development is fairly light. <br> \n <br> \nThe 2015 lake management plan (LMP) listed Largemouth and Smallmouth Bass as primary management species, with Northern Pike as a secondary management species.  The LMP goals were to maintain night electrofishing catch rates for Largemouth and Smallmouth Bass at 50/hour and 10/hour, and maintain the Northern Pike gill-net catch at 7/net.  A standard lake survey was conducted in June 2021 to assess the status of the fish community. <br> \n <br> \nSpring night electrofishing sampled Largemouth Bass at the rate of 74.4/hour of on-time, which exceeded the LMP goal.  Small fish under 8 inches made up the majority of the sample. Size structure was moderate; bass ranged from 3.3 to 17.3 inches with an average length of 9.3 inches.  Age analysis indicated frequent but variable recruitment.  Ages 1-10 were represented, with age 2 the most frequently sampled.  Growth was considered average.  Largemouth Bass averaged 10.9 inches after 4 years.  Clubhouse Lake provides good angling opportunities for Largemouth Bass. <br> \n <br> \nSmallmouth Bass have typically been sampled in low numbers in Clubhouse Lake, but with a good average size.   Night electrofishing in 2021 captured three Smallmouth Bass for a catch rate of 2.4/hour of on-time.  This did not meet the LMP goal.  One fish exceeded 20 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nThe gill-net catch rate for Northern Pike was average for the lake and near the LMP goal.  Size structure was moderate.  Sampled pike ranged from 14.0 to 34.2 inches with an average length of 22.9 inches.  Ages 2 through 8 were represented indicating frequent recruitment.  Growth was considered good; pike exceeded 25 inches after 5 years of growth. <br> \n <br> \nThe Bluegill population can generally be described as having moderate numbers and poor to fair size structure.  The trap-net catch rate was below average compared to lakes with similar habitat, but equal to the previous survey.  Sampled Bluegill ranged from 3.3 to 8.3 inches with an average length of 5.3 inches.  Bluegill were not aged in this survey, but previous assessments indicated slow growth.  <br> \n <br> \nThe gill-net catch rate for Tullibee was above average for the lake and similar lakes.  Tullibee ranged from 7.1 to 12.3 inches with an average length of 10.0 inches.  Tullibee are an important prey species for large predators like Northern Pike. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled included Black Crappie, Hybrid Sunfish, Pumpkinseed, Rock Bass, Yellow Bullhead and Yellow Perch. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of nearshore fish species in Clubhouse Lake was conducted on July 20th and 21st, 2021 by Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program Staff. Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at 10 sampling stations. Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample seven stations, a 15-foot seine was used at two stations, and site conditions prevented the use of seines at one station. Nearshore sampling captured 18 species of fish including six species that are intolerant of disturbance (Banded Killifish, Iowa Darter, Mimic Shiner, Northern Sunfish, Rock Bass, Smallmouth Bass) and none that are tolerant of disturbance. <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore data were combined with trap net and gill net data from a June 28, 2021 standard survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based IBI (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment. In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (Blackchin Shiner, Iowa Darter, and Rock Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (Black Bullhead, Common Carp, Fathead Minnow). The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.  <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey indicates Clubhouse Lake is in very good health as indicated by an FIBI score above the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes. Data from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Big Fork River Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.</p>",
