This shallow lake has shorelines that are covered with dense conifers growing near the water's edge. The rocky shoreline quickly changes to a muck bottom and aquatic plants are common. There are two designated  USFS campsites present and they appear to have little use. Manomin has a history of periodic partial winterkills which can affect the present fish community. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch numbers in 2015 (16.0/gill net) were identical to the long term average on this lake. The average perch sampled was 7.8 inches long and the largest perch was 10.2 inches. <br> \n <br> \nWhite sucker numbers in 2015 (13.0/gill net) were identical to the long term average on this lake. The average sucker sampled was 12.6 inches long and the largest sucker was 18.9 inches. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike were sampled in low numbers (0.7/gill net) and their lengths ranged from 15.9 to 18.4 inches long. <br> \n <br> \nOne golden shiner and one pumpkinseed were sampled. One 6.9 inch largemouth bass was also sampled. This is the first report of largemouth in this lake. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",
