The assessment consisted of 32 survey sites evenly spaced 150 meters around the lake. Assessments were made in three habitat zones: Shoreline Zone (the shore-water interface to the top of the natural bank), Shoreland Zone (land-ward from shoreline to development structure or 100 feet), and Aquatic Zone (lake-ward 50 feet of shoreline). The average lakewide habitat score was 73.1 (?3.2) out of 100 possible. Approximately 62 percent of the sites were developed with a mean score of 66.7 (?4.1), while undeveloped sites had a mean score of 83.6 (?3.7).</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Ox Yoke Lake is a 187-acre lake with 2.87 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 42 feet located north of Backus, MN. A Minnesota Department of Natural Resources owned public access is located on the south shore. The MNDNR has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different classes based on physical, chemical and other characteristics. Ox Yoke Lake is in Lake Class 31; lakes in this class are generally clear and productive with moderate depth. The lake is primarily managed for Largemouth Bass and Black Crappie and secondarily for Northern Pike, Bluegill, and Yellow Perch. A 10 Sunfish possession limit was implemented in 1996 to improve size structure. This regulation showed initial improvements which were not sustained over the long-term, and was converted to a 5 Sunfish daily limit (statewide possession limit still applies) in 2022. <br> \nOx Yoke Lake is a great multi-species lake. Black Crappie were above management goals and ranged in length from 4 to 11 inches long with an average length of 7 inches. Bluegill numbers in 2022 were the lowest recorded and did not meet management goals. Bluegill ranged in length from 3 to 8 inches with an average length of 5 inches. Largemouth Bass ranged in length from 6 to 17 inches with an average length and weight of 12 inches and 1.2 pounds. Northern Pike numbers exceeded management goals, and ranged in length from 9 to 34 inches with an average length and weight of 20 inches and 2.0 pounds. <br> \nOther species sampled were Brown Bullhead, Hybrid Sunfish, Pumpkinseed, Rock Bass, Yellow Bullhead, and Yellow Perch. <br> \nPeople can have significant impacts on lakes and the fish populations they support. Harvest, lakeshore development, removal of shoreline vegetation. Currently no aquatic invasive species (AIS) have been identified in Ox Yoke Lake however, Purple Loosestrife is found on the lake's shore. AIS are moved from infested to non-infested waters by anglers, boaters, and lake shore owners and can adversely impact lakes and fish populations. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access. If you suspect an infestation of an invasive species in this lake, save a specimen and report it to a local natural resource office. Additional information on all of these topics can be found on the DNR website (www.dnr.state.mn.us) or by contacting the Walker Area Fisheries office. <br> \n</p>",

THE PRESENT GILLNET CATCH OF 12.5 FALLS CONSIDERABLY OUTSIDE THIS HISTORICAL RANGE. THE 1986 AND 1987 YEAR CLASSES MADE UP A MAJORITY OF THE SAMPLE COLLECTED. 1986 AND 1987 WERE HIGH WATER YEARS. ALL OTHER YEAR CLASSES WERE PRESENT INDICATING CONSISTENT NATURAL REPRODUCTION. THE GROWTH RATE FOR NORTHERN PIKE IS NOT FAST. QUALITY NORTHERN PIKE WERE COLLECTED IN 1989 AS WELL AS DURING PREVIOUS ASSESSMENTS. YELLOW BULLHEAD NET CATCHES ARE FAIRLY HIGH. NO BLACK BULLHEAD WERE IDENTIFIED. THE HISTORICAL RANGE OF TRAPNET CATCHES FOR BLUE- GILL WAS 11 TO 100 PER TRAPNET. THE PRESENT CATCH OF 54/TN FALLS WITHIN THIS RANGE. THERE IS A DECREASE IN THE QUALITY OF THE 1989 SAMPLE COLLEC- TED COMPARED TO THE 1966 SAMPLE. THE GROWTH RATE FOR BLUEGILL IS SLOW. CONSIDERING THE TYPES OF SAMPLING GEAR USED, FAIR NUMBERS OF LARGEMOUTH BASS AND BLACK CRAPPIE WERE CAPTURED DURING THE 1989 ASSESSMENT AS WELL AS DURING EARLIER ASSESSMENTS. MOST ALL YEAR CLASSES OF BOTH SPECIES WERE REPRESENTED IN THE SAMPLE COLLECTED INDICATING CONSISTENT NATURAL REPRODUC- TION. THE GROWTH RATES FOR BOTH SPECIES ARE NEAR AVERAGE. NO YELLOW PERCH WERE CAPTURED IN THE GILLNET. PREVIOUS GILLNET CATCHES HAVE RANGED FROM 0 TO 1.7 PER GILLNET. THE TRAPNETS CAPTURED 6 YELLOW PERCH RANGING IN LENGTH FROM 5 TO 9 INCHES. ONLY 1.2 WALLEYE PER GILLNET WERE CAPTURED EVEN THOUGH 100 TO 5,350 WALLEYE FINGERLINGS HAVE BEEN STOCKED ANNUALLY SINCE 1984. SUBSTANTIAL WALLEYE FINGERLINGS STOCKING HAS NOT CREATED MUCH OF A WALLEYE FISHERY.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Ox Yoke Lake (DOW# 11-0355; Lake Class 31) is a 187-acre lake located near Backus, MN. There is a DNR owned public access on the south shore. Ox Yoke Lake has 2.87 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 42 feet. The lake is primarily managed for Largemouth Bass and Black Crappie and secondarily for Northern Pike, Bluegill, and Yellow Perch. The DNR has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different classes based on physical, chemical and other characteristics. Ox Yoke Lake is in Lake Class 31; lakes in this class are generally clear and productive with moderate depth. An experimental regulation consisting of a reduced possession limit (10) for Sunfish was instituted in 1996 and was converted to a special regulation in 2003. <br> \n <br> \nBass, Black Crappie, Bluegill, and Northern Pike are the primary sport fish. The majority of Largemouth Bass sampled were between 10 and 15 inches. Almost half of the Bluegill measured were between 6 and 8 inches. The Black Crappie population consists of a variety of sizes with fish up 12 inches present. Northern Pike are moderately abundant with fish up to 34 inches sampled. Other fish species that anglers may encounter include Brown Bullhead, Bowfin (Dogfish), Hybrid Sunfish, Pumpkinseed, Rock Bass, Walleye, Yellow Bullhead, and Yellow Perch. <br> \n <br> \nPeople can have significant impacts on lakes and the fish populations they support. Harvest, lakeshore development, removal of shoreline vegetation, and introductions of invasive species can all adversely affect fish populations. Currently no aquatic invasive species (AIS) have been identified in Ox Yoke Lake. AIS are moved from infested to non-infested waters by anglers, boaters, and lake shore owners and can adversely impact lakes and fish populations. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access. If you suspect an infestation of an invasive species in this lake, save a specimen and report it to a local natural resource office. Additional information on all of these topics can be found on the DNR website (www.dnr.state.mn.us) or by contacting the Walker Area Fisheries office. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>STATUS OF OX YOKE LAKE FISHERY FOR 1994.Ox Yoke lake (lake class 31) was resurveyed in 1994.  Sampling of fish was done using 6 gillnets, 9 trapnets, andshoreline seining. Largemouth bass and crappie were also sampled by night electrofishing.Ox Yoke lake is included in a study investigating regulations designed to increase the harvest of bluegillsgreater than 8 inches.  The three types of regulations being considered are:     1) Regulations that influence the bag limit of bluegill.     2) Regulations that influence the bag limit and/or size limit of large predators that feed on the bluegill.     3) Combined regulations using a combination of both 1 and 2.Pre-regulation data will be collected during 1994 and 1995.  If acceptable to the public, new regulations willbe implemented during 1996.   Monitoring will occur until the year 2001.  Data will then be evaluated and resultswill be used to manage bluegill in Minnesota lakes.1994 Creel Survey Preliminary findings of the 1994 creel survey estimated angler hours from May 14, 1994 (opening day) throughSeptember 5, 1994 (Labor Day) at 4776 hours for an overall pressure of 28.8 hours per acre.  The most sought afterfish species in Ox Yoke Lake was black crappie followed by bluegill. Crappie anglers had a catch rate of0.56/hour, while anglers who said they were fishing for bluegill had a catch rate of 1.41/hour.  Estimatednumbers of fish harvested included 1331 black crappie, 2181 bluegill, 340 largemouth bass, 142 northern pike, and 46 pumpkinseed. No walleye were kept byinterviewed anglers.1994 Fish SurveyThe bluegill sampled were slow growing and small in size.  Good natural reproduction of bluegill occurs in thislake.  The number of the fish captured were consistent with previous surveys, but lower than the previous survey. Bluegill over 8 inches were not sampled.Black crappie were sampled by night electrofishing in addition to nets.  During electrofishing fish of qualitylength range and average weight were sampled.  Trapnet numbers were lower in comparison to previous surveys.Many largemouth bass were sampled by night electrofishing and nets, both provided favorable numbers.  Many qualitysize fish have been sampled in all surveys of this lake.  Natural reproduction was consistent in this lake withfish present from many year classes.  Largemouth bass hatched in the spring of 1994 were captured in the shorelineseining.The northern pike size was small and growth was slow; however a few quality size fish were caught in the nets andanglers have reported catching large fish.  Sizes sampled have remained constant over all surveys.Walleye were large with the smallest fish sampled being 19 inches, indicating few younger fish were present. Stocking in this lake has been discontinued because of low angler success.  The low number of yellow perch in thislake may limit the ability for walleye to establish a viable population.   Many small yellow bullhead were captured.  Yellow perch are not abundant in this lake, but numbers were higherthan previous surveys.  Other species caught in low numbers were pumpkinseed sunfish, bowfin (dogfish), brownbullhead, and painted turtle.  Iowa darter and spottail shiner  were captured in the shoreline seining.Age and growth analysis determined the fish sampled grew slower compared to the previous survey.  This may have beencaused by relatively cold summers in 1992 and 1993.  Fish grow slower in Ox Yoke Lake compared to the growth ofsimilar lakes in the area.Ox Yoke Lake has a nice public access and is a good largemouth bass lake with large northern pike caught occasionally. Bluegill are abundant, but small.  Black crappie are of good size.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Ox Yoke Lake is located about 5 miles northeast of Backus in northern Cass County.  A Minnesota DNR public access is located      on the south end of the lake off of Ox Yoke Road.  Ox Yoke Lake has an area of 166 acres and a maximum depth of 42 feet.  About      40% of the lake is less than 15 feet deep.  The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MDNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different lake classes based on physical and chemical characteristics, and Ox Yoke is in lake class 31.  Lakes in this lake class are typically smaller and have moderate depths and water clarity.  Other nearby lakes in this same class include Child, Five Point, and Sanburn.  Ox Yoke anglers can have good success fishing for largemouth bass, black crappie, sunfish, and northern pike.  Ox Yoke Lake is managed primarily for largemouth bass and black crappie.  Three years of angler surveys on Ox Yoke Lake have found that fishing on this lake is typical of other lake class 31 lakes.  In 1996 an experimental regulation was initiated to increase the harvest of 8-inch and larger bluegill.  As of 1999, no significant change in bluegill size had been noted.  It is likely that the experimental regulation would need to be in place several more years before effects (if any) would be noticeable. Bluegill in Ox Yoke Lake grew more slowly than bluegill from most other lakes in this lake class.  A five-year-old bluegill in Ox Yoke Lake averaged 4.4 inches long, less than one inch of growth per year.  Bluegill abundance in Ox Yoke is similar to other lakes in this lake class.  Pumpkinseed sunfish are also available to anglers on Ox Yoke Lake.  Number of northern pike present in Ox Yoke was similar to other lakes in this class.  Though most of the northern pike were small, fish up to 33 inches were found in 1999.  The number of black crappie available in this lake compares favorably with other lakes of this type, and the 1999 lake assessment sampled fish up to 11 inches.Few walleye were collected during 1999, but those that were netted ranged from 16 to 23 inches.  A limited amount of walleye natural reproduction takes place in Ox Yoke Lake.  Walleye stocking was discontinued during the 1990's because it appeared that anglers were not catching walleye and no increase in abundance was noted in DNR netting assessments.  Numbers of yellow perch in Ox Yoke Lake were low compared to other lakes in this class.  In many lakes, yellow perch are a common food for walleye, northern pike and other predators.   Anglers can help maintain or improve the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for table fare, but encourages release of medium- to large-size fish.  Releasing these fish can help maintain balance in the fish community in Ox Yoke Lake and provide anglers with opportunities to catch more and larger fish in the future.Most of the land around Ox Yoke Lake is privately owned.  In 1966, 42 lake homes were counted around the shoreline.  By 1994 this number had increased to 62 homes, or one lake home per 230 feet of shoreline.    Shoreline areas - on land and into shallow water - provide essential habitat for fish and wildlife that live in or near Minnesota's lakes.  Overdeveloped shorelines can't support the fish, wildlife, and clean water that are associated with natural undeveloped lakes.  The combined effects of all lakeshore owners \"fixing up\" their property can destroy a lake's valuable natural shorelines.Shoreline habitat consists of aquatic plants, woody plants and natural lake bottom soils.  Plants in the water and at the water's edge provide habitat, prevent erosion and absorb excess nutrients.  Shrubs, trees, and woody debris such as fallen trees or limbs provide good habitat both above and below the water and should be left in place.  Natural lake bottom materials like silt or gravel are more ecologically productive than pure sand trucked in for a swimming beach.  A tidy lawn and a sandy beach make great spots for sunbathing and swimming but do little to provide habitat for fish and wildlife.  By leaving a buffer strip of natural vegetation along the shoreline, property owners can reduce erosion, help maintain water quality, and provide habitat and travel corridors for wildlife.Only if more lakeshore owners manage their shoreline in a natural condition can fish and wildlife populations on Minnesota lakes remain healthy and abundant.  More specific information on protecting or restoring shorelines and watersheds is available through DNR Fisheries offices.    </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Ox Yoke Lake is a 166-acre is a bass-panfish lake located near Backus, Minnesota.  Ox Yoke Lake has 2.87 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 42 feet.  There is a state-owned public access on the south shore. The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MNDNR) has classified Minnesota lakes into 43 different classes based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics. Ox Yoke Lake is in Lake Class 31; lakes in the class are generally clear, productive, and with moderate depths. Nearby lakes in the same lake class are Child, Five Point, and Sanborn. In 1997, an experimental regulation of a 10 sunfish bag/possession limit was initiated. The objective of this regulation was to improve the size structure of the population and increase the number of bluegills 8 inches or greater. <br> \n <br> \nOx Yoke Lake offers good opportunities for anglers seeking a variety of species. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass are abundant, however fish greater than 15 inches in length were not common. Sampled bass in 2006 survey ranged from 5.1 to 16.5 inches in length. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie are abundant. Average length was 7.7 inches. Few fish exceed 10 inches in length. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike abundance is near the average for Lake Class 31 lakes. The average length of 17.1 inches was small, however fish greater than 30 inches in length are present. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill mean length was 5.8 inches. There is an abundance of fish present between 6 and 7 inches in length and a fair number of fish present between 7 and 8 inches in length. Fish greater than 8 inches in length are rare.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch numbers are very low. Sampled yellow perch ranged in length from 5.5 to 8.7 inches. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers can help maintain or improve the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for table fare, but encourages release of medium to large-sized fish.  Releasing these fish can help maintain balance in the fish community in Ox Yoke Lake and provide anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future.   <br> \n <br> \nShoreline areas on the land and into the shallow water provide essential habitat for fish and wildlife that live in or near Minnesota\u0019s lakes.  Overdeveloped shorelines can\u0019t support the fish, wildlife, and clean water that are associated with natural undeveloped lakes.  <br> \n <br> \nShoreline habitat consists of aquatic plants, woody plants and natural lake bottom soils.  Plants in the water and at the water\u0019s edge provide habitat, prevent erosion and absorb excess nutrients. Shrubs, trees, and woody debris such as fallen trees or limbs provide good habitat both above and below the water and should be left in place.   By leaving a buffer strip of natural vegetation along the shoreline, property owners can reduce erosion, help maintain water quality, and provide habitat and travel corridors for wildlife.</p>",
