BASED ON CATCHES FROM THESE NETS THE WALLEYE POPULATION SIZE HAS INCREASED, THE YELLOW PERCH POPULATION HAS DECREASED THE NORTHERN PIKE POPULATION HAS REMAINED THE SAME. NORTHERN PIKE AGED (13 OF 13 FISH) SHOWED AGE CLASSES II-V AND VII WITH YEAR CLASS GROWTH DERIVED FROM BACK-CALCULATION. THE MEAN WEIGHT OF FISH HAS DECREASED FROM 6.5 LBS. IN 1981 TO 2.7 LBS. IN 1986. SIMILARLY THE LENGTH FREQUENCY DISTRIBUTION HAS COMPRESSED SINCE 1981 WHEN IT WAS 18.0-34.9 INCHES TO THE CURRENT 1986 DISTRIBUTION OF 20.0-32.9 INCHES.  THE WALLEYE POPULATION HAS SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED FROM 2.33/GILLNET TO 12.3/GILLNET IN THE LAST 5 YEARS . FOUR YEAR CLASSES ARE PRESENT (II-V) OF WHICH II IS BY FAR THE STRONGEST WITH 21 OF THE 30 FISH SUBSAMPLED. GROWTH AT ALL ANNULAR MARKS AS WELL AS EACH YEAR CLASS IS GOOD. THE MEAN WEIGHT IN 1981 WAS 2.1 LBS. COMPARED TO 1 PD IN 1986. THE LENGTH FREQUENCY DISTRIBUTION IN 1981 WAS FROM 16.0-20.9 INCHES, HOWEVER, NOW AFTER A DRASTIC INCREASE IN NUMBERS, THE FREQUENCY RE- FLECTS THE SMALLER WT AND CONSEQUENTLY LENGTH OF 10.0-24.9 INCHES. THE YELLOW PERCH POPULATION HAS COLLAPSED FROM THE 1981 POPULATION. THIS SEEMS TO COINCIDE WITH A RAPIDLY INCREASING WALLEYE POPULATION AND A RATHER LARGE BUT STATIONARY NORTHERN PIKE POPULATION. THE SMALLMOUTH BASS POPULATION WAS SAMPLED IN ONLY GILLNETS, NOT THE APPROPRIATE INDICATOR GEAR. FOUR YEAR CLASSES WERE FOUND II-V OF WHICH III WAS THE STRONGEST. GROWTH IS GOOD BOTH AT LAST ANNULUS FORMATION AND BACK CALCULATED INCREMENTS. THE MEAN WT FOR BOTH 1981 AND 1986 IS 1 PD APPROXIMATELY. THE LARGEMOUTH BASS POPULATION THOUGH DIFFICULT TO SAMPLE WITH STATIONARY GEAR WAS SAMPLED AND INDICATES THREE YEAR CLASSES II,III AND VI. YEAR CLASSES II AND III ARE OF EQUAL STRENGTH AND MUCH BETTER REPRESENTED THAN YEAR CLASS VI WHICH CONTRIBUTED 1 INDIVIDUAL TO THE DATA. GROWTH IS GOOD IN ALL RESPECTS AND THE MEAN WT OF .45 LBS. IS COMMON FOR BOTH 1981 AND 1986 DATA. BLACK CRAPPIES AGED (14 OF 14 FISH) INDICATE AGE CLASSES II-V WITH II AND IV APPEARING TO BE STRONGEST AND EQUALLY REPRESENTED WITH 5 FISH EACH. GROWTH IS GOOD AND THE MEAN WT OF .34 LB AND LENGTH FREQUENCY DISTRIBUTION OF 6.0-11.4 INCHES IS COMMON TO THE SAMPLED OF BOTH 1981 AND 1986. BLUEGILLS HAVE A HIGH POPULATION AND AGE ANALYSIS INDICATES THE PRESENCE OF ALL YEAR CLASSES AND BACK-CALCULATED INCREMENTS WAS GOOD IN SPITE OF THE DENSE POPULATION. YELLOW AND BROWN BULLHEADS ARE PRESENT IN MODERATE NUMBERS AND RESPECTIVELY. THE MEAN WT OF YELLOW BULLHEADS IS SLIGHTLY OVER .5 LBS. AND BROWN BULLHEADS ARE .5 LB. AVERAGE.</p>",

It is yet to be seen how this will affect fishing pressure on this small 127 acre lake.  While it has many species to target, the sizes of most species weren't too impressive. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike were caught in above average numbers (9.3/gill net), but the size was marginal.  Average length was 18.6\" and only 9% of the fish were 24\" or larger. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass were sampled by night electrofishing, resulting in a catch rate of 41.6/hr.  Average length was 11.1\" and 40% of the fish were 12\" or larger.  One thing unique to West Twin Lake is the presence of smallmouth bass.  While not as numerous (11.4/hr.), their size was pretty impressive, with an average length of 16.3\". <br> \n <br> \nAs far as panfish go, black crappie numbers were average, with 54% of the fish measuring 8\" or larger.  Bluegill numbers were also average for this lake type, but their size was small.  Average size was only 4.9\", with 11% measuring 7\" or larger. <br> \n</p>",

The lake has a maximum depth of 42'.  A nearshore survey was conducted to assess the populations of both game and non-game fish species.  Ten 100' long sampling stations were evenly spaced around the lakeshore.  Each station was then sampled by backpack electrofishing, and if conditions allowed with a 15' or 50' 1/8th inch seine. <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore survey took place on 24 July 2017, with all ten stations sampled by backpack electrofishing.  The 15' 1/8th inch seine was also used at ten stations, the 50' 1/8th inch seine was not used.  In total 15 species were sampled including intolerant species, Iowa darter, banded killifish, blacknose shiner, blackchin shiner, smallmouth bass, and rock bass.  This nearshore survey will be used along with the gillnet and trapnet survey conducted on 26-28 June 2017 to calculate an Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) score.  This score will be an indicator of the health of West Twin Lake.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of nearshore fish species in West Twin Lake was conducted on June 15-17, 2021 by Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program Staff.  Nearshore sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot seine, where possible.  Backpack electrofishing was completed at all ten sampling stations.  Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample seven stations, and a 15-foot seine was used to sample three stations due to difficult site conditions including deep drop offs with abundant woody habitat along the shoreline.  Nearshore sampling captured 14 species of fish including four species that are intolerant of disturbance (i.e., Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, and Rock Bass) and no species that are classified as tolerant of disturbance. <br> \n <br> \nA concurrent summer trap net survey was conducted by IBI Program Staff. Seven trap nets were set along the shoreline in locations that encompassed multiple habitat types. Bluegill, and Northern Pike comprised a majority of the trap net catch by biomass, with Bluegill most abundant by number. The number of Bluegill sampled per net was above the 50% quartile for similar Lake Class 32 lakes and the average length was 5.3 inches, with only 2% over 7 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore and trap net data were combined with gill net data from a June 2017 survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based IBI (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment.  In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g., Blackchin Shiner, Iowa Darter, and Rock Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g., Common Carp and Green Sunfish).  The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake.  For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.   <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey indicates West Lake is healthy as indicated by an exceptionally high FIBI score, well above the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes.  Data from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Crow Wing River Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.</p>",
