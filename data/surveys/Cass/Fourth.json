ONE CISCO WAS CAUGHT IN THE GILLNETS IN THE SOUTHWEST BASIN, WHERE SUFFICIENT OXYGEN AND COOLER TEMPERATURES ARE FOUND IN DEEPER WATER.WHEN COMBINING THE DATA FOR THE TWO BASINS, BLUEGILL ABUNDANCE WAS 14.25/TN LIFT.  THERE WAS A DISTINCT DIFFERENCE IN THE SIZE OF THE BLUEGILL BETWEEN THE TWO BASINS.  THE SOUTHWEST BASIN HAD A MODE OF 7.0-7.4 INCHES AND RSD-7=31 AND THE NORTHEAST BASIN HAD A MODE OF 3.5-3.9 INCHES AND RSD-7=12.  THE GROWTH WAS SLOW FOR ALL AGES.  BLACK CRAPPPIE WERE ONLY CAUGHT IN TRAPNETS IN THE SOUTHWEST BASIN (5.5/LIFT).  THE MODAL LENGTH GROUP WAS 8.5-8.9 INCHES AND THE RSD-10=17 AND PSD=65.  ONLY ONE WALLEYE WAS CAUGHT BETWEEN THE TWO BASINS AND IT WAS IN A TRAPNET.FEW LARGEMOUTH BASS WERE CAUGHT BECAUSE OF GEAR TYPES.  THE BASS THAT WERE CAUGHT VARIED FROM 6 TO 13 INCHES.  THE LAKE IS KNOWN FOR GOOD BASS FISHING.</p>",
