All of the rainbow trout collected were survivors of the 2003 yearling stocking.The splake catch and the average size of splake taken were also low compared to other splake lakes in this area.  It appeared that the 2001 splake stocking, which normally would have accounted for much of the assessment catch, had failed.  Splake as old as four years were taken, but the catch consisted mainly of one and three-year-old fish.  Growth had been about average for this area; fish reached a length of 12.6 inches by the end of their third year.White sucker were abundant, as they have been in all recent assessments of this lake.  No other undesirable fish species were found.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>This was the first of three assessments scheduled in the 2010 lake management plan to determine whether higher splake catches could be achieved by increasing stocking of splake and eliminating stocking of other species.   Nearshore fish sampling using a seine and backpack electrofishing gear was done to provide information to the PCA to be used for the development of an Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) for lakes in NE Minnesota.  Funding was provided by the Clean Water Legacy amendment. <br> \n <br> \nThe splake trap net catch fell short of the long range goal in the 2010 lake management plan (3.00 fish/set), and fell below the median for fall assessments of stream trout lakes in this area (1.75 fish/set; 1950-2009 data); however, management actions in the 2010 plan designed to increase splake catches had not yet taken effect at the time of this assessment.  The size goal from the 2010 plan (30 percent of fish over 12 inches in length) was met by the 2011 trap net catch.  Several year classes contributed to the 2011 catch, which included fish as old as six years, and several adipose-fin-clipped, known-age five-year-old fish.  Two-year-old fish from the 2009 fingerling stocking accounted for most of the splake catch in 2011.  Splake growth had been very slow; three-year-old fish reached an average length of just 9.5 inches by the end of their third year, compared to an area average of 13.0 inches.   Good long-term survival allowed Esther Lake to support a fairly high quality splake population, despite poor growth. <br> \n <br> \nNo goals were set for rainbow trout or brown trout in the 2010 lake management plan because stocking of both species was to be discontinued after 2011.  Gill net and trap net catches of rainbow trout in 2011 were close to average for that species in fall assessments in this area.  All but one of the rainbow trout collected were from the 2011 yearling stocking.  Rainbow trout yearlings stocked in 2011 had exhibited fair growth over the summer.  They were stocked at an average weight of 0.30 lb/fish, and weighed an average of 0.46 lb/fish when captured in this assessment.  <br> \n <br> \nAlthough brown trout had been regularly stocked for several years prior to this assessment, only two were collected.  Both were fish from the 2011 yearling stocking.  Growth of those fish may have been poor.  Brown trout yearlings were stocked at a average weight of 0.17 lb/fish in 2011.  Fish from that stocking collected in this assessment weighed an average of 0.26 lb/fish. <br> \n <br> \nWhite sucker catches in trap nets and gill nets each exceeded normal ranges for the lake class, but were not unusually high for this lake historically.  White sucker compete with trout for invertebrate forage, and high white sucker abundance in Esther Lake is probably one of the main reasons splake growth has been slow. <br> \n <br> \nEsther Lake has been continuously managed for stream trout since at least 1946, but has never been rehabilitated with fish toxicants.  Sampling in 2011 indicated it supported one of the more diverse nearshore fish communities seen in this area since nearshore sampling began in 2010.  Sampling of the nearshore fish community was done using a 15-ft, one-eighth-inch-mesh beach seine and backpack electrofishing gear.   Prior to sampling done in 2011, white sucker, splake, rainbow trout, brown trout, brook trout, lake trout, pearl dace, and blacknose shiner had been collected in Esther Lake. Brook trout were last collected in 1991, and lake trout in 1980.   Nearshore sampling  in 2011 added Iowa darter, brook stickleback, fathead minnow, finescale dace, and northern redbelly dace to the list of fish species known to be present in this lake. <br> \n</p>",

Growth of splake is apparently at the low end of the normal range for Grand Marais area lakes, yet the capture of one very large splake showed that large size is attainable.  The large population of white sucker probably limits the stream trout fishery, and growth of the splake seems to hint that the trout population should not be dramatically increased.   Fairly heavy fishing pressure likely reduces the population of stream trout to moderate numbers, and keeps growth of the remaining trout normal.  If long-range goals are to be met, reclamation with fish toxicants should be considered.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Esther Lake has been managed for stream trout since at least 1946.  For most of that time it was stocked with multiple species, usually including Rainbow Trout and Brook Trout or Splake.  Since 2012 it has been managed exclusively for Splake.  The 2010 lake management plan discontinued Rainbow and Brown Trout stocking as a cost-saving measure, and doubled the annual Splake fingerling stocking quota.  This was the second of three standard surveys scheduled in the 2010 plan to evaluate stocking changes in this lake, and the first to be done under the new stocking regime.   <br> \n <br> \nSplake were present in above-average numbers and average sizes in the fall of 2015.  The Splake trap net catch in this survey fell short of the long range goal (3.0 fish/set) from the 2010 plan; however, the catch was above the average (1.60 fish/set) for catches in fall surveys of stream trout lakes in this area.  The mean weight for Splake collected in trap nets fell within the normal range (0.57-1.21 lb/fish) for those surveys.  Splake as old as five years were included in the catch, with all stockings done from 2010 through 2014 represented.  Growth had been slow, with three-year-old fish reaching a mean length of just 10.1 inches at the end of their third year, compared to an area average of 12.8 inches.  Slow growth has been common in this lake, and has most likely been due to intense competition from a large White Sucker population.  The increase in the Splake stocking quota may also have contributed to the slow growth seen in this survey, by increasing competition between Splake for the limited forage available. <br> \n <br> \nThe Brown Trout catch was low, but that was expected since none had been stocked since 2011.  All of the Brown Trout taken would have been at least five years of age, and their small mean length (15.6 inches) suggested growth had probably been slow.  Five-year-old Brown Trout in lakes in this area would typically reach a length of 17.5 inches in five years. <br> \n <br> \nRainbow Trout were last stocked in 2011, and none were taken in this survey.  It was very unlikely that any yearlings stocked in 2011 could have survived to 2015 in an accessible and heavily fished lake like Esther. <br> \n <br> \nThe White Sucker trap net catch was the highest seen in this lake to date, but was still similar to most of those catches.  The catch was well above the top of the normal range (4.29 fish/set) for fall surveys of stream trout lakes in this area.  White Sucker compete with Splake for invertebrate forage, and their high abundance in this lake has almost certainly limited growth of stocked Splake.</p>",

THESE FISH WERE STOCKED AT AN AVERAGE WEIGHT OF 0.36 LB, AND WEIGHED AN AVERAGE OF 0.8 LB WHEN TAKEN IN THIS ASSESSMENT.  SURVIVAL APPEARED TO BE GOOD OVER THE FIRST SUMMER; HOWEVER, THE ABSENCE OF ANY AGE II FISH INDICATES THAT SURVIVAL OVER TWO YEARS IS POOR, PROBABLY DUE TO THE HEAVY FISHING PRESSURE ON THIS LAKE.  THE ABSENCE OF WTS IS UNUSUAL FOR FALL ASSESSMENTS IN THIS LAKE; HOWEVER, WTS ABUNDANCE HAD APPEARED TO BE LOWER IN THE 1988 ASSESSMENT THAN IN PREVIOUS FALL ASSESSMENTS, AND IT IS POSSIBLE THAT A SHORT- TERM DECLINE IN THEIR ABUNDANCE IS OCCURRING.  THE DECLINE MAY BE RELATED TO A SWITCH FROM BKT TO SPLAKE MANAGEMENT IN THE EARLY 1980'S, ALTHOUGH EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT THIS IS LARGELY CIRCUMSTANTIAL.</p>",
