Black bullhead, brown bullhead, yellow bullhead, hybrid sunfish, and black crappie were found in numbers typical of lakes in this area.  Bluegill numbers are very low.  One smallmouth bass was found.Since the 1976 lake survey, there have been marked changes in the fish population.  Bluegill numbers have dramatically declined while pumkinseed, yellow perch, black bullhead, brown bullhead, black crappie, and green sunfish have all increased.  Black and brown bullhead were not taken in the 1976 netting.Low winter oxygen levels in 1976-77, 1977-78, and 1978-79 appear to be the cause of the changes in the fish population.  Each of the species which increased are relatively tolerant of low winter oxygen levels while the bluegill is extremely sensitive to them.  At least prtial winterkills are, therfore, the major factor in the population change.The temperature-oxygen profile taken in 1976 indicates that stream trout survival was then possible.  The 1981 profile, taken at the same time of the year, indicates a thin layer of trout water.</p>",

Cattails are present in the swampy lowland on the south and east shores and waterlilies are scattered around the shore.  The moderately hard water has good clarity as a secchi disc could be seen to a depth of 7.5 feet.  There are tow inlets.  One inlet was dry and the other carried minute surface seepage from Lake Vadnais.  No outlet was seen; however, o topographic map of the area shows an internittent outlet that eventually runs into Lake Gervais.  Local information is that no outlet exists.Test netting of the water revealed that perch, pumpkinseed, and black crappie were caught in numbers that were below state-wide medians.  The catch of green sunfish and bluegill were above respective state-wide medians.  Bluegills exhibited a very dense population.  Largemouth bass young of the year were taken while shoreline seining.  There is no designated public access and entrance onto the waters is restricted to private property.  Indications are that fishing pressure is light.</p>",

Thus, populations of several species offer angling opportunities to lake residents.  However, there is no public access.  Bluegill were the most abundant specices sample, but are small with an average size of 4.5 inches and fewer than 10% being over 6 inches.  Low to moderate numbers of small (5 to 8 inch) black crappie are also present.  Moderate numbers of northern pike were sampled with lengths ranging from 23 to 30 inches.  Largemouth bass were also sampled, but not in high numbers.  However, the sampling techniques used were not effective on bass, so numbers could be higher than sampling results indicate.  Bass were small - lengths ranged from 5 to 9 inches.  Low to moderate numbers of yellow perch, hybrid sunfish, pumpkinseed, and green sunfish are also present, but are generally small.</p>",
