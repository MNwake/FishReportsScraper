                "narrative": "<p>Silver Island Lake is 1,239 acres with 1,222 acres littoral area and a maximum depth of 16 feet.  There is a concrete ramp at the public access and a U.S. Forest Service campground on the southwest shore of the main basin.  A second carry-in access on the south shore has three campsites at the end of a 1.25 mile dirt road, a road suitable only for high clearance vehicles.  The third public access is a portage trail from T Lake.  There are five water accessible campsites around the lake, each with fire grate, latrine and picnic table.  Silver Island Lake is a classic Canadian Shield type lake with many exposed ledge rock shorelines, islands and boulders prominent around the lake.  The lake shore is a mix of coniferous/deciduous forest on gradually sloping terrain.  Boaters need to be aware of the navigational hazards present in Silver Island Lake, with boulders and reefs at or near the water surface in many areas.  <br> \n <br> \nThe walleye population in Silver Island Lake is self-sustaining and requires no additional stocking.  Black crappies were first sampled in Silver Island Lake in 1980 and are thought to have migrated from Harriet Lake in high water conditions, possibly a flood in the fall of 1977.  Black crappies are now a self-sustaining population and provide a good fishery, with increased angling opportunity in late winter, after the walleye and northern pike seasons close.  The 2012 investigation was the first year that largemouth bass were collected in Silver Island Lake; four young-of-the-year largemouth bass were captured seining.   <br> \n <br> \nThe walleye numbers in 2012 were above average for the lake class, walleye sampled in previous investigations also have reflected above average populations.  The average weight in 2012 was 1.0 pound (14 inches), typical for this lake; the largest walleye was 24.7 inches (4.9) pounds.  Walleye reproduction was consistent with representation at ages 1-13. <br> \n <br> \nThe black crappie population in Silver Island Lake was sampled at above average levels in 2012.   The average length was 9.4 inches (0.6 pound) the largest black crappie was 13.6 inches (1.5 pounds).  Near shore sampling found good numbers of young-of-the-year black crappies, indicating strong black crappie natural reproduction in 2012. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike numbers were above average for the lake class.  The average weight of 1.3 pounds (18.1 inches) was below average, the largest northern pike was 24.5 inches (2.9 pounds).  With the lake whitefish and white suckers as forage, larger northern pike are likely in Silver Island Lake. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch numbers are above average for this type of lake.  The average weight was 0.2 pound (7.1 inches); the largest yellow perch was 10.3 inches (0.6 pound).  Historically, yellow perch in Silver Island Lake have been too small to interest anglers. <br> \n <br> \nLake whitefish numbers were below average for the lake class.  The average weight was 1.9 pounds (16.1 inches); the largest lake whitefish was 19.4 inches (3.2 pounds).  A recreational gill net fishery for whitefish is open each fall on Silver Island Lake, following the statewide regulations. <br> \n <br> \nSmall numbers of pumpkinseeds and rock bass were also collected in 2012; the size was generally too small to interest most anglers.   <br> \n</p>",

The Walleye gillnet catch decreased 64% from the previous assessment, while Lake Whitefish catch increased 325%. The Black Crappie population is expanding and a good fishery is developing and starting to be utilized by anglers. Yellow Perch densities are low, possibly due to high predation as 1/4 natural reproduction. Until more data can be collected it is not known if Black Crappie are impacting the Walleye population.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Silver Island Lake is a popular lake in the Finland area and is located about 10 miles northeast of Isabella. The primary public access has a concrete boat ramp and dock adjacent to the eight site US Forest Service campground on the southwest part of the lake. The shore near this access has many boulders making mooring boats along the shore difficult; although there are a couple boat docks for campers to use. A second access is a carry-in to a sandy beach on the south shore of the lake. There are also a couple of remote campsites adjacent to this access. The third access is a portage from T Lake on the northeastern shore of the main basin. There are also several remote campsites located on the shore of the lake, accessible by only watercraft. There are numerous boulders in the lake with some just above the water and others just below the water. The dark bog stained water of the lake makes seeing the boulders difficult and boaters should use care when motoring in the lake.  <br> \n <br> \nThe number of Walleye caught was within the normal range for similar lakes and consistent with previous investigations. The average size of Walleye in 2020 was 13.2 inches and 0.9 pounds. Over 35% of the catch was at least 14 inches long. The largest Walleye sampled was 26.6 inches long and weighed 6.5 pounds. Age analysis determined natural reproduction occurs consistently and fish regularly reach maturity. Growth is slow however, and Walleye require more time to reach a size of interest to anglers than other lakes in the area. <br> \n <br> \nThe gill net catch for Black Crappie was below average for the lake, yet still within the normal range. Despite the low catch in 2020 Silver Island Lake has historically had a decent Black Crappie population. <br> \n <br> \nThe Northern Pike gill net catch of 2.8 per net was near average for similar lakes in the area. The average length was 18.7 inches with the largest pike measured 27.8 inches and weighing 4.0 pounds. Only four pike were over 22 inches in length making up 16% of the catch. The lake has been able to produce some bigger pike with fish over 30 inches sampled in previous investigations. Growth of Northern Pike appeared to be normal, and natural reproduction has been able to sustain the population with six different ages represented in the sample.   <br> \n  <br> \nLake Whitefish gill net catch of 3.0 per net was within the normal range for the lake class. Length of whitefish ranged from 7.6 to 19.6 inches with 22% of the catch longer than 15 inches. The population is maintained through natural reproduction. Silver Island Lake is open to fall whitefish sport-netting. Refer to the current synopsis for all applicable rules and regulations for the whitefish netting season.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch were sampled at normal numbers compared to similar lakes in the area. The average length of perch was 5.2 inches. The largest Yellow Perch caught was 10.1 inches long with 12% of the catch was over 9 inches in length. Yellow Perch are an important forage fish in the lake, and anglers might catch an occasional keeper perch.  <br> \n <br> \nWhite Sucker are another important forage species in the lake and were sampled at average numbers for the lake class. The average length was 14.3 inches with the longest sucker measuring 19.5 inches. Rock Bass were also sampled in the gill nets. </p>",

Several bays around the lake were sampled for 10 to 25 minutes each in an attempt to capture bass, but only one adult Largemouth Bass and one adult Black Crappie were collected. These results indicate daytime electrofishing was not an effective way to sample Largemouth Bass in Silver Island Lake. It is unclear if the population is too new and small to be sampled effectively or if lake habitat limits the population to its current size. Future surveys will monitor the potential for a Largemouth Bass fishery in Silver Island Lake.</p>",

The walleye size (about 0.9 pound) was smaller than average for this type of lake; however, 38% of the walleye sampled were greater than 14 inches.  Black crappies provide good angling opportunities with an average size of 8 inches and fish up to 13.7 inches present in the 2008 survey.  Northern pike were present in average numbers with an average length of about 20 inches; the largest northern pike in 2008 was 35.5 inches.  Yellow perch anglers will find good numbers with fish over 11 inches present.  There is an annual fall whitefish-netting season on Silver Island Lake following the statewide regulations.  The average weight was 2 pounds for the whitefish sampled in 2008.  <br> \n <br> \nThere is a concrete ramp at the U.S. Forest Service campground on the southwest shore of the main basin; a second carry-in access on the south shore has three campsites.  There are five remote campsites around the lake requiring water access. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Silver Island Lake has an area of 1,239 acres with a maximum depth of 16 feet and has water clarity around 4.5 feet with brown bog-stained color.  The lake is located about 10 miles northeast of Isabella.  There are three accesses to the lake.  The primary access is a concrete ramp at the USFS campground on the southeast part of the lake.  The shore here is boulder and rubble but there are some boat docks present for campers to tie their boats to.  A second access is a USFS maintained carry in with remote campsites on the south end of the lake.  This is the old access and the road has become pretty brushy but the access itself is nice because it is in a protected bay with a shallow sandy beach.  The third access is a portage trail from Tee Lake on the south shore of the east bay of the lake. <br> \n <br> \nThe 2016 Walleye gill net catch in 9 sets was 22.1/net, which is well above average compared to similar lakes in the area.  The average weight of 0.6 pounds per fish is small compared to similar lakes.  The largest fish sampled was 24.3 inches long and weighed 5 pounds.  Eleven different year classes were sampled and growth rate of Walleye is considered average for the Finland Area.  <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie gill net catch was 1.4/net with an average weight nearly a half a pound each, both are considered average for similar lakes in the area.  The largest fish sampled was 13 inches long and weighed 1.3 pounds.  Crappies are not found in many lakes in the Finland Area and their reproduction is usually sporadic.  This year 75% of the catch were age-4 that ranged in size from 8.5 to 9.9 inches long in July.  This bodes well for the next year or two with anglers expecting to catch fish mainly in the 10 to 12 inch range. <br> \n <br> \nLake Whitefish gill net catch was 3.3/net with an average weight of 1.3 pounds, both are considered normal for similar lakes.  The largest fish sampled was 18.9 inches long and weighed 2.5 pounds.  Lake Whitefish growth is average for the area.  Silver Island Lake is open to whitefish netting in the fall.  A netting license is needed and fishermen need to read the synopsis for all applicable rules. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike gill net catch of 3.4/net and average weight of 1.4 pounds are normal for similar lakes, as is the growth rate.  The largest fish sampled was 29 inches long and weighed 4.9 pounds.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch gill net catch was 11.9/net with an average weight of 0.19 pounds, both normal for similar lakes in the area.  The largest fish sampled was 10.9 inches long, and 11% of the catch was greater than nine inches long.  <br> \n <br> \nWhite Sucker gill net catch was 14.7/net, which is above average for similar lakes.  Average weight of 1.5 pounds is considered normal.  Rock Bass and Pumpkinseed were also sampled in gill and trap nets.  <br> \n <br> \nSilver Island Lake is one of the more popular fishing lakes in the Finland Area.  It is known as a good Walleye lake, but the average size is a bit on the small side.  Fishermen sometimes target Crappies with success too.  The lake has a USFS non-fee campground at the access and a number of remote and water access only campsites.  Because the lake has dark bog stained water, fishing is usually good during daylight, although extreme care is needed when motoring because many boulders are present, especially in the narrows leading to the south basin.  The deep hole is in the middle of the lake, slightly on the north end just 50 yards or so from 3 large boulders just above the waterline.  There are many other boulders just below the waterline scattered throughout the lake.  The lake also gets use in the fall from duck hunters and whitefish netters. <br> \n</p>",

Walleye ranged from 6.6 inches to 25.8 inches (5.6 pounds).  Approximately 20% were between 14.0 inches and 16.9 inches.  The walleye population in Silver Island Lake has been self-sustaining and has required no stocking.Northern pike were sampled in average numbers, with an average weight of about 1.4 pounds.  This was the typical size of northern pike sampled in previous assessments conducted on this lake.  The northern pike ranged from 15.2 inches to 25.1 inches (3.4 pounds) in 2003.Black crappie were sampled in good numbers in the past; however, this was not the  case in the 2003 assessment.  The catch of black crappie was below average, compared to other lakes in this lake class, and had declined in each of the last two assessments.  The size of the fish in the sample was good, with most between 10.0 and 12.2 inches.  No strong black crappie year classes have been produced recently.Yellow perch were collected in average numbers, and the catch included fish up to 10.5 inches.  Approximately 15% of the yellow perch taken were larger than 9.0 inches.Lake whitefish usually are sampled in average numbers in this lake; however, the catch in the 2003 assessment was below-average for this lake class.  Whitefish sampled in this assessment averaged 1.38 pounds, with fish up to 2.6 pounds collected.  Silver Island Lake is one of two lakes in the Finland area that is open to whitefish netting in the fall of the year.  A special licence is required to participate in this harvest. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Walleye densities experienced a sharp decline from 1986 when a gillnet average catch was 24.0/lift. It appears Walleye numbers have stabilized as the two most recent assessments have had nearly equal average catches of 8.8/lift. Corresponding to the decline in numbers is an increase in the average size. Average lengths recorded during the 1992 assessment are the largest recorded during all assessments. Good natural reproduction is occurring with most year classes well represented. Age II and IV fish comprised 35% and 28% of the catch respectively.      The Northern Pike have demonstrated little change in densities over the last 3 assessments, however the average size of 2.6 pounds is larger than in previous assessments.      Black Crappie catch averages for both gillnets and trapnets declined, indicating a tendency for fluctuation in the population. Increased average size was observed in both types of gear used.     Yellow Perch were the only species sampled that showed a marked increase in numbers and appear to be at historically high levels.      White Sucker continue to be abundant.</p>",

Trap nets were set around the lake in the best habitat available but were not successful at capturing a representative sample of the crappie population.  <br> \n <br> \nAlthough not the species targeted, spring trap netting efforts did capture a small number of adult Bluegill which was the first time the species was sampled in the lake. In addition, a single adult Largemouth Bass was also sampled during spring trap netting and was the first adult Largemouth Bass sampled from the lake. It is unclear if the population is too new and small to be sampled effectively or if lake habitat limits the population to its current size. </p>",
