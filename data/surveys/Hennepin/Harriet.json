WHITE SUCKER, BLACK BULLHEAD, BROWN BULLHEAD, YELW BULLHEAD, WALLEYE, GREEN SUNFISH, PUMPKINSEED, BLUEGILL, BLACK CRAPPIE, AND HYBRID SUNFISH WERE FOUND AT ABOVE LOCAL MEDIAN LEVELS. CARP, GOLDEN SHINER, MUSKELLUNGE, AND YELLOW PERCH WERE FOUND AT BELOW LOCAL MEDIAN LEVELS. THE YELLOW PERCH POPULATION HAS CHANGED DRAMATICALLY SINCE 1974. THE CATCH OF PERCH INCREASED FROM 7.33 PER GILLNET LIFT IN 1974 TO 247.0 PER LIFT IN 1979 AND DECLI- NING TO 0.33 PER GILLNET LIFT IN THIS SURVEY. THE INCREASE IN PERCH WAS ATTRIBUTED TO REMOVAL OF OF NORTHERN PIKE FROM LAKE HARRIET. THE DECLINE IN THE PERCH POPULATION IS MOST LIKELY DUE TO A SUS- TAINED HIGH POPULATION OF WALLEYE. INCREASED VEG- ETATIVE COVER IN LAKE HARRIET AND RECOVERY IS MOST LIKELY RESPONSIBLE FOR INCREASED SUNFISH POPULATN IN 1984, 10.33 WALLEYE PER GILLNET LIFT WERE SAMPLED WITH A SIZE RANGE FROM 7.0 TO 22.9 INCHES, WITH THE MOST ABUNDANT SIZE GROUP AT 17.0-17.9 INS THESE FISH REPRESENT SIX YEAR CLASSES (1978-83) WITH THE 1980  AGE CLASS MOST ABUNDANT. MUSKELLUNG LEVELS APPEAR STABLE, AND ANGLER CATCHES OF LEGAL FISH SUGGEST THAT A VIABLE TROPHY FISHERY HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED. LARGEMOUTH BASS WERE SAMPLED BY TRAPNETS AND NATURAL REPRODUCTION WAS DETERMINED BY SHORELINE SEINING. IN GENERAL, THE FOLLOWING STATEMENTS CAN BE MADE WHEN COMPARING THE 1979 AND 1984 WORK. NORTHERN PIKE HAVE BEEN VIRTUALLY ELIM- INATED DUE TO REMOVAL. MUSKELLUNGE AND WALLEYE POPULATIONS HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED AND APPEAR TO BE STABLE. CARP, BROWN AND YELLOW BULLHEAD LEVELS ARE LITTLE CHANGED. YELLOW PERCH APPEAR TO HAVE DECR- EASED DRAMATICALLY SINCE 1979 WHILE BLUEGILL, BLCK CRAPPIE, PUMPKINSEED, GREEN SUNFISH, HYBRID SNFISH AND BLACK BULLHEAD HAVE INCREASED SUBSTANTIALLY.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Harriet is a 341-acre lake with a maximum depth of 87 feet. Harriet is part of the \"chain of lakes\" located in south Minneapolis, in southeast Hennepin County. A public boat launch and canoe access is provided through the City of Minneapolis Parks and Recreation. Questions regarding lake-use restrictions, including the electric only motor restriction should be directed towards Minneapolis Parks and Recreation. Harriet is primarily managed for Walleye and Muskellunge, but includes catchable populations of Largemouth Bass, Northern Pike, Bluegill, and Black Crappie. DNR stocks Walleye and Muskellunge fingerlings to maintain their respective fisheries. <br> \n <br> \nA Standard Survey (gill nets and trap nets) was conducted on Lake Harriet during the week of 7/8/2019 to assess the fishery. Harriet had good water clarity, measured at 13.5 feet during the time of this survey, with low oxygen below 42 feet. Eurasian Watermilfoil and Zebra Mussels have been found in Lake Harriet and remain present. Aquatic Invasive Species (AIS) inspections are preformed daily during public boat launch hours, with launches locked during non-inspection hours (refer to the Minneapolis Parks and Recreation website for more information). <br> \n <br> \nLow numbers of Walleye were sampled with gill nets (1.0/net) below the expected catch rate of similar lakes in the area. There were 8 Walleye sampled, with an average size of 16.4 inches and the largest measured at 23.5 inches. Low numbers of Walleye in the gill nets was likely caused by low fingerling availability. Prior stockings failed to meet the required stocking quota during 2015, 2016, and 2017. However, limited Walleye stocking is not solely responsible for low catch rates, as the previous four surveys (2014, 2009, 2005, and 2003) all reported Walleye catch rates below 1.6 fish per net, during which time consistent annual Walleye stocking was completed. In addition, the previous two surveys have seen record increases in Northern Pike and record decreases in Yellow Perch, two important components of establishing a Walleye fishery due to their roles as predator (Northern Pike) and prey (Yellow Perch). <br> \n <br> \nMuskellunge are not effectively sampled with the gear used in the summer fisheries survey. Angler reports reflect establishment of a viable, consistent muskellunge fishery with a desired size structure. Future surveys will include targeted ice-out Muskellunge sampling. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass are present in Lake Harriet, although targeted boat-electrofishing did not occur during the 2019 survey. Incidental capture with trap and gill nets caught 18 Largemouth Bass, with an average length of 13.4 inches and the largest measured at 19.9 inches. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike were sampled with gill nets (8.4/net) above the expected catch rate of similar lakes in the area. The 8.4 pike per net also marks the highest catch rate in the previous 25 years. There were 67 Northern Pike sampled in gill nets, with an average size of 25.4 inches and the largest measured at 36.4 inches. Northern Pike are maintaining a balanced population (an intermediate between high numbers of small fish and few numbers of large fish). Harriet is one of few lakes in the metro that consistently produces Northern Pike greater than 34\"+ and should provide excellent angling opportunity. <br> \n <br> \nHigh numbers of Bluegill were sampled with trap nets (72/net) above the expected catch rate of similar lakes in the area. There were 648 Bluegill sampled in trap nets during the 2019 survey, with an average length of 6.3 inches and the largest measured at 8.0 inches. While few Bluegill ever reach sizes greater than 8 inches in Lake Harriet, over 37% of fish sampled were greater than 7 inches and should provide good angling opportunity. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie were sampled with gill nets (3.6/net) and trap nets (3.1/net), slightly below the expected catch rate for similar lakes in the area. There were 57 Black Crappie sampled during the 2019 survey, with an average length of 9.0 inches and the largest measured at 12.2 inches. Although low numbers of Black Crappie were observed in the 2019 survey, this likely contributed to reduced competition and increased growth with fish reaching 12\"+, a rare accomplishment for many metro lakes. <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species sampled in low abundances were Black Bullhead, Common Carp, Pumpkinseed, White Sucker, Yellow Bullhead, and Yellow Perch. <br> \n</p>",

Ice-out netting was attempted in the spring of 2006 as a special assessment for Harriet to assess the muskellunge population, as this is the accepted method for targeting this species.   <br> \n <br> \nFor this survey, nets used for muskellunge spawning operations were used instead of the standard muskellunge nets; the latter are larger.  Therefore, this survey was not a truly comparable assessment of the muskellunge population within Harriet Lake. <br> \n <br> \nThree individuals were caught with lengths of 38.1, 41.3, and 42.9 inches.  Weight averaged 19.67 lbs.   <br> \n <br> \nHarriet Lake should be resurveyed in the future with standard (larger-sized) muskellunge nets for a proper population assessment of muskellunge. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Harriet Lake was found to have an average walleye population at the time of this survey. Walleye abundance appears to have decreased significantly from the four previous assessments which span a period of 21 years.  While stocking has remained constant at 106 pounds of walleye annually, the population decrease is likely due to the reduction in number of fish stocked because of production of above average size fingerlings and yearlings in recent years. The average size walleye sampled was 19.2 inches in length and 3.1 pounds in weight. Individuals up to 26.8 inches in length were also captured. Approximately one-half of the walleyes observed in gill nets during this survey were 20.0 inches or larger. Few Muskellunge were captured during this survey, however a quality fishery is reported by local anglers with fish over 30 pounds caught occasionally. Northern pike, while increasing in abundance in this lake,  are still relatively uncommon as a result of removal efforts during the 1970's. The occasional northern pike that is captured during population assessments average over five pounds in weight and 27 inches in length. Largemouth bass are also present, but were not targeted during this survey. Several individuals averaging about 8 inches in length were captured and good numbers of young-of-year were sampled during the natural reproduction check.      Bluegill, pumpkinseed sunfish, and sunfish hybrids were captured in abundant numbers during this survey, but averaged small in size. A little over one-third of all bluegill sampled measured 6.0 inches in length, or longer. Black crappie were observed in increased abundance from previous years, but the average size was less than 7.0 inches in length. Yellow perch and white suckers, although down in abundance from previous years, were sampled in good numbers and provide excellent forage for the population of game fish species present.  Yellow perch average only about 6.4 inches in length and 0.1 pounds each. Black and yellow bullheads were also sampled, but in relatively low numbers. Carp were also present in the sample for the first time since 1989.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Harriet is a 335-acre lake located in south Minneapolis that is primarily managed as a muskellunge and walleye fishery.  A boat launch operated by the Minneapolis Park and Recreation Board is located on the northwest corner of the lake, additionally, there are two fishing piers and ample shore fishing opportunities as the lake is encircled by a bike path. No permits are needed to use watercraft on Lake Harriet, however only electric boat motors are permitted.  A population assessment was conducted during July 2009 to determine the species composition and abundance of game fish in the lake.   <br> \n <br> \nLake Harriet is stocked with walleye fingerlings, yearlings, adults or a combination every year; despite this, walleye relative abundance was moderately low (1.6/gill net) compared with other similar lakes in the state.  Over the previous 4 assessments walleye catch has averaged 1.8/net.  In the 2009 assessment, 14 walleye were sampled averaging 14.9 inches and 1.3 lbs, and of those 6 (43%) were 15 inches or greater, and 1 (7%) was 20 inches or greater.  The largest was 21.1 inches and 3.1 lbs.  However, larger walleye are present in Lake Harriet.  In a spring trap net assessment, 122 walleye (2.1/net) were sampled with 52% measuring 15 inches or longer, 18% at 20 inches or longer, and 7% at 25 inches or longer.        <br> \n <br> \nSummer netting conducted during standard population assessments does not index muskellunge population abundance accurately.  Consequently, during the July evaluation, only 3 muskellunge were sampled at 36.6, 38.0, and 39.6 inches.  A spring trap-netting assessment targeting adult muskellunge was conducted in 2009.  This survey produced 20 muskellunge averaging 40.4 inches and 15.4 lbs.  Seventy percent were 38 inches or longer and 35% were 42 inches or longer.  The largest measured 48.4 inches and 27.6 lbs.  The adult muskellunge population was estimated at 0.33 fish/acre (110 total fish). <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike relative abundance was low (1.4/gill net) and this has previously been the case in Lake Harriet (averaging 1.1/net over the past 5 assessments).  Conversely, mean size of northern pike was relatively high  at 28.0 inches and 5.86 lbs.  Thirteen pike were sampled, 12 (92%) were 21 inches or longer and 5 (38%) were 28 inches or longer.  The largest measured was 35.7 inches and 13.23 lbs.  Growth was slower than average for the first two years, then increased to average compared with other similar lakes in the West Metro Area.  Northern pike averaged 19.5 inches in length by age 3. <br> \n <br> \nLake Harriet has a history of high bluegill abundance with catches averaging 183.0/trap net over the previous 5 assessments.  In 2009, trap net catch was 260.9/net.  Mean size of bluegill in this stunted population was 5.7 inches and 0.14 pounds.  Thirty-eight percent were 6 inches or longer, and the longest measured 7.1 inches.  Growth was slower than average compared with other similar lakes in the West Metro Area.  Bluegill averaged 4.2 inches in length by age 3.      <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie abundance has decreased over the previous three assessments.  Both gill net (4.3/net) and trap net (0.2/net) catch are the lowest on record since 1984 and 1991, respectively.  Mean size of black crappie (from both gears) was 6.7 inches and 0.16 lbs.  Thirty-one percent were 8 inches or longer and the largest measured 8.7 inches and 0.29 pounds.  Growth was average compared with other similar lakes in the West Metro Area.  Black crappie averaged 6.5 inches in length by age 3. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch were moderately abundant (11.2/gill net) in Lake Harriet, however, mean size was small at 6.4 inches and 0.12 pounds.  Seven percent were 8 inches or longer and the largest measured 8.8 inches and 0.26 lbs.  Growth was slow compared with similar lakes in the West Metro Area.  Yellow perch averaged 5.4 inches in length by age 3.    <br> \n <br> \nTwo largemouth bass were sampled (10.1 and 14.7 inches), however, passive sampling gears, such as trap nets and gill nets, are not effective methods for collecting largemouth bass.  For this reason, a spring boat electrofishing assessment was conducted in May, 2009.  Twenty-three largemouth bass were collected at a rate of 12.2/hour.  Average size was 14.6 inches and 1.85 lbs.  Eighty-seven percent were 12 inches or longer and 39% were 15 inches or longer.  The largest measured was 20.7 inches and 5.49 pounds.     <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled in low abundance were green sunfish, pumpkinseed, white sucker, common carp, black bullhead, and golden shiner. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Harriet (27-0016) is located in south Minneapolis, is 335 acres in size, and has a mean depth of 29 feet.  It is a class 24 lake and is primarily managed as a muskellunge and walleye fishery.    Walleye abundance is average (1.56 per gill net) for this lake class and size observed during this survey was bigger than past surveys with walleye averaging 3.33 lbs.  Growth appeared to be below average for this lake class, with most fish being the result of the 2002 stocking (3 years old).Two muskellunge were caught in gill nets (32 and 40 inches) and two were captured in trap nets (10 and 47 inches).  This catch rate was similar to previous surveys with fish coming from the 1996, 1998, 2000, and 2004 stockings.  Growth of these fish was below average until age 5, when growth was faster than average in other class 24 lakes. Northern pike abundance is low with only 7 fish total being caught in gill nets.  However, this low abundance has led to pike being decent-sized with good growth.  Fish averaged 8 lbs. in weight and growth was much above average for this lake class.Black crappie catch in gill nets (10 fish per set) was down from the last survey conducted in 2003 (35 fish per set).  However, despite the decrease in abundance, size remained similar to the 2003 survey with fish in this survey averaging only 0.19 lb.  A majority of the black crappies were over 7 inches in length, but only 4 fish were 8 inches or longer in the gill nets.  Growth was near average for a class 24 lake.Bluegill are abundant in Lake Harriet.  Catch in trap nets averaged 149 per net, which is much above the 75% quartile of 21.2 per net for this lake class.  This high abundance has resulted in a stunted population.  Few fish (less than 1%) exceed 7 inches and growth is below average.Yellow Perch were sampled within the quartile range for class 24 lakes.  The catch rate of 23 per gill net observed during this survey was down from the all-time high of 104 per gill net observed during the 1994 survey.  Size was small with no perch over 8 inches being sampled.  Growth was below average.  Only two largemouth bass were sampled during this survey, so conclusions about the status of this species could not be made.  Other species captured during this survey were green sunfish, hybrid sunfish, pumpkinseed, white sucker, and yellow bullhead.</p>",

Walleye numbers appear to have increased significantly over the three previous assessments which span a period of 15 years. The average size walleye sampled was 15.9 inches in length and 1.6 pounds in weight. Individuals up to 27.7 inches in length were also captured. One out of every six walleyes observed in this survey were 20.0 inches or larger.No Muskellunge were captured during this survey, however a quality fishery is reported by local anglers with fish over 30 pounds caught occasionally. Northern pike are rare as a result of removal efforts during the 1970's. The occasional northern pike that is captured during population assessments average over seven pounds.Largemouth bass are also present, but were not targeted during this survey. Individuals up to 14.5 inches in length were captured and numerous young-of-year were sampled during the natural reproduction check.Yellow perch, white sucker and golden shiners were sampled in abundant numbers and provide excellent forage for the high population of game fish species present. Yellow perch were sampled in the highest number per net set since 1979. White suckers averaged over one pound each.Bluegill, pumpkinseed, green sunfish and sunfish hybrids were captured in abundant numbers during this survey. Over 1/4 of the bluegill sampled were 7.0 inches in length or longer. Black crappie were present within normal sampling ranges, but the average size was only about 7.0 inches in length. Black and yellow bullheads were also sampled but in relatively low numbers. Yellow bullhead averaged over 10.0 inches in length and 0.7 pounds per fish. No carp were captured during this survey.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Harriet is located in south Minneapolis, part of the Chain of Lakes that serves as an important center for outdoor recreation in the Twin Cities.  The lake is entirely surrounded by city parkland, and has a public boat ramp, fishing pier, and abundant shore fishing locations for anglers to access the lake.  Boats are limited to electric trolling motors only.  Lake Harriet is 335 acres in size, and the primary management species are muskellunge and walleye.The Minneapolis Chain of Lakes have undergone numerous projects to improve water quality during recent years, including education campaigns to improve lawn-care practices in the watershed, the construction of detention basins to capture stormwater runoff, and alum treatments to remove phosphorous from the water column and seal it in bottom sediments.  These efforts have been rewarded, as secchi disk readings have improved from a low of 2.8 feet in 1948 to 11.5 feet in the 2003 survey, just under the all time high of 12.0 feet in 2000.Eurasian water milfoil was first discovered in 1991, and has become the dominant submerged macrophyte.  It not only has significant impacts on the fishery, but also on other recreation such as swimming and boating.  As such, some areas of the lake are treated with herbicide or the milfoil is harvested by mechanical means.Walleye averaged 1.1 per gill net, the lowest catch seen since stocking of this species began in the 1970's.  A majority (67%) of walleye sampled came from recent stockings in 2001-2.  Only 2 of 12 walleyes sampled exceeded 15 inches.  The lack of adult walleye is likely the result of the stocking of low numbers of walleye during the late 1990's.  Because stocking quotas are based on weight, in years where rearing ponds produce large fish the total number of fish stocked is lower.  These conditions occurred frequently from 1997 to 2000, and although efforts were made to compensate for numbers, it appears that these year classes are relatively weak.  Future stockings will attempt to better correct for the number of fish stocked in a given year.One muskellunge measuring 26.1 inches was captured in a gill net.  It came from the 2000 fingerling stocking, and has exhibited average growth.  Muskellunge stocking of 175 fingerlings in alternate years has been done since 1994, prior to which 65 fingerlings were stocked annually.  Gill net capture of muskellunge is typically incidental, and so is not a good gauge of abundance.  A special assessment targeting muskies during their spawning season will be performed in the future to better assess the population.Northern pike averaged 1.3 per gill net, similar to surveys since 1979 that have all found pike catch below 2 per net.  Prior to the early 1970's, northern pike were a primary management species.  A northern pike spawning area was operated on the north side of the lake in the 1960's, and fingerling and adult pike were stocked in the lake in the early 1970's.  When management focus shifted to walleye and muskellunge in the mid-1970's, an aggressive removal effort lowered pike numbers dramatically.  Coupled with a lack of good spawning habitat, the pike population has remained low ever since.  The low density of pike, combined with abundant forage, has resulted in a quality size structure for those pike that are present.  Mean length was 27.1 inches, and 25% of fish sampled were above 30 inches.  The largest individual measured 34.3 inches.  Growth is very fast.Black crappie averaged 35.4 per gill net.  That is an all time high for the species in Lake Harriet, topping 19.0 per net found in 2000.  Catches prior to 2000 were always below 10 per net, indicating that a trend of increasing abundance is occurring for this species.  A majority of the black crappie sampled (90%) were from the 2000 year class, which had a mean length 7.4 inches at capture.  These fish should provide for good angling in the coming years as they reach a size that is more desirable to anglers.  Presently, only 7% of crappies sampled exceeded 8 inches.The bluegill population in Lake Harriet is similar to that found in previous surveys, with a high catch per trap net (104.1) and small average size (5.5 inches).  None of the bluegill captured exceed 6.5 inches in length.  Growth is average for the lake class, but mortality appears high.  All but a handful of individuals were age 5 or younger.Gill nets caught 19.7 yellow perch per net.  Perch abundance has varied greatly in previous surveys, from a low of 0.3 in 1984 to a high of 247.0 in 1979.  Mean length in 2003 was 6.4 inches, and no individuals were greater than 8 inches.  Growth is below average.  Because of their small size, yellow perch are likely not an important target for anglers in Lake Harriet.  However, their relatively high abundance creates a good forage base for predator species such as walleye.A limited number of largemouth bass were captured in gill and trap nets, but because these gears do not adequately sample this species, no conclusions about abundance should be made.  The individuals captured were all age 1 or 2, and exhibited good growth.  Spring electrofishing will be performed in a future survey to better assess the status of largemouth in the lake.  Also captured in this survey in limited numbers were yellow bullhead, brown bullhead, white sucker, pumpkinseed sunfish, hybrid sunfish, green sunfish, golden shiner, and softshell and snapping turtles.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Harriet is a 335-acre, Class 24 lake located in south Minneapolis that is primarily managed as a Muskellunge and Walleye fishery.  A boat launch operated by the Minneapolis Park and Recreation Board is located on the northwest corner of the lake. From 2013 and still in place as of this report (early spring 2015), city-imposed inspections for aquatic invasive species include evening / overnight ramp closures.  Additionally, there are two fishing piers and ample shore fishing opportunities as the lake is encircled by a bike path. Motor use is restricted to electric only.  A population assessment was conducted during the summer of 2014 to determine the species composition and abundance of game fish in the lake.   <br> \n <br> \nLake Harriet is stocked with Walleye fingerlings, yearlings, adults or a combination every year; despite this, Walleye relative abundance was low in 2014. The catch rate of 1.0 fish per gill net falls below the 25th percentile for this lake type.  Nine Walleye were sampled, averaging 14.1 inches and 1.5 lbs. The largest Walleye was 27.6 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike relative abundance was moderately high in 2014.  The catch rate of 6.1 fish per gill net is between the median and 75th percentile for Lake-Class abundances.  The fish were also of quality size.  Fifty-five pike were sampled in gill nets; 98% were 21 inches or longer and 38% were 28 inches or longer.  The largest fish measured 38.2 inches.  Northern Pike are growing fast in Lake Harriet, reaching an average length of 25.7 inches by age 3.   <br> \n <br> \nBluegill were highly abundant, and of moderate size in 2014.  The catch rate of 83.3 fish per trap net exceeds the 75th percentile for this lake.  Bluegill averaged 6.4 inches and 0.19 pounds.  Seventy-eight percent of the fish exceeded 6 inches, and 12% exceeded 7 inches.  The largest fish measured 7.7 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie abundance is moderately low; the fish were caught at a rate of 3.8 fish per gill net which is between the 25th percentile and median for this lake.  The average Black Crappie was 7.8 inches and 0.24 lbs.  Forty-seven percent were 8 inches or longer and the largest crappie measured 9.8 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch relative abundance is low.  Mean size is 6.5 inches and 0.13 pounds.  Seven percent were 8 inches or longer, and the largest fish measured 8.5 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nSummer netting conducted during standard population assessments does not index Muskellunge population abundance accurately.

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Harriet is a 335 acre (85 littoral acres), Class 24 lake located in the city of Minneapolis, Hennepin County.  Lake Harriet was first stocked with muskellunge in 1974, and continues to be stocked with 175 fall fingerlings (2 fish/littoral-acre) in even numbered years.    <br> \n <br> \nTen large frame trap nets were set the day after ice-out in an attempt to sample the muskellunge population and mark fish for a subsequent population estimate.  These nets were fished from 4/7/09 to 4/13/09 for a total of 59 net-nights.  Twenty adult muskellunge were sampled in trap nets (6 female, 7 male, and 7 unknown) for a catch rate of 0.34 fish/net.    Female muskellunge averaged 43.3 inches and 21.4 pounds, with the largest individual captured 48.3 inches.  Male muskellunge averaged 38.6 inches and 12.0 pounds with the largest individual captured 43.0 inches.  Five year-classes were represented in the trapnet catch (1998, 2000, 2002, 2003 and 2004) with the oldest age 11.  The 1998, 2000 and 2002 year-classes appeared to be consistent, but recent year-classes were lacking in the sample.  Muskellunge growth was faster when compared to other area class 24 lakes with fish reaching an average size of 40.2 inches by age 8.  Muskellunge were in fair condition with an average relative weight of 77. <br> \n <br> \nThe Bailey\u0019s modification of the Peterson Estimator was used to calculate a population estimate and is used when recaptured fish are returned into the population and theoretically vulnerable to recapture in subsequent events.  The data used in the calculations was 20 marked fish, 21 caught fish, and 3 recaptured fish.  The Bailey estimator resulted in a population estimate of 110 adult muskellunge with 95% confidence limits of 45 to 275.  This estimate results in 0.33 adult muskellunge per surface acre.  This density estimate falls in the higher rage of densities found by MNDNR to date in other muskellunge populations.  The highest density estimate of 0.55 fish/surface acre was found in Eagle Lake in 2008 which is also in Hennepin County.  Muskellunge population estimates have been performed on 10 other lakes in Northern MN.  Density estimates from these lakes range from 0.07- 0.39 adult muskellunge per surface acre. <br> \n <br> \nForty eight northern pike were sampled at a rate of 0.8 fish/net and average length of 25.1 inches.  One hundred twenty two walleye were sampled at a rate of 2.1 fish/net and average length of 16.53 inches. <br> \n</p>",
