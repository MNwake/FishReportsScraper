Walleyes and tullibees show an increase and are presently above state and local medians in number per set.  The walleye population, however, shows a definite lack of fish larger than 1-1/2 pounds - possibly due to heavy fishing pressure.  Bluegills have increased significantly in number and decreased in average size since 1970.  No walleyes older than 6 and only two older than 4 years caught in test nets.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Buffalo Lake has a diverse fish community that ranges from warmwater species like largemouth bass and bluegill to coolwater species like walleye and northern pike to coldwater species like tullibee (cisco).  With increased shoreline development and angler mobility, fishing pressure has likely increased in Buffalo Lake as it has in most Minnesota lakes.  The fishery remains strong with good numbers of northern pike, walleye, and bluegill. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike are generally small, averaging just under 20 inches, but a good range of sizes up to 34 inches was found.  Good pike spawning habitat can be found in and near the lake via the Buffalo River. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye spawning habitat is much less abundant in Buffalo Lake.  Consequently, the walleye fishery is supplemented by fingerling stocking.  Buffalo was identified as a lake that might benefit from increased walleye stocking based on several factors including poor natural reproduction, a previously strong yellow perch forage base, and increasing fishing pressure.  The stocking rate was doubled to two pounds of fingerlings per littoral acre every other year beginning in 1998.  The increased stocking strategy has not resulted in expanded fishing opportunities for walleye in Buffalo Lake.  In fact, catch rates have declined in the past two studies.  However, it should be noted that the northern pike (a predator and comptetitor of walleye) catch rate increased to its historic high for this lake in 2007. <br> \n <br> \nWalleyes sampled in test nets averaged a respectable 1.3 pounds each.  Net catches were slightly lower than the lake's long term average at 4.0 walleyes per set. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill test net catches remained quite high for this lake at 48 fish per net.  These fish averaged 6.8 inches in length and several over eight inches were found. <br> \n <br> \nMinnesota's Pollution Control Agency (PCA) classifies Buffalo Lake as eutrophic.  Lakeshore and watershed property owners can help to slow the aging of the lake (eutrophication) by using the best management practices available.  These practices include (1) exceeding setbacks for structures and septic systems, (2) leaving buffer strips of natural vegetation along the shoreline, (3) leaving vegetation stands (especially bulrush and cattail) intact, (4) and not fertilizing lawns or using phosphorus free fertilizers.  Active participation in the lake association can also help.  Shoreline owners who wish to restore shorelines or landscape shoreline properties in ways that protect water quality, property values, and fish habitat can find help in materials available through the Minnesota Bookstore or the DNR.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Buffalo Lake has a diverse fish community that ranges from warmwater species like largemouth bass and bluegill to coolwater species like walleye and northern pike to coldwater species like tullibee (cisco).  With increased shoreline development and angler mobility, fishing pressure has likely increased in Buffalo Lake as it has in most Minnesota lakes.  The fishery remains strong with good numbers of northern pike, walleye, and bluegill, along with modest populations of largemouth bass and black crappie. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike are generally small, averaging just over 20 inches, but a good range of sizes up to 34 inches was found.  Also, a larger portion of sampled pike over 24 inches in length was found in 2012 than in any prior assessment (18%).  Good pike spawning habitat can be found in and near the lake via the Buffalo River. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye spawning habitat is much less abundant in Buffalo Lake.  Consequently, the walleye fishery is supplemented by fingerling stocking.  Buffalo was identified as a lake that might benefit from increased walleye stocking based on several factors including poor natural reproduction, a previously strong yellow perch forage base, and increasing fishing pressure.  The stocking rate was doubled to two pounds of fingerlings per littoral acre every other year beginning in 1998.  The increased stocking strategy has not resulted in expanded fishing opportunities for walleye in Buffalo Lake.  In fact, catch rates declined in 2002 and 2007.  However, it should be noted that the northern pike (a predator and comptetitor of walleye) catch rate increased to its historical high for this lake in 2007 and it remains relatively high in 2012 at 9.8 pike per net.  Walleyes sampled in test nets in 2012 averaged a respectable 1.6 pounds each.  Net catches were somewhat higher than the lake's long term average at 5.4 walleyes per set. <br> \n <br> \nPanfish populations were dominated by bluegill.  Bluegill test net catches remained relatively high for this lake at 38 fish per net.  These fish averaged 6.8 inches in length and approximately 16% of sampled bluegills were longer than eight inches. <br> \n <br> \nLakeshore and watershed property owners can help to slow the aging of the lake (eutrophication) by using the best management practices available.  These practices include (1) exceeding setbacks for structures and septic systems, (2) leaving buffer strips of natural vegetation along the shoreline, (3) leaving vegetation stands (especially bulrush and cattail) intact, (4) and minimizing fertilizer and other chemical use in the watershed.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Buffalo Lake is a 376-acre, class 25 lake located in central Becker County near the community of Richwood.  It is long and narrow with one bay extending north to the southern boundary of the White Earth Indian Reservation.  Although it lies near the headwaters of the Buffalo River, it is the furthest downstream major lake basin through which this river flows on its course to the Red River.  The bay on the west end of the lake near the low-head outlet dam has a dense stand of wild rice.  Buffalo Lake has a special regulation for Bluegill limiting anglers to keep five fish per day.  A standard fisheries survey was conducted in June 2022 to evaluate the fish population in Buffalo Lake.     <br> \n <br> \nWhile Walleye abundance was near average for Buffalo Lake, Northern Pike abundance reached an all time high in 2022.  Pike size was also smaller than previous surveys with fish averaging 20 inches long.  Similar to Northern Pike, Bluegill abundance was also at an all time high.  Anglers can expect Bluegill to average a little over seven inches long, with additional opportunities to catch larger fish.  Bluegill required seven years of growth to reach seven inches long in Buffalo Lake.  This survey also captured Black Crappie that had an average length of nine inches and Largemouth Bass with lengths up to 17 inches.  Other fish species present were Brown Bullhead, Black Bullhead, Yellow Bullhead, White Sucker, Pumpkinseed, and Rock Bass.    <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Buffalo Lake is a 376-acre, class 25 lake located in central Becker County near the community of Richwood.  It is long and narrow with one bay extending north to the southern boundary of the White Earth Indian Reservation.  Although it lies near the headwaters of the Buffalo River, it is the furthest downstream major lake basin through which this river flows on its course to the Red River.  The bay on the west end of the lake near the low-head, outlet dam has a dense stand of wild rice which is harvested annually.  Water quality is sufficient to sustain Cisco, a cool water species.  The lake is mesotrophic with a mean Carlson's trophic state index in the upper forties. <br> \n <br> \nBuffalo Lake's Walleye fishery is supplemented by biennial stocking of Walleye fingerlings.  This lake was added to the accelerated Walleye stocking program in 1998 and stocking rates were doubled, from one to two pounds of fingerlings per littoral acre per stocking year.  In 2017, Walleye catch rates increased for the second consecutive survey to 6.8 fish Walleye per gill net.  The historical mean catch rate on Buffalo Lake is 4.9 Walleyes per gill net.  The catch rate has been above or very near the expected range for similar lakes in five of the past seven lake surveys.  Walleyes sampled via gill nets in 2017 averaged 14.8 inches, and ranged from 7.3 to 26.9 inches.  Age three Walleyes, likely attributed to fingerling stocking in 2014, comprised 49% of the sample.  A similar situation occurred in the 2012 survey when age four fingerling-stocked fish comprised 45% of the Walleye caught.  Although good Walleye spawning habitat is lacking in this lake, the age class frequency distribution reveals evidence of natural reproduction.  The short stretch of the Buffalo River just upstream from the lake may provide a few small pockets of gravel for spawning of this species.  The growth rate of Walleyes in 2017 was similar to that reported in past Buffalo Lake studies and slower than the statewide averages.  The average length reached by Walleyes in four years was 12.7 inches. <br> \n <br> \nThe gill net catch rate of Northern Pike continues to decline from the historical high of 12.2 per set in 2007 to 8.0 per set in 2017.  The lake's historical mean is 7.0 Northern Pike per set.  Sampled Northern Pike ranged from 13.6 to 29.0 inches with a mean of 20.6 inches.  Northern Pike longer than 30 inches have historically been sampled with regularity, but not in 2017.  Despite this fact, the mean length and percent of the catch longer than 24 inches set historic highs.  Northern Pike up to age 7 were sampled, but the majority of fish were ages 2-4.  Northern Pike in Buffalo Lake reached an average length of 21.6 inches in four years. <br> \n <br> \nThe Yellow Perch gill net catch increased to 26.0 per net, which was above the lake's historical mean for the first time since 1997.  Yellow Perch averaged 6.9 inches in length and ranged from 5.8 to 9.0 inches. <br> \n <br> \nTrap net catches of Bluegill remained higher than the lake's historical mean (24.1 per set) at 37.4 Bluegills per trap net.  Bluegill relative abundance within the last twenty years has been significantly higher than the time period before.  Since 1997, the mean Bluegill catch rate has been 39.3 fish per trap net, while the mean rate for the period prior to 1997 was 11.6.  Bluegills ranged from 2.6 to 8.9 inches with a mean length of 6.3 inches in 2017.  The Bluegill age frequency was very diverse spanning 15 year-classes.  Interestingly, there appears to have been a complete recruitment failure in 2009 as no fish from this year-class were sampled.  An astonishing 40% of Bluegills were age 9 or older.  The Bluegill growth rate has declined compared to past surveys with fish reaching an average length of 4.7 inches in four years. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie, which have never been considered abundant in surveys in Buffalo Lake, exhibited a trap net catch rate of 0.11 per net in 2017, the same as 2012.  Gill nets were slightly more effective for crappie sampling, but still only 10 fish were caught.  The Largemouth Bass catch mirrored Black Crappie with only one fish captured in trap nets and ten fish in gill nets.   <br> \n <br> \nGill net catches of Cisco were once again well below the historical average of 6.4 fish per net.  Although the catch rate was a mere 0.6 fish per net, two distinct length groups were evident in the length frequency distribution table indicating at least two year-classes.  Cisco relative abundance has been very low since 2002. <br> \n <br> \nMinnesota DNR Detroit Lakes Area Fisheries staff conducted an assessment of lakeshore habitat on Buffalo Lake on 06/28/2017, following the Score the Shore survey protocols. The assessment consisted of 62 survey sites evenly spaced 200 meters around the lake. Assessments were made in three habitat zones mentioned above: the Shoreline, the Shoreland Zone, and the Aquatic Zone. The average lakewide habitat score was 70.0 (+/- 2.8) out of 100 possible. Approximately 56 percent of the sites were developed with a mean score of 58.0 (+/- 3.9), while undeveloped sites had a mean score of 85.6 (+/- 0.8). The Score the Shore survey was designed to provide a means to quantify and compare lakeshore habitat between lakes. The Buffalo Lake shoreline habitat score was lower than the statewide lake score average of 73.6. <br> \n <br> \nMinnesota DNR EWR Lake Habitat program staff delineated the floating leaf and emergent aquatic vegetation of Buffalo lake on 07/06/2017, following the protocols listed in the MN DNR Lake Plant Mapping Manual. There were a total of 99.4 acres of floating and emergent plants mapped. This consisted of 57.6 acres of emergent dominated plant communities and 41.8 acres of floating leaf plant communities. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Buffalo Lake has a diverse fish community that ranges from warmwater species like largemouth bass and bluegill to coolwater species like walleye and northern pike to coldwater species like tullibee (cisco).  With increased shoreline development and angler mobility, fishing pressure has likely increased in Buffalo Lake as it has in most Minnesota lakes.  The fishery remains strong with good numbers of northern pike, walleye, and bluegill.Northern pike are generally small, averaging just under 19 inches, but a good range of sizes up to 30 inches was found.  Good pike spawning habitat can be found in and near the lake via the Buffalo River.Walleye spawning habitat is much less abundant in Buffalo Lake.  Consequently, the walleye fishery is supplemented by the stocking of fingerlings.  Buffalo was identified as a lake that might benefit from increased walleye stocking based on several factors including poor natural reproduction, a strong yellow perch forage base, and increasing fishing pressure.  The stocking rate was doubled to two pounds of fingerlings per littoral acre every other year beginning in 1998.  It is not yet clear whether the increased stocking strategy has resulted in expanded fishing opportunity in Buffalo Lake.  However, test net catches did not increase in this first study since accelerated stocking began.Walleyes sampled in test nets averaged a very respectable 1.75 pounds each.  Net catches were nearly identical to the lake's long term average at 4.8 per set.Bluegill test net catches inreased sharply from all previous studies 1957 through 1997.  Trap net catches of bluegills in 2002 averaged 57.6 fish per set, which was nearly triple the highest previous catch.  These fish averaged 6.6 inches in length and a few over nine inches can still be found.Minnesota's Pollution Control Agency (PCA) classifies Buffalo Lake as late mesotrophic.  Lakeshore and watershed property owners can help to slow the aging of the lake (eutrophication) by using the best management practices available.  These practices include (1) exceeding setbacks for structures and septic systems, (2) leaving buffer strips of natural vegetation along the shoreline, (3) leaving vegetation stands (especially bulrush and cattail) intact, (4) and not fertilizing lawns or using phosphorus free fertilizers.  Active participation in the lake association can also help.  Shoreline owners who wish to restore shorelines or landscape shoreline properties in ways that protect water quality, property values, and fish habitat can find help in materials available through the Minnesota Bookstore or the DNR.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Located in central Becker County near the community of Richwood, MN, Buffalo Lake is situated near the top of the Buffalo River watershed and is the last major lake basin through which the Buffalo River flows on its course to the Red River.  Waters from Rice and Rock lakes enter Buffalo via the Buffalo River along the lakes southeast shore.  Another inlet, originating from Little Round Lake, enters the lakes northwest arm.  The sole outlet (Buffalo River) contains a fixed head dam which aids in producing relatively stable lake water levels.  Also incorporated in the structure is a fish screen restricting immigration of undesired fish species from the Red River.  The lake and its immediate watershed lie within the northern hardwood forest-tallgrass prairie transition zone.  The topography is gently rolling with a mix of cropland and woodlots.  The 1991 lake survey reported 53 lakehomes and one RV resort.  Most of the development is found along the south and east shores of the lake.  Collectively, property owners from the three connected lakes have formed the Buffalo-Rice-Rock Lakes Association in recognition of their mutual interests and concerns.Buffalo is one of eleven area lakes fitting ecological lake class 25.  Lakes within this class are some of the areas most scenic and pristine.  Other area lakes similarly fitting lake class 25 include: Bad Medicine, Elbow, Island, Little Cormorant and Long.  Lakes within this class are characterized by the following mean values: area 474 acres, maximum depth-57.1 feet, % of the lake less than 15 feet in depth-46.6%, total alkalinity-142.52 ppm, and secchi disk transparency-11.81 feet.  Fish communities associated with lake class 25 are often dominated by northern pike, yellow bullhead and bluegill but can display great species diversity.  Most lake class 25 lakes support only moderate walleye populations (3.37 walleye/acre).A mean trophic state index (TSI) of 46.95 was calculated for the summer months of 1993 and 1994 from lake monitoring data supplied by the Becker County COLA.  A TSI of 46.95 describes a mid to late mesotrophic lake of moderate water clarity (6 to 11 feet) with an increasing probability of oxygen depletion in deep water during the summer months.  Recent dissolved oxygen profiles reveal oxygen depletion often develops below 22 feet for at least a portion of the summer.  Midsummer thermal stratification is common as would be expected given the basin's long narrow shape and east-west orientation.  By the first of July a well define thermocline has developed with a strata between 17 and 27 feet.Fish stocking and removal records date back to 1909.  Since 1945 walleye have been stocked in 28 years, northern pike 18 years, bluegill 8 years, largemouth bass 3 years and black crappie 2 years.  Stocking of species other than walleye was discontinued in 1985.  A program of regular walleye stocking has continued and currently calls for biennial fingerling stocking of one pound per littoral acre (192 lbs.).  Fish removal has consisted primarily of the commercial harvest of bullhead.  Since 1950; 81,100 pounds of bullheads have been harvested, primarily during the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s.Buffalo Lake has a history of five fish population assessments dating back to 1957.  Northern pike have maintained relatively stable populations over the past 40 years, often at levels near or slightly above lake class averages.  The current catch rate of 6.5/set is slightly above the lake class average (5.8/set) and is the second highest reported.  Growth of northern pike was ten to fifteen percent faster than statewide averages with males growing faster than females through age V.  Six age groups (ages I-VI) were identified with 78% three years and younger.  The average length (19.4 in.) and weight (1.8 lbs.) of the sample describes a size structure similar to other lakes within lake class 25.Buffalo Lake provides little suitable walleye spawning habitat, relying heavily on walleye fingerling stocking.  Over 77% of walleye were from year classes that originated during years when stocking occurred.  Strongly represented in the sample were ages I, II, and III with a very good showing of the 1989 year class (age VIII).  The average length of gill net sampled walleye was 12.9 inches.  Walleye displayed near normal growth rates with females growing predictably faster than males.  The current gill net catch rate of 7.2/set is well above the lake class average and is the highest recorded for Buffalo Lake.Yellow perch are an important forage species, their abundance often describes the limits of abundance and growth of walleye and other predatory species within the fish community.  Historically, yellow perch have maintained population levels near or above the lake class average (13.3/set).  The current catch rate of 31.7/set represents a historical high perch population, a population which has experienced steady increases since 1981.  Increases in yellow perch abundance have paralleled similar increases in the walleye population.  The size structure of the perch population is dominated by small fish and draws little interest from anglers.  The current average length (6.6 inches) and weight (0.1 lbs.) has changed little from earlier assessments.Unlike many area lakes, Buffalo hasn't seen great fluctuations in its bluegill community.  Over the past forty years, trap net catch rates have remained at or near the bottom of their normal range, likely reflecting the competitive dominance exerted by an abundant yellow perch population.  Seven age groups of bluegill were identified from trap net data, revealing good representation from a wide range of age groups.  Length frequency data indicates a mix of sizes with good numbers of \"keeper sized\" bluegill.  Mean weight (0.3 lbs.) and length (6.8 in.) of trap net sampled bluegill were slightly above the lake class averages.  Bluegill growth rates appear to be near or slightly above normal.Catch rates for both largemouth bass and black crappie remain well below lake class averages.  Midsummer assessment netting is often an inadequate measure of bass and crappie abundance.  Early spring electrofishing and trap netting often provides better information for these species.High bullhead numbers during the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s prompted extensive commercial harvest.  Currently bullhead numbers are much lower with brown and yellow bullheads the dominant species, a condition often reflective of good water quality.Lakes are a valuable and vulnerable resource requiring vigilant stewardship by agencies and private citizens alike.  Stewardship requires the understanding that what we do on the land and in the water has a direct impact on the lake's chemistry, biology, and aesthetics.  Lake stewardship must extend from the shoreline to the watershed, where agricultural, residential, and urban land management practices may profoundly impact a lake.  As a lakeshore owner, supporting your lakeshore association and adopting shoreline best management practices can yield big dividends for the owner, the lake and the watershed.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of the nearshore fish community was conducted by Fisheries Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program Staff starting July 31, 2017. Ten sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 15-foot or 50-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at all ten sites with three sites sampled from the boat. Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample two sites, a 15-foot seine was used at five sites, and soft sediments with abundant vegetation prevented the use of seines at three sampling sites. Nearshore sampling captured 14 native species of fish including four species that are intolerant of disturbance (Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Iowa Darter, and Rock Bass) and no species that are tolerant of disturbance. <br> \n <br> \nData from this targeted nearshore survey is combined with trap net and gill net data from a June 2017 standard survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based Index of Biological Integrity (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment. The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. The FIBI score for Buffalo Lake from this survey is above an impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes. For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website. <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Buffalo River Watershed assessment of surface waters process completed in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.</p>",
