                "narrative": "<p>Barrs is a 117 acre lake located north of Duluth, MN just off County #44.  Barrs Lake, which has no public access, has maximum depth of 23 feet with 83 percent of the lake shallower than 15 feet.  Fish population investigations have been conducted in 1956, 1973, 1977 and 1997.     Abundance of walleye indexed with assessment nets was 1.0 per lift in 1997.  This index value was low compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  However, size and growth of walleye sampled from Barrs lake was good.  Mean length of sampled walleye was 22.9 inches and length at age IV was 15.0 inches.  It appears that Barrs lakes ability to naturally produce walleye has declined compared to assessments conducted prior to 1980.     Catch rates for northern pike, yellow perch, black crappie and bluegill indexed with assessment nets were all within accepted ranges compared to Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Size structure was poor for all these species except bluegill.  Growth rates were fast for northern pike, slow for yellow perch and average for black crappie and bluegill compared to other populations sampled in Duluth Area.     Lakeshore property owners expressed concern about an apparent increase in abundance of algae during the summer in recent years.  The filamentous green algae \"Spirogyra\" was indentified as abundant within the shallow area of Barrs Lake during the 1997 assessment.  Lakeshore development has increased from 17 cabins/homes in 1956 to 37 in 1997.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Barrs is a 117 acre lake located north of Duluth, MN just off County #44.  Barrs Lake, which has no public access, has a maximum depth of 23 feet with 83 percent of the lake shallower than 15 feet.  Barrs was last assessed in 1997.  Barrs was surveyed during the summer of 2009 to update information about fish populations.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance of 0.5 per gillnet lift was down from 1997 (1.0) and was below average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Mean length was 16.7 inches but not enough individuals were captured to evaluate stock density or growth.  Walleye are not stocked into Barrs by the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources, but privately funded walleye fingerling stocking has occurred as recently as 2004 and 2006.  All three walleye captured were aged and corresponded to stocked year-classes. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie abundance of 2.1 per trapnet lift was down from 1997 (2.7) but average when compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Black crappie mean length was 7.8 inches and growth was average when compared to other Duluth Area lakes.  All year-classes from 2002 through 2007 were represented in the sample.   <br> \n <br> \nBluegill abundance of 6.8 per trapnet lift was up from 1997 (4.7) but below average when compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Average length of sampled bluegills was 5.8 inches and growth was average when compared to other Duluth Area lakes.  All year-classes from 2001 to 2006 were represented.   <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass were sampled for the first time in Barrs in 2009.  Three largemouth bass were captured in gillnets and ranged in size from 13.5 to 14.3 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike abundance of 4.0 per gillnet lift was down from 1997 (4.7) but average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Mean length was 23.6 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch abundance of 0.7 per gillnet lift was down from 1997 (3.3) and was below average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Average length of perch was 7.4 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species sampled include pumpkinseed, rock bass and white sucker. <br> \n</p>",
