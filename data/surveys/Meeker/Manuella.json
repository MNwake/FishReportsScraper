                "narrative": "<p>Manuella is a smaller sized lake (292 acres) located near Darwin, in Meeker County. A small state-owned access with a single cement boat ramp is located on the east shore. Manuella has 3 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 51 feet. The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MNDNR) has divided Minnesota's lakes into 44 different classes based on physical and chemical characteristics. Manuella is a class 24 lake and other similar lakes in the Hutchinson Fisheries Management Area are Erie and Stella.      <br> \n <br> \nManuella is a typical bass/panfish type of lake with a good amount of aquatic vegetation and a little bit of structure too. Historically, low to moderate numbers of Walleye are typically sampled at Manuella Lake and this was again the case in 2021. The 2021 gill net catch rate indicated that fair numbers were present, with Walleye averaging an impressive 18 inches in length. The maximum length for Walleye was just under 26 inches. Anglers targeting Northern Pike can expect good action and the chance of landing a lunker is not out of the question. Northern Pike averaged 22 inches in length and fish up to 36 inches were captured. Many anglers troll the deep weed edge with crankbaits for pike and the occasional Walleye. The lake is often clear enough for spearing Northern Pike in the winter. Decent numbers of crappie were netted, with a fair amount being over 9 inches in length. The longest Black Crappie sampled in 2021 was 12 inches. Decent numbers of Smallmouth Bass were sampled in the gill nets with the longest fish being just under 20 inches. The Washington, Stella, and Manuella chain of lakes offers the best fishing opportunities in Meeker County for Smallmouth Bass. Largemouth Bass are typically not evaluated using gill nets, but good numbers were collected this year, with the maximum length being 19 inches. Try the lily pads with a weedless frog if you are after Largemouth Bass. Bluegill are also not typically assessed with gill nets, but good numbers of 7 inch long fish were sampled this summer. Try the deep weed edge with a teardrop jig tipped with a wax worm - vertically jigged down around 10 to 12 feet for the bigger sunfish. The longest Bluegill sampled in 2021 was 8 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nOther species that anglers may encounter include Black Bullhead, Hybrid Sunfish, Pumpkinseed Sunfish, White Sucker, and Yellow Bullhead.   <br> \n <br> \nPeople can have significant impacts on lakes and the fish populations they support. Overharvest, lakeshore development, removal of shoreline vegetation, and introductions of invasive species can all adversely affect fish populations. Aquatic invasive species (AIS) are typically moved from infested to non-infested waters by anglers, boaters and lakeshore owners, and can adversely impact lakes and fish populations. Eurasian watermilfoil is present in Manuella Lake. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants and animals from their watercraft and drain all lake water from their boat and bait buckets before leaving the lake. If you suspect an infestation of an invasive species in this lake, save a specimen and report it to a local DNR office. Additional information on all of these topics can be found on the DNR website (www.dnr.state.mn.us) or by contacting the Hutchinson Area Fisheries office.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Fall trap netting was conducted at Manuella Lake beginning on September 9, 2019 to gain information on its Black Crappie and Bluegill populations.  The Manuella fall water temperature was 65 F.  Fall trap net data should not be compared to standardized summer trap net data.\n\nFall trap nets, a non-standardized type of survey, caught low numbers (3) of Black Crappie for a catch rate of 0.4/net.  Fish were 5.3 to 6.0 inches in length and averaged 5.7 inches.  Fall may not be a good time of year to sample Black Crappie at Manuella Lake, for unknown reasons.  Standard summer trap nets also caught low numbers (7) of Black Crappie for a catch rate of 0.9/net.  In 2019, summer gill nets did the best job of sampling the Black Crappie population, capturing 84 fish for a catch rate of 14.0/net, with fish ranging from 4.7 to 11.6 inches in length.  Crappie tend to not be overly abundant at Manuella, but the 2019 population looked as good as it has ever been, so anglers should have decent luck.   \n\nFall trap nets, a non-standardized type of survey, caught moderate numbers (73) of Bluegill for a catch rate of 10.4/net, with fish ranging from 2.9 to 7.4 inches in length and averaging 4.5 inches.  Summer trap nets sampled higher numbers (230) of Bluegill for a catch rate of 28.8/net, but maximum length was only 6.8 inches.  Summer gill nets, set in deeper offshore water, sampled 22 Bluegill from 7.0 to 9.1 inches in length, showing that larger fish were present in the population.  Sunfish anglers should find plenty of action at Manuella.\n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Manuella is a small lake in Meeker County with a surface area of 286 acres and a maximum depth of 51 feet.  This is a popular fishing lake and generally provides good fishing for a variety of fish species.  In 1993, personnel from the Hutchinson Area Fisheries Headquarters used trapnets, gillnets, seines and an electrofishing boat to survey the fish population in Lake Manuella.  Gamefish species collected in this years survey included northern pike, bluegill, smallmouth bass, largemouth bass, black crappie, walleye and yellow perch.  Other species, such as white sucker, pumpkinseed sunfish, black bullhead, yellow bullhead, bowfin and common carp were also present in testnet samples.     Walleye numbers have remained consistent over the last fifteen years, ranging from 5 per gillnet in 1978 to 4.2 per gillnet in this years survey.  Although walleye numbers are considerably lower in Manuella than in other lakes in this chain (Stella and Washington), the average size walleye (17 inches) was larger than the other two lakes.  Walleye larger than 27 inches were captured in spring trapnetting.        Northern pike numbers in Lake Manuella have followed a downward trend similar to that observed in most area lakes.  Drought conditions and low water levels during the late 1980's limited the success of northern pike reproduction.  Although the catch rate in this years survey (4 per gillnet) was near the average for lakes similar to Lake Stella, the average size was small (21 inches).  Although the average size of northern pike was small, most of the current population is less than 3 years old, which indicates improved reproduction and with good growth rates should provide catches of larger fish in the next few years.     Only ten black crappie were sampled during the summer survey, but this species is often not sampled well with trapnets or gillnets during summer months.  Since black crappie often suspend in open water, away from the shoreline, they may not show up in testnets in representative numbers.  Reports from local anglers indicate that fishing success for black crappie in Lake Manuella is fair to good.     Bluegill numbers have varied considerably since 1978.  This years catch rate (33 per trapnet) was the highest recorded since the 1978 survey.  This catch rate is about average for lakes with physical characteristics similar to Lake Manuella.  The majority of bluegill are between 5 and 7 inches in length.  Bluegill at the upper end of this range should be an acceptable size to most anglers.       Largemouth and smallmouth bass provide additional opportunities to anglers on Lake Manuella, and good populations of both species are present.  Smallmouth bass catch rates (8 per gillnet) were well above average, and the average size of over 12 inches indicates that quality size fish are available to anglers.  The largest smallmouth bass sampled in testnets was 17 inches.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program Staff conducted a targeted survey of nearshore fish species in Lake Manuella on June 24th, 2019.  Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible.  Backpack electrofishing was completed at 10 sampling stations, but two stations were sampled from the boat due to site conditions.  Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample four stations, a 15-foot seine was used at four stations, and site conditions prevented the use of seines at two stations.  Nearshore sampling captured 18 species of fish including three species that are intolerant of disturbance (Banded Killifish, Iowa Darter, and Least Darter) and two that are tolerant of disturbance (Fathead Minnow and Green Sunfish). <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore data were combined with trap net and gill net data from an August 12th, 2019 survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based IBI (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment.  In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g. Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, and Logperch), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g. Fathead Minnow).  The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake.  For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.   <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the North Fork Crow River Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Manuella is a small sized Lake (292 acres) located near Darwin, in Meeker County.  A moderate sized state owned access, with a cement boat ramp, is present on the east shore.  Manuella has 3.03 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 51 feet.  The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has divided Minnesota's lakes into 44 different classes based on physical and chemical characteristics.  Manuella is a class 24 lake and another similar lake in the Hutchinson Fisheries Management Area is Erie.    <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike anglers know that Manuella typically offers some decent fishing opportunities.  Moderate numbers of pike were gill netted in 2020, with a wide variety of lengths, topping out at 29 inches.   Lower numbers of Walleye were netted in 2020, which is typical for Manuella Lake, but sampled fish had an impressive average length of 20 inches.  Drop shots or slip bobbers on the outer edge of the submergent vegetation can produce both Northern Pike and Walleye.  Historic Black Crappie net catches typically produce low catch rates at Manuella. In 2020, however Black Crappie, in the 7 to 8 inch length range were abundant, with fish maxing out at 12 inches.  Anglers should expect decent Bluegill action at this classic bass-panfish type of lake, but will need to do some sorting and searching if they are after larger fish.  Historic net catches show that Bluegill are typically sampled at average levels at Manuella..  Try fishing a little deeper, off the deep weed-line in mid-summer, to find the bigger sunfish.  Largemouth and Smallmouth Bass anglers should find that there are typically good numbers and a wide size range of bass at Manuella Lake.  The Washington, Stella, and Manuella chain of lakes offers the best fishing opportunities in Meeker County for Smallmouth Bass.  The maximum length for Smallmouth Bass sampled was 18 inches in 2020.   <br> \n <br> \nOther species that anglers may encounter include Bowfin, Hybrid Sunfish, Pumpkinseed Sunfish, White Sucker, Yellow Bullhead, and Yellow Perch.      <br> \n <br> \nPeople can have significant impacts on lakes and the fish populations they support.  Over harvest, lakeshore development, removal of shoreline vegetation, and introductions of invasive species can all adversely affect fish populations.  Aquatic invasive species (AIS) are typically moved from infested to non-infested waters by anglers, boaters and lakeshore owners, and can adversely impact lakes and fish populations. Eurasian watermilfoil is present in Manuella Lake.  To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants and animals from their watercraft and drain all lake water from their boat and bait buckets before leaving the lake.  If you suspect an infestation of an invasive species in this lake, save a specimen and report it to a local DNR office.  Additional information on all of these topics can be found on the DNR website (www.dnr.state.mn.us) or by contacting the Hutchinson Area Fisheries office.  Thanks and good fishing! <br> \n</p>",

A population assessment was conducted using standard gill nets, trap nets, and spring electrofishing techniques.  Smallmouth bass, walleye, and northern pike are the primary species managed for while largemouth bass, black crappie, bluegill, and yellow perch are secondary species.Gill nets sampled 48 smallmouth bass, for a catch rate of 8.0 per net.  Smallmouth ranged in size from 7.6 to 18.6 inches and had an average length of 12.5 inches.  Approximately 73% of the fish sampled were 11 inches or longer.      Gill nets sampled 47 walleye, for a catch rate of 7.8 per net.  Fish ranged in size from 6.5 to 22.8 inches and had an average length of 12.7 inches.Gill nets sampled 27 northern pike, for a catch rate of 4.5 per net.  Fish ranged in size from 14.3 to 28.9 inches and had an average length of 21.3 inches.Gill nets sampled zero yellow perch.Trap nets sampled 263 bluegill, for a catch rate of 29.2 per net.  Fish ranged in size from 1.4 to 7.3 inches and had an average length of 5.8 inches.Trap nets sampled 9 black crappie, for a catch rate of 1.0 per net.  Fish ranged in length from 4.5 to 11.6 inches and had an average length of 8.3 inches.  Black crappie have never been abundant in past surveys.Spring night-time electrofishing sampled 31 largemouth bass (31.0 per hour of on-time).  Largemouth ranged in size from 7.9 to 15.4 inches and had an average length of 10.3 inches.Electrofishing sampled 13 smallmouth bass (13.0 per hour of electrofishing on-time).  Smallmouth ranged in size from 5.0 to 13.0 inches and had an average length of 8.7 inches.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A standard survey was conducted at Manuella Lake beginning on August 12, 2019, to monitor the lake's fish population and to evaluate the 1993 Walleye fry stocking regime.  Manuella is a class 24 lake and net catches were compared to other similar lakes around the state.  The 2015 MNDNR Fisheries lake management plan (LMP) listed Largemouth Bass, Northern Pike, and Smallmouth Bass as primary management species at Manuella Lake.  Black Crappie, Bluegill, and Walleye were listed as secondary management species.  In 2019, a total of 15 species, plus hybrid sunfish, were sampled in the gill nets (GN) and trap nets (TN).  The dissolved oxygen concentration dropped below 2.0 mg/l at 19 feet, indicating an unmixed lake, where the deepest portion of the lake lacked adequate oxygen for fish use.  This was normal for deeper lakes in this part of the state for late summer.  Water clarity was moderate with a secchi disk reading of 6.5 feet, due to the presence of phytoplanktonic algae.  Some shore fishing opportunities exist at the Meeker County Park on the lake's east shore.  Manuella is designated infested with Eurasian Watermilfoil.  Manuella is part of a larger study on the Washington chain of lakes, designed to estimate the Walleye population as well as Walleye angler exploitation.  Walleye were marked with jaw tags during an ice-out electrofishing survey.  If you catch a tagged Walleye on Manuella, please call (320) 234-2550 with the tag number, length of fish, date caught, your contact information, and whether it was kept or released.    <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled low numbers of Largemouth Bass (7) for a catch rate of 1.2/net, which was above the normal range for this type of lake.  Gill netted Largemouth Bass were 8.2 to 14.9 inches long.  Trap nets also sampled low numbers (4) of Largemouth Bass for a catch rate of 0.5/net.  Trap netted Largemouth Bass were 5.6 to 9.8 inches long.  The standard gear for sampling Largemouth Bass, spring night-time electrofishing, was not completed in 2019.  Anecdotal angling reports indicated that anglers catch good numbers of small and medium sized Largemouth Bass at Manuella, occasionally tying into a whopper.  Generous amounts of submergent vegetation and lily pads provide ideal habitat for this species. <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled moderate numbers (>5/GN to <10/GN) of Northern Pike (33) for a catch rate of 5.5/net, which was within the normal range for this type of lake.  The 2014 catch rate was similar at 6.2/net.  The 2015 LMP's long range goal (1.5 to 7.3/net) was met.  Catch rates from 1957 to 2019 (n=12) were variable, ranging from 1.4 to 12.0/net averaging 4.8/net, indicating a typical abundance for Manuella Pike in 2019.  Historically, recruitment would be classified as low to moderate.  In 2019 gill netted Northern Pike were 18.2 to 35.3 inches long averaging an impressive 25.2 inches, indicating a quality size structure.  Manuella is in the Northern Pike North Central Management Zone regulation area, which has a 22 to 26 inch protected slot limit (PSL), with a ten fish bag limit (8 below and 2 above).  All Northern Pike from 22 to 26 inches must be immediately released.  The PSL regulation was designed to allow more harvest of abundant small pike (<22 inches in length) and to shift the population size structure to more medium sized fish (22 to 29.9 inches in length).  Pike anglers could expect good fishing at Manuella, and a shot at a large (>30 inch) fish was not out of the question.  <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled low numbers of Smallmouth Bass (17) for a catch rate of 2.8/net, which was above the normal range for this type of lake.  The 2014 GN catch rate was a similar at 6.2/net.  The 2015 LMP's goal for Smallmouth Bass (>2.3/GN) was met.  Historic GN catch rates from 1957 to 2019 (n=12) were variable ranging from 0.0 to 13.3/net and averaging 5.3/net.  Data indicated a typical abundance for Manuella Lake in 2019.  The gill netted Smallmouth Bass were 7.5 to 18.8 inches long averaging 15.0 inches.  The length distribution table indicated inconsistent recruitment, but multiple year classes were present.  Manuella Lake is known to anglers as one of the better Smallmouth Bass lakes in Meeker County. <br> \n <br> \nTrap nets sampled low numbers (7) of Black Crappie in 2019 for a catch rate of 0.8/net, which was below the normal range for this lake type.  The 2014 TN catch rate was similar at 0.1/net.  The 2016 LMP's long range goal (maintain presence) was met.  Trap net catch rates from 1957 to 2019 (n=11) were mostly low, ranging from 0.0 to 5.8/net averaging 1.4/net.  In 2019, trap netted Black Crappie were 4.1 to 6.1 inches long averaging 5.2 inches. Trap netting was very unproductive in 2019; it appears most Black Crappie are spending their time offshore in August, which led to better sampling in the gill nets. Gill nets sampled moderate to high numbers (84) of Black Crappie for a catch rate of 14.0/net, which was within the normal range for this lake type, and the highest GN catch ever measured at Manuella.  Black Crappie were the most abundant fish sampled in the 2019 gill nets.  Historic GN catch rates from 1957 to 2019 (n=12) were variable, ranging from 0.3 to 14.0/net averaging 3.5/net.  In 2019, the gill netted Black Crappie were 4.7 to 11.6 inches long, averaging 7.3 inches.  Approximately 30% of the GN catch was 10 inches or longer, indicating that a quality crappie population was present.  The length distribution tables indicated inconsistent recruitment for Black Crappie.  The 2019 crappie population looked as good as it's ever been at Manuella.  Try fishing off the deep weed edges in late-summer to find the bigger crappie. <br> \n <br> \nTrap nets sampled moderate to high numbers of Bluegill (230) for a catch rate of 28.8/net which was within the normal range for this type of lake.  Bluegill were the most abundant fish sampled in 2019 TN's.  The 2014 TN catch rate was similar at 22.3/net.  The 2015 LMP's Bluegill long range goal (7.5 to 62.5) was met.  Historic catch rates from 1957 to 2019 (n=11) were mostly similar, ranging from 14.0 to 79.3/net, averaging 25.4/net.  In 2019, trap netted Bluegill were 2.4 to 6.8 inches long averaging 4.3 inches.  Only 2% of the TN sample was 6 inches or longer, indicating a size structure dominated by small fish.  The TN length frequency distribution indicated that multiple year classes were present.  Gill nets sampled 22 fish that were 7 inches or longer and 4 fish that were 8 inches or longer, indicating that quality sized Bluegill were present at Manuella.  Data showed that trap nets did a poor job of sampling larger Bluegill in 2019.  Bluegill anglers will get plenty of action from small fish in the shallows but by mid-summer seek deeper water to find the big sunnies.  Manuella has an abundant and diverse aquatic plant community, providing ideal habitat for Bluegill. <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled low numbers of Walleye (18) for a catch rate of 3.0/net, which was within the normal range for this type of lake.  The 2015 LMP's long range goal for Walleye (>2.8/net) was met.  The 2015 GN catch rate was similar (3.7/net) to the 2019 catch.  Catch rates from 1957 to 2019 (n=12), under various stocking regimes, were mostly low to moderate, ranging from 2.8 to 23.8/net averaging 6.2.   A total of 9 out of 12 Walleye GN catch rates were within the normal range for this lake type.  In 2019, gill netted Walleye were 13.9 to 22.4 inches long averaging 19.4 inches.  Gill netted Walleye were estimated to be age-2 to age-12 with five year classes present, indicating inconsistent recruitment.  None of the year classes were ranked as strong.  The 2015 year class was considered to be moderate in size and was the largest year class sampled in 2019.  The other four year classes were considered weak.  Growth was considered fast for age-4 fish when to compared to statewide averages.  In 2019, non-stocked years accounted for 17% of the GN aged (n=3) Walleye, indicating that natural reproduction was occurring somewhere within the Washington, Stella, and Manuella chain of lakes.  Two studies have shown that Walleye are moving from lake to lake within the Washington, Stella, and Manuella chain of lakes.  At Manuella, the contribution from natural reproduction during Walleye fry stocked years remained unknown, due to the inability to differentiate the two groups of fish.  Gill net catch rates from 1999 to 2019 (n=6), during the 1993 stocking regime (114,000 fry 1 of 2 years), ranged from 2.8 to 7.8/net averaging 4.7/GN, indicating a moderately successful stocking strategy.  The stocking regime was cut in half in 2019 (from 1,000 fry per acre under 15 feet to 500 fry; 57,000 fry every other year), based on recent research that showed lower stocking rates often work as well or better than higher rates. The strain stocked into Manuella and other lakes in the Crow River watershed was also switched to a local strain collected and hatched at the New London state fish hatchery. Preliminary evaluations of local strains in southern Minnesota show promise in better fry survival, but these reports are not final. Walleye anglers were typically rewarded with nice sized fish at Manuella, but they can be difficult to find.   <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled low numbers of Yellow Perch (1) for a catch rate of 0.2/net, which was below the normal range for this type of lake.  Yellow Perch have not been sampled in high numbers at Manuella since 1978 (80.5/net), and only 1 of 9 GN catch rates (5.2/GN in 1993), since 1978, have been within the lake type normal range, indicating low abundance most years.  Historic perch GN catch rates from 1957 to 2019 (n=12) were variable ranging from 0.0 to 80.5/net averaging 10.7/net.  In 2019, the gill netted Yellow Perch was 6.0 inches long. Ongoing research in Minnesota on Yellow Perch is showing that perch are not growing to sizes where they can be effectively sampled in nets. In essence, the fish are still present but go undetected because of their small size. Netting data indicated that perch seldom reach an acceptable size to be targeted by anglers at this lake.   <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled moderate numbers (47) of Yellow Bullhead for a catch rate of 7.8/net, which was above the normal range for this lake type.   Historic GN catch rates from 1957 to 2019 (n=12) were variable, ranging from 0.0 to 12.1/net averaging 3.9/net.  In 2019, Yellow Bullhead were 6.5 to 15.0 inches long averaging 11.3 inches.  Approximately 40% of the GN sample was 12 inches or longer, indicating that a quality population was present.  Yellow Bullhead were typically more abundant (7.8/GN) than black bullhead (0.2/GN in 2019) in lakes with better water quality, such as Manuella.  Bullhead anglers should be able to catch a few big yellow bellies at Manuella by soaking a night crawler under a bobber. <br> \n      <br> \nTrap nets sampled low numbers of Common Carp (1) for a catch rate of 0.1/net, which was below the normal range for this lake type.  The trap netted Common Carp was 26.2 inches long.  Gill nets failed to sample any Common Carp for a catch rate of 0.0/net, which was also below the lake's normal range, and tied catch rates in 1983, 1993, 1999, and 2014 for the lowest on record.  Historic GN catch rates from 1957 to 2019 (n=12) were mostly low, ranging from 0.0 to 5.0/net averaging 1.1/GN, indicating that the relative abundance of Common Carp was typically low at Manuella.     <br> \n <br> \nAdditional fishes sampled in the standard gear included; Black Bullhead, Bowfin, Brown Bullhead, Green Sunfish, Hybrid Sunfish, Pumpkinseed Sunfish, and White Sucker.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Gill nets, trap nets and shoreline seining were used to sample the Manuella Lake fish population in 2004.  Aquatic plant sampling and water quality monitoring were also conducted.  A total of 28 aquatic plant species were sampled growing to a maximum depth of 10 feet.  By mid-August, dissolved oxygen levels below 21 feet were not sufficient for most fish species.  The lakes watershed was dominated by agricultural row crops and the lakeshore is dominated by homes.  Some shore fishing is available at the county park on the south end of the lake.Moderate numbers (2.8/net) of walleye were gill netted in 2004.  This was down from the 2001 catch rate (7.7/net).  Walleye were 8.4-20.6 inches long averaging 13.3 inches.  Walleye fry are stocked every-other-year at Manuella Lake.  Naturally reproduced walleye accounted for at least 18% of the gill net sample.  Low numbers (1.8/net) of northern pike were gill netted this year, while the catch rate in 2001 (4.0/net) was slightly higher.  Northern pike were 18.5-29.5 inches long averging 22.9 inches.  Low numbers of yellow perch were sampled, but this is typical on Manuella Lake.  Good numbers (2.8/net) of smallmouth bass were gill netted in 2004, but the catch was down considerably from the 2001 netting (13.3/net).  Smallmouth bass were 5.9-17.2 inches long averaging 11.8 inches.  Manuella is one-of-three lakes in Meeker County with a fishable population of smallmouth bass.  Moderate numbers of bluegill were trap netted (15.3/net) in 2004.  The last trap netting (1999) produced a catch rate of 29.2/net.  Bluegill were 2.8-7.4 inches long averaging 5.2 inches.  Approximately 22% of the sample was 6 inches or greater and 4% were 7 inches or longer.  Low numbers (0.5/net) of black crappie were gill netted, but this was often the case at Manuella.  The 2001 catch was 3.7/net.  Black crappie were 4.6-10.6 inches long.  Spring night-time electrofishing (EF) for bass produced 27 largemouth bass ranging in size from 4.5-15.2 inches.  Largemouth averaged 10.6 inches.  The last EF assessment (2002) produced 51 largemouth.  Spring electrofishing doesn't sample smallmouth bass well on Manuella, and only 2 smallmouth bass were captured this year.  Those fish were 7.8 & 11.7 inches long.  The 2004 black bullhead gill net catch rate (38.0) was the highest ever measured at Manuella Lake, indicating moderate numbers to be present.  In past nettings the black bullhead catch rates have always been low.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A full resurvey was conducted at Manuella Lake in Meeker County in 2014.  Manuella Lake is a class 24 lake managed for Smallmouth Bass, Largemouth Bass, Northern Pike, Black Crappie, Bluegill, and Walleye.  <br> \n <br> \nThe Manuella Lake watershed (11,394 acres) was highly disturbed and dominated (77%) by row crop agriculture.  The shoreline was heavily developed with 102 homes counted within the riparian zone and residential land use accounting for 65% of the shoreline.  The watershed to lake ratio was 33:1.  The maximum depth at which aquatic vegetation was sampled was 16 feet in mid-July.  A total of 26 species were sampled, of which Clasping-leaf Pondweed, Eurasian Water Milfoil, Muskgrass, and Water Celery were most common.  Dissolved oxygen concentrations dropped below 2 ppm at a depth of 18 feet, so don't fish too deep in the summer.  The secchi disk reading was 4.3 feet in mid-August, indicating fair to moderate clarity.  The most common shoalwater substrates were sand and silt. <br> \n <br> \nA total of 22 Walleyes were sampled with gill nets for a catch rate of 3.7/net, which was within the normal range for a lake of this class.  The catch rate in 2008 was 3.2/net and historically (n=11) catch rates have varied from 2.8/net in 2004 to 23.0/net in 1957 with an average of 6.5/net.  Lengths ranged from 9.7 to 25.9 inches with an average of 15.6 inches, indicating a good size range of catchable fish.  A total of 6 Walleyes ranging from 7.1 to 27.1 inches were sampled with trap nets for a catch rate of 0.7/net.  Walleyes from both gears ranged from age-0 to age-12 with 9 year-classes present.  Growth was fast.  Approximately 88% of the aged Walleyes were from stocked years, but it is unknown what portion of that 88% was from natural reproduction, stocking or some combination of both.  The current stocking regime began in 1993 and calls for 1,000 fry/littoral acre (acres less than 15 feet deep) to be stocked on odd number years.   <br> \n <br> \nA total of 37 Northern Pike were sampled with gill nets for a catch rate of 6.2/net, which was within the normal range for a lake of this type.  The catch rate in 2008 was 6.0/net and historically (n=11) catch rates have varied from 1.4/net in 1988 to 12.0/net in 1983 with an average of 4.7.  Lengths ranged from 8.9 to 30.1 inches with an average of 22.0 inches.  Approximately 92% of the gill net catch was 20 inches or longer, indicating a size structure with many quality fish but few large individuals.  An additional two northern pike ranging from 10.6 to 28.5 inches long were sampled with trap nets.  Northern Pike from both gears ranged from age-0 to age-4 with 5 year-classes present.  Age-3 fish accounted for 55% of the aged sampled.  Growth was fast.   <br> \n <br> \nSmallmouth Bass numbers remained high in Manuella Lake with a total of 37 fish sampled with gill nets for a catch rate of 6.2/net, which was well above the normal range for this lake class.  Since 1978 (n=9), catch rates have ranged from 2.7/net in 1983 and 1988 to 13.3/net in 2001 with an average catch rate of 6.7/net.  Lengths ranged from 8.9 to 18.7 inches with an average of 14.9 inches.  Approximately 89% of the gill net sample was 12 inches or longer, indicating a population with many nice sized fish.  A total of 13 Smallmouth Bass ranging from 5.0 to 7.6 inches were sampled with trap nets for a catch rate of 1.4/net.  Smallmouth Bass from both gears ranged from age-1 to age-7 with 7 year-classes present.  Growth was fast.  Manuella Lake continues to offer Hutchinson Area anglers a rare opportunity for quality Smallmouth Bass fishing. <br> \n <br> \nA total of 201 Bluegills were sampled in trap nets for a catch rate of 22.3/net, which was within the normal range for this lake class.  Since 1978 (n=8), Bluegill catch rates have ranged from 14.0/net in 1978 to 29.2/net in 1999 with an average catch rate of 19.6/net.  Lengths ranged from 2.9 to 7.4 inches with an average length of 4.6 inches. Approximately 87% of the trap net catch was less than 6 inches in length, indicating a population dominated by fish too small to interest anglers.  An additional 6 Bluegills ranging from 3.5 to 5.6 inches were sampled with gill nets.  Bluegills were not aged.  Overall, the Bluegill population in 2014 resembles the ones sampled in 2004 and 2008 with moderate abundance and dominated by smaller fish.   <br> \n <br> \nJust one 11.1 inch Black Crappie was sampled with trap nets for a catch rate of 0.1/net, which was well below the normal range for this lake class.  Historically (n=10), Black Crappie catch rates have ranged from 0.0/net in 2004 to 5.8/net in 1988 with an average catch rate of 1.4/net.  An additional 3 Black Crappies ranging from 8.5 to 13.7 inches were sampled with gill nets.   <br> \n <br> \nA total of 3 Largemouth Bass ranging from 6.0 to 14.5 inches were sampled with gill and trap nets.  Spring night-time electrofishing was planned in 2014 but was not completed due to time constraints.   <br> \n <br> \nNo Yellow Perch were sampled with gill nets and only 1 was sampled with trap nets. Since 1983 (n=8), Yellow Perch numbers have remained low, averaging just 0.9/gill net. <br> \n <br> \nCommon Carp and Black Bullhead numbers remain low in Manuella Lake and neither species were sampled with gill nets in 2014.  <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled in 2014 include; Bowfin, Green Sunfish, Hybrid Sunfish (Lepomis spp.), Pumpkinseed Sunfish, White Sucker, and Yellow Bullhead. <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of the nearshore fish community in Manuella Lake was conducted by Fisheries Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program Staff starting June 18, 2018. Ten sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 15-foot or 50-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at all ten sites with one site sampled from the boat. Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample nine sites and a 15-foot seine was used at one site. Nearshore sampling captured 19 native species of fish including four species that are intolerant of disturbance (Banded Killifish, Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, and Smallmouth Bass) and two species that are tolerant of disturbance (Fathead Minnow and Green Sunfish).  <br> \n <br> \nData from this targeted nearshore survey is combined with trap net and gill net data from an August 2014 standard survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based Index of Biological Integrity (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment. The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. The FIBI score for Manuella Lake from this survey is near an impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes indicating that the lake may be vulnerable to future impairment. For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website. <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the North Fork Crow River Watershed assessment of surface waters process completed in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.</p>",

A total of 15 different species of fish were sampled, plus hybrid sunfish.  A county park with a swimming beach is present at Manuella Lake.  Manuella Lake is infested with Euraisian watermilfoil, an undesireable exotic plant. <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled 19 walleye for a catch rate of 3.2/net, which was within the normal range for this type of lake.  The 2004 catch rate was 2.8/net.  Walleye were 8.4 to 24.8 inches long averaging 12.6 inches.  Approximately 61% of the gill netted walleye were less than 11 inches in length.  Walleye were 1 to 9 years old with 8 year-classes present.  The 2007 year-class made up 74% of the gill net sample.  The latest stocking regime (1,000 fry/littoral acre) was initiated in 1993.   <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled 36 northern pike for a catch rate of 6.0/net, which was within the normal range for this type of lake.  The 2004 catch rate was 1.8/net.  Northern pike were 16.7 to 30.2 inches long averaging 21.0 inches.  Northern pike were 1 to 4 years old with 4 year-classes present.      <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled 3 yellow perch for a catch rate of 0.5 /net, which was below the normal range for this type of lake.  The 2004 catch rate was 0.0/net.  Catch rates have been low since the 1983 assessment.  Yellow perch were 6.3 to 6.5 inches long averaging 6.4 inches.     <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled 28 smallmouth bass for a catch rate of 4.7/net, which was above the normal range for this type of  lake.  The 2004 catch rate was 2.8/net.  Smallmouth bass were 5.9 to 18.5 inches long averaging 12.9 inches.  Spring night-time electrofishing sampled 3 smallmouth bass for a catch rate of 3.0/hr of electrofisher on-time.  The catch rate in 2004 was 2.0/hr.  Electrofished smallmouth bass were 9.0 to 11.6 inches long averaging 10.5 inches.  Smallmouth bass were 1 to 7 years old with 7 year-classes present.  Manuella is one of the best smallmouth bass lakes in the Meeker and McLeod County area. <br> \n <br> \nSpring night-time electrofishing sampled 32 largemouth bass for a catch rate of 32.0/hr of electrofisher on-time.  The catch rate in 2004 was similar at 27.0/hr.  Catch rates (n=8) from 1991 to 2008 ranged from 5.2 to 51.0/hr, averaging  27.6/hr.  Largemouth bass were 4.3 to 16.5 inches long averaging 10.1 inches.  Largemouth bass were 1 to 7 years old with 6 year-classes present.   <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled 2 carp for a catch rate of 0.3/net.  The 2004 catch rate was 0.8/net.  Carp were 23.4 to 25.6 inches long averaging 24.5 inches.  The trap net catch rate was also low (0.3/net).  Trap net catch rates have been low for the last 30 years.   <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled 1 black bullhead for a catch rate of 0.2/net, which was below the normal range for this type of lake.  The 2004 catch rate was 38.0/net.  The black bullhead was 12.3 inches long.  The trap net catch rate was 0.0/net.  Trap nets also sampled 2 yellow bullhead.  Yellow bullhead were 9.7 to 12.9 inches long averaging 11.3 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nTrap nets sampled 15 black crappie for a catch rate of 1.7/net, which was below the normal range for this type of  lake.  The 2004 catch rate was 0.0/net.  Black crappie were 4.7 to 8.0 inches long averaging 6.0 inches.  Gill nets sampled 29 black crappie for a catch rate of 4.8/net.  Gill netted black crappie were 4.5 to 11.3 inches long averaging 6.9 inches.  The 2004 gill net catch rate was 0.5/net.  <br> \n <br> \nTrap nets sampled 143 bluegill for a catch rate of 15.9/net, which was within the normal range for this type of lake.  The 2004 catch rate was similar at 15.3/net.  Bluegill were 3.0 to 7.4 inches long averaging 4.3 inches.  Only 3 of the trap netted fish were at least 7 inches in length.   <br> \n <br> \nGood fishing, for a variety of species, can be found at Manuella Lake.  Water clarity, in the winter, is usually good enough for darkhouse spearing.</p>",

All rough fish species are present only at very low levels and do not appear to thrive here.  Gamefish species were captured at a rate that exceeds the local average catch rate.  Northern pike catch rate equals 7.5/gillnet.  These fish average approximately twenty inches in length.  Small and largemouth bass are present at a rate of 12.5 and 6.25/trapnet, respectively.  Growth of smallmouth bass is considered good.  Growth of sunfish and crappies is average.  Bluegill age VI equal 6.4 inches in length.  Shoreline seining reveals that all species had natural reproduction, and yellow perch and minnow are present in sufficient numbers to provide forage for predators.</p>",

It has a maximum depth of 51 feet, a median depth of 22 feet, and 40 percent is shallower than 15 feet.  A thermocline is present during the summer months.  No oxygen is evident below the thermocline. <br> \n <br> \nThe lake as indicated by the 1957 test netting contains high population levels of walleyes and carp; normal levels of perch, bluegills, bullheads, and bass; and low levels of northern pike, black crappies and pumpkinseeds.  The growth rate appears fast on northern pike, and black crappies; normal for walleyes, bass and pumpkinseeds; and slow for bluegills.  Natural reproduction as indicated by shoreline seining in 1957 was good for largemouth bass and bluegills. <br> \nThe above information indicates the lake is best described as a bass-panfish-walleye lake and management should be concentrated on northern pike.  All other fishes can apparently sustain themselves at moderate to high levels with without stocking.</p>",

Electrofishing sampled 0 YWAE for a catch rate of 0.0/hour, which was the lowest ever observed during a fry stocked year.  The latest Walleye stocking regime (57,000 fry every other year) began in 2019.  Historic fall electrofishing catch rates from 1993 to 2019 (n=20) ranged from 0.0 to 69.5/hour with an average of 18.4.  Catch rates during fry stocked years (n=10) ranged from 0.0 to 49.0/hour with an average of 17.8.  Catch rates during non-stocked years (n=10) ranged from 0.0 to 69.5/hour with an average of 19.0.  Similar average catch rates, for YWAE, indicated that there was little difference in relative abundance when comparing stocked years to non-stocked years at Manuella Lake.  The YRLWAE catch rate was also 0.0/hour in 2019.  Sampling indicated that neither the Walleye fry stocking nor natural reproduction produced a strong year class at Manuella in 2019.</p>",
