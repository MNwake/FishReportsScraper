The Walleye population has continued to increase and is currently high compared to similar types of lakes. Average size of Walleye sampled in 1993 was 15.1\" with 22% of the fish exceeding 20\". Walleye up to 24\" were observed. The population is being maintained entirely through natural reproduction.     Harris Lake currently supports a fair population of Shoepac strain Muskellunge with fish in the 25\"-28\" range the most common size. Few Muskellunge in excess of 36\" have ever been sampled in DNR test nets and with a minimum size limit of 40\" the fishery consists largely of catch and release.     Largemouth Bass are not adequately sampled by DNR test nets however they are believed to be present in good numbers evidenced by anglers reports.</p>",

The lake lies in the Superior National Forest and is completely surrounded by federal forest land. A public access road comes from State Highway #1 to the lake. The maximum depth of Harris Lake is 13 feet; there are four inlets and an outlet. The land surrounding the lake is forest with some shoreline marshes. Shoal water soils are mostly ledge rock, boulder or muck, but some sand and sandy-muck are also present.At the time of the survey, there was one campsite present on the lake. Sufficient dissolved oxygen for fish life was present to a depth of 8 or 9 feet. Aquatic vegetation was moderately abundant in depths to 8 feet, mainly in bays and protected areas. Test netting catches of White Sucker, Yellow Perch and Black Crappie were high. Bluegill, Pumpkinseed, hybrid sunfish and Largemouth Bass were also taken, but in lesser numbers. Many of the panfish taken were of sizes desirable to anglers.Spawning facilities are rated \"fair\" for Largemouth Bass and centrarchid panfish, \"good\" to \"excellent\" for Northern Pike and \"poor\" for Walleye, Smallmouth Bass and trout.Harris Lake apparently receives moderate fishing pressure and has produced good panfish and Largemouth Bass catches at times in the past.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Harris Lake is 122 acres with a maximum depth of about 15 feet in each of the lake basins which are connected by a shallow channel.  Much of the shoreline is ledge rock and boulder, the water is brown and bog-stained with a Secchi disk reading of 3.5 feet.  The lake is one mile from State Highway 1 on a very rough logging road, a high clearance four-wheeled drive vehicle is recommended for travel on this route.  The carry-in access is suitable for canoes and small boats which must be carried approximately 100 feet over large boulders to the lake.  Parking is limited to about three vehicles near the lake; there is very little room to turn around.  There are two user developed campsites on the eastern basin of Harris Lake. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye are the primary management species in Harris Lake.  Walleye were first sampled in Harris Lake in a 1979 lake survey the walleye likely had migrated to Harris Lake from Little Spring Lake which was used as a walleye rearing pond in 1977 and 1978.  The walleye population in Harris Lake was well above average in 2013 compared to lakes with similar characteristics.  The average size was 14.4 inches (1.1 pound) the largest walleye sampled was 27.8 inches (7.2 pounds).  Natural reproduction maintains the walleye population in Harris Lake and like most natural lakes there are fluctuations in year-class strength.  Scale ageing has shown that 2009-2011 were very strong year-classes and should provide good walleye fishing; there is presently no need to stock walleye in this lake. <br> \n <br> \nMuskellunge were introduced in Harris Lake in 1965 and stocked again in1969; there had been few northern pike in the lake. The Shoepack strain of muskellunge present in Harris Lake generally does not attain lengths greater than 40 inches and it is unlikely an angler will catch one over the present legal harvest length of 48 inches.  The muskellunge population was below average in 2013 compared to lakes with similar characteristics.  The average size was 27.2 inches (3.7 pounds) the largest muskellunge was 32.5 inches (6.3 pounds).  Natural reproduction appears to be fairly consistent for muskellunge with six consecutive year-classes represented in the aged sample.  Harris Lake is no longer on the designated muskellunge lake list; however, all regulations pertaining to the angling and harvest of muskellunge statewide apply to this lake. <br> \n <br> \nThe population assessment in 2013 was the first investigation that did not sample black crappie in any gear since the initial lake information was collected in 1963.  The black crappie numbers have fallen off in recent investigations; it is possible this is the result of low reproductive success.  It is likely that black crappies are present in Harris Lake in low numbers; however, a few strong year-classes are needed to re-establish a good fishable population. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill numbers were again below average for the lake class, but within the range sampled in the previous two investigations in Harris Lake.  The average length was about 4 inches; the largest bluegill was 4.4 inches in the 2013 investigation.  Bluegills in northeastern Minnesota lakes generally have limited reproductive success/survival, with only occasionally strong year-classes produced.  The low numbers of small bluegills sampled in 2013 probably would not interest anglers. <br> \n  <br> \nAs with all the forage species in Harris Lake the yellow perch numbers were below average and the size was small.  The average length was 6.42 inches; the largest yellow perch was 8 inches.  Pumpkinseed sunfish, hybrid sunfish, white sucker and golden shiner were also sampled in low numbers.   <br> \n</p>",

It does appear however that since Walleye have become established the abundance of Black Crappie and Yellow Perch has declined.  Walleye natural reproduction is occurring and is sustaining a population.  Muskellunge have been reproducing sucessfully for a number of years with strong year classes of Age IV, V, and VI year old fish.  However results from the 1989 assessment indicate little recruitment of Age II and III year old Muskellunge.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Harris Lake is in the Superior National Forest approximately 13 miles southeast of Ely, MN.  The lake has a maximum depth of 15 feet and has very dark (bog stained) water.  The access road is brushy and very rough, it is recommended for high-clearance vehicles only.  The access is limited to carry-down of small boats and canoes.     Fish collected in DNR test nets in 1999 were: black crappie, muskellunge, walleye, yellow perch, largemouth bass, bluegill, pumpkinseed sunfish and white sucker.     Black crappie were sampled in average numbers compared to other lakes in this lake class.  They averaged 7.7 inches (0.32 pound) and ranged up to 11.5 inches but fish over 10.0 inches are not abundant.     Muskellunge were introduced in the lake in the 1960's and have been maintaining a population through natural reproduction since.  An average number of muskellunge were captured with fish up to 29.8 inches (4.9 pounds) taken.  The average size was 26.0 inches (3.9 pounds).  The muskellunge in Harris Lake are from the Shoepack strain which are not known for attaining trophy size and are no longer stocked in the state.  In all the surveys conducted on the lake the largest muskellunge ever captured was 38.5 inches.  If an anglers' intent is to catch a trophy size muskie they would be wise to concentrate their efforts on a different lake.     Walleye were stocked in the lake once in the 1980's but have not been stocked since.  Results from the 1999 survey indicates the lake contains an average walleye population which is maintained through natural reproduction.  The walleye collected ranged from 9.8 inches to 24.9 inches (6.0 pounds) with approximately 25% of them in the 20 inch to 24 inch range, however fish in the 14 inch to 18 inch range were scarce.     Bluegill are present in average numbers however there were no fish taken in the survey that anglers would consider large enough to keep.  The largest bluegill collected was only 5 inches.     Yellow perch are present in average numbers, but they are small and probably not of interest to anglers.  The largest yellow perch collected in the survey was 8.8 inches and most were less than 8 inches.     Only one largemouth bass (9.1 inches) was captured during the survey period, however this species is difficult to capture in nets and therefore netting is not a reliable indicator of largemouth bass abundance.  Occasionally reports of anglers catching some quality size largemouth bass surface.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Harris Lake is one mile from a paved road on a very rough logging road, where four wheel drive and high ground clearance is advised.  The access is suitable for small boats and canoes, which must be carried across approximately 100 feet of large boulders.Test nets sampled walleye, muskellunge, black crappie, bluegill, pumpkinseed sunfish, yellow perch, white sucker and golden shiner during the 2004 assessment.Walleye were sampled in average numbers and averaged about 1.3 lb/fish.  Walleye from 9 to 26.1 inches (6.4 pounds) were collected, with approximately 22% of the walleye larger than 20 inches.  The walleye population is sustained by natural reproduction.  The last walleye stocking was in 1982.Muskellunge were sampled in average numbers and averaged 4.3 lb/fish.  The fish were from 22.3 to 30.3 inches in length, with fish in the 24 to 28 inch range the most common.  The muskellunge in Harris Lake are Shoepack strain, which are not known to attain trophy size.  Legal size (40 inch) fish are rare in this lake.  Harris Lake was removed from the designated muskellunge lake list in 2004.  That means northern pike, white sucker and any other fish legal to spear can be taken by this method.  Muskellunge cannot be speared, must be at least 40 inches in length, and caught angling in the open season to legally possess.Black crappie and bluegill are present , but not in great abundance.  Black crappie were sampled in below average numbers, with only one quality size fish (11.7 inches) sampled.  Bluegill were sampled in average numbers; however, the size was small with all bluegill measuring less than 6.5 inches.Largemouth bass are present in Harris Lake; however, none were taken in the 2004 assessment.  Largemouth bass are \"net shy\" and difficult to sample quantitatively with standard lake survey nets.  This species is best sampled with electrofishing equipment; however, it is not feasible to get this heavy equipment to the lake.  Largemouth bass up to 20 inches have been sampled in past assessments and occasionally reports are received of some quality size fish being caught by anglers.Yellow perch were sampled in relatively low numbers and most appeared to be too small to interest anglers.  The largest yellow perch sampled in 2004 was 7.7 inches in length.</p>",
