                "narrative": "<p>Johnson Lake (Grant Lake) is a 56-acre lake with a maximum depth of 70 feet located three miles northeast of the town of Clearbrook in northern Clearwater County.  Johnson Lake is managed primarily for walleye, with northern pike, yellow perch and pumpkinseed managed as secondary species.  Fish habitat is marginal in Johnson Lake.  Water less than fifteen feet in depth is limited, and much of the water column becomes devoid of oxygen during summer months.  Johnson Lake also has a history of winterkill events, although none have occurred recently.  Water quality measurements taken in July of 2013 showed adequate oxygen levels for fish down to a depth of 14 feet and a Secchi disc reading of 6.5 feet, with a heavy algal bloom noted.   Johnson Lake is stocked with walleye fingerlings on alternate years, which has provided some walleye fishing opportunity in an area with relatively few fishing lakes.The 2013 walleye catch rate of 3 fish per gill net (3/GN) is near the upper end of the normal range for Lake Class 28 lakes.  Walleye ranged in length from 16.5 inches to 24.5 inches in length, with an average size of 19.1 inches and 2.54 lbs.  Trap nets captured good numbers of smaller walleye (12.4 inch average size) indicating the success of recent stockings.  A total of seven year classes of walleye were identified in the assessment.  The northern pike catch rate of 11/GN was above the normal range (2.75/GN to 8.67/GN) for Lake Class 28 lakes.  Pike up to 27.7 inches in length were captured, with an average size of 21.3 inches in length and 2.3 lbs.  Yellow perch were fairly abundant in the assessment (21.3/GN) but most perch captured were less than 7 inches in length.  Trap nets sampled low numbers of bluegill (5.11/TN).  Bluegill were smaller than most anglers prefer, with an average length of 5.5 inches.  Other species captured in the 2013 assessment were black bullhead, white sucker, rock bass, and pumpkinseed.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Johnson Lake (also known as Grant Lake) is a 63-acre, undeveloped natural lake located 8 miles northeast of Clearbrook in northern Clearwater County. Johnson has an average water clarity of 7 feet and a maximum depth of 70 feet. Johnson Lake has multiple small inlets and one outlet connecting to the Clearwater River. A public access is located on county road 15, near the outlet on the northeastern shore. <br> \n <br> \nA standard survey was completed on Johnson Lake in 2023 to assess the fish community. Gamefish species targeted by anglers in this lake include Walleye, Northern Pike, Bluegill, Pumpkinseed, and Yellow Perch. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye lengths ranged from 15 to 23 inches and averaged 19 inches. Walleye abundance decreased from 2013 and was below the lake's historical average, but still within the typical range for lakes with similar morphological characteristics. The Walleye population is sustained by stocking on an alternate year rotation. Two year classes were captured, likely originating from the 2018 and 2020 stocking events. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike abundance was average for the lake and within the typical range for similar lakes in Minnesota. Northern Pike ranged from 16 to 26 inches and averaged 21 inches. Fifty-three percent of the Northern Pike captured in gill nets were larger than 22 inches, but only six percent were over 26 inches. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill abundance remains low and below the normal range for this lake type. Bluegill lengths averaged 6 inches. Pumpkinseed abundance was above average, but fish were small with lengths ranging from 3 to 6 inches. Four Largemouth Bass were captured and averaged 12 inches. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch is considered an important forage species for large predators like Walleye, Northern Pike, and Largemouth Bass. Yellow Perch abundance was above average and lengths ranged from 5 to 9 inches. Other species sampled during the survey included Black Bullhead and White Sucker. <br> \n <br> \nCurrently no aquatic invasive species (AIS) have been found in Johnson Lake. AIS can be transferred by anglers and boats from infested to non-infested waterbodies. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants and animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the lake. Please follow the current AIS regulations to avoid spreading to other lakes. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Johnson Lake is a 56-acre lake with a maximum depth of 70 feet.  It is located three miles northeast of Clearbrook in northern Clearwater County.  There is a county public access on the northeast end of the lake off of county road 15.  The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different lake classes based on physical and chemical characteristics.  Johnson Lake is one of the numerous lakes in Clearwater County in lake class 28.  Typically lakes in this class are small, regular shaped and are clear.  Johnson Lake is managed for walleye, yellow perch and pumpkinseed sunfish.  Partial fish kills have occurred in the past with the most recent one occurring in the winter of 1995-96.  Because of the steep drop offs, areas less than 15 feet deep and a shallow thermocline (lower limits of fish habitat) in the summer, there appears to be limited suitable fish habitat.Although walleye had been stocked in five of the past ten years, only one was sampled in the 2002 assessment.  In the last survey in 1988, walleye were very abundant.  It is uncertain why abundance has dropped so dramatically.  There is no indication that natural reproduction is contributing walleye to the fishery.Northern pike abundance in 2002 was also much lower than what was found in 1988.  Northern pike sampled were generally small with lengths ranging from 13 to 21 inches.  Five of the seven pike sampled were from 2001 year class.Yellow perch abundance was above what you would typically find in lake class 28 lakes.  Perch ranged in length from 4 to 11 inches.  Most perch found were small and are excellent food fish for predator fish.  The current low abundance of major predator species may be resulting in increased perch abundance.Pumpkinseed sunfish was the most abundant member of the sunfish family found in Johnson Lake.  Their abundance was higher than what you would typically find in other lake class 28 lakes.  No pumpkinseed more than six inches was sampled.</p>",

In early June of 2018, the Bemidji Fisheries Office was contacted by local anglers and alerted that a winterkill may have occurred.  This assessment was done as a follow up to those reports. <br> \n <br> \nIn late August of 2018, an electrofishing survey was conducted to determine the extent of winterkill.  During nearly 30 minutes of sampling effort, 54 fish comprised of 8 species were captured, measured, and released.  The most abundant species were Yellow Perch and Black Bullhead.  Perch up to 7.9 inches were captured.  The largest fish was an 8.5 inch Brown Bullhead.  All fish sampled were species that tend to be more tolerant of low dissolved oxygen conditions.  Species not sampled that were present in previous assessments were Bluegill, Pumpkinseed, Walleye and Northern Pike. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye fingerlings were stocked about a month after the assessment and are expected to survive and grow well due to the lack of competition and abundance of prey species.  Bluegill will likely be reintroduced in the spring of 2019.  Northern pike are likely still present since they are also quite tolerant of low dissolved oxygen, but may not have been vulnerable to electrofishing at that time of year.   <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Johnson Lake, also known as Grant Lake, is in fisheries lake class 28.  These are a group of lakes with regular shorelines and hard, clear water.  Most Bemidji area fisheries management lakes in this class are in Clearwater County, and the list includes Lone, Lomond, Walker Brook, Deep, First, Second, Falk and Peterson.  The latest lake management plan written in 1990 listed walleye as the primary management species and northern pike, bluegill and largemouth bass as secondary species.  Dissolved oxygen is monitored during severe winters for oxygen depletion.  Partial fish kills have occurred during past winters with the latest during the winter of 1995-96.  Steep drop offs with a small littoral area and a shallow thermocline (12'-15') in the summer limits the availability of good fish habitat.    The walleye population is dependent on stocking.  Walleye captured in all assessments have been aged to years of stocking.  This survey had walleye abundance higher than any previous survey and above the abundance for most lakes in this class.  Walleye captured during the current assessment were from two year classes, 1992 and 1996.  Walleye from the 1992 year class were 24\" to 26\" in length, and the 1996 year class ranged from 13\" to 17\" long.  These walleye tend to grow faster than the statewide average.    Northern pike abundance is also higher than previous surveys but near average abundance for this lake class.  Eighty-five percent of the northern pike captured were less than 24\" in length with the largest 33\" (11 lbs.).    Bluegill abundance has always been lower than similar class 28 lakes.  The bluegills captured in this assessment were in the 6\" range.  Bluegill brood stock was reintroduced in 1992 after a winterkill, but the population has since been reduced most likely by two more partial kills and competition with large numbers of black bullheads.  Panfish anglers will have better luck with pumpkinseed sunfish.  Their numbers were at an all time high, but they were not very large.  Average length was 4.5\", and maximum length was 6.5\".      Black bullhead abundance was higher than other lakes in this class but considerably lower than previous assessments.  Bullheads are small with few fish over 8\".  They probably are not acceptable to most anglers.    Yellow perch abundance is also at an all time high.  There are enough perch over 8\" to be of interest to anglers.  The smaller yellow perch provide an excellent forage base for northern pike and walleye.      Half of the northen pike and walleyes and 25% of the yellow perch had neascus and/or yellow grub.  These parasites, though unsightly in the fillets, are not harmful to humans.    With the exception of walleye, which are maintained by stocking, the populations of the other species present are greatly affected by winter oxygen levels.  Although the extent of winterkill is usually not severe enough to totally eliminate a species, it can substantially reduce their numbers.  Species less tolerant of low oxygen levels, like bluegill, tend to be most affected.  Other more tolerant species, such as bullheads, take advantage of a reduced population and quickly fill in the void by improved reproductive success and accelerated growth.  The faster than average growth of stocked walleye into this environment may be another indication of a species reacting to a partially vacated habitat.</p>",
