This abandoned iron ore mine has typically steep shores with flooded trees most common on the shallower east end.  <br> \n <br> \nRainbow and brook trout yearlings are stocked annually in equal amounts that total over 4,000 fish. In 2015, 1,050 brown trout yearlings were also stocked. Anglers unfamiliar with fishing on designated stream trout lakes should refer to the statewide regulations specifically for these lakes. There is a concrete boat ramp with an adjacent fishing pier for public access located on the north side. <br> \n <br> \nIn 2015, a total of 10 trap nets were used to sample the fish community. Fish populations were dominated by rock bass and bluegill. Seven additional species were sampled including largemouth bass, brook and rainbow trout, hybrid and green sunfish, smallmouth bass and white sucker. <br> \n <br> \nNineteen brook trout and four rainbow trout were sampled in 2015. Both species were sampled in numbers near their historical averages. Although the trapnet catch of brook trout was higher than for rainbow trout, this is likely due more to the method used for sampling than a true difference in abundance.  Most brook trout were about 8 inches long. The largest sampled was only 9 inches long. The average rainbow trout was a respectable 18 inches, much better than the historic average of 13 inches. The largest rainbow sampled was almost 21 inches long. The brown trout yearlings were stocked after the completion of the 2015 fisheries survey. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill numbers were much higher than average than in past surveys and compared to other similar area lakes. The average bluegill sampled was 6.2 inches long. Only about 5% of the bluegill were over 8 inches long. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass abundance was higher than average compared to similar lakes in the area but normal compared to past surveys on Miner's Pit. The average largemouth sampled was only 8 inches long and the longest largemouth sampled was 13 inches. <br> \n <br> \nRock bass numbers were much higher than average both for Miner's Pit and  compared to similar lakes in the area. The average rock bass sampled was 6 inches and the largest rock bass was nearly 9 inches long. <br> \n <br> \nA northern pike were sampled in Miner's Pit in 2012. It is illegal to transport live fish and introduce them into public waters. Northern pike predation can negatively impact stream trout in lakes.  <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Miners Lake was formed by the flooding of the open pit portion of a series of iron mines, mostly underground mines, after mining was discontinued in 1967.  Typical of abandoned hard rock mine pits, Miners Lake is deep and has very steep, rocky sides.  Following its abandonment, water levels rose due to the infiltration of groundwater and storm water runoff through culverts from the City of Ely.  Water levels were stabilized in the mid 1980's by the installation of an outlet culvert to Shagawa Lake.  This culvert has an internal drop to prevent the movement of fish from Shagawa Lake to Miners Lake.  The flooded basin of Miners Lake includes not only the formerly mined area, but also a shallow bay to the east that was not mined.Miners Lake has a surface area of 138 acres, maximum depth of 140 ft, littoral area of 20 percent, Secchi water clarity of 17 ft, and a Shoreline Development Factor of 2.12.  Miners Lake is in Ecological Lake Class 5, which consists of 64 lakes in northeast Minnesota that have soft (unmineralized) and clear water, but it is smaller, deeper, and has harder water (more dissolved minerals) than most Class 5 lakes.  Since Miners Lake is not a natural lake, was only recently colonized by fish, and is managed for stream trout, the lake class quartiles presented for comparison in this report should not be given much consideration.The water in Miners Lake is quite hard, with a total alkalinity of 145 ppm.  Dissolved minerals in the water include high levels of sulfates, calcium, magnesium, iron, and sodium.  However, levels of the primary nutrients for biological productivity, nitrogen and phosphorus, are quite low.  The sodium likely came from salt used for snow removal in the City of Ely; below 100 ft there is little mixing of water with shallower water because of a density gradient caused by high salt and hydrogen sulfide concentrations. In the summer there is adequate oxygen for trout (more than 5 ppm) to a depth of about 30 ft, and adequate oxygen for other fish species (more than 2 ppm) to 35-40 ft.This fish population assessment consisted of two standard gillnet sets, two standard trapnet sets, and two small mesh (1/4\" bar mesh) trapnet.  Four previous investigations, dating back to 1983, consisted of similar types and numbers of nets.  Stocking of brook trout and rainbow trout began in 1984.  This investigation was done in early May, while previous investigations were done in June or July.White sucker were the only fish captured in the gillnets in 2002.  Sucker were absent in the initial investigation in 1983.  High numbers (19/gillnet) of small (12\") sucker were caught in 1986, but their numbers have gradually declined while their sizes have increased.No trout were captured in the gillnets in 2002.  Previous investigations were conducted shortly after spring stocking of trout yearlings, while the 2002 investigation was done before spring yearling stocking.  Disregarding catches of just-stocked yearlings, previous investigations captured 3-4 trout/gillnet.  It is possible that the very early date of the netting in 2002 (May 1) somehow made the trout more difficult to capture.One trout (a 15\" rainbow) was captured in the trapnets in 2002.  This rainbow was likely a survivor from the spring, 2001 yearling stocking. Previous trapnettings had occasionally captured low numbers of rainbow trout, but never brook trout.Nets are very difficult to set in this lake because of the steep shorelines around much of the lake and submerged trees where the shoreline is not steep.  Based on angler reports the trout population in Miners Lake is much higher than indicated by this net assessment.  Based on measurements of angler caught fish, yearling rainbows stocked in spring 2002 at 8\"-10\" had grown to 13\"-15\" during the winter 2003 trout season, indicating good growth.  Some rainbows over 18\" were also caught by anglers.Rock bass, smallmouth bass, dace, and sticklebacks, all of which had been captured in at least one previous investigation, were not captured in 2002. Bluegill numbers in 2002 were lower than in previous investigations. The earlier date of the 2002 investigation may have been a factor in the low catches of fish this year.Rusty crayfish (six in 3/4\" trapnets, seven in 1/4\" trapnets) were captured in Miners Lake for the first time in 2002.  They were probably migrants from adjacent Shagawa Lake, where they are abundant.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Miner's Pit is located just N of Ely within its city limits. This abandoned open pit is managed as a designated stream trout lake. Most of the surrounding shoreline is steep with little development and flooded trees are common particularly on the E end. <br> \n <br> \nThere is a concrete planked boat ramp for public access on the N side of the lake. A fishing pier is located E of the access for anglers. Other shore fishing options are present around the lake. No campsites are present. Rainbow trout yearlings are stocked annually. Surplus stockings of adult rainbow and other stream trout species such as brown trout have also occurred in recent years. <br> \n <br> \nNine species of fish were sampled using trap nets during the 2018 targeted survey of Miner's Pit. Rock bass (39%) and bluegill (32%) dominated the catch. Several rainbow and brown trout were sampled. Good numbers of largemouth bass and hybrid sunfish were also observed. Rusty crayfish were incidentally sampled also. <br> \n <br> \nSeven rainbow trout and five brown trout were sampled in 2018. Rainbow and brown trout average lengths were 16.8 and 17.6 inches, respectively. The largest rainbow measured 20.1 inches while the largest brown trout recorded was 19.5 inches. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill numbers in 2018 (22.9/trap net) were above  the historic average (11.3/trap net) for this lake and above average (7.9/trap net) when compared to other similar lakes in the area. Bluegill average length was 7.1 inches which is larger than the historic average length of 6.2 inches. Approximately 15% of the bluegill sampled in 2018 were 8 inches or larger with a maximum length of 8.9 inches recorded. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass numbers in 2018 (6.2/trap net) were above the historic average (5.3/trap net) for this lake and above average (0.6/trap net) compared to other lakes in the area that are similar. Largemouth average length was 9.2 inches which is similar to the lake average of 9.0 inches. The largest largemouth measured 18.2 inches. Growth is slow and well below average. <br> \n <br> \nHybrid sunfish numbers in 2018 (12.2/trap net) were slightly above the historic average (11.0/trap net) for Miner's Pit. Sunfish average length measured 6.4 inches which is nearly identical to the average length of 6.5 inches. The largest hybrid sampled in 2018 measured 8.9 inches. <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Miner's Pit is a designated stream trout lake located within the city limits of Ely. It has a surface area of 140 acres and a maximum depth of 140 feet.  <br> \n <br> \nMiner's Pit is an abandoned iron mine pit from 1967 that filled with ground water and storm sewer runoff from the city. Water levels were stabilized in the mid 1980's by the installation of an outlet culvert to Shagawa Lake. This culvert has an internal drop that prevents movement of fish from Shagawa Lake to Miner's Pit. <br> \n <br> \nMiner's has classic mine pit features with steep sides and flooded trees, particularly in the east end. There is a concrete boat ramp and fishing pier located on the north shore for public access.  <br> \n <br> \nMiner's Pit water is quite hard due to dissolved minerals which include sulfates, calcium, magnesium, iron, and sodium. The sodium likely came from salt used for snow removal in the City of Ely. Below 100 ft there is little mixing of water with shallower water because of a density gradient caused by high salt and hydrogen sulfide concentrations. In the summer there is adequate oxygen for trout (more than 5 ppm) to a depth of about 30 ft, and adequate oxygen for other fish species (more than 2 ppm) to 35-40 ft.  <br> \n <br> \nRainbow and brook trout yearlings are stocked annually into Miner's Pit in the spring. Several other fish species are present including bluegill, hybrid and green sunfish, rock bass, largemouth bass, smallmouth bass, and white sucker.  <br> \n <br> \nBrook trout and rainbow trout are stocked at similar numbers but more brook trout were sampled: 1.4 versus 0.4/trap net. Brook trout are more vulnerable to trap nets at certain times of year, so they are not necessarily much more abundant than the rainbow trout. Brook trout averaged 8.4 inches long and the largest sampled was 11.7 inches. Rainbow trout fell into two general size groups: 9 to 11 inches and and 16 to 18 inches long. The largest sampled was 18.4 inches long. <br> \n <br> \nRock bass were very abundant at 21/trap net. Bluegill and sunfish hybrids were common at 18/trap net combined. Bluegill lengths averaged 6.5 inches. The hybrid sunfish were slightly larger on average. Two hybrids were sampled that were just over 10 inches long. Largemouth bass (5.1/trap net) were sampled up to 19 inches long. Smallmouth bass were sampled in low numbers up to 12 inches long.  <br> \n <br> \nA northern pike were sampled for the first time in 2012.  It is illegal to transport live fish and introduce them into public waters.  Northern pike predation can negatively impact stream trout in lakes.</p>",
