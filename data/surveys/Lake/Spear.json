In the absence of a major predator White Sucker and Yellow Perch densities remain fairly high. Brook Trout fingerlings were stocked in 1988, however; none of these fish were sampled in 1990 as the entire catch consisted of Age-1 fish. Natural reproduction apparently is sufficient to maintain a small population. </p>",
