Several emergent and submerged aquatic plants were present with all plants having a sparse density rating, except nuttall's pondweed.Test netting indicated a good fish population of brown bullhead, yellow bullhead, pumpkinseed, bluegill, and black crappie.  A fair walleye population was also present.  The test nets used in our survey yielded walleyes that ranged from 12 inches to 26 inches.  Also, several northern pike were caught in the test nets that ranged from 18 to 33 inches. Fair northern pike, largemouth bass and other centrarchid spawning habitat was present.  No parasites of disease was evident.  All fish caught appeared to be healthy and free of any visible diseases.Fish Stocking:Year\tSpecies\t\tSize\tAmount1956\tWalleye\t\tAdult\t   31956\tNorthern Pike\tYearling   71957\tNorthern Pike\tYearling  300</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Mitten Lake is a 108-acre lake located near Longville, Minnesota with 2.59 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 28 feet. The shoreline is mostly undeveloped. The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources has classified Minnesota\u0019s lakes into 43 different lake classes based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics. Mitten Lake is in Lake Class 36. Lakes in this class are generally shallow, regularly shaped lakes. Landowner permission is required to access this lake off County Route 55 on the east shore.  <br> \n <br> \nThe best angling opportunities in Mitten Lake are for largemouth bass, black crappie, and northern pike.  Largemouth bass up to 20 inches in length were sampled in 2007. Largemouth bass ranged in length from 6 to 20 inches. The average length was 13 inches.  Black crappie abundance has increased over the last forty years. Black crappie sampled in 2007 ranged in length from 4 to 12 inches with an average of 8 inches.  Northern pike were not abundant compared to other Lake Class 36 lakes. Fish up to 30 inches in length were sampled with an average length of 22 inches.  Bluegills generally were of medium size with a fair number of fish between 7 and 8 inches in length present.  Other species sampled were bowfin (dogfish), brown bullhead, pumpkinseed sunfish, walleye, and yellow bullhead. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers can help maintain or improve the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for table fare, but encourages release of medium- to large-sized fish.  Releasing these fish can help maintain balance in the fish community in Mitten Lake and provide anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future.   <br> \n <br> \nShoreline areas on the land and into the shallow water provide essential habitat for fish and wildlife that live in or near Minnesota\u0019s lakes.  Overdeveloped shorelines can\u0019t support the fish, wildlife, and clean water that are associated with natural undeveloped lakes.  Shoreline habitat consists of aquatic plants, woody plants and natural lake bottom soils.  Plants in the water and at the water\u0019s edge provide habitat, prevent erosion and absorb excess nutrients. Shrubs, trees, and woody debris such as fallen trees or limbs provide good habitat both above and below the water and should be left in place.  By leaving a buffer strip of natural vegetation along the shoreline, property owners can reduce erosion, help maintain water quality, and provide habitat and travel corridors for wildlife. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Net catches of northern pike (NOP) were low in Mitten Lake compared to other lake class 37 lakes.  The 1992 gillnet catch (2.0 fish/net) was below the interquartile range of 3.0 to 9.25 fish/net, while the NOP trapnet catch (0.6 fish/net) was within the interquartile trapnet range.  The 1968 gillnet catch was just 0.3 fish/net, though 1.8 NOP/trapnet were sampled.  The average size of NOP collected in the 1992 survey were small (PSD=10).  These fish ranged from 12.0 to 24.9 inches and had a mean weight of 1.2 pounds. Most of the NOP collected in the 1968 survey were caught in trapnets; they ranged from 18.0 to 33.9 inches and had a mean weight of 4.7 pounds.  Growth of Mitten Lake NOP was lower than in other Lake Class 37 waters in this area.  There is a lack of preferred fusiform-shaped fish prey species for northern pike.The yellow bullhead (YEB) population in Mitten appeared high in comparison to other Lake Class 37 lakes.  The net catches for YEB (8.0 fish/gillnet; 4.6 fish/trapnet) equalled or exceeded the third quartile catch rates for these two types of nets.  In the 1992 survey, YEB ranged from 7.5 to 12.9 inches.The trapnet catch of pumpkinseed (PMK) in 1992 (1.7 fish/net) was low compared to other in Lake Class 37, but 81 percent of the PMK were 6.0 inches are larger.  Over half (56 percent) of the PMK equalled or exceeded 7.0 inches and two of the PMK (12 percent) were 8.0 inches or longer.  In the 1968 survey, PMK were more abundant (6.4 fish/net), but had a slightly smaller average size (30 percent were 7.0 inches or more).Bluegill (BLG) were caught in trapnets at a rate of 11.3 fish/net, which is above the median catch, but within the interquartile range for this lake class.  The gillnet catch of BLG (9.0 fish/net) was higher than in most Lake Class 37 waters.  BLG in the 1992 survey had a small average size; just 8 percent were 6.0 inches or more (PSD=8) and only 2 percent were 7.0 inches or greater (RSD-7=2).  In the 1968 survey, the trapnet catch of BLG (36.2 fish/net) was about three times higher than the 1992 trapnet catch.  BLG sampled in 1968 had a larger average size (PSD=53, RSD-7=9) than those from the 1992 survey.  Growth rates on BLG in the 1992 survey were lower than three other local Lake Class 37 BLG populations.  Age 4 BLG averaged 3.8 inches at the formation of the fourth annulus.Ten largemouth bass (LMB) were collected in the 1992 survey and these fish ranged from 7.5 to 18.9 inches.  Eight of these fish were 12.0 inches or longer.  In the 1968 survey, five LMB, ranged from 8.5 to 18.9 inches, were collected.  Growth of LMB from the 1992 sampled compared favorably with growth rates in other local Lake Class 37 LMB populations. Age 4 LMB in Mitten averaged 12.6 inches at fomation of their fourth annulus.The trapnet catch rate of black crappie (BLC) in 1992 (3.2 fish/net) was very close to the rate found in 1968 (3.6 fish/net).  The BLC gillnet catch rate in 1992 (3.3 fish/net) was higher than the 1968 rate (0.6 fish/net).  Both the trapnet and gillnet catch rates in 1992 were lower than the Lake Class 37 medians, but were within their respective interquartile ranges.  BLC sampled in 1992 ranged from 4.0 to 12.9 inches, had a PSD of 69 and an RSD-P of 31.  This is similar to the size structure of the 1968 survey when BLC ranged from 5.0 to 10.9 inches, had a PSD of 85 and an RSD-P of 35.  The average age 4 BLC was 7.8 inches when it formed its fourth annulus.No walleye (WAE) were sampled during the 1992 survey.  In the 1968 survey, 6 WAE were collected in gillnets (2.0 fish/gillnet) and 2 in trapnets.  Perhaps, prior to the 1968 survey, there was immigration of WAE to Mitten from Island Lake (11-102) and/or successful natural reproduction of WAE.Three species of fish which are typically abundant in Lake Class 37 lakes were not sampled from Mitten Lake during 1992.  These species are black bullhead, white sucker and yellow perch.  White sucker and yellow perch were sampled in low numbers during 1968.</p>",
