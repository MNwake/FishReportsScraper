A recent partial winterkill (1990) has altered the fish community resulting in small sized panfish and an abundant northern pike populations.  The lake was assessed in 1995.     Northern pike were plentiful with an average length of 22.0 inches and an occasional fish over 27 inches.  Largemouth bass were re-introduced in 1993.  Besides the small sized panfish, black bullheads were also numerous.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Graham Lake is a 34.2 acre lake located near Holyoke, Minnesota with 92% (31.4 acres) littoral area and a maximum depth of 21 feet.  A state owned carry-down public access is located on the southeast shore, off state highway 23.  Northern pike and largemouth bass are the primary fish species.       Northern pike abundance was average for Minnesota lakes with a value of 7.0 fish/gillnet.  Mean length was 24.1 inches and 93% of fish were over 21 inches with the largest measuring 26.7 inches.  Growth was average for Duluth Area populations.  Based on age distribution, northern pike recruitment is consistent.       A largemouth bass electrofishing investigation was conducted in 1996 to evaluate largemouth bass stocking that occurred in 1993 and resulted in no fish.  During the survey in 2005, several largemouth bass were sighted near shore.  An angling investigation was then conducted to obtain information on fish size and growth.  Twelve largemouth bass were caught during the angling survey and another 16 were caught and recorded by volunteer anglers.  Mean length was 14.9 inches and 89% of the fish were larger than twelve inches.  Growth was average when compared to other Duluth Area bass populations.  Based on age distribution, largemouth bass have produced year classes in all years between 1996 and 2001.     Black crappie abundance was 11.8 fish/trapnet and was above average for Minnesota lakes of this type.  The mean length of black crappie was 7.7 inches.  The strong 2001 year class represented 98% of the fish sampled.     Bluegill abundance was above average for Minnesota lakes with a catch of 68.1 fish/trapnet.  Mean length was 5.2 inches with 10% of bluegills 6 inches or greater and a maximum size of 7.7 inches.  Bluegill reproduction was consistent and growth was slow for Duluth Area lakes.       Yellow perch abundance of 1.5 fish/gillnet was below average for Minnesota lakes of this type.  Mean length was 5.7 inches and growth was slow compared to other Duluth Area populations.       Anglers have reported good northern pike and largemouth bass fishing in Graham Lake.  The fish community appears to have shifted from one dominated by black bullheads to one that represents a bass-panfish community.</p>",

Graham Lake is 34.2 acres with 31.4 acres (92%) littoral area and has a maximum depth of 21 feet. The 2023 targeted survey was completed to check the status of the fish community following a winterkill reported earlier in the year.  <br> \n <br> \nA single northern was caught in during the netting and measured 29.6 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nA total of 90 Black Crappie were sampled in the survey. The average length of crappie was 6.4 inches with a range of 4.7 to 8.5 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nTwo Bluegill measuring 5.6 and 8.0 inches were caught in the nets. <br> \n <br> \nNo Largemouth Bass were caught in the survey, but that does not mean bass are no longer present in the lake. Bass do not sample well with the gear used during this survey.  <br> \n <br> \nThe Black Crappie population survived the winterkill well, with sampling suggesting multiple age classes. The other species in the lake likely will bounce back after a few years. </p>",
