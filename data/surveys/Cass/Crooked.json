                "narrative": "<p>Crooked Lake (DOW # 110494, Lake Class 27) is a 528-acre lake located about nine miles south of the City of Cass Lake, MN.   Crooked Lake is connected to Welsh Lake by a navigable channel, and Welsh Lake has a state-owned public access with a concrete ramp. The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MNDNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different classes based on physical, chemical and other characteristics.  Crooked Lake is in Lake Class 27; lakes in this class are generally very large, deep and have a regularly shaped shoreline with few bays or points.   <br> \n <br> \nThe Crooked Lake walleye abundance in 2010 was similar to the average of other lakes in Lake Class 27.  Fish from 8 to 28 inches were sampled in MNDNR test nets.  Both the number and average size of northern pike in Crooked Lake is good; sampled fish ranged from 16 to 31 inches and had an average length of 22 inches.  Relative bluegill abundance is near the average for Lake Class 27 and sizes ranged from 3 to 9 inches, averaging 5.5 inches.  Other species present include black crappie, bowfin (dogfish), brown bullhead, cisco (tullibee), hybrid sunfish, largemouth bass, pumpkinseed sunfish, rock bass, yellow bullhead and yellow perch.  <br> \n   <br> \nAnglers can help maintain or improve the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for table fare, but encourages release of medium- to large-sized fish.  Releasing these fish can help maintain balance in the fish community in Crooked Lake and provide anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future.  <br> \n <br> \nCrooked Lake is not currently known to be infested with any aquatic invasive species (AIS).  To avoid spreading AIS, lake users should inspect and remove any aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat away from the landing prior to launching and again before leaving the access.  If you suspect you may have discovered a new infestation of an invasive species, save a specimen and report it to a local natural resource office.  Additional information on AIS prevention and awareness, including the problems they cause, can be found on the DNR website (www.dnr.state.mn.us).         <br> \n <br> \nShoreline habitat consists of aquatic plants, woody plants and natural lake bottom soils.  Plants in the water and at the water's edge provide habitat, prevent erosion and absorb excess nutrients. Shrubs, trees, and woody debris such as fallen trees or limbs provide good habitat both above and below the water and should be left in place.  By leaving a buffer strip of natural vegetation along the shoreline, property owners can reduce erosion, help maintain water quality, and provide habitat and travel corridors for wildlife. <br> \n</p>",

The assessment consisted of 30 survey sites evenly spaced 200 meters around the lake. Assessments were made in three habitat zones: Shoreline Zone (the shore-water interface to the top of the natural bank), Shoreland Zone (land-ward from shoreline to development structure or 100 feet), and Aquatic Zone (lake-ward 50 feet of shoreline). The average lakewide habitat score was 83.1 (+/- 3.3) out of 100 possible. Approximately 6 percent of the sites were developed with a mean score of 23.3 (+/- 3.3), while undeveloped sites had a mean score of 87.3 (+/- 1.6).</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Crooked is a 528-acre lake located 9 miles south and 3 miles east of Cass Lake, Minnesota.  Forty-five  percent of the lake is 15 feet or less and has a maximum depth of 74 feet.  There is a DNR-owned public access on Welsh Lake which anglers use to access Crooked Lake. The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types, based on physical, chemical and other characteristics.  Crooked is in Lake Class 27.  Other area lakes in this classification include Pleasant (two miles east of Hackensack), Portage (six miles north of Hackensack), and Webb (six miles east of Hackensack).     Crooked Lake had an abundant northern pike population, with a catch rate of 8.4/experimental gill net.  Catch rates of northern pike were similar to other lakes of this type. Of the sampled northern pike 14 inches or larger, 9 percent were 28 inches or longer. Individuals up to 34 inches were found.  The average length of northern pike at four years of age was 22.7 inches.In the 1995 assessment, walleye abundance in Crooked Lake (3.6/experimental gill net) was similar to the average found in  lakes of this type and also the 1991 assessment.  Sampled Walleye ranged from eight to 20 inches in length.  Age and growth analysis indicates walleye reproduce naturally in Crooked Lake.  The average walleye was 14.2 inches at four years old.Just three largemouth bass were sampled in DNR trap nets in 1995. These fish were in the 12- to 13-inch length groups. At age four, the average largemouth bass was 11.0 inches. Two black crappie, both 10 inches long, were sampled in DNR experimental gill nets in 1995.  The catch rate of bluegill in 1995 (13.0 fish/trap net) was average for lakes of this type and close to the catch rate observed in 1991.  Bluegill catches have increased since the first two surveys (1957 and 1987). Sampled bluegill had a good average size; forty percent were 7 inches or larger.  Bluegill growth was similar to  other local lakes of this type. An average bluegill was 5.0 inches when it became four years old.  The 1995 catch rates for pumpkinseed, cisco (tullibee) and yellow perch were average for lakes of this type. Yellow perch ranged from four to ten inches with five percent more than 10 inches long.     Other species sampled during the 1995 assessment include bowfin, yellow bullhead, brown bullhead, and rock bass.To help maintain quality fish populations in Crooked Lake, lake users should safeguard aquatic habitat by preserving or reestablishing aquatic plants and natural shorelines.  Aquatic and terrestrial plants provide food and cover for fish and wildlife. They also help protect shorelines from erosion, and absorb nutrients and pollutants.  Natural shorelines, shorelines that have not been altered by man, help protect a lake from silt-laden runoff waters. They also provide excellent places for wildlife to feed, hide, and raise their young. Protection of the Crooked Lake watershed is also needed for maintaining  the lake's water quality.Anglers can help maintain or improve the quality fishing by practicing catch and release of medium to large-sized fish. Releasing these fish will help the fish population in Crooked Lake and provides anglers with more opportunities to catch more large fish in the future.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Crooked Lake (DOW # 110494, Lake Class 27) is a 528-acre lake located about nine miles south of the City of Cass Lake, MN.   Crooked Lake is connected to Welsh Lake by a navigable channel, and Welsh Lake has a state-owned public access with a concrete ramp. The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MNDNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different classes based on physical, chemical and other characteristics.  Crooked Lake is in Lake Class 27; lakes in this class are generally very large, deep and have a regularly shaped shoreline with few bays or points.  The lake is managed primarily for walleye and northern pike and secondarily for cisco (tullibee), bluegill, black crappie, largemouth bass and yellow perch.Walleye abundance in the 2005 sampling in Crooked Lake was similar to the average of other lakes in Lake Class 27.  Fish from 15 to 27 inches were sampled in MNDNR test nets.  Crooked Lake is stocked with walleye fry approximately every other year by the Leech Lake Reservation; fry stocking appears to increase the strength of walleye year classes in this lake.  Both the number and average size of northern pike in Crooked Lake is good; sampled fish ranged from 17 to 29 inches and had an average length of 23 inches.  Other species present include bluegill, black crappie, bowfin (dogfish), brown bullhead, cisco (tullibee), hybrid sunfish, largemouth bass, pumpkinseed sunfish, rock bass, yellow bullhead and yellow perch.   Anglers can help maintain or improve the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for table fare, but encourages release of medium- to large-sized fish.  Releasing these fish can help maintain balance in the fish community in Crooked Lake and provide anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future.  Shoreline areas on the land and into the shallow water provide essential habitat for fish and wildlife that live in or near Minnesota's lakes.  Overdeveloped shorelines can't support the fish, wildlife, and clean water that are associated with natural undeveloped lakes. The combined effects of all lakeshore owners \"fixing up\" their property can destroy a lake's valuable natural shorelines.Shoreline habitat consists of aquatic plants, woody plants and natural lake bottom soils.Plants in the water and at the water's edge provide habitat, prevent erosion and absorb excess nutrients. Shrubs, trees, and woody debris such as fallen trees or limbs provide good habitat both above and below the water and should be left in place.  Natural lake bottom materials like silt or gravel are more ecologically productive than pure sand trucked in for a swimming beach.  A tidy lawn and a sandy beach make great spots for sunbathing and swimming but do little to provide habitat for fish and wildlife. By leaving a buffer strip of natural vegetation along the shoreline, property owners can reduce erosion, help maintain water quality, and provide habitat and travel corridors for wildlife.Only if more lakeshore owners manage their shoreline in a natural condition can fish and wildlife populations on Minnesota lakes remain healthy and abundant.  More specific information on protecting or restoring shorelines and watersheds is available through the local DNR Fisheries office.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Crooked Lake is a 528-acre lake with a maximum depth of 74 feet.  The lake is within  the Leech Lake Indian Reservation and is located nine miles southeast of Cass Lake in northern Cass County.  Crooked Lake is attached to Welsh Lake via a navigable channel.  Fish can migrate between the two lakes.  There is a DNR concrete public access on Welsh Lake.  The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different lake classes based on physical and chemical characteristics.  Crooked Lake is in lake class 27.  Lakes in this lake class are typically moderate in size, moderately deep, and moderately clear.  Most of the shoreline around the lake is publicly owned.  Approximately 45% of the lake is 15 feet or less in depth.  Most of the watershed around the lake is forested with extensive areas of bog.  Crooked Lake provides a multitude of angling opportunities.  There is good fishing for northern pike, walleye, bluegill, black crappie and largemouth bass.  The lake is managed primarily for walleye and northern pike.Northern pike abundance in 2000 was the highest recorded.  There has been an upward trend in abundance since the first survey.  Fish ranged in length from 15 to 31 inches with an average length and weight of 20.6 inches and 2.0 pounds.  Northern pike spawn both in the lake in the streams going in and out of both Welsh and Crooked Lake.Walleye abundance in 2000 was also the highest recorded.  Young walleye are stocked in both Crooked and Welsh Lake by the Leech Lake Reservation Department of Resource Management.  The stocking along with natural reproduction are supporting the abundant walleye population.  Walleye showed  good quality with an average length of 17.6 inches.  Seventy-four percent of the walleye sampled were four year old fish.Panfish sampled include bluegill, black crappie, rock bass, and pumpkinseed. It appears that the quality is being impacted by anglers.  To maintain or improve quality, anglers need to use some restraint if large panfish are really biting.  Release the larger panfish such as bluegill and keep the smaller ones for eating.  Quality size panfish have disappeared from many lakes due to excessive harvest by anglers.Anglers can help maintain or improve the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for table fare, but encourages release of medium to large size fish.  Releasing medium to large size fish will provide anglers with opportunities to catch more and larger fish in the future and can help maintain balance in the fish community.Shoreline areas - on the land and into the shallow water - provide essential habitat for fish and wildlife that live in or near Minnesota's lakes.  Overdeveloped shorelines can't support the fish, wildlife, and clean water that are associated with natural undeveloped lakes.  The combined effects of all lakeshore owners \"fixing up\" their property can destroy a lake's valuable natural shorelines.The shoreline habitat consists of aquatic plants, woody plants, and natural lake bottom soils. Plants in the water and at the water's edge provide habitat, prevent erosion, and absorb excess nutrients.  Shrubs, trees, and woody debris such as fallen trees or limbs provide good habitat both above and below the water and should be left in place.  Natural lake bottom materials like silt or gravel are more ecologically productive that pure sand      trucked in for a swimming beach.  A tidy lawn and a sandy beach make great spots for sunbathing and swimming but do little to provide habitat for fish and wildlife.  By leaving a buffer strip of natural vegetation along the shoreline, property owners can reduce erosion, help maintain water quality, and provide habitat and travel corridors for wildlife.Only if more lakeshore owners manage their shoreline in a natural condition can fish and wildlife populations on Minnesota lakes remain healthy and abundant.  More specific information on protecting or restoring shorelines and watersheds is available through DNR Fisheries offices.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p> <br> \nCrooked Lake (DOW# 11-0494; Lake Class 27) is a 565-acre lake located near Wilkinson, MN.  <br> \nCrooked Lake is accessible via a navigable channel between Crooked Lake and Welsh Lake. There is a DNR-owned public access on the east shore of Welsh Lake. Crooked Lake has 3.65 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 74 feet. The DNR has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different classes based on physical, chemical and other characteristics. Crooked Lake is in Lake Class 27; lakes in this class are large, deep, and regularly shaped. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike are moderately abundant in Crooked Lake and catch rates tend to range between 6-10 fish per gill net, although sizes sampled in 2015 were smaller compared to past surveys. Northern Pike up to 30 inches were sampled. Walleye numbers have been relatively stable, with around five fish per net.  Walleye sampled in 2015 ranged from 9 to 27 inches, and many of these were between 14 and 20 inches long.  Bluegill and Black Crappie can also provide additional quality fishing opportunities to anglers, with Bluegill over 8 inches and Black Crappie over 13inches sampled. Other fish species that anglers can expect to encounter include Brown Bullhead, Burbot, Bowfin (Dogfish), Largemouth Bass,  Pumpkinseed, Rock Bass, Tullibee (Cisco), Yellow Bullhead, and Yellow Perch. <br> \n <br> \nPeople can have significant impacts on lakes and the fish populations they support. Harvest, lakeshore development, removal of shoreline vegetation, and introductions of invasive species can all adversely affect fish populations. No aquatic invasive species have been identified in Crooked Lake. AIS (aquatic invasive species) are moved from infested to non-infested waters by anglers, boaters, and lake shore owners and can adversely impact lakes and fish populations. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access. If you suspect an infestation of an invasive species in this lake, save a specimen and report it to a local natural resource office. Additional information on all of these topics can be found on the DNR website (www.dnr.state.mn.us) or by contacting the Walker Area Fisheries office. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of nearshore fish species in Crooked Lake was conducted on July 22nd and 29th, 2021 by Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program Staff. Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at 14 sampling stations. Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample nine stations, a 15-foot seine was used at one station, and site conditions prevented the use of seines at four stations. Nearshore sampling captured 17 species of fish including five species that are intolerant of disturbance (Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, and Rock Bass) and none that are tolerant of disturbance. <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore data were combined with trap net and gill net data from an August 24th, 2020 standard survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based IBI (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment. In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (Blackchin Shiner, Iowa Darter, and Rock Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (Black Bullhead, Common Carp, Fathead Minnow). The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.  <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey indicates Crooked Lake is in good health as indicated by an FIBI score above the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes. Data from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Leech Lake River Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.</p>",

THE 1991 RATE WAS COMPARABLE TO THE FIRST QUARTILE FOR LAKE MODAL LENGTH GROUP BEING 14.0 - 14.9 INCHES.  IN 1987, THE MEAN LENGTH WALLEYE WAS 15.6 INCHES, AS COMPARED TO 14.0 INCHES IN 1991.  THE PSD WENT DOWN SLIGHTLY IN 1991 (39), COMPARED TO 1987 (50), DUE TO THE INFLUENCE OF AGE 3 (AVERAGE LENGTH = 14.1 INCHES) FISH WHICH MADE UP 40 PERCENT OF THE WALLEYE CAUGHT.  GROWTH WAS GOOD AT ALL AGES.  SOME WALLEYE WERE STOCKED IN THE LAKE.  LAKE WHITEFISH WERE ALSO STOCKED EVERY YEAR SINCE 1987, BUT NONE WERE SAMPLED IN OUR GEAR IN 1991.NORTHERN PIKE ABUNDANCE FOR 1991 (5.4/GILLNET LIFT) WAS THE SAME FOR THE LAKE CLASS MEDIAN (5.5/LIFT).  IN 1987, NORTHERN PIKE WERE CAPTURED AT A RATE OF 3.9/LIFT.  NORTHERN PIKE IN 1991 RANGED IN LENGTH FROM 14 TO 30 INCHES, WITH A MODAL LENGTH GROUP OF 20.0 - 20.9 INCHES.  THE PSD DIDN'T CHANGE FROM 1987 TO 1991. GROWTH WAS GOOD, WITH AN AGE 3 FISH BEING ALMOST 20 INCHES LONG.THE 1991 RATE (11.3/TRAPNET LIFT) FOR BLUEGILL WAS SLIGHTLY BELOW THE LAKE CLASS MEDIAN (15.88 LIFT).  IN THE 1957 ASSESSMENT, NO BLUEGILL WERE CAPTURED.  IN 1987, SIGNIFICANT NUMBERS (3.3/LIFT) STARTED TO SHOW UP, BUT WERE QUITE SMALL, WITH A PSD OF ONLY 2.  BUT BY 1991, THE CAPTURE RATE AND PSD HAD RISEN TO 11.3/LIFT AND 53, RESPECTIVELY.  THE MODAL LENGTH GROUP FOR 1991 WAS 6.5 - 6.9 INCHES.  THESE LENGTH FISH WERE 4 YEARS OLD AND SHOWED MARGINALLY GOOD GROWTH.THE LENGTHS OF BLACK CRAPPIE THAT WERE CAPTURED VARIED WIDELY FROM 4 TO 14 INCHES, WITH NO MODAL LENGTH GROUP PRESENT.  BLACK CRAPPIE WERE CAUGHT AT ABOUT THE SAME RATE AS IN 1987.  GROWTH WAS SLOW THE FIST THREE YEARS, THEN GOOD AFTER THAT.TWENTY-FOUR LARGEMOUTH BASS WERE CAUGHT, FOR A RATE OF 2.2/TRAPNET LIFT.  THERE WERE NO BASS CAUGHT IN TRAPNETS IN 1987, HOWEVER, 8 BASS WERE CAUGHT IN THE GILLNETS.  THE LENGTH FREQUENCY DISTRIBUTIONS SHOWED MANY AGES.  GROWTH WAS GOOD AT ALL AGES.

                "narrative": "<p>Crooked Lake (DOW# 11-0494; Lake Class 27) is a 565-acre lake located near Wilkinson, MN. There is a DNR-owned public access on the east shore of Welsh Lake and Crooked Lake is accessible through a navigable channel between the two lakes. Crooked Lake has 3.65 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 74 feet. The DNR has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different classes based on physical, chemical and other characteristics. Crooked Lake is in Lake Class 27; lakes in this class are large, deep, and regularly shaped. Other Lake Class 27 lakes in the Walker Area include Ada (DOW #11-0250), Pleasant (DOW# 11-0383), Six Mile (DOW# 11-0146), and Thirteen (DOW# 11-0488). The purpose of this survey was to assess the status of gamefish populations. <br> \n <br> \nCrooked Lake is an excellent Walleye and Northern Pike lake in the Walker area. Walleye and Northern Pike numbers have been above average for Lake Class 27 lakes over the last 20 years and five fisheries assessments. Walleye numbers remained high and have been above the management goal of 5 fish per gill net in assessments conducted since 2000. Walleye average length was 15 inches long with fish up to 22 inches long sampled. Northern Pike abundance was near the record high set in 2000. Northern Pike gill net catch rates have been within or above the lake specific goal of five to eight fish per gill net since 1995.  Large Northern Pike up to 36 inches long were sampled though a high percentage of fish were less than 22 inches long. The Bluegill population was within the management goal of 5 to 15 fish per trap net. Most of the Bluegills in the sample were less than 6 inches long. However, about ten percent of Bluegill measured 8 inches or greater in length. The Yellow Perch population continues to be low following a steep decline since 1995. The Yellow Perch gill net catch of 5 fish per net was well below the management goal of 30.00 to 50.00 fish per net. All the Yellow Perch in the sample were less than 8 inches long. Other fish species that anglers can expect to encounter include Brown Bullhead, Bowfin (Dogfish), Largemouth Bass,  Pumpkinseed, Rock Bass, Tullibee (Cisco), and Yellow Bullhead. <br> \n <br> \nPeople can have significant impacts on lakes and the fish populations they support. Harvest, lakeshore development, removal of shoreline vegetation, and introductions of invasive species can all adversely affect fish populations. No aquatic invasive species have been identified in Crooked Lake. AIS (aquatic invasive species) are moved from infested to non-infested waters by anglers, boaters, and lake shore owners and can adversely impact lakes and fish populations. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access. If you suspect an infestation of an invasive species in this lake, save a specimen and report it to a local natural resource office. Additional information on all of these topics can be found on the DNR website (www.dnr.state.mn.us) or by contacting the Walker Area Fisheries office. <br> \n</p>",
