                "narrative": "<p>Cotton Lake is a popular fishing lake located in the upper reaches of the Ottertail River watershed in central Becker County.  Anglers fish mainly for northern pike and panfish but also do well on walleye at times.  Cotton is a relatively large lake (1720 ac) yet is fairly shallow (25 ft. max. depth).  It is a lake with high productivity and a diverse fish community with fourteen fish species sampled in test nets.  Cotton Lake has good water quality with water clarity readings between nine and sixteen feet.  The lake's watershed is composed mostly of mixed hardwoods with some small agricultural lands.  The lake itself is surrounded by 255 lake homes and cottages and two resorts.The 1996 lake survey catch rate for walleye was 4.3 per gillnet.  This falls in the normal range for a lake of this ecological type.  In 1986 a peak number of walleye were caught (12.6 per gillnet) which falls above the normal range.  This high catch rate was the result of two years of strong natural reproduction.  Currently, the two strongest year classes are also from non-stocked years.  Although periodic stocking has been used to supplement the walleye population, it appears that the strongest year classes are the result of good natural success.Cotton Lake northern pike have historically been reported as numerous but small in size.  However, fish over 12 pounds have occasionally been taken in the past few years.  In the 1996 survey northerns had a mean length of 15.8 inches and a mean weight of 1.1 pounds.  The majority of fish sampled were one or two years old with only one fish over age six caught.  Generally, this is the result of angling pressures.Bluegill abundance in Cotton Lake has exploded since 1981.  The current catch rates are well above the normal range.  This expansion has resulted in very slow growing fish with no fish over 8.0 inches captured.   However, bluegills average 6.4 inches and with time could provide some excellent fishing.  In addition to bluegill, Cotton Lake can have good largemouth bass and black crappie fishing.The Minnesota Fish Consumption Advisory 1996 recommends limiting consumption of large piscivores to twice a week for seasonal residents and once a week for year around residents due to small amounts of mercury.  There are no limits advised for consumption of bluegill, white sucker, and smaller walleye or northern pike.Cotton Lake is a relatively clean lake which is indicated by its diverse fish population, the presence of tullibee and the absence of large numbers of black bullheads.  The lake itself is fairly shallow so it is important for residents to take note of changes in the lake's watershed.  The maintenance of a healthy fish population and property values is dependent on long term water quality as well as fish management.  Runoff from fields, fertilized lawns and outdated septic systems bring in phosphorous which commonly controls lake productivity.  The results of surface runoff can be poor water quality, increased eutrophication, and an increase in undesirable fish species.  Currently Cotton Lake is a beautiful lake with clean water and good fishing.  It is everyone's responsbility to keep it that way.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Cotton Lake is a popular all around fishing lake located in the Otter Tail River watershed in central Becker County.  It has a diverse fish community ranging from species that prefer warm, turbid water (like black bullhead) to those that prefer cold, clear, well-oxygenated water like cisco (tullibee).In 2001, net catches of several popular fish species were up from catches in 1996.  Northern pike, largemouth bass, and black crappie catches were higher than they have ever been in six previous surveys since 1956.  In general, pike were small (average length was 17.3 inches) but some larger fish were present.  Crappies averaged just under nine inches and bass averaged just under 12 inches in length.Walleye catches had also increased.  Gill nets averaged 9.3 walleyes per set in 2001 compared to 4.2 walleyes per set in both 1996 and 1991.  These walleyes averaged 14.6 inches in length and weighed just over a pound each (average).  Approximately 80% of those fish were attributed to year classes when fingerling stocking occurred.  Non-stocking year classes were often reported as more abundant than stocking year classes in past survey reports.  Future surveys should help to reveal any trends in walleye natural reproduction in Cotton Lake.In general, net catches of bass and panfish showed dramatic increases during the 1980's and they remained high now compared to catches reported in surveys conducted in the 1950's and 1970's.  An exception to this statement was yellow perch.  Perch catches were significantly higher before the 1980's than since.Information provided by the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (PCA) showed that Cotton Lake was categorized as a mesotrophic lake.  This means that the lake is about midway in the aging spectrum between a young, clear, infertile lake (oligotrophic) and an older, turbid, fertile lake (eutrophic).Lakeshore owners and other watershed dwellers can help to slow the aging process in Cotton Lake by using best management practices for all landscaping activities.  For those who want to change things on their shoreline property, two excellent sources are available to help in landscaping a shoreline in ways that do the least damage and have the most benefit to the lake's water quality, fish community, and, ultimately, property values.  These sources are the book \"Lakescaping for Wildlife and Water Quality\" and the computer CD \"Restore Your Shore.\"  Both are available through the Minnesota Bookstore.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>The northern pike gillnet catch rate remains nearly identical to the previous survey's at a level between the first and third quartile for this lake class (Schupp's #27).  Northern pike growth rates are good but the average size is only one-half of the lake class's average; one, two, and three-year-old fish comprise the bulk of the population.  A very high bluegill trapnet catch in the 1986 survey (85.56/set) declined somewhat in the current survey (67.25/set) but is still above the third quartile for this lake class.  Bluegills exhibit a slow growth rate.  Despite this slow growth, mean size is above average for abundant bluegill populations in this lake class.  As would be expected in this situation, older fish (six and seven-year-olds) comprise nearly 60% of the population.  Black crappies and largemouth bass, although difficult to assess with standard lake survey gear, both appear to be present in significant numbers, and both exhibit fast growth.  Anglers often report good catches of black crappies.  The gillnet catch for yellow perch remains substantially the same as the previous survey's.  It is at a level between the first and third quartile for this lake class.  Walleyes show a significant decline from the previous survey, from 12.62/gillnet in 1986 to 4.25/gillnet in the current survey.  However, 4.25/gillnet is still between the first and third quartile.  Periodic fingerling stocking has been used to supplement natural reproduction that occasionally produces major year classes.  In the previous survey, three major year classes were present and all were the result of natural reproduction.  Currently, only one moderately strong year class is present and it coincides with a fingerling stocking year.  A combination of factors, including angler harvest (this is a very popular walleye fishery), natural mortality associated with the aging of major year classes, and failure of natural reproduction to produce any significant new year classes, have all contributed to the decline in walleye abundance.  Walleye growth rates appear good through age three but below average thereafter.  A historically small tullibee gillnet catch remains so at 0.62/set.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Cotton Lake has a diverse fish community that includes not only warmwater species like bullhead, bluegill, black crappie, largemouth bass, northern pike, and walleye, but also coldwater species like cisco (tullibee).  Tullibees and other coldwater species require cool, well-oxygenated refuge areas during the heat of summer and reasonably good water quality. Significant declines in catch rates of these species can signal problems with water quality.  Fortunately, this has not yet occurred in Cotton.  Net catches of cisco in 2006 were at their historic high for this lake at 3.4 fish per net. <br> \n <br> \nA special regulation for northern pike has been in effect on Cotton Lake since 2003.  This regulation requires anglers to immediately release all pike between 24 and 36 inches in length. Although population changes are not always easy to detect after just three years of a regulation, there are some indicators that the regulation is having an impact on the size structure of northern pike in this lake.  For example, the average length of sampled pike was longer in 2006 (17.6 inches) than in any of the seven previous studies since 1956.  Another measure used to define size structure is the proportional stock density (PSD).  For pike, this is the percent of stock (sexually mature) fish at least 21 inches in length.  In Cotton Lake in 2006, the northern pike PSD was 24%, which was the second highest in history and nearly double that reported in 2001.  The historic high PSD is 50% and the lake's historic mean is just 17%.  Hopefully, these pike will grow to trophy sizes in the future and opportunities will exist to catch fish over 30, or even 36 inches.  With the presence of cisco, this lake has the potential to produce large pike. <br> \n <br> \nWalleyes are stocked regularly.  Natural reproduction of this species appears to be very limited in this lake but some small amount occurs.  In 2006, catches were similar to those in the most recent previous survey at 9.6 walleyes per set.  Cotton Lake's historic average walleye catch rate is 7.8 fish per set.  The mean walleye size was 14.5 inches in length and 1.1 pounds in weight. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass and and black crappie catch rates were slightly higher than the lake's historic averages.  In the first two lake studies (1956 and 1973), over 27% of sampled bluegills were larger than eight inches in length.  In 2006, the average length of sampled bluegills was 6.0 inches and none over 8.0 inches were found.  Bluegills also appear to be more abundant and slower growing than they were at the time of the first two lake surveys. <br> \n <br> \nThere are likely many reasons for changes in fish populations over time.  In several Minnesota lakes, declines in yellow perch numbers have been accompanied by increases in bluegill numbers along with a shrinking bluegill size structure.  Yellow perch were abundant during the first two Cotton Lake studies, at the same time bluegills were less abundant and larger than at present.  It is also clear that in many Minnesota lakes bluegills and other fish species are being harvested before they have a chance to grow to sizes preferred by most anglers.  It appears this is the case in Cotton Lake, as well, with most bluegills being \"cropped off\" about the time they reach seven inches in length. <br> \n <br> \nFish populations in any lake are reflections of their habitat and watershed.  Cotton Lake's shoreline is heavily developed and the lake is vulnerable to cultural eutrophication (aging).  Unchecked development of the watershed could tip the balance toward smelly algal blooms and a fish community dominated by black bullhead.  Obviously, this has not yet happened in Cotton Lake, but continued vigilance is necessary to slow the lake's aging process.  Individuals from Cotton Lake help monitor changes by participating in the Pollution Control Agency's Citizen Lake Monitoring Program.  Other ways that landowners can help to maintain property values, water quality, and fish populations include (1) exceeding shoreline setbacks for buildings and septic systems, (2) not fertilizing lawns, (3) leaving wide shoreline buffer zones of unmowed, natural vegetation, (4) leaving as much aquatic vegetation (especially emergents like bulrushes and cattails) intact as possible when obtaining access to open water, and (5) following practices illustrated in the DNR document \"Lakescaping for Wildlife and Water Quality\" when landscaping shoreline property.  In addition, anglers can help sustain fish populations by voluntarily reducing their harvest of medium and large size fish and by complying with special fishing regulations.  Anglers are also encouraged to harvest small pike (those under 24 inches) to help balance the population.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A survey of near shore fish species was conducted by Detroit Lakes Area Fisheries Staff on Cotton Lake (03028600) on July 6, 2016.  Cotton Lake is 1,783 acres, located 10 miles northeast of Detroit Lakes, MN.  During this survey, 18 100-foot sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake shore, sampling a variety of habitat types.  Each site is sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with either a 50-foot or a 15-foot 1/8th-inch mesh seine, depending on habitat condition.   <br> \n <br> \nDuring this survey, 11 sites were sampled with a 50-foot seine, and four were was sampled with a 15-foot seine.  Site conditions prevented the use of seines at three sites.  Backpack electrofishing was done at 18 sites.  Nearshore sampling captured 19 species of fish including six species intolerant of disturbance and/or poor water quality.  Intolerant species sampled were Banded Killifish, Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, Logperch, Mimic Shiner, and Rock Bass.  Other species sampled during the nearshore effort included Black Bullhead, Bluegill, Bluntnose Minnow, Fathead Minnow, Green Sunfish, Hybrid Sunfish, Johnny Darter, Largemouth Bass, Northern Pike, Pumpkinseed, Spottail Shiner, White Sucker, and Yellow Perch. <br> \n <br> \nThe near shore fish survey data is combined with gill net and trap net data from a July, 2016 survey to describe the fish community and provide a fish-based Index of Biotic Integrity (FIBI) score based on expectations for similar lakes. <br> \n <br> \nThis survey is contributing to a watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.  Cotton Lake is located in the Ottertail River Watershed. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Cotton Lake has a diverse fish community that includes not only warmwater species like bullhead, bluegill, black crappie, largemouth bass, northern pike, and walleye, but also coldwater species like cisco (tullibee).  Tullibees and other coldwater species require cool, well-oxygenated refuge areas during the heat of summer and reasonably good water quality. Significant declines in catch rates of these species can signal problems with water quality.  Fortunately, this has not yet occurred in Cotton.  Net catches of cisco in 2011 were near their historic high for this lake at 3.3 fish per net. <br> \n <br> \nA special regulation for northern pike was in effect on Cotton Lake from May, 2003 through December, 2011.  This regulation required anglers to immediately release all pike between 24 and 36 inches in length.  The goal was a better balanced pike population with more opportunities to catch larger pike.  Legislative action in 2011 required a statewide reduction in lakes with northern pike special regulations from approximately 120 to 100 or fewer.  Six area lakes with special pike regulations were subsequently evaluated for their potential to be dropped from special regulations.  Following eight years of pike regulations, Cotton and Big Floyd Lakes were believed to be least likely to reach management goals and regulations were subsequently dropped to help meet the legislative mandate.  Two of the criteria which led to the decision in Cotton Lake were the recent decline in proportions of pike over 24 and 30 inches in length and increased numbers of small pike in the fishery. <br> \n <br> \nWalleyes are stocked regularly.  Natural reproduction of this species appears to be very limited in this lake but some still occurs.  In 2011, catches were similar to those in the most recent previous survey at 9.9 walleyes per set.  Cotton Lake's historical average walleye catch rate is 8.0 fish per set.  The mean walleye size was 14.9 inches in length and 1.25 pounds in weight. <br> \n <br> \nGood numbers of largemouth bass, black crappies, and bluegills are also present in Cotton Lake.  Trap nets are generally considered the \"indicator\" nets for these species.  None were set in 2011 due to time constraints resulting from a state shut-down in early July.  However, good samples of bluegills and bass were caught in gill nets and crappies and bass were also sampled during late spring.  In the first two lake studies (1956 and 1973), over 27% of sampled bluegills were larger than eight inches in length.  In 2011, the average length of sampled bluegills was 6.1 inches and a few over 8.0 inches were found.  Bluegills also appear to be more abundant and slower growing than they were at the time of the first two lake surveys. <br> \n <br> \nThere are likely many reasons for changes in fish populations over time.  In several Minnesota lakes, declines in yellow perch numbers have been accompanied by increases in bluegill numbers along with a shrinking bluegill size structure.  Yellow perch were abundant during the first two Cotton Lake studies, at the same time bluegills were less abundant and larger than at present.  It is also clear that in many Minnesota lakes bluegills and other fish species are being harvested before they have a chance to grow to sizes preferred by most anglers.  It appears this is the case in Cotton Lake, as well, with most bluegills being \"cropped off\" about the time they reach seven inches in length. <br> \n <br> \nFish populations in any lake are reflections of their habitat and watershed.  Cotton Lake's shoreline is heavily developed and the lake is vulnerable to cultural eutrophication (aging).  Unchecked development of the watershed could tip the balance toward smelly algal blooms and a fish community dominated by black bullhead.  Obviously, this has not yet happened in Cotton Lake, but continued vigilance is necessary to slow the lake's aging process.  Individuals from Cotton Lake help monitor changes by participating in the Pollution Control Agency's Citizen Lake Monitoring Program.  Other ways that landowners can help to maintain property values, water quality, and fish populations include (1) exceeding shoreline setbacks for buildings and septic systems, (2) not fertilizing lawns, (3) leaving wide shoreline buffer zones of unmowed, natural vegetation, (4) leaving as much aquatic vegetation (especially emergents like bulrushes and cattails) intact as possible when obtaining access to open water, and (5) following practices illustrated in the DNR document \"Lakescaping for Wildlife and Water Quality\" when landscaping shoreline property.  In addition, anglers can help sustain fish populations by voluntarily reducing their harvest of medium and large size fish.  Anglers are also encouraged to harvest small pike (those under 24 inches) to help balance the population.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Cotton Lake has a diverse fish community that includes Bluegill, Black Crappie, Largemouth Bass, Northern Pike, Yellow Perch, and Walleye. Cotton Lake also contains Cisco, a coldwater species that requires cool, well oxygenated refuge areas during the heat of summer. \n\nWalleye fingerlings are stocked into Cotton Lake every other year and abundant year-classes of Walleye corresponded to years when stocking occurred.  At 3.8 fish per net in 2016, gill net catch for Walleye was below average for Cotton Lake but above what is expected for similar lakes. Sampled Walleyes ranged from 9.4 to 24.5 inches with an average length of 15.7 inches. \n\nA special regulation for Northern Pike was implemented on Cotton Lake in 2003. The regulation required the release of pike between 24 and 36 inches in length. After eight years the pike population did not show signs of improved size structure so the regulation was discontinued in 2011. Northern Pike gill net catch was 9.8 fish per net in 2016, which is near the historical average for Cotton Lake but above what is expected for similar lakes. Sampled Northern Pike ranged from 9.8 to 23.4 inches with a mean of 15.7 inches. As is the case with some other area lakes, Northern Pike numbers have increased in recent years while size and growth have decreased. Anglers are encouraged to keep smaller Northern Pike and release larger ones to help improve size structure. \n\nBluegill catch has remained well above both the historical average for the lake and what is expected for similar lakes. Bluegill trap net catch was 49.7 fish per net in 2016, and sampled fish ranged from 4.0 to 8.9 inches with a mean of 7.3 inches. On average, it was found that it takes Bluegill nine years to reach 8 inches. \n\nTrap net catch rate was 3.7 Black Crappies and 1.3 Largemouth Bass per set, both just above the historical averages for each species. Black Crappies ranged in length from 8.4 to 11.6 inches and averaged 9.6 inches.  Black Crappie were found to reach 10 inches in about 6-7 years.  Largemouth Bass ranged from 6.8 to 18.3 inches and averaged 14.4 inches.  \n\nYellow Perch catch was 13.3 fish per net. This catch is below the historical average of 23.6 fish per net but within what is expected for similar lakes. Mean Yellow Perch length was 8.4 inches, and lengths ranged from 5.2 to 11.1 inches. \n\nIn 2016, four Cisco were caught in gill nets, and they ranged in size from 16.7 to 18.7 inches. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Cotton Lake is a 1,763-acre lake located in Becker county 12 miles east of the city of Detroit Lakes. The lake possesses a heavily developed shoreline and receives high recreational use and fishing pressure from the surrounding area, particularly during the open water season. The Shelly Island Wildlife Management Area and the Cotton Lake Aquatic Management Area collectively protect 111 acres of land within and adjacent to Cotton Lake. The lake is moderately productive and maintains a robust fishery, providing angling opportunities for Walleye, Northern Pike, Bluegill, Largemouth Bass, and Black Crappie. A standard lake survey was completed on Cotton Lake in July 2021.     <br> \n <br> \nCatch rates of Walleye in Cotton Lake have varied over time, ranging from four to 13 Walleye per gill net.  The average catch rate of Walleye in 2021 was about five fish per gill net. Walleye sampled ranged in length from 8.4 to 22.6 inches, averaging 15.9 inches long. Walleye in Cotton Lake typically reach 15 inches in length by age four, exhibiting growth that is considered average in Minnesota lakes. <br> \nNorthern Pike catches have increased in Cotton Lake over time. During the 2021 survey the average catch rate of Northern Pike was almost 14 pike per gill net, slightly higher than the lake's historical average. Pike sampled in 2021 ranged in length from 10.0 to 28.9 inches, averaging 17.3 inches long. Only 1.2% of sampled Northern Pike were greater than or equal to 24 inches in length, indicative of a population persisting of an over-abundance of small to moderately sized pike.  <br> \n <br> \nCatch rates of Yellow Perch have remained between about ten and 20 perch pet gill net in the last six surveys. The average catch rate of Yellow Perch in 2021 was about 13 perch per gill net. Sampled perch ranged in length from 5.1 to 12.0 inches, averaging 8.4 inches long. Cotton Lake appears to have the possibility to provide an angling opportunity for Yellow Perch, a unique prospect in the Detroit Lakes Fisheries Management Area. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill catches in Cotton Lake have declined relative to past surveys. Although catch rates are lower, the size structure of Bluegill has improved in the last two surveys. The average catch rate of Bluegill in 2021 was about 12 fish per trap net. Sampled Bluegill ranged in length from 2.8 to 8.9 inches, averaging 6.1 inches long. Approximately 22% of the Bluegill sampled in trap nets were eight inches or longer, a substantial improvement from previous surveys. Bluegill in Cotton Lake exhibit relatively slow growth, requiring six years to reach six inches long.   <br> \nIn 2021, a total of ten Black Crappie were sampled ranging in length from 3.7 to 12.2 inches long. A total of 15 Largemouth Bass were caught in trap nets, ranging in length from 5.2 to 19.0 inches in length, averaging 11.8 inches long. Additional species sampled in Cotton Lake in 2021 included Brown Bullhead, Yellow Bullhead, hybrid sunfish, Green Sunfish, Pumpkinseed, Rock Bass, Cisco, and White Sucker.  <br> \n <br> \nAnglers can help maintain and improve Cotton Lake's fishery by harvesting small to moderately sized fish and releasing larger fish (specifically Northern Pike and Bluegill), as well as taking precautions to prevent the spread of invasive species. Shoreline owners can help to improve water quality and fish habit in the lake by maintaining shoreline buffer zones and leaving native aquatic vegetation stands intact.  </p>",
