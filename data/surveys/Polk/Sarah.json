                "narrative": "<p>Due to a lack of precipitation in this area of the state, Sarah Lake water levels have been receding since the mid-1980's.  Extensive areas of lake bottom have been exposed and former marsh areas of cattails and bulrushes are far from the water's edge.  Areas of mud and silt have been exposed to wave action that has increased lake turbidity, and the abundance of submerged macrophytes has diminished.  The entire fish community has apparently been impacted by the changes in habitat.  Gamefish species have suffered major declines while bullheads and white suckers have increased.  CPUE data illustrates the magnitude of change: NOP - from 8.66/set in 1986 to 0.67/set in 1991; BLG - 12.33/set to 4.40/set; WAE - 26.33/set to 13.33/set; YEP - 56.33/set to 4.00/set, in contrast to gamefish declines are BLB - 3.93/set to 8.60/set; BRB - 2.00/set to 5.60/set; WTS - 8.33/set to 18.67/set.  All species aged exhibited good growth rates.  Walleye ages indicate that stocked fish comprise the bulk of the walleye population.  No largemouth bass were taken in test nets but both adult and YOY were collected during shoreline seining.</p>",

This data will be analyzed in conjunction with the gill net and trap net survey completed in 2016 to provide a complete assessment of the fish community.  The assessment will then be used to evaluate the biological condition of Sarah Lake and contribute to the assessment of the watershed.  Similar sampling efforts occurred in 2017 and 2019. <br> \n <br> \nTen sites within Sarah Lake were sampled during this survey.  Eleven fish species were captured, two of which are species that are intolerant of poor habitat conditions (Iowa Darter and Log Perch).  The most common species sampled during this survey was Yellow Perch.  The results of this survey suggest that the fish community meet expectations, and is not biologically impaired.

This data will be analyzed in conjunction with the gill net and trap net survey completed in 2016 to provide a complete assessment of the fish community that will be used to evaluate the biological condition of Sarah Lake, and contribute to the assessment of the watershed.  Sampling gear utilized during this survey targets fish species not commonly sampled by gill nets and trap nets. <br> \nTen sites within Sarah Lake were sampled during this survey.  Electrofishing was conducted at all 10 sites, and seining was completed at eight sites.  Difficult sampling conditions prevented the use of seines at two sites.   <br> \nThirteen native fish species were sampled during this survey, two of which are species that are intolerant of poor habitat conditions (Iowa Darter and Log Perch).  The results of this survey, combined with results of the gill net and trap net survey done in 2016, indicate that the fish community in Sarah Lake meets expectations based on the characteristics of Sarah, and that the lake is not biologically impaired. <br> \n Shoreline habitat on Sarah Lake is sparse, likely a result of dramatic fluctuations in water level over the course of many years.  Despite the sparse shoreline habitat, the number of species sampled during this survey is high.  Protecting the remaining habitat may help ensure the long term health of this fish community.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Sarah's diverse fish community appears to be recovering from the drought in the early 1990s.  The drought left fish spawning, feeding, and cover habitat high and dry.  Specifically, bulrush stands and rock, rubble, and gravel areas were not available for fish to use when lake levels were low.  Also, the lake became more turbid since the silty substrate (normally too deep to be moved by wind) was subject to wave action with low water levels.  As a result, populations of northern pike, yellow perch, and bluegill decreased significantly during that period.  Black bullhead, a species that is favored by turbid water, thrived and increased during the drought.  Test netting in 1996, however, indicated that populations of northern pike, yellow perch, and bluegill are returning to more normal abundances.  A population of stocked walleyes remains higher than normal in abundance and average size (2.7 pounds) compared to lakes that are ecologically similar to Lake Sarah.  Growth rates are faster than normal for northern pike, walleye, and yellow perch and average for bluegill, black crappie, and largemouth bass in Lake Sarah.  Without further natural or cultural disturbance to beneficial fish habitat, the fish community should continue to recover to pre-drought conditions.With no outlet, it is important for riparian and watershed landowners to recognize that what goes into the lake, essentially stays in the lake.  Even though water quality and fish populations in Lake Sarah are considered relatively good at present, unchecked development-related pressures could negatively impact this small lake.  Nutrients, sediments, and other pollutants added to the system tend to result in more algal blooms, more turbid water, more rough fish, and fewer gamefish.  In general, there is a direct correlation between lower water quality and lower property value for lakeshore owners.Some ways in which property owners can help slow the eutrophication (aging) of the lake include the following.  (1) Leave stands of bulrush and other important vegetation intact.  If a path is needed through vegetation in order to reach open water, obtain a permit from DNR Fisheries.  (2) Leave wide shoreline buffer zones of unmown vegetation.  Don't mow right down to the water's edge.  (3) Don't fertilize lawns.  (4) Voluntarily exceed shoreline setbacks for septic systems and buildings if possible.  (5)  Continue to participate in the Pollution Control Agency's Citizen Lake-Monitoring Program (secchi disk monitoring).  (6) Seek advice and permits from DNR Waters when planning shoreline alterations.  Guides are available for shoreline landscaping methods that will help sustain the lake.  Try to keep a perspective on how water use goals can be achieved without sacrificing quality, the fish community, and property values.</p>",

This data will be analyzed in conjunction with the gill net and trap net survey completed in 2016 to provide a complete assessment of the fish community.  The assessment will then be used to evaluate the biological condition of Sarah Lake and contribute to the assessment of the watershed.  A similar sampling effort occurred in 2017. <br> \n <br> \nTen sites within Sarah Lake were sampled during this survey.  Eleven fish species were captured, two of which are species that are intolerant of poor habitat conditions (Iowa Darter and Log Perch).  The results of this survey suggest that the fish community does not meet expectations, and is potentially impaired.  Future surveys will be used to continue to monitor the fish community. <br> \n <br> \nShoreline habitat on Sarah Lake is sparse, likely a result of dramatic fluctuations in water level over the course of many years.  Despite the sparse shoreline habitat, the number of species sampled during this survey was high.  Protecting the remaining habitat may help ensure the long term health of this fish community.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>The fish community in this small (366 acre), Polk County lake has been impacted by both drought and high water conditions during the past.  As indicated by historical net catches, the low water conditions of the late 1980's and the early 1990's negatively impacted the fish community in Lake Sarah more than the recent high water levels. <br> \n <br> \nIn 2011, test nets revealed good catches of northern pike, walleye, and black crappie.  Pike were particularly abundant, though young.  High water tends to favor pike in most lakes since their preferred spawning habitat is flooded grasses.  Age and growth analysis of northern pike revealed signs of heavy fishing pressure.  Very few fish older than three or four years were found and growth rates were good.  Fortunately for anglers, the relatively rapid growth rates by gamefish and panfish in Lake Sarah have helped to sustain the fishery and the large number of small pike should soon provide angling opportunities. <br> \n <br> \nCurrently, there is a walleye stocking study in progress in this lake comparing walleye fry versus walleye fingerlings.  Indications are that fry stocking works very well in Lake Sarah and the relative cost of fry versus fingerlings would likely make it worthwhile to switch entirely to fry stocking.  The average walleye size was very acceptable at nearly 17 inches and just over 2.0 pounds. <br> \n <br> \nBluegills were present in modest numbers compared to other similar lakes, but sizes were quite good.  The average length of sampled bluegills was 7.7 inches and one fish well over 10 inches was found. <br> \n <br> \nAs a small, fertile lake, Sarah is vulnerable to development related impacts.  In the past 20 years, the number of shoreline homes and cabins has quadrupled from 36 to 144.  Unchecked development of the shoreline and surrounding watershed can increase the rate of eutrophication (aging) and tip the balance toward foul smelling algal blooms and a fish community dominated by black bullheads.  The loss of fish habitat that often results from shoreline development is a concern.  Clearing of bulrush, cattails, and other aquatic plants frequently occurs.  Sand is often placed on the shoreline.  These practices negatively affect water quality and fish populations, two of the things most important to lakeshore owners. <br> \n <br> \nLandowners are encouraged to practice shoreland best management practices to maintain property values, water quality, and fish populations.  Two excellent sources are available to help in landscaping a shoreline in the least damaging, most beneficial way.  \"Lakescaping for Wildlife and Water Quality\" and \"Restore Your Shore\" are available through the Minnesota Bookstore.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Sarah is a 366-acre lake located in Polk County four miles south of Erskine. This productive lake possesses a heavily developed shoreline and occasionally experiences large water level fluctuations.  Lake Sarah provides angling opportunities for Walleye, Northern Pike, Bluegill, and Black Crappie. A standard fisheries survey was completed on Lake Sarah in July 2021. A special regulation of 10 sunfish per day was implemented on the lake in March 2022. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance in 2021 was slightly higher than average but declined from the near record high observed in 2016.  Walleye measured in 2021 ranged in length from 9.5 to 29.2 inches, averaging 17.2 inches long. The average length of a four year old Walleye from Lake Sarah measured 16.2 inches, revealing above average growth.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike abundance was at a record high number in 2011 but have since declined over the last two surveys in 2016 and 2021.  Pike measured during the 2021 survey ranged in length from 14.1 to 36.7 inches, averaging 19.4 inches long. Eleven percent of pike had lengths of 24 inches or greater.  <br> \n <br> \nBluegill abundance was below average in 2021, with trap nets catching three fish per net. Sampled Bluegill ranged in length from 3.4 to 9.2 inches, averaging 4.8 inches long. Bluegill grow quickly in Lake Sarah, measuring roughly seven inches long by age four. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie abundance in Lake Sarah was moderate in 2021. Black Crappie ranged in length from 8.5 to 12.5 inches, averaging 10.4 inches long. Largemouth Bass have not been caught in Lake Sarah in significant numbers in historical lake survey assessments. Only one bass was caught in the 2021 survey. Yellow Perch abundance was low in Lake Sarah, with fish measuring five to eight inches long. Additional species sampled in 2021 included Black Bullhead, Brown Bullhead, and White Sucker. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers can help to maintain Lake Sarah's valuable fishery by voluntarily releasing a portion of medium to large sized fish (specifically Northern Pike and Bluegill) and harvesting smaller fish for eating. Shoreline owners can help to improve water quality and fish habitat in Lake Sarah by leaving shoreline buffer zones, leaving stands of native aquatic vegetation intact, and by using wise land management practices to reduce nonpoint source pollution.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>The fish community in this small (352 acre), Polk County lake has been impacted by both drought and high water conditions during the past decade.  As indicated by historical net catches, the low water conditions of the late 1980's and the early 1990's impacted the fish community in Lake Sarah much more negatively than the recent high water levels.In 2001, test nets revealed comparatively good catches of northern pike, walleye, and black crappie.  Age and growth analysis of these species revealed two key indicators of heavy fishing pressure in this lake.  First, there were very few fish older than three or four years.  Second, growth rates for all three species was faster than normal.  Fast growth and early maturation could simply signal an abundance of forage, but, it can also be a natural response to heavy fish harvest.  Since yellow perch catches dropped to zero in 2001 and since perch are the primary forage species for northern pike, walleye, and even largemouth bass in many lakes, the heavy fish harvest explanation is more likely to be correct.  Fortunately for anglers, the rapid growth rates by gamefish and panfish in Lake Sarah have helped to sustain the fishery.Bluegills were also present in modest numbers.  Though they were not abundant, their growth rates and average size were also greater than average compared to similar types of lakes.As a small, fertile, fish lake, Sarah is vulnerable to development related impacts.  Unchecked development of the shoreline and surrounding watershed can increase the rate of eutrophication (aging) and tip the balance toward smelly algal blooms and a fish community dominated by black bullheads.  The loss of fish habitat that often results from shoreline development is a concern.  Commonly, one of the first things a shoreline owner wants to do is create a swimming beach.  Bulrushes, cattails, and other beneficial plants are often illegally removed, tree snags and shoreline vegetation removed, and sand frequently dumped in shoal waters.  While this \"cleaning up\" may look like an improvement to the landowner, it degrades fish populations and water quality, two of the things most important to lakeshore owners.Landowners are encouraged to apply \"best management practices\" in order to maintain property values, water quality, and fish populations.  For those who feel the need to change things on their shoreline property, two excellent sources are available to help in landscaping a shoreline in the least damaging, most beneficial way.  These sources are the document \"Lakescaping for Wildlife and Water Quality\" and the computer CD \"Restore Your Shore\" available through the Minnesota Bookstore.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>The fish community in this small (352 acre), Polk County lake has been impacted by both drought and high water conditions during the past.  As indicated by historical net catches, the low water conditions of the late 1980's and the early 1990's negatively impacted the fish community in Lake Sarah more than the recent high water levels. <br> \n <br> \nIn 2006, test nets revealed good catches of northern pike, walleye, and black crappie.  Pike, crappie, and bluegill catch rates were at their historic highs for Lake Sarah.  Age and growth analysis of these species revealed signs of heavy fishing pressure.  Very few fish older than three or four years were found and growth rates for all three species were good.  Fortunately for anglers, the relatively rapid growth rates by gamefish and panfish in Lake Sarah have helped to sustain the fishery. <br> \n <br> \nCurrently, there is a walleye stocking study in progress in this lake comparing walleye fry versus walleye fingerlings.  This study will continue for at least one more survey rotation (5 years) to complete the evaluation.  Early indications are that fry stocking works very well in Lake Sarah since 60% of sampled walleyes were attributed to the 2004 year class (the first fry stocking year).  Even with the large number of young walleyes, the average walleye size was still quite acceptable at 15.2 inches and 1.4 pounds. <br> \n <br> \nBluegills were present in moderate numbers compared to other similar lakes, but historic high numbers compared to past reports from this lake.  Like several other fish species in Lake Sarah, the bluegill population was comprised of mostly young fish.  Although some fish over eight inches were found, small fish were much more prevalent in 2006. <br> \n <br> \nAs a small, fertile lake, Sarah is vulnerable to development related impacts.  In the past 15 years, the number of shoreline homes and cabins has quadrupled from 36 to 144.  Unchecked development of the shoreline and surrounding watershed can increase the rate of eutrophication (aging) and tip the balance toward foul smelling algal blooms and a fish community dominated by black bullheads.  The loss of fish habitat that often results from shoreline development is a concern.  Clearing of bulrush, cattails, and other aquatic plants frequently occurs.  Sand is often placed on the shoreline.  These practices negatively affect water quality and fish populations, two of the things most important to lakeshore owners. <br> \n <br> \nLandowners are encouraged to practice shoreland best management practices to maintain property values, water quality, and fish populations.  Two excellent sources are available to help in landscaping a shoreline in the least damaging, most beneficial way.  \"Lakescaping for Wildlife and Water Quality\" and \"Restore Your Shore\" are available through the Minnesota Bookstore. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Sarah is a small (366 acres), eutrophic, Polk County lake that is prone to substantial water level changes. Some of the most drastic fish catch rate fluctuations coincided with the drought in the late 1980s and early 1990s when emergent vegetation was stranded above the shoreline and submerged vegetation decreased. Water levels were low again during the summer survey in 2016.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleyes were introduced in Lake Sarah in 1974, and fry are currently stocked every other year. In 2016, the Walleye gill net catch rate was extremely high (24.3 fish per net) and over twice the historical average. Mean Walleye length was 17.5 inches and size ranged from 9.5 to 27.2 inches. The 1986 survey, which occurred during the previous period of low water, also had a similarly high Walleye gill net catch rate (26.3 fish per net).  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike gill net catch rate was also high at 23.5 fish per net. This catch rate is over twice the historical mean and well above what is expected for similar lakes. Average length of gill netted Northern Pike was 22.0 inches and ranged from 15.9 to 32.8.  <br> \n <br> \nAlthough Yellow Perch were present, gill net catch rate remained lower than the lake's historical average (21.4 fish per net) at 5.7 per net. The average length of sampled perch was 6.2 inches and size ranged from 5.6 to 7.0 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nTrap net catch was 10.7 Bluegills per net, nearly equal to the lake's historical average and within what is expected for similar lakes. The mean length of sampled Bluegills was 6.9 inches and lengths ranged from 2.9 to 9.7 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nTrap net catch of Black Crappies increased to a historic high of 5.2 fish per net. Black Crappie length ranged from 8.1 to 12.6 inches with an average of 9.2 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass have only been present in trap nets in three of the nine Fisheries surveys conducted on Lake Sarah. A single 16.9 inch bass was sampled by trap net in 2016, and fourteen were captured electrofishing. Electrofished bass ranged from 10.7 to 17.8 inches with a mean of 14.5 inches. </p>",
