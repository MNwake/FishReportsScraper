                "narrative": "<p>Black Crappie are primary management species with Northern Pike and Bluegill being considered secondary management species.  The 2010 lake management plan had goals of maintaining a Black Crappie gill net or trap net catch rate >3.5/net with size structure indices characterized by 90% greater than 8 inches, 50% greater than10 inches and 10% greater than 12 inches and a Bluegill trap net catch rate <6.1/net with size structure indices characterized by a 80% greater than 6 inches, 40% greater than 8 inches and 10% greater than 10 inches.  The lake is passively managed through statewide regulations.  This was one of many surveys conducted to assess the status of the fish population. <br> \n <br> \nTrap net catches for Black Crappie have been above average for lakes with comparable habitat, sometimes well above the expected range.  The catch was similar to the management plan goal.  Size structure was fair and similar to the previous survey, though short of the ambitious management goal.  Lengths ranged from 5.6 to 11.5 inches with an average length of 8.5 inches.  Age determination identified ages 2 to 4 and 6 to 8.  Recruitment seemed somewhat sporadic.  Age 4 comprised 55% of the expanded age frequency.  Growth was below average for all ages.  Black Crappie averaged almost 9 inches by age 5. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill catches have typically been lower than expected compared to lakes of similar habitat, but have increased in recent surveys.  The 2018 catch was low but still comparable to lakes with similar habitat and the previous survey.  The catch was close to management goals while size structure was short.  Lengths ranged from 3.2 to 9.5 inches with an average length of 6.1 inches.  Age analysis identified ages 2 to 8, though ages 2 to 4 were well represented, containing 87% of the expanded age frequency.  Growth surpassed the lake class averages and was similar to the previous survey.  Bluegill averaged 7.8 inches by age 5. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike are well suited for the lake, being one of the most abundant in gill nets and similar to the previous survey.  Size structure was moderate and similar to the previous survey.  Lengths ranged from 14.6 to 32.8 with an average length 23.5 inches.  Fish within the north central protected slot regulation (22\" to 26\") comprised 40% of the catch.  Ages 1 to 8 were represented and distribution was somewhat sporadic.  Age 4 comprised 32% of the expanded age frequency.  Growth was similar to the statewide averages for all ages with fish averaging 23.1 inches by age 4. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch catches have exceeded the expected range for similar lakes in all surveys, including the most recent.  Size structure was poor with very few fish caught over 8 inches sampled and no fish over 10 inches, and similar to previous surveys.  Lengths ranged from 5.2 to 9.9 inches with an average length of 7.0 inches. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye are not well suited for lakes with comparable habitat.  Only a few Walleye have been caught in the surveys, despite past stocking efforts and surplus stocking by LLIR.  Four Walleye were caught with lengths from 22.1 to 25.2 inches in 2018. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled include Bowfin, Brown Bullhead, Hybrid Sunfish, Largemouth Bass, Pumpkinseed Sunfish and White Sucker. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Little Ball Club Lake is located about 12 miles northwest of Deer River, MN, within the Chippewa National Forest, and within the Mississippi River Headwaters Watershed. The 184 acre lake has 82 littoral acres with a 30 foot max depth, and is relatively undeveloped.  Diverse aquatic plant life can be found along the 2.5 mile shoreline.  The U.S. Forest Service administered earthen public access is located on the west side of the lake with parking availability for about 4 rigs.  Little Ball Club is connected to Tuttle Lake to the north. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie were sampled in gill nets at a rate lower than the previous assessment, and at the low end of the expected range for lakes similar to Little Ball Club.  However, the trap net catch (11.6/net) was significantly higher than the expected range (0.7-3.4/net) and the previous assessment (5.2/net).  The high trap net catch rate and the lower gill net catch rate is likely related to the cool spring, in which more fish were in the shallows at the time of the assessment.  Size structure appeared good with lengths ranging from 7.2-12.6 inches and an average length of 9.3 inches in the trap net sample.  Recruitment appeared reasonably consistent with scale analysis identifying consecutive age classes from age 3-7.  Ages 3 and 4 were well represented, comprising 31% and 58% of the catch, respectively.  Growth was similar to the statewide average with fish averaging nine inches by age 4. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike were sampled at a gill net rate near the high end of the expected range, however it was less than the historical high of the previous assessment (12.8/net).  Size structure appeared moderately poor with 19% of the sample exceeding 24 inches.  Lengths ranged from 14.1-29.2 inches with an average length of 20.5 inches.  Scale and bone analysis indicated that six ages were present with fish up to age 7 in the sample.  Growth was near the statewide average with fish averaging 24 inches by age 5. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch were sampled in gill nets at a rate near the high end of the expected range, similar to the previous assessment.  Lengths of perch were typically too small to interest anglers with an average length of 6.8 inches.  Forty one perch were externally examined for parasites with yellow grub having a 98% occurrence and neascus (black spot) having an 83% occurrence.  Scale analysis indicated eight age classes present with fish up to age 9 present.  Growth started out similar to the statewide average, but slowed by age 8 to less than 15% of the statewide average. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill were sampled at a historically high rate of 11.2/trap net, within the expected range.  Similar to crappie, the high net catch is likely related to the cool spring, in which more fish were in the shallows at the time of the assessment.  The previous assessment sampled bluegill at a rate of 4.2/trap net.  Size structure appeared moderate.  Scale analysis identified seven consecutive age classes with fish up to age 9 present.  By age 2, growth exceeded the statewide lake class 31 average. <br> \n <br> \nThis was the first assessment walleye were not sampled in gill nets, however one was sampled in a trap net (19.9 inches).  Other species sampled include black bullhead, bowfin, brown bullhead, hybrid sunfish, pumpkinseed sunfish, white sucker, and yellow bullhead.  Trap nets also sampled eighteen painted turtles and two snapping turtles which had a mean length of almost ten inches. <br> \n</p>",

However the average size for these walleyes is around 2.3 lbs.     The northern pike population has remained stable over the years and shows good average growth.  The average size of these fish is around 2.6 pounds.     The yellow perch numbers have increased over the years with a few fish reaching 8 inches.     Bluegill numbers have increased slightly over past years, but numbers are still below average for this type of lake.     Black crappies are also present with fish ranging from 7 to 12 inches in length.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Little Ball Club Lake is located 10 miles northwest of Deer River, MN.  The lake averages 16 ft deep with a maximum depth of 30 ft.  The lake is highly productive and is managed primarily for largemouth bass and panfish.Shoreline electrofishing sampled 3 largemouth bass for a catch rate of 2.5/h which is slightly lower than similar lakes in the Grand Rapids area.  Electrofishing is a relatively new technique which may be subject to high variability, thus it is difficult to make conclusions with only a few samples.  Although the sample size was too small to calculate size structure indices, the three fish sampled were large fish between 17 and 18 inches.The bluegill trap-net catch was 4.2/set which is slightly below the expected range for similar lakes.  In bluegill populations, low abundance is often favorable because high abundance can lead to poor growth and size structure.  Although the abundance was not high in Little Ball Club Lake, the size structure was good with several fish over 8 inches sampled.  Anglers are often unaware that bluegill grow slowly compared to other species.  On average it takes 7 to 8 years for bluegill to reach 8 inches.  Because it takes so long to replace an 8 inch or better bluegill, anglers should consider releasing a portion of their catch. Black crappie trap-net catch was 5.2/set which was higher than the expected range.  The gill-net catch was 2.5/set which is within the expected range.  The trap-net size structure was good with several fish over 10 inches sampled.  Growth was slightly below statewide averages for ages 1 and 2 and slightly above statewide averages for ages 4 and 5.  Black crappie reach preferred length of 10 inches in 5 years.Northern pike gill-net catch was 12.8/set which was higher than the expected range.  Size structure was generally poor with no fish larger than preferred length of 28 inches.    Walleye gill-net catch was 0.5/set which is lower than the expected range.  The trap-net catch was 0.7/set which is equal to the upper level of the expected range.  Based on the ageing data, a single fish was sampled from the 1995 and 1994 year classes, and 5 fish were sampled from the 1991 and 1990 year classes combined.  It appears that natural reproduction is sporadic, and based on previous netting history stocked walleye do not provide a significant fishery.</p>",
