Historical records indicate the pit began filling with water in the 1970's, and water depth in the pit currently exceeds 280 feet.  Lind pit lies near several other mine pit lakes, including Canisteo Mine Pit.  Canisteo Pit also has long history of rising water levels.  Water levels in Canisteo could eventually go high enough to reach the rim of the pit and form a natural outlet.  Several options for where to divert the overflow water are being considered.  An additional complication is that Canisteo Pit contains a population of rainbow smelt, an exotic species.  One proposal is to divert the water from Canisteo to the Prairie River via several mine pits, including Lind Pit.  This assessment was conducted to determine what fish species existed in Lind Pit and if rainbow smelt were already present.   <br> \n <br> \nThree standard experimental gill nets, one small mesh (smelt) gill net and two standard lake survey trap nets were set overnight.  No rainbow smelt were captured.  Net catches for the other species were generally low and included black crappie, bluegill, largemouth bass, pumpkinseed, smallmouth bass and white sucker.  White sucker was the most common species in the gill nets, with a catch rate of 4.3/net.  Smallmouth bass was the most common predator species, with a catch rate of 1.0/gill net.  Captured smallmouth bass ranged from 13.4 to 16.6 inches.  The other previous fish assessment on Lind Pit (1990) only captured black crappie and common shiners. <br> \n</p>",
