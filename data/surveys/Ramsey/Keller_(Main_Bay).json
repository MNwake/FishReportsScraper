The lake receives a high amount of fishing pressure (423.9 hours/acre) with over 90% of the angling from the shoreline.  Recreational boating adds another 177.1 hours/acre of use.The fish population is dominated by bluegill, with fish up to 7.8 inches long present.  A tenth of the fish measured at least 7.0 inches long.  Other sunfish species were present in lower numbers, with few of acceptable size to anglers.  Crappie numbers are very low, with no fish of significant size.  Largemouth bass numbers are high, but only small fish were captured.  Yellow bullhead numbers are low with some larger fish present.  Yellow perch were present in average numbers but were of small size.  No northern pike, walleye, or carp were sampled.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>White sucker, golden shiner, bluegill, and black crappie were each judged to have high populations.  The catch rate for each species was above the third quartile of the range of the local median for appropriate gear.  Utilizing the same type of judgment, yellow perch, walleye, carp, black bullhead, yellow bullhead, largemouth bass, pumpkinseed and white crappie were found in expected numbers, that is not significantly different from the local median.The bluegill catch rate is lower in 1981 than in 1976 (87.8/lift vs. 137.6/lift).  In 1981 the length-frequency range is broader (3.0-7.4 inches) than found in 1976 (4.0-6.4).  The modal length group was 5.0-5.4 inches in 1976, while it was bimodal at 6.0-6.4 and 6.5-6.9 inches in 1981.  The median length group for bluegill measured (70) in 1981 was one inch longer at 6.0-6.4 inches than for those measured in 1976 (125) which was 5.0-5.4 inches.  While it is difficult to precisely determine if a decline in the population has occurred, it does appear that there has been a slight increase in size.  Mean weight for all bluegill taken in 1976 (705 fish weighing 75.85 pounds) was 0.107 pounds while all bluegill taken in 1981 (450 fish weighing 67.5 pounds) was 0.15 pounds.The white crappie catch is much reduced in 1981 from 1976 levels and a marked change in the length frequency distribution is apparent.  In 1981 no white crappie less than 7.5 inches was taken while in 1976 this size fish accounted for 96% of all white crappie measured.The trapnet catch of black crappie is somewhat higher in 1981 (43.2/lift) than in 1976 (23.6) but it is not thought to indicate a dramatic change, if any.  Length frequency distributions are not greatly different.No dramatic differences in the catches of carp, black or yellow bullhead, yellow perch or pumpkinseed are evident.  White sucker and golden shiner numbers in 1981 give the appearance of a decrease since 1976 but the length frequency distributions show the same general pattern for both years.  It is doubtful that such differences reflect a true decrease in numbers.Remarkable by their absence in the catch are northern pike.  In 1976 a catch of 6.5 fish per gillnet lift was found.  Since identical net locations were used in both nettings, it is remarkable that none were taken in 1981.  Factors such as time of year, temperature/oxygen profiles and water clarity are all similar.Walleye were found in rather good numbers (3.0/gillnet lift).  These fish were not stocked but are most likely migrants from Lake Phalen downstream which has been stocked since 1979.  Walleye are also known from Gervais Lake which is broadly connected to Keller Lake.  The walleye populations of Keller Lake must be considered transient in nature and dependent on both the success of Lake Phalen stockings and water levels which allow migration.Orange-spotted sunfish are a rather unusual occurrence in lakes in the Metro Region.  They are not known from either Gervais or Phalen lakes but have been sampled in Willow Lake in the watershed.  Their small size would make them easily overlooked or confused with other small sunfish and their hybrids.  The shallow nature of Keller Lake is more conducive to their survival than the other lakes, which are deeper, and considered more permanent in their fish populations.  Orange-spotted sunfish were previously known to be present since they appeared in limited numbers in the 1977 creel census.</p>",

All bluegill aged were III+ annulus fish showing good growth.  Black crappie were present in 4 year classes showing average growth.  White crappie are present in 3 year classes with I+ annulus fish being most abundant.  Yellow perch, yellow bullhead, and hybrid sunfish are present in numbers above statewide median but below the median pounds per set.  Yellow perch appeared as II+ and III+ annulus fish, more being II+.  They showed average growth.  Carp, black and brown bullhead and pumpkinseed are present in numbers and weight below the median.

Their average length sampled was only 6.2 inches. Yellow perch are of average abundance but they are also small. Both black and yellow bullheads are present in low numbers in Keller Lake, but their size makes up for a lack of abundance. A few walleyes were sampled during this survey. They are not stocked in this lake, but can make their way downstream from Gervais Lake, or up stream from Lake Phalen. Largemouth bass numbers dropped since the last survey, but the average size has increased.  </p>",
