The black crappie, bluegill, and pumpkinseed all had low median figures but are more than sufficient for reproduction purposes.  The black, brown, and yellow bullheads all were below their respective median figures.  The largemouth bass while absent in the net catches did show up fairly well in the shoreline seining.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Big Pine Lake is a fertile, 387 acre lake located in Pine and Aitkin counties. The lake averages 14 feet with a 22 foot maximum. Water clarity is generally good with a light bog stain, though algae blooms are not uncommon. Lake users can access Big Pine through the public access on the north end of the lake or from the north end of Pine Lake. While natural reproduction of Walleye has occurred, due to limited spawning habitat, Walleye fingerlings are stocked annually.   <br> \n <br> \nAnglers on North Big Pine can expect moderate fishing pressure. Walleye abundance has decreased since peaking in the 1994 assessment.  Northern Pike are slightly more numerous.  Abundance of both species is below the normal range for the lake class while their average size exceeds the norm. Northerns averaged 25.4 inches and 3.3 pounds. Walleyes ranged from 11.9 to 27.6 inches and averaged 3.3 pounds. Largemouth Bass are in good quantity and of quality size. Bass averaged 15 inches and 1.9 pounds. Yellow Perch are slightly more abundant than five years ago with a catch rate exceeding the lake class norm for the first time since 1999. Perch continue to function primarily as a forage species due to their small sizes. The Bluegill and Black Crappie numbers are more than adequate to warrant angling, with more harvestable sized individuals sampled than in the previous assessment.</p>",

The yellow perch while still high at 58.33 per set, showed a significant decline of 57.20% from 136.22 per set in 1980.  The bluegill at (20.83), pumpkinseed (0.83), and black crappie (4.33) per set all had low median figures and were of a fair average size.  The black bullhead was about average at 24.17 per set while the yellow and brown bullheads were low at 3.17 and 0.33 per set respectively.  All the bullheads were of a fair to good average size.  The white sucker was high at 5.89 in the gillnet and very high at 16.83 per set in the trapnet.  The northern redhorse and golden shiner had very low population figures.  The largemouth bass has shown well historical as young of the year in most shoreline results.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>North Big Pine Lake is a fertile, 387 acre lake located in Pine and Aitkin counties.  The lake averages 14 feet with a 22 foot maximum.  Water clarity is generally good with a light bog stain, though algae blooms are not uncommon.  Lake users can access North Big Pine through the public access on the north end of the lake or from South Big Pine Lake.   While natural reproduction of walleye does occur, due to limited spawning habitat, walleye fingerlings are stocked biennially.   <br> \n <br> \nAnglers on North Big Pine can expect moderate fishing pressure.  Walleye abundance has decreased in each assessment since 1994.   Northern pike are more numerous and larger than in the past.  Northerns averaged 28.6 inches and 5.8 pounds with more than a third of the catch topping 30 inches.  Largemouth bass numbers are good and of quality size.  Bass averaged 13.4 inches and ranged from 8.6 to 19.3 inches.  Yellow perch are slightly more abundant than five years ago, but remain small, functioning primarily as a forage species.  Bluegill and black crappie numbers are more than adequate to warrant angling, but size may be an issue with some anglers.  The trapnet sample found few crappies greater than 9 inches and few bluegills larger than 7 inches.  <br> \n</p>",

Big Pine Lake was electrofished the night of October 11, 2023, to evaluate the relative abundance of young of the year Walleye.  Similar to past fall assessments, the catch rate was low with only 10 age-0 Walleye per hour captured.  Age-0 Walleye ranged from 5.7 to 8.1 inches in length with a 7.4-inch average.  Age-1 Walleye were sampled at a rate of 12 per hour.  Age-1 Walleye ranged in length from 8.3 to 10.1 inches and had a 8.9-inch average. The possibility of natural Walleye reproduction and the low stocking rate makes the fry stocking's contribution to the 2023 Walleye year class unknown.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>North Big Pine Lake is a fertile, 387 acre lake located in Pine and Aitkin counties.  The lake averages 14 feet with a 22 foot maximum.  Water clarity is generally good with a light bog stain, though algae blooms are not uncommon.  Lake users can access North Big Pine through the public access on the north end of the lake or from South Big Pine lake.   While natural reproduction does occur, due to limited spawning habitat, walleye fingerlings are stocked biennially.  Anglers on North Big Pine can expect moderate fishing pressure.  Walleye abundance is typical for the lake type but both size structure and catch rate were lower in 2004 than in the recent assessments.  Despite past evidence of natural reproduction, scale aging attributed all sampled walleye to stocking years.  Northern pike numbers are below normal for the lake type but quality sized northern pike dominanted the netting with most fish over 24 inches.  Largemouth bass numbers are very good with an increase in quality.  Bass averaged 14.2 inches and ranged from 11.1 to 18.2 inches.  Yellow perch are far less abundant than five years ago, but remain small, functioning primarily as a forage species.  Bluegill and black crappie numbers are more than adequate to warrant angling, but size may be an issure with some anglers.  The trapnet sample found few crappies greater than 9 inches and few bluegill larger than 7 inches.    </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Big Pine Lake is a fertile 399 acre lake located in Pine and Aitkin Counties. The lake averages 14 feet with a 22 foot maximum. Water clarity is generally good with a light bog stain. Lake users can access Big Pine through the public access on the north end of the lake or from the north end of Pine Lake.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye fingerlings are stocked in Big Pine Lake every other year. The 2022 catch rate for walleye was 2.0 fish per net, an increase from the previous two surveys. Lengths ranged from 9.8 inches to 23.1 inchs, with an average length of 13.5 inches. Walleye over 15 inches in length comprised 33 percent of the total gill net catch. Eight of the 15 Walleye that were aged were from non stocked years, indicating that a small amount of natural reproduction occurs in the Pine Lake system. <br> \n <br> \nThe Northern Pike catch rate (1.8/net) met the lake management goal, but is still well below similar lakes in the area.  Average size of pike was 3.9 pounds  in 2022. Measured pike ranged between 18.3 inches to 32.5 inches and averaged 26.0 inches in 2022. Pike over 26 inches in length comprised 50 percent of the total gill net catch. <br> \nYellow Perch abundance was extremely high during the 2022 survey, with 45.0 fish per net compared to 40 per net lift in 2014. Perch numbers were high for the second consecutive survey.  Perch size structure was between 5.2 inches and 8.0 inches. Average length was 6.4 inches. <br> \n <br> \nNighttime electrofishing sampled 26 Largemouth Bass, yielding a catch rate of 32.4 per hour in 2022 compared to 69.2 per hour in 2014. Bass ranged from 7.3 to 19.1 inches with a 14.5 inch average. Average weight of all bass was 2.0 lbs . Bass over 14 inches included 53 percent of the total catch. Anglers can expect to catch good numbers of moderate sized bass on Big Pine Lake. <br> \n <br> \nCompared with similar lakes in the area, Black Crappie numbers were high respectively. Quality size fish were present, with 52% of black crappies surpassing the 9 inch mark. Lengths ranged from 4.5 inches to 11.1 inches with average length at 9.0 inches. In the past three years anglers have been targeting crappies during the winter months with good success. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill abundance in trap nets was 6.0 fish per net in 2022. Thirty eight percent of the catch exceeded 7 inches compared to 24% in 2014. Lengths ranged from 3.1 inches to 8.5 inches with average length at 6.5 inches. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>North Big Pine Lake, and its connected neighbor South Big Pine, are examples of lakes that have responded well to walleye stocking.  Walleye were stocked occasionally prior to 1980 to supplement natural reproduction, but walleye populations remained low.  Since 1980, stocking has been on a nearly annual basis and walleye numbers have increased to higher-than-normal levels for this type of lake.  Regular stocking has produced a variety of sizes up to 28 inches.  Large numbers of eight to eleven inch walleyes, combined with a substantially reduced perch population, could provide good walleye action for anglers in the next few years.     Panfish (sunfish and crappie) numbers tend to fluctuate from year to year in this lake, which is fairly typical.  Unlike many area lakes which often have high numbers of small bluegills, North Big Pine has generally fewer bluegills but larger sizes; average length is 6.7 inches, with good numbers of 7-8 inch fish. Numbers of black crappies are average for this type of lake. Average sizes will vary from year to year as different year-classes are dominant; the average weight in 1994 was half a pound.  Crappies netted in the 1994 survey could be divided into two size groups, one averaging six inches and one averaging eleven inches.     Largemouth bass maintain good numbers in this lake due to adequate spawning habitat.  Some bass are up to 3 1/2 pounds, although one-pound bass, about 13 inches in length, are far more common.     Northern pike are not abundant in this lake, but the population maintains itself through natural reproduction.  These pike are fairly fast-growing and provide an occasional trophy to the angler.     Stories persist in local folklore about the \"Pine Lake Monster\".  Actually, these stories may be based on occasional sightings and/or catches of large lake sturgeon in the lake.  These long-lived \"monster\" fish are rare, however, and there has been concern about a possible decline in the population of sturgeon in the Kettle River, to which the Pine River is a tributary.

                "narrative": "<p>  North and South Big Pine Lakes are two distinct bodies of water located along the Aitkin and Pine County border.  These two lakes are roughly equal in size, the north lake being 387 acres and the south lake 372 acres.  The two lakes are connected by a channel that allows free movement of fish between the lakes.  A lake survey was conducted in late July and early August on North Big Pine Lake.  Nine gillnets and six trapnets were set in order to obtain information regarding the present fish population.  Shoreline seining was performed in mid-August to evaluate natural fish reproduction. \n  Based on respective local medians and other comparative data the fish population can be characterized as follows:  The northern pike net catch (3.00/set) has shown a real increase from the previous survey in 1984 (1.56/set), but remains below the local median of (3.50/set).  According to past survey reports the northern pike net catch has never been above the local median catch, however, it has increased steadily without a decline since 1956 when the catch was 0.33/set.  The length frequency distribution ranged from 16.0 to 29.9 inches with a median length group of 22.0-22.9 inches.  A median length group of 24.0-24.9 inches was recorded in 1984.  The mean weight in 1989 was 2.75 pounds as compared to 3.14 pounds in 1984 and 3.22 pounds in 1980.  A total of twenty-seven (27) fish were aged representing age groups III-V.  All age groups exhibited normal growth rates in comparison to statewide averages. \n  The walleye (11.00/set) net catch also indicated a real increase since the previous survey (4.11/set) and is well above the local median of (2.73/set).  The 1989 net catch was the highest recorded as compared to seven previous survey reports.  The length frequency distribution had a range of 9.5 to 31.9 inches with 16.0-16.9 as a median length group. The median length group in 1984 was smaller at 12.0- 12.9 inches, however, the mean weight in 1984 was 1.74 pounds as compared to 1.43 pounds in 1989.  This length/weight discrepancy is due to several (8) 25.0 to 27.9 inch fish being weighed in 1984 bringing the mean weight up.  Ninety-eight (98) walleyes were aged representing age groups II-VIII.  Two very old fish were present in the sample (12 and 18 years old).  Walleyes from all age groups displayed normal growth rates.  In general, the walleye population corresponds with the stocking record and natural reproduction is believed to be an increasingly important factor as evidenced by the strong year class of 1986.  Twenty-seven (27) age III fish were netted even though an intentional stocking gap was left in 1986. \n  Yellow perch net catches (166.60/set) also showed a real increase from the previous survey (58.33/set) and remain much above the local median catch of (8.58/set).  The yellow perch population has historically been quite high and always considerably higher than the local median.  A median length group of 5.5-5.9 inches was found and fish ranged in length from 5.0 to 9.4 inches.  Age groups III-VIII were represented by the thirty-eight (38) fish aged. \n  The black crappie trapnet catch (2.00/set) was down from the previous survey (4.33/set), and was below the local median catch of (5.75/set).  Black crappie net catches have been decreasing steadily since 1976 according to past survey records.  Fish size has declined since the past survey as the median length group in 1984 was 8.5-8.9 inches in comparison to 4.0-4.4 inches in 1989.  Mean weight has also declined from 0.44 pounds in 1984 to 0.17 pounds in 1989. The length frequency distribution during the recent survey ranged from 3.5 to 10.9 inches.  Nineteen (19) fish were aged representing most age groups from I-VIII.  Age groups II, VI and VIII exhibited growth rates slower than normal while the other age groups grew at normal rates. \n  The bluegill sunfish (16.50/set) net catch was down from the previous survey (20.83/set) and fell below the local median catch of (20.00/set).  The population has remained relatively stable since 1980 when the catch was (17.00/set). The length frequency distribution ranged from 3.0 to 9.4 inches.  Seventy-one percent (71%) of the fish captured were 5.4 inches or less in length.  The median length group was 4.0-4.4 inches as compared to 6.0-6.4 inches in 1984.  Mean weight has been decreasing since 1980 when it was 0.23 pounds, mean weights in 1984 and 1989 were 0.18 pounds and 0.07 pounds respectively.  All age groups I-VIII were represented by the forty-two (42) fish that were aged.  Age groups III - VI displayed slower than normal growth rates.  Normal growth rates were exhibited by the remaining age groups.  \n  Pumpkinseed sunfish net catches (7.00/set) increased from the previous survey (0.83/set), and were above the local median catch of (2.67/set).  The length frequency distribution ranged from 2.5 to 7.4 inches with a median length group of 4.5 - 4.9 inches.  Twenty- seven (27) fish were aged representing age groups I-VII.  Slow growth rates were exhibited by age groups I-VI.  \n  Two smallmouth bass were caught in gillnets.  The two fish were 11.1 and 11.2 inches in length and were aged at four (4) and six (6) years old respectively. \n  A single 10.5 inch largemouth bass was captured in a gillnet.  The fish was aged at three (3) years old.  Young of the year largemouth bass were caught in shoreline seines indicating a reproducing population of adults and also young year classes. \n  Seven additional species of fish were taken by test netting including, (white sucker, shorthead redhorse, chestnut lamprey, black bullhead, yellow bullhead, brown bullhead, and rock bass). White sucker and brown bullhead had net catches above local medians.  The white sucker net catch (9.22/set) has increased steadily since 1980 when the catch was (3.89/set).  Black bullheads, yellow bullhead, rock bass, and shorthead redhorse all had net catches below local median levels.  The black bullhead population showed a considerable reduction as the net catch fell from (24.17/set) in 1984 to (0.50/set) in 1989.  Shorthead redhorse were absent from any previous survey reports and were captured in test nets for the first time in 1989. \n  Shoreline seining efforts produced young of year bluegill sunfish, black crappie, and yellow perch in addition to the largemouth bass mentioned previously.\n\n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>North Big Pine Lake is a fertile 387-acre lake located in Pine and Aitkin Counties west of the town of Finlayson.  The lake is connected to South Big Pine by a narrow navigable channel.  Both lakes lie within the 1837 ceded territory.  Access to the lake can be obtained through a DNR-owned public access located along the north end of South Big Pine Lake and through a DOT-owned public access located along the north end of North Big Pine Lake off State Highway 18.  A long, narrow shape and moderately deep water depths are characteristic of both basins.  North Big Pine Lake has a mean depth of about 14 feet and a maximum depth of 22 feet while South Big Pine Lake has a mean depth of about 16 feet and a maximum depth of 27 feet.  The majority of the shoreline is surrounded by residential homes and land use within the watershed consists of mostly wooded land with some agricultural land located to the west of both lakes. The agricultural land is drained by Strawberry Creek, which is an inlet to South Big Pine Lake.  The fishery, in both North and South Big Pine Lakes, is managed primarily for walleye and northern pike with largemouth bass, black crappie, and bluegill sunfish as the secondary management species.In 1998, a decision by the United States Supreme Court upheld the hunting and fishing rights of eight bands of Chippewa Indians within the 1837 ceded territory.  On lakes in the ceded territory that are likely to undergo spearing or netting by the bands, creel surveys and special regulations have been and will continue to be utilized to monitor non-band fish harvest and to ensure that the safe harvest level is not exceeded.  The safe harvest level is the level at which enough walleye reach maturity to maintain the longterm health and productivity of a fish population.  The combined catch of band and non-band anglers will not be allowed to exceed the safe harvest level.  Currently, North and South Big Pine Lakes have a 16 inch minimum size limit, which allows harvest of six walleye at or above 16 inches in length and one over 24 inches.  This regulation was put into place during the spring of 1997 to ensure that the safe harvest level is not exceeded.  This was the first time a special regulation was implemented on North and South Big Pine Lakes.  Implementation or modification of future special regulations will be based on the percentage of the harvestable surplus the bands declare, which can be anywhere from 0-50%, and the projected non-band angler harvest, which is based on previous creel surveys.  These regulations will be announced in newspapers during the spring and posted at public access sites on affected lakes.During the open water season of 1999, a standard lake survey was conducted to evaluate the current status of the fish population, the physical, chemical, and biological factors concerning habitat, and the water quality.  Sampling gear types consisted of spring and fall night electrofishing, gill and trap netting, and shoreline seining.  Walleye numbers and average size, at 1.4 pounds, were normal for this type of lake.  Historical abundance levels dating back to 1980 have been either normal or above normal for this lake.  Measured walleye ranged from 9.9 to 23.7 inches with an average length of 16.5 inches.  Walleye growth was typical of normal when compared to statewide averages.  Currently, walleye fingerling stocking by MN DNR Fisheries takes place on an alternate year basis.  Year classes from both stocked and non-stocked years were found during the 1999 survey.  It was previously thought that the contribution of natural fish to the population was negligible, but recent electrofishing evaluations targeting young-of-the-year walleye and the presence of year classes during non-stocked years show some successful natural reproduction of walleye, which indicates that the contribution of natural fish to the population may be more than what was previously thought.  However, stocking fingerlings provides supplemental fish to the population and is necessary for sustaining a suitable walleye fishery.  The 1999 northern pike catch was below normal for a lake of this type, but the average size, at 3.1 pounds, was well above average.  Since 1976, both low numbers and above average size have been a consistent characteristic of the northern pike population in this lake.  Total lengths extended from 16.5 to 35.6 inches with an average length of 22.7 inches.   Spring night electrofishing found good numbers of largemouth bass that had an average size of 1.3 pounds.  Lengths ranged from 6.9 to 20.4 inches with an average length of 12.4 inches.  Both northern pike and largemouth bass growth was normal.  The abundance of black crappie was found to be within a normal range with their lengths extending from 4.1 to 10.8 inches. Just over 50% of the crappie sampled were greater than 8.0 inches in length.  Bluegill sunfish numbers were within a normal range for this type of lake.  Measured bluegill ranged from 2.8 to 7.4 inches.  Most bluegill were in the 3.5 to 4.5 inch category.  When compared to 1994, the current bluegill population has shifted to more abundant numbers of small fish as opposed to the 1994 distribution, which was dominated by bluegill in the 7.0 to 7.5 inch group.  Selective harvest of larger bluegill may have been the cause of this size shift.  It's possible that with an abundance of small bluegills today, these fish could become the seven plus inchers in future years.  Yellow perch, an important forage species for walleye and northern pike, were found at above normal levels.  Perch numbers have rebounded from 1994 when numbers were at an all time low.  North Big Pine Lakes fish community was also made up of black bullhead, common shiner, pumpkinseed sunfish, shorthead redhorse, white sucker, yellow bullhead, banded killifish, Johnny darter, and tadpole madtom.  Excellent natural reproductive success was found for bluegill sunfish while largemouth bass and yellow perch showed good success.An angler fishing North Big Pine Lake is likely to encounter a good number of nice sized walleye or an occasional larger northern pike.  Getting these species to bit may be a challange, since there is an abundance of forage fish (yellow perch) available.  In the past, local papers have reported that spearing enthusiasts have taken northern pike in the 20-30 pound category.  Many quality largemouth are also available for an angling thrill.  Fishing logs from bass tournaments have reported good numbers of larger sized bass caught during tournaments.  Currently, the majority of bluegill sunfish are small in size, but their numbers are abundant.  Anglers can also expect some nicer crappie to be a part of their fishing experience.  Fishing enthusiasts are encouraged to be selective if they keep fish by harvesting the smaller ones for eating and releasing the larger ones.  Releasing the larger fish will help maintain the current quality of the fish population and provide future angling opportunities for others who would like to experience catching a quality sized fish.  Because North and South Big Pine Lakes are currently classified as having fertile water, additional nutrient input from land uses in the surrounding watershed could further decrease lake water quality.  Further nutrient loading can be prevented or reduced by protecting or re-establishing buffer strips of native plants along the shoreline and along streams that drain into these lakes, updating outdated or failing septic systems, discontinuing the use of fertilizer on surrounding lawns or using phosphorus free fertilizer, if fertilizer is needed, on surrounding lawns or cropland, utilizing crop farming practices that reduce run-off, limiting aquatic plant removal or disturbance, and limiting construction of impervious surfaces near the shoreline.</p>",
