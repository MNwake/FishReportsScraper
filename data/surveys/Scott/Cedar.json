                "narrative": "<p>Cedar Lake is a shallow, productive lake of 780 acres.  There are two state-run public accesses on Cedar Lake, an earthen access on the northeast side of the lake with limited parking and a concrete ramp on the east side of the lake.  Formerly a wetland that experienced frequent winterkills, increased water levels from a control structure and flow diversion from a nearby creek, coupled with winter aeration, has created a consistent fishery.  Cedar Lake is a popular fishery, due to it being the largest lake in southern Scott County.  A 1999 open-water creel survey found that 39% of anglers pursued bluegill, by far the most popular species.  Crappie, largemouth bass and tiger muskellunge also had double-digit percentages, while walleye were targeted by 7% of anglers. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye stocking has varied in Cedar Lake.  From 1982-1999, walleye fingerlings were purchased and stocked by a local sportsman\u0019s club.  In a test of whether private aquiculture could supplement fingerling production by the DNR, private stocking was contracted by private bidding beginning in 2000.  A special assessment was conducted in 2006 to evaluate the private stocking of Cedar Lake. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye were found to be present at below-average rates for this lake class, although the mean weight per fish is well above average at 4.9 lb.  Of the walleye sampled, 95% were between 20 and 28.99 inches in length, with only one walleye measuring 12.8 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nOf note is the presence of a large population of small black crappie, all 5.5-7.0 inches in length and age-2.  The black crappie were sampled at 353fish/ net, with 11.1 fish/ net considered above average for this lake class. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Cedar Lake is a shallow, productive 780-acre  lake located north of New Prague in south-central Scott County. Stabilized water levels and winter aeration have enabled fisheries staff to manage Cedar as a sport fishery. The lake is primarily managed for bluegill and walleye and secondarily for tiger muskellunge, although the fish community also includes black crappie, largemouth bass, northern pike, and yellow perch.  A special assessment, consisting of 9 gill nets, was conducted in August 2010 with the objective of evaluating the walleye population and stocking efforts following a summerkill  in 2007 (fisheries staff counted 43 adult walleye from 24 to 28 inches, and 1 tiger muskellunge). Walleye fingerlings are stocked at a rate of 2 pounds/acre in odd-numbered years.   <br> \n <br> \nCedar Lake continues to be plagued by poor water quality.  At the time of this assessment, dissolved oxygen dropped below 3 ppm between 2 and 4 ft deep.  Total phosphorus (0.163 ppm), total dissolved solids (292 ppm), and chlorophyll-a (26.2 ppb) concentrations were all high.  Summer water temperatures in this shallow lake (maximum depth 15 ft) can reach near 90? F.  Winter aeration prevents winterkill most years; however, dissolved oxygen levels do get low in parts of the lake.   <br> \n <br> \nDespite being stocked with over 50,000 walleye fingerlings since Fall of 2007 (see Table 1), walleye abundance is low (0.4/net) in Cedar Lake.  Abundance has been low since the 2006 assessment, when 2.4/gill net were sampled.  In the 11 previous assessments (1954 - 2003), walleye gill-net catch averaged 22.0/gill net (range, 1.0 to 68.7/gill net, median, 9.0/gill net).  Four walleye were sampled in 2010 (see Table 2).    At the time of capture walleye were in poor condition (Wr, see Table 2).  Condition (measured as relative weight (Wr )) is way of measuring physical health, poor condition can be an indicator of inadequate food resources.  <br> \n <br> \nTable 1.

Gill nets captured 276/net, which is the second highest on record (353/gill net in 2006) for Cedar Lake.  Abundance is 25 times higher than found in similar lakes.  The size structure has shifted since 2008 (see Table 3).  Average length and weight of black crappie in gill nets in 2010 was 7.3 inches and 0.20 pounds, with the largest measuring 8.4 inches.   For comparison, average crappie size in 2008 was 6.6 inches and 0.15 pounds, with the largest reaching 7.4 inches.  The 2008 sample was dominated (100%) by age-3 black crappie.  In 2010, there was a more diverse age structure.  The strong 2005 year class was present, but only comprised 43% of the population.  Black crappie ages 1 (7%), 2 (7%), and 4 (39%) were also present.  Black crappie reached 8 inches by age 4.     <br> \n <br> \nTable 3.

Bluegill size was large as well, averaging 7.3 inches and 0.35 pounds.   Five tiger muskellunge were sampled, ranging in size from 19.9 inches and 1.2 pounds to 42.1 inches and 19.4 pounds.  White sucker abundance is moderate (2.2/gill net, near median).  Sizes ranged from 9.3 to 18.2 inches, averaging 16.8 inches.  Other species sampled in low abundance were black bullhead, common carp, golden shiner, and yellow bullhead.   <br> \nManagement implications <br> \n <br> \nCedar Lake has seen dramatic reductions in its walleye population over the past 5 years.  Poor year classes and summerkills initiated by poor water quality are likely to blame.  Interspecific competition by an overly abundant black crappie population may also make it increasingly difficult for stocked walleye fingerlings to establish strong year classes.  It appears the older, larger walleye are aging and being eliminated from the system.  In 2008, a total of only 4 walleye were sampled; two were 8 inches and two were 26 inches.  These older, larger walleye were not present in the 2010 assessment.  Walleye from the 2007 year class should have fully recruited to the sampling gear by 2010, however very few were observed.   <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

This is evident in the catch information from recent population assessments. Although down from levels observed in 1995, walleye were sampled in near average abundance, but above average size for this type of lake. The average walleye captured was over 21 inches in length and 3.5 pounds in weight. Upon analysis of age and growth information for sampled walleye during the 1999 assessment, it was found that both fry and fingerling stockings have contributed to the overall fish population for walleye in since 1983.  Only two year classes of walleye stocked since 1987 were not represented in the overall catch. Walleye growth rates were found to be above average. Hybrid Muskies were sampled in both gill and trap nets with 40 percent of captured individuals being 40 inches or longer. Northern Pike were sampled within normal population ranges for abundance. The average size of northern pike captured was 27.1\" in length and 5.1 pounds. Growth rates for Hybrid Muskie and Northern Pike were also found to be above average. Largemouth bass were sampled, but in lower abundance than that observed in 1995. Yellow perch, bluegill, pumpkinseed sunfish andblack crappie were sampled in very high abundance with good numbers of above average size individuals for all species represented in the catch. Black bullhead numbers have decreased steadily since the 1980's, while yellow bullhead are becoming well established and were observed in record high numbers for this lake.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Cedar Lake is a shallow, productive, 780-acre lake located north of New Prague in south-central Scott County.  Stabilized water levels and winter aeration have enabled fisheries staff to manage Cedar as a quality sport fishery.  The lake is primarily managed for bluegill and walleye and secondarily for tiger muskellunge, although the sportfish community also includes black crappie, largemouth bass, northern pike, and yellow perch.  A population assessment, consisting of gill nets and trap nets, was conducted on Cedar Lake in 2008 to characterize the fish community. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill were the most abundant fish sampled.  One hundred sixty per trap net were collected which is considered high for similar lakes across the state.  Trap net catch was the highest observed in the past 5 population assessments (mean = 75.3 per trap net, 1995-2005).  Mean length and weight of bluegill were 6.7 inches and 0.22 pounds, with the largest reaching 8.3 inches.  Ninety-six percent were 6 inches or longer but only 14% were 7 inches or longer.  Ages 2 through 6 were represented in the sample, 72% were age 4 and 19% were age 5.  Compared to other similar lakes in the West Metro Area, bluegill growth was faster than average through age 4, then slowed for older ages.       <br> \n\t <br> \nOne walleye was sampled in gill nets (0.1 per net) and 3 in trap nets (0.3 per net).  Walleye abundance is considerably lower than past assessments, as average walleye catch for the previous 5 surveys has been 15.8 per gill net.  An explanation for low walleye abundance in 2008 is the fact that a summerkill event occurred during the summer of 2007 where water temperatures and dissolved oxygen levels reached lethal levels for walleye in this shallow lake.  An investigation by fisheries staff revealed numerous dead walleye ranging from approximately 24-28 inches in length.  Of the 4 walleye collected during the 2008 assessment, 2 were 26 inches and 2 were 8 inches (from the 2007 stocking).  Walleye fingerlings are stocked at a rate of 2 pounds per acre in odd-numbered years and it appears some fish from the 2007 stocking survived. <br> \n <br> \nThe summer netting in this survey was not designed to assess tiger muskellunge, however, two were collected in trap nets (38.2, 39.6 inches).  Cedar Lake has been stocked with either tiger muskellunge fry or fingerlings in the past, the most recent stocking being 1000 fingerlings in 2008. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie were highly abundant in both gill (123.4 per net) and trap nets (30.2 per net).  Historically black crappie abundance has been high in Cedar Lake as the average catches for the previous 5 assessments have been 119.2 per gill net and 36.5 per trap net.  Average length and weight of black crappie in gill nets was 6.5 inches and 0.17 pounds, the largest measured 7.4 inches.  Ninety-three percent were between 6 and 7 inches.  All black crappie sampled were from the 2005 year class (age 3).  Growth was considerably slower compared to other similar lakes in the West Metro Area.  A moderate black crappie die-off  was reported on 6/10/08.  The timing, species seen, and mortality pattern seemed consistent with a  natural columnaris bacterial kill (or similar natural bacterial-caused kill).  This die-off made seemingly no dent in a dense crappie population.         <br> \n <br> \nPassive sampling gears, such as trap nets and gill nets, are not effective methods for collecting largemouth bass, so the data presented for this species is not indicative of relative abundance.  Electrofishing is the typical method for largemouth bass assessments but was not conducted during this survey.  That said, only 3 largemouth bass were collected during the 2008 assessment measuring 21.1, 19.3, and 5.8 inches. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch abundance was moderately low (4.0 per gill net) and lower than the previous 6 assessments.  Yellow perch numbers have been declining in assessments since 1995 when 186.5 per gill net were observed.  Average length and weight were 8.3 inches 0.25 pounds, with the longest measuring 9.1 inches.  Eighty-nine percent of yellow perch were age 4; the remaining 11% were age 5.      <br> \n <br> \nCedar Lake has typically had a low-density northern pike population averaging 1.0 per gill net and 0.3 per trap net.  In the 2008 assessment, only one northern pike (36.4 inches) was captured and it was in a trap net.  Catch-per-unit-effort (0.1 per trap net) was the lowest it has been in the past 4 assessments (1995-2008).   <br> \n <br> \nPumpkinseed were captured in high abundance relative to other class 41 lakes in the state.  An average of 13.1 per trap net were observed. <br> \n <br> \nOther species collected in low abundance were black bullhead, brown bullhead, common carp, golden shiner, hybrid sunfish, white sucker, and yellow bullhead.      <br> \n</p>",

A 1999 open water creel survey found that 39% of anglers pursued bluegill, by far the most popular species.  Crappie, largemouth bass, and tiger muskellunge also had double-digit percentages, while walleye were targeted by only 7% of anglers.Walleye fingerling stocking at 2 pounds per acre in alternate years began in 2001, following stocking at 1 pound per acre in 1997 and 1999.  From 1993 to 1996 walleye fry stocking was evaluated and found to be ineffective.  Prior to fry stocking, walleye fingerlings were purchased and stocked by a local sportsman's club.  Number of fish stocked ranged from 6,000 in 1989 to 16,000 stocked in 1991 and again in 1992.  A special assessment of Cedar Lake was conducted during the summer of 2003 to evaluate the success of walleye stocking.  A total of 12 gill nets were set from 7/21/200 to 7/25/2003, although one net was tampered with and was not included in this survey.  Other fish species besides walleye, such as bluegill, black crappie, and largemouth bass, are better assessed with different sampling gear not used in this survey.  Therefore, the 2002 survey should be referenced by those interested in the status of those species.Gill netting captured 16.1 walleye per net, which exceeds the upper end of the typical range for lakes of this type (15.3 per net).  Only the 1995 survey has found a higher walleye net catch (46.2 per net).  In 2003 walleye averaged 16.3 inches and 1.95 pounds, and 22% of walleye sampled exceeded 20 inches.  Average size in 2002 was 21.8 inches and 4.1 pounds.  The decline in average size reflects an increase in younger fish in the population.  Walleye sampled in Cedar Lake in recent surveys were mainly fish from the 1991 and 1992 fingerling stockings (66% of 2002 catch).   In contrast, the 2003 sample found that 80% of walleye were from the 1999, 2000 and 2001 stockings.  This reflects the fact that these year classes of fish have now reached a large enough size to be captured by the sampling gear.  The 2001 year class appears to be especially strong, comprising 50% of walleye sampled.  Growth is fast, with walleye averaging 19.4 inches at age 4 compared to an area average of 16.7 inches.  Less than 3% of walleye sampled were from years not stocked with walleye fingerlings. These results suggest that walleye stocking is essential to maintain a quality walleye fishery in Cedar Lake.  In addition, stocking at a rate of 2 pounds per acre, as in 2001, is resulting in increased numbers of adult walleye.  Good growth rates suggest that the increase in walleye abundance has not lead to significant negative impacts from walleye competing with one another for food.  However, yellow perch (the primary food source for walleye in Cedar Lake) catch in 2003 (9.9 per net) was the lowest seen since the 1990 survey.  This suggests that the abundance of forage as well as walleye growth rates should continue to be monitored to verify that walleye abundance does not exceed what this lake can support.  Perch averaged 8.1 inches, and 52% of the sample exceeded 8 inches.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Cedar Lake is a shallow, productive 780-acre Class 41 lake located north of New Prague in south-central Scott County.  Maximum depth is 13 ft.  Stabilized water levels and winter aeration have enabled fisheries staff to manage Cedar as a recreational fishery. The lake is primarily managed for bluegill and walleye and secondarily for tiger muskellunge, although the fish community also includes black crappie, largemouth bass, northern pike, and yellow perch.  A special assessment was conducted on September 19, 2012 to assess the largemouth bass population and the survival of stocked walleye fry.   <br> \n <br> \nIn 2 hours and 24 minutes of nighttime boat electrofishing (6 transects), 57 largemouth bass and 36 walleye were sampled.  On all fish, scale samples were taken along with length and weight measurements.  Largemouth bass were sampled at a rate of 23.7 per hour of on-time.  Size structure was balanced with PSD = 45 and RSD-P = 14.  Bass length ranged from 3.9 to 19.6 inches, averaging 8.4 inches.  Weight ranged from 0.3 to 4.44 lbs, averaging 0.56 lbs.   Ages ranged from 1 to 9.  The majority (56%) of the bass sampled were age 1 or 2.   <br> \n <br> \nThe high productivity and shallow nature of the lake puts it at risk for both winter and summerkills.  A summerkill of walleye and hybrid muskellunge was observed in 2007 and subsequent surveys in 2008 and 2010 revealed a walleye population that had not yet recovered despite continued fingerling stocking.   Beginning in the spring of 2011, the walleye stocking regime on Cedar Lake changed from fingerlings every other year to fry annually.  This management strategy of stocking walleye fry instead of fingerlings is low risk with potential high rewards.  By using fry, the total number of fish stocked is increased by over 20 times, and the cost of stocking is much lower as these fish come directly from the hatchery to the lake.  Research has shown that a major bottleneck in the recruitment of walleye is in the first summer of life.  The purpose of electrofishing for young-of-the-year walleye in the fall of 2012 was to look for fry that had made it through this bottleneck and were most likely to establish a year class.   <br> \n <br> \nThirty-six walleye were sampled at a rate of 15.0 fish per hour of on-time.  Average length and weight were 10.7 inches and 0.41 lbs.  Total length ranged from 8.9 to 12.5 inches.  Growth was below the statewide average.  Walleye were in good condition.  Relative weight averaged 92 and ranged from 77 to 103.  All 36 walleye sampled were from the 2009 year class.  In 2009, fingerlings (n = 26, 454) and in 2010, yearlings (n = 670) were stocked into Cedar Lake.  All correspond to the 2009 year class.  We were not able to sample any walleye from the 2011 or 2012 year classes that were stocked as fry.  This assessment did not give us any positive data on the survival of stocked fry; however, in lakes in the West Metro Area where fry survival has been confirmed we are still unable to document this with fall electrofishing.  Future gill net assessments should be scheduled when the stocked fry will begin to be vulnerable to gill nets (2014).  If, over time, gill net assessments are unable to document fry survival, a decision must be made whether to resume fingerling stocking or cease walleye stocking in Cedar Lake.       </p>",

Black bullheads, yellow perch, bluegill, and black crappie were found at above local median numbers. black bullheads have remained relatively stable in abundance since 1982. Bluegill and black crappie have increased dramatically since 1982, and young-of-the-year abundance is also higher. They are progeny of the adult bluegill and black crappie stocked in 1980, predominantly a single year class yellow perch, introduced as forage in 1979 and 1980, have remained at a relatively stable level just slightly above the local median. The adult yellow perch stocked as forage are virtually gone. The present population is represented by their progeny. Walleye remain abundant and growth is good. Walleyes are represented by the 1975, 1983, and 1984 classes. Walleye growth increases dramatically following yellow perch forage introduction in 1979 and 1980. Growth has continued with some walleyes over 22.0 inches in length.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Gill netting captured 6.0 walleye per net, below net catches from previous surveys. Walleye averaged 21.8 inches and 4.1 pounds.  Two-thirds of walleye sampled exceeded 20 inches.  The walleye fishery in Cedar Lake from 1995 to present has been mainly comprised of fish from the 1991 and 1992 year-classes, which was 66% of the 2002 catch even though those fish are now 10+ years old.  Fingerling stocking was interrupted from 1993 to 1996, but resumed in 1997.  The stocking rate was doubled in 2000 to 2 pounds per acre.  Catch rate of walleye will hopefully return to previous levels as recent stockings mature.Hybrid (\"Tiger\") muskellunge are also stocked in Cedar Lake.  A total of 4 were sampled between the 2 gear types, ranging from 30.5 to 32.5 inches.  All were from the 1998 stocking.A majority of anglers on Cedar Lake pursue bluegill, and with good reason.  Trap net catch averaged 118.0 per net, nearly identical to the previous survey.  Mean length was 5.5 inches, and 56% exceeded 7 inches.  Reproduction appears to be sporadic, as 89% sampled were from the 1999 year-class.  These fish are just reaching \"keeper\" size for anglers, meaning that fishing for this species should be excellent in the coming years.The black crappie population of Cedar Lake is also abundant, averaging 15.8 per net.  Mean length was 8.7 inches, and 83% exceeded 8 inches.  The 1999 year-class is strong, comprising 79% of fish sampled.Largemouth bass electrofishing found 36.9 fish per hour of on-time.  However, this sampling was cut short by inclement weather, limiting sampling to only 1 short run that captured 6 fish.  Mean length of bass was 16.0 inches, and mean weight was 2.33 pounds.  Yellow perch averaged 34.0 per gill net, which exceeds the upper quartile for this lake class.  Previous surveys have had catch rates as high as 186.5 and as low as 5.0 per net.  In 2002, perch mean length was 7.9 inches, and 48% exceeded 8 inches.  The largest individual measured 13.3 inches.Other species sampled in this survey include black and yellow bullhead, golden shiner, hybrid sunfish, pumpkinseed sunfish, white sucker, johnny darter, and carp.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Cedar Lake is 793-acres (793 littoral acres) with a maximum depth of 13 feet. Cedar is located northeast of New Prague in southern Scott County. Cedar is managed for Walleye, Bluegill, and Black Crappie, but also supports catchable populations of Largemouth Bass and Yellow Perch. Public water access is provided by DNR Parks and Trails at two locations on Cedar Lake. The eastern launch off of MN Hwy 13 provides two concrete ramps and parking spaces for 30 vehicle/trailers; while the northwestern launch off of county road 64 provides one concrete ramp and 4 vehicle/trailer parking spaces. <br> \n <br> \nA Standard Survey (11 trap nets/4 gill nets) was conducted on Cedar Lake during the week of 8/2/2021 to assess the fishery. During the 2021 survey, Cedar was highly productive (green stained water), with poor water clarity, measured at 1.5 feet during the time of this survey. Despite these factors, dissolved oxygen remained above 4 parts per million (ppm) at an 11 foot depth during the survey period. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye in Cedar Lake are maintained through fingerling stocking in odd numbered years. During the 2021 survey Walleye were captured at high numbers (12/net), well above the expected catch rate of similar lakes in the area. There were 48 Walleye sampled in gill nets, with an average size of 13.2 inches and the largest measured at 25.6 inches. Size indices show a population currently skewed toward smaller Walleye. Growth rates were very fast compared to the statewide average, with an average length of 12.8 inches by age 2. While the current Walleye population is small in size, high abundances and fast growth should help contribute to plenty of angling opportunity in the coming years. <br> \n <br> \nHigh numbers of Bluegill were sampled with trap nets (22.8/net), above the expected catch rate of similar lakes in the area. There were 251 Bluegill sampled in trap nets during the 2021 survey, with an average length of 7.3 inches and the largest measured at 10.1 inches. Bluegill size indices describe a balanced population (an intermediate between high numbers of small fish and few numbers of large fish). Bluegill growth was fast compared to similar lakes across the metro with an average length of 6.2 inches by age 2. Cedar Lake provides one of the few opportunities in the metro area where anglers may see Bluegill greater than 9 inches. <br> \n <br> \nExtremely high numbers of Black Crappie were sampled with gill nets (120.8/net) and trap nets (66.6/net). Despite high numbers, the 2021 catch rates were similar to previous surveys on Cedar. There were 863 Black Crappie sampled during the 2021 survey, with an average length of 8.8 inches and the largest measured at 12.9 inches. Despite high numbers, size indices reveal a population mainly composed of catchable sized (8+ inches) individuals. Age analysis reveals surprising results with 97% of fish corresponding to one age group, the 2014 year class. The vast majority of Black Crappie in Cedar Lake were 7 years old, averaged 8.8 inches and exhibited slow growth. While Black Crappie fishing on Cedar Lake is currently excellent, having the vast majority of fish correspond to a single year class will likely leave a large void when those fish finally move through the system, that is until a new year class can replace them. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass are present in Cedar Lake, although targeted boat-electrofishing did not occur during the 2021 survey. Incidental capture with trap and gill nets caught 6 Largemouth Bass, with an average length of 13.6 inches and the largest measured at 20.5 inches. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch were sampled with gill nets (15/net) near the expected catch rate of similar lakes. Average size of Yellow Perch in the 2021 survey was 9.8 inches, with the largest measured at 14.2 inches, both extremely high values compared to other metro lakes. Yellow Perch rarely provide good angling opportunity in the metro due to high abundances and small sizes, however, Cedar Lake is one of the few exceptions. <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species sampled in low abundances were Black Bullhead, Brown Bullhead, Common Carp, Golden Shiner, Pumpkinseed, and Yellow Bullhead. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Cedar Lake is a very fertile body of water capabile of supporting a high population of fish for several species. This is evident in the catch information from the 1995 population assessment. Walleye were very abundant in the sampling with several quality size fish over 8 pounds being observed. The average walleye sampled was approximately 17.0\" and 1.75 pounds. Upon analysis of age and growth information for sampled walleye, it was found that both fry and fingerling stockings have contributed significantly to the overall fishery. Only two year classes of stocked Walleye since 1983 were not represented in the overall catch.  Hybrid Muskie were sampled in both gill and trap nets and were found to exhibit good growth. Northern Pike were captured in relatively low numbers but the highest ccatch rate since 1982. Largemouth Bass were very abundant in all sampling gears but were small in size. Two strong year classes (1993 & 1994) made up the majority of the bass sampled. Yellow perch, bluegill, pumpkinseed, and black crappie were sampled in very high abundance with good numbers of quality size individuals for all species represented in the sample. Black bullhead numbers have decreased significantly since 1990 and yellow bullhead numbers are becoming well established in this system. White crappie, white sucker, carp, golden shiner and green sunfish were also present in the catch. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Cedar Lake is a shallow, productive, 780-acre, Class 41 lake located north of New Prague in south-central Scott County.  The lake is primarily managed for Bluegill and Walleye and secondarily managed for Tiger Muskellunge and Black Crappie.  A Standard Survey, consisting of gill nets and trap nets, was conducted on Cedar Lake in 2015 to characterize the gamefish populations. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill were moderately abundant in 2015.  The catch rate of 11.0 fish per trap net was between the median and 75th percentile for this this Lake Class.  Thirty-five percent of the fish exceeded 7 inches, and 8% exceeded 8 inches.  The average size of Bluegill was 6.6 inches and 0.25 pounds.  The largest fish measured 9.1 inches and 0.69 pounds. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance was low in 2015, and the fish tended to be large.  The catch rate of 2.6 fish per gill net was below the 25th percentile for this Lake Class.  The average size of Walleye was 19.1 inches and 2.39 pounds.  All of the fish exceeded 15 inches, and 22% exceeded 20 inches.  All of the Walleye sampled were age 6, originating from the 2009 year class.  This was the last class of fish to be stocked as fingerlings or yearlings.  Since 2011, Walleye have been stocked as fry on an annual basis.   <br> \n <br> \nAn overwhelming abundance of small-sized Black Crappie was present in 2015.  The catch rate of 374.9 fish per gill net is more than 33 times the 75th percentile for this Lake Class.  The average size of Black Crappie is 5.5 inches and 0.09 pounds.  Only 1% of the sampled fish exceeded 8 inches, and 1 fish among the 2,624 gill-netted crappie exceeded 10 inches.  The population of Black Crappie is dominated by a very strong 2014 year class (age 1).   <br> \n <br> \nA highly abundant population of Yellow Perch was also revealed in the 2015 gill nets.  The catch rate of 104.6 fish per net greatly exceeded the 75th percentile for this Lake Class (22.5 fish per net).  Eighteen percent of the fish exceeded 8 inches, and the average size was 7.5 inches and 0.20 pounds.  The Yellow Perch population is dominated by a very strong 2014 year class (age 1).   <br> \n <br> \nAlthough Largemouth Bass are not typically vulnerable to passive sampling gears such as gill nets and trap nets, many were sampled in 2015.  The gill net catch rate of 21.6 fish per net greatly exceeds the 75th percentile for this Lake Class (1.77 per gill net).  Of the 151 gill-netted bass, only two fish exceeded 12 inches.  Average size was 9.6 inches and 0.49 pounds, and the largest fish was 15.9 inches and 2.43 pounds.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow Bullhead and Golden Shiner were highly abundant in the 2015 gill nets.  The Yellow Bullhead catch rate of 43.1 fish per gill net greatly exceeded the 75th percentile for this Lake Class (3.6 fish per gill net).  Sixty-six percent of the bullheads exceeded 9 inches, and the average size was 10.4 inches and 0.75 pounds.  The Golden Shiner catch rate of 9.9 fish per gill net also greatly exceeded the 75th percentile for this Lake Class (0.68 fish per gill net).  Average size of Golden Shiner was 7.2 inches and 0.17 pounds.   <br> \n <br> \nOther fishes caught in low abundance include Black Bullhead, hybrid sunfish, Pumpkinseed, Tiger Muskellunge, White Sucker, and Common Carp.   <br> \n</p>",
