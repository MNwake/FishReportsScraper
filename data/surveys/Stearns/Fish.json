                "narrative": "<p>Big Fish Lake is a 558 acre lake located five miles north of Cold Spring in Stearns County.  The public access is located on the north end of the lake.  Big Fish Lake is managed primarily for walleye, and has been traditionally stocked with fingerlings.  In an attempt to boost walleye abundance, walleye fry were stocked in spring 2005.Along with the standard survey, an ice-out survey was conducted between April 9-14, 2005 in an attempt to estimate the population size of walleye and northern pike.  The information will also be used to evaluate the effectiveness of the experimental 24 - 36 inch protected slot on northern pike implemented in 2005.  Largemouth Bass Electrofishing SurveyA total of 114 largemouth bass were sampled in 1.32 hours (pedal time) of electrofishing.  The largemouth bass catch rate was 86.4 fish/hr, which was greater than the Montrose mean catch rate from spring electrofishing (52.0/hr).  Largemouth bass ranged in length from 7.1 to 15.5 inches with a mean length of 11.7 inches.  Anglers have enjoyed excellent largemouth fishing at Big Fish Lake. Gill Net SurveyThe catch of walleye declined significantly in 2005 (2.6 fish/net) from 1997 (5.3 fish/net) and was below the expected range for class 27 lakes.  Walleye stocking will continue in order to try to boost the population.The catch rate of northern pike sampled in gill nets was 11.6 fish/net.  At this level of abundance growth is slow and the average weight (1.2 lbs) is less than anglers will accept.  Based on mark-recaptures, the northern pike population was estimated to be 11,079 (19.8 fish/acre).  The slot regulation for northern pike is designed to limit the harvest of larger fish and increase the overall size.  Anglers are encouraged to harvest small northern pike in order to improve the size structure.No yellow perch were sampled in the 2005 gill net survey.  Yellow perch have historically been rare in Big Fish Lake probably due to the abundance of northern pike.Trap Net SurveyA total of 66 bluegill (7.3 fish/net) were sampled during the trap net survey.  Bluegill ranged in length from 3.1 to 7.5 inches with a mean length of 5.0 inches. The trap net catch of bluegill has been trending lower over the past four surveys (86.1 in 1989, 44.1 in 1991 and 18.7 in 1997).  However, given the small size of bluegill and slow growth rates it is thought that the population is still abundant.Black crappie have historically been sampled in low numbers on Big Fish Lake and only two black crappie were sampled during this survey.  Over the past four assessments the catches of black crappie have been 2.0, 1986; 1.3, 1991; 4.1, 1997; and 0.2/trap, 2005.Other species sampled during the survey were: yellow, black, and brown bullheads, bowfin, pumpkinseed sunfish, common carp, and white sucker.  All of these were sampled within expected ranges for class 27 lakes.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Big Fish Lake is a 558 acre lake located five miles north of Cold Spring in Stearns County.  A public access exists on the north end of the lake. Improvements to the access have included resurfacing the parking lot and installing infiltration basins to prevent surface runoff from directly entering the lake. The water quality of Big Fish Lake was good with clarity of 12 feet.  Adequate dissolved oxygen was present to a depth of 32 feet during the first week of August in 2010.   <br> \n <br> \nIn many ways the fishery at Big Fish Lake is unbalanced. Northern pike are too abundant and consist mainly of small \"hammer handles\".  Northern pike overeat their prey which consists largely of yellow perch and small walleye. This is likely why there are very few perch in Big Fish Lake and why walleye stocking has met with limited success.  In 2005 a special fishing regulation was enacted that requires that anglers release all northern pike between 24 and 36 inches. This regulation has been used successfully at other locations to improve the average size of northern pike.  The idea is that the larger fish are conserved and eventually the number of smaller fish is reduced.  A population assessment was conducted in 2010 to evaluate the short term effects of this regulation. <br> \n <br> \nThe 2010 catch rate of northern pike sampled by gill nets was at an all time high of 20/net. This was over twice the expected range of similar lakes and significantly higher than that of 2005 (12/gill net). Northern pike ranged in length from 9 to 30 inches. Average length and weight of pike was 16.6 inches and one pound. Recruitment of small northern pike was also high and 19 percent of pike sampled were yearlings less than 14 inches in length.  Both male and female northern pike grew within the predicted statewide averages. Female pike grew to a length of 24 inches in five years. Only four percent of northern pike sampled were greater than 24 inches in length.  The special fishing regulation will be given five more years to work.  In order for there to be a chance for improvement the number of medium and large sized northern pike needs to increase. <br> \n <br> \nThe net catch of walleye in 2010 was 1.4/ gill net. This was less than half the predicted catch for similar lakes and significantly lower than that of 2005 (2.6/gill net).  Walleye ranged in length from 17 to 26 inches with an average length of 20.5 inches.  The average weight of walleye sampled was over three pounds, but reflected the lack of young fish in the population.  Growth rates of both male and female walleye were within the statewide averages. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass were sampled with daytime electrofishing in 2010 at a rate of more than twice the average of other lakes in the Montrose Management Area.  Largemouth bass ranged in length from 5 to 18 inches with an average length of 12 inches.  Forty-six percent of the catchable size (greater than eight inches) largemouth were greater than 12 inches, however only 13 percent of the catchable size bass were greater than 15 inches long. Largemouth bass grew at rate slower than the statewide average. Fish grew to a length of 12 inches in six years. <br> \n <br> \nThe trap net catch of bluegill had been trending lower over each of the previous four surveys.  The catch was 12 bluegill /net in 2010. The average length of bluegill was small (4.6 inches) and the majority of the bluegill sampled were less than seven inches long.  Given the small size of bluegill and slow growth rates it is thought that the bluegill population is still abundant in Big Fish Lake. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie have historically been sampled by trap nets in low numbers in Big Fish Lake.  A total of 69 black crappie were sampled in 2010 by all gear types including 35 young of the year crappie sampled during shoreline sampling.  Age two and older black crappie ranged in length from 5 to 12 inches with an average length of nearly nine inches. Growth rates of black crappie were faster than statewide averages and black crappie grew to a length of ten inches in four years. <br> \n <br> \nSensitive minnow species recovered during shoreline seining and backpack electrofishing included: Iowa, Johnny, and least darters, banded killifish, blacknose, pugnose, and blackchin shiners.  The presence of these species is a testament to the good water quality in Big Fish Lake.   <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled during the survey were: yellow, black, and brown bullhead, bowfin, pumpkinseed, hybrid, and green sunfish. All of these species were sampled at rates within the predicted statewide ranges with the exception of yellow bullhead and bowfin which were higher than the expected range for lakes similar to Big Fish. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Big Fish Lake is a 558 acre lake located five miles north of Cold Spring.  The lake has  5.8 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 70 feet.  During early August 1997, adequate dissolved oxygen for fish was present to a depth of 33 feet.  The lakeshore is highly developed with almost 200 homes and cottages as well as one small resort.  About 1 percent of lake surface was covered by emergent vegetation at the time of the last lake survey, in 1991.  There is a state owned public access at the northwest end of the lake.       Big Fish Lake receives moderate fishing pressure and is managed primarily for walleye and northern pike.  Black crappie, bluegill, walleye, northern pike, and largemouth bass are all present in the lake.  In a lake survey conducted in the summer of 1997, test netting revealed the following information about the fish population.     The northern pike catch in gill nets (9.3/gill net) was similar to previous surveys.  Northern pike catch was above expected levels for lakes that are similar to Big Fish lake.  The average northern pike caught in gill nets weighed 1.1 pounds and was 16.5 inches long.  This is smaller than the 1991 average of 2.4 pounds, and is below the expected weight range for northern pike in similar lakes.  Northern pike growth was average when compared with other populations in the state.     Gill net catch rate of walleye (5.3/gill net) increased significantly from the 1991 survey rate of 2.8/gill net, rising back into the expected range for this lake type.  The average walleye caught in gill nets weighed 1.9 pounds and was 16.8 inches long.  This is within expected levels for the lake type.  Eighty three percent of walleye caught were from years that the lake was stocked and growth was average when compared with other populations in the state.     The trap net catch of bluegills in Big Fish lake was 18.7/trap net, which was within normal levels for the lake class.  Bluegill caught in trap nets averaged 5.0 inches long.  The black crappie trap net catch rate (4.1/trap net) appeared higher than the 1991 rate of 1.2/trap net and exceeded the expected range for similar lakes.  Black crappie averaged 8.3 inches in length.     Largemouth bass were sampled by spring electrofishing.  A total of 37 fish were sampled at a rate of 16.4 fish/hour of run-time.  This catch rate was below the Montrose Area median of 20.7 fish/hour of run-time.  Largemouth bass averaged 0.9 pounds and 11.4 inches.  A typical largemouth bass reaches 12 inches at age 5 in Big Fish Lake.  Bass catch rates have dropped since the 1991 lake survey, but the proportion of large fish in the population appears to have increased. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Big Fish Lake, located 5 miles north of Cold Spring in central Stearns County, is a scenic, clear water lake that offers a variety of angling and recreational opportunities.  It has a maximum depth of 70 feet and a small watershed with a high percentage of undeveloped forest and grassland and a modest amount of cultivated farmland.   A public access is located on the north side of the lake and offers two tiers of parking.  The lake supports a diverse aquatic plant community that provide important fish habitat as well as shoreline protection from erosion.  Some of the more common submergent plant species include: coontail, northern watermilfoil, flatstem pondweed, water celery, and Canada waterweed.  Curly leaf pondweed has historically been rare and was found growing at our near the surface on less than 1% of the lake.  Emergent and floating leaf vegetation was found along 16.7% of the shoreline with cattail and white waterlily being the most common species.  In 2015, the water quality of Big Fish Lake was excellent with an average clarity of 14 feet.  Anglers can expect plenty of action for small Bluegill and Northern Pike, excellent Largemouth Bass fishing, as well as the potential for quality sized Black Crappie and Walleye. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike are abundant in Big Fish Lake and consist mainly of small \"hammer handles\".  These predators have largely exhausted their forage which consists primarily of Yellow Perch, White Sucker, and small Walleye.  This is likely why there are very few perch and suckers in Big Fish Lake and why Walleye stocking has had limited success.  To address this problem, an experimental 24 to 36 inch protected slot limit was placed on Northern Pike in 2005. This regulation requires the immediate release of all pike between 24 and 36 inches with one pike over 36 inches allowed in possession. The objective of the regulation was to improve the size structure of the pike population.  A standard summer survey along with a spring ice out survey was conducted in 2015 in an attempt to evaluate the effectiveness of the experimental regulation which has been in place for 10 years.  In addition, a special Bluegill assessment was completed in June to evaluate the size structure of spawning Bluegills.  Other sampling during the year included: near shore IBI sampling looking for sensitive minnow species, a point intercept aquatic plant survey, curly leaf pondweed mapping and emergent and floating leaf vegetation mapping to evaluate the physical habitat of Big Fish Lake.  <br> \n <br> \nThe targeted ice out survey began on April 7th, 2015 when a large percentage of the lake was still covered in ice.  A total of 514 Northern Pike were sampled, and although pike up to 34 inches were found, the average length was only 17.1 inches. The percentage of Northern Pike longer than 24 inches was 2.9%, compared to previous ice out surveys from 2010 (6.9%), and 2005 (3.3%).  The results of the summer survey were more encouraging as the catch rate of Northern Pike decreased significantly from the all time high catch rate observed in 2010.  However, the catch remained above management goals.  Northern Pike ranged in length from 10 to 35 inches and averaged 17.4 inches and 1.4 pounds.  This was a small improvement from previous surveys.  Recruitment of small Northern Pike remained high however, as 19 percent of pike sampled were less than 14 inches in length.  The future of the special pike regulation is uncertain and public input meetings will be held to decide what course of action to take. <br> \n <br> \nThe net catch of Walleye in 2015 was less than half the expected rate for similar lakes but was similar to 2010.  Walleye ranged in length from 9.2 to 25.7 inches with an average length and weight of 18.3 inches and 2.4 pounds.   Growth rates of Walleye appear good but are limited by small sample sizes. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass were sampled by night electrofishing in the spring of 2015 and the catch was similar to the average night time catch for lake in the Montrose Management Area.  Largemouth Bass ranged in length from 4.6 to 17.6 inches with an average length of 10.7 inches.  Twenty eight percent of the catchable size (greater than eight inches) bass were greater than 12 inches, however only nine percent of the catchable size bass were greater than 15 inches long. <br> \n <br> \nThe trap net catch of Bluegill had been trending downward over each of the previous four surveys but catch rates of Bluegill increased in 2015.  While the Bluegill average size in the July survey was only 5.8 inches, a spring survey showed that a few quality size Bluegill up to nine inches can be found.  Seasonal differences in trap net catches for panfish related to size and abundance have to do with water temperatures and the completion of spawning.  Generally catches are not as good during the summer due to the fact that larger mature fish move into deeper, cooler water where they are not sampled as well by trap nets that are set in shallow water near the shore.  Black Crappies have historically been sampled in low numbers in Big Fish Lake and this was the case again in 2015.  Although few were sampled, quality fish up to 12.4 inches were observed. <br> \n <br> \nNear shore IBI sampling was used to survey small minnow species that are sensitive to changes in water quality.  During the near-shore sampling the following sensitive species were collected: Iowa Darter, Johnny Darter, Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Spotfin Shiner, and Spottail Shiner.  The presence of these species is an indicator that Big Fish Lake has good water quality and habitat.   Changes in shoreline development have the potential to negatively affect the health of a lake.  It is important that all lake shore owners follow County shoreline rules and only mow a small area down to the lake to allow access and avoid clearing their entire shoreline.  Native vegetation helps stabilize shoreline soils and acts as a buffer reducing the amount of pollution that enters a lake from runoff. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Big Fish Lake, located 5 miles north of Cold Spring in central Stearns County, is a scenic, clear water lake that offers a variety of angling and recreational opportunities.  It has a maximum depth of 70 feet and a small watershed with a high percentage of undeveloped forest and grassland and a modest amount of cultivated farmland.  A public access is located on the north side of the lake and offers two tiers of parking.  The lake supports a diverse aquatic plant community that provides important fish habitat as well as shoreline protection from erosion.  Some of the more common submergent plant species included: coontail, northern watermilfoil, flatstem pondweed, water celery, and Canada waterweed.  In 2015, the water quality of Big Fish Lake was excellent with an average clarity of 14 feet.   <br> \n <br> \nA targeted Bluegill assessment was conducted on Big Fish Lake from June 1   June 2, 2015.  This assessment was conducted in order to get an idea of the size structure of the spawning Bluegills.  Many times these larger individuals are not sampled during the traditional summer surveys especially during surveys conducted in July and August.  A total of 549 Bluegills were sampled during the survey and averaged 6.4 inches long with the largest measuring 9.0 inches.  Fisheries biologists describe the size structure of a fish population using terms such as Proportional Stock Density (PSD) and Relative Stock Density (RSD).  For Bluegill, PSD is the percentage of Bluegill larger than 3\" that are also larger than 6\".  The PSD of Bluegill from Big Fish was 73.  So, 73% of the Bluegill sampled larger than 3\" were also larger than 6\".  Similarly, RSD8 is the percentage of Bluegill larger than 3\" that are also larger than 8\". The RSD8 on Big Fish Lake was 1.  In addition to Bluegill, Hybrid Sunfish and Pumpkinseed Sunfish were also measured during the assessment.  A total of 107 Hybrid Sunfish averaged 7.5 inches with a maximum length of 9.2 inches.  The PSD and RSD8 was 97 and 24, respectively.  A total of 103 Pumpkinseed Sunfish averaged 6.6 inches with a maximum length of 7.7 inches and a PSD of 59.   <br> \n <br> \nThe average replacement time for an eight inch sunfish in central Minnesota is 5 8 years.  Therefore anglers are encouraged to limit their harvest of larger Bluegill.  Especially adult males which are more colorful during the spring time when they are in the process of spawning and are more easily exploited by anglers.  The larger male Bluegills are important to maintaining a healthy size structure as they limit the potential that the rest of the population can get to.  Anglers can help improve fishing for Bluegill on Big Fish Lake by selectively harvesting medium sized females and releasing larger males. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Big Fish Lake, located 5 miles north of Cold Spring in central Stearns County, is a scenic, clear water lake that offers a variety of angling and recreational opportunities. It has a maximum depth of 70 feet and a small watershed with a high percentage of undeveloped forest and grassland and a modest amount of cultivated farmland. A public access is located on the north side of the lake and offers two tiers of parking. The lake supports a diverse aquatic plant community that provide important fish habitat as well as shoreline protection from erosion.  Some of the more common submergent plant species include: coontail, northern watermilfoil, flatstem pondweed, water celery, and Canada waterweed. Emergent and floating leaf vegetation was found along 17% of the shoreline with cattail and white waterlily being the most common species. In 2020, the water quality of Big Fish Lake was excellent with clarity of 30 feet during the first week of August. Anglers can expect plenty of action for small Bluegill and Northern Pike, excellent Largemouth Bass fishing, as well as the potential for quality sized Black Crappie and Walleye. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike are abundant in Big Fish Lake and consist mainly of small \"hammer handles\". The gill net catch of pike was very similar to 2015 and average size remained small. <br> \n <br> \nThe net catch of Walleye in 2020 was less than half the expected rate for similar lakes but was similar to 2015. Walleye ranged in length from 7 to 24 inches with an average length and weight of 18 inches and 2.7 pounds. Growth rates of Walleye appear good but are limited by small sample sizes. <br> \n <br> \nDue to Covid-19 restrictions, Largemouth Bass were not sampled in 2020. However, previous electrofishing assessments have yielded catch rates at or above the average for other lakes in the Sauk Rapids Management Area. Largemouth Bass sampled in the summer gill nets and trap nets ranged in length from five to 15 inches with an average length of 11 inches.  <br> \n  <br> \nThe Bluegill catch in 2020 was lower than 2015 but still within the expected range. Big Fish Lake does not have a history of producing large sunfish, but some larger Bluegills were sampled in 2020. Bluegill sampled ranged in length from six to nine inches; however only 2% of the catch were longer than eight inches. Black Crappies have historically been sampled in low numbers and this was the case again in 2020. Although few were sampled, quality fish up to 11 inches were observed. <br> \n <br> \nBig Fish Lake is designated as infested with Zebra Mussels. Lake users are reminded to help reduce the spread of aquatic invasive species by remembering to pull their drain plug and drain all water from watercraft, including bilges, livewells and baitwells as well as inspect and remove any aquatic plants from watercraft and trailers. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

The fishery is comprised primarily of Northern Pike, Walleye, Largemouth Bass, and panfish. Compared to statewide net catches, Bowfin, Brown Bullhead, Yellow Perch, Pumpkinseed, and the Black Crappie population were of low abundance.  Black Bullheads were of average abundance, while all other species were of above average in abundance. Growth rates for all species was average with the following exceptions:  Age 1 Northern Pike and age 2 Walleye which had fast growth rates.  Bluegill showed a slow growth rate and are probably stunted because of their high numbers.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Big Fish Lake, located 5 miles north of Cold Spring in central Stearns County, is a clear water lake that offers a variety of angling and recreational opportunities. Gamefish species present in Big Fish Lake are Northern Pike, Walleye, Largemouth Bass, Bluegill, and Black Crappie. Forage species present are Blackchin, Blacknose, Spottail, and Spotfin Shiners, Bluntnose Minnow, Banded Killifish, Iowa Darters. Yellow Perch, and White Suckers. \n\nThe Northern pike Population declined significantly from the 1980 survey, from 17.5 to 7.2/ gill net but remained with the expected range of values for lakes with similar characteristics. Age classes 1-5 and 7 were represented in the sample. Ages 1 and 3 were most abundant, accounting for 34 and 35% of the pike catch, respectively. The lengths range from 15 to 31 inches and average length was 21 inches, an increase of three inches over that of the 1980 survey. Growth rates were fast early and normal thereafter.\n\n The Walleye catch of 9.8/gill net was similar to the 1980 catch and remained above the normal range for similar lakes. Seventy-three percent of the sample was age 3 fish. Age classes 1, 2, 5, 6 and 7 were also represented, which closely corresponds to stocking records; the only discrepancy is two age 2 fish, which could be the result of carryover in the rearing pond. Lengths ranged from 7.2 to 26.3 inches, similar to the 1980 survey. Growth rates of Walleye were normal. \n\nLargemouth Bass were captured at rates of 4.8/gill net and 0.6/trap net. Though the trap net catch was average, the gillnet catch was high above the expected range for similar lakes, in addition, a spring seining yielded 66.4 bass/acre seined. Together, these figure indicate an above average bass population in Big Fish Lake. Age classes 1 through 6 were represented. Ages 1, 2, and 3 were equally abundant and numbers decline progressively thereafter. Lengths ranged from 6.0 to 17.7 inches and growth rates were average. \n\nBluegill numbers were similar to the 1975 and 1980 surveys and trap net catches remained well above the expected range. Ages 3-8 were represented. Lengths ranged from 3.0 to 7.3 with an average length of 4.7 inches. Growth rates were slow, averaging 65% of normal. Bluegill young of the year were abundant in the shoreline seining sample. \n\nThe Black Crappie catch increased from the previous survey to within the expected range, however age 2 crappies of 5.6 to 7.8 inches dominated the catch. The growth rates of crappies were normal. \n\nThe Yellow Perch population remained low, down from 6.3/gill net in the 1975 survey. \n\nWhite Suckers, Common Carp, Black and Yellow Bullhead, and Green Sunfish were also present but catch rates for all were below the expected local catch ranges. Pumpkinseed and hybrid sunfish numbers exceeded their local catch ranges. Spottail Shiners were the most abundant forage species, followed by Banded Killifish and Blacknose Shiners.\n\n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Big Fish Lake, located 5 miles north of Cold Spring in central Stearns County, is a scenic, clear water lake that offers a variety of angling and recreational opportunities.  It has a maximum depth of 70 feet and a small watershed with a high percentage of undeveloped forest and grassland and a modest amount of cultivated farmland.  A public access is located on the north side of the lake and offers two tiers of parking.  The lake supports diverse vegetation beds that provide important fish habitat as well as shoreline protection from erosion.   <br> \n <br> \nBig Fish Lake has an abundant Northern Pike population dominated by small fish.  This results in an unbalanced fishery where too many predators over eat their prey (primarily Yellow Perch) and makes Walleye stocking less effective.  Too address this problem; a 24 to 36 inch protected slot limit for Northern Pike was enacted in 2005.  A standard summer survey along with a targeted ice out survey was conducted in 2015 in an attempt to evaluate the effects (if any) of this special regulation.  <br> \n <br> \nThe targeted ice out survey began on April 7th, 2015 when a large percentage of the lake was still covered in ice.  A total of 514 Northern Pike were sampled, and although pike up to 34 inches were found, the average length was only 17.1 inches. The percentage of Northern Pike longer than 24 inches was 3% , compared to previous ice out surveys from 2010 (7%), and 2005 (3%).  The results of the summer survey were more encouraging as the catch rate of Northern Pike (9.7/ gill net) decreased significantly from the all-time high observed in 2010 (20.1/gill net).  However, the catch remained above management goals.  Northern Pike ranged in length from 10 to 35 inches and averaged 17.4 inches and 1.4 pounds.  This was a small improvement from previous surveys.  Recruitment of small Northern Pike remained high however, as 19 percent of pike sampled were less than 14 inches in length.  The future of the special pike regulation is uncertain and public input meetings will be held to decide what course of action to take <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Big Fish Lake, located 5 miles north of Cold Spring in central Stearns County, is a clear water lake that offers a variety of angling and recreational opportunities. Gamefish species present in Big Fish Lake are Northern Pike, Walleye, Largemouth Bass, Bluegill, and Black Crappie. Forage species present were Yellow Perch, and White Suckers. \n\nThe Northern pike Population was similar to the 1986 survey, from 7.2 to 8.2/ gill net and remained with the expected range of values for lakes with similar characteristics.  Northern Pike of ages 1-6 were sampled, and year class strength appeared fairly consistent.  Lengths ranged from 15.0 to 30.0 inches while numbers, and growth were all average. \n\nThe Walleye catch of 2.8/gill net showed a significant decrease from the high numbers in the 1986 survey (9.8/ gill net) and fell to below the normal range for similar lakes. Ages 2-4, 6, 8, 10, and 11 were present.  These ages correspond to years Walleye were stocked.  Lengths ranged from 10.5 to 26.0 inches, with highest numbers from 19-21.  Female Walleye outnumbered males in gill nets 17:2. Growth rates of Walleye were normal.\n \nYellow Perch were present in low numbers and have shown little change in the last 3 surveys.  Age i2 and 3 were present, and growth was average. \n \nLargemouth Bass spring electrofishing yielded 102 bass in 90 minutes for catch rate of 68.0/ hour. This figure indicates an above average bass population in Big Fish Lake. Largemouth Bass were 6.0 to 15.0 inches long and 18% of the catchable bass were greater than 12 inches in length.\n\nBluegill numbers were average for this lake class (44.1/trap net); previously, numbers had been above the expected range of values for the lake type.  Ages 1-6 were present, and growth of Bluegill remained slow (5.5 inches at age 5) the average length of Bluegill was 4.8 inches. \n\nBlack Crappie were sampled in low numbers, and size was average. Ages ranged from 1-4 and no young-of-year Black Crappie were seen during shoreline seining.  Growth was average; lengths ranged from 4.0 to 10.4 inches.\n\nOther species sampled included: Black, Brown and Yellow Bullhead, Bowfin (dogfish), Green and Hybrid Sunfish, Pumpkinseed, and White Sucker.\n\n</p>",
