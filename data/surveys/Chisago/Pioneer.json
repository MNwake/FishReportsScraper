Nine trapnets were set in Pioneer Lake on July 30, 2001 to assess the current fish population.  The net catch was sparse overall.  The catch consisted of 38 black bullheads, 5 yellow bullheads, 3 bluegill, and 2 pumpkinseed sunfish.  Based on the net catch it is fairly aparent that a severe winterkill occured during the early months of 2001.  Bass and panfish were reported to be abundant in the summer of 2000 and will likely repopulate through immigration from North Center Lake.</p>",
