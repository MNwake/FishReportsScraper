Despite recent stocking, the walleye catch in 2008 remained low, virtually unchanged from catches seen in this lake in the 1970s, prior to stocking beginning. <br> \n <br> \nThe northern pike catch in 2008 was fairly high for this lake historically, mainly due to a strong 2006 year class that accounted for almost three-quarters of the fish taken.  Growth of those younger northern pike had been fairly fast by area standards, despite the lack of forage in this lake.  The northern pike catch included one exceptionally large (for this lake) fish, otherwise most of the fish taken were 16 to 22 inches in length. <br> \n <br> \nThe lake supported a few smallmouth bass and yellow perch in 2008.  Although not taken in 2008, white sucker were probably also present in small numbers, since they have often been found in this lake in the past. <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

The first was completed in 2008, and yielded results similar to those seen in this assessment. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance in East Pope Lake was low in 2013, as it has been in most years in this lake.  Walleye collected ranged in length from 18.7 to 22.1 inches, and all were at least five years of age.  There was no evidence that recent walleye fingerling stocking had resulted in increased walleye abundance in this lake.  The walleye gill net catch in 2013 was similar to catches seen in past assessments of this lake.  Like catches in all previous assessments, the 2013 catch fell well short of the long range goal (4.0 fish/set) established for the species in the 2001 management plan.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike were fairly abundant in East Pope Lake in 2013, although few large fish were present.  The 2013 northern pike gill net catch was similar to the catch observed in 2008, and was one of the higher catches observed in this lake since 1957.  Five year classes, all naturally produced, contributed to the catch, and fish as old as seven years were taken.    Growth of young northern pike had been fairly fast; two-year-old fish reached a mean length of 18.9 inches by the end of their second year, compared to an area average of 14.3 inches.  Growth was apparently much slower after age 2; fish had reached a mean length of just 22.0 inches after five years.  Forage for larger northern pike was limited; abundance of yellow perch and white sucker appeared to have been very low in 2013 (as it also was in 2008). <br> \n <br> \nThe capture of two bluegill in trap nets in 2013 marks the first time that species has been sampled in East Pope Lake.  Smallmouth bass were also present in 2013; a single fish was taken in gill nets.  Although that catch fell below the normal range for the lake class, it may not have been indicative of true smallmouth bass abundance in this lake, since gill nets are a poor tool for sampling the species.  No white sucker were taken in this assessment, but they have been taken in past assessments of this lake, and were likely still present in low numbers in 2013. <br> \n  <br> \n </p>",

The catch of walleye in trap nets was below the normal range for lakes of this class.  Growth of walleye was about normal for lakes in this area.The catch of northern pike in gill nets during this assessment was below the normal range for lakes of this class, but was the highest catch rate for the four assessments since the 1977 assessment.   The catch of smallmouth bass in gill nets was at the low end of the normal range for lakes of this class.  2000 is the first year that smallmouth bass were caught with any gear during any assessment, historically.The catch of white sucker in gill nets was below the normal range for lakes of this class.  The catch of white sucker in trap nets was within the normal range for lakes of this class.  The catch of white sucker has historically been low in this lake.Six 1/4 in trap nets were set to sample for minnows and natural reproduction.  No minnows were caught and no YOY of any species were caught.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>East Pope is a small, shallow lake that has been managed for Walleye since 1978.  Although Walleye were regularly stocked, their numbers never really improved, with a gill net catch that peaked at just 1.67 fish/set in 2000.  In the latest (2015) lake management plan, stocking of the lake was discontinued, and Northern Pike were made the primary management species, with Walleye a secondary species.  This was the first of two standard surveys scheduled by the 2015 plan to determine the effects of discontinued stocking on the Walleye population and determine whether the lake would develop a significant Bluegill population capable of supporting a limited fishery. <br> \n <br> \nThe Walleye gill net catch in this survey was low, falling below the normal range for a lake of this class, and below the goal set for the population in the 2015 plan (a minimum of 1.00 fish/set).  However, the catch was similar to catches seen in this lake in the last two surveys (2013 and 2008), when the lake was still being stocked.  All four of the Walleye taken in gill nets and trap nets had apparently been naturally produced in years when no stocking was done (2012 and 2013).  Part of the Walleye goal for this lake was maintaining a self-sustained population, and it appeared that goal might be attainable, even if numbers were low. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill were first found in East Pope Lake in the 2013 survey.  Results of this survey suggest they have been able to reproduce successfully, and produce some fish large enough to be of interest to anglers.  The catch in 0.75-in-mesh trap nets in 2018 was considerably higher than the catch seen in 2013, and was well above the normal range for a lake of this type.  Most of the fish taken were small (and young), but the capture of one 10.6-inch fish indicated fish of exceptional size could be produced in the lake.   Growth rates for young Bluegill had been about average for the area; fish reached a mean length of 4.4 inches at the end of their third year, compared to an area mean of 4.8 inches. <br> \n <br> \nThe Northern Pike gill net catch in 2018 was low for a lake of this type, but was similar to many catches seen in the past in this lake.  The catch fell a little short of the goal from the 2015 plan (a minimum of 2.3 fish/set), but the size goal in that plan (a minimum mean weight of 1.4 lb/fish) was met.  The catch included fish up to 25.2 inches in length.   Growth had been somewhat slower than average; five-year-old fish reached a mean length of 23.4 inches at the end of their fifth year, compared to a mean of 25.3 inches for similar lakes in this area. <br> \n <br> \nSmallmouth Bass have been taken in this lake in the past, and were likely still present in 2018, even though none were sampled.  Their numbers were likely low. <br> \n <br> \nForage for Northern Pike and Walleye appeared to have been limited.  No Yellow Perch were taken in standard gill or trap net sets, although a few small perch were captured in quarter-inch-mesh trap nets.  Other fish species present that might have provided some forage included Green Sunfish and Blacknose Shiner.    <br> \n</p>",
