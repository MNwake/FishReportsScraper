                "narrative": "<p>East Toqua is a shallow, 400 acre lake located near the City of Graceville in west-central Minnesota.  It has been primarily managed for walleye, with secondary emphasis on northern pike, crappie and yellow perch.  Although an aeration system has been in operation since 1985, periodic winterkill have occurred.  Dissolved oxygen concentrations fell to the point of winterkill again in 2004.  An ice-out evalutation revealed that the winterkill did affect most fish species within East Toqua Lake, as dead black bullhead, bluegill, carp, channel catfish, crappie, walleye and white bass were observed.  However, trap nets sampled a variety of live fish, indicating the winterkill was not extensive.    Assessment nets set in early summer sampled a low number of walleye.  Walleye abundance decreased considerably since the 2001 assessment.  Partial winterkills in 2003 and 2004, coupled with high angler harvest of walleye in 2002 and 2003 are likely explanations for this decrease.  Fry stocking in 2004 produced a moderate number of fingerling (5-7 inch) walleye in East Toqua Lake.  Considering typical growth rates for this lake, anglers can expect many of these walleye to measure 11-13 inches by the winter of 2005.  Fry will also be stocked in 2005.     Northern pike were also sampled in low abundance.  Most pike measured 20-25 inches, with individuals measuring 28, 34 and 37 inches also sampled.  Because northern pike are more tolerant of low dissolved oxygen concentrations, it is likely their decreased abundance is due to low spring water levels that reduced spawning habitat.  Heavy fall rains in 2004 increased lake levels by two feet.  This increase should enhance northern pike spawning success in 2005.     Yellow perch were moderately abundant in 2004.  Most sampled perch measured over eight inches.  Considering current growth rates, anglers should expect a good number of perch to measure 10-11 inches by fall, 2005.       Black and white crappie were reintroduced following a winterkill in 1993.  Since that stocking, both species have reestablished themselves as self-sustaining populations.  In 2004, crappie were abundant.  Most sampled crappie were quality sized, measuring 9-11 inches.  Considering low predator abundance, crappie populations may increase over the next few years, although few young-of-year crappie were sampled in 2004.     Low numbers of bluegill have been caught in each of the past two assessments.  All sampled bluegill belonged to the 1999 year class and had likely migrated into East Toqua via Twelve Mile Creek during a 1997 flood.  In 2004, these bluegill were large, measuring 8-9 inches.  Many bluegill in East Toqua Lake have been sexually mature for two years, yet successful reproduction has not occurred.  Although adequate bluegill spawning habitat is available, a lack of nursery habitat (submergent vegetation) has likely limited reproduction.     Black bullhead and common carp were moderate to abundant.  Bullhead anglers would be interested in East Toqua as the majority sampled measured 10-12 inches. Carp were also large.  Many measured over 20 inches.   Numerous young-of-year of each specie were caught in 2004.  Population expansions of either of these species may be to the detriment of more desirable fish populations.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>East Toqua is a large (446 acres), shallow (mean depth of 6 feet) lake located in the town of Graceville, MN.  Primary management species include walleye, northern pike, crappie, and yellow perch.  An aeration system has been operated on East Toqua since 1985.  However, dissolved oxygen concentrations have frequently fallen below 2 parts per million.  Recently, this has occurred during the winter of 2003-2004 and 2005-2006.  A new aeration system has since been installed, and its improved type and location will likely result in fewer winterkills.  This is the first population assessment since East Toqua experienced its latest winterkill. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye that have been stocked into East Toqua following the winterkill consisted of 402,282 fry in the spring of 2006 and 2007, 27,510 fingerlings in the fall of 2006, and 5,505 yearlings and 881 adults in the spring and fall of 2006.  Gill nets used during this survey captured 133.5 walleye per net, which is almost 20 times higher than the average catch rate for walleye in lakes similar to East Toqua.  This is the highest catch rate ever recorded for East Toqua. Walleye caught in the gill nets had a mean length 13.5 inches and a mean weight of 0.9 lb.  Walleye up to 19 inches long were sampled.  All of the walleye were 3 years old or younger.  Trap nets caught 20.7 walleye per net, but most were 7-9 inches long.  Fall elctrofishing was conducted to evaluate the walleye fry stocking.  Prior to stocking, the fry were marked with oxytetracycline (OTC).  Unfortunately, no young-of-year (YOY) walleye were sampled during electrofishing.  However, seining that was conducted in July found two YOY walleye.  Evaluation of the fish for OTC found no chemical mark.  These may have been a result of natural reproduction or they may have immigrated into East Toqua from Lannon Lake, a connected waterbody that had unmarked walleye fry stocked in the spring of 2007.  Despite the lack of an abundant 2007 year class, the walleye population is abundant and anglers can expect excellent fishing. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike were not as frequent of an occurrence as walleye during this survey.  Following the winterkill, 201 adult pike were stocked into East Toqua, but only 1.5 pike were caught per gill net.  This catch rate is within the normal range for East Toqua.  Pike were 25 inches long or less, with an average weight of 2.4 lbs.  Quarter-inch trap nets and seining sampled five YOY pike, indicating some natural reproduction occurring within the lake.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie were abundant in gill nets (185.5 per net) and trap nets (127 per net).  Adult black crappies (226) were stocked into East Toqua in the spring of 2006, and appear to have reproduced successfully. Ninety-five percent of the black crappie aged were yearlings (2006 year class).  As expected due to the abundance of the 2006 year class, average size was small.  Most black crappie were 5-6 inches long, but individuals up to 13 inches long were sampled.  White crappie were also sampled in gill nets (8.5 per net) and trap nets (5.7 per net).  All white crappie sampled were less than seven inches long and yearlings.  Based on these abundant 2006 year classes, future fishing opportunities for crappies should arise in the near future. <br> \n <br> \nYearling yellow perch (3,810) were stocked in the spring of 2007 and adults (4,275 total) were stocked in the spring of 2006 and 2007.  Gill nets sampled 27 per net and trap nets captured 5.3 per net.  All yellow perch were three years old or younger, and had a mean length of 8 inches in gill nets and 6 inches in trap nets.  The largest yellow perch sampled was 11.3 inches long.  Shoreline seining in July captured 16.7 YOY yellow perch per seine pull, indicating natural reproduction is occurring.  The yellow perch population in East Toqua should continue to develop and provide future angling opportunities. <br> \n <br> \nAdult bluegills (623) were stocked in the spring of 2006, quarter-inch trap nets captured 107.2 YOY bluegill per net in August of 2006, but few bluegills were sampled in trap nets during this survey (3.3 per net).  Historically, bluegill have not been abundant in East Toqua and the trap net catch observed during this survey is the highest ever recorded.  The 2006 year-class made up 75% of the bluegills aged with individuals up to 8 years old sampled.  Average size was 4.7 inches and 0.1 lb.  Quarter-inch trap nets did not sample any YOY bluegill, indicating a missing 2007 year class.  The absence of vegetation in East Toqua is likely related to the unsuccessful population of bluegill. <br> \n <br> \nSeveral non-game fish species were present during this survey, including bigmouth buffalo (79 per gill net), black bullhead (66 per gill net), common carp (21.5 per gill net), white sucker (8.5 per gill net), and yellow bullhead (5 per trap net).  The catch rates of bigmouth buffalo, white sucker, and yellow bullhead during this survey were record highs for East Toqua.  All the buffalo sampled in gill nets were less than 11 inches long.  White suckers were also small, with most individuals averaging 8.5 inches.  Other species sampled in low abundance were orangespotted sunfish and fathead minnow. <br> \n <br> \nFuture management activities planned for East Toqua include monitoring winter dissolved oxygen levels and fishing pressure, fall electrofishing for YOY walleye, and a resurvey scheduled for 2010.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>East Toqua Lake is a shallow nutrient rich lake located in Big Stone County in west-central Minnesota.  It is presently managed for walleye.  Although it contains an aeration system, the lake occasionally experiences winterkill.  The most recent winterkill occurred the winter of 1992-1993, resulting in the death of most game fish.  Since that time, walleye fry stocking and natural reproduction by northern pike has resulted in an abundant game fish population.  Both species were present in 1995 at levels substantially higher than normal for lakes like East Toqua.  The walleye were nice sized with numerous fish present from 14-18 inches.  Northern pike primarily ranged from 18-24 inches.     Numbers of other game fish species were low.  Although white crappie were stocked in 1994, only two were sampled in 1995.  No yellow perch were sampled.  Few adult black bullhead and carp were sampled, however numerous young-of-year were found and these species will probably re-establish substantial populations.     Walleye, northern pike, bluegill, yellow perch, and crappie have historically experienced limited natural reproduction in East Toqua Lake.  Walleye fry stocking appears to have resulted in several strong year classes.  Past bluegill and crappie stockings appear to have met with little success.  Black bullhead and carp have regularly produced strong natural year classes, and maintained high populations.  These species, along with orangespotted sunfish, constitute the majority of the forage base for walleye and northern pike.     Other than a lack of suitable spawning substrate, habitat conditions of East Toqua Lake are appropriate for walleye management, and walleye fry stockings will be continued.</p>",

THESE CATCH RATES APPEAR TO DIFFER LITTLE FROM THOSE OF PREVIOUS SURVEYS. THE LENGTH FREQUENCY AND AGE DISTRIBUTION INDICATE STRONG YEAR CLASSES IN YEARS OF FRY STOCKING. IN YEARS OF NO STOCKING A SMALL NUMBER OF WALLEYE WERE STILL FOUND. THIS INDICATES IN THOSE YEARS THAT SOME NATURAL REPRO- DUCTION HAS OCCURRED. THE GROWTH RATES FOR WALLEYE ON EAST TOQUA ARE AVERAGE FOR THE AREA. THE WHITE AND BLACK CRAPPIE POPULATIONS ARE ABOVE THE STATE AVERAGE IN BOTH PDS AND NUMBERS PER GILLNET AND TRAPNET. THE LAST STOCKING OF CRAPPIE WAS 1980, INDICATING THAT ALL THE CRAPPIE CAUGHT WERE NATURAL REPRODUCED THE GROWTH RATES OF CRAPPIE ARE AVERAGE FOR THE AREA. THE FISH POPULATION OF EAST TOQUA, AS MEASURED BY THE NET CATCHES, WERE AT OR ABOVE PREVIOUS NET CATCHES, EXCEPT FOR WALLEYE. WALLEYE CATCHES DROPPED FROM 51.5/GILLNET SET AND 49.25 LBS/GILL- NET SET IN 1984 TO 31.75/GILLNET SET AND 31.95 LBS/GILLNET SET IN 1987.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>East Toqua Lake is located adjacent to Graceville in west central Minnesota.  It measures 428 acres and has a maximum depth of 6 feet.  The lake is highly productive and often quite turbid.  Toqua County Park is located along the south shoreline and it offers convenient shore angling locations, boat launching, picnicking, and camping.  The lake is managed primarily for northern pike and walleye, with secondary emphasis on black crappie and yellow perch. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye were abundant in 2014 and most measured 15-19 inches.  Comments from anglers suggest that recent walleye fishing has been poor.  A fair number of fathead minnows were caught in small mesh trap nets and adequate forage abundance may have been the cause of decreased angling success.  Fisheries assessments have indicated that the vast majority of walleye have resulted from stocking.  However, a moderate 2014 walleye year class was present which likely resulted from natural reproduction.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike were moderately abundant in 2014 and most fish were 16-26 inches.  Three year classes were present and all were the result of natural reproduction.  Northern pike have been stocked in the past and have also contributed to the fishery at times.  Northern pike typically grow fast and die young in East Toqua Lake.  Few pike older than age four have been sampled.  Adequate forage is typically available to allow pike to grow fast, however cool water refuge areas do not exist and pike likely experience mortality due to high water temperatures during the heat of the summer.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch abundance was high in 2014 and the gill net catch was the highest that has occurred in the twelve fisheries investigations that have been conducted since 1984.  The increase of yellow perch resulted from a 2014 spring stocking of 5,100 yearlings and adults.  Perch up to 10 inches were sampled, but most fish measured 5-7 inches and should reach sizes desired by anglers by the fall of 2015.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie were in low abundance and measured from 4-12 inches.  A moderate number of young-of-year crappie were also sampled, indicating good reproduction occurred in 2014. <br> \n <br> \nBlack bullheads were abundant in 2014.  Some bullheads measured up to 11 inches, but most were less than seven inches and wouldn't have drawn much angler interest.   <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species sampled in low to moderate abundance included bluegill, common carp, white sucker, and yellow bullhead.  Bluegill have been stocked in the past and have been shown to readily reproduce in the lake.  However, little nursery habitat in the form of submergent vegetation is available for young bluegills and their survival has been poor. <br> \n <br> \nFisheries management activities scheduled for East Toqua Lake include annual fish assessments, monitoring of winter dissolved oxygen and ice-fishing pressure, and stocking various fish species as appropriate. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>East Toqua Lake is located in Graceville in west-central Minnesota.  It is 428 acres and has a maximum depth of nine feet.  The lake is highly productive and water clarity is often low.  Toqua County Park is located along the south shoreline and it provides a boat launch, convenient shore angling, picnicking and camping.  Toqua Lake is managed primarily for Walleyes, with secondary emphasis on Black Crappies, Northern Pike and Yellow Perch.  This 2020 Targeted Survey collected routine fish population data using gill nets and trap nets.  These data can be compared to historical Standard and Targeted Survey data from East Toqua Lake. <br> \n <br> \nWalleyes were abundant and the majority were 14-20 inches.  A strong 2016 Walleye year class was present and those fish averaged 19 inches.  Walleyes were also present from four other year classes.  Walleye natural reproduction has been poor and Walleye fry are routinely stocked to maintain the population.  Walleye fry are also stocked into Lannon Lake and Golf Course Pond, and some of those Walleyes likely contribute to the East Toqua population by downstream migration.  <br> \n <br> \nAnglers have reported catching large Northern Pike on occasion, however in the last few surveys pike numbers were relatively low.  Pike typically grow fast and die young in East Toqua Lake.  Adequate forage is usually available to allow pike to grow fast, however most of them have typically disappeared from the population before reaching five years of age.  Pike are very susceptible to angling and are often removed from the population prior to reaching 30 inches.  In addition, cool-water refuge areas do not exist in East Toqua Lake and some pike likely die due to high water temperatures during the heat of the summer.  Northern Pike are stocked when needed and available.  East Toqua Lake is in the north-central management zone meaning the possession limit is 10 Northern Pike but not more than two pike may be longer than 26 inches; and all from 22 to 26 inches must be released.  Spearers must follow the same rules except one pike may be between 22 and 26 inches or two larger than 26 inches.    <br> \n <br> \nRelatively high numbers of Yellow Perch were present in 2020.  More than 40% of the perch were over nine inches including several over 12 inches.  Yellow Perch are stocked when numbers become low but natural reproduction has sustained the population in recent years. <br> \n <br> \nAdult Black Crappies were present in low numbers but high numbers of young-of-year crappies were sampled in recent surveys, and in 2020, indicating good natural reproduction has occurred.  Walleye predation of young crappies has likely been limiting their survival to adulthood. <br> \n <br> \nBluegills had been stocked historically and they have readily reproduced at times.  However, little habitat in the form of rooted plants has been present to provide cover and food for young Bluegills and their survival has been poor. <br> \n <br> \nFisheries management activities scheduled for East Toqua Lake include fish surveys, winter oxygen monitoring and stocking fish as appropriate. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>East Toqua Lake is located adjacent to Graceville in west-central Minnesota.  It is 428 acres and has a maximum depth of 9 feet.  The lake is highly productive and water clarity is often low.  Toqua County Park along the south shoreline has a boat launch, convenient shore angling, picnicking and camping.  The lake is managed primarily for Walleyes, with secondary emphasis on Black Crappie, Northern Pike and Yellow Perch.  This standard survey was conducted to collect routine fish population data using gill nets, standard trap nets and quarter-inch trap nets.  These data can be compared to historical standard and targeted survey data from East Toqua Lake. <br> \n <br> \nWalleyes were abundant during 2017.  The majority of them were 15-20 inches, but Walleyes up to 28 inches were also present.  Although most Walleyes have come from DNR stockings, an abundant, naturally produced 2014 year class accounted for 28% of the Walleyes caught in 2017.  These fish averaged 16 inches.     <br> \n <br> \nAnglers reported catching some large Northern Pike in 2017, however pike numbers were relatively low based on DNR sampling.  The largest pike sampled in 2017 was 38 inches and 11.6 lbs.  Pike typically grow fast and die young in East Toqua Lake.  Adequate forage is usually available to allow pike to grow fast, however most of them have typically disappeared from the population before reaching five years of age.  Pike are very susceptible to angling and are often removed from the population prior to reaching 30 inches.  In addition, cool-water refuge areas do not exist in East Toqua Lake and some pike likely die due to high water temperatures during the heat of the summer.   <br> \n <br> \nDecent numbers of Yellow Perch were present in 2017, similar to the last survey which occurred in 2014.  Perch were desirable in 2017 with 75% exceeding nine inches, some of which were over 11 inches.  The recent increase in Yellow Perch numbers resulted from stocking yearlings and adults in 2014 and 2016. <br> \n <br> \nAdult Black Crappies were present in low numbers.  A high number of young-of-year crappies were sampled, indicating good reproduction occurred in 2017.  However, given the high Walleye population and the likelihood of substantial predation, survival of these young crappies to adulthood isn't guaranteed. <br> \n <br> \nBluegills have been stocked historically and they have readily reproduced.  However, little habitat in the form of submerged or emerged aquatic plants has been present to provide cover and food for young Bluegills and their survival has been poor. <br> \n <br> \nFisheries management activities scheduled for East Toqua Lake include fish surveys, winter oxygen monitoring, January fishing pressure counts and stocking fish when appropriate. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>East Toqua Lake is a shallow, nutrient rich lake located in Big Stone County in west-central Minnesota.  It is managed for walleye, crappie, and northern pike.  Although East Toqua Lake contains an aeration system, it has occasionally experienced winterkills.  The last winterkill was during the winter of 1992-93 and most game fish died.  Since then, walleye fry stocking, adult crappie stocking, and natural reproduction by northern pike have resulted in abundant game fish populations.     Walleye were extremely abundant in 1998 with fish present from 7-24 inches, but especially abundant from 8-15 inches.  Strong walleye year classes have usually corresponded to fry stocked years, and stocking appears to be primarily responsible for maintaining the walleye population.  Walleye fry will continue to be stocked every two of three years.     Moderate numbers of northern pike were present in 1998.  Their numbers were down substantially from 1995, when the last DNR assessment was conducted.  This was probably due to harvest that occurred during the 1997-98 winter.  Spearers and anglers harvested high numbers of northern pike that winter in the vicinity of the aeration system.     East Toqua Lake was stocked with white crappies in 1994 and black crappies in 1996.  Both species have developed self-sustaining populations.  Crappies were moderately abundant in 1998.  Considering the high number of predators that were present in 1998, crappies are unlikely to become extremely abundant within the next couple of years.     Upcoming DNR fisheries management activities that are planned for East Toqua Lake include walleye fry stocking in 1999 and 2000; annual fall electrofishing to evaluate young walleye abundances; and a fish population assessment in 2001.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>     East Toqua Lake is located adjacent to Graceville in west central Minnesota.  It measures 446 acres and has a maximum depth of 6 feet.  The lake is highly productive and often quite turbid.  The Graceville Sportsmens Club operated a diffuser aeration system there from 1985-2006, however winterkill still occasionally occurred.  Since then a new style aeration system has been used that should reduce the likelihood of winterkill.  Toqua County Park is located along the south shoreline and it offers convenient shore angling locations, boat launching, picnicking, and camping. <br> \n     Anglers typically pursue walleye, northern pike, black crappie, bluegill, yellow perch, or black bullhead at East Toqua Lake.  Walleye were moderately abundant in 2010 and most fish measured 5-19 inches.  The walleye came from fry and yearlings stocked in 2009, and fry stocked in 2010.  The fry were stocked into upstream walleye ponds (Lannon and Golf Course) and eventually migrated downstream into East Toqua Lake.  Very little walleye natural reproduction has ever been observed in East Toqua Lake. <br> \n      The 2010 northern pike catch was relatively low and they measured 20-34 inches.  The 2008 year class was most abundant.  Many of the northern pike came from 2006, 2008, and 2009 winter rescue stockings. <br> \n     Adult black crappie, bluegill, and yellow perch were stocked following the 2005-06 winterkill.  They experienced successful natural reproduction and have been present in low to moderate numbers. <br> \n</p>",

YOY NOP, BLG, BLC AND YEP WERE SAMPLED IN THE NATURAL REPRODUCTION CHECK IN 1986.  THIS WAS THE FIRST TIME THESE SPECIES WERE SAMPLED IN THE LAKE.  MOST OF THESE NEW SPECIES MAY BE ATTRIBUTED TO MIGRATION INTO THE LAKE FROM THE MUSTINKA RIVER SYSTEM IN THE HIGH WATER YEARS OF 1986.  AND 1987. A SCREEN WAS INSTALLED AT THE OUTLET IN 1986 TO PREVENT THE INGRESS OF CARP.  IT APPEARS THAT IT HASN'T BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN KEEPING FISH FROM ENTERING THE LAKE.  TEN SPECIES OF FISH WERE SAMPLED IN 1992.  OSS AND FRD WERE CAUGHT IN GILL NETS AND/OR TRAP NETS FOR THE FIRST TIME.  YEB, BRB AND WHB WERE SAMPLED IN 1987, BUT NOT IN 1992. NOP CATCH PER GILL NET DECREASED FROM 4.3 FISH IN 1987 TO 0.5 IN 1992.  THE PRESENT CATCH RATE IS SUBSTANTIALLY BELOW THE NORMAL RANGE FOR LAKE CLASS 43.  AGE CLASSES 2+ AND 3+ WERE PRESENT AND EXHIBITED FAST GROWTH RELATIVE TO STATE GAME FISH GROWTH RATE TABLES.  MEAN SIZE OF GILL NET PIKE WAS 26.5 INCHES AND 4.5 POUNDS.  PIKE HAVEN'T BEEN STOCKED IN THE LAST FIFTY YEARS.  THE PIKE POPULATION APPEARS TO BE MAINTAINED BY MIGRANTS AS SPAWNING AREAS ARE VERY MARGINAL IN THE LAKE. THE ONLY TIME YOY PIKE WERE SAMPLED WAS IN 1986, A HIGH WATER YEAR.  THESE YOY MAY HAVE BEEN MIGRANTS.  ADULT PIKE WERE SAMPLED IN COMMERCIAL FISHERMEN SEINE HAULS FOR THE FIRST TIME IN 1985- 86 AND IN ASSESSMENT NETTING IN 1987.  NORTHERN PIKE RUNS UP THE WEST BRANCH OF TWELVE MILE CREEK AND INTO THE LAKE HAVE BEEN NOTED IN PREVIOUS YEARS.  A SCREEN INSTALLED AT THE OUTLET MAY PREVENT MOST ADULT PIKE FROM ENTERING, BUT WOULD'T INTERFERE WITH THE INGRESS OF FINGERLINGS. ONE BLG WAS SAMPLED IN 1992.  THE FISH, AGE 4+, WAS MOST LIKELY FROM A STOCKING OF ADULT FISH IN 1990.  THREE YOY BLG WERE SAMPLED IN 1986, BUT THE LAKE ISN'T REALLY SUITABLE TO MAINTAIN A NATURALLY REPRODUCING POPULATION.  THERE ARE SAMPLE SANDY AREAS IN THE LAKE FOR SPAWNING,  BUT NONE OF THESE AREAS ARE PROTECTED FROM WAVE ACTION.  THERE IS ALSO A LACK OF SUBMERGED MACROPHYTES FOR YOY COVER.  BLG ARE AMONG THE FIRST FISH TO DIE IN WINTER KILL SITUATIONS. SINCE EAST TOQUA HAS A HISTORY OF WINTER KILL, STOCKING OF BLG MAY NOT BE FEASIBLE UNLESS A MORE RELIABLE AERATION SYSTEM IS INSTALLED IN THE LAKE. WHC CATCH PER TRAP NET DECREASED FROM 10.5 FISH IN 1987 TO 0.2 IN 1992 (ONLY 2 FISH).  THE PRESENT CATCH RATE IS SLIGHTLY LESS THAN THE LOW END OF THE NORMAL RANGE FOR LAKE CLASS 43.  BOTH CRAPPIES WERE AGE 3+.  WHC WERE INITIALLY SAMPLED IN 1987.  THOSE FISH WERE MIGRANTS OR ILLEGALLY INTRODUCED BY PRIVATE INDIVIDUALS, AS NO WHC HAD BEEN STOCKED IN THE LAKE BY DEPARTMENT OF NATURAL RESOURCES PERSONNEL.  CRAPPIES SAMPLED IN 1992 MAY BE FROM NATURAL REPRODUCTION OR MIGRATION.  NO YOY WHC HAVE BEEN SAMPLED IN THE LAKE.  BLC CATCH PER GILL NET DECREASED FROM 3.3 FISH IN 1987 TO 1.7 IN 1992.  THIS PRESENT CATCH RATE IS WITHIN THE NORMAL RANGE FOR LAKE CLASS 43. YOY BLC WERE SAMPLED IN 1986, BUT ALL FISH COLLECTED IN THE PRESENT SURVEY WERE AGE 3+, INDICATING SPORADIC NATURAL REPRODUCTION.  THE SAME SPAWNING AREA DEFICIENCIES NOTED FOR BLG ALSO PERTAIN TO CRAPPIES.  MEAN SIZES OF BLC INCREASED FROM 6.1 INCHES AND 0.3 POUNDS IN 1987 TO 9.4 INCHES AND 0.6 POUNDS IN 1992.  ALL FISH COLLECTED IN THE PRESENT SURVEY EXHIBITED FAST GROWTH.  YEP CATCH PER GILL NET DECREASED FROM 6.0 FISH IN 1987 TO 5.3 IN 1992.  THE PRESENT CATCH RATE IS NEAR THE LOW END OF THE NORMAL RANGE FOR LAKE CLASS 43. AGE CLASSES FROM YOY TO 3+ WERE PRESENT.  AGE 1+ FISH COMPRISED 77% OF THE CATCH.  YEP WERE FIRST SAMPLED IN 1986 AND MOST LIKELY ENTERED THE LAKE VIA THE WEST BRANCH OF TWELVE MILE CREEK. SINCE THEN, A NATURALLY REPRODUCING POPULATION HAS BECOME ESTABLISHED.  YOY SEINING CATCH RATE INCREASED FROM 100.0 FISH/ACRE IN 1986 TO 147.1 FISH/ACRE IN 1992.  THIRTEEN ADDITIONAL YOY WERE CAUGHT IN 1/4 FROM 2.3 TO 3.7 INCHES IN 1992.  MEAN SIZES OF PERCH DECREASED FROM 8.0 INCHES AND 0.3 POUNDS IN 1987 TO 6.8 INCHES AND 0.2 POUNDS IN 1992.  ALL AGE CLASSES EXHIBITED FAST GROWTH.  WAE CATCH PER GILL NET DECREASED FROM 31.8 FISH IN 1987 TO 11.3 IN 1992.  THE PRESENT CATCH RATE IS WITHIN THE NORMAL RANGE FOR LAKE CLASS 43.  NINE AGE CLASSES FROM YOY TO 2+, 4+ TO 8+ AND 10+ WERE PRESENT. MISSING AGE CLASSES CORRESPONDED TO NON-STOCKED YEARS.  SPORADIC NATURAL REPRODUCTION IS OCCURRING AS MOST NON-STOCKED YEARS HAD SOME WAE PRESENT. THE STRONGEST AGE CLASS WAS 1+ COMPRISING 48% OF SAMPLED FISH AND WAS A RESULT OF NATURAL REPRODUCTION.  MANY OTHER AREA LAKES ALSO HAD GOOD NATURAL REPRODUCTION IN 1991.  YOY SEINING CATCH RATE DECREASED FROM 18.1 FISH/ACRE IN 1984 TO 1.4 FISH/ACRE IN 1987 AND THEN INCREASED TO 79.4 FISH/ ACRE IN 1992.  FRY WERE STOCKED IN 1984 AND 1992 WHILE 1987 WAS A NON-STOCKED YEAR.  QUARTER INCH TRAP NETS SAMPLED 2.2 YOY PER SET IN 1992. ALTHOUGH THE LAKE EITHER HAS EXPERIENCED, OR IS IN DANGER OF, PARTIAL WINTER KILLS ANNUALLY, ENOUGH WAES APPEAR TO SURVIVE TO PROVIDE AN SAMPLE FISHERY EACH YEAR.  THE WAE ARE DIFFICULT TO CATCH DUE TO THE LACK OF STRUCTURE, BUT THEY ARE PRESENT IN GOOD NUMBERS AND SIZE RANGES.  MEAN SIZES INCREASED FROM 14.1 INCHES AND 1.0 POUND IN 1987 TO 14.8 INCHES AND 1.5 POUNDS IN 1992.  YOY WAE RANGED IN LENGTH FROM 3.2 TO 6.0 INCHES.  AGE CLASSES UP TO 4+ EXHIBITED FAST GROWTH WHILE AGE CLASSES OLDER THAN 4+ DISPLAYED AVERAGE GROWTH. CARP CATCH PER GILL NET DECREASED FROM 26.8 FISH IN 1987 TO 24.8 IN 1992.  THE PRESENT CATCH RATE IS SUBSTANTIALLY ABOVE THE NORMAL RANGE FOR LAKE CLASS 43.  MEAN SIZES OF CARP DECREASED FROM 16.6 INCHES AND 2.5 POUNDS IN 1987 TO 9.1 INCHES AND 0.4 POUNDS IN 1992.  A TOTAL OF 309,380 POUNDS OF CARP HAVE BEEN HARVESTED BY COMMERCIAL FISHERMEN OVER THE LAST FOUR YEARS OF REMOVAL. SEVENTY-NINE PERCENT OF THIS HARVEST (243,630 POUNDS) OCCURRED DURING THE WINTER OF 1987-88 (569 POUNDS/ACRE).  THE HIGH POPULATION OF CARP AND THEIR FEEDING ACTIVITY IS PROBABLY ADVERSELY AFFECTING THE SPAWNING SUCCESS OF CRAPPIES AND BLGS.  BLB CATCH PER GILL NET DECREASED FROM 26.5 FISH IN 1987 TO 6.2 IN 1992.  THE PRESENT CATCH RATE IS SUBSTANTIALLY BELOW THE NORMAL RANGE FOR LAKE CLASS 43.  MEAN SIZES OF BLH DECREASED FROM 9.5 INCHES AND 0.5 POUNDS IN 1987 TO 8.6 INCHES AND 0.4 POUNDS IN 1992.  HOWEVER, BLH ARE STILL AN ANGLER ACCEPTABLE SIZE.  FRD CATCH PER GILL NET WAS 6.3 FISH IN 1992.  THIS CATCH RATE IS AT THE HIGH END OF THE NORMAL RANGE FOR LAKE CLASS 43. THIS WAS THE FIRST YEAR DRUM WERE CAUGHT IN GEARS OTHER THAN A SHORELINE SEINE.  DRUM WERE FIRST SAMPLED IN EAST TOQUA IN 1987 WHEN TWO ADULTS WERE COLLECTED DURING SHORELINE SEINING.  ONE ADULT DRUM WAS SAMPLED IN 1/4' TRAP NETS IN LANNON LAKE, WHICH IS CONNECTED TO EAST TOQUA, IN 1991.  THE DRUM PRESENT IN THESE LAKES MOST LIKELY IMMIGRATED FROM THE MUSTINKA RIVER SYSTEM. ALTHOUGH THEY WERE NOT AGED, ALL FISH PRESENT APPEAR TO BE YOY OR YEARLINGS.  THE DRUM SHOULD PROVIDE ADDITIONAL FORAGE FOR PREDATOR FISH AND ULTIMATELY ANOTHER HARVESTABLE FISH FOR COMMERCIAL FISHERMEN.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>East Toqua is a large (446 acres), shallow (mean depth of 6 feet) lake located in the town of Graceville, MN.  Primary management species include walleye, northern pike, crappie, and yellow perch.  An aeration system has been operated on East Toqua since 1985.  However, dissolved oxygen concentrations have frequently fallen below 2 parts per million.  Recently, this has occurred during the winter of 2003-2004 and 2005-2006.  A new aeration system has since been installed, and its improved type and location will likely result in fewer winterkills.  This special assessment consisted of fall electrofishing for young-of-year (YOY) walleye.  No walleye fry were stocked into East Toqua in the spring of 2008, and electrofishing sampled no YOY walleye.  To supplement the game fish population, yellow perch (234 yearlings and 624 adults) and northern pike (651 finglerings and 413 adults) were stocked in 2008.  Ice-out netting is scheduled in the spring of 2009 to further evaluate the fish population in East Toqua. </p>",

It is managed primarily for Walleyes, with secondary emphasis on Northern Pike, Black Crappie and Yellow Perch.  The most recent assessment in 2017 indicated quality Walleye and Yellow Perch populations were present. <br> \n <br> \nEast Toqua is a shallow prairie lake that has a history of low winter oxygen.  Dissolved oxygen is routinely measured throughout the winter and the Toqua Sportsman's club operates an aeration system.  Near record amounts of snow fell in the area during the winter of 2018-2019.  By mid-February, dissolved oxygen was less than 1 ppm in most of the water column, indicating potential winterkill conditions.  At ice out, some dead gamefish were observed along shore.   <br> \n <br> \nIn spring, two trap nets and one gill net were set to check for the presence of gamefish.  Gamefish were abundant in the nets and various sizes of Walleye, Yellow Perch and Black Crappie were caught.  Though some dead fish were observed at ice-out, it did not appear winterkill had a large effect on game fish populations in East Toqua.      </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>East Toqua is a shallow, nutrient rich lake located in Big Stone County, adjacent to the City of Graceville in western Minnesota.  It is managed primarily for walleye, with secondary emphasis on northern pike, crappie and yellow perch.  Although the lake contains an aeration system, periodic winterkill occur.  Dissolved oxygen concentrations became low in portions of East Toqua Lake during the winter of 2001-2002.  Because areas of higher oxygen concentrations were also present, DNR Fisheries personnel do not believe a winterkill occurred.  However, an ice-out investigation will conducted to evaluate any possible kill.     Walleye were abundant in 2001.  Although the majority were less than 12 inches long, a good number of 18-22 inch walleye were also present.  Growth was fast, with walleye measuring 14-17 inches by age 3.  Approximately 214,000 walleye fry are stocked every two of three years, and all year classes have corresponded to fry stocked years.      Northern pike were moderately abundant in 2001.  Most pike were young-of-year and ranged from 7-10 inches, although several pike ranging from 22-27 inches were also sampled.  West Toqua and Lannon Lakes are important spawning areas for northern pike, particularily during springs with high water levels.          Yellow perch were moderately abundant, however, their gill net catch was the highest recorded on East Toqua Lake.  Most perch were less than 7 inches and do not currently offer much angling opportunity.  Very few young-of-year perch were sampled.  The high abundance of predators will likely limit the expansion of the yellow perch population over the next few years.       East Toqua was stocked with adult black and white crappie in the mid-1990's.  Since then, self-sustaining populations of each specie has developed.  Crappie were moderately abundant in 2001.  Although individuals up to 10 inches were caught, the vast majority measured less than 8 inches.  Very few young-of-year crappie were sampled.  As with perch, the expansion of the crappie population will likely be limited by predators.     Few bluegill were sampled in 2001.  Adult bluegill were stocked in 1989 and 1990, but a winterkill during the winter of 1992-1993 eliminated the population from East Toqua Lake.  The current population of bluegill is likely the result of migration from Twelve Mile Creek during flood conditions in 1997 and 2000.  All bluegill sampled ranged from 5.5-7.0 inches.  Although adequate spawning substrates for bluegill exist in East Toqua Lake, a lack of submerged vegetation for nursury habitat will likely hinder an expansion of the bluegill population.     A good number of black bullhead were present in 2001 and most were quality sized, measuring 8-11 inches.  Bigmouth buffalo, carp, freshwater drum, hybrid sunfish, orangespotted sunfish, white sucker and yellow bullhead were all caught in low to moderate numbers.     Fisheries management activities planned for East Toqua Lake include walleye fry stocking in 2002 and 2003, annual fall electrofishing to assess young-of-year walleye abundances, and a fish population assessment in 2004.     </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>East Toqua Lake borders Graceville in west-central Minnesota.  It is 428 acres and has a maximum depth of nine feet.  The lake is highly productive and water clarity is often low.  Toqua County Park is located along the south shoreline and it provides a boat launch, fishing pier, shore angling, picnicking and camping.  Toqua Lake is managed primarily for walleyes, with secondary emphasis on black crappies, northern pike and yellow perch.   <br> \n <br> \nAn extensive winterkill occurred during 2022-2023 which eliminated gamefish from the lake.  Adult walleyes, walleye fry and adult yellow perch were stocked in spring of 2023.  Black crappies will be stocked when they become available.  <br> \n <br> \nThis Targeted Survey used trap nets and seining to evaluate the stockings.  Results indicated good survival of stocked walleye fry and adults.  High numbers of naturally reproduced young-of-year yellow perch were also found.  Fish typically grow fast in East Toqua Lake and a good fishery is expected to result within two years.  Adequate numbers of adult walleyes were stocked to provide an immediate limited fishery.  Other fish caught included bigmouth buffalo, black bullheads, common carp, fathead minnows, northern pike, quillback and white suckers.   <br> \n</p>",
