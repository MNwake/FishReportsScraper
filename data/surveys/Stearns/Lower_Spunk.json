                "narrative": "<p>Lower Spunk Lake is a 280-acre lake located partly within the city limits of Avon in north central Stearns County. The lake is 27.5 feet deep and clear. The last survey was in 1987.\nPrincipal species sampled in gill nets were Northern Pike, Walleye, and Yellow Perch.  White Sucker, Common Carp, and Brown Bullhead were also sampled. The Northern Pike catch (9.4/gill net) and average weight (1.8 lb.) were within the expected range for lake class 38, but there was a significant decrease in the catch since the last survey.  Northern Pike from 15 to 25 inches, age 2 through 7, were sampled, and they showed average growth for a Minnesota lake.  The Walleye catch (1.2/gill net) was below the expected range, while average weight (3.0 lb.) was above the expected range.  Six Walleye were sampled, and ranged in length from 15 to 26.5 inches. Growth rates of Walleye were average, and Walleye were age 2, 4, and 8.  There has been no Walleye stocking in Lower Spunk in the last ten years, and the fish are assumed to be migrants from stocking in Upper and/ or Middle Spunk Lakes.  Yellow Perch catch experienced a significant increase from 0.2/gill net in 1987 to 19.6/gill net in 1992.  Numbers of perch, in 1992, were within expected values for lakes class 38, while average weight (0.1 lb.) was below the expected value.  Perch length ranged from 5 to 7 inches, and modal length was about six inches. Important species captured in trap nets were Black Crappie and Bluegill.  Pumpkinseed, hybrid sunfish and Green Sunfish, Bowfin, and Black and Yellow Bullhead were also sampled.  Black Crappie (1.3/trap net) were taken in numbers below expected values, but average weight (0.4 lb.) was above the expected value.  Crappies from 5 to 11 inches long were sampled; modal length was around 8 inches.  Bluegills (26.8/trap net) were sampled expected range of values, while average weight (0.1 lb.) was lower than expected.  Bluegills up to 8.4 inches long were sampled, and sixty-three percent of the fish were between 5.0 and 6.4 inches long.  All other sunfish were sampled in low numbers generally indicative of this lake class.  Thirteen Largemouth Bass were sampled with a shoreline seine.  Ten were young of the year, two were age 1, and one was age 3.  Growth rates were fast to age three.  Prey species sampled with the shoreline seine included: Spottail and Spotfin Shiner, Banded Killifish, Brook Silverside and Johnny Darter.  One Rock Bass was also sampled with the seine.\n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lower Spunk Lake is a 280-acre lake located partly within the city limits of Avon in north central Stearns County. The lake is 27.5 feet deep and clear. The last survey was in 1981.\nThe Northern Pike catch increased from 22.2/gill net in 1981 to 30.6/ gill net in 1987. Fish aged 1 to 6 were sampled with most being from the 1983-84 and 85 year classes. Contribution was 23% 40% and 28%, respectively, to the sample. Median length increased two inches to 19 inches since 1981 and growth rates remained good. Largemouth Bass abundance dropped below the expected range since 1981. Ages 0, 3, and 5 were sampled. Growth appears good and reproduction adequate. Of the centrarchids, Bluegill have tripled since 1981 and were abundant. Several year classes were sampled and the 1983 class represented 71% of the sample. Composite growth is slow at all ages. Since 1981, Green Sunfish abundance has risen from low to average; hybrid sunfish numbers remained average but have risen to near the upper limit of the expected range. Black Crappie numbers decreased from 2.3 to 0.4/ trap net from 1981 to 1987 to below the expected range. Yellow Perch abundance remained low but shoreline seining showed continuing natural reproduction. Forage minnow species were also captured in good numbers in seine hauls. White Sucker abundance remained good and unchanged since 1981. Other nongame fish present in low numbers include: Bowfin (dogfish), Common Carp, Black, Yellow and Brown Bullheads.\n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lower Spunk Lake is a 280-acre general development lake located partly within the city limits of Avon in north central Stearns County.  The lake is 27.5 feet deep and clear.  Cattails were found on over half of the lakeshore.  Curly leaf pondweed was found on 2.9 acres or 1.4% of the lake.  This was the first survey since 1998. <br> \n <br> \nNo walleye were sampled in 2008.  This was expected since the only stocking since 1953, took place in 2007, 170,000 fry by Avon Lakes Association, and was too recent for fish to be sampled by gill nets.  Catches for walleye were low in 1998 and 1992 as well. It is difficult to establish a walleye fishery in Lower Spunk Lake because of the large number of northern pike and lack of yellow perch.  Big and Middle Spunk Lakes, which are connected to Lower Spunk Lake, have been stocked with fingerlings every other year and had low catches of walleye (<2/lift). <br> \n <br> \nThe catch of northern pike, 14/gill net, has steadily increased since 1992 and is now above the normal range.  Average weight was the same as 1992 at 1.75 pounds.  All northern pike collected in 2008 ranged from 11 to 34 inches, and averaged 20 inches.  Seventeen percent of northern pike were greater than or equal to 24 inches.  Female northern pike grew to 24 inches in five to six years. <br> \n <br> \nFour yellow perch were collected in 2008: three in gill nets and one in trap nets.  The gill net catch rate, 0.6/net, was well below normal and much lower than the 1992 catch of 22/net.  Perch ranged from five to eight inches and averaged six inches. <br> \n  <br> \nElectrofishing was conducted for the first time on Lower Spunk Lake during the evening of June 4th.  A total of 31 largemouth bass was sampled in one hour of effort.  Largemouth bass from all gear averaged 11 inches and 0.7 pounds.  Anglers can expect to catch largemouth bass up to 16 inches.  Fish reached 12 inches in just over five years. <br> \n <br> \nCatches of bluegill have increased since 1992, but are still within expected range.  Bluegill ranged from three to eight inches and averaged six inches, which was reached in six years.  The average weight, 0.2 pounds, was also average for bluegill on similar lakes. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie were not abundant, but sizes were good.  Fish ranged from six to twelve inches and averaged eight inches.  Average fish weight was a third of a pound. <br> \n <br> \nNongame fish collected were white sucker; least and Iowa darter; central mudminnow; yellow bullhead; bluntnose minnow; blackchin and pugnose shiner; brook stickleback; bowfin; carp; green, hybrid and pumpkinseed sunfish; banded killifish; and rock bass.</p>",

The last survey was in 1975.\n\nNorthern Pike were sampled at a rate that was two times the expected range and double the rate observed in 1975.  There were five age classes present in the sample.  Yellow perch were sampled below the expected range in gill nets but natural reproduction appeared adequate based on result from shoreline seining. No Walleye were sampled in this survey.  A single Cisco (tullibee) was sampled in the gill nets which likely migrated from adjacent Middle Spunk Lake where they are much more abundant. Largemouth Bass were sampled in average numbers by trap nets.  Four age classes of bass were sampled and growth rates were considered average.  Bluegill increased from the previous survey but remained within the expected range of similar lakes. Black Crappie decreased from the previous survey but remained with the expected range.\n\nOther species sampled in the survey at or below normal abundance included: Black Bullhead, Bowfin (dogfish) Brown Bullhead, Common Carp, Green Sunfish, Hybrid Sunfish, Pumpkinseed, White Sucker, and Yellow Bullhead.\n\n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lower Spunk Lake is a 280-acre general development lake located partly within the city limits of Avon in north central Stearns County. There is a public access located on the south side of the lake. The water quality of Lower Spunk Lake is generally very good with a 10 year average Secchi reading of 9.8 feet and adequate dissolved oxygen was present to a depth of 16 feet during the third week of June. The lake has a relatively large watershed (19,288 acres) that is primarily forested and agricultural. A standard lake survey was conducted in 2016 to monitor changes in the fishery from the last survey completed in 2008. In addition to the standard lake survey, an Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) survey was conducted in August. Results of this survey will be summarized in a separate report. <br> \n <br> \nLower Spunk is primarily managed for Northern Pike and Bluegill. There is no Walleye stocking due to the high Northern Pike population and lack of forage such as Yellow Perch. However, the Avon Lakes Association has stocked Walleye in the past (most recently in 2007). <br> \n <br> \nAs expected, there was a low catch of Walleye and only three were captured during the survey. These fish ranged in length from 16 to 18 inches with a mean length of 17 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nThe catch of Northern Pike was similar to previous surveys and within the range of what we would expect to see for the lake class. Northern Pike ranged in length from 13 to 30 inches with a mean length of 20 inches. Eighteen percent of the pike were longer than 24 inches. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers are encouraged to harvest the smaller Northern Pike under 22 inches and release the larger ones to help achieve a more balanced fish community and promote good growth rates. Lower pike numbers may also increase Yellow Perch survival and allow their numbers, which continue to be low, to increase. Higher perch populations are desirable as they can be important prey species for Northern Pike. <br> \n <br> \nNo Yellow Perch were captured in gill nets or trap nets in the 2016 survey and was similar to previous surveys. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass were sampled by night electrofishing in June and 38 bass were collected at a rate of 19.6/hour. Largemouth Bass ranged from 6 to 18 inches, and averaged 13 inches. <br> \n <br> \nThe catch of Bluegill was similar to the long-term average and fish ranged in length from 3 to 9 inches with an average length of 6 inches. Hybrid sunfish were also sampled and although low in abundance, fish up to 9 inches were captured. Anglers can expect good Bluegill fishing with some larger individuals mixed in. <br> \n <br> \nSimilar to previous surveys, Black Crappies were hard to find in Lower spunk and anglers can expect to do some searching for them. Black Crappie ranged in length from 5 to 11 inches with a mean length of 8 inches. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled during the 2016 survey included: Black Bullhead, Bowfin, Green Sunfish, Hybrid Sunfish, Pumpkinseed, White Sucker and Yellow Bullhead. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lower Spunk Lake is a 280-acre lake located partly within the city limits of Avon in north central Stearns County. There is a public access located on the south side of the lake with room for eight vehicle/trailers. The water quality of Lower Spunk Lake is generally very good with a 10-year average Secchi reading of 10 feet although adequate dissolved oxygen was only present to a depth of 14 feet during the second week of June. The lake has a large watershed (19,288 acres) that is primarily made up of forest and agriculture. The lake is managed for Largemouth Bass and Northern Pike. No Walleye stocking takes place due to the high pike numbers as well as the lack of Yellow Perch as forage. However, the Avon Lakes Association has stocked Walleye in the past (most recently in 2007). A standard lake survey was conducted in 2023 to monitor changes in the fishery from the last survey completed in 2016.  <br> \n <br> \nAs expected, there was a low catch of Walleye and only two were captured during the survey. These fish ranged in length from 17 to 25 inches. <br> \n <br> \nThe catch of Northern Pike was higher than previous surveys and exceeded the range of what we would expect to see for the lake class. Northern Pike ranged in length from nine to 33 inches with an average length of 21 inches. Eighteen percent of the pike sampled were longer than 26 inches and 6% were longer than 30 inches. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers are encouraged to harvest the smaller Northern Pike (under 22 inches) and release the larger ones to help achieve a more balanced fish community and to help increase growth rates. Lower pike numbers may also increase Yellow Perch survival and allow their numbers, which continue to be low, to increase. Higher perch populations are desirable as they can be important prey species for Northern Pike. Unfortunately, only one Yellow Perch was sampled during the survey which was similar to the past three surveys. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass were sampled by daytime electrofishing in May. Forty-eight bass were collected in 1.4 hrs of on-time for a catch rate of 34/hour. This was below the average daytime catch rate (52/hour) for Sauk Rapids area lakes but above the rate observed in 2016 (20/hour). Largemouth Bass ranged from six to 20 inches and averaged 12 inches. <br> \n <br> \nThe catch of Bluegill was similar to the long-term average and fish sampled ranged in length from three  to nine inches with an average length of six inches. Hybrid sunfish were also sampled and although low in abundance, fish up to eight  inches were captured. Anglers can expect good Bluegill fishing with some larger individuals mixed in. <br> \n <br> \nLike previous surveys, Black Crappies were hard to find in Lower Spunk Lake and anglers can expect to do some searching for them. Black Crappie ranged in length from five to 11 inches with a mean length of nine inches. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled during the 2023 survey included: Black Bullhead, Bowfin, Green Sunfish, Hybrid Sunfish, Pumpkinseed, White Sucker and Yellow Bullhead. <br> \n</p>",

Northern pike abundance was above the expected range, yellowperch abundance was below the expected  values, while black crappie and walleye abundancewere slightly lower than the expected values for lakes similar to Lower Spunk Lake.The gill net catch rate for northern pike (8.80/lift) was similar to that of 1992 (9.4/lift), thoughmean weight per fish decreased from 1.75 lbs. to 1.43 lbs. Northern pike sampled in 1998 rangedin length from 13.0 to 24.0 inches, with a mean length of 18.7 inches.  Northern pike growth wasabove average compared to other Minnesota lakes as Age II, and III, individuals reached 16.2,and 18.5 inches, respectively. The gill net catch rate for walleye has remained similar from 1.20/lift in 1992 to 1.80/lift in 1998;however, mean weight per fish decreased from 3.01 lbs. to 2.44 lbs., respectively. Walleyesampled ranged in length from 14.0 to 27.0 inches with a mean length of 18.9 inches.  Growthwas slightly better than other Minnesota lakes as individuals reached 14.09, 18.50, and 26.38inches by Age III, V, and VII, respectively.  The gill net catch rate for yellow perch has significantly decreased from 19.60/net in 1992 to0.20/lift in 1998.  The gill net catch rate for black crappie has remained similar with 2.20/lift in 1992 and 2.80/lift in1998.  Black crappie sampled in 1998 ranged in length from 5.5 to 11.5 inches with a meanlength of 7.4 inches.  Growth of black crappie was above average for Ages II, V and VI asindividuals reached 5.91, 9.92, and 10.79  inches, respectively, but average for Age III, IV andVII fish.   Relative abundance estimates of fish from trap nets in 1998 consisted of three sought after fishspecies: bluegill (37.38/set), pumpkinseed sunfish (6.25/set), and hybrid sunfish (4.38/set); and sixother species which were caught in first or second quartile ranges.  Bluegill abundance was abovethe normal range for similar lakes, while pumpkinseed sunfish abundance was slightly below thehigh expected value. The trap net catch for bluegill has appeared to increase from 26.75/set in 1992 to 37.38/set in1998; however, mean weight per fish decreased from 0.12 lbs. to 0.04 lbs., respectively.  Bluegillsampled in 1998 ranged in length from 3.0 to 7.5 inches, with a mean length of 4.4 inches. Growth was slightly below average for Age III and  IV individuals with  4.25, and 5.31 inches,respectively, and average for Age II fish.  Relatively high abundance of the 1994 and 1995 yearclasses was observed in the 1998 sample.  The trap net catch for pumpkinseed sunfish has significantly  increased from 1.13/set in 1992 to6.25/set in 1998; however, mean weight per fish decreased from 0.11 lbs. in 1992 to 0.07 lbs. in1998.  Fish sampled in 1998 ranged in length from 3.0 to 6.5 inches, with a mean length of 4.4inches.  The trap net catch for hybrid sunfish has appeared to increase from 2.50/set in 1992 to4.38/set in 1998.  Fish sampled in 1998 ranged in length from 3.0 to 8.0 inches, with a meanlength of 5.2 inches.  </p>",

Sampling stations were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at all 10 stations with four sites sampled from the boat. A 50-foot seine was used to sample five stations and conditions prevented the use of seines at five sampling sites. Nearshore sampling captured 18 native species of fish including several species that are intolerant of habitat disturbance (Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Iowa Darter, and Pugnose Shiner). <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey is combined with data from a standard game fish survey completed in June 2016 to calculate a Fish-based Index of Biologic Integrity (FIBI) that describes the overall health of lake. The FIBI score for Lower Spunk Lake based on this survey is above the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes and indicates a healthy fish community. Data from this survey will be included as part of a process to assess the condition of surface waters of the Mississippi River - Sartell watershed. <br> \n</p>",
