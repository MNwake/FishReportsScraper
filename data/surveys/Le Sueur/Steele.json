                "narrative": "<p>Introduction <br> \nSteele Lake is a 75 acre lake located in Le Sueur County north of the town of Elysian. A county operated public access is located on the south side of the lake at the end of Steele Lake Lane. Steele Lake is a small, mostly undeveloped lake with a maximum depth of 27 feet. Based on limnological variables and lake characteristics, Steele Lake is placed in Lake Class 30. Other area lakes with this classification include George Lake (Blue Earth County), Sunfish Lake (Le Sueur County), and Roemhildts Lake (Le Sueur County). Steele Lake is managed primarily for bluegill and northern pike and secondarily for largemouth bass and black crappie. After a winterkill event in the winter of 2014, adult fish stocking took place to initialize the fish community. Fish species that were stocked in 2014 included northern pike (432 adult fish), bluegill (175 adult fish), and black crappie (50 adult fish). A post-winterkill assessment is scheduled for spring of 2015 to determine how the fish community responded from stocking and if more fish potentially need to be stocked. Steele Lake was surveyed the week of June 23, 2014 as part of a regular monitoring program conducted by Minnesota DNR. This survey was intended to assess the fish community after a winterkill event by deploying two gill nets and eight trap nets, as well as recording water quality parameters. <br> \n <br> \nFish Community <br> \nTypical of post-winterkill lakes, black bullhead and common carp dominated the survey. Black bullhead were sampled at a rate of 8.8 fish/net, which is low abundance for Lake Class 30. Lengths ranged from 4.4 to 6.7 inches and averaged only 5.9 inches, indicating that larger individuals were likely victims of winterkill. Common carp have historically been in low abundance in Steele Lake. The 2014 catch rate of 6.3 fish/net was the highest abundance in recent history. Nearly all common carp were small individuals, with 90% measuring less than 8.0 inches. The only other fish species observed in this survey in low abundance was golden shiners (N = 6). Steele Lake showed typical signs of a severe winterkill. As stated above, northern pike, black crappie, and bluegill were stocked following this survey to initiate the fish community. A post winterkill assessment will be conducted during spring of 2015 to determine if additional stocking is necessary.   <br> \n <br> \nAnglers can play an important role in maintaining or improving a fish population by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for consumption, while encouraging the release of medium to large fish that may contribute to natural recruitment.  This practice helps maintain balance in the fish community and provides anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future.  Additionally, smaller fish often taste better and have fewer contaminants than larger, older fish from the same water body. <br> \n <br> \nShoreline property owners also play an important role in the overall health of an aquatic ecosystem, including the fish population.  Natural shorelines, including vegetation, woody debris, and bottom substrates, provide valuable habitat for fish and wildlife, help maintain water quality, and reduce bank erosion.  By leaving natural shorelines unaltered or restoring them to natural conditions, shoreline property owners are doing their part to maintain or improve a healthy ecosystem in the lake and protect the resource for future generations. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Steele Lake in Le Sueur County is a 70 acre lake located north of the city of Elysian. A public access is located on the south end of the lake, at the end of Steele Lake Lane. Turn off of 211th Avenue/Le Sueur County Road 11 to reach the public access. <br> \n <br> \nSteele Lake was surveyed the week of June 22nd, 2009 to monitor the fish community. Steele Lake is a bass-panfish managed lake with little shoreline development and stands of emergent bulrush and cattail. Small bluegill dominated trap net catches, with over 87 fish per lift, exceeding the upper quartile for lakes of Steele's classification (Class 30). Average size was small, at less than five to a pound and 6.3 inches. Nine percent of bluegill were larger than 7 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappies were abundant in trap and gill net catches, at 40 per lift and 21 per lift respectively. Average size for all nets was small, at 7.2 inches. Four individuals, representing one percent of the sampled fish, were larger than 12 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nWhite crappies are also strongly abundant in Steele, averaging 3 per gill net lift and 22 per trap net lift. Average size was 7.9 inches. Twelve percent of trap netted individuals were between 12 and 14 inches, so a few large individuals are present. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike abundance (0.5 pike per gill net) has declined steeply since the 2001 survey (8 pike per gill net). Pike abundance should increase with available perch and small bluegill. Adequate spawning habitat is available within Steele Lake and in ditches connecting Steele to Sasse Lake to the north. Other fish observed in the survey include yellow perch, yellow bullhead, pumpkinseed sunfish, largemouth bass, hybrid sunfish, common carp, and black bullhead. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers can help maintain or improve the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest. Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for table fare, but encourages release of medium- to large-sized fish. Releasing these fish can help maintain balance in the fish community in Steele Lake and provide anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future.  <br> \n <br> \nShoreline areas on the land and into the shallow water provide essential habitat for fish and wildlife that live in or near Minnesota's lakes. Overdeveloped shorelines cannot support the fish, wildlife, and clean water that are associated with natural undeveloped lakes. Shoreline habitat consists of aquatic plants, woody plants, and natural lake bottom soils. <br> \n <br> \nPlants in the water and at the water's edge provide habitat, prevent erosion, and absorb excess nutrients. Shrubs, trees, and woody debris such as fallen trees or limbs provide good habitat both above and below the water and should be left in place. By leaving a buffer strip of natural vegetation along the shoreline, property owners can reduce erosion, help maintain water quality, and provide habitat and travel corridors for wildlife.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Status of the Fishery <br> \n <br> \nSteele Lake is a 70-acre lake located approximately 3 miles north of the town of Elysian in Le Sueur County. Steele Lake has a max depth of 27 feet with approximately 75% of the lake less than 15 feet deep. Most of the shoreline is undeveloped with a cattail fringe. Water quality is generally poor with frequent algal blooms due to elevated nutrient levels. A county-owned public access is located on the south side of the lake off County Highway 11. Steele Lake is primarily managed for Bluegill and Northern Pike and secondarily for Black Crappie and Largemouth Bass. All four species are stocked as needed following reclamation or winterkill events. The last recorded winterkill was in 2014 and 432 adult Northern Pike, 175 adult Bluegill, and 50 adult Black Crappie were stocked as a result. Additionally, adult Bluegill, Black Crappie, Northern Pike, and Largemouth Bass were stocked in 2015. Steele Lake is designated as a Tier-2 Lake and will be surveyed as part of a regularly scheduled monitoring program every 6 years.  <br> \n <br> \nThe 2019 standard survey was completed the week of June 17, 2020 using 2 gill nets, 6 trap nets, and 81 minutes of standard daytime boat electrofishing. A standard survey is used for sampling a wide range of fish species during the summer months using standard methods (i.e. standard time of year, set sampling stations, taking water clarity readings and oxygen/temperature profiles, etc.) and gears (i.e. lake survey gillnets, trap nets, and spring electrofishing for Largemouth Bass). <br> \n <br> \nA total of 170 Black Crappie were sampled with trap nets for a catch rate of 28.3/net, indicating high numbers were present. After catching zero in the 2014 survey following the winterkill, the Black Crappie population has rebounded to the second highest catch rate since 1993. Lengths ranged from 3.8 to 10.0 inches with a mean of 5.7 inches. Size structure was poor with only 2 fish larger than 10 inches. An additional 38 fish ranging from 4.1 to 6.4 inches were sampled with gill nets for a catch rate of 19.0/net. Black Crappie from both gears ranged from 1 to 3 years old with 3 year classes present. Each year class was well represented. Growth was moderate with fish exceeding 6 inches at year 2. The population appeared to still be recovering with few fish large enough for anglers to harvest. <br> \n <br> \nBluegills were extremely abundant in trap nets with a catch rate of 113.0/net. High catch rates have been common since 1993 with an average catch rate of 71.4/net during that time. Lengths in 2019 ranged from 3.6 to 6.6 inches with an average of just 4.7 inches. Size structure was poor with few quality fish available. Ages ranged from 2 to 6 years old with 5 year classes present. Growth was slow with fish growing on average 1 inch a year. The Bluegill population has recovered in numbers only with very slow growth limiting its potential to angling. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass were common in 2019. A total of 78 Largemouth Bass were sampled with standard daytime boat electrofishing for a catch rate of 57.3/hour. This was the first standard boat electrofishing sample conducted in Steele Lake. Largemouth Bass lengths ranged from 3.1 to 18.7 inches with a mean of 15.2 inches. Sizes structure was good with many fish over 15 inches. Three more Largemouth bass, averaging 16.4 inches long, were sampled with trap nets. Ages from both gears ranged from 1 to 8 years old with 5 year classes present. Most of the sample was from 2015. Growth was fast with quality length of 15 inches exceeded by year 4. The Steele Lake Largemouth Bass population offered an excellent fishing opportunity in 2019 and should continue in the absence of winterkill events. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike were also common in 2019 with a total of 25 sampled with the gill nets for a catch rate of 12.5/net. Since 1993, catch rates have varied from 0.0/net to 15.0/net with an average of 6.0/net. Lengths in 2019 ranged from 24.1 to 36.0 inches with an average of 28.1 inches. This indicated good size structure with the entire sample larger than the legal minimum length limit of 24 inches. An additional 10 fish ranging from 21.0 to 30.3 inches were sampled with the trap nets. Fish from both gears ranged from 3 to 7 years old with 5 year classes present. Approximately 74% were either 4 or 5 years old. Growth was fast with quality length of 21 inches exceeded by year 2. <br> \n <br> \nSteele Lake is located in the Southern Northern Pike management zone. In order to harvest a Northern Pike the fish must be over 24.0 inches in length.  The daily bag limit in this zone is 2 Northern Pike per day. <br> \nBlack Bullheads were common in the 2019 survey which is typical of lakes with a recent history of winterkill. A total of 237 Black Bullheads were sampled with gill nets for a catch rate of 118.5/net. Most were small with an average length of just 5.4 inches. Since 1993, catch rates have been extremely variable with a range of 0.5/net to 210.5/net and an average of 81.4/net. Black Bullheads will continue to dominate the fish community as long as periodic winterkill events occur in Steele Lake. <br> \n <br> \nCommon Carp were successful in migrating back into Steele Lake after the 2014 winterkill event as indicated by high trap net catch rate in the 2014 survey. However, only 9 were sampled in 2019. Lengths ranged from 15.5 to 18.0 inches. The low catch rate and absence of smaller fish in the sample indicate the population has not expanded to problematic numbers in Steele Lake. The high catch rates of piscivores and egg-eating Bluegills should continue to suppress the Common Carp population.  <br> \n <br> \nOther Species sampled in 2019 include Golden Shiner, Pumpkinseed, and hybrid sunfish (Lepomis spp.). <br> \n <br> \nWater clarity was poor with a secchi depth of just 2.0 feet. Dissolved oxygen and water temperature readings ranged from 13.2 ppm and 72.9 degrees Fahrenheit at the surface to 0.0 ppm and 55.6 degrees Fahrenheit at 23 feet. A thermocline was detected between 11 and 14 feet. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers can play an important role in maintaining or improving a fish population by practicing selective harvest. Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for consumption, while encouraging the release of medium to large fish that may contribute to natural reproduction. This practice helps maintain balance in the fish populations and provides anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future. Additionally, smaller fish often taste better and have fewer contaminants than larger, older fish from the same water body. <br> \n <br> \nShoreline property owners also play an important role in the overall health of an aquatic ecosystem, including the fish population. Natural shorelines, including vegetation, woody debris, and bottom substrates, provide valuable habitat for fish and wildlife, help maintain water quality, and reduce bank erosion. Cattails and bulrushes are particularly beneficial for fish spawning, rearing, and feeding. By leaving natural shorelines unaltered or restoring them to natural conditions, shoreline property owners are doing their part to maintain or improve a healthy ecosystem in the lake and protect the resource for future generations. <br> \n <br> \n- Sky Wigen, fisheries specialist <br> \n</p>",

In 1997, low oxygen levels resulted in winterkill conditions that reduced sunfish, bass, and crappie populations.  Adult bluegill, black crappie, and largemouth bass stocked after the winterkill have re-established populations of these species.  Bluegill are abundant, however, no bluegill over 7 inches were caught in the 2001 survey.  Northern pike catch per gill net was good at 8 per net.  Northern pike caught ranged from 19 to 31 inches with a mean length of 23 inches.  Other species present included black crappie, yellow perch, and largemouth bass.  </p>",
