Sizes ranged from 6.8 inches to 23.8 inches with most walleyes measuring around 13.0 inches.  The yellow perch population is also excellent both in number and size.  Average length was 8.4 inches with several of the larger individuals over a pound.     Northern pike numbers have increased somewhat, however, average length is only 19.6 inches.  A few larger individuals, over 32.0 inches, are present.  A few black crappie, rock bass and pumpkinseed are also avialable for the angler.</p>",

There is a Minnesota Power back-in concrete ramp located just west of the dam off of County Road 247.  Wild Rice is operated as a water storage reservoir by Minnesota Power and is subject to water level manipulation.  Wild Rice was surveyed during the summer of 2009 to update information about fish populations.   <br> \n <br> \nWalleye have not been stocked into Wild Rice since 1983 because sufficient natural reproduction has been documented to sustain the walleye fishery.  Walleye abundance of 17.5 per gillnet lift was up from 2004 (9.4) and was above average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Walleye mean length was 16.1 inches and growth was average when compared to other Duluth Area lakes.  Fifty-one percent of the walleyes sampled were over 15 inches in length.  All year-classes from 1993 to 2008 were represented except 1995.  One large walleye sampled was from the 1991 year-class.  Sixty-one percent of the walleye catch was from 2005-2006 year-classes. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike abundance of 7.3 per lift was down from 2004 (9.5) and was above average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Mean length of northern pike was 23.4 inches and growth was fast when compared to other Duluth Area lakes.  All year-classes from 1999 to 2008 were represented. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie abundance of 5.0 per lift was up from 2004 (1.8) and was above average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Black crappie mean length was 10.1 inches and growth was fast when compared to other Duluth Area crappie populations.  All year-classes from 2002 to 2006 were represented. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch abundance of 3.5 was less than 2004 (10.0) and below average when compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Mean length of perch was 6.8 inches and growth was average when compared to other Duluth Area lakes.  All year-classes from 2001 to 2007 were represented in the sample, except 2002. <br> \n <br> \nYoung-of-the-year (YOY) seining captured zero YOY walleye.  A total of 14 YOY yellow perch and 50 YOY black crappies were captured during seining.   <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species sampled included pumpkinseed sunfish, rock bass, Johnny darter, spottail shiner, golden shiner and white sucker.    <br> \n <br> \nResults of laboratory water analysis indicate Wild Rice is a slightly alkaline, slightly hard water lake with moderate fertility.    <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Wild Rice Reservoir is a 2,127 acre lake located near Duluth, Minnesota with 100% littoral area and a maximum depth of 11 feet.  There is a Minnesota Power back-in concrete ramp located just west of the dam off of County Road 247.  According to the 2001 management plan, walleye are the primary management fish species.  Walleyes have not been stocked since 1983 due to evidence of good natural reproduction.     Although walleye abundance decreased 49% since the investigation in 2000, a walleye abundance of 9.4 fish/gillnet in 2004 was average compared to Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Walleye mean length was 14.8 inches with a maximum length of 24.9 inches.  Growth was average for Duluth Area lakes and age analysis revealed consistent recruitment between 1991 and 2003.     Yellow perch abundance was 10.0 fish/gillnet and was average for Minnesota lakes, but represented a decrease of 54% from 2000.  The mean length of yellow perch was 7.4 inches.  Age analysis revealed consistent recruitment and fast growth when compared to other Duluth Area populations.     Northern pike abundance was above average for Minnesota lakes and was the highest recorded for Wild Rice Reservoir with a catch of 9.5 fish/gillnet.  Mean length was 21.1 inches, with  51% of northern pike 21 inches or larger, and one fish measuring 40.0 inches.  Age analysis revealed good recruitment and fast growth.     The black crappie abundance of 1.8 fish/trapnet was average for Minnesota lakes of similar type.  The mean length of black crappie was 9.3 inches.  Crappie growth was fast compared to other Duluth Area populations, but recruitment was erratic between 1997 and 2003.       Bluegill abundance was below average for Minnesota lakes at 0.7 fish/trapnet.  The mean length was 4.5 inches and maximum length was 5.5 inches.  The investigation in 2004 was only the second time bluegills were documented in Wild Rice Reservoir.  These fish were born in 2001 and 2002.     Other fish species sampled included; pumpkinseed, rock bass, and white sucker.     Walleye catch rates in Wild Rice Reservoir have dropped gradually from the historic high of 40.3 fish/gillnet in 1977 to a historic low of 9.4 fish/gillnet in 2004.  However, walleye catch rates remained average when compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Several factors may be responsible for the decreased walleye abundance in 2004.  Northern pike density has increased considerably in recent years and may be influencing the success of walleye recruitment.  In addition, changes in the macrophyte community may also be influencing walleye reproductive potential.        </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Wild Rice Reservoir is a 2,127 acre reservoir located near Duluth, MN with 100% littoral area and a maximum depth of 11 feet.  There is a Minnesota Power back-in concrete ramp located just west of the dam off of County Road 247 that is open to public use.  Wild Rice is operated as a water storage reservoir by Minnesota Power and is subject to water level manipulation.  Wild Rice was last surveyed in 2009.  Wild Rice was assessed during the summer of 2014 to update information about fish populations.   <br> \n <br> \nWalleye have not been stocked into Wild Rice since 1983 because sufficient natural reproduction has been documented to sustain the walleye fishery.  Walleye abundance of 14.1 per gillnet lift was down from 2009 (17.5) but still above average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Walleye mean length was 16.0 inches and growth was average when compared to other Duluth Area lakes.  Recruitment is relatively consistent with only five missing year-classes over 20 years from 1994 through 2013.  Sixty-seven percent of the Walleye catch was from 2009-2010 year-classes. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike abundance of 9.5 per lift was up from 2009 (7.3) and was above average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Mean length of Northern Pike was 22.9 inches and growth was fast when compared to other Duluth Area lakes.  Recruitment was consistent with all year-classes represented from 2008 through 2013.  A few large individuals were aged to either the 2003 or 2006 year-class.  The 2011 year-class was strong, contributing to 50% of the overall catch.   <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch abundance of 38.6 was up substantially from 2009 (3.5) and above average when compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Historically, Yellow Perch gillnet abundance has been highly variable in Wild Rice ranging from 3.5 to 40.3 per lift.  Average length of Yellow Perch was 7.3 inches and growth was fast when compared to other Duluth Area lakes.  All year-classes from 2005 to 2012 were represented. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie abundance of 6.3 per lift was up from 2009 (5.0) and was above average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  The 2014 trapnet catch of 6.3 per lift represents a historic high for Wild Rice.  Black Crappie mean length was 9.0 inches and growth was fast when compared to other Duluth Area populations.  All year-classes from 2005 to 2012 were represented. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill abundance of 25.1 per lift was up substantially from 2009 (11.1) and was above average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Bluegill were first encountered in Wild Rice by DNR Fisheries in 1988.  Since then, Bluegill trapnet abundance has dramatically increased over the last several investigations.  Average length was 6.3 inches and over 15% of the catch exceeded 8 inches.     <br> \n <br> \nNo prior Largemouth Bass electrofishing assessments had been conducted on Wild Rice, and the species had never been sampled by DNR Fisheries in any investigation dating back to 1942.  However, Fond du Lac Resource Management sampled one juvenile Largemouth Bass during an annual young-of-the-year walleye assessment in 2009 and anecdotal reports from anglers indicate that a fishable population is emerging.  As a result, a spring electrofishing assessment targeting Largemouth Bass was conducted in 2014.  Six Largemouth Bass with a mean length of 12.5 inches were sampled.  The catch rate of Largemouth Bass was 3.2 fish per hour of electrofishing on-time.  Not enough individuals were captured to evaluate stock density or growth, but recruitment appears sporadic with only two year-classes represented. <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species sampled included Hybrid and Pumpkinseed Sunfish, Rock Bass, Golden Shiner and White Sucker.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Wild Rice Reservoir is a 2,127 acre waterbody located near Duluth, MN with 100% littoral area and a maximum depth of 11 feet.  There is a Minnesota Power back-in concrete ramp located just west of the dam off of County Road 247 that is open to public use.  Wild Rice is operated as a water storage reservoir by Minnesota Power and is subject to water level manipulation.  Wild Rice was last surveyed in 2014.  Wild Rice was surveyed during the summer of 2019 to update information about fish populations.   <br> \n <br> \nThe Walleye population in Wild Rice is self-sustaining and has not been stocked since 1983.  Walleye abundance of 15.4 per gillnet lift was above average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Walleye mean length was 15.6 inches and growth was average when compared to other Duluth Area lakes.  Walleye angling in Wild Rice is expected to be excellent in 2020 and beyond with high abundance, good population size structure and consistent natural reproduction.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike abundance of 6.7 per gillnet lift was above average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Mean length of Northern Pike was 20.7 inches and growth was fast when compared to other Duluth Area lakes.  A large specimen measuring 37.2 inches was caught and released in the trapnets. <br> \n <br> \nPanfish populations in Wild Rice are currently in excellent shape.  Yellow Perch abundance of 29.4 per gillnet lift was above average when compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Historically, Yellow Perch gillnet abundance has been highly variable in Wild Rice ranging from 3.5 to 40.3 per lift.  Average length of Yellow Perch was 8.1 inches and growth was fast when compared to other Duluth Area lakes.  Angling for Yellow Perch should be very good in the coming years with approximately 1/3 of the overall sample currently exceeding 10 inches in length and several strong young year-classes evident. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie abundance of 3.9 per lift was above average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Black Crappie mean length was impressive at 11.0 inches and growth was average when compared to other Duluth Area populations.   <br> \n <br> \nBluegill abundance of 10.8 per lift was above average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Bluegill were first encountered in Wild Rice by DNR Fisheries in 1988 and have since become well established.  Average length was 7.1 inches but several large specimens over 9 inches in length were captured.</p>",
