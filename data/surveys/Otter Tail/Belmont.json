Other area lakes included in this class are: Anderson, Jim, and Tonseth. <br> \n     Northern pike abundance declined from 21.5 per gill net lift in the 1979 survey to 7.3 per net, which is within the normal range for this lake class.  Average weight of pike decreased from 1.6 pounds in 1979 to 0.9 pounds.  Consistent recruitment is apparent as the sample was composed of seven consecutive year classes.  Northern pike growth rates are below the statewide average.   <br> \n     Yellow bullhead abundance remained unchanged at 38.5 per gill net lift, which is over six times greater than the upper limit of the normal range.   <br> \n     Bluegill abundance increased from 94.7 per trap net lift in 1979 to 133.2 per net, which is well above the normal range.  Bluegill size structure remained of poor quality as all bluegill measured were less than seven inches in length.  <br> \n     Largemouth bass recruitment appears to be consistent, as six consecutive year classes were present in the sample.   <br> \n     Black crappie abundance remained relatively unchanged at 2.5 per trap net lift, which bordered the low end of the normal range.  Black crappie recruitment also appears consistent, as three consecutive year classes were present in the sample.  The 1988 and 1987 year classes of black crappies appear to be strong as together they composed 92% of the sample. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Belmont Lake is located in south-central Otter Tail County approximately five miles south of Clitherall, MN.  Belmont Lake is a 192-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake that is part of the Otter Tail River Watershed.  The immediate watershed is composed primarily of mixed hardwood forest cover interspersed with homes and cabins on the north and south lakeshores.  The maximum depth of Belmont Lake is 34 feet; however, 56% of the lake is less than 15 feet in depth.  The secchi disk reading during the 2001 lake survey was 11.8 feet, which indicates excellent water clarity.  Periodic plankton/algae blooms throughout the summer months can influence secchi disk readings.  Belmont Lake is included in lake class 33 of the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources' (DNR) lake classification scheme.  Belmont Lake is located within the DNR's Fergus Falls Management Area.     The majority of the shoreline of Belmont Lake is undeveloped.  The 1991 resurvey identified 23 homes/cottages on the lake.  There is no designated public access on the lake but access may be gained to the lake for a fee at various locations.  The shoal water substrates consist of sand, gravel, and rubble.  The substrate in the bay areas is predominately muck.  Several stands of hardstem bulrush are scattered along various shorelines of the lakes.  Common cattail is prevalent in three of the bays.  Emergent aquatic plants such as bulrush and cattail provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat, and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms, and can actually absorb and break down polluting chemicals.  They also serve as important nursery areas for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit.  To maintain the excellent water quality and angling within this lake it is imperative to preserve the quality of the aquatic habitat.     Belmont Lake can be ecologically classified as a bass-panfish type of lake and this is reflected in the assemblage of the fish community.  Northern pike, largemouth bass, bluegill, and black crappie are the dominant gamefish species in the lake.  The prolificacy of these species can be attributed to the abundance of suitable spawning habitat that is available.     A high-density northern pike population exists.  The catch rate has exceeded the upper limit of the normal range for lake class 33 in all fish surveys to date.  Age data indicate that pike natural reproduction is consistently good.  Northern pike ranged in size from 12.6 to 30.5 inches with an average length and weight of 18.4 inches and 1.4 pounds.  Pike reach an average length of 17.3 inches at five years of age.  Growth rate estimates are slower than average pike growth rates for class 33 lakes in the Fergus Falls Management Area.  The slow growth rate of pike may be attributed to their high recruitment rates and low abundance of yellow perch, a preferred forage fish.     The bluegill test-net catch rate was lower than the two previous lake surveys but was still above the normal range for class 33 lakes.  Recruitment appears to be consistent with strong year classes produced from 1992 through 1994.  Twenty percent of the bluegills in the trap net sample were 7.0 inches or greater in length; however, very few fish in the sample exceeded 8.0 inches in length.  Bluegills attain a mean length of 5.2 inches at eight years of age, which is below the statewide normal range of growth for class 33 lakes.     The largemouth bass population cannot be fully analyzed from this survey since a spring electrofishing sample was not completed.  Bass are less susceptible to capture with gill nets or trap nets so numbers in the sample were limited.  Based on the fish sampled, the population appears to be within the normal range for lake class 33.  Largemouth bass ranged in length from 8.0 to 18.0 inches.  Growth rate estimates for bass are within the normal range for class 33 lakes.     Catch data from a spring trapnetting assessment indicated that black crappie are abundant in Belmont Lake.  Crappies ranged in length from 5.0 to 13.3 inches with and average length of 7.7 inches and 0.3 pounds.  Thirty-eight percent of the crappies were 9.0 inches or greater in length.  Age data indicate that black crappie recruitment is consistent with strong year classes produced in 1995, 1996 and 1997.  Black crappie growth rate estimates are similar to mean crappie growth rates for class 33 lakes in the Fergus Falls Management Area with a mean length of 8.9 inches at five years of age.     Anglers can maintain the quality of fishing in Belmont Lake by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large-size fish while allowing the harvest of the more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future.</p>",
