                "narrative": "<p>Waboose Lake is located seven miles north of Nevis in Hubbard County.  Waboose has a surface area of 172 acres and a maximum depth of 32 feet.  Waboose is a relatively shallow lake with over 80% of the lake area less than 15 feet deep.  The shore line of Waboose is undeveloped, as the lake lies entirely within the Paul Bunyan State Forest.  A state-owned public access with an earthen ramp is located on the west shore of the lake.  Waboose is a popular fishing lake for largemouth bass, panfish, northern pike, as well as having a bonus walleye population. <br> \n <br> \nThe Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics.  Waboose is in lake class 35.  Other area lakes in this same classification include: Middle Crooked, Crystal, Frontenac, and Pickerel. <br> \n <br> \nThe fish population in Waboose has changed significantly since the initial survey in 1962.  Prior to 1985, the fish population in Waboose consisted primarily of walleye, largemouth bass, yellow perch, and white sucker.  Panfish populations have been increasing since the late 1980's and Waboose currently has good numbers of black crappie, bluegill, and pumpkinseed.  Northern pike were never sampled in earlier surveys, and it was not until 1996 that anglers reported catching them.  The 1999 survey was the first time that northern pike were sampled in the survey nets. <br> \n <br> \nWaboose supports an abundant largemouth bass population.  Excellent water quality, aquatic vegetation cover, and spawning substrate provide excellent habitat for largemouth bass.  Largemouth bass were sampled in high numbers during the spring electrofishing survey (53 bass/hour).  Anglers will find good numbers of bass in the 12-15 inch size range.  Panfish abundance was within the range \"typical\" for this lake class.  Anglers will find black crappie to be the best option, with fish in the 9-11 inch size range.  Size of bluegill and pumpkinseed tend to run small, with few fish over 7 inches in length.  The bluegill population is limited by slow growth rates.  Northern pike abundance (8.5 pike/gillnet) was within the range \"typical\" for this lake class.  Sampled northern pike had an average length and weight of 23.3 inches and 2.7 pounds, with pike measured up to 32.3 inches.  The number of larger pike sampled (> 28.0 inches) was low when compared to other area lakes.  Walleye abundance (2.3 walleye/gillnet) was down from past surveys.  Sampled walleye were large-sized, ranging in size from 22.5 to  27.5 inches.  Smaller walleye were missing in the sample, suggesting there are some missing year classes of walleye.  Waboose is stocked annually with walleye fry (145,000 fry). <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Waboose Lake is a 172-acre, hard-water lake located seven miles north of Nevis, Minnesota.  It has a maximum depth of 32 feet with about 83 percent of the lake shallower than 15 feet.  Shoal water soils are 50 percent muck, 21 percent sand, 21 percent rubble, and 8 percent gravel.All fish taken by test nets except common shiner were taken in numbers which exceeded the statewide median catch per set.  Included were: white sucker, golden shiner, yellow perch, walleye, and largemouth bass.  The walleye taken exceeded the statewide median catch by nearly six times and the regional median by over three times.  Walleyes were first stocked in the lake when it was used as a rearing pond in 1948 and 1949.  The lake has not been subject to winter kill since that time, and a good fishery has developed.There is no development on thsi lake at the present time because it is located within the Paul Bunyan State Forest.  There were 12 boats located at the public access area.Fish Stocking:From 1919 to 1940, bass and muskellunge were stocked at various times.  Since that time the stocking record is as follows:1956\t\tWAE     Fry\t1,000,0001957\t\tWAE\tFry\t  400,0001958\t\tWAE\tFry\t1,000,0001960\t\tWAE\tFry\t  500,0001961\t\tWAE\tFry\t  300,0001962\t\tWAE\tFry\t  100,000Continue the walleye fry stocking.  Do not introduce any other species as the numbers and growth rate of the fish present are very excellent.Comparison of Netting Results on Waboose Lake\t\t1954\t\t    1955\t        1962\tSpecies    #/net lbs/net\t#/net lbs/net\t   #/net  lbs/netWAE\t   25.3    20.3\t\t24.7  14.60        21.00  29.80WTS        22.0    37.6         23.7  49.00        13.00  12.78YEP        35.0     9.0         18.3   6.04        55.40   6.00GOS\t    1.0     -.-\t\t 1.7   0.60\t    9.00   1.28</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Waboose Lake is located seven miles north of Nevis in Hubbard County.  Waboose has a surface area of 172 acres and a maximum depth of 32 feet.  Waboose is a relatively shallow lake with over 80% of the lake area less than 15 feet deep.  A state-owned public access with an earthen ramp is located on the west shore of the lake.  Waboose Lake is located within the Paul Bunyan State Forest and there is no development on the lake.  Waboose Lake is a popular fishing lake for largemouth bass, panfish, as well as a bonus walleye population.  The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical and chemical characteristics.  Waboose Lake is in class 35.  Other area lakes in this same classification include Middle Crooked (south of Waboose), and Pickerel (seven miles west of Waboose).      Due to the shallow depth, Waboose Lake has suffered partial \"winterkills\".  The last reported winterkills occurred in 1975 and 1982. Winterkill usually happens  during long winters with  heavy snowfall.  Oxygen production through photosynthesis is limited due to snow and ice blocking sunlight from penetrating  the water column.  At the same time decaying aquatic vegetation on the lake bottom uses oxygen, causing oxygen levels in the lake to drop.  Shallow lakes with heavy aquatic vegetation growth are more likely to winterkill than are deep-water lakes.  Gamefish such as largemouth bass, bluegill, and walleye are less tolerant of low oxygen levels than are black bullheads and northern pike.  Winterkills on Waboose have only been partial and gamefish populations have always remained.  The fish population in Waboose has changed significantly since the initial survey in 1962.  Prior to 1985, the fish population in Waboose primarily consisted of walleye, largemouth bass, yellow perch, and white sucker.  Panfish populations have been increasing since the late 1980's and Waboose now has good numbers of black  crappie, bluegill, and pumpkinseed.  Northern pike were never sampled in earlier surveys on  Waboose Lake, and it was not until 1996 that anglers reported catching them.  The 1999 survey was the first time that northern pike were sampled in survey nets.  The introduction of northern pike, black crappie and other species is likely the result of illegal stockings by private individuals.Walleye were sampled in good numbers in Waboose with a gillnet catch rate of 6.1 walleye/net.  This catch rate is above the management goal of 3.0 walleye/net and above the \"normal range\" for this lake class.  Walleye were large-sized with an average length and weight of 19.8 inches and 2.7 pounds.  Walleye gillnet catch rates from past surveys have also been high.  Waboose Lake was used as a walleye rearing pond in the early 1950s but was discontinued because of difficulty in removing the fish.  With the recent addition of northern pike to Waboose Lake, it will be interesting to see if walleye abundance will be affected due to predation and competition for forage by northern pike.  Since 1994 Waboose Lake has been stocked in even years with walleye fry (140,000 fry).  Prior to 1994, Waboose Lake received annual stockings of walleye fry.  Walleye natural reproduction is difficult to evaluate due to years of consecutive stockings, but it is assumed to be minimal in this lake. Northern pike were sampled for the first time during 1999.  The northern pike catch rate of 4.1/gillnet is within the \"normal\" range for class 35 lakes.  Sampled northern pike had a mean length and weight of 22.8 inches and 2.6 pounds with the largest fish sampled measuring 25.5 inches. Waboose Lake supports an abundant largemouth bass population.  Good water quality, aquatic vegetation cover, and spawning substrate provide excellent habitat for largemouth bass.  Spring electrofishing was conducted on Waboose and catch rates were high (153 largemouth bass/hour). Sampled largemouth bass had an average length and weight of 11.3 inches and 0.9 pounds.  Good numbers of 14\" to 15\" bass were sampled, but fish over 16\" were sampled in low numbers.  The panfish population in Waboose has changed significantly since the late 1980's.  Black crappie were not sampled in Waboose Lake prior to 1989, while the 1999 survey showed good numbers of black crappie in all gear types.  Average length of black crappie was 7.8 inches with fish sampled up to 12.9 inches. Bluegill abundance has fluctuated in Waboose, but has generally been within or above the \"normal\" range for this class.  Average size of bluegill was small (4.0 inches), however bluegill up to 7.8 inches were sampled.  A few large yellow perch are present, but only provide a limited fishery as numbers are low.</p>",

This lake started out as a rearing pond for walleyes in the early 1950's.  The problem was getting the fish out, which they couldn't do, so it developed into a walleye lake.  It has carried a good walleye population though the years, out side of several winters when it froze out.  We do fry stocking most every year, but there is natural reproduction.  Waboose had one of the highest net cathces on waleyee in 1962, 21 fish per net.The lake recieves a lot of pressure, and this keeps the size down.  The largemouth bass and bluegills were brought in by unknown people, and they seem to be taking a foot hold.  We will continue to manage this lake for walleye.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Waboose Lake is located seven miles north of Nevis in Hubbard County.  Waboose has a surface area of 172 acres and a maximum depth of 32 feet.  Waboose is a relatively shallow lake with over 80% of the lake area less than 15 feet deep.  Waboose Lake lies entirely within the Paul Bunyan State Forest.  A state-owned public access with an earthen ramp is located on the west shore of the lake.  Waboose is a popular fishing lake for largemouth bass, panfish, as well as having a bonus walleye population.  The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical and chemical characteristics.  Waboose Lake is in class 35.  Other area lakes in this same classification include Middle Crooked and Pickerel.The fish population in Waboose has changed significantly since the initial survey in 1962.  Prior to 1985, the fish population in Waboose primarily consisted of walleye, largemouth bass, yellow perch, and white sucker.  Panfish populations have been increasing since the late 1980's and Waboose currently has good numbers of black crappie, bluegill, and pumpkinseed.  Northern pike were never sampled in earlier surveys and it was not until 1996 that anglers reported catching them.  The 1999 survey was the first time that northern pike were sampled in survey nets.  The introduction of northern pike, black crappie, and other species is likely the result of illegal stocking by private individuals.  Waboose supports an abundant largemouth bass population.  Good water quality, aquatic vegetation cover, and spawning substrate provide excellent habitat for largemouth bass.  Spring electrofishing was conducted on Waboose and catch rates were high (97 bass/hour).  Sampled largemouth bass had an average length and weight of 11.8 inches and 1.0 pounds with bass measured up to 20.2 inches.  Anglers will find good numbers of largemouth bass in the 12-15 inch range.  The panfish population in Waboose has changed significantly since the late 1980's.  Black crappie were not sampled in Waboose prior to 1989, while the 1999 and 2004 surveys showed good numbers of black crappie in all gear types.  Average size of black crappie was 7.1 inches with fish measured up to 14.1 inches.  Bluegill were sampled in moderate numbers, within the range \"typical\" for this lake class.  Average size of bluegill was small (4.7 inches), however, bluegill up to 7.9 inches were sampled.  Northern pike numbers have increased, with the gillnet catch rate of 10.0 northern pike/gillnet near the upper end of the range \"typical\" for this lake class.  Sampled northern pike had an average length of 24.6 inches with fish measured up to 30.6 inches.  Walleye abundance (3.5 walleye/gillnet) was just above the upper range \"typical\" for this lake class.  Walleye numbers in past surveys have fluctuated, and have generally been at higher numbers.  Sampled walleye were large-sized, ranging from 20.0 to 26.7 inches.  Smaller walleye were absent in the sample, suggesting that there are some missing year classes of walleye.  Waboose is currently stocked with walleye fry in even years (140,000 fry).  Waboose Lake was used as a walleye rearing pond in the early 1950's, but was discontinued because of difficulty in removing and harvesting the fish.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Waboose Lake is located in southern Hubbard County, 6.5 miles north of Nevis.  Waboose Lake has a surface area of 175 acres and a maximum depth of 32 feet.  Waboose is a relatively shallow lake with over 80% of the lake area less than 15 feet deep. The shore line of Waboose is undeveloped, as the lake lies entirely within the Paul Bunyan State Forest.  An earthen public access is located on the northwest end of the lake off of a forest road.  The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics. Waboose is in Lake Class 35. Class 35 lakes have a very high area less than 15 feet deep and are very irregularly shaped.  Other class 35 lakes in the Park Rapids area include: Middle Crooked, Crystal, Frontenac, and Pickerel. <br> \nWaboose Lake provides multi species opportunities to the angler for Largemouth Bass, Panfish, Northern Pike, and limited numbers of Walleye and Yellow Perch.  Largemouth Bass were sampled in much lower numbers than recent surveys, but had a larger average size.  Spring electrofishing sampled bass from 9.7 to 19.5 inches in length.  The summer bass had an average length of 14.8 inches, with fish sampled up to 17.9 inches. <br> \nBlack Crappie and Bluegill numbers have fluctuated in the past, and the 2014 catch rates were near average.  Black Crappie average length was 8.7 inches with the largest 13.7 inches.  Bluegills had an average length of 4.7 inches, with the largest 8.7 inches.  These panfish provide great angling opportunities with a number of Black Crappies over 10 inches and Bluegills over 6 inches. <br> \nNorthern Pike abundance was the highest since they were first sampled in 1999.  The average Northern Pike length was 21.5 inches, with the largest 30.2 inches.  There were very few Walleyes sampled, but sizes were large with an average length of 24.4 inches and all fish sampled over 22 inches.  Yellow Perch are generally small for anglers with an average length of 6.4 inches and the lengths ranged from 5.8 \u0013 8.0 inches.  These Yellow Perch provide forage for the Walleye and Northern Pike in the lake. <br> \nCurrently no aquatic invasive species (AIS) have been identified in Waboose. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access.</p>",

The average weight of the walleye sampled was 2.5 pounds with 82% in the 18.0 to 21.0 inch range.  Natural reproduction is difficult to evaluate because there are no stocking gaps (annual fry stocking).  Waboose Lake has suffered from low winter oxygen levels and occasional partial winter kills, however, largemouth bass have survived well with samples from 5.8 inches to 17.6 inches.  Black crappies are the most recent species introduction and have been sampled since 1989.  Their population had multiple year classes and ranged in length from 3.9 to 11.5 inches.  Bluegill numbers are presently low at 4.3 per trapnet set with the majority of those sampled 7.5 inches or more.  The yellow perch numbers are also low at the present time at 1.2 per gillnet set with a mean length of 8.9 inches.</p>",
