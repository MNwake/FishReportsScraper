                "narrative": "<p>Bunny Lake is 39 acres with a maximum depth of 6.5 feet, located approximately 7.5 miles northeast of Isabella, MN in Lake County.  The lake is surrounded by federal land and is accessible by portage from the northeast end of Sylvania Lake.  The portage trail is 200 feet long over a steep hill.  During winter months the frozen bog between Sylvania and Bunny Lake may also provide access for anglers.  The shoreline of the lake is entirely undeveloped, and is composed of forest and bog.  This diverse shoreline provides ample habitat for wildlife, including waterfowl such as swans, mallard ducks, and loons. <br> \n <br> \nBunny Lake is a soft-water lake with bog-stained, moderately clear water (Secchi disc visible to 3.5 feet).  The west half of the lake substrate is primarily muck, the east side is primarily sand.  Aquatic vegetation is occasional throughout the lake; stands include water lily, bulrush, stonewort, and burreed species.  The bog connecting Bunny and Sylvania Lakes may provide passage for fish between the two systems in times of high water.  Also, the bog shoreline and submerged vegetation in marshy areas of the lake offer very good spawning habitat for northern pike. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike catch rates were average for this type of lake in 2012.  Average size of northern pike sampled was small (17.0 inches and 1.3 pounds), the largest fish caught was 29.3 inches and weighed 5 pounds.  Northern pike growth has been slower than average compared to the area, however northern pike appear to be long-lived as fish up to nine years old were present in the 2012 sample. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch catch rates were lower than average in 2012.  Average size of yellow perch was 7.6 inches (0.2 pounds); the largest perch sampled was 11.0 inches and 0.7 pounds. Most of the fish aged were age-2 and this strong year class may provide good fishing for the next few years. <br> \n</p>",

The fish population in Bunny Lake is comprised of northern pike, yellow perch and white sucker.     Test nets in 1997 found northern pike numbers about average when compared to other lakes in this lake class.  Northern pike averaged 2.0 pounds each with fish up to 30 inches (5.7 pounds) sampled.     Yellow perch are present in about average numbers and averaged 9.2 inches.  About 33% of the yellow perch collected were greater than 10.0 inches.</p>",
