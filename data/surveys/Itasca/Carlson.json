                "narrative": "<p>The current fish population of Carlson Lake consist of fish species associated with frequent winterkill lakes.  Black and brown bullheads were the only fish caught by gill nets and trap nets during the sampling period.  All bullheads sampled are presently small in size (TL 9.4\" with most 73% - 5.9\" TL).Gill net catch per unit effort (CPUE) for brown bullheads in Carlson Lake was greater than the statewide median and fell well outside the upper limit of the third quartile range of Schupp's lake class #37.  Trap net CPUE for brown bullheads is greater than both the statewide median and the lake class median but falls within the first to third quartile range.  Brown bullheads pounds per set was greater for gill net catches than both the statewide median and lake class median falling outside the upper limit of the third quartile.  Trap net pounds per set for brown bullheads were similar to both the statewide median and the lake class median.Black bullheads CPUE for gill nets was greater than the statewide median but similar to the lake class median.  Trap net CPUE was greater than the statewide median but less than the lake class median and falling near the lower limit of the first quartile.  Pounds per set were similar to the lake class median and the statewide median for both gill nets and trap nets.Large numbers of northern redbelly dace were sampled in minnow traps and observed preparing spawning beds in shallow areas predominated by sand.</p>",
