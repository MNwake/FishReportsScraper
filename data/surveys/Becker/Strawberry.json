                "narrative": "<p>Strawberry Lake is a 1522-acre lake in north-central Becker County.  It has had a reputation as a good fishing lake depending on time of the year.  Water quality is relatively good and this is demonstrated by the presence of a tullibee population, a cold-water fish species.  It is also one of the few lakes in the area with a smallmouth bass population.  As with most area lakes, Strawberry Lake is undergoing increasing development pressure.The northern pike gill net (GN) catch rate in 2001 was 11.2 per set.  This represents an abundant northern pike population, but it consisted primarily of young fish with an overall average length of only 18.5 inches or 1.3 pounds.  Only four northern pike over 25 inches were sampled.  The walleye gill net catch rate in 2001 was 21.4 per GN, which is well above what is typically expected for a lake of this ecological type.  However, Strawberry Lake has a history of above average walleye gill net catches with a long-term average of 14.6 per set.  The walleyes sampled in 2001 had an average length and weight of 17 inches and 1.7 pounds.  Largemouth bass and smallmouth bass are both present in Strawberry Lake.Trap net catches of panfish in Strawberry Lake show a good bluegill population.  However, the population shows signs of heavy fishing pressure.  Bluegill growth rates were normal but very few fish over seven inches were present, suggesting anglers are harvesting them as soon as they reach a desirable size.  Black crappies do not appear nearly as abundant but their size is impressive.  The average length of the crappies sampled in 2001 was 11.4 inches.Other species in Strawberry Lake include: black bullhead, brown bullhead, hybrid sunfish, pumkinseed, rock bass, tullibee, white sucker, yellow perch, and yellow bullhead.  The ratio of black to yellow bullheads can be an indicator of water quality, with a higher yellow to black ratio indicating better water quality.  Yellow bullhead catch rates were lower in 2001 and black bullhead catch rates were higher.  Hopefully, this was just a normal fluctuation and not an early warning sign of declining water quality.  Every effort should be made by lakeshore residents to protect water quality and minimize nutrient input to the lake by using good lakeshore management practices.  These include: (1) leaving or establishing buffer strips of natural vegetation along the shores, (2) leaving aquatic vegetation stands intact, especially bulrush and cattail beds, (3) not fertilizing lawns or using phosphorus free fertilizers, (4) ensuring compliance of septic systems, (5) stabilizing eroding banks, and (6) utilizing practices illustrated in the DNR document \"Lakescaping for Wildlife and Water Quality\" when landscaping shoreline property.  Removal of emergent aquatic vegetation, particularly bulrushes, should be avoided at all costs.  Bulrushes are an extremely important feature of the lake ecosystem, both from a water quality and fish habitat standpoint.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Strawberry Lake is a 1,522-acre lake in north-central Becker County within the boundaries of the White Earth Indian Reservation.  It has a reputation as a good Walleye fishing lake depending on the time of the year.  It is also one of the few lakes in the Detroit Lakes area with a Smallmouth Bass population.  As with most area lakes, Strawberry Lake is undergoing increasing development pressure.  There is a state-owned access on the south shore of the lake.  A standard fisheries survey was conducted at the end of July 2022 to evaluate the fish populations at Strawberry Lake. <br> \n <br> \nThe 2022 Walleye gill net catch rate was 12.1 per set, slightly higher than the 11.7 per net caught in 2017.  The average length of fish sampled was 17.7 inches and ranged from 7.3 to 28.1 inches.  Almost 86% of the Walleyes sampled were over 15 inches.  Natural reproduction occurs at Strawberry Lake, but the strongest year-classes were in years when Walleye fingerlings were stocked.  Walleye catch rates, average size, and growth have remained relatively stable since the 1979 survey.  The gill net catch rate for Northern Pike in 2022 was 8.6 per set compared to 16.1 per set 2017.  This was slightly below the lake's historical average of 11.2 Northern Pike per set.  The sampled pike ranged from 10.1 to 34.8 inches with an average length of 17.7 inches.  Bluegill trap net catches in Strawberry Lake have historically fluctuated widely.  The 2022 trap net catch rate of 8.0 Bluegills per set was well below the historical average of 30.3 per net.  Bluegills averaged 6.3 inches with fish up to 8.9 inches sampled.  Black Crappie trap net catches in Strawberry Lake have historically been low.  However, though not considered the standard sampling gear, gill nets caught more Black Crappie with a catch rate of 6.0 fish per net, a record high for the lake.  Crappie averaged 9.2 inches with the biggest being 13.9 inches.  Largemouth Bass and Smallmouth Bass are both present in Strawberry Lake.  Relative abundances of both basses have been much higher since the 1980's than the period before.  The catch rate of Smallmouth Bass in gill nets set a record high of 4.3 fish per net in 2022.  Smallmouth Bass up to 20.0 inches were sampled and averaged almost 15 inches.  About 74% of the Smallmouth Bass sampled were over 14 inches.  The catch rate of Largemouth Bass was 1.8 fish per trap net, just below the historical average of 1.9 fish per trap net.  Largemouth Bass averaged only 10.6 inches long.  Yellow Perch gill net catches have remained very low since the 2001 survey.  Only three Yellow Perch per net were caught in 2022.  The lake's historical average is 11.6 Yellow Perch per net.  Perch length averaged only 6.3 inches.  Other species sampled in Strawberry Lake in 2022 included Black, Brown, and Yellow Bullhead, Pumpkinseed, Rock Bass, and White Sucker.  No Cisco (Tullibee) were caught in 2022.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>The gillnet catch for northern pike has declined from the 1986 survey but remains between the first and third quartile for this lake class (Schupp's #27).  Northern pike growth rates are good but only three year classes were found; two, three and four-year-olds.  Gillnets recorded an unusually high number of rock bass, 29.17/set, far above the third quartile.  The rock bass tend to be small, median length group 6.5 - 6.9 inches.  At 57.17/set, the bluegill trapnet catch is less than one-half of the previous surveys, but still above the third quartile for this lake class.  Offsetting part of the trapnet decline is a substantial increase in the gillnet catch.  Bluegills taken in gillnets were larger (median length group 6.0-6.4 inches).  Surveys prior to 1986 indicated this lake supported a very modest sunfish population with an excellent size structure.  Curiously, between the 1983 and 1986 surveys, sunfish exploded in abundance.  They now appear to be declining from the record numbers of 1986.  Three and four-year-old fish currently comprise 96% of the bluegill population and exhibit below average growth.  The lake contains populations of both largemouth and smallmouth bass.  Growth rates for these species are good.  The smallmouth population is high for this lake class, far above the gillnet third quartile, and an attraction for local devotees.  Yellow perch numbers in the gillnet have declined from the previous survey but continue to maintain a level between the first and third quartile, as they have since the 1971 survey.  This lake boasts one of the best walleye populations in the area.  It has maintained a gillnet catch rate well above the third quartile for this lake class since the early 70's.  The current gillnet catch rate, 20.0/set, is double the third quartile value.  Walleye length frequency distribution is excellent, eleven year classes are represented.  Growth rates are good through age four, somewhat below average thereafter.  Walleye ages indicate that natural reproduction is contributing significantly to the population but major year classes sustaining this popular fishery coincide with fingerling stocking years.  Although no tullibees were taken in test nets, a small tullibee was found in a walleye stomach, and residents report netting tullibees in the fall.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of nearshore fish species in Strawberry Lake, which lies within the boundaries of the White Earth Reservation, was conducted on July 24-27, 2023, by Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program staff. Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake, and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at all 18 sampling stations, but one station was sampled from the boat due to site conditions. Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample 17 stations and site conditions prevented the use of a seine at one station. Nearshore sampling captured 21 species of fish including seven species that are intolerant of disturbance (i.e., Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, Mimic Shiner, Rock Bass, and Smallmouth Bass) and one species that is tolerant of disturbance (i.e., Green Sunfish). <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore data was combined with gill net and trap net data from a July 2022 survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based IBI (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment. In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g., Blackchin Shiner, Iowa Darter, and Rock Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g., Black Bullhead, Fathead Minnow, and Green Sunfish). The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Strawberry Lake is known as a good all-around fishing lake with particularly good walleye angling at times.  It is one of few area lakes with a smallmouth bass population.  Some large walleyes and northern pike are also produced.  Lakes with good oxygen in the lower, cooler portions of their thermoclines have the best potential to produce large pike.  Strawberry Lake, as evidenced by its tullibee population, is such a lake.  Even though conditions are excellent for large northern pike in Strawberry Lake and growth rates are good, pike larger than 30 inches (about eight pounds) are rare.  It is likely that anglers remove most of the lake's pike before they attain a large size.  No DNR creel surveys have been done on the lake, but it is believed that fishing pressure is relatively heavy.  Catch and release fishing for larger pike (those longer than 24 inches) is not only a good idea, it is necessary if anglers desire to catch big pike like back in \"the old days.\"Historically, yellow perch net catches have remained within the \"normal\" range in Strawberry Lake as they are at present.  Yellow perch are the primary forage for northern pike, largemouth bass, smallmouth bass, and walleye as well as a competitor or predator of young bluegill.  Consequently, they are important to the fish community and will be monitored along with other gamefish and panfish.  Drastic reductions in yellow perch in Strawberry Lake may signal problems for gamefish.The good news is that there are still some large fish remaining in Strawberry Lake.  Also, the walleye population is relatively stable and well above the normal range in abundance for similar lakes.  The average sampled walleye weighed 2.2 pounds and was 18.1 inches long.  Although there is some natural reproduction of walleye in Strawberry Lake, the population appears to be maintained by biennial fingerling stocking in recent years.  Anglers can help to sustain fish populations by releasing medium to large fish, which usually don't taste as good as the smaller ones anyway.Other ways that anglers and lakeshore owners can help to maintain fish populations, water quality, and property values is by conserving and protecting natural fish habitat.  Bulrushes and cattails are particularly valuable for fish spawning, feeding, and rearing as well as for erosion protection and nutrient uptake.  Shoreline buffer zones of unmowed, unfertilized natural vegetation help to slow erosion and sedimentation.  Strawberry Lake's fish populations are sustainable with care and stewardship from its watershed inhabitants and users.  Participation in the Pollution Control Agency's Citizen Lake Monitoring Program is valuable for monitoring trends in water quality.  Lakeshore residents, whether seasonal or permanent, are urged to get involved.  In addition, guides and books are available for riparian owners who desire to landscape their shorelines in a manner that will help sustain water quality.  One book that will be available in autumn of 1997 is entitled \"Lakescaping for Wildlife and Water Quality.\"</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Strawberry Lake has had a reputation as a good fishing lake at certain times of the year.  Water quality has been relatively good and this is demonstrated by the presence of a tullibee population, a cold-water fish species requiring well-oxygenated water in the cooler deeper layers in the heat of the summer.  It is also one of the few lakes in the area with a smallmouth bass population.  As with most area lakes, Strawberry Lake is undergoing increasing development pressure. <br> \n <br> \nThe northern pike gill net catch rate in 2006 was 10.7 per set.  This is a high number of fish, but they were primarily young with an average size of only 17.7 inches or 1.3 pounds.  The walleye gill net catch rate in 2006 was 14.5 per gill net, which is higher than what is typically expected for a lake of this ecological type.  However, Strawberry Lake has a history of above average walleye gill net catches with a long-term average of 14.6 per set.  The walleyes sampled in 2006 had an average length and weight of 17 inches and 1.7 pounds.  Largemouth bass and smallmouth bass are both present in relatively good numbers in Strawberry Lake. <br> \n <br> \nTrap net catches of panfish in Strawberry Lake show a good bluegill population.  However, the population shows signs of heavy fishing pressure.  Bluegill growth rates were normal but very few fish over eight inches were present, suggesting anglers are harvesting them as soon as they reach a desirable size.  Black crappies do not appear nearly as abundant but their size is impressive.  The average length of the crappies sampled in 2006 was 10.4 inches. <br> \n <br> \nOther species in Strawberry Lake include: black bullhead, brown bullhead, green sunfish, hybrid sunfish, pumkinseed, rock bass, tullibee, white sucker, yellow perch, and yellow bullhead.  The ratio of black to yellow bullheads can be an indicator of water quality, with a higher yellow to black ratio indicating better water quality.  Yellow bullhead catch rates were unchanged in 2006 and black bullhead catch rates were definitely higher.  Hopefully, this was just a normal fluctuation and not an early warning sign of declining water quality.  Every effort should be made by lakeshore residents to protect water quality and minimize nutrient input to the lake by using good lakeshore management practices.  These include: (1) leaving or establishing buffer strips of natural vegetation along the shores, (2) leaving aquatic vegetation stands intact, especially bulrush and cattail beds, (3) not fertilizing lawns or using phosphorus free fertilizers, (4) ensuring compliance of septic systems, (5) stabilizing eroding banks, and (6) utilizing practices illustrated in the DNR document \"Lakescaping for Wildlife and Water Quality\" when landscaping shoreline property.  Removal of emergent aquatic vegetation, particularly bulrushes, should be avoided at all costs.  Bulrushes are an extremely important feature of the lake ecosystem, both from a water quality and fish habitat standpoint.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Strawberry Lake has a reputation as a good fishing lake at certain times of the year.  Water quality has been relatively good and this was demonstrated by the presence of a tullibee (cisco) population.  Cisco is a cold-water fish species requiring well-oxygenated water in the cooler deeper layers in the heat of the summer.  Although for the first time since 1991, no cisco were sampled in 2012.  Strawberry is also one of the few lakes in the area with a smallmouth bass population.  As is the case with most area lakes, Strawberry Lake is undergoing increasing development pressure. <br> \n <br> \nThe northern pike gill net catch rate in 2012 was 18.7 per set.  This was the highest catch rate for pike since 1971 and they were primarily young with an average size of 17.9 inches or 1.2 pounds.  The walleye gill net catch rate in 2012 was 11.7 per gill net, which is higher than what is typically expected for a lake of this ecological type.  However, Strawberry Lake has a history of above average walleye gill net catches with a long-term average of 14.3 per set.  The walleyes sampled in 2012 had an average length and weight of 16.5 inches and 1.7 pounds.  Largemouth bass and smallmouth bass are both present in relatively good numbers and a wide variety of sizes in Strawberry Lake. <br> \n <br> \nTrap net catches showed an abundant bluegill population.  However, the population shows signs of heavy fishing pressure.  Few fish over eight inches were present, suggesting anglers are harvesting them as soon as they reach a desirable size.  In studies prior to 1986, about one-third of sampled bluegills were longer than 8.0 inches.  Since 1986 only about 1.6% of sampled bluegills have been longer than 8.0 inches.  Black crappies do not appear nearly as abundant as bluegills, but their size is impressive.  The average length of the crappies sampled in 2012 was 11.3 inches. <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species present in Strawberry Lake include: black, brown, and yellow bullhead, green, hybrid, and pumpkinseed sunfish, rock bass, white sucker, and yellow perch.  The ratio of black to yellow bullheads can be an indicator of water quality, with a higher yellow to black ratio indicating better water quality.  Yellow and black bullhead catch rates both increased in 2012, but black bullheads much more than yellows.  In this case the dramatic increase in black bullheads in not believed to be an indicator of declining water quality.  Rather, a washed out road near the northeast shore about 10 years ago is thought to have allowed a large influx of black bullheads from Big Rat Lake.  How long these fish will affect Strawberry Lake remains to be seen, but in the short term, bullhead numbers are still increasing. <br> \n <br> \nEvery effort should be made by lakeshore residents to protect water quality and minimize nutrient input to the lake by using the best watershed and lakeshore management practices available.  Removal of emergent aquatic vegetation, particularly bulrushes, should be avoided.  Bulrushes are an extremely important feature of the lake ecosystem, both from a water quality and fish habitat standpoint.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Strawberry Lake is a 1,522-acre, class-27 lake in north-central Becker County within the boundaries of the White Earth Indian Reservation.  It has a reputation as a good Walleye fishing lake depending on the time of the year.  Water quality is relatively good and the lake contains a Cisco population.  Carlson's trophic state index based on Secchi disk readings, total phosphorus, and chlorophyll-a was near 40 (mesotrophic).  It is also one of the few lakes in the Detroit Lakes area with a Smallmouth Bass population.  As with most area lakes, Strawberry Lake is undergoing increasing development pressure. <br> \n <br> \nThe gill net catch rate for Northern Pike in 2017 was 16.1 per set.  This was the second highest catch rate since 1971 and well above the lake's historical mean of 11.2 pike per set.  The mean length of Northern Pike sampled in gill nets was 17.8 inches and lengths ranged from 10.4 to 25.2 inches. <br> \n <br> \nThe 2017 Walleye gill net catch rate was 11.7 per set, similar to 2012 and just below the historical average.  Walleye sampled had a mean length of 17.0 inches.  Although regular fingerling stocking occurs in Strawberry Lake, a significant portion of the Walleye catch in 2017 appears to have originated from natural reproduction.  Approximately 44% of the Walleyes originated from years when no stocking occurred.   <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch gill net catches have remained very low over the four most recent assessments, with a new historic low catch in 2017 of 0.6 Yellow Perch per net.  The lake's historical mean is 11.6 Yellow Perch per net.  Lengths of the sampled perch ranged from 6.2 to 8.3 inches with a mean of 7.2 inches. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill trap net catches in Strawberry Lake have historically fluctuated widely.  The 2017 trap net catch rate of 11.4 Bluegills per set was below the historical average of 30.3 per net.  Lengths of sampled Bluegills ranged from 3.0 to 9.0 inches with an average length of 6.3 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass and Smallmouth Bass are both present in Strawberry Lake.  Relative abundances of both basses have been much higher since the 1980's than the period before.  The gill net catch rate of Smallmouth Bass set a record high of 3.1 fish per net in 2017.  Smallmouth Bass ranged 10.2 - 18.7 inches in length and averaged 15.9 inches.  The trap net catch rate of Largemouth Bass was 2.6 fish per net, above the historical mean.  Largemouth Bass ranged 5.7 - 18.9 inches in length and averaged 10.1 inches in length.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie trap net catches in Strawberry Lake have historically been low.  The 2017 catch rate was 0.5 crappies per trap net.  Though not considered the standard sampling gear, gill nets caught more Black Crappie with a catch rate of 3.1 fish per net.  Gill net caught Black Crappie averaged 10.2 inches in length and ranged 5.8 - 13.0 inches. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled in Strawberry Lake in 2017 included Black, Yellow, and Brown Bullhead, Hybrid and Pumpkinseed Sunfish, Rock Bass, and White Sucker.  No Ciscoes were caught in 2017.  </p>",
