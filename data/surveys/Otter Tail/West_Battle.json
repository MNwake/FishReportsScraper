                "narrative": "<p> West Battle Lake is a 5,624-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located in south-central Otter Tail County.  The city of Battle Lake, Minnesota abuts the west shoreline.  The immediate watershed is composed primarily of agricultural land interspersed with hardwood woodlots.  The maximum depth is 108 feet; however, 44% of the lake is 15 feet or less in depth.  Water clarity in this lake is excellent; the secchi disk reading for the 2007 survey was 16.3 feet.  Secchi disk readings have ranged from 8.0 to 19.5 feet in previous surveys.  The MNDNR has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different lake classes based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics.  West Battle Lake is included in lake class 27.  Other area lakes in this same class include North Lida, Rush, Pelican, and Big Pine. <br> \n     The majority of the shoreline on West Battle Lake has been extensively developed.  Homes, cottages, and resorts compose the development.  The 1995 lake resurvey referenced 505 homes/cottages and five resorts.  A DNR-owned double concrete public access is located on the east shoreline of the lake and a city-owned double concrete public access is located on the west shoreline.   The shoal water substrates consist primarily of sand and gravel.  Stands of hardstem bulrush and common cattail are scattered along the south and east shorelines of the lake.  Emergent aquatic plants such as bulrush and cattail provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat, and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms, and can actually absorb and break down polluting chemicals.  Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish such as northern pike, largemouth bass, and panfish.  They also serve as important nursery areas for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit.  To maintain the excellent water quality and angling that this lake has to offer, it is imperative to preserve the quality of the aquatic habitat.\t <br> \n     A cooperative walleye spawning habitat improvement project between the West Battle Lake Association and DNR-Fisheries was completed in the fall of 1999.  Rock was added to Gizzard Creek (inlet from Clitherall Lake) to enhance existing walleye spawning habitat. <br> \n     West Battle Lake can be ecologically classified as a bass-panfish-walleye type of lake and this is reflected in the assemblage of the fish community.  Northern pike, largemouth bass, walleye, black crappie, and bluegill are the dominant species in the fish community.  <br> \n     Walleye is a primary management species in West Battle Lake.  The test-net catch rate for walleye declined in 2007 but remains within the normal range for class 27 lakes.  Walleye ranged in length from 9.7 to 29.7 inches with an average length and weight of 14.8 inches and 1.4 pounds.  Age and catch data indicate that the 2005 and 2001 year classes are strong and should provide consistently good walleye angling for several years.  Walleye exhibit good growth with an average length of 14.9 inches at four years of age.   <br> \n     Data from recent test-netting assessments indicate that walleye reproduction is limited in West Battle Lake and that walleye stocking is needed to maintain the population.  Stocking efforts on West Battle Lake have increased from 1,250 pounds in 1996 to 2,500 pounds in 1998 and 1999, 3,750 pounds in 2001 and 5,000 pounds in 2003, 2005, and 2007.  Walleye fingerlings will continue to be stocked at this rate on a biennial  basis.  In addition, walleye fingerling stocking by the West Battle Lake Association occurred in 2002. Data from future population assessments will determine it this increase in walleye stocking can improve the walleye population in West Battle Lake.   <br> \n      The test-net catch rate for northern pike was within the normal range for class 27 lakes.  Age and length data indicate that northern pike reproduction is consistently good.  Northern pike ranged in length from 12.8 to 33.3 inches with an average length and weight of 21.9 inches and 2.7 pounds.  Pike attain an average length of 24.2 inches at five years of age.  An experimental size regulation (24.0 to 36.0 inch protected slot limit) was implemented in 2003 in an attempt to create a quality pike fishery.  Pike size structure has steadily improved; thirty-one percent of the pike sampled in 2007 were within the protected slot compared to 24% in 2004 and 17% in 2001. <br> \n     West Battle is a designated muskellunge lake and dark house spearing is prohibited.  Muskellunge (2,500 fingerlings) are stocked by the DNR on a biennial basis.  A spring muskellunge assessment was conducted in 2007.  Ninety-one muskellunge, ranging in length from 10.6 to 53.0 inches, were sampled.  Most of the fish (77%) were sampled in Napanee Bay, located on the south east side of the lake.  Age data indicate that muskellunge reproduction is limited and that stocking is maintaining the population.   <br> \n     Test-net catch data indicate that a high-density largemouth bass population exists in West Battle Lake.  Bass ranged in length from 7.3 to 16.0 inches.  Age and length data indicate that largemouth bass reproduction is consistently good.  Bass reach an average length of 11.6 inches at four years of age. <br> \n     Data from recent test-netting assessments indicate that bluegill and black crappie are abundant.  Nineteen percent of the bluegills were at least 7.0 inches in length.  Both species exhibit moderate growth rates. <br> \n     Yellow perch (a primary forage fish) continue to be abundant in West Battle Lake.  The catch rate in 2007 remained consistent with previous surveys. <br> \n     Anglers can maintain or improve the quality of fishing for all species of fish in West Battle Lake by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large-size fish while allowing the harvest of the more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with opportunities to catch more large fish in the future. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>     West Battle Lake is a 5,624-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located in south-central Otter Tail County.  The city of Battle Lake, Minnesota abuts the west shoreline.  The immediate watershed is composed primarily of agricultural land interspersed with hardwood woodlots.  The maximum depth is 108 feet; however, 44% of the lake is 15 feet or less in depth.  Water clarity in this lake is excellent; the secchi disk reading was 15.9 feet.  Secchi disk readings have ranged from 8.0 to 19.5 feet in previous surveys. <br> \n     The majority of the shoreline of West Battle Lake has been extensively developed.  Homes, cottages, and resorts compose the development.   A DNR-owned public access is located on the east shoreline of the lake and a city-owned public access is located on the west shoreline.   The shoal water substrates consist primarily of sand and gravel.  Stands of hardstem bulrush and common cattail are scattered along the south and east shorelines of the lake.  Emergent aquatic plants such as bulrush and cattail provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat, and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms, and can actually absorb and break down polluting chemicals.  Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish such as Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, and panfish.  They also serve as important nursery areas for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit.  To maintain the excellent water quality and angling that this lake has to offer, it is imperative to preserve the quality of the aquatic habitat.\t <br> \n     West Battle Lake is a popular recreational and angling lake.  The dominant gamefish species are Walleye, Northern Pike, Muskellunge, Largemouth Bass, Bluegill, and Black Crappie.  Size distribution for these species appears to be good.   <br> \n     Walleye abundance is the lowest recorded for this lake.  Walleyes ranged in length from 8.9 to 21.9 inches with an average length and weight of 14.5 inches and 1.2 pounds.  Walleyes attain an average length of 15.3 inches at four years of age.   <br> \n     A moderate density Northern Pike population exists.  Age and length data indicate that Northern Pike reproduction is consistently good.  Northern Pike ranged in length from 11.2 to 27.6 inches with an average length and weight of 19.2 inches and 1.5 pounds.  Pike attain an average length of 23.2 inches at five years of age.  In 2003, an experimental size regulation (24.0 to 36.0 inch protected slot limit) was implemented in an attempt to create a quality pike fishery. <br> \n     Data from recent spring trap net assessments indicate that a quality Muskellunge population exists.  Muskellunge sampled during the 2016 spring assessment ranged in length from 35.5 to 51.4 inches with an average length of 44.3 inches.     <br> \n     Largemouth Bass ranged in length from 5.5 to 16.9 inches.  Age data indicate that Largemouth Bass reproduction is consistently good.  Bass attain an average length of 12.9 inches at five years of age. <br> \n     Eighteen percent of the Bluegills were 7.0 inches or greater in length.  Bluegills attain an average length of 7.5 inches at seven years of age.   <br> \n     Eighty-three percent of the Black Crappies were 10.0 inches or greater in length.  Crappies attain an average length of 9.5 inches at four years of age. <br> \n     Anglers can maintain or improve the quality of fishing for all species of fish in West Battle Lake by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large-size fish while allowing the harvest of the more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with opportunities to catch more large fish in the future. <br> \n</p>",

The average size of walleye has remained fairly stable at 1.2 lbs.  The creel census conducted in 1983 indicated good catches of walleyes for a multispecies lake (0.28 walleyes/angling hr.).  Aging data indicates there is natural reproduction of walleye.   <br> \n     Creel census data also indicated a good catch rate for bluegills (0.35 bluegills/angling hr.).  Average size was slightly over 1/4 lb. each.  <br> \n     The gill net catch rate of yellow perch was 12.6 per net in 1976 and increased to 18.6 per net.   <br> \n     The gill net catch rate for northern pike remained fairly stable since the 1976 survey.   <br> \n     West Battle Lake is a designated muskie lake, as such, it receives periodic stockings of muskie fingerlings.  In the past, the shoepack strain of muskie was stocked by the state.  These fish have been shown to grow very slowly in many waters.  Future stockings should be from a faster growing stock.  An increase in stocking will have to occur if the angler's catch is to increase.  Rather than stocking many lakes in Ottertail County with a few muskies (less than 500), it seems best to concentrate stocking a designated lake such as West Battle. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>     West Battle Lake is a 5,624-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located in south-central Otter Tail County.  The city of Battle Lake, Minnesota abuts the west shoreline.  The immediate watershed is composed primarily of agricultural land interspersed with hardwood woodlots.  West Battle Lake is connected to East Battle and Clitherall Lakes via un-navigable inlets.  It is also connected to Molly Stark Lake via an un-navigable outlet.  The maximum depth is 108 feet; however, 44% of the lake is 15 feet or less in depth.  The secchi disk reading during the 2020 survey was 19.8 feet.  Previous secchi disk readings ranged from 8.0 to 19.5 feet. <br> \n     The majority of the shoreline of West Battle Lake has been extensively developed.  Homes, cottages, and resorts compose the development.   A DNR-owned public access is located on the east shoreline of the lake and a city-owned public access is located on the west shoreline.  The shoal water substrates consist primarily of sand and gravel.  Stands of hardstem bulrush and common cattail are scattered along the south and east shorelines of the lake.  Emergent aquatic plants such as bulrush and cattail provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat, and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms, and can actually absorb and break down polluting chemicals.  Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish such as Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, and panfish.  They also serve as important nursery areas for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit.  To maintain the excellent water quality and angling that this lake has to offer, it is imperative to preserve the quality of the aquatic habitat. <br> \n     A cooperative project between DNR Fisheries and other partners was completed in 2020 to enhance the Walleye spawning habitat in Gizzard Creek.\t <br> \n     A special gillnetting assessment was conducted to analyze the Walleye and Northern Pike populations. <br> \n     Walleye abundance in the 2020 survey was slightly below the historical average.  Walleyes ranged in length from 14.6 to 25.8 inches with an average length and weight of 18.5 inches and 2.2 pounds.  Walleyes attain an average length of 15.0 inches at four years of age.   <br> \n     A moderate density Northern Pike population exists.  Age and length data indicate that Northern Pike reproduction is consistently good.  Northern Pike ranged in length from 9.5 to 28.9 inches with an average length and weight of 19.4 inches and 1.6 pounds.  Pike attain an average length of 22.9 inches at five years of age.  In 2003, an experimental size regulation (24.0 to 36.0 inch protected slot limit) was implemented in an attempt to create a quality pike fishery. <br> \n     An abundant Largemouth Bass population exists.  Largemouth Bass ranged in length from 5.8 to 16.3 inches.  Age data indicate that Largemouth Bass reproduction is consistently good.  Bass attain an average length of 11.4 inches at five years of age. <br> \n     Black Crappies are also abundant and have consistently good reproduction.  Forty-three percent of the Black Crappies were 10.0 inches or greater in length.  Crappies attain an average length of 10.8 inches at five years of age. <br> \n     Anglers can maintain or improve the quality of fishing for all species of fish in West Battle Lake by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large-size fish while allowing the harvest of the more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with opportunities to catch more large fish in the future. <br> \n     West Battle Lake was listed as infested with zebra mussels in 2016.  Aquatic invasive species are threatening Minnesota waters.  Aquatic invasive species can potentially harm water quality, water recreation, aquatic habitat, native species, and fish populations.  Anglers can help prevent the introduction and spread of invasive species by following watercraft transportation laws.       <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

The average weight of walleye increased from 1.2 lbs. to 1.8 lbs.  The rock and gravel bar near the outlet to Molly Stark Lake should be investigated to determine if it is feasible to improve this area for walleye spawning.  <br> \n     The gill net catch rate of northern pike has remained stable since the 1976 survey.  The average weight of northern pike increased slightly.  <br> \n     The yellow perch gill net catch rate was 14.4 per net, which is similar to the 1983 survey (18.6/net).   <br> \n     The bluegill trap net catch rate was 135.4 per net, which is triple the catch rate in the 1983 survey.  The average size of bluegill has decreased slightly.  <br> \n     No muskies were sampled by netting; however, one was sampled during electrofishing.   <br> \n     Lake whitefish were not sampled; however, many were observed while electrofishing.  <br> \n</p>",

Age data indicate good reproduction with age-classes I+ through IV+ represented in the sample.   <br> \n     Bluegill abundance declined slightly from 135.4 per trap net in 1986 to 126.6 per net, but remains over four times the area median.  Seven percent of the bluegills measured were 7.0 inches or greater in length.  Growth rates appear to be average.  <br> \n     Largemouth bass abundance is four times the area median at 4.0 per trap net. Largemouth bass abundance has historically been high.  Bass reproduction appears good as the sample was composed of fish aged II+ through V+.  <br> \n     Black crappie abundance also remains well above the area median at 1.4 per trap net.  Age data indicate good crappie reproduction.  <br> \n     Yellow perch abundance decreased slightly from 14.4 per gill net in 1986 to 12.6 per net, but remains equivalent to the area median.  <br> \n     Walleye abundance increased slightly from 4.5 per gill net in 1986 to 5.0 per net, but remains below catch rates in previous surveys. The average weight of walleye decreased from 1.8 lbs. in 1986 to 1.1 lbs.  Using expanded age information, it is estimated that 24% of the walleyes sampled corresponded to the 1985 year class. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>West Battle Lake is a 5,624-acre, mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located in south-central Otter Tail County.  The city of Battle Lake, Minnesota abuts the west shoreline.  The immediate watershed is composed primarily of agricultural land interspersed with hardwood woodlots.  The maximum depth is 108 feet; however,  44% of the lake is 15 feet or less in depth.  Water clarity in this lake is excellent; the secchi disk reading for this survey was 19.5 feet.  Secchi disk readings have ranged from 8.0 to 17.5 feet in previous surveys.  West Battle Lake is included in lake class 27 of the Minnesota DNR lake classification scheme.     The majority of the shoreline on West Battle Lake has been extensively developed.  Homes, cottages, and resorts compose the development.  The 1995 lake resurvey referenced 505 homes/cottages and five resorts.  A DNR-owned concrete public access is located on the east shoreline of the lake and a city-owned concrete public access is located on the west shoreline.   The shoal water substrates consist primarily of sand and gravel.  Stands of hardstem bulrush and common cattail are scattered along the south and east shorelines of the lake.  Emergent aquatic plants such as bulrush and cattail provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat, and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms, and can actually absorb and break down polluting chemicals.  Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish such as northern pike, largemouth bass, and panfish.  They also serve as important nursery areas for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit.  To maintain the excellent water quality and angling that this lake has to offer, it is imperative to preserve the quality of the aquatic habitat.       A cooperative walleye spawning habitat improvement project between the West Battle Lake Association and DNR-Fisheries was completed in the fall of 1999.  Rock was added to Gizzard Creek (inlet from Clitherall Lake) to enhance existing walleye spawning habitat.     West Battle Lake can be ecologically classified as a bass-panfish-walleye type of lake and this is reflected in the assemblage of the fish community.  Northern pike, largemouth bass, walleye, black crappie, and bluegill are the dominant species in the fish community.      West Battle is a designated muskellunge lake and dark house spearing is prohibited.  Muskellunge are stocked by the DNR on a biennial basis.  A muskellunge assessment was conducted in 2003.  Thirty-one muskellunge, ranging in length from 34.0 to 49.0 inches, were sampled.  Age data indicate that muskellunge reproduction is limited and that stocking is maintaining the population.      Walleye is a primary management specie in West Battle Lake.  The test-net catch rate for walleye was within the normal range for class 27 lakes.  Walleye ranged in length from 7.2 to 27.2 inches with an average length and weight of 15.5 inches and 1.5 pounds.  Age and catch data show that the 2001 year class is strong and should provide consistently good walleye angling for several years.  Walleye exhibit good growth with an average length of 16.3 inches at four years of age.       Data from recent test-netting assessments indicate that walleye reproduction is limited in West Battle Lake and that walleye fingerling stocking is maintaining the population.  Catch rate data over the recent series of surveys indicate that an accelerated walleye fingerling stocking program adopted by the DNR appears to be improving the walleye population in West Battle Lake.       The test-net catch rate for northern pike was within the normal range for class 27 lakes.  Age and length data indicate that northern pike reproduction is consistently good.  Northern pike ranged in length from 13.8 to 28.9 inches with an average length and weight of 21.5 inches and 2.2 pounds.  Pike attain an average length of 22.2 inches at five years of age.  An experimental size regulation (24.0 to 36.0 inch protected slot limit) was implemented in 2003 in an attempt to create a quality pike fishery .     Test-net catch data indicate that a high-density largemouth bass population exists.  Bass ranged in length from 5.6 to 15.2 inches.  Age and length data indicate that largemouth bass reproduction is consistently good.  Bass reach an average length of 12.1 inches at four years of age.     Data from recent test-netting assessments indicate that bluegill and black crappie are abundant.  Age data indicate that the 2001 year class of black crappie may be strong which should provide excellent crappie angling for several years.  Nineteen percent of the bluegills were at least 7.0 inches in length.  Both species exhibit moderate growth rates.     Anglers can maintain or improve the quality of fishing for all species of fish in West Battle Lake by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large-size fish while allowing the harvest of the more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with opportunities to catch more large fish in the future.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>     West Battle Lake is a 5,624-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located in south-central Otter Tail County.  The city of Battle Lake, Minnesota abuts the west shoreline.  The immediate watershed is composed primarily of agricultural land interspersed with hardwood woodlots.  The maximum depth is 108 feet; however, 44% of the lake is 15 feet or less in depth.  Water clarity in this lake is excellent; the secchi disk reading for the 2010 survey was 14.5 feet.  Secchi disk readings have ranged from 8.0 to 19.5 feet in previous surveys. <br> \n     The majority of the shoreline on West Battle Lake has been extensively developed.  Homes, cottages, and resorts compose the development.   A DNR-owned, double concrete, public access is located on the east shoreline of the lake and a city-owned, double concrete, public access is located on the west shoreline.   The shoal water substrates consist primarily of sand and gravel.  Stands of hardstem bulrush and common cattail are scattered along the south and east shorelines of the lake.  Emergent aquatic plants such as bulrush and cattail provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat, and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms, and can actually absorb and break down polluting chemicals.  Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish such as northern pike, largemouth bass, and panfish.  They also serve as important nursery areas for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit.  To maintain the excellent water quality and angling that this lake has to offer, it is imperative to preserve the quality of the aquatic habitat.\t <br> \n     West Battle Lake is both a popular recreational and angling lake.  Recent lake survey data indicate that West Battle Lake has good populations of walleye, northern pike, muskellunge, largemouth bass, bluegill, and black crappie.  Size distribution for these species appears to be good also.  The prolificacy of these species can be attributed to the abundance of quality habitat that is available. <br> \n     Walleye is a primary management species in West Battle Lake.  Walleye ranged in length from 7.0 to 26.8 inches with a mean length and weight of 14.5 inches and 1.2 pounds.  Walleye attain an average length of 14.3 inches at four years of age.   <br> \n     A moderate density northern pike population exists.  Age and length data indicate that northern pike reproduction is consistently good.  Northern pike ranged in length from 12.0 to 32.7 inches with a mean length and weight of 21.2 inches and 2.1 pounds.  Pike attain an average length of 23.8 inches at five years of age.  In 2003 an experimental size regulation (24.0 to 36.0 inch protected slot limit) was implemented in an attempt to create a quality pike fishery. <br> \n     West Battle is a designated muskellunge lake and dark house spearing is prohibited.  Data from recent spring trap net assessments, indicates that a quality muskellunge population exists.  Muskellunge sampled during the 2010 spring assessment ranged in length from 30.8 to 52.5 inches with a mean length of 43.1.  Age data indicate that muskellunge reproduction is limited so muskellunge are stocked by the DNR on a biennial basis.   <br> \n     Test-net catch data indicate that a high-density largemouth bass population exists in West Battle Lake.  Bass ranged in length from 5.9 to 16.4 inches with a mean length and weight of 10.5 inches and 0.8 pounds.  Age data indicate that largemouth bass reproduction is consistently good.  Bass reach an average length of 11.2 inches at four years of age. <br> \n     Data from recent test-netting assessments indicate that bluegill and black crappie are abundant.  Thirty-nine percent of the bluegills were at least 7.0 inches in length.  Forty-six percent of the black crappies were at least 10.0 inches in length.  Both species exhibit moderate growth rates. <br> \n     Anglers can maintain or improve the quality of fishing for all species of fish in West Battle Lake by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large-size fish while allowing the harvest of the more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with opportunities to catch more large fish in the future. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>West Battle Lake is a 5,624-acre, mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located in south-central Otter Tail County.  The maximum depth is 108 feet; however,  44% of the lake is 15 feet or less in depth.  The shoreline length is 14.3 miles and the secchi disk reading for this survey was 17.5 feet.  Secchi disk readings, a measurement of water clarity, have ranged from 8.0 to 17.5 feet in previous surveys.  A DNR-owned concrete public access is located on the east shoreline of the lake and a city-owned concrete public access is located on the west shoreline.     The majority of the shoreline is developed with year-round homes, cabins and resorts.  Lakeshore development has been shown to negatively impact water quality by increasing nutrient levels and shoreline erosion.  This can result in increased plankton/algae blooms, aquatic plant growth and suspended sediments, all of which can lead to decreased water clarity.  With increased water levels during recent years on West Battle Lake, shoreline erosion has been a concern to many lakeshore owners.  By using best management practices (BMP's) and \"lakescaping concepts\", impacts of shoreline development and erosion can be minimized.  Contact any county extension office for information on BMP's and your local DNR-Fisheries office for information on lakescaping techniques.     Sand comprises the majority of the shoreline substrates.  The most abundant type of submerged aquatic plant is chara, a plant that can grow up to one foot or more off the bottom.  Emergent aquatic plants such as hardstem bulrush and common cattail are located in areas throughout the lake.  These emergent plants provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms from erosion and can actually absorb and breakdown polluting chemicals.  Emergent plants provide spawning habitat for fish species like northern pike, largemouth bass and panfish.  They also serve as important nursery areas for all species of fish. Because of their important ecological value, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit.  The success of a project in 1998 involving transplanting bulrush adjacent to the DNR-owned access on the east end of the lake was limited.      A cooperative walleye spawning habitat improvement project between the West Battle Lake Association and DNR-Fisheries was conducted in the fall of 1999.  Rock/rubble was added to Gizzard Creek (inlet from Clitherall Lake) to enhance existing walleye spawning habitat already there.     A winter creel survey was conducted from December 21, 1999 through February 26, 2000.  Overall angling pressure during this period was 5,898 hours.  Numbers of fish harvested were highest for bluegill, followed by black crappie, yellow perch, northern pike, walleye, and largemouth bass.     An open water creel survey was conducted from May13 through September 11, 2000.  Overall angling pressure during this period was 27, 416 hours.  A similar creel survey conducted in 1983 found 51,771 hours of angling pressure.  Overall walleye harvest rate in 2000 was 0.03 walleye per hour compared to 0.16 walleye per hour in 1983.  Numbers of fish harvested in 2000 was highest for bluegill, followed by rock bass, northern pike largemouth bass, pumpkinseed, walleye, black crappie, and yellow perch.     Walleye is the primary management specie in West Battle Lake.  The current walleye gill net catch rate of 6.7 fish per net is the highest recorded since the 1983 survey.  Mean length and weight of walleye sampled in 2001 was 16.2 inches and 1.5 pounds.     Various walleye stocking strategies have been utilized in the past in an attempt to increase walleye abundance.  Records show that walleye fingerlings were stocked in the early 1980's.  In 1987 and 1988, high density walleye fry  stockings (7.9 and 7.0 million) had some success in establishing viable year classes.  The amount of walleye fry stocked was reduced to 2.5 million in 1990 and 1992.  Due to poor success of these fry stockings, walleye abundance declined during succeeding years.  In 1994, after determining that the 2.5 million fry stocking regime was unsuccessful, about 41,500 surplus walleye fingerlings were stocked in West Battle Lake. The 1995 lake survey showed signs that this stocking may have been successful.  The walleye stocking plan was revised in 1996 to incorporate annual  high density (7.5 million) walleye fry stockings.  High density walleye fry stockings occurred in 1996, 1997, and 1998.  Using data from the 1998 lake survey and fall electrofishing assessment, the walleye stocking plan was again revised to begin stocking walleye fingerlings (2,500 pounds).  Walleye fingerlings, yearlings and adults were stocked in 1998 and 1999.  The 1999 management plan recommended stocking 2,500 pounds of walleye fingerlings biennially. In 2001, due to available surplus walleye, 3,777 pounds of walleye fingerlings were stocked in West Battle Lake.     West Battle Lake also contains good populations of other game fish such as northern pike, black crappie, largemouth bass, bluegill, and muskellunge.  Adequate spawning habitat is available for most of these species.       West Battle is a designated muskellunge lake and dark house spearing is prohibited.  Muskellunge are stocked biennially.  A spring trap net assessment in 2000 sampled 48 muskellunge, ranging in length from 23.0 to 48.0 inches.  Data showed that 94% of the fish corresponded to stocked years, indicating that stocking is currently needed to maintain and/or improve the muskellunge population.      Anglers can maintain or improve the quality of fishing for all species of fish in West Battle Lake by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large-size fish while allowing the harvest of the more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with opportunities to catch more large fish in the future.</p>",
