Two northern pike were represented in the gill net sample in this survey and none in the 1984 survey.  Average weight of northern pike was 3.7 lbs.  <br> \n     Yellow bullhead abundance declined from 40.0 per gill net lift in 1984 to 6.5, which is still three times the area median. Abundance of other rough fish species remains low.  <br> \n     Bluegill abundance increased slightly from 17.6 per trap net lift in 1984 to 22.0, but remain below the area median. Bluegill catch per trap net lift has increased steadily over time. The size structure of the bluegill population appears to be improving as 13% of the bluegill measured were greater than 7.0 inches in length compare to 3% in 1984.  <br> \n     Yellow perch abundance declined from 56.0 per gill net lift in 1984 to 13.8, which is near the area median. <br> \n     Walleye abundance declined from 20.3 per gill net lift in 1984 to 11.0, which is nearly twice the area median.  Average weight of walleye was 1.1 lbs. compared to 1.5 lbs. in 1984.   <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>     Jewett Lake is a 737-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located in west-central Otter Tail County approximately eight miles north of Fergus Falls, MN.  Jewett Lake is located within the Otter Tail River Watershed; however, there are no inlets or outlets connected to the lake.  The immediate watershed is composed primarily of agricultural land interspersed with hardwood woodlots.  The maximum depth of Jewett Lake is 75 feet; however, 36% of the lake is less than 15 feet in depth.  The secchi disk reading during the 2011 lake survey was 7.3 feet.  Previous secchi disk readings have ranged from 8.5 to 14.4 feet.     <br> \n     The north and east shorelines of Jewett Lake have been extensively developed.  Homes and cottages compose the majority of the development.  A DNR owned concrete public access is located off of the township road along the north shoreline of the lake.  The shoal water substrates consist primarily of sand and gravel.  Large stands of hardstem bulrush and common cattail are located along the southwest and southeast shorelines.  Emergent aquatic plants such as bulrush and cattail provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat, and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish such as northern pike, largemouth bass, and panfish.  They also serve as important nursery areas for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit.  To maintain the excellent water quality and angling that this lake has to offer, it is imperative to preserve the quality of the aquatic habitat.   <br> \n     A large area of hardstem bulrush and common cattail along the southwest shoreline is posted annually as a largemouth bass spawning area.  Restrictions imposed in this area prohibit fishing or motor boating from ice-out to June 30th, inclusive.  Suitable spawning habitat for largemouth bass, bluegill, and black crappie in Jewett Lake is primarily limited to this posted spawning area.   <br> \n     Jewett Lake is a popular angling lake during both the open water and ice fishing seasons.  Species most sought after include walleye, largemouth bass, black crappie, and bluegill.  Data from recent lake surveys indicate that these species are abundant and have good size distributions as well. <br> \n     Walleye is a primary management specie in this lake.  Walleyes ranged in length from 8.4 to 25.3 inches with an average length and weight of 16.4 inches and 1.7 pounds.  The 2008 year class appears to be strong and should provide good walleye angling for several years.  Walleyes attain an average length of 15.1 inches at four years of age.    <br> \n     Jewett Lake is a popular lake for largemouth bass angling.  Data from recent electrofishing assessments indicate that an excellent largemouth bass population exists.  In the 2011 assessment, bass ranged in length from 12.4 to 19.6 inches with an average length and weight of 15.7 inches and 2.2 pounds.  Age data indicate that largemouth bass reproduction is consistently good.  Bass attain an average length of 14.3 inches at five years of age.   <br> \n     A size regulation for largemouth bass was implemented in 2005.  The regulation is a 12-inch maximum length limit with one over 20.0 inches.  The regulation was implemented in an attempt to maintain the existing size structure.  The regulation will be in effect for ten years (2015).       <br> \n     Black crappie abundance has remained stable in recent surveys.  Seventy-five percent of the crappies were 10.0 inches or greater in length.  Black crappies attain an average length of 10.2 inches at five years of age. <br> \n     Bluegill abundance and size structure has fluctuated in the recent series of surveys.  Age data indicate this is due to inconsistent reproduction which results in variable year class strength.  Seventeen percent of the bluegill trap net sample was 7.0 inches or greater in length.  Bluegills attain an average length of 7.8 inches at seven years of age. <br> \n     Anglers can maintain the quality of angling by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large-size fish while allowing the harvest of the more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future.         <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Jewett Lake is a 737-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located in west-central Otter Tail County approximately eight miles north of Fergus Falls, MN.   Jewett Lake is located within the Otter Tail River Watershed; however, there are no inlets or outlets connected to the lake.  The immediate watershed is composed primarily of agricultural land interspersed with hardwood woodlots.  The maximum depth of Jewett Lake is 75 feet; however, 36% of the lake is less than 15 feet in depth.  The secchi disk reading during the 2005 lake survey was 8.5 feet, which indicates good water clarity.  Previous secchi disk readings have ranged from 8.5 to 12.3 feet.  Jewett Lake is included in class 27 of the Minnesota DNR lake classification scheme.       The north and east shorelines of Jewett Lake have been extensively developed.  Homes and cottages compose the majority of the development.  A DNR owned concrete public access is located off of the township road along the north shoreline of the lake.  The shoal water substrates consist primarily of sand and gravel.  Large stands of hardstem bulrush and common cattail are located along the south, west, and southeast shorelines.  Emergent aquatic plants such as bulrush and cattail provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat, and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lakebottoms, and can actually absorb and break down polluting chemicals.  Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish such as northern pike, largemouth bass, and panfish.  They also serve as important nursery areas for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit.  To maintain the excellent water quality and angling that this lake has to offer, it is imperative to preserve the quality of the aquatic habitat.       A large area of hardstem bulrush and common cattail along the southwest shoreline is posted annually as a largemouth bass spawning area.  Restrictions imposed in this area prohibit fishing or motor boating from ice-out to June 30, inclusive.  Suitable spawning habitat for largemouth bass, bluegill, and black crappie in Jewett Lake is primarily limited to this posted spawning area.       Jewett Lake is a popular angling lake during both the open water and ice fishing seasons.  Species most sought after include walleye, largemouth bass, and bluegill.  Data from recent lake surveys indicate that these species are abundant and have good size distributions as well.     Walleye is a primary management specie in this lake.  The test-net catch rate of walleye exceeded the upper limit of the normal range for lake class 27.  Walleye ranged in length from 7.4 to 25.6 inches with an average length and weight of 14.1 inches and 1.3 pounds.  Data from recent test-netting assessments indicate that walleye natural reproduction is very limited and that walleye fingerling stocking is maintaining the population. The 2004 year class appears to be strong and should provide good walleye angling for several years.  Walleye attain an average length of 15.8 inches at four years of age.  Growth rate estimates are faster than average walleye growth rates for class 27 lakes in the Fergus Falls Management Area.      Jewett Lake is a popular lake for largemouth bass angling.  Data from recent lake surveys and  electrofishing assessments indicate that an excellent largemouth bass population exists.  Age data indicate that largemouth bass recruitment is consistent.  Bass attain an average length of 11.8 inches at four years of age.  Growth rate estimates are equivalent to average largemouth bass growth rates for class 27 lakes in the Fergus Falls Management Area.      A size regulation for largemouth bass was implemented in 2005.  The regulation is a 12-inch maximum length limit with one over 20.0 inches allowed in possession.  The regulation was implemented in an attempt to maintain the existing size structure.  The regulation will be in effect for ten years (2015).           Bluegill test-net catch rates have fluctuated in the recent series of surveys; however, the catch rate in this survey was within the normal range for class 27 lakes.  Seventeen percent of the bluegill trap net sample was at least 7.0 inches in length.  Bluegills attain an average length of 6.6 inches at seven years of age which is slower than average bluegill growth rates for class 27 lakes in the Fergus Falls Management Area.     The DNR does not stock any fish species other than walleye in Jewett Lake.  The other species present are able to sustain their levels at or above management goals without stocking.  This is an indication of the quality of the aquatic habitat that is available.  To maintain the excellent angling this lake presently has to offer, it is imperative to preserve the existing quality of the aquatic habitat.       Anglers can also maintain the quality of angling by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large-size fish while allowing the harvest of the more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future.        </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Jewett Lake is a 737-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located in west-central Otter Tail County approximately eight miles north of Fergus Falls, MN.   Jewett Lake is located within the Otter Tail River Watershed; however, there are no inlets or outlets connected to the lake.  The immediate watershed is composed primarily of agricultural land interspersed with hardwood woodlots.  The maximum depth of Jewett Lake is 75 feet; however, 36% of the lake is less than 15 feet in depth.  The secchi disk reading during the 2002 lake survey was 9.0 feet which indicates good water clarity.  Previous secchi disk readings have ranged from 8.5 to 12.3 feet.  Jewett Lake is included in lake class 27 of the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources' (DNR) lake classification scheme.  Jewett Lake is in the DNR's Fergus Falls Fish Management Area.     The north and east shorelines of Jewett Lake have been extensively developed.  Homes, cottages, and resorts compose the majority of the development.  A DNR owned concrete public access is located off of the township road along the north shoreline of the lake.  The shoal water substrates consist primarily of sand and gravel.  Large stands of hardstem bulrush and common cattail are located along the south, west, and southeast shorelines.  Emergent aquatic plants such as bulrush and cattail provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat, and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms, and can actually absorb and break down polluting chemicals.  Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish such as northern pike, largemouth bass, and panfish.  They also serve as important nursery areas for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit.  To maintain the excellent water quality and angling that this lake has to offer, it is imperative to preserve the quality of the aquatic habitat.       A large area of hardstem bulrush and common cattail along the southwest shoreline is posted annually as a largemouth bass spawning area.  Restrictions imposed in this area prohibit fishing or motor boating from ice-out to June 30, inclusive.  Suitable spawning habitat for largemouth bass, bluegill, and black crappie in Jewett Lake is primarily limited to this posted spawning area.       Jewett Lake is a popular angling lake during both the open water and ice fishing seasons.  Species most sought after include walleye, largemouth bass, and bluegill.  Data from recent lake surveys indicate that these species are abundant and have good size distributions as well.     Walleye is a primary management specie in this lake.  The test-net catch rate of walleye was near the upper limit of the normal range for lake class 27.  Walleye ranged in length from 8.8 to 27.8 inches with an average length and weight of 16.6 inches and 1.9 pounds.  The 1996 and 2000 year classes appear to be strong and should provide good walleye angling for several years.  Walleye attain an average length of 14.8 inches at four years of age.  Growth rate estimates are equivalent to mean walleye growth rates for class 27 lakes in the Fergus Falls Management Area.   Data from recent test-netting assessments indicate that walleye natural reproduction is very limited in Jewett Lake and that walleye stocking is maintaining the population.  A series of walleye fingerling and fry stockings have been evaluated in recent surveys.  Age and catch data indicate that fingerling stocking has produced larger year classes than fry stocking.  Based on this data and historical stocking information, a biennial fingerling stocking sequence at an increased rate, two pounds per littoral acre instead of one pound, was initiated in 2000.  This stocking regime will be evaluated in future lake surveys to determine if it can increase walleye abundance to management goals.     Jewett Lake is a popular lake for largemouth bass angling.  Data from recent lake surveys and an electrofishing assessment indicate that a balanced largemouth bass population exists.  Bass sampled in the 2002 lake survey ranged in length from 5.1 to 16.8 inches.  A creel survey conducted in 1986 indicated that angler catch rates for largemouth bass were excellent.  Also, angler reports on largemouth bass fishing have been very positive.     Bluegill test-net catch rates have fluctuated in the recent series of surveys; however, the catch rate in this survey was within the normal range for class 27 lakes.  Fifteen percent of the bluegill trap net sample was at least 7.0 inches in length.  Bluegills attain an average length of 6.4 inches at seven years of age which is slower than mean bluegill growth for class 27 lakes in the Fergus Falls Management Area.     The DNR does not stock any fish species other than walleye in Jewett Lake.  The other species present are able to sustain their levels at or above management goals without stocking.  This is an indication of the quality of the aquatic habitat that is available.  To maintain the excellent angling this lake presently has to offer, it is imperative to preserve the existing quality of the aquatic habitat.       Anglers can also maintain the quality of angling by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large-size fish while allowing the harvest of the more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future.        </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>     Jewett Lake is a 737-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located in west-central Otter Tail County approximately eight miles north of Fergus Falls, MN.  Jewett Lake is located within the Otter Tail River Watershed; however, there are no inlets or outlets connected to the lake.  The immediate watershed is composed primarily of agricultural land interspersed with hardwood woodlots.  The maximum depth of Jewett Lake is 75 feet; however, 36% of the lake is less than 15 feet in depth.  The secchi disk reading during the 2014 lake survey was 6.2 feet.  Previous secchi disk readings have ranged from 7.1 to 14.4 feet.     <br> \n     The north and east shorelines of Jewett Lake have been extensively developed.  Homes and cottages compose the majority of the development.  A DNR owned concrete public access is located off of the township road along the north shoreline of the lake.  The shoal water substrates consist primarily of sand and gravel.  Large stands of hardstem bulrush and common cattail are located along the southwest and southeast shorelines.  Emergent aquatic plants such as bulrush and cattail provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat, and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish such as Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, and panfish.  They also serve as important nursery areas for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit.  To maintain the excellent water quality and angling that this lake has to offer, it is imperative to preserve the quality of the aquatic habitat.   <br> \n     A large area of hardstem bulrush and common cattail along the southwest shoreline is posted annually as a Largemouth Bass spawning area.  Restrictions imposed in this area prohibit fishing or motor boating from ice-out to June 30th, inclusive.  Suitable spawning habitat for Largemouth Bass, Bluegill, and Black Crappie in Jewett Lake is primarily limited to this posted spawning area.   <br> \n     Jewett Lake is a popular angling lake during both the open water and ice fishing seasons.  Species most sought after include Walleye, Largemouth Bass, Black Crappie, and Bluegill.  Data from recent lake surveys indicate that these species are abundant and have good size distributions as well. <br> \n     Walleye is a primary management specie in this lake.  Walleyes ranged in length from 7.6 to 26.9 inches with an average length and weight of 16.1 inches and 1.7 pounds.  The 20012 year class appears to be strong and should provide good Walleye angling for several years.  Walleyes attain an average length of 15.6 inches at four years of age.    <br> \n     Jewett Lake is a popular lake for Largemouth Bass angling.  Data from recent electrofishing assessments indicate that an excellent Largemouth Bass population exists.  In the 2014 assessment, bass ranged in length from 10.9 to 18.5 inches with an average length and weight of 15.7 inches and 2.2 pounds.  Age data indicate that Largemouth Bass reproduction is consistently good.  Bass attain an average length of 14.0 inches at five years of age.   <br> \n     Black Crappie abundance has remained stable in recent surveys.  Eighty-nine percent of the crappies were 10.0 inches or greater in length.  Black Crappies attain an average length of 9.3 inches at four years of age. <br> \n     Bluegill abundance and size structure has fluctuated in the recent series of surveys.  Age data indicate this is due to inconsistent reproduction which results in variable year class strength.  Twenty-two percent of the Bluegill trap net sample was 7.0 inches or greater in length.  Bluegills attain an average length of 7.1 inches at six years of age. <br> \n     Anglers can maintain the quality of angling by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large-size fish while allowing the harvest of the more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future.         <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Jewett Lake is located in west-central Otter Tail County approximately eight miles north of Fergus Falls, MN.  Jewett Lake is a 737-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake that is located within the Otter Tail River Watershed.  There are no inlets or outlets connected to Jewett Lake.  The immediate watershed is composed primarily of agricultural land interspersed with hardwood woodlots.  The maximum depth of Jewett Lake is 75 feet; however, 36% of the lake is less than 15 feet in depth.  The secchi disk reading during the 1999 lake survey was 9.0 feet which indicates good water clarity.  Previous secchi disk readings have ranged from 8.5 to 12.3 feet.  Benchmark information indicated that the water level at the time of the survey was above the ordinary high water mark.  A drainage pipe was installed during the fall of 1999 in an attempt to lower the water level of Jewett Lake.  Water above the ordinary high water mark will be drained into Long Lake which is located to the north of Jewett Lake.  The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different lake classes based on physical and chemical characteristics of the lakes.  Jewett Lake is included in lake class 27 of this classification scheme.  Jewett Lake is located within the DNR's Fergus Falls Management Area.     The north and east shorelines of Jewett Lake have been extensively developed.  Homes, cottages, and resorts compose the majority of the development.  A DNR owned concrete public access is located off of the township road along the north shoreline of the lake.  The shoal water substrates consist primarily of sand and gravel.  Large stands of hardstem bulrush and common cattail are located along the south, west, and southeast shorelines.  Emergent aquatic plants such as bulrush and cattail provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat, and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms, and can actually absorb and break down polluting chemicals.  Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish such as northern pike, largemouth bass, and panfish.  They also serve as important nursery areas for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit.  To maintain the excellent water quality and angling that this lake has to offer, it is imperative to preserve the quality of the aquatic habitat.       A large area of hardstem bulrush along the southwest shoreline is posted annually as a largemouth bass spawning area.  Restrictions imposed in this area prohibit fishing or motor boating from ice-out to June 30, inclusive.  Suitable spawning habitat for largemouth bass, bluegill, and black crappie in Jewett Lake is primarily limited to this posted spawning area.     Jewett Lake is a popular angling lake during both the open water and ice fishing seasons.  Species most sought after include walleye, largemouth bass, and bluegill.  Data from recent lake surveys indicate that these species are abundant and have good size distributions as well.     Walleye is a primary management specie in this lake.  The test-net catch rate of walleye (8.4)  was near the upper limit of the normal range for lakes in class 27.  Walleye ranged in length from 8.7 to 27.0 inches with an average length and weight of 17.4 inches and 2.0 pounds.  The 1996 year class appears to be strong and should provide good walleye angling for several years.  Walleye attain an average length of 14.7 inches at four years of age.  Walleye growth rate estimates are equivalent to mean growth rates for walleye in class 27 lakes in the Fergus Falls Management Area.      Data from recent test-netting assessments indicate that walleye natural reproduction is very limited in Jewett Lake and that walleye stocking is maintaining the population.  A series of walleye fingerling and fry stockings have been evaluated in recent surveys.  Age and catch data indicate that fingerling stocking has produced larger year classes than fry stocking.  Based on this data and historical stocking information, a biennial fingerling stocking sequence at an increased rate, two pounds per littoral acre instead of one pound, will be initiated in 2000 and will be evaluated in future lake surveys to determine if this stocking regime can maintain the walleye population at management goals.     Jewett Lake is a popular lake for largemouth bass angling.  Data from recent lake surveys and an electrofishing assessment indicate that a balanced largemouth bass population exists.  Bass sampled in the 1996 electrofishing assessment ranged in length from 5.7 to 19.4 inches.  A creel survey conducted in 1986 indicated that angler catch rates for largemouth bass were excellent.  Also, angler reports on largemouth bass fishing have been very positive.     Bluegill test-net catch rates have fluctuated in the recent series of surveys; however, the catch rate in this survey was within the normal range for class 27 lakes.  Fourteen percent of the bluegill sample was at least 7.0 inches in length.  Bluegills attain an average length of 6.9 inches at eight years of age which is at the lower limit of the normal range of growth for class 27 lakes.     The DNR does not stock any fish species other than walleye in Jewett Lake.  The other species present are able to sustain their levels at or above management goals without stocking.  This is an indication of the quality of the fish habitat that is available.  To maintain the excellent fishing this lake presently has to offer, it is imperative to preserve the existing quality of the fish habitat.       Anglers can also maintain the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large-size fish while allowing the harvest of the more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future.        </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>    Jewett Lake is a 737-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located in west-central Otter Tail County approximately eight miles north of Fergus Falls, MN.  Jewett Lake is located within the Otter Tail River Watershed; however, there are no inlets or outlets connected to the lake.  The immediate watershed is composed primarily of agricultural land interspersed with hardwood woodlots.  The maximum depth of Jewett Lake is 75 feet; however, 36% of the lake is less than 15 feet in depth.  The secchi disk reading during the 2018 survey was 10.0 feet.  Previous secchi disk readings have ranged from 7.1 to 14.4 feet.     <br> \n     The north and east shorelines of Jewett Lake have been extensively developed.  Homes and cottages compose the majority of the development.  A DNR owned concrete public access is located off of the township road along the north shoreline of the lake.  The shoal water substrates consist primarily of sand and gravel.  Large stands of hardstem bulrush and common cattail are located along the southwest and southeast shorelines.  Emergent aquatic plants such as bulrush and cattail provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat, and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish such as Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, and panfish.  They also serve as important nursery areas for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit.  To maintain the excellent water quality and angling that this lake has to offer, it is imperative to preserve the quality of the aquatic habitat.   <br> \n     A large area of hardstem bulrush and common cattail along the southwest shoreline is posted annually as a Largemouth Bass spawning area.  Restrictions imposed in this area prohibit fishing or motor boating from ice-out to June 30th, inclusive.  Suitable spawning habitat for Largemouth Bass, Bluegill, and Black Crappie in Jewett Lake is primarily limited to this posted spawning area.   <br> \n     Jewett Lake can be ecologically classified as a bass-panfish-Walleye type of lake and this is reflected in the assemblage of the fish community.  Walleye, Largemouth Bass, and Bluegill are the dominant gamefish species present. <br> \n     Walleyes have consistently been abundant.  Walleyes ranged in length from 8.4 to 26.8 inches with an average length and weight of 16.2 inches and 1.6 pounds.  Walleyes attain an average length of 14.7 inches at four years of age.    <br> \n     Data from a spring electrofishing assessment indicate that a balanced Largemouth Bass population exists.  Bass ranged in length from 7.6 to 18.5 inches with an average length and weight of 14.8 inches and 1.9 pounds.  Age data indicate that Largemouth Bass reproduction is consistently good.  Bass attain an average length of 14.3 inches at five years of age.   <br> \n     Bluegill abundance and size structure have historically fluctuated.  Bluegill abundance was within the normal range and sixty-three percent of the Bluegill sample was 7.0 inches or greater in length.  Bluegills attain an average length of 7.4 inches at six years of age. <br> \n     Anglers can maintain the quality of angling by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large-size fish while allowing the harvest of the more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future. <br> \n     Jewett Lake was listed as infested with zebra mussels in 2018.  Aquatic invasive species are threatening Minnesota waters.  Aquatic invasive species can potentially harm water quality, water recreation, aquatic habitat, native species, and fish populations.  Anglers can help prevent the introduction and spread of invasive species by following watercraft transportation laws.      <br> \n <br> \n         <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>     Jewett Lake is a 737-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located in west-central Otter Tail County approximately eight miles north of Fergus Falls, MN.  Jewett Lake is located within the Otter Tail River Watershed; however, there are no inlets or outlets connected to the lake.  The immediate watershed is composed primarily of agricultural land interspersed with hardwood woodlots.  The maximum depth of Jewett Lake is 75 feet; however, 36% of the lake is less than 15 feet in depth.  The secchi disk reading during the 2008 lake survey was 14.4 feet, which indicates good water clarity.  Previous secchi disk readings have ranged from 8.5 to 12.3 feet.     <br> \n     The north and east shorelines of Jewett Lake have been extensively developed.  Homes and cottages compose the majority of the development.  A DNR owned concrete public access is located off of the township road along the north shoreline of the lake.  The shoal water substrates consist primarily of sand and gravel.  Large stands of hardstem bulrush and common cattail are located along the southwest and southeast shorelines.  Emergent aquatic plants such as bulrush and cattail provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat, and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish such as northern pike, largemouth bass, and panfish.  They also serve as important nursery areas for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit.  To maintain the excellent water quality and angling that this lake has to offer, it is imperative to preserve the quality of the aquatic habitat.   <br> \n     A large area of hardstem bulrush and common cattail along the southwest shoreline is posted annually as a largemouth bass spawning area.  Restrictions imposed in this area prohibit fishing or motor boating from ice-out to June 30, inclusive.  Suitable spawning habitat for largemouth bass, bluegill, and black crappie in Jewett Lake is primarily limited to this posted spawning area.   <br> \n     Jewett Lake is a popular angling lake during both the open water and ice fishing seasons.  Species most sought after include walleye, largemouth bass, and bluegill.  Data from recent lake surveys indicate that these species are abundant and have good size distributions as well. <br> \n     Walleye is a primary management specie in this lake.  The test-net catch rate of walleye was within the normal range for this class of lake.  Walleye ranged in length from 8.9 to 25.0 inches with an average length and weight of 14.2 inches and 1.0 pounds.  The 2004 year class appears to be strong and should provide good walleye angling for several years.  Walleye attain an average length of 14.1 inches at four years of age.    <br> \n     Jewett Lake is a popular lake for largemouth bass angling.  Data from recent electrofishing assessments indicate that an excellent largemouth bass population exists.  In the 2008 assessment, bass ranged in length from 10.3 to 19.5 inches with an average length and weight of 15.9 inches and 2.3 pounds.  Age data indicate that largemouth bass reproduction is consistent.  Bass attain an average length of 13.1 inches at four years of age.   <br> \n     A size regulation for largemouth bass was implemented in 2005.  The regulation is a 12-inch maximum length limit with 1 over 20.0 inches.  The regulation was implemented in an attempt to maintain the existing size structure.  The regulation will be in effect for ten years (2015).       <br> \n     Bluegill test-net catch rates have fluctuated in the recent series of surveys; however, the catch rate in this survey was within the normal range.  Bluegill size structure has improved compared to recent surveys; Forty-four percent of the bluegill trap net sample was at least 7.0 inches in length.  Bluegills attain an average length of 7.3 inches at seven years of age. <br> \n     Anglers can maintain the quality of angling by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large-size fish while allowing the harvest of the more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future.         <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>     Jewett Lake is a 737-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located in west-central Otter Tail County approximately eight miles north of Fergus Falls, MN.  Jewett Lake is located within the Otter Tail River Watershed; however, there are no natural inlets or outlets connected to the lake.  The immediate watershed is composed primarily of agricultural land interspersed with hardwood woodlots.  The maximum depth of Jewett Lake is 75 feet; however, 36% of the lake is less than 15 feet in depth.  The secchi disk reading during the 2022 survey was 22.1 feet.  Previous secchi disk readings ranged from 7.1 to 14.4 feet.     <br> \n     The north and east shorelines of Jewett Lake have been extensively developed.  Homes and cottages compose the majority of the development.  A DNR owned concrete public access is located off of the township road along the north shoreline of the lake.  The shoal water substrates consist primarily of sand and gravel.  Large stands of hardstem bulrush and common cattail are located along the southwest and southeast shorelines.  Emergent aquatic plants such as bulrush and cattail provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat, and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish such as Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, and panfish.  They also serve as important nursery areas for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit.  To maintain the excellent water quality and angling that this lake has to offer, it is imperative to preserve the quality of the aquatic habitat.   <br> \n     A large area of hardstem bulrush and common cattail along the southwest shoreline is posted annually as a Largemouth Bass spawning area.  A majority of this area is located immediately adjacent to an Aquatic Management Area.  Restrictions imposed in the spawning area prohibit fishing or motor boating from ice-out to June 30th, inclusive.  Suitable spawning habitat for Largemouth Bass, Bluegill, and Black Crappie in Jewett Lake is primarily limited to this posted spawning area.     <br> \n     Jewett Lake can be ecologically classified as a bass-panfish-Walleye type of lake and this is reflected in the assemblage of the fish community.  Walleye, Largemouth Bass, and Bluegill are the dominant gamefish species present. <br> \n     Walleyes have historically remained very abundant.  Walleyes ranged in length from 8.9 to 23.4 inches with an average length and weight of 17.0 inches and 1.7 pounds.  Walleyes attain an average length of 15.4 inches at four years of age.    <br> \n     Data from a spring electrofishing assessment indicate that a balanced Largemouth Bass population exists.  Age data indicate that Largemouth Bass reproduction is consistently good.  Largemouth Bass ranged in length from 9.1 to 17.8 inches with an average length and weight of 14.1 inches and 1.6 pounds.  Bass attain an average length of 13.3 inches at five years of age.   <br> \n     Bluegill abundance and size structure have historically fluctuated.  Bluegill abundance is presently at a moderate density.  Nineteen percent of the Bluegill sample was 7.0 inches or greater in length.  Bluegills attain an average length of 7.1 inches at seven years of age. <br> \n     Anglers can maintain the quality of angling by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large-size fish while allowing the harvest of the more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future. <br> \n     Jewett Lake was listed as infested with zebra mussels in 2018.  Aquatic invasive species are threatening Minnesota waters.  Aquatic invasive species can potentially harm water quality, water recreation, aquatic habitat, native species, and fish populations.  Anglers can help prevent the introduction and spread of invasive species by following watercraft transportation laws.  <br> \n</p>",
