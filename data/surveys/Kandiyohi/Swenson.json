                "narrative": "<p>Swenson is a small, shallow, productive, and aerated lake located in Kandiyohi County.Algae blooms are a frequent occurrence during the mid-late summer months. Water clarity wasexcellent on June 16, 1998. Submergent vegetation densities were generally low. Sago pondweedand coontail were the two most frequently occurring submergents. Hardstem bulrush was themost frequently occurring emergent vegetation species. The shoal water substrates consistedmostly of sand and gravel. Swenson is managed primarily for walleye. Walleye naturalreproduction in Swenson is absent or minimal during most years. DNR Spicer Fisheriespersonnel generally stock walleye every odd year. Swenson was last stocked with 121,431walleye fry in 1997. Young of year \"YOY\" walleye numbers from fry stocked years have been lowin recent fall night electrofishing surveys.     Walleye abundance in the 1998 gillnets (1.00 fish/gillnet) was below the normal range(2.28 - 18.06 fish/gillnet) for similar lakes, and below the Swenson historical gillnetaverage (14.75 fish/gillnet). The 1998 walleye average length was 16.3 inches (gillnets andtrapnets combined) which was slightly above the Swenson historical average (15.7 inches). The1995 walleye year class accounted for 40% of the 1998 walleye net catch. Walleye growth rateswere good in Swenson compared to other local lakes.     Northern pike were abundant in 1998 (8.67 fish/gillnet) compared to the Swensonhistorical average (6.83 fish/gillnet). The 1998 northern pike average weight (2.49 lbs.,gillnets) was above the Swenson historical average (1.80 lbs.). The largest northern pikecaptured in the 1998 survey was 32.1 inches. The 1996 northern pike year class comprised 46%of the 1998 gillnet and trapnet catch. Northern pike growth rates were average compared toother local lakes.     Both bluegill (2.90 fish/trapnet) and black crappie numbers (2.00 fish/gillnet) weredown in 1998 compared to the Swenson historical bluegill (9.93 fish/trapnet) and blackcrappie (6.67 fish/gillnet) averages. The trapnet average lengths were 6.4 inches forbluegill and 7.2 inches for black crappie. Bluegill exhibit excellent growth rates inSwenson.     Important forage fish for walleye such as yellow perch (33.67 fish/gillnet) and blackbullhead (494.10 fish/trapnet) were abundant in the 1998 survey nets. The yellow perchaverage length was 7.6 inches. The black bullhead average size was 8.5 inches from thetrapnets. Carp abundance in 1998 (1.60 fish/trapnet) was below the Swenson historicalaverage, but the carp average length in 1998 (25.3 inches) was above the historical average(13.2 inches).     The Swenson fishery presently has an abundance of forage fish (black bullhead, yellowperch). Predator fish such as northern pike are abundant, but walleye are presently low.Walleye fry will be stocked in the 1999 spring and will be evaluated in the 1999 fall bynight electrofishing. If YOY walleye numbers are low in the 1999 fall, Swenson will bestocked with walleye fry in 2000. Swenson will be surveyed by summer test nets every fouryears and by YOY walleye fall night electrofishing after each preceding spring walleye frystocking in order to evaluate the effectiveness of management practices. The DNR SpicerFisheries Office will try to work with local landowners in the watershed to implement bestmanagement practices in order to improve the water quality.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A standard survey was conducted during mid-June of 2015 in Swenson Lake. Swenson is a small sized (108 acres), shallow (14 feet maximum depth), aerated, and productive lake located in Kandiyohi County. The surrounding watershed is comprised mostly of agricultural row crops with small areas of woodland and wetland areas. The immediate shoreline area consists mostly of undeveloped woodlands (hardwood trees) with small areas of wetlands, row crops, and residential homes. Agricultural row crop runoff (via inlets) is the primary source of nutrient pollution into Swenson. Nutrient levels were high during 2015. There are three small to moderate sized inlets (north, west, and south shores) that flow thru wetland areas into Swenson. The outlet connects to Shakopee Creek. Water levels were below normal during the spring and fall, but normal in the summer of 2015. Water clarity (secchi reading) was good (7.0 feet) during June, but poor (1.7 feet) by early August of 2015. Blue-green algae blooms are common and intense during the mid-summer months in Swenson Lake. Submergent vegetation was limited to water moss in 2015. Other aquatic vegetation species present included sago pondweed and filamentous algae during past surveys. Emergent vegetation consists mainly of bulrush and cattail species scattered throughout the shoreline areas. Swenson Lake is managed for Walleye, Northern Pike, Black Crappie, Yellow Perch, Largemouth Bass and Bluegill. Swenson has been a popular winter fishery for Black Crappie numbers, but the average size had been small in recent years. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike numbers were low in 2015 (1.50 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range and Swenson historical average (5.63 fish/gillnet). The 2015 Northern Pike average size was large (6.15 pounds and 27.9 inches) from gillnets. The Northern Pike historical average weight is 3.65 pounds from gillnets. There were two Northern Pike over 33.0 inches captured in the gillnet sets. Although Northern Pike numbers are historically variable in Swenson, growth rates have been excellent and large fish over 30.0 inches were frequently sampled in survey nets since 2001. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie numbers were low in 2015 (1.30 fish/trapnet) as compared to the previous 2010 survey (210.20 fish/trapnet, 7.7 inches average) and historical average (33.10 fish/trapnet). The 2015 Black Crappie size was moderate (0.41 pounds and 8.7 inches) from trapnets. The 2011 year class comprised 53% of the 2015 Black Crappie survey catch. Black Crappie growth rates improved due in part to lower population numbers compared to the previous 2010 survey.  <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie sizes were unchanging (8-9 inches) and growth rates appeared stunted based on June trapnetting from 2010-2013. The nature of boom and bust Black Crappie populations and subsequent stunting due to depletion of the forage base during boom years is not uncommon in smaller lakes. Overly abundant and stunted Black Crappie populations may be more susceptible to die offs due to stressful winter conditions, low dissolved summer oxygen conditions, or disease outbreaks (i.e. 2012 columnaris event in nearby East Solomon) especially during above average water temperatures. No Black Crappie die offs were reported during recent winter or summer months for Swenson, however smaller fish species like Black Crappie are not readily observable and more apt to stay on the lake bottom after dying during the winter unlike larger species (i.e. Walleye, Common Carp, etc.) which often float to the surface after ice out. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch numbers were low to moderate in 2015 (11.50 fish/gillnet). The Yellow Perch historical average catch rate is 18.29 fish/gillnet for Swenson Lake. The 2015 Yellow Perch average size was moderate (0.21 pounds and 7.7 inches) and similar to the historical average (0.22 pounds) from gillnets. Yellow Perch growth rates were good in Swenson.  <br> \n <br> \nBluegill numbers were moderately abundant in 2015 (8.70 fish/trapnet) and similar to the Swenson historical average (8.35 fish/trapnet). The 2015 Bluegill average size was small (0.15 pounds and 5.8 inches) compared the historical average (0.23 pounds) from trapnets. The 2015 Bluegill survey catch was comprised mostly of younger fish (2013 year class). Bluegill growth rates were excellent in Swenson. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye numbers were moderate to low in 2015 (6.50 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range and Swenson historical average (8.98 fish/gillnet) for Swenson. The 2015 Walleye average size was moderate (1.71 pounds and 17.2 inches) from gillnets. The Walleye historical average weight is 1.60 pounds from gillnets. Most of the Walleye captured in the 2015 survey were between 16.0-18.0 inches and from the 2011 year class (stocked). Walleye natural reproduction in Swenson is generally infrequent and insignificant based on previous fall and summer surveys. Recent Walleye fryling (2.0-3.0 inch size) stockings occurred in 2009 (27,000 fish), 2010 (40,062 fish), 2012 (31,218 fish) and 2014 (31,690 fish). Walleye yearlings (9.0-12.0 inch size) were last stocked in 2012 (565 fish, 226 pounds). Young of year \"YOY\" (fingerling sized) Walleye abundance was high in 2010 (63.00 YOY/hour, 5.9 inches average) and 2014 (210.00 YOY/hour, 6.1 inches), but low in 2012 (9.00 YOY/hour, 6.8 inches average) fall electrofishing surveys. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass numbers were low (12.75 fish/hour) in the 2015 spring electrofishing survey compared to other area lakes, but good for Swenson. The 2015 Largemouth Bass average size was large (2.09 pounds and 15.3 inches) from spring electrofishing. Largemouth Bass growth rates were fair in Swenson. <br> \n <br> \nBlack bullhead numbers were low in 2015 (9.50 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range and Swenson historical average (121.25 fish/trapnet). The 2015 Black Bullhead average size was large (0.93 pounds and 11.7 inches) from gillnets.  <br> \n <br> \nCommon Carp numbers were low in 2015 (0.20 fish/trapnet) compared to the historical average (3.29 fish/trapnet) for Swenson Lake. The 2015 Common Carp average size was moderate (5.81 pounds and 23.0 inches) from trapnets. <br> \n <br> \nCurrent fish management activities on Swenson include monitoring the fish population on a periodic basis, monitoring winter dissolved oxygen levels, protecting aquatic vegetation through the permit process, assisting aquatic plant management and enforcement personnel in educating boaters and monitoring access sites for potential invasive species introductions, participating in local watershed initiatives, and stocking various fish species as warranted. The Swenson fishery will be sampled in the 2019 summer for all fish species and 2016 fall for YOY Walleye abundance. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted fall night electrofishing survey was conducted on Swenson during September 19, 2023 to evaluate young of year \"YOY\" (fingerling sized) Walleye numbers due to a fry stocking. Two stations were sampled for a total of 20 minutes during the 2023 fall electrofishing survey. The water temperature was 72 F. Clarity was less than 1 foot. Blue-green algae bloom was severe. We observed abundant numbers of YOY Bluegill; moderate numbers of adult Bluegill and Walleye; low numbers of Common Carp, Northern Pike and Yellow Perch. A targeted survey is generally used for sampling a specific kind of fish or time of year (i.e., spawning season, fall season, etc.) unlike a standard survey which samples a wider range of fish species during the summer months using standard methodology (i.e., standard time of year, set sampling stations, taking water clarity readings and oxygen/temperature profiles, etc.) and gears (i.e. lake survey gillnets, trapnets and possibly spring electrofishing for Largemouth Bass). <br> \n <br> \nSwenson is a small (108 acres), shallow (14 feet maximum), aerated and productive lake located in Kandiyohi County. A helixor aeration system is operated each winter. A partial winterkill (Walleye, Bigmouth Buffalo and Common Carp) occurred in late February or early March of 2023 due to low oxygen caused by heavy snowfall and prolonged winter into March. Three single frame 1/2 inch bar mesh trapnets were set on May 30, 2023 to assess winterkill in Swenson. We captured a variety of gamefish and non-gamefish species in the 2023 May trapnets.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye natural reproduction in Swenson is generally infrequent and insignificant based on previous surveys and markings. Walleye fry (Spicer Strain) were last stocked into Swenson during 2023 (50,842 fry). Walleye fry were also stocked in 2021 (105,525 Spicer Strain fry) and 2018 (100,000 Pike River Strain fry). Walleye frylings (OTC marked) were stocked into Swenson during 2009 (27,000 Pike/Red River strain fish), 2010 (40,062 Pike River Strain fish), 2012 (31,218 Pike River Strain fish), 2014 (31,690 Pike River Strain fish) and 2016 (27,014 Spicer Strain fish). Walleye fingerlings and yearlings were last stocked into Swenson during 2012 (126 fingerlings, 21 pounds; 565 yearlings, 226 pounds) after the fall electrofishing survey. <br> \n <br> \nYOY Walleye numbers were abundant (117.00/hour, 5.57 inches) in the 2023 fall night electrofishing survey. YOY Walleye numbers were abundant in 2018 (163.33 YOY/hour, 5.49 inches) and 2016 (136.00 YOY/hour, 4.97 inches) fall electrofishing surveys. Oxytetracycline \"OTC\" marked fish accounted for 54.2% of the 2016 Fall YOY Walleye catch. Abundant YOY Walleye numbers (210.00 YOY/hour, 6.12 inches average length) were also captured in the 2014 fall electrofishing survey. YOY Walleye numbers were low (9.00 YOY/hour, 6.77 inches) in 2012. YOY Walleye abundance was high in 2010(63.00 YOY/hour, 5.91 inches), but low in the 2009 (3.00 YOY/hour, 4.69 inches) fall electrofishing survey. All of the YOY Walleye captured in 2010 were OTC marked fish from a 2010 early summer Walleye fryling stocking. No yearling Walleye were caught in 2023, 2018 or 2016. Abundant numbers of age 2 (2021 year class) Walleye (66.00/hour, 13.10 inches) were caught in the 2023 fall electrofishing survey. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance in the 2019 summer survey (5.00 fish/gillnet) was below the historical average catch rate of 8.54 fish/gillnet for Swenson. The 2019 Walleye average weight and length were 2.29 pounds and 18.61 inches from gillnets. The Walleye historical average weight is 1.68 pounds from gillnets. The 2019 catch rate of quality size (15.00 inches and larger) Walleye was 5.00 fish/gillnet. Walleye growth rates were with the Spicer Area normal ranges. The 2016 year class (fryling stocked) comprised 43% of the 2019 Walleye survey catch. <br> \n <br> \nThe Swenson Lake fishery will be surveyed in the 2024 summer for all fish species. Fall electrofishing surveys will be conducted periodically during Walleye fry stocked years to assess the success or failure of the stockings.  <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

All of the YOY walleye captured in 2010 were OTC marked fish from a 2010 early summer walleye fryling stocking (40,062 fish). The Swenson YOY walleye historical catch rate is 43.11 YOY/hour. Walleye fry were last stocked into Swenson during 2004 (109,936 fry). Walleye frylings (OTC marked) have been stocked into Swenson during 2009 (27,000 fish), 2010 (40,062 fish), 2012 (31,218 fish), and 2014 (31,690 fish). Walleye fingerlings and yearlings were last stocked into Swenson in 2012 (126 fingerlings, 21 pounds; 565 yearlings, 226 pounds) after the fall electrofishing survey.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Swenson Lake is a small, shallow, and productive lake located in Kandiyohi County. A bubbler aeration unit has been in operation every winter since 1985 which has greatly enhanced gamefish survival. Black bullhead was the most abundant fish prior to 1988 survey (270.7 fish/gillnet). The black bullhead catch was only 22.6 fish/gillnet in the 1993 survey. Walleye abundance (2.3 fish/gillnet) in 1993 was well below previous surveys (12.7 fish/gillnet in 1983, 43.0 fish/gillnet in 1988). However, 27% of the walleye caught in 1993 trapnets were above 25 inches in length with the largest fish at 29.2 inches (9.2 lbs.). The walleye population is largely a result of stocking. Black crappie abundance (4.5 fish/trapnet) and average size (0.3 lbs.) was the highest recorded, but below normal for similar lakes. Yellow perch abundance has declined from 11.7 fish/gillnet in 1988 to 4.3 fish/gillnet in 1993. Bluegill abundance (19.0 fish/trapnet) and average size (0.3 lbs.) was the highest recorded in 1993. About 77% of the bluegill caught in the 1993 survey were above 7 inches. Anglers seeking bluegill have reported the most success during the spawning period. Northern pike abundance of 1.0 fish/gillnet was below previous surveys of 12.7 fish/gillnet in 1983 and 5.0 fish/gillnet in 1988. Northern pike spawning occurs in the marshes and flooded grasslands upstream of the inlets. In 1993, four young of year northern pike were caught in the trapnets. Anglers have reported catching many small northern pike (<20 inches) during the summer of 1994. Numerous small carp (7-10 inches) were captured in the 1993 survey.      Problems that exist on Swenson include decreasing water quality due to nutrient/sediment inputs, habitat (bulrush) loss due to lakeshore development, and potential habitat degradation from the activity of increased carp numbers. In addition, the forage base (yellow perch, bullhead) for walleye has dramatically declined which may be contributing to the poor survival of recent fry stockings. Numerous fish eating birds (cormorants, pelicans) in the area may also have an effect on fry or forage abundance, but the extent is unknown. Management options include encouraging the formation of a lake association that is active in pursing improved water quality and habitat; educating area landowners (farmers, lakeshore owners) to employ better land use practices (ridge till, buffer strips, proper fertilizer application, proper human and animal sewage disposal); fish population manipulation (adjusting walleye stocking rates, stocking yellow perch for forage); planting hardstem bulrush for more habitat; installing fish barriers at the outlet/inlets where carp immigration into the lake occurs; promoting periodic (once every ten to fifteen years) winterkill by not using the aeration system to lower carp numbers.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A fall night electrofishing survey for young of year \"YOY\" (fingerling sized) Walleye on Swenson during September 20, 2016. The survey was done with a boat set up with electrofishing equipment to evaluate fry stocking success in 2016. The electrofishing equipment puts electricity into the water and fish are attracted to the positive charge in the front of the boat. We then net the fish and take lengths and weights to determine what condition the fish are in (etc.). Swenson is a small (108 acres), shallow (14 feet maximum), aerated and productive lake located in Kandiyohi County. Walleye natural reproduction in Swenson is generally infrequent and insignificant based on previous fall and summer surveys.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye fry were last stocked into Swenson during 2004 (109,936 fry). Walleye frylings (OTC marked) have been stocked into Swenson during 2009 (27,000 Pike/Red River strain fish), 2010 (40,062 Pike River strain fish), 2012 (31,218 Pike River strain fish), 2014 (31,690 Pike River strain fish) and 2016 (27,014 Spicer strain fish). Walleye fingerlings and yearlings were last stocked into Swenson during 2012 (126 fingerlings, 21 pounds; 565 yearlings, 226 pounds) after the fall electrofishing survey. <br> \n <br> \nYOY Walleye numbers were abundant in 2016 (136.0 YOY/hour, 5.0 inches). Oxytetracycline \"OTC\" marked fish accounted for 54% of the 2016 Fall YOY Walleye catch. Abundant YOY Walleye numbers (210.0 YOY/hour, 6.1 inches average length) were also captured in the 2014 fall electrofishing survey. YOY Walleye numbers were low (9.0 YOY/hour, 6.8 inches) in 2012. YOY Walleye abundance was high in 2010(63.0 YOY/hour, 5.9 inches), but low in the 2009 (3.0 YOY/hour, 4.7 inches) fall electrofishing survey. All of the YOY Walleye captured in 2010 were OTC marked fish from a 2010 early summer Walleye fryling stocking. The Swenson YOY Walleye historical catch rate is 51.6 YOY/hour. No yearling Walleye were caught in 2016. <br> \n <br> \nThe Swenson Lake fishery will be surveyed in the 2019 summer for all fish species. Fall electrofishing surveys will be conducted during Walleye fry or fryling stocked years to assess the success or failure of the stockings. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey was conducted on Swenson during late May of 2023 to evaluate the extent of winterkill. Three single frame trapnets (1/2-inch bar measure) were set at standard trapnet locations located along the southeast and southwest portions of the lake. A targeted survey is generally used for sampling a specific kind of fish or time of year (i.e., spawning season, fall season, etc.) unlike a standard survey which samples a wider range of fish species during the summer months using standard methodology (i.e., standard time of year, set sampling stations, taking water clarity readings and oxygen/temperature profiles, etc.) and gears (i.e. lake survey gillnets, trapnets and possibly spring electrofishing for Largemouth Bass). A targeted fall night electrofishing survey for young of year \"YOY\" Walleye was also conducted in the 2023. <br> \n <br> \nSwenson is a small (108 acres), shallow (14 feet maximum), aerated and productive lake located in Kandiyohi County. A helixor aeration system is operated each winter. A partial winterkill (Walleye, Bigmouth Buffalo and Common Carp) occurred in late February or early March of 2023 due to low oxygen caused by heavy snowfall and prolonged winter into March. Prior documented winterkills occurred in 1974, 1978 and 1984. A bubbler aeration system was installed and operated during the 1984-85 winter. Winter oxygen levels were low (near or less than 1 ppm) during the late 1980's winters, 1996-97 winter and 2003-04 winter even with the aeration system running, but no significant winterkills were reported. The 2023-24 winter was mild in temperature with little snow accumulation and thin ice. Dissolved oxygen levels were excellent during the 2023-24 winter which made the use of aeration unnecessary in most area lakes. <br> \n <br> \nWe captured a variety of gamefish and non-gamefish species in the 2023 May trapnets. It appears that gamefish and panfish survived in sufficient numbers. These species included Black Crappie (1.67 fish/trapnet), Bluegill (4.67 fish/trapnet), Northern Pike (0.33 fish/trapnet), Walleye (3.67 fish/trapnet) and Yellow Perch (0.67 fish/trapnet). The Bluegill were from the 2020 and 2021 year classes. The majority of Walleye were from the 2021 year class. Other Walleye year classes present included 2018 and 2019. Local anglers reported catching small Walleye during the 2023-24 winter. <br> \n <br> \nVarious fish species (pre and post spawn) were stocked shortly following the 2023 trapnet survey. These species included Black Crappie (24 fish, 12 pounds), Bluegill (140 fish, 35 pounds) and Largemouth Bass (126 fish, 82 pounds). These gamefish/panfish species were stocked to boast broodstock numbers to expediate natural reproduction. Bluegill natural reproduction was documented in Swenson during 2023. Abundant numbers of YOY Bluegill were observed in the 2023 fall electrofishing survey. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye fry (Spicer Strain) were last stocked into Swenson during mid-May of 2023 (50,842 fry). Walleye fry were also stocked in 2021 (105,525 Spicer Strain fry) and 2018 (100,000 Pike River Strain fry). YOY Walleye numbers were abundant (117.00/hour, 5.57 inches) in the 2023 fall night electrofishing survey. Abundant numbers of age 2 (2021 year class) Walleye (66.00/hour, 13.10 inches) were caught in the 2023 fall electrofishing survey. <br> \n <br> \nThe Swenson Lake fishery will be surveyed in the 2024 summer for all fish species. Walleye fry are scheduled annually for stocking in Swenson. Additional fish stockings of other species may also occur in Swenson. Fall electrofishing surveys will be conducted periodically during Walleye fry stocked years to assess the success or failure of the stockings.  <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A summer assessment of the fish population was conducted on Swenson Lake in June of 2001. Swenson is a small, shallow, turbid, and aerated lake located in Kandiyohi County. The maximum depth is 14 feet. Swenson receives relatively low fishing pressure. Water quality and clarity is generally poor to fair in Swenson. Aquatic vegetation (sago pondweed, coontail, hardstem bulrush) species and densities are limited within the lake. The immediate watershed consists mostly of hardwoods, wetlands, grasslands, and agricultural row crops. The DNR Spicer Fisheries Office manages Swenson Lake for walleye, northern pike, black crappie, and bluegill. <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie numbers were high in 2001 (21.1 fish/trapnet) and above the historical average (6.3 fish/trapnet). The 2001 black crappie average size was small in trapnets (0.11 lbs. and 4.7 inches) and gillnets (0.19 lbs. and 6.55 inches). The largest black crappie captured in the 2001 summer assessment was 12.4 inches. <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nBluegill numbers were low in 2001 (1.9 fish/trapnet) and below the historical average (8.3 fish/trapnet). The 2001 bluegill average size was small (0.15 lbs. and 4.9 inches from trapnets). The largest bluegill captured in the 2001 summer assessment was 7.9 inches. <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass numbers were low in the 2001 spring electrofishing survey (19.0 fish/hour) and below the Spicer Area average (48.0 fish/hour). The 2001 largemouth bass average size was moderate (2.06 lbs. and 14.6 inches from spring electrofishing). Largemouth bass growth rates in Swenson were above average compared to Spicer Area lakes. The largest largemouth bass captured in the 2001 spring electrofishing survey was 17.7 inches. <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike numbers were high in 2001 (10.5 fish/gillnet) and above the historical average (7.6 fish/gillnet). The 2001 northern pike average size was large (5.12 lbs. and 27.1 inches from gillnets). Northern pike growth rates in Swenson were above average compared to Spicer Area lakes. The largest northern pike captured in the 2001 summer assessment was 38.2 inches. <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nWalleye numbers were low to moderate in 2001 (5.0 fish/gillnet), and below the historical average (12.8 fish/gillnet). The 2001 walleye average size was moderate (1.81 lbs. and 16.4 inches from gillnets). Walleye growth rates in Swenson were above average compared to Spicer Area lakes. Local anglers reported good walleye angling success during the early summer months of 2001. Walleye natural reproduction in Swenson is generally absent or insignificant based on previous fall and summer surveys. Periodic walleye fry stockings (102,480 fry in 2001, 81,660 fry in 1999, 121,431 fry in 1997) maintain the walleye population in Swenson. Young of year \"YOY\" walleye numbers due to a 2001 walleye fry stocking were low to moderate (27.5 YOY walleye/hour) in the 2001 fall night electrofishing survey. The 2001 YOY walleye average size was large for Swenson (6.9 inches). <br> \n <br> \n  <br> \nYellow perch numbers were high in 2001 (60.5 fish/gillnet) and above the historical average (22.2 fish/gillnet). The 2001 yellow perch average size was moderate (0.24 lbs. and 7.7 inches from gillnets). <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nOther notable fish species captured in the 2001 summer assessment included low numbers of black bullhead (1.5 fish/gillnet) and yellow bullhead (2.0 fish/gillnet). Black bullhead numbers were abundant in the previous 1998 survey (74.3 fish/gillnet, 494.1 fish/trapnet). Historical average catch rates were 131.6 fish/gillnet for black bullhead and 0.9 fish/gillnet for yellow bullhead. <br> \n <br> \n  <br> \nCurrent fish management activities on Swenson include protecting the important aquatic vegetation habitat through the permit process, encouraging landowners to implement best management practices in the watershed, and stocking walleye fry every other year. The entire Swenson Lake fishery will be surveyed again in 2005.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A fish resurvey was conducted during mid June of 2005 in Swenson Lake. Swenson is a small sized (109 acres), shallow (14 feet maximum depth), aerated, and productive lake located in Kandiyohi County. Residential development is limited to 18 homes along the north and west shore areas. The public access is located on the north side. The surrounding watershed comprises mostly of agricultural row crops with small areas of woodland and wetland areas. The immediate shoreline area consists mostly of undeveloped woodland (hardwood trees) with small areas of wetlands, row crops, and residential homes. Agricultural row crop runoff (via inlets) is the primary source of nutrient pollution into Swenson. Nutrient levels were high (total phosphorus=0.081 ppm) during 2005 in Swenson. There are three small to moderate sized inlets (north, west, and south shores) that flow into Swenson. The outlet connects to Shakopee Creek. Water clarity was good (secchi= 6.00 feet) during the June 2005 resurvey. However, blue-green algae blooms were common and intense after the survey during the mid summer months in Swenson Lake. Submergent vegetation is limited to primarily sago pondweed, water moss, and filamentous algae, especially in the near shore areas. Emergent vegetation consists mainly of bulrush and cattail species scattered throughout the shoreline areas. Shoalwater substrates consist primarily of sand, gravel, and rubble. Swenson Lake is managed primarily for walleye, northern pike, black crappie, yellow perch, and bluegill. Walleye fry are generally stocked into Swenson every other year.

                "narrative": "<p>A standard survey was conducted during mid-June of 2019 in Swenson Lake. A targeted survey is generally used for sampling a specific kind of fish or time of year (i.e. spawning season, fall season, etc.) unlike a standard survey which samples a wider range of fish species during the summer months using standard methodology (i.e. standard time of year, set sampling stations, taking water clarity readings and oxygen/temperature profiles, etc.) and gears (i.e. lake survey gillnets, trapnets and possibly spring electrofishing for Largemouth Bass).  <br> \n <br> \nSwenson is a small sized (108 acres), shallow (14 feet maximum depth), aerated, and productive lake located in Kandiyohi County. The surrounding watershed is comprised mostly of agricultural row crops with small areas of woodland and wetland areas. The immediate shoreline area consists mostly of undeveloped woodlands (hardwood trees) with small areas of wetlands, row crops, and residential homes. Agricultural row crop runoff (via inlets) is the primary source of nutrient pollution into Swenson. Nutrient levels were high (total phosphorus=0.084 ppm, chlorophyll a=75.9 ppb) during 2015. There are three small to moderate sized inlets (north, west, and south shores) that flow into Swenson. The outlet connects to Shakopee Creek. Water levels were above normal during 2019. Dissolved oxygen was at 7 ppm throughout the water column during the 2019 survey. Water clarity was good (secchi reading=6.0 feet) on June 12, 2019. Blue-green algae blooms are common and intense during the mid-summer months in Swenson Lake. Submergent vegetation was limited to water moss in 2015. Other aquatic vegetation species present included curly-leaf pondweed, sago pondweed and filamentous algae during past surveys. Emergent vegetation consists mainly of bulrush and cattail species scattered throughout the shoreline areas.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike numbers were low in 2019 (3.00 fish/gillnet). The Northern Pike historical average catch rate is 5.33 fish/gillnet for Swenson. The 2019 Northern Pike average size was moderate (3.13 pounds and 24.32 inches) from gillnets. The Northern Pike historical average weight is 3.59 pounds from gillnets. There were no fish over 30.00 inches caught in the 2019 survey nets. Northern Pike growth limits were slow. The 2015 year class comprised 44% of the 2019 Northern Pike survey catch. Northern Pike possession limit regulations for Swenson in the North-central Zone are as follows: anglers can keep 10 Northern Pike, but not more than two pike longer than 26 inches; and all from 22 to 26 inches must be released. Northern Pike taken by spearing follow the same rules except one pike may be between 22 and 26 inches or two larger than 26 inches. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie numbers were low in 2019 (1.50 fish/trapnet). Black Crappie abundance was high during the 2010 survey (210.20 fish/trapnet, 7.71 inches average). The Black Crappie historical average catch rate is 29.59 fish/trapnet. Black Crappie abundance was also low (3.00 fish/gillnet) in the 2019 gillnets. The 2019 Black Crappie size was small (0.16 pounds and 6.72 inches) from trapnets. The Black Crappie historical average weight is 0.24 pounds from trapnets.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch numbers were low in 2019 (2.00 fish/gillnet). The Yellow Perch historical average catch rate is 16.48 fish/gillnet for Swenson Lake. The 2019 Yellow Perch average size was moderate (0.16 pounds and 7.10 inches) from gillnets. However, no Yellow Perch 8.00 inches or larger were captured in 2019 survey nets. The Yellow Perch historical average weight is 0.21 pounds from gillnets.  <br> \n <br> \nBluegill numbers were low in 2019 (2.30 fish/trapnet). The Bluegill historical average catch rate is 7.68 fish/trapnet for Swenson. The 2019 Bluegill average size was moderate to large (0.24 pounds and 6.54 inches) from trapnets. The Bluegill historical average weight is 0.23 pounds from trapnets. Bluegill growth rates were excellent. The 2015 year class comprised 33% of the 2019 Bluegill survey catch. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye numbers were moderate in 2019 (5.00 fish/gillnet). The Walleye historical average catch rate is 8.54 fish/gillnet for Swenson. The 2019 Walleye average size was moderate to large (2.29 pounds and 18.61 inches) from gillnets. The Walleye historical average weight is 1.68 pounds from gillnets. Walleye growth rates were good. The 2016 year class (fryling stocked) comprised 43% of the 2019 Walleye survey catch. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye natural reproduction in Swenson is generally infrequent and insignificant based on previous fall and summer surveys. Various Walleye stockings of fry, frylings, fingerlings and yearlings have occurred in Swenson. Recent Walleye fryling stockings occurred in 2012 (31,218 fish), 2014 (31,690 fish) and 2016 (27,014 fish). Walleye fry were recently stocked in 2018 (100,000 fish). Walleye yearlings were last stocked in 2012 (565 fish, 226 pounds). Young of year \"YOY\" Walleye abundance was high in 2010 (63.00 YOY/hour, 5.91 inches average), 2014 (210.00 YOY/hour, 6.12 inches), 2016 (136.00 YOY/hour 4.97 inches) and 2018 (163.33 YOY/hour, 5.49 inches); but low in 2012 (9.00 YOY/hour, 6.77 inches average) fall electrofishing surveys.  <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass electrofishing survey was not conducted in 2019. Largemouth Bass abundance was low (12.75 fish/hour) in the previous 2015 spring electrofishing survey. The 2015 Largemouth Bass average weight and length were 2.09 pounds and 15.26 inches respectively from spring electrofishing.  <br> \n <br> \nBlack Bullhead numbers were low in 2019 (6.00 fish/gillnet). The Black Bullhead historical average catch rate is 80.93 fish/gillnet for Swenson. The 2019 Black Bullhead trapnet catch rate (3.10 fish/trapnet) was also below the historical average (108.12 fish/trapnet). The 2019 Black Bullhead size was moderate (0.58 pounds and 10.05 inches) from gillnets.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow Bullhead numbers were moderate (3.20 fish/trapnet) in 2019. The Yellow Bullhead average size was moderate (0.70 pounds and 10.58 inches). <br> \n <br> \nFreshwater Drum were first netted in Swenson during 2019 (0.50 fish/gillnet, 9.25 inches). Freshwater Drum are abundant in Norway Lake which is upstream of potential watershed connections that flow into Swenson. <br> \n <br> \nCommon Carp numbers were low in 2019 (0.60 fish/trapnet). The Common Carp historical average catch rate is 2.99 fish/trapnet for Swenson Lake. The 2019 Common Carp average size was moderate (5.68 pounds and 22.82 inches) from trapnets.  <br> \n <br> \nCurrent fish management activities on Swenson include monitoring the fish population on a periodic basis, monitoring winter dissolved oxygen levels, protecting aquatic vegetation through the permit process, assisting aquatic plant management and enforcement personnel in educating boaters and monitoring access sites for potential invasive species introductions, participating in local watershed initiatives, and stocking various fish species as warranted. The Swenson fishery will be sampled in the 2024 summer for all fish species and 2021 fall for YOY Walleye abundance. The 2020 scheduled Walleye fry stocking will be postponed until 2021 due to no egg take/fry availability because of the Corvid-19 pandemic in 2020. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

Swenson is a small (108 acres), shallow (14 feet maximum), aerated and productive lake located in Kandiyohi County.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye natural reproduction in Swenson is generally infrequent and insignificant based on previous surveys, markings and the WAESTOCK program analysis. Walleye fry (Pike River strain) were last stocked into Swenson during 2018 (100,000 fry). Walleye frylings (OTC marked) have been stocked into Swenson during 2009 (27,000 Pike/Red River strain fish), 2010 (40,062 Pike River strain fish), 2012 (31,218 Pike River strain fish), 2014 (31,690 Pike River strain fish) and 2016 (27,014 Spicer strain fish). Walleye fingerlings and yearlings were last stocked into Swenson during 2012 (126 fingerlings, 21 pounds; 565 yearlings, 226 pounds) after the fall electrofishing survey. <br> \n <br> \nYOY Walleye numbers were abundant in 2018 (163.33 YOY/hour, 5.49 inches) and 2016 (136.00 YOY/hour, 4.97 inches) fall electrofishing surveys. Oxytetracycline \"OTC\" marked fish accounted for 54.2% of the 2016 Fall YOY Walleye catch. Abundant YOY Walleye numbers (210.00 YOY/hour, 6.12 inches average length) were also captured in the 2014 fall electrofishing survey. YOY Walleye numbers were low (9.00 YOY/hour, 6.77 inches) in 2012. YOY Walleye abundance was high in 2010 (63.00 YOY/hour, 5.91 inches), but low in the 2009 (3.00 YOY/hour, 4.69 inches) fall electrofishing survey. All of the YOY Walleye captured in 2010 were OTC marked fish from a 2010 early summer Walleye fryling stocking. No yearling Walleye were caught in 2018 or 2016. <br> \n <br> \nAdult Walleye abundance (6.50 fish/gillnet) was within the normal ranges for Swenson and similar lakes in the most recent 2015 summer gillnet survey. The 2015 Walleye average weight and length were 1.71 pounds and 17.20 inches from gillnets. The 2011 year class (yearlings stocked in the 2012 fall) comprised 80% of the 2015 Walleye survey catch. <br> \n <br> \nThe Swenson Lake fishery will be surveyed in the 2019 summer for all fish species. Fall electrofishing surveys will be conducted during Walleye fry or fryling stocked years to assess the success or failure of the stockings. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A population assessment was conducted during mid June of 2010 in Swenson Lake. Swenson is a small sized (109 acres), shallow (14 feet maximum depth), aerated, and productive lake located in Kandiyohi County. The surrounding watershed comprises mostly of agricultural row crops with small areas of woodland and wetland areas. The immediate shoreline area consists mostly of undeveloped woodland (hardwood trees) with small areas of wetlands, row crops, and residential homes. Agricultural row crop runoff (via inlets) is the primary source of nutrient pollution into Swenson. Nutrient levels were high (total phosphorus=0.081 ppm) during 2005 in Swenson. There are three small to moderate sized inlets (north, west, and south shores) that flow into Swenson. The outlet connects to Shakopee Creek. Water clarity was fair (secchi= 4.5 feet) during the June of 2010. However, blue-green algae blooms were common and intense after the survey during the mid summer months in Swenson Lake. Submergent vegetation is limited to primarily sago pondweed, water moss, and filamentous algae, especially in the near shore areas. Emergent vegetation consists mainly of bulrush and cattail species scattered throughout the shoreline areas. Swenson Lake is managed primarily for walleye, northern pike, black crappie, yellow perch, and bluegill. Walleye fry or frylings are generally stocked into Swenson every other year. Walleye fingerling stocking is contingent upon two successive walleye stocking failures in Swenson Lake. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike numbers were low in 2010 (1.33 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal ranges for Swenson and similar lakes. The northern pike historical average catch rate is 6.21 fish/gillnet for Swenson. The 2010 northern pike average size was moderate to large (4.18 pounds and 24.61 inches) from gillnets. The northern pike historical average weight is 3.29 pounds from gillnets. Northern pike growth rates in Swenson were within or above the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-7. The 2004 northern pike year class comprised 56% of the 2010 northern pike gillnet and trapnet catch. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie numbers were abundant and the highest historical recorded catch rate in 2010 (210.20 fish/trapnet) compared to the normal ranges for Swenson Lake and similar lakes. The black crappie historical average catch rate is 37.64 fish/trapnet. The 2010 black crappie average size was moderate (0.25 pounds and 7.71 inches) from trapnets. The black crappie historical average weight is 0.23 pounds from trapnets. The 2010 catch rate of quality size (8.00 inches) and larger black crappie was high (48.78 fish/trapnet) for Swenson. Black crappie growth rates in Swenson were with the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-2, but below the normal ranges for ages 3-5. The 2006 and 2005 black crappie year classes comprised 69% and 23% respectively of the 2010 black crappie gillnet and trapnet catch.   <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch numbers were moderate in 2010 (12.00 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range for Swenson and similar lakes. The yellow perch historical average catch rate is 19.26 fish/gillnet for Swenson Lake. The 2010 yellow perch average size was moderate (0.19 pounds and 7.10 inches) from gillnets. The yellow perch historical average weight is 0.22 pounds from gillnets.  <br> \n <br> \nBluegill numbers were moderately abundant in 2010 (9.90 fish/trapnet) compared to the normal ranges for Swenson and similar lakes. The bluegill historical catch rate is 8.30 fish/trapnet for Swenson. The 2010 bluegill average size was large (0.29 pounds and 7.13 inches) from trapnets. The bluegill historical average weight is 0.24 pounds from trapnets. The 2010 catch rate of quality size (6.00 inches) and larger bluegill was high (9.70 fish/trapnet) in Swenson.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye numbers were low in 2010 (1.00 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal ranges for Swenson and similar lakes. The walleye historical average catch rate is 9.33 fish/gillnet for Swenson. The 2010 walleye trapnet catch (0.20 fish/trapnet) was also below the historical average (1.44 fish/trapnet) in Swenson. The 2010 walleye average size was large (4.42 pounds and 22.55 inches) from gillnets. The walleye historical average weight is 1.59 pounds from gillnets. Walleye growth rates for Swenson were generally above the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-7. The 2005 walleye year class (fingerlings stocked in the 2005 fall) comprised 60% of the 2010 walleye gillnet and trapnet catch. Walleye natural reproduction in Swenson is generally infrequent and insignificant based on previous fall and summer surveys. YOY walleye abundance was high (63.00 YOY/hour, 5.91 inches average) in the 2010 fall electrofishing survey. All of the YOY walleye captured in 2010 were OTC marked fish from a 2010 early summer walleye fryling stocking (40,062 fish). <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass abundance in the 2010 spring electrofishing survey was low (3.40 fish/hour) compared to the average catch rate from Spicer Area lakes (46.04 fish/hour). The largemouth bass historical average catch rate is 12.43 fish/hour for Swenson. The 2010 largemouth bass average size was large (1.52 pounds and 13.29 inches) from spring electrofishing. The largemouth bass historical average weight and length were 2.07 pounds and 13.96 inches from spring electrofishing for Swenson. Largemouth bass growth rates in Swenson Lake were generally near or below the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-5. The 2005 and 2004 year classes each comprised 33% of the 2010 largemouth bass spring electrofishing catch.  <br> \n <br> \nBlack bullhead numbers were low in 2010 (4.67 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal ranges for Swenson and similar lakes. The black bullhead historical average catch rate is 101.83 fish/gillnet for Swenson. The 2010 black bullhead trapnet catch rate (10.40 fish/trapnet) was also below the historical average (138.09 fish/trapnet) for Swenson. The 2010 black bullhead average size was large (0.63 pounds and 10.44 inches) from gillnets. The black bullhead historical average weight is 0.39 pounds from gillnets. <br> \n <br> \nCarp abundance was low in 2010 (0.10 fish/trapnet) compared to the normal ranges for Swenson and similar lakes (25th=1.00 fish/trapnet). The carp historical average catch rate is 3.73 fish/trapnet for Swenson Lake. The 2010 carp average size was small (3.31 pounds and 19.09 inches) from trapnets. The carp historical average weight is 3.70 pounds from trapnets. <br> \n <br> \nCurrent fish management activities on Swenson include monitoring the fish population on a periodic basis, monitoring winter dissolved oxygen levels, protecting aquatic vegetation through the permit process, assisting aquatic plant management and enforcement personnel in educating boaters and monitoring access sites for potential invasive species introductions, participating in local watershed initiatives, and stocking various fish species as warranted. The Swenson fishery will be sampled in the 2012 fall for YOY walleye abundance. <br> \n</p>",
