Black crappie numbers were fair, but fish were of small size, with none measuring 9 inches.  Bluegill were present in low numbers.  Three-fourths of the fish present were of acceptable size to anglers.  Five walleye were taken, of acceptable size to anglers, but were not stocked by the DNR.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Goose Lake is 75 acres in size with a maximum depth of 25 feet. In the past, this lake had been subject to periodic winterkill, resulting in a fish population dominated by black bullheads and golden shiners. A winter aeration system was first operated in 1996-1997 and stocking of northern pike (NOP) and largemouth bass took place irregularly from 1996 to 2000, inclusive. The present fish population resembles that found in a typical Largemouth Bass-Bluegill-Northern Pike lake, but with some quality sized individuals present. Northern Pike were sampled above median levels for abundance and size in lakes of this type. The average size of NOP captured in the combined gear sample was 26.66\" in length and 5.54 pounds. Two NOP 35.0 inches in length or larger were sampled during this assessment, with the largest being 37.09\" TL and weighing 15.4 pounds. Growth rate of sampled NOP was good. Only one yellow perch (YEP) was captured in the gill net catch, but golden shiners (GOS) continue to be present and were sampled at the third quartile for abundance in the gill net sample with some quality sized individuals represented. Largemouth Bass (LMB) also appear to have a significant presence in this lake as they were sampled at the median level for abundance in both gill and trap nets. Black Crappie (BLC) were sampled at the first quartile level for abundance in trap nets. No BLC were present in the gill net sample. The average BLC captured was 8.36 inches in length and 0.36 pounds (2.78 fish/lb), with approximately 9% of the BLC sampled measured 10.0 inches or larger. Bluegill (BLG) were sampled over the median level for abundance and mean weight in trap nets. The average size of BLG in the trap net sample was 7.17 inches long and 0.29 pounds (3.45 fish/lb), with the largest individual BLG captured measured 9.17 inches. Approximately one-in-four BLG captured measured 8.0 inches or larger. Pumpkinseed Sunfish (PMK) also exhibited an impressive size structure. The average PMK sampled was 7.99\" long and 0.48 pounds. (2.08 fish/lb), with the largest individual captured measuring 9.06 inches. </p>",

Their numbers are considered to be average for this type of lake. The average size sampled was 5.9 inches. Pumpkinseed sunfish were also sampled in high numbers for this type of lake. Their average size was 7.39 inches. Yellow grub was found in both species of panfish. Some fish contained heavy infestations. Northern pike were also sampled in average numbers. The average size sampled was 26.8 inches in length, and 75% of the northern pike caught were over 25 inches. Largemouth bass are not sampled effectively in trap nets or gill nets. The few that were caught were nice sized. The largest was over 17 inches in length. Black crappies were found in the highest numbers since 1984, but are still within the average range. The average size sampled was 8.5 inches but none exceeded 10 inches. Black bullhead numbers continue to decline. The average size black bullhead is approximately 11 inches long. Other species sampled include golden shiner, white sucker and yellow perch.     </p>",

White sucker and bluegills were found in low numbers in the net catch.Northern pike were found in numbers much higher than either local or statewide medians.  Of 26 fish aged only 2 were younger than IV annulus.  Northern pike were aged at IV to VII annuli for the older fish.  IV annuli (7 fish) and VII annuli (9 fish) were most common.  V and VI annuli fish showed up in aging in less numbers than year classes on either side (IV, VII annuli).  A fingerling stocking of substantial numbers in 1978 also failed to show well, but these fish were probably not fully vulnerable to the gear.  If the scales were accurately read, natural reproduction of northern pike is not a regular occurrence in Goose Lake, although some does seem to occur.Black crappie were taken in numbers significantly above the local median.  Twenty-two fish were aged of which 20 were II annulus fish, the others being I annulus.  Growth was not significantly different from the average for II annulus fish.  Few older larger fish were indicated by length-frequencies.  Young of the year crappies were found in the shoreline seine.  Pumpkinseed numbers were also higher than local figures.  II annulus fish accounted for 13 of 19 fish aged, the others being III annulus (4 fish) and IV annulus (2 fish).  Growth was average at II annulus.  Only one bluegill was taken and this fish was a fairly old one (VI annulus).  No reproduction of bluegills was indicated by shoreline seining.Black bullhead were found in greater abundance than local catch numbers.  The fish tended to be small and probably not desirable to a commercial fisherman.  Natural reproduction of this species was indicated by shoreline seining.  Yellow perch were found in numbers nearly twice as high as the local median and were small, the most numerous being from 5.0 to 5.4 inches.</p>",

Abundance was high, with 148 Largemouth Bass sampled per hour.  Sampled bass ranged from 3\" to 21\", suggesting many year classes are likely present.  High numbers of medium sized bass were present, along with several very large individuals.  Over 70% of bass sampled were greater than 12\", and 11% were greater than 15\".   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike were sampled at a rate of 10.5 fish per gill net, which is above average for class 40 lakes and a significant increase from the 2010 survey catch of 3 per gill net.  This was the highest catch rate of Northern Pike since 1999 when 15 pike per gill net were sampled.  Northern Pike sampled during this survey ranged from 18\" to 42\".  Over 58% of Northern Pike sampled were greater than 21\" in length, and 24% were greater than 25\".   <br> \n <br> \nBluegill catch rate was 18.86 per trap net, above average for class 40 lakes and 37% of the Bluegills sampled were greater than 7\" in length.  Black Crappie CPUE was 3.43 fish per trap net, below average for class 40 lakes, and 35% of sampled crappies were greater than 9\" in length. </p>",

Black bullheads have dominated the fish population as recently as 1995.  With the prevention of winterkill assured, stocking of largemouth bass and northern pike has occurred.Black bullheads are abundant, but have dropped in numbers since 1995.  At the same time, numbers of sunfish species (bluegill, pumpkinseed, hybrid sunfish) have dramatically increased, although most are small in size.  Northern pike and largemouth bass were sampled for the first time since 1984.  The largemouth bass are small - most fish are under 14 inches long with an average weight of a pound.  Sizes of northern pike are more variable, with some fish near 30 inches in length and an average weight near 4 pounds.  With the reintroduction of predators, golden shiner and yellow perch numbers have dropped from previous highs, both species are abundant.  Black crappie numbers are average, with some large individuals present.</p>",
