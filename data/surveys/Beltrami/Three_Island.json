                "narrative": "<p>Three Island Lake is located about 3 miles northwest of the village of Turtle River and is in the Turtle River chain of lakes. It is in lake class 39, and fish communities are compared with others in this class including Irving, Long (near Deer Lake), Minerva, (Big) Pine, Big Rice and Rogstad.  There are 115 lakes in this class distributed throughout central Minnesota.  Primary management is listed as walleye with secondary species including northern pike, yellow perch and centrarchids (panfish).     Walleye are abundant and were sampled at a rate greater than 75% of the comparable lakes. Most of the walleye measured were 15-18 inches long, and the largest was 27 inches.  With an average weight of 1.4 pounds, this should provide a desirable fishery.    Northern pike are also above average in abundance.  An average weight of 2.0 pounds is at the lake class average.  The average length of pike sampled was about 21 inches and the largest was 32 inches.      Yellow perch numbers fluctuate near the high end of the normal range.  The average size sampled was 6.9 inches long and about one-fifth pound.  The largest perch was 11.3 inches. Some perch have the parasite Neascus or yellow grub.  These parasites are not harmful though they may be unsightly.    Largemouth bass are present, but because of the difficulty in sampling with standard gear the abundance is unknown.  Three bass, 13\", 14\", 19\", were sampled in trap nets.    Bluegill abundance is lower than that found in most comparable lakes.  Bluegill were not sampled in 1975.  All other assessments have found them at low abundance, but the average weight of 3/4 pounds is excellent.  Pumpkinseed are more numerous than bluegills but the average size is smaller.    Black crappie are below the normal range for comparable lakes but the average weight of 0.8 pounds is above normal.  Rock bass are common and near the lake class average.    Brown, black, and yellow bullheads are present with browns the most abundant.  Average size and weight varies by species but they are above lake class averages.  Bullhead populations may be affected, to some degree, by removal under a commercial fishing program.    Some other species of minor interest that are found in Three Island Lake include bowfin (dogfish), burbot (eelpout), white suckers, shorthead redhorse, and cisco.  The species assemblages in Three Island lake may be more diverse than other lakes in its class due to its connection to the Turtle River chain.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Three Island Lake is a 729-acre lake located 14 miles northeast of Bemidji in Beltrami County.  Three Island is a large, shallow lake basin with lots of aquatic vegetation.  The maximum depth is 25 feet; however, much of the lake is less than 9 feet deep.  Ice travel is limited during winter months by areas of current that can cause unsafe ice conditions.  The is a DNR public water access with an earthen ramp and parking for 6 trucks/trailers located in Three Island County Park off of County Road 23.  Special regulations are in effect for sunfish (daily limit of 5 fish).  The Northern Pike special regulation in effect since 2003 was under review in 2022 so be sure to check on the current regulation before keeping any pike.  Statewide regulations apply to all other species.   <br> \n <br> \nThree Island Lake may be overlooked by some anglers but does provide some notable fishing opportunities for the Bemidji Area.  Three Island has excellent habitat for Bluegill, Black Crappie, Northern Pike and Largemouth Bass. Extensive weed lines and emergent vegetation like cattail, bulrush and lily pads provide plenty of fishing opportunities for these species.  Anglers can expect to catch good numbers of Bluegill in the 8-inch size range with bigger fish in the mix as well.  Black Crappie catch rates from surveys of Three Island Lake have always been low; however, the lake has been a consistent producer of Black Crappie over time.  Although Largemouth Bass were not targeted in the 2021 survey, a quality population is known to exist in Three Island Lake.  Fishing opportunities for topwater bass anglers abound.  Walleye are present in Three Island Lake although not in the numbers found in many of the area's more consistent Walleye lakes.  Walleye captured in the 2021 survey had a good average size of nearly 18 inches and nearly 2 lbs/fish.  Northern Pike were abundant in the 2021 survey with fish up to nearly 33 inches in length captured.  Pike can provide plenty of fishing action on days when other species refuse to cooperate.   <br> \n <br> \nOther species of fish captured in this survey were Rock Bass, Pumpkinseed, Bowfin, hybrid sunfish, bullhead species, Tullibee (Cisco), Shorthead Redhorse, White Sucker and Yellow Perch.   <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of nearshore fish species in Three Island Lake was conducted on August 18-19, 2021, by Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program staff. Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake, and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at all 14 sampling stations, but seven stations were sampled from the boat due to site conditions. Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample five stations, a 15-foot seine was used to sample three stations, and site conditions prevented the use of a seine at six stations. Nearshore sampling captured 16 species of fish including seven species that are intolerant of disturbance (i.e., Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, Northern Sunfish, Pugnose Shiner, and Rock Bass) and none that are tolerant of disturbance. <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore data were combined with trap net and gill net data from an August 2021 survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based IBI (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment. In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g., Blackchin Shiner, Iowa Darter, and Rock Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g., Green Sunfish). The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.  <br> \n <br> \nResults from this survey indicate that the fish community in Three Island Lake is healthy as indicated by an FIBI score above the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes. These results will be considered when the biological health of the lake is assessed during the Mississippi River-Headwaters Watershed assessment process, which will be completed in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Three Island Lake is a 729-acre lake with a maximum depth of 25 feet located 14 miles northeast of Bemidji in Beltrami County.  There is a DNR public water access with an earthen ramp and parking for about 6 trucks/trailers located in Three Island County Park off of County Road 23.  Three Island Lake is managed for Northern Pike, Walleye, Bluegill, Black Crappie, and Largemouth Bass.  A special regulation for Northern Pike consisting of a protected slot limit from 24 to 36 inches with one fish allowed over 36 inches in the daily possession limit of 3 fish is in effect.   <br> \n <br> \nThe Minnesota Department of Natural Resources has classified Minnesota lakes based on similarities in lake basin (depth, size) and water chemistry (alkalinity, water clarity).  Three Island Lake is in lake class 39.  The following discussion makes comparisons between Movil Lake and other class 25 lakes in the state.  Other Bemidji area lakes in this class include Lake Irving and Lake Minerva. <br> \n <br> \nThe 2016 Northern Pike catch rate of 6.25/GN was within the normal range found in similar lakes (4.63/gill net - 11.63/gill net).   Northern Pike captured had an average size of 21.90 inches in length and 2.42 lbs/fish.  The largest Northern Pike captured in the 2016 assessment was 33.03 inches in length.   <br> \n <br> \nThe Walleye catch rate was 2.75/gill net.  Walleye captured had an average size of 16.25 inches in length and 1.34 lbs/fish.  No direct Walleye stocking occurs in Three Island Lake. The population is likely maintained by a combination of natural reproduction, downstream migration of stocked fish from basins above and upstream spawning migrations since the outlet dam was modified to allow fish passage.  The largest Walleye captured in the 2016 assessment measured 19.96 inches in length.   <br> \n <br> \nThe Bluegill catch rate of 8.92/trap net was above the median catch rate for similar lakes (7.11/trap net).  The average size was 7.16 inches in length and 0.33 lbs/fish.  A good proportion of the catch exceeded 8 inches in length, providing a quality bluegill fishery. <br> \n <br> \nThe Black Crappie catch rate was 0.75/trap net.  The average size was 9.83 inches and 0.59 lbs/fish. <br> \n <br> \nThe Largemouth Bass population was evaluated in early June by means of night electrofishing.  In a little over 90 minutes, 13 bass were captured, measured, and released.  Lengths ranged from 6.8 to 19.5 inches with an average of 13.5 inches.  Thick vegetation made electrofishing in prime areas difficult but the presence of a few large fish in the survey indicates a quality bass population is present.   <br> \n <br> \nOther species of fish captured in the 2016 assessment were Pumpkinseed, Rock Bass, Tullibee (Cisco), Yellow Perch, White Sucker, and Bullhead species.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Three Island Lake is a 678-acre lake with a maximum depth of 25 feet.  The lake is located two miles northwest of the town of Turtle River in south central Beltrami County.  There is a DNR public access in the northeast corner of the lake off of county road 23.  The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different lake classes based on physical and chemical characteristics.  Three Island Lake is in lake class 39.  Other area lakes in the same lake class include Minerva, Big Pine, Rogstad, Irving, Island, Long, Moose and Big Rice Lakes.  Typically lakes in this class are shallow and have amounts of area less than 15 feet deep.  The DNR manages Three Island Lake for walleye, northern pike and members of the sunfish family.A general decline in the availability of large northern pike has been well documented in Minnesota lakes.  Three Island Lake, along with a number of other lakes in the Turtle River chain, had a 24-36 inch protected slot for northern pike implemented in 2003 hoping to reverse this trend.  This regulation will be reviewed in 2012 to determine whether to continue, revise or drop the regulation.Anglers can expect to fish for a multitude of species in Three Island Lake.  With its irregular shaped shoreline, there are a variety of habitats to explore when searching for such species as northern pike, walleye, largemouth bass and panfish.  Northern pike are abundant and anglers can expect good catch rates.  There are plenty of pike available below 24 inches for eating.  Those young fish are generally the most abundant in a population and will benefit from some harvest.  Remember to release all fish between 24 and 36 inches as required.  Those fish tend to be four years old and above, are extremely vulnerable to harvest, and need this protection to reach their size potential.  Once anglers become accustomed to releasing these mid-sized fish, they will enjoy improved catch rates within this size range as many pike will be caught multiple times by different anglers.  Many anglers who have learned to enjoy catching and releasing the mid-sized fish also choose to voluntarily release those larger legal fish more than 36 inches, unless they are interested in a mounted trophy.Three Island Lake has a unique walleye population that maintains a very good walleye fishery without the aid of stocking.  Eight consecutive year classes were sampled in 2004, all assumed to have originated from consistent natural reproduction.  The most abundant sizes, age 2 and 3, ranged from 12-15 inches.  There are no special regulations affecting walleye harvest on Three Island Lake, but since the population is maintained by natural reproduction, some voluntary release of mature spawners is encouraged.  Generally females 18 inches and larger tend to be the mature egg producers in the population.  Releasing mature females can help ensure future egg production to sustain this population.Yellow perch abundance for 2004 was the lowest recorded in previous assessments, but is still comparable to the range of what you would typically find in class 39 lakes.  Perch ranged in length from 5.0 to 9.3 inches with a mean length of 6.5 inches.  Nine percent were greater than 8 inches long.In 2004 the abundance of bluegill was the highest recorded on Three Island Lake.  Bluegill ranged in length from 3.3 to 9.3 inches with an average length of 6.0 inches.  Quality-sized bluegill are disappearing from many of our lakes due to excessive harvest by anglers.  If we are going to maintain some quality in our bluegill populations, anglers will need to show voluntary restraint when bluegill are really biting.  By practicing selective harvest, anglers could harvest the smaller more abundant bluegill for eating, and release some of the medium to large fish.  This would help maintain balance in the population and ensure the opportunity to catch large bluegill in the future.Tweny percent of the bluegill were greater than 7 inches long.  Seven different year classes were identified in the aged sample with the 2001 year class making up 61% of the sample.Few black crappie and largemouth bass have been sampled on Three Island Lake.  More specialized sampling targeting these species would be needed to obtain a more representative sample of these important species.  However, it is not possible to implement special sampling for every species.Other fish sampled include bullheads, pumpkinseed sunfish, rock bass, bowfin (dogfish), white sucker and tullibee (cisco).Development pressure is increasing around the shorelines and within the watershed on Minnesota lakes.  This degrades water quality and impacts valuable shoreline habitat.  Native shoreline vegetation provides habitat for fish and wildlife, filters harmful nutrients and protects against shoreline erosion.  Lakeshore owners can minimize their impact on shoreline and maintain a more natural setting while actually decreasing annual maintenance.

                "narrative": "<p>Three Island Lake is a 722-acre lake with a maximum depth of 25 feet located 12 miles northeast of Bemidji in Beltrami County.  Three Island is one of eleven connected lakes known as the Turtle River chain.  There is a single lane, earthen boat ramp with parking for about 6 trucks/trailers located near the outlet of the lake in Three Island County Park off of CSAH 23.  Most of Three Island Lake is less than 10 feet deep, with extensive stands of bulrush and other emergent vegetation.  There are a small number of lake homes, cabins and one resort along the mostly undeveloped shoreline.  The fish community of Three Island Lake consists of walleye, northern pike, largemouth bass, panfish (including black crappie), and yellow perch.  Three Island, along with many of the lakes in the Turtle River chain, is managed with a special regulation for northern pike (24 to 36-inch protected slot limit). The regulation is intended to increase the average size of northern pike and improve the size structure of the population.  Statewide fishing regulations apply to all other species. <br> \n <br> \nThe 2011 population assessment captured walleye up to 25 inches in length, with an average size of 17.9 inches and 1.9 lbs/fish.  Most walleye captured were between 15 and 22 inches in length.  Walleye are not stocked in Three Island Lake, but are maintained through immigration from other connected lakes in the Turtle River chain as well as some limited natural reproduction within the lake.  The amount of deep water habitat for walleye is limited in Three Island Lake, which can result in concentrated fish during certain times of the year.  Walleye also utilize shallow water and aquatic vegetation in Three Island Lake.  Trap nets, which are set on shorelines and sample fish in shallow water, caught good numbers of walleye during the assessment.  These fish were likely in the shallows during low light periods or at night.   <br> \nThe northern pike population of Three Island Lake has shown improvement in overall size structure and average size of fish since the last assessment in 2007.   The most notable shift in size structure was for fish greater than 30 inches in length, which increased from 4% of the sample in 2007 to 16% of the sample in 2011.  Average size increased to 22 inches in length and 2.6 lbs/fish, which is equal to the upper quartile value for class 39 lakes.  Fish up to 34.6 inches were present in the 2011 sample.  Three Island Lake has very suitable habitat for northern pike. <br> \n <br> \nThe bluegill trap net catch rate (4.2/TN) has remained stable since the last population assessment in 2007 (4.4/TN).   Although the population density is on the low side, average size is good at 7.1 inches and 0.34 lbs/fish, and 33% of bluegill in the sample were greater than 8 inches in length.  There has been a trend of increasing bluegill abundance over the past 30 years in many lakes in the Turtle River chain, including Three Island.  Bluegill have gone from a background species to an important part of the fish community in these lakes, and local anglers and lakeshore residents have noticed this trend.  The 2011 population assessment turned up a small number of black crappie, mostly small fish from the 2010 year class.  Black crappie numbers appear to be down on Three Island Lake and anglers may want to consider pursuing this species on one of the other lakes in the area that contain a better population.  Other species that can provide anglers with some steady action on Three Island Lake include largemouth bass, rock bass and yellow perch.  Largemouth bass are not sampled effectively with standard lake survey gear, but fish up to 17.5 inches in length were captured and local bass anglers do pursue the species on Three Island Lake.  Rock bass are scrappy, plentiful and can make good table fare.  Yellow perch up to 10 inches in length were captured in the 2011 assessment.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Three Island Lake is a 678-acre lake with a maximum depth of 25 feet.  Most of the lake is less than 10 feet deep.  The lake is located two miles northwest of the town of Turtle River in south central Beltrami County.  There is a DNR public earthen access located on the road accessing the Three Island County Park off of county road 23.  The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different lake classes based on physical and chemical characteristics.  Three Island Lake is in lake class 39.  Lakes in this lake class are typically shallow with the majority of the lake less than 15 feet deep.  The DNR manages Three Island Lake for walleye, northern pike and members of the sunfish family. <br> \n <br> \nAll species of fish typically found in a lake class 39 fish community are found in Three Island Lake.  Because of this, anglers can expect to fish for a multitude of species on the lake. Three Island Lake fish community is dominated by northern pike and members of the sunfish family.  No stocking of any species occurs on the lake. <br> \n  <br> \nThree Island Lake is included in a special northern pike regulation consistent for all lakes on the Turtle River chain. The regulation requires anglers to immediately release all pike from 24-36 inches, with only one over 36 inches allowed.  This regulation, implemented in 2003, is intended to improve the quality of the pike population and help maintain a more balanced predator population.  A long-term objective of the protected size regulation is to eventually shift the population from a high-density small pike population to a lower density population of larger pike.  Unfortunately, northern pike abundance has nearly doubled since the 2003 assessment to over 17 per gill net set.  Just 19 of 155 northern pike sampled were large enough to fall within the protected size range. It may take a number of years for a quantity of pike to grow into the range of protection and possibly even longer to shift size structure enough to suppress excessive production of young pike.  This regulation will be evaluated with another assessment in 2011 and be reviewed in 2012. <br> \n <br> \nIn the past Three Island Lake has maintained a walleye fishery without the need of stocking.  In the 2004 findings, eight consecutive year classes were sampled and were all from natural reproduction.  However, in the 2007 findings, walleye abundance was the lowest recorded.  There is no special regulation for walleye on Three Island Lake.  It is uncertain whether natural reproduction of walleye is being affected and/or high fishing pressure is taking its toll.  Whatever the case, anglers can definitely help the lake by releasing walleye 18 inches or larger.  These larger walleye are typically mature fish.  Releasing mature females can help increase egg production and ultimately increase the walleye population. <br> \n  <br> \nBluegill is a fairly recent newcomer to Three Island Lake being sampled for the first time in 1983.  Currently the lake has a low-density population of bluegill that at times can be of quality size.  In 2007 bluegill ranged in length from 3.7 to 8.5 inches.  Almost half of the bluegill sampled were seven inches or larger in size.  In past assessments bluegill in the nine to ten-inch size were sampled.  In order to improve the quality, anglers are encouraged to show some voluntary restraint when bluegill are biting well.  By practicing selective harvest, anglers can harvest the smaller more abundant bluegill for eating, and release more of the medium to large fish.  This will help maintain balance in the population and increase the opportunity to catch large bluegill in the future.  Other members of the sunfish family that were sampled include pumpkinseed, rock bass, black crappie, largemouth bass, and hybrid sunfish. <br> \n <br> \nDevelopment pressure is increasing around the shorelines and within the watershed on Minnesota lakes.  This can degrade water quality and impact valuable shoreline habitat.  Native shoreline vegetation provides habitat for fish and wildlife, filters harmful nutrients, and protects against shoreline erosion.  Lakeshore owners can minimize their impact on the shoreline and maintain a more natural setting while actually decreasing annual maintenance.
