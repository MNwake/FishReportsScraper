                "narrative": "<p>Blue Lake is located seven miles northeast of Park Rapids in Hubbard County.  Blue Lake has a surface area of 324 acres and a maximum depth of 84 feet.  There is a state-owned public access with a concrete ramp located on the northwest shore of the lake.  Blue Lake is a beautiful lake with exceptionally clear water and a sandy shoreline.  Blue Lake has a good walleye population and gives anglers a chance at a real trophy fish.  A bonus rainbow trout population is also present in Blue Lake.The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical and chemical characteristics.  Blue Lake is in lake class 23.  Other area lakes in this same classification include: Boot (eastern Becker County), East Crooked (north of Nevis), and Eleventh Crow Wing (north of Akley).Blue Lake has an excellent walleye population, both in terms of numbers and size of fish.  Walleye were sampled in good numbers (15.3 walleye/gillnet), above the current management goal of 10.0 walleye/gillnet.  Walleye abundance in past surveys has also been high.  Sampled walleye had an average length and weight of 19.3 inches and 3.25 pounds with fish measured up to 31.3 inches.  The abundant walleye population in Blue Lake is the result of an aggressive and successful stocking program by the DNR.  Age analysis from present and past surveys has shown that the majority of the sampled walleye correspond to stocked years.  Blue Lake is currently stocked with walleye fingerlings in even years.  Abundant yellow perch and tullibee (cisco) populations provide an excellent forage base for the growth of larger walleye.Since 1986 Blue Lake has been stocked biannually with rainbow trout yearlings during odd numbered years (4,000 trout).  Only one rainbow trout was sampled during the 2004 survey (22.2 inches and 5.3 pounds).  Very few rainbow trout have been sampled in past surveys.  The success of rainbow trout management on Blue Lake and whether a \"successful\" fishery has been established is in question.  Angler feedback on rainbow trout fishing has been limited.  Other than a few reports of dock anglers catching trout in the spring after the lake has been stocked or an occasional large trout taken by a walleye angler, little rainbow trout fishing is taking place.  Allowing a winter angling season for rainbow trout is being considered.  Any information from anglers on rainbow trout in Blue Lake would be appreciated.Blue Lake does not have much of a panfish fishery due to limited shallow water areas.  Bluegill and pumpkinseed are found in moderate numbers, but size of fish tends to run small due to very slow growth rates.  Black crappie numbers were up compared to past survey.  Black crappie ran small in size, however, crappie up to 13.2 inches were sampled.  Rock bass are very abundant, but small in size.Northern pike, largemouth bass, and smallmouth bass are also present in low numbers.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Blue Lake is located seven miles northeast of Park Rapids in Hubbard County.  Blue Lake has a surface area of 324 acres and a maximum depth of 84 feet.  There is a state-owned public access with a concrete ramp located on the northwest shore of the lake.  Blue Lake is known for its exceptional water clarity and sandy shorelines.  Blue Lake has a good walleye population and gives anglers a chance at a trophy fish.  A bonus rainbow trout population is also present in Blue Lake. <br> \n <br> \nThe Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical and chemical characteristics.  Blue Lake is in lake class 23.  Other area lakes in this same classification include Boot, East Crooked, and Eleventh Crow Wing. <br> \n <br> \nBlue Lake has an excellent walleye population, both in terms of numbers and size of fish.  Walleye were sampled in good numbers (15.0 walleye/gillnet), above the current management goal of 10.0 walleye/gillnet.  Walleye abundance in past surveys has also been high.  Sampled walleye had an average length of 14.6 inches and 1.7 pounds, with fish measured up to 32.4 inches.  The abundant walleye population in Blue Lake is the result of a successful stocking program by the DNR.  Age analysis from present and past surveys has shown that the majority of the sampled walleye correspond to stocked years.  Blue Lake is currently stocked with walleye fingerlings in even numbered years.  Abundant tullibee (cisco) and yellow perch populations provide an excellent forage base for the growth of larger walleye. <br> \n <br> \nBlue Lake is stocked with rainbow trout during odd numbered years (4,860 trout).  Seven rainbow trout were sampled and ranged in size from 12.2 to 15.0 inches.  Rainbow trout stocking began in 1984 and trout have been sampled in low numbers in past surveys.  Blue Lake was opened to winter angling for rainbow trout in 2007.  Angler reports and success for rainbow trout have been limited for both the open water and ice angling season. <br> \nBlue Lake is not known for providing much of a panfish fishery.  While bluegill abundance (33.7 bluegill/net) was up from past surveys, size of fish run small due to slow growth rates.  Anglers will find bluegill and pumpkinseed in the 6 inch size range.  Black crappie are present in low numbers, similar to past surveys. <br> \n <br> \nPresent and past surveys have shown very low northern pike numbers in Blue Lake.  While northern pike numbers are low, the abundant forage base of white sucker and tullibee (cisco) can produce some big pike.

The average weight was 2.1 pounds with 64% in the 15 to 22 inch range.  Natural reproduction appears poor as only 3 of the 90 walleyes sampled were from non stocked year classes.  Present northern pike numbers are low with large average size.  Historically their numbers have been low with few exceptions.  Their size averaged 28.2 inches and 5.5 pounds.  Largemouth bass were not sufficiently sampled with standard survey gear to assess their abundance, growth or size structure.  Black crappie have also been sampled in low numbers with standard survey gear.  Bluegill were sampled in low numbers and they show a small size structure.  No bluegill sampled were over 7.1 inches.  Yellow perch abundance was above normal range for lakes of this type and should provide an excellent forage base.  Tullibee abundance was within the interquartile range for this lake class and should offer another excellent forage base.  Rainbow trout have been sampled in low numbers in spite of being stocked during odd years and offer additional angling opportunities. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Blue Lake is located seven miles northeast of Park Rapids in Hubbard County.  Blue Lake has a surface area of 324 acres and a maximum depth of 84 feet.  There is a state-owned public access with a concrete ramp located on the northwest shore of the lake.  Blue Lake is a beautiful lake with exceptionally clear water and a sandy shoreline.  Blue Lake is known for its walleye fishery, and especially for a chance at a real trophy fish.  A bonus rainbow trout population is also present in Blue Lake. The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical and chemical characteristics.  Blue Lake is in lake class 23.  Other area lakes in this same classification include: Boot (eastern Becker County), East Crooked (five miles north of Nevis), and Eleventh Crow Wing (north of Akeley).Blue Lake has an excellent walleye population, both in terms of numbers and \"quality\" of fish.  The walleye catch rate was high (10.5 walleye/gillnet), and similar to the three previous surveys in 1988, 1991, and 1994.  Walleye were large-sized with an average length and weight of 17.7 inches and 2.5 pounds.  Walleye up to 30.2 inches were sampled.  The abundant walleye population in Blue Lake is the result of a successful fingerling stocking program.  Walleye from stocked years accounted for 94% of the sample (102 fish).  Blue Lake is stocked with walleye fingerlings in even years.  Important walleye forage species such as yellow perch and tullibee (cisco) were sampled in moderate numbers.  The yellow perch population in Blue Lake is primarily a forage base for the walleye, but a few fish are of an acceptable size to provide a limited fishery.Since 1986 Blue Lake has been stocked biannually with rainbow trout yearlings in odd years (4,000 trout).  Four rainbow trout were sampled during the 1999 survey and ranged in length from 12.8 to 23.4 inches.  Very few rainbow trout have been sampled in past surveys.  A 6 pound 11 oz rainbow trout was taken in July of 1999 by an area angler.  The success of rainbow troutmanagement on Blue Lake and whether a \"successful\" fishery has been established is in question.  Other than a few reports of dock anglers catching trout in the spring after the lake has been stocked or an occasional large trout taken by a walleye angler, little rainbow trout fishing is taking place.  Whether rainbow trout stocking should be increased to every year or discontinued is consideration for future management.  Clearly the rainbow trout fishery in Blue Lake is not as successful as a rainbow trout fishery at nearby Bad Medicine Lake.Blue Lake does not have much of a panfish fishery.  Bluegill and pumpkinseed are found in low to moderate numbers, but size of fish is small.  Black crappie and largemouth bass are present in low numbers.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Catch rates of walleye (8.00 fish/gillnet and 10.58 lbs/gillnet) were above the third quartile for lake class 23 of the Schupp Classification System.  Density has fluctuated from 2.50 fish/gillnet in 1986 to 16.25 fish/gillnet in 1988.  Mean weight of walleye sampled in 1991 was 1.32 lbs.  The present PSD (41), RSD-P (3) and RSD-M (3) indicate a fair size structure, the problem lying in the lack of preffered length fish.  Walleye growth rates are slow and variable.  The overall mean length at age 5 is 14.17 inches, but the individual year class mean lengths at age 5 range from 10.90 to 15.28 inches.  This variability may be the result of stocking different sizes of fingerlings as a complement to natural recruits.  Walleye in Blue Lake are capable of natural reproduction, as evidenced by the 1987 year class.Numbers of northern pike sampled (0.75 fish/gillnet) fell below the first quartile, while 9.45 lbs/gillnet was within the normal range.  These numbers result in a high mean weight, of 12.60 lbs.  Both numbers and sizes of northern pike have fluctuated from below normal to normal since 1957.  Northern pike exhibit good growth, averaging 26.83 inches at age 5.  Recruitment appears poor and may be limited by the lack of suitable spawning areas.  No fish sampled were from year classes more recent than 1984.Largemouth bass, black crappie and pumpkinseed catches were within the normal ranges for lakes of this classification.  Both largemouth bass and black crappie abundances were below the first quartile in 1957 and have fluctuated generally within the normal ranges since that time.  The exception is largemouth bass numbers which were above the third quartile in 1971 and 1984.  Pumpkinseed density has changed little since 1971, when it showed a sharp decrease over 1957.  Size structure of pumpkinseed (PSD=27), bluegill (PSD=14) and yellow perch (PSD=17) are very small.  This is apparent in the bluegill catch rates.  Numbers per trapnet (10.20) was within the normal range, but 1.04 lbs/trapnet was below the first quartile.  Bluegill catch rates have been below the first quartile since 1984, when they decreased substantially over the previous surveys.  Yellow perch catches were above the third quartile in 1991 and have shown an upward trend since 1957.White sucker catch rates were above the third quartile in 1991 and usually have been since 1957.  Cisco catches were below the first quartile for lakes of this class.  Abundances have decreased since 1957 and no cisco were sampled in 1986 and 1988.  Rock bass numbers have generally been decreasing since 1957, but still remained above the third quartile in 1991.  Brown bullhead was the only bullhead species sampled in 1991, however, both black and yellow bullhead have been sampled in the past.  Brown bullhead catches were near the first quartile in 1991.Rainbow trout stocking began in 1984, however, the population status has been difficult to monitor.  One gillnet set in deep water yielded no rainbow trout and only one was caught in the regular net sets.  Anglers have also provided little data on numbers or sizes caught.</p>",

Natural reproduction of walleye very good, and should provide a year class under normal spawning conditions.  Stocking of walleye fingerlings or fry not needed at the present time.  Northern pike could be stocked from winter rescue projects to provide a better fishery of this specie.  The survey indicates this specie down from the last survey; therefore, with the high tullibee and minnow population, the stocking of northern pike would provide extra fish to the angler.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Blue Lake is located seven miles northeast of Park Rapids in Hubbard County.  Blue Lake has a surface area of 336 acres and a maximum depth of 84 feet.  There is a state-owned public access with a concrete ramp located on the northwest shore of the lake.  Blue Lake is known for its exceptional water clarity and sandy shorelines.  Blue Lake has a good Walleye population and gives anglers a chance at a trophy fish.  A bonus Rainbow Trout population is also present in the lake.   <br> \n <br> \nThe Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical and chemical characteristics.  Blue Lake is in lake class 23.  Class 23 lakes are characterized by having hard water, deep basins, and very high water clarity.  Other area lakes in this same classification include Boot, East Crooked, and Eleventh Crow Wing. <br> \n <br> \nBlue Lake has an excellent Walleye population, both in terms of numbers and size of fish.  Walleye abundance (10.2 Walleye/gill net) was similar to recent surveys.  Sampled Walleye had an average length and weight of 13.6 inches and 1.3 pounds, with fish measured up to 30.7 inches.  The abundant Walleye population in Blue Lake is the result of a successful stocking program by the DNR.  Age analysis from present and past surveys has shown that the majority of the sampled Walleye correspond to stocked years.  Blue Lake is stocked with Walleye fingerlings in even numbered years.  Abundant Tullibee (Cisco) and Yellow Perch populations provide an excellent forage base for the growth of larger Walleye.  Anglers will find a few Yellow Perch of an acceptable size for fishing. <br> \n <br> \nBlue Lake is stocked with Rainbow Trout during odd numbered years.  No Rainbow Trout were sampled in the 2014 survey.  Rainbow Trout stocking began in 1984 and trout have been sampled in low numbers in past surveys.  Blue Lake was opened to winter angling in 2007.  Angler reports and success for Rainbow Trout have been limited for both the open water and ice angling season. <br> \n <br> \nPresent and past surveys have shown very low Northern Pike numbers in Blue Lake.  While Northern Pike abundance is low, the abundant forage base of Tullibee (Cisco), White Sucker, and Yellow Perch can produce some big Northern Pike.  Northern pike up to 36.3 inches were sampled. <br> \n <br> \nBlue Lake is not known for providing much of a Panfish fishery.  Bluegill abundance was up from past surveys; however, size of fish runs small due to slow growth rates.  Anglers will find Bluegill and Pumpkinseed in the 6 inch size range.  Present and past surveys have shown Blue Lake to have a low Black Crappie population.  While numbers are low, anglers will find larger sized Black Crappie are present. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass and Smallmouth Bass populations are also present in Blue Lake in low numbers when compared to surrounding lakes.  Largemouth Bass are the more common of the two species, while Smallmouth Bass present in very low numbers.   <br> \n <br> \nCurrently no aquatic invasive species (AIS) have been identified in Blue Lake. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access. <br> \n</p>",

Park Rapids Fisheries staff conducted a survey targeting near shore fish species on July 3, 2019 to assess populations of non-game and small sport fish.  Ten 100-foot sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake shore, sampling a variety of habitat types.  Each site was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot 1/8th-inch mesh seine, depending on habitat conditions.   <br> \n <br> \nDuring this assessment, six sites were sampled with a 50-foot seine and four sites were sampled with a 15-foot seine. Backpack electrofishing was done at all 10 sites.  Nearshore sampling captured fifteen species of fish including three species intolerant of disturbance; Banded Killifish, Blacknose Shiner, and Blackchin Shiner.  Other species sampled during the nearshore effort included Bluegill, Bluntnose Minnow, Common Shiner, Iowa Darter, Johnny Darter, Largemouth Bass, Mimic Shiner, Molted Sculpin, Pumpkinseed, Rock Bass, Tadpole Madtom, and Yellow Perch.  Nearshore catches will be used along with gill net and trap net catch data from a standard fisheries survey conducted on August 5, 2019, to calculate a fish-based Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) score, which is indicative of the health of Blue Lake.   <br> \n <br> \nThis survey is contributing to a watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.  Blue Lake is located in the Crow Wing River Watershed.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Blue Lake is located seven miles northeast of Park Rapids in Hubbard County.   Blue Lake has a surface area of 336 acres and a maximum depth of 84 feet.  There is a state-owned public access with a concrete ramp located on the northwest shore of the lake.   Blue Lake is known for its exceptional water clarity and sandy shorelines.  Blue Lake has a very good Walleye population and gives anglers a chance at a trophy sized fish.  Rainbow Trout are stocked in the lake and can provide a bonus fishery. <br> \n <br> \nThe Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical and chemical characteristics.  Blue Lake is in lake class 23.  Class 23 lakes are characterized by having hard water, deep basins, and very high water clarity.   Other area lakes in this same classification include Boot, East Crooked, and Eleventh Crow Wing. <br> \n <br> \nBlue Lake has an excellent Walleye population, both in terms of numbers and size of fish.  Walleye abundance has been high the past several surveys.  Good numbers of Walleye in the 14 to 18 inch size range were sampled with fish measured up to 31.4 inches.  An abundant Tullibee (Cisco) population provides an excellent forage base for the growth of larger Walleye.  However, Yellow Perch, an important forage species for Walleye were sampled in low numbers compared to past surveys. <br> \n <br> \nBlue Lake is stocked in the fall with Rainbow Trout fingerlings during even numbered years.  Four Rainbow Trout were sampled in the survey and ranged in length from 11.5 to 17.7 inches.  Rainbow Trout stocking began in 1984 and trout have been sampled in low numbers in past surveys.  Blue Lake was open to winter angling in 2007.  Angler reports and success for Rainbow Trout have been limited for both the open water and ice angling season. <br> \n <br> \nWhile not known for Panfish, Blue Lake does support populations of Black Crappie, Bluegill, and Pumpkinseed.   Anglers will find low to moderate numbers of Black Crappie, with a few larger fish present.  A moderate Bluegill and Pumpkinseed populations are present in Blue Lake, however, size of fish run small, with few fish over 7.0 inches sampled. <br> \n  <br> \nLargemouth Bass and Smallmouth Bass populations are also present in Blue Lake in low numbers when compared to surrounding lakes.  Largemouth Bass are the more common of the two species, while Smallmouth Bass are present in low numbers. <br> \n <br> \nPresent and past surveys have shown very low Northern Pike numbers in Blue Lake.  Northern Pike were not sampled in the 2019 survey.  While Northern Pike abundance is low, the abundant forage base of Tullibee (Cisco) and White Sucker can produce some big Northern Pike. <br> \n <br> \nCurrently no aquatic invasive species (AIS) have been identified in Blue Lake.  To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>As compared with the statewide figures, the net catches indicate that there are (1) populations of tullibee, common sucker, walleye, pumpkinseed, bluegill, and rock bass that are more than twice the statewide average and (2) below average populations of northern pike, yellow perch, bullhead, largemouth bass, and black crappie.As compared with the statewide figures, the growth rates of the (1) northern pike appear to be adequate and (2) walleye, pumpkinseed, and bluegill appear to be below average.Discussion and Summary:Test netting indicates that Blue Lake is supporting large populations of gamefish and panfish species.  Walleye and panfish growth is slow, which is probable the result of dense populations in a lake which has only a small area of productive littoral zone.Fish Stocking:Walleye stocking has probably contributed to the present large population of walleye.  In view of the high abundance and somewhat retarded growth of this species it is recommended that walleye stocking be discontinued until the need for additional stocking can be demonstrated.  Northern pike stocking is recommended.Stocking Record:Stocking records show that during the period 1910 to 1945 walleye, northern pike, lake trout, and bass were stocked.  The stocking records for the past ten years are as follows:Species\t\tSize\t\tNumbers\t\tYearWalleye fry\t\t140,000\t\t1946Walleye fingerling\t\t  3,300\t\t1946\t\tWalleye fingerling\t\t  4,080\t\t1947Walleye fingerling\t\t 26,928\t\t1948Walleye fingerling\t\t 13,200\t\t1952Walleye yearling\t\t    112\t\t1952Walleye fingerling\t\t  8,820\t\t1954Walleye fingerling\t\t 36,152\t\t1955Local Fishing Report:The method of fishing most commonly used in this lake are trolling and still-fishing with minnows for walleye.The angling success for the current season has been good for walleye.Largemouth bass fishing had been good in past years but has been on a decline.  The fish most commonly caught and listed in order of occurence are walleye, rock bass, largemouth bass, and northern pike.Aquatic Plants:Submerged aquatic plants were observed to be quite common along most of the shoreline.  No emergent vegetation was observed during the survey.Common species of submerged aquatic plants observed during the survey are Canada waterweed, and largeleaf and floatingleaf pondweeds.Submerged plants were observed growing at 25 feet in depth.</p>",
