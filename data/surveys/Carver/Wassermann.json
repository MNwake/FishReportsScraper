                "narrative": "<p>Wasserman is a productive lake in Carver County near the city of Victoria.  There is a DNR-owned public access on the north side of the lake that has a concrete ramp with dock and limited parking.  Wasserman is managed for northern pike, largemouth bass, and bluegill.  Tiger muskellunge have previously been stocked, however this has ceased.  The last tiger muskellunge stocking was fingerlings in 2006.   A fish population assessment was conducted during early August 2011 to determine the size structure and abundance of game fish species in the lake. <br> \n <br> \nThe northern pike population is at a moderate level (2.83/gill net).  Historically pike density has been low in Wasserman, averaging 1.6 per net over the previous 3 assessments.  Northern pike in the gill nets averaged 24.2 inches long and 3.4 lbs, with the largest reaching 33.5 inches and 7.5 lbs.  Seventy-one percent were longer than 21 inches and 18% were longer than 28 inches.  Fish condition was good, with the larger fish showing a greater condition factor than the smaller.  Northern pike ranged in age from 3 through 7, with the majority ages 3 (29% of total sampled) and 5 (48% of total sampled).  Growth was average up to age 3, and then it increased for older year classes.  Pike averaged 18.7 inches by age 3, and 25.5 inches by age 5. <br> \n <br> \nFall daytime boat electrofishing was used to sample the largemouth bass population.  A total of 45 largemouth bass were collected at a rate of 23.2 per hour.  Average length and weight were 11.2 inches and 1.2 lbs, with the largest reaching 21.4 inches and 4.8 lbs.  Forty-two percent were 12 inches or greater, 22% were 15 inches or greater, and 2% were 21 inches or greater.  Bass condition was good and consistent for all sizes.  The bass sampled ranged in age from 1 to 10 and were relatively evenly distributed among all year classes.  Growth was near statewide averages, where bass reached 9.0 inches by age 3, 14.7 inches by age 6, and 19.7 inches by age 9.         <br> \n <br> \nBluegill abundance is high as they were collected in trap nets at a rate of 56.6 per net.  Bluegill abundance and size has fluctuated over the previous assessments (1992 to present) ranging from 5.7 to 109.0 per net and 0.12 to 0.21 lbs.  In 2011, bluegill averaged 6.5 inches and 0.21 lbs, with the largest reaching 7.7 inches and 0.34 lbs.  Ninety percent were 6 inches or greater.  Body condition was good and consistent across all sizes.  Bluegill ranged in age from 1 to 5; with 56% age 4 and 28% age 5.  Growth was fast through age 3, then became average for older year classes.  Age 3 fish averaged 5.7 inches, and age 5 fish averaged 7.0 inches.     <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie were highly abundant in both gill nets (42.7/net) and trap nets (26.9/net).  Like bluegill abundance, black crappie abundance has fluctuated over previous assessments (1992 to present).  Compared to the previous survey in 2005, black crappie abundance in gill nets is down (101.6/ net in 2005); however catch rate is up in trap nets (3.7/net in 2005).  In trap nets, black crappie averaged 7.9 inches and 0.26 pounds, with the largest measuring 9.0 inches and 0.38 lbs.  In both sampling gears, eighty-eight percent were 5 inches or longer and 42% were 8 inches or longer.  Black crappie condition was good but decreased in larger fish.  Ages ranged from 1 through 6.  The most abundant year class was 2008 (46% of the total), followed by 2007 (24% of the total) and 2010 (19% of the total).  Growth was fast through age 3, and then began to slow in older year classes. Black crappie averaged 7.4 inches by age 3 and 8.4 inches by age 4.    <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch were moderately abundant in the gill nets (15.8/net).  This catch rate is the highest on record and well above the previous assessment (2.6/net in 2005).  Average length and weight were 7.3 inches 0.17 lbs, with the largest reaching 8.6 inches and 0.26 lbs.  Nineteen percent were 8 inches or greater.  Fish condition was moderate compared to other species in the lake.  Ages ranged from 1 through 5; however the 2007 year class dominated the sample (79% of the total).  Growth was similar to statewide averages.  Yellow perch averaged 6.4 inches by age 3 and 7.6 inches by age 4.  <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled in low abundance in the gill nets and trap nets were black bullhead, bowfin (dogfish), common carp, golden shiner, hybrid sunfish, and pumpkinseed.  The 2011 assessment was the first time a white bass has been sampled in Wasserman Lake; it was a 14-inch 1.4-lb adult.  One tiger muskellunge was sampled at 39.4 inches and 16.2 lbs.       <br> \n <br> \nAn assessment of fish in the shallow nearshore habitats was also conducted using backpack electrofishing and seining.  Eighteen species were sampled, the three most abundant were bluegill, golden shiner, and green sunfish.  Other species not found in the gill nets and trap nets were Iowa darter, Johnny darter, bluntnose minnow, central mudminnow, fathead minnow, yellow bullhead, spotfin shiner, and blackchin shiner.  The purpose of the nearshore sampling is to calculate an Index of Biotic Integrity score.  An Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) is estimated based on all fish sampled in this assessment.  The absence of sensitive species such as minnows and darters contribute to a low IBI score.  Wasserman Lake scored 74.5 out of a maximum of 160, indicating possible water quality and habitat impairment. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Wasserman is a productive, Class 24 lake located in Carver County near the city of Victoria.  There is a DNR-owned public access on the north side of the lake that has a concrete ramp with dock and limited parking.  Wasserman is managed for Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, and Bluegill.  Hybrid (tiger) Muskellunge have previously been stocked (from 1988 through 2006); however this management has been ceased.  A Standard Survey was conducted during early August 2016 to determine the size structure and abundance of game fish species in the lake. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike abundance is moderately high (6.5/gill net).  Northern Pike in the gill nets averaged 24.9 inches long and 3.66 lb, with the largest reaching 36.2 inches.  Seventy-nine percent were longer than 21 inches and 28 percent were longer than 28 inches.  Northern Pike ranged in age from 2 through 6, with the majority age 2 (38 percent).  Pike averaged 21.4 inches by age 3, and 28.1 inches by age 5. <br> \n <br> \nNighttime boat electrofishing was used to sample the Largemouth Bass population during spring.  A total of 105 Largemouth Bass were collected at a rate of 61.7 per hour of on-time.  Average length and weight were 11.6 inches and 1.2 lb, with the largest reaching 20.5 inches.  Forty-six percent were 12 inches or greater, and 27 percent were 15 inches or greater.  The bass ranged in age from 1 through 9.  Growth was near statewide averages, where bass reached 8.5 inches by age 3, 14.7 inches by age 6, and 18.4 inches by age 9.         <br> \n <br> \nBluegill abundance is high as they were collected in trap nets at a rate of 74.4 fish per net.  In 2016, Bluegill averaged 6.0 inches and 0.17 lb, with the largest reaching 8.7 inches.  Fifty-seven percent were 6 inches or greater.  Bluegill ranged in age from 1 through 7.  Bluegill growth was moderately fast in 2016.  Age 3 fish averaged 5.8 inches, and age 5 fish averaged 7.3 inches.     <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie were highly abundant in both gill nets (32.0/net) and trap nets (32.0/net), and their size was small.  In trap nets, Black Crappie averaged 6.7 inches and 0.17 pounds, with the largest measuring 10.2 inches.  In gill nets, Black Crappie averaged 6.4 inches and 0.14 pounds, with the largest measuring 9.6 inches.  In both sampling gears, only 9.6 percent of the fish exceeded 8 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch were moderately abundant in the gill nets (7.0/net).  Average length and weight were 6.4 inches 0.11 lb, with the largest reaching 8.0 inches. Only 2 percent were 8 inches or greater.  The majority (79 percent) of the perch were between 6 and 7 inches long.   <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled in low abundance in the gill nets and trap nets were Black Bullhead, Bowfin (dogfish), Common Carp, Golden Shiner, Yellow Bullhead and Pumpkinseed.  No Hybrid (tiger) Muskellunge- which would be at least 11 years old- were sampled. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Wasserman Lake, located in Carver County near the city of Victoria is a 153-acre bass/panfish class lake.  A fish population assessment was due as the last survey was in August of 1999.The catch of 101.6 black crappie per gillnet is over 6 times the 75th percentile level.  The crappie gill net sample averaged 5.9 inches and 0.09 pounds.  The decrease in average size compared to 1999 is influenced by the influx of young fish.  The 2004 year-class of Age-I crappies is strong and constituted 49% of the crappie catch.  The largest individual caught was 9.1 inches and 18% of the trapnet sample was over 8 inches in length.  Growth rates were about average.Hybrid or tiger muskellunge are infrequently sampled with standard survey gear, however, 2 were sampled in this survey.  The mean length and weight from combined gear-types was 33.0 inches and 8.1 pounds.  Relative weight averaged 86.  A relative weight value of 100 indicates 75th percentile condition or plumpness, above average condition, for the species.  Both originated from the 2001 stocking (4 years old).  Growth rates were slightly below average.  Hybrid muskellunge are stocked triennially at a rate of 2 fish per littoral acre (224 fish/3 years).Northern pike are less abundant larger and older than they were in the 1999 survey.  The catch of 1.2 per gillnet is just below 25th percentile levels for this lake type.  Mean length and weight is 27.6 inches and 4.9 pounds.  Relative weight averaged 86.  Pike average age is 3.9 years due to a strong 2001 year-class (constituting 50% of the sample).  The catch of 17.0 bluegill per trapnet is between 25th percentile and median levels.  Most of the population originates from the 2001 to 2003 year-classes (93%).  Bluegill averaged 5.60 inches and 0.12 pounds.  The largest bluegill sampled was 7.4 inches.  Growth rates were about average for this lake type.Largemouth bass are not well sampled in survey nets.  However, data from a small sample indicate Wasserman bass abundance is near median levels and size structure is good.  Bass averaged 1.6 pounds with the largest bass sampled being 16.8 inches and 2.62 pounds.  Relative weight averaged 105.Yellow perch were sampled near 25th percentile levels for this lake type and averaged 6.0 inches.  Carp are very abundant in Wasserman due, in part, to the availability of spawning habitat.  Bowfin, black bullhead, and yellow bullhead were also sampled in this survey.</p>",

The average size individual was 25.6 inches (4.4 lbs.) for northern pike and 22.8 inches (5.0 lbs.) for walleye. Growth rate for both species is good. Two Hybrid Muskellunge were also captured, the largest of which was 34.4 inches long and 10.0 pounds. Largemouth bass were captured in relatively low numbers and small average size, but growth rate is above average. Black crappie and bluegill were captured in abundant numbers and exhibited good growth rates for both species. Average lengths sampled were 6.4 inches and 6.8 inches for bluegill and black crappie, respectively. Above average growth rates were exhibited for pumpkinseed sunfish and yellow perch. Both species were sampled within normal ranges for abundance. Average length of sampled yellow perch and pumpkinseed sunfish is 6.9 and 5.5 inches respectively. Carp and black bullhead are present in very high numbers but both species averaged less than 8.0 inches in length. Brown and yellow bullhead are also present and average about 10.0 inches long, but are far less abundant that black bullhead.</p>",

Mean length for sampled black crappie was 7.8 inches and the average rate was 4.0 fish/pound. Bluegill also exhibited a significant decline in abundance since 1993. The average length of bluegill was 5.2 inches (8.7 fish/pound) and only 40 percent of sampled fish measured 6 inches or more. A potentially big year class of young-of-the-year bluegill was observed in the natural reproduction check by shoreline seining. No pumpkinseed sunfish were captured in the 1999 survey. Yellow perch exhibited a less significant decline in since 1993. The present level of almost 10 fish per gill net is still historically the second highest ever observed for this lake. The average length for sampled perch was 6.1 inches. Northern pike sampling abundance showed no change since 1993, however, the average size of gill net sampled pike dropped from 4.4 (25.6\") to 2.6 (23.3\") pounds in that time. Growth rates for sampled northern pike, bluegill, black crappie, and yellow perch were found to be very good. No hybrid muskies or walleyes were captured during this survey. Carp were sampled in above average levels of abundance with the average size fis being 20.1 inches and 3.6 pounds. All three species of bullhead were captured during this survey, with black bullheads exhibiting the highest level of abundance (71/gill net).</p>",

There is a DNR-owned public access on the north side of the lake that has a concrete ramp with a dock and limited parking.  Wasserman is managed for Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, and Bluegill.  A Standard Survey was conducted 2020 to assess the gamefish populations. <br> \n <br> \nMost noticeable in 2020 was the very high abundance of Black Crappie. The vast majority of the fish were between 7.5 and 9.5 inches.  There is good opportunity for crappie harvest on this lake both now and during the next few years as the fish grow.  Bluegill were also present in high numbers, and their sizes were good as well; 32% of the sampled fish exceeded 7 inches.  The largest Bluegill measured was 8.5 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike tend to be modestly sized and abundant in Wasserman, however a few larger fish were present in the 2020 survey.  Half of the sampled fish were smaller than 22 inches, so this could be a good lake for the harvest-oriented angler.  While only 17% of the fish exceeded 26 inches, the largest fish measured was 34.5 inches.  With a few larger fish present, and many smaller ones available, Wasserman offers a good opportunity for Northern Pike harvest, with the potential for some larger fish.   <br> \n <br> \nAlthough standard bass sampling was not conducted in 2020, the lake is known for its strong Largemouth Bass population.  During the last survey, in 2016, the largest bass sampled was 20.5 inches and 27% of the catch exceeded 15 inches.  In 2020, bass incidentally caught in the gill nets in trap nets indicated that the population continues to support large fish.  The largest Largemouth Bass encountered in 2020 was 19.7 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nOverall, Wasserman supports strong populations of Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, and panfish.  Other species sampled in low abundance were Black Bullhead, Bowfin (dogfish), Brown Bullhead, Golden Shiner, Yellow Bullhead, Yellow Perch, and Pumpkinseed.   <br> \n <br> \n</p>",
