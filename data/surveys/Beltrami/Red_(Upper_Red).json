                "narrative": "<p>Upper Red Lake is a 120,000 acre lake, 60% (72,000 acres) of which is under the jurisdiction of the Red Lake Band of Chippewa Indians (Red Lake Band). The remaining 40% (48,000 acres) falls under the jurisdiction of the State of Minnesota. The collapse of the Red Lakes walleye population in the mid 1990's has been well documented. Similarly, the cooperative recovery effort that included a total closure on walleye harvest, a short-term walleye fry stocking program, intensified population monitoring, and increased law enforcement efforts has been widely publicized.  In 2006, the Red Lakes were re-opened to walleye fishing under a conservative set of harvest regulations. Walleye harvest allocations, as outlined in the harvest management plan, are based on the proportion of surface water acreage within each jurisdiction. Specific fishing methods and regulations for managing harvest within the allocations are determined individually within each jurisdiction. In state waters of Upper Red Lake, a two-fish possession limit in combination with a 17-26 inch protected slot length limit (PSL; only one fish over 26 inches allowed in possession) was initially implemented for walleye. Over the several few years, regulations were incrementally relaxed. Regulations for the past three seasons have been consistent: a 4-fish bag limit, and a 17-26 inch PSL for the winter season and the open-water season until June 14th, followed by a temporary slot adjustment (20-26 inch PSL) from mid-June through the end of November.  This slot adjustment has increased fishing pressure during mid-summer and increased harvest for this time period compared to previous years.  In addition to special walleye regulations, a special harvest regulation for northern pike has been in place since the 2006 fishing opener.  The regulation from 2006 through 2010 was a 26-40 inch PSL (only one fish over 40 inches allowed in possession) and beginning with the 2011 fishing season opener, this slot limit was widened to a 26-44 inch protected slot (only one fish over 44 inches allowed in possession) to increase protection for large pike. <br> \n <br> \nPresent Fish Population Status  <br> \nThe 2011 walleye gill net catch-per-effort (CPE) was 45.2 per gill net, which is much greater than the 2010 catch rate (27.7 walleye/net).  Overall walleye density peaked in 2003 and after declining for the next few years, walleye biomass is again approaching record-levels observed in 2003.  Walleye from age 0 (young of year) to age 12 were sampled with the oldest fish representing the 1999 year class.  Approximately 78% of the walleye sample consisted of fish younger than age-6, which are entirely the result of natural reproduction.  Sixty-four percent of the 2011 gill net sample was between 12 and 17 inches and 44% of the sample was between 14 and 17 inches.  This size distribution suggests that fishing and the ability to find \"keeper\" walleyes should be good for the foreseeable future.  Northern pike CPE was 1.0 fish per gill net in 2011, which is similar to recent years and only slightly below the long-term median of 1.7 fish/net.  The average size of northern pike caught in gill nets has been stable over the past eight years with a nice mixture of sizes \u0013 including fish up to 44 inches.  Yellow perch CPE increased from 7.6 fish per gill net in 2009 to 12.5 fish/net in 2010 to 20.1 fish/net in 2011. This marks the third year of improved gill net catch.  Heavy predation on juvenile perch for several years reduced their numbers to levels that were beginning to become a concern.  However, there has been at least some measureable recruitment each year since 2006 and the 2007, 2008, and 2009 year classes are shaping up to be moderate to strong.  Growth rates of yellow perch in Upper Red Lake are good and 50% of the yellow perch catch was greater than 8 inches in length.  The black crappie gill net catch rate was below the long-term median and, coupled with creel survey data, all indications are that the \"crappie boom\" is over and this species has returned to lower levels of abundance. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Upper Red Lake is a 120,000 acre lake, 60% (72,000 acres) of which is under the jurisdiction of the Red Lake Band of Chippewa Indians (Red Lake Band). The remaining 40% (48,000 acres) falls under the jurisdiction of the State of Minnesota. The collapse of the Red Lakes walleye population in the mid 1990's has been well documented. Similarly, the cooperative recovery effort that included a total closure on walleye harvest, a short-term walleye fry stocking program, intensified population monitoring, and increased law enforcement efforts has been widely publicized.  In 2006, the Red Lakes were re-opened to walleye fishing under a conservative set of harvest regulations. Walleye harvest allocations, as outlined in the harvest management plan, are based on the proportion of surface water acreage within each jurisdiction. Specific fishing methods and regulations for managing harvest within the allocations are determined individually within each jurisdiction. In state waters of Upper Red Lake, a two-fish possession limit in combination with a 17-26 inch protected slot length limit (PSL; only one fish over 26 inches allowed in possession) was initially implemented for walleye. Over several years, regulations have been incrementally relaxed. In 2012, the fishing regulation included: a 4-fish bag limit, and a 17-26 inch PSL from the Fishing Opener until June 14th, followed by a slot adjustment (20-26 inch PSL) from mid-June through the end of the fishing season in February.  Fishing regulations for the 2013 open-water season will remain the same and continuation of the 20-26 inch PSL through the winter season is likely.  In addition to special walleye regulations, a special harvest regulation for northern pike has been in place since the 2006 fishing opener.  The regulation from 2006 through 2010 was a 26-40 inch PSL (only one fish over 40 inches allowed in possession) and beginning with the 2011 fishing season opener, this slot limit was widened to a 26-44 inch protected slot (only one fish over 44 inches allowed in possession) to increase protection for large pike. <br> \n <br> \nPresent Fish Population Status  <br> \nThe 2012 walleye gill net catch-per-effort (CPE) was a record-high 60.8 per gill net.  After restoration efforts, walleye density initially peaked in 2003 and slowly declined over the next few years. Current walleye biomass is now record high, largely due to the incredibly strong 2009 year class.  Walleye from 13 different age classes from ages 1 to 15 were sampled with the oldest fish representing the 1997 year class.  Approximately 96% of the walleye sample consisted of fish younger than age 7. Since no walleye stocking has occurred since 2005, those fish are entirely the result of natural reproduction.  Sixty-two percent of the 2012 gill net catch was between 12 and 17 inches and 40% of the was between 14 and 17 inches.  This size distribution suggests that fishing and the ability to find \"keeper\" walleyes should be good for the foreseeable future.   <br> \nNorthern pike CPE was 2.1 fish per gill net in 2012, which is higher than recent years and slightly above the long-term median of 1.7 fish/net. Low pike density is a desirable condition for lakes such as Upper Red that are being managed for quality pike.  An ice-out trap net assessment in 2012 captured approximately 1,000 northern pike with the largest fish approaching 46 inches and 7.3% of female fish over 40 inches.  Yellow perch CPE in 2012 (17.4 fish/net) was similar to the median 17.5 fish/net.  <br> \nYellow perch population abundance has returned to pre-walleye collapse levels after going through a period of low abundance during the 2000s.  Growth rates of yellow perch in Upper Red Lake are good and 33% of the yellow perch catch was greater than 9 inches in length and 14% were over 10 inches.  This has resulted in increased angling success with some anglers putting together catches of nice-sized fish.   <br> \nAge-1 black crappie have been documented in each of the last three gill net assessments and some fish are starting to reach 8- to 10 inches.  Although these fish represent the first recruitment beyond age 0 since the \"crappie boom\" year classes in the late 1990s, they appear to be of modest strength and don't likely signal the next crappie boom.  However, it is possible that anglers may pick up a few more \"bonus\" crappies while fishing walleyes than they have over the past few years. <br> \n</p>",

The remaining 40% (48,000 acres) falls under the jurisdiction of the State of Minnesota. The collapse of the Red Lakes Walleye population in the mid 1990's has been well documented. Similarly, the cooperative recovery effort that included a total closure on Walleye harvest, a short-term Walleye fry stocking program, intensified population monitoring, and increased law enforcement efforts has been widely publicized.   <br> \n <br> \nIn 2006, the Red Lakes were re-opened to Walleye fishing under a conservative set of harvest regulations. Walleye harvest allocations, as outlined in the harvest management plan, are based on the proportion of surface water acreage within each jurisdiction. Specific fishing methods and regulations for managing harvest within the allocations are determined individually within each jurisdiction. From 2006 when the Walleye fishery was reopened though summer 2015, the Walleye population has been managed with a protected slot limit. In December 2015, the size restriction for Walleye was modified to a \"one over\" regulation that allows the harvest of one fish over a designated size.  This regulation is designed to allow harvest of fish over a broad size range and not focus the harvest on any particular size class of Walleye.   <br> \n <br> \nIn addition to special Walleye regulations, a special harvest regulation for Northern Pike has been in place since the 2006 fishing opener.  The current regulation is a 30 to 40 protected slot limit (PSL) with only one fish allowed over 40 inches. Initially from 2006 through 2010, the special regulation was a 26 to 40 inch PSL with only one fish over 40 inches allowed in possession. In 2011, this slot limit was widened to a 26-44 inch PSL with only one fish over 44 inches allowed in possession, to increase protection for large pike.  The three fish bag limit has remained the same over these years. <br> \n <br> \nPresent Fish Population Status <br> \n  <br> \nThe 2021 Walleye gill net catch rate was 37.6 per gill net.  The incredibly strong 2011 year class has largely phased out of the population which is now dominated by young fish (ages 2 to 4; 12 to 15 inches).  The \"one over 20 inches\" size regulation that will be in place for the 2022 open water season will allow fish from a wide range of year classes to be harvested.  The 2017, 2018, and 2019 year classes are the strongest we have seen since 2011 and will provide most of the fish for harvest.  However, the one over 20 inches regulation will allow harvest of larger fish as well and there is still a good number of fish over 17 inches.  Of course, Upper Red Lake has one of the highest Walleye catch rates in the state, particularly in May and June, and managers are expecting this trend to continue in 2022.  A late ice out further increases the likelihood that the bite will be good.  Getting away from the river mouths early in the season will help you get away from the crowds and that usually helps to find fish too. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike density in Upper Red Lake is low, which is actually a desirable condition for lakes that are being managed for trophy pike.  This low density population produces individuals that reach large sizes (> 40 inches). Recent ice-out trap net assessments have captured Northern Pike up to 44 inches in length with tremendous numbers of fish over 36 inches in length.  The 30- to 40-inch PSL provides a balance of harvest opportunity for eater-sized fish as well as the chance to put a trophy on the wall.  MNDNR has been tagging Northern Pike during the past two years.  Anglers should be on the lookout for these yellow tags that are inserted at the base of the dorsal fin on the left side of the fish.  Anglers who catch a tagged fish should note the tag number and report the catch on the DNR website.  Simply do a search for \"MNDNR fish tag reporting\" and follow the links. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch gill net catch rate in 2021 was 8.8 fish/net.  Yellow Perch population abundance has dropped below average due to increasing Walleye abundance but many fish caught while Walleye fishing will be big enough to keep.  Growth rates of Yellow Perch in Upper Red Lake are excellent; 39% of the 2021 Yellow Perch gill net catch was greater than 9 inches in length.  This has resulted in some anglers putting together decent catches of nice-sized fish.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Background <br> \n <br> \nUpper Red Lake is a 120,000 acre lake, 60% (72,000 acres) of which is under the jurisdiction of the Red Lake Band of Chippewa Indians (Red Lake Band). The remaining 40% (48,000 acres) falls under the jurisdiction of the State of Minnesota. The collapse of the Red Lakes Walleye population in the mid 1990's has been well documented. Similarly, the cooperative recovery effort that included a total closure on Walleye harvest, a short-term Walleye fry stocking program, intensified population monitoring, and increased law enforcement efforts has been widely publicized.  In 2006, the Red Lakes were re-opened to Walleye fishing under a conservative set of harvest regulations. Walleye harvest allocations, as outlined in the harvest management plan, are based on the proportion of surface water acreage within each jurisdiction. Specific fishing methods and regulations for managing harvest within the allocations are determined individually within each jurisdiction. From 2006 when the Walleye fishery was reopened though summer 2015, the Walleye population was managed with a protected slot limit. In December 2015, the size restriction for Walleye was modified to a \"one over\" regulation that allows the harvest of one fish over a designated size.  This regulation is designed to allow harvest of fish over a broad size range and not focus the harvest on any particular size class of Walleye.   <br> \n <br> \nIn addition to special Walleye regulations, a special harvest regulation for Northern Pike has been in place since the 2006 fishing opener.  The regulation from 2006 through 2010 was a 26-40 inch protected slot limit (PSL) with only one fish over 40 inches allowed in possession. Beginning with the 2011 fishing season opener, this slot limit was widened to a 26-44 inch PSL with only one fish over 44 inches allowed in possession, to increase protection for large pike.  The PSL was modified to 30 to 40 inches in 2020.  The three fish bag limit and one fish allowed over the slot remains unchanged. <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nPresent Fish Population Status <br> \n <br> \nThe 2020 Walleye gill net catch-per-effort (CPE) was 43.3 fish per gill net.  The incredibly strong 2011 year class remains prominent in the population though there are considerably more young fish (ages 2 and 3; 12 to 15 inches) in the population now than just a few years ago.  The \"one over 17 inches\" size regulation that will be in place for the 2021 open water season and will allow fish from a wide range of year classes to be harvested.  The 2017 year class is the strongest we have seen since 2011 and these fish, which will open the season near 15 inches, will start pushing the 17 inch mark by the end of the summer.  Good numbers of fish from the 2018 year class is good news for those that fish Upper Red later into the summer as fish of this size (12-13 inches) tend to dominate catches in July and August.  Of course, Upper Red Lake has one of the highest Walleye catch rates in the state, particularly in May and June, and managers are expecting this trend to continue in 2021.  There will be need for a bit of sorting due to the number of fish that are 17 to 18 inches and the \"one over 17 inches\" size regulation, but there are enough different year classes in the population to provide a broad size range from which to harvest fish.  Get away from the river mouths early in the season and you will find more fish under 17 inches. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike density in Upper Red Lake is low, which is actually a desirable condition for lakes that are being managed for trophy pike.  This low density population produces individuals that reach large sizes (> 40 inches) and recent ice-out trap net assessments have captured Northern Pike up to 44 inches in length with tremendous numbers of fish over 36 inches in length.  The 30- to 40-inch PSL provides a balance of harvest opportunity for eater-sized fish as well as the chance to put a trophy on the wall. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch gill net catch rate in 2020 was 13.3 fish per gill net.  Yellow Perch population abundance is near average and many fish caught while Walleye fishing will be big enough to keep.  Growth rates of Yellow Perch in Upper Red Lake are good and 31% of the Yellow Perch catch was greater than 9 inches in length.  This has resulted in some anglers putting together decent catches of nice-sized fish.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Upper Red Lake is a 120,000 acre lake, 60% (72,000 acres) of which is under the jurisdiction of the Red Lake Band of Chippewa Indians (Red Lake Band). The remaining 40% (48,000 acres) falls under the jurisdiction of the State of Minnesota.  Walleye, the primary species sought by anglers, is managed under a cooperative plan with the Red Lake Band that establishes target harvest levels that vary according the mature female population.  As a result, fishing regulations are frequently adjusted to achieve harvest levels within these targets. <br> \n <br> \nThe 2022 Walleye gill net catch rate was 44.7 per gill net.  The incredibly strong 2011 year class has largely phased out of the population which is now dominated by young fish. These young fish are ages 2 to 5 and range from 12 to 17 inches.  The \"one over 17 inches\" size regulation coupled with a five-fish bag limit in place for the 2023 open water season will allow anglers to take advantage of the harvest opportunity presented by the abundance of eater-sized fish.  The 2017, 2018, and 2019 year classes are the strongest we have seen since 2011 and will provide most of the fish for harvest.  However, the one over regulation will allow harvest of larger fish as well and there is still a good number these fish over 17 inches.  Of course, Upper Red Lake has one of the highest Walleye catch rates in the state, particularly in May and June, and managers are expecting this trend to continue in 2023.  A late ice out further increases the likelihood that the bite will be good.  Getting away from the river mouths early in the season will help you get away from the crowds and that usually helps to find fish under 17 inches as well. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike density in Upper Red Lake is low, which is actually a desirable condition for lakes that are being managed for trophy pike.  Recent ice-out trap net assessments have captured Northern Pike up to 44 inches in length with tremendous numbers of fish over 36 inches in length.  The 30- to 40-inch protected slot limit (only one fish allowed over 40 inches) provides a balance of harvest opportunity for eater-sized fish as well as the chance to put a trophy on the wall.  MNDNR has been tagging Northern Pike during the past two years.  Anglers should be on the lookout for these yellow tags that are inserted at the base of the dorsal fin on the left side of the fish.  Anglers who catch a tagged fish should note the tag number and report the catch on the DNR website.  Simply do a search for \"MNDNR fish tag reporting\" and follow the links.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch gill net catch rate in 2022 was 13.4 fish/net.  Yellow Perch population abundance is near the recent average and many fish caught while Walleye fishing will be big enough to keep.  Growth rates of Yellow Perch in Upper Red Lake are excellent; 61% of the 2022 Yellow Perch gill net catch was greater than 9 inches in length.  This has resulted in some anglers putting together decent catches of nice-sized fish. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie are showing up in angler catches in greater numbers than they have in several years.  These fish are nearly all from the 2018 year class and average around 12 inches.  However, there are a few fish from some older year classes still out there that provide an opportunity to catch an impressive 14 or 15 incher that may invoke memories of the \"crappie boom\" that occurred in the early 2000s.  However, the current bump in crappie fishing success should not be misinterpreted as a new crappie boom, but rather increased opportunity for a few bonus fish as the 2018 year class is not nearly as large as the historic 1995 year class.  Anglers targeting Black Crappie will be most successful in late May and early June looking for fish in and adjacent to likely spawning areas.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Upper Red Lake is a 108,000 acre lake in northern Beltrami County.  Fifty-six percent (60,000 acres) of the lake is under the jurisdiction of the Red Lake Band of Chippewa Indians, and 44% (48,000 acres) is under the jurisdiction of the State of Minnesota.  The walleye population in this lake has been heavily exploited by a gill net fishery for many decades.  Angling harvest can also be substantial when strong year classes are present and of a desirable size range.  The Red Lake Band implemented a one-year closure of their commercial fishery in 1997 in waters under their jurisdiction due to the collapse of the walleye population.  Subsistence gill netting was permitted, but little activity was observed.  In 1998, the Band continued the commercial harvest moratorium and also prohibited subsistence harvest of walleye.  The State of Minnesota reduced walleye possession limits to two for Minnesota waters of Upper Red Lake in 1998.  The State also continued the closure of the whitefish netting season in State waters to preclude inadvertent harvest of adult walleye.  A total walleye harvest moratorium was implemented system wide in the spring of 1999 as the first step in a cooperative walleye recovery effort.  Additional steps include augmentation of natural walleye reproduction via walleye fry stocking, with a target of 1,000 fry (natural + stocked) per littoral acre, and intensified fishery assessments conducted by State and Tribal resource managers in close consultation and cooperation. Analysis of the fall 2000 gill net sample indicates that walleye from 11 year classes were sampled.  The oldest walleye sampled was a female from the 1981 year class.  About 44% of the walleye sample was comprised of fish from the 1999 year class.  This year class was composed mainly of stocked fish.  Most of the remaining walleye were from the modest 1996 and 1997 year classes.  Walleye gill net CPUE was 12.1 per lift.  This is the highest walleye CPUE documented on the lake since 1993.  This continues an increase in CPUE observed annually since the record low catch rates of 3.4 per lift observed in both 1996 and 1997.  Total pounds of walleye per gill net lift was 14.7, the highest since 1992.In the 2000 assessment, yellow perch from nine year classes were sampled in gill nets.  The oldest perch sampled were from the 1990 year class.  No perch from the 1993 year class were sampled.  Nearly 99% of the perch sample measured less than 8 inches.Seven year classes of northern pike were sampled in gill nets.  The oldest northern pike sampled were from the 1992 year class.  Approximately 17% of the sample was comprised of northern pike less than 23.0 inches while 39% of the sample measured 28.0 inches and larger.Three year classes of black crappie were sampled in gill nets in 2000.  The oldest crappies sampled were 6+ years old.  Sample size was small (35) and greatly reduced from 1999, likely due to the difficulty of sampling adult crappies in gill nets.  There is no indication yet of even a modest year class of crappies following the exceptionally strong 1995 year class.  It appears that the 1997 year class is present, but weakly represented. Anglers are still catching crappies from the 1986 and 1991 year classes, but we failed to sample any in our gear this year.All catch information for other fish species was similar to the long-term average.  Some species were sampled in such low numbers that no useful trend could be discerned.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Special Problems and Conditions Affecting Fish or FishingUpper Red Lake is a 108,000 acre lake, 56% (60,000 acres) of which is under the jurisdiction of the Red Lake Band of Chippewa Indians (Red Lake Band).  The remaining 44% (48,000 acres) falls under the jurisdiction of the state of Minnesota.  Walleye stocks in this lake were heavily exploited by a gill net fishery for many decades.  Angling harvest was also substantial when strong year classes were present and recruited to the fishery.In 1997, the Red Lake Band implemented a one-year closure of their commercial fishery due to the collapse of the walleye population in waters under their jurisdiction.  Subsistence gill netting was permitted, but little activity was observed.In 1998, the Red Lake Band extended the commercial harvest moratorium and prohibited subsistence harvest of walleye as well.  The State of Minnesota reduced walleye possession limits to two for Minnesota waters of Upper Red Lake and maintained a whitefish netting season closure to prevent inadvertent harvest of adult walleye.In 1999, an agreement was reached between the Red Lake Band and the state of Minnesota to recover the walleye population of the Red Lakes.  As a first step, a total walleye harvest moratorium was implemented in both Upper and Lower Red Lake.  Additional steps included augmentation of natural walleye reproduction via walleye fry stockings in 1999, 2001, and 2003.  In addition, intensified fishery assessments have been and will continue to be conducted by state and tribal resource managers in close consultation and cooperation.Present Fish Population StatusAnalyses of the fall 2004 gill net sample indicate that walleye from 10 year classes were sampled.  The oldest walleye sampled was a male from the 1992 year class (age 12+).  Approximately 44% of walleye sampled were from the 1999 year class (age 5+), the majority of which were stocked as fry (verified by detection of an OTC mark).  The 1999 year class is now producing substantial numbers of mature females, which will significantly increase the size of the spawning population in 2005.  The 2001 year class, also comprised primarily of stocked fish, made up 42% of the gill net sample.  The 2003 year class contributed 7% of the catch, and another 3% was made up of fish from the moderate 1996 and 1997 year classes (ages 8+ and 7+, respectively).Walleye gill net catch-per-effort (CPE) was 39.1 fish per net, which is slightly lower than those recorded in the previous two years.  The 2004 walleye catch in pounds was 40.0 per gill net, also down from 2003.  It appears that overall walleye density may have peaked, as indicated by catch rates that have leveled off and gradual declines in the rates of growth and maturity. The black crappie gill net catch rate was below the long-term median, and it continues to follow a gradual decline from an all-time high recorded in 1996.  Age analyses indicate that only three year classes were sampled.  Approximately 85% of fish in the sample were from the abundant 1995 year class (age 9+).  To date, none of the younger age groups have been very abundant compared to the 1995 year class.  Eventually, the black crappie population will return to historic levels.Northern pike CPE decreased slightly from 2003 to 1.0 fish per gill net, which is below the long-term median of 2.0 fish/net.  Though the catch was down, average size of fish caught in gill nets was the highest on record.  Although overall northern pike size structure may continue to improve, this trend will be difficult to document due to problems associated with sampling large fish in standard experimental gill nets. CPE of lake whitefish was low at 0.1 fish per gill net lift.  The relative abundance of lake whitefish has declined from recent high levels following a significant summer kill in 2001.\tAge analyses of yellow perch indicate that nine year classes were sampled.  Approximately 63% of fish caught were between eight and nine inches in length, and about 20% were greater than nine inches long.  As in previous years, the most abundant cohort was the 1997 year class (age-7+) which represented approximately one-third of the sample.  There were very few yellow perch in the sample that were younger than age-5+, likely the result of heavy predation of juvenile perch by walleye.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Special Conditions Affecting Fish or Fishing    <br> \nUpper Red Lake is a 120,000 acre lake, 60% (72,000 acres) of which is under the jurisdiction of the Red Lake Band of Chippewa Indians (Red Lake Band).  The remaining 40% (48,000 acres) falls under the jurisdiction of the state of Minnesota.  Walleye stocks in this lake were heavily exploited by a gill net fishery for many decades.  Angling harvest was also substantial when strong year classes were present and recruited to the fishery. <br> \n <br> \nThe collapse of the Red Lakes walleye population in the mid 1990\u0019s has been well documented.  Similarly, the cooperative recovery effort that included a total walleye harvest closure, a short-term walleye fry stocking program, intensified population monitoring, and increased law enforcement efforts has been widely publicized. <br> \n <br> \nIn 2006, the Red Lakes were re-opened to walleye fishing under a conservative set of harvest regulations.  Walleye harvest allocations, as outlined in the harvest management plan (Harvest Plan for Red Lakes Walleye Stocks, Red Lakes Fisheries Technical Committee, March 2006), are based on the proportion of surface water acreage within each jurisdiction.  Specific fishing methods and regulations for managing harvest within the allocations are determined individually within each jurisdiction.  In state waters of Upper Red Lake, a two-fish possession limit in combination with a 17-26 inch protected slot length limit (only one fish over 26 inches allowed in possession) was initially implemented for walleye.  These regulations are subject to change if it is determined that walleye harvests need to be reduced, or if there is an opportunity to increase harvest.  In addition to special walleye regulations, a special harvest regulation for northern pike was implemented in state waters:  a 26-40 inch protected slot length limit (only one fish over 40 inches allowed in possession). <br> \n <br> \nPresent Fish Population Status <br> \nAnalyses of the fall 2007 gill net sample indicate that walleye from 12 year classes were sampled.  The oldest fish was a female from the 1996 year class (age 11+).  Approximately 18% of walleye sampled were from the 1999 year class, while the 2001 year class made up approximately 19% of the gill net sample.  The 1999 and 2001 year classes have now produced many mature females which have contributed significantly to natural reproduction in 2004, 2005, and 2006.  The 2003 year class contributed 14% of the catch, while less than 2% was made up of fish from the moderate 1996 and 1997 year classes (ages 11+ and 10+, respectively).  Approximately 44% of the walleye sample consisted of fish younger than age-4.  Those fish are the result of recent natural reproduction. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye gill net catch-per-effort (CPE) was 34.6 fish per net, which is similar to catch rates recorded in the previous five years.  The 2007 walleye catch in pounds was 32.5 per gill net, also similar to catches from 2002-2006.  It appears that overall walleye density has peaked, as indicated by catch rates that have leveled off and gradual declines in the rates of growth and maturity. <br> \n <br> \nThe black crappie gill net catch rate was below the long-term median, and it continues to follow a gradual decline from an all-time high recorded in 1996.  Over the past 12 years, age analyses indicate that a single strong year class produced in 1995 has dominated the population.  To date, none of the younger age groups have been very abundant compared to the 1995 year class.  Eventually, the black crappie population will return to historic levels. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike CPE was 1.8 fish per gill net in 2007, nearly the same as the long-term median of 1.9 fish/net.  The average size of fish caught in gill nets has been stable over the past eight years, with a nice mixture of fish of all sizes in the sample.  Although overall northern pike size structure may continue to improve, this trend will be difficult to document due to problems associated with sampling large fish in standard experimental gill nets. <br> \n  <br> \nFor the first time in the last 15 years, there were no lake whitefish observed in the gill net sample.  The relative abundance of lake whitefish has declined from previously high levels following a significant summer kill in 2001.  Although whitefish reproduction has been documented annually since then, the rate of recruitment appears to be low. <br> \n\t <br> \nApproximately 26% of all yellow perch caught in gill nets were between eight and nine inches in length, and about 51% were greater than nine inches long.  Yellow perch less than eight inches in length made up the remainder of the sample, representing the first significant recruitment in several years. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Upper Red Lake is a 120,000 acre lake, 60% (72,000 acres) of which is under the jurisdiction of the Red Lake Band of Chippewa Indians (Red Lake Band).  The remaining 40% (48,000 acres) falls under the jurisdiction of the state of Minnesota.  A gill net fishery heavily exploited walleye stocks in this lake for many decades.  Angling harvest was also substantial when strong year classes were present and recruited to the fishery.  <br> \nThe collapse of the Red Lakes walleye population in the mid 1990\u0019s has been well documented.  Similarly, the cooperative recovery effort that included a total closure on walleye harvest, a short-term walleye fry stocking program, intensified population monitoring, and increased law enforcement efforts has been widely publicized.  <br> \nIn 2006, the Red Lakes were re-opened to walleye fishing under a conservative set of harvest regulations.  Walleye harvest allocations, as outlined in the harvest management plan (Harvest Plan for Red Lakes Walleye Stocks, Red Lakes Fisheries Technical Committee, March 2006), are based on the proportion of surface water acreage within each jurisdiction.  Specific fishing methods and regulations for managing harvest within the allocations are determined individually within each jurisdiction.  In state waters of Upper Red Lake, a two-fish possession limit in combination with a 17-26 inch protected slot length limit (only one fish over 26 inches allowed in possession) was initially implemented for walleye.  Regulations were relaxed in 2008 to a three-fish possession limit with the same protected slot limit.  In addition to special walleye regulations, a special harvest regulation for northern pike was implemented in state waters: a 26-40 inch protected slot length limit (only one fish over 40 inches allowed in possession).  <br> \n <br> \nPresent Fish Population Status <br> \nWalleye gill net catch-per-effort (CPE) was 26.3 per gill net, which is slightly below catch rates recorded in the previous five years.  It appears that overall walleye density peaked in 2003 and has relaxed a bit as the lake seeks to find its carrying capacity. Walleye from 11 consecutive year classes were sampled with oldest fish representing the 1997 year class (age 11).  Approximately 61% of the walleye sample consisted of fish younger than age-5, which are primarily the result of natural reproduction.  Thirty percent of the 2008 gill net sample was between 14 and 17 inches.  Fish from 11 to 13 inches composed 37% of the gill net sample.  This size distribution suggests that fishing and the ability to find \"keeper\" walleyes should be good for the foreseeable future.  <br> \nThe black crappie gill net catch rate was below the long-term median, and it continues to follow a gradual decline from an all-time high recorded in 1996.  Over the past 13 years, age analyses indicate that a single strong year class produced in 1995 has dominated the population.  To date, none of the younger age groups have been very abundant compared to the 1995 year class.  <br> \nNorthern pike CPE was 1.5 fish per gill net in 2008, similar to the long-term median of 1.9 fish/net.  The average size of fish caught in gill nets has been stable over the past eight years, with a nice mixture of fish sizes in the sample.  Spring trap netting was conducted in 2008 during the northern pike spawning run to better assess the population.  Thirty-two percent of fish captured were greater than 30 inches.  The largest fish captured was 43 inches with 5% of the sample greater than 40 inches.  Our sampling confirmed that this fishery contains large fish and provides anglers with a good chance at landing a trophy-sized fish. <br> \nThere was only one lake whitefish observed in the 2008 gill net sample and none during the 2007 assessment.  The abundance of lake whitefish has declined from previously high levels following a significant summer kill in 2001.  Although whitefish reproduction has been documented since then, the rate of recruitment appears to be low. <br> \nYellow perch CPE was only 3.2 fish per gill net in 2008 as heavy predation on juvenile perch for several years has reduced their numbers.  However, approximately 40% of all yellow perch caught in gill nets were between 9 and 10 inches in length, and about 58% were greater than 8 inches long.  Yellow perch less than eight inches in length made up the remainder of the sample, representing the first significant recruitment in several years. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Upper Red Lake is a 120,000 acre lake, 60% (72,000 acres) of which is under the jurisdiction of the Red Lake Band of Chippewa Indians (Red Lake Band). The remaining 40% (48,000 acres) falls under the jurisdiction of the State of Minnesota.  Walleye, the primary species sought by anglers, is managed under a cooperative plan with the Red Lake Band that establishes target harvest levels that vary according the mature female population.  As a result, fishing regulations are frequently adjusted to achieve harvest levels within these targets. <br> \n <br> \nThe 2023 Walleye gill net catch rate was 48.9 per gill net.  The population is now dominated by young fish, mostly notably the 2019 and 2022 year classes. These young fish are ages 2 to 5 and range from 8 to 17 inches.  The \"one over 17 inches\" size regulation will again be in place for the 2024 open water season and there will be plenty of fish right around that size (so measure carefully!).  The bag limit will be three fish from Fishing Opener through June 14 and four fish starting June 15th.  Walleye harvest last winter (the first half of our harvest year) was record high which necessitated the lower bag limit to start the open-water season to ensure we finish the harvest year below the harvest cap.  Upper Red Lake has one of the highest Walleye catch rates in the state, particularly in May and June, though early ice-out may slow the fish down a bit.  Getting away from the river mouths will help you get away from the crowds and that may be even more important this year if the fish are further post-spawn on Opener. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike density in Upper Red Lake is low, which is actually a desirable condition for lakes that are being managed for trophy pike.  Recent ice-out trap net assessments have captured Northern Pike up to 44 inches in length with tremendous numbers of fish over 36 inches in length.  The 30- to 40-inch protected slot limit (only one fish allowed over 40 inches) provides a balance of harvest opportunity for eater-sized fish as well as the chance to put a trophy on the wall.  MNDNR has been tagging Northern Pike during the past three years.  Anglers should be on the lookout for these yellow tags that are inserted at the base of the dorsal fin on the left side of the fish.  Anglers who catch a tagged fish should note the tag number and are encouraged to report the catch on the DNR website.  Simply do a search for \"MNDNR fish tag reporting\" and follow the links. Note: these tags are sometimes coated with algae that makes seeing the numbers difficult but this can be easily rubbed off to reveal the six-digit number. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch gill net catch rate in 2023 was 29.7 fish/net, the highest in two decades.  Many fish caught while Walleye fishing will be big enough to keep and there are good numbers of 10- to 11-inch fish in the population.  Growth rates of Yellow Perch in Upper Red Lake are excellent; 46% of the 2023 Yellow Perch gill net catch was greater than 9 inches in length.  This has resulted in some anglers putting together decent catches of nice-sized fish. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie are showing up in angler catches in greater numbers than they have in several years.  These fish are nearly all from the 2018 year class and average around 12 inches.  However, there are a few fish from some older year classes still out there that provide an opportunity to catch an impressive 14 or 15 incher that may invoke memories of the \"crappie boom\" that occurred in the early 2000s.  However, the current bump in crappie fishing success should not be misinterpreted as a new crappie boom, but rather increased opportunity for a few bonus fish as the 2018 year class is not nearly as large as the historic 1995 year class.  Anglers targeting Black Crappie will be most successful in late May and early June looking for fish in and adjacent to likely spawning areas.  <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Analyses of the fall 2006 gill net sample indicate that walleye from 10 year classes were sampled.  The oldest fish were from the 1996 year class (age 10+).  Approximately 25% of walleye sampled were from the 1999 year class, while the 2001 year class made up approximately 30% of the gill net sample.  The 1999 and 2001 year classes have now produced many mature females which have contributed significantly to natural reproduction in 2004, 2005, and 2006.  The 2003 year class contributed 13% of the catch, and another 2% was made up of fish from the moderate 1996 and 1997 year classes (ages 10+ and 9+, respectively).  Approximately 25% of the walleye sample consisted of fish younger than age-3.  These fish are the result of recent natural reproduction. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye gill net catch-per-effort (CPE) was 40.1 fish per net, which is similar to those recorded in the previous four years.  The 2006 walleye catch in pounds was 41.1 per gill net, also similar to catches from 2002-2005.  It appears that overall walleye density has peaked, as indicated by catch rates that have leveled off and gradual declines in the rates of growth and maturity. <br> \n <br> \nThe black crappie gill net catch rate was below the long-term median, and it continues to follow a gradual decline from an all-time high recorded in 1996.  Over the past 10 years, age analyses indicate that a single strong year class produced in 1995 has dominated the population.  To date, none of the younger age groups have been very abundant compared to the 1995 year class.  Eventually, the black crappie population will return to historic levels. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike CPE was 1.3 fish per gill net in 2006, slightly below the long-term median of 1.9 fish/net.  The average size of fish caught in gill nets decreased slightly, reflecting the presence of a number of younger (age-1 and age-2) fish in the sample.  Although overall northern pike size structure may continue to improve, this trend will be difficult to document due to problems associated with sampling large fish in standard experimental gill nets. <br> \n  <br> \nCPE of lake whitefish was low at 0.1 fish per gill net lift.  The relative abundance of lake whitefish has declined from previously high levels following a significant summer kill in 2001. <br> \n\t <br> \nApproximately 38% of all yellow perch caught in gill nets were between eight and nine inches in length, and about 58% were greater than nine inches long.  There were very few yellow perch in the sample that were younger than age-7, likely the result of heavy predation of juvenile perch by walleye. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Upper Red Lake is a 120,000 acre lake, 60% (72,000 acres) of which is under the jurisdiction of the Red Lake Band of Chippewa Indians (Red Lake Band). The remaining 40% (48,000 acres) falls under the jurisdiction of the State of Minnesota. A gill net fishery heavily exploited walleye stocks in this lake for many decades. Angling harvest was also substantial when strong year classes were present and recruited to the fishery. The collapse of the Red Lakes walleye population in the mid 1990\u0019s has been well documented. Similarly, the cooperative recovery effort that included a total closure on walleye harvest, a short-term walleye fry stocking program, intensified population monitoring, and increased law enforcement efforts has been widely publicized. In 2006, the Red Lakes were re-opened to walleye fishing under a conservative set of harvest regulations. Walleye harvest allocations, as outlined in the harvest management plan (Harvest Plan for Red Lakes Walleye Stocks, Red Lakes Fisheries Technical Committee, March 2006), are based on the proportion of surface water acreage within each jurisdiction. Specific fishing methods and regulations for managing harvest within the allocations are determined individually within each jurisdiction. In state waters of Upper Red Lake, a two-fish possession limit in combination with a 17-26 inch protected slot length limit (PSL; only one fish over 26 inches allowed in possession) was initially implemented for walleye. Over the next few years, regulations were incrementally relaxed. A 4-fish bag limit was in place for the entire 2009 open water season and a temporary slot adjustment (20-26 inch PSL) was employed from mid-June through the end of the season.  This slot adjustment stimulated increased fishing pressure during mid-summer and increased harvest substantially for this time period compared to previous years. In addition to special walleye regulations, a special harvest regulation for northern pike was implemented in state waters: a 26-40 inch protected slot length limit (only one fish over 40 inches allowed in possession). We are currently considering a slot limit adjustment to increase protection for large pike. <br> \nPresent Fish Population Status  <br> \nThe 2009 walleye gill net catch-per-effort (CPE) was 24.1 per gill net, which is slightly below catch rates recorded in the previous six years. It appears that overall walleye density peaked in 2003 and is leveling off as the lake adjusts to its carrying capacity. Walleye from 11 year classes were sampled with the oldest fish representing the 1997 year class (age 12). Approximately 78% of the walleye sample consisted of fish younger than age-6, which are primarily the result of natural reproduction. Fifty percent of the 2009 gill net sample was between 12 and 15 inches. This size distribution suggests that fishing and the ability to find \"keeper\" walleyes should be good for the foreseeable future. The black crappie gill net catch rate was below the long-term median, and it continues to follow a gradual decline from an all-time high recorded in 1996. Over the past 13 years, age analyses indicate that a single strong year class produced in 1995 has dominated the population. To date, none of the younger age groups have been very abundant compared to the 1995 year class. Northern pike CPE was 1.1 fish per gill net in 2009, similar to the long-term median of 1.9 fish/net. The average size of fish caught in gill nets has been stable over the past eight years, with a nice mixture of fish sizes in the sample. Spring trap netting was conducted in 2009 during the northern pike spawning run to better assess the population. Twenty-nine percent of fish captured were greater than 30 inches. The largest fish captured was 44 inches with 5% of the sample greater than 40 inches. Our sampling confirmed that this fishery contains large fish and provides anglers with a good chance at landing a trophy-sized fish. There has only been one lake whitefish observed in survey nets since 2006. The abundance of lake whitefish has declined from previously high levels following a significant summer kill in 2001. Although whitefish reproduction has been documented since then, the rate of recruitment appears to be low. Yellow perch CPE was only 7.6 fish per gill net in 2009, which is more than twice the catch observed in 2008. Heavy predation on juvenile perch for several years has reduced their numbers. However, there has been at least some measureable recruitment each year since 2006 and the 2007 year class is shaping up to be of moderate strength.  These year classes (2006-2009) represent the first significant recruitment in several years.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Special Problems and Conditions Affecting Fish or Fishing   Upper Red Lake is a 108,000 acre lake, 56% (60,000 acres) of which is under the jurisdiction of the Red Lake Band of Chippewa Indians (Red Lake Band).  The remaining 44% (48,000 acres) falls under the jurisdiction of the state of Minnesota.  Walleye stocks in this lake were heavily exploited by a gill net fishery for many decades.  Angling harvest was also substantial when strong year classes were present and recruited to the fishery.In 1997, the Red Lake Band implemented a one-year closure of their commercial fishery due to the collapse of the walleye population in waters under their jurisdiction.  Subsistence gill netting was permitted, but little activity was observed.In 1998, the Red Lake Band extended the commercial harvest moratorium and prohibited subsistence harvest of walleye as well.  The State of Minnesota reduced walleye possession limits to two for Minnesota waters of Upper Red Lake and maintained a whitefish netting season closure to prevent inadvertent harvest of adult walleye.In 1999, an agreement was reached between the Red Lake Band and the state of Minnesota to recover the walleye population of the Red Lakes.  As a first step, a total walleye harvest moratorium was implemented in both Upper and Lower Red Lake.  Additional steps included augmentation of natural walleye reproduction via walleye fry stockings in 1999, 2001, and 2003.  In addition, intensified fishery assessments have been and will continue to be conducted by state and tribal resource managers in close consultation and cooperation.Present Fish Population Status  Analyses of the fall 2003 gill net sample indicate that walleye from 11 year classes were sampled.  The oldest walleye sampled was a male from the 1990 year class (age 13+).  Approximately two-thirds (66%) of the walleye sampled were from the 1999 year class (age 4+), the majority of which were stocked as fry (verified by detection of an OTC mark).  The 1999 year class is beginning to produce some mature females, which will significantly increase the size of the spawning population in 2004.  The 2001 year class, also comprised primarily of stocked fish, made up 24% of the gill net sample.  Another 5% of the catch was made up of fish from the moderate 1996 and 1997 year classes (ages 7+ and 6+, respectively).Walleye gill net catch-per-effort (CPE) was 47.2 fish per net, which is the highest catch rate recorded since the large lake monitoring program was implemented in 1984.  This continued a steady increase in CPE since the record low catch rates of 3.4 per net observed in both 1996 and 1997.  The 2003 walleye catch in pounds per gill net was 57.8, which is by far the highest catch rate ever recorded for Upper Red.Age analyses of black crappie indicate that five year classes were sampled.  Approximately 90% of fish in the sample were from the abundant 1995 year class (age 8+).  The remaining fish were scattered among several younger age groups, none of which were very abundant in comparison to the 1995 year class.  Gill net catch rates were about the same as in 2002, but still followed a gradual decline from an all-time high recorded in 1996.Northern pike CPE increased slightly from 2002 to 1.7 fish per gill net, which is just below the long-term median of 2.0 fish/net.  Average size of fish caught in gill nets decreased slightly from 2002 due to increased numbers of age-1+ and age-2+ fish in the sample.  Although overall northern pike size structure should continue to improve, this trend will not likely be evident due to difficulties associated with sampling large fish in experimental gill nets. CPE of lake whitefish was fairly typical at 0.3 fish per gill net lift.  The relative abundance of lake whitefish has declined from recent high levels following a significant summer kill in 2001.\tAge analyses of yellow perch indicate that eight year classes were sampled.  Approximately 41% of the sample was comprised of perch less than eight inches in length, and about 95% were less than nine inches long.  Of fish less than nine inches, 90% were age-4 or older.  As in 2002, the most abundant cohort was the 1997 year class (age-6+) which represented approximately 39% of the sample.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Upper Red Lake is a 120,000 acre lake, 60% (72,000 acres) of which is under the jurisdiction of the Red Lake Band of Chippewa Indians (Red Lake Band). The remaining 40% (48,000 acres) falls under the jurisdiction of the State of Minnesota. The collapse of the Red Lakes walleye population in the mid 1990's has been well documented. Similarly, the cooperative recovery effort that included a total closure on walleye harvest, a short-term walleye fry stocking program, intensified population monitoring, and increased law enforcement efforts has been widely publicized.  In 2006, the Red Lakes were re-opened to walleye fishing under a conservative set of harvest regulations. Walleye harvest allocations, as outlined in the harvest management plan, are based on the proportion of surface water acreage within each jurisdiction. Specific fishing methods and regulations for managing harvest within the allocations are determined individually within each jurisdiction. In state waters of Upper Red Lake, a two-fish possession limit in combination with a 17-26 inch protected slot length limit (PSL; only one fish over 26 inches allowed in possession) was initially implemented for walleye. Over the next several years, regulations were incrementally relaxed.  Then, following exceptional walleye harvest due to a burgeoning population and favorable conditions, regulations were tightened during winter 2014-2015.  Fishing regulations for the 2015 open-water season will be a continuation of the tightened regulations implemented at the end of January: a two-fish bag limit with a 17-26 inch PSL.  These regulations are necessary to comply with the Harvest Plan for Red Lakes walleye between the State of Minnesota and the Red Lake Nation.  Fishing regulations for the 2015-2016 winter season are expected to be slightly less restrictive and will be announced this fall through various media and posted to the DNR website.   <br> \n <br> \nIn addition to special walleye regulations, a special harvest regulation for northern pike has been in place since the 2006 fishing opener.  The regulation from 2006 through 2010 was a 26-40 inch PSL (only one fish over 40 inches allowed in possession) and beginning with the 2011 fishing season opener, this slot limit was widened to a 26-44 inch protected slot (only one fish over 44 inches allowed in possession) to increase protection for large pike. <br> \n <br> \nPresent Fish Population Status  <br> \nThe 2014 walleye gill net catch-per-effort (CPE) was a record-high 61.7 per gill net.  Record-high walleye CPE is largely due to the incredibly strong 2009 and 2011 year classes.  Approximately two-thirds of the catch consisted of age-3 fish from the 2011 year class which averaged 14.1 inches.  This should mean that anglers will have no problem catching keeper-sized fish this summer as these fish will start the year averaging around 14 inches and grow an inch or two over the course of the summer.  Although Upper Red Lake has one of the highest walleye catch rates in the state, it is not known for producing large fish.  However, fish in the low twenties are fairly common and provide a nice surprise when they cooperate. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike density in Upper Red Lake is low, which is actually a desirable condition for lakes that are being managed for trophy pike.  This low density population produces individuals that reach large sizes (> 40 inches) and recent ice-out trap net assessment have captured northern pike approaching 46 inches in length with good numbers of fish over 40 inches in length.   <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch CPE in 2013 was 15.9 fish/net and included good numbers of keeper-sized fish.  Yellow perch population abundance has nearly returned to pre-walleye collapse levels after going through a period of low abundance during the 2000s.  Growth rates of yellow perch in Upper Red Lake are good and 44% of the yellow perch catch was greater than 9 inches in length.  This has resulted in increased angling success with some anglers putting together catches of nice-sized fish.  <br> \n  <br> \nA few small year classes of black crappie have been documented in recent assessments and creel surveys and most of these fish are 8 to 12 inches.  Although these fish represent the first recruitment beyond age 0 since the \"crappie boom\" in the late 1990s, they appear to be of modest strength and don't likely signal the next crappie boom.  However, it is possible that anglers may pick up a few more \"bonus\" crappies while fishing walleyes than they have over the past few years. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Upper Red Lake is a 120,000 acre lake, 60% (72,000 acres) of which is under the jurisdiction of the Red Lake Band of Chippewa Indians (Red Lake Band). The remaining 40% (48,000 acres) falls under the jurisdiction of the State of Minnesota. The collapse of the Red Lakes Walleye population in the mid 1990's has been well documented. Similarly, the cooperative recovery effort that included a total closure on Walleye harvest, a short-term Walleye fry stocking program, intensified population monitoring, and increased law enforcement efforts has been widely publicized.  In 2006, the Red Lakes were re-opened to Walleye fishing under a conservative set of harvest regulations. Walleye harvest allocations, as outlined in the harvest management plan, are based on the proportion of surface water acreage within each jurisdiction. Specific fishing methods and regulations for managing harvest within the allocations are determined individually within each jurisdiction. From 2006 when the Walleye fishery was reopened though summer 2015, the Walleye population was managed with a protected slot limit. In December 2015, the size restriction for Walleye was modified to a \"one over\" regulation that allows the harvest of one fish over a designated size.  This regulation is designed to allow harvest of fish over a broad size range and not focus the harvest on any particular size class of Walleye.   <br> \n <br> \nIn addition to special Walleye regulations, a special harvest regulation for Northern Pike has been in place since the 2006 fishing opener.  The regulation from 2006 through 2010 was a 26-40 inch PSL (only one fish over 40 inches allowed in possession) and beginning with the 2011 fishing season opener, this slot limit was widened to a 26-44 inch protected slot (only one fish over 44 inches allowed in possession) to increase protection for large pike. <br> \n <br> \nPresent Fish Population Status  <br> \nThe 2017 Walleye gill net catch-per-effort (CPE) was 36.8 per gill net.  The incredibly strong 2011 year class continues to dominate the population with most of these fish measuring between 15 and 18 inches.  A lot of these fish are very close to the 17-inch mark - so be careful when measuring your catch.  Fish from the 2013 and 2014 year classes (about 14 inches) will provide additional \"under fish this summer.  Although Upper Red Lake has one of the highest Walleye catch rates in the state, particularly in May and June, it is not known for producing large fish.  However, fish around 20 inches are fairly common and provide a nice surprise when they cooperate. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike density in Upper Red Lake is low, which is actually a desirable condition for lakes that are being managed for trophy pike.  This low density population produces individuals that reach large sizes (> 40 inches) and recent ice-out trap net assessment have captured Northern Pike up to 44 inches in length with tremendous numbers of fish over 36 inches in length.   <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch CPE in 2016 was 7.4 fish/net.  Yellow Perch population abundance is down a bit compared to the last few years, but most fish that will be caught while Walleye fishing will be big enough to keep.  Growth rates of Yellow Perch in Upper Red Lake are good and 60% of the Yellow Perch catch was greater than 9 inches in length.  This has resulted in increased angling success with some anglers putting together catches of nice-sized fish.  <br> \n  <br> \nA few moderate year classes of Black Crappie have been documented in recent assessments and creel surveys and most of these fish are 10 to 13 inches.  Although these fish represent the first recruitment beyond age 0 since the \"crappie boom\" in the late 1990s, they appear to be of modest strength and don't likely signal the next crappie boom.  However, it is possible that anglers may pick up a few more \"bonus\" crappies while fishing Walleye than they have over the past few years. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>The Red Lake walleye population has been intensively commercially harvested for over 80 years.  Classic symptoms of over exploitation (highly variable recruitment, increased growth rate, reduced age of maturity, degradation of population size structure, and a skewing of the sex ratio) have been noted for many years.  Gill net catches on Minnesota waters of only 3.4 walleye per experimental net lift represent the lowest abundance ever documented.  Catches on reservation waters are reported to be substantially lower than that.  Estimates of mature female walleye biomass system wide suggest that the reproductive potential of fish in the system may have fallen well below the level necessary to produce 1,000 fry per acre.  This is the minimum number of fry believed necessary to establish a moderate year class.  Both yellow perch and black crappie have moderate year classes likely to recruit to the sport fishery in 1998. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Preliminary analyses of the fall 2001 gill net sample indicate that walleye from 11 year classes were sampled.  The oldest walleye sampled was a male from the previously strong 1985 year class (age 16+).  Approximately 67% of the walleye sampled were from the 1999 year class, the majority of which were stocked as fry (verified by detection of an OTC mark).  Another 23% of the catch was made up of fish from the moderate 1996 and 1997 year classes (ages 5+ and 4+, respectively), which are beginning to produce some mature females.  The 2001 year class contributed slightly over 5% of the catch as age-0 fish, however; these fish were not fully recruited to the gill nets.Walleye gill net catch-per-effort (CPE) was 13.5 per net lift, which is the highest catch rate since 1992.  This continues an increase in CPE observed annually since the record low catch rates of 3.4 per lift observed in both 1996 and 1997.  Walleye catch in pounds per net lift was 12.9, only slightly less than in 2000.Age analyses of black crappie indicate that four year classes were sampled.  Nearly 88% of fish in the sample were from the abundant 1995 year class (age 6+).  The oldest crappies sampled were age-7+ representing the 1994 year class.  Age-4 fish made up approximately 9% of the sample, indicating a continued presence of the moderate 1997 year class.  Gill net catch rates were up from 2000, but still followed a gradual decline from all-time highs in 1996.Northern pike gill net CPE was typical at 1.6 fish per gill net lift, and size structure appears to have improved in recent years.  The mean length of 2001 gill-net-caught fish (26.2 inches) was higher only in 2000 (27.8 inches).  The mean weight of 4.8 pounds in 2001 was higher only in 2000 and in 1984.  Size of these fish may continue to improve due to a combination of reduced mortality, rapid growth rates, and abundant forage.  However, increases in size structure may not be evident due to difficulty in sampling large northern pike in experimental gill nets. CPE of lake whitefish was typical at 1.0 fish per gill net lift.  The mature lake whitefish population present in 2000 apparently experienced a significant summer kill in 2001, most likely due to extremely warm water temperatures.  Most of these fish turned up in Lower Red Lake, where they may have been concentrated in an attempt to seek out thermal refuge in the deeper basin.Preliminary age analyses indicate that eight year classes of yellow perch were sampled.  Approximately 75% of the sample was comprised of perch less than 8 inches in length.  Of these, 61% were age-4 or older.  The most abundant cohort was the 1995 year class (age-6+) which represented approximately 32% of the sample, followed by the 1997 year class (age-4+) at about 24% of the sample.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Upper Red Lake is a 120,000 acre lake, 60% (72,000 acres) of which is under the jurisdiction of the Red Lake Band of Chippewa Indians (Red Lake Band). The remaining 40% (48,000 acres) falls under the jurisdiction of the State of Minnesota. The collapse of the Red Lakes walleye population in the mid 1990's has been well documented. Similarly, the cooperative recovery effort that included a total closure on walleye harvest, a short-term walleye fry stocking program, intensified population monitoring, and increased law enforcement efforts has been widely publicized. In 2006, the Red Lakes were re-opened to walleye fishing under a conservative set of harvest regulations. Walleye harvest allocations, as outlined in the harvest management plan, are based on the proportion of surface water acreage within each jurisdiction. Specific fishing methods and regulations for managing harvest within the allocations are determined individually within each jurisdiction. In state waters of Upper Red Lake, a two-fish possession limit in combination with a 17-26 inch protected slot length limit (PSL; only one fish over 26 inches allowed in possession) was initially implemented for walleye. Over the several few years, regulations were incrementally relaxed. Regulations for the past two seasons have been consistent: a 4-fish bag limit, and a 17-26 inch PSL for the winter season and the open-water season until June 14th, followed by a temporary slot adjustment (20-26 inch PSL) from mid-June through the end of November.  This slot adjustment has increased fishing pressure during mid-summer and increased harvest for this time period compared to previous years.  In addition to special walleye regulations, a special harvest regulation for northern pike has been in place since the 2006 fishing opener: a 26-40 inch PSL (only one fish over 40 inches allowed in possession).  Beginning with the 2011 fishing season opener, this slot limit will be widened to a 26-44 inch protected slot to increase protection for large pike. <br> \n <br> \nPresent Fish Population Status  <br> \nThe 2010 walleye gill net catch-per-effort (CPE) was 27.7 per gill net, which is slightly greater than the 2009 catch rate (24.1 walleye/net).  However, it appears that overall walleye density peaked in 2003 and is leveling off as the lake adjusts to its carrying capacity.  Walleye from age 0 (young of year) to age 12 were sampled with the oldest fish representing the 1998 year class.  Approximately 65% of the walleye sample consisted of fish younger than age-5, which are entirely the result of natural reproduction.  Sixty percent of the 2010 gill net sample was between 12 and 17 inches and approximately one-third of the sample was between 14 and 17 inches.  This size distribution suggests that fishing and the ability to find \"keeper\" walleyes should be good for the foreseeable future.  Northern pike CPE was 1.1 fish per gill net in 2010, which is similar to 2009 and only slightly below the long-term median of 1.7 fish/net.  The average size of northern pike caught in gill nets has been stable over the past eight years with a nice mixture of sizes \u0013 including fish up to 44 inches.  The abundance of lake whitefish (1.3 fish/net) was greater than 1 fish/net for the first time since 2001, at which take there was a substantial summerkill of this species.  Although lake whitefish reproduction has been documented since then, the rate of recruitment has been low.  However, in 2010 there were two year classes of lake whitefish caught: age-1 fish which were about 10 inches, and age-2 fish which were about 14 inches.  Yellow perch CPE increased from 7.6 fish per gill net in 2009 to 12.5 in 2010. This marks the second year of improved gill net catch.  Heavy predation on juvenile perch for several years reduced their numbers.  However, there has been at least some measureable recruitment each year since 2006 and the 2007 and 2008 year classes are shaping up to be of moderate strength.  Growth rates of yellow perch in Upper Red Lake are good and 40% of the yellow perch catch was greater than 8 inches in length.  The black crappie gill net catch rate was below the long-term median and, coupled with creel survey data, all indications are that the \"crappie boom\" is over and this species has returned to lower levels of abundance.   <br> \n</p>",

The remaining 40% (48,000 acres) falls under the jurisdiction of the State of Minnesota. The collapse of the Red Lakes Walleye population in the mid 1990's has been well documented. Similarly, the cooperative recovery effort that included a total closure on Walleye harvest, a short-term Walleye fry stocking program, intensified population monitoring, and increased law enforcement efforts has been widely publicized.  In 2006, the Red Lakes were re-opened to Walleye fishing under a conservative set of harvest regulations. Walleye harvest allocations, as outlined in the harvest management plan, are based on the proportion of surface water acreage within each jurisdiction. Specific fishing methods and regulations for managing harvest within the allocations are determined individually within each jurisdiction. From 2006 when the Walleye fishery was reopened though summer 2015, the Walleye population was managed with a protected slot limit. In December 2015, the size restriction for Walleye was modified to a \"one over\" regulation that allows the harvest of one fish over a designated size.  This regulation is designed to allow harvest of fish over a broad size range and not focus the harvest on any particular size class of Walleye.  The winter 2015-2016 Walleye fishing regulation was a three fish bag/possession limit with one fish allowed over 17 inches.  This regulation will be continued for the Fishing Opener.  There is a chance that the bag/possession limit will be increased to 4 fish on June 15th, depending on total Walleye harvest through the end of May 2016.  If this change occurs, it will be announced this fall through various media and posted to the DNR website.   <br> \n <br> \nIn addition to special Walleye regulations, a special harvest regulation for Northern Pike has been in place since the 2006 fishing opener.  The regulation from 2006 through 2010 was a 26-40 inch PSL (only one fish over 40 inches allowed in possession) and beginning with the 2011 fishing season opener, this slot limit was widened to a 26-44 inch protected slot (only one fish over 44 inches allowed in possession) to increase protection for large pike. <br> \n <br> \nPresent Fish Population Status  <br> \nThe 2015 Walleye gill net catch-per-effort (CPE) was 34.7 per gill net.  The strong 2009 and 2011 year classes continue to dominate the population with most of these fish measuring between 14 and 17 inches.  This should mean that anglers will have no problem catching fish under 17 inches this summer and there is also a good number of fish from 17 to 20 inches in the population to provide that one fish over 17 inches.  Although Upper Red Lake has one of the highest Walleye catch rates in the state, it is not known for producing large fish.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike density in Upper Red Lake is low, which is actually a desirable condition for lakes that are being managed for trophy pike.  This low density population produces individuals that reach large sizes (> 40 inches) and recent ice-out trap net assessment have captured Northern Pike approaching 46 inches in length with good numbers of fish over 40 inches in length.   <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch CPE in 2013 was 12.7 fish/net and included good numbers of keeper-sized fish.  Yellow Perch population abundance has nearly returned to pre-Walleye collapse levels after going through a period of low abundance during the 2000s.  Growth rates of Yellow Perch in Upper Red Lake are good and 46% of the Yellow Perch catch was greater than 9 inches in length.  This has resulted in increased angling success with some anglers putting together catches of nice-sized fish.  <br> \n  <br> \nA few moderate year classes of Black Crappie have been documented in recent assessments and creel surveys and most of these fish are 10 to 13 inches.  Tthese fish represent the first meaningful recruitment beyond age 0 since the \"crappie boom\" in the late 1990s.  Anglers may pick up a few more \"bonus\" crappies while fishing Walleye than they have over the past few years. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Background <br> \nUpper Red Lake is a 120,000 acre lake, 60% (72,000 acres) of which is under the jurisdiction of the Red Lake Band of Chippewa Indians (Red Lake Band). The remaining 40% (48,000 acres) falls under the jurisdiction of the State of Minnesota. The collapse of the Red Lakes Walleye population in the mid 1990's has been well documented. Similarly, the cooperative recovery effort that included a total closure on Walleye harvest, a short-term Walleye fry stocking program, intensified population monitoring, and increased law enforcement efforts has been widely publicized.  In 2006, the Red Lakes were re-opened to Walleye fishing under a conservative set of harvest regulations. Walleye harvest allocations, as outlined in the harvest management plan, are based on the proportion of surface water acreage within each jurisdiction. Specific fishing methods and regulations for managing harvest within the allocations are determined individually within each jurisdiction. From 2006 when the Walleye fishery was reopened though summer 2015, the Walleye population was managed with a protected slot limit. In December 2015, the size restriction for Walleye was modified to a \"one over\" regulation that allows the harvest of one fish over a designated size.  This regulation is designed to allow harvest of fish over a broad size range and not focus the harvest on any particular size class of Walleye.   <br> \n <br> \nIn addition to special Walleye regulations, a special harvest regulation for Northern Pike has been in place since the 2006 fishing opener.  The regulation from 2006 through 2010 was a 26-40 inch protected slot limit (PSL) with only one fish over 40 inches allowed in possession. Beginning with the 2011 fishing season opener, this slot limit was widened to a 26-44 inch PSL with only one fish over 44 inches allowed in possession, to increase protection for large pike.  This regulation was reviewed in 2019 and a modified PSL of 30 to 40 inches will be in place starting on the 2020 Fishing Opener.  The three fish bag limit and one fish allowed over the slot remains unchanged. <br> \n <br> \nPresent Fish Population Status  <br> \nThe 2019 Walleye gill net catch-per-effort (CPE) was 43.3 per gill net.  The incredibly strong 2011 year class continues to dominate the population with most of these fish measuring between 16 and 20 inches.  The \"one over 17 inches\" size regulation that will be in place for the 2020 open water season will allow some of these fish to be harvested and there are good numbers of fish just below this size range as well.  The 2017 year class is the strongest we have seen since 2011 and these fish, which will be about 13 inches on opener, are growing quickly and many will reach 15 inches by the end of the summer.  That is good news for those that fish Upper Red later into the summer as fish of this size tend to dominate catches in July and August and there are lots of them.  Of course, Upper Red Lake has one of the highest Walleye catch rates in the state, particularly in May and June, and managers are expecting this trend to continue in 2020.  There will be need for a bit of sorting due to the number of fish that are 17 to 18 inches and the \"one over 17 inches\" size regulation, but there are enough different year classes in the population to provide a broad size range from which to harvest fish.  Get away from the river mouths early in the season and you will find more fish under 17 inches. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike density in Upper Red Lake is low, which is actually a desirable condition for lakes that are being managed for trophy pike.  This low density population produces individuals that reach large sizes (> 40 inches) and recent ice-out trap net assessments have captured Northern Pike up to 44 inches in length with tremendous numbers of fish over 36 inches in length.  The new 30- to 40-inch PSL will provide some additional harvest opportunity for both eater-sized fish as well as the chance to put a trophy on the wall. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch gill net catch rate in 2019 was 18.5 fish/net.  Yellow Perch population abundance is higher than the last few years, and many fish caught while Walleye fishing will be big enough to keep.  Growth rates of Yellow Perch in Upper Red Lake are good and 54% of the Yellow Perch catch was greater than 9 inches in length.  This has resulted in some anglers putting together decent catches of nice-sized fish.  <br> \n</p>",

Classic symptoms of over exploitation - highly variable recruitment, increased growth rate, reduced age of maturity, degradation of population size structure, and a skewing of the sex ratio - have been noted for many years.  (Sex ratios of well over 100 adult males per adult female eventually forced the closure of the walleye hatchery at Waskish).  Gill net catches on Minnesota waters were 5.2 walleye per experimental net lift and represents a modest improvement in the catch per lift from the previous year's 3.4 per lift.  Estimates of mature female walleye biomass system-wide suggest that the reproductive potential of walleye in the system may have fallen well below the level necessary to produce 1,000 fry per littoral acre.  This is the minimum number of fry believed necessary to establish a moderate year class.  While not yet aged, it appears that over 80% of the yellow perch sampled in 1998 are from one year class, most likely the 1995 year class.  Black crappie also have been increasing in abundance, and it is possible that drum and whitefish may be establishing above average year classes as well.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Upper Red Lake is a 120,000 acre lake, 60% (72,000 acres) of which is under the jurisdiction of the Red Lake Band of Chippewa Indians (Red Lake Band). The remaining 40% (48,000 acres) falls under the jurisdiction of the State of Minnesota. The collapse of the Red Lakes walleye population in the mid 1990's has been well documented. Similarly, the cooperative recovery effort that included a total closure on walleye harvest, a short-term walleye fry stocking program, intensified population monitoring, and increased law enforcement efforts has been widely publicized.  In 2006, the Red Lakes were re-opened to walleye fishing under a conservative set of harvest regulations. Walleye harvest allocations, as outlined in the harvest management plan, are based on the proportion of surface water acreage within each jurisdiction. Specific fishing methods and regulations for managing harvest within the allocations are determined individually within each jurisdiction. In state waters of Upper Red Lake, a two-fish possession limit in combination with a 17-26 inch protected slot length limit (PSL; only one fish over 26 inches allowed in possession) was initially implemented for walleye. Over several years, regulations have been incrementally relaxed. In 2013, the fishing regulation included: a 4-fish bag limit, and a 17-26 inch PSL from the Fishing Opener until June 14th, followed by a slot adjustment (20-26 inch PSL) from mid-June through the end of the fishing season in February.  Fishing regulations for the 2014 open-water season will remain the same.  Fishing regulations for the 2014-2015 winter will be either 17-26 inch PSL for December and 20-26 inch PSL from January 01 through the end of the fishing season OR 17-26 inch PSL all winter, depending on summer harvest estimates.  Winter regulations will be posted on the DNR website in November.  In addition to special walleye regulations, a special harvest regulation for northern pike has been in place since the 2006 fishing opener.  The regulation from 2006 through 2010 was a 26-40 inch PSL (only one fish over 40 inches allowed in possession) and beginning with the 2011 fishing season opener, this slot limit was widened to a 26-44 inch protected slot (only one fish over 44 inches allowed in possession) to increase protection for large pike. <br> \n <br> \nPresent Fish Population Status  <br> \nThe 2013 walleye gill net catch-per-effort (CPE) was 48.6 per gill net.  After restoration efforts, walleye density initially peaked in 2003, slowly declined over the next few years and peaked to record levels in 2012. Current walleye biomass is still near record-high, largely due to the incredibly strong 2009 and 2011 year classes.  Walleye from 11 different age classes between ages 1 to 14 were sampled with the oldest fish representing the 1999 year class.  Approximately two-thirds of the catch consisted of age 2 and age 4 fish from the aforementioned strong year classes.  Sixty-four percent of the 2013 gill net catch was between 12 and 17 inches and 35% was between 14 and 17 inches.  This size distribution suggests that fishing and the ability to find \"keeper\" walleyes should be good for the foreseeable future.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike density in Upper Red Lake is low, which is actually a desirable condition for lakes that are being managed for trophy pike.  This low density population produces individuals that reach large sizes (> 40 inches) and recent ice-out trap net assessment have captured northern pike approaching 46 inches in length with good numbers of fish over 40 inches in length.   <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch CPE in 2013 was 11.6 fish/net and included good numbers of keeper-sized fish.  Yellow perch population abundance has nearly returned to pre-walleye collapse levels after going through a period of low abundance during the 2000s.  Growth rates of yellow perch in Upper Red Lake are good and 27% of the yellow perch catch was greater than 9 inches in length.  This has resulted in increased angling success with some anglers putting together catches of nice-sized fish.  <br> \n  <br> \nA few small year classes of black crappie have been documented in recent assessments and creel surveys and most of these fish are 10 to 11 inches.  Although these fish represent the first recruitment beyond age 0 since the \"crappie boom\" in the late 1990s, they appear to be of modest strength and don't likely signal the next crappie boom.  However, it is possible that anglers may pick up a few more \"bonus\" crappies while fishing walleyes than they have over the past few years. <br> \n</p>",

The remaining 40% (48,000 acres) falls under the jurisdiction of the State of Minnesota. The collapse of the Red Lakes Walleye population in the mid 1990's has been well documented. Similarly, the cooperative recovery effort that included a total closure on Walleye harvest, a short-term Walleye fry stocking program, intensified population monitoring, and increased law enforcement efforts has been widely publicized.  In 2006, the Red Lakes were re-opened to Walleye fishing under a conservative set of harvest regulations. Walleye harvest allocations, as outlined in the harvest management plan, are based on the proportion of surface water acreage within each jurisdiction. Specific fishing methods and regulations for managing harvest within the allocations are determined individually within each jurisdiction. From 2006 when the Walleye fishery was reopened though summer 2015, the Walleye population was managed with a protected slot limit. In December 2015, the size restriction for Walleye was modified to a \"one over\" regulation that allows the harvest of one fish over a designated size.  This regulation is designed to allow harvest of fish over a broad size range and not focus the harvest on any particular size class of Walleye.  The winter 2016-2017 Walleye fishing regulation was a three fish bag/possession limit with one fish allowed over 17 inches.  The bag limit beginning on the May 13, 2017 Fishing Opener will be increased to four fish, with one fish allowed over 17 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nIn addition to special Walleye regulations, a special harvest regulation for Northern Pike has been in place since the 2006 fishing opener.  The regulation from 2006 through 2010 was a 26-40 inch PSL (only one fish over 40 inches allowed in possession) and beginning with the 2011 fishing season opener, this slot limit was widened to a 26-44 inch protected slot (only one fish over 44 inches allowed in possession) to increase protection for large pike. <br> \n <br> \nPresent Fish Population Status  <br> \nThe 2016 Walleye gill net catch-per-effort (CPE) was 29.0 per gill net.  The incredibly strong 2009 and 2011 year classes continue to dominate the population with most of these fish measuring between 15 and 18 inches.  This should mean that anglers should have no problem catching their \"under\"  fish this summer and there is also a good number of fish from 17 to 20 inches in the population to provide that one fish over 17 inches for the frying pan.  Although Upper Red Lake has one of the highest Walleye catch rates in the state, it is not known for producing large fish.  However, fish in the low twenties are fairly common and provide a nice surprise when they cooperate. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike density in Upper Red Lake is low, which is actually a desirable condition for lakes that are being managed for trophy pike.  This low density population produces individuals that reach large sizes (> 40 inches) and recent ice-out trap net assessment have captured Northern Pike approaching 46 inches in length with good numbers of fish over 40 inches in length.   <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch CPE in 2016 was 13.0 fish/net and included good numbers of keeper-sized fish.  Yellow Perch population abundance has nearly returned to pre-Walleye collapse levels after going through a period of low abundance during the 2000s.  Growth rates of Yellow Perch in Upper Red Lake are good and 65% of the Yellow Perch catch was greater than 9 inches in length.  This has resulted in increased angling success with some anglers putting together catches of nice-sized fish.  <br> \n  <br> \nA few moderate year classes of Black Crappie have been documented in recent assessments and creel surveys and most of these fish are 10 to 13 inches.  Although these fish represent the first recruitment beyond age 0 since the \"crappie boom\" in the late 1990s, they appear to be of modest strength and don't likely signal the next crappie boom.  However, it is possible that anglers may pick up a few more \"bonus\" crappies while fishing Walleye than they have over the past few years. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Upper Red Lake is a 120,000 acre lake, 60% (72,000 acres) of which is under the jurisdiction of the Red Lake Band of Chippewa Indians (Red Lake Band). The remaining 40% (48,000 acres) falls under the jurisdiction of the State of Minnesota. The collapse of the Red Lakes Walleye population in the mid 1990's has been well documented. Similarly, the cooperative recovery effort that included a total closure on Walleye harvest, a short-term Walleye fry stocking program, intensified population monitoring, and increased law enforcement efforts has been widely publicized.  In 2006, the Red Lakes were re-opened to Walleye fishing under a conservative set of harvest regulations. Walleye harvest allocations, as outlined in the harvest management plan, are based on the proportion of surface water acreage within each jurisdiction. Specific fishing methods and regulations for managing harvest within the allocations are determined individually within each jurisdiction. From 2006 when the Walleye fishery was reopened though summer 2015, the Walleye population was managed with a protected slot limit. In December 2015, the size restriction for Walleye was modified to a \"one over\" regulation that allows the harvest of one fish over a designated size.  This regulation is designed to allow harvest of fish over a broad size range and not focus the harvest on any particular size class of Walleye.   <br> \n <br> \nIn addition to special Walleye regulations, a special harvest regulation for Northern Pike has been in place since the 2006 fishing opener.  The regulation from 2006 through 2010 was a 26-40 inch protected slot limit (PSL) with only one fish over 40 inches allowed in possession. Beginning with the 2011 fishing season opener, this slot limit was widened to a 26-44 inch PSL with only one fish over 44 inches allowed in possession, to increase protection for large pike.  This regulation is being reviewed during summer 2019 and we will be taking public input on a proposal to modify the PSL to 30 to 40 inches.  The three fish bag limit and one fish allowed over the slot would remain unchanged. <br> \n <br> \nPresent Fish Population Status  <br> \nThe 2018 Walleye gill net catch-per-effort (CPE) was 32.8 per gill net.  The incredibly strong 2011 year class continues to dominate the population with most of these fish measuring between 16 and 20 inches.  Most of these fish will be available for harvest under a new \"one over 20 inches\" size regulation, implemented for the 2019 open water season.  Fish from the 2013 and 2014 year classes (about 14-16 inches) will also contribute to angler catches.  Although Upper Red Lake has one of the highest Walleye catch rates in the state, particularly in May and June, it is not known for producing large fish.  However, fish up to 20 inches are common and will provide plenty of harvest opportunity this spring.  Harvest of fish between 17-20 inches is intended to reduce surplus spawning stock which has likely been suppressing recruitment of new young fish into the population.  Anglers should be aware that this regulation will be temporary until spawning stock is reduced to more optimal levels for successful reproduction and survival of young Walleye.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike density in Upper Red Lake is low, which is actually a desirable condition for lakes that are being managed for trophy pike.  This low density population produces individuals that reach large sizes (> 40 inches) and recent ice-out trap net assessment have captured Northern Pike up to 44 inches in length with tremendous numbers of fish over 36 inches in length.   <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch gill net catch rate in 2018 was 11.7 fish/net.  Yellow Perch population abundance is comparable to the last few years, but most fish that will be caught while Walleye fishing will be big enough to keep.  Growth rates of Yellow Perch in Upper Red Lake are good and 63% of the Yellow Perch catch was greater than 9 inches in length.  This has resulted in increased angling success with some anglers putting together decent catches of nice-sized fish.  <br> \n  <br> \nA few moderate year classes of Black Crappie have been documented in recent assessments and creel surveys and most of these fish are 10 to 14 inches.  Although these fish represent the first recruitment beyond age 0 since the \"crappie boom\" in the late 1990s, they appear to be of modest strength and don't likely signal the next crappie boom.  Anglers may pick up a few of these \"bonus\" crappies while fishing Walleye, but success will be limited. <br> \n</p>",
