                "narrative": "<p>Gilstad and Little Gilstad Lakes are considered one lake for fisheries management purposes.  The channel between the two lakes allows free movement of fish and can be navigated by boats.  Gilstad Lake is located three miles south of Blackduck in southeast Beltrami County.  There is a US Forest Service concrete public access on the south end of the lake.  Both lakes total 294 acres with a maximum depth of 55 feet (on Gilstad Lake).  The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different lake classes based on physical and chemical characteristics.  Gilstad Lake is in lake class 25.  Other area lakes in the same lake class include Turtle River, Itasca, Long Lost, Balm, Beltrami, Big Buzzle, Big Moose and Pimushe Lakes.  Typically lakes in this class are clear, deep, hardwater lakes with irregular shaped shorelines.  The lake is within the Chippewa National Forest.  There is a DNR disability accessible fishing pier at the public access.  Also, within casting distance of the fishing pier are fish cribs that were installed by the USFS.  DNR Fisheries manages the lake for black crappie, bluegill, walleye and northern pike.If anglers are looking for a small quiet lake with a multitude of species to fish for, Gilstad Lake would be a good choice.  Northern pike are abundant and have the potential to be quite large in the lake.  Pike sampled in 2004 ranged in length from 16 to 36 inches with an average length and weight of 23 inches and 3.3 pounds.  Anglers can expect to catch numerous pike in the 20 - 24 inch range.  Pike feed mainly on yellow perch, white sucker and tullibee.  Ages 1 -7 were present with ages 3 an 4 comprising 55% of the sample.  Growth of pike is above average.  At three years old, pike were 21 inches.Even though walleye fingerling have been stocked on a two out of three year rotation in Gilstad Lake, they are not abundant.  There does not appear to be any dominant size range, just a scattering of fish over a wide range of lengths.  Walleye sampled in 2004 were 8 to 26 inches in length.Historically black crappie have always been abundant in Gilstad Lake, and the 2004 assessment had the highest catch rates ever.  Crappie sampled in 2004 ranged from 4 to 10.4 inches long with an average length of 8 inches.  The reason crappie are so abundant in Gilstad Lake is because of the consistent production of young crappies.  Five consecutive year classes were sampled in 2004.Yellow perch are also abundant but small in Gilstad Lake.  Only one perch was sampled that was greater than 8 inches long.  They are, however, excellent forage for predator fish such as northern pike and walleye.Bluegill is another species that anglers can do well fishing for.  With the many small bays and irregular shoreline, anglers have many areas to check out when fishing for bluegill.  Bluegill sampled in 2004 ranged in length from 3 to 8.4 inches with an average length of 5.6 inches.  Approximately 30% of the sampled bluegill were greater than 7 inches long.Quality-sized bluegill are disappearing from many of our lakes due to excessive harvest by anglers.  If we are going to maintain some quality in our bluegill populations, anglers will need to show some voluntary restraint when bluegill are really biting.  By practicing selective harvest, anglers could harvest the smaller more abundant bluegill for eating, and release some of the medium to large fish.  This would help maintain balance in the population and ensure the opportunity to catch large bluegill in the future.Other fish sampled in 2004 include pumpkinseed sunfish, rock bass, bullheads, largemouth bass and bowfin (dogfish).</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Gilstad and Little Gilstad lakes are 295 acres combined with a maximum depth of 55 feet located 5 miles south of the city of Blackduck in Beltrami County. There is a U.S. Forest Service public water access with a concrete ramp and parking for about 5 trucks/trailers on the south shore of the lake off of County highway 39. Gilstad Lake is managed for Bluegill, Black Crappie, Walleye, and Northern Pike. Statewide fishing regulations apply to all species. <br> \n <br> \nA number of Black Crappie were captured during the survey with lengths ranging from around 4 to just under 12 inches. Gilstad Lake has been known locally as a boom or bust crappie fishery that has provided exceptional opportunity on occasion. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill are low in abundance but have the potential to reach lengths desirable to anglers. Bluegills over 9 inches were measured during the survey but the average length was just over 5 inches. A strong 2019 year class was also present but will take a few years before they reach desirable sizes. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye are stocked as fingerlings every other year and the catch in 2022 was similar to previous surveys. Walleye lengths were found near 23 inches and the average weight was over two pounds per fish. Despite the appearance of low abundance, local anglers suggest that occasionally Gilstad can provide some quality Walleye fishing. <br> \n <br> \nIn recent years, Northern Pike abundance has increased. The largest captured in the 2022 assessment was over 38 inches long, though most pike were between 19 and 23 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nThe Yellow Perch catch rate was over 26 fish/gill net which was higher than most area lakes. Yellow Perch averaged over 6 inches in length and a good portion of fish over 9 inches were captured in the survey. Perch are not only popular with anglers, but also one of the most important forage species for Walleye and pike. <br> \n <br> \nTullibee (Cisco) are another incredibly important forage species but can also provide angling opportunity late in the winter. The 2022 survey showed strong numbers with lengths over 19 inches present. <br> \n <br> \nOther species captured in this survey were Rock Bass, Largemouth Bass, White Sucker, Bullhead species, and a variety of sunfish species. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Gilstad Lake is a 257-acre lake, located 5 miles south of Blackduck in Beltrami County. A targeted survey was completed on Gilstad Lake by Bemidji Area Fisheries staff during June of 2022 to assess the nearshore fish community and overall health of the lake. <br> \n <br> \nIn this survey, 10 nearshore sites (100-foot) were evenly spaced along the lakeshore to sample a variety of aquatic habitat types and collect a representative sample of the nearshore fish community. Depending on the habitat conditions at each site, backpack electrofishing and shoreline seining were attempted where possible. A total of 8 sites were sampled with a seine, while backpack electrofishing was completed at all 10 sites. A total of 12 species were sampled, which included 2 species (Iowa Darter and Rock Bass) captured that are intolerant to disturbance or poor water quality. <br> \n <br> \nNearshore fish community data was analyzed with information collected from the standard survey in 2022 to calculate a Fish-based Index of Biotic Integrity (FIBI) score to measure the biological condition and overall health of Gilstad Lake. In Minnesota, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and healthy habitat (e.g. Blacknose Shiner, Mimic Shiner, Tullibee (cisco), and Mottled Sculpin), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g. Black Bullhead, Fathead Minnow, and Green Sunfish). The combination of fish species present may identify stressors negatively affecting the lake environment. The FIBI score is composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics to indicate the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. For additional information on FIBI search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources website (www.mndnr.gov). <br> \n <br> \nResults of this survey indicate Gilstad Lake is in poor health with a FIBI score below the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes. In coordination with the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency, data from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Mississippi River (Headwaters) Watershed assessment. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of nearshore fish species in Gilstad Lake was conducted beginning on July 17, 2023, by Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program staff. Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake, and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at ten sampling stations, but one station was sampled from the boat due soft sediments. A 50-foot seine was used to sample three stations, a 15-foot seine was used at three stations, and site conditions prevented the use of seines at four stations. Nearshore sampling captured eight species of fish including one species that is intolerant of disturbance (i.e., Mimic Shiner) and none that are tolerant of disturbance. <br> \n <br> \nA concurrent summer trap net survey was also conducted by IBI Program staff. Twelve trap nets were set along the shoreline in locations that encompassed multiple habitat types. Trap net sampling captured 7 species of fish, but none considered intolerant of disturbance..Bluegill and Yellow Perch comprised a majority of the catch by number, whereas Bluegill and Northern Pike comprised a majority by biomass. <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore and trap net data were combined with a June 2022 gill net to describe the fish community and provide a fish-based IBI (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment. In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g., Blackchin Shiner, Iowa Darter, and Rock Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g., Black Bullhead and Green Sunfish). The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.  <br> \n <br> \nResults from this survey indicate that the fish community in Gilstad Lake is adversely impacted by stressors as indicated by an FIBI score below the impairment threshold determined for similar lakes. These results will be considered when the biological health of the lake is assessed during the Mississippi - Headwaters Watershed assessment process, which will be completed in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency. <br> \n <br> \nA temperature-dissolved oxygen profile was collected in the deepest basin on Gilstad Lake on August 1, 2023, to evaluate the amount of cold, oxygenated water (i.e., oxythermal habitat) available to Cisco, also known as Tullibee. Based on the profile, the top of the thermocline (i.e., the location in the water column with the sharpest transition from warm to cold water) occurred at approximately 13 feet. Dissolved oxygen decreased to below 3.0 mg/L at 15.1 feet, which was above the thermocline, at the time of sampling. The temperature at which dissolved oxygen decreased to below 3.0 mg/L (i.e., TDO3, a single variable to characterize oxythermal habitat) was 14.9?C (58.8?F). <br> \n <br> \nTDO3 values cooler than 21.5?C indicate that oxythermal conditions are favorable for Cisco. Dissolved oxygen concentrations below the thermocline indicate that suitable oxythermal habitat for Cisco was available across a range of depths at the time of sampling during the summer of 2023. Data collected in 1998-2016 further indicate suitable oxythermal habitat across years, with the least favorable conditions recorded in 2004. When adequate oxythermal habitat is available, Cisco are not squeezed into unfavorable, warmer water conditions and therefore do not experience higher levels of stress. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Gilstad Lake (04-0024-00) is a 256-acre lake with a maximum depth of 55 feet located 5 miles south of the city of Blackduck in Beltrami County.  There is a U.S. Forest Service public water access with a concrete ramp and parking for about 10 trucks/trailers on the south shore of the lake off of HWY 39.  Gilstad Lake is managed for Bluegill, Black Crappie, Walleye and Northern Pike.  Statewide fishing regulations apply to all species. <br> \n <br> \nThe Minnesota Department of Natural Resources has classified Minnesota lakes based on similarities in lake basin (depth, size) and water chemistry (alkalinity, water clarity).  Gilstad Lake is in lake class 25.  The following discussion makes comparisons between Gilstad Lake and other class 25 lakes in the state.  Other Bemidji area lakes in this class include Turtle River Lake, Movil Lake and Pimushe Lake. <br> \n <br> \nThe 2016 Bluegill catch rate was 9.58/trap net.  Bluegill had a good average size of 6.83 inches and 0.29 lbs/fish.  Sixteen percent of the catch exceeded 8 inches, and the largest Bluegill captured measured 9.17 inches in length. <br> \n <br> \nThe 2016 Black Crappie catch rate of 2.75/trap net was near the top end of the range found in similar lakes (0.75/trap net - 3.18/trap net).  However, the average size of Black Crappie was small at 8.60 inches in length and averaging about 1/3 of a pound. <br> \n   <br> \nThe 2016 Northern Pike catch rate of 10.67/gill net is up considerably from levels recorded in the past several assessments.  Northern Pike captured had an average size of 21.63 inches in length and 2.32 lbs/fish.  The largest Northern Pike captured in the 2016 assessment measured 32.48 inches in length.  <br> \n <br> \nThe 2016 Walleye catch rate of 0.17/gill net was very low compared to previous surveys of Gilstad Lake, and disappointing for a fingerling stocked lake.  Only one Walleye was captured in this assessment, although anglers encountered during this assessment reported good success for Walleye recently in Gilstad Lake. <br> \n <br> \nA Largemouth Bass night electrofishing assessment was also conducted in late May of 2016 to evaluate the bass population on Gilstad Lake.  During the two hours of electrofishing, 44 bass were captured, measured, and released.  Lengths ranged from 7.1 to 20.5 inches and averaged 15.7 inches.  Of the 44 fish captured, 68% were over 15 inches indicating a quality population.   <br> \n <br> \nOther species of fish captured during the 2016 assessment were Pumpkinseed, Bowfin, Yellow Perch, White Sucker, and Bullhead species.   <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

The assessment consisted of 29 survey sites evenly spaced 200 meters around the lake. Assessments were made in three habitat zones: Shoreline Zone (the shore-water interface to the top of the natural bank), Shoreland Zone (land-ward from shoreline to development structure or 100 feet), and Aquatic Zone (lake-ward 50 feet of shoreline). The average lakewide habitat score was 88.1 (+/- 3.1) out of 100 possible. A score of 88.1 indicates the lakewide shoreline condition is High (85-92). Approximately 17 percent of the sites were developed with a mean score of 65.7 (+/- 14.2) indicating shoreline habitat quality of developed sites is Poor (50-66), while undeveloped sites had a mean score of 92.8 (+/- 1.3) with Excellent (92+) habitat quality.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Gilstad (249 acres) and Little Gilstad (40 acres) are recognized by the Division of Waters inventory as individual lakes.  For fish management purposes, they were surveyed as one.  All following references to Gilstad Lake refer to both basins combined.  Gilstad Lake is located about 4 miles south of Blackduck, Minnesota and east of county road 39 (Scenic Highway).  A public access owned by the U.S. Forest Service is on the south end of the lake.  The boat ramp is of concrete logs, and there are parking facilities for about ten car/trailer fishing rigs.  A disabled accessible fishing pier is also located at the access.  Log cribs designed to attract fish to the area are situated near the pier to improve shore fishing success.  Fish populations are compared with other similar lakes including Big Moose, Pimushe, Turtle River, Beltrami and Movil Lakes in the Bemidji area.  Primary management is for largemouth bass, northern pike and bluegill with secondary species listed as walleye and black crappie.    The Gilstad Lake fish community consists of a variety of centrarchid species.  Largemouth bass are difficult to sample with standard assessment nets.  None were captured in 1998, but they are present.  Past assessments have captured bass to 18.5 inches.  Bluegill were not as abundant as in past assessments but the catch rate was within the range found in comparable lakes.  Unusually cool temperatures during normal spawning periods in 1992 and 1993 limited reproduction of bluegill and may be responsible for the current low abundance.  Better spawning success in recent years has resulted in numerous young fish with a smaller average size than normal.  The mean length of bluegill measured was 6.2 inches and the largest was 8.7 inches.  Black crappie catch rate was within the normal range found in comparable lakes.  All year classes since 1992 were sampled.  The largest crappie sampled was 10.9 inches long and the average length was 7.1 inches.  Rock bass were small averaging 5.4 inches long, and abundance was comparable to other lakes.  Pumpkinseed sunfish were present but not common. They ranged from 3.4-7.5 inches long.    Northern pike are commonly sought by anglers on Gilstad Lake, and they are generally large enough to be acceptable to anglers.  The mean length of pike in 1998 was 22.5 inches and the largest was more than 38 inches long.  Nearly half the pike examined had Neascus (black spot), a common fish parasite that is not harmful to humans.    Walleye abundance may be at its lowest level since 1970.  Only a few small fish, probably resulting from the 1996 stocking, were sampled.  It appears that there is little contribution from natural reproduction.    Yellow perch are common but with an average length of 5.8 inches and a maximum of 6.7 inches few of them are acceptable to anglers.  Yellow grub and Neascus are present but their incidence is low.    Tullibee are abundant but not readily caught by anglers.  Fall netting for them is authorized but the extent of their harvest is not known.  They are good forage for northern pike.    Bullheads are not abundant but some larger ones (10-13 inches) may be acceptable to anglers. White suckers and dogfish (bowfin) are also present.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Gilstad Lake is a 294-acre lake located three miles south of the town of Blackduck in Beltrami County, and lies within the boundaries of the Chippewa National Forest.  The maximum depth is 55 feet.  Gilstad Lake is actually two distinct lake basins that are connected by a navigable channel and considered one lake for fisheries management purposes.  Gilstad is a class 25 lake; other class 25 lakes in the Bemidji area include Turtle River, Beltrami, Big Moose, and Pimushe Lakes.  These lakes are deep, clear, hardwater lakes with irregularly shaped shorelines.  The 2011 fisheries management plan lists bluegill and black crappie as the primary management species, with walleye and northern pike managed as secondary species.  A single lane, concrete boat ramp with parking for about 8 trucks/trailers is located on the south shore.  There is also an accessible public fishing pier with fish attracting habitat structures placed nearby.  Fishing pressure on Gilstad Lake is thought to be low to moderate. <br> \nGilstad Lake is a small, quiet lake that offers diverse fishing opportunities.  The shoreline of the lake is mostly undeveloped bog, with a small number of lake homes and one resort.  Steep shoreline breaks, fallen trees and abundant aquatic vegetation provide good habitat for bluegill and black crappie.  Catch rates for bluegill in the 2010 population assessment were near the median value for this lake class, while catch rates for black crappie were nearly twice the median value.  These fish relate to the shorelines in the springtime, and can be found on weed lines or suspended over deeper water later in the summer.  Bluegill up to 9.0 inches in length were captured in the 2010 assessment with the majority of fish between 5.0 and 8.0 inches in length.  Black crappie up to 11.5 inches were captured, and a wide range of age classes were identified in the catch which should provide some consistent angling in the near future.    <br> \nThere is a fishable walleye population in Gilstad Lake, although catch rates for walleye in the 2010 assessment were below the median for this lake class.  Gilstad has never been known as a \"numbers\" walleye lake, but fish tend to be large.  Mean weight of a walleye captured in the 2010 assessment was 2.5 pounds, which is well above the median size (1.7 pounds) for this lake class.  Along with walleye fingerling stocking on alternate years, the population may be sustained by fish immigrating from the North Branch of the Turtle River.  During some years the contribution of river fish to the Gilstad population could be substantial.  Classic walleye structure, such as under water points and humps, is not abundant in Gilstad Lake and anglers may find walleye relating more to weedlines or suspended over deeper water.   <br> \nWith a suitable forage base (tullibee cisco) for large predators Gilstad Lake is capable of producing large northern pike.  Mean weight of northern pike captured in the 2010 assessment was 2.7 pounds, which is well above the median of 2.0 pounds for this lake class.  The largest northern pike captured in the assessment was a 9-year old fish that was 39.6 inches in length.  Northern pike utilize a wide variety of habitats from the fishing opener through mid summer, and larger fish tend to suspend above the thermocline and follow the tullibee schools later in the summer.   <br> \nAlthough not known for its largemouth bass, Gilstad Lake has a good bass population and diversity of habitat for this species.  Extensive bulrush stands, lily pads and submergent vegetation offer many potential locations and solitude to the bass angler.   <br> \n</p>",
