Walleye lengths ranged from 6 to 28 inches but the majority of fish are 16 inches and smaller.  Wilmert should provide good walleye fishing for the next few years.Black crappie are also managed for in Wilmert Lake.  The population is low to normal for lakes similar to Wilmert but the most abundant year class averaged 8 inches in 1993.  Black crappie fishing may be fair in 1994 and 1995.  However, there is not a real strong year class present to provide great fishing.  Bluegill are not specifically managed for in Wilmert Lake but a moderate population of large fish exist.  Bluegill averaged nearly 8.5 inches and should provide anglers with an occasional bonus species.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of the nearshore fish community in Wilmert Lake was conducted by Fisheries Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program Staff starting June 24, 2019. Ten sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot seine. Nearshore sampling captured 9 native species of fish. None of these species are intolerant of disturbance and four species are tolerant of disturbance (Bigmouth Buffalo, Black Bullhead, Fathead Minnow, and Orangespotted Sunfish). <br> \n <br> \nData from this targeted nearshore survey is combined with trap net and gill net data from an August 2018 standard survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based Index of Biological Integrity (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment. In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g., Iowa Darter and Rock Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g., Black Bullhead and Fathead Minnow). The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website. <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey will contributed biological information about the health of the fish community in Wilmert Lake to the Blue Earth River Watershed assessment of surface waters process completed in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Wilmert Lake is managed primarily for walleye.  The walleye population continues to be in good shape and at the level DNR Fisheries have targeted.  Although Wilmert Lake receives periodic walleye stocking, the majority of the walleye sampled in 1997 came from natural reproduction.  Wilmert Lake is one of many lakes in southwestern Minnesota to experience good natural reproduction in recent years.  Walleye lengths ranged from 6 to 27 inches with most fish from 14 to 19 inches.  Wilmert should provide good walleye fishing for the next few years.Black crappie are also managed for in Wilmert Lake.  Black crappie net catches have increased from 1990 to 1997.  In 1997, the number of fish/net was higher than most lakes similar to Wilmert.  Black crappie lengths ranged from 4 to nearly 12 inches.  Anglers might find decent fishing since there are good numbers of 9 to 11 inch fish.  However, in a year or two, the strong 1996 year class should be at a size anglers prefer.Bluegill numbers continue to be low in Wilmert Lake.  Low bluegill numbers are not surprising because Wilmert Lake does not have the habitat necessary to produce large numbers of bluegill.  However, the bluegill are large, averaging more than 8 inches.To promote and maintain healthy fish populations, pollution needs to be controlled.  Fish habitat is directly affected by water quality.  Nutrients, sediments and other waste can drastically alter the chemical and physical characteristics of a lake.  It is important to maintain, if not improve, the water quality of Wilmert Lake through watershed management.  Improved land use practices should insure that this fishery can be enjoyed by future generations.In order to promote and maintain healthy fish populations, pollution needs to be controlled.  Fish habitat is directly affected by water quality.  Nutrients, sediments and other waste can drastically alter the chemical and physical characteristics of a lake.  It is important to maintain, if not improve, the water quality of Wilmert Lake through watershed management.  People often associate water quality problems in a lake with land use practices in the watershed but lakeshore property owners also contribute to water quality problems.  For example, putting in sand beaches, removing trees and aquatic vegetation, fertilizing lawns, and mowing lawns down to the lakeshore can also be harmful.  Improved land use practices by everyone will help insure this fishery can be enjoyed by future generations.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p> Wilmert Lake is a 362-acre lake located 5 miles south of the city of Fairmont in Martin County.  Wilmert Lake has a maximum depth of 8.0 feet and is managed primarily for northern pike and secondarily for walleye and yellow perch.  The Wilmert Lake outlet flows into Amber Lake through Mud Lake.  Amber Lake is part of a chain of Lakes known as the \"Fairmont Chain\" that supports a diverse fish community.  High water levels connect these lakes frequently and fish movement throughout the \"Fairmont Chain\" of lakes is common.  The substrate in Wilmert Lake is dominated by a layer of muck over a base of sand and gravel.  Some areas of rubble can be found near the shoreline and are most likely from field stone that was dumped into the lake after it was removed from area farm fields and/or wave action.  A full fish and aquatic vegetation survey was conducted during the week of August 6th, 2010. <br> \n <br> \nWilmert Lake is particularly susceptible to low dissolved oxygen levels in the winter, which then leads to pocket winterkills of fish.  Over the last 40 years, Wilmert Lake has experienced 12 documented winterkills with the last major winterkill during the winter of 2000-2001.  After that severe winterkill in 2000-01, a vegetation and fish survey was conducted.  Seven different species of aquatic vegetation were present and made fish and vegetation sampling extremely difficult as the lake was fully covered with the vegetation.  Fish known to reduce submergent vegetation such as adult common carp, adult black bullhead, and adult bigmouth buffalo were rare or not present during sampling of 2000-01.  During the current 2010 survey, the vegetation has nearly disappeared and the undesired fish (adult carp and adult bigmouth buffalo) have returned.  Only one species of aquatic vegetation is present (river bulrush).  It is apparent that connection to Amber Lake and the Fairmont Chain is adequate enough when water levels are high (as they have been regularly since the last major winterkill in 2000-2001) to allow fish movement as indicated by the return of common carp, and bigmouth buffalo.  Other species caught during the 2010 survey were black bullhead, black crappie, bluegill, fathead minnow, freshwater drum, golden shiner, northern pike, orangespotted sunfish, spotfin shiner, walleye, white crappie, white sucker and yellow perch indicating that other more desirable species are also utilizing the connection from Amber Lake.  <br> \n <br> \nThe northern pike catch rate in 2010 was 0.2 fish/trap net, only 2 fish were caught.  The two pike caught were 37 and 39 inches.  The abundance of northern pike was low and smaller northern pike were absent from the sample.  To increase the abundance of northern pike in Wilmert Lake fish were stocked in the spring of 2010.  No northern pike from the spring 2010 stocking were found in the summer 2010 survey which may indicate significant predation by other species of fish.  Also, it may be that the fish emigrated to the other \"Fairmont Chain\" lakes.  Habitat in Wilmert Lake may need to improve to sustain a population of northern pike at an acceptable abundance.  <br> \n <br> \nThe walleye catch rate during 2010 was 11.0 fish/gill net, which is within the expected range for this type of lake (2.3 to 18.1 fish/gill net) and greater than the long-term average catch rate of 8.0 fish/gill net.  The trap net catch rate was 10.4 fish/trap net, which is 3 times the expected range (3.0 fish/trap net).  With a trap net catch rate as high as was observed and a gill net catch rate within the interquartile range, it appears that the walleye abundance in Wilmert Lake is high.  Although walleye abundance may be high, the average length of walleye in Wilmert Lake was only 10 inches with a range of 8 to 21 inches.  The walleye population was dominated by smaller fish.   Approximately 80% of the walleye sampled were from the 2008 year class which corresponds to a year in which 364,000 walleye fry were stocked.  The walleye population was bordering between fair and poor condition indicating foraging stress.  Many times a population of fish that is dominated by a single year class will have a low condition indice.  This is most likely due to competition for limited forage resources.  As mortality increases and the abundance of the 2008 year class decreases, the overall condition will likely improve.   <br> \n <br> \nThe yellow perch catch rate in 2010 was 83.0 fish/gill net, which is more than 3 times the expected range for this type of lake (25.0 fish/gill net) and 1.5 times the long-term average of 55.9 fish/gillnet for Wilmert Lake.  The average length was 7 inches with a range of 5 to 8.5 inches.  The size structure of the yellow perch indicated a population that is dominated by smaller fish.  The population is dominated by two year classes, one year old (5 to 6 inches) and two year old (7 to 8 inches) yellow perch.  The overall condition was good and indicates that the yellow perch population is foraging successfully.  As the two strong year classes mature in 2011 and 2012 the population size structure will increase and become more balanced. <br> \n <br> \nThe black crappie catch rate was the highest ever observed in the trap net with a catch rate of 61.8 fish/net.  This catch rate is 3 times the expected range for this type of lake (20.5 fish/trap net) indicating a population that is abundant.  The average length of black crappie was 8.5 inches with a range of 4 to 10.5 inches.  Approximately 97% of the black crappie sampled was greater than 7.5 inches.  The size structure of black crappie indicated a population that is dominated by fish in the 8 to 10 inch size range.  The overall condition of the population was good and indicates they are foraging successfully.  During 2011 and 2012, if winterkill conditions do not drastically alter the fish community, the black crappie population will be dominated by fish greater than 10 inches.  The black crappie appear healthy and near shore sampling with seines and backpack electrofishing in 2010 found age 0 black crappie indicating the population is naturally reproducing.  <br> \n <br> \nOther species caught at high abundance in Wilmert Lake were freshwater drum, bigmouth buffalo, and common carp.  The freshwater drum catch rates were 121.0 fish/gill net and 12.7 fish/trap net.  Both catch rates were greater than expected (8.3 fish/gill net and 3.3 fish/trap net) and were the highest abundances ever documented.  The freshwater drum total length ranged from 8 to 15 inches with an average of 10 inches.  Nearly 90% of the freshwater drum was less than 11 inches.  The bigmouth buffalo catch rates were 6.0 fish/gill net and 3.9 fish/trap net in 2010 which was equivalent to the higher expected range for gill nets and almost 4 times the expected high for trap nets.  Bigmouth buffalo ranged from 6 to 27 inches and the mean weight of fish in the trap nets was 7 pounds.  The common carp catch rates were 8.0 fish/gill net and 4.1 fish/trap net, which are within the expected range for gill nets (1.0 to 13.8 fish/gill net) and trap nets (1.0 to 5.5 fish/trap net).  Common carp ranged in length from 13 to 27 inches with a mean length of 21 inches.  Freshwater drum, bigmouth buffalo, and common carp made up 70% of the catch by weight in 2010 and appear to be dominating the Wilmert Lake fish community.  Commercial fishing occurs in Wilmert Lake, and in November 2009 approximately 30,000 pounds of freshwater drum, bigmouth buffalo, and common carp were removed. <br> \n <br> \nSome species caught at low abundances in the nets were black bullhead, bluegill, golden shiner, white crappie, and white sucker.  All these species had catch rates that were lower than the expected range. <br> \n <br> \nTo promote and maintain healthy fish populations, pollution and other inputs need to be controlled.  Fish habitats are directly affected by water quality.  Nutrient, sediment and other waste inputs can drastically alter the biological, chemical, and physical components of a lake.  It is paramount to maintain if not improve the current water quality of Wilmert Lake through watershed management to preserve this fishery for future generations to enjoy. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Wilmert Lake is a 362-acre lake located 5 miles south of the City of Fairmont in Martin County.  Wilmert Lake has a relatively small watershed, as the watershed-to-lake ratio is 10 to 1.  Historically, Wilmert Lake has been susceptible to winterkills, however; recent mild winters have reduced winterkill frequency and severity.  Wilmert Lake is managed primarily for Northern Pike and secondarily for Yellow Perch, Walleye, and Black Crappie.  A standard survey was conducted the week of August 27, 2018, to monitor fish populations using two gill nets and nine trap nets.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike have occurred in very low abundance in Wilmert Lake, less than 0.3 per gill net dating back to 1993.  The trend was similar in 2018 as no Northern Pike were sampled in gill nets or trap nets.  Given the less frequent winterkills in this lake, top predator management could be switched from Northern Pike to Walleye, which have a stable population in Wilmert Lake.  If you are fishing for Northern Pike, remember there is a new regulation.  The limit in the southern Northern Pike zone is now two Northern Pike and both need to be 24 inches or longer.  Any Northern Pike under 24 inches must be returned to the lake immediately. <br> \n <br> \nSince 1993, Walleye catch rates have averaged 8.3 per gill net, varying from 0.0 per gill net in 2001 to 11.8 per gill net in 1997.  In 2018, the Walleye catch rate was 9.5 per gill net, which is within the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (2.3 to 18.1 per gill net).  Five year classes of Walleye were sampled including year classes from 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, and 2017. The 2013 and 2016 year classes do not correspond to fry stocking events, suggesting that some natural reproduction occurred or Walleye are moving into Wilmert Lake from another waterbody.  Lengths of Walleye ranged from 9.1 to 24.1 inches and averaged 15.2 inches.  Average length at age 1 was 9.1 inches, age-2 was 12.5 inches, age-3 was 14.7 inches, age-4 was 17.7 inches and age-5 was 18.5 inches, indicating normal growth. <br> \n <br> \nSince 2001, Yellow Perch catch rates have declined from 140.0 per gill net in 2001 to 83.0 per gill net in 2010, to 14.5 per gill net in 2018.  Despite the decrease, the 2018 catch rate of 14.5 per gill net is within the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (2.7 to 25.0 per gill net).  Yellow Perch lengths ranged from 5.6 to 9.2 inches and averaged 7.1 inches (PSD=35).   <br> \n <br> \nThe Black Crappie and White Crappie catch rates in 2018 were 25.7 per trap net and 13.6 per trap net, both exceeding their expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (Black Crappie (1.2 to 20.5 per trap net; White Crappie 0.3 to 6.0 per trap net).  Lengths of Black Crappie ranged from 6.0 to 11.1 inches and averaged 8.7 inches.  Lengths of White Crappie ranged from 3.4 to 11.8 inches and averaged 7.6 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nThe Freshwater Drum catch rate decreased from 121.0 per gill net in 2010 to 52.0 per gill net in 2018.  The Black Bullhead catch rate increased from 11.0 per gill net in 2010 to 64.5 per gill net in 2018.  Lengths of Black Bullhead ranged from 6.4 to 10.9 inches and averaged 8.8 inches.  Other species sampled included Bigmouth Buffalo, Common Carp, and White Sucker. <br> \n</p>",

THE LAST WAE STOCKING OCCURRED IN 1982 WHEN 111,000 FRY WERE STOCKED.  1989 AND 1983 COHORTS DOMINATED THE GILL NET CATCH.  GROWTH WAS SLIGHTLY ABOVE AVERAGE FOR THE AREA.  THE YEP GILL NET CPUE WAS WELL BELOW THE LOCAL MEDIAN.  GROWTH WAS ABOVE NORMAL FOR AREA LAKES.  NO AGE 1 OR 2 FISH WERE COLLECTED.  THE BLG TRAP NET CPUE OF 3.80 WAS ABOVE THE LOCAL MEDIAN.  BLG GROWTH IS WELL ABOVE THAT OF OTHER BLUEGILL POPULATIONS IN THE AREA. BLC TRAP NET CATCH RATES WERE SIX TIMES BELOW THE LOCAL MEDIAN.  GROWTH EXCEEDED LOCAL AVERAGES. ONLY ONE NOP WAS COLLECTED DURING THE SURVEY.  THE CAP TRAP NET CATCH WAS MORE THAN SIX TIMES THE LOCAL MEDIAN, HOWEVER, THE AVERAGE WEIGHT WAS ONLY 1. 24 POUNDS.  THE BLB TRAP NET CATCH WAS SLIGHTLY ABOVE THE LOCAL MEDIAN, HOWEVER, THE GILL NET CATCH WAS NEARLY DOUBLE THE LOCAL MEDIAN.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Wilmert Lake is a 362-acre lake located near the town of Fairmont in Martin County.  This class 43 lake has a maximum depth of 8.0 feet and is managed primarily for walleyes and secondarily for black crappie and bluegill.  Walleye fry and fingerlings are stocked in an alternate regime with a blank stocking year between fry and fingerlings (fry-blank-fingerling-blank).  Wilmert Lake is connected to Amber Lake via Mud Lake.  The substrate in Wilmert Lake is dominated by sand and gravel with silt more abundant in the deeper portions of the lake.  More varied aquatic vegetation was present in 2001 than during the last lake survey in 1993.  It is likely that much of the vegetation that was present during the survey was a direct result of a hard winterkill which created a void of adult fish.  As a result of fewer adult fish, water clarity was much higher which allowed both emergent and submergent vegetation to return in vast quantities.  Winterkill is not uncommon to this system as it has killed 12 times in the last 40 years with the last significant kill occurring in 1990-91.  A resurvey was conducted during the week of August 27, 2001 utilizing 1 gill net and 8 trap nets.  Only one gill net was set because of the abundance of submergent vegetation.  No walleyes were sampled in the gill net, although a few were caught in trapnets.  All of the walleyes sampled were likely from the fry stocking that was done in the spring of 2001.  Previous fall electrofishing surveys to check for walleye natural reproduction have indicated some natural reproduction does occur.  Total lengths of walleyes averaged 7.05 inches.  The winterkill in 2000 likely eliminated the older year classes of walleyes.  It will be a few years before good numbers of walleyes will be able to be caught and kept for table fare.One gillnet captured 140 yellow perch which were about 6 inches long.  Numerous small perch were abundant in the system, with most from the 2001 year class.  The fact that there are numerous smaller perch in the system bodes well for the next couple of years of perch fishing provided oxygen levels remain adequate during the winter months.The black crappie catch rate in trapnets was below average with all of the black crappie captured and aged from the 2001 year class.  Black crappie adults were stocked in May of 2001 to provide additional breeding stock into the system.  It will be a few years before the black crappie population will recover from the hard winterkill of 2000.A few bluegills about 7 inches long were caught, which surprisingly survived the winterkill.  These fish will provide the needed brood stock for future year classes in Wilmert Lake.Usually when a lake has a significant winterkill or partial winterkill, less desirable species tend to survive.  This was the case in Wilmert Lake as found by the test netting done in August.  One gillnet captured 122 bigmouth buffalo, 107 black bullhead, and 43 common carp, all of small sizes.  These species and small sizes of fish are not uncommon following a hard winterkill.  Additionally, many carp about 7 inches long were seen in trapnets.  The last two surveys done on Wilmert sampled many freshwater drum.  Many of these species are tolerant of lower oxygen and may have survived the winter in Wilmert or could be immigrating from Amber Lake via Mud Lake.   To promote and maintain healthy fish populations, pollution and other inputs need to be controlled.  Fish habitats are directly affected by water quality.  Nutrient, sediment and other waste inputs can drastically alter the biological, chemical, and physical components of a lake.  It is paramount to maintain if not improve the current water quality of Wilmert Lake through watershed management to preserve this fishery for future generations to enjoy.Other species sampled in the 2001 survey were golden shiners and white crappie.Prepared by Ryan Doorenbos  </p>",

Wilmert Lake is a class 43 lake with a maximum depth of 8.0 feet and is managed primarily for northern pike and secondarily for walleye and yellow perch.  Wilmert Lake was stocked with Lower Mississippi strain Walleye fry in the spring of 2017, due to surplus production of this strain.  The Lower Mississippi strain was last stocked decades ago, but has persisted in several area lakes despite extensive stocking of Mississippi strain Walleye.  A daytime electrofishing survey was conducted on September 13, 2017 to determine if the fry stocking was successful.  <br> \n <br> \nYoung-of-the year Walleye were captured at a rate of 33.8 per hour electrofishing, which indicates that the fry stocking was somewhat successful.  Fin clip samples were collected up to 50 age-0 walleye for genetic analysis.  Over 88% of those fish were a byproduct of stocking.  In stocked years, the goal is to attain 30.0 per hour electrofishing.  Lengths of Walleye ranged from 5.4 to 6.9 inches and averaged 6.1 inches. <br> \n</p>",
