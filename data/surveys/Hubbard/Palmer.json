                "narrative": "<p>Palmer Lake is located in southeastern Hubbard County, 15 miles southeast of Park Rapids.  Palmer Lake has a surface area of 142 acres and a maximum depth of 21 feet.  There is a county-owned public access located on the northeast shore of the lake.  Palmer Lake has exceptional water quality and provides angling for walleye, northern pike, largemouth bass, and panfish. <br> \n <br> \nThe Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics.  Palmer Lake is in lake class 29.  Other area lakes in this same classification include Boulder, Cedar, Tenth Crow Wing, Mow, and Spirit. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance was similar to other surveys since 1996, and just above the range \"typical\" for this lake class.  However, walleye gill net catch rates in surveys prior to 1996 were much higher.  The 2006 walleye gillnet catch rate of is well short of the current management goal.  Sampled walleye were small in size, with an average length and weight of 11.3 inches and 0.5 pounds.  The largest walleye sampled in 2006 measured 19.4 inches.  Palmer Lake is stocked with walleye in even numbered years.  While natural reproduction occurs, the DNR walleye fingerling stocking program is helping to maintain the walleye population in Palmer Lake.  Evaluations showed the strongest year classes of walleye were from stocked years. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch, an important forage species for walleye were sampled at their lowest levels ever on Palmer Lake.  Yellow perch abundance has been low since the 1996 survey.  Yellow perch and walleye populations in Palmer seem to be closely related.  When perch are abundant, walleye are more abundant and vice versa.  Low perch abundance in recent surveys may be responsible for poorer survival of walleye, and lower walleye abundance. <br> \n <br> \nLow numbers of northern pike are found in Palmer, however the population is composed of quality size fish.  Northern pike abundance was similar to past surveys.  Palmer Lake has beautiful sandy shorelines but lacks preferred northern pike spawning habitat of shallow, marshy areas.  Northern pike abundance is limited by this lack of spawning habitat and recruitment of young pike.  Northern pike up to 37.8 inches were sampled. <br> \n <br> \nPalmer Lake supports an abundant largemouth bass population.  Good water quality, aquatic vegetation cover, and spawning substrate provide excellent habitat for largemouth bass in Palmer Lake.  Anglers will find good numbers of bass in the 12-14 inch size range.  The number of bass sampled over 15.0 inches was low when compared to other area lakes, however big bass are present with fish measured up to 18.5 inches during the survey. <br> \n <br> \nPalmer Lake can provide good angling for both bluegill and black crappie.  Bluegill numbers were above the range \"typical\" for this lake class and similar to past surveys.  Anglers will find good numbers of bluegill in the 6-8 inch size range.  Black crappie are the less abundant of the panfish species with their population cycling from low to moderate numbers. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled included high numbers of white suckers, and low numbers of pumpkinseed and rock bass. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of nearshore fish species in Palmer Lake was conducted on August 2, 2021, by Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program staff. Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake, and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at all 10 sampling stations, but two stations were sampled from the boat due to site conditions. Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample eight stations and site conditions prevented the use of a seine at two stations. Nearshore sampling captured 10 species of fish including four species that are intolerant of disturbance (i.e., Banded Killifish, Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, and Rock Bass) and none that are tolerant of disturbance. <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore data were combined with trap net and gill net data from a June 2021 survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based IBI (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment. In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g., Blackchin Shiner, Iowa Darter, and Rock Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g., Green Sunfish). The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.  <br> \n <br> \nResults from this survey indicate that the fish community in Palmer Lake is healthy as indicated by an FIBI score that exceeds the exceptional use threshold determined for similar lakes. These results will be considered when the biological health of the lake is assessed during the Crow Wing River Watershed assessment process, which will be completed in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Test netting indicates good populations of walleyes, largemouth bass and sunfish.  The northern pike gillnet catch was near the statewide median.It is interesting to note that the moderately large walleye population is entirely from natural reproduction since no fish have been stocked since 1937.  The age-class structure of walleyes shows successful natural reproduction each year since 1952 even though good typical walleye spawning conditions appear to be lacking.  A study of the factors contributing to successful spawning in this lake could be of great value.Growth rates of predator species are good, but sunfish growth is slightly below the state average indicating a high population density under present environmental conditions.As compared with the statewide figures, the net catches are as follows: (1) There were above average catches of northern pike, yellow perch, walleyes, largemouth bass, pumpkinseeds, bluegills, and rock bass, and (2) below average catches of common sucker.  The growth rates of the northern pike, walleyes, and largemouth bass were slightly above average, and the growth rates of the pumpkinseeds and bluegills were slightly below average, when compared with the statewide figures.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Palmer Lake is located in southeastern Hubbard County, 15 miles southeast of Park Rapids.  Palmer Lake has a surface area of 142 acres and a maximum depth of 21 feet.  There is a county-owned public access located on the northeast shore of the lake.  Palmer Lake has exceptional water quality and provides angling for walleye, northern pike, largemouth bass, and panfish.The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical and chemical characteristics.  Palmer Lake is in lake class 29.  Other area lakes in this same classification include Boulder, Cedar, Tenth Crow Wing, Mow, and Spirit.Walleye abundance (3.5 walleye/gillnet) was down from past surveys.  While this walleye gillnet catch rate is at the upper end of the range \"typical\" for this lake class, walleye numbers have been much higher in past surveys.  The previous survey in 1996 had a walleye gillnet catch rate of 4.8 walleye/net, while earlier surveys ranged from 7.5 walleye/net (1984) to 20.5 walleye/net (1987).  Sampled walleye had an average length and weight of 13.5 inches and 0.9 pounds.  A successful DNR walleye finglerling stocking program is maintaining the walleye population in Palmer Lake.  Palmer Lake is stocked with walleye fingerlings in even years.  Yellow perch, an important forage species for walleye were sampled in low numbers the past two surveys.  The yellow perch population seems to be influencing walleye abundance as perch and walleye numbers cycle up and down together. Low numbers of northern pike are found in Palmer, however, the population is composed of quality size fish.  Northern were sampled in numbers (1.8 pike/gillnet) similar to past surveys and below the range \"typical\" for this lake class.  Palmer Lake has beautiful sandy shorelines but lacks preferred northern pike spawning habitat of shallow, marshy areas.  Northern pike abundance is limited by this lack of spawning habitat and recruitment of young pike.  Sampled northern pike had an average length and weight of 27.4 inches and 4.9 pounds with fish measured up to 35.1 inches.  Palmer Lake supports an abundant largemouth bass population.  Largemouth bass were sampled in very high numbers during spring electrofishing (210 bass/hour).  Small bass dominated the sample as average length was only 10.2 inches.  The number of bass sampled over 15.0 inches was low when compared to other area lakes, however, big bass are present with fish measured up to 19.6 inches.  Good water quality, aquatic vegetation cover, and spawning substrate provide excellent habitat for largemouth bass in Palmer Lake.Palmer Lake can provide good angling for both bluegill and black crappie.  Bluegill numbers (24.0 bluegill/trapnet) were within the \"typical\" range for this lake class.  Good numbers of 7 inch bluegill were sampled in Palmer.  Of the panfish, black crappie are the less abundant species with their population cycling from low to moderate numbers.  Most of the black crappie were in the 9 to 10 inch size range with crappie measured up to 13.1 inches.Other species sampled include abundant numbers of white sucker, and low numbers of pumpkinseed and rock bass.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Palmer Lake is located in southeastern Hubbard County, 15 miles southeast of Park Rapids.   Palmer Lake has a surface area of 146 acres and a maximum depth of 21 feet.  There is a county-owned public access located on the northeast shore of the lake.  Anglers and boaters should be aware that the access is narrow and parking is limited.  Palmer Lake has exceptional water quality and provides angling for Largemouth Bass, Panfish, and Walleye. <br> \n <br> \nThe Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics.  Palmer Lake is in lake class 29.   Class 29 lakes have the characteristics of a large littoral area (water depth less than 15 feet deep).  Other class 29 lakes in the Park Rapids area include: Cedar, Tenth Crow Wing, Little Island, Mirage, Mow, and Spirit. <br> \n <br> \nPalmer Lake supports a moderate Largemouth Bass population when compared to other area lakes.  Good water quality, aquatic vegetation cover, and spawning substrate provide excellent habitat for Largemouth Bass in Palmer Lake.  Anglers will find good numbers of bass in the 14-16 inch size range. <br> \n <br> \nPalmer Lake can provide good angling for both Bluegill and Black Crappie. Present and past surveys have shown that the Bluegill population in Palmer fluctuates from moderate to high numbers.  Anglers will find good numbers of Bluegill in the 6-8 inch size range.  Black Crappie are the less abundant of the panfish species with their population cycling from low to moderate numbers. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance was up from recent surveys and above the range for similar type lakes.   Good numbers of smaller Walleye in the 12-14 inch size range were sampled, with fish measured up to 25.6 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled included Northern Pike, White Sucker, Pumpkinseed, and Rock Bass. <br> \n <br> \nCurrently, no Aquatic Invasive Species (AIS) have been identified in Palmer Lake.  To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boats before leaving the access. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

A survey targeting near shore fish species was conducted by Park Rapids Fisheries Staff on 28 June 2017 to assess populations of non-game species and small sport fish. Ten 100-foot sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake shore, sampling a variety of habitat types. Each site was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot 1/8th-inch mesh seine, depending on habitat condition. <br> \n   <br> \nDuring this assessment, four sites were sampled with a 50-foot seine and four sites were sampled with a 15-foot seine. Site conditions prevented the use of seines at two sites. Backpack electrofishing was done at all ten sites, several of which were conducted from the side of the boat.  Nearshore sampling captured several species of fish including two species intolerant of disturbance such as Banded Killifish, and Blacknose Shiner.  Other species sampled during the nearshore effort included Bluegill, Bluntnose Minnow, Iowa Darter, Johnny Darter, Largemouth Bass, Rock Bass, Spotfin Shiner, White Sucker, and Yellow Perch.  Nearshore catches will be used along with gillnet and trapnet catch data from a survey on 27 June 2017, to calculate a fish-based Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) score which is indicative of the health of Palmer Lake.   <br> \n <br> \nThis survey is contributing to a watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.  Palmer Lake is located in the Crow Wing River Watershed.</p>",

Palmer Lake has a surface area of 146 acres and a maximum depth of 21 feet.  There is a county-owned earthen public access located on the northeast shore of the lake.  Anglers and boaters should be aware that the access is narrow and parking is limited.  Palmer Lake has clear water and provides angling for Largemouth Bass, Panfish, and Walleye. <br> \nThe Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics.  Palmer Lake is in lake class 29.   Class 29 lakes are characterized as having a large littoral area (water depth less than 15 feet deep) and a regular shaped shoreline.  Other class 29 lakes in the Park Rapids area include: Cedar, Little Island, Mirage, Mow, Tenth Crow Wing and Spirit. <br> \nPalmer Lake supports a healthy Largemouth Bass population when compared to other area lakes.  Good water quality, aquatic vegetation cover, and spawning substrate provide excellent habitat for Largemouth Bass in Palmer Lake.  Anglers will find good numbers of bass in the 13 - 18 inch size range. <br> \nPalmer Lake can provide good angling for both Bluegill and Black Crappie. The Bluegill population in Palmer fluctuates from moderate to high numbers.  Anglers will find most Bluegill in the 5.5 - 8 inch size range.  Black Crappie are less abundant, as their populations tend to cycle from low to moderate numbers.  The 2022 sample had low numbers of crappie, with the largest being 10.6 inches. <br> \nWalleye abundance was up from recent surveys and above the range for similar type lakes.   Good numbers of Walleye in both the 10 - 13 and 15 - 17 inch size ranges were sampled, with no Walleyes over 19 inches sampled. <br> \nCurrently, no Aquatic Invasive Species (AIS) have been identified in Palmer Lake.  To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boats before leaving the access.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Palmer Lake is located 15 miles southeast of Park Rapids on the southern edge of Hubbard County.  Palmer has a surface area of 142 acres and a maximum depth of 21 feet.  The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types, based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics.  Palmer Lake is in Lake Class 29.  Other area lakes in this same class include Boulder (1.5 miles northeast of Dorset), Cedar (10 miles northwest of Park Rapids), Tenth Crow Wing (1 mile south of Akeley), Little Island (7 miles south of Nevis), Mow (10 miles south of Akeley), and Spirit (located in Menahga).  The public access is located on the northeast shore of the lake and is owned and maintained by Hubbard County.     Walleye were sampled at 4.8/gillnet lift which is above the range typical of other class 29 lakes.  However, the 1996 walleye gillnet catch was the lowest in six surveys dating back to 1958.  The previous survey in 1990 had a walleye catch rate of 11.0/gillnet lift.  Other surveys have had walleye catch rates ranging from 7.5/gillnet to 20.5/gillnet.  Sampled walleyes ranged in length from 9.7 to 19.5 inches with an average length of 12.5 inches.  Walleye growth rates were similar to other class 29 lakes.  Three year classes of walleye were sampled, with the1994 year class comprising 56% of the walleye catch.  All sampled walleye correspond to years when walleye fingerlings were stocked.  Natural reproduction of walleye has been documented in past surveys, however, with the 1958 walleye catch of 9.8/gillnet entirely from natural reproduction.  Palmer Lake is stocked with walleye fingerlings during even calendar years at the rate of one pound per littoral acre.     The yellow perch gillnet catch of 2.0/gillnet lift is the lowest catch rate in six surveys on Palmer Lake.  The previous surveys have had gillnet catches ranging from 8.5/net to 79.3/net.  The yellow perch population in Palmer Lake is primarily a forage base for the walleye and northern pike populations and are too small in size to be acceptable to the angler.  The low perch population may be causing the drop in the walleye population due to lackof forage for young walleye and making larger walleye more susceptible to angling pressure.     Northern pike were sampled at 3.4/gillnet which is below the rate typically found in lake class 29.  However, this catch rate was similar to previous surveys which had gillnet catch ranging from 0.3/net to  3.5/net.  While a Palmer Lake may have a low to moderate catch rate of northern pike, the fish are of a quality size compared to area lakes.  Sampled northern pike ranged in length from 19.7 to 34.6 inches and averaged 26.0 inches and 4.7pounds.  Seven of the nineteen northern pike sampled (37%) were 28.0 inches or larger.       Bluegill were sampled at 36.2/trapnet which is a typical catch for lake class 29.  A quality bluegill population exists in Palmer Lake when compared to other area lakes.  Bluegill averaged 6.9 inches in length with fish up to 8.9 inches sampled.  Thirty percent of the bluegill sampled were 8.0 inches or larger. Bluegill growth rates were good and above average when compared to other class 29 lakes.  Largemouth bass were sampled at a rate typical for lake class 29 and similar to historical netting.  Standard survey gear (gillnets and trapnets) are not effective methods to assess largemouth bass abundance or size distribution.  To adequately assess a largemouth bass population special sampling such as spring electrofishing needs to be conducted.  No electrofishing has been conducted on Palmer Lake.  Palmer lake has good water quality and aquatic vegetation that will insure a healthy largemouth bass population.  Black crappie were sampled at 2.0/trapnet which is typical for class 29 lakes and similar to past surveys.  Black crappie up to 9.8 inches were sampled.  Black crappie growth rates were similar to other class 29 lakes.      Sampling indicated an abundant white sucker population in Palmer Lake.  White sucker were sampled at a rate higher than what is typically found in lake class 29.  Historical catches of white sucker have been similar.     Other species sampled included: rock bass, pumpkinseed, hybrid sunfish, and common shiner.     Anglers can help maintain or improve the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for table fare, but to release medium to large-size fish.  Releasing these fish will help maintain the fish population in Palmer Lake and provides anglers with opportunities to catch more and larger fish in the future.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Palmer Lake is located in southeastern Hubbard County, 15 miles southeast of Park Rapids.  Palmer Lake has a surface area of 144 acres and a maximum depth of 21 feet.  There is a county-owned public access located on the northeast shore of the lake.  Anglers and boaters should be aware that the access is narrow and parking is limited.  Palmer Lake has exceptional water quality and provides angling for largemouth bass, panfish, walleye, and northern pike. <br> \n <br> \nThe Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics.  Palmer Lake is in lake class 29.  Other area lakes in this same classification include Boulder, Cedar, Tenth Crow Wing, Mow, and Spirit. <br> \n <br> \nPalmer Lake supports an abundant largemouth bass population.  Good water quality, aquatic vegetation cover, and spawning substrate provide excellent habitat for largemouth bass in Palmer Lake.  Anglers will find good numbers of bass in the 12-14 inch size range.  The number of bass sampled over 15.0 inches was low when compared to other area lakes, however, bigger bass are present with fish measured up to 18.1 inches during the survey. <br> \n <br> \nPalmer Lake can provide good angling for both bluegill and black crappie.  Bluegill abundance (62.8 bluegill/trapnet) was above the range \"typical\" for this lake class and similar to past surveys.  Anglers will find good numbers of bluegill in the 6-8 inch size range.  Black crappie are the less abundant of the panfish species with their population cycling from low to moderate numbers. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance (3.0 walleye/gillnet) was at the upper end of the range \"typical\" for this lake class, and similar to other surveys since 1996.  Sampled walleye ranged in length from 11.8 to 22.8 inches.  Palmer Lake is stocked with walleye fingerlings in even numbered years.  The DNR walleye fingerling stocking program is helping to maintain the walleye population in Palmer Lake.  Evaluations showed the strongest year classes of walleye were from stocked years.  Yellow perch, an important forage species for walleye, increased in abundance from recent surveys, with the range \"typical\" for this lake class.  A few yellow perch were an acceptable size for angling with fish measured up to 10.7 inches. <br> \n <br> \nLow numbers of northern pike are found in Palmer; however, the population is composed of quality size fish.  Northern pike abundance (1.0 pike/gillnet) was similar to past surveys.  Palmer Lake has beautiful sandy shorelines but lacks preferred northern pike spawning habitat of shallow, marshy areas.  Northern pike abundance is limited by this lack of spawning habitat and recruitment of young pike.  Northern pike up to 40.6 inches were sampled. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled included high numbers of white sucker and moderate numbers of pumpkinseed and rock bass. <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n</p>",
