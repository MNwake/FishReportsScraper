THE BLG CATCH RATE WAS 1.5 TIMES THE LOCAL MEDIAN, AND THE SECOND HIGHEST CATCH FOR SNELLING LAKE SINCE 1986.  WHEN COMPARED WITH THE STATE-WIDE AVERAGE, GROWTH APPEARED TO BE AVERAGE THROUGH AGE IV+ AND BELOW AVERAGE FOR AGE V+ AND VI+.  BLG PSD (84.0) WAS THE LARGEST VALUE RECORDED SINCE THE 16-INCH MINIMUM SIZE REGULATION ON LMB WENT INTO EFFECT. HSF WERE CAPTURED AT GREATER THAN FIVE TIMES THEIR LOCAL AND TEN TIMES THEIR STATE MEDIAN.  AVERAGE SIZE WAS SMALL, WITH A RATE OF FIVE FISH PER POUND.  ABUNDANCE OF LMB DURING ELECTROFISHING (6.7/HR) WAS THE LOWEST SINCE THE STUDY BEGAN; SIXTY PERCENT (60%) WERE YOUNG-OF-THE-YEAR.  PSD WAS CALCULATED AT 100.00, BUT ONLY THREE FISH EXCEEDED THE STOCK SIZE.  ONE LMB WAS ABOVE THE LEGAL SIZE, MEASURING 16.1 INCH TOTAL LENGTH.  WHEN COMPARED TO STATE-WIDE MEANS, GROWTH OF SNELLING LAKE LMB WAS ABOUT AVERAGE. LENGTH-AT-AGE WAS THE LARGEST RECORDED IN SNELLING LAKE FOR AGE I, LOWEST RECORDED FOR AGE IV, AND INTERMEDIATE FOR AGE V AND VI.  THE ONLY OTHER SPECIES SAMPLED ABOVE LOCAL AND STATE MEDIANS IS GSF.  THESE FISH ARE QUITE SMALL, WITH A RATE OF 12.5 PER POUND.  NOP, CAP, BLB, PMK, BLC, AND YEP WERE SAMPLED AT LEVELS BELOW THEIR STATE AND LOCAL MEDIANS.  IN ADDITION, 21 BANDED KILLIFISH WERE SAMPLED IN THE SHORELINE SEINE HAULS.</p>",

HYBRID SUNFISH, PUMPKINSEED, AND BLACK BULLHEADS CATCH RATES WERE ABOVE THE LOCAL MEDIAN. GREEN SUNFISH CATCH RATE WAS AT THE MEDIAN LEVEL.

                "narrative": "<p>Snelling Lake is located in Fort Snelling State Park, one of the most popular state parks in Minnesota. Many shore-fishing locations exist, including a fishing pier on the north end of the lake.  This shallow, class 43 lake is heavily vegetated with a variety of native aquatic vegetation as well as exotic curly leaf pondweed and Eurasian water milfoil.  No gas boat motors are permitted.  Snelling Lake is equipped with an aeration system that is run to prevent winterkill in winters when oxygen levels fall low.  A population assessment was conducted during June 2009 to determine the species composition and abundance of game fish in the lake.   <br> \n <br> \nSnelling Lake has historically had a high density bluegill population (averaging 66/trap net over the previous 3 population assessments)  At 54 per trap net in 2009, bluegill abundance was again high and size structure and mean weight (0.15 lbs) were low.  Fifty-one percent of bluegill were less than 6 inches and the remaining 49% were between 6 and 6.8 inches.  Mean length was 5.9 inches.  Ages 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 were represented and growth was slower than average compared with other similar West Metro Area lakes. <br> \n <br> \nThe northern pike population has remained relatively stable over the previous 4 assessments dating back to 1995.  In the 2009 assessment, 7.5/gill net were collected.  Ninety-three percent were 21 inches or greater and 27% were 28 inches or greater.  The largest pike measured 32.5 inches  and 6.7 lbs.  Northern pike reached 19.3 inches by age 3, indicating growth is similar to other similar West Metro Area lakes.   <br> \n <br> \nOne largemouth bass was sampled, however, passive sampling gears, such as trap nets and gill nets, are not effective methods for collecting largemouth bass, so the data presented for this species is not indicative of relative abundance. Electrofishing is the typical method for largemouth bass assessments but was not conducted during this survey.  <br> \n <br> \nPumpkinseed abundance continues to be high (9.3/trap net).  Other species sampled in low abundance included black crappie, yellow perch, bowfin, green sunfish, and black, brown, and yellow bullhead.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Snelling Lake is located in Fort Snelling State Park, one of the most popular state parks in Minnesota.  Many shore-fishing locations exist including a fishing pier on the north end of the lake.  The lake is heavily vegetated with a variety of native aquatic vegetation as well as an exotic, curly leaf pondweed.  Boating is limited to electric motor propelled and motor-less boats.  Snelling Lake is equipped with an aeration system that is run to prevent winterkill in winters when oxygen levels fall low.Bluegill and largemouth bass are the primary management species in Snelling Lake.  Bluegill abundance is at historical lows for this lake, however, the trapnet catch was still 37.1 per net, above the 75th percentile level.  Mean length and weight is 6.0 inches and 0.17 pounds.  Almost 7 in 10 are larger than 6 inches, but less than 1 in ten is larger than 7 inches.  The largest bluegill captured was 7.8 inches.  Multiple year-classes were represented in the catch.  Growth rates are below average for this lake type.  Pumpkinseed sunfish were also sampled in high numbers, 12.4 per trapnet, over twice the 75th percentile level for this lake type.Largemouth bass are not well sampled in survey nets, only 1 was caught in a trapnet.No channel catfish were sampled during this survey, as they were in the 1997 survey, despite being stocked in 2002, 2000 and 1999.Northern pike are Snelling's most abundant predator species sampled in survey nets.  The catch of 6.5 pike per gillnet is between the 50th and 75th percentile for lakes of this type.  Average length and weight is 21.6 inches and 2.4 pounds.  The largest individual was 26.0 inches and 3.6 pounds.  The average pike age is 2.6 years.  Growth rates are above average.Yellow perch were sampled in low numbers.  Mean length is 6.0 inches.  Growth rates are below average.  Black crappie were sampled in very low numbers.  A total of 2 were caught in trapnets and 1 in gillnets.  Yellow and black bullhead, hybrid sunfish, green sunfish, bowfin, carp and golden shiners were also present in trapnet samples.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Snelling Lake is located in Fort Snelling State Park, one of the most popular state parks in Minnesota.  Shore fishing locations include a pier on the north end of the lake.  Boat access is available on the southern end of the lake but gas engines are prohibited.  This shallow class 43 lake is heavily vegetated with a variety of native aquatic plants as well as invasive aquatic plants that include curly leaf pond weed and Eurasian water milfoil.  Snelling Lake is equipped with a winter aeration system to help prevent winterkill brought on by low oxygen due to ice thickness and snow cover. Snelling Lake is part of the Fishing in the Neighborhood (FiN) program, and a population assessment was conducted in June of 2017 to determine species composition and abundance of game fish in the lake. For more information on FiN, please visit  http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/fishing/fin/index.html . <br> \n <br> \nBluegill abundance has shown to be high in Snelling Lake, and remained well above average for similar lakes.  Bluegill in Snelling Lake were small at 0.1 pounds per individual.  Average length was 5.0 inches and ranged between 3.1-8.2 inches.  A total of 5 Bluegill were captured by gillnet.  These individuals fell within the same range calculated from Bluegill in trap nets for length and weight, though they were nearer to the lower limit. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike abundance in Snelling Lake was well above average for similar lakes. Fifty-five percent of all Northern Pike sampled were 21 inches or greater and 16 percent were 28 inches or greater.   The largest Northern Pike captured in this survey measured 33.2 inches. The average weight for Northern Pike sampled in Snelling Lake was 2.9 pounds, an above-average value for similar lakes.  Seven Northern Pike were captured in trap nets, ranging from 16.7 to 24.4 inches in length.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie abundance was below average.  Thirteen total Black Crappie were captured and the largest was 8.4 inches in length. Pumpkinseed abundance was high in the lake.  Black Bullhead abundance was below average for similar lakes, but well above average for weight (0.5 pounds). Eighty four percent of fish sampled were greater than 9 inches in length and the largest individual was 11.4 inches.  Yellow Bullhead abundance was well-above average compared to similar lakes. <br> \n <br> \nOther species captured in low abundance included Yellow Perch, Green Sunfish, hybrid sunfish, Golden Shiner and Largemouth Bass.  It should be noted that passive sampling gears such as trap nets and gillnets are not effective for capturing Largemouth Bass.  Electrofishing is the typical method for Largemouth Bass assessments but was not conducted during this survey.  <br> \n</p>",

The largemouth bass population is above average when compared to similar lakes. The fish are below average in length, with 66.7% of the bass sampled electrofishing less than 5 inches long. The remaining 33.35 of the fish captured electrofishing were longer than 15 inches. Northern pike, while not very abundant, were above average in size.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Recent flooding of Snelling Lake has had major impacts on the fish population. The flood of 1997 allowed five new species to enter the lake from the Minnesota River. Channel catfish, river carp sucker, smallmouth buffalo, white bass, and white crappie are now part of the Snelling Lake fish community.Bluegills continue to be the most abundant species in the lake. Their population is three times higher than what is average for this type of a lake. The average length sampled was only 5.1 inches.The black crappie population had dropped since the last survey but is still within normal ranges for this type of lake. The average length sampled was 7.7 inches. Northern pike numbers have increased slightly over previous years. Their average length has also increased to 23.5 inches. Yellow perch, a major prey species, are at their highest level ever sampled.Both yellow and black bulhead numbers have dropped since the last survey. The yellow bullhead population is still above the normal range, while the black bullhead population is below the normal range.Pumpkinseed sunfish were above average in numbers but only averaged 4.4 inches in length. Green sunfish and hybrid sunfish were both present in low numbers. Bowfin (dogfish) and carp were also sampled in low numbers.</p>",
