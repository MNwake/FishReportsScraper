Only in 2021 have yearling Walleye been sampled (3.0 fish/hr). Electrofishing surveys do not seem to be effective at indexing YOY or yearling Walleye year class strength at Clear Lake; gill nets may be the best way to representatively sample walleye year classes when fish are large enough to be caught.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>STATUS OF THE FISHERY:\nGamefish species sampled in gillnets were northern pike, walleye, yellow perch and largemouth bass.  Catch data was compared to lake similar lakes across the state.  The northern pike catch (3.1/lift) was similar to previous nettings and was within the normal range for this lake type.  Several age classes were represented in the sample and growth was good.  The walleye catch (5.0/lift) was within the normal range for this lake type and has increased slightly from the previous two years.  No fish over age 3 were sampled and growth was good for these fish.  Yellow perch numbers (20.1/lift) have increased significantly from the past several years.  Many of these fish were age 4 and ranged in size from 7.5 to 10 inches in length, which should be an acceptable size to the angler.  Fish through age 6 were represented in the sample and growth was good.  Only two largemouth bass were sampled in the gillnets.  Important fish species sampled in trapnets were bluegill, black crappie and largemouth bass.  The bluegill catch (35.8/lift) was within the normal range for this type of lake.  Most of these (67%) were age 1 fish, but all age classes through age 6 were represented.  Growth was good and the older fish were a very acceptable size to the angler.  Black crappie numbers were high in both trap and gillnets (49.8 and 70.4/lift, respectively).  These numbers are both above the normal range for this lake type.  Almost 90% of these were age 1 and age 2 fish, although every age through age 6 was represented and growth was good.  The largemouth bass catch (6.2/lift), was also above the normal range for this lake type.  These were all age 1 and 2 fish and ranged in size from 4.5 to 8.4 inches.  Black bullhead appeared to be abundant.  Catch in the gillnets (240.3/lift) was above the normal range for this lake type.  These fish ranged in size from 8 to 10 inches and are currently being harvested by a commercial fisherman.  The reported commercial harvest for 1992 was 52,400 pounds.  Channel catfish fingerlings were stocked in 1985 and flathead catfish adults were stocked in 1989 and 1991.  Neither of these fish species were sampled during this survey.  However, the commercial fishing reports showed 48 catfish captured throughout the 1992 season in hoopnets, and all were released back into Clear Lake.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A standard survey was conducted at Clear Lake the week of July 5, 2017 to monitor the fish population and to do a preliminary evaluation of the 2014 Walleye stocking regime.  Gear included gill nets, trap nets, and boat electrofishing.  The 2014 lake management plan lists Bluegill, Black Crappie, and Walleye as primary management species, while Largemouth Bass and Northern Pike are listed as secondary species.  In 2017, a total of 11 species, plus Hybrid Sunfish, were sampled in the gill nets and trap nets.  Catch rates were compared to other similar lakes across the state.  Clear was not stratified on 7/5/17 and dissolved oxygen levels remained above 2 mg/L all the way to the bottom, indicating that fish were able to use the entire lake.  The water clarity was limited, with a secchi disk reading of 5.3 feet, due to an algae bloom.  A fishing pier was available at the Meeker County Park on the south side of the lake.  Clear has a history of winterkill with the last major event occurring in 2001.  Fish populations can fluctuate widely on winterkill lakes depending on the frequency and severity of the kill.  Eurasian Watermilfoil, a non-native invasive aquatic plant, was discovered in 2013.  Curlyleaf Pondweed, another aquatic invasive species, can reach nuisance levels in May and June, but typically dies back in early July.  <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled high numbers (142) of Northern Pike for a catch rate of 23.7/net, which was above what might be expected for this type of lake and was the highest ever recorded at Clear.  The 2017 catch rate was over two times higher than the previous record from 2003 (9.2/net).  This catch rate indicated that recruitment was strong at the time of this survey.  The 2013 catch rate was 2.6/net.  Historical catch rates from 1951 to 2017 (n=17) were variable ranging from 0.4 to 23.7/net with an average of 5.6.  In 2017, gill netted Northern Pike were 11.6 to 35.2 inches long with an average of 21.5.  Length frequency distribution tables indicated that multiple ages were present and that reproduction was consistent.  Approximately, 12% of the gill net sample was 26 inches or longer, showing a quality population.  Northern Pike were last stocked in 1992, indicating that natural reproduction was adequate most years at Clear.  Northern Pike anglers could expect most of their catch to be from 18 to 23 inches in length.  Spearing can be popular, but the water was not always clear enough.       <br> \n <br> \nTrap nets sampled moderate numbers (144) of Black Crappie for a catch rate of 16.0/net, which was within what might be expected for this type of lake.  The 2013 catch rate was similar at 13.2/net.  Historic catch rates from 1951 to 2017 (n=16) were variable ranging from 0.5 to 70.7/net with an average of 23.6.  Trap netted Black Crappie were 3.7 to 12.0 inches long with an average of 7.7.  Approximately 18% of the trap net catch was 9 inches or longer.  Gill nets also sampled moderate numbers (127) of Black Crappie for a catch rate of 21.2/net, which was above what might be expected for this lake type.  The 2013 catch rate was 45.9/net.  Historic gill net catch rates (n=16) were generally high, ranging from 1.8 to 182.3/net with an average of 53.4.  Gill netted fish were 4.3 to 11.2 inches long with an average of 7.7.  Size distributions indicated that multiple year classes were present and that a quality population existed at this time.  Crappie anglers should find decent fishing on Clear, and smaller fish should grow to an acceptable size within the next couple of years.  <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled moderate numbers (48) of Walleye for a catch rate of 8.0/net, which was above what might be expected for this type of lake.  The 2013 catch rate was 5.3/net.  Historic catch rates from 1951 to 2017 (n=17) were variable, ranging from 0.0 to 17.0/net with an average of 6.0.  Different stocking regimes and periods of no stocking occurred during those 66 years.  In 2017, the gill netted Walleye were 14.9 to 24.3 inches long with an average of 19.3.  Approximately 98% of the gill net catch was 15 inches or longer and 35% was 20 inches or longer, indicating a quality size structure.  The current stocking regime (958 pounds of fingerlings every other year) was initiated in 2014.  Fingerlings were stocked in 2014 and 2016.  Walleye were age-3 to age-10 with five different ages present.  Non-stocked year classes accounted for 0% of the gill net aged fish, likely indicating that natural reproduction was not significant at Clear.  Assessments in 2007, 2013, and 2017, along with past fall electrofishing assessments (n=7), all indicated a lack of natural reproduction at Clear Lake.  In 2017, growth for age-3 and age-4 fish was considered fast, when compared to statewide averages.  Increasing Northern Pike numbers (23.7/gill net) could have negative effects on Walleye management at Clear Lake, by way of predation on stocked fingerlings.  High numbers of Yellow Perch could also slow down the bite for Clear Lake Walleye anglers.  <br> \n <br> \nTrap nets sampled high numbers (795) of Bluegill for a catch rate of 88.3/net which was above what might be expected for this type of lake.  The 2013 catch rate was similar at 57.9/net.  Historic catch rates from 1951 to 2017 (n=16) were generally high, ranging from 2.3 to 205.6/net, with an average of 64.3.  In 2017, trap netted Bluegill were 3.5 to 9.4 inches long with an average of 5.3.  Approximately 43% of the trap net sample was 6 inches or longer and 7% were 8 inches or longer.  Many ages were present and natural reproduction had been consistent.  Bluegill anglers should expect plenty of action at Clear Lake.   <br> \n <br> \nSpring night-time electrofishing sampled high numbers (77) of Largemouth Bass for a catch rate of 46.2/hour, which was the highest ever recorded at Clear.  The 2013 catch rate was 20.0/hour.  Historic catch rates, from 1991 to 2017 (n=9) were variable, ranging from 0.0 to 46.2/hour with an average of 14.7.  Largemouth Bass were 3.0 to 17.3 inches long with an average of 10.9.  Approximately 40% of the catch was 12 inches or longer.  Several ages of Largemouth Bass were present.  Anglers can expect to catch good numbers of small and medium sized fish, plus the occasional large one.       <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled high numbers (307) of Yellow Perch for a catch rate of 51.2/net, which was above what might be expected for this type of lake and was the second highest on record for Clear.  The 2013 catch rate was very similar at 55.7/net.  Historic catch rates from 1951 to 2017 (n=17) were variable, ranging from 0.0 to 55.7/net with an average of 12.4.  Yellow Perch were 5.3 to 9.4 inches long with an average of 6.9.  Approximately 10% of the catch was 8 inches or longer.  Yellow Perch were likely an important forage item for Walleye, and these high numbers could make fishing difficult for anglers. <br> \n <br> \nCommon Carp were not sampled in Clear Lake in 2017.  Assessments from 1951 to 2017 never sampled Common Carp in Clear.  However, they were commercially removed from 1957 to 1970, a time when no fish surveys took place.  A reclamation event occurred in 1970 successfully eliminating Common Carp from the lake.  The large concrete dam approximately 2 miles downstream from the outlet, has prevented Common Carp from entering the lake, via County Ditch #44 and the Clearwater River.   <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled moderate to high numbers (398) of Black Bullhead for a catch rate of 66.3/net, which was within what might be expected for this lake type.  The 2013 catch rate was similar at 41.7/net.  Historic catch rates from 1951 to 2017 (n=16) were variable, ranging from 0.0 to 245.8/net with an average of 80.9.  Gill netted Black Bullhead were 5.6 to 15.0 inches long with an average of 9.7.  Approximately 26% of the gill net catch was 10 inches or longer and these should appeal to bullhead anglers.  In 2017, trap nets sampled low numbers (20) of Black Bullhead (2.2/net).     <br> \n <br> \nAdditional species sampled in the standard gear included Golden Shiner, Green Sunfish, Hybrid Sunfish, Pumpkinseed Sunfish, and White Sucker. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Clear is a moderate sized lake (529 acres) located near the City of Watkins in Meeker County. A medium sized county owned access, with a single cement boat ramp, is present on the south shore. A medium sized state owned access, with a cement boat ramp, is present at the north end of the lake. A fishing pier is present at the Clear Lake County Park. Clear has 6 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 18 feet. The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MNDNR) has divided Minnesota's lakes into 44 different classes based on physical and chemical characteristics. Clear is a class 38 lake and other similar lakes in the Hutchinson Fisheries Management Area are Ripley in Meeker County and Sleepy Eye in Brown County. Curlyleaf pondweed, a submerged aquatic plant, can be abundant in May and June at Clear Lake. <br> \n <br> \nClear Lake rarely suffers from partial winterkills, but fish populations can fluctuate depending on the severity of the latest event. The last moderate partial winterkill at Clear Lake was in 2001. Species that are more intolerant of low winter oxygen levels include bluegill and largemouth bass and these species may experience greater mortality during harsh winters. Walleye were sampled in low numbers in 2021, but average size was impressive with fish averaging 21 inches in length. The longest walleye sampled was 26 inches. Walleye stocking switched to fry in 2021, with hopes of producing larger year classes - which lead to better fishing. Fair numbers of northern pike were gill netted this year with fish averaging an outstanding 25 inches in length. Clear is also known to produce some truly large pike and this was again the case in 2021, with the maximum length sampled being 35 inches. Winter darkhouse spearers often find clear enough water at this lake, but not always. Trolling crankbaits during the open water season should take both pike and an occasional walleye. Good numbers of crappie are typically sampled at Clear Lake and this remained true in 2021. Crappie in the 8 to 9 inch length range were plentiful, with the longest fish captured being 11 inches. A small minnow under a bobber off the deep weed edge should catch some crappie in mid-summer. Winter ice anglers often target crappie at this lake. Although gill nets are not typically used to evaluate bluegill populations, the species was found to be present in good numbers this summer. Decent numbers of 6 and 7 inch sunfish should provide anglers a meal, for those interested in a good old-fashioned fish fry. Try drifting with a teardrop jig and a waxworm, just off the bottom on the deep weed edge, for larger sunfish in mid-summer.  <br> \n <br> \nOther species that anglers may encounter include black bullhead, golden shiner, hybrid crappie, hybrid sunfish, largemouth bass, pumpkinseed, white crappie, white sucker, and yellow perch.  <br> \n <br> \nPeople can have significant impacts on lakes and the fish populations they support. Overharvest, lakeshore development, removal of shoreline vegetation, and introductions of invasive species can all adversely affect fish populations. Aquatic invasive species (AIS) are typically moved from infested to non-infested waters by anglers, boaters and lakeshore owners, and can adversely impact lakes and fish populations. Clear Lake has the AIS Eurasian watermilfoil in it. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants and animals from their watercraft and drain all lake water from their boat and bait buckets before leaving the lake. If you suspect an infestation of an invasive species in this lake, save a specimen and report it to a local DNR office. Additional information on all of these topics can be found on the DNR website (www.dnr.state.mn.us) or by contacting the Hutchinson Area Fisheries office.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Clear is a medium sized lake (529 acres) located near the City of Watkins in Meeker County. Clear has six miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 18 feet. A county owned public access, with a cement boat ramp, and a moderate amount of parking is present on the south shore. A state owned public access, with a cement boat ramp, is present on the lake's northern shore. A fishing pier is also available at the Clear Lake County Park on the south side of the lake. <br> \n <br> \nSpring trap netting, targeting Bluegill and Black Crappie, was completed at Clear Lake on May 17, 2021. Data was collected for size structure and age/growth analysis. In addition to Bluegill and Black Crappie, Pumpkinseed Sunfish and Hybrid Sunfish were also collected and measured during this assessment. Spring panfish trap netting catches should not be compared to summer trap net catches because summer trap net catches sometimes do a poor job of sampling larger Bluegill. <br> \n <br> \nHigh numbers of Bluegill were collected in 2021 and fish were 3 to 8 inches long, averaging 6 inches. Approximately 26% of the sample was 7 inches or longer, indicating that fair numbers of keeper-sized fish were present. Bluegill were age-2 to age-7 with six year classes present. Age-3 fish thru age-6 fish were well represented, likely indicating consistent recruitment most years. Growth was moderate to fast when compared to some other lakes in the Hutchinson Fisheries Management Area. Bluegill anglers can find the sunnies scattered throughout Clear's submergent vegetation beds. Bigger Bluegill are often found off the deep weed edge. Trying dragging a waxworm under a sinker in 8 to 10 feet of water in mid-summer if you cannot find the big sunfish up shallow. <br> \n <br> \nModerate numbers of Black Crappie were collected, and average length was almost 9 inches. The longest crappie collected was slightly over 10 inches in length. Black Crappie were age-3 to age-11 with nine year classes present. Crappie recruitment appeared to be somewhat consistent at Clear Lake. Crappie can be found off the deep weed edges in the summer using a small minnow under a bobber. Winter fishing pressure can be substantial at Clear Lake and crappie are often found on the deeper flats.  <br> \n <br> \nPeople can have significant impacts on lakes and the fish populations they support. Over harvest, lakeshore development, removal of shoreline vegetation, and introductions of invasive species can all adversely affect fish populations. Aquatic invasive species (AIS) are typically moved from infested to non-infested waters by anglers, boaters and lakeshore owners, and can adversely impact lakes and fish populations. Clear Lake has the AIS - Eurasian watermilfoil. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants and animals from their watercraft and drain all lake water from their boat and bait buckets before leaving the lake. If you suspect an infestation of an invasive species in this lake, save a specimen and report it to a local DNR office.  Additional information on all of these topics can be found on the DNR website (www.dnr.state.mn.us) or by contacting the Hutchinson Area Fisheries office.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Clear Lake, Meeker County, is a 497 acre lake with a maximum depth of 18 feet.  Alake survey conducted in 1997 sampled 12 species of fish.  Clear Lake may bedescribed as a hard-water lake of moderate fertility and impacted water quality. Water clarity as measured by a secchi disk depth ranges from 2 to 3 feet in midsummer.  Adequate dissolved oxygen was sampled to a depth of 16 feet. It has anaverage diversity of aquatic plants compared with other lakes in the Hutchinsonmanagement area, growing in sparse beds around the lake (1993 survey).Clear Lake is managed primarily as a bass/bluegill and walleye fishery.  In thepast, it has experienced low winter oxygen levels and periodic partial winterkills. Clear Lake has been aerated in the past.  Samples of the fish population were takenin mid summer using gillnets and trapnets.  Although game fish catches weregenerally higther than expected for this type of lake, panfish tended to be small.Panfish were abundant in Clear Lake in both gillnets and trapnets.  Catch rates ofboth black crappies and bluegills were substantially above expectations for thistype of lake.  Crappies ranged in size from 5.5 to 12 inches, with an averagelength of about 6.5 inches.  The portion of the stock that was 8 inches or longerwas 8.3%, with 0.3% longer than 10 inches.  Bluegills ranged from 3 to 9 inches,with an average length of about 5 inches.  Adult bluegill at least 6 inches longmade up 9.4% of the sample, while 2.8% were at least 8 inches long.Gillnets sampled 266 black bullheads, for a catch rate of 44.3 per lift, which wasabout average for lakes like Clear.  It was also the lowest catch rate since 1983. The trapnet catch rate of 14.7 per set was within the normal range.  Bullheadsranged in size from 3.5 to 15 inches, averaging 9.6 inches in length.Walleye of various life stages have been stocked into Clear Lake for many years. Fingerlings and adults were stocked in 1991 and 1992.  Fry were stocked in 1994 and1995, but the 1997 stocking was again fingerlings.  Gillnets caught 102 waqlleyes,for a catch rate of 17 per lift, which was both substantially above average and thehighest catch rate since 1988.  Trapnet catches were also above average, but withinthe normal range.  Walleyes ranged in size from 13 to 25 inches, with an averagesize of 17.3 inches.  Most walleyes (75%) were between 16 and 19 inches long. Walleyes at least 15 inches long made up 99% of adults, with 10.3% of adults 20inches or longer.Gillnets sampled 43 northern pike, for a catch rate of 7.2 per lift, above averagefor a lake of this type.  This was an increase over the 1994 catch rate (2.3 perlift) and other survey years as well.  Trapnets sampled 7 northern pike, for acatch rate of 0.8 per set, also an increase over past surveys.  Northern pikeranged in size from 19 to 30 inches long in gillnets and from 22 to 34 inches intrapnets.  Northern pike at least 21 inches long made up 92% of the catch, withfish greater that 28 inches making up 16%.Clear Lake was sampled for largemouth bass by night electrofishing.  The catch ratewas 29.8 fish per hour.  Bass ranged in size from 7.5 to 17 inches, with 40.9% ofthe catch at least 12 inches long and 13.6% at least 15 inches long.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Clear Lake is located in northern Meeker County near the town of Watkins.  This is a moderate size lake with a surface area of 497 acres.  The dishpan type basin has a maximum depth of 17 feet.  In 1993 personnel from the Hutchinson Area Fisheries Headquarters used trapnets, gillnets, seines and an electrofishing boat to sample the fish population.  Gamefish species sampled in this survey were black crappie, bluegill, largemouth bass, northern pike, pumpkinseed sunfish, walleye and yellow perch.  Other species include black bullhead, green sunfish and white sucker.     The catch rate of walleye in gillnets (3.1/net) is about average for lakes of this type.  Walleye ranged in length from 9 to 19 inches.  The average length of walleye was 12.3 inches.  With another year of growth these walleye should be a good size for anglers to harvest.     The northern pike catch rate was slightly below average.  The catch rate of 2.3/gillnet was also below the 1991 survey rate of 3.1/gillnet.  Over 90% of the northern pike sampled were between 22 to 30 inches in length.  Most (86%) of these fish were age 2, indicating that natural reproduction has improved since the drought years in the late 1980's.  This large year class should provide good fishing for northern pike in upcoming years.     Black crappie are very abundant in Clear Lake.  The trapnet catch rate of 63.2 per net was approximately six times the average.  The average size of black crappie was small at 6.6 inches, but ranged in size from 5 to 10 inches.  The small size of black crappies was due to their age and not from slow growth rates.  Eighty-three percent of the black crappies sampled were only 2 years old.  Growth rates are good in Clear Lake and this age class should be of an acceptable size to anglers in one or two years.     Yellow perch and bluegill are also present in Clear Lake and provide additional angling opportunity.  Bluegill were very abundant at 62 per trapnet.  Most bluegill were between 5 and 6.5 inches, but several were sample that were greater than 8 inches.  Yellow perch were not as abundant as in previous surveys, but the average size was better at 8.6 inches.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A population assessment was conducted at Clear Lake in Meeker County begining on 7/07/03.  Clear Lake is 497 acres with a maximum depth of 18 feet.  The lake experiences intense algal blooms during summer months and as a result water clarity is limited.  Black bullhead were the most abundant fish sampled in both gill nets and trap nets, which is typical for lakes in this part of the state.  Clear Lake is primarily managed for bluegill, largemouth bass and walleye.  The lake has an infrequent history of partial winterkills.  The latest partial kill occurred during the 2000-2001 winter.  Dead bluegill and walleye were observed on shore the following spring.  There are two public accesses on the lake.  The new one is on the south shore, in the county park, and was opened in 2003.Netting in 2003 revealed that there were excellent numbers of black crappie (69.8/net) present in Clear Lake.  This was also the case in the last two assessments (1997 & 2000).  Black crappie were 4.2-9.7 inches long, with many fish in the 7.5-8.5\" range.  Age 4 fish made up 43% of the sample and averaged 8.0\" at time of capture.  You probably wont find many big crappie at Clear.  Only 3% of the gill net sample was over 9\".  More crappie were sampled in gill nets than in trap nets, indicating that crappie spend a fair amount of time out in the main basin duing July.  There were also good numbers of northern pike sampled at Clear Lake.  The 2003 catch rate (9.2/net) was just below the lakes all time high catch rate (9.3/net) in 1983.  Gill netted pike were 14.7-34.0\" long averaging 21.5\".  The longest pike sampled came from a trap net and was 37\".  In fact, trap nets sampled six pike that were over 30\", which is a bit unusual.  Don't be afraid to cast up shallow for the big gators.  Only one largemouth bass (0.7/hour) was sampled during spring night-time electrofishing, indicating that the population is probably not large.  That partial winterkill may have reduced bass numbers significantly and recovery may take some time.  Good numbers of bass have not been sampled since 1997 (30.0/hour).  A total of 8 walleye were gill netted (0.9/net) in 2003, probably indicating a small population.  Walleye were either 2 or 3 years old.  The three year olds (2) averaged 15.9\" at time of capture, inidcating that some walleye survived the partial kill.  The age 2 fish (6) averaged 8.6\" and were most likely a result of the 2001 stocking.  Walleye fingerlings are currently stocked every-other-year at a rate of 1.5 pounds/littoral acre.  Fall electrofishing for young-of-the-year walleye has failed to document natural reproduction of walleye at Clear Lake, indicating that the population is probably dependent upon stocking.  Trap nets sampled low numbers (10.7/net) of bluegill, but the size of those fish was nice, averaging 6.9\".  Bluegill were 3.1-8.8\" long, with 67% of the sample being 7\" or longer.  The present fish population looks fair to good for most species.</p>",

Northern pike.  Yellow perch.  Largemouth bass.  Bluegill.  Pumpkinseed.  Black crappie.  White crappie. <br> \n <br> \nNUMBER OF FISH/NET: <br> \nDogfish (2.0/trapnet).  Common sucker (0.2/gillnet).  Brown bullhead (8.4/trapnet).  Northern pike (3.6/gillnet).  Yellow perch (28.7/gillnet).  Bluegill (2.4/trapnet).  Pumpkinseed (0.7/trapnet).  Black crappie (23.3/trapnet).  White crappie (0.2/trapnet).  Suckers, sunfish and white crappies were caught in less than normal quantities.  Dogfish, perch and black crappies were taken in more than normal quantities.  Catch of all other species was approximately normal. <br> \n <br> \nFISH SIZES (AVERAGE LENGTH IN INCHES): <br> \nDogfish - 25.7.  Common sucker - 16.1.  Brown bullhead - 12.7.

                "narrative": "<p>A resurvey was conducted at Clear Lake in 2007.  Clear has a history of taking partial winterkills, with the latest event occurring during the 2000-2001 winter.  Clear is managed for northern pike, black crappie, and walleye.  \n\nThe lakes watershed was dominated by row-crop agriculture and much of the shoreline was developed with residential homes.  A total of 21 aquatic plants were sampled in late July and all were considered rare, except cattail and filamentous algae, which were ranked as common.  Curly-leaf pondweed was abundant around much of the lake in the spring.  Silt was the only substrate classified as abundant, while detritus and sand were considered common.  Gravel and rubble were both classified as rare shoalwater substrates.  Shoreland property owners are encouraged to protect emergent aquatic plants.  Emergents provide food and cover for many fish and wildlife species, improve water clarity, reduce erosion, and improve aesthetics.\n\nA total of 20 walleye were gill netted for a catch rate of 2.2/net, which indicated that numbers were fair to low for this type of lake.  The catch rate in 2003 was 0.9/net.  In 2007, gill netted walleye were 11.1-22.1 inches long averaging 18.9 inches.  Walleye were 1-6 years old with 6 year-classes present.  The most recent stocking regime (3lb/littoral acre every-other-year; initiated in 2005) produced only 1 fish in the 2007 gill netting.  A total of 8 fish corresponded with the 2003 stocking regime (1.5lb/littoral acre).  Growth was fast.    \n\nA total of 23 northern pike were gill netted for a catch rate of 2.6/net, which indicated that fair numbers were present.  The northern pike gill net catch rate has not been this low since the 1993 assessment.  The catch rate in 2003 was 9.2/net.  In 2007, gill netted northern pike were 22.1-32.7 inches long averaging 25.8 inches.  Trap nets sampled northern pike up to 36.5 inches in length.  Northern pike were 2-8 years old with 6 year-classes present and growth was good.  This years decrease in northern pike may allow for better survival of stocked walleye fingerlings.\n \nA total of 14 yellow perch were gill netted for a catch rate of 1.6/net, which indicated that numbers were low.  The 2003 catch rate was similar at 2.4/net.  In 2007, gill netted yellow perch were 5.7-7.8 inches long.  Yellow perch were 2-5 years with 4 year-classes present.  \n\nA total of 109 black crappie were trap netted for a catch rate of 12.1/net, which indicated that moderate numbers were present.  The 2003 catch rate was similar at 9.8/net.  In 2007, trap netted black crappie were 5.4-9.7 inches long averaging 7.1 inches.  Gill nets sampled 598 black crappie for a catch rate of 66.4/net, which indicated that numbers were high.  Black crappie were 2-6 years old with 5 year-classes present.  Age analysis indicated that the 2005 year-class was quite strong, accounting for 94% of the gill net catch.  Growth was slow.  Assessments in 2003, 2000, and 1997 also showed few fish over 8 inches and slow growth, indicating a stunted population.\n\nA total of 1,019 bluegill were trap netted for a catch rate of 113.2/net, which indicated that numbers were high.  In 2003, the catch rate was much lower at 10.7/net.  In 2007, trap netted bluegill were 3.4-9.1 inches long averaging 4.9 inches.  Approximately 5% of the trap net catch was 7\" or longer.  Bluegill were 2-7 years old with 6 year-classes present.  Age 2 fish accounted for 80% of the trap net catch.  \n\nA total of 4 white crappie were trap netted for a catch rate of 0.4/net, which indicated that low numbers were present.  Trap netted white crappie were 14.3-15.5 inches long averaging 14.8 inches.  The trap netted fish were 6-7 years old with 2 year-classes present.  Growth was good.\n\nA total of 552 black bullhead were trap netted for a catch rate of 61.3/net, which indicated that high numbers were present.  The catch rate was similar in 2003 at 64.8/net.  Trap netted black bullhead were 6.9-8.9 inches long.\n\nA total of 4 largemouth bass were collected during spring night-time electrofishing for a catch rate of 2.7/hour.  Only 1 largemouth bass was sampled in similar assessments that were conducted in 2003 and 2005.  In 2007, largemouth bass were 6.9-16.1 inches long.  Largemouth bass were 2-5 years old with 2 year-classes present.  Age 2 fish accounted for 75% of the electrofishing sample.  \n\nShoreline seining sampled young-of-the-year; black bullhead (3), black crappie (2), bluegill (256), hybrid sunfish (43), largemouth bass (1), pumpkinseed sunfish (88) and yellow perch (4).  Common shiner, golden shiner, and fathead minnow were also collected.\n</p>",

In 1989, northern pike and walleye gillnet catch rates have decreased, when compared to the 1988 netting, but are at 8.17/trapnet and 2.50/trapnet, respectively.  Bluegill and black crappie populations appear to be decreasing, when compared to the 1988 survey.  This may be due to low water conditions, causing loss of habitat for natural reproduction.  The high density of bullheads may also be contributing to low panfish numbers by degrading water quality and spawning habitat.  The growth rates of the northern pike, walleye, and bluegill are good.  Fifty-one flathead catfish were stocked in May of 1989 to see if they could reduce black bullhead abundance, through predation.  Clear Lake is scheduled for annual assessment netting to evaluate effects of these catfish upon fish community structure.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A population assessment was conducted at Clear in 2013 to monitor the lake's fish population.  The Lake Management Plan listed Northern Pike, Black Crappie, and Walleye as primary management species, while Bluegill were listed as a secondary species.  The last substantial winterkill occurred in 2001.  Fish populations can fluctuate greatly depending on the severity of a winterkill.  The secchi disk reading was 2.8 feet on July 8th, 2013 due to an intense algal bloom.   Eurasian watermilfoil was discovered in Clear Lake in 2013.  A fishing pier is available for anglers at the County Park, on the south side of the lake.  Curlyleaf pondweed can be abundant during May and June.   <br> \n <br> \nA total of 48 Walleye were gill netted for a catch rate of 5.3/net, which was above the normal range for this type of lake.  The catch rate in 2007 was 2.2/net.  The latest three catch rates indicated a possible increasing trend in Walleye abundance.  Catch rates from 1951 to 2013 (n=16) were variable, ranging from 0.0 to 17.0/net with an average of 5.9.  In 2013, gill netted Walleye were 6.9 to 26.2 inches long with an average of 11.2.  Approximately 58% of the gill net sample was under 9 inches in length.  The most recent stocking regime (3 pounds of fingerlings/littoral acre every-other-year) was initiated in 2005.  The normal fingerling stocking rate is 2 pounds/littoral (acreage that is 15 foot deep or less) acre every other year.  Catch rates during this time period (2007 and 2013) ranged from 2.2 to 5.3/net with an average of 3.8.  In 2013, Walleye were age-2 to age-12 with 5 year-classes present.  Growth was moderate for larger fish.  Only 1 gill netted fish corresponded with a year when Walleye were not stocked.  This likely indicated that recruitment, from natural reproduction, was not significant at Clear Lake.  Skip years in the stocking regime failed to produce a single strong year-class in the 2003, 2007, and 2013 assessments.      <br> \n <br> \nA total of 23 Northern Pike were gill netted for a catch rate of 2.7/net, which was within the normal range for a lake of this type.  The 2007 catch rate was also 2.7/net.  Catch rates from 1951 to 2013 (n=16) ranged from 0.4 to 9.3/net with an average of 4.5.  In 2013, gill netted Northern Pike were 18.5 to 32.1 inches long with an average of 24.1.  Approximately 26% of the gill net sample was 29 inches or longer, indicating that quality sized fish were present.  Gill netted Northern Pike were age-2 to age-13 with 6 year-classes present.   <br> \n <br> \nA total of 501 Yellow Perch were gill netted for a catch rate of 55.7/net, which was above the normal range for a lake of this type and the highest ever recorded at Clear Lake.  The 2007 catch rate was much lower at 1.6/net.  Catch rates from 1951 to 2013 (n=16) were variable, ranging from 0.0 to 55.7 with an average of 9.9.  In 2013, gill netted Yellow Perch were 5.4-8.9 inches long with an average of 6.7.  Although most of the fish were too small to interest anglers, this abundance of Yellow Perch could be the key to producing stronger walleye year-classes at Clear.    <br> \n <br> \nA total of 119 Black Crappie were trap netted for a catch rate of 13.2/net, which was within the normal range for this type of lake.  The 2007 catch rate was similar at 12.1/net.  The last three catch rates indicated a somewhat stable trend.  Catch rates from 1951 to 2013 (n=15) were variable, ranging from 0.5 to 70.7/net with an average of 24.1.  In 2013, trap netted Black Crappie were 5.9 to 10.4 inches long with an average of 7.95.  Gill nets sampled 413 Black Crappie for a catch rate of 45.9/net, which was well above the normal range.  The 2007 gill net catch was 66.4/net.  Catch rates from 1974 to 2013 (n=15) were variable, ranging from 1.8 to 182.3/net with an average of 55.5.  The most recent five gill net catch rates (1997 to 2013) showed a possible decreasing trend in abundance since the record high catch in 1997 (182.3/net).  Approximately 37% of the gill net sample was 8 inches or longer, while 6% were 9 inches or longer.       <br> \n <br> \nA total of 521 Bluegill were trap netted for a catch rate of 57.9/net, which was above the normal range for a lake of this type.  In 2007, the catch rate was 113.2/net.  Catch rates from 1951 to 2013 were variable ranging from 2.3 to 205.6/net with an average of 62.7.  In 2013, trap netted Bluegill were 3.2 to 8.7 inches long with an impressive average of 7.1.  Approximately 65% of the trap net sample was 7 inches or longer, indicating a highly desirable population.    <br> \n  <br> \nA total of 57 Black Bullhead were trap netted for a catch rate of 6.3/net, which was within the normal range for a lake of this type.  The 2007 catch rate was 61.3/net.  Catch rates from 1974 to 2013 ranged from 0.0 to 205.7/net with an average of 70.9.  In 2013, trap netted Black Bullhead were 9.4 to 11.9 inches long with an average of 10.7.  Gill nets sampled 375 Black Bullhead for a catch rate of 41.7/net, which was within the normal range.  Catch rates from 1974 to 2013 were highly variable, ranging from 0.0 to 245.8/net with an average of 81.8.   <br> \n <br> \nA total of 30 Largemouth Bass were collected during spring night-time electrofishing for a catch rate of 20.0/hour of electrofishing on-time.  The 2007 catch rate was 2.7/hour.  Catch rates from 1991 to 2013 (n=8) ranged from 0.0 to 30.0/hour with an average of 10.8.  In 2013, Largemouth Bass were 6.0 to 17.4 inches long with an average of 9.3.  Largemouth Bass were age-1 to age-8 with 5 year-classes present.  Age-2 fish accounted for 80% of the electrofishing sample.     <br> \n</p>",

Bluegill and black crappie trapnet catch rates average 39.67 and 30.83 fish per lift, respectively, within the normal ranges for this type of lake.  Bluegill, 7 inches and longer comprised 51% of the total bluegill catch (excluding seine catches).  In Clear Lake, bluegills reached 7 inches by age 5.  Walleye gillnet catch rate (1.7/lift) was within the normal range for this lake type.  Growth rates for walleye were good.  Length at age 4 was 16.0 inches and at age 5 was 19 inches.  The walleye population in Clear Lake is maintained by stocking.  Gillnet catch rate for northern pike was 4.22 fish per lift.  Flathead catfish and channel catfish have previously been stocked in Clear Lake; one of each species was captured in survey netting.\n</p>",

Species composition of panfish seems to be shifting from bluegills (3.2/trapnet) to black crappies (70.7/trapnet - mostly 6.0 to 7.9 inches in length).  A partial winterkill, during winter 1978-79, may have contributed to the shift.  All gamefish appeared to have naturally reproduced during 1980, except for walleye.  No roughfish (carp or black bullhead) were captured during the netting period.</p>",

All age classes appear to be represented and fishing is reported excellent.  Bluegills are abundant in netting catches (205.7/trapnet), despite selective chemical treatment for sunfish reduction in 1976 and extensive trapnetting removal operations in spring 1977 (33,000 lbs.).  The majority of bluegills range from 5.0 to 6.0 inches in length and belong to year classes 3 and 4.  The size caught by anglers is small.  Some large (35 inch maximum length) northern pike are present, though no young of the year were captured.  A few bullheads and catfish were reported taken in spring trapnets set for sunfish removal, but none were sampled in this August assessment.  Largemouth bass of all size classes were taken in seine hauls. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",
