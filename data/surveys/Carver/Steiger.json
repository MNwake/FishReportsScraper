Sampled Northern Pike averaged 24.3 inches in length and 3.3 pounds in weight. Largemouth Bass are also above average in size, however, significant numbers of juvenile fish from new year classes of production have brought that average size down from previous assessments. Walleye are still present in the lake, but in relatively low numbers of above average sized fish. No Muskellunge were captured during this survey. Bluegill, while down in abundance from recent years, exhibited an improved size structure at the time of this survey. Approximately 1/4 of all Bluegills sampled were 7.0 inches or longer. Black Crappie were present in significantly increased numbers since the 1993 assessment, with some nice sized individuals present in the sample up to 11.2 inches in length. Yellow Perch were rare in the 1998 survey, but growth rates of endemic species in the population remain good.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Steiger Lake is a class 24 lake of 158 acres located in Carver County near the town of Victoria.  It is a unique resource for the Twin Cities Metro Area; it is completely surrounded by Carver Park Reserve, precluding any shoreline development.  The lake has had special regulations in place requiring the release of all northern pike and largemouth bass since 1988.  Boats are limited to 10 mph at all times, and there is a fishing pier to allow for shore angling access.  Steiger Lake is productive, as evidenced by a transparency of only 3.2 feet.  Waters deeper than 13 feet did not have sufficient oxygen to support fish at the time of the survey.Northern pike averaged 10.8 per gill net in the 2003 survey.  Previous surveys have also typically had greater than 10 pike per net.  Mean length was 23.5 inches, and 15 of pike sampled exceeded 28 inches.  The largest measured 31.2 inches.  This and previous surveys, including ice-out trap netting, have shown that the special regulation protecting northern pike have produced a moderate density population of good sized fish, but has not created a trophy fishery.  Biological limits, such as forage availability, are likely preventing fish from reaching trophy size.  Hooking mortality of released fish may also be a factor.Largemouth bass electrofishing captured 75.3 fish per hour.  This is consistent with a trend toward increasing abundance seen in previous surveys since special regulations were put in place.  The goal of the largemouth bass special regulation was to create a fishery where 20% of the population exceeds 16 inches.  It is interesting that the percentage of fish over 16 inches has steadily declined over the length of the regulation, although the 2003 value of 25% still exceeds the goal.  When considered in combination with the increased abundance shown by catch per unit effort data, it appears that there has been an increase in largemouth bass less than 16 inches while the number of larger fish has remained relatively constant.  The current population is more balanced than those of the early 1990's, with a mix of several age classes.  This is a more healthy state for the population, and provides a good mix of high catch rates and decent average size for anglers.  As with northern pike, this suggests that there are biological barriers that limit the trophy potential of the lake.Black crappie averaged 20.8 per gill net in 2003, which exceeds the range typically seen in this type of lake.  Previous surveys have found similar abundances.  Mean length was 6.1 inches, and only 7% of the sample exceeded 8 inches.  Strong year classes from 1999 and 2001 comprised almost 80% of the sample.  The 1999 year class averaged 7.2 inches, while 2001 averaged 4.8 inches.  As these year classes mature, anglers will have crappie of a more acceptable size to target.Bluegill catch has varied greatly over time in Steiger Lake, from a high of 236.1 in 1993 to a low of 25.9 in the current survey.  Mean length was 5.4 inches, and only 5 percent of the sample exceeded 7 inches.  A majority of the sample (80%) was from the 1998 and 1999 year classes, but the slow growth exhibited by bluegill in Steiger Lake will likely prevent these fish from reaching a size desirable to anglers.Walleye have not been stocked in Steiger Lake since 1989, but this survey captured 4 individuals that all exceeded 20 inches in length.  These fish ranged in age from 7 to 19 years old.  It is unclear where these fish originated from: the older fish could be remnants from the stockings of adult fish in 1988 and 1989, but the lack of suitable spawning habitat in Steiger Lake suggests that younger fish are not the result of natural reproduction in the lake.  It is possible that these fish are migrants from Lake Minnetonka or Parley Lake that have found their way into Steiger via the Six Mile Creek watershed.  Growth of these fish is slow.Also sampled in low abundance in this survey were black bullhead, yellow bullhead, carp, white sucker, green sunfish, hybrid sunfish, pumpkinseed sunfish, yellow perch, and painted and snapping turtles.  </p>",

The entire lake lies within the boundaries of Three Rivers Park (Carver Park Reserve).  The shoreline around Steiger remains in a natural state.  A catch-and-release regulation for largemouth bass and northern pike was implemented in 1988. <br> \n <br> \nSteiger Lake contains a high abundance of northern pike.  Average length for northern pike was 23.9 inches.  Few large fish were sampled.  Only 6.8% of northern pike were longer than 30 inches.  Mean weight of Steiger Lake northern pike was 3.3 pounds.  This is above average.  Anglers should keep in mind that all northern pike must be released. <br> \n <br> \nNo largemouth bass were sampled during the summer survey.  A special assessment was conducted in spring.  This survey focused on largemouth bass specifically.   Abundance was average compared to past surveys of Steiger Lake.  Mean length of largemouth bass was 13.8 inches, 28.2% of sampled fish were 16 inches or larger.   Only 5% were larger than 18 inches.  Average weight of Steiger Lake largemouth bass was 1.62 pounds.   All largemouth bass must be released.          <br> \n <br> \nOne walleye was sampled: a 22.8 inch, 4.00 pound fish.  Steiger Lake has not supported a fishable walleye population since 1988.      <br> \n <br> \nThe 2009 survey found black crappie abundance was lower than the 2003 survey, but still within the average range of a class 24 lake. Black crappie averaged 6.8 inches with a mean weight of 0.14 pounds.  Only 2.3% of sampled fish were larger than 9 inches.      <br> \nBluegill abundance was slightly higher than the last survey, conducted in 2003.  Bluegill averaged 5.4 inches and 0.16 pounds.  Nearly 25% of sampled bluegill were greater than 6 inches. <br> \n <br> \nBoth pumpkinseed and hybrid sunfish are present in low numbers.   <br> \n <br> \nCommon carp numbers remain average.  Black bullhead, bowfin (dogfish) and yellow bullhead were also sampled in the 2009 survey.   <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Steiger Lake is a 166-acre lake with a maximum depth of 37 feet. Steiger is located north of the City of Victoria, in northeastern Carver County. Three Rivers Park District owns and maintains a public access ramp (subject to Three Rivers Park District rules and hours) located off of County Road 5 on the southeast shore of the lake. Steiger is primarily managed for Northern Pike and Largemouth Bass, but includes catchable populations of Bluegill and Black Crappie. A special catch-and-release regulation for Northern Pike and Largemouth Bass was implemented in 1988 and remains in place. <br> \n <br> \nA Standard Survey (gill nets, trap nets, and electrofishing) was conducted on Steiger Lake during the week of 7/29/2019 to assess the fishery. Steiger Lake had poor water clarity, measured at 3 feet during the time of this survey. Dissolved oxygen was zero parts per million (ppm) below 13 feet during the survey period. Eurasian Watermilfoil was found in Steiger Lake in 2002 and remains present. <br> \n <br> \nHigh numbers of Northern Pike were sampled with gill nets (9.7/net) -- -- above the expected cate rate of similar lakes in the area. There were 58 Northern Pike sampled in gill nets, with an average size of 26.2 inches and the largest measured at 34.0 inches. Northern Pike are maintaining a balanced population (an intermediate between high numbers of small fish and few numbers of large fish).  Growth rates were fast compared to the statewide average, with an average length of 20.3 by age 3 and 25.4 inches by age 5. Northern Pike in Steiger Lake appear to benefit from the catch-and-release regulation with consistently high numbers and sizes, providing excellent angling opportunity. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass were sampled during spring 2019 with nighttime boat electrofishing. Catch rates were moderate, with 45.7 fish/hour. Fifty-four total bass were sampled, with an average length of 14.1 inches and the largest measured at 19.3 inches. Despite a lack of the largest individuals (20\"+), Steiger Lake supports an excellent bass fishery with over 54% of the total catch greater than 15 inches. Similar to Northern Pike, the Largemouth Bass in Steiger Lake appear to benefit from the catch-and-release regulation with an abundance of desirable sized fish. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill were sampled with trap nets (36.0/net) at moderately high catch rates compared to similar lakes in the area. There were 288 Bluegill sampled in trap nets during the 2019 survey, with an average length of 5.9 inches and the largest measured at 7.7 inches. Despite a lack of the largest individuals (8\"+), over 25% of fish sampled were greater than 7 inches and should provide plenty of angling opportunity. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie were sampled with gill nets (19.8/net) and trap nets (3.3/net), near the expected catch rate of similar lakes in the area. Black Crappie in Steiger Lake appear to prefer offshore summer habitat based on the long-term differences between high gill net (offshore) and low trap net (nearshore) catches. There were 144 Black Crappie sampled during the 2019 survey, with an average length of 6.7 inches and the largest measured at 13.4 inches. Although the majority of Black Crappie sampled were less than 8 inches (83%), there were fish present greater than 10 inches (1%), and even 12 inches (1%) in Steiger Lake. <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species sampled in low abundances were Brown Bullhead, Common Carp, Golden Shiner, Pumpkinseed, White Sucker, Yellow Bullhead, and Yellow Perch. <br> \n</p>",

Only 16 walleye were captured in this assessment, but 13 of those fish were 20.0 inches of larger. Trapnet walleye averaged 24.7 inches and 5.2 pounds, while gillnet sampled walleye averaged only 20.8 inches and 3.4 pounds. No Muskellunge were captured during the summer assessment. Bluegill were captured in very high abundance, but the average size was only 5.8 inches in length. Growth rate for bluegill was found to be slow for sampled fish. Black crappie were sampled in record low numbers. Yellow perch were abundant in the gillnet catch and averaged 6.5 inches in length. All three species of bullhead are present in the lake with yellow bullhead being the most abundant.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Steiger Lake is a 158-acre Class 24 lake with a maximum depth of 37 feet.  The entire lake lies within the boundaries of Three Rivers Park (Carver Park Reserve).  Per park district rules, a fee permit is required to park vehicle-boat trailer combinations within the park; in addition, Steiger has a 15-mph speed limit lake surface-use restriction. <br> \n <br> \nA catch-and-release regulation for Largemouth Bass and Northern Pike has been in place since 1988.  In 2014, a population assessment and fall special assessment were conducted to determine composition and abundance of fish present.   <br> \n <br> \nSteiger Lake contained a high abundance of Northern Pike (9.0 per gill net, above the 75th percentile), and the fish displayed a good size structure.  Average size of Northern Pike was 25.6 inches and 3.89 pounds.  Ninety percent of the fish exceeded 21 inches and 26% exceeded 28 inches, with 5 fish over 30 inches.  Northern Pike grew fast in Steiger Lake; they reach an average length of 23.1 inches by age 3, and 26.1 inches by age 5.   <br> \n <br> \nNo Largemouth Bass were sampled during the summer survey; however, an electrofishing assessment to specifically target the species was conducted in fall 2014.  The average size of Largemouth Bass in 2014 was 14.0 inches and 1.86 pounds.  Forty-one percent of sampled fish exceeded 16 inches, and 10% exceeded 18 inches.  The largest fish was 18.7 inches.  Largemouth Bass grew fast in Steiger; they reach an average length of 11.1 inches by age 3 and 16.9 inches by age 5. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill were highly abundant in Steiger Lake; 2014's catch of 85 fish per trap net exceeds the 75th percentile for this type of lake.  The fish averaged 6.0 inches and 0.17 pounds.  Fifty-four percent of the sampled fish were longer than 6 inches, and 20% were longer than 7 inches.  The largest fish measured 8.0 inches.  Bluegill grew fast in Steiger Lake; they reach an average length of 5.3 inches by age 3 and 7.3 inches by age 5.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie were present at an average level; 2014's gill net catch of 6.2 fish per net was just below the Lake Class median.  Sampled fish were not large; only one exceeded 8 inches.  The average size of Black Crappie in Steiger was 6.5 inches and 0.13 pounds.  Black Crappie grew more slowly than average for this Lake Class, attaining an average length of 6.0 inches by age 3 and 7.6 inches by age 5.   <br> \n <br> \nYellow Bullhead were sampled in the trap nets at a rate just above the median for this type of lake (2.56 fish per trap net).  The average size of Bullhead was 10.9 inches and 0.71 pounds; the largest measured 13.3 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled in low abundance during the 2014 assessment include Bowfin, Black Bullhead, Brown Bullhead, Common Carp, Golden Shiner, Hybrid Sunfish, and Pumpkinseed. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",
