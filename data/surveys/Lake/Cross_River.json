A total of 84 Black Crappie were sampled with the trap nets and these fish had an average length of 11.6 inches with 63% of the catch over 12 inches.  Ten different year classes were identified and growth of fish was good. Reproduction and recruitment of Black Crappie appeared to be fairly consistent.  These results indicate Cross River Lake currently supports a fishable Black Crappie population with decent growth and fairly consistent recruitment which is unique for the Finland area. <br> \n <br> \nTwo Walleye were sampled during the netting and were 14.5 inches and 17.7 inches long.  A total of 22 Northern Pike were caught during the survey and averaged 18 inches in length with one fish being over 32 inches.  Yellow Perch, White Sucker, and Tadpole Madtom were also sampled with the survey gear.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Cross River Lake is in eastern Lake County approximately ten miles north of Schroeder. The lake supports fisheries for Black Crappie, Northern Pike, and Walleye. The public access is a short carry-in trail off US Forest Service Road 1226. The Cross River flows through the lake and connects it to other nearby waterbodies with game fish populations. The lake itself is small and shallow, covering just 78 acres and having a maximum depth of about seven feet. The bottom substrate is primarily muck and various species of emergent vegetation are common around the perimeter of the lake.  <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie numbers have slowly increased in Cross River Lake since first being sampled in 1995. Although recruitment had been sporadic in the past, the results of the 2023 survey indicate year classes have been produced more consistently in recent years. This may help to explain the record high Black Crappie catch of 5.1 fish per trap net. Lengths ranged from 4.5 to 13.5\" long with 26% longer than 10\".  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike provide an additional opportunity for anglers. Most pike are of modest size, but a few fish do grow larger. Length of the 2023 catch averaged 20.3\" with one fish over 40\" sampled. Natural reproduction has consistently produced year classes of varying size in recent years, which indicates anglers should continue to have opportunities to catch pike into the foreseeable future. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye are also a part of the fish community that can be targeted by anglers. The lake does not have much spawning habitat, which limits the amount of natural reproduction and recruitment to the fishery. Still, enough spawning does occur in the lake and adjoining rivers to produce sporadic year classes frequently enough to sustain the population in the lake.      <br> \n <br> \nWhite Sucker and Yellow Perch are important forage species but will be of little interest to anglers. There are opportunities to harvest suckers during their spring spawning run in the Cross River where it crosses Forest Service Road 1226 just upstream from the lake.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Cross River Lake is 78 acres with a maximum depth listed of 7 feet; the Secchi disk was 4.5 feet in brown bog-stained water.  The maximum depth was 8.5 feet in this assessment; the lake level was nearly two feet higher than in previous investigations.  There was fresh beaver activity on the south end of the lake and a beaver dam on the outlet influencing the lake level.  The carry-in access trail, off of U.S. Forest Service Road #1226, parallels the inlet for about 200 feet before meeting the inlet upstream of the lake; the trail is narrow and suitable for canoes or very small boats. <br> \n <br> \nA small number of walleye were collected in 2013, the average weight of the walleye sampled was 2.1 pounds; the largest walleye was 20.5 inches (3.4 pounds).  Ageing the small sample of walleye indicates sporadic walleye reproduction or poor survival.  Ageing from previous investigations also has shown inconsistent walleye reproduction with a strong year-class rarely occurring.  Much of the lake shoreline substrate is muck and detritus and does not provide suitable walleye spawning habitat. <br> \n   <br> \nBlack crappies continue to maintain a fishable population in Cross River Lake through natural reproduction, since they were first sampled in the 1995 investigation.  The 2013 population assessment found black crappie at above average numbers, when compared to lakes with similar characteristics.  The average length of the black crappie sampled was 9.3 inches, the largest was 12.8 inches.  The movement of black crappie in the Cross River system has extended upstream from Cross River Lake through South Wigwam Lake and into Finger Lake; first found in South Wigwam Lake in 2009 and Finger Lake in 2011. <br> \n <br> \nThe northern pike numbers in Cross River Lake were about average for this type of lake.  The average weight of the northern pike was 1.8 pounds in 2013; the largest was about 27 inches (4 pounds).  Northern pike numbers have remained fairly constant in Cross River Lake; the average weight has typically been less than 2 pounds.   Northern pike reproduction appears to be sufficient to maintain a fishable population in this lightly fished lake.   <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch were found in average numbers in 2013 and numbers similar to previous investigations on Cross River Lake.  The average weight of the catch in 2013 was less than 0.2 pound, within the range seen in previous yellow perch samples.  About 28% of total yellow perch catch was greater than 8 inches the largest 9.4 inches.     <br> \n <br> \nThe white sucker catch in 2013 was below the range seen in previous investigations on Cross River Lake.  Historically the white sucker numbers have been above average for this type of lake, with fish averaging about 2 pounds.  The culvert crossing U.S. Forest Service Road #1226 provides an opportunity for spring harvest of white suckers in the inlet (Cross River) to Cross River Lake during the spawning run, during the open season. <br> \n</p>",

Walleye averaged about 14.3 inches (1.0 lb/fish) and ranged from 10.4-17.9 inches.Northern pike were collected in average numbers compared to other lakes in this class and included a few quality size fish.  Northern pike averaged 19.0 inches (2.0 lb/fish) across all netting gear, which included some 3.0-5.0 lb fish and fish up to 7.2-lb.Cross River Lake maintains a small population of black crappie that includes some quality fish.  The 2005 assessment collected a number of fish over 11.0 inches and one 12.1-inch individual.</p>",

Walleye and northern pike are the primary gamefish species in the lake. Test nets in 1995 indicate the lake supports an average abundance of walleye. Average size of walleye sampled was 15 inches with nearly half of the fish in the 15 inch to 19 inch range, walleye up to 21.3 inches were sampled.     Northern pike are fairly abundant with some larger fish present. Over 70% of the northern pike sampled were less than 17 inches, however a number of fish in the 33 inch to 38 inch range (9 pounds to 14 pounds) were taken.     A small number of black crappie were sampled but at this time they do not appear to be very abundant.</p>",
