A resident claims the crappies have been larger the last couple of years and that he has never caught a northern pike over six pounds.  A dillapidated beaver dam was present 150 feet up the inlet from the lake.Present Fish Population Status:  Lake Group 29; Northern cisco are present in low numbers but are large in size.  Northern pike are average in numbers and are small in size.  Yellow  bullhead and largemouth bass exhibited populations that are high in number and small in size.  Those species showing average numbers and size were bowfin, black bullhead, rock bass, pumpkin seed and bluegill.  Age growth analysis revealed black crappies to be very slow growing, bluegills moderately slow, northern pike average and largemouth bass average.</p>",
