It is currently managed for brook trout, with a long range goal of maintaining a population with a minimum gill net catch of 9.0 fish/set, with 40% of stock-sized fish (fish 8 inches or larger) at least 12 inches long.  This was the second of two assessments scheduled in the 2006 lake management plan to evaluate stocking and determine whether the size goal was realistic.   The current management plan will be reviewed and revised in January 2014. <br> \n <br> \nGoals for brook trout in this lake were not met in the 2012 assessment.  The brook trout catch was the lowest seen in this lake since 1986, and only 15.4% of stock sized fish (2 of 13 collected) were 12 in or larger.  Most of the brook trout collected were one-year-old fish from the 2011 fingerling stocking.  Only one fish from the 2010 stocking was collected, and the near-complete failure of that stocking accounted for the low catch seen in 2012.   Some fish survived to three years of age, but their numbers also seemed low for a lake in this remote location.  Sample sizes were too low to allow growth to be described. <br> \n <br> \nNo white sucker or other undesirable fish species were taken in this assessment.  White sucker have been taken in low numbers in this lake in the past.  They may still be present, but if so, they are not abundant enough to have an adverse effect on brook trout growth. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Meditation Lake has been managed for stream trout since it was reclaimed for that purpose in 1973.  This was the first of two surveys scheduled in the 2014 lake management plan to determine if a Brook Trout size goal established in that plan was reasonable for this lake.  The goal established in 2014 was to maintain a population where at least 40% of Brook Trout larger than eight inches would also exceed 12 inches in length.  That plan also established a catch goal of 9.0 Brook Trout/gill net set.  Reductions in area funding since 2014 have forced changes to the stocking program in Meditation, with stocking frequency reduced from annual to alternate years beginning in 2021 under a proposed 2018 plan revision.  The catch goal would be reduced to a more realistic 6.0 fish/set, while the size goal would remain unchanged.  Evaluation of both goals will continue in a new series of surveys scheduled in the proposed plan.  <br> \n <br> \nBrook Trout were fairly abundant in 2017, but most were small.  The Brook Trout gill net catch was close to the average for fall catches in Grand Marais-area lakes (6.0 fish/set), but fell short of the goal from the 2014 management plan.  The size of fish taken in 2017 also failed to meet the goal in the 2014 plan, although it was similar to values seen in several past surveys of this lake.  Three stocked year classes contributed to the catch, which included one four-year-old fish, but no fish from the stocked 2014 year class.  Most of the fish taken were from stockings done in 2015 and 2016. <br> \n <br> \nAs has been the case in most past surveys of this lake, no undesirable fish species were found in 2017.  The lake is known to support high numbers of minnows of various types, which provide high-quality forage and promote good growth for Brook Trout. <br> \n</p>",
