                "narrative": "<p>McKusick Lake has been in the Fishing in the Neighborhood (FiN) program since 2003. The City of Stillwater owns most of the property along McKusick Rd on the east side of the lake which allows for public access to the lake. A public fishing pier was constructed in 2014. This project was a combined effort by the DNR FIN, City of Stillwater, McKusick Lake Water Association, Rotary Foundation, Stillwater Sunrise Rotary Club, and the Stillwater Noon Rotary club. Amenities at McKusick Lake are minimal, there is a walking path along the east, north and northwest sides of the lake, and a portable toilet is located at the fishing pier. The lake has shorefishing access points along the walking path on the east, north and northwest sides of the lake. There is also a place to launch a canoe or kayak from the south east end of the lake. Prior to 2014, the only fisheries management activities taken at McKusick Lake were two stocking events, one in 2003 when 226 Bluegill and 354 Black Crappie were stocked and another in 2007 when 463 Bluegill and 741 Black Crappie were stocked. In 2014, 384 Bluegill were stocked.   <br> \n <br> \nMcKusick Lake can be best described as a panfish lake. Pumpkinseed Sunfish are present in good numbers for lakes like McKusick. Other panfish species found in the lake were Green and Hybrid Sunfish and Yellow Perch, these fish were present in average numbers. Bluegill Sunfish and Black Crappie are also present but in below average numbers and size. Black Bullhead were present  in low numbers but above average size. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",
