Bluegill was the only species caught in significant numbers in the trap nets. Bluegills ranged in length from 4.7 to 7.7 inches. The median length was 6.0-6.4 inches and growth was good for all ages. Six Walleyes were caught in the trap nets. Lengths ranged from 13-28 inches indicating different age classes. No walleye stocking has been done by MN DNR, thus some natural reproduction may be occurring.</p>",

As in Watab Lake, Walleye abundance is low (0.5/gill net). Growth is about average. Smallmouth Bass were sampled as young of the year fish in shoreline seines. Largemouth Bass abundance (0.7/ trap net) is average. Ages 0-2 were sampled and growth seems about average. The Bluegill population seems to increasing, with the catch rising from 7.0/trap net in 1976 to 11.0/trap net. Most fish were at least six inches long. A strong 1983 year class is present. As in 1976, Black Crappies were about twice as abundant as whites. However, the catch increased tenfold since 1976; 1.5 to 15.3/trap net for whites and 3 to 31.3/trap net for blacks. Their abundance are now high. Yellow Perch numbers (3.0/gill net) are similar to Watab Lake. Other forage species are abundant. Black bullhead numbers (18.0/trap net) are similar to 1986. As in Watab Lake, Yellow Bullheads in Rossier have increased to 6.0/trap net and Brown Bullheads (3.0/trap net) were first sampled in 1983. Common Carp (0.3/trap net) were sampled in lower numbers however, carp abundance may well be higher than the catch indicates.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Watab-Rossier Lakes are located in Stearns County, two miles north of the City of St. Joseph.  The lakes are relatively deep, and the Watab River flows through them on its way to the Mississippi.  Watab (Long) is a recreational development lake while Rossier (Rose) is a natural environment lake.  There is a private access on the north side of Watab Lake that belongs to the St. Joseph Rod and Gun Club and use of the access is limited to members only. This was the first full survey since 1989. <br> \n <br> \nNet catches were light overall.   This may be due to abrupt drop-offs in depth along the shoreline. <br> \n <br> \nFew walleye were captured in gill nets.  However, the walleye catch was within the range of expected values for lakes similar to Watab-Rossier.  In a combined sample of all gear types, walleye ranged in length from 12 - 20 inches. Walleye populations may be greater than the nets indicate.  Anglers reported catching multiple walleyes at the time of the survey.  These reports are of interest because the Rod and Gun Club has stocked the lakes with walleye fingerlings nearly every year since 2000. <br> \n <br> \nGill net catch rates of northern pike were within the expected range for Watab (4.0/net), but below the expected range for Rossier (2.0/net).  Average size was lower on Watab (1.7 pounds) than Rossier (3.3 pounds).  All northern pike taken with gill nets were less than 24 inches in Watab Lake.  Three of four northern pike taken in Rossier Lake were 24 inches or larger.  Northern Pike grew at an average rate and reached 23.5 inches in four years. <br> \n <br> \nA total of six channel catfish were sampled in gill nets. Catfish ranged in length from 23 - 25 inches with an average weight of 4.7 pounds. This marks the first time channel catfish have been sampled in Watab and Rossier Lakes.  The origin of these fish is likely the Mississippi River. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass were sampled by electrofishing during the day on May 23, 2008.  A total of 97 largemouth were taken in 1.12 hours of effort for a catch per unit of effort of 86.6/hour, higher than the Stearns County (nighttime) average of 67/hr.  Largemouth ranged in size from 7 to 20.5 inches.  Largemouth bass grew at rate similar to statewide averages, and reached nearly 15 inches by age five.  Six smallmouth bass were captured in addition to the largemouth and ranged in length from 10 - 17.5 inches.  Anglers can expect good bass fishing in Watab-Rossier Lakes. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill were uncommon and small.  The trap net catches were below the range of expected values for both Watab and Rossier.  Only three bluegill larger than seven inches were sampled. <br> \n <br> \nTrap net catch rates of black crappie were slightly above average (2.7/net) in Rossier but below the expected range for Watab (0.3/net).  Black crappie were small and only two fish larger than eight inches were captured. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",
