                "narrative": "<p>Wabedo Lake (DOW # 110171) is a 1,185-acre lake located about two miles south of the City of Longville, MN.  It is connected to Little Boy Lake by a navigable channel. The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MNDNR) has classified Minnesota lakes into 43 different classes based on physical, chemical and other characteristics.  Wabedo Lake is in Lake Class 22; lakes in this class are generally clear, very large, very deep, have a low percentage of shallow water area, and have very irregularly shaped shoreline with many bays or points.   <br> \n <br> \nSeveral muskellunge were sampled in 2009 in Wabedo Lake.  Black crappie abundance was similar to other lakes of this type, and these fish ranged from 6 to 10 inches.  Walleye were moderately abundant in the 2009, with abundance being similar to that found in other lakes of this ecological type.  Fish from 7 to 28 inches were sampled in MNDNR test nets. Both the number and average size of northern pike in Wabedo Lake is good; sampled fish ranged from 10 to 36 inches and had an average length of 23 inches.  There is a 24 to 36-inch protected slot limit regulation in effect on this lake. The bluegill population is comparable to other lakes of this type, and fish up to 7.7 inches were found, however most of the bluegill are small.  Yellow perch are abundant in Wabedo Lake.  Most of the yellow perch sampled in MNDNR test nets were small, and ranged in size from 4.8 to 10.7 inches.  Other species sampled in 2009 included cisco (tullibee),  largemouth bass, pumpkinseed sunfish, rock bass, smallmouth bass, white sucker, and yellow bullhead.  <br> \n   <br> \nAnglers can help maintain or improve the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for table fare, but encourages release of medium- to large-sized fish.  Releasing these fish can help maintain balance in the fish community in Wabedo Lake and provide anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future.   <br> \n <br> \nShoreline areas on the land and into the shallow water provide essential habitat for fish and wildlife that live in or near Minnesota\u0019s lakes.  Overdeveloped shorelines can\u0019t support the fish, wildlife, and clean water that are associated with natural undeveloped lakes.  Shoreline habitat consists of aquatic plants, woody plants and natural lake bottom soils.  Plants in the water and at the water\u0019s edge provide habitat, prevent erosion and absorb excess nutrients. Shrubs, trees, and woody debris such as fallen trees or limbs provide good habitat both above and below the water and should be left in place.  By leaving a buffer strip of natural vegetation along the shoreline, property owners can reduce erosion, help maintain water quality, and provide habitat and travel corridors for wildlife. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of nearshore fish species in Wabedo Lake was conducted on July 10-12, 2018 by Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program Staff.  Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot seine, where possible.  Backpack electrofishing was completed at 18 sampling stations, but two stations were sampled from the boat due to site conditions.  Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample 16 stations, and site conditions prevented the use of seines at two stations.  Nearshore sampling captured 22 species of fish including ten species that are intolerant of disturbance (Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, Mimic Shiner, Mottled Sculpin, Pugnose Shiner, Rock Bass, Smallmouth Bass, and Tadpole Madtom) and none that are tolerant of disturbance. <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore data were combined with trap net and gill net data from a July 2018 standard survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based IBI (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment.  In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g. Blackchin Shiner, Iowa Darter, and Rock Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g. Green Sunfish).  The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake.  For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.   <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey indicates Wabedo Lake is in exceptional health as indicated by an FIBI score well above the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes.  Data from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Leech Lake River Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Wabedo Lake is a 1,226 acre lake with 11.32 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 95 feet located south of Longville, MN. There is a Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MNDNR) owned public access on the south shore. Wabedo Lake is connected to Little Boy Lake via a short navigable channel. The DNR has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different classes based on physical, chemical and other characteristics. Wabedo Lake is in Lake Class 22; lakes in the class are generally clear, large, deep lakes with a low percentage of shallow water area and have very irregularly shaped shorelines with many bays or points. Other Lake Class 22 lakes in the Walker Area include Ten Mile, Woman, Little Boy, and Steamboat. A 24 to 36 inches Protected Slot Limit three in possession with one over 36\" allowed in possession special regulation for Northern Pike, was implemented in 2003. An experimental regulation for Walleye of an 18 to 26 inches Protected Slot Limit, possession limit of four with one over 26\" allowed in possession was implemented in 2018. A standard lake survey was completed in 2021. <br> \n <br> \nWabedo Lake is a great multi-species lake with the potential to produce trophy size fish. Muskellunge up to 50 inches were sampled in the spring of 2019, with several fish captured exceeding 45 inches long. Walleye abundance increased from previous surveys yet remained below management goals, and lengths ranged from 12 to 28 inches long. Smallmouth Bass up to 19 inches long were sampled however, management goals have not been established for Smallmouth Bass. Northern Pike abundance exceeded the maximum management goal and ranged in length from 14 to 33 inches, and partially met management size goals. Black Crappie up to 12 inches long were sampled however, management goals for Black Crappie have not been established. Bluegill measuring up to 8 inches were sampled although, did not meet abundance or size structure goals. <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species sampled include Bowfin (Dogfish), Hybrid Sunfish, Largemouth Bass, Pumpkinseed, Rock Bass, Tullibee (Cisco), White Sucker, Yellow Bullhead, and Yellow Perch. <br> \n <br> \nPeople can have significant impacts on lakes and the fish populations they support. Harvest, lakeshore development, removal of shoreline vegetation, and introductions of invasive species can all adversely affect fish populations. Currently the only aquatic invasive species (AIS) that have been identified in Wabedo Lake are Rusty Crayfish and Chinese Mystery Snails. AIS are moved from infested to non-infested waters by anglers, boaters, and lake shore owners and can adversely impact lakes and fish populations. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access. If you suspect an infestation of an invasive species in this lake, save a specimen and report it to a local natural resource office. Additional information on all of these topics can be found on the DNR website (www.dnr.state.mn.us) or by contacting the Walker Area Fisheries office. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of nearshore fish species in Wabedo Lake was conducted on August 1-3, 2022, by Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program staff. Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake, and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at eighteen sampling stations, but two stations were sampled from the boat due to site conditions. Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample ten stations, a 15-foot seine was used at six stations, and site conditions prevented the use of seines at two stations. Nearshore sampling captured twenty-nine species of fish including twelve species that are intolerant of disturbance (i.e., Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, Least Darter, Logperch, Mimic Shiner, Mottled Sculpin, Muskellunge, Pugnose Shiner, Rock Bass, and Smallmouth Bass) and two that are tolerant of disturbance (i.e., Black Bullhead and Green Sunfish). <br> \n <br> \nA concurrent summer trap net survey was also conducted by IBI Program staff. Twelve trap nets were set along the shoreline in locations that encompassed multiple habitat types. Trap net sampling captured ten species of fish, including one that is intolerant of disturbance (i.e., Rock Bass). Bluegill comprised a majority of the catch by number, whereas Bowfin, Northern Pike, and Bluegill comprised a majority by biomass. <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore and trap net data were combined with gill net data from a July 2021 survey to describe the fish community and provide a fish-based IBI (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment. In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g., Blackchin Shiner, Least Darter, and Rock Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g., Black Bullhead and Green Sunfish). The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.  <br> \n <br> \nResults from this survey indicate that the fish community in Wabedo Lake is healthy as indicated by an FIBI score that exceeds the exceptional use threshold determined for similar lakes. These results will be considered when the biological health of the lake is assessed during the Leech Lake River Watershed assessment process, which will be completed in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency. <br> \n <br> \nTemperature-dissolved oxygen profiles were also collected in the deepest basins on Wabedo Lake on August 1st, 2022, to evaluate the amount of cold, oxygenated water (i.e., oxythermal habitat) available to Cisco, also known as Tullibee. Based on the profile from the deepest basin, the top of the thermocline (i.e., the location in the water column with the sharpest transition from warm to cold water) occurred at approximately 20 feet. Dissolved oxygen decreased to below 3.0 mg/L at 20.6 feet, which was within the thermocline, at the time of sampling. The temperature at which dissolved oxygen decreased to below 3.0 mg/L (i.e., TDO3, a single variable to characterize oxythermal habitat) was 17.6?C (63.7?F). <br> \n <br> \nTDO3 values near 21.5?C indicate that oxythermal conditions are marginal for Cisco. Dissolved oxygen concentrations near the thermocline indicate that oxythermal habitat was adequate for Cisco at limited depths at the time of sampling during the summer of 2022. However, low dissolved oxygen concentrations (i.e., less than 3 mg/L) below the thermocline and warm surface temperatures would likely limit available Cisco habitat within the water column to an extent. When inadequate oxythermal habitat is available, Cisco are squeezed into unfavorable, warmer water conditions and experience higher levels of stress. </p>",

THEY PROVIDE EXCELLENT FORAGE FOR NORTHERN PIKE, MUSKELLUNGE AND WALLEYE. THE GILLNET CATCH OF NORTHERN PIKE (3.6) IS WITHIN THE HISTORICAL RANGE OF 2.0 TO 6.2. THE DRIER YEARS AND RESULTANT LOWER WATER LEVELS APPEAR TO BE THE POSSIBLE REASON FOR THE LOWER CATCH RATE OF NORTHERN PIKE SINCE FEWER SMALL FISH WERE COLLECTED DURING 1990, AS COMPARED TO 1985. QUALITY SIZE NORTHERN PIKE WERE SAMPLED.  THEIR GROWTH RATE IS GOOD. NO MUSKELLUNGE WERE SAMPELD DURING THIS ASSESSMENT.  SAMPLING DIRECTED TOWARD MUSKELLUNGE WILL BE IMPLEMENTED DURING 1991. THE TRAPNET CATCH OF BLUEGILL HAS INCREASED DRAMATICALLY OVER TIME, FROM 1.9/TN IN 1969 TO 36.6/TN IN 1990.  THE REASON FOR THE INCREASE IS UNKNOWN.  THERE ARE QUALITY SIZE FISH PRESENT RSD-7 AND RSE-8 VALUES OF 8 AND 2, BUT MOST (86%) OF THE SAMPLE IS LESS THAN 6 INCHES LONG.  THE SAME INCREASE IN CATCH RATES AND PREPONDERANCE OF SMALL BLUEGILL IS OCCURRING LITTLE BOY LAKE. THE SUMMER ASSESSMENT NETTING SAMPLED FEW LARGEMOUTH BASS OR BLACK CRAPPIE.  SPRING ELCTROFISHING AND/OR TRAPNETTING NEEDS TO BE CONDUCTED TO BETTER ASSESS THESE POPULATIONS. THE LENGTH FREQUENCIES FROM THE SUMMER NETTING SHOW SEVERAL SIZE CLASSES OF EACH SPECIES PRESENTQ IN WABEDO LAKE. THE YELLOW PERCH GILLNET CATCH OF 22.1 IS WITH- IN THE HISTORICAL RANGE OF 20.7 TO 35.6. THE WALLEYE GILLNET CATCH OF 6.6 IS SLIGHTLY HIGHER THAN THE HISTORICAL RANGE OF 2.1 TO 5.6. THE LOWER CATCH RATE OF 2.1 IN 1985 MAY BE DUE TO CONDUCTING THE ASSESSMENT DURING MID-JUNE INSTEAD TO DURING MID-JULY WHEN THE OTHER ASSESSMENTS WERE CONDUCTED.  SEVERAL YEAR CLASSES WERE WELL REPRESENTED IN THE SAMPLE.  COMPARING YEAR CLASS STRENGTH AND PRESENCE IN THIS ASSESSMENT, AS WELL AS PREVIOUS ASSESSMENTS, TO WALLEYE STOCKING RECORDS, IT IS APPARENT THAT NATURAL REPRODUCTION IS ACCOUNTING FOR MOST, IF NOT ALL, OF THE WALLEYE POPULATION IN WABEDO LAKE.</p>",

Wabedo Lake has 10.02 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 74 feet. The DNR has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different classes based on physical, chemical and other characteristics. Wabedo Lake is in Lake Class 22; lakes in the class are generally clear, large, deep lakes with a low percentage of shallow water area and have very irregularly shaped shorelines with many bays or points. <br> \n <br> \nWabedo Lake is a multi-species lake with the potential to produce trophy size fish. Muskellunge up to 50 inches were sampled in the spring, with most fish sampled between 36-44 inches. While Walleye numbers in Wabedo Lake are down compared to previous surveys, large fish are present. A wide range of sizes of Walleyes were sampled with lengths ranging from 10 to 27 inches. Northern Pike are also abundant in Wabedo Lake with pike sampled from15 to 34 inches. In addition, Wabedo Lake has a low density Smallmouth Bass population with fish up to 19 inches present. Bluegill and Black Crappie can also provide additional fishing opportunities to anglers. Bluegills up to 7 inches were sampled along with Black Crappie up to 12 inches. <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species that anglers can expect to encounter include Bowfin (Dogfish), Largemouth Bass, Pumpkinseed Sunfish, Rock Bass, Tullibee (Cisco), White Sucker, Yellow Bullhead, and Yellow Perch. <br> \n <br> \nPeople can have significant impacts on lakes and the fish populations they support. Harvest, lakeshore development, removal of shoreline vegetation, and introductions of invasive species can all adversely affect fish populations. Currently the only aquatic invasive species that have been identified in Wabedo Lake are Rusty Crayfish and Chinese Mystery Snails. AIS (aquatic invasive species) are moved from infested to non-infested waters by anglers, boaters, and lake shore owners and can adversely impact lakes and fish populations. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access. If you suspect an infestation of an invasive species in this lake, save a specimen and report it to a local natural resource office. Additional information on all of these topics can be found on the DNR website (www.dnr.state.mn.us) or by contacting the Walker Area Fisheries office. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Wabedo Lake (DOW # 110171) is a 1,185-acre lake located about two miles south of the City of Longville, MN.  It is connected to Little Boy Lake by a navigable channel. The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MNDNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different classes based on physical, chemical and other characteristics.  Wabedo Lake is in Lake Class 22; lakes in this class are generally clear, very large, very deep, have a low percentage of shallow water area, and have very irregularly shaped shoreline with many bays or points.  Wabedo Lake is managed primarily for muskellunge, black crappie, and walleye and secondarily for northern pike, smallmouth bass, largemouth bass, bluegill, cisco (tullibee), and yellow perch. Muskellunge are present in Wabedo Lake, but the 2005 survey did not include spring trap netting targeting this species. Black crappie abundance was similar to other lakes of this type, and these fish ranged from 4.3 to 12.2 inches.  Walleye abundance in the 2005 sampling in Wabedo Lake was below the average in ecologically similar lakes.  Fish from 9 to 30 inches were sampled in MNDNR test nets.  For several decades, Wabedo Lake has been stocked with walleye fry (small, newly-hatched fish) about every third year.  However, it does not appear that walleye fry stocking has been successful at increasing the Wabedo Lake walleye population.  In an attempt to increase walleye abundance and due to the lack of success with fry stocking, the Wabedo Lake management plan has been revised to call for stocking walleye fingerlings every other year beginning in 2006.  Both the number and average size of northern pike in Wabedo Lake is good; sampled fish ranged from 13 to 33 inches and had an average length of almost 25 inches.  There is a 24 to 36-inch protected slot limit regulation in effect on this lake.  The bluegill population is comparable to other lakes of this type, and fish up to 7.6 inches were found, however most of the bluegill are small.  Yellow perch are abundant in Wabedo Lake.  Most of the yellow perch sampled in MNDNR test nets were small, and ranged in size from 4.4 to 10.7 inches.  Other species present include black bullhead, bowfin (dogfish), brown bullhead, cisco (tullibee), hybrid sunfish, largemouth bass, muskellunge, smallmouth bass, pumpkinseed sunfish, rock bass, smallmouth bass, white sucker, and yellow bullhead.   Anglers can help maintain or improve the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for table fare, but encourages release of medium- to large-sized fish.  Releasing these fish can help maintain balance in the fish community in Wabedo Lake and provide anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future.  Shoreline areas on the land and into the shallow water provide essential habitat for fish and wildlife that live in or near Minnesota's lakes.  Overdeveloped shorelines can't support the fish, wildlife, and clean water that are associated with natural undeveloped lakes. The combined effects of all lakeshore owners \"fixing up\" their property can destroy a lake's valuable natural shorelines.Shoreline habitat consists of aquatic plants, woody plants and natural lake bottom soils.Plants in the water and at the water's edge provide habitat, prevent erosion and absorb excess nutrients. Shrubs, trees, and woody debris such as fallen trees or limbs provide good habitat both above and below the water and should be left in place.  Natural lake bottom materials like silt or gravel are more ecologically productive than pure sand trucked in for a swimming beach.  A tidy lawn and a sandy beach make great spots for sunbathing and swimming but do little to provide habitat for fish and wildlife. By leaving a buffer strip of natural vegetation along the shoreline, property owners can reduce erosion, help maintain water quality, and provide habitat and travel corridors for wildlife.Only if more lakeshore owners manage their shoreline in a natural condition can fish and wildlife populations on Minnesota lakes remain healthy and abundant.  More specific information on protecting or restoring shorelines and watersheds is available through the local DNR Fisheries office. </p>",

Wabedo Lake belongs to Lake Class 22.  Other area lakes in the same lake class are:  Inguadona (2.5miles northeast), Long (5 miles north), and Ten Mile (15 miles west) Lakes.Spring (ice out) trapnetting, summer survey, and fall electrofishing were conducted in 1993.  Game fish caughtwere muskellunge, northern pike, walleye, largemouth bass, smallmouth bass, black crappie, bluegill, rock bass,pumpkinseed, and yellow perch.Walleye were sampled at a rate that was typical of past assessments and other Lake Class 22 lakes.  Sampledwalleye ranged in length from 11.0 - 30.3 inches. Many year classes were represented in the age and growthanalysis indicating a stable walleye fishery. Strong evidence also exists indicating natural reproduction isprimarily responsible for the walleye fishery.Northern pike were sampled at a rate below what is typically found in Lake Class 22 lakes.  However, the northernpike that were captured were of excellent size.All of the sampled muskellunge were caught during spring trapnetting.  These were mature fish resulting fromnatural reproduction.Many nongame species were captured including bullheads, cisco, and white sucker.</p>",

Three profiles were collected due to the size and complexity of the lake (i.e., Water Quality Station 1, 2 and 3).  Based on the average of the three profiles, the top of the thermocline (i.e., the location in the water column with the sharpest transition from warm to cold water) occurred at approximately 13 feet. Dissolved oxygen decreased to below 3.0 mg/L at 24.5 feet in Water Quality Station 1 (WQ 1), 18.8 feet in WQ 2, and 24.5 feet in WQ 3, all of which were below the thermocline at the time of sampling. The temperature at which dissolved oxygen decreased to below 3.0 mg/L in WQ 3 (i.e., TDO3, a single variable to characterize oxythermal habitat) was 8.2?C (46.8?F). <br> \n <br> \nTDO3 values cooler than 21.5?C for Cisco indicate that oxythermal conditions are favorable for these species. Dissolved oxygen concentrations indicate that suitable oxythermal habitat for these species was available across a range of depths at the time of sampling. When adequate oxythermal habitat is available, Cisco are not squeezed into unfavorable, warmer water conditions and therefore do not experience higher levels of stress.</p>",

WABEDO WILL NOT BE STOCKED WITH MUE DURING THIS PROJECT, BUT WILL SEVE AS THE CONTROL LAKE FOR THE EXPERIMENT.  DURING THE SPRING 1991 TRAPNETTING, THE EQUIVALENT OF 196 24-HOUR TRAPNET SETS WERE MADE TO COLLECT MUE AND OTHER SPECIES. FOUR MUE, RANGING FROM 34 TO 38 INCHES WERE COLLECTED DURING THIS TRAPNETTING.  THIS LOW MUE CATCH RATE MAY HAVE BEEN CAUSED BY LOW WATER TEMPERATURES AND TEMPERATURE FLUCTUATIONS THAT OCCURRED DURING THE SPRING 1991 NETTING.   ONE MUE, 19 INCHES LONG, WAS COLLECTED DURING FALL ELECTROFISHING.  THOUGH THE SPRING 1991 TRAPNETTING DID NOT SAMPLE MANY MUE, THIS NETTING PROVIDED ABUNDANT SAMPLES OF MANY OTHER SPECIES. THE 1991 SPRING TRAPNETTING CATCH RATE FOR NOP WAS VERY CLOSE TO THE TRAPNETTING CATCH RATES FOUND IN PREVIOUS ASSESSMENTS.  NOP RANGED FROM 9 TO 35 INCHES (PSD=45, RSD-25=14).  BLG WERE TAKEN AT A RATE OF 9.7 FISH/SET.  THIS IS SIMILAR TO THE SUMMER TRAPNET CATCH RATE IN 1978,  BUT BELOW THE 1985 AND 1990 SUMMER RATES.  BLG TAKEN IN THE SPRING, 1991 TRAPNETTING WERE SLIGHTLY LARGER THAN THOSE SAMPLED IN THE 1990 SURVEY, WHICH WAS DONE DURING JULY.  BLG CAUGHT IN SPRING 1991 HAD A PSD OF 28 AND RSD-7 OF 12.  THE LARGEST BLG WERE 8.5- 8.9 INCHES.  LMB WERE COLLECTED AT A RATE OF 0.35 FISH/SET, WHICH IS SIMILAR TO OTHER RECENT POPULATION ASSESSMENTS ON WABEDO.  LMB WERE LARGER THAN THOSE TAKEN IN THE 1990 ASSESSMENT AND HAD A PSD OF 85 AND RSD-15 OF 55.  NINETY-TWO BLC WERE SAMPLED (0.5 FISH/SET) AND THE LARGEST INDIVIDUALS WERE 13 INCHES (PSD=65, RSD-12=11).  THE WAE TRAPNET CATCH RATE (1.25 FISH/SET) WAS SLIGHTLY HIGHER THAN TRAPNET CATCH RATES IN OTHER POPULATION ASSESSMENTS.  WAE RANGED FROM 12 TO 31 INCHES.  WAE HAD A VERY GOOD SIZE DISTRIBUTION (PSD=86, RSD-18=50), PERHAPS DUE TO THE FACT THAT THE SPRING TRAPNETTING WAS DONE DURING WAE SPAWNING SEASON, WHEN LARGER, SEXUALLY MATURE WAE WOULD BE EXPECTED TO BE QUITE ACTIVE.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Wabedo Lake is located four miles south of Longville in northern Cass County.  It is attached via a navigable channel to Little Boy Lake.  The Minnesota DNR has a public access on both lakes.  The access on Wabedo Lake is on the southwest end of the lake off of County Road 120.  Wabedo Lake has an area of 1185 acres with a maximum depth of 95 feet.  The Minnesota DNR has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different lake classes based on chemical and physical characteristics.  Wabedo Lake is in lake class 22.  Lakes in this class are moderately large and deep with moderately clear water.  Other area lakes in the same lake class include Little Boy, Woman, Ten Mile, Pine Mountain, and Steamboat Lakes.  Little Boy Lake supports good fishing for northern pike, walleye, bluegill, black crappie, largemouth bass, and muskellunge.  The lake is managed primarily for walleye and muskellunge.Walleye were sampled at a rate that was comparable to past surveys.  Anglers can expect to catch walleye of many sizes.  Natural reproduction can produce strong year classes of walleye, however, many of the strongest year classes during the last 10 occurred when walleye fry were stocked.  Wabedo Lake has abundant rock rubble areas around the entire lake that are used by spawning walleye and need to be protected if walleye abundance is to continue.  Fish were growing at a rate that was typical of other area lake class 22 lakes.Wabedo Lake is known for its excellent muskellunge fishing.  These fish are the result of natural reproduction.  Muskellunge over 50 inches are present.Several species of panfish are present in Wabedo Lake.  Panfish of quality size include bluegill, black crappie, rock bass, and yellow perch.  To maintain such good quality, anglers need to use some restraint if large panfish are really biting.  Release the larger fish and keep the smaller ones for eating.  Quality size panfish have disappeared from many lakes due to excessive harvest by anglers.Northern pike abundance for 1999 was typical of past surveys and of other lakes in lake class 22.  There is a wide range of lengths.  The growth rate of northern pike was slightly better than what occurs in other area lake class 22 lakes.Yellow perch and ciscoes (tullibees) provide excellent forage for muskellunge, northern pike, and walleye.Anglers can help maintain or improve the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for table fare, but encourages release of medium to large fish.  Releasing medium to large size fish will provide anglers with opportunities to catch more and larger fish in the future and can help maintain balance in the fish community.Shoreline areas - on the land and into the shallow water - provide essential habitat for fish and wildlife that live in or near Minnesota's lakes.  Overdeveloped shorelines can't support the fish, wildlife, and clean water that are associated with natural undeveloped lakes.  The combined effects of all lakeshore owners \"fixing up\" their property can destroy a lake's valuable natural shorelines.Shoreline habitat consists of aquatic plants, woody plants, and natural lake bottom soils.  Plants in the water and at the water's edge provide habitat, prevent erosion, and absorb excess nutrients.  Shrubs, trees, and woody debris such as fallen trees or limbs provide good habitat both above and below the water and should be left in place.  Natural lake bottom materials like silt or gravel are more ecologically productive than pure sand trucked in for a swimming beach.  A tidy lawn and a sandy beach make great spots for sunbathing and swimming but do little to provide habitat for fish and wildlife.  By leaving a buffer strip of natural vegetation along the shoreline, property owners can reduce erosion, help maintain water quality, and provide habitat and travel corridors for wildlife.Only if more lakeshore owners manage their shoreline in a natural condition can fish and wildlife populations on Minnesota lakes remain healthy and abundant.  More specific information on protecting or restoring shorelines and watersheds is available through DNR Fisheries offices.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Wabedo Lake (DOW # 110171) is a 1,185 acre lake located about two miles south of the City of Longville, MN.  It is connected to Little Boy Lake by a navigable channel. The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MNDNR) has classified Minnesota lakes into 43 different classes based on physical, chemical and other characteristics.  Wabedo Lake is in Lake Class 22; lakes in this class are generally clear, large, very deep, have a low percentage of shallow water area, and have a very irregularly shaped shoreline with many bays or points.  The lake is managed primarily for black crappie, muskellunge, northern pike and walleye and secondarily for bluegill, cisco, largemouth bass, smallmouth bass and yellow perch. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie abundance was similar in the 2012 sample to other lakes of this type with increasing catch rates in recent years.  Average lengths for black crappie were 9 inches with fish up to 14 inches being sampled.  Muskellunge were not sampled in 2012 but have been observed in previous years with fish up to 52 inches being sampled.  Walleye were moderately abundant in the 2012 sample, with fish ranging in length from 8 to 28 inches.  The number and average size of northern pike in Wabedo Lake are near or above management goals; sampled fish ranged from 12 to 34 inches and had an average length of 22 inches.  There is a 24 to 36 inch protected slot limit in effect for northern pike on this lake. Bluegill numbers are comparable to other lakes of this type. Fish up to 8 inches were found, however most of the bluegill are small.  Yellow perch numbers are at a historical low in Wabedo Lake.  Most of the yellow perch sampled in MNDNR test nets were small, averaging just over 6 inches long.  Other species sampled in 2009 included cisco (tullibee),  largemouth bass, pumpkinseed sunfish, rock bass, smallmouth bass, white sucker, and yellow bullhead.  <br> \n <br> \nPeople can have significant impacts on lakes and the fish populations they support.  Harvest, lakeshore development, removal of shoreline vegetation, and introductions of invasive species can all adversely affect fish populations.  Currently the only aquatic invasive species (AIS) that has been identified in Wabedo Lake is the rusty crayfish.  AIS are moved from infested to non-infested waters by anglers, boaters, and lake shore owners and can adversely impact lakes and fish populations.  To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access.  If you suspect an infestation of an invasive species in this lake, save a specimen and report it to a local natural resource office.  Additional information on all of these topics can be found on the DNR website (www.dnr.state.mn.us) or by contacting the Walker Area Fisheries office. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Wabedo Lake (DOW# 11-0171; Lake Class 22) is a 1,226 acre lake located near Longville, MN. There is a DNR owned public access on the southwest shore. Wabedo Lake is connected to Little Boy Lake (DOW# 11-0167; Lake Class 22) via a short navigable channel. Wabedo Lake has 11.32 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 95 feet. The DNR has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different classes based on physical, chemical and other characteristics. Wabedo Lake is in Lake Class 22; lakes in this class are generally clear, large, deep lakes with a low percentage of shallow water area and have very irregularly shaped shorelines with many bays or points. Other Lake Class 22 lakes in the Walker Area include Ten Mile, Woman, Wabedo, and Steamboat. A special regulation for Northern Pike of a 24\" to 36\" Protected Slot Limit, three in possession with one over 36\" allowed in possession was implemented in 2003. An experimental regulation for Walleye of an 18\" to 26\" Protected Slot Limit, possession limit four with one over 26\" allowed in possession was implemented in 2018. The purpose of the 2018 survey was to assess gamefish populations in Wabedo Lake. <br> \n <br> \nWabedo Lake is a multi-species lake with the potential to produce trophy size fish. Muskellunge up to 50 inches were sampled in the spring of 2015, with several fish in the sample between 36-44 inches long. While Walleye numbers in Wabedo Lake are down compared to previous surveys, large fish are present. Walleye lengths ranged from 8 to 28 inches. Northern Pike are also abundant in Wabedo Lake with pike sampled from 14 to 38 inches long. Most Northern pike were between 18 and 27 inches long. Largemouth Bass are moderately abundant and bass up to 17 inches long were sampled. In addition, Wabedo Lake has a low density Smallmouth Bass population with fish up to 19 inches long present. Black Crappie can also provide additional fishing opportunity but they may be difficult to locate. Black Crappie ranged in length from 4 to 13 inches long. Bluegill were generally small with few fish exceeding 8 inches long. Other fish species that anglers can expect to encounter include Bowfin (Dogfish), Brown Bullhead,  Pumpkinseed Sunfish, Rock Bass, Tullibee (Cisco), White Sucker, Yellow Bullhead, and Yellow Perch. <br> \n <br> \nPeople can have significant impacts on lakes and the fish populations they support. Harvest, lakeshore development, removal of shoreline vegetation, and introductions of invasive species can all adversely affect fish populations. Currently the only aquatic invasive species (AIS) that have been identified in Wabedo Lake are Rusty Crayfish and Chinese Mystery Snails. Aquatic invasive species are moved from infested to non-infested waters by anglers, boaters, and lake shore owners and can adversely impact lakes and fish populations. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access. If you suspect an infestation of an invasive species in this lake, save a specimen and report it to a local natural resource office. Additional information on all of these topics can be found on the DNR website (www.dnr.state.mn.us) or by contacting the Walker Area Fisheries office. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Wabedo Lake is an 1185-acre lake located near Longville, MN.  With a maximum depth of 95 feet, approximately 25% of the lake is less than 15 feet deep.  A public access is located on the southwest shore just off County Road 120.  The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MNDNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different classes based on physical, chemical and other characteristics.  Wabedo Lake is in Lake Class 22; lakes in this class are generally clear, irregularly shaped, very deep, and have a low percentage of littoral area.  This lake is primarily managed for muskellunge, black crappie, and walleye, and secondarily for northern pike, smallmouth bass, largemouth bass, bluegill, cisco, and yellow perch.Wabedo Lake is a well-known muskellunge fishing spot which can provide quality angling for this species. Northern pike are abundant in Wabedo Lake, and the average fish sampled was 24 inches long.  A 24 to 36-inch protected slot limit regulation on northern pike will be implemented on Wabedo Lake starting with the 2003 fishing season in an effort to increase the number of large fish.     The lake has a good naturally reproducing walleye population, though the numbers of walleye were slightly below the average for lakes in this class. Surveys of anglers in 2000 and 2001 showed that fishing for this species in Wabedo Lake was slower than in most lakes of this type.  Walleye up to 30 inches long were sampled, though the average length was about 18 inches.  In addition to natural reproduction, the lake is stocked with walleye fry (new-hatched fish) every second year.  Future surveys will continue to evaluate whether stocking is effective in increasing the walleye population.  The numbers of bluegill sampled in Wabedo Lake compares favorably with other lakes in this Lake Class. This lake has an abundant population of black crappie and anglers reported catching good numbers of this species in 2000 and 2001.   Based upon 2002 sampling results, yellow perch abundance was good, and anglers reported catching good numbers of this species in 2000 and 2001.       Other fish species available for anglers include bowfin, brown bullhead, burbot, cisco (tullibee), hybrid sunfish, largemouth bass, pumpkinseed sunfish, redhorse species, rock bass, white sucker, and yellow bullhead Anglers can help maintain or improve the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for table fare, but encourages release of medium- to large-sized fish.  Releasing these fish can help maintain balance in the fish community in Wabedo Lake and provide anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future.  Shoreline areas on the land and into the shallow water provide essential habitat for fish and wildlife that live in or near Minnesota's lakes.  Overdeveloped shorelines can't support the fish, wildlife, and clean water that are associated with natural undeveloped lakes. The combined effects of all lakeshore owners \"fixing up\" their property can destroy a lake's valuable natural shorelines.Shoreline habitat consists of aquatic plants, woody plants and natural lake bottom soils.  Plants in the water and at the water's edge provide habitat, prevent erosion and absorb excess nutrients. Shrubs, trees, and woody debris such as fallen trees or limbs provide good habitat both above and below the water and should be left in place.  Natural lake bottom materials like silt or gravel are more ecologically productive than pure sand trucked in for a swimming beach.  A tidy lawn and a sandy beach make great spots for sunbathing and swimming but do little to provide habitat for fish and wildlife. By leaving a buffer strip of natural vegetation along the shoreline, property owners can reduce erosion, help maintain water quality, and provide habitat and travel corridors for wildlife.Only if more lakeshore owners manage their shoreline in a natural condition can fish and wildlife populations on Minnesota lakes remain healthy and abundant.  More specific information on protecting or restoring shorelines and watersheds is available through the local DNR Fisheries office.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Wabedo Lake (DOW# 11-0171-00; Lake Class 22) is a 1,226-acre lake with 295 littoral acres, 11.32 miles of shoreline, and a maximum depth of 95 feet located south of Longville, MN. A MNDNR owned public access is located on the Northwest shore. The lake is primarily managed for Black Crappie, Muskellunge, Northern Pike, and Walleye and secondarily for Bluegill, Largemouth Bass, Smallmouth Bass, and Tullibee (Cisco). The lake was initially surveyed in 1940 with 16 population assessment surveys occurring since. The 2023 survey was the first spring survey targeting Black Crappie and Bluegill completed on Wabedo Lake. The purpose of this survey was to collect population metrics for Bluegill and Black Crappie. The survey was completed May 12th, 2023. <br> \n <br> \nBoth Black Crappie and Bluegill provide quality angling opportunities. Black Crappie ranged in length from 6 to 15 inches with an average length and weight of 10 inches and 0.6 pounds. Bluegill ranged in length from 3 to 10 inches with and average length and weight of 5 inches and 0.1 pounds. <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species sampled during the survey include Black Bullhead, Bowfin (Dogfish), Brown Bullhead, Golden Shiner, Hybrid Sunfish, Largemouth Bass, Muskellunge, Northern Pike, Pumpkinseed, Rock Bass, Smallmouth Bass, Walleye, White Sucker, Yellow Bullhead, and Yellow Perch. <br> \n <br> \nPeople can have significant impacts on lakes and the fish populations they support. Harvest, lakeshore development, removal of shoreline vegetation, and introductions of invasive species can all adversely affect fish populations. Currently, no aquatic invasive species (AIS) have been identified in Wabedo Lake. AIS are moved from infested to non-infested waters by anglers, boaters, and lake shore owners and can adversely impact lakes and fish populations. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access. If you suspect an infestation of an invasive species in this lake, save a specimen and report it to a local natural resource office. Additional information on these topics can be found on the DNR website (www.dnr.state.mn.us) or by contacting the Walker Area Fisheries office. <br> \n</p>",
