CRAPPIES ARE SMALL AND HEAVILY DOMINATED BY AGE I FISH, WITH A FEW II, IV, AND V AGE CLASS FISH PRESENT. GROWTH SLOWS AFTER THE THIRD; NO GROWTH PROBLEM WAS PRESENT IN '81. NORTHERN PIKE HAVE SHOWN A NOTABLE INCREASE FROM 1.75/GILLNET IN '81 TO 3.17/GILLNET IN '85. THE HIGH WATER CONDITIONS APPEAR TO FAVOR SPAWNING, ALONG WITH POSSIBLE MIGRATION OF NORTHERNS FROM FRANCES LAKE. NORTHERNS ARE NOW HEAVILY DOMINATED BY YOUNG FISH, WITH A FEW III YR. OLDS PRESENT. BLACK BULLHEADS HAVE INCREASED IN ABUNDANCE SINCE '81. BLACK BULLHEADS HAVE INCREASED FROM 10.25/TRAPNET IN '81 TO 21.75/TRAPNET IN '85. THE GILLNET CATCH INCREA- SED FROM 27.00/GILLNET IN '81 TO 82.00/GILLNET IN '85. THE PRESENT BULLHEAD POPULATION APPEARS TO BE DOMINATED BY ONE AGE CLASS, AVGING 1/3 LB. LARGE- MOUTH BASS WERE SAMPLED IN LOW NUMBERS AS WAS THE CASE IN '81, BUT FISHING REPORTS INDICATE A FAIR GOOD FISHERY. YELLOW PERCH AND PUMPKINSEEDS HAVE REMAINED UNCHANGED WITH FAIR POPULATION PRESENT. TWO LARGE WALLEYES WERE SAMPLED AND THEIR ORIGIN IS UNKNOWN, WITH NO PAST STOCKING RECORDED ALTH- OUGH A FEW WALLEYES WERE NETTED IN '81. BOWFIN AND YELLOW BULLHEADS WERE FIRST SAMPLED IN '85 AND IT IS SUSPECTED THEY MIGRATED FROM FRANCES LAKE AND ARE NOW PRESENT IN LOW NUMBERS.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Introduction <br> \nRays (Charles) Lake is a 156.3 acre lake located in Le Sueur County north of the town of Elysian. A public access is located on the south side of the lake off 1st Street North, which goes north from Elysian. Rays Lake has a maximum depth of 32.0 feet. Eurasian watermilfoil is present in Rays Lake. Boaters should be sure to remove all aquatic vegetation from boats, trailers, and equipment and drain all water from livewells, transoms, and bilges when leaving the lake to prevent the spread of Eurasian watermilfoil to other lakes. Rays Lake is primarily managed for bluegill, black crappie, and largemouth bass and secondarily managed for northern pike. Fish are only stocked in Rays Lake in the event of a winterkill. Rays Lake is in Lake Class 38, based on limnological variables. Other area lakes in this same classification include Horseshoe Lake (Le Sueur County), Duck Lake (Blue Earth County), and Hunt Lake (Rice County). Rays Lake was surveyed the week of July 21st, 2014 as part of a regular monitoring program conducted by Minnesota DNR. This survey was intended to assess the fish community by deploying gill nets and trap nets, as well as recording water quality parameters. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill <br> \nThe bluegill population in Rays Lake has shown patterns of erratic recruitment, ranging from 21.8 fish/net in 1985 to 137.5 fish/net in 1990. The 2014 bluegill catch rate was 24.7 fish/net, which falls below the lake average of 63.0 fish/net. The length of bluegill collected in trap nets ranged in length from 2.6 to 8.0 inches and averaged 5.7 inches, revealing a small size structure.  <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie <br> \nAfter a record high abundance in 2009 (47.5 fish/net), black crappie catch rates dropped to 4 fish/net in 2014. This is well below the long-term average for Rays Lake (20.5 fish/net). Despite the lower abundance, the size structure of black crappie improved since the last survey in 2009. In 2009, only 3% of all black crappie measured 8.0 inches or longer. In 2014, however, 57% of the black crappie catch measured 8.0 inches or longer. The black crappie lengths averaged 7.9 inches and the largest individual was 14.3 inches, indicating a quality size structure with some larger individuals. Although black crappie were not aged, a length frequency histogram indicates that the population is mostly dominated by one single year class. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass <br> \nLargemouth bass are not effectively collected in the sampling gears used in this survey. As a result, only one fish was sampled (0.2 fish/net), which measured 14.6 inches. Anecdotal reports from shore anglers indicate quality largemouth bass fishing in Rays Lake, with some larger individuals being caught. With abundant aquatic vegetation and prey fish available, Rays Lake has the potential to be a great largemouth bass lake.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike <br> \nThe 2014 northern pike catch rate of 3.8 fish/gill net fell below the long-term lake average of 4.8 fish/gill net. Northern pike lengths ranged from 21.3 to 28.7 inches and averaged 24.2 inches, indicating a small size structure of northern pike. Most of the northern pike were from the same year class (2011), which averaged 24.5 inches in length as three year old fish. Northern pike are not stocked in Rays Lake, so the population is sustained through natural reproduction. In the event of a severe winterkill, northern pike and other game species would be stocked to initiate the population. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye <br> \nWalleye abundance in Rays Lake has remained low throughout the survey history. The catch rate in 2014 was 0.8 fish/gill net (5 total walleye). The walleye sampled during this survey were large, ranging from 22.8 to 24.8 inches and averaging 23.8 inches. Although the size structure was large, walleye seem to have slow growth in Rays Lake compared to other lakes in southern Minnesota.  <br> \n <br> \nOther Species <br> \nA total of 29 black bullheads were sampling in 2014 from both gear types. Lengths of black bullheads ranged from 6.5 to 12.1 inches and averaged 11.1 inches. Other fish species collected in low abundance included common carp (N = 14), bowfin (N = 8), freshwater drum (N = 4), yellow perch (N = 7), and pumpkinseed (N = 3). <br> \n <br> \nAnglers can play an important role in maintaining or improving a fish population by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for consumption, while encouraging the release of medium to large fish that may contribute to natural recruitment.  This practice helps maintain balance in the fish community and provides anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future.  Additionally, smaller fish often taste better and have fewer contaminants than larger, older fish from the same water body. <br> \n <br> \nShoreline property owners also play an important role in the overall health of an aquatic ecosystem, including the fish population.  Natural shorelines, including vegetation, woody debris, and bottom substrates, provide valuable habitat for fish and wildlife, help maintain water quality, and reduce bank erosion.  By leaving natural shorelines unaltered or restoring them to natural conditions, shoreline property owners are doing their part to maintain or improve a healthy ecosystem in the lake and protect the resource for future generations. <br> \n</p>",

A nearshore survey was conducted to assess the populations of both game and non-game fish species.  Ten 100-foot long sampling stations were evenly spaced around the lakeshore.  Each station was then sampled by backpack electrofishing, and if conditions allowed with a 15' or 50' 1/8th inch seine. <br> \n <br> \nThe survey took place the week of 7 July 2021 with all 10 stations sampled by backpack electrofishing.  The 50 foot seine was used at 7 stations and the 15 foot seine was used at an additional 3 stations. This nearshore survey was used along with the gill net survey conducted in 2020 and trap net survey conducted in 2021 to calculate a Fish-Based Index of Biotic Integrity (FIBI) score.  The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health by the types of fish species present and comparing it to what is expected for this type of lake. Rays Lake was evaluated using Tool 7 and scored 48 which was above the threshold for impairment of 36. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Rays (Charles) Lake is a 156.3-acre lake located in Le Sueur County north of the town of Elysian. A public access is located on the south side of the lake off 1st Street North, which goes north from Elysian. Rays Lake has a maximum depth of 32.0 feet. Eurasian watermilfoil is present in Rays Lake. Boaters should be sure to remove all aquatic vegetation from boats, trailers, and equipment and drain all water from livewell, transoms, and bilges when leaving the lake to prevent the spread of Eurasian watermilfoil to other lakes. Rays Lake is primarily managed for Bluegill, Black Crappie, and Largemouth Bass and secondarily managed for Northern Pike. Fish are only stocked in Rays Lake in the event of a winterkill. The last stocking event on record took place in 1980. <br> \n <br> \nGill nets and boat electrofishing were completed during the regularly scheduled survey in 2020 but trap nets were postponed until 2021 due to COVID protocols. The 2021 targeted survey was completed the week of 26 July 2021 using 9 trap nets. A targeted survey is generally used for sampling a specific kind of fish or time of year (i.e., spawning season, fall season, etc.) unlike a standard survey which samples a wider range of fish species during the summer months using standard methods (i.e., standard time of year, set sampling stations, taking water clarity readings and oxygen/temperature profiles, etc.) and gears (i.e., lake survey gillnets, trap nets, and spring electrofishing for Largemouth Bass). Results from this targeted survey should not be compared to results from standard surveys. <br> \n <br> \nA total of 311 Bluegills were sampled for a catch rate of 34.6/net, indicating moderate to high numbers were present.  Bluegills ranged from 3.2 to 8.2 inches with an average of 5.5 inches. Size structure was poor with few fish over 7 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nA total of 346 Black Crappie were sampled with trap nets for a catch rate of 38.4/net. Black Crappie ranged from 0.75 to 11.3 inches and averaged 7.0 inches. Black Crappie size structure was poor but fish over 10 inches were sampled. <br> \n <br> \nOther game fish sampled in low numbers in 2021 include Walleye, Northern Pike, and Yellow Perch. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers can play an important role in maintaining or improving a fish population by practicing selective harvest. Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for consumption, while encouraging the release of medium to large fish that may contribute to natural reproduction. This practice helps maintain balance in the fish populations and provides anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future. Additionally, smaller fish often taste better and have fewer contaminants than larger, older fish from the same water body. <br> \n <br> \nShoreline property owners also play an important role in the overall health of an aquatic ecosystem, including the fish population. Natural shorelines, including vegetation, woody debris, and bottom substrates, provide valuable habitat for fish and wildlife, help maintain water quality, and reduce bank erosion. Cattails and bulrushes are particularly beneficial for fish spawning, rearing, and feeding. By leaving natural shorelines unaltered or restoring them to natural conditions, shoreline property owners are doing their part to maintain or improve a healthy ecosystem in the lake and protect the resource for future generations. <br> \n <br> \n- Tyler Fellows, Fisheries Specialist <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Rays Lake is a small (156 acre) lake located north of the City of Elysian in southern Le Sueur County.  A fishery survey was conducted on Rays Lake in 2003 to assess the fish community and aquatic habitat.  Bluegill abundance has been stable at a moderate level in Rays Lake.  In Rays Lake most bluegill were around 4 to 6 inches, the largest were around 7 inches.  Black crappie have always been present in low to moderate numbers.  Most black crappie were around 8 inches with a few fish up to 10.5 inches.  Moderately high numbers of northern pike are present.  Most northern pike were between 18 and 24 inches with a few fish up to 27 inches.  Black bullhead are common, most are around 9 inches, while yellow bullhead are less common but larger with most between 9 and 12 inches in size.  Rays Lake has an excellent largemouth bass population that can provide quality angling.  Largemouth bass are not readily captured in the survey nets so their abundance is not indicated in the net catches.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Rays (Charles) Lake is a 156-acre lake located in Le Sueur County north of the town of Elysian. A public access is located on the south side of the lake off 1st Street North, which goes north from Elysian. Rays Lake has a maximum depth of 32.0 feet. Eurasian watermilfoil is present in Rays Lake. Boaters should be sure to remove all aquatic vegetation from boats, trailers, and equipment and drain all water from livewells, transoms, and bilges when leaving the lake to prevent the spread of Eurasian watermilfoil to other lakes. Rays Lake is primarily managed for Bluegill, Black Crappie, and Largemouth Bass and secondarily managed for Northern Pike. Fish are only stocked in Rays Lake in the event of a winterkill. The last stocking event on record took place in 1980.  <br> \n <br> \nA targeted survey was conducted the week of July 13, 2020 as part of a regular monitoring program conducted by Minnesota DNR. Due to the Covid-19 Pandemic social distancing protocols, only gill nets were used for this survey. This survey was intended to assess the fish community by deploying six gill nets, as well as recording water quality parameters. Results from this survey can be compared to historical standard surveys since standardized methods were used. <br> \n <br> \nGill nets do not typically sample Bluegill effectively and for that reason 2020 gill net survey data is left out of this section. The 2014 Bluegill trap net catch rate was 24.7 fish/net, which falls below the lake average of 63.0 fish/net. The length of Bluegill collected in trap nets ranged in length from 2.6 to 8.0 inches and averaged 5.7 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nAfter a record low abundance in 2014 (4.0 fish/gill net), Black Crappie catch rates increased to 23.3 fish/gillnet, above the long term lake average of 20.9 fish/gill net. Along with the high abundance of Black Crappie typically comes small size. In 2020, 22% of all Black Crappie measured 8.0 inches or longer. Black Crappie lengths averaged 7.0 inches and the largest individual was 11.9 inches.  <br> \nLargemouth Bass were not effectively collected in the sampling gears used in this survey. As a result, only six bass were sampled (1.0 fish/net). Largemouth Bass averaged 11.9 inches and ranged from 10.6 to 12.9 inches in length. Anecdotal reports from shore anglers indicate quality Largemouth Bass angling in Rays Lake, with some larger individuals being caught. Given abundant aquatic vegetation and prey fish available, Rays Lake has the potential to be a high quality Largemouth Bass lake.  <br> \n <br> \nThe 2020 Northern Pike catch rate of 4.0 fish/gill net fell slightly below the long-term lake average of 4.7 fish/gill net. Northern Pike lengths ranged from 18.9 to 27.1 inches and averaged 22.4 inches. Nearly 30 percent of Northern Pike sampled were over the 24 inch minimum size regulation. Seventy percent of the aged Northern Pike were age-3 or younger. Northern Pike are not stocked into Rays Lake, so the population is sustained through natural reproduction. In the event of a severe winterkill, Northern Pike and other game species would be stocked to initiate the population. Rays Lake is located in the Southern Northern Pike management zone. In order to harvest a Northern Pike the fish must be over 24.0 inches in length.  The daily bag limit in this zone is 2 Northern Pike per day. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance in Rays Lake has remained low throughout the survey history. The catch rate in 2020 was 0.2 fish/gill net (1 total Walleye). The Walleye sampled during this survey was large, measuring 19.4 inches. Walleye sustain relatively slow growth in Rays Lake compared to other lakes in southern Minnesota. The Walleye was age-6. As Walleye are not stocked in Rays Lake, it is believed they migrate from Lake Frances in high water years. <br> \n <br> \nA total of 16 Black Bullheads were sampling in 2020. Lengths of Black Bullheads ranged from 9.1 to 12.0 inches and averaged 11.8 inches. Other fish species collected in low abundance included Common Carp, Bowfin, Freshwater Drum, Yellow Perch, Yellow Bullhead, and Golden Shiner. <br> \n <br> \nWater quality parameter measurements included secchi depth, water temperature, and dissolved oxygen readings. At the time of this survey secchi depth was 3.0 feet, which is typical of Lake Class 38. Water temperatures and dissolved oxygen readings throughout the water column ranged from 80.2 degrees Fahrenheit and 7.4 ppm at the surface to 57.2 degrees Fahrenheit and 0.0 ppm at 28.0 feet. <br> \nAnglers can play an important role in maintaining or improving a fish population by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for consumption, while encouraging the release of medium to large fish that may contribute to natural recruitment.  This practice helps maintain balance in the fish community and provides anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future.  Additionally, smaller fish often taste better and have fewer contaminants than larger, older fish from the same water body. <br> \n <br> \nRays Lake has an infested waters designation as Eurasian Watermilfoil has become established. It is important for all who use this waterbody to remember Clean In and Clean Out. CLEAN all visible aquatic plants, zebra mussels, and other prohibited invasive species from watercraft, trailers, and water-related equipment before leaving and entering any water access or shoreland. DRAIN water-related equipment (boat, ballast tanks, portable bait containers, motor) and drain bilge, livewell and baitwell by removing drain plugs before leaving a water access or shoreline property. Keep drain plugs out and water-draining devices open while transporting watercraft. DISPOSE of unwanted bait, including minnows, leeches, and worms, in the trash. It is illegal to release bait into a waterbody or release aquatic animals from one waterbody to another. If you want to keep your bait, you must refill the bait container with bottled or tap water. <br> \n <br> \nShoreline property owners also play an important role in the overall health of an aquatic ecosystem, including the fish population.  Natural shorelines, including vegetation, woody debris, and bottom substrates, provide valuable habitat for fish and wildlife, help maintain water quality, and reduce bank erosion.  By leaving natural shorelines unaltered or restoring them to natural conditions, shoreline property owners are doing their part to maintain or improve a healthy ecosystem in the lake and protect the resource for future generations. <br> \n-Tyler Fellows, fisheries specialist <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Rays (Charles) Lake in LeSueur County is a 156 acre lake located on the north side of the city of Elysian. A public access is located on the south side of the lake, off Le Sueur County Road 11. Eurasian watermilfoil was found in the lake in 2008. Boaters should be sure to remove all aquatic vegetation from boats, trailers, and equipment and drain all water from livewells, transoms, and bilges when leaving German lake to prevent the spread of Eurasian watermilfoil to other lakes. <br> \n <br> \nRays Lake was surveyed the week of July 13th, 2009 to monitor the fish community. A strong bass-panfish community is in place. Bluegills were overly abundant in trapnets at 83 fish per net. Size was poor with less than one percent of fish exceeding seven inches.  <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappies, like bluegill, were overly abundant at 48 fish per gill net. Size was poor; three percent of all black crappie caught in the assessment exceeded 8 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass are not well sampled by passive gears (trap and gill nets). Bass are better sampled with electrofishing and will be sampled with this method during the next scheduled full lake resurvey. Rays Lake has been a popular largemouth bass angling destination. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike abundance has noticeable dropped from the 2003 assessment of 9.6 fish per gill net to the 2009 value of 1.8. Pike size ranged from 23 to 29 inches. Walleye maintain a trace level of abundance in Rays lake; 2 walleye were caught in 2009.  <br> \n <br> \nBlack bullhead abundance has dropped from 2003 levels of 101 fish per gill net to 19 fish per gill net. Average size is similar to 2003 at around a half a pound per fish. Other fish observed in the survey include common carp, hybrid sunfish, white bass, yellow bullhead, bowfin (dogfish), golden shiner, pumpkinseed sunfish, and yellow perch. <br> \n <br> \nA point-intercept or grid sampling survey of aquatic plants was conducted in July 2009 according to the methodology of Perleberg 2006. This survey was conducted to quantify aquatic plant distribution as Eurasian Watermilfoil was recently discovered in the lake. Figure 1 shows 420 potential sampling point locations, 40 meter grid spacing, in relation to water depth contours. Figure 2 shows 96 points taht fell in the vegetated zone found to be in 5 feet of water or less and the number of rooted plant species found at these locations. Ray's aquatic community is only moderately diverse with 17 species or groups identified (Table 1). The distribution of rooted plants found at over 10% of vegetated zone sites are shown in Figures 3-11. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers can help maintain or improve the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest. Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for table fare, but encourages release of medium- to large-sized fish. Releasing these fish can help maintain balance in the fish community in Rays Lake and provide anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future.  <br> \n <br> \nShoreline areas on the land and into the shallow water provide essential habitat for fish and wildlife that live in or near Minnesota s lakes. Overdeveloped shorelines cannot support the fish, wildlife, and clean water that are associated with natural undeveloped lakes. Shoreline habitat consists of aquatic plants, woody plants, and natural lake bottom soils.  <br> \n <br> \nPlants in the water and at the water's edge provide habitat, prevent erosion, and absorb excess nutrients. Shrubs, trees, and woody debris such as fallen trees or limbs provide good habitat both above and below the water and should be left in place. By leaving a buffer strip of natural vegetation along the shoreline, property owners can reduce erosion, help maintain water quality, and provide habitat and travel corridors for wildlife. <br> \n <br> \nReference: Perleberg, D. 2006.
