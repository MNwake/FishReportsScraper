                "narrative": "<p>Quarry Lake (DOW 70-0343-00) is a 70-acre, Class 20 Lake with a maximum depth of 40 feet. It is located in the recently completed Quarry Lake Park off of Innovation Drive in the city of Shakopee. Lake access is managed by the City of Shakopee and was, as of February 2017, limited to walking trails at the north end of the lake. <br> \n <br> \nQuarry Lake has just begun being managed as a trout fishery (although Trout Lake Designation has not occurred as of early 2017), with 15,000 (1/3-pound average size) Rainbow Trout stocked before the January 2017 Winter Season.  January 2017 was the first time fishing access to Quarry Lake had been opened to the public.  Regular planned management will consist of 1,000 yearling Rainbow Trout stocked in mid-late October (once water temperatures are favorably cool, typically around October 15-21) for the remainder of the Open-Water Season and 14,000 yearling Rainbow Trout in advance of the Winter Opener.  Average size of the trout are expected to be about 1/4-2/5 lb each, but will vary depending on hatchery conditions and time of stocking. <br> \n <br> \nAlso, as of early 2017, policies, rules, and amenities for Quarry Lake fishing, particularly during open water, have not been finalized.  Those with questions/concerns related to park operation and lake use should contact the City of Shakopee. <br> \n <br> \nA standard survey (6 trap nets/4 gill nets) was conducted on Quarry Lake during the week of 7/11/2016 to monitor water quality and fish populations. Quarry Lake is considered mesotrophic, with good water clarity. In addition, adequate oxygen (3.7 parts per million) was recorded at a depth of 40 feet. Eurasian Watermilfoil was discovered in Quarry Lake for the first time in 2016. <br> \n <br> \nQuarry Lake had been surveyed only once before (2004). At that time, the fish community was almost entirely composed of Yellow Perch, with low numbers of Common Carp and Black Bullheads. New species were recorded during the 2016 survey which included Bluegill, Pumpkinseed, and Northern Pike, although they were all sampled in very low numbers. The biggest change in 2016 was the sampling of Green Sunfish (average length = 4.4 inches) which made up 62% of the total catch (gill nets and trap nets). Prior to trout stocking, Yellow Perch provided the only viable angling opportunity in Quarry Lake. Of the 68 Yellow Perch measured (17/net), fish averaged 6.7 inches, despite taking 4 years to reach that size, indicating slow growth. Growth was also slow at larger sizes, with the largest fish sampled being a 9-year-old 11-inch Yellow Perch. Slow growth usually coincides with poor body condition, as was the case in 2016 Yellow Perch, where body condition values were substantially lower than 2004. With poor condition and slow growth, Yellow Perch fishing may be limited. Future management will focus on sustaining the urban trout fishery. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Quarry Lake is 70-acres (12 littoral acres) with a maximum depth of 50 feet. Quarry is located off of Innovation Drive, east of Shakopee in northern Scott County. Public water access is provided by the City of Shakopee and subject to their park hours, rules, and City Code. Quarry is primarily managed as a put-and-take fishery for Rainbow Trout, Brook Trout, and Brown Trout. Quarry is a designated trout lake, as such has special rules and regulations that include but are not limited to: <br> \n?\tFishing hours from one hour before sunrise to 11 p.m. <br> \n?\tOnly one line is allowed. <br> \n?\tPossessing live minnows or using them for bait is prohibited. <br> \n?\tTaking of any species, including catch-and-release angling, is prohibited outside of an open season for trout. <br> \n <br> \nA Standard Survey (6 trap nets/4 gill nets) was conducted on Quarry Lake during the week of 6/2/2021 to assess the fishery. During the 2021 survey, Quarry's water clarity was very good with clear water and a secchi reading of 16 feet measured. Dissolved oxygen was 3.8 parts per million (ppm) at a depth of 40 feet during the survey period. Eurasian Watermilfoil has been found in Quarry Lake and remains present. <br> \n <br> \nStandard survey trapnets and gillnets are not designed to adequately sample trout, however incidental capture netted 3 Rainbow Trout, with an average length of 15.6 inches and the largest measured at 21.3 inches. Despite the small sample, trout captured during the summer survey appeared in good condition and provided evidence these fish are capable of surviving past the winter ice fishing season. <br> \n <br> \nDespite the Trout Lake designation, a large population of panfish are present in Quarry Lake. Green Sunfish (65.0/net), Pumpkinseed (55.8/net), and their hybrids (72.2/net) were all sampled with trap nets at high numbers. High numbers of panfish competing for limited littoral habitat and food resources has likely led to reduced sizes with the two previously mentioned species and their hybrids all averaging less than 4.6 inches. High numbers of Yellow Perch were also sampled (67.3/net), they averaged 6.4 inches, with the largest measured at 7.1 inches. Other fish species sampled in low abundances were Black Bullhead, Common Carp, Largemouth Bass, and White Sucker. <br> \n</p>",
