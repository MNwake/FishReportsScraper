                "narrative": "<p>Lobster Lake supports a diverse and abundant aquatic plant community which provides quality habitat forthe fish community.  Submergent vegetation grows to a depth of 17 feet and is abundant in most shallowareas.  Emergent vegetation is less abundant but still common in shallow, protected bays.  Lobster Lakehas experienced rapid shoreline development over the past twenty years.  The number of lakeshore homesincreased from 65 in 1979 to 161 in 1996.Northern pike catches averaged 7.7 fish/gillnet, similar to the catch rate of 6.2 fish/gillnet recordedin 1989. Gillnet catches have ranged from 4.6 to 16.3 fish/net in previous surveys.  The normal rangeof mean catch rates from lakes with similar chemical and physical characteristics is 3.1 - 8.5fish/gillnet.  Mean weight of fish captured was 1.7 pounds.  Largemouth bass are abundant. Electrofishing yielded 88.3 fish per hour.  Approximately one-half of the catchable size fish were 12inches in length or greater and 8% exceeded 15 inches.  Walleye catches averaged 3.2 fish/gillnet whichis within the normal range of mean catch rates from similar lakes (1.3 - 5.5 fish/gillnet).  Gillnetcatches averaged 4.6 fish/net in 1989 and 5.5 fish/net in 1986.  Gillnet catches averaged 2.6 fish/netin 1983, prior to the reestablishment of walleye stocking in 1984.  Walleye were stocked as early as1945, however stocking was discontinued in 1954.  Mean weight of fish captured in 1996 was 1.7 pounds.Approximately 60%, of the fish exceeded 15 inches in length and 17% exceeded 20 inches.  Bluegillcatches averaged 28.8 fish/trapnet, similar to the catch rate of 27.5 fish/trapnet recorded in 1989. Trapnet catches have ranged from 27.5 to 80.7 fish/net in previous surveys.  The expected range of meancatch rates from similar lakes is 5.6- 42.3 fish/trapnet.  Mean weight of fish captured was 0.2 pounds. About 40% of the fish captured were 6 inches or greater.  Yellow perch catches averaged 2.4fish/gillnet.  Gillnet catches have been low in previous surveys, ranging from 0.2 to 4.4 fish/net. The normal range is 2.5 - 24.2 fish/gillnet.  Mean weight of fish captured was 0.1 pounds.  Most of thefish captured were between 5 and 8 inches in length.  Black crappie are not effectively sampled withstandard survey gear during summer months.  Trapnet catches averaged 0.7 fish/net and gillnet catchesaveraged 1.8 fish/net.  Fish ranged from 4.3 to 9.6 inches in total length.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lobster Lake is a 1300-acre, natural lake located about 5 miles west of Alexandria.  The lake has a maximum depth of 65 feet and mean depth of 15.0 feet.  The unique lobster shaped basin shape gives the lake 17.3 miles of shoreline with many points, arms, and bays providing lots of high quality fish habitat.  Water quality and clarity are good.  Average summer water transparency measurements are near 10.0 ft.  Submergent and emergent vegetation is common along much of the shoreline, particularly in shallow bays.  Habitat attributes and the many miles of shoreline make Lobster Lake a productive and popular destination lake for fishing.   A single public access is located on the very southwestern end of the lake.  Mainstays of the fishery are largemouth bass, black crappie, bluegill, and northern pike.  Walleye and muskellunge are stocked to satisfy popular demand and provide unique opportunities to experience muskie fishing outside of their reproducing range.   Lobster Lake can provide trophy fishing experiences, but in general terms it\u0019s a great family fishing lake on which anglers can expected above average catch rates of largemouth bass and panfishes. <br> \n <br> \nMuskellunge were first stocked in 1981.  Following up stockings, maturity of the population, and harvest management has yielded a high quality fishery.   A population assessment completed in early spring of 2009 was successful in capturing 98, 20.0-inch and larger muskie.  Lengths at capture ranged from 29.3 \u0013 53.5 inches.  Mean length was 42.1 inches.  Anglers targeting muskellunge have reported good success and these large fish see lots of lures, especially on weekends.   Northern pike are fairly abundant.  Size distribution of the pike catch was also good.   Twenty-four percent of 14.0 inch and larger pike captured exceeded 28.0 inches in length. <br> \n <br> \nWalleyes have been stocked for over 30 years.  Stockings do contribute to population abundance, but survey catch rates have yet to meet management objectives.   The grand mean catch rate among surveys is 3.3 walleye/gillnet.  Walleye can\u0019t be described as abundant, but fishing quality in terms of average size, is good.  Sizes of walleye caught in 2009 ranged from 7.2 \u0013 26.7 inches.  Average length of captured walleye was 14.4 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nLobster Lake supports a popular largemouth bass fishery.   Anglers can anticipate high catch rates of small- to medium-size bass from 10.0 \u0013 15.0 inches in length.   Few 18.0 inch and larger bass have been recorded in survey catches.   <br> \n <br> \nOther members of the sunfish family are also abundant.  Bluegill catches approached 40.0 fish/trapnet.  Due to high abundance, bluegills don\u0019t grow very fast and few exceed 8.0 inches.  Average size caught was 5.6 inches.  Anglers are strongly encouraged to take advantage of the surplus of bluegill and harvest rather than release medium-size fish.  The black crappie catch rate of only 0.4 fish/trapnet and average size of 6.9 inches are misrepresentations of actual abundance and size.  Larger crappie occupy deeper water in late-July and are not very vulnerable to capture with trapnets set along shore.  A special population assessment conducted in the spring yielded much greater catches.  Captures were mostly adult fish with a size distribution extended out to 13.0 inches. <br> \n   <br> \n</p>",

Fish were sampled using both large frame trap nets and electrofishing in 2022. In spring of 2023, fish were recaptured using exclusively electrofishing. A total of 83 individual fish were PIT tagged between the two years. Lengths ranged from 10.8 to 51.2 inches; average length was 40.3 inches. The population estimate was 193 adult (30 inches or greater) Muskies. This equates to an adult Muskie for every 6.9 surface acres (or 3.6 littoral acres).  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lobster Lake, located west of Alexandria, is a moderately developed lake which receives heavy recreational use during the summer months.  Good water quality remains throughout the summer with a mid-summer secchi reading of 8.5 feet.  Lobster Lake supports an abundant and diverse aquatic plant community.  These aquatic plants provide critical fish habitat and compete with nuisance algae for the available nutrients in the lake. Northern pike catch rates averaged 11.3 fish per gillnet.  A catch rate of 7.7 fish per gillnet was recorded in 1996.  Mean weight of these fish was just under 2.0 pounds.  One-third of the sampled fish exceeded 21.0 inches with the largest fish measuring just under 33.0 inches.Bluegill catch rates averaged 8.7 fish per trapnet.  The 1996 catch rates averaged 28.8 fish per trapnet.  Size structure is not favorable.  Only 23 percent of the sampled fish exceeded six inches and no fish measured more than eight inches.  These fish continue to grow slowly.Walleye catches averaged 2.0 fish per gillnet as compared to 3.2 and 4.6 fish per gillnet in the 1996 and 1989 surveys, respectively.  The normal range of mean catch rates from lakes with similar physical and chemical characteristics is 3.1 to 8.5 fish per gillnet.  Mean weight of sampled fish was 2.2 pounds.  Over 83% of the sampled fish exceeded 15 inches in length and 33% exceeded 20 inches.  The mean length of the sampled fish was 18.4 inches with the largest fish measuring over 24 inches.Largemouth bass remain abundant with a spring electrofishing survey resulting in a catch of 62.4 fish per hour.  The mean length of the sampled fish was 10.8 inches.  Over 40% of the fish exceeded 12 inches with 8% exceeding 15 inches in length.    Black crappie are not sampled effectively during the summer.  However,  gillnet catches averaged 5.6 fish per net which is relatively high.  The mean weight of these fish was 0.4 pounds.  The mean length of the sampled fish was 8.4 inches with the largest measuring just under 11 inches.A spring ice-out muskellunge survey was conducted in 2001.  This survey resulted in the capture of 53 fish for a catch rate of 0.77 fish per trapnet.  Over 41% of the sampled fish exceeded 40 inches in length with the largest fish measuring 51.5 inches.Lobster Lake can be a good choice for late season duck hunters.  The abundance of cattail cover and good historical use by late season birds can make for an exciting combination.  </p>",

Fish were sampled using both large frame trap nets and electrofishing in 2022. Repeated inclement weather in the spring appeared to limit the time fish were near shore and vulnerable to capture. Only 11 Muskies were captured in large frame trap nets, with an additional 43 sampled during electrofishing. A total of 54 Muskies were PIT tagged ranging in length from 19 to 51 inches; average length was 42 inches. The recapture phase will begin in spring of 2023 using exclusively electrofishing.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lobster Lake, located west of Alexandria, is a moderately developed lake which receives heavy recreational usage during summer months.  Good water quality remains throughout the summer with a mid-summer secchi reading of 7.0 feet.  Lobster Lake supports an abundant and diverse aquatic plant community.  These aquatic plants provide critical fish habitat and compete with nuisance algae for the available nutrients in the lake.Northern pike catch rates averaged 2.9 fish/gillnet.  Mean weight of these fish was 2.7 pounds.  A catch rate of 11.3 fish/gillnet was recorded in 2001.    Three-fourths of the sampled fish exceeded 21.0 inches with the largest fish measuring 30.5 inches.Bluegill catch rates averaged 19.8 fish/trapnet.  Catch rates in 2001 averaged 8.7 fish/trapnet.  Size structure is not favorable.  Only 44% of sampled fish exceeded six inches and no fish measured more than eight inches.  These fish continue to grow slowly with age-5 fish averaging 5.0 inches in length.Walleye catches averaged 3.2 fish/gillnet as compared to 2.0 and 3.2 fish/gillnet in the 2001 and 1996 surveys, respectively.  The normal range of mean catch rates from lakes with similar physical and chemical characteristics is 3.1 to 8.5 fish/gillnet.  Mean weight of sampled fish was 1.7 pounds.  Over 43% of sampled fish exceeded 15.0 inches in length and 11% exceeded 25 inches.  The mean length of sampled fish was 15.6 inches with the largest fish measuring 29.0 inches.Largemouth bass remain abundant with a spring electrofishing survey resulting in a catch of 155.0 fish per hour.  The mean length of sampled fish was 11.0 inches.  Over 38% of sampled fish exceeded 12.0 inches with 5% exceeding 15.0 inches in length.  The largest fish measured 16.3 inches.Black crappie are not sampled effectively during the summer.  However, gillnet catches averaged 7.2 fish/net, which is relatively high.  Mean weight of sampled fish was 0.3 pounds.  Mean length of sampled fish was 8.3 inches with the largest measuring 11.3 inches.A spring ice-out muskellunge survey was conducted in 2005.  This survey resulted in the capture of 67 fish for a catch rate of 1.1 fish/trapnet.  Over 58% of sampled fish exceeded 40.0 inches in length.  Three fish exceeded 50.0 inches.  Mean length of sampled fish was 40.8 inches.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lobster Lake is a 1,329-acre natural basin located five miles west of Alexandria.  The lake has a maximum depth of 65.0 feet and an average depth of 15.0 feet.  The unique lobster-shaped basin has a shoreline length of 17.3 miles.  Lobster Lake is a moderately fertile basin.  Water quality and clarity are good.  Summer water transparency measurements average 9.1 feet.  The lake becomes thermally stratified during summer months.  Depth to the thermocline was approximately 15.0 feet at time of the July 22 survey.  Dissolved oxygen concentrations below 18.0 feet were too low to support game fish.   <br> \n <br> \nThe many points, arms, bays, and islands add complexity to basin morphology and provide diverse, high-quality fish habitat.  Submergent and emergent vegetation is common along much of the shoreline, particularly in shallow bays.  Habitat attributes and the many miles of shoreline make Lobster Lake a productive and popular fishing destination. <br> \n <br> \nLobster Lake is one of the three lakes within the Glenwood Fisheries Management Area supporting a muskellunge fishery.  Fingerlings are stocked in even-numbered years to compensate for annual mortality and sustain a low-density population of large, prized game fish.  Ice-out netting in May resulted in the capture of 109 muskellunge.  Size of captures varied from 20.7 to 52.0 inches and averagde 41.5 inches.  Size structure will likely improve in the near future as a large proportion (36%) of sampled fish measured between 39.4 and 41.3 inches. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike catches averaged 5.9 fish/gillnet which describes near-average population density for similar lakes.  Length of captures varied from 15.0 to 31.6 inches.  Pike greater than 30.0 inches are rare in Lobster Lake.  Mean length and weight of captures was 21.6 inches and 2.2 pounds.   <br> \n <br> \nLobster Lake supports a popular largemouth bass fishery.  Largemouth bass are abundant, but don't grow very rapidly.  Due to poor growth, fishing quality in terms of size of the catch is only fair.  Average length of sampled fish was 10.6 inches in length.  Only 7% of all sampled bass exceeded 15.0 inches.  Anglers are encouraged to harvest the overabundance of small- to medium-sized bass to improve overall growth rates.  Smallmouth bass was sampled first sampled in Lobster Lake in 2013. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye catches in gillnets averaged 5.4 fish/gillnet.  The 2013 catch rate exceeded catch rates from the five preceding surveys.  A moderate increase in population density is partially related to near-annual stockings since 2000.   Sizes of captures varied from 9.1 to 27.0 inches.  Average length and weight of captured walleyes was 14.0 inches and 1.1 pounds.  Similar to largemouth bass and northern pike, walleyes grow slowly.  The oldest walleyes caught were 11 years old.  These three capptures averaged only 21.9 inches in total length. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill catch rates have been inconsistent and may be related to irregular annual recruitment of young fish into the population.  Average trapnet catch rates (20.0 bluegill/net) during the 2013 survey were within the range of expected catches rates for similar lakes.  Bluegills don't grow fast.  Age distribution of the population sample extended to age 11, but none of the captures exceeded 8.0 inches in length.  Average size of sampled bluegills was 6.3 inches.  Anglers can take advantage of a surplus of medium-sized bluegills.  <br> \n  <br> \nBlack crappie catches averaged 1.6 fish/trapnet.  This modest catch rate is considered an under-estimate of actual abundance.  Many adult crappies had moved offshore into deeper, cooler water by time of the mid-July survey.  The largest crappie measured was 10.6 inches in length. <br> \n   <br> \nNotes: <br> \nThe east end of Lobster Lake is approximately five miles west of Alexandria.  A single public access site is located on the very southwestern end of the lake or approximately 10 miles from Alexandria. <br> \n <br> \nLobster Lake was designated as Muskellunge Waters in 1972.  Northern pike spearing was soon prohibited to minimize potential misidentification and spearing mortality of young muskellunge.  The winter spearing restriction was repealed and lifted December 2013. <br> \n</p>",

A population estimate using multiple mark recapture data yielded a population estimate of 315 for all Muskies in the lake. It is estimated that 39% of these fish are legal size. Age determinations from scales sampled show individuals present from all stockings recorded in the last 10 years. 1980 year class Muskies sampled during the spring trapnetting represent adults and/or yearlings stocked in 1981. No Muskies were stocked in 1980. Northern Pike abundance, as measured by gillnet indices, was down from 16.25 in 1983 to 4.58 in 1986. Gillnet indices for Walleyes were up from 2.58 in 1983 to 5.50 in 1986. The majority of the Walleyes sampled were 2+ age fish. This large year corresponds with a 1984 fingerlings stocking.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A Muskellunge assessment was conducted on Lobster Lake in the spring of 1989. The Muskie population was estimated at 600 adult fish. Eighty-four percent of the Muskies ages came from the 1983 and 1984 year class. Age 5 Muskies averaged 33.04 inches and age 6 Muskies averaged 35.03 inches. The Muskie PSD was 99.0 percent, but sampling efforts are biased towards adult fish. One fish from the 1988 year class was captured. Two of the Muskies measured over 40 inches long. Shoepack strain Muskies were last stocked in 1981. Walleye were stocked in Lobster in the early 1950's; however, no stocking occurred in the 60's, 70's and early 80's. The Walleye netted during the 1983 survey were the result of natural reproduction or movement run from Mill or Mina Lakes. Walleye fingerlings were stocked in 1984, 1985, 1986, 1987, and 1989. Walleye gillnet catches have increased from 2.58 fish/gillnet in 1983 to 5.50 and 4.58 fish/gillnet in 1986 and 1989. Seventy percent of the Walleyes sampled were from the 1986 year class. These age 3 fish averaged 12.35 inches in total length. Northern Pike gillnet catches averaged 6.17 fish/ gillnet with a mean weight of 2.13 lbs and PSD of 46.0 percent. This is similar to the previous assessment in 1986. Northern Pike growth rates are relatively slow with age 3 fish averaging 18.72 inches and age 4 fish averaging 21.61 inches. Two of the Northern Pike captured exceeded 30 inches in length. Bluegills net catches decreased to 27.53 fish/trapnet. Mean size was small with a mean weight of 0.12 lbs. Size distribution has remained fairly consistent during the last five assessments, calculated PSD values have ranged from 20.0 to 36.0 percent. Age 3 Bluegills averaged 3.56 in. The 1983 year class is a strong year class. These fish are large enough to contribute to the angler creel. Many Largemouth Bass were captured during the spring Muskie assessment. Length frequency distribution indicates a good population with all sizes present. Age 4 Largemouth Bass were 12.80 inches long. Yellow Perch CPUE values have increased from 0.0 fish/gillnet in 1973 to 4.42 fish/gillnet in 1989. Despite the increase in relative abundance, PSD has remained at 0.0 percent over the five assessments. No Tullibee were captured during the 1989 assessment. Insufficient numbers of Black Crappies were captured to adequately assess this population; how-ever, net catches and angling observation would suggest a good population. The bullhead species are large enough to have angling and commercial value</p>",

Ten large-frame trap nets (5 x 6 feet) were deployed at established sampling stations over the ten-day sampling period for a total netting effort of 100 overnight sets.  Surface water temperature at initiation of the survey varied from 49 to 51 degrees Fahrenheit, dependent upon location.  Contrary to expectations, water temperatures failed to warm during the 10-day survey period.  Water temperature cooled to 45 degrees Fahrenheit by day 6 with passage of a cold front. <br> \n <br> \nForty-two stock-size Muskellunge were captured, which yielded at catch rate of 0.42 fish/large frame trap net.  Catch rates during the three preceding surveys where much higher at approximately 1.0 fish/large frame trap net.  Length of captures ranged from 32.9 to 52.0 inches.  Mean length was 42.6 inches.  Fifty percent of captures exceeded 42.0 inches in length.  Three trophy-size Muskellunge measuring 50.0 inches and larger were captured.</p>",

Backpack electrofishing and/or seining were conducted at 18 stations, representing a variety of habitat types, along the shoreline of Lobster Lake.  The survey was conducted during the five-year sampling window for intensive monitoring efforts within the Long Prairie River watershed, and will be contributing to a watershed assessment process in coordination with Minnesota Pollution Control Agency.\n\nTwenty species were collected during this survey.  Seven species (Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, Least Darter, Pugnose Shiner, and Smallmouth Bass) were considered \"intolerant\" and one species (Green Sunfish) was considered \"tolerant\" based on current tolerance classifications for Minnesota lakes. \n\nNearshore catch data will be used along with gill and trap net catch data to develop an Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) score, which is indicative of the health of Lobster Lake.</p>",

Tullibee numbers have dramatically increased since 1979 (0.5/set-10.3/set) in 1983. An index of (0.58 Muskie/gillnet set) would appear to be consistent with the increased Tullibee abundance. Relative abundance of Yellow Perch remains low, consistent with high Northern Pike abundance. A strong year class of Walleye is present from natural reproduction in 1980. The strength of this year class could add to the fishery.\t</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lobster Lake is a 1,308-acre lake located about four miles west of Alexandria.  The lake's irregular shape with many arms, bays, and islands has over 17 miles of shoreline and offers a rich diversity of fish habitat and fishing options.  The lake is 65.0 feet deep and has an estimated average depth of 15.0 feet.  Water quality measures describe a mesotrophic basin.  Water transparency measurements during summer months average 9.1 feet.  Total phosphorus and chlorophyll-a measurements have been steadily decreasing which indicates improving water quality. <br> \n <br> \nA standardized fish survey was completed in 2017 to assess integrity of the fish community and gain updated estimates of abundance and size structure of gamefish populations.  Standard survey methodology included a spring electrofishing survey completed June 2 to effectively sample the Largemouth Bass population.  The netting component of the survey was completed July 24-27.  Netting efforts included 12 gill net and 12 trap net sets.  The nets are positioned at established locations at as close to the same time of year to remove some possible survey bias associated with divergent habitat types and seasonal capture vulnerability.  Lobster Lake was thermally stratified in late-July, thus nets were set above 20.0 feet where there was sufficient dissolved oxygen to support fish. <br> \n <br> \nThe Largemouth Bass population continues to be moderately abundant.  Electrofishing catches averaged 49.0 bass/hour of effort.  Lengths at capture ranged from 2.8 inches to 17.3 inches.  Average length was 11.0 inches.  Bass growth is slow.  Some captures projected to be eight-years-old and older had not yet attained 15.0 inches in length.   Only two captures were 15.0 inches and larger. <br> \n   <br> \nBluegills are abundant.  Age assignments of captures extended from age 2 to age 10.  Similar to bass and crappies, Bluegill growth is too slow to optimize quality fishing potential.  Older captures approached or exceeded 8.0 inches in length at age 10.  Due to a broad age distribution, average length of captures in trap nets was 6.3 inches, but only one 8.0-inch capture was recorded in 2017. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie catches in gill nets were moderately elevated.  Relatively few were captured near-shore in trap nets during the late-July survey.  Age determinations extended out to age 8, which is old for this short-lived fish.  Enhanced reproduction and survival were evident in 2014 and 2015.  Average length of crappie captures in gill nets was 8.7 inches.  The largest crappie captured measured 11.1 inches, but based on their moderate rate of growth, relative few live long enough to exceed 10.0 inches. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike catches have progressively increased over the past four surveys.  Eighty-two pike were caught in gill nets.  Average length at capture was 20.4 inches.  The largest capture measured 31.4 inches.  Anglers are encouraged to take advantage of an expanded daily bag limit that will take effect with the 2018 fishing opener and increase harvest of smaller pike. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye catches decreased to average 2.8 fish/gill net.  This modest catch rate was disappointing given increased and collective fingerling and yearling stockings by the DNR and the Lobster Lake Association.  Most of the catch was comprised of younger Walleyes less than five-years-old.  Age determinations did extend to age 14, but missing year classes were evident in the age-frequency distribution even though supplemental stockings dating back to 2002 occurred on a near-annual schedule.  Such information would suggest that Walleyes experience a high rate of mortality.  Some loss of adult Walleye may occur during spawning movements.  Average length of Walleye captures was 15.5 inches.  The largest fish measured was 28.4 inches. <br> \n <br> \nLobster Lake supports one of three unique fishing opportunities within the Glenwood Fish Management Area.  Muskellunge have been stocked since 1968 to expand fishing opportunities around the state and spread fishing pressure directed at this large, popular gamefish.  Two Muskellunge were captured in gill nets during the summer survey.  One measured 39.2 inches.  The second was 42.5 inches in length.  An early spring survey was completed in April 2017 to more effectively sample this population.  Forty-two Muskellunge were captured.   Average size of captures during this targeted survey was 42.6 inches.  Three trophy-size Muskellunge measuring 50.0 inches or larger were caught. <br> \n <br> \nOther fishes common to survey catches in Lobster Lake included Rock Bass, Pumpkinseed Sunfish, Bowfin, White Sucker, Common Carp, and Yellow and Brown Bullheads. <br> \n <br> \nA DNR public access is located on the southwest end of the lake off Douglas County Highway 27.  Anglers and recreational boaters must be aware that zebra mussels were confirmed to be present in Lobster Lake in 2016.  Please do your part to prevent spread of aquatic invasive species among lakes. <br> \n <br> \n* Clean all aquatic plants, zebra mussels, and other invasives from boats, trailers, and water-related equipment <br> \n <br> \n* Drain water from your boat, ballast tanks, motor, live well and bait containers.  Remove drain plugs and keep drain plugs out while transporting equipment <br> \n <br> \n* Dispose of unwanted bait in the trash.  If you wish to keep live bait, drain the water and refill the bait container with bottled or tap water <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lobster Lake is a 1,308 acre lake located about four miles west of Alexandria. The lake's irregular shape with many arms, bays, and islands has over 17 miles of shoreline and offers a rich diversity of fish habitat and fishing opportunities. The lake has a maximum depth of 65.0 feet and has an estimated average depth of 15.0 feet. Water quality measures describe a moderately productive basin. Water transparency measurements during summer months average around 8.5 feet, and have been increasing in recent years following the infestation of zebra mussels. \n\nA standardized fish survey was completed in 2021 to provide updated information on the fish community of Lobster Lake. Survey components included spring electrofishing to assess Largemouth Bass, trap nets to assess panfish and gill nets were utilized to assess the remainder of the fish community. Lobster Lake was thermally stratified in late July, thus nets were set above 19.0 feet where there was sufficient dissolved oxygen to support fish.\n\nLobster Lake continues to maintain high abundances of panfish and Largemouth Bass. Catch rates of Bluegill and Black Crappies are above average when compared to other lakes in the area. Growth rates are slow, but both species are long lived in Lobster Lake, with the oldest panfish exceeding 10 years of age.  While you are not likely to encounter really large panfish in this system, the high densities allow great angling opportunities for harvestable sized fish.  A large proportion of the Black Crappie sampled in the survey were from 9 to 10.5 inches and many Bluegill from 7 to 8 inches are also present.  Largemouth Bass were likely under sampled in the 2021 survey, but many moderate sized fish occur. Largemouth Bass up to 17.6 inches long and 17 years old were sampled. \n\nWalleye catch rates were above average for Lobster Lake in the 2021 survey.  A combination of fingerling, yearling, and adult Walleye are stocked by the DNR and the Lobster Lake Association. Walleye from 12 to 19 inches were common in the survey and should provide angling and harvest opportunities.  A number of larger Walleye from 23 to 27 inches were also observed.  Walleye growth rates are moderate and on average Walleye are 17.1 inches long by age 4.\n\nNorthern Pike catch rates were moderate for Lobster Lake and compared to other lakes in the area.  Despite moderate densities the size structure remains poor. Very few pike over 30 inches are observed in surveys. A majority of the pike caught in the 2021 survey were from 17 to 22 inches.\n\nYellow Perch abundance remains low and their sizes are less than desirable for angling.  Yellow Perch are an important prey species for the lake's predator population and catch rates of perch have been negatively correlated with Northern Pike catch rates.  Other fishes caught during the 2021 survey include Pumpkinseed, Rock Bass, Smallmouth Bass, multiple species of bullheads and one Muskellunge.  Typically very few musky are caught during the summer survey.  For additional information on the musky population, a targeted musky survey will be completed during the spring of 2022.\n\nLobster Lake was designated as infested and zebra mussels were confirmed in 2016.  Recreational users should take necessary precautions to prevent the further spread of invasive species. Drain all water and remove all aquatic vegetation from your boat and trailer when leaving any body of water.\n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of nearshore fish species in Lobster Lake was conducted on August 8-10, 2022, by Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program staff. Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake, and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at eighteen sampling stations, but six stations were sampled from the boat due to site conditions. Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample seven stations, a 15-foot seine was used at five stations, and site conditions prevented the use of seines at six stations. Nearshore sampling captured twenty-two species of fish including seven species that are intolerant of disturbance (i.e., Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, Least Darter, Pugnose Shiner, and Rock Bass) and one that is tolerant of disturbance (i.e., Green Sunfish). <br> \n <br> \nA concurrent summer trap net survey was also conducted by IBI Program staff. Twelve trap nets were set along the shoreline in locations that encompassed multiple habitat types. Trap net sampling captured thirteen species of fish, including two that are intolerant of disturbance (i.e., Rock Bass and Smallmouth Bass) and three that are tolerant of disturbance (i.e., Black Bullhead, Common Carp, and Green Sunfish). Bluegill comprised a majority of the catch by number and biomass. <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore and trap net data were combined with gill net data from a July 2021 survey to describe the fish community and provide a fish-based IBI (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment. In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g., Blackchin Shiner, Least Darter, and Rock Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g., Black Bullhead, Common Carp, and Green Sunfish). The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.  <br> \n <br> \nResults from this survey indicate that the fish community in Lobster Lake is healthy as indicated by an FIBI score above the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes. These results will be considered when the biological health of the lake is assessed during the Long Prairie River Watershed assessment process, which will be completed in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.</p>",
