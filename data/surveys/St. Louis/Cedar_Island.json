                "narrative": "<p>Cedar Island Lake is located approximately 2 miles S of Biwabik. One of several lakes connected by the Embarrass River, it is considered to be highly developed by local standards. Much of the lake has depths less than 6 feet and the water clarity is poor with dark, bog stained water. Water level fluctuations are common on this riverine lake. <br> \n <br> \nThere is no designated public access for Cedar Island Lake. There are only private properties and one camp located around the lake. <br> \n <br> \nThirteen species of fish were sampled during the 2018 survey. Northern pike comprised 31% of the gill net catch, while bluegill (46%) dominated the trap net catch. Walleye were sampled in relatively average numbers with both gear types. Several black crappie and one channel catfish were sampled in 2018. Largemouth bass were observed in northern pike stomach samples. Several rusty crayfish and one chinese mystery snail were also sampled in the nets. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike numbers in 2018 (6.8/gill net) were similar to the historic average for this lake (6.5/gill net) and above average (5.0/gill net) compared to other similar lakes in the area. The average pike sampled measured 18.5 inches which is larger than the historic average length of 16.9 inches. The largest pike sampled in 2018 was 34.7 inches long. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill abundance in 2018 (12.9/trap net) was higher than the historic average (7.8/trap net) and also above average (3.8/trap net) when compared to other area lakes that are similar. The average bluegill sampled was 6.9 inches long. Twenty-two percent of the bluegill sampled were 8 inches or larger with a  maximum length of 9.0 inches recorded. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye numbers in 2018 (2.8/gill net) were higher than the historic average (1.7/gill net) and similar to the average catch (2.6/gill net) when comparing other area lakes that are similar in nature. The average walleye sampled from the gill nets was 14.8 inches. Thirteen walleye of similar sizes were also sampled in the trap nets. The largest walleye sampled in 2018 was 28.6 inches long and 16 years old. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",
