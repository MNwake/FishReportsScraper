                "narrative": "<p>Trip Lake is a designated stream trout lake that has been managed for trout since 1993.  Brook trout were stocked annually in 1993 through 2006, with little success (catches ranged from zero to 1.0 fish/gill net set).  The 2005 lake management plan recommended switching to rainbow trout stocking, and established a goal for that species of at least 3.0 fish/gill net set in fall assessments.  This was to have been the second of two assessments scheduled in that plan to determine growth and survival of rainbow trout.  The first assessment (2011) was not completed due to a shortage of staff and funding. <br> \n <br> \nOnly two rainbow trout were taken in this assessment, and the catch failed to meet the management goal for the species in this lake.  Fish collected in 2014 were survivors of the 2012 and 2010 fingerling stockings.  They had experienced fairly fast growth, which may have been another indication that population density in this lake was low. <br> \n <br> \nFactors limiting survival of trout stocked in this lake are unknown.  Temperature-oxygen profiles measured in this lake during September assessments have consistently shown good conditions for stream trout.  Profiles measured in August 1992 and August 1972 also found conditions suitable for trout.   Winter dissolved oxygen levels were measured in 1972 and 1978, and were adequate.  Low winter dissolved oxygen has not been a problem in similar lakes in this area, and assessments of Trip Lake have shown no indications of winterkill.  The current stocking rate (89 fgl/acre) has been used successfully in similar lakes in the area, although alternate-year stocking at that rate might not produce high numbers of fish.   <br> \n <br> \nThe Trip Lake management plan is due to be revised in 2016.  Alternatives to consider at that time include:  no change in management (further evaluation), increase the stocking rate, increase stocking frequency, stock a different rainbow trout strain, stock a different trout species, or discontinue trout management.  Public input on the management of Trip Lake will be sought in the fall of 2015, but comments and suggestions are welcome at any time, and will be considered when the plan is revised.  <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n</p>",
