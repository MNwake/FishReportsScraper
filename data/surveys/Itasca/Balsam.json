                "narrative": "<p>Balsam Lake is a class 25 lake located 14 miles north of Taconite, MN.  The lake has one public access and is moderately developed.  Balsam Lake has a history of producing large Northern Pike.  A special regulation was implemented in the spring of 2006 to maintain or improve size structure.  The regulation requires all Northern Pike from 24 to 36 inches be released and only one over 36 inches can be in possession.  The daily limit is three.  The 2017 lake management plan (LMP) indicates Northern Pike as the primary species of management with Black Crappie and Largemouth Bass as secondary species.  The LMP goals include maintaining the Northern Pike gill net catch at 5.3/net with 70, 25, and 10% of the fish over 21, 28, and 34 inches.  Other goals were to maintain the Black Crappie gill net or trap net catch near 3.0/net and maintain a spring night electrofishing catch for Largemouth Bass greater than 15/hour on-time. <br> \n <br> \nA standard survey was conducted in June of 2022 to assess the fish community and evaluate the Northern Pike special regulation.  A total of 12 gill nets and 12 trap nets were used in the survey.  Additional sampling of near shore fish species was conducted to calculate an Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) score.  The IBI information is in a separate Targeted Survey report.  Electrofishing for Largemouth Bass was not completed in 2022 due to staffing and workload considerations.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike gill net catch rates have ranged from 3.3 to 10.4 fish/net since 1966.  The 2022 catch of 6.0 fish/net was below average for the lake but near the LMP goal.  Lower pike numbers are desirable because slow growth and poor size structure is more common when densities are high.  Northern Pike ranged from 14.6 to 36.2 inches and averaged 23 inches.  Size structure goals were not achieved since only 60, 18, and 3% of the sample were 21, 28, and 34 inches long.  Size quality of pike appears to have modestly improved since the regulation went into effect and good angling opportunities exist. <br> \n  <br> \nBlack Crappie catch rates have been quite variable since 1966, however size structure resembled past surveys.  The gill net catch rate exceeded the LMP goal in 2022 (4.0 fish/net).  The gill net sampled fish ranged from 5.0 to 12.5 inches and averaged 8.7 inches.  Nearly 22 percent of captured crappie exceeded 10 inches.  Given the relative abundance and size structure, modest angling opportunities appear to exist.   <br> \n <br> \nBalsam Lake has a history of producing high numbers of small Bluegill.  The 2022 trap net catch was near the lake average and typical compared to similar lakes.  Bluegill lengths ranged from 3.0 to 8.9 inches and averaged 5.9 inches.  Only 6 percent of the sampled Bluegill exceeded 8 inches.  Good angling opportunities of moderate-sized sunfish appear to exist given the abundance and size structure.   <br> \n <br> \nTullibee are an important prey fish but are difficult to sample with our standard summer surveys due to their pelagic nature.   Catch rates have ranged from 0 to 14.2 fish/gill net since 1966.  Like many Minnesota lakes, Tullibee in Balsam appear to have declined over time.  The catch of 1.2/net in 2022 was typical for lakes with similar habitats but below average for Balsam.  The sampled fish ranged from 8.7 to 15.1 inches and averaged 12.7 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch catches have typically been low, ranging from 0 to 5.6/gill net since 1966.  In 2022, the catch was 4.7 fish/gill net.  The sampled fish ranged from 5.6 to 8.5 inches and had a mean length of 6.3 inches.  Yellow Perch are unlikely to attract angler interest due to their poor size structure and low numbers. <br> \n <br> \nLakes like Balsam seldom have good Walleye populations because they have low productivity, bog-stained water, and low perch numbers.  Past evaluations have determined Walleye natural reproduction was poor and various stocking strategies have failed to produce a viable fishery.  Since 1966, the gill net catch rates have fluctuated from 0 to 1.0 Walleye/net and the catch was 0.1/net in 2022.  Despite Walleye stocking being popular with anglers, it has not been effective in Balsam, and it would not be a wise use of future resources. <br> \n <br> \nOther species observed during the survey included Brown Bullhead, Largemouth Bass, Hybrid Sunfish, Pumpkinseed Sunfish, Rock Bass, and Yellow Bullhead.</p>",

According to stocking records and personnel communications (Joe Mix - Fisheries Specialist), walleye fingerlings (young-of-year) have been stocked in all aforementioned years with the exception of 1985.  Seventy-five percent of walleyes from the net catch may have had origins from these stockings and the other 25% may have erroneous age estimates due to difficulty in aging older walleyes.  Therefore, naturally occurring walleyes may be rare or non-existent in Balsam Lake.Growth analyses were determined using Disbcal software for northern pike, walleye, bluegill, and black crappie (included in this report). Back-calculated length values were evaluated using the proposed minimum quality length as a benchmark to determine when a particular species of fish would be recruited to an acceptable size for anglers.  Bluegills in the net catches attained six inches during their sixth year of life, while statewide, they achieved this length in four years.  Black crappies attained eight inches during their fifth growing season while statewide, they tended to attain this size near the end of their third growing season.  Northern pike appeared to attain a minimum quality size of 21 inches during their third or fourth growing season.  The age 3 group (northern pike) consisted of 70% females (n=13) while age 4 group consisted of equal proportions of males and females (n=8) and tend to support the hypothesis that females are faster growing.  Northern pike growth appears to be relatively average, as statewide, northern pike also attain 21 inches around age 4.The walleye net catch did not produce enough fish to achieve a goal of five fish for any age group to substantiate back-calculated values.  Despite the small sample size, most individual fish (83%), had achieved the minimum quality size of 15 inches in three of four years.  This is similar to lakes statewide.</p>",

Six 20-minute stations were selected similar to the 2002 special assessment.  A Smith-Root GPP 5.0 electrofishing boat equipped with a spider array anode using pulsed DC current was used for the assessment.  The temperature of the water was 14.1 C (57.4 F), conductivity was 129 umhos, and the visibility was moderate. <br> \n\tNo yearling walleye were captured in the assessment.

                "narrative": "<p>Balsam Lake is a moderate sized lake with low productivity located 14 miles north of Taconite, Minnesota.  The lake has one public access and is moderately developed.  Balsam Lake has a history of producing large Northern Pike, so in an attempt to maintain or improve size structure, a special regulation was implemented in the spring of 2006.  The regulation requires all Northern Pike from 24 to 36 inches to be released and only one over 36 inches can be in possession.  The daily limit is at three.  The 2012 lake management plan (LMP) indicates Northern Pike as the primary species of management with Black Crappie and Largemouth Bass as secondary species. <br> \n <br> \nA standard survey was conducted in June of 2016 to assess the fish community and evaluate the Northern Pike special regulation.  A total of 12 gill nets and 11 trap nets were used in the survey as well as spring night electrofishing for Largemouth Bass.  Additional sampling of near shore fish species was conducted in order to calculate an Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) score.  The IBI information is in a separate Targeted Survey report. <br> \n <br> \nThe Northern Pike gill-net catch rate was higher than desired for Balsam Lake in 2016.  The sampled fish ranged from 12.9 to 35.8 inches and averaged 21.7 inches.  Although size distribution was good compared to many Northern Pike populations, the LMP size distribution goals were not attained.  The large 2013 year-class has negatively influenced the size evaluation because those fish are still small.  Natural reproduction occurs on a regular basis and fish up to nine years old were sampled.  Growth was similar to the statewide averages with Northern Pike averaging 21.9 inches after four years.  Northern Pike anglers have the potential to catch upper-20 to mid-30 inch fish in Balsam Lake.  <br> \n  <br> \nBlack Crappie numbers tend to fluctuate as strong and weak year-classes move through the population.  The net catches have been quite variable since 1966, reflecting those natural variations in a population.  The population appeared to be in good shape in 2016 when the LMP goal of 4.0 fish/net was attained.  The fish sampled by gill nets ranged from 4.7 to 13.0 inches and averaged 8.4 inches.  Good natural reproduction was documented and the oldest fish were 11 years old.  The strong 2011 year-class represented nearly 50% of the sample so it may require a couple years to attain sizes anglers desire.  Fish averaged 8.4 inches after five years of growth, which is slow compared to other lakes with similar habitat. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass were sampled with spring night electrofishing three times since 2000 and the catch rates have remained stable.  The 2016 catch exceeded the LMP goal.  The sampled fish ranged from 9.3 to 19.1 inches and averaged 15.3 inches.  Based on the age distribution of the sample, it appears natural reproduction is low but regular.  Fish up to 11 years old were sampled and growth was similar to statewide averages for all ages.  <br> \n <br> \nLakes like Balsam seldom have good Walleye populations because they have low productivity, bog-stained water, and low perch numbers.  Past evaluations have determined Walleye natural reproduction is poor and various stocking strategies have failed to produce a viable fishery.  Since 1966, the gill-net catch rates have fluctuated from 0 to 1.0 Walleye/net and the catch was 0.3/net in 2016.  Despite Walleye stocking being popular with anglers, it has not effective in Balsam and it would not be a wise use of future resources.   <br> \n <br> \nTullibee are difficult to sample with our standard summer surveys due to their pelagic nature.   Catch rates have been variable since 1966 but were average when compared to similar types of lakes in 2016.  The sampled fish ranged from 7.9 to 17.6 inches and averaged 10.6 inches.  Tullibee are important prey for large predators like Northern Pike. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch numbers have been low since 1966 and remained low in 2016.  The sampled perch ranged from 5.7 to 7.8 inches and averaged 6.2 inches.  Yellow Perch are not likely providing much fishing opportunity due to their poor size distribution or prey for predators due to their low numbers. <br> \n <br> \nOther species observed during the survey included Bluegill, Brown Bullhead, Golden Shiner, Hybrid Sunfish, Pumpkinseed Sunfish, Rock Bass, White Sucker and Yellow Bullhead.  Additional species observed while sampling near-shore for IBI included Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Bluntnose Minnow, Central Mudminnow, Johnny Darter, Least Darter, Mottled Sculpin, Northern Sunfish, and Tadpole Madtom. <br> \n <br> \nIn order to maintain or improve fish and wildlife populations, water quality and habitat must be protected.  People often associate water quality problems with large-scale agricultural, forestry, urban development or industrial practices in the watershed.  In reality, the impact of land use decisions on one lake lot may be relatively small, yet the cumulative impact of those decisions on many lake lots can result in a significant decline in water quality and habitat.  For example, removing shoreline and aquatic vegetation, fertilizing lawns, mowing to the water's edge, installing beach sand blankets, failing septic systems and uncontrolled run-off, all contribute excess nutrients and sediment which degrade water quality and habitat.  Understanding these cumulative impacts and taking steps to avoid or minimize them will help to insure our quality fisheries can be enjoyed by future generations.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Balsam Lake is a 710-acre lake located in central Itasca County, north of Taconite, MN.  The lake has a maximum depth of 37 ft and a littoral area of 296 acres.  One aspect of this survey was to collect data as part of a statewide study evaluating different walleye stocking strategies including fry, fryling and three densities of fingerlings.  All stocked fish were marked with oxytetracycline (OTC) to determine the relative contribution of stocked fish and fish from natural reproduction.   <br> \n <br> \nWalleye gill net catch was 0.9/net, which was lower than the expected range for similar lakes.  Catch rates in past assessments have also been low varying from 0 to 1.0/gill net.  As part of the walleye stocking study, frylings were stocked at a rate of 150/littoral acre in 2001, fingerlings were stocked at 2 lbs/littoral acre in 2003, and fingerlings were stocked at 1 lb/littoral acre in 2005.  In 2006, 11 fish were aged and only four (36 %) corresponded to stocked year classes.  Fish from the 2005, year class were likely too small to be sampled effectively and all four fish corresponded to the 2003-year class.  These fish were also found to carry the OTC marks, confirming that they were stocked fish.  Walleye length frequency had two distinct groups; the 2003-year class that varied from 12 to 15 inches, and a second group of fish mainly from the 19966-year class that varied from 25 to 27 inches.  The 1996-year class was a nonstocked year.  Back-calculated length at age was not available for the 2006 survey, however growth in 2004 was similar to the statewide average.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike gill-net catch was 7.1/net, which within the expected range for similar lakes.  Gill-net catch rates in past assessments have varied from 3.3 to 10.4/net.  Size structure was generally poor and the majority of fish sampled were less than 24 inches.  However a few larger fish up to 37 inches were sampled.  Balsam Lake has the capability of producing large northern pike, and a 24 to 36 inch protected slot limit was implemented in 2006 to improve size structure.  Growth was similar to the statewide average with fish averaging 25 inches by age five.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie gill-net catch was 2.6/net, which was toward the upper end of the expected range for similar lakes.  Catch rates in past assessments have been highly variable from 2.0 to 9.1/gill net.  Size structure was fairly good with fish up to 10 inches sampled.  Recruitment was consistent and all year classes through age 8 were represented.  Growth was slower than the statewide average with fish averaging 10 inches by age 8, compared to 12 inches by age 8 for the statewide average.  Many of the lakes in this part of the county have a common thread of bog-stained water and slow growing black crappie populations.   <br> \n <br> \nBluegill trap net catch rate has been increasing and was 40/net, which was toward the upper end of the expected range for similar lakes.  Size structure was poor with few fish exceeding 8 inches.  Growth was slower than the lake class average for ages 1 to 6, and faster than the average for ages 7 to 10.  Bluegill average 8 inches by age 10. <br> \n <br> \nSpring electrofishing sampled largemouth bass at 13.7 fish/hour, which was similar to the 2000 catch rate of 18.0/hr.  Fish varied in length from 3 to 16 inches.  Growth was similar to the statewide average with fish averaging 15 inches at age seven.   <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch gill-net catch was 3.4/gill net and was within the expected range.  Catch rates in past assessments varied from 0.8 to 5.1/net.  Size structure was poor with no fish exceeding 9 inches. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled include tullibee, rock bass, brown bullhead, pumpkinseed, Johnny darter, blackchin shiner, blacknose shiner, bluntnose minnow, golden shiner, longear sunfish, tadpole madtom, and white sucker.   <br> \n <br> \nThe 2006 assessment was a full survey, which included vegetation sampling, substrate descriptions and water chemistry.  Vegetation sampling described the abundance of 49 different aquatic and riparian plant species.  Substrate was primarily sand and detritus with lesser amounts of rubble and gravel.  Water chemistry analysis indicated total phosphorous of 0.03 ppm and total alkalinity of 91 ppm.   <br> \n <br> \nLakeshore owners may affect fish populations not only through harvesting fish, but also through land use practices.  It is important to leave a 30 to 50 ft buffer strip of native vegetation along the shoreline to prevent erosion and provide habitat for fish and wildlife.  Nonfunctioning septic systems can also lead to water quality problems.  Good water quality and fish populations are the direct result of good land use practices.  Anglers can also help to improve the size structure of the fish community by practicing selective harvest. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Balsam Lake is a 710 acre lake located north of Taconite, MN in the Mississippi River watershed.  The lake has a maximum depth of 37 feet and a littoral area of 296 acres.  Balsam Lake is one of several area lakes that have historically produced large northern pike.  A special regulation (24 to 36 inch protected slot limit) for northern pike was implemented beginning in 2006.  The goal of the regulation was to maintain or improve the quality of the northern pike population.  The 2011 special assessment was undertaken as part of the regulation evaluation.  Gill nets were the only gear used and age and growth information was only collected from northern pike.  <br> \n <br> \nThe northern pike gill-net catch rate was 9.7/net, above the expected range but similar to recent assessments.  Gill-net catches in three of the last four assessments were above the lake class third quartile.  Size structure was fairly modest, with a PSD of 50, a PSD-P of 9 and a PSD-M of 2.  Gill-net sampled pike ranged from 9.8 to 36.3 inches, with a mean length of 20.7 inches.  Northern pike sampled in pre-regulation assessments had a similar size structure.  It appears the protected slot limit is at least maintaining the size structure of the northern pike population.  Pike over 28 inches are still being sampled at pre-regulation levels, with some fish over 34 inches present in the population.  Recruitment appeared relatively consistent with ages 1 through 10 represented in the sample.  Age 3 fish made up 33% of the sample.  Growth was similar to the statewide average.  <br> \n <br> \nThe gill-net catch rate for walleye was 0.5/net in 2011.  Catch rates have been below the lake class first quartile (1.3/net) in all prior assessments, varying from 0 to 1.0/net.  Sampled walleye were relatively large, ranging from 20.7 to 25.1 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch were sampled below the first quartile at 1.2/net.  Net catches for yellow perch have typically been low, varying from 0.8 to 5.6/net in previous assessments. <br> \n <br> \nThe black crappie gill-net catch was 2.7/net, above the lake class third quartile.  Gill-net catches have been highly variable in previous surveys ranging from 0.3 to 19.0/net.   Sampled crappie in 2011 varied from 4.7 to 9.3 inches, with a mean length of 7.1 inches. <br> \n <br> \nThe gill-net catch rate for tullibee was within the expected range at 3.8/net.  Catch rates in previous assessments have been variable from 2.6 to 14.25/net.  Sampled tullibee ranged from 6.6 to 17.3 inches, with a mean length of 13 inches. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled included bluegill, rock bass, black bullhead, golden shiner and white sucker. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Balsam Lake is a 710 acre lake located 15 miles north of Taconite.  The lake has one public access located on the south shore of the southern basin.  The lake management plan indicates northern pike and walleye as the primary species of management with black crappie and largemouth bass as secondary species.  The northern pike net catch exceeded the management goal of 5.2 fish/net with a catch of 8.2 fish/net.   Net catches have varied from 3.3 to 10.4 fish/net since 1966.  Fish ranged from 12.5 to 36.4 inches and averaged 22.6 inches.  Eight year classes were identified by age analysis with fish from one to nine years old.  Northern pike averaged 21.5 inches after four years of growth which is above the statewide average of 20.5.  The population appears to be in good shape with moderate numbers of fish and good size distribution.The walleye catch (0.9 fish/net) did not attain the management goal for the lake in 2000.  Despite various stocking strategies, historical walleye catch rates have been low, ranging from a low of 0.2 to a high of 1.0 fish/net.  Fish ranged from 14.9 to 24.8 inches and averaged 18.2 inches.   Only two year classes were identified from scale analysis (age 3, age 10).  Both year classes corresponded to stocked years and there has been little evidence for natural reproduction.  Walleye growth was excellent for the three year old fish that averaged nearly 16.0 inches compared to the statewide average of 12.3 inches.  Good growth would be expected since this year class experienced three, long growing seasons (due to the mild/short winters) and the population was low.Black crappie net catch rates were higher than 75% of all other lakes similar to Balsam.  The long-range goal in the 1996 management plan was also exceeded in 2000.  Black crappie from the gill nets ranged from 4.8 to 11.5 inches while fish from trap nets ranged from 3.2 to 12.3 inches.  Average lengths for both gears were just below 8.0 inches.  Fish from two to 11 years old were represented with nearly 33% of the fish from the 1997 year class.  The population appears to have fairly consistent recruitment since eight year classes were sampled.  Growth was slower than the statewide average for all year classes. In the spring, largemouth bass were electrofished at night for the first time.  The goal to exceed an electrofishing catch rate of 15 fish/hour was attained with a catch of 18 fish/hour.  The sample included fish from 5.8 to 18.9 inches with an average length of 12.3 inches.  Nine year classes were represented from two to 13 years old.  The 1997 year class represented 47% of the sample.  Largemouth bass growth was similar to statewide averages. Bluegill trap-net catch rates in 2000 (40.1/net)  were the highest on record.  In fact, they were nearly twice as high as the old record.  Prior to the 2000 assessment, trap-net catch rates had ranged from 13.1 to 20.9 fish/net which is typical for a lake of this type.  Bluegill ranged from 3.2 to 8.7 inches and averaged 5.9 inches.  Age and growth information  was not collected during the 2000 assessment.Other species observed during the population assessment included brown bullhead, golden shiner, pumpkinseed sunfish, rock bass, tullibee, white sucker, and yellow perch.  Based on our netting data, the yellow perch population has always been low regardless of other species population levels.  However, tullibee numbers have generally been good and the species is likely a critical prey source for predators in the fish community.  It is important to maintain this population since they are often associated with trophy fish.To promote and maintain healthy fish populations, pollution needs to be controlled.  Fish habitat is directly affected by water quality.  Nutrients, sediments and other waste can drastically alter the chemical and physical characteristics of a lake.  People often associate water quality problems in a lake with agricultural, forestry or industrial practices within the watershed.  Although these can be areas of concern, lakeshore property owners may also contribute to water quality problems.  Some examples include putting in sand beaches, removing shoreline trees and vegetation, fertilizing lawns, and mowing their lawns down to the lakeshore.  Proper land use practices by everyone will help insure that this fishery can be enjoyed by future generations. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Balsam Lake is a 710 acre lake located north of Taconite, MN in the Mississippi River watershed.  The lake has a maximum depth of 37 feet and a littoral area of 296 acres.  Balsam Lake has been part of a statewide study evaluating different walleye stocking strategies including fry, fryling and three densities of fingerlings.  All stocked fish were marked with oxytetracycline (OTC) to determine the relative contribution of stocked fish from natural reproduction.  Since the most recent assessment was part of the stocking evaluation, gill nets were the only gear used and age and growth information was only collected from walleye.  <br> \n <br> \nAs part of the study, walleye frylings were stocked at 150/littoral acre in 2001, while fingerlings were stocked at 2 lbs/littoral acre in 2003 and 1 lb/littoral acre in 2005.  Catch rates have been below the lake class normal range in all prior assessments, varying from 0 to 1.0/net.  Only four walleye were sampled in the 2008 assessment for a catch rate of 0.3/gill net.  Of the four fish sampled, only one corresponded to a stocked year class.  That fish was aged to the 2003 year class and was found to have an OTC mark, confirming that it was a stocked fish.  As in prior assessments, back-calculated mean length at age was found to be similar to the statewide average.  Overall, walleye gill-net catch rates in Balsam Lake have been too low to draw meaningful conclusions about the various stocking strategies, but some natural reproduction was documented. <br> \n <br> \nThe northern pike gill-net catch rate was 9.4/net, above the lake class normal range but similar to the last three assessments.  Size structure was generally poor; gill-net sampled pike ranged from 12.1 to 35.8 inches, with a mean length of 21.1 inches.  Balsam Lake has the capability of producing large northern pike, and a 24 to 36 inch protected slot limit was implemented in 2006 to help improve size structure. <br> \n <br> \nThe black crappie gill-net catch was 0.3/net, below the normal range and the lowest catch on record.  Gill-net catches have been highly variable in previous surveys ranging from 2.0 to 19.0/net.  Crappie sampled in 2008 varied from 5.1 to 10.9 inches, with a mean length of 8.4 inches. <br> \n <br> \nThe yellow perch gill-net catch rate was below the normal range at 1.4/net.  Net catches for yellow perch have typically been low, varying from 0.8 to 5.6/net in previous assessments. <br> \n <br> \nThe gill-net catch rate for tullibee was within the normal range at 3.2/net.  Catch rates in previous assessments have been variable from 2.6 to 14.25/net.  Sampled tullibee ranged from 6.6 to 18.0 inches, with a mean length of 11.5 inches. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled included bluegill and rock bass. <br> \n</p>",
