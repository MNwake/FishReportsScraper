                "narrative": "<p>Pocket Lake is a 275-acre natural lake located approximately 10 miles southwest of Alexandria.  Maximum depth is 35 ft.  The lake averages 15 ft in depth.  Water clarity and quality can be poor during late summer months.  Green and blue-green algal blooms are common.    Water clarity at time of the 2006 survey averaged 7.1 feet.  The northern end of the lake is shallow with dense stands of submergent vegetation.  Filamentous alga tends to collect among the rooted submergent vegetation.  Fishing in the north portion of the lake can difficult during summer months.  Ecological attributes describe a bass-panfish lake.  Primary fish management emphasis is directed at sunfishes.  Despite seasonal impairments, Pocket Lake supports good fishing.  <br> \n <br> \nKey sunfishes supporting the bass-panfish fishery include largemouth bass, bluegill, and black crappie.  Largemouth bass and bluegill catch rates in 2002 and 2006 surveys were significantly higher than average catches in prior surveys.  Such findings could be anticipated in response to gradual improvements of water quality and clarity, as well as expanded submergent vegetation coverage.   Survival of young sunfishes has increased.  A relatively high proportion of bass and bluegill catches were comprised age-4 and younger individuals.  Three-year-old bass made up most of 2006 electrofishing captures.  Average length of bass measured was 9.8 inches.  Fishing quality remains good.  Twenty-eight percent of 2006 captures exceeded 15.0 inches in length.  The largest bass recorded in 2006 was 18.5 inches.  Bluegill abundance has increased to exceed the basin's capacity to sustain past growth rates.  A four-year-old bluegill captured in the 1998 survey average nearly one inch longer than those measured in 2006.  No 8.0-inch or larger bluegill were captured in 2006 netting efforts, but 80% of the total catch were age-4 or younger. Average size and fishing quality should increase as the population ages.  <br> \n    <br> \nThe bright spot of the current fishery comes in the form of very high catches of black crappie. 2006 trapnet catches were well beyond  normal for similar basins.  Age distribution proved to that of other sunfishes.   Most were less than five-years-old.   Modest improvements in size structure were noted.   Thirty-four percent of captures exceeded 8.0 inches in total length.   The largest crappie recorded measured 10.7 inches in length.   <br> \n <br> \nFish community structure and stability are threatened with a great expansion in northern pike abundance.   Those habitat changes stimulating increased sunfish abundance also benefited northern pike.   Pike are now extremely abundant, greatly exceeding expected catches.  Growth rate and size distribution of the pike population have declined with addition of young fish.   Mean length was 20.3 inches.  Mean weight of sampled fish was 2.0 pounds.  The largest pike measured 35.4 inches in total length.  Lower catches in prior surveys offer hope that high catches are atypical and densities should decline.   <br> \n <br> \nWalleye population density remained lower than anticipated given aggressive stocking efforts.  Walleye gillnet catches averaged 2.8 fish/net in 2006, which is within the range of normal for the lake class, but well below the historical high.  Abundance and survival of stocked walleye is inversely related to northern pike abundance.  Size distribution of survey catches suggests survival of stocked fish is insufficient to yield or sustain walleye management objectives at when northern pike gillnet catch rate exceeds 5.0 pike/net.   Walleye growth is good.  Age-3 fish averaged 16.0 inches in total length at time of capture.  Anglers are likely to be pleased with the large average size of walleye present.  Six percent of 2006 captures exceeded 25.0 inches in length. <br> \n <br> \nContinued expansion of northern pike and sunfish populations is indicative of improving water clarity and expanded vegetation coverage.  Such changes don't come with an increase in the lake's carrying capacity.  Anglers can play an important role in correcting the current predator-prey imbalance and improving returns from walleye stocking by directed harvest of small northern pike.  Release 30.0 inch and larger pike capable of feeding on small northern pike.  There is also a harvestable-surplus of small black crappie, largemouth bass, and bluegill. Enjoy catching and releasing the larger sunfishes, and channel harvest towards 5.0 - 7.0 inch bluegill and 10.0 - 12.0 inch bass.   <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Pocket Lake is a 275-acre natural lake located approximately 10 miles southwest of Alexandria. Maximum depth is 35 ft. The lake averages 15 ft in depth. Water clarity and quality can be seasonally poor during summer months. Green and blue-green algal blooms are common. The northern end of the lake is shallow and supports dense stands of submergent vegetation. Filamentous algae collect on submerged plants making fishing difficult at times.  Habitat is best suited for largemouth bass and panfishes. <br> \n <br> \nPocket Lake can support good fishing, but due to a high degree of variability in reproductive success and recruitment of young fish into the fishery, fishing success and size of catches can be inconsistent.  Pocket Lake currently supports an abundance of small to medium sized black crappies, average numbers of bluegill, and low numbers of largemouth bass.  Most bass are young fish, but some large bass exist.   Northern pike are fairly abundant and average size is better than in many other Area lakes.  Twenty-nine percent of pike captured during the 2010 survey were 28.0 inches in length and larger.  Walleye numbers are limited.  Young walleye are stocked, but contributions to population abundance and harvest have been disappointing.   <br> \nPresently, black crappie and northern pike offer the best fishing opportunities.  Crappie are abundant and provide good fishing especially during the spring.  Shore angling is common off County Road 4 on the north end of the lake.  Average size is on the smaller size at 8-9 inches, but this can be offset by above average catch rates.  Northern pike over 30.0 inches are not uncommon.  Anglers should exercise restraint in harvesting large pike in order to sustain current size structure of the population and good fishing quality.  Harvest of 24.0 inch and smaller pike is strongly encouraged to promote a balanced predator-prey relationship and higher yields.   <br> \n</p>",

Backpack electrofishing and/or seining were conducted at 10 stations, representing a variety of habitat types, along the shoreline of Pocket Lake.  The survey was conducted during the five-year sampling window for intensive monitoring efforts within the Long Prairie River watershed, and will be contributing to a watershed assessment process in coordination with Minnesota Pollution Control Agency.\n\nFourteen species were collected during this survey.  Two species (Banded Killifish and Iowa Darter) were considered \"intolerant\" and two species (Fathead Minnow and Green Sunfish) were considered \"tolerant\" based on current tolerance classifications for Minnesota lakes. \n\nNearshore catch data will be used along with gill and trap net catch data to develop an Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) score, which is indicative of the health of Pocket Lake.</p>",

The Bluegill population and size is healthy and has improved significantly from past surveys.  This may be due to a high Common Carp population that has limited the success of the spawning Bluegills. Black Crappies have increased to levels 29x the state median and exhibit classic signs of a stunted population.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Pocket Lake is a 275-acre eutrophic lake located north of Lowry along State Highway #114.  There is a concrete ramp on the south side.  Dense filamentous algae  prohibits fishing on the north end of the lake during the late summer.  Midsummer water quality is also poor with green and blue-green algal blooms common.  The lake consists of two separate basin types.  The northern end consists of a shallow muck flat with dense stands of submergent vegetation.  The southern portion is a typical bowl-shaped basin with lesser amounts of vegetation.Pocket Lake is best known for its spring black crappie fishing.  The north end along County Road #4 is heavily fished from shore following ice-out.  Black crappie were very abundant in 1998.  Trap net catches averaged 21.0 fish per net.  Two age classes were predominate.  Age-1 fish averaged 4.2 inches and age-4 fish averaged 8.3 inches.  It appears that strong year classes of black crappie are produced in about one of every three years in Pocket Lake.Anglers also target walleye.  Gill net catch of 10.0 fish per net is well above the normal range for lakes with similar physical and chemical characteristics.  The size distribution is also very desirable.  Mean weight of fish captured was 2.0 pounds.  A strong 1994 year class, averaging  18 inches in length, will continue to provide quality angling opportunities.  Even-year fingerling stocking is used to supplement the existing natural reproduction.Spring electrofishing resulted in the capture of 28 largemouth bass per hour.  Moderate numbers of quality fish are present.   Fish up to 19 inches in length were captured.  Early season angling can be very good.  The north end of the lake is shallow with plenty of submergent vegetation.  Thick mats of filamentous algae form in this area during summer months and can hinder angling efforts.  The central portion of the lake is then targeted with deep water techniques.Ice fishing pressure is minimal, however good catches of black crappie and walleye have been reported.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Due to the stocking of both age 0 and age 1 walleye fingerlings, there have been no blank years to evaluate natural reproduction.  The 1986 & 1988 year classes were apparently successfully established by fingerling stockings in those years.  The 1987 fingerling stocking was unsuccessful.  Growth rates are good.  Age 4 walleye average 16.5 inches in length.  Mean weight of the walleyes captured by gillnets was 1.96 lbs.  Northern pike gillnet catches declined from those recorded in previous surveys.  This decline may be due to the drought (1987-1990) which may have limited northern pike spawning habitat availability.  Yellow perch CPUE increased from 51.0 perch/gillnet in 1986 to 151.7 perch/gillnet.  PSD was calculated at 3.0%.  Black crappie continue to be abundant in Pocket Lake. Trapnetting CPUE averaged 14.8 fish/net night.  Despite good growth rates (age 2 black crappie averaged 6.54 inches), only 4% of the black crappie were over 8.0 inches long.  This lack of large crappie is similar to previous surveys.  Catch rates reported in a special fall trapnetting assessment were not significantly different from the June survey, however, structural indices were improved in the fall survey.  PSD values increased from 7.0% to 53.0% in response to growth of age 2 fish to quality-size.  Bluegill trapnet catches are relatively low (6.7 bluegill/trapnet) in comparison to other area lakes.  However, bluegill exhibit excellent growth (age 4 bluegill averaged 7.6 inches).  PSD exceeded 40.0%.  Early June electrofishing efforts yielded only 10.7 largemouth bass/hr.  The smallest fish captured was 13.0 inches long.  Growth rates are excellent with age 4 bass averaging 13.5 inches.  Black and yellow bullhead net catches were low (2.7 BLB/gillnet and 0.3 YEB/gillnet).  Many carp can be observed along the shoreline in May, but only few were captured in the netting survey.  Only 9.0 fish were captured in 9 net sets.  1.3 CAP/trapnet were captured during the survey.  Mean weight of the carp captured was 7.24 lbs.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Pocket Lake is a fertile lake which is prone to dense algal blooms and poor water clarity during summermonths.  Blue-green algal blooms are also common during July and August.  Submergent vegetation growsto a maximum depth of 9.0 feet and is common in many areas.  Hardstem bulrush and common cattail standsare scattered along the shoreline of the lake.  Firm substrate and aquatic vegetation provide suitablespawning habitat and cover for largemouth bass, bluegill, and black crappie.Northern pike abundance is limited.  Gillnet catches averaged 1.3 fish/net in 1994 which is below thenormal range of mean catch rates from lakes with similar chemical and physical characteristics (3.5 -8.9 fish/net).  An identical gillnet catch rate was recorded in 1990, however gillnet catches averagedapproximately 5.0 fish/net in 1986, 1981, and 1974.  Low northern pike numbers are likely related tolack of suitable marsh spawning habitat.  Low water levels from 1988-1991 may have exacerbated theproblem.  Bluegill trapnet catches averaged 25.0 fish/net in 1994.  Trapnet catches have ranged from6.7 - 17.2 fish/net in previous surveys dating back to 1974.  The normal range of mean catch rates is9.5 - 57.3 fish/trapnet.  Approximately eight of ten fish captured were 6 inches in length or greater. The average weight of fish captured was 0.2 pounds.  Largemouth bass should provide quality anglingopportunities.  Electrofishing yielded 31.2 stock-size largemouth bass per hour.  One-half of the fishwere 12 inches or greater and 25% exceeded 15 inches in length.  Mean weight of fish captured was 1.2pounds.  Pocket Lake has a history of abundant black crappie populations.  Trapnet catches averaged 8.6fish/net which exceeds the normal range of mean catch rates from similar lakes (0.8 - 4.0 fish/net). Trapnet catches have ranged from 8.0 - 77.2 fish/net in previous surveys dating back to 1974.  Meanweight of fish captured in 1994 was 0.2 pounds.  Size structure is a function of the age classdistribution of the black crappie population.  Age-3 fish comprised 96% of the fish captured intrapnets.  Cohorts of this year class averaged 7.4 inches in length at time of capture.  Yellow perchgillnet catches averaged 67.3 fish/net which greatly exceeds the normal range of mean catch rates fromsimilar lakes (1.0 - 10.3 fish/gillnet).  Gillnet catches ranged from 24.8 - 151.7 fish/net in previoussurveys dating back to 1974.  Mean weight of fish captured in 1994 was 0.1 pounds.  Walleye abundancehas decreased since the last survey in 1990.  Gillnet catches averaged 1.8 fish/net in 1994 comparedto 7.7 fish/net in 1990.  Catches averaged 2.3, 0.3, and 4.8 fish/gillnet in 1986, 1981, and 1974,respectively.  The normal range of mean catch rates from similar lakes is 0.5 - 2.3 fish/gillnet.  Mostof the fish captured in 1994 were between 16.0 and 24.0 inches in total length.  Mean weight of fishcaptured was 2.9 pounds.  Walleye fingerlings are stocked at a rate of 1.5 pounds per littoral acreevery other year to provide some additional angling opportunities, however recent stockings do notappear to have been successful.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Pocket Lake is a 275-acre basin located about 10 miles southwest of Alexandria.  Water clarity and quality are poor during summer months.  Blue-green algal blooms can be a problem in August.  The northern end of the lake is a shallow flat with dense stands of submergent vegetation.  Filamentous algae can also become dense in the north end and fishing in this area can be limited during summer months.  Pocket Lake should provide good family oriented fishing opportunities.  Northern pike, largemouth bass, bluegill, and black crappie were all quite abundant in the 2002 survey.  Many anglers fish for black crappie off of County Road 4 along the north end of the lake in early spring.  Catch rates are typically high, however the average size of fish caught is usually less than nine inches.  Most of the bluegill captured during the lake survey were 6 inches in length or greater, but none exceeded 8 inches.  Ten to twelve inch largemouth bass were very abundant in 2002.  These may provide outstanding fishing in a couple of years.Walleye abundance has declined in recent years.  Gill net catches averaged only 1.8 fish/net in 2002, compared to 10.0 fish/net in 1998.  Walleye stocking was increased in 2001 as part of the Accelerated Walleye Program.  Future plans include both fry and fingerling stockings, as well as an evaluation of which method results in higher walleye numbers.    </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Pocket Lake is a 263-acre relatively shallow, productive basin located in southcentral Douglas County within the Long Prairie watershed.  Mean and maximum depths are 15 and 40 feet, respectively.  This lake is not highly developed and recreational pressure is minimal.  A public access is located on the southwest shoreline.  A popular shore fishing spot is located on the north shoreline off of County Road 4.  Pocket Lake is designated as an infested waterbody due to the presence of zebra mussels, which were first confirmed in 2016.\n\nA standard lake survey was completed during summer 2022 to assess the fish community and gain updated estimates of abundance and size structure of gamefish populations.  Survey results were indicative of a typical bass-panfish lake found in west-central Minnesota.  Largemouth Bass, Northern Pike, Black Crappie, and Bluegill were all abundant.  The size structure of bass and pike populations were favorable.  Bass exceeding 15 inches and pike exceeding 26 inches were sampled in good numbers.  The largest bass measured over 18 inches and the largest pike measured just shy of 33 inches.  Pike anglers are reminded that this basin falls in the North-central Zone where anglers can now keep up to 10 pike but not more than two can be over 26 inches in length.  All pike between 22-26 inches must be immediately released.  Panfish populations on this basin tend to \"stunt\" and are typically dominated by small- to medium-sized individuals.  In the 2022 survey, high numbers of Black Crappie and Bluegill were observed but no crappie exceeded 10 inches and very few Bluegill exceeded 8 inches.  Anglers are encouraged to harvest these surplus smaller fish to help reduce density, increase growth rates, and improve size structure of these populations.  The Walleye population in this lake typically exhibits low to moderate abundance but moderate to high size structure.  Average size of the 2022 gill net sample was 17 inches and almost 2 pounds.  Record-low Yellow Perch abundance was documented in 2022 and most perch sampled were small individuals.  Harvestable-size perch are rare on this basin.\n  \nOther species sampled in 2022 included Bowfin (dogfish), Brown and Yellow Bullhead, Common Carp, Green Sunfish, hybrid sunfish, Pumpkinseed, and White Sucker.  The next lake survey is tentatively scheduled for 2028. \n</p>",

The gillnet index has increased from 0.33 fish/set in 1981 to 2.33 in this assessment. Gillnet indices on Northern Pike abundance has not changed since 1981, while the average size has increased from 1.0 lb fish to 3.24 lbs/fish. Yellow Perch abundance has significantly increased and may explain the improved size structure of Northern Pike. Largemouth Bass, sampled for the first time this spring by electrofishing, show an adequate population of catchable size fish with some large individuals present.  Scales taken from these individuals indicate moderate to fast growth.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Pocket Lake is a 275-acre lake located approximately 10 miles southwest of Alexandria.  The basin has a maximum depth of 40 feet and an average depth of approximately 15 feet.  The lake exists in a eutrophic state in response to excessive nutrient delivery from the watershed and internal nutrient cycling during summer months.  Water transparency measures during summer months from 2008 to 2016 have averaged 5.7 feet.  Occasional nuisance algal blooms can occur.  Due to depth and fertility, the lake becomes thermally stratified during the summer. While thermally stratified, dissolved oxygen concentrations may be too low to support fish life below the thermocline.  The thermocline occurred at approximately 17.0 feet during the July 2016 standardized fisheries survey.  Much of the lake's submergent vegetation occurs in the shallow, northern end of the lake.  Habitat conditions can be seasonally harsh for cool water gamefishes and sight-feeding predators.  Even with such challenges, Pocket Lake can offer good fishing opportunities and quieter fishing experiences than other lakes near Alexandria.   <br> \n <br> \nThe most recent fisheries survey was completed in 2016.  Survey methodology included spring electrofishing on May 24 to assess Largemouth Bass population abundance and size structure.  Gill and trap nets were set from July 5-7 to best capture and estimate abundance, age structure, growth, and size distribution of other gamefishes.    <br> \n <br> \nSimilar to preceding survey results, Black Crappies proved to be very abundant.  Size of captures extended to 10.9 inches.  Most crappie captures were two- or three-year-old fish, thus average size of captures in trap nets was only 5.8 inches.  These population attributes were very similar to that of Bluegill Sunfish.  Trap net catches of Bluegills were elevated.  Age distribution of captures extended to age 8, but most of the total catch was comprised of two- and three-year-old individuals.  Rate of growth of Bluegills is a little too slow to optimize fishing potential.  Older captures were just reaching 8.0 inches in length at age 7.  With a maximum age of eight-years-old, the relative proportion of 8.0-inch and larger Bluegill captures during this and past surveys has been limited.  The largest Bluegill measured during the 2016 survey was 8.6 inches in total length.  Yellow Perch were moderately abundant, but captures were too small to contribute to the panfishery.  Average length of perch caught in gill nets was 6.4 inches. <br> \n <br> \nWalleyes are stocked to sustain this popular fishing opportunity.  Twenty-two Walleyes were captured in gill nets, which yielded a modest catch rate of 3.7 fish/net.  Sizes at capture ranged from 11.1 to 22.9 inches and averaged 16.4 inches.  Northern Pike are more abundant, but in absence of cisco and a coolwater refuge during summer months, growth potential is diminished.  Pike catches ranged from 10.3 to 30.3 inches in length.  Average length was 21.9 inches.  Largemouth Bass catches during the spring electrofishing survey were lower than anticipated based on past survey results.  Annual recruitment of young bass into the population appeared to be limited from 2009 through 2012.  Most bass captures were young fish determined to be two- or three-years-old or older individuals either eight- or nine-years-old.  Average length at capture was 9.6 inches.  The largest bass captured by electrofishing measured 16.5 inches. <br> \n <br> \nCatch statistics generated from the 2016 survey would tend to describe only fair fishing because of the high proportion of young sunfishes (Largemouth Bass, Bluegills, and Black Crappies) in the total catch.  Fishing experiences might best be described as high catch rates, but a small average size.  Fish quality expressed in terms of average size of captures should improve markedly as those young fish grow to preferred sizes.  Anglers are encouraged to target the surplus of 22.0-inch and smaller Northern Pike and practice catch and release of larger, older predators to maintain or enhance predator-prey balance and fish quality.   <br> \n <br> \nA DNR public access is located on the far south end of the lake.  Zebra mussels were found in Pocket Lake in 2016.  Anglers and recreational boaters are urged to thoroughly clean and disinfect watercraft after use and avoid transporting water and invasive species to other non-infested basins.  <br> \n</p>",
