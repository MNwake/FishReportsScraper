Fourteen sampling sites were evenly spaced around the shoreline and each site was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining, excepting one site where soft sediments prevented the use of a seine.  Nearshore sampling captured 21 species of fish, including several species that are intolerant of shoreline disturbance and/or poor water quality (Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Pugnose Shiner, Iowa Darter, and Rock Bass).   <br> \n <br> \nThe near shore fish survey data is combined with gill net and trap net data from a July 2016 survey to describe the fish community and provide a fish-based Index of Biotic Integrity (FIBI) score based on expectations for similar lakes. The FIBI score for Sugar Lake is well above an impairment threshold developed for similar lakes; of note was an absence of tolerant fish species, and high number of small benthic and vegetation-dwelling fish species sampled.  <br> \n <br> \nThis survey is contributing to a watershed assessment process in coordination with the MN Pollution Control Agency. Sugar Lake is located in the Mississippi River - St. Cloud Watershed.   <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Sugar Lake is a 1,015 acre lake located five miles north of the City of Annandale in northern Wright County. The lake has excellent water quality and is a popular recreation lake. Sugar Lake has a maximum depth of 69 feet and an average water clarity of ten feet. Oxygen was adequate for sport fish to a depth of 23 feet during the third week of July. Sugar Lake has a moderate watershed (6,691 acres); land use practices within the watershed consist of: agriculture (31%), open water (20%), forest (17%), hay/pasture (11%), grassland (8%), wetland (7%), and residential (6%). There are two public accesses on the lake, one each on the north and south ends of the lake. The access on the south end is the larger of the two with enough parking spaces for 18 vehicle-trailer combinations. The lake was designated for Muskellunge management in 1967 and the lake is primarily managed for Muskellunge, Walleye, and Northern Pike. The Muskellunge and Walleye populations are managed through annual fingerling stocking. In 2007, experimental fishing regulations were put in place for Northern Pike (24 to 36 inch protected slot) and Black Crappie (five fish bag limit). In 2016, a standard lake survey was completed to monitor the effects of the fishing regulations as well as to monitor changes in the fishery since the last survey conducted in 2012. Along with the standard survey an Ice-Out assessment was conducted in early spring to estimate the size of the Muskie population as well as to help evaluate the experimental fishing regulations. Near-shore Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) sampling and emergent and floating leaf plant mapping were conducted in July to help evaluate the health of the lake. Results from the Ice-Out and IBI surveys will be written up in separate reports. <br> \n <br> \nSugar Lake has a diverse aquatic plant community. While no submerged aquatic plant survey was conducted in 2016, the last survey conducted in 2007 found 35 species of aquatic plants present with coontail, Illinois pondweed, Chara, northern milfoil, sago pondweed and water celery being the most common. Emergent and floating leaved plants were mapped in July and found covering about 22% of the shoreline. Species mapped included: cattail (49 acres), white water lily (21 acres), yellow water lily (12 acres), wild rice (12 acres), and bulrush (11 acres). <br> \n <br> \nSugar Lake has been plagued by high Northern Pike abundance dating back to the 1970's. The Northern Pike population continues to be abundant (20 adults/ acre) with high numbers of small fish. The catch in 2016 was higher than 2012 and continues to be above expected values for similar lakes; however it is similar to the long term average for the lake. The average length and weight of Northern Pike has changed little since 1998 and remains small (19 inches and 1.7 pounds, respectively). Results from the spring targeted survey were more encouraging given the fact that 18% of the Northern Pike sampled were larger than 24 inches and 8% were larger than 30 inches in length. These values are higher than any of the previous 13 ice-out assessments dating back to 1976 which is a significant indicator that the special pike regulation is having a positive impact on medium to large fish. <br> \n <br> \nThe Walleye catch (3.3/ gill net) decreased from 2012 (4.5/ gill net), but was still within the range of expected values for similar lakes. Since 1971, the Walleye catch has always been within the normal range of expected values for Sugar Lake, exceeding it only in 1986. The average catch across all years is 4.3/gill net. Walleye ranged in length from 9 to 28 inches with an average length of 17 inches, although one Walleye caught in the spring was almost 31 inches and weighed just under 13 pounds. Growth of Walleye was fast compared to statewide averages as Walleye reach 16 inches in three years. <br> \n <br> \nOpen water (pelagic) forage species continue to be rare in Sugar Lake. No White Sucker have been sampled since 1998 and have been below the expected values for the lake type since 1971. Catches of Yellow Perch remain low and were identical to the 2012 and 2007 surveys. With the exception of 1998, Yellow Perch have also been below the expected values in all previous lake surveys since 1971. Tullibee (Cisco) have the potential to be a very important prey source for predator species in Sugar Lake. Even though relatively few Tullibee (Cisco) were sampled in the spring and summer surveys (23 total), catches were higher than at any point since 1982. Tullibee (Cisco) from spring and summer surveys ranged in length from 6 to 15 inches, indicating that multiple year classes were present. Tullibee (Cisco) are very sensitive to water temperatures above 68?F and begin to experience stress when the dissolved oxygen drops below 5 mg/L. Protecting water quality in Sugar Lake needs to be a priority in order to provide the thermal habitat necessary for Tullibee (Cisco) to survive in Sugar Lake. <br> \n <br> \nThere is an excellent Largemouth Bass population in Sugar Lake however the average size is small. During nighttime electrofishing in May, the catch rate was over four times higher than the average rate for lakes in the Sauk Rapids Management Area and nearly twice what was reported in 2007. Lengths ranged from 3 to 17 inches with an average length of 11 inches. Only 2% of Largemouth Bass were 15 inches or longer. Given the high number of small bass, anglers are encouraged to harvest some smaller bass and release larger fish. <br> \n <br> \nSugar Lake has an abundant population of Bluegill and a smaller population of Black Crappie. Few quality size Bluegills can be found in Sugar Lake as 46% of the Bluegills sampled were less than 6 inches long. The average size of Bluegill was 5.5 inches but very few were over eight inches. Black Crappies are less abundant, but fish up to 15 inches were sampled in the spring ice-out survey. After 10 years of the reduced bag limit on Black Crappie, it appears that the regulation is helping protect the size structure of the Black Crappie population. The average size of Black Crappie has increased from 8.5 inches to 9.5 inches and the percentage of crappies larger than 10 inches has increased from 27% in 2007 to 61% in 2016. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled during the survey were: Black Bullhead, Bowfin, Brown Bullhead, Green Sunfish, Hybrid Sunfish, Largemouth Bass, Pumpkinseed Sunfish, Rock Bass, and Yellow Bullhead. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Sugar Lake is a 1,015 acre recreational development lake located five miles north of the City of Annandale in northern Wright County. The lake has excellent water quality and is a popular recreation lake. There are two public accesses on the lake, one each on the north and south ends of the lake. The lake was designated for muskellunge management in 1967 and is managed for muskellunge, walleye, and northern pike. Muskellunge fingerlings are stocked every other year, while walleye fingerlings are stocked annually. In 2007, experimental fishing regulations were put in place for northern pike and black crappie. This assessment marks the midpoint of the evaluation period. Along with summer gill nets and trap nets, this population assessment also included: spring muskellunge and walleye assessments and population estimates. <br> \n <br> \nThe muskellunge population was estimated to be 222 adults (30 inches or larger). This estimate 0.22 fish/acre) is similar to the 2007 estimate (0.26 fish/acre) and is within the range of reported values for Minnesota lakes (0.2 - 0.4 fish/acre). Muskellunge sampled ranged from 20 to 51 inches and averaged 42.4 inches. For the second consecutive survey fish over 50 inches were sampled. Nine year classes were present in the aging sample with the 2002 - 2006 year classes making up 76% of the sample. Management has achieved its goal of providing a high quality, low density muskellunge population. <br> \n <br> \nThe northern pike population continues to be abundant. The catch in 2012 was significantly higher than 2007 and continues to be above expected values for similar lakes. The average length and weight of northern pike has changed little since 1998 and remain small (19.8 inches and 2 pounds, respectively). Eighteen percent of the northern pike caught in gill nets were larger than 24 inches compared to 12% in 2007. We hope to see this percentage continue to increase the longer the regulation is in place. <br> \n <br> \nThe walleye catch increased significantly from 2007, but was still within the range of expected values for similar lakes. The walleye population was estimated to be 3,559 adults or 3.5 adults/acre. This compares to the 2007 estimates of 1.4 adults/acre. DNR net catches of walleye since 1971 show that walleye have existed within the normal range of expected values for Sugar Lake, exceeding it only in 1976 and 1986. The average catch for all years is slightly less than five walleye per gill net. The average length and weight of walleye sampled was 18 inches and 2.4 pounds, respectively. Both are lower than reported in 2007 (19.6 inches and 3.2 pounds), but still respectable. <br> \n <br> \nCatches of yellow perch remain below expected values and were identical to 2007. <br> \n <br> \nSugar Lake has an abundant population of bluegill and a smaller population of black crappie. Few quality size bluegills can be found in Sugar Lake as 67% of the bluegills sampled were less than 6 inches long. Only four fish larger than 8 inches long were sampled during the survey. The average size of bluegill was 5.5 inches. Black crappies are less abundant, but fish up to 13 inches were captured with an average size of 8 inches. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled during the survey were: black bullhead, bowfin, brown bullhead, green sunfish, hybrid sunfish, largemouth bass, pumpkinseed sunfish, rock bass, and yellow bullhead. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Important game species captured in gill nets included Northern Pike, Walleye, Muskellunge, and Yellow Perch.  Tullibee, an important forage fish, was not captured during the 1992 survey.  Although the catch data suggests a slight decreasing trend in abundance, summer gill netting is not a good indicator of Tullibee abundance. Only older individuals (age 5 and older) were captured during the last two surveys.  \n\nNorthern Pike were abundant (16.2/gill net) with a net catch greater than the range of expected values for lakes similar to Sugar.  The net catch typically has been above the expected value since the 1950 survey, and peaked during 1982 with an average of 24.4/gill net.  Average length (19.0 to 19.9 inches) was identical to the 1986 survey and growth was also similar to the 1986 survey.  Northern Pike growth was average, with a length of 20 inches reached at age four.  Northern Pike ranged in age from 3-8 with age 3 fish most abundant in the gill net catch during the 1982, 1986, and 1992 surveys.  The dominance of age 3 in all previous surveys may indicate consistent recruitment and that Northern Pike do not become fully vulnerable to gill nets until age 3.  Northern Pike trap net catches also indicate an abundant population, but with a peak catch rate during 1986.  Northern Pike were fin clipped during the spring assessment.  Recaptures were recorded during the summer assessment and the population of age 3 and older fish was estimated to be 14,500 fish during 1992, corresponding to 14.3 per acre.  \n\nWalleye catch (4.3/net) was within the expected range of values for similar lakes, and showed a significant decrease from 8.8/net during 1986. The high catch in 1986 was the result of a large number of fish from the 1983 year class (age 3). During 1983, 5,350 (7.5 per pound) fingerlings were stocked.  The Walleye catch has typically been within the expected range for lakes like Sugar.  The strongest year classes correspond to stocking years; however, some natural reproduction or movement through the immediate watershed exists because Walleye from unstocked years (1984 and 1989) were caught during 1992.  Only one age 3 and two age 8 Walleye were captured, corresponding to years without stocking.  The strongest year class (1987) corresponds to a stocking of 575 yearling fish in 1988.  Walleye length at age data were similar to the 1986 survey and were fast compared with statewide growth values. Walleye females exhibited fast growth through age 6, whereas males only exhibited fast growth through age 2.  Walleye ranged in length from 10.0 to 27.9 inches with bimodal peaks at 13.0 and 20.0 inches. \n\nMuskellunge were caught (0.2/net) for the second summer survey in a row (1986 and 1992).  The Muskellunge were 22.0 and 25.0 inches and averaged 2.6 lbs. Additional information on Muskellunge has been collected during special spring assessments, most recently during 1992.  The Yellow Perch catch (1.7/net) was within the expected range and was similar to the 1986 net catch.  Yellow Perch ranged in length from 5.0 to 6.9 inches with an average length of 5.5 to 5.9 inches. The average weight (0.1 pounds) was below the expected range, but this may be the result of many young fish being sampled.  Many Yellow Perch young-of-year (95) were seined, ranging in length from 1.6 to 2.0 inches.  \n\nImportant game species captured in trap nets included: Bluegill, Largemouth Bass, and Black Crappie.  Other species captured with trap nets included: Bowfin, Common Carp, Black, Brown, and Yellow Bullhead, Rock Bass, Green Sunfish, and Pumpkinseed.  The Bluegill catch (42.1/net) and average weight (0.1 pounds) were within the expected range.  The Bluegill catch (132/trap net) decreased from 1986 and was within the expected range.  However, the Bluegill catch showed an increase from 5.3/net in 1986 to 34.7/net in 1992.  Bluegill caught in trap nets ranged in length from 3.0 to 6.9 inches with an average length of 5.0 to 5.4 inches.  Bluegill captured in gill nets were slightly larger with an average weight of 0.16 pounds and ranged in length from 3.5 to 8.4 inches (average length 6.0 to 6.4 inches).  Young-of-year were not caught with seines, unlike the 1986 survey when 266 were captured. \n \nLargemouth Bass abundance has varied little from survey to survey, with an average of 1.1/trap net captured during 1992.  The trap net catch was above the range of expected values, but average weight (0.2 pounds) was within the expected range.  Largemouth Bass captured in trap nets ranged in length from 4.0 to 9.9 inches with an average length of 6.0 to 6.4 inches.  Largemouth Bass captured in gill nets (0.8/net) were larger, ranging in length from 8.0 to 12.9 inches.  Ages ranged from 1 to 4 years old, with average growth.  Thirteen young-of-year were sampled with seines.  \n\nBlack Crappie numbers (0.8/trap net) were lower than expected, but average weight (0.26 pounds) was within the expected range.  Black Crappie historical trap net catches have been lower than the expected range. Black Crappie ranged in length from 6.0 to 12.9 inches in trap nets and 9.0 to 9.4 inches in gill nets. Average length was 7.0 to 7.4 inches.  Other panfish captured included; Green Sunfish, Pumpkinseed, and Rock Bass.  Green Sunfish (4.6/trap net) and Pumpkinseed (6.1/trap net) catches were more abundant than expected, whereas Rock Bass numbers were within the expected range.  Historically, the catch rate of these panfish has varied little with the exception of a peak catch of 16.8/trap net for Pumpkinseed during 1986.  \n\nYellow and Brown Bullhead, Common Carp, and Bowfin catches were within the expected range of values for lakes like Sugar, and the Black Bullhead catch was lower than expected. Although Common Carp numbers were within the expected range, the catch has showed an increasing trend, from none captured during 1950, 1971, and 1976 to 0.15/trap net in 1982 and 1986, and finally 1.7/trap net in 1992.  Common Carp had a wide range of sizes (14.0 to 22.9 inches), indicating reproduction within the lake or migration into the lake exists.  Six other small forage species were seined during 1992.  Only three small forage species were seined during 1986 and five during 1982.  Blacknose Shiner and Spottail Shiner were the most numerous and were captured where vegetation was moderately abundant.  The remaining species in order of number seined include: Brook Silversides, Banded Killifish, Johnny Darter, and Fathead Minnow.  Logperch were sampled during the 1982 and 1986 surveys in low numbers, but not during the 1992 survey.\n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Sugar Lake, a general development lake, is located in northern Wright County, approximately five miles north of Annandale.  There are two public accesses, one each on the north and south sides of the lake.  Sugar Lake was designated for muskellunge management in 1967.  With its larger size (1,015 acres), depth (69 feet), and water clarity (10 feet or more), Sugar Lake is one of the outstanding lake resources of the county.  Past stocking has included walleye fingerlings (since 1945) and muskellunge (since 1967).   <br> \n <br> \nThis is the first survey since 1998 and it included a spring muskellunge assessment, electrofishing for largemouth bass, and summer netting.  This survey is also considered part of the background for the new fishing regulations that went into place in 2007.  Those regulations protect northern pike from 24-36 inches and reduce the limit of crappie to five per day. <br> \n <br> \nThe 2007 survey provided a unique opportunity to estimate the northern pike, walleye and muskellunge populations. <br> \n <br> \nThe northern pike population was estimated to consist of 10,803 adults, or 10.6 adult northern pike per acre.  This is a large population but the numbers are consistent with what has been found in the past.  Northern pike average 19 inches in length and weigh less than two pounds.  About 12% of the northern pike were larger than 24 inches, a percentage we hope increases as the regulations begin to work. <br> \n <br> \nThe walleye and muskellunge populations were substantially less than the northern pike.  The walleye population was estimated to consist of 1,465 adults or 1.4 adults per acre.  DNR net catches of walleye since 1971 show that walleye have existed within the normal or expected range for Sugar Lake, exceeding it only in 1976 and 1986.  The average catch for all years is slightly less than five walleye per gill net.  Relatively low numbers of walleye are present because there is no natural reproduction and the fish community is unbalanced with few yellow perch and large numbers of small northern pike. <br> \n <br> \nThe muskellunge population was estimated to be 266 adults (30 inches or larger).  This estimate of muskellunge, 0.26 fish/acre, is within the range of reported values for Minnesota lakes (0.2 - 0.4 muskellunge/acre).  Muskellunge average 41 inches and for the first time, a fish larger than 50 inches was captured.  It was 51 inches and 33.5 pounds.  Management has achieved its goal of providing a high quality but low-density population.  Angling interest is high also, with one-third of all anglers seeking muskellunge. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass were sampled by electrofishing on May 2, 2007.  A total of 149 largemouth bass were captured in slightly less than one hour.   The catch rate of 169 fish/hr was 2 ? times greater than the average catch rate for Montrose Area lakes.  Largemouth bass sampled ranged in length from 5 to 16 inches with an average length of 11 inches.   Anglers have reported that bass fishing is excellent in Sugar Lake. <br> \n <br> \nSugar Lake has abundant populations of bluegills and a smaller population of black crappies.  Few quality size bluegills can be found in Sugar Lake.  Only one fish larger than eight inches was captured with trap nets during the summer survey.   The average size of the bluegills was six inches.   Black crappies are less abundant but the average size is greater.  Crappies up to 13 inches were captured and the average size was nine inches. <br> \n <br> \nOther species taken during the survey were bowfin, hybrid, green and pumpkinseed sunfish, rock bass, white sucker, black, brown and yellow bullheads.  <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

Since 2015, Muskellunge fingerlings have been stocked annually as opposed to biennially (2004 - 2014), while Walleye fingerlings have been stocked annually since 2005. There are two public accesses on the lake, one each on the north and south ends of the lake. The access on the south end is the larger of the two with enough parking spaces for 18 vehicle-trailer combinations. In 2007, experimental fishing regulations were put in place for Northern Pike and Black Crappie. An assessment conducted in early spring was used to evaluate the effects of these regulations as well as to estimate the adult Muskellunge population size for Sugar Lake.  <br> \n <br> \nFifty-five Muskellunge were sampled using large frame trap nets during the spring and marked with a pelvic fin clip and a passive integrated transponder (PIT) tag. The Muskellunge population was estimated to be 116 adults (30 inches or larger). This estimate (0.11/acre) was less than the previous estimates of 2016 (0.15/acre), 2012 (0.22/acre), and 2007 (0.26/acre) and well below the management goals for a low-density Muskellunge population (0.2 - 0.4/acre). The decreasing population trend of adult Muskellunge and lack of juvenile fish observed on Sugar Lake has also been observed in other lakes with mature populations even in cases where stocking rates have remained consistent. Muskellunge sampled during the spring assessment ranged in length from 34 to 54 inches with a mean length of 44 inches. For the fourth consecutive survey fish over 50 inches were sampled. <br> \n <br> \nSugar Lake has been plagued by high Northern Pike abundance dating back to the 1970's. In an attempt to improve the size structure in Sugar Lake, a special 24- to 36-inch protected slot limit was implemented in 2007.The size of Northern Pike seems to be improving. The catch in 2023 was lower than 2016 although much of this decrease could be explained by the unusually late ice-out and rapid warmup observed in 2023. Results from the spring targeted survey were encouraging given the fact that 20% of the Northern Pike sampled were larger than 24 inches and 12% were larger than 30 inches in length. These values are higher than in each of the previous 14 ice-out assessments dating back to 1976 which is a significant indicator that the special pike regulation is having a positive impact on medium to large fish. <br> \n <br> \nSugar Lake has a reputation of being a good crappie lake and can receive relatively high fishing pressure especially during late winter and early spring. Past angler surveys have indicated relatively high harvest pressure as well. The goal of the special crappie regulation was to redistribute the harvest over a longer period of time and to protect the existing size structure. Nearly 3,000 Black Crappie were sampled during the spring survey with fish up to 15 inches in length being sampled. After 16 years with the reduced bag limit on Black Crappie, it appears that the regulation is helping protect the size structure of the crappie population. The average size of Black Crappie has increased from 8.2 inches to 9.4 inches and the percentage of crappies larger than 10 inches has increased from 27% in 2007 to 50% in 2023. <br> \n <br> \nTwo hundred and seven Walleye were sampled during the spring assessment and marked with a pelvic fin clip. Walleye sampled ranged in length from 12 - 31.5 inches with a mean length of 21 inches. The size structure of the Walleye population in Sugar Lake appears to have remained remarkably consistent over the last 25 years, consistently producing some of the largest Walleye sampled in the Sauk Rapids management area.   <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Sugar Lake is a 1,015 acre lake located five miles north of the City of Annandale in northern Wright County. The lake has excellent water quality and is a popular recreation lake. Sugar Lake has a maximum depth of 69 feet and an average water clarity of ten feet. Sugar Lake was designated for Muskellunge management in 1967 and is primarily managed for Muskellunge, Walleye, and Northern Pike. Since 2015, Muskellunge fingerlings have been stocked annually as opposed to every other year (2004 - 2014), while Walleye fingerlings are stocked annually. There are two public accesses on the lake, one each on the north and south ends of the lake. The access on the south end is the larger of the two with enough parking spaces for 18 vehicle-trailer combinations. In 2007, experimental fishing regulations were put in place for Northern Pike and Black Crappie. An Ice-Out assessment conducted in early spring was used to evaluate the effects of these regulations as well as to estimate the adult Muskellunge population size for Sugar Lake.  <br> \n <br> \nSeventy-three Muskellunge were sampled using large frame trap nets during the spring and were marked with a pelvic fin clip and a passive integrated transponder (PIT) tag. Recapture efforts were conducted on May 2, May 4, and May 5. A total of 34 fish > 30 inches were sampled during night electrofishing of which 16 were previously marked. The Muskellunge population was estimated to be 150 adults (30 inches or larger). This estimate (0.15 fish/acre) is less than the 2012 estimate (0.22 fish/acre) and is below the management objective for low density Muskellunge populations in Minnesota (0.2 - 0.4 fish/acre). Muskellunge ranged in length from 35 to 53 inches and averaged 44.5 inches and 24.4 pounds in weight. For the third consecutive survey fish over 50 inches were sampled. Sampled Muskellunge ranged in age from 4-15 years with the 2004, 2006, and 2008 year classes representing 79 percent of the sample. <br> \n <br> \nSugar Lake has been plagued by high Northern Pike abundance dating back to a least the 1970's. The Northern Pike population continues to be abundant (20 adults/ acre) with high numbers of small fish. The catch in 2016 was higher than 2012 and continues to be above expected values for similar lakes. The average length and weight of Northern Pike has changed little since 1998 and remain small (19 inches and 1.7 pounds, respectively). Results from the spring targeted survey were more encouraging given the fact that 18% of the Northern Pike sampled were larger than 24 inches and 8 % were larger than 30 inches in length. These values are higher than in each of the previous 13 ice-out assessments dating back to 1976 which is a significant indicator that the special pike regulation is having a positive impact on medium to large fish. <br> \n <br> \nSugar Lake has a reputation of being a good crappie lake and can receive relatively high fishing pressure especially during late winter and early spring. Past angler surveys have indicated relatively high harvest pressure as well. The goal of the special crappie regulation was to redistribute the harvest over a longer period of time and to protect the existing size structure. Nearly 1,800 Black Crappie were sampled in the spring survey with fish up to 15 inches in length. After 10 years of the reduced bag limit on Black Crappie, it appears that the regulation is helping protect the size structure of the Black Crappie population. The average size of Black Crappie has increased from 8.2 inches to 9.5 inches and the percentage of crappies larger than 10 inches has increased from 27% in 2007 to 61% in 2016. <br> \n <br> \nTullibee (Cisco) have the potential to be a very important prey source for predator species in Sugar Lake. Eighteen Tullibee (Cisco) were sampled in the spring survey, the first time since 1998. Tullibee (Cisco) ranged in length from 6 to 15 inches, indicating that multiple year classes were present. Tullibee (Cisco) are very sensitive to water temperatures above 68?F and begin to experience stress when the dissolved oxygen drops to approximately 3.0 mg/L. Protecting water quality in Sugar Lake needs to be a priority in order to provide the thermal habitat necessary for Tullibee (Cisco) to continue to survive in Sugar Lake. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>The catch from 1998 gill net nets consisted of three target fish species: Northern Pike (22.1/net), Walleye (5.6/net), Yellow Perch (2.6/net) and several non-target species: Bluegill (12.4/net), Hybrid Sunfish (13.5/net), and Pumpkinseed (4.1/net). Northern Pike abundance was three times the highest expected value, Walleye abundance was slightly higher than expected values and Yellow Perch abundance was slightly below expected values for lakes similar to Sugar Lake.The gill net catch rate for Northern Pike increased from 16.2/net in 1992 to 22.1/net in 1998; however, average weight per fish decreased from 2.1 pounds to 1.6 pounds.  Northern Pike sampled in 1998 ranged in length from 11.2 to 30.1 inches, with an average length of 19.3 inches. Growth was above average for Minnesota lakes as most of the fish sampled were Age 1, 2, and 3 that reached 12.0, 15.6, and 17.9 inches, respectively.  A mark-recapture population estimate showed that 26,004 Northern Pike between 11.2 and 30.1 inches were present in Sugar Lake during 1998.  The 1998 creel survey on Sugar Lake indicated an overall angler catch rate of 0.20 Northern Pike/hour, (SE 0.02), while anglers who targeted Northern Pike caught 0.39 fish/hour.  The overall angler catch rate and the catch rate for anglers targeting Northern Pike were twice the average for similar lakes.  All anglers caught an estimated total of 8,417 Northern Pike, and harvested 945 Northern Pike.  The gill net catch rate for Walleye increased from 4.3/net in 1992 to 5.6/net in 1998; however, average weight per fish decreased from 3.3 pounds to 1.7 pounds.  Walleye caught in 1998 ranged in length from 10.7 to 26.2 inches, with an average length of 16.5 inches.  Growth was above average for Age 2 and 4 as fish reached 12.1 and 16.0 inches, respectively, while growth was below average for fish that reached 18.0, 21.7, and 27.7 inches by Age 6, 8 and 12, respectively.  Walleye fingerlings were stocked in Sugar Lake in 1988, 1990, 1992, 1994, 1996 and 1998, and survival was observed for most stocked year classes in the 1998 sample.  A mark-recapture population estimate indicated that 894 Walleye between 15 and 22 inches were present in Sugar Lake during 1998.  The overall angler catch rate of 0.01 Walleye/hour, and the catch rate of anglers who targeted Walleye of 0.05 fish/hour, as determined from the 1998 creel survey, was lower than average catch rates for similar lakes.  All anglers caught an estimated total of 563 Walleye and harvested 333 Walleye.The gill net catch rate for Yellow Perch increased from 1.7/net in 1992, to 2.6/net in 1998 and average weight per fish increased from 0.08 to 0.11 pounds, respectively.  Yellow Perch sampled in 1998 ranged in length from 5.8 to 7.2 inches, with an average length of 6.3 inches.  Yellow Perch growth was average compared with other Minnesota lakes as Age 3, 4, and 5 individuals reached 6.3, 7.0, and 8.5 inches, respectively. Catches from trap nets in 1998 consisted of four primary fish species: Bluegill (50.0/net), Hybrid Sunfish (15.4/net), Pumpkinseed (4.2/net), and Green Sunfish (1.4/net).  Bluegill and Pumpkinseed numbers were slightly higher than expected values for lakes similar to Sugar Lake, while Green Sunfish abundance was well above the expected range. The trap net catch for Bluegill increased from 42.1/net in 1992 to 50.0/net in 1998; however, average weight remained similar at 0.10 pounds.  Bluegill caught in 1998 ranged in length from 2.6 to 7.8 inches, with an average length of 4.9 inches.  Growth was above average as Age 1, 2, 4 and 5 fish reached 3.1, 4.2, 6.5, and 7.3 inches, respectively.  Representatives from the 1995 and 1996 year classes were most abundant in the 1998 survey.  The trap net catch for Pumpkinseed decreased from 6.1/net in 1992 to 4.2/net in 1998.  Fish caught in 1998 ranged in length from 2.8 to 6.2 inches, with an average length of 4.6 inches.  The trap net catch rate for Hybrid Sunfish increased from 7.4/net in 1992 to 15.4/net in 1998.  Hybrid Sunfish caught in 1998 ranged in length from 3.1 to 8.1 inches, with an average length of 5.3 inches.  The 1998 creel survey indicated a combined angler catch rate for Bluegill, Pumpkinseed, and Hybrid Sunfish of 0.62 fish/hour, which was equal to the angler catch rate of sunfish for similar lakes.  All anglers caught an estimated total of 26,090 sunfish, and harvested 7,128 sunfish.Although electrofishing has been considered the preferred method used to sample Largemouth Bass, the spring trap net survey on Sugar Lake revealed a quality length frequency distribution and relative abundance.  The trap nets captured 62 Largemouth Bass that ranged in length from 7.1 to 17.1 inches, with an average length of 13.3 inches.  Of the catchable Largemouth Bass (larger than 8 inches), 75% were larger than 12 inches, and the percentage larger than 15 inches was 29%.  Largemouth Bass growth was average compared with other Minnesota lakes.  The largest portion of the sample contained individuals from the 1992 year class, with an average length of 14.3 inches. Other strong year classes were observed from 1991, 1994 and 1997.  The 1998 creel survey on Sugar Lake indicated an overall angler catch rate of 0.13 Largemouth Bass/hour, while anglers who targeted Largemouth Bass caught 0.45 fish/hour.  The overall angler catch rate and the catch rate for anglers targeting Largemouth Bass were slightly above the average angler catch rates for similar lakes.  All anglers caught an estimated total of 5,489 Largemouth Bass, and harvested 522 Largemouth Bass.Spring trap nets captured 212 Black Crappie, with a catch rate of 2.5/net.  Black Crappie sampled in 1998 ranged in length from 5.9 to 12.9 inches, with an average length of 9.7 inches.  Growth was below average compared with other Minnesota lakes as fish reached 5.8, 7.8, 8.7, 9.8, 10.7, and 11.5 inches by Age 2 through 7, respectively.  The 1998 creel survey indicated an overall angler catch rate of 0.01 Black Crappie/hour, while anglers who targeted Black Crappie caught 0.35 fish/hour.  The overall angler catch rate and the catch rate for anglers targeting Black Crappie were below the average catch rates for similar lakes.  All anglers caught an estimated total of 422 Black Crappie (SE 175), and harvested 284 Black Crappie (SE 167).  Muskellunge were caught using spring trap nets. Trap nets captured a total of 40 Muskellunge, with a catch rate of 0.46/net.  Muskellunge in 1998 ranged in length from 11.2 to 46.3 inches, with an average length of 33.8 inches.  Growth was average compared with other Minnesota lakes as Age 8, 9, 10, and 11 individuals reached 38.4, 42.3, 43.3, and 46.1 inches, respectively. Muskellunge fingerlings were stocked in Sugar Lake in 1987, 1988, 1989 through 1992, and 1994 through 1998 and survival was evident from the stockings prior to 1990. The 1998 creel survey estimated an overall angler catch rate of 0.01 Muskellunge/hour, while the catch rate for anglers targeting Muskellunge was 0.03 fish/hour.  The overall angler catch rate and the catch rate for anglers targeting Muskellunge were comparable to the average catch rates for similar lakes.  An estimated total of 563 (SE 120) Muskellunge were caught, and 10 (SE 10) were harvested.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Sugar Lake is a 1,015-acre lake located five miles north of the City of Annandale in northern Wright County. The lake has excellent water quality and is a popular recreation lake. Sugar Lake has a maximum depth of 69 feet and an average summer water clarity of 13 feet. Oxygen was adequate for sport fish to a depth of 33 feet during the third week of July. Sugar Lake has a moderate sized watershed (6,691 acres); land use practices within the watershed consist of agriculture (30%), open water (20%), forest (17%), hay/pasture (13%), grassland (2%), wetland (12%), and residential (6%). There are two public accesses on the lake, one each on the north and south ends of the lake. The access on the south end is the larger of the two with enough parking spaces for 18 vehicle-trailer combinations. The lake was designated for Muskellunge management in 1967 and is also managed for Walleye, and Northern Pike. The Walleye and Muskellunge populations are managed through annual fingerling stocking. In 2007, experimental fishing regulations were put in place for Northern Pike (24 to 36-inch protected slot) and Black Crappie (five fish daily bag limit). In 2021, a standard lake survey was completed to monitor changes in the fishery since the last survey conducted in 2016.  <br> \n <br> \nSugar Lake has a diverse aquatic plant community with previous surveys identifying up to 35 species of aquatic plants present with coontail, Illinois pondweed, Chara, northern milfoil, sago pondweed and water celery being the most common. Emergent and floating leaved plants were mapped in 2016 and found covering about 22% of the shoreline. Species mapped included: cattail (49 acres), white water lily (21 acres), yellow water lily (12 acres), wild rice (12 acres), and bulrush (11 acres). Eurasian milfoil, and zebra mussels are present in the lake and users should be careful not to spread these invasive species to other lakes. <br> \n <br> \nSugar Lake has been plagued by high Northern Pike abundance dating back to the 1970's. Northern Pike continue to be abundant with high numbers of small fish. Although the catch in 2021 was lower than 2016, the catch rate of pike continues to be above expected values for similar lakes. The average length and weight of Northern Pike has changed little since 1998 and remains small (18 inches and 1.4 pounds, respectively). Results from the last spring targeted survey completed in 2016 were more encouraging given the fact that 18% of the Northern Pike sampled were larger than 24 inches and 8% were larger than 30 inches in length. These values are higher than any of the previous 13 ice-out assessments dating back to 1976 indicating that the special pike regulation is having a positive impact on medium to large size fish. The Northern Pike population as well as competitors like walleye would benefit from additional angler harvest of smaller pike. <br> \n <br> \nThe Walleye catch (2.1/ gill net) was lower than 2016 (3.3/ gill net) but was still within the range of expected values for similar lakes. Since 1971, the Walleye catch has always been within the normal range of expected values for Sugar Lake, exceeding it only in 1986. The average catch across all years is 4.1/gill net. Walleye ranged in length from 11 to 24 inches with an average length of 17 inches. Growth of Walleye was fast compared to statewide averages as Walleye reach 16 inches in three years. <br> \n <br> \nOpen water (pelagic) forage species continue to be rare in Sugar Lake. No White Sucker have been sampled since 1998 and have been below the expected values for the lake class since 1971. Catches of Yellow Perch remain low and have not changed appreciably since 2007. Apart from 1998, Yellow Perch catches have been below the expected values in all previous lake surveys since 1971. No Tullibee (Cisco) were sampled in the 2021 survey, however they were sampled as recently as 2016. Tullibee (Cisco) have the potential to be a very important prey source for predator species in Sugar Lake. Tullibee (Cisco) are very sensitive to water temperatures above 68?F and begin to experience stress when the dissolved oxygen drops below 5 mg/L. Protecting water quality in Sugar Lake needs to be a priority in order to provide the thermal habitat necessary for Tullibee (Cisco) to survive in Sugar Lake. <br> \n <br> \nThere is an excellent Largemouth Bass population in Sugar Lake however the average size is small. During daytime electrofishing in early June, the catch rate was higher than the average daytime catch rate for lakes in the Sauk Rapids Management Area but significantly less than in 2016 when sampling for bass was conducted at night. Lengths ranged from 5 to 20 inches with an average length of 11 inches. Only 2% of Largemouth Bass sampled were 15 inches or longer. Given the high number of small bass, anglers are encouraged to harvest some smaller bass and release larger fish. <br> \n <br> \nSugar Lake has an abundant population of Bluegill and a smaller population of Black Crappie. There are a few quality size Bluegills found in Sugar Lake, as 3% of the Bluegills sampled were 8 inches or longer however anglers may have to do some sorting in order to keep a meal of sunfish.  Bluegill ranged in length from 2 to 9 inches with an average length of 6 inches. Black Crappies are less abundant, but fish up to 13 inches were sampled in the summer survey. In 2021, a targeted spring assessment was not conducted, however results from the 2016 spring assessment where nearly 1800 crappie were sampled were encouraging; the average size of Black Crappie was 9.5 inches and 61% of crappies were larger than 10 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled during the survey were: Black Bullhead, Bowfin, Brown Bullhead, Green Sunfish, Hybrid Sunfish, Pumpkinseed Sunfish, Rock Bass, and Yellow Bullhead. <br> \n</p>",
