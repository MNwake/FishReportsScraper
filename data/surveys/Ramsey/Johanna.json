LMB NUMBERS SLIGHTLY BELOW AVERAGE; THREE AGE GROUPS WERE REPRESENTED (II,III,IV).  GROWTH OF BASS WERE BELOW AVERAGE TO ANNULUS III, THEN ADVANCED TO SLIGHTLY ABOVE AVERAGE BY ANNULUS IV.  PANFISH NUMBERS RANGED FROM HIGH (BLG) TO AVERAGE (HSF AND YEP) TO LOW (PMK AN BLC); PANFISH SIZE WAS GENERALLY SMALL. BLB WERE SEEN IN AVERAGE NUMBERS AND SIZE.  LOW NUMBERS OF SMALL YEB WERE SAMPLED.  AVERAGE SIZED SUCKERS WERE NETTED.  LOW NUMBERS OF CARP WERE SAMPLED.  YOY BLG, LMB, AND BLC WERE SAMPLED WITH THE SEINE.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Johanna is a 213 acre, eutrophic lake, located in Arden Hills, northwest of St. Paul. It is in lake class 24 and is managed primarily for Walleyes and Hybrid Muskellunge. Walleye fingerling stocking changed in 2017 from a rate of 2 pounds/littoral-acre every other year to annual stocking of fingerlings at a rate of 0.65 pounds/littoral-acre. This change in stocking will be evaluated by extra gill net assessments to determine if the population can be maintained at this lower level of stocking. Hybrid Muskellunge fingerlings are stocked every other year (even numbered years) at a rate of 4.5 fish/littoral-acre (432 fish). Overall, water quality in Lake Johanna is very good and has one of the lowest levels of phosphorus concentrations in the Rice Creek Watershed District. <br> \n <br> \nThe 2017 survey was a gill net only survey to assess the Walleye population. Walleye were sampled at a rate of 1.50 fish per gill net which is in the normal range for lake class 24. The average Walleye was 16.5 inches long. Walleyes were aged and found to all be from four different stocking events. It doesn't appear that any natural reproduction is occuring in Lake Johanna.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike were sampled at the highest levels recorded for Lake Johanna at 15.33 fish per gill net. The average pike was 24.5 inches. Two Tiger Muskellunge were captured in the gill nets during the survey. They measured 36.7 inches and 39.0 inches and both were released alive back into the lake. Lake Johanna is in the North-Central Zone and which allows a harvest of 10 fish, with 2 allowed over 26 inches, and a protected slot between 22 and 26 inches. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie and Yellow Perch were sampled in low numbers and were also small in size, both having average lenghts under 7 inches. <br> \n <br> \nTable 1.

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Johanna is a 213-acre, eutrophic lake located in Arden Hills, 7.5 miles northwest of St. Paul. The contributing watershed is characterized by residential, commercial, industrial and major roadways. Overall, water quality in Lake Johanna is very good.  The most recent data indicates that it is one of the best lakes in the Rice Creek Watershed District in terms of phosphorus concentrations.  Ramsey County has maintained a very popular 217-acre park which is bounded by Lake Johanna and County Road E to the south.  The park includes ? mile of shoreline on the north side of Lake Johanna.  Surface water use of this lake is very high.  The 1994 creel survey estimated fishing use at 62-angler hours/acre.  Ramsey County has established surface water use restrictions that limit the hours, watercraft speed, and nature of surface water use allowed. <br> \n <br> \nLake Johanna is primarily for Walleyes and Tiger Muskellunge. Walleyes were captured at a rate of 2.50 fish/gill net. Walleyes captured during this assessment averaged 19.1 inches in total length, and 93% of Walleye captured during the survey were 15 inches or larger. A total of three Tiger Muskellunge were captured during this assessment. Tiger Muskellunge averaged 29 inches in total length. The largest Tiger Muskellunge sampled was 43 inches. Northern Pike were captured at the second highest rate of abundance ever at 10.2/gill net. Northern Pike in gill nets averaged 22.4 inches, and 16% of pike captured were 26 inches or larger. Lake Johanna is in the North Central Northern Pike Management Zone which has a protected slot of 22-26 inches and a harvest limit of two fish not longer than 26 inches and a ten fish limit under 22inches. Yellow Perch were sampled at the lowest abundance ever observed on Lake Johanna of one per gill net. Yellow Perch lengths ranged from 5.1 to 7.5 inches. For the last 20 years Bluegill trap net abundance has decreased every survey from 223.2 in 2001, to 18.1 fish/trap net in 2021. Average total length of Bluegills in trap nets was 4.4 inches.  Black Crappies relative abundance has been consistent in gill nets and increased in trap nets from the previous surveys in 2014 and 2017. Average length of Black Crappie in gill nets was 5.4 inches and 4.8 inches in trap nets. Although gill nets and trap nets are not the best way to assess Largemouth Bass, seven were sampled in trap and gill nets. Other species captured during this survey in low numbers were Bowfin, Golden Shiners, Hybrid Sunfish, Pumpkinseed, and Yellow Bullheads. <br> \n</p>",

The population of this species has been variable. The average length sampled was slightly larger than 7 inches. Walleye were sampled in average numbers for this type of lake. Half the walleyes caught were 20 inches and longer. Northern pike were abundant when compared to historical levels on this lake. The average size caught was 26.62 inches and 4.37 pounds. Over 70% of the pike sampled exceeded 25 inches. Yellow perch were found to be abundant but small.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Johanna is a 213-acre eutrophic lake located in Arden Hills, 7.5 miles northwest of St. Paul. The contributing watershed is characterized by residential, commercial, industrial and major roadways. Its lake class ID is 24 and is managed primarily for Walleyes and Tiger Muskellunge. Walleye fingerlings are stocked every other year at a rate of 2 pounds/littoral-acre and Tiger Muskellunge fingerlings are stocked every other year at a rate of 4.5 fish/littoral-acre (426 fish). Walleyes were captured at a rate of 2.50 fish/gill net. Walleyes captured during this assessment averaged 14.25 inches in total length and weighed an average of 1.16 pounds, 43% of Walleye captured during the survey were 15 inches or larger. A total of six Tiger Muskellunge were captured during this assessment. Tiger Muskellunge captured in gill nets averaged 26.02 inches in total length and 4.44 pounds. The one captured in a trap net was 43.31 inches. Northern Pike were captured at the second highest rate of abundance ever at 7.00 fish/gill net. Northern Pike sampled in the gill nets averaged 24.13 inches and 3.65 pounds, 56% of pike captured were 26 inches or larger. Although gill nets and trap nets are not the best way to assess Largemouth Bass, three were sampled in trap nets and seven were sampled in gill nets. Yellow Perch were sampled at about the same abundance as the previous survey. Average total length of perch in gill nets was 6.26 inches. Bluegills trap net abundance has decreased from 115.33 fish/trap net in 2008, to 27.22 fish/trap net during this assessment. Average total length of Bluegills in trap nets was 5.10 inches. Black Crappies abundance increased in gill nets and decreased in trap nets from the previous survey in 2008. Average total length of crappie in gill nets was 7.00 inches and in trap nets was 6.92 inches. Other species captured during this survey in low numbers were Bowfin, Golden Shiners, Hybrid Sunfish, Pumpkinseed, White Suckers and Yellow Bullheads.</p>",

Black crappies were sampled in below average abundance and size. Walleye were sampled in moderate numbers. Nearly half the walleyes sampled exceeded 20 inches in length. Northern pike were found in average numbers for this lake. The average size caught was 25.9 inches in length and 4.21 pounds. Black bullhead and yellow bullhead were each sampled.

One third of the bluegill were over 6 inches in length while all crappie were under 8 inches in length.  Yellow perch were also abundant, with none over 8 inches.  A small number of pumpkinseed, hybrid, and green sunfish were sampled, all small in size.Largemouth bass numbers appear to be good, with a variety of sizes of fish present.  Northern pike numbers were fair, with a number of large individuals, the largest over 16 pounds.  Walleye were average in number, with nearly half over 20 inches in length.  Several tiger muskellunge from the 1996 fall stocking were sampled, as well as one measuring 35.2 inches from the 1993 stocking.Black and yellow bullhead numbers were low, with large individuals present.  Carp numbers were average.  Several white sucker, dogfish, and golden shiner were sampled.</p>",
