Three types of nets were used to sample a range of depths and fish sizes.The walleye catch was lower than in previous surveys of Squint Lake, but was above the middle of the normal range for lakes of this class.  Average size was typical for this lake and normal for the lake class.  Several walleye exceeded 20 inches in length.  Seven ages were identified, and all had resulted from natural reproduction.  Growth rates had been about average for area lakes.  On average, walleye reached 12 inches by age 3, 13 inches by age 4, and 17.5 inches by age 7.Several species were collected that could provide forage for walleye.  The number and size of yellow perch were at the low end of the normal range for the lake class.  A few perch may reach a size that anglers would keep.  White sucker were fairly large.  White sucker abundance was higher than in past surveys but normal for the lake class.  A small number of common shiner and green sunfish were also collected.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>This survey was scheduled because lands on Squint Lake had recently been opened for new development, and there were concerns about the effects that might have on water quality, fish habitat, and fish populations in this lake.  The last full survey of Squint Lake had been done in 2002. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye remained fairly abundant in Squint Lake in 2013, although the gill net catch was the lowest ever observed in the lake.  Walleye catch and size goals from the current (2003) lake management plan (8.0 fish/gill net, some fish over 20 inches present) were not met.  The walleye population was self-sustained, with seven naturally-produced year classes contributed to the catch.  None of those appeared to have been strong, although the capture of some one-year-old fish, not normally collected in high numbers in standard nets, may have indicated some strength for the 2012 year class.  Walleye growth had been about average.  Fish reached a mean length of 13.3 inches by the end of their fourth year, compared to an area average of 13.9 inches. <br> \n <br> \nThe presence of relatively high numbers of northern pike in Squint Lake marked a major change in the fish community.  No northern pike had previously been collected in this lake; they were first reported by an angler in 2007.  Northern pike may have entered the lake from Road Lake, where they first appeared in 2003, following what was probably an illegal stocking.  The 2013 gill net catch in Squint Lake was near the upper end of the normal range for a lake of this type, but few fish over 20 inches in length were present.  Three year classes contributed to the gill and trap net catch, with no fish older than four years collected.  Growth of young northern pike had been about average; fish reached a mean length of 14.3 inches by the end of their second year, compared to an area mean of 13.6 inches. <br> \n <br> \nForage for northern pike and walleye was provided by yellow perch.  White sucker had also been present in this lake in the past, but none were taken in 2013.  The yellow perch gill net catch was within the normal range for a lake of this class, and was similar to the catch observed in 2002.  Few of the yellow perch collected in 2013 would have been large enough to have been of much interest to anglers. <br> \n <br> \nWater quality in Squint lake remained high in 2013, and values for various chemical parameters tested were similar to those obtained in 2002.  Squint Lake would be considered a softwater lake with low productivity, based on testing done in 2002 and 2013.   Squint Lake supported a diverse aquatic plant community in 2013, as it did in 2002, and no exotic species were found. <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n</p>",
