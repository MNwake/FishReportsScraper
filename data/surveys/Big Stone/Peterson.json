Like many lakes in the region, its depth has increased greatly following several years of abundant rainfall.  No gamefish were caught during the 1998 assessment.  However, fathead minnows and brook stickleback were abundant.  Peterson Lake has suitable habitat for game fish management and it will be stocked with black crappie during the spring of 1999.  Angling opportunities for panfish are limited in the area, and many anglers have expressed a desire for a greater emphasis on panfish management.</p>",
