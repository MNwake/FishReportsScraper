                "narrative": "<p>Big Bass lake is located 7 miles northeast of Bemidji off County Road 20.  The public access is off Big Bass Lake Road and has a parking capacity of about 8 rigs.  The access ramp is fairly steep but it is blacktopped and adequate for most cars. There is a small dock at the access that provides shore fishing opportunities.  Big Bass is in lake class 35 which is a group of lakes typically described as very irregular in shape with a high percentage of littoral area (water less than 15 feet deep).  There are about 45 lakes in this class with primary distribution through north-central Minnesota.  Other Bemidji area lakes in this class include Little Bass, Gull, Stump, and Rabideau.   Primary fish management on this lake is for walleye with fingerlings stocked every third year to supplement natural reproduction.  The Beltrami County Soil and Water Conservation District, in cooperation with a private landowner, has replanted a small area of bulrush in the north basin of the lake in an attempt to reduce shoreline erosion.  Water levels in 1997 were very high, probably due to outlet blockage by beavers and heavy rainfalls.  It is suspected the frequent high waters in recent years has contributed to the loss of bulrush and subsequent shoreline erosion.  Although Big Bass Lake is best known for its bluegill, crappie and northern pike fishing, the 1997 assessment found an excellent population of walleye for a lake of this type. Size ranged from 12.8-29.3 inches with most walleye between 13- 16 inches long and weighing about 1 pound.   Northern pike are slightly above the normal abundance for this lake class though the population appears to be lower than during the 1982 or 1987 assessments.  The average size of 22 inches and about 2.5 pounds makes them acceptable to most anglers.  The largest pike sampled was 31.2 inches and weighed 5.8 pounds.  About one-fourth of the pike examined had Neascus or black spot, a common parasite on fish that does not affect people.   Largemouth bass are not usually sampled very well with standard survey nets.  For this assessment bass were sampled by electrofishing, a method of sampling that stuns the fish with an electric current so they can be captured by dip-netting.  About half of the bass captured were three years old and about 10 inches long though bass to 18.4 inches were sampled.   Bluegill are the most abundant game fish species in the lake and are attractive to many anglers.  The average size of bluegill sampled was 7 inches and one-third pound.  The largest bluegill was 9.7 inches long.  A few bluegill have the parasite Neascus.  Pumpkinseed and hybrid sunfish are also present with an average length of 6.5 inches.   Black crappie populations fluctuate depending on spawning conditions or survival of young.  The crappie population in 1997 was near the average for comparable lakes with all of the fish captured between 7-9 inches in length and three or four years old.   Yellow perch are near average in abundance for this lake class with an average length of  of 7.0 inches.  Averaging less than two-tenths of a pound they are not acceptable to most anglers.   A few brown bullheads are present, but probably not enough to make them a target for anglers.  White suckers are common in the lake and can be a good source of forage for other fish but they are not readily available to anglers.   In general, Big Bass Lake provides a diverse fishery with good size and abundance of a variety of game fish species.  Protection of water quality and shoreline habitats will ensure that its status is maintained.  The contribution of walleye natural reproduction, combined with periodic fingerling stocking, should continue to maintain that component of the fishery.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Big Bass Lake is a 337-acre lake, located 6 miles northeast of Bemidji in southern Beltrami County. A targeted survey was completed on Big Bass Lake by Bemidji Area Fisheries staff during July of 2022 to assess the nearshore fish community and overall health of the lake. <br> \n <br> \nIn this survey, 10 nearshore sites (100-foot) were evenly spaced along the lakeshore to sample a variety of aquatic habitat types and collect a representative sample of the nearshore fish community. Depending on the habitat conditions at each site, backpack electrofishing and shoreline seining were attempted where possible. A total of 9 sites were sampled with a seine, while backpack electrofishing was completed at all 10 sites. A total of 9 species were sampled, with no species were captured that are intolerant to disturbance or poor water quality. <br> \n <br> \nNearshore fish community data was analyzed with information collected from the standard survey in 2022 to calculate a Fish-based Index of Biotic Integrity (FIBI) score to measure the biological condition and overall health of Big Bass Lake. In Minnesota, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and healthy habitat (e.g. Blacknose Shiner, Mimic Shiner, Tullibee (cisco), and Mottled Sculpin), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g. Black Bullhead, Fathead Minnow, and Green Sunfish). The combination of fish species present may identify stressors negatively affecting the lake environment. The FIBI score is composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics to indicate the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. For additional information on FIBI search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources website (www.mndnr.gov).  <br> \n <br> \nResults of this survey indicate Big Bass is in great health with a FIBI score above the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes. In coordination with the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency, data from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Mississippi River (Headwaters) Watershed assessment. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Big Bass Lake is a 380-acre lake with a maximum depth of 17 feet.  The lake is located six miles northeast of Bemidji in southern Beltrami County.  There is a DNR public access on the south side of the lake off of Tall Pines Road.  The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different lake classes based on physical and chemical characteristics.  Big Bass Lake is in lake class 35.  Lakes in this lake class are typically small, irregularly shaped with a high percentage of the lake area less than 15 feet deep.   <br> \nOther area lakes in the same lake class include Rabideau, Gull, Stump, Larson Moose and Minnow Lakes.  Big Bass Lake is managed for northern pike, bluegill, walleye, largemouth bass and black crappie. <br> \n <br> \nThe Big Bass Lake shoreline has been intensively developed over the last 40 years. For example, in 1965 the first permanent home was built on the lake (Minnesota Pollution Control Agency - Lake Assessment Program Big Bass Lake 1995).  In the 1973 fisheries survey, 50 lake homes were counted and by 1997 this number had increased to 127.   <br> \n <br> \nThere is a history of water level fluctuations caused by blockages at the outlet to Bass Creek.  Water levels peaked at nearly 3 feet above the ordinary high water mark in 1999.  Modifications to the outlet allowed water levels to recede to normal levels. Sustained high water levels can impact types and abundance of both emergent and submerged aquatic plants, and contribute to shoreline erosion.  Since aquatic plants are extremely important in providing habitat and good water quality, significant alteration of these habitats can affect the entirefish community.  <br> \n <br> \nAs the name suggests, largemouth bass are an important species in Big Bass Lake. Bass abundance is good with plenty of natural reproduction.  Past electrofishing assessments specifically targeting bass have sampled a few individuals up to 19 inches, but the majority are less than 12 inches.  A special regulation was implemented in 2005 requiring total catch and release for all bass. This regulation is intended to improve size structure and increase the opportunity to catch large bass.    <br> \n <br> \nBluegill abundance in this assessment is below what was found 2002 but similar to other lake class 35 lakes.  However quality improved compared to the 2002 findings.  Fifty-four percent of the bluegill sampled in the 2007 assessment are  greater than seven inches long.  There has been consistent natural reproduction with ages 2-8 represented in the sample.  Considering the small size of the lake  and intense fishing pressure, it is uncertain how long the lake can sustain this quality bluegill fishery.  Quality-sized bluegill are disappearing from many of our lakes due to excessive harvest by anglers.  To maintain some quality in our bluegill populations, anglers would have to show some voluntary restraint when bluegill are biting well.  By practicing selective harvest, anglers can harvest the smaller more abundant bluegill for eating, and release more of the medium to large fish.  This would help maintain balance in the population and increase the opportunity to catch large bluegill in the future. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike are common in Big Bass Lake, though average size is generally small. Only seventeen percent of the pike sampled were greater than 24 inches.  This is typical of pike populations in smaller lakes with even moderate fishing pressure.  Reproduction is good, so there are always plenty of young pike present, but since they are very vulnerable to angling few survive long enough to reach the larger quality sizes.  Modification of four different road crossings on Bass Creek allows pike to move between Big Bass Lake and Lake Bemidji and access high quality spawning habitat throughout the Bass Creek flowage.   <br> \n <br> \n  Walleye are present in Big Bass Lake. There is evidence of some successful reproduction but is dependant on regular fingerling stocking to maintain desirable levels.  Walleye sampled in 2007 ranged in length from 10 to 23 inches with an average length and weight of 16 inches and 1.5 pounds. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie abundance is comparable to other lake class 35 lakes.  In 2007 crappie sampled ranged in length from 5 to 12 inches with an average length of six inches.  The 2005 year-class (age 2) made up 77% of the sampled crappie.   <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled include yellow perch, white sucker, brown bullhead, yellow bullhead, and pumpkinseed. <br> \n <br> \nBecause of the increasing development on Big Bass Lake and within the watershed, the water quality and shoreline habitat are being impacted.  Native shoreline vegetation provides habitat for fish and wildlife, filters harmful nutrients, and protects against shoreline erosion.  Lakeshore owners can minimize their impact on shoreline and maintain a more natural setting while actually decreasing annual maintenance.

                "narrative": "<p>Big Bass Lake is a popular fishing destination for panfish and bass in the Bemidji area.  Big Bass is a fertile, shallow lake with a maximum depth of only 17 feet that supports a variety of fish habitat and above average growth rates for most species.  There is one public access on the south side of the lake with room for 6-8 vehicles with trailers.   <br> \n <br> \nPrimarily managed for Bluegill, it's no surprise that this is one of the most abundant species in the lake.  The latest survey in 2017 captured 229 fish in trap nets that averaged 5.6 inches in length, but fish up to 10.4 inches were captured during the survey.  Bluegill production is consistent and several strong year classes were observed.   <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass are another abundant species in Big Bass Lake.  Electrofishing was used to target bass, with 249 fish captured over the course of three sampling events.  Lengths ranged from 2.3 to 18.9 inches with an average of 12.7 inches; 71% of all bass captured were over 12 inches in length.  The 2011 and 2012 year classes were most numerous.  Big Bass Lake previously had a special catch-and-release only regulation for bass, but that has been changed starting spring of 2018.  Under the current special regulation, Bass between 14\" and 20\" must be immediately released and only one over 20 inches is allowed in possession.  This regulation is designed to allow some harvest of smaller bass which will help maintain Bass growth rates. Protecting larger fish improves the quality of the Bass fishery, while providing some predation on young panfish to improve their growth rate as well. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye fingerlings are stocked in even numbered years to provide a greater diversity of angling opportunities in this panfish dominated lake.  A total of 15 were captured during the 2017 survey with lengths ranging from 12.6 to 22.8 inches and an overall average of 17.4 inches.  The return to fishery from fingerling stocking has been less than desirable, but the few fish that are present are growing well and stocking appears to be the main reason Walleyes are present.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike are very abundant and were found in sizes ranging from 13.4 to 33.1 inches with an average length of 22.1 inches in the gillnet portion of the survey.  Results from 2017 also showed that 25% of the pike captured were over 24 inches in length.  Exceptionally high pike abundance at over 17 per gill net set may be the major factor contributing to poor results from Walleye fingerling stocking.  This type of fishery is the perfect place for anglers to capitalize on the new expanded bag limit for small pike being implemented in 2018.  New regulations will allow harvest of up to 10 Northern Pike under 22\", and protection for growth between 22-26\".  The new regulations allows two of the 10 fish limit to be over 26 inches.    <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie are also a popular species in Big Bass Lake but are rarely captured in strong numbers during standard lake surveys which mean historical catches can be highly variable and difficult to compare.  The 2017 survey captured 37 crappies between 4.4 and 11.5 inches with an average of 6.8 inches; almost 20% of the catch was larger than 10 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nBig Bass Lake certainly contains a variety of species worth pursuing and on occasion can be a quiet hideaway when much of the local angling pressure is focused on nearby Lake Bemidji.   <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Big Bass Lake is a 380-acre lake with a maximum depth of 17 feet.  The size of the watershed that drains into the lake is 4,570 acres.  The watershed is characterized by forests (54%) and water (lakes and wetlands - 27%).  The lake is located six miles northeast of Bemidji in southern Beltrami County.  There is a DNR public access on the south side of the lake off of Tall Pines Road.  The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different lake classes based on physical and chemical characteristics.  Big Bass Lake is in lake class 35.  Lakes in this lake class are typically small, irregularly shaped and with a high percentage of the lake area less than 15 feet deep.  Other area lakes in the same lake class include Rabideau, Gull, Stump, Larson, Moose and Minnow Lakes.  Big Bass Lake is managed for northern pike, bluegill, walleye, largemouth bass and black crappie.Big Bass Lake was sampled by the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA) during the summer of 1995 as part of the Lake Assessment Program (LAP).  The main objective of this program is to assist lake associations or municipalities in the collection and analysis of baseline water quality data in order to assess the tophic status of their lake in respect to nutrient input.  The MPCA then made recommendations to maintain the water quality.There has been much development on the lake.  In 1965 the first permanent home was built on the lake (MPCA LAP Big Bass Lake 1995).  In the 1973 fisheries survey, 50 lake homes were counted.  By 1997 this number had increased to 127.  In the past there were some water level fluctuations in the lake because of blockage at the outlet to Lake Bemidji via Bass Creek.  Water levels peaked in 1999.  Modifications to the restricted outlet allowed water levels to recede.  Presently water levels are approximately three feet lower than in 1999.  Water level fluctuations of this magnitude can affect types and abundance of both emergent and submergent vegetation.  Since aquatic vegetation is extremely important in providing habitat and affecting water quality, some species may still be adjusting to the changes.The 2002 bluegill abundance was the second highest recorded and was well above what you would typically find in lake class 35 lakes and what was found in Big Bass Lake in 1997.  Along with this increase in abundance, there was a decrease in the size of bluegill.  However, bluegill > 8 inches did not change much.  If angling pressure is reducing quality, special regulations to limit harvest need to be considered.  Natural reproduction is consistent with representation from the first eight year classes.  Bluegill were also growing well.  Fish that were four years old were 6.5 inches long.As was found in previous surveys, northern pike are abundant.  In 2002, 25% of the sampled northern pike were greater than 24 inches in length.  Eight different year classes were evident.  New culverts at the outlet and additional modifications at other Bass Creek crossings are reducing impediments to movement of northern pike between Big Bass Lake and Lake Bemidji.  This will provide access to additional high quality spawning areas in the connected wetlands between the lakes.Walleye is another species that anglers will have success catching.  Walleye abundance is good, however, there has been a reduction in quality.  The average length and weight in the 2002 assessment was 16 inches and 1.5 pounds as compared to 1997 averages of 18 inches and two pounds.  Aging of the walleye sampled in 2002 indicates that 83% were from years when no stocking occurred.  Natural reproduction and stocking are contributing walleye to the fisheries.  Because of the increased development around the lake, it would be important to identify where walleye are spawning in order to protect these areas.Yellow perch is the primary forage fish for northern pike and walleye.  In 2002 they were sampled at an abundance that was typical of other lake class 35 lakes.  This was also the highest abundance found in any survey conducted on Big Bass Lake.  Perch ranged in length from 5.0 to 9.2 inches with an average length of 6.2 inches.White sucker is also available as a forage fish especially for the larger-sized predators.  They are abundant with most under ten inches long.A large sample of largemouth bass were captured ranging in length from 3 to 18 inches.  Most of the bass were under eight inches long.  Past high water levels could be favoring natural reproduction for bass.Anglers can help maintain or improve the quality of fishing by voluntary selective harvest.  Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for eating, but encourages release of larger sexually mature fish.  Releasing larger fish will help improve the quality of fishing in the future.  It will also help balance fish communities.Shoreline areas are important habitat for both fish and wildlife that live in or near our lakes.  Overdeveloped shorelines degrade both the habitat and water quality that are associated with natural undeveloped lakes.  The combined effects of all lakeshore owners \"fixing up\" their property can destroy a lake's valuable natural shorelines.  A shoreline consists of many parts such as aquatic plants, woody debris and natural lake bottom soils.  Shrubs, trees and woody debris such as fallen trees or limbs provide a good habitat both above and below the water and should be left in place.  Natural lake bottom materials like silt or gravel is more ecologically productive than pure sand trucked in for a swimming beach.  A tidy lawn and a sandy beach make great spots for sunbathing and swimming but do little to provide habitat for fish and wildlife.  By leaving a buffer strip of natural vegetation along the shoreline, property owners can reduce erosion, help maintain water quality and provide habitat and travel corridors for wildlife.Only if more lakeshore owners manage their shoreline in a natural condition can fish and wildlife populations on Minnesota lakes remain healthy and abundant.  More specific information on protecting or restoring shorelines and wateresheds is available at your area DNR Fisheries offices.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Big Bass Lake is a 380-acre lake with a maximum depth of 17 feet located 6 miles northeast of Bemidji in southern Beltrami County.  A DNR public water access is located on the south shore of the lake off of Tall Pines Road.  The shoreline is intensively developed with lake homes and cabins.  There is a special catch and release regulation in effect for largemouth bass.  Statewide fishing regulations apply to all other species. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass and bluegill are the primary management species on Big Bass Lake.  Bass anglers can expect steady action for largemouth bass in the 12 to 16-inch size range.  Big Bass Lake contains abundant submerged aquatic vegetation that provides good habitat for largemouth bass. <br> \n <br> \nBig Bass Lake has also been known to produce quality bluegill fishing, although the 2012 assessment showed a population that is currently dominated by smaller fish.  A large proportion of the bluegill sample was between 6.0 and 7.0 inches in length, and these fish have the potential to provide angling opportunity for quality-size bluegill in the near future. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike were abundant in the 2012 population assessment, with an impressive average length and weight of 23.9 inches and 3.0 pounds, respectively.  Forty two percent of the northern pike sample was greater than 24 inches, with pike up to 33 inches in length present. <br> \n <br> \nBig Bass Lake is also managed for walleye, which are stocked as fingerlings.  The 2012 walleye catch rate of 1.67/GN was within the normal range for class 35 lakes but fell below the long-term average.  Walleye captured in the assessment ranged up to 21.6 inches in length, with an average size of 16.6 inches and 1.65 pounds. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie numbers in Big Bass Lake have increased since the most recent assessment in 2007.  The black crappie catch rate of 5.67 fish/trap net is greater than the normal range for class 35 lakes.  Five consecutive year classes of black crappie were identified in the 2012 sample, compared to two year classes in the 2007 population assessment.  Young black crappie from the 2011 age class were particularly abundant in the sample, and anglers will start to notice these fish within the next few years. <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species captured in 2012 included pumpkinseed sunfish, white sucker, yellow perch, and brown bullhead. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Big Bass Lake is a 337-acre lake with a maximum depth of 17 feet located 6 miles northeast of Bemidji in Beltrami County.  A DNR public water access with concrete ramp and parking for 8 vehicles is located on the south shore of the lake off Tall Pines Road.  Special fishing regulations are in effect for sunfish (5 fish daily bag limit) and Largemouth Bass (14 to 20-inch protected slot limit).  Statewide regulations apply to all other species. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass and sunfish (including Bluegill) are the primary management species on Big Bass Lake.  Bass anglers can expect steady action for Largemouth Bass in the 12 to 16-inch size range.  The lake contains abundant submerged aquatic vegetation that provides excellent habitat for bass.   <br> \n <br> \nThe 2022 survey documented a healthy Bluegill population with net catches near historic high levels.  A good proportion (33%) of the Bluegill catch exceeded 7 inches in length with some fish approaching 9 inches.  Bluegill hybridize with Pumpkinseed and Green Sunfish in Big Bass Lake resulting in some beautifully colored fish that often grow to larger sizes than their parent species.      <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie numbers in Big Bass Lake have increased since the previous survey in 2017.  Most of the catch in this survey was comprised of smaller fish, indicating that the population is sustaining itself and has seen consistent reproduction in recent years.  Black crappie over 11 inches in length were captured in this survey. <br> \n <br> \nWhile Big Bass Lake is still a good bet for Northern Pike fishing, the quality of the population has declined over the past several surveys with a large increase in numbers (often a bad sign for pike populations), smaller average sizes and fewer large pike captured.   Pike captured in this survey had an average length of over 20 inches, with the largest measuring over 36 inches in length.   <br> \n <br> \nBig Bass Lake is also managed for Walleye and is stocked with fingerlings every other year.  Gill net catch rates for Walleye have been near the low end of the typical range for similar lakes over the past three surveys.  Walleye over 22 inches in length were captured in this survey with a respectable average size of just over 19 inches. <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species captured in the 2022 survey included White Sucker, Yellow Perch, and Brown Bullhead. <br> \n</p>",
