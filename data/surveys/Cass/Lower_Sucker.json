                "narrative": "<p>Lower Sucker lake is one of three lakes that drain into the Sucker River and ultimately into Leech Lake.  It is located 10 miles southeast of Cass Lake in northern Cass County.  There is a USFS public access on the south side of the lake off of Ketchum Road (Forest Road #2135).  The lake is within the Chippewa National Forest and the Leech Lake Indian Reservation.  Lower Sucker Lake has an area of 585 acres with a maximum depth of 35 feet.  The Minnesota DNR has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different lake classes based on chemical and physical characteristics.  Lower Sucker Lake is in lake class 27.  Lakes in this lake class are medium sized with moderate depths and moderate water clarity.  Other area lakes in the same lake class include Ada, Pleasant, Webb, Thirteen, and Crooked Lakes.  In the past, anglers fishing on Lower Sucker Lake have had good luck fishing for black crappie and northern pike.  The lake is managed primarily for black crappie and northern pike.Black crappie angling on Lower Sucker can best be described as boom and bust.  Production of year classes of black crappie is inconsistent - there often is several years where no reproduction takes place.  The reason for inconsistent black crappie reproduction is unknown.  When a year class is about six years old, it becomes acceptable to anglers and angling pressure and catch rates become high.  This year class is then harvested down in about two years and angling success becomes poor until the next year class is about six years old.  At present, there is an abundance of five to nine inch black crappie.Northern pike are abundant but small.  Their grown rate is typical compared to other lake class 27 lakes.Walleye abundance is the highest recorded and is typical of the area lakes in the same lake class.  There are several different age classes present in the sample which are the result of natural reproduction.Other panfish that anglers can fish for include yellow perch, bluegill, rock bass, and pumpkinseed sunfish.Other species sampled were largemouth bass, cisco (tullibee), black bullhead, brown bullhead, and yellow bullhead.Anglers can help maintain or improve the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for table fare, but encourages release of medium to large size fish.  Releasing medium to large size fish can help maintain balance in the fish community.Shoreline areas - on the land and into the shallow water - provide essential habitat for fish and wildlife that live in or near Minnesota's lakes.  Over-developed shorelines cannot support the fish wildlife, and clean water that are associated with natrual undeveloped lakes.  The combined effects of all lakeshore owners \"fixing up\" their property, can destroy a lake's valuable natural shorelines.Shoreline habitat consists of aquatic plants, woody plants, and natural lake bottom soils.  Plants in the water and at the water's edge provide habitat, prevent erosion, and absorb excess nutrients.  Shrubs, trees, and wood debris such as fallen trees or limbs provide good habitat both above and below the water and should be left in place.  Natural lake bottom materials like silt or gravel are more ecologically productive than pure sand trucked in for a swimming beach.  A tidy lawn and a sandy beach make great spots for sunbathing and swimming but do little to provide habitat for fish and wildlife.  By leaving a buffer strip of natural vegetation along the shoreline, property owners can reduce erosion, help maintain water quality, and provide habitat and travel corridors for wildlife.Only if more lakeshore owners manage their shoreline in a natural condition can fish and wildlife populations on Minnesota lakes remain healthy and abundant.  More specific information on protecting or restoring shorelines and watersheds is available though DNR Fisheries offices.</p>",

LOWER SUCKER LAKE HABITAT IS NOT WELL SUITED FOR NOTHERN CISCO.  THE POPULATION PRESENT MAY BE THE RESULT OF MIGRATION FROM LEECH LAKE.THE NORTHERN PIKE CPUE OF 8.4/GN IS WITHIN THE RANGE OF CPUE'S FOR MOST AREA LAKES.  QUALITY NORTHERN PIKE APPEAR TO BE ABUNDANT IN LOWER LUCKER LAKE; 6 OF THE 68 FISH CAPTURED WERE GREATER THAN 30 INCHES IN LENGTH.  THE AVERAGE WEIGHT OF NORTHERN PIKE CAPTURED WAS 2.9 POUNDS.  ALL YEAR CLASSES ABOVE I+ WERE WELL REPRESENTED INDICATING GOOD NATURAL REPRODUCTION AND RECRUITMENT.  GROWTH RATES ARE GOOD WITH A 5 YEAR OLD FISH AT 25 INCHES LONG.PUMPKINSEED AND BLUEGILL TRAPNET CPUE'S WERE NOT HIGH AT 13.5 AND 6.6, RESPECTIVELY.  FIFTY PERCENT OF THE BLUEGILL COLLECTED WERE GREATER THAN 7 INCHES IN LENGTH.  GROWTH RATES FOR PUMPKINSEED AND BLUEGILL ARE FAST.LOWER SUCKER LAKE APPEARS TO HAVE A LARGE POPULATION OF BLACK CRAPPIE.  THE GILLNET AND TRAPNET CPUE'S ARE GREATER THAN WHAT IS FOUND IN MOST AREA LAKES - 11.9/GN AND 4.0/TN.  AGE CLASSES II+ THROUGH VII+ WERE SAMPLED, HOWEVER AGE V+ DOMINATED, REPRESENTING 83% OF THE SAMPLE.  THE GROWTH RATE FOR BLACK CRAPPIE IS NEAR AVERAGE - 5 YEARS, 10 INCHES.ONLY ONE LARGEMOUTH BASS WAS COLLECTED.  ELECTROFISHING SHOULD BE CONDUCTED TO BETTER ASSESS THE LARGEMOUTH BASS POPULATION.YELLOW PERCH APPEAR TO BE VERY ABUNDANT - 176/GN.WALLEYE ARE PRESENT IN LOWER SUCKER LAKE.  THE FISH SAMPLED ARE THE RESULT OF NATURAL REPRODUCTION AND/OR EMIGRATION FROM LEECH LAKE.THE LEECH LAKE RESERVATION, DIVISION OF RESOURCE MANAGEMENT, CONDUCTED A MARK RECAPTURE STUDY FROM JUNE 20 TO JULY 6 USING TRAPNETS AS SAMPLING GEAR.  DURING OUR SAMPLING, AUGUST 2-5, WE CAPTURED 5 FINCLIPPED FISH: PUMPKINSEED 1 - 3.0-3.4\" AND 2 - 7.0-7.4\"; BLUEGILL 2 - 7.0-7.4\".</p>",

There is a US Forest Service owned public access on the southeast shore. Lower Sucker Lake has 4.0 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 35 feet. The DNR has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different classes based on physical, chemical and other characteristics. Lower Sucker Lake is in Lake Class 27; lakes in this class are small shallow lakes.  Most of the lake shore and surrounding upland is undeveloped and within the Chippewa National Forest and the Leech Lake Reservation.  Other Walker Area Lakes 27 lakes include Crooked (DOW# 11-0494). Thirteen (DOW# 11-0488), and Webb (DOW# 11-0311). The lake is primarily managed for Black Crappie, Northern Pike and Yellow Perch and secondarily for Bluegill, Largemouth Bass and Walleye. The lake was initially surveyed in 1949 and 10 resurveys, population assessments or natural reproduction checks have occurred since then. <br> \n <br> \nA nearshore survey was conducted to assess the populations of both game and non-game fish species.  A total of 14 sampling stations 100 feet long were evenly spaced around the lakeshore and sampled by backpack electrofishing, and when conditions allowed also with either a 15' or 50' seine (1/8th inch mesh).  Soft bottom and heavy vegetation prevented the use of seines at eight sampling sites.  A total of 11 species were sampled, including two species that are intolerant of habitat disturbance (Banded Killifish and Iowa Darter). This nearshore survey will be combined with standard survey assessment data to calculate a Fish-Based Index of Biotic Integrity (FIBI) score.  The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health by the types of fish species present and comparing it to what is expected for this type of lake.  The FIBI Tool-2 was used for scoring and resulted in an FIBI score of 45, which is at the impairment threshold (45) and below the exceptional threshold (64) for this tool.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lower Sucker Lake is a 585-acre lake located east of Cass Lake, MN that has 3.9 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 35 feet.  There is an US Forest Service owned public access on the southeast shore.  The DNR has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different classes based on physical, chemical and other characteristics.  Lower Sucker Lake is in Lake Class 36; lakes in this class are small shallow lakes.  This lake is primarily managed for northern pike and black crappie and secondarily for pumpkinseed sunfish, bluegill, and largemouth bass.    Northern pike are present in moderate numbers when compared to other Lake Class 36 lakes.  The northern pike mean length was 22 inches and fish up to 28 inches were sampled.  Of the fish sampled, 70% were greater than 21 inches.  Black crappie were abundant in all sampling gears, but the numbers are moderate when compared to other Lake Class 36 lakes.  The black crappie mean length was 9 inches and fish up to 13 inches were present.  Other fish species that are available to anglers to catch are bowfin, bluegill, brown bullhead, cisco, largemouth bass, pumpkinseed sunfish, rock bass, white sucker, yellow bullhead, and yellow perch.Anglers can help maintain or improve the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for table fare, but encourages release of medium- to large-sized fish.  Releasing these fish can help maintain balance in the fish community in Lower Sucker Lake and provide anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future.  Shoreline areas on the land and into the shallow water provide essential habitat for fish and wildlife that live in or near Minnesota's lakes.  Overdeveloped shorelines can't support the fish, wildlife, and clean water that are associated with natural undeveloped lakes. The combined effects of all lakeshore owners \"fixing up\" their property can destroy a lake's valuable natural shorelines.Shoreline habitat consists of aquatic plants, woody plants and natural lake bottom soils.Plants in the water and at the water's edge provide habitat, prevent erosion and absorb excess nutrients. Shrubs, trees, and woody debris such as fallen trees or limbs provide good habitat both above and below the water and should be left in place.  Natural lake bottom materials like silt or gravel are more ecologically productive than pure sand trucked in for a swimming beach.  A tidy lawn and a sandy beach make great spots for sunbathing and swimming but do little to provide habitat for fish and wildlife. By leaving a buffer strip of natural vegetation along the shoreline, property owners can reduce erosion, help maintain water quality, and provide habitat and travel corridors for wildlife.Only if more lakeshore owners manage their shoreline in a natural condition can fish and wildlife populations on Minnesota lakes remain healthy and abundant.  More specific information on protecting or restoring shorelines and watersheds is available through the local DNR Fisheries office.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lower Sucker Lake is a 585-acre lake located east of Cass Lake, MN that has 3.9 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 35 feet.  There is a US Forest Service owned public access on the southeast shore.  The DNR has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different classes based on physical, chemical and other characteristics. Lower Sucker Lake is in Lake Class 27; lakes in this class are small shallow lakes.  Most of the lake shore and surrounding upland is undeveloped and within the Chippewa National Forest and the Leech Lake Reservation.  Shoreline development is restricted to the south shore. Other Walker Area Lakes 27 lakes include Crooked (DOW# 11-0494). Thirteen (DOW# 11-0488), and Webb (DOW# 11-0311). <br> \nAngling for northern pike, bluegill, and black crappie can be quite productive on Lower Sucker Lake. Northern pike were abundant when compared to other Lake Class 27 lakes and averaged 21 inches long with fish up to 31 inches long present.  Black crappie numbers were moderate when compared to other Lake Class 27 lakes.  Most of the black crappie in the sample were five years old, which have been providing quality angling opportunities for fish greater than 10 inches long. Sunfish (bluegill and pumpkinseed) abundance was low but quality-sized fish up to nine inches long were common. Walleyes in the 9 to 28 inch size range were present. Other fish species that are available to anglers to catch are bowfin, bluegill, brown bullhead, cisco, largemouth bass, pumpkinseed sunfish, rock bass, white sucker, yellow bullhead, and yellow perch. <br> \n <br> \nPeople can have significant impacts on lakes and the fish populations they support.  Selective harvest by anglers (harvest of smaller to medium-sized fish) promotes balanced fish communities and sustainable fishing quality.  Removal of shoreline vegetation on private lake lots and mowing grass to the water's edge can reduce water quality, which in turn can adversely affect fish populations.  Similarly, removal of woody debris and aquatic plants from near-shore areas reduces critical habitat needed to support quality fish populations.  Finally, aquatic invasive species (AIS) can adversely impact lakes and fish populations.  These species are primarily moved from infested to non-infested waters by anglers, boaters, and lake-shore owners.  To avoid spreading AIS, lake users should inspect and remove any aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat away before leaving the access.  If you suspect an infestation of an invasive species in this lake, save a specimen and report it to a local natural resource office.  Additional information on all of these topics can be found on the DNR website (www.dnr.state.mn.us/).</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lower Sucker Lake is a 592-acre lake located east of Cass Lake, MN that has 4.0 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 35 feet.  There is a US Forest Service owned public access on the southeast shore.  The DNR has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different classes based on physical, chemical and other characteristics. Lower Sucker Lake is in Lake Class 27; lakes in this class are small shallow lakes.  Most of the lake shore and surrounding upland is undeveloped and within the Chippewa National Forest and the Leech Lake Reservation.  Shoreline development is restricted to the south shore. Other Walker Area Lakes 27 lakes include Crooked (DOW# 11-0494). Thirteen (DOW# 11-0488), and Webb (DOW# 11-0311). <br> \n <br> \nAngling for Black Crappie, Northern Pike, and Bluegill can be quite productive on Lower Sucker Lake. A fair number of Walleye are present. Black Crappie numbers were high when compared to other Lake Class 27 lakes.  Black Crappie average length was 10 inches and lengths ranged from 4 to 15 inches. Several Black Crappie year-classes were present in the 2016 sample that will provide quality angling opportunities for several years. Northern Pike were very abundant when compared to other Lake Class 27 lakes and averaged 21 inches long with fish up to 30 inches long present. Sunfish (Bluegill and Pumpkinseed) abundance was low but quality-sized fish up to nine inches long were present. Twenty-three Walleyes were sampled and sizes ranged from 9 to 28 inches. Yellow Perch are abundant but small, averaging 6 inches long. Other fish species available to anglers to catch are Bowfin, Brown Bullhead, Tullibee (Cisco), Largemouth Bass, Pumpkinseed Sunfish, Rock Bass, White Sucker, and Yellow Bullhead. <br> \n <br> \nPeople can have significant impacts on lakes and the fish populations they support. Harvest, lakeshore development, removal of shoreline vegetation, and introductions of invasive species can all adversely affect fish populations. Currently no aquatic invasive species (AIS) have been identified in Lower Sucker Lake. AIS are moved from infested to non-infested waters by anglers, boaters, and lake shore owners and can adversely impact lakes and fish populations. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access. If you suspect an infestation of an invasive species in this lake, save a specimen and report it to a local natural resource office. Additional information on all of these topics can be found on the DNR website (www.dnr.state.mn.us) or by contacting the Walker Area Fisheries office. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lower Sucker Lake (DOW 11-313) is a 592-acre lake located eight miles southeast of Cass Lake, MN that has 4.0 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 35 feet. There is a US Forest Service owned public access on the southeast shore. The DNR has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different classes based on physical, chemical and other characteristics. Lower Sucker Lake is in Lake Class 27; lakes in this class are small shallow lakes. Most of the lake shore and surrounding upland is undeveloped and within the Chippewa National Forest and the Leech Lake Reservation. Shoreline development is restricted to the south shore. Other Walker Area Lakes 27 lakes include Crooked, Thirteen, and Webb. The lake is primarily managed for Black Crappie, Northern Pike and Yellow Perch and secondarily for Bluegill, Largemouth Bass and Walleye. Special Regulations on the Sucker chain of lakes include 5 fish daily limits for Sunfish and Black Crappie; statewide possession limits of 20 and 10, respectively, remain in place. The regulations are intended to maintain the existing size quality and more information can be found at (Quality Sunfish Initiative). <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie abundance was low and the catch did not meet the management goal. Black Crappie had an average length of 12 inches with fish from 10 to 14 inches long sampled. Northern Pike numbers were moderate not meeting the management goal. Sampled Northern Pike lengths ranged from 12 to 28 inches. Yellow Perch numbers were very high compared to similar lakes and exceeded the management goal. Yellow Perch ranged in length from 5 to 9 inches. Yellow Perch offer excellent forage for larger fish in this lake, but few fish are large enough to interest anglers. Bluegill abundance was low with lengths ranging from 2 to 9 inches. The Bluegill catch did not meet the management goal. Largemouth Bass were sampled in low numbers in this survey as has been the case in past surveys. Walleye were sampled at their highest levels yet in this survey exceeding the management goal. Walleye lengths ranged from 7 to 26 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species that anglers can expect to encounter include, Bowfin (Dogfish), Hybrid Sunfish, Pumpkinseed, and White Sucker. <br> \n <br> \nPeople can have significant impacts on lakes and the fish populations they support. Harvest, lakeshore development, removal of shoreline vegetation, and introductions of invasive species can all adversely affect fish populations. Currently, no aquatic invasive species (AIS) have been identified in Lower Sucker Lake. AIS are moved from infested to non-infested waters by anglers, boaters, and lake shore owners and can adversely impact lakes and fish populations. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access. If you suspect an infestation of an invasive species in this lake, save a specimen and report it to a local natural resource office. Additional information on all of these topics can be found on the DNR website (www.dnr.state.mn.us) or by contacting the Walker Area Fisheries office. <br> \n</p>",
