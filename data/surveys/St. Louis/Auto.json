Arrowhead Lake ranks as mesotrophic according to Carlson's Trophic State Index. <br> \n <br> \nArrowhead Lake was thermally stratified on 8/8/2006 with a surface temperature of 74 F and a bottom temperature of 54 F.  Adequate oxygen for fish (more than 2 ppm) was retained to a depth of 19 feet, where the temperature was 70 F. <br> \n <br> \nThere are no inlets or outlets on Arrowhead Lake.  Aquatic plants grow to a depth of 10 feet and are sparse except for the shallow western bay.  The most common aquatic plants are blue flag and water shield.  Lake bottom substrates along the shoreline are mostly sand, with some muck, boulder, and rubble. <br> \n <br> \nArrowhead Lake was stocked from 1934 through 1969 with walleye, largemouth bass, black crappie, bluegill sunfish, and muskie.  Walleye fingerlings have been stocked biennially since 1979.  Summary data from a 1939 investigation showed that largemouth bass, black crappie, yellow perch, and a few walleye were present in the lake.   <br> \n <br> \nThree fisheries lake surveys (1953, 1978, 1998) and four fish population assessments (1982, 1985, 1990, 2006) have been conducted on Arrowhead Lake.  All of these investigations used 4-6 gillnets and 6-8 trapnets. <br> \n <br> \nFish populations in 2006 were dominated by bluegill sunfish, largemouth bass, walleye, and yellow perch.  Other fish species were present in low numbers. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill numbers in 2006 (34.1/trapnet) were somewhat higher than normal (in the third quartile) for this lake class and were higher than the median bluegill catch of 15.5/trapnet in all investigations on this lake.  Bluegill sizes in 2006 averaged 6.5 inches (0.22 lb), which was somewhat larger than normal (in the third quartile) for this lake class and was similar to the average size of 6.7 inches in all investigations on this lake.  The largest bluegill in 2006 was 8.0 inches. All of the bluegill were ages 3-5.  Bluegill growth was variable, depending on the year-class, but generally was somewhat slower than normal (in the second quartile) by area standards. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass numbers in 2006 (4.8/trapnet) were higher than normal (in the fourth quartile) for this lake class and were higher than the median largemouth catch of 1.7/trapnet in all investigations on this lake.  The electrofishing catch of largemouth in 2006 of 22.3/hour on-time was higher than in the only previous electrofishing, in 1998, of 6.2/hour on-time.  Largemouth sizes in 2006 averaged 6.6 inches (0.15 lb) in the trapnets, which was smaller than normal (in the first quartile) for this lake class and was smaller than the average size of 7.7 inches in all investigations on this lake.  The largest largemouth in 2006 (16.6 inches) was caught while electrofishing.  Most largemouth were age one.  Largemouth growth was somewhat faster than normal (in the third or fourth quartile, depending on the age) by area standards.  <br> \n  <br> \nWalleye fingerling stocking began in 1979 and except for a few walleye observed in 1939, no walleye were captured in fisheries investigations until 1982.  Walleye numbers in 2006 (9.8/gillnet) were higher than normal (in the fourth quartile) for this lake class, and were the highest found in any investigation on this lake.  Walleye sizes in 2006 averaged 16.0 inches (1.5 lb), which was normal (at the median value) for this lake class and was similar to the average size of 16.6 inches in all investigations on this lake.  The largest walleye captured in 2006 was 22.3 inches. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye fingerlings have been stocked biennially, in odd-numbered years, since 1983.  In 2006, as many walleye were captured from non-stocked years as from fingerling-stocked years.  Walleye growth was faster than normal (in the third or fourth quartile, depending on the age) by area standards.   <br> \n <br> \nPerch catches in Arrowhead Lake have been quite variable over time, ranging from 70.1/gillnet in 1953 to 2.5/gillnet in 1978.  Perch numbers in 2006 (6.8/gillnet) were somewhat higher than normal (in the third quartile) for this lake class, but were lower than the median perch catch of 10.7/gillnet in all investigations on this lake.  Perch sizes in 2006 averaged 6.9 inches (0.14 lb), which was normal (at the median value) for this lake class and was similar to the average size of 7.2 inches in all investigations on this lake.  The largest perch in 2006 was 9.1 inches.  All of the perch were ages 2-5.  Perch growth was normal (near the median) by area standards. <br> \n <br> \nSome of the game fish examined in 2006 were infected with neascus, and a few of the perch were also infected with yellow grub.  Neascus (black spot) and yellow grub are common parasites that are native to the area.  They cannot infect humans, are often removed by filleting fish, and are killed at temperatures used to cook fish.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Auto (Arrowhead) Lake is in Ecological Lake Class 10, which consists of 76 lakes in northeast Minnesota that are small and have clear and very soft (unmineralized) water.  Auto Lake is typical of lakes except that it has a higher proportion of shallow area, due to the very shallow western bay.  Auto Lake was stratified thermally on 08/10/98 and retained 2 ppm oxygen to a depth of 17 ft, where the temperature was 67 F.  The bottom temperature was 54 F.  The water chemistry done during this survey indicates that Auto Lake is mesotrophic.There are no inlets or outlets on Auto Lake,  The water level has not fluctuated much, and was normal during the 1998 lake survey.  Aquatic plants grow to a depth of 10 ft and are sparse around the main lake basin, but are dense in the shallow western bay.  The most common plants are water shield and blue flag.  Shoal substrates are mostly sand, with some muck, boulder, and rubble.  Fish spawning habitat for panfish is excellent, with numerous sandy areas around the shoreline.Riparian development in 1998 consisted of two private homes, set back from the lake, and the Laurentian Environmental Center, which has a lodge and cabins with a total of 150 beds.  The Environmental Center is currently undergoing expansion and rehabilitation.  Most of the shoreline on Auto Lake, including the leased site on which the Laurentian Environmental Center is built, is in School Section 16 and is owned by the State of Minnesota.The total catch of fish (all species combined) in the gillnets in 1998 of 32 fish/net (17 lb/net) was higher than normal for this lake class and was also higher than the average catch of 26 fish/net (10 lb/net) in five previous gillnettings on Auto Lake dating back to 1953.  Lake Class 10 is one of the least productive lake classes in northeast Minnesota, in terms of fish numbers and weight in gillnet catches.The total catch of fish in the trapnets in 1998 of 19 fish/net (8 lb/net) was similar to the average catch of 15 fish/net (5 lb/net) in five previous trapnettings on Auto Lake dating back to 1953.Fish populations in the 1998 lake survey were dominated by yellow perch, walleye, and bluegill sunfish, followed by northern pike and largemouth bass.  Low numbers of white sucker and black crappie were also captured in 1998.  Some of the crappie were quite large (up to 14\").Yellow perch numbers in 1998 (24/gillnet) were higher than normal for this lake class and were similar to the average catch of 21/gillnet in previous nettings on this lake.  Perch sizes in 1998 averaged 6\"; the largest was 8\".  Most perch captured in 1998 were ages two and three, from strong 1996 and 1995 year classes.  Growth of perch captured in 1998 (5\" at age three) was normal for the area.Walleye numbers in 1998 (4/gillnet) were higher than normal for this lake class.  Walleye were absent in the two earliest gillnettings, in 1953 and 1978.  Walleye fingerlings have been stocked regularly since 1979.  Walleye numbers in assessments since from 1982 through 1990 averaged 3/gillnet.  Walleye sizes in 1998 averaged 16\"; the largest (caught in a trapnet) was 22\".  Growth of walleye captured in 1998 (15\" at age three) was faster than normal for the area.Bluegill numbers in 1998 (16/trapnet) were normal for this lake class, but were higher than the average catch of 11/trapnet in previous nettings on this lake.  Bluegill sizes in 1998 averaged 5\"; the largest was 8\".  Most of the bluegill captured in 1998 were ages three and four, from strong 1995 and 1994 year classes.  Growth of bluegill captured in 1998 (4\" at age three) was faster than average for this lake class.Northern pike numbers in 1998 (2.7/gillnet) were normal for this lake class, but were much higher than the average of 0.4/gillnet in previous nettings on this lake.  Pike sizes in 1998 averaged 21\", which was smaller than the average size of 27\" in previous nettings; the largest pike in 1998 was 26\".  All but one of the pike captured in 1998 were age three or younger.  Growth of pike captured in 1998 (22\" at age three) was faster than normal for the area.Largemouth bass numbers in the gillnets in 1998 (0.2/net) were very low, but largemouth numbers in the trapnets (1.7/net) were higher than normal for this lake class.  Largemouth bass are \"net-shy\" and are rarely captured in numbers proportional to their true abundance in biological lake surveys.  Largemouth numbers were good in the spring electrofishing (6 bass per hour of electrofishing), and in the shoreline seining (5 young-of-year bass per seine haul).  Anglers have also reported good largemouth fishing on this lake.  Largemouth sizes in 1998 were generally small (10\"), but some large fish (up to 18\") were captured.  Growth of largemouth captured in 1998 (9\" at age three) was faster than normal by area standards.About half of the gamefish examined in 1998 were infected with Neascus (black spot).  Neascus is a common parasite found in or under the skin that is native to the area, is usually removed by filleting, is killed by cooking, and cannot infect humans even while alive.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Auto, locally known as Arrowhead Lake, is a 97-acre lake located 10 miles north of Virginia, MN. Auto consists of two basins connected by a narrow channel. The west basin is approximately 16 acres in size and has a maximum depth of six feet. By mid-summer, aquatic plants form thick mats on the lake surface making travel by boat difficult. The east basin has a maximum depth of 28 feet and other than a few areas, aquatic plants are relatively sparse. Substrates in the east basin consist of rock, gravel and sand. For a small lake, there are a number of points, bars and bays present. There is a concrete plank boat ramp located on the east basin.\n\nCurrently, there is very little human development on Auto Lake because the shoreline is located on School Trust Fund Land, set aside by the state and managed by the DNR for the long-term financial benefit of Minnesota's schools. The Laurentian Environmental Learning Center is located on east basin.\n\nThe Auto Lake fishery is managed primarily for its bass and bluegill fishery. Walleye is a secondary species initially introduced by stocking. Walleye fingerling stocking continues on an every other year basis.\n\nThe 2014 fisheries survey consisted of gill nets, trap nets and electrofishing. Catches indicated that walleye, bluegill, largemouth bass and yellow perch were important species in the fish community.\n\nAbundance of walleye in 2014 (4.3/net) was equal to the historic average for Auto Lake. This abundance level was high when compared to other lakes in the same classification. In general, the number of walleye caught during DNR surveys on Auto has been consistent. Walleye caught during this survey averaged 19.2 inches and ranged from 15.8 to 25.8 inches. No walleye less than 15 inches in length were observed during any portion of the survey. Fish aging indicated that year-classes hatched during years when stocking occurred were no more abundant than those hatched during unstocked years.\n\nNearshore sampling indicated that bluegill abundance (6.6/net) was less than the lake's historic average and the lake class average.  The 2014 catch was the lowest since 1985. The average bluegill size was small. \n\nFifty-three largemouth bass were sampled during night electrofishing for a catch per hour of 38.9. The 2014 catch rate greatly exceeded the two previous sampling events in 1998 (6.2/hour) and 2006 (18.7/hour). Largemouth bass ranged from 6.0 to 17.1 inches in length with an average of 9.4 inches. Most (91%) of the bass caught were less than 12 inches in length. Only three bass (6%) exceeded 15 inches. Although bass up to ten years of age were caught, most bass were either two or three year olds. \n\nOther species present during the 2014 survey included yellow perch, northern pike, white sucker and pumpkinseed. Perch abundance varies considerably in Auto Lake but in 2014 abundance was high.  Nearly all of the perch sampled however, were less than eight inches in length. Northern pike and white sucker abundance has generally been low in Auto Lake and 2014 was no exception.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Auto Lake, also known as Arrowhead, is a 97 acre lake located 10 miles north of Virginia.  It is accessed by a concrete ramp off Peppard Rd.  The lake has two distinct basins connected by a narrow channel.  The west basin is approximately 16 acres in size and has a maximum depth of six feet.  Aquatic plants dominate the west basin often forming mats on the surface making travel by boat difficult.  The east basin has a maximum depth of 28 feet and other than a few areas, aquatic plants are relatively sparse.   <br> \n <br> \nOn July 26, 2021 the lake was thermally stratified with a surface temperature of 75 F and a bottom temperature of 58 F.  Oxygen levels were adequate for gamefish to a depth of 20 feet where the temperature was 66 F.  Auto Lake is located primarily on School Trust Fund Land.  There is no development on the east basin other than the Laurentian Environmental Learning Center.  Lake bottom substrates along the shoreline are mostly rubble, gravel, and sand, with muck in the bays.   <br> \n <br> \nThe overall gillnet catch rate for all fish combined was 6.3 fish/net which was the lowest catch rate on record for the lake.  Yield was 10.4 lbs/net which was below the average of all past surveys on the lake.  Fish species sampled were walleye, largemouth bass, bluegill, and yellow perch.  Trap nets caught fish at an overall rate of 12.7 fish/net which was right at the average for the lake.  Yield was 3.2 lbs/net which was below the lakes historic average of 5.8 lbs/net.  Fish species sampled in trap nets were bluegill, hybrid sunfish, largemouth bass, and northern pike.   <br> \n <br> \nSeventeen walleye were sampled in gill nets for a catch rate of 2.8 fish/net, which was above average compared to other similar lakes, but slightly below the historic average for Auto Lake.  Walleye lengths ranged from 18 to nearly 25 inches with an average of just over 20 inches.  This average length was the highest on record for the lake.  The average weight was impressive at nearly 3 pounds per fish.  Walleye growth was excellent with a typical four year old fish measuring 17 inches.  Ages ranged from 5 to 18 years with no overly strong year class.  When stocked years were compared against non-stocked years, 11 of the 17 fish sampled (65%) came from a year class where fingerling stocking occurred.     <br> \n <br> \nOn the night of June 1st, four electrofishing stations were sampled with each station being fished for 20 minutes.  Ninety-eight largemouth bass were captured in 1.33 hours of on-time for a total catch rate of 73.5 fish/hour.  This was above average when compared to other largemouth lakes in the area and better than the previous spring sample (38.9 fish/hour in 2014).  Lengths ranged from 3 to just over 19 inches with an average of 11 inches.  Growth rates were average when compared to other lakes in the area with the average largemouth reaching 10.5 inches at four years old.   <br> \n <br> \nThe bluegill trapnet catch was 6.6 fish/net which was below average compared to other similar lakes and slightly below the average for Auto Lake.  Sizes ranged from 4 to just over 9 inches with an average of 6.5 inches.  Ages ranged from 3 to 15 years with strong representation (over 39% of the total catch) coming from the 2015 year class.  Growth rates were slow with the average fish taking 7 years to reach 6.5 inches.   <br> \n</p>",
