                "narrative": "<p>Devil's Elbow Lake is essentially a wide area of the Granite River.  It lies between Marabeouf and Gneiss Lakes, and it's fish populations are probably strongly influenced by those in the two larger lakes.  None of the three lakes have been stocked; all fish populations are entirely self-sustained.The walleye catch in Devil's Elbow Lake in 1999 was above the median for lakes of this class.  However, most of the fish taken were under 16 inches in length, and were less than four years of age.  Growth had been somewhat slower than average for this area, at least among young fish.  The slow growth was probably due to a lack of yellow perch.  Catches of smallmouth bass and northern pike were low in 1999, as they had been when the lake was initially surveyed (in 1978).  Forage for game fish was provided by what was probably a very small number of yellow perch, fairly high numbers of northern cisco, and, to some extent, lake whitefish.</p>",
