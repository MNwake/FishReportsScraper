                "narrative": "<p>Bavaria is a Class 24 lake located in eastern Carver County, near the town of Victoria.  This fertile lake is 162 acres, with a maximum depth of 66 feet. There is a county owned boat launch located on the southwest shore.  Lake Bavaria tends to stratify rather shallow; during the summer of 2013, dissolved oxygen fell below 3 ppm at 12 feet.  Evidence of low-oxygen conditions in limited areas (partial winterkill) was noted after the 2010-11 winter. <br> \nBavaria is primarily managed for Largemouth Bass and secondarily for Northern Pike and Bluegill. In 2013, a population assessment was conducted, consisting of spring night-time electrofishing and trap netting, and summer gill netting. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass are abundant; however, few large fish were sampled.  The electrofishing catch rate, 74.5 per hour of active sampling (\"on-time\"), is high relative to other lakes in the West Metro area.  One hundred-thirty Bass were sampled, averaging 10.6 inches and 0.8 pounds.  The largest fish measured 21 inches.  Forty percent of the sampled fish were longer than 12 inches, and 5% were longer than 16 inches. Largemouth Bass in Lake Bavaria reach 12 inches by age 5 and 16 inches by age 9.  A detailed study of the Largemouth Bass population, covering the period 1992-2001, was conducted by MN DNR Fisheries Research; results are in MN DNR Fisheries Investigational Report 506. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike are highly abundant, and of quality size.  The gill net catch rate, 8.5 fish per net, has increased from the previous survey in 2007, when 3 fish per net were caught.  Although the fish are of quality size, averaging 25.4 inches and 3.9 pounds, 2013 mean size was lower than in 2007 (26.9 inches/ 4.1 pounds).  Ninety-two percent of 2013's catch was longer than 21 inches, and 25% were longer than 28 inches.  The largest fish sampled measured 34.3 inches. Northern Pike grow fast in Lake Bavaria, reaching 21 inches by age 3 and 29 inches by age 6. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill are quite abundant in Bavaria, and of quality size. Their abundance has been gradually increasing since 1990, when 37.4 fish per net were caught. The 2013 trap net catch rate, 80.8 fish per trap net, is similar to the previous survey in 2007 (79.3 fish per trap net).  Average size has increased, from 5.4 inches and 0.11 pounds in 2007 to 6.4 inches and 0.2 pounds in 2013.  Seventy percent of the sample was longer than 6 inches, and 40% were longer than 7 inches. Ages 1 through 9 were present in the sample.  Bluegill growth is average in Lake Bavaria, with fish reaching 6.5 inches by age 4 and 7.5 inches by age 6.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie were caught at a rate of 10.7 per trap net in 2013, which is moderately high for this type of lake.  Fish averaged 8.2 inches and 0.27pounds, with the largest fish measuring 9.8 inches.  Ages 2 through 8 were represented in the sample and growth rate appears average relative to statewide averages.  Fish reached 8.1 inches by age 4.   <br> \n <br> \nYellow Bullhead were very abundant, and the majority of fish sampled were over 10 inches in size.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of the nearshore fish community in Bavaria Lake was conducted by Fisheries Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program Staff from 29-30 August 2022. Ten sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 15-foot or 50-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at all ten sites with two sites sampled from the boat. A 50-foot seine was used to sample eight sites and soft sediments with abundant vegetation and deep water prevented the use of seines at two sampling sites. Nearshore sampling captured 11 native species of fish including one species that is intolerant of disturbance (Iowa Darter) and one species (Green Sunfish) that is tolerant of disturbance. <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore data were combined with gill net and trap net data from a June 2022 survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based IBI (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment. In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g., Blackchin Shiner, Iowa Darter, and Rock Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g., Black Bullhead, Fathead Minnow, and Green Sunfish). The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.  <br> \n <br> \nResults from this survey indicate the fish community of Bavaria Lake is affected by disturbance as indicated by an FIBI score equal to the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes. Data from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Lower Minnesota River Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency. During the previous assessment, Bavaria Lake was listed as impaired for Aquatic Life Use based on the low FIBI score and several stressors were identified as likely impacting the fish community: excess nutrients, riparian lakeshore development, and non-native species.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Bavaria is a 162-acre lake with a maximum depth of 66 feet, located south of Victoria, in eastern Carver County. Bavaria is primarily managed for Largemouth Bass and Northern Pike, but includes catchable populations of Black Crappie and Bluegill. A Standard Survey (trap nets and gill nets) was conducted on Lake Bavaria during the week of 7/9/17. During the survey, water clarity was 4.0 feet, with low oxygen below 14 feet. Eurasian Watermilfoil also remains present in Lake Bavaria. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass were sampled at a rate of 71.7 fish per hour, similar numbers to the previous survey (74.5 fish/hour). Largemouth Bass averaged 13.1 inches-- with the largest measuring 20.4 inches-- while 43% of fish sampled were over 15 inches. Growth was fast compared to similar lakes across the state. The Largemouth Bass population in Lake Bavaria is healthy, with many year classes of fish. Bavaria supports a high quality bass fishery that should provide good angling opportunity. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike numbers in Lake Bavaria were moderate, with 4.3/net. Average size of Northern Pike in gill nets was 26.7 inches, with the largest measured at 36.3 inches.  Growth was fast compared to similar lakes across the state. Approximately 36% of sampled fish were greater than 28 inches. The Northern Pike population in Lake Bavaria is healthy, with many year classes of fish. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie were sampled with gill nets (8.5/net) and trap nets (2.1/net) -- near the expected catch rate of similar lakes. Black Crappie averaged 6.6 inches, with the largest measured at 9.2 inches. Approximately 2% of sampled fish were greater than 9 inches. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill numbers in Lake Bavaria were high, with 62.4/net. Bluegill averaged 5.7 inches, with the largest measured at 8.1 inches. Approximately 1% of sampled fish were greater than 7 inches. <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species sampled in low abundance were Black Bullhead, Common Carp, Golden Shiner, Pumpkinseed, White Sucker, and Yellow Perch. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of nearshore fish species in Bavaria Lake was conducted on June 20th - 21st 2023, by Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program staff. Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake, and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at ten sampling stations, but one station was sampled from the boat due to site conditions. Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample five stations, a 15-foot seine was used at three stations, and site conditions prevented the use of seines at two stations. Nearshore sampling captured thirteen species of fish including one species that is intolerant of disturbance (i.e., Iowa Darter) and three that are tolerant of disturbance (i.e.,  Common Carp, Green Sunfish, and Fathead Minnow). <br> \n <br> \nA concurrent summer trap net survey was also conducted by IBI Program staff. Nine trap nets were set along the shoreline in locations that encompassed multiple habitat types. Trap net sampling captured nine species of fish, including three that are tolerant of disturbance (i.e., Black Bullhead, Common Carp, and Green Sunfish). Bluegill comprised a majority of the catch by number and by biomass. <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore and trap net data were combined with gill net data from a July 2023 survey to describe the fish community and provide a fish-based IBI (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment. In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g., Blackchin Shiner, Iowa Darter, and Rock Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g., Black Bullhead and Common Carp). The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.  <br> \n <br> \nResults from this survey provide evidence that the fish community in Bavaria Lake is adversely impacted by stressors, as indicated by an FIBI score below the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes. These results are similar to previous survey findings, which indicated that Bavaria Lake was impaired for aquatic life use based on the Fish IBI. The survey results will be considered when the biological health of the lake is assessed during the Lower Minnesota River Watershed assessment process, which will be completed in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Bavaria Lake is a good pike lake.  The pike may be slightly more abundant, larger, and older than they were in the 1995 survey.  The gillnet catch rate of 11.8 pike per gillnet is higher than, at least, 75% of the state's comparable lakes.  There is some opportunity to catch quality pike.  The average length and weight of the population is 22.8 inches and 2.8 pounds.  Fourteen percent of pike sampled were larger than 28 inches.  The largest individual caught was 37.8 inches and 11.4 pounds.  The average age increased from 2.8 years in 1995 to 4.9 years in 2001.  Growth rates are about average for pike in this lake type.The bluegill population is slightly larger in size and numbers compared to the 1995 population.  The trapnet catch rate was 58 per net, which is near 75th percentile for the state's comparable lakes.  Average length is 6.5 inches with 26% larger than 7 inches.  The largest bluegill captured was 7.8 inches.  Growth rates are slightly below average for this lake class as they were in the last survey.Black crappie abundance has significantly increased from 1995.  Crappies were sampled near median levels for lakes of this type.  There are many crappies larger than 8 inches in the population.  The largest individual sampled was 9.1 inches and 0.4 pounds.  Growth rates are slightly below average.Bavaria Lake is part of a four-lake study to assess the no-harvest regulation on largemouth bass in place from 1995 (Study No. 645 (680)).  Largemouth bass are not well sampled in survey nets, however spring electrofishing has been conducted to assess the population.  The Bavaria lake bass population may have slightly improved in numbers and size structure but not significantly relative to the reference lakes.  The catch and release regulation will be discontinued as of May 24, 2003 and the bag limit will return to that of the statewide norm of 6.  Shoreline seine hauls yielded the presence of young-of-the-year bass.Yellow perch have been more abundant in past surveys.  Only 2 were sampled in this survey, in seine hauls.  Yellow bullhead were caught at a rate of 28 per gillnet, which is very abundant.  They averaged 0.6 lbs.  Black bullhead, common carp, hybrid sunfish, and pumpkinseed sunfish were also present.   Painted and snapping turtles were also sampled.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Bavaria Lake is located in eastern Carver county near the town of Victoria.  The deepest area (66 ft) of this productive 162-acre lake is on the northeast side and there is a concrete, county owned, boat launch located on the southwest shore of the lake.  The lake is primarily managed for largemouth bass and secondarily for bluegill and black crappie. <br> \n <br> \nIn 2007, northern pike abundance was moderately low and lower than the previous assessment in 2002.  Average length of northern pike was 26.9 inches and ranged from 21.0 to 33.7 inches.  Approximately 50% were longer than 28.0 inches.  Mean weight of northern pike was 4.1 pounds, with the largest fish weighing 8.1 pounds.  Growth of northern pike was slow for most age classes compared to other lakes in the West Metro Area.  <br> \n <br> \nCurrent bluegill abundance is higher than the previous assessment as 635 were collected in trap nets, which is well above average in the state.  However, the size structure is poor.  Average length was 5.4 inches, the largest measured 7.1inches, and only 24% were 6 inches or greater in length.  Average weight of a bluegill was 0.1 pounds and weights ranged from 0.01 to 0.2 pounds.  Growth was slow in Lake Bavaria as it has been in the past. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie catch was similar to the previous assessment in 2002.  Abundance was moderately high in both trap nets and gill nets.  Average length was 6.4 inches, the largest measured was 9.1 inches, and only 5% were greater than 8 inches.  Average weight of black crappie was 0.1 pounds and weights ranged from 0.04 to 0.3 pounds.  Growth was slow for all age classes compared to other lakes in the West Metro Area.  <br> \n <br> \nPassive sampling gear, such as trap nets and gill nets, is not an effective method of collecting a sample of largemouth bass, so the data presented for largemouth bass is not indicative of relative abundance.  Electrofishing is the typical method for largemouth bass assessments but was not conducted during this survey.  However, four largemouth bass were captured in trap nets. Average length was 12.2 inches and lengths ranged from 7.5 to 19.7 inches. Mean weight was 1.4 pounds and weights ranged from 0.2 to 3.8 pounds.   <br> \n <br> \nYellow bullhead were present in relatively high abundance.  Catches of 17.8 per gillnet and 9.3 per trap net are well above average for the state.  Mean length and weight of a yellow bullhead was 10.7 inches and 0.6 pounds.  While yellow bullhead abundance is high, they are typically lower in abundance than black bullhead.  For comparison, a catch of the same number of black bullhead per gill net would be considered moderate for this lake type. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch were sampled at low abundance (n = 4, 0.5/gill net), but in previous assessments they have been sampled as high as 8.5/gill net.  Pumpkinseed (n = 9), common carp (n = 2), hybrid sunfish (n = 1), and black bullhead (n = 1) were also collected in this survey but in low numbers as has been the case historically.    <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Bavaria is a 166-acre lake with a maximum depth of 66 feet, located south of Victoria, in eastern Carver County. A public boat access is located on the southwestern shore of the lake.  Bavaria is managed for Largemouth Bass and Northern Pike, and also includes healthy populations of Black Crappie and Bluegill. A Standard Survey was completed on Lake Bavaria during the spring and summer of 2022. During the survey, water clarity was 2.5 feet, with low oxygen below 15 feet. Eurasian Watermilfoil is present in Lake Bavaria. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass were sampled during the spring with nighttime boat electrofishing. The catch rate, 46.4 fish per hour, was lower than that of the previous two bass surveys.  Despite the lower catch rate, a broad range of sizes of fish were sampled, with large fish present.  Largemouth Bass size during 2022 ranged between 5.9 and 20.4 inches, with an average fish size of 10.5 inches and 0.88 pounds.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike numbers in Lake Bavaria were moderately high in 2022.  Average size of Northern Pike in gill nets was 26.0 inches, with the largest measured at 34.7 inches.  Growth was fast compared to similar lakes across the state. Approximately 26% of sampled fish were greater than 28 inches. The Northern Pike population in Lake Bavaria is healthy, with many year classes of fish. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie were sampled with gill nets and trap nets near the expected catch rates for this type of lake.  In the 2022 survey, 123 fish were sampled, ranging in length from 4.6 to 11.2 inches, with an average length of 6.9 inches.  Approximately 8% of sampled fish were greater than 9 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nBluegill numbers in Lake Bavaria were very high.  Bluegill averaged 5.1 inches, with the largest measured at 8.3 inches. Approximately 18% of sampled fish were greater than 7 inches. <br> \n <br> \nAlthough underutilized, Yellow Bullhead were abundant and of good quality size in the 2022 survey.  Fish ranged in length from 5.7 to 14.0 inches, with an average length of 11.2 inches.  Seventy-eight percent of the sampled fish exceeded 10 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species sampled in low abundance were Brown Bullhead, Common Carp, Golden Shiner, Green Sunfish, hybrid sunfish, Pumpkinseed, and Yellow Perch. <br> \n</p>",
