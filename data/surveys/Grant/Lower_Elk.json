Survey components included late-winter water quality measurement and early-spring trap netting.  Late-winter dissolved oxygen readings were low, which indicated gamefish losses due to winterkill were likely.  Trap netting results and abundance of dead fish along the shoreline suggested that winterkill was severe and restorative stockings were warranted.  The only gamefishes captured were two Black Crappie and six Yellow Perch.  Restorative stockings of Black Crappie, Bluegill, Largemouth Bass, Walleye, and Yellow Perch were completed during spring 2019.  In absence of future winterkill events, fishable populations for these species likely won't become established until 2021 or later.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lower Elk Lake is a small, fertile lake located just north of Hoffman in eastern Grant County.  This lake is not highly developed and recreational pressure is minimal.  Maximum depth is less than 15.0 ft, thus the fish community is vulnerable to periodic winterkill events.  Water clarity is seasonally poor.  Summer water clarity measurements rarely exceed 3.0 feet.  Dense algal blooms are common throughout summer months.  Submergent vegetation is limited and is usually found in extremely shallow areas adjacent to the shoreline. <br> \n <br> \nBecause the lake is susceptible to periodic winterkill, fisheries management efforts have been limited.  Walleye fry are stocked on an alternate year basis to maintain a modest walleye fishery.  Low density populations of bluegill, largemouth bass, and northern pike are present.  These fish grow very fast so there are modest, quality angling opportunities.  More than half of 2010 bluegill captures exceeded 8.0 inches in length.  Average size of sampled largemouth bass was 17.4 inches.  Yellow perch are abundant, but at time of the survey captures were young fish.  Mean length of captures was 7.0 inches.  In sustained absence of winterkill, a fair perch fishery should develop in a couple of years. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lower Elk Lake is a shallow, hypereutrophic basin that experiences periodic winterkill.  Dissolvedoxygen concentrations fell below 1.0 mg/l in March of 1997.  Reports of up to 200 dead walleye werereceived from the public.  Ice out trapnetting revealed the presence of several large walleye, as wellas other fish species, suggesting only a partial winterkill event.  Fish may have also migrated intothe lake from a direct connection to the Chippewa River during unusually high water levels in earlyspring.Walleye catches averaged 3.5 fish/gillnet.  Fish ranged from 12.2 to 20.3 inches in total length.  Meanweight was 1.8 pounds.  Trapnet catches averaged 6.1 fish/net.  Total lengths ranged from 7.0 to 24.6inches.  Walleye are experiencing rapid growth.  Age-3 fish average 19.3 inches in total length at timeof capture.  Age-1 and age-3 fish comprised 50% and 32%, respectively, of the fish captured.  Thesefish are the result of natural reproduction or migration.  Walleye fry were last stocked in 1989following a winterkill event.  One northern pike was captured with gillnets and fourteen were capturedin trapnets (1.8/net).  Fish ranged from 9.3 to 31.5 inches in total length and most exceeded 21.0inches.  Mean weight of fish captured was 3.2 pounds.  Yellow perch catches averaged 1.0 fish/gillnetand 4.5 fish/trapnet.  Most of the fish captured were between 9.0 and 10.0 inches in total length. Yellow perch were abundant in 1987, averaging 154.0 fish/gillnet.  Black bullhead are abundant. Catches averaged 74.0 fish/gillnet and 41.8 fish/trapnet.  Mean weight of fish captured was 0.2 and 0.3pounds in gillnets and trapnets, respectively.       </p>",

This lake is not highly developed and recreational pressure is minimal.  Basin depth is relatively shallow which makes it prone to periodic winterkill.  Water clarity is relatively poor with summer Secchi disk measurements rarely exceeding 2.0 feet.  Dense algal blooms are relatively common throughout summer months and can further reduce water clarity.  Submergent vegetation is limited and is usually found in extremely shallow areas adjacent to the shoreline.Because the lake is susceptible to periodic winterkill, fisheries management efforts have been limited.  Walleye fry are stocked on an alternate year basis and this maintains a low to moderately abundant walleye population.  Another species of recent interest to anglers is yellow perch.  Perch abundance is currently high and the size structure of this population is favorable.  Almost half of 2005 captures exceeded 8.0 inches in length.  Other gamefishes present include bluegill, black crappie, largemouth bass, and northern pike.  Abundance of these species is typically low and they provide limited angling opportunities.  The orangespotted sunfish, a unique species that is rarely sampled in lakes within the Glenwood Management Area, is also present in low numbers.      </p>",

Survey components included late-winter water quality measurement and early-spring trap netting.  Late-winter dissolved oxygen readings were low, which indicated gamefish losses due to winterkill were possible.  However, trap netting results suggested that winterkill severity was low and restorative stockings were not warranted.  Gamefish species present in early spring included Black Crappie, Bluegill, Largemouth Bass, Northern Pike, Walleye, and Yellow Perch.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lower Elk Lake is a small, shallow basin located just north of Hoffman in Grant County.  Maximum depth of the lake is only 16 feet which makes it prone to periodic winterkill.  The last event was a partial winterkill during the winter of 1996-97.  The lake is generally considered to be hypereutrophic.  Dense blue-green algal blooms are common throughout summer months.  The lake supports beds of submergent vegetation around most of the shoreline, however emergent vegetation such as hardstem bulrush and common cattail are limited.  Aquatic vegetation provides fish habitat and competes with nuisance algae for the available nutrients in the lake.  Recreational use of Lower Elk Lake is minimal.  The lake supports a fairly limited fish community.  Walleye are the only gamefish species that provides angling opportunities.  Recent test netting indicates a low to moderate abundance of walleye.  Fish range from 7 to 26 inches in length.  Average weight was about 1.8 pounds.  Abundance is largely determined by the frequency and severity of winterkill, migration of fish from the Chippewa River, and survival of stocked walleye fry.  Fry are stocked in alternate years to increase walleye numbers and provide some recreational fishing.  Yellow perch are abundant, however most of the fish were 5 to 8 inches in length and would not attract most anglers.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lower Elk Lake is a 131-acre shallow, productive basin located north of Hoffman in eastern Grant County within the Chippewa River watershed.  Maximum depth is just 13 feet.  Water quality and clarity is seasonally poor in response to algae blooms stimulated by excessive nutrient levels that come from the predominantly agricultural watershed.  Summer water clarity measurements rarely exceed 3 feet.  Submerged vegetation is limited and is usually found in extremely shallow areas adjacent to the shoreline.  This lake is not highly developed and recreational pressure is minimal.  A public access is located on the west shoreline.\n \nShallow, productive basins like Lower Elk Lake are susceptible to periodic winterkill events.  The last severe winterkill occurred during the 2018-2019 winter.  Following this winterkill event, restorative stockings of multiple gamefish species (Black Crappie, Bluegill, Largemouth Bass, Walleye, and Yellow Perch) occurred in spring 2019.\n  \nA standard lake survey was completed during summer 2022 to assess the fish community and gain updated estimates of abundance and size structure of gamefish populations following the 2019 restorative stockings.  Survey results suggest that those stockings were successful.  Black Crappie, Bluegill, Largemouth Bass, and Yellow Perch were all abundant.  However, most of these gamefish populations were dominated by younger individuals and average size was relatively small.  Size structure of these populations should improve if fast growth rates can be maintained, and future winterkill events can be avoided.  Other gamefish species captured included Northern Pike and Walleye.  Both populations exhibited low abundance but large average size.\n  \nOther species sampled included the following: Bigmouth Buffalo, Black, Brown and Yellow Bullhead, Common Carp, and Orangespotted Sunfish.  The next standard survey is tentatively scheduled for 2029. \n</p>",
