TRAPNET CATCH INDICES FOR BLC ARE ABOVE THE UPPER END OF THE NORMAL RANGE INDICATING A HIGH POPULATION FOR LAKE CLASS 44.  THE LAKE WAS ALMOST DRY DURING THE WINTER OF 1989-90.  THE BLC POPULATION MAY HAVE BEEN STOCKED BY AREA ANGLERS IN 1990 OR MIGRATED UP ST. JAMES CREEK IN THE SPRING OF 1990.  THREE YEAR CLASSES OF YEP WERE OBSERVED DURING THE SURVEY.  UNKNOWN AGE ADULT YEP WERE STOCKED IN THE SPRING PRIOR TO THE SURVEY THEREFORE IT IS UNKNOWN WHETHER THE YEP OBSERVED DURING THE SURVEY WERE FROM THE STOCKING OR IF THEY WERE PRESENT NATURALLY.  TRAPNET CATCH INDICES FOR CARP WERE ALMOST 150 TIMES THE UPPER END OF THE NORMAL RANGE FOR THIS LAKE CLASS INDICATING A VERY HIGH POPULATION.  A MAJORITY OF THE CARP WERE 4.0-7.0 INCHES AND ONLY 9 CARP WERE 17 INCHES OR LONGER.  TRAPNET CATCH INDICES FOR BLB WERE ALMOST 8 TIMES THE UPPER END OF THE NORMAL RANGE FOR THIS LAKE CLASS.  SHORELINE SEINING DATA INDICATED YEP AND OSS SPAWNED SUCCESSFULLY.  BECAUSE OF THE FREQUENCY OF WINTERKILL, NOP AND YEP SHOULD BE THE PRIMARY SPECIES MANAGED FOR.  IF NETTING IN THE SPRING INDICATES A MODERATE TO SEVERE WINTERKILL, YEP AND NOP SHOULD BE STOCKED.</p>",
