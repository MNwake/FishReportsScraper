                "narrative": "<p>Steep Bank is a 208-acre lake located in Lincoln County five miles northeast of Hendricks, MN.  The lake is very shallow (maximum depth 6.5 feet) and thus is prone to winterkill.  In 2001, winterkill eliminated all game fish and most common carp.  Since that date, the lake has been managed as a boom-or-bust walleye fishery.  Dissolved oxygen levels during the winter following this assessment were low, and Steep Bank was opened for liberalized fishing.  Ice-out netting will occur in the spring of 2009 to determine the extent of the winterkill, but readers are cautioned that the fish population in Steep Bank may have changed substantially since this assessment. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye were the only abundant game fish in Steep Bank.  Although not as abundant as in 2005, anglers should still have good success walleye fishing.  Anglers can expect walleye to only average 13 inches, but fish over 26 inches long were also observed.  Steep Bank was stocked with over 200,000 walleye fry in the spring of 2008.  Survival was good, as abundance of  young-of-year (YOY) walleye was the highest its been since 2005.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch were observed in low abundance compared to 1999.  The perch ranged in length from 5.7-11 inches and were from the 2005 or 2007 year class.     <br> \n <br> \nBlack bullhead abundance appears to have declined substantially to their lowest abundance ever observed in Steep Bank.  Abundance of black bullhead will likely remain low, as only one YOY bullhead was sampled.  It is likely the abundant walleye population is limiting the abundance of black bullhead in Steep Bank.  In contrast, common carp have increased in abundance since 2005.  Carp were as large as 27 inches, but had an average length of only 16 inches.  Other fish sampled were white sucker, green sunfish, fathead minnow, and brassy minnow. <br> \n <br> \nFuture management activities include winter dissolved oxygen monitoring and fishing pressure counts, possible fish stocking, YOY fish evaluations, and a winterkill assessment.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Steep Bank Lake is located in Lincoln County five miles northeast of Hendricks.  It measures 208 acres and has a maximum depth of 7 feet.  It is a highly productive lake that frequently experiences dense algae blooms and is prone to winterkill.  Winterkills occurred during the winters of 1980-81, 1981-82, 1993-94, 2000-01, and 2008-09.  A 2012 moderate to severe summerkill also occurred in 2012. <br> \n <br> \nSteep Bank Lake is managed as a boom or bust walleye fishery.  Walleye are maintained by fry stocking as spawning success by them has been poor.  Walleye were abundant in 2014 with 20 caught per gill net.  The majority were 9-19 inches and from the 2013 and 2011 year classes.  Walleye fry were stocked during spring, however survival was likely poor because young-of-year walleye were not very abundant during the fall. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch were abundant and they were 5-7 inches long.  They were growing very well and should measure 9-10 inches during 2015. <br> \n <br> \nBlack bullhead and common carp were caught in relatively low numbers. <br> \n <br> \nFuture management activities include walleye stocking, fish assessments, winter dissolved oxygen monitoring and winter angling pressure counts. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Steep Bank Lake is located in Lincoln County five miles northeast of the town of Hendricks.  It is 208 acres and has a maximum depth of 7 feet.  The lake is highly productive and dense algal blooms frequently occur.  A moderate to severe summerkill of fish was documented in 2012.  Summerkills can happen when the dense algae die and decompose.  The decomposition process can deplete much of the oxygen in the water and cause fish to suffocate.  Steep Bank Lake also has a history of winterkill, most recently in 2008-09.  Low winter oxygen levels were observed in 2010-11 and 2013-2014, but few fish were noted to perish.  This standard survey was conducted to collect routine fish population data using gill nets, standard trap nets and quarter-inch trap nets.  These data can be compared to historical standard and targeted survey data from Steep Bank Lake. <br> \n <br> \nWalleyes were abundant, similar to the last survey in 2014.  Steep Bank Lake can be described as a \"boom or bust\" Walleye fishery, and it's presently in the \"boom\" stage.  Walleye fry have routinely been stocked because very little natural reproduction has ever been found.  Multiple Walleye year classes were present and Walleyes were 10-22 inches, averaging 16 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch were abundant.  Their average size was 9 inches, but some as large as 13 inches were present.  Most of the adult perch were from the 2015 and 2016 year classes.  Young-of-the-year perch were also abundant, so good fishing for Yellow Perch is expected to continue for some time.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack Bullheads, Common Carp and White Suckers were caught in relatively low numbers. <br> \n <br> \nFuture management activities include continued Walleye fry stocking, fish surveys, winter dissolved oxygen monitoring and winter angling pressure counts. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Steep Bank Lake is located in Lincoln County five miles northeast of the town of Hendricks.  It is 208 acres and has a maximum depth of seven feet.  The lake is highly productive and dense algae blooms frequently occur.  Fish summerkills can occur when algae die and decompose, often rapidly depleting the dissolved oxygen.  The last known summerkill occurred in 2012.  Steep Bank Lake also has a history of winterkills due to low oxygen, most recently in 2009. <br> \n <br> \nThis Targeted Survey was conducted to collect routine fish population data using gill nets and quarter-inch mesh trap nets.  These data can be compared to historical Standard and Targeted survey data from Steep Bank Lake. <br> \n <br> \nWalleyes were moderately abundant in 2020 from a wide range of sizes, including fish over 20 inches.  Steep Bank Lake can be described as a \"boom or bust\" Walleye fishery, and it's presently in the \"boom\" stage.  Fry stocking has maintained the Walleye population.   <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch were abundant.  Most of the adult perch were from the 2019 year class and 5-8 inches.  They should provide good fishing for the next year or two.  One 13-inch perch was caught.  Young-of-year perch were abundant and they should provide continued good perch fishing in the future.   <br> \n <br> \nFuture management activities include continued Walleye fry stocking, fish surveys and winter dissolved oxygen monitoring. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Steep Bank Lake is in Lincoln County five miles northeast of the town of Hendricks.  It is 208 acres and has a maximum depth of seven feet.  The lake is highly productive and dense algae blooms frequently occur.  Fish summerkills can occur when algae die and decompose, often rapidly depleting the dissolved oxygen.  The last known summerkill occurred in 2012.  Steep Bank Lake also has a history of winterkills due to low oxygen, most recently in 2009. <br> \n <br> \nThis Standard Survey was conducted to collect routine fish population data using gill nets and trap nets.  These data can be compared to previous Standard and Targeted Surveys from Steep Bank Lake.  Walleyes were moderately abundant in 2023 and were from a wide range of sizes, including good numbers of fish over 20 inches.  Steep Bank Lake can be described as a \"boom or bust\" walleye fishery, and it's presently in the \"boom\" stage.  Fry stocking has maintained the walleye population and good numbers of young walleyes were found in 2023.   <br> \n <br> \nLow numbers of yellow perch were caught.  Most of them were yearlings that measured 5-7 inches.  Steep Bank has been known to produce large perch at times, however only two perch over 8 inches were caught in 2023.  The largest was 13 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nFuture management activities will include walleye fry stocking, fish surveys and winter dissolved oxygen monitoring. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Steep Bank Lake is located in Lincoln County in southwestern Minnesota.  It is a shallow, nutrient rich lake that experiences occasional winterkills.  Its notable game fish species include walleye, black crappie, yellow perch, and black bullhead.  A tremendous walleye population was present in 1993, but the lake winterkilled in early 1994.  Most of the adult walleye died, but a fair number of young walleye from the 1993 year class survived.  About 100,000 walleye fry were stocked in 1995.  In 1996 walleye abundance was within the normal range for similar lakes, however it was much lower than in 1993.  The walleye in 1996 were from the 1993 and 1995 year classes and were about 8 and 18 inches long.  Considering all available data for Steep Bank Lake, fry stocking appears to be primarily responsible for maintaining the walleye population.  Walleye will continue to be stocked two out of three years.     Black crappie were introduced in 1995 and 1996 when a total of 407 adults were stocked.  They experienced a very successful spawn in 1996 and numerous young-of-year were present.  If these young fish experience good survival, anglers can expect them to be about 8 inches long by 1998.  It is hoped this species will provide additional angling opportunities.  Other species that were abundant enough in 1996 to attract angler attention included yellow perch and black bullhead.  Northern pike were present in the lake, but in very low numbers.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Steep Bank is a 208 acre, nutrient rich lake located in Lincoln County in southwest Minnesota.  Due to its shallow and productive nature, Steep Bank Lake has experienced occasional winterkill.  The last documented winterkill occurred in 2001, when gamefish populations were completely eliminated.  Dissolved oxygen concentrations declined to low levels again in 2005.  However, a large area of adequate concentrations remained and extensive winterkill is not expected.     Walleye were abundant in 2005.  The majority of sampled walleye belonged to the 2001 and 2002 year classes and measured 16-21 inches.  These classes remained abundant in spite of being subjected to intense angling pressure in 2004.  Locals reported over counting over 100 anglers on the lake on several occasions during June, 2004.  An abundance of forage fish, primarily fathead minnows, small black bullhead and walleye, likely attributed to low angler success in 2005.  Angler success should improve in 2006 as forage abundance appeared to decrease.       Approximately 100,000 walleye fry were stocked into Steep Bank Lake in 2005.  This stocking worked well as young-of-year walleye were extremely abundant during fall night electrofishing.  Walleye from the 2005 year class should measure 12-14 inches by fall, 2006.     Black bullhead were abundant in 2005.  Most sampled bullhead measured 6-7 inches and should measure 8-10 inches in 2006.      Fisheries management activities for Steep Bank Lake include annual monitoring of winter dissolved oxygen concentrations and angling pressure, stocking as needed, and a fisheries assessment in 2008.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>     Steep Bank Lake is located in Lincoln County five miles northeast of Hendricks.  It measures 208 acres and has a maximum depth of 7 feet.  It is highly productive and prone to winterkill.  Winterkills occurred during the winters of 1980-81, 1981-82, 1993-94, 2000-01, and 2008-09. <br> \n     Steep Bank Lake is managed as a boom or bust walleye fishery.  Walleye are maintained by fry stocking as spawning success by them has been poor.  Walleye were abundant in 2011.  The majority of the adults were 14-16 inches and from a 2009 fry stocking.  By spring of 2012 they will have grown to 16-18 inches.  Steep Bank walleye generally experience very good growth due to abundant fathead minnows. <br> \n     108,000 walleye fry were stocked during the spring of 2011.  Survival was good and young walleye were extremely abundant during fall electrofishing.  With two strong year classes of walleye present (2009 and 2011), anglers can expect good walleye fishing in the future as long as winterkill doesn't occur. <br> \n     No other adult game fish were abundant, however a strong 2011 yellow perch year class was present.  They were growing fast and could possibly be 9 inches by late 2012. <br> \n     Black bullhead and common carp abundances remained low and these species have not developed substantial populations in recent years. <br> \n     Future management activities include walleye stocking, fish abundance assessments, winter dissolved oxygen monitoring, and ice house counts.</p>",

The most recent fish survey (2017) indicated quality Walleye and Yellow Perch populations were present.  Steep Bank Lake is highly productive and dense algae blooms frequently occur.   <br> \n <br> \nWinterkills occurred during the winters of 1980-81, 1981-82, 1993-94, 2000-01 and 2008-09.  Low oxygen levels occurred the winters of 2010-11 and 2013-2014 but no significant kills resulted.  A moderate to severe summerkill occurred in 2012 due to low oxygen levels which resulted from decomposing algae. <br> \n <br> \nNear record amounts of snow fell in the area during the winter of 2018-2019.  By mid-March dissolved oxygen readings in Steep Bank Lake were zero from top to bottom, indicating potential winterkill conditions.  Some dead Common Carp and Walleyes were observed along shore during ice-out.  Three trap nets were set to check for the presence of gamefish.  Walleye and Yellow Perch were caught in high numbers from various sizes, indicating that winterkill was likely minimal.      <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Steep Bank Lake is located in Lincoln County in southwestern Minnesota.  It is a shallow, nutrient rich lake that experiences occasional winterkills.  The last documented winterkill occurred in 1993, when an abundant population of walleye was substantially reduced.     A moderate walleye population was recorded in 1999.  The population was comprised of mainly larger fish, with 68% greater than 19 inches.  Strong 1998 and 1999 year classes should substantially increase the 12-15 inch population for the next few years.  Available data suggests that fry stocking is primarily responsible for maintaining the walleye population, although natural reproduction has also been shown to contribute.     Yellow perch abundance was the second highest recorded for this lake.  Growth rates were fast.  Age 2 perch had obtained lengths of 8.5-9.5 inches.  Fish as large as 13 inches were also collected.  Yellow perch reproduction in 1999 was exceptional.     Northern pike were found in low abundance, although their numbers are consistant with past assessments.  Pike as large as 29 inches were caught and had relatively fast growth.     Black crappie were introduced in 1995 and 1996 when a total of 407 adults were stocked.  Although no crappie were caught with gill or 3/4\" trap nets, a moderate number of young-of-year crappie were observed, indicating a reproducing population is still present.     Moderate populations of black bullhead, carp and white sucker were present.  A considerable number of the bullhead measured over 8.5 inches.      Management plans for Steep Bank Lake include annual winter dissolved oxygen monitoring, stocking 104,000 walleye fry in two of three years and fisheries assessments every three years to evaluate management practices.   </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>CURRENT OVERALL CATCH RATES FROM ALL SAMPLING GEAR SHOWED INCREASES OF NOP, CAP, BUFFALO, BLG AND WAE AND DECREASES OF WTS AND BLB.  A TOTAL OF 13 NOP REPRESENTING FOUR YEAR CLASSES, 1985 (AGE 5+) THROUGH 1988 (AGE 2+) WERE SAMPLED IN THIS INVESTIGATION, WHILE THIS IS A 69% INCREASE OVER THE 1987 INITIAL LAKE SURVEY, CATCH PER EFFORT NUMBERS ARE STILL BELOW STATE AND LOCAL MEDIANS FOR BOTH GILLNETS AND TRAPNETS.  THESE FISH RANGED IN LENGTH FROM 23.1 TO 34.9 INCHES WITH A MEAN LENGTH AT CAPTURE OF 28.9 INCHES.  MEAN WEIGHT OF FISH FROM GILLNETS AND TRAPNETS WAS 6.7 POUNDS. SEVERAL FISH BETWEEN 10 AND 12 POUNDS WERE CAUGHT IN 1/4 INCH TRAPNETS DURING THE NATURAL REPRODUCTION SAMPLING.  GROWTH RATES OF ALL YEAR CLASSES WERE FAST, APPROXIMATELY 1.6 TIMES THE STATE WIDE AVERAGE.  NO NATURAL REPRODUCTION OF NOP HAS BEEN DOCUMENTED IN STEEP BANK LAKE.  THE CURRENT PIKE POPULATION MAY BE THE RESULT OF IMMIGRATION DURING HIGH WATER YEARS FROM THE NORTH FORK OF THE YELLOW MEDICINE RIVER.  BLGS SAMPLED IN THIS ASSESSMENT REPRESENTED ADULT FISH WHICH WERE STOCKED AT 5.7 FISH/POUND FROM A STUNTED POPULATION FOUND OUTSIDE THE ORTONVILLE MANAGEMENT AREA.  SOME GROWTH HAD OCCURRED FROM STOCKING TO CAPTURE AS THE RATE HAD DECREASED TO 4.1 FISH/ POUND IN THIS INVESTIGATION.  THESE FISH REPRESENTED TWO YEAR CLASSES 1983 (AGE 7+) AND 1984 (AGE 6+).  GROWTH RATES BASED ON AVERAGE BACK CALCULATED LENGTHS WERE GREATER THAN 20% SLOWER THAN STATE WIDE AVERAGES.  MEAN INDIVIDUAL LENGTH AND WEIGHT CAPTURE WERE 6.5 INCHES AND 0.2 POUNDS RESPECTIVELY.  NO NATURAL REPRODUCTION FROM THESE ADULT BLGS WAS SAMPLED IN THIS INVESTIGATION.  WAE CATCH PER EFFORT NEMBERS INCREASED DRAMATICALLY FROM 1.33 FISH AT 0.67 POUNDS PER GILLNET SET IN 1987 TO 21.0 FISH AT 29.5 POUNDS PER SET IN THIS SEASONS' SAMPLING.  WAE WERE ALSO CAPTURED IN TRAPNETS FOR THE FIRST TIME IN THIS INVESTIGATION. A TOTAL OF 43 FISH WEIGHING 68.7 POUNDS WERE SAMPLED.  CATCH RATE FOR WAE IN TRAP NETS IS CURRENTLY 7.2 FISH WEIGHING 11.4 POUNDS PER SET AND IS MORE THAN 10 TIMES THE STATE AND LOCAL MEDIANS.  ONE HUNDRED TWELVE WAE FROM FOUR YEAR CLASSES, 1986 (AGE 4+) THROUGH 1989 (AGE 1+) WERE SAMPLED IN THIS ASSESSMENT NETTING.  THREE OF THESE YEAR CLASSES REPRESENT YEARS OF WAE STOCKING.  IN 1986 AND 1988 WAE FRY WERE STOCKED. A SHIFT WAS MADE TO FINGERLING STOCKING IN 1989 TO ADDRESS A PERCEIVED PREDATION PROBLEM.  THE 1987 (AGE 3+) YEAR CLASS RANKED SECOND IN STRENGTH IN OUR SAMPLING AND REPRESENTS FISH WHICH WERE NATURALLY REPRODUCED.  A 1989 NATURAL REPRODUCTION CHECK ON STEEP BANK LAKE SAMPLED NATURALLY REPRODUCED WAE FINGERLINGS BY SEINING, AT THAT TIME THESE FISH RANGED IN LENGTH FROM 6.1 TO 6.8 INCHES.  WHILE NO YOUNG OF THE YEAR WAES WERE SAMPLED IN THIS INVESTIGATION, NATURAL REPRODUCTION APPEARS TO BE MAKING A SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTION TO THE WAE POPULATION.  GROWTH RATES FOR ALL YEAR CLASSES WERE FAST, GREATER THAN 20% FASTER THAN STATE WIDE AVERAGES.  THIS GROWTH CORRESPONDS FAVORABLY WITH RATES FROM SIMILAR AREA WAE LAKES.  TWELVE ADDITIONAL ADULT WAES WERE CAPTURED IN 1/4 INCH TRAPNETS.  SIX OF THESE FISH APPEAR IN THE DISBCAL LENGTH AT CAPTURE AND BACK CALCULATED LENGTH TABLES AND IN THE AGE AND GROWTH RATES TABLES FOUND ON PAGE NINE.  THESE FISH DO NOT APPEAR IN AGE CLASS DISTRIBUTION OR LENGTH FREQUENCY TABLES BECAUSE WHOLE NET SUBSAMPLES WERE NOT MEASURED FROM THIS SAMPLING GEAR.  NON GAME SPECIES NUMBERS HAVE SHIFTED SOMEWHAT SINCE THE INITIAL LAKE SURVEY IN 1987.  BLB NUMBERS DROPPED BY 63% FROM 178.3 FISH PER SET TO 67 FISH PER SET, BUT ARE STILL WELL ABOVE STATE AND LOCAL MEDIANS. THIS DECREASE MAY BE ATTRIBUTED TO THE DRAMATIC INCREASE IN WAE NUMBERS AND SIZE AND SUBSEQUENT PREDATION UPON BULLHEADS.  WTS NUMBERS ALSO DROPPED BY 50%.  CAP NUMBERS INCREASED 2.5 TIMES FROM 6.67 PER GILLNET SET IN 1987 TO 16.67 FISH PER SET IN THIS INVESTIGTION.  BIB APPEARED IN OUR SAMPLING FOR THE FIRST TIME IN 1990.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Steep Bank is a 208 acre, nutrient rich lake located in Lincoln County in southwest Minnesota.  Due to its shallow and productive nature, Steep Bank Lake has experienced occasional winterkill.  The last documented winterkill occurred in 2001 when gamefish populations and majority of common carp were eliminated.       According to testnetting, walleye were abundant in 2003.  Most walleye came from a post winterkill, 2001 fry stocking.  Walleye from the 2002 fry stocking were also sampled.  Sampled walleye were growing fast and the majority measured 14-15 inches.  Due to abundant forage, particularily fathead minnows, walleye could be difficult to catch.  Low angler success was reported during the winter of 2003/2004.  Walleye fry and yearlings are scheduled to be stocked in the spring of 2004.  If these stockings are successful in reducing forage abundance, larger walleye should become more catchable.  Due to Steep Banks winterkill potential, anglers are encouraged to harvest walleye they catch.     Black bullhead were also abundant.  Although most measured 5-8 inches, a good number of 10-13 inch fish were also sampled.  Steep Bank would provide a good opportunity for anglers looking to catch some quality sized black bullhead.     Common carp were moderately abundant.  Carp surviving the 2001 winterkill have reestiblished their population.  An increase in carp abundance would be to the detriment of habitat and water quality of Steep Bank Lake.     One hybrid sunfish and one white sucker were also sampled in the 2003 investigation.  This was the hybrid sunfish documented in Steep Bank Lake.     Management activities scheduled for Steep Bank Lake include anual monitoring of winter dissolved oxygen and fishing pressure, stocking as needed, annual young-of-year walleye electrofishing evaluations, and lake survey in 2006.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Steep Bank Lake is a shallow nutrient rich lake located in Lincoln County in southwestern Minnesota.  It     is presently managed for walleye and is subject to occasional winterkills.  The catch of walleye increased     from 1 fish per gill net in 1987 to 21 in 1990 and to 71 in 1993.  Walleye fry were stocked in 1981, 1982,     1984, 1986, 1988, and 1993.  A concern that fry stocking was not working due to predation by black bullhead     led to fingerling stockings in 1989 and 1991.  However, the 1990 population assessment showed strong walleye     year classes which corresponded to years of fry stocking.  Therefore, a switch back to fry stocking occurred     in 1993.  A good size range of walleye existed in 1993 as can be seen in the preceding length-frequency table.      Young-of-year up to seven year old walleye were present.  The majority of the adult walleye weighed from two     to four pounds and anglers reported nice catches of these fish during the spring.  Considering all available     data, the majority of Steep Bank's walleye population appears to consist of stocked fish.  Walleye fry     stocking will be continued in an attempt to maintain a quality walleye fishery. A substantial decrease in bullhead abundance occurred from 1987-1993, the period when walleye abundance     increased dramatically.  It appears that walleye may be effectively controlling black bullhead abundance. Yellow perch were not caught in the 1987 and 1990 assessments, low numbers were caught in 1993.  They     were abundant during a 1968 game survey.  Yellow perch probably experienced a severe winterkill in 1981-1982     and are struggling to become reestablished.  If yellow perch become abundant again, they may buffer any     effects of walleye predation on black bullhead which could result in increased bullhead numbers. Although bluegill and black crappie have been stocked in past years, these species were not caught in the     1993 assessment.  The most recent bluegill stocking occurred in 1990 when 251 adults were introduced.  Black     crappie have not been stocked since 1978 and no information is available regarding the success of that     stocking.  Either it failed, or black crappie winterkilled in 1981-1982. A total of three northern pike were sampled during the 1993 assessment.  It doesn't appear that this     species has ever been very abundant.</p>",
