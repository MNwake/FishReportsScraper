                "narrative": "<p>Lake Benton, located in Lincoln County on the Minnesota-South Dakota border, is a class 41 lake.  This 2,857-acre lake is managed primarily for walleye and secondarily for northern pike, black crappie, bluegill, and yellow perch.  Lake Benton has had historical problems with curlyleaf pondweed (an exotic).  Curlyleaf pondweed was not documented in a lake survey in 1983, however was documented in 1992.  This prolific exotic macrophyte has caused problems with recreational boaters at certain times of the year and tends to choke out the native vegetation.  Like most issues, there are positives and negatives with curlyleaf pondweed.  It is possible that curlyleaf pondweed has created nursery area or additional spawning habitat for some species.  Walleye fingerlings have not been stocked in Lake Benton since 1982 however fry have been stocked in 1983, 1985, 1988, 1990, 1991, 1993, 1994, 1998, and 2000.  Walleye natural reproduction will be assessed in years not stocked.      The average walleye catch rate was 36.60 fish/gill net.  The catch rate for walleye was more than 2 times the upper average range (15.33 fish/gill net) for this lake class.  Total lengths of walleye captured in gill nets ranged from 10.91 to 27.24 inches with a mean of 17.99 inches.  The data indicates the population relative abundance was nearly the largest ever documented and in addition indicates a large size structure.  Six seine hauls captured 2 Age 0 walleye which indicated either fry survival and/or natural reproduction.  The \"take-home\" message is that good numbers and sizes of walleyes are available for anglers.  Some local anglers and bait dealers have said fishing has never been better.     The average northern pike population catch rate was 0.60 fish/gill net.  The catch rate for northern pike in gill nets was half the lower average range (1.20 fish/gill net) for this lake class.  Historical gill net catches for northern pike have never been higher than the average range (3.5 fish/gill net) which is indicative of a low density population.  The northern pike catch rate in trap nets (0.15 fish/trap net) further indicate this low density population.  Data from the 1992 survey judged spawning habitat for northern pike to be \"fair\" because of wetlands accessability.       The average yellow perch population catch rate was 73.40 fish/gill net.  The catch rate of yellow perch was largest ever documented on Lake Benton and was more than 3 times the 75% quartile (22.50 fish/gill net) for this lake class.  Total lengths of yellow perch captured in gill nets ranged from 5.16 to 11.97 inches with a mean of 7.14 inches.  Most of the fish were from the 1997 (36%), 1998 (27%), and the 1999 (34%) year classes.  Six seine hauls produced 39 Age 0 yellow perch which indicated some natural reproduction in 2000.  Some great perch fishing can be had during the winter of 2000-2001 but the next few years could be phenomenal.     The average black crappie population catch rate was 1.85 fish/trap net.  The catch rate of black crappie in trap nets was less than the upper average range (1.85 fish/trap net) for this lake class.  Total lengths of black crappie caught in trap nets ranged from 5.16 to 12.24 inches with a mean of 9.47 inches.     The average bluegill trap net catch rate was 0.38 fish/trap net. The catch rate for bluegill in trap nets was less than the lower average range (0.38 fish/trap net) for this lake class.      The average black bullhead gill net catch rate was 83.20 fish/gill net.  The catch rate for black bullhead in gill nets was the largest ever recorded on Lake Benton and slightly higher than the upper average range (83.00 fish/gill net) for this lake class.  The average black bullhead trap net catch rate was 45.85 fish/trap net.  The catch rate for black bullhead in trap nets in 2000 was the second highest catch ever recorded on Lake Benton and was greater than the average range (14.73 fish/trap net) for this lake class.  The data suggests a high density black bullhead population with a relatively large size structure is present compared to other area lakes.  Good action could be had with an occasional \"trophy\" being caught.  This population provides a good chance to teach kids how to fish because of the action provided by this population.     The average common carp trap net catch rate was 4.92 fish/trap net. Total lengths of common carp captured in trap nets ranged from 14.53 to 30.31 inches with a mean of 21.15 inches.  The average common carp gill net catch rate was 0 fish/gill net. This data indicates that common carp might not be captured easily with the use of gill nets in Lake Benton.  This population might provide a unique situation for some real large carp to be caught.     To promote and maintain healthy fish populations, pollution and other inputs need to be controlled.  Fish habitats are directly affected by water quality.  Nutrient, sediment and other waste inputs can drastically alter the biological, chemical, and physical components of a lake.  It is paramount to maintain if not improve the current water quality of Lake Benton through watershed management to preserve this fishery for future generations to enjoy.                </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Benton is a 2,875 acre lake which is located in the city of Lake Benton in Lincoln County.  The lake has 18.1 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of nine feet.  Benton is presently managed for walleye as the primary species while northern pike, yellow perch, bluegill, and black crappie are managed secondarily.  The curlyleaf pondweed stand which appeared in the 1980's has expanded to eventually become the focal point of concern in the city of Lake Benton and around the lake itself.  A group was formed to study ways to eradicate the curlyleaf from Lake Benton.  Although this particular exotic plant has social and biological drawbacks, it contributes to improved water quality and a diverse, relatively stable fish population like none other in Southwestern Minnesota.  A creel survey conducted during the 1996 open-water season and the 1996-97 winter season documented Lake Benton's importance as a regional fishing and tourist destination.  Total estimated fishing pressure was 13.4 angler hours per acre, a figure comparable to that found statewide for lakes less than 100,000 acres.  The economic value of this fishery during the 1996 season was estimated to be approximately $670,000, much of which is money spent in the immediate area.The walleye population looks in good shape for lakes similar to Lake Benton.  Lengths of walleye caught in our nets ranged from 8.3 to 24.6 inches and averaged 22.0 inches.  Seven different age groups of walleye were observed during our assessment from age 1 to age 9.  We presently stock walleye fry every other year and it is apparent that the curlyleaf stand offers a place for the small fish to hide so they have better survival than in lakes with no vegetation.The yellow perch population is similar to other lakes like Lake Benton.  Lengths of yellow perch caught in our nets ranged from 6.2 to 9.2 inches and averaged 8.0 inches.The northern pike population also looks good for lakes similar  to Lake Benton.  Lengths of northern pike caught in our nets ranged from 18.7 to 38.6 inches and averaged 29.3 inches.  Half of the fish sampled in trap nets were 35 inches or longer.If you're looking for trophy bluegill in Southwest Minnesota, Lake Benton may be the lake for you to try.  The numbers are about average for lakes similar to Lake Benton but several of the fish were 12 inches or longer.  Lengths ranged from 4.6 to 13.2 inches and averaged 10.3 inches.  As with the walleye population, it appears the curlyleaf stand also benefits the bluegill population.The black crappie population is similar to other lakes like Lake Benton.  Lenghts of black crappie caught in our nets ranged from 7.2 to 11.2 inches and averaged 7.9 inches.  Only age 2 black crappie were sampled during the assessment.Other species of fish caught in our nets included common carp and white suckers.To promote and maintain healthy fish populations, pollution and other inputs need to be controlled.  Fish habitats are directly affected by water quality.  Nutrient, sediment and other waste inputs can drastically alter the biological, chemical, and physical components of a lake.  It is important to maintain if not improve the current water quality of Lake Benton through watershed management to preserve this fishery for future generations to enjoy.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Benton is a 2,857-acre shallow lake located in Lincoln County nine miles east of the Minnesota-South Dakota border and adjacent to the city of Lake Benton.  Lake Benton has a maximum depth of 9 ft, a 10 year average water clarity of 1.8 feet (range = 0.5-2.5), and at times supports vegetation to 8 feet.  Recently, vegetation is sparse and is composed of native species (sago and coontail) with some patches of invasive curly leaf pondweed on the north end of the lake.  Curly leaf pondweed was at one time very prolific and covered nearly 100% of the surface water.  After Floridone chemical treatments from 2005 to 2009 and again in 2017, comparatively the lake has been nearly devoid of curly leaf pondweed.  A population assessment was conducted the week of July 31st, 2017 with 6 gill nets and 15 trap nets to assess the managed fish species. <br> \n <br> \nWALLEYE <br> \nTwo hundred and seventeen Walleye were caught in the fish netting assessment.  The gillnet catch rate of 26.8 per net exceeded the normal range for similar lakes.  Additionally, the catch rate exceeds the long-term average of 23.1 per gillnet.  While the catch rate of Walleye is high compared to past surveys, the size structure of Walleye is less than desired in the short term.  The average length of Walleyes caught was just over 13 inches in gill nets and just shy of 11 inches in trap nets with a range of 7.7 to 26.1 inches.    Walleye are currently dominated by 1-year-old and 2-year-old fish making up 88% of the sample and corresponds to stocked years.  But, on the bright side, natural reproduction does occur frequently on Lake Benton and has been found in each non-stocked year starting in 2008 (2008, 2011, 2014, and 2017).  Occasionally natural reproduction does result in strong year classes that adds to the fishery.  Currently, anglers should expect to catch many small Walleyes which could result in some good action.  However, growth in Lake Benton is good so harvestable Walleye will be caught by next year.   <br> \n <br> \nNORTHERN PIKE <br> \nSix Northern Pike were caught in gillnets and trap nets in 2017.  The gillnet catch rate of 0.5 per net was less than the normal range for similar lakes statewide, but within the Windom Area normal range.  Windom Area lakes typically have low abundance Northern Pike populations due to degraded habitat for spawning (low aquatic vegetation density), for predation (low visibility water), and for thermal requirements (hot summer water temperatures).  However, at times, Lake Benton can have a decent population of Northern Pike, usually a result of stocking.  The Northern Pike abundance in Lake Benton will continue to be low, however, the new southern zone regulation of 2 daily with a 24 inch minimum size starting in May 2018 may stabilize the Northern Pike population.       <br> \n <br> \nYELLOW PERCH <br> \nOver 500 Yellow Perch were sampled in gillnets and trap nets in 2017.  The gillnet catch rate of 87.3 per net is the second highest ever recorded and the highest since 2006.  The size structure of the Yellow Perch was good with an average length of 8.5 inches in gill nets with a possibility to catch fish all the way up to 13 inches.  The physical condition of the Yellow Perch was excellent with plump fish common.  Currently, the Lake Benton Yellow Perch population is healthy with many harvestable sized fish out there!        <br> \n <br> \nBLACK CRAPPIE <br> \nOnly 10 Black Crappie were caught in gillnets and trap nets.  The trap net abundance of 0.5 per net is less than the normal range for similar lakes.  Black Crappie have had a catch rate less than the normal range since 2013.  Black Crappie are stocked sporadically by the Lake Benton Sports Club to maintain a population.   <br> \n <br> \nBLUEGILL <br> \nOnly 8 Bluegill were caught in gillnets and trap nets.  The trap net catch rate of 0.5 per net is less than the normal range for similar lakes.  As with Black Crappie, Bluegill are a low abundance population that is stocked sporadically by the Lake Benton Sports Club.  Future efforts to maintain Bluegill will also be reliant on the club to continue stocking as the Windom Area Fisheries will not stock Bluegill due to lack of desirable habitat.   <br> \n <br> \nOTHER SPECIES  <br> \nOther species sampled in Lake Benton in 2017 were Black Bullhead, Common Carp, Green Sunfish, Largemouth Bass, and White Sucker.  Black Bullhead, Common Carp, and White Sucker numbers are all within or greater than normal ranges for each species.  Black Bullhead and Common Carp are species that lead to habitat degradation through resuspension of benthic sediments.  However, murky water can be beneficial for Walleye but too many Black Bullhead and Common Carp are detrimental to all species.  Green Sunfish and Largemouth Bass are in very low abundance and may be utilizing limited habitat that will likely continue to suppress their abundance as is the case with Bluegill in Lake Benton.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Benton is a nearly 3,000 acre lake located in Lincoln County nine miles east of the Minnesota-South Dakota border and adjacent to the city of Lake Benton.  Lake Benton has a maximum depth of 9 ft, fairly murky water (10 year summer average water clarity of 1.8 feet), and at times supports vegetation to 8 feet.  Recently, native vegetation is sparse and is composed of sago pond weed and coontail.  Invasive curly-leaf pondweed does occur from time-to-time and is found more recently on the east end of the lake.  Curly-leaf pondweed was at one time very prolific and covered nearly 100% of the surface water.  Chemical treatment by Lincoln County from 2005 to 2009 virtually eliminated the actively growing plants until 2018 when it re-emerged likely via dormant seedbank in the sediment lake bottom.  Treatment was utilized again in 2019 on the east end and has helped to temporarily keep the invasive curly-leaf pondweed at bay.     <br> \n <br> \nThe lake is primarily managed and stocked every other year with Walleye.  Other species stocked and managed are Northern Pike and Yellow Perch, however, they are only stocked when needed to boost the population. Fish netting was conducted during the week of July 29th, 2019 with 5 gill nets and 15 trap nets to assess Walleye, Northern Pike, and Yellow Perch. <br> \n <br> \nWALLEYE <br> \nJust under 180 Walleye were caught in gillnets and trap nets.  The gillnet catch rate of 27.6 per net was more than expected.  Additionally, the catch rate was higher than the long-term average (17 surveys since 1956) of 23.4 per gillnet.  The length of Walleye in Lake Benton improved since the 2015 and 2017 lake surveys.  Just over half of the Walleye in the sample were between 15 and 20 inches with fish caught up to 27 inches.  The overall health of each fish was good.  The 2016 (age-3) and 2018 (age-1) stocked years made up 90% of the sample.  Additionally, an encouraging point is that natural reproduction does occur frequently on Lake Benton and has been found in each non-stocked year since 2008.  Occasionally natural reproduction does result in strong year classes that adds to the fishery.  Lower Mississippi Strain Walleye (LMS Walleye, Lake Sarah Egg Take) are being utilized during fry stocking (every other year) to increase the potential of natural reproduction in the future due to the success of LMS Walleye in other southern Minnesota Lakes.  Several more year classes of Walleye in Lake Benton would be beneficial to continue the rebound that has been observed since 2015.  To ensure that, Walleye numbers will be monitored closely with another Lake survey in 2021.  Currently, the Walleye population will provide an excellent fishing opportunity with 2 very strong year classes of Walleye that range from 12.5 inches to 20.5 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nNORTHERN PIKE <br> \nMore Northern Pike were caught in gillnets and trap nets in 2019 than expected.  The gillnet catch of just under 2 per net was within the normal range for similar lakes statewide but was more than other Windom Area lakes.  Windom Area lakes typically have low abundance Northern Pike populations due to degraded habitat for spawning (low aquatic vegetation density), for predation (high turbidity), and for water temperature (80 plus Fahrenheit summer water temperatures).  Lake Benton does have a decent population of Northern Pike from time-to-time.  This was the case in 2019.  The gill net catch was the 2nd highest on record and the trap net catch rate was above the long-term average.  The Northern Pike abundance in Lake Benton appears to be improving.  This could be due to the new southern zone regulation (2 daily limit with a 24 inch minimum size) that started in 2018.  Additionally, our high water years the last three years could have improved Northern Pike spawning habitat either in Lake Benton or adjacent wetlands.  The population will be monitored to determine if the regulation is increasing the population or if improving habitat may be responsible.       <br> \n <br> \nYELLOW PERCH <br> \nMany Yellow Perch were sampled in gillnets and trap nets in 2019.  The gillnet catch rate of 72.6 per net is the fourth highest ever recorded.  The size of the Yellow Perch in the measured sample was good.  The average length of Yellow Perch was just over 9.5 inches in gill nets and just under 6 inches in trap nets with a range from 4.5 to 12.5 inches.  The physical condition of the Yellow Perch was good indicating plump fish that are finding enough to eat.  Currently, the Lake Benton Yellow Perch population is balanced and has larger fish that should entice anglers.        <br> \n <br> \nOTHER SPECIES  <br> \nOther species sampled in Lake Benton in 2017 were Bluegill, Black Crappie, Black Bullhead, Common Carp, Green Sunfish, Orangespotted Sunfish, and White Sucker.  Bluegill, Black Crappie, Black Bullhead, Common Carp, and White Sucker numbers are all within or more than expected ranges for each species.  Black Bullhead and Common Carp are species that lead to habitat degradation through resuspension of muck and sediment.  Green Sunfish and Orangespotted Sunfish were found in low abundance and were limited to nearshore rocky habitat.   <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Benton is located in Lincoln County on the Minnesota-South Dakota border.  This 2,857-acre lake is managed primarily for walleye and secondarily for northern pike, black crappie, bluegill, and yellow perch.  Curlyleaf pondweed has been the focus of much attention in the last few years.  Curlyleaf pondweed was not documented in a lake survey in 1983, however was documented in 1992.  This prolific exotic macrophyte has been perceived as negatively impacting the resource by limiting native aquatic vegetation and recreational boating at certain times of the year.  Curlyleaf pondweed was not documented in a lake survey in 1983, however it was found in 1992.  In the first year of a 3-5 year trial, 2 experimental whole lake treatments using fluridone were initiated in 2005 to reduce curlyleaf pondweed to manageable levels.  As a result of this experimental treatment, the Windom Area Office will monitor the fish community for the next three years to document the potential effects of fluridone.  Currently, walleye fry are to be stocked two out of three years at 1000 walleye/ littoral acre.  A population assessment was conducted during the week of July 18, 2005 using 6 gill nets and 13 trap nets.The walleye catch rate in gill nets was the lowest catch rate ever documented by DNR netting.  The average length walleye was just over 17 inches.  Despite the low catch rate in gill nets, the catch rate in trap nets, which was greater than expected.  On a positive note, several walleyes were captured from the fry stocking in 2005, which may indicate good fry survival.  Much of the information collected suggested the larger sized walleye are in slightly better condition, which could be a result of the large numbers of small bullheads available as forage.  It is possible that the Lake Benton walleye population is in a building cycle and could provide some great fishing once the bullhead numbers begin to decline.The northern pike population has never been abundant, but usually the fish are quite healthy and good sized.  They averaged 27 inches and age analysis indicates they resulted from natural reproduction in 2001 and 2002.  The Windom Area pike populations can vary as a result of habitat conditions at the time of spawning.  Northern pike need water level and environmental conditions to be right in order for them to be successful in spawning.  It is our belief that northern pike fingerling stockings will provide a secondary predator for the fish community and provide some angling opportunities.  In an effort to build the population, northern pike fingerlings will be stocked in the spring of 2006 at a rate of 5 fingerlings/acre.    Yellow perch numbers were lower than desired.  The catch rate for yellow perch was 1.8 fish/gill net, which was below average.  Total lengths of yellow perch captured ranged from 6 to 10 inches and averaged just over 8 inches.  Due to the lack of smaller yellow perch sampled, it is likely that the large black bullhead population may be impacting natural reproduction of yellow perch.  Efforts to control black bullhead numbers will likely benefit the yellow perch population.  A few \"10-inchers\" can be caught if an angler is willing to put the time in.  However, if perch are your target, West Twin Lake might be a better option for your angling hours.Black crappie population numbers have not changed substantially over the last 10 years.  Total lengths of black crappie caught in trap nets ranged from 7 to 12 inches and averaged almost 9 inches.  Although the numbers of crappie are not exceedingly high, some \"slabs\" can be caught.  If  \"crappie\" is your targeted species, Lake Shetek has good numbers them.Bluegill numbers are not real high but these populations can change quickly.  Given the large mats of curlyleaf pondweed in Lake Benton, it is quite possible that within a year or two the population can change substantially due to the habitat conditions.  However, the shallow  basins in the pothole prairie region challenge bluegill populations due to wind action affecting spawning nests and water clarity.  Lake Benton has a history of producing some real trophy bluegills if you can find them.The black bullhead population is dominating the fish community in Lake Benton.  Unfortunately, many of the fish are not going to be \"keepers\".  Total lengths ranged from 5.9 to 13.3 inches with an average of 6.5 inches.  Trap nets did sample some larger (11-13 inch range) bullheads but overall caught mainly smaller fish.  There is no doubt that this population will provide some good action for fishing if you are looking to spend some time outdoors.  This might be a good opportunity to teach kids how to fish and at the same time keep them interested in the activity by catching some fish.To promote and maintain healthy fish populations, pollution and other inputs need to be controlled.  Fish habitats are directly affected by water quality.  Nutrient, sediment and other waste inputs can drastically alter the biological, chemical, and physical components of a lake.  It is paramount to maintain if not improve the current water quality of Lake Benton through watershed management to preserve this fishery for future generations to enjoy.      Other species captured were common carp, largemouth bass, white crappie, and white sucker.Prepared by Ryan Doorenbos</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>In conjunction with a standard gill net and trap net survey on Lake Benton in 2017, a nearshore survey was conducted.  Twenty-four sampling stations, located around the perimeter of Lake Benton, were sampled with backpack electrofishing and shoreline seining.  Ten species of fish were sampled.  Species included Black Bullhead, Black Crappie, Brook Stickleback, Common Carp, Fathead Minnow, Green Sunfish, Iowa Darter, Johnny Darter, White Sucker, and Yellow Perch.  A previous nearshore survey was done in 2011 and had all the same species as 2017 with the exception of Brook Stickleback, and had 4 additional species.  The 4 additional species in 2011 were Bluntnose Minnow, Bigmouth Buffalo, Bluegill, and Orangespotted Sunfish.  While the 2017 nearshore survey was a reduction in the diversity of species observed, there was 1 new species (Brook Stickleback) and many young-of-the-year present.  Young-of-the-year species included Black Bullhead, Black Crappie, Common Carp, Fathead Minnow, and White Sucker indicating good natural reproduction for each of those species.  The species diversity in the 2017 nearshore survey along with the species diversity in the standard gill net and trap net survey will be utilized to develop an index to assess biotic integrity of Lake Benton.  The index will be utilized to address potential watershed issues that could be fixed to improve conditions for the fish community. <br> \n <br> \nAn assessment of lakeshore habitat on Lake Benton was conducted on 8/7/2017.  The assessment consisted of 73 survey sites evenly spaced 400 meters around the lake.  The average lake wide habitat score was 65.5(+/- 2.8), indicating overall lakeshore habitat quality was low (50-65).  Sites with low habitat quality are typically developed and have a lower than expected amount of natural habitat. Vegetation has been removed from at least a portion of the shore frontage either in a small percent of all the canopy layers or from a large percent of at least one canopy layer (ex. shrub layer has been removed but trees and natural ground cover remain high).  Approximately 50 percent of the sites were developed with a mean score of 46.6(+/- 2.7), while undeveloped sites had a mean score of 84.8(+/- 2.2).  This habitat survey was designed to provide a means to quantify and compare lakeshore habitat between lakes. The Lake Benton shoreline habitat score is lower than the statewide lake score average of 73.6. <br> \n <br> \nPrepared by Nate Hodgins <br> \n</p>",

Lake Benton is managed primarily for Walleye and secondarily for Yellow Perch, Northern Pike, Black Crappie, and Bluegill.  Walleye are stocked every other year at Lake Benton, which allows for assessment of natural reproduction in non-stocked years.  Walleye were not stocked in 2020 because of the COVID-19 pandemic, so Walleye were stocked in 2021 despite being an \"off\" year.  A Walleye fry stocking evaluation using daytime electrofishing was conducted on September 21, 2021 to determine if the 2021 fry stocking was successful.   <br> \n <br> \nYoung-of-the-year Walleye were captured at a rate of 304.0 per hour, which indicates that the fry stocking was successful, natural reproduction occurred, or a combination of the two. Genetic analysis showed that over 90 percent of the YOY Walleye were from stocking.  Walleye fingerlings ranged in length from 4.8 to 7.3 inches and averaged 5.7 inches.  The 2021 year class is abundant and should be important in the Lake Benton Walleye population for years to come. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Benton is a 2,857-acre shallow windswept lake located in Lincoln County nine miles east of the Minnesota-South Dakota border and adjacent to the city of Lake Benton.  Lake Benton has a maximum depth of 9 feet, a 10 year average summer water clarity of 1.7 feet (range = 0.5-2.5), and at times supports vegetation to 8 feet.  The clarity reading was 1.0 in 2021 with reduced maximum depth to 8 feet as a result of recent drought conditions.  Recently, both submergent and emergent vegetation is sparse.  The native submergent composition is sago and coontail and invasive curly-leaf pondweed on the east end of the lake.  Curly-leaf pondweed was at one time very prolific and covered nearly 100% of the surface water.  Herbicidal treatment (Fluridone) done by Lincoln County from 2005 to 2009 virtually eliminated the plant until 2018 when it re-emerged.  Low dose Fluridone was utilized again by Lincoln County in 2019 on the east end and has helped to keep the curly-leaf at a lower density.     <br> \n <br> \nThe lake is primarily managed for Walleye and secondarily for Black Crappie, Bluegill, Northern Pike, and Yellow Perch.  A population assessment was conducted the week of August 2nd, 2021 with 5 gill nets and 15 trap nets to assess the managed fish species. <br> \n <br> \nWALLEYE <br> \nFifty-one Walleye were caught in 5 gillnets (N=41) and 15 trap nets (N=10).  The gillnet catch rate of 8.2 per net is within the expected catch range for similar lakes.  However, the catch rate is less than the long-term average of 22.5 per gillnet. This may be a result of angler harvest due to very successful angling since 2019 as well as the increase in Common Carp caught in the gill net sample (69.8 per gillnet!).  Common Carp tend clog the net with their dorsal and anal spines leaving little room for other species to be caught effectively.  With that said, the size structure of Walleye continues to improve from 2015 to present.  The vast majority of the Walleye in the sample were over 15 inches but less than 20 inches, with most fish in average body condition.  Walleye are currently dominated by the 2016 (age 5-Spicer Strain) and 2018 (age 3-Lower Mississippi Strain, LMS) year classes making up 71% of the aged fish sample, both fry stocked years, resulting in many fish ranging in length from 16 to 25 inches.  However, an encouraging point is that natural reproduction (LMS strain) does occur frequently on Lake Benton and has been found in each non-stocked year starting in 2008 (2008, 2011, 2014, 2017, 2019, and 2020).  Occasionally natural reproduction does result in strong year classes that adds to the fishery.  Currently, Lake Benton is stocked every other year with Walleye fry at a density of 500 fry per acre (N= 1,470,000 total) to observe natural reproduction in non-stocked years.  Lower Mississippi Strain Walleye (Lake Sarah spawn take) are being utilized during fry stocking to increase the potential of natural reproduction in the future due to the success of LMS Walleye in other southern Minnesota Lakes.  Encouragingly, a strong stocked year class appears to have resulted in 2021 with newly stocked fish showing up in the summer netting sample as well as the fall night electrofishing sample (catch rate of 304 per hour!).  Currently, the Lake Benton Walleye population is poised to provide a good fishing opportunity due to 2 very strong year classes of Walleye that range from 16 inches to 25 inches.  Additionally, the strong 2021 year class should continue the rebound that has been observed since 2015.   <br> \n <br> \nNORTHERN PIKE <br> \nForty-seven Northern Pike were caught in gillnets (N=15) and trap nets (N=32) in 2021, an increase from 20 caught in 2019.  The gillnet catch rate of 3.0 per net exceeded the Windom Area upper normal limit of 1.3 for similar lakes.  Windom Area lakes typically have low abundance Northern Pike populations due to degraded habitat for spawning (low aquatic vegetation density), for predation (high turbidity), and for thermal requirements (80 plus degree F summer water temperatures).  However, at times like in 2019 and 2021, Lake Benton can have a decent population of Northern Pike.  The 2021 gill net catch rate was the greatest on record and the trap net catch rate was nearly 3 times greater than the long-term average of 0.6 per net.  The Northern Pike abundance in Lake Benton appears to be improving.  This could be due to the new southern zone regulation of 2 daily limit with a 24 inch minimum size that could be protecting the adult population.  In 2021, 83% of the Northern Pike in the sample were less than 24 inches.  Northern Pike in the gill net sample ranged from 16.9 to 24.7 inches and ranged from 17.3 to 34.5 inches in the trap net sample.  The population will be monitored to determine if the regulation is increasing the population size distribution or determine if improving habitat may be responsible for the increase in reproduction.  Additionally, important spawning areas for Northern Pike could be identified and protected in order to help stabilize the population.  This would be a benefit not only to Norther Pike anglers, but would help to increase the abundance of a predator for young Common Carp.         <br> \n <br> \nYELLOW PERCH <br> \nThirty-two Yellow Perch were sampled in gillnets (N=27) and trap nets (N=5) in 2021, down substantially from 2017 and 2019 catches.  The gillnet catch rate of 5.4 per net is below the long term average of 48.5 per net, but within the normal range of 3.0 to 22.5 per net for similar lakes.  The size structure of the Yellow Perch in the measured sample was good.  The average length of Yellow Perch was 8.0 inches in gill nets and 5.7 inches in trap nets with a range from 5.4 to 13.0 inches.  The physical condition of the Yellow Perch was good.  Currently, the Lake Benton Yellow Perch population is within a normal abundance level with a balanced size distribution and some larger fish.  These adult fish should have the potential produce future year classes of Yellow Perch if habitat is present (flooded downed trees and branches along the shoreline).        <br> \n <br> \nBLACK CRAPPIE <br> \nNinety-seven Black Crappie were caught in gillnets (N=37) and trap nets (N=60) in 2021.  The trap net catch of 4.0 per net is within the normal range of 1.0 to 12.3 for similar lakes.  Black Crappie are sporadic in Lake Benton.  In 2019, the trap net catch rate was high at 11.9 per net, but the size distribution favored small fish less than 8 inches.  In 2021, it was apparent that the growth of Black Crappie was good over the course of 2 years with fish ranging from 5 to just under 13 inches.  The average length of Black Crappie in the trap net sample was just over 10 inches and is a net type that best samples Black Crappie.  Black Crappie are stocked sporadically by the Lake Benton Sports Club to maintain a population.   <br> \n <br> \nBLUEGILL <br> \nOnly 2 Bluegill, 7.5 and 8.5 inches, were caught in trap nets in 2021.  The trap net catch rate of 0.13 per net is less than the normal range of 1.1 to 14.9 per net for similar lakes.  As with Black Crappie, the Bluegill population is sporadic and private stocking by the Lake Benton Sports Club is what helps maintain the population.   <br> \n <br> \nOTHER SPECIES  <br> \nOther species sampled in Lake Benton in 2021 were Black Bullhead (N=229 in gill nets and N=374 in trap nets), Common Carp (N= 349 in gill nets and N=726 in trap nets), and White Sucker (N=26 in gill nets and N=4 in trap nets).  Black Bullhead and White Sucker numbers were observed within normal ranges for each species.  Common Carp numbers were well above what was expected for the species, and the greatest ever observed on Lake Benton.  This was highly unusual, and occurred during a time where dead Common Carp were starting to appear along the shoreline.  During August through October 2021 on Lake Benton there was a confirmed Carp Edema Virus (CEV) outbreak on the lake that resulted in a mass mortality limited to only Common Carp.  This should reduce numbers of Common Carp back to more typical levels.  Continued monitoring will be crucial to determine extent of the CEV related kill.  Common Carp, along with Black Bullhead, are species that can lead to habitat degradation through resuspension of benthic sediments.  Surveys since 2017 have indicated high abundances of each species, and given the CEV kill in 2021, there is reason to believe that the lake will experience reduced resuspension of sediments as a result of a potentially declining Common Carp population.  A fisheries survey will be conducted during the summer of 2023 to determine the extent of the Common Carp kill and whether any improvements in Lake Clarity have resulted.  In the meantime, a close eye will be given to Lake Benton to track and monitor any future Common Carp CEV outbreaks and potential kills.     <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Benton is a 2,857-acre class 41 lake located in Lincoln County nine miles east of the Minnesota-South Dakota border.  Lake Benton has a maximum depth of 9 feet, water clarity that rarely exceeds 2.5 feet in mid-summer, and in some years there is vegetation growth in depths to 8 feet.  In recent years though, vegetation is sparse with very few plants growing. Curly-leaf pondweed was at one time very prolific and covered nearly 100% of the surface water from the mid-1990's up to the mid-2000's.  Lakewide herbicide treatment (Fluridone) from 2005 to 2009 by Lincoln County nearly eliminated the plant until 2018 when it re-emerged.  Low dose Fluridone was utilized again by Lincoln County in 2019 on the east end, helping to keep the curly-leaf at a low density.     <br> \nThe lake is primarily managed for Walleye and secondarily for Black Crappie, Bluegill, Northern Pike, and Yellow Perch.  A fish assessment was conducted the week of July 24th, 2023 with 5 gill nets and 15 trap nets to assess the managed fish species. <br> \n <br> \nWALLEYE <br> \n <br> \nLake Benton, at times, can be an angling destination to pursue Walleye. Since 2010, the gill net catch rates during summer surveys has been above the current long-range average of 22.6 Walleye per gill net, except for 2021 when it dipped to 8.20 per gill net. The low catch rate of Walleye in 2021 was most likely due to a massive catch of Common Carp filling up the gill net.  Nonetheless, the average catch rate in Lake Benton has typically been greater than the 75% quartile for class 41 lakes in Minnesota (15.33 per gill net). In other words, Lake Benton is a Walleye factory! In 2023, the gill net catch rate remained above the long-term average with a catch rate of 24.8 per gill net. Ten different ages (ages 0-5, 7-9, and 12) of Walleye were present in the 2023 sample with ages 1, 2, and 3 being the most abundant representing 80% of all aged fish combined.  Walleye ranged in length from 4.5 to 27 inches with a mean length of just under 15 inches in gill nets and 9.5 inches in trap nets. While the Walleye population is dominated by smaller, younger fish, 39% of Walleye in the gill net sample were over 15 inches. Anglers tend to prefer harvesting Walleye over 15 inches, and Lake Benton has a decent opportunity to encounter harvestable Walleye. Walleye in Lake Benton are healthy with a balanced size structure and harvestable fish available now.  Growth of Walleye and overall relative abundance appears adequate to sustain Walleye into the near future.  <br> \n <br> \nBLACK CRAPPIE <br> \n <br> \nAngling for Black Crappie is extremely popular in Minnesota, and the Lake Benton Sportsman's Club has an interest in maintaining a fishable crappie population in Lake Benton. The Lake Benton Sportsman's Club regularly applies for a permit from the Minnesota DNR to stock Black Crappie in Lake Benton. Black Crappie were last purchased in 2020 by The Lake Benton Sportsman's Club and a private supplier stocked 200 adult fish. When stocking Black Crappie it is important to stock adults prior to spring spawning so they can potentially boost the population via spawning in the same year, either within stocked fish or adding to spawning among the existing population. Since 2019, Black Crappie abundance has been above the long-term trap net average of 3.44 per trap net. In 2023, the trap net catch rate was 7.0 per net. Additionally, the gill net catch rate was 5.2 per net. The size structure of Black Crappie caught in gill nets and trap nets in 2023 favored larger fish over 10 inches. Two main size groups of Black Crappie were observed in trap nets, fish in the 5.5-7.5 inch range and fish over 10 inches. Black Crappie angling could be very good over the next several years with many 11-13 inch fish harvested.   <br> \n <br> \nBLUEGILL <br> \n <br> \nBluegill are another secondary management species in Lake Benton. Bluegill are relatively rare in Lake Benton as habitat is not conducive to high survival. Bluegill have not exceeded the long-term trap net catch rate of 4.8 per net since 1996 which was the same time period when Curly-leaf Pondweed covered most of Lake Benton.  Bluegill abundance and aquatic vegetation are closely linked. The catch rate of Bluegill in 2023 was 2 per trap net. Thirty-one Bluegill ranging from nearly 3.5 inches to just under 10 inches were sampled with a mean length of 6 inches.  The Lake Benton Sportsmen's Club also purchased 400 adult Bluegill in 2020.  Angling for Bluegill will be difficult with a sparse population, however, if a fish is caught it will most likely be a larger individual.      <br> \n <br> \nNORTHERN PIKE <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike abundance in gill net samples has been at or above the long-term average of 1 per net over the past 3 surveys (since 2019). During 2023, the gill net catch rate was 1.2 per net and the trap net catch rate was 1 per trap net. Twenty-one Northern Pike were caught in gill nets and trap nets. Of the 21 Northern Pike caught only 4 were over the 24 inch minimum size limit in the southern zone of Minnesota. One Northern Pike was 36 inches showing some potential exists for large Northern Pike in Lake Benton. Northern Pike stocking in Lake Benton is rare due to inconsistent hatchery production with the last stocking occurring in 2006 (17,875 fingerling). The existing population is composed of younger fish that were either naturally spawned within the lake or from connected streams and wetlands upstream. Any improvements in Northern Pike abundance into the future may focus on spawning habitat identification and potential improvement. That all said, angling for Northern Pike specifically may be difficult but potential exists for abundance and size to improve, especially fish over 24 inches.   <br> \n     <br> \nYELLOW PERCH   <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch are probably the second most popular species targeted by anglers while fishing Lake Benton. Yellow Perch abundance in Lake Benton has been up and down recently with 5.4 Yellow Perch per gill net in 2021 followed by 28.4 Yellow Perch per gill net in 2023. The long-term gill net catch average is 47 Yellow Perch per gill net, which has not been exceeded since 2019 (72.6 per gill net). While the 2023 gill net catch rate is less than the long-term average, it is still above the normal range for class 41 lakes (3.0 to 22.5 per gill net) indicating a potentially robust population. In addition, Yellow Perch size structure was good. Fish ranged in length from 6 to 11.5 inches with a mean length of 8 inches in the gill net sample. While the population level of Yellow Perch in Lake Benton can be up and down, size of Yellow Perch is typically above average for southwestern Minnesota populations. With 50% of fish over 8 inches, the Lake Benton Yellow Perch population is poised to provide an excellent angling opportunity.   <br> \n <br> \nOTHER SPECIES <br> \n <br> \nLake Benton is a simple fish community with few species sampled. The only other species sampled in 2023 include Black Bullhead, Common Carp, and White Sucker. Black Bullhead relative abundance is down from recent years to 14.8 per gill net and 18.5 per trap net in 2023. Common Carp relative abundance is also down from really high catch rates in 2019 (58.0 per gill net) and 2021 (69.8 per gill net) to 4.6 per gill net in 2023. Common Carp were infected with Carp Edema Virus (CEV) from August through October 2021 and is the most likely cause of the reduction in the number of Common Carp. White Sucker relative abundance is above long-term averages (8.56 per gill net, 1.85 per trap net) and also above the upper normal range for both gill nets and trap nets with 10.4 per gill net and 3.13 per trap net.  <br> \n</p>",

APPROXIMATELY 46% OF THE FISH SAMPLED WERE IN YEAR CLASSES ORIGINATING FROM NATURAL REPRODUCTION.  AGE 3 WAE, REPRESENTING 36% OF FISH SAMPLED, WERE FROM NATURAL REPRODUCTION.  THE TWO STRONGEST YEAR CLASSES, FROM A 1988 POPULATION ASSESSMENT, WERE FROM NATURAL REPRODUCTION.  GILLNET CATCH INDICES FOR WAE WERE ALMOST TWICE THE UPPER END OF THE NORMAL RANGE FOR LAKE CLASS 40 INDICATING A HIGH POPULATION.  GILLNET CATCH INDICES INCREASED FROM 14.8 FISH PER NET IN 1988 TO 19.2 FISH PER NET IN 1992.  APPROXIMATELY 303 YOY WAE PER ACRE SEINED WERE CAPTURED FROM A 1992 NATURAL REPRODUCTION CHECK (106 FISH IN 5 SEINE HAULS).  SHORELINE SEINING ALSO INDICATED NATURAL REPRODUCTION OF YEP AND BLC.  THE WAE LENGTH FREQUENCY DISTRIBUTION FROM GILL AND TRAPNETS RANGED FROM 9.0 TO 27.0 INCHES AGAIN INDICATING THE PRESENCE OF MULTIPLE YEAR CLASSES.  THE PRESENT MANAGEMENT PLAN CALLS FOR STOCKING WAE FRY 2 OF 3 YEARS.  SINCE SOME OF THE STRONGER YEAR CLASSES OCCURRED IN YEARS FRY WERE NOT STOCKED I WOULD RECOMMEND STOCKING FRY 1 OF 3 YEARS TO BETTER EVALUATE WAE NATURAL REPRODUCTION.  IT MAY BE POSSIBLE TO MAINTAIN THE WAE POPULATION BY REDUCING STOCKING FREQUENCY. GILLNET CATCH INDICES FOR YEP FELL WITHIN THE NORMAL RANGE FOR THAT LAKE CLASS INDICATING A NORMAL POPULATION.  THE POPULATION CONSISTS OF AT LEAST 7 YEAR CLASSES AND LENGTHS RANGED FROM 6.5 TO 14.0 INCHES.  APPROXIMATELY 40% OF THE YEP CAPTURED IN THE SURVEY WERE 12.0 INCHES OR LONGER. TRAPNET CATCH INDICES FOR CARP, WTS, BLG AND BLC FELL WITHIN THE NORMAL RANGE FOR THAT LAKE CLASS INDICATING NORMAL POPULATIONS.  THE LENGTH FREQUENCY DISTRIBUTION FOR BLG RANGED FROM 3.5 TO 10.0 INCHES.  THE BLG POPULATION WAS DOMINATED BY AGE 1 AND AGE 2 FISH (79% OF THE SAMPLE).  THE LENGTH FREQUENCY DISTRIBUTION FOR BLC RANGED FROM 5.0 TO 12.0 INCHES.  THE POPULATION WAS DOMINATED BY AGE 4 FISH (71% OF THE POPULATION SAMPLED). TRAPNET CATCH INDICES FOR BLB WERE OVER 6 TIMES THE UPPER END OF THE NORMAL RANGE FOR THAT LAKE CLASS INDICATING A HIGH POPULATION.  THREE OF THE 11 TRAPNETS CONTAINED 90% OF THE BLB SAMPLED.  THE MEDIAN CATCH FOR BLB FROM TRAPNETS WAS 85.5 FISH PER NET.  THE LENGTH FREQUENCY DISTRIBUTION WAS BIMODAL.  ONE GROUP RANGED FROM 4.0 TO 8.5 INCHES AND THE OTHER GROUP RANGED FROM 11.5 TO 14.0 INCHES.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Benton is a 2,857-acre class 41 lake located in Lincoln County.  Lake Benton is located nine miles east of the Minnesota-South Dakota border.  The city of Lake Benton is located on the southwestern end of the lake at the intersection of US highways 14 and 75.  The watershed of Lake Benton is primarily composed of agricultural development with roughly 90 percent of the watershed planted in primarily in row crops.  Other uses of the Lake Benton watershed include forest/woodlands, grasslands, and municipal.  The watershed-to-lake ratio is 9 to 1 indicating the influence of the land use practices in the lake.   The immediate shoreline surrounding Lake Benton is composed mostly of grasslands (80%), and undeveloped forest or woodland (20%); however, some development is present in the Lake Benton city limits.  More than 120 cabins or homes were present on Lake Benton in 2010.  There were a total of six inlets to Lake Benton and the major outlet is Coon Creek. <br> \n <br> \nLake Benton has a maximum depth of 9 ft, a secchi depth of 1.8 feet and supported vegetation to a depth of 5 ft (based on the 2000 survey).  Native aquatic plant species of submergent and emergent vegetation were rare in Lake Benton in 2000.  Sago pondweed was the most commonly observed native aquatic vegetation with rare occurrences of common hornwort (coontail).  Conversely, the exotic invasive curly leafed pondweed has been a common aquatic plant species in Lake Benton.  The entire Lake Benton water basin had been treated with Fluridone from 2005 through 2008 and partial basin treatments were completed in 2009 in attempts to chemically control curly leafed pondweed.  The Division of Ecological Resources continues to monitor the aquatic vegetation in Lake Benton annually through the treatment years.  The shoal water substrate composition of Lake Benton was mostly gravel, sand, and rubble covered with detritus.  The water level of Lake Benton was high during the summer of 2010 relative to historic observed water levels.   <br> \n <br> \nThe fishery of Lake Benton is primarily managed for walleye and secondarily for northern pike, black crappie, bluegill, and yellow perch.  A population assessment was conducted during the week of August 2, 2010 using gill nets and frame nets. <br> \n <br> \nThe walleye catch rate in Lake Benton was 45.33 fish/gill net, which is the highest observed catch rate since sampling began in 1956.   The current catch rate is more than twice the long-term catch rate of 20.82 fish/net, and 3 times the higher normal range of 15.33 fish/net for this type of lake.  The trap net catch rate (7.73 fish/net) is also the highest observed catch rate since sampling began in 1956; it is 4 times the higher normal range and twice the long-term average of 3.52 fish/net.  Trap nets are usually poor indicators of walleye abundance, but high catch rates in trap nets along with high catch rates in gill nets indicates high population density.  The average size of walleye caught in the gill nets was 11.2 inches with a range of 6.9 to 25.4 inches.  Otolith ages revealed 8 year classes (1995, 1996, and 2004-2009) of walleye in Lake Benton with 47% of the fish from the 2009 (age 1) year class and 26% from the 2007 (age 3) year class.  Four of the 8 year classes were naturally reproduced (1995, 1996, 2005, and 2008), although their abundance was low and comprised only 19% of the total population of walleye.  It appears that natural reproduction is sporadic and inadequate to sustain a population of walleye in Lake Benton with the current demand and fishing pressure.  While the population is dominated by younger walleye, growth of walleye in Lake Benton is good (14.4 inch average by age 3).  Overall, the walleye population in Lake Benton appears to be at a high and in fair condition and growth rates are adequate to produce larger walleye.  Over the next year, as the population matures, walleye larger than 15 inches will become more common.  Walleye fishing during the next several years should be good, if not spectacular, in Lake Benton. <br> \n <br> \nThe northern pike catch rate in Lake Benton during 2010 was 1.3 fish/gill net which was within the interquartile range for lake class 41 (1.2 to 7.8) but almost twice the long-term average of 0.7 fish/gill net since 1956.  Lake Benton has a historically low catch rate (0 to 2.1 fish/gill net) of northern pike and is most likely a result of degraded spawning habitat within the lake.  To augment the population, northern pike fingerling were stocked in 2006 at a rate of 5 per acre.  During the current survey, the length of northern pike ranged from 8.8 to 26.4 inches with a mean of 17.9 inches and all but one fish aged was the result natural reproduction.  A naturally reproducing population of northern pike in Lake Benton could indicate an improvement in habitat for spawning.  One of the naturally reproduced year classes (2009), with an average length of 16.4 inches, currently dominates the population of northern pike in Lake Benton.  Over the next several years, as the population matures and with continued natural reproduction, larger northern pike (> 28 inches) will become more common.  Fishing for northern pike in Lake Benton should be good over the next few years.  Catch and release angling should be considered if larger pike are desired, otherwise northern pike are susceptible to high mortality due to overfishing as they are a voracious predator and strike at just about anything that fits into their mouth. <br> \n <br> \nThe current catch rate of black crappie in Lake Benton was 4.2 fish/trap net which is within the interquartile range for lake class 41 (1.0 to 12.3 fish/trap net).  The long-term catch rate of black crappie in Lake Benton is 3.1 fish/trap net.  During 2010 the black crappie ranged in length from 2.4 to 12.1 inches with a mean length of 8.1 inches.  It appears that the black crappie population is doing well.  Fishing for black crappie should be good and the action may be particularly hot in the spring months. <br> \n <br> \nThe bluegill catch rate during 2010 was 6.1 fish/trap net which was within the interquartile range for lake class 41 (1.1 to 14.9 fish/trap net) and equal to the long-term catch rate of 5.7 fish/trap net.  Bluegill ranged in size from 3.5 to 10.2 inches with a mean of 6.8 inches.  If the bluegill size structure remains similar to the current state and natural reproduction occurs in Lake Benton, then the bluegill population may regularly produce  fish larger than 10 inches and a potential to produce trophy fish (>12 inches).  Fishing for bluegill in Lake Benton is improving and the potential to catch a large bluegill is excellent. <br> \nThe yellow perch catch rate was 12.7 fish/gill net in 2010 which was within the interquartile range for lake class 41 (3.0 to 22.5 fish/net) but only 25% of the long-term catch rate of 52.7 fish/gill net.  The lengths of yellow perch ranged from 6.7 to 14.0 inches with a mean length of 9.6 inches.  The growth of yellow perch in Lake Benton is excellent.  Trophy (> 15 inches) yellow perch may be present in the population during the next year or two.  Fishing for yellow perch in Lake Benton should be good and will supplement good fishing for walleye and bluegill. <br> \n <br> \nThe black bullhead catch rate in gill nets was 0.3 fish/net in 2010 which is less than the 25% quartile for lake class 41 (4.6 fish/net) and less than 1% of the long-term catch rate of 84.9 fish/net in Lake Benton.  Only 17 black bullhead were sampled in 2010 using 6 gill nets and 15 trap nets.  With the abundance of predator species such as walleye, northern pike, black crappie, and yellow perch and the small size structure of the black bullhead population it appears the black bullhead population will remain suppressed.   <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled in 2010 were common carp, orangespotted sunfish, and white sucker.   <br> \n <br> \nLake Benton appears to sustain a diverse fish community and should be a destination for walleye, northern pike, bluegill, and yellow perch anglers in southwestern Minnesota.   <br> \n <br> \nPrepared by Nate Hodgins <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Benton is a 2,857-acre class 41 lake located in Lincoln County nine miles east of the Minnesota-South Dakota border and adjacent to the city of Lake Benton.  The city of Lake Benton is located on the southwestern end of the lake at the intersection of US highways 14 and 75.  The watershed of Lake Benton is primarily composed of agricultural development with roughly 90 percent of the watershed planted in row crops.  Other uses of the Lake Benton watershed include woodlands, grasslands, and municipalities.  The watershed-to-lake ratio is 9 to 1 indicating the influence of the land use practices in the lake.  Any watershed ratio less than 30 to 1 is small and indicates an opportunity exists to improve water quality through natural resource oriented (particularly surface water flow) land management.  In the case of Lake Benton, surrounding land practices that may improve water quality in the lake may include cover crops, buffer strips on waterways, and reduced or targeted fertilizer application.  There are a total of six inlets to Lake Benton and the major outlet is Coon Creek.   <br> \n <br> \nLake Benton has a maximum depth of 9 feet, a secchi depth of 2.3 feet, and supported vegetation to a depth of 8 feet (based on the 2012 point-intercept survey).  Native aquatic plant species of submergent and emergent vegetation were rare in Lake Benton in 2012.  Sago pondweed and common hornwort (coontail) were the only native species observed.  Conversely, the exotic invasive curly leafed pondweed has been a common aquatic plant species in recent history on Lake Benton (2000-2006).  The entire Lake Benton water basin had been treated with Fluridone from 2005 through 2008 and partial basin treatments were completed in 2009 in attempts to chemically control curly leafed pondweed.  The Division of Ecological Resources continues to monitor the aquatic vegetation in Lake Benton annually through the treatment years. In 2012, curly leaf pondweed was found in very small quantities around the lake and was considered rare.  The shoal water substrate composition of Lake Benton was mostly gravel, sand, and rubble covered with detritus.  The water level of Lake Benton was at normal stage during the summer of 2013 relative to historic observed water levels.   <br> \n <br> \nThe fishery of Lake Benton is primarily managed for walleye and secondarily for black crappie, bluegill, northern pike, and yellow perch.  A population assessment was conducted the week of July 29th, 2013 with 4 gill nets and 15 trap nets to assess the managed fish species. <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nWALLEYE <br> \n <br> \nThe walleye catch rate in 2013 was the fourth highest catch rate since fish sampling began with 34.0 fish per gill net.  The average size of walleye caught in the gill nets was 12.9 inches with fishing ranging in length from 7.9 to 21.7 inches.  The current gill net catch rate is more than the long-term catch rate of 22.8 fish per net, and more than 2 times the upper expected catch rate value of 15.3 fish per net for Lake Benton.  The trap net catch rate of 2.2 fish per net was also greater than the upper expected catch rate value of 1.7 fish per trap net for Lake Benton.  However, the 2013 trap net catch rate was less than the long-term average of 2.9 fish per trap net.  Trap nets are usually poor indicators of walleye abundance, but catch rates within or greater than the expected range along with high catch rates in gill nets indicates a high population density.  A population abundance model developed by MN DNR researchers was used to estimate an approximate 2013 population abundance for Lake Benton based on the gill net catch of walleye.  The population abundance model indicated that there may be anywhere between 85,318 and 356,684 (mean estimate = 219,128) walleye in Lake Benton with 24% of the walleye larger than the average size of 12.9 inches.  Additionally, the population abundance model indicated that more than 50% of the walleye were between 8 and 10 inches.  However, the size structure of walleye in the gill net and trap net catches indicated a more balanced size structure with 30% of the walleye being larger than 15 inches and 4% of the walleye being larger than 20 inches.  Otoliths (ear bones) were used to get age information from the walleye in the gill net sample.   Four different age groups of walleye were observed in Lake Benton; 28% were 1 year old, 53% were 2 years old, 17% were 4 years old, and 2% were 6 years old.  Interestingly, the most abundant age group in the 2013 survey sample was the non-stocked 2-year-olds indicating substantial natural reproduction occurred in 2011.  In the past, natural reproduction has been sporadic and inadequate to sustain a population of walleye in Lake Benton without supplemental walleye fry stocking.  Natural reproduction remained sporadic in 2013 (only 1 of 4 age groups was naturally reproduced), but the 2013 survey showed that a very abundant naturally reproduced year class can become a major component of the walleye population and greatly contribute to the fishery.  Past stocking of walleye fry in Lake Benton appears to be creating more opportunity for the walleye population to be able to successfully reproduce by stabilizing the population and adding potential spawning stock (fish old enough to reproduce) to the lake.  While the population is currently dominated by younger walleye, growth of walleye in Lake Benton is good (13.8 inch average by age 3) which should allow the size structure of the population to remain in a balanced state.  In addition, the overall health condition of walleye was good and indicates that the walleye are finding enough food to eat.  Overall, the walleye population in Lake Benton appears to be at a fairly high level and in good health with a growth rate that may produce some larger walleye.  Over the next several years, as the walleye mature, 15 inch walleye will become a more regular occurrence in angler's catches.    <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nBLACK CRAPPIE <br> \n <br> \nThe current catch rate of black crappie in Lake Benton was 1.3 fish per trap net, which is within the expected catch rate range for Lake Benton (1.0 to 12.3 fish per trap net).  The long-term catch rate of black crappie in Lake Benton is 3.0 fish per trap net.  During the 1980s and early 1990s the black crappie catch rate was between 5.4 and 11.9 fish per trap net and the population appeared to be doing well, but from 1996 to 2009 the catch rate never exceeded 2.7 fish per net.  More often than not the trap net catch rate was usually near 1 fish per net, indicating a population that may have been experiencing some stress.  Then the trap net catch rate increased to 4.2 in 2010 and 3.3 in 2011, with several age groups present in each survey.  The observation of a wide range of sizes in 2010 and 2011 was confusing due to low catch rates (less than 0.5 fish per net) from 2006 to 2009.  It was speculated that the lake wide treatment of aquatic vegetation with Fluridone to remove curly-leaf pondweed was also removing native vegetation and placing stress on the black crappie population leading to a potential reduction in the population.  However, it appeared the effect of the vegetation removal may have been limited to behavioral changes that influenced catch success in the DNR sampling gear rather than negative effects to the population abundance and condition.  Currently, the black crappie population is comprised of 3 age groups with fish ranging from 7.6 to 11.6 inches (mean = 9.2 inches).  The size structure is skewed toward bigger fish indicating a population of black crappie that is dominated by fish larger than 8 inches.  The overall health of the black crappie was very good indicating the black crappie were finding enough prey items to eat.  It appears that the black crappie population is doing well in 2013, but continued evaluation of the Lake Benton fish community every other year (2015, 2017, 2019, etc.) will be conducted to understand the full effects of the vegetation treatment with Fluridone on all fish species in Lake Benton.  <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nBLUEGILL <br> \n <br> \nThe bluegill catch rate during 2013 was 0.9 fish per trap net which less than the lower expected catch rate value for Lake Benton (quartile range = 1.1 to 14.9 fish per trap net) and less than the long-term catch rate of 6.2 fish per trap net.  Lake Benton has only had two years (1983 and 1996) with outstanding catch rates (50.4 fish per net and 17.3 fish per net) of bluegill.  Since 2000, the catch rate has ranged from 0.1 to 6.1 fish per trap net and is usually near 1 fish per trap net.  Since 2009, Becker's Resort on the south shore of Lake Benton has stocked adult bluegill with the last stocking in 2012.  It appears the stocking is helping to sustain the bluegill fishery at a very low abundance, but reproduction is still limited.  In 2013, the bluegill ranged in size from 7.6 to 8.6 inches with a mean of 8.1 inches.  It is likely that all bluegill in the sample were from the same year class and potentially from the 2012 stocking of adult bluegill.  The size structure of the bluegill in the sample favored larger fish with most fish being bigger than 8 inches.  The overall condition of the bluegill was excellent indicating successful foraging and growth.  If the future bluegill size structure remains similar to the current size structure and natural reproduction occurs in Lake Benton in the future, then the bluegill population may be able to sustain a population without stocking.  Reproduction is sporadic and was last observed in 2011.  In-lake habitat projects that include restoring patches of vegetation for bluegill spawning or adding artificial spawning structures may help to increase the population.   <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nNORTHERN PIKE <br> \n <br> \nThe northern pike catch rate in Lake Benton during 2013 was 1.5 fish per gill net which was within the expected catch rate range for Lake Benton (1.2 to 7.8 fish per net) and almost twice the long-term average of 0.8 fish per gill net since 1956.  Lake Benton has a historically low catch rate (0 to 2.2 fish per gill net) of northern pike, most likely a result of degraded spawning habitat within the lake.  To augment the population, northern pike fingerling were stocked in 2006 at a rate of 5 per acre.  During the current survey, the length of northern pike ranged from 9.1 to 31.0 inches with a mean of 20.6 inches in the gill net sample and a mean of 23.0 inches in the trap net sample.  The size structure of northern pike in the sample was dominated by fish in the 21 to 28 inch range.  The size structure of the northern pike has increased steadily since 2009.  This may be due to a single age group of northern pike that is aging and growing with little or no naturally reproduced age groups following behind it.  While the current catch rate is within the expected catch rate range, the DNR will continue to stock northern pike fingerling in the lake as they become available during spring northern pike production to sustain the population.  Several poor years of northern pike fingerling production due to drought and unusual warm or cold weather cycles during spring of 2012 and 2013 have made stocking fingerling nearly impossible in the Windom Fisheries Management Area.  Additionally, in-lake habitat improvements to increase spawning potential of northern pike should be considered.  An example of an improvement in habitat could be as simple as less frequent herbicide use to leave some aquatic vegetation patches, especially in bays.  Over the next several years, as the population matures and with some natural reproduction or stocking, larger northern pike may become more common.  <br> \n  <br> \n <br> \nYELLOW PERCH <br> \n <br> \nThe 2013 yellow perch catch rate was 6.8 fish per gill net, within the expected catch rate range for Lake Benton (3.0 to 22.5 fish per net) but less than the long-term catch rate of 48.8 fish per gill net.  Historically, the yellow perch catch has been within or above the expected catch rate range during every survey except 2005.  The yellow perch population abundance has been sporadic since sampling began on Lake Benton.  In the same way, the size structure of the yellow perch population has been sporadic with the starkest changes occurring since 2003.  The sporadic nature of the yellow perch population is most likely the result of a boom and bust style of reproduction where there are very successful spawning years followed by several years of little to no spawning success.  In 2013, the lengths of yellow perch in the sample ranged from 7.1 to 11.3 inches with a mean length of 9.4 inches in the gill nets and 9.3 inches in the trap nets.  Most yellow perch in the sample were greater than 8 inches.  The overall health of the population was excellent, indicating the fish are finding enough prey to eat.  The yellow perch population appears to be entering a phase where large fish dominate the system because reproduction has been lacking since 2011, or predation has cropped off the younger and smaller fish in recent years.  Success of walleye and northern pike populations are directly tied to abundance of yellow perch in many lakes and Lake Benton is no different.  If successful reproduction of yellow perch is not realized seen by the 2015 or 2017 lake survey, walleye and northern pike population abundances could be negatively impacted.  One thing that will dull the effect of a reduction in yellow perch is the presence of many black bullhead in 2013 that will provide forage for walleye and northern pike. <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nBLACK BULLHEAD <br> \n <br> \nThe black bullhead catch rate in gill nets was 125.0 fish per net in 2013 which was greater than the upper expected catch rate value of 83.0 fish per gill net for Lake Benton (interquartile range = 4.6 to 83.0 fish per gill net) and 1.5 times the long-term catch rate of 82.9 fish per gill net.  The 2013 catch rate is up from 17.0 bullhead per gill net in 2011 and 0.33 per gill net in 2010 and the highest catch rate since 356.2 fish per gill net in 2006.  From 2007 to 2011 the black bullhead abundance was dramatically below levels observed from 2000 to 2006 (83.2 to 356.2 fish per gill net).  It was speculated that poor reproduction and increased mortality through predation as well as angling were most likely responsible for the decline from 2007-2011.  Bullhead observed in the 2013 sample ranged in length from 4.8 to 14.1 inches with a mean length of 8.1 inches in the gill nets and 8.3 inches in the trap nets.  Extremely successful reproduction in 2011 and 2012 most likely led to the increase in the bullhead abundance observed in 2013.  With the decrease in abundance of yellow perch and the increase in abundance of black bullhead, it is possible the black bullhead population will become a major component of the walleye forage base in 2013 and possibly into 2014.   <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nOTHER SPECIES <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled in 2013 were common carp, green sunfish, and white sucker.  The common carp catch rate in gill nets (0.5 fish per net) was nearly equal to the lower expected catch rate value for Lake Benton (0.52 to 9.13 fish per net) and one of the lowest catch rates of common carp observed since 2006.  The green sunfish gill net (0.25 fish per net) and trap net (0.13 fish per net) catch rates were within the expected catch rate ranges for each net type (gillnet = 0.17 to 2.75 fish per net; trap net = 0.13 to 0.66 fish per net).  The white sucker catch rate of 6.0 fish per gill net exceeded the expected catch rate range for Lake Benton (0.8 to 5.9 fish per gill net) for the 3 straight survey in a row (2010, 2011, and 2013); white sucker continue to be the most abundant large forage fish for the larger predators (large walleye and northern pike) in Lake Benton.   <br> \n <br> \nWhile Lake Benton supports a limited diversity of fish, it should be a destination for walleye anglers in southwestern Minnesota.  When the bite is on, anglers could have the opportunity to catch their limit of walleye in the 13 to 15 inch range with some fish larger than 20 inches as a bonus.  To have a chance to catch the big one you need to wet a line, get out there and give it a try!  <br> \n <br> \nPrepared by Nate Hodgins <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Benton which covers 2857 acres is one of the larger lakes in the Windom Area.  The lake has a shoreline length of 18.1 miles and a maximum depth of 9 feet.  The surrounding watershed is dominated by agricultural lands and the immediate shoreline is fringed with hardwoods.  More than one hundred homes and cottages which are predominantly located along the south shore border Lake Benton.  Gravel, sand, and rubble substrates dominate shoalwater areas.  According to a survey conducted in 1992, submergent and emergent vegetation are considered abundant.  Lake Benton is managed primarily for walleye and secondarily for northern pike and black crappie. A dense and expanding stand of curled leaf pond weed covers nearly half the lake surface area from spring to midsummer.  The stand which is located on the west side of the lake makes boating and fishing difficult in this area.  Although the abundance of curled leaf pond weed may be detrimental to recreational boating activities in Lake Benton, fish species may ultimately benefit.  Aquatic vegetation provide fish additional spawning habitat, cover, and related food resources.  In addition, aquatic vegetation improves water quality by using nutrients which may otherwise be used by undesirable blue-green algae.  The vegetation also reduces the amount of suspended solids in a lake by reducing the effect of wave action which stirs up bottom sediments.     Walleye numbers are considered high compared to similar lakes in our area.  Walleye collected in gillnets ranged in length from 9 to almost 28 inches with an average length of approximately 17 ? inches.  The population is comprised mainly of large fish with many reaching preferred lengths (greater than 20 inches).  The walleye population is supported through a combination of stocking and natural reproduction.  Walleye fry were stocked in 1988, 1990, 1991, 1993, and 1994.Northern Pike numbers are considered normal.  Pike sampled in gillnets ranged in length from 15 to nearly 31 inches with an average length of approximately 24 ? inches.  The northern pike population is healthy and self-supporting. Black crappie numbers are considered low compared to similar lakes in our area.  Black crappie sampled in trapnets ranged in length from 5 to almost 9 inches with an average length of approximately 7 inches.  Although the current numbers are low, black crappie populations characteristically cycle in abundance, and thus black crappie numbers in Lake Benton should rebound to normal levels in subsequent years.  The black crappie population is healthy and supported through natural reproduction.Yellow perch numbers increased since the 1992 survey and are currently considered high compared to other lakes in our area.  Yellow perch collected in gillnets ranged in length from 5 to more than 11 ? inches with an average length of approximately 7 inches.  Although the population is comprised mainly of small fish, with adequate growth, good numbers of fish should reach quality lengths (greater than 8 inches) in subsequent years.  The yellow perch population is also self-supporting.  Bluegill numbers have also increased since the 1992 survey and are currently considered high.  Bluegill sampled in trapnets ranged in length from 3 to almost 10 inches with an average length of approximately 4 inches.  Similar to the yellow perch population, the current bluegill population is dominated by small fish but should also provide good numbers of quality size fish in subsequent years.  The bluegill population is healthy and self-supporting.Black bullhead numbers are considered normal.  Bullhead sampled in trapnets ranged in length from 4 to more than 14 inches with an average length of approximately 8 inches.Other species observed during the 1996 survey include largemouth bass, green sunfish, carp, white sucker, and johnny darter.A creel survey was also conducted on Lake Benton during the 1996 walleye fishing season.  Total estimated angling pressure from May 11, 1996 through February 16, 1997 (excluding November) was 38,275 angler hours (15,940 angler trips), or 13.4 angler hours per acre.  Ninety-one percent of the pressure occurred during the summer and 9.0% during the winter.  Anglers from 14 states fished the lake with Minnesota residents accounting for 79% of the angler trips.  Ten species of fish were caught, of which yellow perch, black bullhead, walleye, and largemouth bass were caught most frequently.  Total estimated harvest of all species was 18,816 fish, or 6.59 fish per acre.  Total yield was 7,394 pounds, or 2.59 pounds per acre.  A total of 3,689 walleye were caught, of which 25% were harvested.  The majority of harvested walleye were from the 1993 and 1994 year classes.  To promote and maintain a healthy fish population, pollution and other inputs need to be controlled.  Fish habitat is directly affected by water quality.  Nutrient, sediment and other waste inputs can drastically alter the chemical and physical components of a Lake.  It is paramount to maintain if not improve the current water quality of Lake Benton through watershed management to preserve this fishery for future generations to enjoy.   </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Benton is a 2,857-acre class 41 lake located in western Lincoln County.  Lake Benton is located nine miles east of the Minnesota-South Dakota border.  The city of Lake Benton is located on the southwestern end of the lake at the intersection of US highways 14 and 75.  <br> \n <br> \nThe watershed of Lake Benton is primarily composed of agricultural development with roughly 90 percent of the watershed planted in primarily in row crops.  Other uses of the Lake Benton watershed include forest/woodlands, grasslands, and municipal.  The immediate shoreline surrounding Lake Benton is composed mostly of undeveloped forest or woodland (80%), and grassland (20%); however, some development is present in the Lake Benton city limits.  Residentially, 128 cabins or homes were present on Lake Benton in 2006.  Recreational use is apparently important on Lake Benton and during this survey a total of 127 boats were observed on or around the perimeter of the lake basin.  There were a total of six inlets to Lake Benton, but only a single inlet with a recordable flow (Norwegian Creek) at the time of this survey.  Outflows from Lake Benton include Coon Creek, which was flowing at the time of this survey. <br> \n <br> \nLake Benton has a maximum depth of 9 ft, a secchi depth of 2 feet and supported vegetation to a depth of 5 ft (based on the 2000 survey).  Native aquatic plant species of submergent and emergent vegetation were rare in Lake Benton in 2000.  Sago pondweed was the most commonly observed native aquatic vegetation.  Conversely, the exotic invasive curly leafed pondweed has been a common aquatic plant species in Lake Benton.  Subsequently, the entire Lake Benton water basin had been treated with Fluridone from 2005 through 2008 and partial basin treatments were completed in 2009 in attempts to chemically control curly leafed pondweed.  The Division of Ecological Resources continues to monitor the aquatic vegetation in Lake Benton annually through the treatment years.  The shoal water substrate composition of Lake Benton was mostly gravel, sand, and rubble covered with detritus.  The water level of Lake Benton was normal during the summer of 2006 relative to historic observed water levels.   <br> \nThe fishery of Lake Benton is primarily managed for walleye and secondarily for black crappie, bluegill, northern pike and yellow perch.  A population assessment was conducted during the week of July 30, 2009 using gill nets and frame nets. <br> \n <br> \nDuring 2009, total lengths of walleye captured in gill nets ranged from 10 to 22 inches with an average length of just over 14 inches.  The walleye size structure was slightly smaller than a typical balanced population, but still respectable.  Recent large years classes in 2008 and 2007 make up the majority of the population and is the reason the sizes are shifted a bit to the smaller side.  The condition of walleye in Lake Benton was within the objective range indicating appropriate food availability.  From 2000 to 2007 the growth of walleye had was below desired.  For example, walleye that were 16.1 inches in length at age-3 in 2000 were only 11.6 inches in length at age-3 in 2007, indicating a decline in growth rate.  However, currently walleye obtain 15 inches by about the third year of growth, which is considered very good.   Ultimately, the growth of walleye in Lake Benton seems to have increased since 2007.   <br> \n <br> \nStocking of walleye in Lake Benton has been through fry stocking on an every-other-year basis.  Stocked walleye have contributed to the walleye population based on ages of walleye captured during the 2009 survey, except the 2002 stocking, which was not observed.  Natural reproduction may be present in Lake Benton as evidenced by the age of walleye present from non-stocked years.  A modest year-class of walleye was apparently naturally reproduced in 2008, which was not a stocked year.  Overall, the current relative abundance, size structure, and growth of walleye in Lake Benton indicate that the population is healthy, well balanced but slightly smaller than expected, and achieving appropriate growth.   <br> \n <br> \nLake Benton supports a population of northern pike that is usually low in numbers.  Catch rates of northern pike in gill nets have ranged from 0 to 2 fish/net with an average of just under one fish/net since 1951.  The 2009 survey indicated that northern pike were slightly above the historic average for numbers of fish, but below the objective range (1.2 \u0013 7.8 fish/net) for lake class 41.  Northern pike captured in gill nets ranged in length from about 17 to 22 inches with an average of just over 19 inches, so the pike in Lake Benton are a bit on the small end.  Northern pike were last stocked into Lake Benton in 2006 when 17,875 fingerlings raised at Shetek rearing ponds were stocked into Lake Benton.  So, the majority of the pike in the lake are about 4 years old.  The condition of northern pike in Lake Benton was good and sufficient food is available to the pike.  Overall, the size structure was slightly lower than desired, but the condition of northern pike in Lake Benton at the time of this survey was acceptable.   <br> \n <br> \nHistorically, yellow perch abundances have been maintained well above similar lakes.  For example, yellow perch gill net catches ranged from about 7 to 340 fish/net from 1951 through 2000.  Beginning in 2003 the number of perch in the gill nets began to decline and has since been below 7 fish/net.  In fact, the yellow perch catches of 2 to 5 fish fish/net observed from 2005 through 2009 are the lowest abundances ever recorded in Lake Benton and have occurred on consecutive years.  During 2009, yellow perch captured in gill nets ranged in length from almost 10 inches up to over 12 inches.  The average length of perch during 2009 was about 10.5 inches.  The length distribution of yellow perch in Lake Benton during 2009 indicated that the population is comprised of mostly larger fish, indicating an unbalanced population.  This indicates that natural reproduction and recruitment of young to the adult population has been limited in recent years.  Yellow perch populations naturally fluctuate over time usually peaking when predator abundance (such as walleye or pike) is lowest; however, the yellow perch population is currently in the extreme low end or below the objective range for abundance and the population is comprised of mostly larger fish.  One important note is that yellow perch rely on submerged vegetation for spawning habitat and the removal of vegetation through the recent treatments of curlyleaf pondweed has most likely negatively impacted perch reproduction.  In fact, the mean length of yellow perch has essentially increased each year since 2003, which indicates that the population has shifted to fewer numbers and larger individuals.  Although the size and condition of the yellow perch in Lake Benton is good for anglers, the low numbers of fish probably doesn\u0019t provide a fast bite. <br> \n <br> \nGenerally, the black crappie and bluegill numbers in Lake Benton have been maintained within expected ranges.  However, the numbers based on trap nets for both black crappie and bluegill was 0.3 fish/net in 2009, which fell below objective ranges of 1 \u0013 12 and 1 \u0013 15, respectively.  Few black crappie or bluegills were captured making estimation of mean length and population size distribution difficult.  However, based on the few fish that were caught, the black crappie are about 5 inches in length and the bluegill are near 4 inches in length.  Overall, the black crappie and bluegill populations in Lake Benton are comprised of fish that are in good overall condition, but are extremely low in abundance and relatively small.  The loss of aquatic vegetation through treatments of curly leaf pondweed has most likely negatively affected the panfish in the lake since they rely on that vegetation for reproduction, food, and cover. <br> \n <br> \nBlack bullhead numbers in Lake Benton have ranged from about 3 to 440 fish/net in the 50 years from 1956 through 2006.  However, beginning in 2003 the abundance of black bullhead increased to well above the historic mean due to the establishment of a very large 2002 year class (fish hatched in 2002).  Subsequently, there has been limited recruitment of black bullhead since 2002 and as that year class has been eroded through natural mortality and hooking mortality the overall population numbers have declined each year.  In fact, during 2009 the black bullhead numbers were less than one fishnet and the lowest numbers of black bullhead observed in Lake Benton since 1951.   Ultimately, the cause for the decrease in abundance of black bullhead since 2003 is not well understood but the lake seems likely to demonstrate another very large year-class of bullhead in the next couple years given the history of occasional large year classes in Lake Benton. <br> \n <br> \nThe catch of common carp in trap nets has remained steady in Lake Benton with the numbers in the lower range for similar lakes.  During 2009, the frame net catch was less than one fish/net and below the historic average (3 fish/net).  Maintaining low common carp abundance is important to aid in re-establishing native aquatic vegetation in the lake following the treatments to control curly leafed pondweed.  The suppression of common carp in Lake Benton has been successful due-in-part to the high walleye numbers that has been historically maintained. <br> \n <br> \nOther species:  Other species captured during the 2009 population assessment included white sucker. <br> \n <br> \n-Prepared by Craig Soupir, NR Fisheries Specialist <br> \n</p>",

THE LENGTH FREQUENCY DISTRIBUTION OF WALLEYES SAMPLED IN THE GILL NET IS RELATIVELY WIDE WITH A RANGE OF 8.0 TO 26.9 INCHES WITH A MODE AT 12 INCHES AND ANOTHER AT 17 INCHES. THE AVERAGE WEIGHT OF THE WALLEYES CAPTURED IN THE GILLNET WAS 1.8 LBS. THE AGE CLASSES ARE BROADLY DISTRIBUTED FROM AGE 1 TO AGE 9 AND WITH REPRESENTATION OF ALL AGES IN BE- TWEEN. WALLEYE FRY WERE STOCKED IN 1983, 1985 AND 1988. THE 1986 AND 1987 YEAR CLASSES PROBABLY ORIGINATED FROM NATURAL REPRODUCTION. SHORELINE SEINING ON AUGUST 17, 1988 PRODUCED 15.7 YOY WALLEYE PER ACRE SEINED. YELLOW PERCH WERE CAPTURED BY GILL NETS IN NUMBERS SIMILAR TO THE LOCAL MEDIAN. THE LENGTH FREQUENCY OF THE YELLOW PERCH SAMPLED IS RELATIVELY WIDE WITH A RANGE FROM 5.5 TO 13.9 INCHES AND A MODE OF 7.0 INCHES. THE AVERAGE WEIGHT WAS 0.33 LBS. ONLY TWO YELLOW PERCH WERE CAPTURED IN 1.15 ACRES OF SHORELINE SEINED. THE BLACK BULLHEAD POPULATION APPEARS TO BE VERY SMALL AND IS DOMINATED BY A FEW LARGE FISH. THE TRAPNET CATCH OF 4.1 FISH PER LIFT IS WELL BELOW THE LOCAL MEDIAN OF 75.1 FISH PER LIFT. THE AVER- AGE WEIGHT OF THE BULLHEADS IN THE TRAP NETS WAS 1.5 LBS. SHORELINE SEINING IN 1988 PRODUCED 568 YOY BLACK BULLHEADS PER ACRE SEINED. THE GILLNET CATCH INDEX FOR NORTHERN PIKE WAS 1.2 FISH PER LIFT WHICH IS SIMILAR TO THE LOCAL MEDIAN OF 1.5 FISH PER LIFT. ALL OF THE FISH SAMPLED WERE AGE 1 OR AGE 2 FISH AND AVERAGED 1.8 LBS. THE TRAPNET INDEX FOR BLUEGILL IS 11% BELOW THE LOCAL MEDIAN. THE TRAPNET CATCH INDEX FOR BLACK CRAPPIE IS SLIGHTLY BELOW THE LOCAL MEDIAN. THE MAJORITY OF FISH OF BOTH SPECIES WERE AGE 1 AND 2. SHORELINE SEINING PRODUCED 91.3 YOY BLUEGILLS PER ACRE SEINED AND 31.3 YOY BLACK CRAPPIE PER ACRE SEINED. THE TRAPNET CATCH INDEX FOR CARP IS 58% BELOW THE LOCAL MEDIAN, WITH MOST FISH MEASURING 16 WEIGHING APPROXIMATELY 2.5 LBS. LARGEMOUTH BASS WERE NOT FOUND DURING TEST NETTING OR DURING SHORELINE SEINING. THEY HAVE BEEN STOCKED THREE TIMES IN RECENT YEARS, 1982 - 5,134 FGLS,; 1984 - 11,120 FGLS. AND 1986 - 14,904 FGLS. DURING THE LAST FEW YEARS, ONLY A FEW FISH HAVE BEEN CAUGHT. THE OWNER OF THE LAKE BENTON BAIT SHOP REPORTS THAT HE KNOWS OF TWO BASS THAT WERE CAUGHT DURING 1988.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Benton is a 2,857-acre, class 41 lake that is adjacent to the City of Lake Benton in Lincoln County.  Lake Benton is managed primarily for Walleye and secondarily for Yellow Perch, Northern Pike, Black Crappie, and Bluegill.  Since 2006, natural reproduction of Walleye has been documented in each non-stocked year (2008, 2011, and 2014).  Due to the documentation of natural reproduction, Lake Benton was stocked with Lower Mississippi Strain (LMS) of Walleye in 2018.  The LMS strain is the same strain that is found in Lake Sarah, which has one of the only Walleye populations in the Windom fisheries management area that is sustained through natural reproduction.  A recent genetics study found that Lake Sarah's Walleye are unique to the Cannon River in east-central Minnesota, which was used as an egg source decades ago.  Further genetic testing has shown that this strain of Walleye has persisted in Lake Benton despite extensive stocking of other strains of Walleye.  A Walleye fry stocking evaluation using night electrofishing was conducted on October 23, 2018 to determine if the 2018 fry stocking was successful.  <br> \n <br> \nYoung-of-the-year (YOY) Walleye were captured at a rate of 68.0 per hour, which indicates that the fry stocking was successful. Genetic analysis revealed 95% of the YOY Walleye were from stocking. Walleye fingerlings ranged in length from 8.8 to 11.4 inches and averaged 10.6 inches.  This year class should recruit to the fishery because of the large size of the fingerlings. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Benton is a 2,857-acre lake located in western Lincoln County.  The lake is located nine miles east of the Minnesota-South Dakota border and is partially in the city of Lake Benton.  Lake Benton has a maximum depth of 9.0 feet, has 18 miles of shoreline and is a class 41 lake.  Benton is managed primarily for walleye while yellow perch, black crappie, and northern pike are managed secondarily.\n\nNative aquatic plant species of submergent and emergent vegetation were rare in 2000 with sago pondweed the most commonly observed native aquatic plant.  Conversely, the exotic invasive curly leaf pondweed has become extremely abundant in Lake Benton.  As a result, the entire Lake Benton basin was treated with Fluridone in 2005, 2006, and 2007.  Additional treatments are scheduled through 2009 to attempt to chemically control the exotic species.  Native vegetation was harvested from Shaokotan in 2007 and planted in Lake Benton.  Enclosures were put around the plant to protect them from being rooted up in an attempt to restore native vegetation.  Annual assessments are planned on Lake Benton to determine what impacts, if any, the chemical treatments may have on fish and vegetation populations.\n\nLake Benton has a very good walleye population.  The walleye gill net catch rate was 16.8 per net in 2007 compared to 9.8 per net in 2006, 4.5 per net in 2005, and 13.3 per net in 2003.  The higher catch rates in 2007 are due primarily to a strong year class of age-1 fish which means good fishing opportunities in the future.  Lengths of walleye caught in gill nets ranged from 7.4 to 25.2 inches and averaged 11.8 inches.  Eleven age classes were observed during the assessment from age-1 fish to age-14 fish.  There appeared to be good natural reproduction in 1995, 1996, and 1999.  Some natural reproduction also occurred in 2001 and 2003.  \n\nThe number of yellow perch in Lake Benton is similar to lakes with physical characteristics like Lake Benton.  The yellow perch catch rate was 5.0 per net in 2007 compared to 2.7 per net in 2006, 1.8 per net in 2005, and 6.7 per net in 2003.  Lengths of yellow perch caught in gill nets ranged from 6.2 to 11.4 inches and averaged 8.6 inches.  \n\nBlack crappie numbers are low in Lake Benton.  The black crappie catch rate was 0.6 per net in 2007 compared to 0.5 per net in 2006 and 1.9 per net in 2005.  Lengths of black crappie caught in trap nets ranged from 4.8 to 9.3 inches and averaged 6.1 inches.  \n\nNo northern pike were sampled during the 2007 assessment.  Benton has a history of producing some large northern pike so 18,000 northern pike fingerlings were stocked in 2006 in an attempt to increase the northern pike population.\n\nBlack bullhead numbers appear to be down to a more manageable level in Lake Benton. The black bullhead trap net catch rate was 14.7 per net in 2007 compared to 176.9 in 2006 and 297.0 in 2005.  Lengths of black bullhead caught in trap nets ranged from 8.5 to 11.7 inches and averaged10.3 inches.  \n\nOther species sampled during the assessment included bluegill, green sunfish, largemouth bass, common carp, and white sucker.\n\nTo maintain a healthy fishery in Lake Benton, we need to promote Best Management Practices (BMP\u0019s) within the watershed to help reduce nutrients entering the lake.  High nutrients and sediments in a lake can cause algae blooms and reduce water clarity.\n\n\n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Benton is a 2,857-acre class 41 lake located in Lincoln County.  Lake Benton is located nine miles east of the Minnesota-South Dakota border.  The city of Lake Benton is located on the southwestern end of the lake at the intersection of US highways 14 and 75.  The watershed of Lake Benton is primarily composed of agricultural development with roughly 90 percent of the watershed planted primarily in row crops.  Other uses of the Lake Benton watershed include forest per woodlands, grasslands, and municipal.  The watershed-to-lake ratio is 9 to 1 indicating the influence of the land use practices in the lake.   The immediate shoreline surrounding Lake Benton is composed mostly of grasslands (80%), and undeveloped forest or woodland (20%); however, some development is present in the Lake Benton city limits.  More than 120 cabins or homes were present on Lake Benton in 2011.  There were a total of six inlets to Lake Benton and the major outlet is Coon Creek.   <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nLake Benton has a maximum depth of 9 ft, a secchi depth of 1.8 feet and supported vegetation to a depth of 5 ft (based on the 2000 survey).  Native aquatic plant species of submergent and emergent vegetation were rare in Lake Benton in 2000.  Sago pondweed was the most commonly observed native aquatic vegetation with rare occurrences of common hornwort (coontail).  Conversely, the exotic invasive curly leafed pondweed has been a common aquatic plant species in Lake Benton.  The entire Lake Benton water basin had been treated with Fluridone from 2005 through 2008 and partial basin treatments were completed in 2009 in attempts to chemically control curly leafed pondweed.  The Division of Ecological Resources continues to monitor the aquatic vegetation in Lake Benton annually through the treatment years.  The shoal water substrate composition of Lake Benton was mostly gravel, sand, and rubble covered with detritus.  The water level of Lake Benton was at normal stage during the summer of 2011 relative to historic observed water levels.   <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nThe fishery of Lake Benton is primarily managed for walleye and secondarily for northern pike, black crappie, bluegill, and yellow perch.  A population assessment was conducted the week of August 1st, 2011 with 4 gill nets, 15 trap nets, along with nearshore index of biotic integrity (IBI) sampling (seining and backpack electrofishing for whole community assessment). <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nThe walleye catch rate in Lake Benton was 45.3 fish per gill net, which is the second greatest catch rate since fish sampling began in 1956.   The current catch rate is almost twice the long-term catch rate of 23.9 fish per net, and 3 times the 75% quartile of 15.33 fish per net for lake class 41.  The average size of walleye caught in the gill nets was 14.9 inches with a range of 10.9 to 22.1 inches.  Otolith (ear bone) ages revealed 6 year classes (2002, 2004, and 2006-2009) of walleye in Lake Benton with 47% of the fish from the 2009 (age 2) year class, 21% from the 2008 (age 3) year class, and 19% from the 2007 (age 4) year class.  Age and growth data indicated 1 (2008) of the 8 year classes was naturally reproduced.  It appears that natural reproduction is sporadic and inadequate to sustain a population of walleye in Lake Benton with the current demand and fishing pressure, therefore walleye fry stocking occurs 2 out of every 3 years.  The proportion of young (less than 3 years) walleye in Lake Benton indicates a population of walleye that is dominated by younger and smaller fish.  While the population is dominated by younger walleye, growth of walleye in Lake Benton is good (15.1 inch average by age 3), which allows the size structure of the population to be in a balanced state.  The overall condition of walleye was fair and indicates that the walleye may in fact be at a very high abundance and competing with each other for limited prey items.  Over the next several years, as the population matures, quality size walleye (greater than 15 inches) may become more common.   <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nThe northern pike catch rate in Lake Benton during 2011 was 1.3 fish per gill net which was within the normal range for lake class 41 (1.2 to 7.8) and almost twice the long-term average of 0.8 fish per gill net since 1996.  Lake Benton has a historically low catch rate (0 to 2.2 fish per gill net) of northern pike that is most likely a result of degraded spawning habitat within the lake.  To augment the population, northern pike fingerling were stocked in 2006 at a rate of 5 per acre.  During the current survey, the length of northern pike ranged from 14.0 to 21.8 inches with a mean of 20.9 inches.  The size of fish caught in the sample indicated a population of northern pike that is dominated by 21 to 28 inch fish.  A naturally reproduced year class in 2009, with an average length between 20 and 24 inches currently dominates the population of northern pike in Lake Benton.  Over the next several years, as the population matures and with continued natural reproduction, larger northern pike (greater than 28 inches) may become more common.   <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nThe current catch rate of black crappie in Lake Benton was 3.3 fish per trap net which is within the normal range for lake class 41 (1.0 to 12.3 fish per trap net).  The long-term catch rate of black crappie in Lake Benton is 1.8 fish per trap net.  During the 1980s and early 1990s the black crappie catch rate was between 5.4 and 11.9 fish per trap net and the population appeared to be doing well, but from 1996 to 2009 the catch rate never exceeded 2.7 fish per net.  During 2011 the black crappie ranged in length from 6.1 to 11.3 inches with a mean length of 7.7 inches.  Some reproduction was found with 18 age-0 black crappie caught in nearshore IBI sampling.  The size of fish caught indicated a population of black crappie with a balanced size structure.  The condition of the black crappie was excellent and showed that the fish are foraging successfully.  The presence of a wide range of sizes in 2011 is confusing due to low catch rates (less than 0.5 fish per net) from 2006 to 2009.  It was speculated that the lake wide treatment of aquatic vegetation with Fluridone to remove curly pondweed was also removing native vegetation and placing stress on the black crappie population.  It is possible the affect of the vegetation removal may have been limited to behavioral changes that may have influenced reproduction and catch success rather than affecting the population condition.  It appears that the black crappie population is doing well, but continued evaluation of the Lake Benton fish community should be conducted to understand the full effects of the vegetation treatment on natural reproduction.   <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nThe bluegill catch rate during 2011 was 1.6 fish per trap net which was within the normal range for lake class 41 (1.1 to 14.9 fish per trap net) and equal to the long-term catch rate of 1.5 fish per trap net.  Lake Benton has only had one year (1983) with an outstanding catch rate (50.4 fish per net) of bluegill.  Since 1983, the catch rate has ranged from 0.1 to 5.3 fish per trap net and is usually near 1 fish per trap net.  In 2009, Becker's Resort on Lake Benton obtained a permit to stock bluegill.  In the fall of 2009, around 1000 adult bluegill (at a rate of 20 per pound) were stocked.  In 2010, the catch rate peaked to 6.1 fish per trap net.  In 2011, the bluegill ranged in size from 3.4 to 9.5 inches with a mean of 6.7 inches.  The size of fish in the sample indicated a population of bluegill that is starting to be dominated by larger (> 8 inches) fish.  The condition of the bluegill was spectacular, indicating a population of bluegill that is successfully foraging and growing well.  If the bluegill size structure remains similar to the current state and natural reproduction occurs in Lake Benton, then the bluegill population may regularly produce very large (greater than 10 inches) and plump individuals with the potential to produce trophy fish (greater than 12 inches).  Reproduction was present in 2011 with 26 age-0 bluegill caught in the nearshore IBI sampling.  It should be noted that bluegill reproduction is often found when aquatic vegetation is in adequate supply.   <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nThe yellow perch catch rate was 43.8 fish per gill net in 2011 which exceeded the normal range for lake class 41 (3.0 to 22.5 fish per net) and the long-term catch rate of 30.2 fish per gill net.  The lengths of yellow perch ranged from 5.3 to 14.2 inches with a mean length of 7.7 inches.  The sample of fish in 2011 indicated the population of yellow perch was dominated by small (less than 8 inches) fish.  The condition of the population was excellent indicating the fish are foraging successfully.  Trophy (greater than 15 inches) yellow perch may be present in the lake but were not sampled in the gill net catch during 2011.  The yellow perch population appears stable.  Additionally, nearshore IBI sampling showed adequate natural reproduction with 119 age-0 yellow perch (2.5 to 3.7 inches) caught in 10 seine hauls.   <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nThe black bullhead catch rate in gill nets was 17.0 fish per gill net in 2011 which was within the normal range for lake class 41 (4.6 to 83.0 fish per gill net) but only 15% of the long-term catch rate of 108.6 fish per gill net in Lake Benton.  Only 124 black bullheads were sampled in 2011 using 4 gill nets and 15 trap nets.  Since 2006, black bullhead abundance has dropped dramatically from catch rates in the hundreds per gill net.  Poor reproduction and increased mortality through predation and fishing are possible sources for the decline.  With the abundance of predator species such as walleye, northern pike, black crappie, and yellow perch it appears the black bullhead population may remain lower in abundance.   <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled in 2011 were common carp, orangespotted sunfish, green sunfish and white sucker.  The common carp catch rate in gill nets (2.3 fish per net) is within the normal range for lake class 41 (0.5 to 9.1 fish per net).  Orangespotted sunfish are not effectively sampled with standard survey trap nets due to the sunfish's small size; one individual was caught in a seine haul.  Green sunfish are also ineffectively sampled with standard survey nets, the 2 fish were caught with backpack electrofishing.  The white sucker catch rate (8.0 fish per gill net) was the second highest observed exceeding the normal range for lake class 41 (0.8 to 5.9 fish per gill net); white sucker appear to be the most abundant forage base for the larger predators (large walleye and northern pike) in Lake Benton.   <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nLake Benton appears to sustain a limited diversity of fish and should be a destination for walleye, northern pike, bluegill, and yellow perch anglers in southwestern Minnesota.   <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nPrepared by Nate Hodgins <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Benton is a 2,857-acre lake that is classified as a DNR class 41 lake located in Lincoln County nine miles east of the Minnesota-South Dakota border and adjacent to the city of Lake Benton at County Highway 14 and US Highway 75.  A class 41 lake is shallow and relatively large with good areas of sand and gravel lake bottom.  The surrounding land area that drains to Lake Benton is row-crop dominated with roughly 90 percent of the watershed planted in corn and soybeans.  Part of the 10% that is not in row crops is the immediate shoreline surrounding Lake Benton.  The immediate shoreline land area is composed mostly of grasslands (80%), and undeveloped forest or woodland (20%); however, some urban development is present in the Lake Benton city limits.  The watershed-to-lake ratio is 9 upland acres for every 1 lake acre, which indicates a fairly small contributing watershed in relation to the lake size.  In general, the smaller the ratio the more realistic it is to positively influence the water quality of the lake by improving land-use practices in the upland areas of the watershed.  In the case of Lake Benton, surrounding land practices that may improve water quality in the lake may include no till farming, cover crops planted in September, increased buffer strips on waterways, and reduced or targeted fertilizer application.  More than 120 cabins or homes were present on Lake Benton in 2013 and no additional changes were noted in 2015.  There are a total of six inlets and one major outlet (Coon Creek).   <br> \n <br> \nLake Benton has a maximum depth of 9 feet, average summer water clarity of 2.5 feet, and at times supports vegetation to 8 feet deep.  Recently underwater and above water vegetation in the lake was sparse and was composed of native species with no obvious presence of curly leaf pondweed at the time of the 2015 fish survey.  Curly leaf pondweed in Lake Benton was at one time very prolific and covered nearly 100% of the surface water.  After chemical (Floridone) treatments from 2005 to 2009 the lake has been returned to undetectable levels of curly leaf pondweed growth in 2015.  The lake bottom composition of Lake Benton was mostly gravel, sand, and rubble covered with detritus.  The water level of Lake Benton was at normal stage during the summer of 2015 relative to historic observed water levels.   <br> \n <br> \nThe fishery of Lake Benton is primarily managed for Walleye and secondarily for Black Crappie, Bluegill, Northern Pike, and Yellow Perch.  A population assessment was conducted the week of July 27th, 2015 with 4 gill nets and 15 trap nets to assess the managed fish species. <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nWALLEYE <br> \n <br> \nOne hundred and seven Walleye were sampled during the 2015 population assessment.  Ninety-two were caught in 4 gill nets and 15 were caught in 15 trap nets for catch rates of 23.0 per gill net and 1.0 per trap net.  Fish appeared to be healthy when caught and analysis of length and weight information for each fish verified this.  The gill net catch rate was equivalent to the 59 year historical catch rate average of 22.9 per gill net.  Additionally, the 2015 gill net catch rate exceeded the expected range of 3.2 to 15.3 per gill net and was equal to the upper expected range value for Windom Area class 41 lakes (23.3 per gill net).  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye stocking was changed after the 2005 survey to increase stocking of Walleye fry from every other year to 2 out of every 3 years at a rate of 1,000 fry per acre.  Since that change, the catch rate of Walleye in gill nets has remained near or above 15.0 per gill net.  In fact, the catch rate since 2010 has remained above 20.0 per gill net over 4 surveys (2010, 2011, 2013, and 2015).  The historical catch rate prior to 2010 never exceeded 20 per gill net over two or more surveys in a row.  The Walleye population appears to be stable and at a high level never seen before in Lake Benton.   <br> \n <br> \nThe additional year of stocking coupled with natural reproduction of Walleye is also becoming more regular in Lake Benton.  Natural reproduction of Walleye has been verified in each non-stocked year since 2006.  Non-stocked years occurred in 2008, 2011, and 2014.  Scale samples of the naturally reproduced Walleye contain genetic material and were sent to Dr. Loren Miller (MN DNR researcher and geneticist) at the University of Minnesota.  Genetic analysis indicated that the 2008 and 2011 year classes of fish are more closely related to a recently verified southern MN strain of Walleye (Lower Mississippi River Strain, aka Lake Sarah Strain or Canon River Strain) than they are to DNR stocked Walleye (Diamond Lake Strain from Spicer Area Fisheries).  This indicates that natural reproduction of a potentially \"native\" or historically stocked Walleye strain with some kind of survival advantage may be occurring.  The 2014 naturally produced group of Walleye has not been analyzed yet, but scale samples will be tested during 2016 to determine their genetic ancestry.   <br> \n <br> \nThe change in stocking strategy of Walleye coupled with more favorable conditions for natural reproduction since 2006 have led to increased catch rates of Walleye in Lake Benton in DNR surveys.  However, the average length of the Lake Benton Walleye has decreased since 2010.  Regardless of the decline, healthy Walleye populations can exist with a smaller size structure.  The smaller size of Walleye sampled could be due to sampling inefficiencies during the most recent survey when weather was very windy or it could be a result of successful stocking and natural reproduction in recent years leading to larger amounts of smaller fish.  Another population assessment will be conducted in 2017 and the Walleye population will be reevaluated. In the meantime, Walleye fry stocking was conducted in the spring of 2015 and will continue in the spring of 2016.  A more balanced size structure is anticipated in the near future because 63% of the Walleye sampled in 2015 were between 12 and 15 inches and growth from now until the Summer of 2016 should result in Walleye exceeding 15 inches.      <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nYELLOW PERCH <br> \n <br> \nOne hundred and four Yellow Perch were caught in gill nets and trap nets on Lake Benton during 2015.  The trap net catch rate of 0.3 per net was within the expected catch rate range of 0.3 to 2.6 per trap net.  The gill net catch rate of 25.0 per net exceeded the expected catch rate range of 3.0 to 22.5 per gill net.  The Yellow Perch population in Lake Benton is cyclical in nature and commonly fluctuates between periods of low and periods of high catch rates.  Lake Benton is mostly devoid of ideal spawning habitat for Yellow Perch except for a few downed trees and some lake bottom areas that can favor spawning.  Therefore, when conditions are not exactly right for spawning the result is typically a mediocre or failed reproduction.  The 2015 net catch was composed of larger Yellow Perch and didn't have any individuals smaller than 6 inches indicating a potential year class failure or increased predation on smaller Yellow Perch or sampling inefficiencies during high winds.  But the Yellow Perch that were caught in the sample indicated a population that has a large size structure with fish in the 8 to 10 inch range.  In addition, the health of the Yellow Perch appears to be good.  Overall, the Yellow Perch population is dominated by larger fish that are in good condition.  This should translate to an ability to fish for an abundant Yellow Perch population during 2016 and 2017.    <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nNORTHERN PIKE <br> \n <br> \nSix Northern Pike were captured in trap nets and gill nets in 2015.  The trap net catch rate was 0.1 per net which is less than the Windom Fisheries Management Area expected catch rate range of 0.2 to 1.0 per trap net.  The gill net catch rate in 2015 was 1.0 per gill net, less than the statewide expected catch rate range for class 41 lakes (1.2 to 7.8 per gill net) but within the southwest MN catch rate range for class 41 lakes (0 to 1.3 per gill net).  The low catch rates were not unexpected due to a lack of spawning habitat for Northern Pike to sustain their population through natural reproduction.  Additionally, the last time Northern Pike were stocked was 2006 so the population is aging and decreasing.  However, the size structure and the overall health of the Northern Pike population is good.  The next stocking of Northern Pike fingerling is scheduled for June 2016 so the population should receive a boost provided MN DNR rearing ponds produce adequate numbers of Northern Pike in 2016.  This boost will sustain the low density population of predators that are essential to maintaining a balance in the entire fish community of Lake Benton.        <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nBLACK CRAPPIE <br> \n <br> \nTwelve Black Crappie were caught in gill nets and trap nets combined in 2015.  The gill net catch rate was 0.8 per gill net and 0.6 per trap net.  Both catch rates for gill nets and trap nets were less than the statewide expected catch rate ranges.  All Black Crappie caught were less than 8 inches but the health of each fish was noted as excellent.  The low abundance population appears to have been dominated by small fish in 2015 but growth can be fast for crappie.  No stocking is advised as Crappie populations are up and down naturally and will increase and decrease in catchability and numbers based on slight changes in habitat or environmental variables (temperature, water quality, water clarity, etc.).  The Black Crappie population at the moment appears to be sustaining a small population that should translate to a catchable population by late 2016.  <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nBLUEGILL <br> \n <br> \nEight Bluegill were sampled in gill nets and trap nets combined.  The gill net catch rate was 0.3 per net and the trap net catch rate was 0.5 per trap net.  The trap net catch rate is below the statewide low expected catch rate value of 1.1 per trap net.  The Bluegill in Lake Benton are most likely larger than 6 inches based on the sample in 2015.  Bluegill adults are stocked periodically by the local fish and game club and they appear to be contributing to a low density fish population with most fish between 8 and 10 inches.   <br> \n <br> \n    <br> \nOTHER SPECIES <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled in 2015 include Black Bullhead, Common Carp, and White Sucker.   <br> \n <br> \nThe Black Bullhead catch rates were within the statewide expected catch rate ranges at 24.8 per gill net and 8.7 per trap net.  Historically, they are below the long-term catch rate averages and are at lower than expected abundances, and have been since 2007.  Most Black Bullhead were between 8 and 10 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nCommon Carp catch rates are 0.8 per gill net and 1.4 per trap net, both within their respective expected statewide catch rate ranges.  As for Black Bullhead, the Common Carp catch rates are lower than their long-term averages for Lake Benton.  Sizes of Common Carp were all over the board but most were adults larger than 16 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nThe White Sucker gill net catch rate was the highest on record at 50.0 per gill net.  The trap net catch rate of White Sucker (1.0 per trap net) was within the expected statewide catch rate range.  Most White Sucker were between 11 and 17 inches and should provide a potentially high available forage base for large Walleye and Northern Pike helping the gamefish to have an ability to grow to very large sizes.   <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nSUMMARY <br> \n    <br> \nWhile Lake Benton supports a limited diversity of fish, it is a destination for Walleye anglers in southwestern Minnesota.  When the bite is on, anglers should have the opportunity to catch their limit of Walleye in the 13 to 15 inch range with some fish larger than 16 inches as a bonus.  To have a chance to catch the big one you need to wet a line, get out there and give it a try in 2016!  <br> \n <br> \nPrepared by Nate Hodgins <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Benton is a 2,857-acre natural lake of lake class 41 located in western Lincoln County.  Lake Benton is located nine miles east of the Minnesota-South Dakota border.  The city of Lake Benton is located on the southern end of the lake at the intersection of US highways 14 and 75.  <br> \n <br> \nThe watershed of Lake Benton is primarily composed of agricultural development with roughly 90 percent of the watershed planted in crops or utilized for pasture.  Other uses of the Lake Benton watershed include forest/woodlands, grasslands, and municipal.  The immediate shoreline surrounding Lake Benton is composed mostly of undeveloped forest or woodland (80%), and grassland (20%); however, some development is present in the Lake Benton city limits.  Residentially, 128 cabins or homes were present on Lake Benton in 2006.  Recreational use is apparently important on Lake Benton and during this survey a total of 127 boats were observed on or around the perimeter of the lake basin.  There were a total of six inlets to Lake Benton; however, there was only a single inlet with a recordable flow (Norwegian Creek) at the time of this survey.  Outflows from Lake Benton include Coon Creek, which was flowing at the time of this survey. <br> \n <br> \nLake Benton has a maximum depth of 9 ft, a secchi depth of 2 ft, and supported vegetation to a depth of 5 ft (based on the 2000 survey).  Native aquatic plant species of submergent and emergent vegetation was rare in Lake Benton in 2000.  Sago pondweed was the most commonly observed native aquatic vegetation.  Conversely, the exotic invasive curly leafed pondweed has been a common aquatic plant species in Lake Benton.  Subsequently, the entire Lake Benton water basin had been treated with Fluridone during 2005 and 2006 with additional treatments scheduled annually through 2009 in attempts to chemically control curly leafed pondweed.  DNR Ecological Services continues to monitor the aquatic vegetation in Lake Benton annually through the Fluridone treatment years.  The shoal water substrate composition of Lake Benton was mostly gravel, sand, and rubble covered with detritus.  The water level of Lake Benton was normal during the summer of 2006 relative to historic observed water levels.   <br> \n <br> \nThe fishery of Lake Benton is primarily managed for walleye and secondarily for black crappie, bluegill, northern pike and yellow perch.  A population assessment was conducted during the week of July 17, 2006 using 6 gill nets and 13 trap nets. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye: Lake Benton is managed primarily for walleye.  Historically, Lake Benton has provided an exceptional walleye fishery with gill net catches ranging from 13 to 37 fish/net between 1983 and 2003.  The abundance of walleye during the 80\u0019s and 90\u0019s generally was within the current management plan of maintaining a relative abundance above 16 fish/net.  However, beginning in 2003, and following a record observed abundance (37 fish/net) of walleye in 2000, the walleye abundance had declined to at or below 10 fish/net.  Currently, the abundance of walleye in Lake Benton based on gill netting is below the objective range (? 16 fish/net), but within the range for similar lakes.   <br> \n <br> \nDuring 2006, walleye captured in gill nets ranged in total length from 11.1 to 26.3 inches with a mean length of 18.7 inches.  Roughly 70 percent of the walleye >10 inches are also >15 inches, which has been maintained for the past 10 years.  The proportion of 15 inch or longer walleye in Lake Benton is above the objective range of 30 \u0013 50 and indicates that the size structure of walleye in Lake Benton is comprised of a slightly higher proportion of larger fish (? 15 inches) than a population that is considered balanced.  Similarly, the proportion of walleye in Lake Benton that are >20 inches total length is also higher than a population considered balanced.    <br> \n <br> \nThe condition of walleye in Lake Benton is within the objective range and most walleye in the lake are considered plump and in good shape.  There was no apparent relationship between walleye condition and length indicating appropriate food availability for the entire walleye population.  However, growth of walleye has apparently slowed over the past 10 years based on length at age.  Currently walleye obtain quality (? 15 inches) length at about the fourth year of growth.  Comparatively, walleye were obtaining quality length between the second and third year of growth as recently as the 2000 survey.   <br> \n <br> \nStocking of walleye in Lake Benton has been through fry stocking on an every-other-year basis.  Stocked walleye have contributed to the walleye population during each year except the 2004 stocking, which was not observed during the 2005 survey.  Natural reproduction may be present in Lake Benton as evidenced by walleye of ages that were not from stocked years.   <br> \n <br> \nOverall, the current abundance and sizes of walleye in Lake Benton indicates that the population is comprised of larger fish and suggests low recruitment of new fish into the population.  The potential correlation between walleye growth and lake wide Fluridone treatments should continue to be monitored. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike: Lake Benton supports a low abundance population of northern pike.  Catch rates of northern pike in gill nets have ranged from 0.0 to 2.2 fish/net with an average of 0.7 since 1951.  The 2006 survey indicated that northern pike are above the historic average for relative abundance but below the range for similar lakes (1.2 \u0013 7.8 fish/net).  Northern pike captured in gill nets ranged in length from 21.0 to 23.1 inches with an average of 22.0 inches.  Overall, the size structure and condition of northern pike in Lake Benton at the time of this survey were acceptable and within desired ranges. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch: Historically, yellow perch have been maintained at abundance within the gill net range (3.0 \u0013 22.5) for lakes similar to Lake Benton.  Yellow perch gill net catches have ranged from 1.8 to 336.8 fish/net from 1951 to 2006.  However, in 2006 the abundance of yellow perch was only 2.7 fish/gill net and the second lowest abundance ever recorded in Lake Benton.  Yellow perch captured in gill nets ranged in length from 9.0 to 11.0 inches with an average length of 9.9 inches.  Yellow perch condition was within the objective range.  Yellow perch populations naturally fluctuate over time usually peaking when predator abundance (e.g., walleye, northern pike, etc.)  is lowest; however, the yellow perch population is currently below objective ranges.  Yellow perch rely on submerged vegetation for spawning habitat and the removal of vegetation through Fluridone treatments may negatively impact perch reproduction. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie and Bluegill:  Generally, the black crappie and bluegill abundance in Lake Benton have been maintained within the ranges for similar lakes.  However, the abundance based on frame nets of both black crappie (0.5 fish/net) and bluegill (0.2 fish/net) in 2006 were below objective ranges.  Black crappie captured in frame nets ranged in length from 4.3 to 10.2 inches with an average length of 8.5 inches.  Few bluegills were captured making estimation of mean length difficult.  The size structures of each black crappie and bluegill were above that expected of a balanced population.  Condition of black crappie and bluegill at the time of this survey was within the objective range.  Overall, the black crappie and bluegill populations in Lake Benton are comprised of low abundance and larger individuals that are in good overall condition. <br> \n <br> \nBlack bullhead: Black bullhead abundance in Lake Benton has ranged from 2.6 to 285.3 fish/net from 1956 through 2006.  Generally, black bullheads have historically been maintained within the normal range (1.3 \u0013 78.1 fish/net) for lakes similar to Lake Benton with the exception of 1992 during an extraordinarily high frame net catch.  However, beginning in 2003 the abundance of black bullhead increased from the historic mean due to the establishment of a very large 2002-year class.  During 2006, the black bullhead population was generally only comprised of a single year class with a total length ranging from 7 to 9 inches.  The frame net catch of black bullheads has declined during each survey since 2003 and indicates that the abundance of bullheads is declining. <br> \n <br> \nCommon carp: The catch of common carp in frame nets has remained steady historically in Lake Benton with the abundance in the lower range compared to similar lakes.  During 2006, the frame net catch was 0.7 fish/net and below the historic average of 2.9 fish/net.  Maintaining low common carp abundance is important to aid in re-establishing native aquatic vegetation in the lake following the Fluridone treatments to control curly leafed pondweed. <br> \n <br> \nOther species:  Other species captured during the 2006 population assessment included green sunfish, largemouth bass, and white sucker. <br> \n <br> \n  <br> \nSummary <br> \n <br> \nIn general, the abundance of most fish species in Lake Benton is lower than the historical average based on our netting information.  Specifically, walleye are the primary species managed in Lake Benton and the current walleye abundance (10 fish/net) is below our objective range of 16 fish/net.  Even though the walleye abundance in Lake Benton is below our objective range, it is still within the range expected for lakes similar to Lake Benton.  The DNR attempts to maintain a high abundance of walleye in Lake Benton to aid in controlling black bullhead and other 'rough fish' abundance.  Overall, the sizes of walleye in the lake are exceptional with walleye ranging in length from 11 to 26 inches, with a high percentage of the walleye being above 15 inches and even 20 inches.  The condition of walleye in Lake Benton is good and there appears to be plenty of food for walleye to eat (e.g., black bullhead), which may hurt your catch rates angling for walleye.  Speaking of black bullhead, the abundance of bullheads is very high compared to historical averages.  There was a very large year class (fish from a specific years reproduction) developed, most likely from 2002, that is in Lake Benton.  So, the population of black bullhead in Lake Benton is mostly all the same age and around 9 inches in length.  Therefore, the catch rates of black bullheads in trap nets have declined each of the past 3 surveys as mortality picks away at that year class.  Again, maintaining a high walleye abundance aids in controlling the numbers of bullheads even though most lakes in southern Minnesota occasionally have a large year class of bullheads here and there regardless of walleye abundance. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike numbers have remained relatively consistent among years in Lake Benton with a catch rate of around one fish/net.  Because we utilize a passive gear for capture (gill nets and frame nets) we rely on fish to move in order to encounter our sampling gear and be captured.  Subsequently, northern pike are not captured very effectively in our sampling gears because we generally survey Lake Benton in mid-July during a time that pike are out in the deepest coolest waters or just are not very active.  With that said, Lake Benton can provide good northern pike angling and most pike currently range in length up to 24 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nPanfish species such as bluegill, black crappie, and yellow perch are present in Lake Benton.  DNR netting suggests that the populations of panfish are at or below the historic averages.  Bluegill sizes in Lake Benton are around 9 inches, black crappie from 4 to 10 inches, and yellow perch are near 11 inches in length.  Yellow perch numbers in particular were low based on the 2006 survey.  This could indicate that the high black bullhead abundance currently in Lake Benton may be inhibiting yellow perch. <br> \n <br> \nThe DNR continues to stock about 2.5 million walleye fry every-other-year to maintain consistent year classes.  The DNR also plans to continue monitoring the Lake Benton fishery in conjunction with the continued treatment of the lake to control curly leafed pondweed. <br> \n <br> \nLake Benton has been treated with Fluridone annually since 2005 to help control the exotic invasive curly leafed pondweed.  There has been some concern from the public regarding the edibility of fish in Lake Benton given the treatments of the lake with a chemical.  Fluridone acts by blocking the carotenoids (yellow, orange, and red pigments) in plants.  Chlorophyll, which is used to convert sunlight into food by plants, is protected from sunlight by carotenoids.  This is why you will notice plants turning white in the days and weeks following treatment with Fluridone as the sun destroys the unprotected chlorophyll.  Once the chlorophyll is destroyed the plants no longer can convert sunlight into the sugars the plants need for energy.  The end result is that the plants basically starve to death.  This action is limited strictly to plants and since fish or humans do not have chlorophyll there is no apparent harm to either the fish or humans that consume the fish, even immediately after treatment.  Therefore, there is no known concern or human health hazard with the consumption of fish from a Fluridone treated body of water, such as Lake Benton. <br> \n <br> \nEnjoy your fishing, <br> \n <br> \n-Prepared by Craig Soupir, NR Fisheries Specialist <br> \n</p>",

Lake Benton is managed primarily for Walleye and secondarily for Yellow Perch, Northern Pike, Black Crappie, and Bluegill.  Since 2006, natural reproduction of Walleye has been documented in each non-stocked year (2008, 2011, and 2014).  Nighttime electrofishing was conducted on October 12, 2017 to check for natural reproduction of Walleye because 2017 was a non-stocked year.  <br> \n <br> \nYoung-of-the year Walleye were captured at a rate of 4.0 per hour electrofishing, which indicates that natural reproduction was very limited or predation of those walleye was high.  We typically suspect high predation when we have high numbers of Age 1 and Age 2 walleye in the population, which Lake Benton currently has at this time.  The age-0 Walleyes ranged in length from 8.3 to 9.7 inches and averaged 8.9 inches. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Electrofishing for age-0 Walleye was conducted on 26 September 2023 on Lake Benton. Lake Benton was not stocked with walleye fry during 2023, so any age-0 walleye sampled would have been from natural reproduction or emigration. One-hundred-ninety-two (192) age-0 Walleye were sampled during 32 minutes of electrofishing. Sampling was conducted during late day. Fin clips from 50 age-0 walleye were kept and sent for genetic testing to determine ancestry. It was determined that 32.4% of age-0 walleye were Spicer Strain (SPS) and 30.1% were Lower Mississippi Strain (LMS) with the remainder not assigning distinctly to any strain and were a cross of genetic strains.  Therefore, including the genetic crosses, Lake Benton is unique in that southern Minnesota strains are extremely dominant and make up nearly the entire 2023 year class. Spicer strain Walleye (Spicer Area Fisheries Office egg take) were last stocked in 2016 with stocking occurring from the early 2000's until 2016.  Lower Mississippi Strain (Windom Area Fisheries Office egg take) Walleye have been stocked in Lake Benton since 2018 with spawning size fish (age-3 and older) becoming more common over the past several years. It appears that Lake Benton may contain an increasingly unique walleye population with more and more evidence of natural reproduction during the past 20 years. Since 2005, Lake Benton has a contribution of 20% due to natural reproduction. The 20% is only what can be determined during years where other walleye are not stocked, so the true percentage could actually be greater with natural reproduction adding to the population during years were walleye fry are stocked. More investigation into natural reproduction via genetic testing of year classes caught in gill nets and electrofishing will be done on Lake Benton.       </p>",
