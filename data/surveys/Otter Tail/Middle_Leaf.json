Age data indicates good reproduction with strong 1986 and 1987 year classes present in the sample.   <br> \n     Yellow perch were represented in the gill net sample; however, previous surveys have always indicated low abundance (1984 - 0.2; 1978 - 4.3; 1960 - 5.2 per gill net).   <br> \n     Walleye abundance increased from 1.8 per gill net lift in 1984 to 3.0 per net; however, it is still below the area median.

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of nearshore fish species in Middle Leaf Lake was conducted on July 20, 2022 by Fergus Falls Area Fisheries Staff.  Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible.  Electrofishing was completed at all ten sampling stations, but two stations were moved a short distance due to site conditions and two stations were sampled by boat electrofishing.  Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample two stations, a 15-foot seine was used at five stations, and soft sediments and abundant vegetation prevented the use of seines at three stations.  Nearshore sampling captured 17 species of fish including three species that are intolerant of disturbance (i.e., Banded Killifish, Iowa Darter and Logperch) and two species that are tolerant of disturbance (i.e., Fathead Minnow and Green Sunfish). <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore data were combined with trap net and gill net data from a July 2022 survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based IBI (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment.  In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g., Banded Killifish, Iowa Darter and Logperch), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g., Fathead Minnow and Green Sunfish).  The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake.  For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.   <br> \n <br> \nResults from this survey indicate the fish community of Middle Leaf Lake is affected by disturbance as indicated by a FIBI score below the threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes. Data from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Leaf River Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Middle Leaf Lake is a 398 acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located in eastern Otter Tail County, approximately fives miles north of Henning.  It has a maximum depth of 43 feet and 45% of the lake is 15 feet or less in depth.  Shoreline substrates consist primarily of sand interspersed with areas of silt.  Secchi disk readings, a measure of water clarity, have been taken during fish assessments since 1960.  The reading in 1999 was 7.7 feet.  Past readings have been between 7.3 and 10.6 feet.  There is an annual fall tullibee netting season on Middle Leaf Lake.  A public access is located on the northwest shoreline.     Development on Middle Leaf Lake is considered light to moderate.  Most dwellings are located along the north shoreline.  One resort is located on the lake.  Emergent vegetation (cattails and bulrush) are located throughout the basin.        Middle Leaf Lake is popular for both winter and open water angling.  The eighteen-year average of winter fish houses is 36.  The lake contains good populations of bluegill, largemouth bass and black crappie.  Suitable spawning habitat exists throughout the lake basin for these species to flourish.  Northern pike numbers are extremely high and the population is dominated by small fish.  Yellow perch abundance, a forage fish for northern pike and walleye, is very low in Middle Leaf Lake and may limit predator populations.  The walleye population in Middle Leaf Lake is primarily maintained by stocking.  Although some natural reproduction exists, stocking is needed to increase the walleye population to current management goals.  Average length and weight of walleye sampled in 1999 was 17.1 inches and 1.77 pounds.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>    Middle Leaf Lake is a 398-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located in eastern Otter Tail County approximately five miles north of Henning, MN.  Middle Leaf Lake is connected to East and West Leaf Lakes via unnavigable waterways.  The immediate watershed is composed primarily of agricultural land interspersed with hardwood woodlots.  Middle Leaf Lake has a maximum depth of 43 feet; however, 45% of the lake is 15 feet or less in depth.  The secchi disk reading during the 2022 survey was 8.5 feet.  Previous secchi disk readings have ranged from 7.3 to 10.6 feet.    <br> \n     Development on Middle Leaf Lake is primarily located along the north shoreline.  Homes and cabins compose the majority of the development.  One resort is located on the northwest shoreline.  A state owned concrete public access is also located on the northwest shoreline. Shoreline substrates consist primarily of sand and silt.  Emergent vegetation (hardstem bulrush, wild rice, and cattails) is prevalent along the entire shoreline of the lake.  Emergent aquatic plants such as bulrush and cattail provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat, and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms, and can actually absorb and break down polluting chemicals.  Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish such as Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, and panfish.  They also serve as important nursery areas for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit.  To maintain the excellent water quality and angling that this lake has to offer, it is imperative to preserve the quality of the aquatic habitat. <br> \n     Middle Leaf Lake can be ecologically classified as a bass-panfish type of lake and this is reflected in the assemblage of the fish community.  Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, Black Crappie, and Bluegill are the dominant game-fish species in the fish community.  The prolificacy of these species can be attributed to the abundance of suitable spawning habitat that is available.     <br> \n     Northern Pike are very abundant and age data indicate that Northern Pike reproduction is consistently good.  Northern Pike size structure has improved from previous surveys.  Pike ranged in length from 15.8 to 31.5 inches with an average length and weight of 20.7 inches and 2.1 pounds.  Northern Pike attain an average length of 24.0 inches at five years of age.   <br> \n     Age data indicate that Largemouth Bass reproduction is also consistently good.  Bass ranged in length from 5.2 to 15.2 inches.  Largemouth Bass attain an average length of 13.0 inches at four years of age. <br> \n     The 2020 year class of Black Crappies appears to be strong and should provide consistently good angling for several years.  Black Crappies ranged in length from 4.3 to 11.5 inches.  Black Crappies attain an average length of 10.9 inches at five years of age.  <br> \n     Bluegill abundance has historically remained very stable.  Age data indicate that Bluegill reproduction is consistently good.  A high quality size structure exists, with Bluegills up to 10.3 inches represented in the sample.  Bluegills attain an average length of 8.4 inches at eight years of age. <br> \n     Anglers can maintain or improve the quality of angling by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large size fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future.   <br> \n     Middle Leaf Lake is not listed as an infested water.  Aquatic invasive species are threatening Minnesota waters.  The non-native species can potentially harm water quality, water recreation, aquatic habitat, native species, and fish populations.  Anglers can help prevent the introduction and spread of invasive species by following watercraft transportation laws. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Middle Leaf Lake is a 398-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located in eastern Otter Tail County approximately fives miles north of Henning, MN.  Middle Leaf Lake is connected to East and West Leaf Lakes via unnavigable culverts.  The immediate watershed is composed primarily of agricultural land interspersed with hardwood woodlots.  Middle Leaf Lake has a maximum depth of 43 feet; however, 45% of the lake is 15 feet or less in depth.  The secchi disk reading during the 2004 survey was 12.0 feet.  Previous secchi disk readings have ranged from  7.3 to 10.6 feet.  Middle Leaf Lake is included in class 24 of the Minnesota DNR lake classification scheme.      Development on Middle Leaf Lake is primarily located along the north shoreline.  The 1994 lake resurvey report referenced 52 homes/cabins along the shoreline.  One resort is located on northwest shoreline.  A state owned concrete public access is located on the northwest shoreline. Shoreline substrates consist primarily of sand and silt.  Emergent vegetation (hardstem bulrush, wild rice, and cattails) is prevalent along the entire shoreline of the lake.  Emergent aquatic plants such as bulrush and cattail provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat, and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms, and can actually absorb and break down polluting chemicals.  Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish such as northern pike, largemouth bass, and panfish.  They also serve as important nursery areas for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit.  To maintain the excellent water quality and angling that this lake has to offer, it is imperative to preserve the quality of the aquatic habitat.     Middle Leaf Lake can be ecologically classified as a bass-panfish type of lake and this is reflected in the assemblage of the fish community.  Northern pike, largemouth bass, and bluegill are the dominant species in the fish community.  The prolificacy of these species can be attributed to the abundance of suitable spawning habitat that is available.       The test-net catch rate for northern pike was equivalent to the upper limit of the normal range for lake class 24.  Northern pike size structure has historically remained poor.  In this assessment, only 6% of the pike were 24.0 inches or greater in length.  Northern pike growth is slow with an average length of 19.8 inches at four years of age.  Slow growth may be attributed to the low abundance of yellow perch, a preferred forage of northern pike.     Test-net catch data indicate that largemouth bass are abundant.  Age data indicate that largemouth bass reproduction is consistently good.  Bass ranged in length from 8.7 to 14.9 inches with an average length and weight of 12.7 inches and 1.2 pounds.  Bass attain an average length of 12.4 inches at four years of age.     The bluegill test-net catch rate was within the normal range.  Bluegill size structure has historically been poor.  Only 5% of the bluegill were 7.0 inches or greater in length.  Bluegill attain an average length of 7.1 inches at seven years of age.     Anglers can maintain or improve the quality of angling by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large-size fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future.     </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of the nearshore fish community in Middle Leaf Lake was conducted by Fisheries Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program Staff starting August 21, 2018. Ten sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 15-foot or 50-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at all ten sites with four sites sampled from the boat. Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample seven sites, a 15-foot seine was used at one site and soft and deep sediments prevented the use of seines at two sampling sites. Nearshore sampling captured 26 native species of fish including eight species that are intolerant of disturbance (Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, Least Darter, Logperch, Pugnose Shiner, and Rock Bass), two native species that are tolerant of disturbance (Fathead Minnow and Green Sunfish).   <br> \n <br> \nData from this targeted nearshore survey is combined with trap net and gill net data from a July 2017 standard survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based Index of Biological Integrity (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment. The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. The FIBI score for Middle Leaf Lake from this survey is above an impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes. For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website. <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Redeye River Watershed assessment of surface waters process completed in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>     Middle Leaf Lake is a 398-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located in eastern Otter Tail County approximately five miles north of Henning, MN.  Middle Leaf Lake is connected to East and West Leaf Lakes via unnavigable culverts.  The immediate watershed is composed primarily of agricultural land interspersed with hardwood woodlots.  Middle Leaf Lake has a maximum depth of 43 feet; however, 45% of the lake is 15 feet or less in depth.  The secchi disk reading during the 2010 survey was 8.0 feet.  Previous secchi disk readings have ranged from 7.3 to 10.6 feet.    <br> \n     Development on Middle Leaf Lake is primarily located along the north shoreline.  The 1994 lake resurvey report referenced 52 homes/cabins along the shoreline.  One resort is located on the northwest shoreline.  A state owned concrete public access is also located on the northwest shoreline. Shoreline substrates consist primarily of sand and silt.  Emergent vegetation (hardstem bulrush, wild rice, and cattails) is prevalent along the entire shoreline of the lake.  Emergent aquatic plants such as bulrush and cattail provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat, and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms, and can actually absorb and break down polluting chemicals.  Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish such as northern pike, largemouth bass, and panfish.  They also serve as important nursery areas for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit.  To maintain the excellent water quality and angling that this lake has to offer, it is imperative to preserve the quality of the aquatic habitat. <br> \n     Middle Leaf Lake can be ecologically classified as a bass panfish type of lake and this is reflected in the assemblage of the fish community.  Northern pike, largemouth bass, and bluegill are the dominant game-fish species in the fish community.  The prolificacy of these species can be attributed to the abundance of suitable spawning habitat that is available.     <br> \n     An abundant northern pike population exists.  Age data indicate that northern pike reproduction is consistently good.  Northern pike size structure has historically remained poor.  In this assessment, only 4% of the pike were 24.0 inches or greater in length.  Northern pike growth is slow with an average length of 20.1 inches at four years of age.  Slow growth may be attributed to the low abundance of yellow perch, a preferred forage of northern pike. <br> \n     Test-net catch data indicate that largemouth bass are abundant.  Age data indicate that largemouth bass reproduction is also consistently good.  Bass ranged in length from 8.0 to 15.3 inches with an average length and weight of 13.0 inches and 1.3 pounds.  Bass attain an average length of 12.2 inches at four years of age. <br> \n     Bluegill abundance has historically remained very stable.  Age data indicate that bluegill reproduction is consistently good.  Bluegill size structure has historically been poor.  Only 7% of the bluegills were 7.0 inches or greater in length.  Bluegills attain an average length of 7.1 inches at eight years of age. <br> \n     Anglers can maintain or improve the quality of angling by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large size fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future.      <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>     Middle Leaf Lake is a 398-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located in eastern Otter Tail County approximately five miles north of Henning, MN.  Middle Leaf Lake is connected to East and West Leaf Lakes via unnavigable culverts.  The immediate watershed is composed primarily of agricultural land interspersed with hardwood woodlots.  Middle Leaf Lake has a maximum depth of 43 feet; however, 45% of the lake is 15 feet or less in depth.  The secchi disk reading was 8.2 feet.  Previous secchi disk readings have ranged from 7.3 to 10.6 feet.    <br> \n     Development on Middle Leaf Lake is primarily located along the north shoreline.  Homes and cabins compose the majority of the development.  One resort is located on the northwest shoreline.  A state owned concrete public access is also located on the northwest shoreline. Shoreline substrates consist primarily of sand and silt.  Emergent vegetation (hardstem bulrush, wild rice, and cattails) is prevalent along the entire shoreline of the lake.  Emergent aquatic plants such as bulrush and cattail provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat, and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms, and can actually absorb and break down polluting chemicals.  Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish such as Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, and panfish.  They also serve as important nursery areas for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit.  To maintain the excellent water quality and angling that this lake has to offer, it is imperative to preserve the quality of the aquatic habitat. <br> \n     Middle Leaf Lake can be ecologically classified as a bass-panfish type of lake and this is reflected in the assemblage of the fish community.  Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, Black Crappie and Bluegill are the dominant game-fish species in the fish community.  The prolificacy of these species can be attributed to the abundance of suitable spawning habitat that is available.     <br> \n     Age data indicate that Northern Pike reproduction is consistently good.  Northern pike size structure has historically remained poor.  Twelve percent of the pike were 24.0 inches or greater in length.  Northern Pike growth is slow with an average length of 22.0 inches at four years of age.   <br> \n     Age data indicate that Largemouth Bass reproduction is also consistently good.  Bass ranged in length from 8.8 to 16.8 inches with an average length and weight of 13.3 inches and 1.4 pounds.  Bass attain an average length of 12.0 inches at four years of age. <br> \n     The 2015 year class of Black Crappies appears to be strong and should provide consistently good angling for several years.  Thirty-two percent of the crappies were 10.0 inches or greater in length.  Black Crappies attain an average length of 9.4 inches at five years of age.  <br> \n     Bluegill abundance has historically remained very stable.  Age data indicate that Bluegill reproduction is consistently good.  Bluegill size structure has historically been poor.  Only 8% of the Bluegills were 7.0 inches or greater in length.  Bluegills attain an average length of 6.6 inches at six years of age. <br> \n     Anglers can maintain or improve the quality of angling by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large size fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future.   <br> \n     Middle Leaf Lake is not listed as an infested water.  Aquatic invasive species are threatening Minnesota waters.  The non-native species can potentially harm water quality, water recreation, aquatic habitat, native species, and fish populations.  Anglers can help prevent the introduction and spread of invasive species by following watercraft transportation laws.  Anglers are required to remove all visible plants, mud, and other prohibited invasive species and drain all water from their boat prior to leaving the water access.     <br> \n </p>",
