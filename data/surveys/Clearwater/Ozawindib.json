Northern Pike are abundant but are generally small. The largest pike captured was about 28 inches in length and about 6 pounds. The majority of the Northern Pike are 15-19 inches. There doesn't appear to be an adequate forage base to achieve better growth for these fish.Bluegill are abundant though most fish are too small to be attractive to area anglers. The average length is 5.5 inches.Black Crappie have declined in numbers and size over the past four surveys with the abundance declining to about half in the past 10 years. Largemouth Bass also appear to be experiencing a steady decline in both numbers and weight, though a few larger fish are still present.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Ozawindib is a remote 159-acre lake with a maximum depth of 80 feet located within Itasca State Park in southern Clearwater County.  There is a public water access with concrete ramp and parking for 6 vehicles/trailers located on the north shore of the lake off of Wilderness Drive.  There is an accessible fishing pier located at the parking area.  A State Park daily or annual vehicle permit is required.   <br> \n <br> \nSpecial regulations on Lake Ozawindib consist of a reduced 5-fish bag limit for Black Crappie and a protected slot limit for Largemouth Bass (all fish from 14 to 20 inches must be immediately released with one fish over 20 inches in length allowed in possession).  Statewide fishing regulations apply to all other species in Lake Ozawindib.  The lake is managed for Northern Pike, Black Crappie and Largemouth Bass.  The lake contains excellent habitat for all fish species present.   <br> \n <br> \nThe 2020 survey showed a quality Northern Pike population.  Pike up to 37 inches in length were captured with a good average size of more than 23 inches and nearly 4 pounds.  Fifty percent of pike captured in the survey were greater than 26 inches in length.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie and Bluegill were captured in good numbers.  Catch rates were above average compared to similar lakes in the state for both species.  Anglers can expect to catch Bluegill from 5 to 8 inches in length and Black Crappie around 10 inches in length with some larger fish mixed in.  An accessible fishing pier located near the boat ramp offers a good shore fishing opportunity for these species.  <br> \n  <br> \nStandard surveys do not capture Largemouth Bass effectively although Ozawindib is known to have a quality population as documented in previous surveys targeting the species.  Largemouth Bass up to 16 inches in length were present in this survey.   <br> \n <br> \nOther species of fish captured were Yellow Perch, Yellow Bullhead, Pumpkinseed Sunfish, Hybrid Sunfish, Green Sunfish and Rock Bass.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of nearshore fish species in Ozawindib Lake was conducted on August 15, 2022, by DNR Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program staff. Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake, and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at nine sampling stations, but one station was sampled from the boat due to site conditions. Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample five stations, a 15-foot seine was used at three stations, and site conditions prevented the use of seines at two stations. Nearshore sampling captured 15 species of fish including three species that are intolerant of disturbance (i.e., Blackchin Shiner, Iowa Darter, and Rock Bass) and one that is tolerant of disturbance (i.e., Green Sunfish). <br> \n <br> \nA summer trap net survey was also conducted by IBI Program staff on August 15-16, 2022. Nine trap nets were set along the shoreline in locations that encompassed multiple habitat types. Trap net sampling captured eight species of fish, including one that is intolerant of disturbance (i.e., Rock Bass). Bluegill comprised a majority of the catch by number and biomass.  <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore and trap net data were combined with gill net data from a 2020 survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based IBI (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment. In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g., Blackchin Shiner, Iowa Darter, and Rock Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g., Green Sunfish). The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.  <br> \n <br> \nResults from this survey indicate that the fish community in Ozawindib Lake is healthy as indicated by an FIBI score that meets the exceptional use threshold determined for similar lakes. Data from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Mississippi River - Headwaters Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Ozawindib Lake is a 151-acre lake with a maximum depth of 80 feet.  The lake is located three miles southwest of Lake Itasca in Clearwater County.  There is a public access in the northeast corner of the lake.  The lake is entirely within Itasca State Park with all of the shoreline under public ownership.  A state park permit is required to gain access to lakes in the park.  The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources has classified      Minnesota's lakes into 43 different lake classes based on physical and chemical characteristics.  Ozawindib Lake is in lake class 23.   Typically lakes in this class are deep, clear and with small amounts of area that is less than 15 feet deep.  Other area lakes in the same lake class include South Long,  Buck, Grant, North and South Twin, Swenson and Elk  Lakes.  Primary management is for northern pike and largemouth bass.Northern pike abundance was typical of other lake class 23 lakes.   It was slightly lower than what was found in past surveys.  Fish ranged in length from 12 to 28 inches with an average length of 20 inches.  This was the highest average length over the past three surveys.  In 2001 the average weight was 1.8 pound and comparable to other lake class 23 lakes.  There appears to be a lack of food fish for northern pike which may be limiting      growth.  Few perch were sampled in 2001 as was the case in previous surveys.  There were nine different northern pike year classes identified in the sample.  The two strongest  year classes were the 1997 and 1998 year classes.Anglers should have good success angling for sunfish.  There are ample numbers of bluegill and pumpkinseed sunfish in Ozawindib Lake.  Bluegill ranged in length from 2.9 to 9.9 inches long with an average length of 5.2 inches.  Growth is typical of other lake class 23 lakes.  After five years of growth, bluegill in Ozawindib are five inches long.  There was a slight decline in quality from earlier surveys.  To maintain or improve quality, anglers should use some restraint when large panfish such as bluegill or black crappie are really biting.   Quality size panfish have disappeared from many lakes due to excessive harvest by anglers.  Releasing the larger panfish and keeping the smaller ones for eating would help maintain some quality. Black crappie abundance was slightly above what was found in past surveys and above what you would typically find in other lake class 23 lakes.  Fish ranged in length from 4.8 to 11.8 inches with an average length and weight of 9.4 inches and 0.4 pound.  Black crappie that were four years old made up 48% of the sample.Only two walleye were sampled in 2001.  Few walleye have been sampled in earlier surveys when walleye were being stocked.  The lack of quality forage species, particularly yellow perch limits the lake's ability to support a decent walleye population.  Walleye were stocked in the past with little success and that program has been discontinued.Special sampling with electrofishing gear indicates a very healthy largemouth bass population.  Catch rates were good and the size distribution of the catch had good representation from 3 to 20 inches in length.</p>",

Ozawindib is one of four lakes located within the park that were selected for the implementation of special fishing regulations in 2006.  Special regulations on Lake Ozawindib consist of a minimum size limit of 10 inches for Black Crappie and a protected slot limit for Largemouth Bass (all fish from 12 to 20 inches must be immediately released with one fish over 20 inches in length allowed in possession).  Statewide fishing regulations apply to all other species in Lake Ozawindib.  The lake is managed for Northern Pike, Black Crappie and Largemouth Bass. <br> \n <br> \nThe Minnesota Department of Natural Resources has classified Minnesota lakes into 43 different lake classes based on physical characteristics and the fish community present.  Lake Ozawindib is in lake class 23.  The following discussion makes comparisons between Lake Ozawindib and other class 23 lakes in the state.  Other Bemidji area lakes in this class include North Twin, South Twin, and Grant Lake. <br> \n <br> \nThe Northern Pike catch rate of 9.5/gill net was above the normal range found in similar lakes (2.19/gill net to 8.70/gill net).  While pike are abundant and can provide plenty of fishing action, the average size in the 2015 survey was on the small side at 19.58 inches in length and 1.97 lbs/fish.  Twelve percent of the pike captured in the survey were greater than 24 inches in length, with the largest pike captured measuring 34.25 inches in length. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie are often targeted by anglers on Lake Ozawindib.  The minimum size limit of 10 inches in length implemented in 2006 was intended to increase the average size of harvested Black Crappie by reducing harvest of small fish, improve size structure of the crappie population and provide more consistent crappie fishing from year to year.  A series of spring assessments have been conducted as part of an evaluation of the special regulation for Black Crappie on Lake Ozawindib. The series of spring surveys for Black Crappie shows a steady increase in trap net catch rates since the first survey in 2005, culminating in a catch rate of 20.59/trap net in the spring of 2015.  In 2015, 23% of the catch exceeded 10 inches in length, with Black Crappie up to 11.61 inches in length captured in the survey. <br> \n <br> \nAn electrofishing assessment targeting Largemouth Bass was conducted as part of the 2015 survey.  The electrofishing catch rate of 48.45 bass/hour was a moderately high catch rate for the Bemidji area and shows a healthy population.  Largemouth Bass up to 18.90 inches in length were captured in the assessment.  The lake contains good habitat for Largemouth Bass, with extensive weedlines as well as steeper shoreline drop offs and a number of large trees that have fallen into the lake. <br> \n <br> \nThe 2015 Bluegill catch rate of 20.56/trap net was just above the average catch rate for other similar lakes (19.83/trap net).  The Bluegill population has shown some improvement since the last survey in 2005, with a high proportion of the catch (51%) exceeding 7 inches in length and Bluegill up to 8.35 inches in length captured in the survey.  A newly installed accessible fishing pier located near the public access should provide good shore fishing opportunities for Bluegill as well as the other primary species of fish found in the lake. <br> \n <br> \nOther species of fish captured in the 2015 survey were Rock Bass, Pumpkinseed, Hybrid Sunfish, Yellow Perch, and White Sucker.</p>",

Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake, and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible.  Backpack electrofishing was completed at 10 sampling stations, but three stations were sampled from the boat due to site conditions.  Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample two stations, a 15-foot seine was used at five stations, and site conditions prevented the use of seines at three stations.  Nearshore sampling captured 12 species of fish including two species that are intolerant of disturbance (Blackchin Shiner, Iowa Darter) and one species that is tolerant of disturbance (Green Sunfish). <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore data were combined with trap net and gill net data from a June 2020 survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based IBI (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment.  In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (Blackchin Shiner, and Iowa Darter), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (Green Sunfish). The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake.  For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.   <br> \n <br> \nResults from this survey indicate that the fish community in Ozawindib Lake is healthy as indicated by an exceptionally high FIBI score, well above the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes. These results will be considered when the biological health of the lake is assessed during the Mississippi River-Headwaters Watershed assessment process, which will be completed in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency. <br> \n</p>",
