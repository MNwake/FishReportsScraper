                "narrative": "<p>Lake Agnes, along with Lakes Henry and Winona, comprise a chain of lakes within the city limits of Alexandria.  Lakes Agnes and Henry are broadly connected basins with a common \"narrows\" on the north side of Lake Agnes and south side of Lake Henry.  A 200-foot long sand and rock bar separates the two basins.  This bar is one to two feet under the water surface during normal water levels.  These lakes received treated sewage effluent from the City of Alexandria dating back to the 1920's.  A new tertiary sewage treatment plant (ALASD) began operating on the south shore of Lake Winona in 1977.  Total phosphorus discharges were reduced by approximately 90 percent.  Water quality in Lakes Agnes and Henry improved greatly with less nutrient loading, but the basins remain nutrient rich.  Lake Agnes is still vulnerable to periodic fish kills during summer and winter months. <br> \n <br> \nA fish kill event was reported on March, 20, 2011.  Numerous dead fish were observed at the inlet to Lake Agnes and outlet of Lake Henry.  An ice-out electrofishing survey in May, 2011 sampled very few fish.  Adult broodstock largemouth bass, bluegill and black crappie were stocked in the spring of 2011.  <br> \n <br> \nNo largemouth bass were sampled during the 2011 electrofishing survey.  However, mid-summer shoreline seining efforts in Lake Henry yielded numerous juvenile largemouth bass.   The 12.0-inch maximum with one over 20.0 inches harvest regulation established in 2006 remains in effect and will provide additional protection to this recovering population. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie, bluegill, and yellow perch abundance declined, likely in response to the partial fish kill.  Black crappie remained fairly abundant, but trapnet catches did decline substantially since the 2007 survey in probable response to the fish kill.  Mean length of crappie captures was 7.1 inches.  Bluegill trapnet catches averaged 5.8-ish/net in 2011 as compared to 69.3-fish/trapnet in 2007.  Average size of bluegill was 6.4 inches in length.  Yellow perch gillnet catches averaged 13.3-fish/net in 2011 as compared to 173.3- fish/trapnet in 2007.  Most captured perch were between 5.0 and 7.0 inches in length and too small to contribute to the fishery. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike numbers remain stable.  Gillnet catches averaged 6.0-fish/net in 2011.  Average weight of sampled northern pike was 3.2 pounds.  Eleven percent of the sample exceeded 28.0 inches in total length.  The largest individual measured 40.9 inches.  <br> \nCommon carp were captured from in Lake Agnes in 2007 after many years of absence.  Abundance has increased with reproduction and additional migration from downstream lakes.   Average length of the population sample was 16.0 inches. <br> \n <br> \nPublic ownership of portions of the shoreline affords anglers opportunities to fish from shore.  A handicapped accessible fishing pier is located in City Park on the northeast shore of Lake Agnes. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Agnes, along with lakes Winona and Henry, comprise a chain of lakes within the city limits of Alexandria.  These lakes received partially treated sewage effluent from the city of Alexandria dating back to the 1920's.  The modern sewage treatment plant (ALASD) began operating on the south shore of Lake Winona in 1977 and reduced the phosphorus inflow into the lakes by approximately 90 percent.  Water quality in lakes Agnes and Henry improved following the operation of the modern sewage treatment plant.  However, Lake Agnes still suffers from seasonal poor water quality and clarity.  The lake is still prone to periodic fish kills during summer and winter months from low oxygen concentrations.  Phosphorus concentrations are still high from historic inputs as well as direct storm sewer run off from the urban watershed.  The city of Alexandria recently constructed two stormwater retention ponds to partially treat the surface water entering Lake Agnes from the urban watershed.  The fish community in Lake Agnes continues to improve.  There are presently good numbers of northern pike, largemouth bass, bluegill, and black crappie.  All of these species are experiencing rapid growth rates, thus average size of these species is relatively large.  For example, northern pike averaged 3.0 pounds in weight and one-third of the largemouth bass were 15 inches in length or greater.  A handicapped accessible fishing pier located in City Park on the north shore of Lake Agnes allows anglers to pursue these species from shore.Walleye were not present in survey catches.  Anglers have reported catching a few large walleye in recent years.  Walleye fry were stocked in 2000 and 2002 to provide some additional fishing opportunities in Lake Agnes.  These stockings were apparently were unsuccessful.  The Lake Management Plan was amended to include walleye fingerling stockings instead of fry in even-numbered years beginning in 2004.         </p>",

Backpack electrofishing and/or seining were conducted at 10 stations, representing a variety of habitat types, along the shoreline of Lake Agnes.  The survey was conducted during the five-year sampling window for intensive monitoring efforts within the Long Prairie River watershed, and will be contributing to a watershed assessment process in coordination with Minnesota Pollution Control Agency.\n\nTen species were collected during this survey, indicating a relatively simple nearshore fish community.  Only one species (Iowa Darter) was considered \"intolerant\" and four species (Black Bullhead, Commn Carp, Fathead Minnow and Green Sunfish) were considered \"tolerant\" based on current tolerance classifications for Minnesota lakes. \n\nNearshore catch data will be used along with gill and trap net catch data to develop an Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) score, which is indicative of the health of Lake Agnes.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Agnes, along with Lakes Henry and Winona, comprise a chain of lakes within the city limits of Alexandria.  Lakes Agnes and Henry are broadly connected basins with a common \"narrows\" on the north side of Lake Agnes and south side of Lake Henry.  A 200-foot long sand and rock bar separates the two basins.  This bar is only one to two feet under the water surface during normal water levels.  Public ownership of portions of the southwest and northeast shoreline of Lake Agnes allows angler access to shore fishing opportunities.  A handicapped accessible fishing pier is located in City Park on the northeast shore.  Boaters should note that motorized water craft operation on Lake Agnes is regulated by a slow, no-wake restriction. <br> \n <br> \nA standard MN DNR lake survey was completed in June 2017 to assess the fish community.  The fish population continues to recover following a fish kill event in the winter of 2010-2011.  Black Crappie and Yellow Perch are abundant in Lakes Agnes and Henry.  Large 2011 year-classes are present from both species.  Black Crappie are growing slow, but most captures measured between 8 and 10 inches in length.   Yellow Perch growth is moderate and many were between 7 and 10 inches in length.  Bluegills are also present, although in lower numbers.  Some larger Bluegills measured over 9 inches. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye fingerlings have been stocked in alternate years since 2004.  Fingerling survival has been poor and Walleye abundance is low.  Lengths of Walleyes caught ranged from 7 to 22 inches.  Northern Pike abundance remains low, but high average size offers quality fishing opportunities.  More than half of the Northern Pike caught during the survey were over 30 inches in length. <br> \n <br> \nOnly a few adult Largemouth Bass were sampled during the 2017 survey.  Numerous juvenile bass were observed during other surveys.  In 2006 a harvest regulation was implemented that requires the immediate release of Largemouth Bass from 12-20 inches and allows only one fish over 20 inches in possession.  The regulation is still in effect while this population recovers. <br> \n</p>",

Bluegill, Black Crappie, and hybrid sunfish each averaged 2.0 fish/trap net.  One Yellow Perch was also captured in the two trap nets.  The fish community present in Lake Agnes is indicative of severely degraded habitat and frequent winterkill events.  A winterkill was likely during the winter of 1991-1992.  Dissolved oxygen concentrations fell below 2.0 ppm during February and the lake was opened to liberalized fishing on February 18, 1992.

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Agnes, along with lakes Winona and Henry, comprise a chain of lakes within the city limits ofAlexandria.  These lakes received partially treated sewage effluent from the city of Alexandria datingback to the 1920's.  Large amounts of phosphorus were  discharged into the lakes prior to 1977.  Thecurrent sewage treatment plant (ALASD) began operating on the south shore of Lake Winona in 1977 andreduced the phosphorus inflow into the lakes by approximately 90 percent.  Water quality in lakes Agnesand Henry improved dramatically following the operation of the modern sewage treatment plant.  However,there is still a considerable phosphorus load in Lake Agnes from historic inputs by the old sewagetreatment plant as well as surface and direct storm sewer run off from the predominately urbanwatershed.  The city of Alexandria and the Department of Natural Resources installed a fishing pier in the citypark along the northeast shore of Lake Agnes in 1998.  Angling success has been reported to be good. Bluegill, black crappie, yellow perch, and northern pike are present and should provide some goodaction for most anglers.  Largemouth bass were abundant in 1999 and should provide quality anglingopportunities.  Many fish were 15 inches in length or greater.   Smallmouth bass are also present. Numbers are likely low, so please practice catch and release.  Walleye were not sampled in 1999. However, local anglers have reported catching several large fish over the past two years.The shoreline by the fishing pier is also the site of an aquatic plant restoration effort by DouglasCounty Land and Resource Management and the Department of Natural Resources. Native grasses,wildflowers, and shrubs were planted along the shore and bulrush was transplanted in the lake.  Thesenative plants will provide fish and wildlife habitat and serve as a buffer to prevent runoff fromentering the lake.   </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Agnes is a small (137 acres), productive basin located within the Long Prairie River watershed.  Mean and maximum depths are 12 and 31 feet, respectively.  Lake Agnes, along with lakes Henry and Winona, comprise a chain of lakes within the city limits of Alexandria.  Lakes Agnes and Henry are broadly connected with a common \"narrows\" area between the two basins.  A shallow sand and rock bar separates the two basins.  This bar is only one to two feet under the water surface during normal water levels.  A public access is located along the southwest shoreline.  Boaters should note that motorized watercraft operation on Lake Agnes is regulated by a slow, no-wake restriction.  A popular walking trail surrounds the majority of the lake and public ownership of portions of the southwest and northeast shoreline provides shore fishing opportunities.  A handicapped accessible fishing pier is located in City Park on the northeast shore.  A second public fishing pier is located on the south shore off the Central Lakes Trail.     <br> \n <br> \nA standard MN DNR lake survey was completed in summer 2023 to assess the fish community.  Gamefish populations continue to expand in this basin as water quality and clarity continue to improve and aquatic vegetation becomes more abundant.  The shallow, productive nature of this basin results in fast growth and larger average size for most gamefishes.  A quality Largemouth Bass population was evident in 2023.  This population is currently protected by a special 12- to 20-inch protected slot limit.  All bass 12 to 20 inches in length must be immediately released with one bass over 20 inches allowed in possession.  Panfish species commonly targeted by anglers include Black Crappie, Bluegill, and Yellow Perch.  Black Crappie abundance has substantially declined in recent years due to a 2021 summerkill event that predominantly affected this species.  Crappie fisheries are typically \"boom or bust\" in nature so hopefully this population recovers soon.  Bluegill numbers have increased in recent years.  The current population is characterized as moderate, in terms of both abundance and size structure.  Yellow Perch are abundant.  Harvestable-size perch are available but smaller fish tend to dominate this population.  Northern Pike tend to exhibit lower abundance but larger average size on this basin.  Record-high Walleye abundance was documented in 2023.  Multiple year classes were sampled, with an average size of 16.6 inches and 2.2 pounds. <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species sampled in the 2023 survey included Brown Bullhead, Common Carp, Green Sunfish, and White Sucker.  White Suckers were particularly abundant. <br> \nThe next lake survey is tentatively scheduled for 2028.   <br> \n <br> \nLake Agnes is designated as an infested waterbody due to the presence of zebra mussels, which were first confirmed in 2022.

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Agnes, along with Lakes Henry and Winona, comprise a chain of lakes within the city limits of Alexandria.  Lakes Agnes and Henry are broadly connected basins with a common \"narrows\" area on the north side of Lake Agnes and south end of Lake Henry.  There is a 200-ft long sand and rock bar separating the two basins.  This bar is one to two feet under the water surface during normal water levels.  These lakes received partially treated sewage effluent from the City of Alexandria dating back to the 1920\u0019s.  The modern sewage treatment plant (ALASD) began operating on the south shore of Lake Winona in 1977.  Total phosphorus discharges were reduced by approximately 90 percent.  Water quality in Lakes Agnes and Henry improved greatly with less nutrient loading, but the basins remain nutrient rich.  Lake Agnes is still vulnerable to periodic fish kills during summer and winter months from low oxygen concentrations <br> \n <br> \nThe fish community in Lake Agnes continues to expand and diversify in response habitat improvements.  Northern pike numbers remain stable.  Gillnet catches averaged 7.0 fish/net in 2007.  Average weight of sampled northern pike was 4.0 pounds.  Thirty-three percent of the sample exceeded 28.0 inches in total length. <br> \n <br> \nA quality largemouth bass fishery has developed.  A 12.0-inch maximum with one over 20.0 inches harvest regulation was enacted on Lakes Agnes and Henry in 2006 in an effort to sustain a quality bass fishery.  Largemouth bass remain abundant.  Forty-three percent of fish captured by electrofishing exceeded 15.0 inches in total length.  The largest individual measured 19.0 inches in length. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie abundance has rebounded following a partial summerkill in 2002.  Trapnet catches averaged 30.5 fish/net in 2007.  Mean length of sampled fish was 7.6 inches. <br> \n  <br> \nBluegill numbers have increased dramatically.  Trapnet catches averaged 69.3 fish/net in 2007 as compared to 15.3 fish/trapnet in 2003.  Average size of bluegill was 6.9 inches in length. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch remain very abundant.  Gillnet catches averaged 173.3 fish/net.  The majority of the sampled fish were between 5.5 and 8.5 inches in length.  Larger fish contribute to angling diversity and harvest. <br> \n <br> \nCommon carp were not recorded in prior surveys in probable response to regular winterkill events and placement of a fish barrier in Floding's Creek between Lake Henry and Lake Le Homme Dieu.  This problematic species gained access to Lake Henry and Agnes sometime after the 2003 survey.  Carp catches in 2007 were very high, averaging 43.7 fish/net.  Mean length was 12.0 inches.  Any additional environmental stressors affecting gamefishes will favor further expansion of this tolerant fish.  <br> \n <br> \nPubic ownership of portions of the shoreline afford anglers opportunities to fish from shore.  A handicapped accessible fishing pier is located in City Park on the northeast shore of Lake Agnes. <br> \n  <br> \n</p>",
