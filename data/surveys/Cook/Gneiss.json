The catch in 1999 was just above the median for lakes of this class, and included a fairly high proportion of fish over 16 inches.  The lake also continues to support a small number of lake trout, even though water quality appears to be marginal for the species.  Fair numbers of northern pike were taken in 1999, however, northern pike reproduction appeared to have been sporadic recently, and most of the fish taken were only one year old.Major forage species present were yellow perch and northern cisco.  The yellow perch catch was low in 1999, but not unusually low for a lake of this class.  The northern cisco catch was fairly high, and most of the fish taken were small enough to provide excellent forage for walleye, northern pike, and lake trout.</p>",
