                "narrative": "<p>A population assessment was conducted at Union Lake in 2012 to monitor the fish population. Union is primarily managed for largemouth bass and bluegill. <br> \n <br> \nA total of 2 walleyes were sampled with gill nets for a catch rate of 0.7/net, indicating low numbers were present. The catch rate in 2007 was 1.3/net. Lengths in 2012 were 17.9 and 19.5 inches long. Historically, despite various stocking efforts, walleye catch rates in Union Lake have failed to reach moderate numbers in all but one year (1997). Walleye stocking was discontinued in 1992 after considering the habitat and fish community dynamics of the lake. The continued presence of walleyes in recent samples (2002, 2007, and 2012) may indicate a small, yet self-sustaining population persists in Union Lake. <br> \n <br> \nA total of 30 northern pike were sampled with gill nets for a catch rate of 10.0/net, indicating high numbers were present for the third straight sample (2002, 2007, and 2012). This was the second highest catch rate ever observed. Lengths ranged from 14.7 to 32.5 inches with an average length of 22.4 inches. Three northern pike measuring 15.6, 32.5, and 35.0 inches long were sampled with trap nets. Ages from both gears ranged from 1-7 years old with 7 year-classes present.  Growth rates were fast. <br> \n <br> \nThree yellow perch up to 6.4 inches long were sampled with gill nets for a catch rate of 1.0/net, indicating low numbers were present and matched the lowest catch rate ever recorded in 1989. Eleven perch were sampled with trap nets for a catch rate of 1.4/net. The trap netted fish ranged from 5.6 to 8.0 inches long with an average length of 6.8 inches. <br> \n <br> \nA total of 120 black crappies were sampled with trap nets for a catch rate of 15.0/net, indicating high numbers were present. The catch rate in 2007 was 8.9/net. In 2012, lengths ranged from 3.5 to 12.4 inches long with an average length of 4.8 inches. Despite the overall large sample size, only about 12% were larger than 5 inches. A total of 17 black crappies were also sampled with gill nets for a catch rate of 5.7/net, indicating moderate numbers were present. Ages from both gears ranged from 1-7 years old with 6 year-classes present. Age-1 fish accounted for 66% of the sample with an average length of 4.4 inches long. Growth rates were moderate. <br> \n <br> \nA total of 459 bluegills were sampled with trap nets for a catch rate of 57.4/net, indicating high numbers were present. Catch rates have increased since the 1997 sample of 13.9/net. The sampled fish ranged from 2.8 to 8.0 inches long with an average length of 5.7 inches. Approximately 18% of the trap netted bluegills were greater than 7 inches, but no individuals over 8 inches were sampled. Bluegills were by far the most commonly sampled fish species in the gill nets with 117 for a catch rate of 39.3/net. Over 32% were greater than 7 inches and one individual measured over 8 inches long. Ages from both gears ranged from 1-9 years old with 9 year-classes present. Growth rates were slow. <br> \n <br> \nA total of 18 largemouth bass were sampled with spring night-time electrofishing for a catch rate of 18.0/hour. The catch rate in 2007 was 14.4/hour. In 2012, largemouth bass were 3.7 to 18.6 inches long with an average length of 11.3 inches. Ages ranged from 1-8 years old with 6 year-classes present. Growth rates were slow. <br> \n <br> \nA total of 14 black bullheads were sampled with gill nets for a catch rate of 4.7/net, indicating moderate numbers were present. The catch rate in 2007 was 34.5/net. Nine black bullheads were sampled in trap nets for a catch rate of 1.1/net, also indicating moderate numbers were present. <br> \n <br> \nTwo common carp measuring 25.6 and 30.2 inches long were sampled with trap nets for a catch rate of 0.3/net, indicating low numbers were present. No carp were sampled with the gill nets. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled in 2012 include bowfin, brown bullhead, green sunfish, pumpkinseed, white sucker, and hybrid sunfish (Lepomis spp.). <br> \n</p>",

All were classified as rare, except cattail and coontail, which were ranked as common.  Silt was the only shoalwater substrate ranked as abundant.  Detritus, muck and sand were common.  The secchi disk reading was 2.5 feet in late July.  Lake shore owners are encouraged to protect emergent aquatic vegetation.  Cattails and lily pads provide food and cover for many fish and wildlife species, improve water clarity, reduce erosion, and improve aesthetics.  \n\nA total of 5 walleye were gill netted for a catch rate of 1.3/net, which indicated that low numbers of fish were present.  The catch rate in 2002 was 0.8/net.  In 2007, walleye were 11.3-22.5 inches long averaging 15.8 inches.  Walleye were 2-5 years old with 2 year-classes present.  Walleye were last stocked in 1989, thus indicating a self-sustaining population to be present. \n\nA total of 30 northern pike were gill netted for a catch rate of 7.5/net, which indicated that moderate numbers were present.  The catch rate in 2002 was 17.0/net.  In 2007, gill netted northern pike were 18.1-29.8 inches long averaging 22.6 inches.  Northern pike were 2-5 years old with 4 year-classes present.  Age 2 fish accounted for 59% of the gill net catch, indicating a stronger year-class.  \n\nA total of 9 yellow perch were gill netted for a catch rate of 2.3/net, which suggestd that low numbers were present.  The catch rate in 2002 was 12.3/net.  In 2007, yellow perch were 6.0-7.6 inches long.  Yellow perch were 2-5 years old with 3 year-classes present.  \n\nChannel catfish were not sampled in any type of gear in 2007.  Channel catfish were not gill netted or trap netted in 2002, but 1 was captured using a trotline that year.  \n\nA total of 80 black crappie were trap netted for a catch rate of 8.9/net, which indicated that moderate numbers were present.  The catch rate in 2002 was 10.2/net.  In 2007, black crappie were 5.3-10.2 inches long averaging 7.7 inches.  Black crappie were 2-6 years old with 5 year-classes present.  Growth was slow.\n\nA total of 339 bluegill were trap netted for a catch rate of 37.7/net, which indicated that moderate numbers were present.  The catch rate in 2002 was 23.3/net.  In 2007, bluegill were 0.6-7.3 inches long averaging 6.0 inches.  Approximately 7% of the trap net catch was 7 inches or longer.  Bluegill were 1-5 years old with 5 year-classes present.  Approximately 67% of the trap netted bluegill were age 3, suggesting a stronger year-class.\n\nA total of 50 black bullhead were trap netted for a catch rate of 5.6/net, which indicated that fair numbers were present.  The catch rate in 2002 was 4.1/net.  In 2007, black bullhead were 5.1-11.1 inches long averaging 9.9 inches.\n\nA total of 2 carp were trap netted for a catch rate of 0.2/net, which indicated that low numbers were present.  The catch rate in 2002 was 0.0/net.  In 2007, carp were 26.5-27.6 inches long.  In 2007, carp were not sampled in the gill nets.  \n\nA total of 13 largemouth bass were collected during spring night-time electrofishing, for a catch rate of 14.4/hour.  The catch rate suggested that a fair numbers were present.  The catch rate in 2003 was 44.3/hour.  Catch rates from 1992-2007 ranged from 2.0-44.3/hour averaging 17.3/hr.  In 2007, largemouth bass were 5.1-16.6 inches long averaging 10.2 inches.  Largemouth bass were 1-6 years old with 4 year-classes present.   \n\nA total of 8 varieties of fish were captured during shoreline seining.  Young-of-the-year were sampled for black crappie (2), bluegill (249), hybrid sunfish (3), largemouth bass (15), and yellow perch (2).\n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A standard survey was conducted at Union Lake the week of July 24, 2017 to monitor the fish population.  The 2013 lake management plan lists Bluegill and Largemouth Bass as primary management species while Northern Pike and Black Crappie are listed as secondary species.  In 2017, a total of 15 species, plus Hybrid Sunfish, were sampled in the gill nets, trap nets, or by electrofishing.  Catch rates were compared to other similar lakes across the state.  Dissolved oxygen levels dropped below 2 mg/L at a depth of 10 feet on 7/24/17, indicating that deepwater portions of the lake were not suitable for fish to use this time of the year; maximum depth on Union Lake is 35 feet.  The water clarity was fair, with a secchi disk reading of 6.8 feet due to a bog stain.  Curlyleaf Pondweed, a non-native invasive aquatic plant, was abundant (surface mats) around much of the lake's shoal areas in mid-May.  This type of submergent vegetation typically dies back in early July.  Boat parking is limited on this small lake.   <br> \n <br> \nTrap nets sampled high numbers (706) of Bluegill for a catch rate of 78.4/net which was above what might be expected for this type of lake.  The 2012 catch rate was similar at 57.4/net.  Historic catch rates from 1972 to 2017 (n=14) ranged from 13.9 to 146.0/net, with an average of 56.7.  Catches indicated an upward trend since the 1997 assessment.  In 2017, trap netted Bluegill were 3.2 to 8.4 inches long with an average of 5.7.  Approximately 30% of the trap net catch was 7 inches or longer, indicating that a quality population was present.  Size distributions indicated that multiple ages were present, likely indicating consistent reproduction most years.  Bluegill anglers should expect plenty of action on this classis bass/panfish lake.   <br> \n <br> \nSpring night-time electrofishing sampled moderate numbers (47) of Largemouth Bass for a catch rate of 51.5/hour, which was the highest ever recorded at Union Lake.  Historical catch rates from 1992 to 2017 (n=6) ranged from 2.0 to 51.5/hour with an average of 23.1.  Electrofished Largemouth Bass were 3.3 to 20.1 inches long with an average of 11.1.  Approximately 21% of the electrofishing sample was 15 inches or longer.  Trap nets sampled high numbers (21) of Largemouth Bass for a catch rate of 2.3/net, which was well above what might be expected for this type of lake.  The size distributions indicated that multiple ages were present and that a quality population was present.  Bass could expect good action from small and medium sized fish, plus the outside chance at a trophy as well.  <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled moderate numbers (26) of Northern Pike for a catch rate of 6.5/net, which was within what might be expected for this type of lake.  The 2012 catch rate was 10.0/net.  Historical catch rates from 1972 to 2017 (n=14) were variable ranging from 0.0 to 17.0/net with an average of 4.8.  Gill netted Northern Pike were 18.7 to 32.5 inches long with an average of 23.7.  Approximately 44% of the gill net sample was 24 inches or longer.  Trap nets sampled fish up to 34.7 inches in length, indicating that quality sized fish were present.  Size distributions indicated that multiple ages were present.  Northern Pike were last stocked in 1992, indicating that the current population was the result of natural reproduction.  Pike anglers should expect good action and a rare chance for a big fish as well.  <br> \n <br> \nTrap nets sampled moderate numbers (101) of Black Crappie for a catch rate of 11.2/net, which was within what might be expected for this lake type.  The 2012 catch rate was 15.0/net.  Historic catch rates from 1972 to 2017 (n=14) were variable ranging from 0.0 to 42.3/net with an average of 11.6.  Trap netted Black Crappie were 3.8 to 11.3 inches long with an average of 7.6.  Approximately 59% of the trap net sampled was 8 inches or longer.  Gill nets also sampled moderate numbers (42) of Black Crappie for a catch rate of 10.5/net, which was within what might be expected for this lake type.  The 2012 gill net catch rate was 5.7/net.  Historic gill net catch rates (n=14) were variable, ranging from 0.0 to 42.0/net with an average of 7.3.  In 2017, gill netted fish were 4.3 to 12.1 inches long with an average of 8.1.  Approximately 67% of the trap net sample was 8 inches or longer, and 21% were 10 inches or longer.  Size distributions indicated that multiple ages were present and that a quality population existed.  Crappie anglers often do well fishing the edge of the cattails in the spring. <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled low numbers (3) of Walleye for a catch rate of 0.8/net, which was below what might be expected for this lake type.  The 2012 catch rate was very similar at 0.7/net.  Historic catch rates from 1972 to 2017 (n=14) were all low, ranging from 0.0 to 3.0/net with an average of 0.6.  Walleye were only stocked by Minnesota DNR three times (1985, 1987, and 1989) during the last 45 years. Walleye sampled in this survey were likely the result of river immigrants during high water or illegal unpermitted stocking efforts; carryover natural reproduction to sustain the population since ceasing stocking is unlikely.  In the early 1990's it was decided to manage Union as a bass/panfish type lake.  In 2017, the gill netted Walleye were 21.9 to 26.1 inches long with an average of 23.9. Anglers targeting walleye are advised to try other nearby water such as Big Swan or Collinwood. <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled low numbers (1) of Channel Catfish for a catch rate of 0.3/net, which was the highest ever recorded at Union Lake.  This indicated that there was likely not a very good connection to Scott Lake and the Clearwater River system.  All other historic catch rates (1972 to 2012) were 0.0/net.  In 2017, the gill netted Channel Catfish was 19.3 inches long.  The only other year that Channel Catfish were gill or trap netted was 1997 (4 fish in the trap nets).  Channel Catfish were never stocked into Union Lake and likely are present from illegal unpermitted stocking efforts or from a short window of opportunity during high flows and a connection to the Clearwater River. <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled low numbers (10) of Yellow Perch for a catch rate of 2.5/net, which was within what might be expected for this lake type.  The 2012 catch rate was also low (1.0/net).  Historic catch rates from 1972 to 2017 (n=14) were variable, ranging from 0.0 to 42.3/net with an average of 9.9.  In 2017, Yellow Perch were 5.8 to 7.3 inches long with an average of 6.2.   <br> \n <br> \nGill nets did not sample Common Carp in 2017.  Historic gill net catch rates (n=14) from 1972 to 2017 were all low, ranging from 0.0 to 0.3/net with an average of 0.0.  Trap nets sampled low numbers (1) of Common Carp for a catch rate of 0.1/net, which was below the lake's normal range.  Historic trap net catch rates (n=14) ranged from 0.0 to 2.0/net with an average of 0.5.  The 2017 Common Carp was 14.1 inches long.  Historic low catches could indicate a poor connection to Scott Lake and the Clearwater River system.  Moderate to high numbers of Bluegill, over the years, were likely efficient predators on Common Carp eggs, further limiting their abundance in Union Lake.     <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled low numbers (8) of Black Bullhead for a catch rate of 2.0/net, which was below what might be expected for this type of lake.  Historic catch rates from 1972 to 2017 (n=14) ranged from 0.0 to 34.5/net with an average of 6.0.  Gill netted Black Bullhead were 7.8 to 12.7 inches long with an average of 11.6.  Trap nets also sampled low numbers (1) of Black Bullhead in 2017.   <br> \n <br> \nTrap nets sampled low numbers (14) of Yellow Bullhead for a catch rate of 1.6/net, which was within what might be expected for this lake type.  Historic catch rates (n=14) ranged from 0.0 to 27.7/net with an average of 6.1.  Gill nets also sampled low (5) numbers of Yellow Bullhead in 2017. <br> \n <br> \nAdditional species sampled in the standard gear included Bowfin, Brown Bullhead, Golden Shiner, Hybrid Sunfish, Pumpkinseed Sunfish, and White Sucker. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>STATUS OF THE FISHERY:\nNet catch data was compared to similar lakes (lake class 30) around the state.  Important species sampled in the gillnets were northern pike, yellow perch and walleye.  The northern pike catch of 4/net was very near the lake class median (4.5/net).  Growth appeared to be good.  Most of the northern pike (75%) were age 2 fish ranging in length from 17 to 27 inches.  Most of these would be an acceptable size to anglers.  Past surveys indicate that northern pike abundance has been relatively stable.  A yellow perch catch rate of 8.3/net was within the normal range for the lake class.  Nearly all of the perch sampled were age 2 and 3.  These were not large enough fish to attract most anglers.  Yellow perch numbers in Union Lake have usually been within or above the normal range for this type of lake.  The walleye catch of 0.8/net was slightly below the lake class median level (1.0/net).  Past lake management plans called for alternate year walleye fingerling stocking to provide a low level walleye population.   \n \nImportant fish species sampled in the trapnets included black bullhead, yellow bullhead, bluegill and black crappie.  Black bullhead numbers were slightly below the median (5.8/net) and ranged in size from 8 to 11 inches.  A yellow bullhead catch of 7/trapnet was above the normal range for this lake class.  Yellow bullheads ranged in size from 7.5 to 13 inches in length.  The sizes of black and yellow bullhead sampled this year should be acceptable to anglers.  Bluegill numbers sampled in trapnets (146/net) were well above the normal range for this type of lake.  Along with high numbers of bluegill, the size structure of the bluegill sampled was quite good.  Approximately 30% of the sample were age 2 bluegill ranging in size from 4 to 6.9 inches long.  Another 20% were age 3 fish that ranged from 5 to 7.9 inches long.  Nearly 50% of the sample were age 4 fish that were 6.5 to 8.9 inches long.  Past surveys indicate that Union Lake has had good bluegill populations, in regard to abundance and size.  Black crappie numbers (3.3/trapnet) were slightly below the lake class median (5.3/net).  Nearly 80% of the black crappie were age 3 and 4 fish.  Fish from these two age classes ranged in size from 7 to 9.4 inches long.  This was the second lowest trapnet catch recorded form black crappie in Union Lake (the lowest being 1.8/net in 1989) and numbers appear to have been steadily declining since the early 1980's.  Nighttime electrofishing targeting largemouth bass was conducted on 5/13/92.  Only nine largemouth bass were captured for a catch per hour of 8.2 fish.  This was one of the lower catch rates for all lakes sampled by electrofishing in the Hutchinson Area in 1992.  Most of the bass were age 3 and 4 fish that ranged in length from 9.5 to 11.4 inches.  One age 5 bass, that was 17 inches long, was also sampled.  Further assessment of the largemouth bass population is needed on Union Lake.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>STATUS OF THE FISHERY:\nNumber of northern pike are below state, regional, and local medians.  The gill net catch rate has decreased since 1984.  A stocking of 2500 fingerlings in 1988 did not increase numbers of northern pike, as represented by 1989 netting results.  Low water levels and inadequate spawning areas have possibly limited natural reproduction.  The failure of the 1988 fingerling stocking may point to other problems.  Walleye numbers, at 1.3 fish/gill net lift, are approaching the 2 fish/gill net lift goal of the management plan.  A majority of the fish are 15.0\" to 21.9\", with an average weight of 2.1 pounds.  The walleye population is maintained by alternate-year fingerling stocking.  Numbers of young-of-the-year largemouth bass indicate fair natural reproduction for 1989.  Gill net and trap net data did not allow for analysis of bass population numbers, growth, or age structure.  Bluegill numbers are well above state, regional, and local medians.  Dominant age groups are 1 and 2.  Growth is fast for age group 1, while growth was average for age groups 2, 3, 4, and 5.  Black crappie numbers are below state, regional, and local medians.  The dominant age group is 1.  Growth is fast for age group 1, while growth is average for age groups 2 and 3.  Numbers of crappie/trap net set have steadily declined since 1984.  History of spawning success has been good except for 1984 and 1989.  The populations of bowfin, carp and white sucker have held steady during the past 10 years.  The yellow bullhead is the dominant bullhead species, and numbers are above state and local medians.  Black bullhead numbers are low, and fish/trap net set have remained relatively constant since 1982.    </p>",

The northern pike and yellow perch populations are somewhat low at 2.0 and 5.0/gillnet, respectively.  No walleye were captured.  Crappie and bluegill were abundant: black crappies were captured at a rate of 40.6/trapnet and bluegills at 38.8/trapnet.  Growth for both species is average.  There have been complaints about the large carp population, but this was not reflected in net catches.  Black bullheads were captured at 10.2/trapnet, similar to area levels.  </p>",

Other game species contributing to the fishery include northern pike at 2.7/gillnet, yellow perch at 19.2/gillnet, black crappies at 6.3/trapnet, pumpkinseed at 12.5/trapnet and largemouth bass at 0.5/trapnet.  Due to public interest, a small walleye population has been established through alternate year stocking of walleye fingerlings.  At this survey, walleye were netted at 0.3/gillnet lift.\n\n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Union Lake is an 88 acre lake located in northeast Meeker County and northwest Wright County.  A lake population assessment conducted on Union Lake during the week of July 30, 2002 sampled 12 species of fish using gill nets and trap nets.  Union Lake is managed for largemouth bass, bluegill and northern pike.Assessment netting indicated that good numbers of northern pike and black crappie were present and should provide good fishing opportunities.  Northern pike ranged from 15 to 26 inches with an average length of 21 inches.  Pike averaged 2.3 pounds apiece.  Black crappie were 4 to 10 inches averageing 7.2 inches apiece.  Black crappie average weight was just under 0.25 pounds each.  Bluegill were abundant, but small.  Some keeper sized bluegills were sampled, but you'll probably need to do some sorting.  Spring electrofishing, targeting largemouth bass, was not conducted in 2002.  The lake is scheduled to be electrofished in 2003.  Two other species of interest to anglers were walleye and channel catfish.  Few walleye were sampled, but average size was large (2.8 pounds).  Walleye were last stocked in 1989, indicating that the current population is probably a result of natural reproduction.  Only one channel catfish was sampled at 27.2 inches (8.7 pounds).The outlet of Union Lake is connected to the Clearwater River.  The lakes water level tends to fluctuate rapidly during periods of extened heavy parcipitation, as was the case in 2002.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Union Lake, Wright County, is an 88.6 acre lake with a maximum depth of 35 feet. A lake survey conducted in 1997 sampled 14 species of fish.  Union Lake may bedescribed as a hard-water lake of good fertility and moderate water quality.  Waterclarity as measured by secchi disk depth ranges from 3.5 to 5.9 feet in mid summer. Adequate dissolved oxygen was sampled to a depth of 13 feet.  It has a lowdiversity of aquatic plants growing in sparse beds in several areas of thelake.Union Lake is managed primarily as a bluegill and largemouth bass fishery. Northern pike from area spawning areas were stocked into Union Lake as fingerlingsin 1986, 1988, 1990 and 1992.  Samples of the fish population were taken in midsummer using gill nets and trap nets.  Game fish catches were generally as expected for this type of lake.Catch rates of panfish were below average, but within the normal range for lakesof this type.  Trapnets sampled 125 bluegills, ranging in size from 4.5 to 9inches, with an average size of 6.7 inches.  Of the adult bluegill sampled, 76.8%were 6 inches or larger, with 23.2% being 8 inches or larger.  Catch rates forblack crappies were 0.5 per gillnet lift and 3.2 per trapnet set.  Crappies rangedin size from 4 to 12 inches, averaging about 7.2 inches.  Of adult crappiessampled, 65.4% were at least 8 inches, and 4% were at least 10 inches in length.The gillnet catch rate for northern pike was 5.3 per lift, above average but withinthe normal range for a lake of this type.  This was about the same as the previoussurvey in 1992, and better than most past catches.  Trapnets sampled 7 northernpike, for a catch rate of 0.8 per set.  This type of gear rarely samples manynorthern pike.  Pike ranged in size from 12 to 34 inches, averaging about 18inches.  Of adult northern pike, 62.9% were greater than 21 inches long, and 14.8%were greater than 28 inches.  Walleye were sampled at the rate of 3 per gillnetlift, slightly below average but within the normal range.  Trapnets sampled walleyeat 1.1 per set, above average but again within the normal limits.  Walleye rangedin size from 10 to 26 inches, and averaged about 18.3 inches.  Of adult walleyessampled, 86.4% were over 15 inches, with 22.7% of adults over 20 inches in length.Yellow bullheads were abundant in Union Lake.  Gillnets sampled 2.5 per gillnetlift, while trapnets sampled 8.3 per set.  Both catch rates are within the normalrange for lakes of this type, and appear to be consistent with previous surveys. Yellow bullheads ranged in length from 7.5 to 14 inches, averaging about 10 inches. Nearly 1/3 of the trapnet catch was 12 to 13 inches long.Union Lake was sampled for largemouth bass by night electrofishing. Two bass werecaught, for a catch rate of 2 per hour.  Bass collected measured 19 and 21 inches.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Union is a small-sized lake (93 acres) located southwest of the City of South Haven in Wright County. Union has 1.5 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 35 feet. A state-owned public access with a cement boat ramp and a very small amount of parking is present on the south shore. Water clarity is typically fair to moderate and submergent vegetation is often sparse to moderate in abundance at Union. A spring trap netting survey was conducted during May 2022. Trap nets were used to target Bluegill and Black crappie. Spring trap net data should not be compared to historical summer trap net data, as summer nets often do a poor job of representatively sampling Bluegill. <br> \n <br> \nHigh numbers of Bluegill were collected and fish were 3 to 8 inches long, averaging 6 inches. Approximately 38% of the sample was 7 inches or longer, indicating that a good proportion of the fish sampled were keeper-sized. Bluegill were age-2 to age-11 with ten year classes being present.  <br> \n <br> \nModerate numbers of Black Crappie were collected, averaging almost 8 inches in length. The longest crappie collected was just over 12 inches in length. Black Crappie were age-1 to age-11 with ten year classes being present.  <br> \n <br> \nModerate numbers of Pumpkinseed Sunfish were captured, averaging just over 5 inches in length. The longest Pumpkinseed Sunfish collected was just over 7 inches long. Pumpkinseed Sunfish were age-3 to age-8 with six year classes being present.  <br> \n <br> \nPeople can have significant impacts on lakes and the fish populations they support. Over harvest, lakeshore development, removal of shoreline vegetation, and introductions of invasive species can all adversely affect fish populations. Aquatic invasive species (AIS) are typically moved from infested to non-infested waters by anglers, boaters and lakeshore owners, and can adversely impact lakes and fish populations. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants and animals from their watercraft and drain all lake water from their boat and bait buckets before leaving the lake. If you suspect an infestation of an invasive species in this lake, save a specimen and report it to a local DNR office.  Additional information on all of these topics can be found on the DNR website (www.dnr.state.mn.us) or by contacting the Hutchinson Area Fisheries office.</p>",
