                "narrative": "<p>South Sturgeon Lake is a 192 acre lake located 14 miles northwest of Chisholm, MN in the Littlefork River watershed.  South Sturgeon is in lake class 20.  Lake class 20 lakes are relatively small, deep lakes with low alkalinity and productivity.  Other area lakes in this class are Scooty and Snaptail Lakes.  South Sturgeon is one of five lakes in the Sturgeon chain of lakes and has dark, bog-stained water.  There is a public access at the southwest corner of the lake.Net catches in South Sturgeon Lake have historically been low for most species.  Gill-net catches for northern pike have been below the normal range in all surveys, but the average size has been good.  The northern pike gill-net catch was 0.7/net in 2002.  Fish ranged from 23.3 to 37.9 inches with an average length of 31.7 inches and an average weight of 8.1 pounds.Walleye abundance has been low in all assessments.  The record high gill-net catch of 2.2/net occurred in the 1955 survey.  Walleye gill-net abundance has not exceeded the lake class median of 0.5/net in any survey since then.  The walleye gill-net catch in the 2002 assessment was at the low end of the normal range, at 0.3/net.  Walleye stocking over the years has included fry, frylings and fingerlings at varying rates and frequencies.  These stocking efforts have not resulted in any appreciable increase in walleye abundance.  South Sturgeon Lake's low fertility and low perch abundance likely contribute to low walleye abundance.Gill-net catches of yellow perch have been low in all assessments, never exceeding 2.7/net (lake class median = 6.2/net).  The 2002 gill-net catch was 0.8/net, below the normal range and the lowest since 1975.  Tullibee appeared to be moderately abundant in South Sturgeon Lake.  The 2002 tullibee gill-net catch was 4.8/net, within the normal range and similar to the previous assessment.  Gill-net sampled tullibee had an average length of 10.4 inches.  Tullibee likely serve as an important prey base for the large northern pike in South Sturgeon.Bluegill abundance has historically been low.  The bluegill trap-net catch was 3.3/net in 2002.  Bluegill ranged from 3.0 to 9.1 inches, with a mean length of 5.2 inches.Trap-net catches of black crappie have been within the normal range in most assessments.  The trap-net catch was 2.4/net in 2002, near the lake class median of 2.6/net.  Size structure of black crappie was fair in 2002.  Trap-net sampled crappie ranged in length from 3.7 to 11.2 inches, with an average length of 7.3 inches.  Age and growth analysis revealed ages 1 and 3-7 were represented, indicating consistent natural reproduction.  Growth rates were near the statewide average for all ages.Other species sampled in the latest assessment included: largemouth bass, hybrid sunfish, pumpkinseed sunfish, rock bass, shorthead redhorse, silver redhorse and white sucker. In order to maintain or improve fish and wildlife populations, water quality and habitat must be protected.  People often associate water quality problems with large-scale agricultural, forestry, urban development or industrial practices in the watershed.  In reality, the impact of land use decisions on one lake lot may seem relatively small, yet the combined effects of many lakeshore owners \"fixing up\" their property can result in a significant decline in water quality and habitat.  For example, removing shoreline and aquatic vegetation, installing sand beach blankets, fertilizing lawns, mowing to the waters edge, uncontrolled run-off and failing septic systems all contribute excess nutrients and sediment which degrade water quality and habitat.  Understanding these cumulative impacts and taking steps to avoid or minimize them will help to insure our quality fisheries can be enjoyed by future generations.

                "narrative": "<p>A gillnet CPUE of 0.2/lift is well below the first quartile (0.5/lift) for walleye of this ecological lake class.  According to test net indices, it appears that low walleye abundances persist despite 35 years of intermittent fry and fingerling stocking.  However, people do report catching walleyes in South Sturgeon Lake and in Little Sturgeon Lake.  South Sturgeon Lake may act as a nursery area for stocked walleyes with the majority of these fish emigrating into the Sturgeon River chain of lakes.A gillnet CPUE of 1.0/lift falls below the first quartile (2.0/lift) for northern pike of this ecological lake class.  Records indicated low northern pike abundances over the past 35 years.  Sporadic spawning success and an inadequate forage base, for small to medium northern pike, may be limiting this population.  However, northern pike of larger size exhibited good growth.  This appears to be a response to the tullibee forage base.A gillnet CPUE of 18.0/lift exceeds the third quaritle (13.4/lift) for tullibee of ecological lake class #20.  The median length of 90 tullibee sampled was 12.0 inches.  A tullibee forage base of this quality has the potential to produce trophy walleyes and northern pike.Yellow perch abundance has been and remains at a relatively low level.  A gillnet CPUE of 2.2/lift is slightly above the first quartile (1.6/lift) for this species.  A median length of 5.5 inches was calculated for yellow perch.A trapnet CPUE of 8.0/lift is the highest ever recorded for bluegill in South Sturgeon Lake.  Six age classes were identified.  Ages III and IV were the most abundant making up 40% and 22% of the sample, respectively.  Bluegills sampled exhibited slow growth.Trapnet CPUE for black crappie (4.0/lift) was at the third quartile value for ecological lake class #20.  Five age classes of crappies were identified with ages II, III and IV making up 89% of the sample.  Growth rates of crappies corresponed closely with state averages.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lakes like Little Sturgeon typically support modest panfish and northern pike populations and an occasional walleye.  The walleye gill net catch rate in this assessment, although higher than in any past asssessments, is still below the expected range for this type of lake.  Because walleye produced in Sturgeon Pond have been stocked for years, it is impossible to determine if the walleye in the lake are the result of this stocking, natural reproduction or fingerling stocking in other lakes in the chain.     Although the northern pike gill net catch rate is also the highest on record, it too is below the expected range.  Although the average size is not large (mean length = 19.9 inches), Little Sturgeon is known for producing some large northerns.  A 39.5 inch long northern pike was captured in this assessment.     Yellow perch, which, along with tullibee, are an important forage for walleye and northern pike, do not appear to be very abundant.  The perch sampled in gill nets ranged from 5.2 to 7.2 inches in length.     Black crappie were sampled in the trap nets at a rate within the expected range for this type of lake.  These fish ranged from 7.3 to 10.7 inches in length.     Tullibee were sampled at a rate within the expected range.  Tullibee abundance has been high in a few assessments, perhaps because of the connection to other lakes in the chain, and likely explains the presence of the larger northern pike that this lake is known to produce.  Approximately one third of the tullibee examined were infested with triaenophorus.     Although no largemouth bass were sampled in the test nets, some young-of-year bass were sampled while seining.  Other fish species sampled include; white sucker, brown bullhead, rock bass, pumpkinseed sunfish and golden redhorse.     As on any lake, lakeshore owners and users have the ability to preserve water quality and help preserve the fishery by preserving habitat and practicing wise use of the lakeshore and surrounding watershed. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>South Sturgeon Lake is a small, infertile lake located about 15 miles northwest of Chisholm, Minnesota.  There is a public access on the southwest side of the lake.  Small, accessible, infertile lakes like South Sturgeon often do not have the ability to produce high quality fisheries and are vulnerable to angling overharvest.  An attribute of infertile lakes is that fish tend to grow slowly even though their numbers are low.  The 2003 lake management plan (LMP) indicates Black Crappie and Northern Pike as the primary species of management with Bluegill as a secondary species.  The LMP goals were established based on prior netting data.  A standard survey was conducted in July of 2016 to assess the status of the fish community. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie numbers have fluctuated like all populations do but have been typical for the lake type.  The 2016 trap-net catch of 2.9 fish/net approached the LMP goal of 3.0/net.  The trap-net sampled fish ranged from 3.6 to 11.0 inches and averaged 6.8 inches.  The sampling of five age-classes suggest fairly consistent reproduction had occurred.  Growth was somewhat slower than other lakes with similar habitat.  Fish averaged 8.1 inches after five years.  Black Crappie may provide decent fishing opportunities following periods of good natural reproduction. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike gill-net catch rates have been low in all surveys.  No Northern Pike were sampled by gill nets in 2016 so the LMP goal was not attained.  However, six Northern Pike were sampled by trap nets and these fish ranged from 14.4 to 26.5 inches and averaged 20.1 inches.  Anglers may want to consider releasing pike because the population appears to be quite low.  <br> \n <br> \nBluegill catches have been low compared to other lakes with similar habitat.  The 2016 catch of 5.5 fish/trap net was typical for the lake.  The sampled fish ranged from 3.4 to 9.5 inches and averaged 6.3 inches.  Consistent natural reproduction was noted based on the nine age-classes sampled.  Growth was slow to average compared to other lakes with similar habitat and on average it required five years of growth to attain 5.2 inches.  The oldest fish were estimated to be 11 years old.  The Bluegill population in South Sturgeon may provide some angling opportunities at times, but could only sustain light or modest angling pressure and harvest due to low lake productivity. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye catches have always been low in South Sturgeon, which is typical for the lake type.  The highest catch occurred in 1955 but the catches have never been close to that level again despite frequent stockings.  Only two Walleye were sampled by gill nets in each of the last two surveys.  Low lake productivity in conjunction with an inadequate prey base likely limits Walleye. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch catches have been low in all surveys since 1955 and the 2016 catch equaled the lowest on record.  The three sampled Yellow Perch ranged from 5.9 to 7.7 inches and averaged 6.5 inches.  Yellow Perch are not likely providing much fishing opportunities or prey for predators due to their poor size structure and low numbers. <br> \n</p>",
