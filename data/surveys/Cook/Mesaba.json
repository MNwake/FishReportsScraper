There are three portage trails that access the lake. The lake is about seven miles into the BWCAW and requires several arduous portages to get there. The lake is managed for Lake Trout and Northern Pike. Lake Trout were first stocked into the lake in 1977, and again in 2000, 2001, and 2002 in an attempt to create a self-sustaining population. <br> \n <br> \nThe 2022 Lake Trout catch of 8/lift exceeded the normal range for the type of lake. The average weight was near three pounds, which is in the normal range for similar lakes. Fish ranged from 9 to 26.3 inches long, which confirmed that there are multiple years of naturally reproduced fish in the lake. One fish that was 25.4 inches long was identified as being stocked in 2002. <br> \n <br> \nOne Northern Pike was sampled that was 26.6 inches long and weighed nearly four pounds. The only net that sampled a Northern Pike was set in water no deeper than 15 feet. All other nets were set in deeper water targeting Lake Trout habitat and would be expected to have low catch. <br> \n <br> \nWhite Sucker were sampled in above average numbers, with average weight of 1.8 pounds. Green Sunfish were also sampled. <br> \n <br> \nThe results suggest that the Lake Trout are reproducing and maintaining a population that can provide angler harvest. While Northern Pike are present, their numbers appear to be low, but can provide an additional option for anglers.</p>",

Test nets in 1993 sampled only one Lake Trout, a large individual weighing 8.8 lbs. Angler harvest of Lake Trout is expected to be low and probably will remain so until the stocks are increased thru stocking.     Northern Pike are the only other gamefish in Mesaba Lake and are present in average numbers. Angling for Northern Pike may not be highly successful as much of the lake is deep and drops off fast. Shallow weedy areas which normally hold Northern Pike are scarce. The fish taken in test nets average 2.5 lbs with sizes ranging from 18\" to 27\".</p>",
