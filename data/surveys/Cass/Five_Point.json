                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of nearshore fish species in Five Point Lake was conducted on July 23, 2019 by Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program Staff.  Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot seine, where possible.  Backpack electrofishing was completed at all ten sampling stations, but four stations were sampled from the boat due to site conditions.  Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample six stations and site conditions prevented the use of seines at four stations.  Nearshore sampling captured 15 species of fish including five species that are intolerant of disturbance (i.e., Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, and Rock Bass) and no species that are tolerant of disturbance. <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore data were combined with trap net and gill net data from a June 2019 survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based IBI (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment.  In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g., Blackchin Shiner, Iowa Darter, and Rock Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g., Green Sunfish).  The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake.  For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.   <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey indicates Five Point Lake is healthy as indicated by an exceptionally high FIBI score, well above the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes.  Data from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Pine River Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Five Point Lake (Four Point Lake) (DOW#11-351, Lake Class 31) is a 219-acre lake located near Hackensack, MN.  There is a state-owned public access on the west shore.  Five Point Lake has 3.82 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 37 ft.  The DNR has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different classes based on physical, chemical and other characteristics.  Five Point Lake is in Lake Class 31.  Lakes in this class are generally clear, moderately productive, and moderately deep.  Other local waters in this classification include Bowen, Child and Widow.  The lake is primarily managed for Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, and Walleye, and secondarily for Bluegill, Black Crappie, Yellow Perch, and Tullibee (Cisco).   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike in Five Point Lake are very abundant and sizes tend to be small with most pike between 15 to 21 inches; fish up to 35 inches were sampled. Anglers are encouraged to harvest the abundant Northern Pike less than 22 inches.  <br> \nLargemouth Bass are moderately abundant but no targeted sampling occurred during this survey. Walleye, Tullibee (Cisco), and Yellow Perch are present but abundance is low. Walleye abundance was below the management goal of two fish per gillnet despite fry or fingerlings stocked nearly annually since 2013. Walleye lengths ranged from 18 to 27 inches with an average length of 22 inches. Abundant  <br> \nNorthern Pike and low Yellow Perch populations may be limiting Walleye stocking success. Bluegill abundance is low with 47 percent of the sample measuring 7 inches or longer and Black Crappie are moderately abundant with fish up to 13 inches present.  <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species that anglers can expect to encounter include, Bowfin (Dogfish), Brown Bullhead, Yellow Bullhead, Pumpkinseed Sunfish and Rock Bass. <br> \n <br> \nPeople can have significant impacts on lakes and the fish populations they support. Harvest, lakeshore development, removal of shoreline vegetation, and introductions of invasive species can all adversely affect fish populations. Currently, no aquatic invasive species (AIS) have been identified in Five Point Lake. AIS are moved from infested to non-infested waters by anglers, boaters, and lake shore owners and can adversely impact lakes and fish populations. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access. If you suspect an infestation of an invasive species in this lake, save a specimen and report it to a local natural resource office. Additional information on all of these topics can be found on the DNR website (www.dnr.state.mn.us) or by contacting the Walker Area Fisheries office. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Five Point Lake is a 219-acre lake located four miles southeast of Hackensack, MN.  A public access is located on the west shore.  The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MNDNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different classes based on physical, chemical and other characteristics.  Five Point Lake is in Lake Class 31; lakes in this class generally are hard water lakes with regular shorelines. This lake is managed primarily for northern pike, largemouth bass and walleye, and secondarily for bluegill, black crappie, yellow perch, and cisco (tullibee).  Walleye numbers have been consistent with historical catches for Five Point Lake.  Walleye sampled in 2003 ranged from 9 to 26 inches.  Based upon information from the 2003 assessment and previous assessments, walleye natural reproduction has occurred in Five Point Lake.  Northern pike were abundant, with an average length of 23 inches, and fish up to 28 inches were sampled.  Five Point Lake has a good population of largemouth bass, and fish up to 16 inches were sampled.  Bluegill abundance in Five Point Lake was similar to other Lake Class 31 lakes, however most bluegill were small with an average size of 5 inches. Fish up to 8 inches were caught during 2003 sampling.  Five Point Lake also has a good population of black crappie available for anglers and fish up to 12 inches were found. Yellow perch were abundant during the 2003 sampling, however most were small (average length 6 inches and maximum length 8 inches). Other fish species sampled during this population assessment include bowfin (dogfish), brown bullhead, pumpkinseed sunfish, rock bass, cisco (tullibee), white sucker, and yellow bullhead.  Anglers can help maintain or improve the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for table fare, but encourages release of medium- to large-sized fish.  Releasing these fish can help maintain balance in the fish community in Five Point Lake and provide anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future.  Shoreline areas on the land and into the shallow water provide essential habitat for fish and wildlife that live in or near Minnesota's lakes.  Overdeveloped shorelines can't support the fish, wildlife, and clean water that are associated with natural undeveloped lakes. The combined effects of all lakeshore owners \"fixing up\" their property can destroy a lake's valuable natural shorelines.Shoreline habitat consists of aquatic plants, woody plants and natural lake bottom soils.Plants in the water and at the water's edge provide habitat, prevent erosion and absorb excess nutrients. Shrubs, trees, and woody debris such as fallen trees or limbs provide good habitat both above and below the water and should be left in place.  Natural lake bottom materials like silt or gravel are more ecologically productive than pure sand trucked in for a swimming beach.  A tidy lawn and a sandy beach make great spots for sunbathing and swimming but do little to provide habitat for fish and wildlife. By leaving a buffer strip of natural vegetation along the shoreline, property owners can reduce erosion, help maintain water quality, and provide habitat and travel corridors for wildlife.Only if more lakeshore owners manage their shoreline in a natural condition can fish and wildlife populations on Minnesota lakes remain healthy and abundant.  More specific information on protecting or restoring shorelines and watersheds is available through the local DNR Fisheries office.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Status of the Fishery, Five Point Lake (11-351)Minnesota lakes have been classified into 44 classifications based on a number of physical and chemical factors.Five Point Lake belongs to Lake Class 31. Other area lakes in this classification include: Sanburn Lake (fourmiles south of Five Point),  May Lake (15 miles northwest), and Widow Lake (six miles northeast of Five Point.Game fish species caught in the 1993 assessment include  walleye, northern pike, largemouth bass, black crappie,bluegill, pumpkinseed, rock bass, and yellow perch. The catch rate of walleye in test nets in 1993 was similar to other lakes in this class. Walleye ranged from 12.0to 24.9 inches, and ageing information indicates that natural reproduction is occurring; walleye are present fromyears in which no stocking was done. Fewer northern pike were caught in test nets in Five Point than in most otherClass 31 lakes, but these northern pike had a good average size (4.1 pounds). Yellow perch were abundant butsmall: most were about 6 inches long. Five Point has an abundant bluegill population with some larger bluegillpresent. Fourteen percent of the measured bluegill were 7 inches or greater. Catches of pumpkinseed were withinthe middle range for this lake class. Largemouth bass ranging from 5 though 16 inches were sampled on Five Point,and growth rates on these fish appeared to be good. There appears to be an abundant population of black crappiein Five Point, though no crappies larger than 10 inches were sampled. Cisco (tullibee) are present in Five Point,and they can provide a valuable food source for gamefish such as walleye and northern pike.Other species sampled in the 1993 survey were bowfin (dogfish), brown bullhead, black bullhead, yellow bullhead,and white sucker.</p>",

NORTHERN PIKE UP TO 40 INCHES WERE PRESENT IN THE SAMPLE COLLECTED.  FAIR NUMBERS OF NORTHERN CISCO (6.8/GN) RANGING IN LENGTH FROM 8 TO 10 INCHES WERE SAMPLED.  THESE FISH WOULD PROVIDE EXCELLENT FORAGE FOR LARGER NORTHERN PIKE.  THE BLUEGILL TRAPNET CATCH (49.8/TN) IS SIMILAR TO CATCHES FROM PREVIOUS ASSESSMENTS (31.0 TO 47.2/TN).  FAIR NUMBERS GREATER THAN SEVEN INCHES IN LENGTH WERE COLLECTED.  FEW LARGEMOUTH BASS OR BLACK CRAPPIE WERE CAPTURED, PRESUMABLY DUE TO SAMPLING GEAR USED AND TIME OF YEAR.  MOST OF THE BLACK CRAPPIE SAMPLED WERE BETWEEN 10 AND 14 INCHES IN LENGTH.  THE YELLOW PERCH GILLNET CATCH OF 41.8/GN IS FAIRLY HIGH AND IS HIGHER THAN PREVIOUS CATCHES (RANGE FROM 6.0 TO 29.2).  THE WALLEYE GILLNET CATCH IS 5.8/GN WHICH INDICATES A FAIRLY ABUNDANT POPULATION FOR A LAKE SUCH AS FIVE POINT.  THERE WERE TWO SIZE GROUPS OF WALLEYE PRESENT - 8-11 AND 18-22 INCHES.  THE AGE GROUPS OF WALLEYE LESS THAN 5+ CORRELATE WITH WALLEYE FRY STOCKING.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted fish survey using several gears was conducted on Five Point Lake August 8-10, 2022 by Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program Staff. Nearshore sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at all ten sampling stations. Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample six stations, and a 15-foot seine was used to sample two stations due to difficult site conditions including deep drop offs with abundant lilies and wild rice along the shoreline. Two sites with dense lilies out to deep water were not seined. Nearshore sampling captured 17 species of fish including abundant numbers of five species that are intolerant of disturbance (i.e., Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, and Rock Bass) and a small number of Fathead Minnows, a species that is classified as tolerant of disturbance. <br> \n <br> \nA concurrent summer trap net survey was conducted by IBI Program Staff. Nine trap nets were set along the shoreline in locations that encompassed multiple habitat types. Bowfin, Bluegill, and Yellow Bullhead comprised a majority of the trap net catch by biomass, with Bluegill most abundant by number. The number of Bluegill sampled per net was below the 50% quartile for similar Lake Class 31 lakes and the average length was 5.5 inches, with 25% over 7 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore and trap net data were combined with gill net data from a June 2019 survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based IBI (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment. In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g., Blackchin Shiner, Iowa Darter, and Rock Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g., Common Carp and Green Sunfish). The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.   <br> \nData from this IBI survey indicates Five Point Lake supports a healthy fish community as indicated by an exceptionally high FIBI score, well above the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes. Data from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Pine River Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency. <br> \n <br> \nIn addition to the FIBI survey, a temperature-dissolved oxygen profile was collected in the deepest basin on Five Point Lake on August 8th, 2022, to evaluate the amount of cold, oxygenated water (i.e., oxythermal habitat) available to Cisco, also known as Tullibee. Based on the profile, the top of the thermocline (i.e., the location in the water column with the sharpest transition from warm to cold water) occurred between 17 - 19 feet. Dissolved oxygen decreased to below 3.0 mg/L by 19.7 feet at the time of sampling. The temperature at which dissolved oxygen decreased to below 3.0 mg/L (i.e., TDO3, a single variable to characterize oxythermal habitat) was 19.8?C (67.6?F). <br> \n <br> \nTDO3 values near 21.5?C indicate that oxythermal conditions are marginal for Cisco. Low dissolved oxygen concentrations (i.e., less than 3 mg/L) within and below the thermocline and warm surface temperatures would likely limit available Cisco habitat within the water column to an extent. When inadequate oxythermal habitat is available, Cisco are squeezed into unfavorable, warmer water conditions and experience higher levels of stress. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Five Point Lake is a 219-acre lake located southeast of Hackensack, Minnesota that has 3.82 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 37 ft. There is a state-owned public access on the west shore. The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MNDNR) has classified Minnesota lakes into 43 different classes based on physical, chemical and other characteristics.  Five Point Lake is in Lake Class 31; other nearby lakes in this class include Birch and Child.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike are abundant in Five Point Lake.  The average length of northern pike sampled in 2008 was 21 inches, and fish ranged from 14 to 33 inches. The abundance of northern pike compared favorably to other lakes in this class.  Largemouth bass are common in this lake and fish up to 18 inches were sampled.  Numbers of walleye in Five Point Lake in 2008 was similar to the number found in other lakes in this class.  Walleye from 14 to 29 inches were found in 2008.  The most recent walleye stockings into Five Point Lake have been fingerlings stocked by the lake association under permits issued by the DNR.  Bluegill abundance was similar to other lakes in this Lake Class, and has changed little during assessments over the past 16 years.  Average length of bluegill was about 6 inches, however fish up to about 8 inches were caught.  The catch of black crappie was lower than in most previous sampling, however fish that were caught ranged from 10 to 13 inches. Few yellow perch were sampled in 2008, and the maximum size of sample perch was 8 inches.  Other species available for anglers include bowfin (dogfish), brown bullhead, cisco (tullibee), hybrid sunfish, pumpkinseed sunfish, rock bass, white sucker, yellow bullhead, and yellow perch.  <br> \n <br> \nAnglers can help maintain or improve the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for table fare, but encourages release of medium- to large-sized fish.  Releasing these fish can help maintain balance in the fish community in Five Point Lake and provide anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future.   <br> \n <br> \nShoreline habitat consists of aquatic plants, woody plants and natural lake bottom soils. <br> \nPlants in the water and at the water\u0019s edge provide habitat, prevent erosion and absorb excess nutrients. Shrubs, trees, and woody debris such as fallen trees or limbs provide good habitat both above and below the water and should be left in place.  By leaving a buffer strip of natural vegetation along the shoreline, property owners can reduce erosion, help maintain water quality, and provide habitat and travel corridors for wildlife.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Five Point Lake (DOW#11-351, Lake Class 31) is a 251-acre lake located near Hackensack, MN. There is a state-owned public access on the west shore. Five Point Lake has 3.82 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 37 ft. The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MNDNR) has classified Minnesota lakes into 43 different classes based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics. Five Point Lake is in Lake Class 31; lakes in this class are regularly shaped, clear, and have hard water. The lake is primarily managed for Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, and Bluegill, and secondarily for, Black Crappie, Yellow Perch, Tullibee (Cisco) and Walleye. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike were highly abundant compared to other Class 31 lakes. Northern Pike average length was 23inches and fish up to 35 inches were sampled. Consistent reproduction for the past eight years should provide future opportunities for anglers targeting Northern Pike. Abundance of Bluegill is similar other lakes. Bluegill average length was 5.7 inches with fish up to 9 inches observed in the sample.  Moderate densities and large size structure should present good opportunities for anglers. Walleye were similar in abundance to previous surveys, and fish up to 29 inches were sampled with an average length of about 18 inches. A variety of age classes are present within the Walleye population that should maintain current angling opportunities.  Anglers may encounter other species such as Black Crappie, Bowfin (dogfish), Brown Bullhead, Hybrid Sunfish, Largemouth Bass, Pumpkinseed, Rock Bass, Tullibee (Cisco), White Sucker, Yellow Bullhead and Yellow Perch.  <br> \n <br> \nPeople can have significant impacts on lakes and the fish populations they support. Harvest, lakeshore development, removal of shoreline vegetation, and introductions of invasive species can all adversely affect fish populations. Currently no aquatic invasive species (AIS) have been identified in Five Point Lake. AIS are moved from infested to non-infested waters by anglers, boaters, and lake shore owners and can adversely impact lakes and fish populations. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access. If you suspect an infestation of an invasive species in this lake, save a specimen and report it to a local natural resource office. Additional information on all of these topics can be found on the DNR website (www.dnr.state.mn.us) or by contacting the Walker Area Fisheries office. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Five Point Lake is located in northern Cass County about 5 miles southeast of Hackensack.  Five Point has an area of 219 acres with about 40% of this area less than 15 feet deep.  The maximum depth of the lake is 37 feet. The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MDNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different lake classes based on physical and chemical characteristics, and Five Point is in lake class 31. Other nearby lakes in this same class include Child, Ox Yoke, and Sanburn.   With the exception of the public access on the west shore, the entire shoreline of Five Point is privately owned.  In 1998 there was one resort and 44 other lake homes on this lake.  Five Point Lake is managed primarily for northern pike, largemouth bass, and walleye, and secondarily for bluegill, black crappie, yellow perch, and tullibee (cisco).  Five Point has an abundant northern pike population.  Though most of the northerns were small, fish up to 34 inches were sampled in 1998. Anglers should find a good population of largemouth bass in Five Point.  The number of walleye found in the 1998 sampling was similar to other lakes in this class, and no walleye under 17 inches were found.  Five Point has some walleye natural reproduction and it is not stocked. Bluegill anglers have an opportunity for some good fishing on Five Point, both in terms of abundance and size.  Pumpkinseed sunfish are also available for sunfish anglers. The number of black crappie available in this lake compares favorably with other lakes of this type, and fish up to 12 inches are present.  Though yellow perch are abundant, all are under 8 inches.For many species, angling success for quality size fish has definitely declined statewide due to over harvest of large fish.  Anglers can help maintain or improve the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for table fare, but encourages release of medium- to large-size fish.  Releasing these fish will help maintain the fish population in Five Point and provides anglers with opportunities to catch more and larger fish in the future.  Large fish also help maintain balance in the fish community.Lake shore owners can help protect fish and wildlife habitat and water quality by keeping their shoreline in a natural condition.  Natural shorelines and shallow water areas with aquatic plants help protect the lakeshore from erosion and help absorb nutrients and pollutants.  Such areas also provide excellent places for fish and wildlife to feed, hide, and raise their young.  For example, Five Point Lake has an abundance of water lilies  around its shoreline, which provide habitat and need to be protected.  Shoreline owners who have questions about protecting aquatic plants or natural shorelines are encouraged to contact a MDNR Fisheries office for further information.  </p>",
