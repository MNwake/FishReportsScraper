If so, they would have entered the lake by downstream migration from Thrasher Lake, where splake have been regularly stocked.  Since fish were not identified (by counting pyloric caeca), it will be assumed for this discussion that all were brook trout.The trap net catch in this assessment was relatively low for stream trout lakes in this area, and it was estimated that the total population of age-1 or older fish in fall 1998 was only 114 fish.  Growth of stocked trout had been good; fish averaged 12.1 inches in length at the end of their second growing season.  Some trout over 20 inches were collected.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Brook trout were abundant in Bath Lake in the fall of 2013, and their average size was fairly high.  The brook trout trap net catch exceeded the catch goal established in the 2010 lake management plan for this lake (5.0 fish/net), and was above the normal range (1.0 - 5.8 fish/net) for stream trout lakes in this area.  The mean weight for brook trout collected in 2013 met the size goal from the 2010 plan (a minimum of 0.5 lb/fish), and was well within the normal range (0.4 - 1.2 lb/fish) for brook trout lakes in this area.  Results of this assessment suggest that the current stocking strategy for this lake has been effective.   Most of the brook trout collected were over 12 inches in length, and fish as large as 16 inches were taken.  Four year classes contributed to the catch, including a fairly high number of three-year-old fish from the 2010 fingerling stocking.  Growth may have been a little slow; fish reached an average length of 11.0 inches at the end of their third year, compared to an average of 12.5 inches in Grand Marais-area lakes. <br> \n <br> \nSplake taken in 2013 were migrants from Thrasher Lake, where they had been stocked annually for many years.  Splake have often been seen in Bath Lake, but their numbers have never been high.  They have, as was the case in 2013, often been larger than most of the brook trout present.  Splake collected in 2013 were three- and four-year-old fish, and their growth also appeared to have been slower than average.  Splake would have been competing with a dense brook trout population for available forage, perhaps resulting in slower growth for both species. <br> \n <br> \nNo competing warmwater species are known to be present in this lake.  Past assessments have collected only brook trout, splake, and pearl dace. <br> \n</p>",
