MEAN WEIGHT HAS DECREASED 48% SINCE 1985, ALTHOUGH IT REMAINS AVERAGE FOR LAKES WITHIN THE CLASSIFCATION.  GROWTH RATES ARE NORMAL FOR THE SEVERAL AGE CLASSES REPRESENTED. THE WALLEYE POPULATION ALSO SHOWS NO CHANGE SINCE 1985 AND REMAINS IN THE LOW RANGE. THE NET CATCH OF 0.50/SET FALLS BELOW THE FIRST QUARTILE OF 1.00/SET.  GROWTH RATES APPEAR NORMAL FOR THE TWO AGE GROUPS PRESENT (V, VI).  THERE WERE NO FISH CAPTURED DURING THIS ASSESSMENT ORIGINATING FROM THE ANNUAL FRY STOCKING WHICH BEGAN IN 1986.  POOR SURVIVAL, MIGRATION, OR SMALL SIZE ARE POSSIBLE REASONS STOCKED FISH DID NOT SHOW UP IN THE ASSESSMENT NETS.  SPRING ELECTROFISHING EFFORTS IN 1987 INDICATED THE PRESENCE OF YEARLING FISH THOUGH IT IS UNCERTAIN WHETHER THE FISH WERE NATURALLY PRODUCED OR STOCKED. YELLOW PERCH CATCHES SHOW AN INCREASE SINCE 1985, HOWEVER, THE POPULATION AND MEAN SIZE ARE CONSIDERED NORMAL FOR LAKES OF THIS CLASSIFICATION SEVERAL AGE GROUPS WERE EVIDENT FROM THE LENGTH FREQUENCY DATA. THE BLUEGILL NET CATCH HAS DECLINED 70% SINCE THE 1985 SURVEY.  THE POPULATION STILL FALLS WITHIN THE NORMAL RANGE AT 31.00/SET. YELLOW PERCH CATCHES SHOW AN INCREASE SINCE 1985.  HOWEVER, THE POPULATION AND MEAN SIZE ARE CONSIDERED NORMAL FOR LAKES OF THIS CLASSIFICATION SEVERAL AGE GROUPS WERE EVIDENT FROM THE LENGTH FREQUENCY DATA. THE BLUEGILL NET CATCH HAS DECLINED 70% SINCE THE 1985 SURVEY.  THE POPULATION STILL FALLS WITHIN THE NORMAL RANGE AT 31.00/SET.  AVERAGE SIZE IS SMALL (0.11 POUNDS IN TRAPNETS AND 0.23 POUNDS IN GILLNETS).  BLUEGILLS RANGED IN LENGTH FROM (3.0 TO 7.4 INCHES INDICATING SEVERAL AGE CLASSES EXIST. THE BLACK CRAPPIE POPULATION IS LOW AND HAS FALLEN 83% SINCE 1985.  AVERAGE WEIGHT HAS NOT CHANGED SINCE 1985 AND IS CONSIDERED SMALL AT 0.20 POUNDS.  THE LENGTH RANGE OF 4.0 TO 8.9 INCHES SUGGESTS THE PRESENCE OF MULTIPLE YEAR CLASSES. LARGEMOUTH BASS WERE NOT SAMPLED IN THE SELECT- IVE GEAR (TRAPNETS) IN 1985 AND 1990.  THIS IS NOT UNUSUAL AS TRAPNETS MAY FAIL TO SAMPLE BASS POPULATIONS ADEQUATELY.  YOUNG-OF-THE-YEAR WERE SAMPLED BY SEINING IN BOTH 1985 AND 1990. YEARLING AND ADULT FISH WERE ALSO CAPTURED BY SPRING ELECTROFISHING IN 1986 AND 1987 WHICH ESTABLISHES THE PRESENCE OF A REPRODUCING POPULATION.  FISHING REPORTS STATE THAT SOME LARGEMOUTH BASS ARE CAUGHT IN THE LAKE. OTHER SPECIES SAMPLED DURING THE ASSESSMENT INCLUDE: BOWFIN, WHITE SUCKER, GOLDEN REDHORSE, SHORTHEAD REDHORSE, ROCK BASS, PUMPKINSEED, AND ALL THREE BULLHEAD SPECIES.  YELLOW BULLHEAD AND PUMPKINSEED ARE FOUND IN HIGH NUMBERS ABOVE THE THIRD QUARTILE.  BOWFIN, WHITE SUCKER, ROCK BASS, AND BROWN BULLEHAD ARE FOUND IN NORMAL NUMBERS AND BLACK BULLHEAD OCCUR IN LOW NUMBERS. A COMMERCIAL FISHERMAN REMOVED 600 POUNDS OF BULLHEAD FROM THE LAKE IN 1990.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Sylvan Reservoir is a riverine lake formed at the confluence of the Crow Wing River and Gull River.  Most of the land around the main basin is owned by Minnesota Power and Light Company or is part of the Camp Ripley Military Reservation.  Most private development is on the Gull River.  Anglers have long used the bridge over the Gull River for fishing.  The east side of the lake south of the bridge was recently landscaped with large granite blocks to provide a fishing area for shore fishermen.  Anglers regularly seek panfish, northern pike, walleye, and largemouth bass in the reservoir as well as traveling upstream in the rivers.      Large deposit areas with lush vegetation are located in the middle of the reservoir and on the south side of where the Crow Wing River enters.  Water clarity is impacted by rain events and flows from the two major tributaries.  The Crow Wing River has typically contributed more sediment to the basin than the Gull River.  The secchi disk reading from the main basin was only 4 feet compared to 10 feet in the lake north of Fisherman's Bridge on the same day.    Bluegills are the most sought after species in the reservoir.  Abundance appears to be high with medium size fish between 5.5 to 7 inches being common.  Larger bluegills over 8 inches were seen in the survey.  While none of the pumpkinseeds exceeded 8 inches, medium size fish were also the most abundant.  The black crappies captured in the survey only averaged about 8 inches in length and abundance appears normal when compared to similar type lakes.    Little seems to have changed in the northern pike population as abundance and size structure of the population remained about the same as the previous survey.  Average weight of the pike was about 2 pounds and some larger fish over 30 inches were seen.  Sylvan historically has had a low population of walleye and the 2002 survey indicates that remains unchanged.  Walleye had been stocked regularly from 1986 until 1994 with apparently little success.  Natural reproduction now sustains the population.  Few largemouth bass were seen in the survey which is not unusual.  The bass that were caught, were mostly were under 10 inches long.  Some nice perch up to ten inches were netted, but most were under 8 inches in length.      Sylvan has a diverse roughfish community that is indicative of a riverine system.  White suckers, greater redhorse, silver redhorse, and shorthead redhorse were all sampled in the survey along with bowfin or dogfish, burbot, and the three species of bullheads.  Of the bullhead species, black, brown, and yellow, the yellow bullheads were the most numerous.  Most of the bullheads were nice size, over 10 inches in length, with some up to 14 inches seen.      Selective harvest is encouraged for both angling and spearing to minimize impact on the fish community.  Releasing larger northern pike and walleye and voluntarily limiting harvest of large panfish will help sustain the quality and balance of the fish community.  Impacts from dam operations to the reservoir should be minimized by timing repairs and durations of draw-downs.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Daytime electrofishing was performed on Sylvan Reservoir June 9, 2020.  Trap netting was planned for mid-June but could not be conducted due to activity restrictions and staff shortages resulting from the Covid-19 pandemic.  Largemouth Bass and Bluegill were targeted during this assessment and otoliths were extracted from these species for aging purposes.  Two electrofishing stations specifically targeted bass while a third station targeted Bluegill.  Few Black Crappie were observed and none were collected. <br> \n <br> \nThe bass catch was relatively low as few fish were shallow presumably due to post-spawn behavior.  A total of 33 Largemouth Bass were collected including some individuals netted in the third station which targeted Bluegill.  Bass were taken while targeting Bluegill to provide a larger sample size for length frequency and aging analysis.  The catch rate of Largemouth Bass was 22/hour.   Largemouth Bass ranged from 3.2 to 17.2 inches in length and average length was 9.68 inches.  Fish exceeding 12 inches accounted for 36% of the catch.   Fish exceeding 12 inches accounted for 36% of the catch.  Spring electrofishing catch rates for bass were higher in 2008 and 2014 at 60 per hour and 49 per hour, respectively.  The percentages of bass over 12 inches were 31% in 2008 and 29% in 2014.  <br> \n <br> \nAging showed normal growth rates and consistent reproduction with 11 year classes present up to age 19.  Age 2 and 3 fish made up over ? of the aged sample.  Seven (7) Smallmouth Bass were also captured and six of these fish were juveniles (<8 inches).  The largest Smallmouth Bass was 16.5 inches.  Smallmouth Bass were first documented in the reservoir in 2014 when five juveniles were captured during spring electrofishing. <br> \n <br> \n Large concentrations of spawning Bluegill were observed making electrofishing highly effective.  A sample of 253 Bluegill was collected in less than ? hour of effort producing a catch rate of 588/hour.    Bluegill ranged from 3 to 7.5 inches in length and average size was 5.91 inches.  Almost ? (48%) of the fish were between 6 and 7 inches and only 8% exceeded 7 inches.   Ages 2-7 and 9 were present in the aged sample with Age 5 fish comprising 59% of the catch.  Age and growth characteristics indicate the lake has limited capability of producing large numbers of quality Bluegill (8 inches).  Fish reached 6 inches in length by Age 5 but most 7-9 year old fish failed to exceed 7.5 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nWhile fishing for sunfish it is best to limit your harvest of the large individuals, especially the males.  The large males exhibit the best growth rates and also inhibit smaller and slower growing males from spawning.  Studies have shown that it is important for sunfish to use their resources for growth instead of reproduction at younger ages and smaller sizes.  Male Bluegill can usually be discerned from females by their brighter coloration and darker orange bellies. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>    Sylvan Reservoir is a riverine lake formed at the confluence of the Crow Wing River and Gull River by the Sylvan Dam.  Most of the land around the main basin is owned by Minnesota Power and Light Company or is part of the Camp Ripley Military Reservation.  The private development is on the Gull River.  Anglers have long used the bridge over the Gull River for fishing.  The area around the bridge has been improved by landscaping with large granite blocks to provide a fishing area for shore fishermen.  Shore fishermen also use the boat access dock for fishing.  The species most sought after from the bridge and dock is bluegill.  Boat anglers fish not only the reservoir for northern pike, walleye, black crappie, and largemouth bass, but travel up both rivers as well.   <br> \n     Large sediment deposition areas with lush vegetation are located in the middle of the reservoir and on the south side of where the Crow Wing River enters.  Curly leaf pondweed is common in both the main reservoir as well as the Gull River.  The stream flow from the Crow Wing River has carved a deeper channel in the reservoir, which follows the shoreline for much of the main basin.  Boat anglers are advised to consult maps or watch their depth finders while traveling toward the Crow Wing River.  Water clarity is impacted by rain events and flows from the two major tributaries.  The Crow Wing River has typically contributed more sediment to the basin than the Gull River.       Bluegill continue to be common despite their apparent decline in trapnet representation and fish between 6.5 and 8.5 inches in length were the most common in the survey.   Most of the black crappie that were observed during the survey tended to be small by most anglers' standards, but fish over 9 inches were found.  The northern pike population appears to be relatively stable with little change in abundance since the last survey in 2002.   The average size observed in the survey was about 22 inches or 2.4 pounds, however, there were some larger pike over 30 inches measured.  Sylvan historically has had a low walleye population despite regular stocking prior to 1994.  The population was then sustained by natural reproduction until 2006 when stocking was reintroduced.  Smaller walleye should begin to show up on anglers' hooks if fry stocking has been successful, but with two major rivers feeding the reservoir, the walleye may not be staying in the reservoir.  Walleye have been observed and fished below the Placid Lake Dam and Gull River Dam. <br> \n     Some impressive largemouth bass were documented during daytime electrofishing on the reservoir.  Although the average size of the bass caught was about 10 inches, there were some fish up to nearly 20 inches observed.  Some nice yellow perch up to ten inches were found, but most were less than 8 inches in length. <br> \n     Sylvan Reservoir has a diverse roughfish community that is indicative of a riverine system.  White sucker, shorthead redhorse, and silver redhorse were all sampled in the survey along with bowfin or dogfish, brown bullhead, yellow bullhead, and common carp.  The yellow bullhead was the more numerous of the two bullhead species.  Individuals up to 13 inches were found in both species of bullhead, but the average size was around 10 inches.  Some other fish species found in the reservoir include pumpkinseed sunfish, hybrid sunfish, and rock bass. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Sylvan Lake Reservoir is an impoundment of the Crow Wing River formed by SylvanDam.  It provides unique fishing opportunities with a diverse fish community andchoice of lake or riverine habitats.  A major tributary to the system is the GullRiver.  Land around the reservoir is owned by Minnesota Power and Light Company oris part of the Camp Ripley Military Reservation.  Bluegills are the most soughtafter species in the main basin, while northern pike are caught from Fishermens'Bridge and walleye in the Gull River system.  Northern pike appear to be at normalpopulation levels with the average length about nineteen inches.  Two pike between33 and 35 inches in length were sampled during the survey, suggesting the lake doeshave the potential for large pike.  Sylvan historically has had a low populationof walleye and the 1996 survey indicates this remains unchanged.  Walleye fry hadbeen stocked annually between 1986 and 1991, while fingerlings were stocked in 92'and  94', all with little success.  Fall electrofishing conducted in 1996documented natural reproduction indicating stocking is not necessary.  Bluegillwere abundant and averaged 6.5 inches, while black crappies continue to be smallat five to ten inches.  Largemouth bass tend to be slow growing with the averagesize about 12 inches, however, bass up to 20 inches were sampled during fallelectrofishing.  Perch numbers continue to be within the normal range.  Roughfishin the system include, white sucker, shorthead, silver, and greater redhorse,bowfin, burbot, and yellow, black, and brown bullheads.  Yellow perch and smallersuckers are important prey species for the larger predator fish.  Carp are alsopresent, but their abundance is difficult to assess.Selective harvest is encouraged for both angling and spearing to minimize impacton the fish community.  Releasing larger northern pike and walleye and voluntarilylimiting harvest of large panfish will help sustain the quality and balance of thefish community.  Water clarity is impacted by rain events and flows from the twomajor tributaries.  It is important to minimize impacts to the reservoir from damrepairs by timing and duration of the draw-downs.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>     Sylvan Reservoir is a riverine lake formed at the confluence of the Crow Wing River and Gull Rivers by the Sylvan Dam.  Most of the land around the main basin is owned by Minnesota Power and Light Company or is part of the Camp Ripley Military Reservation.  Any private development is on the Gull River.  Anglers have long used the bridge over the Gull River for fishing.  The area around the bridge was improved for shore fishermen with the addition of large granite blocks.  Shore anglers also utilize the boat access dock for fishing.  The species most sought after from the bridge and dock is Bluegill.  Boat anglers fish not only the reservoir for Northern Pike, Walleye, Black Crappie, and Largemouth Bass, but travel up both rivers as well.   <br> \n     Large sediment deposition areas with lush vegetation are located in the middle of the reservoir and on the south side of where the Crow Wing River enters.  Curly leaf pondweed is common in both the main reservoir as well as the Gull River.  Stream flow from the Crow Wing River has carved a deeper channel in the reservoir, which follows the south shoreline for much of the main basin.  Boat anglers are advised to consult maps or watch their depth finders while traveling toward the Crow Wing River.  Water clarity is impacted by rain events and flows from the two major tributaries.   <br> \n    Bluegill numbers are considered to be within the normal range when compared to similar type lakes.   Fish between 6.5 and 7.5 inches in length were common in the survey.   Few Black Crappie were netted during the survey but a wide range of sizes was observed.   The two gear types used in this survey, trap nets and spring electrofishing, typically do not represent Northern Pike and Walleye populations well unless performed during spring or fall.   The Northern Pike observed in the survey were all less than 26 inches in length but larger pike have been recorded in previous surveys.    Sylvan historically has had a low Walleye population despite regular stocking prior to 1994.  The population was then sustained by natural reproduction until 2006 when stocking was performed.  Fry stocking still occurs, but with two major rivers feeding the reservoir, it is not known if the Walleye are staying in the reservoir.  Walleye have been observed and fished below both the Placid Lake Dam and Gull River Dam.  Some nicer Largemouth Bass were documented during daytime electrofishing on the reservoir.  Although the average size of the bass caught was about 10 inches, there were some fish up to 19 inches measured.   Five smaller Smallmouth Bass, under seven inches in length, were also sampled during the electrofishing effort. <br> \n     Sylvan Reservoir supports a diverse roughfish community that is indicative of a riverine system.  White Sucker, Shorthead Redhorse, and Silver Redhorse were all sampled in the survey along with Bowfin or Dogfish, Brown Bullhead, Yellow Bullhead, and Common Carp.  Some other fish species found in the reservoir include Pumpkinseed Sunfish, hybrid sunfish, and Rock Bass. <br> \n</p>",
