                "narrative": "<p>Northern pike, yellow perch, black bullhead, pumpkinseed, bluegill and hybrid sunfish were each taken, in the respective gear, in numbers significantly above the statewide median.  Yellow bullhead and black crappie were caught in trap nets in numbers significantly lower than statewide median trap net catches.  Green sunfish were caught at the statewide median catch rate.Northern pike were taken in numbers well in excess of the local gill net median.  Fish aged were I, III, IV, V, VI and VII annulus fish were the next most abundant fish.  These fish correspond to the last year (1975) which the cooperative spawning area was operated by the Section of Fisheries.The III annulus fish (1976 year class) represent natural reproduction as do the I annulus (1978 year class) fish.  The (II annulus) year class was not represented.  Natural reproduction of northern pike does not appear to be a regular feature.Bluegill were present in numbers over 3 times the local median.  Most fish tended to be under 6 inches in length.  Ages from I to V annuli were represented in aging with the II-IV annulus fish all being nearly equal in abundance.  II annulus bluegills exhibited fast growth while III and IV annulus fish showed average growth.  Large numbers of young of the year sunfish (all species) were found during shoreline seining.  Pumpkinseed numbers were also above the local median in significant magnitude.  18 of 21 scales read proved to have II annuli and these fish exhibited fast growth.  Black crappies were taken in very low numbers.  A lake survey conducted in 1961 showed very high numbers.  Lake Demontreville is known to be a very popular lake for crappie fishing.  It is felt that the low catch rate is due to sampling error rather than being a true reflection of the population size.  Crappies aged were I, III, and IV annulus fish with young of the year fish having been found in shoreline seining as well.Black bullhead numbers are above the local median but lower than the 1961 survey.  The size of the fish taken in 1979 is generally larger than 1961.Largemouth bass were taken only by shoreline seining.  Both young of the year and older fish were found.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of the nearshore fish community on Lake DeMontreville was conducted on June 16th, 2017 by Fisheries Lake IBI program staff. Sampling stations were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at all ten stations with one site sampled from the boat. A 50-foot seine was used to sample eight stations, soft sediments with abundant emergent vegetation in deep water prevented the use of seines at two sampling sites. Nearshore sampling captured 9 native species of fish. <br> \n <br> \nData from this targeted nearshore survey is combined with data from a standard gill and trap netting survey in June 2018 to calculate a Fish-based Index of Biologic Integrity (FIBI) score that describes the overall health of the lake. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment.  The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. The FIBI score for Lake DeMontreville based on this survey is above the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes.  Data from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the lower St. Croix River Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.   For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website. <br> \n</p>",

Black crappies were sampled during the spring trap netting in larger than average size for what is typical for this lake. Over 30% of the black crappies sampled exceeded 10 inches. Northern pike continue to be found in high abundance. The average size sampled was 21.7 inches and 2.5 pounds. A small number of largemouth bass were sampled during the survey but averaged over 14 inches in length. A remnant population of walleye still exist since stocking was terminated after 2005.</p>",

The bluegills exhibit slow growth and the PSD is 15.6% vs 25.7% in 1988.  The largemouth bass show good growth with the majority of these falling in the III age group.  Northern pike were found to be average in numbers and growth.  Black bullheads are average in number while the yellow bullhead catch is 15.5/set, several times above the state and local medians.  Hybrid sunfish and pumpkinseeds are above the medians and black crappie and yellow perch are below.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey was conducted on DeMontreville Lake July 24-25, 2019 by Fisheries Lake Index of Biological Integrity (FIBI) program staff. Sampling methods targeted nearshore, small-bodied fish and included seining and backpack electrofishing. Ten sampling stations were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at all ten stations, but one station was sampled from the boat due to site conditions. A 50-foot seine was used to sample five stations, a 15-foot seine was used at four stations and soft substrates and dense emergent vegetation prevented the use of seines at one site. Nearshore sampling captured 10 native species of fish including one species intolerant of habitat disturbance (Iowa Darter) and one species tolerant of habitat disturbance (Green Sunfish).   <br> \n <br> \nData from this targeted nearshore survey is combined with data from a standard gill net survey completed June 2018 and a standard trap net survey completed June 2017 to calculate a Fish-based Index of Biological Integrity (FIBI) score that describes the overall health of the lake. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment. In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g. Iowa Darter and Banded Killifish), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g. Green Sunfish and Common Carp). The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.  <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey indicates DeMontreville Lake is in good health as indicated by a FIBI score above the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar shallow lakes. Data from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Lower St. Croix River Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency. </p>",

There were low numbers of black bullheads, green sunfish, pumpkinseeds and black crappies sampled, but high numbers of hybrid sunfish and yellow bullheads were present.  Hybrid sunfish were 18 times the local median and yellow bullheads were about five times the local median.</p>",

The catch is below the 12 assessment average of 130.15/set but it is still high. The average length is only 4.95 inches, with none exceeding 7 inches. Pumpkinseed and hybrid sunfish were each sampled in moderate abundance. They each had individuals in excess of 7 inches. Black crappies, overall, were sampled in average numbers. The average size sampled was less than 7 inches. Northern pike numbers are down when compared to previous years, but still considered average for this type of lake. The average size caught was 23.7 inches and 3.35 pounds. Both black and brown bullheads were caught in low abundance. Yellow bullheads were sampled in average abundance. Yellow perch were found in moderate abundance. One walleye was also sampled. In 2001 the Mn DNR began stocking walleye fry in every other odd year. Walleye fingerlings may be stocked if periodic assessments show that fry stocking is not working. Largemouth bass were sampled in low numbers due to the type of gear that was used. Electrofishing was not conducted during this assessment due to equipment failures.      </p>",

Northern pike, black crappie, and largemouth bass fall below the state and local trap net medians.  Sixteen largemouth bass were sampled electrofishing this year.  The largemouth bass PSD is 43.8% vs 26.3% in 1986.  Yellow bullhead, yellow perch, pumpkinseed, hybrid sunfish, and bluegills are over the medians.  The bluegill catch per set is 6 times that of the local median.  The bluegill PSD is 18.6% vs 3.3% in1986.  The predominant length group in the sample is 5.5-5.9inches.  Last year it was 5.0-5.4 inches.  Growth of largemouth bass is normal except that six annulus fish and older experienced slow growth.  Bluegill growth is below average.  The special regulations in effect on Demontreville are expected to improve the bluegill growth rates in the future.</p>",

Only 14% of the Bluegill captured measured over 6.0\" in length. Pumpkinseed sunfish are present in below average number, but some quality size individuals are present. The average Pumpkinseed sampled was 6.15\" long and 0.226 pounds. Over 25% of the Pumpkinseeds captured measured 7.0\" or larger. The largest individual sampled was 8.82\" long and weighed 0.60 pounds. Black Crappie were sampled in below median numbers and averaged 7.62\" long and 0.21 pounds. Northern Pike were captured above median levels for abundance and at the highest gill net catch rate ever recorded for this lake. The average Northern Pike captured was 22.45\" in length and 2.64 pounds. Only one Walleye measuring 18.7\" and weighing 2.18 pounds was netted. Yellow Perch were sampled below the normal range for abundance and at the lowest gill net catch rate recorded since 1989. Largemouth Bass were captured in good numbers with some quality individuals (over 20.0\") present. While the average Largemouth Bass sampled was 11.46\" long and 1.17 pounds, over 30% of all the fish captured measured 16.0\" or longer. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Demontreville is a 146 acre, class 38 lake with 88% littoral area (15 feet and less) and is located in the City of Lake Elmo, Washington County. Much of the shoreline is developed as single family homes.  A Jesuit Retreat Center is on the east shore.  There is a public boat launch on the west shore and a limited area of shoreline available for the public to fish from. A navigable channel connects Lake Demontreville to Olson Lake, a smaller 87 acre waterbody with 100% littoral zone. Both of these lakes are meeting MPCA water quality standards for transparency, chlorophyll-a and total phosphorus. Demontreville is considered a deep lake for these standards and in 2018 had secchi depth of 12 feet. Lake Demontreville has Eurasian watermilfoil present in it and an aggressive treatment program is undertaken by the lake association. Largemouth Bass is the primary species managed in Demontreville, with Bluegill the secondary species.  <br> \n <br> \nBluegill continue to be present in above average abundance and small size in Demontreville Lake. The average Bluegill sampled in 2018 was 4.8 inches in length.  Black Crappies were sampled in below average numbers than is typical for this lake. Black Crappie average length was 7.0 inches. Northern Pike continue to be found in high abundance averaging 21.7 inches. A small number of Largemouth Bass were sampled in the survey but are in above average abundance using gill nets. Largemouth Bass averaged over 15 inches. Other fish sampled in low abundance were Black, Yellow and Brown Bullheads, Yellow Perch and Pumpkinseed and Hybrid Sunfish. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>An area of 143 acres is covered by Lake Demontreville.  Ninety percent (129 acres) of the lake is shallower than 15 feet.  A maximum depth of 24 feet exists while the median depth was determined to be 8 feet.  The lake waters are moderately hard and appears to be quite fertile as a heavy algal bloom is reported to consistently reappear every summer.  Water clarity at best would only appear to be fair as a Secchi disc could not be seen in waters deeper than 4.5 feet.  Aquatic vegetation for the most part was scattered and sparse.  However, a moderate growth of western waterweed was judged to be present.  There is an intermittent inlet which at times carries only a small amount of runoff to the lake.  A second inlet which comes from Olson Lake is said to have been the outlet when water levels were lower and no pumping operations existed on Olson Lake.  Shoreline marsh areas on Lake Demontreville are absent.Test netting of the lake indicated that numbers of golden shiner, black bullhead, brown bullhead, pumpkinseed, bluegill hybrid sunfish, and black crappie were quite abundant when compared with state-wide medians.  Population densities for northern pike, largemouth bass, green sunfish, and common sucker were below respective state-wide medians.There is a Jesuit retreat on the east shore in addition to 32 private homes and/or cottages.  A total of 27 boats were counted.  Four township roads (streets) in Section 4 give the public access to the water although there is no designated state-owned access.  Fishing pressure is believed to be quite light as only sporadic northern pike angling is reported to take place in the spring, and few fishermen care to catch the many small panfish and bullheads present.</p>",

Black crappie numbers appear to have increased slightly from recent years with a few of acceptable size to anglers.Largemouth bass dominate the predator population of the lake.  One-third of the fish sampled were at least 16 inches long.  Northern pike numbers are higher than they have ever been, with most fish hatched in 1993.  Bullhead numbers are low.  Yellow, black and brown bullhead are present with most fish over 11 inches long.  Yellow perch are present in moderate numbers with fish of small size.  A few white sucker are present.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Demontreville is a 146 acre lake with 88% littoral area (126 acres) and is classified as lake class 38 and is located in the City of Lake Elmo, Washington County. Much of the shoreline is developed as single family homes.  A Jesuit Retreat Center is on the east shore.  There is a public boat launch on the west shore and a limited area of shoreline available for the public to fish from. A navigable channel connects Lake Demontreville to Olson Lake, a smaller 87 acre waterbody with 100% littoral zone. Both of these lakes are meeting MPCA water quality standards for transparency, chlorophyll-a and total phosphorus. Demontreville is considered a deep lake for these standards and in 2016 had secchi depth of 3.14 meters, chlorophyll-a of 5.6ug/L and total phosphorus of 18ug/L. Lake Demontreville has Eurasian watermilfoil present in it and an aggressive treatment program is undertaken by the lake association. <br> \n <br> \nBluegills continue to be present in above average abundance and small size in Demontreville Lake. The average Bluegill sampled in 2017 was 4.87 inches in length.  Black Crappies were sampled in below average abundance for what is typical for a lake of this type. The average size of Black Crappie was 7.81 inches. Northern Pike were found in low abundance. The average size sampled was 20.8 inches. One 16 inch Largemouth Bass was sampled during the survey. Other fish found in medium to low abundance were Black, Brown and Yellow Bullheads and Pumpkinseed, Green and Hybrid Sunfish.  <br> \n</p>",
