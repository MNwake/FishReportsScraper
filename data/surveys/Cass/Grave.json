                "narrative": "<p>Grave Lake (DOW# 11-086; Lake Class 23) is a 372-acre lake located near Remer, MN. There is a DNR owned public access on the northeast shore. Grave Lake has 6.20 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 55 feet. The lake is primarily managed for Largemouth Bass and Northern Pike and secondarily for Bluegill, Black Crappie, Yellow Perch, and Walleye. The DNR has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different classes based on physical, chemical and other characteristics. Grave Lake is in Lake Class 23; lakes in this class are generally very clear, very deep, have a low percentage of shallow water area, and have very irregularly shaped shoreline with many bays or points.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike are abundant in Grave Lake and catch rates are comparable to other Lake Class 22 lakes. In addition to good numbers of Northern Pike, there are larger fish present. The mean length for Northern Pike was 19 inches and fish up to 35 inches were sampled. Walleye gill net catch rates were comparable to previous years and lengths ranged from 7 to 20 inches. Bluegill should also provide additional fishing opportunities to anglers. Bluegill up to 9 inches were sampled. Other fish species that anglers can expect to encounter include Black Crappie,  Bowfin (Dogfish), Largemouth Bass, Pumpkinseed, Rock Bass, White Sucker, Yellow Bullhead, and Yellow Perch. <br> \n <br> \nPeople can have significant impacts on lakes and the fish populations they support. Harvest, lakeshore development, removal of shoreline vegetation, and introductions of invasive species can all adversely affect fish populations. Currently no aquatic invasive species (AIS) have been identified in Grave Lake. AIS are moved from infested to non-infested waters by anglers, boaters, and lake shore owners and can adversely impact lakes and fish populations. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access. If you suspect an infestation of an invasive species in this lake, save a specimen and report it to a local natural resource office. Additional information on all of these topics can be found on the DNR website (www.dnr.state.mn.us) or by contacting the Walker Area Fisheries office. <br> \n</p>",

The assessment consisted of 50 survey sites evenly spaced 200 meters around the lake. Assessments were made in three habitat zones: Shoreline Zone (the shore-water interface to the top of the natural bank), Shoreland Zone (land-ward from shoreline to development structure or 100 feet), and Aquatic Zone (lake-ward 50 feet of shoreline). The average lakewide habitat score was 82.7 (+/- 1.9) out of 100 possible. Approximately 36 percent of the sites were developed with a mean score of 72.6 (+/- 4.1), while undeveloped sites had a mean score of 88.3 (+/- 0.8).</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>The 1999 Grave Lake management plan lists walleye as the primary species for management with northern pike as a secondary species.Walleye were most recently stocked in 1998 and 1991 and have been stocked occasionally since 1958.  Catch rates during historical assessments have ranged from 2.0 to 6.2 per gill net. The 2000 catch rate of 3.0 per gill net was typical for Grave Lake, and the mean weight of 1.9 pounds was above average for the lake.  Of the 27 walleye aged, 89% were naturally reproduced from non-stocked years (an unknown percentage of fish from stocked years were also likely from natural reproduction).  Size structure was good, with a PSD (15 inches) of 72 and a RSD-P (20 inches) of 16.  Growth rates were within 15% of statewide averages for all ages, although they were somewhat higher for ages 1-4 and somewhat lower for ages 5-6.  The largest individual was 21.3 inches and 8 years old, from a non-stocked year class.Northern pike catch rates during historical assessments have ranged from 2.8 to 9.8 per gill net.  The 2000 catch rate of 9.8 per gill net was the highest on record, and the mean weight was 1.7 pounds.  Size structure was poor, with a PSD (21 inches) of 29 and RSD-P (28 inches) of 2.  Growth rates were somewhat (<15%) below the statewide averages for ages 1-6.  The largest individual was 29.1 inches and 6 years old.Largemouth bass catch rates during historical assessments have ranged from 0 to 1.5 per gill net and from 0.8 to 3.5 per trap net.  The 2000 catch rates were 0.9 per gill net and 0.8 per trap net. Only one of the 15 fish sampled was over 12 inches. Growth rates were below the statewide averages for ages 1-3, and >15% below for ages 1 and 2.Bluegill catch rates during historical assessments have ranged from 18.3 to 27.9 per trap net, and those for pumpkinseed have ranged from 1.1 to 4.0 per trap net.  The 2000 bluegill catch rate of 26.1 per trap net was typical for Grave Lake, as was the 2000 pumpkinseed catch rate of 2.0 per trap net.  Bluegill size structure was somewhat poor, with a PSD (6 inches) of 54 and a RSD-P (8 inches) of 3, and pumpkinseed size structure was similar with a PSD (6 inches) of 61 and a RSD-P (8 inches) of 6.Shoreline owners can directly help to maintain or improve water quality and fish habitat by following lakeshore development best management practices, such as maintaining or upgrading septic systems, minimizing nutrient inputs from fertilizer use, and leaving aquatic vegetation and terrestrial vegetation within at least 50 feet of the shoreline intact or restoring such vegetation to its native state.  Poorly-maintained septic systems and fertilizers contribute excess nutrients and bacteria to the lake, and removal of upland and aquatic vegetation can cause additional ecological problems.  Symptoms of impaired water quality can include increases in winter kills, summer kills, algae, aquatic plants, and fecal coliform bacteria.  Conversely, a fully natural (not mowed grass) vegetated shoreline provides cover for young and adult fish, removal of nutrients before they reach the lake, reduced erosion, food for invertebrates, and food and habitat for other wildlife.

                "narrative": "<p>Grave Lake (DOW# 11-0086; Lake Class 23) is a 372-acre lake with located near Remer, MN. There is a DNR owned public access on the northeast shore. The lake has 132 littoral acres, 6.20 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 55 feet. The DNR has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different classes based on physical, chemical and other characteristics. Grave Lake is in Lake Class 23; lakes in this class are generally very clear, very deep, have a low percentage of shallow water area, and have very irregularly shaped shoreline with many bays or points. Other Lake Class 23 lakes in the Walker area include Hay, Horseshoe, Island, Mule, and Ponto lakes. The lake is primarily managed for Largemouth Bass and Northern Pike and secondarily for Bluegill, Black Crappie, Yellow Perch, and Walleye. <br> \n   <br> \nThe gill net component of this survey was completed in 2020 and due to Covid-19 restrictions the trap net portion could not be conducted until 2021. Bluegill were caught at moderate levels and lengths ranged from 3 to nearly 10 inches.  There are no management goals for Bluegill but abundance was similar to past surveys and other similar lakes. No Black Crappie were sampled in this survey.   <br> \n  <br> \nOther fish sampled in this survey include Hybrid Sunfish, Largemouth Bass, Northern Pike, Pumpkinseed Sunfish, Rock Bass, and Yellow Perch.   <br> \n <br> \nPeople can have significant impacts on lakes and the fish populations they support. Harvest, lakeshore development, removal of shoreline vegetation, and introductions of invasive species can all adversely affect fish populations. Currently no aquatic invasive species (AIS) have been identified in Grave Lake. AIS are moved from infested to non-infested waters by anglers, boaters, and lake shore owners and can adversely impact lakes and fish populations. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access. If you suspect an infestation of an invasive species in this lake, save a specimen and report it to a local natural resource office. Additional information on all of these topics can be found on the DNR website (www.dnr.state.mn.us) or by contacting the Walker Area Fisheries office. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Grave Lake (DOW# 11-086; Lake Class 23) is a 377-acre lake located near Remer, MN, and has a public access on the northeast shore.  Grave Lake has a maximum depth of 55 feet, and 35% of the lake area is littoral (less than 15 feet deep).  The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MNDNR) has classified Minnesota\u0019s lakes into 43 different classes based on physical, chemical and other characteristics.  Grave Lake is in Lake Class 23; lakes in this class are generally very clear, very deep, have a low percentage of shallow water area, and have very irregularly shaped shoreline with many bays or points.   <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance in the 2009 sampling in Grave Lake was lower than that of similar lakes.  Fish from 7 to 22 inches were sampled in MNDNR test nets.  Walleye fry are stocked during even-numbered years in an effort to increase the population of this species.   The abundance of northern pike in Grave Lake was similar to other lakes of this type.  Though many northern pike sampled in 2009 were less than 20 inches in length, fish up to 35 inches were found.  The bluegill population is comparable to other lakes in this class, and fish up to almost 9 inches were measured.  The number of yellow perch collected was similar to other lakes of this type, however most were small.  Largemouth bass up to 15 inches were collected during the 2009 DNR sampling.   Other species in Grave Lake include black crappie, pumpkinseed sunfish, rock bass, white sucker, and yellow bullhead.  <br> \n <br> \nAnglers can help maintain or improve the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for table fare, but encourages release of medium- to large-sized fish.  Releasing these fish can help maintain balance in the fish community of Grave Lake and provide anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future.   <br> \n <br> \nShoreline areas on the land and into the shallow water provide essential habitat for fish and wildlife that live in or near Minnesota\u0019s lakes.  Overdeveloped shorelines can\u0019t support the fish, wildlife, and clean water that are associated with natural undeveloped lakes.  Shoreline habitat consists of aquatic plants, woody plants and natural lake bottom soils.  Plants in the water and at the water\u0019s edge provide habitat, prevent erosion and absorb excess nutrients. Shrubs, trees, and woody debris such as fallen trees or limbs provide good habitat both above and below the water and should be left in place.  By leaving a buffer strip of natural vegetation along the shoreline, property owners can reduce erosion, help maintain water quality, and provide habitat and travel corridors for wildlife. <br> \n</p>",

Grave Lake is in Lake Class 23; lakes in this class are generally very clear, very deep, have a low percentage of shallow water area, and have very irregularly shaped shoreline with many bays or points.  Other Lake Class 23 lakes in the Walker Area include Hay (DOW# 11-0199), Horseshoe (DOW# 11-0358), Island (DOW# 11-0102), Mule (DOW# 11-0200), and Ponto (DOW# 11-0234) lakes. The purpose of this survey was to evaluate Walleye stocking and the status of Northern Pike, Walleye, and Yellow Perch populations. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike are abundant in Grave Lake. The Northern Pike gill net catch rate of seven fish per net was within the lake specific management goal of five to eight fish per net. Northern Pike average length was 21 inches and lengths ranged from 13 to 33 inches long. Walleye numbers have increased since 2009. The Walleye gill net catch rate was over three fish per gill net which met the minimum management goal of 3 fish per gill net. Walleye averaged 17 inches long and lengths ranged from 12 to 22 inches. Recent Walleye fingerling stocking has been marginally successful at maintaining a low to moderately abundant Walleye population. Yellow Perch are the main forage fish for Walleye. Yellow perch numbers remained below the management goal of five fish per gill net. Low Yellow Perch numbers may be limiting the success of Walleye stocking. Bluegill should also provide additional fishing opportunities to anglers. Bluegill up to 9 inches were sampled during previous assessments. Other fish species that anglers can expect to encounter include Black Crappie, Largemouth Bass, Pumpkinseed, Rock Bass, White Sucker, and Yellow Bullhead. <br> \n <br> \nPeople can have significant impacts on lakes and the fish populations they support. Harvest, lakeshore development, removal of shoreline vegetation, and introductions of invasive species can all adversely affect fish populations. Currently no aquatic invasive species (AIS) have been identified in Grave Lake. AIS are moved from infested to non-infested waters by anglers, boaters, and lake shore owners and can adversely impact lakes and fish populations. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access. If you suspect an infestation of an invasive species in this lake, save a specimen and report it to a local natural resource office. Additional information on all of these topics can be found on the DNR website (www.dnr.state.mn.us) or by contacting the Walker Area Fisheries office. <br> \n</p>",

THIS IS CONSIDERABLY HIGHER THAN THE STATEWIDE AVERAGE AND THE SCHUPP LAKE CLASS #25 MEDIAN OF 5.5 (3.33-8.50 MID 50% QUARTILE RANGE).  THE LENGTH-FREQUENCY DISTRIBUTION REVEALS A WIDE RANGE OF SIZES, 11.5 ADEQUATE REPRODUCTION SINCE NO NOP STOCKING HAS BEEN DONE SINCE 1977.  THE GILL NET PROPORTIONAL STOCK DENSITY (PSD) IS 31.  AGE I-IV ARE MOST ABUNDANT, WITH AGE III COMPRISING 55% OF THE SAMPLE.  GROWTH IS MODERATE; MEAN BACK CALCULATED LENGTH AT LAST ANNULUS FORMATION IS AGE I-10.4 (N=1), II-15.6 (N=6), V-22.4 (N=1), AND AGE VIII-33.7 ABUNDANT, EVIDENCED BY THE TRAP NET CPUE OF 27.8 WHICH APPROXIMATES THE LAKE CLASS MEDIAN OF 22.4 (10.5-50.6 MID 50% QUARTILE RANGE).  THE TRAP NET LENGTH-FREQUENCY DISTRIBUTION RANGED FROM 3.0 8.0 ADEQUATELY SAMPLED, AGE IV WAS MOST ABUNDANT. GROWTH IS CONSIDERABLY BELOW THE STATEWIDE AVERAGE; AGE II-2.8 4.2 (N=6), VIII - 7.1 TYPICALLY LOW NUMBERS; THE TRAP NET CATCH OF 0.8/ LIFT IN HIGHER THAN THE LAKE CLASS MEDIAN OF 0.58 BUT FALLS WELL WITHIN THE 0.25-1.17 MID 50% QUARTILE RANGE.  AGES II-IV COMPRISED THE ENTIRE SAMPLE (N=15) OF GILL NETS AND TRAP NETS COMBINED. GROWTH IS SLOWER THAN THE STATEWIDE AVERAGE; AGE II-5.8 LOW NUMBER OF LMB WERE SAMPLED WHILE SHORELINE SEINING.  THE YEP GILL NET CPUE OF 4.0 IS LESS THAN THE LAKE CLASS MEDIAN OF 9.35 BUT FALLS WITHIN THE 1ST-3RD QUARTILE (1.9-24.5).  NO YEP WERE SAMPLED IN THE SHORELINE SEINE.  RKB WERE VERY ABUNDANT IN THE GILL NETS WITH A CATCH OF 14.5/LIFT.  THIS COMPARES WITH THE LAKE CLASS MEDIAN OF 0.67 (0.3-1.9 MID 50% QUARTILE RANGE). IT IS POSSIBLE ABUNDANT RKB ARE SUPPRESSING THE BLC POPULATION, SINCE THEY THEY APPEAR TO FILL SIMILAR NICHES.  THE WAE GILL NET CPUE OF 2.8 EQUALS THE LAKE CLASS MEDIAN, 1ST-3RD QUARTILE IS 1.17-5.50.  THE GILL NET LENGTH-FREQUENCY SHOWS MOST FISH ARE IN THE 12 MODE AT 19 HAD AN IMPACT ON THE POPULATION SINCE 14 OF 18 FISH AGED WERE FROM YEARS STOCKED; THE OTHER 4 FISH WERE AT LEAST EIGHT YEARS OLD.  LARGE STOCKING BLANKS DID NOT PRODUCE ANY FISH IN THIS SAMPLE.  IT APPEARS THAT WAE REPRODUCTION IS PRACTICALLY NON-EXISTENT IN THIS LAKE.  AGE IV DOMINATE THE SAMPLE (N=12), WHICH COINCIDES WITH A 1987 FRY STOCKING.  WAE FINGERLINGS WERE STOCKED IN 1988, BUT ONLY 2 FISH WERE CAPTURED.  GROWTH IS ONLY FAIR, PARTICULARLY FOR AGE IV FISH.  BACK CALCULATED MEAN TOTAL LENGTH AT LAST ANNULUS FORMATION IS AGE III-11.5 12.8</p>",
