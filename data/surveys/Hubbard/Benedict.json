                "narrative": "<p>Numbers of walleye sampled (5.20/gillnet) were above the third quartile, but 6.36 lbs/gillnet was within the normal range for Lake Class 23 of the Schupp Classification System.  These catch rates are the highest of all the surveys done since 1954.  Mean weight of walleye sampled in 1991 was 1.22 lbs.  The present PSD (69) and RSD-P (19) indicate a good size structure with a good proportion of the population being preferable to anglers.  Walleye growth rates are slow and variable.  The overall mean length at age 4 is 12.68 inches, but the individual year class mean lengths at age 4 range from 10.74 to 14.16 inches.  This variability may be the result of stocking different sizes of fingerlings, as a complement to natural recruits.  Walleye in Benedict Lake are capable of natural reproduction, as evidenced by 1984, 1986 and 1988 year classes.Number of northern pike sampled (8.00/gillnet) was within the normal range, while 17.76 lbs/gillnet was above the third quartile.  These numbers result in a mean weight of 2.22 lbs.  Northern pike abundance has been increasing since 1954, when it was below the first quartile.  Northern pike exhibit slow growth the first year and then again after age 4.  Mean length at age 5 is 20.51 inches.  Recruitment appears strong for all year classes sampled.  Yearling northern pike were stocked in 1985, however, natural reproduction in maintaining the population.Largemouth bass, black crappie, yellow perch and bluegill catch rates were all within the normal ranges for lakes of this classification.  Largemouth bass density dropped below the first quartile in 1986, after being above the third quartile since 1974, the first year they were sampled.  Both black crappie and bluegill abundances had been below the first quartile until 1991.  Growth rates of bluegill are slow for the first 3 years, averaging 4.25 inches at age 3.  The slow growth results in a small size structure (PSD=25) and only one bluegill sampled was over 8.0 inches (preferred length).  Yellow perch (PSD=6) and pumpkinseed (PSD=21) size distributions are also dominated by small fish.  Pumpkinseed catch rates were above the third quartile in 1991 and have been since 1974.  Pumpkinseed exhibit growth rates similar to the bluegill (slow the first 3 years).  Mean length at age 3 is 3.39 inches.  Rock bass catches have also remained above the third quartile since 1974.Bowfin abundance has shown an increase since 1981 and catches climbed above the third quartile in 1991.  Cisco, white sucker, black bullhead and yellow bullhead catch rates were all within the normal ranges for lakes of this class.  Catches of brown bullhead were below the first quartile.  Cisco numbers have generally decreased since 1954.  The white sucker and bullhead populations have fluctuated within or below the normal ranges for all survey years.</p>",

In many instances the introduction of lake trout was attempted in lakes with inadequate oxygen or temperature conditions.  In other cases it is believed that competition with warm water species has limited successful introduction.Temperature and dissolved oxygen test of Benedict Lake in the month of August show the presence of the necessary conditions for the survival of lake trout.  An analysis of the netting data indicates the presence of a relatively small warm water fish population.  Tullibee, a good forage fish for lake trout, showed up heavily in the nets.It is recommended that Benedict Lake be stocked with 20,000 fingerling lake trout.  The stocking of all other species of fish should be discontinued.  The initial trout stocking should be considered experimental, additional stocking must be justified by a significant return to the angler of the stocked fish, or by the results of a resurvey three summers after the introduction.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Benedict Lake is located 1.5 miles south of Benedict in eastern Hubbard County.  Benedict has a surface area of 464 acres and a maximum depth of 91 feet.  The outlet of Benedict flows into Kabekona Bay of Leech Lake.  There is a state-owned public access located east of the lake on the outlet channel.  Benedict provides angling opportunities for Walleye, Northern Pike, and panfish. <br> \n <br> \nThe Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics.  Benedict is in lake class 23.  Class 23 lakes are generally deep, very clear, have hard water and are irregularly shaped.  Other class 23 lakes in the Park Rapids management area include:  Blue, Boot, East Crooked, Eleventh Crow Wing, Ninth Crow Wing, and Spearhead. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance has been consistent the past several surveys and near the average for class 23 lakes.  Walleye sampled had an average length of 18.8 inches, weighed 2.8 pounds, and measured up to 28.9 inches.  A strong year class of 12-14 inch Walleye were sampled and should provide good fishing opportunities in future years.  Important forage species such as Yellow Perch and Tullibee (Cisco) were sampled in good numbers.  Yellow Perch up to 12.0 inches were sampled. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike abundance was high when compared to other class 23 lakes.  Northern Pike abundance has been high since the 2011 survey.  Northern Pike sampled had a mean length of 22.5 inches, weighed 2.7 pounds, and measuring up to 37.5 inches.  The Tullibee (Cisco) and White Sucker forage base has the potential to produce large Northern Pike in Benedict. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill are the most common panfish species in Benedict.  Bluegill and Pumpkinseed were sampled in moderate numbers, similar to recent surveys.  Anglers will find good numbers of Bluegill and Pumpkinseed in the 6 to 8 inch size range.  Present and past surveys have shown the Black Crappie population in Benedict to fluctuate from low to moderate numbers for this lake class.  Black Crappie up to 13.7 inches were sampled. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass were not sampled in the 2021 survey but have been sampled in low to moderate numbers in past surveys. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled included high numbers of Rock Bass and Bowfin and low numbers of Brown Bullhead and Hybrid Sunfish. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Benedict Lake is located 1.5 miles south of the town of Benedict in eastern Hubbard County.  Benedict has a surface area of 440 acres and a maximum depth of 91.0 feet.  The outlet of Benedict flows into Kabekona Bay of Leech Lake.  There is a state-owned public access located on the east shore of the lake on the outlet channel.  Access is also available by traveling up the outlet channel from Kabekona Bay on Leech Lake.  Benedict provides angling opportunities for walleye, northern pike, and panfish.The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics.  Benedict is in lake class 23.  Other area lakes in this same classification include Big Bass, Blue, East Crooked, Spearhead, Tripp, and Boot.Moderate numbers of walleye were sampled with the gillnet catch rate of 3.3 walleye/net within the \"typical\" range for this lake class.  The current management goal is 4.0 walleye/gillnet.  Walleye abundance in past surveys has fluctuated within the \"typical\" range from low to moderate numbers.  Sampled walleye had an average length and weight of 15.8 inches and 1.5 pounds with fish measured up to 26.5 inches.  Age analysis showed that natural reproduction is contributing heavily to the walleye population in Benedict.  The majority of the walleye sample came from years of no walleye stocking.  Benedict is stocked with walleye fingerlings during odd years to supplement natural reproduction.  Important forage species such as yellow perch and tullibee (cisco) were sampled in good numbers.  A few yellow perch are of an acceptable size to provide limited angling.Good numbers of northern pike were sampled with the gillnet catch rate of 7.4 pike/net at the upper end of the \"typical\" range for this lake class.  Northern pike abundance has been increasing over time in Benedict.  Northern pike numbers from earlier surveys were at the low end of the \"typical\" range while recent surveys have been at the upper end of the range.  Sampled northern pike had an average length and weight of 22.4 inches and 3.1 pounds with fish measured up to 33.9 inches.  The tullibee (cisco) forage base has the potential to produce large pike in Benedict.  One tiger muskellunge (northern pike - muskellunge cross) was sampled in the gillnets.Bluegill are the most common of the panfish species in Benedict.  Moderate numbers of bluegill and pumpkinseed  were sampled.  Bluegill abundance has been increasing in Benedict from low numbers in early surveys to moderate numbers in recent surveys. Bluegill had an average length of 6.0 inches with fish measured up to 8.7 inches.  Bluegill growth rates were above other class 23 lakes.  Black crappie were sampled in moderate numbers.  Black crappie have been sampled in low numbers in past surveys.Other species sampled included high numbers of rock bass and moderate numbers of bowfin (dogfish) and white sucker.  Largemouth bass, black bullhead, brown bullhead, and yellow bullhead were sampled in low numbers.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Benedict Lake is located 1.5 miles south of the town of Benedict in eastern Hubbard County.  Benedict has a surface area of 440 acres and a maximum depth of 91.0 feet.  The outlet of Benedict flows into Kabekona Bay of Leech Lake.  There is a state-owned public access located on the east shore of the lake on the outlet channel.  Access is also available by traveling up the outlet channel from Kabekona Bay on Leech Lake.  Benedict provides angling opportunities for walleye, northern pike, and panfish. <br> \n <br> \nThe Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics.  Benedict is in lake class 23.  Other area lakes in this same classification include Big Bass, Blue, East Crooked, Spearhead, Tripp, and Boot. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance was down from the previous survey in 2001, and at the low end of the range \"typical\" for this lake class.  With the exception of the 1991 and 2001 surveys, walleye abundance in past surveys have generally been similar to the 2006 gillnet catch and below the current management goal.  Walleye up to 29.5 inches were sampled.  Recently, Benedict was stocked with walleye fingerlings in odd numbered years.  Walleye stocking was switched to even years starting in 2006.  Stocking evaluations suggest that stocking is not contributing much to the walleye population in Benedict, but the number of samples is low so conclusions should be viewed cautiously.  Important forage species such as yellow perch and tullibee (cisco) were sampled in good numbers.  A few perch are of an acceptable size to provide angling. <br> \n <br> \nGood numbers of northern pike were sampled with the gillnet catch rate at the upper end of the range \"typical\" for this lake class.  Northern pike abundance has been increasing over time in Benedict.  Northern pike numbers from earlier surveys were at the low end of the \"typical\" range while recent surveys have been at the upper end of the range.  Sampled northern pike had an average length and weight of 22.8 inches and 3.1 pounds with pike measured up to 33.6 inches.  The tullibee (cisco) forage base has the potential to produce large pike in Benedict. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill are the most common of the panfish species in Benedict.  Good numbers of bluegill and pumpkinseed were sampled.  Bluegill abundance has been increasing in Benedict from low numbers in early surveys to moderate-high abundance in recent surveys.  Anglers will find good numbers of bluegill in the 6-8 inch size range.  Black crappie were sampled in low numbers.  Black crappie abundance in past surveys has fluctuated from low to moderate abundance.  Black crappies in the 10-12 inch size range were sampled. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled included moderate numbers of rock bass, white sucker, yellow bullhead, and bowfin (dogfish).  Brown and black bullheads were sampled in low numbers. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Benedict Lake is located 1.5 miles south of the town of Benedict in eastern Hubbard County.  Benedict has a surface area of 464 acres and a maximum depth of 91.0 feet.  The outlet of Benedict flows into Kabekona Bay of Leech Lake.  There is a state-owned public access located on the east shore of the lake on the outlet channel.  Access is also available by traveling up the outlet channel from Kabekona Bay on Leech Lake.  Benedict provides angling opportunities for walleye, northern pike, and panfish. <br> \n <br> \nThe Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics.  Benedict is in lake class 23.  Other area lakes in this same classification include Big Bass, Blue, East Crooked, Spearhead, Tripp, and Boot. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance was up slightly from recent surveys with the gillnet catch rate of 3.5 walleye/gillnet within the range \"typical\" for this lake class and above the current management goal of 2.0 walleye/gillnet.  Walleye abundance in past surveys has been stable, ranging from 1 to 5 walleye per gillnet.  Sampled walleye had an average length and weight of 17.5 inches and 2.3 pounds, with fish measured up to 30.9 inches.  Benedict Lake is stocked with walleye fingerlings during even numbered years.  Important forage species such as yellow perch and tullibee (cisco) were sampled in good numbers.  Yellow perch are an acceptable size for angling with perch measured up to 12.1 inches. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike abundance (11.3 pike/gillnet) was the highest recorded for all surveys on Benedict, and above the range \"typical\" for this lake class.  Northern pike abundance has been increasing over time in Benedict.  Northern pike were sampled in low numbers from 1954 to 1981 and at the upper end of the range \"typical\" for this lake class for surveys after 1981.  Sampled northern pike had an average length and weight of 21.7 inches and 2.3 pounds, with pike measured up to 31.9 inches.  The tullibee (cisco) and white sucker forage base has the potential to produce large pike in Benedict.  One 27.0 inch muskellunge was sampled. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill are the most common of the panfish species in Benedict.  Bluegill abundance has been increasing in Benedict from low numbers in earlier surveys to moderate-high abundance in recent surveys.  Anglers will find good numbers of bluegill and pumpkinseed in the 6-8 inch size range.  Black crappie abundance (1.0 crappie/trapnet) was within the range \"typical\" for this lake class.  Black crappie abundance in past surveys has fluctuated from low to moderate abundance.  Black crappie in the 10 to 12 inch size range were sampled. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled included high numbers of rock bass and bowfin (dogfish), and moderate numbers of yellow bullhead, brown bullhead, black bullhead and white sucker. <br> \n</p>",

The Minnesota DNR has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics. Benedict Lake is in lake class 23. Class 23 lakes are generally deep, very clear, have hard water and are irregularly shaped. Other class 23 lakes in the Park Rapids area include: Big Bass, Blue, East Crooked, Spearhead, Tripp, and Boot. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance has been consistent in recent years, and near the average of other class 23 lakes. All Walleye sampled are a great size for anglers, with most 13-21 inches. The average length was 19 inches, with the largest sampled at 28.5 inches. Yellow Perch are important forage for Walleye and Northern Pike, and the numbers were in line with other class 23 lakes. Perch were an average size of 6.5 inches and fish were sampled up to 12.5 inches. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike abundance was very high compared to other class 23 lakes, and the highest of all surveys on Benedict Lake. Northern Pike ranged from 11.5 inches to 35.5 inches in length.  The average size of 20.5 inches and 2 pounds was on the low end of past surveys on Bennedict. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass abundance was comparable to past surveys on Benedict, and to class 23 lakes.  Bass ranged from 7 to 18.5 inches, with an average size of 12 inches. <br> \n <br> \nAngling opportunities for panfish include Black Crappie, Bluegill and Pumpkinseed. Only one 10 inch Black Crappie was sampled, but this is similar to past surveys and Benedict. Bluegill and Pumpkinseed abundance was similar to recent years, with lengths ranging from 3-8 inches. <br> \n <br> \nCurrently, no Aquatic Invasive Species (AIS) have been identified in Benedict Lake. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Benedict Lake (29-0048-00) is a 464.37-acre lake with a maximum depth of 41 feet located near Benedict, MN.  Park Rapids Fisheries staff conducted a survey targeting near shore fish species on August 10, 2021, to assess populations of non-game and small sport fish.  Ten 100-foot sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake shore, sampling a variety of habitat types.  Each site was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot 1/8th-inch mesh seine, depending on habitat conditions.   <br> \nDuring this assessment, four sites were sampled with a 15-foot seine.  Site conditions prevented the use of seines at six sites.  Backpack electrofishing was done at all 10 sites with three being conducted from the side of the boat.  Nearshore sampling captured eighteen species of fish including three species intolerant of disturbance; Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner and Blacknose Shiner.  Other species sampled during the nearshore effort included Bluegill, Bluntnose Minnow, Central Mudminnow, Golden Shiner, Iowa Darter, Johnny Darter, Largemouth Bass, Least Darter, Log Perch, Mimic Shiner, Pumpkinseed Sunfish, Tadpole Madtom, White Sucker, Yellow Bullhead, and Yellow Perch.  Nearshore catches will be used along with gill net and trap net catch data from a standard fisheries survey conducted on June 7, 2021, to calculate a fish-based Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) score, which is indicative of the health of Benedict Lake.   <br> \n <br> \nThis survey is contributing to a watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.  Benedict Lake is located in the Leech Lake River Watershed.</p>",
