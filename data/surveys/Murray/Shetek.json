                "narrative": "<p>Lake Shetek is a 3,596-acre lake located in Murray County and is the largest lake in the Windom fisheries management area. The lake has a maximum depth of 10.0 ft. and typically has poor water quality likely a result from its agricultural watershed.  Aeration systems were installed in the mid 1970's in both the north and south lake.  Whether the aeration systems or some climate change scenarios, there have been limited frequency and severity of winterkills.  Lake Shetek is managed primarily for Walleye and secondarily for Black Crappie, Yellow Perch, and Northern Pike.  A survey was conducted on August 3, 2020 to monitor fish populations using six gill nets and 15 trap nets.   <br> \n <br> \nSince 1983, Walleye catch rates in Lake Shetek have ranged from 2.8 per gill net in 2007 to 43.2 per gill net in 1992 and have averaged 13.4 per gill net.  The 2020 catch rate of 14.8 per gill net was within the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (3.2 to 15.3 per gill net) and exceeded the long term average of 13.4 per gill net.  Five year classes of Walleye were sampled including fish from 2013, 2016, 2017, 2018, and 2019. Sixty-five percent of sampled Walleye were from the 2017 year class, a stocked year with the Lower Mississippi Strain (LMS) of Walleye.  All year classes corresponded to stocking events except the 2018 year class which was likely from natural reproduction.  Although not sampled during the survey, age-0 Walleye (2020 year class) were sampled during fall electrofishing at a rate of 118.8 per hour, also a result of natural reproduction.  Walleye lengths ranged from 9.0 to 18.7 inches and averaged 14.0 inches.  Walleye growth was average, as mean length at age-3 was 15.3 inches.  Walleye angling has been good on Lake Shetek for a couple of years and should continue to be good.  <br> \n <br> \nDespite extensive Northern Pike stockings, abundance in Lake Shetek remained low in the 2020 survey at 0.5 per trap net, similar to the long term average of 0.7 per trap net and similar to catch rates during the past decade.  Lengths of Northern Pike ranged from 17.4 to 22.2 inches and averaged 20.1 inches.    Thus far, Northern Pike survey catch rates have not reflected ongoing efforts to reestablish historic Northern Pike spawning runs through the use of drainable Northern Pike rearing ponds.  Despite low catch rates in the survey, anglers have reported high catch rates of Northern Pike while angling.  <br> \n <br> \nThe Black Crappie catch rate in 2020 decreased to 2.9 per trap net, down from 14.9 per trap net in 2018, but within the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (1.0 to 12.3 per trap net).  Evidence suggests that the 2020 catch rate isn't an accurate representation of the Black Crappie population, as Lake Shetek is a Crappie fishing destination and anglers have reported success when targeting Crappie.  Black Crappie may not be vulnerable to trap nets in August, thus not sampled well.  Black Crappie lengths ranged from 2.9 to 12.0 inches and averaged 8.6 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nThe Yellow Perch catch rate in 2020 was 2.7 per gill net, a decrease from the 2018 catch rate of 9.7 per gill net, and less than the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (3.0 to 22.5 per gill net).  Despite higher abundance following adult Yellow Perch stockings in 2015 and 2017, the 2020 catch rate was still below management goals. Lengths of Yellow Perch ranged from 5.2 to 10.2 inches and averaged 7.8 inches. <br> \n <br> \nThe Channel Catfish catch rate in 2020 was 14.2 per gill net, which is the second highest catch rate in Lake Shetek and is above the long term average of 6.3 per gill net.  Lengths of Channel Catfish ranged from 9.1 to 25.8 inches and averaged 16.9 inches.  The Black Bullhead catch rate in 2020 was 6.5 per gill net, below the long term average of 28.8 per gill net since 1983.  Other species sampled included Bigmouth Buffalo, Bluegill, Common Carp, Quillback, and White Sucker. <br> \n</p>",

The lake has a maximum depth of 10.0 ft. and typically has poor water quality likely a result from its agricultural watershed.  Lake Shetek is managed primarily for Walleye and secondarily for Black Crappie, Yellow Perch, and Northern Pike.  Lake Shetek was stocked with Lower Mississippi Strain Walleye fry in 2017 and 2019 in an effort to get this strain established in additional lakes.  LMS Walleye are present in Murray County's Lake Sarah, a lake that hasn't been stocked since 1991 because the Walleye population is sustained at high levels through natural reproduction.  Lake Shetek was selected because it has traditionally supported a good Walleye population and has historically had sporadic natural reproduction and thus likely has habitat for spawning walleye providing environmental conditions are conducive to natural reproduction.  A nighttime electrofishing survey was conducted on September 19, 2019 to determine if the fry stocking was successful.   <br> \n <br> \nYoung-of-the year Walleye were captured at a rate of 122.0 per hour of electrofishing, which indicates that the fry stocking was successful.  The age-0 Walleyes ranged in length from 5.4 to 8.0 inches and averaged 6.8 inches.  If they survive the winter, the 2019 year class should be a strong year class in the Lake Shetek Walleye population. <br> \n</p>",

During the spring, 1.75 million Lower Mississippi Strain Walleye fry were stocked. Some broodstock remained in the lake after the winterkill, which could have contributed to the population. Additionally, Lake Shetek is downstream of Lake Sarah, which consistently has excessive Walleye natural reproduction. During sampling, 69 age-0 Walleye were sampled in 15 minutes of electrofishing in the north basin of Lake Shetek. Walleye ranged from 6.32 to 8.39 inches with a mean length of 7.01 inches. Dr. Loren Miller at the University of Minnesota determined that just short of 44% of the Age 0 Walleye sampled were from our stocking.  While it may seem like a relatively high percentage, it is actually quite low when you put into context the extent of the winterkill.  In other words, it seemed quite low when your sample in the summer showed relatively few Walleyes above 18 inches.     </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Covering 3,596 acres, Lake Shetek is the largest lake in the Windom Area.  It has a shoreline length of 35.4 miles and a maximum depth of ten feet.  The immediate shoreline is covered primarily by woodland areas, and the majority of the surrounding watershed is cultivated.  Shoalwater areas are dominated by sand and gravel substrate.  As with most lakes in the Windom Area, aquatic vegetation is considered sparse.  Lake Shetek is managed primarily for walleye while providing secondary populations of yellow perch, black crappie, and northern pike.  Northern pike had nearly disappeared from the lake due to drought conditions in the late 1980's, but may be making a comeback after restocking and higher water levels once again gave them access to wetland spawning areas. <br> \n <br> \nLake Shetek was opened to liberalized fishing eight years during the period of 1930-1971. A Helixor aeration system (the first such system in Minnesota) was installed in 1974, and very little winterkill has occurred since then.  The heavily developed lake has long been a center of recreational activity in SW Minnesota, and it is a primary vacation and fishing destination for residents and non-residents alike. <br> \n <br> \nConcerns over water quality led to acquisition of a Clean Water Partnership Grant, Phase I of which was completed in 1996.  Phase II was the implementation of best management practices (BMP\u0019s) within the watershed, with the goal of reducing total phosphorous in the lake by 30% and improving overall water quality.  Water quantity concerns during dry years brought about the construction of a diversion ditch and associated dams in the 1930's, to divert water into Lake Shetek from Beaver Creek.  One of the recommendations coming out of the Clean Water Partnership was that the diversion no longer be operated, as it was determined that it was a huge contributor of undesirable nutrients to the lake, greatly outweighing any benefits of additional water. The diversion structure was subsequently removed and the ditch plugged in 2000.  Shoreline owners are now in the process of updating their sewer systems. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye catch rates in Shetek decreased from a high of 30.6 fish per gill net in 1998 to a low of 2.8 fish per net in 2007.  The catch rate in 2008 was up a bit to 6.2 fish per gill net.  We would expect to catch anywhere from 3.2 to 15.3 walleye per gill net on lakes similar to Shetek.  Lengths of walleye caught in or gill nets ranged from 7.4 to 22.1 inches and averaged 12.1 inches.  The small average length is primarily because of the huge year class of age 3 walleye sampled in 2008.  All walleye sampled were from years walleye fry were stocked.  In an effort to bolster walleye numbers the operational plan was changed from stocking fry every other year to two of three years.  The lake is now surveyed annually rather than once every four years.   <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch numbers in Shetek were up slightly from 2006 and 2007 but still low.  Lengths of yellow perch caught in gill nets ranged from 5.5 to 8.9 inches with an average length of 7.9 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie numbers are down a bit from previous years but Shetek still has what we would consider a normal crappie population when compared to other lakes like Shetek.  Lengths of black crappie caught in trap nets ranged from 5.1 to 10.5 inches and averaged 8.3 inches.  There were some reports of black crappie being caught through the ice this past winter.   <br> \n <br> \nChannel catfish numbers have been gradually decreasing from a high of 11.8 in 2006 to 7.8 in 2008.  Lengths of channel catfish caught in gill nets ranged from 7.1 to 20.1 inches and averaged 15.9 inches.  Channel catfish have never been stocked in Shetek.  It is likely adult channel catfish migrated into the lake from the Des Moines River in 1993 when high water inundated the dam. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled during the assessment included black, yellow and brown bullhead, bigmouth buffalo, white crappie, quillback, and common carp. <br> \n <br> \nTo maintain a healthy fishery in Lake Shetek, we need to promote Best Management Practices (BMP\u0019s) within the watershed to help reduce nutrients entering the lake.  High nutrients and sediments in a lake can cause algae blooms and reduce water clarity. <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Covering 3,596 acres, Lake Shetek is the largest lake in the Windom Area.  It has a shoreline length of 31.7 miles and a maximum depth of 10.0 feet.  The immediate shoreline is covered primarily by woodland areas, and the majority of the surrounding watershed is cultivated.  Shoalwater areas are dominated by sand and gravel substrate.  As with most lakes in the Windom Area, aquatic vegetation is considered sparse.  Lake Shetek is managed primarily for walleye while providing secondary populations of yellow perch, black crappie, and northern pike.   <br> \n <br> \nOxygen levels dropped to 1.6 parts per million (ppm) in the north half of Shetek and 1.0 ppm in the south half of the lake by the middle of February.  Many dead fish were observed after the ice went off the lake.  Trap nets were set in the north and south basins in April of 2010 to assess the severity of the winterkill.  These results are included in the following report. <br> \n <br> \nThe walleye gill net catch rate of 16.8 in 2009 was high when compared to other walleye lakes like Shetek.  The walleye gill net catch rate was 6.2 in 2008, 2.8 in 2007, 4.2 in 2006, and 14.0 in 2002.  It appears that by changing the management plan from stocking walleye fry every other year to stocking walleye fry two of three years has helped the population rebound.  Lengths of walleye sampled in gill nets in 2009 ranged from 7.8 to 21.4 inches with an average length of 11.7 inches.  Five year classes of walleye (2008, 2007, 2006, 2005, 2001) were observed during the 2009 assessment.  Because of low oxygen levels during the winter of 2009-10, eight trap nets were set during the spring of 2010 to assess the extent of the winterkill.  The walleye trap net catch rate in April of 2010 was 6.0.  Lengths of walleye caught in spring trap nets ranged from 6.8 to 24.5 inches with an average length of 14.3 inches.  We concluded low oxygen levels during the winter months had a minimal effect on the walleye population in Shetek.   <br> \n <br> \nThe yellow perch gill net catch rate of 1.5 in 2009 was low when compared to other lakes similar to Shetek.  The yellow perch gill net catch rate was 2.5 in 2008, 1.7 in 2007, 1.7 in 2006, and 53.5 in 2002.  Lengths of yellow perch caught in gill nets in 2009 ranged from 8.8 to 10.2 inches with an average length of 9.3 inches.  The trap net catch rate during the winterkill check in April of 2010 was 9.6.  Lengths of yellow perch caught in trap nets during the winterkill check ranged from 3.3 to 12.8 inches with an average length of 6.9 inches.  We concluded that low oxygen levels during the winter of 2009-10 had a minimal effect on the yellow perch population in Shetek. <br> \n <br> \nThe black crappie trap net catch rate of 8.6 in 2009 was what we would expect for lakes similar to Shetek.  The black crappie trap net catch rate was 1.9 in 2008, 8.9 in 2007, 10.7 in 2006, and 119.9 in 2002.  Lengths of black crappie caught in trap nets in 2009 ranged from 3.9 to 10.7 inches with an average length of 5.9 inches.  The black crappie trap net catch rate in April of 2010 was 14.5.  Lengths of black crappie caught in trap nets during the winterkill check ranged from 6.0 to 11.5 inches with an average length of 9.5 inches.  We concluded that low oxygen levels during the winter of 2009-10 had a minimal effect on the black crappie population in Shetek. <br> \n <br> \nThe channel catfish gill net catch rate was 8.2 in 2009 compared to 7.8 in 2008, 10.0 in 2007, 11.8 in 2006, and 4.5 in 2002.  Lengths of channel catfish caught in gill nets in 2009 ranged from 8.6 to 21.5 inches with an average of 16.2 inches.  It has been perceived that the channel catfish population may be responsible for the decline in the walleye population.  The winterkill check in April of 2010 indicated that low oxygen levels may have had an impact on the channel catfish population in Shetek.  Only one channel catfish that was 18.9 inches in length was caught during the winterkill check. <br> \n <br> \nThe black bullhead trap net catch rate of 0.1 in 2009 was low compared to other lakes similar to Shetek.  The black bullhead gill net catch rate of 2.5 was also quite low.  The black bullhead gill net catch rate was 5.8 in 2008, 9.0 in 2007, 8.7 in 2006, and 73.0 in 2002.  Lengths of black bullhead caught in gill nets ranged from 8.5 to 11.1 inches with an average length of 10.4 inches.  Lower black bullhead numbers may be attributed to high channel catfish numbers.  We have concluded from the winterkill check in 2010 that low oxygen levels during the winter of 2009-10 did not impact the black bullhead population in Shetek. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled during the 2009 assessment included bigmouth buffalo, bluegill, common carp, quillback carpsucker, white sucker, white crappie, and brown bullhead. <br> \n <br> \nTo maintain a healthy fishery in Lake Shetek, we need to promote Best Management Practices (BMP\u0019s) within the watershed to help reduce nutrients entering the lake.  High nutrients and sediments in a lake can cause algae blooms and reduce water clarity. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Shetek is a 3,596-acre lake located in Murray County and is the largest lake in the Windom fisheries management area. The lake has a maximum depth of 10.0 ft. and typically has poor water quality likely a result from its agricultural watershed.  Aeration systems were installed in the mid 1970's in both the north and south lake.  Whether the aeration systems or some climate change scenarios, there have been limited frequency and severity of winterkills.  Additionally the Lake Shetek aeration system was replaced in 2019 to a diffuser type of system that reduced cost and improved some control as it often opened up too much ice and created safety issues for the general public.  Lake Shetek is one of the more popular fishing lakes in the area, and receives high amounts of angling pressure and recreational uses during both the open water and the ice angling seasons.  Unfortunately in 2023, Lake Shetek was listed as infested with zebra mussels after two adult zebra mussels were found.  Lake Shetek is managed primarily for Walleye and secondarily for Black Crappie, Yellow Perch, and Northern Pike.  A survey was conducted on August 1, 2022 to monitor fish populations using six gill nets and 12 trap nets.    <br> \n <br> \nThe 2022 Walleye catch rate was 33.8 per gill net, the second highest catch rate ever recorded in surveys on Lake Shetek and exceeding the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (3.2 to 15.3 per gill net).  Since 1983, Walleye catch rates have ranged from 2.8 to 43.2 per gill net and averaged 14.6 per gill net.  Six year classes of Walleye were sampled, including Walleye from 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021. Fifty-six percent of the Walleye sampled were from the 2021 year class, which was a stocked year with the Lower Mississippi Strain (LMS) of Walleye.  The 2018 and 2020 year classes are the result of natural reproduction, as Lake Shetek was not stocked in those years.  Although not sampled during the survey, age-0 Walleye (2022 year class) were sampled during fall electrofishing at a rate of 226.0 per hour, also a result of natural reproduction.  Lower Mississippi Strain Walleye were first stocked in Lake Shetek in 2017, so some Walleye from the initial LMS stocking are likely sexually mature and may be contributing to the naturally reproduced year classes.  Genetic analysis of the 2020 and 2022 year classes indicate that the age-0 Walleye were majority LMS, suggesting that LMS may do well in Lake Shetek without stocking.  Walleye lengths ranged from 9.1 to 26.3 inches and averaged 12.8 inches, with 24 percent of the Walleye being larger than 14.0 inches.  Mean length at age-1 was 10.8 inches, age-2 was 13.4 inches, age-3 was 15.5 inches, age-4 was 17.4 inches, and age-5 was 18.6 inches, which is similar to growth of Walleye in other similar lakes in Minnesota.  The Lake Shetek Walleye population has had a positive response from the LMS Walleye stockings, as catch rates are fairly high since 2018, and natural reproduction is occurring with regularity.  Lake Shetek's Walleye population should provide a good angling option for years to come.    <br> \n <br> \nDespite extensive Northern Pike stockings, abundance in Lake Shetek remained low in the 2022 survey at 0.5 per trap net, similar to the long term average of 0.7 per trap net and similar to catch rates during the past decade.  Lengths of Northern Pike ranged from 22.5 to 31.5 inches and averaged 25.9 inches. Thus far, Northern Pike survey catch rates have not reflected ongoing efforts to reestablish historic Northern Pike spawning runs through the use of drainable Northern Pike rearing ponds.  Lake Shetek is within the \"southern zone\" of the Northern Pike zone regulations, so two Pike longer than 24 inches can be harvested. Northern Pike under 24 inches must be released. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch catch rates in Lake Shetek have been highly variable, ranging from 0.0 per gill net in 2014 to 53.5 per gill net in 2002, and averaging 10.7 since 1983. In 2022, the Yellow Perch catch rate was 4.7 per gill net, which is within the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (3.0 to 22.5 per gill net).  Lengths of Yellow Perch ranged from 5.1 to 10.6 inches and averaged 7.8 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nThe Black Crappie catch rate in 2022 decreased to 1.3 per trap net, down from 2.9 per trap net in 2020, but within the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (1.0 to 12.3 per trap net).  Evidence suggests that the 2022 catch rate isn't an accurate representation of the current Black Crappie population, as Lake Shetek is a Crappie fishing destination and anglers have reported success when targeting them.  Black Crappie may not be vulnerable to trap nets in August, thus not sampled well.  Black Crappie lengths ranged from 6.1 to 13.0 inches and averaged 10.0 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nThe 2022 Channel Catfish catch rate was 10.5 per gill net, a slight decrease from the 2020 catch rate of 14.2 per gill net, but exceeding the long term average of 6.6 per gill net.  Lengths of Channel Catfish ranged from 10.0 to 24.2 inches and averaged 17.3 inches.  Black Bullhead abundance continued to be low, likely because of the abundant Channel Catfish population, at 9.8 per gill net.  Other species sampled included Bigmouth Buffalo, Bluegill, Common Carp, Quillback, White Crappie, White Sucker, and Yellow Bullhead.   <br> \n</p>",

GROWTH FOR BLACK CRAPPIE IS FAST EARLY IN LIFT BUT DROPS BELOW STATE AVERAGE TYPICALLY BY THE FOURTH SUMMER ALL CRAPPIE RECRUITMENT IS FROM NATURAL REPRODUC- TION. NO NORTHERN PIKE WERE CAUGHT IN THE GILL NETS, HOWEVER, THE TRAPNET INDEX WAS 1.25 TIMES THE LOCAL MEDIAN. SIX OF THE NINE NORTHERN PIKE CAP- TURED WERE AGE 3 . BASED ON A RELATIVELY SMALL SAMPLE SIZE, GROWTH RATES WERE ABOVE STATE AVERAGE FOR SHETEK NORTHERN PIKE DURING EARLY LIFE, BUT SLOWED TO STATE AVERAGE BY THE TIME THEY ATTAINED 20 INCHES. THE YELLOW PERCH GILLNET INDEX WAS 9.7% OF THE LOCAL MEDIAN. TWO-THIRDS OF THE STOCK IS COMPRISED OF AGE 2 FISH AND 26.6% OF AGE 1. THE YELLOW PERCH GROWTH RATE WAS FAST EARLY IN LIFE, BUT SLOWED TO ABOUT STATE AVERAGE BY THE TIME THEY ATTAINED SEVEN INCHES. NATURAL REPRODUCTION CHECKS SHOW THAT BLUEGILL SPAWNED SUCCESSFULLY IN 1986 AND 1988, HOWEVER, FEW ADULTS WERE CAPTURED DURING THE PRESENT POPU- LATION ASSESSMENT. THE BLACK BULLHEAD TRAPNET INDEX WAS 49% OF THE LOCAL MEDIAN. THE CARP TRAP NET INDEX WAS 3.6 TIMES THE LOCAL MEDIAN. THE NET CATCH INDICES FOR BIGMOUTH BUFFALO AND QUILLBACK CARPSUCKER APPROXI- MATED THE MEDIAN FOR OTHER LOCAL LAKES.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Shetek is a 3,596-acre lake located in Murray County and is the largest lake in the Windom fisheries management area. The lake has a maximum depth of 10.0 ft. and typically has poor water quality likely a result from its agricultural watershed.  Aeration systems were installed in the mid 1970's in both the north and south lake and have limited the frequency and severity of winterkills that have occurred since.  Lake Shetek is managed primarily for Walleye and secondarily for Black Crappie, Yellow Perch, and Northern Pike.  Walleye fry are stocked 2 out of 3 years and Northern Pike fingerlings are stocked when available.  A survey was conducted on August 8, 2016 to monitor fish populations using six gill nets and 14 trap nets.   <br> \n <br> \nThe 2016 Walleye gill net catch rate was 7.3 per gill net, which is within the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (3.2 to 15.3 per gill net) and slightly greater than the 2014 catch rate of 5.8 per gill net.  The trap net catch rate was 4.6 per trap net, which is much higher than expected catch rates in similar lakes. The gill net catch rate was likely affected by the abundant Channel Catfish caught in the gill net (16.5 per gill net), as they tend to tangle the gill net.  Walleye lengths ranged from 8.7 to 26.0 inches and averaged 13.5 inches.  Growth of Walleye was slower than what is typical in SW MN, as the mean length at age 3 was 12.0 inches.  Age-1 (2015 year class), age-2 (2014 year class), and age-3 (2013 year class) Walleye comprised 8 percent, 11 percent, and 74 percent of the sample, respectively, with the age-2 and age-3 walleye corresponding to stocking events. Walleye were not stocked in 2015, so the age-1 Walleye are likely the result of natural reproduction.  Anglers have reported an excellent Walleye bite on Lake Shetek during the 2016-2017 ice fishing season.  <br> \n <br> \nThe 2016 Northern Pike catch rate was 0.6 per trap net, similar to catch rates observed two previous surveys and similar to the long term average for Lake Shetek.  Lengths of Northern Pike ranged from 20.4 to 32.2 inches and averaged 26.4 inches, but the Northern Pike were skinny.  Anglers have had success angling for Northern Pike in the inlet area of Lake Shetek during the 2016-2017 ice fishing season.  <br> \n <br> \nThe 2016 Black Crappie catch rate was 10.1 per trap net, which is within the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (1.0 to 12.3 per trap net), and an increase from the 2014 catch rate of 6.4 per trap net.  Black crappie lengths ranged from 3.7 to 10.5 inches and averaged 7.4 inches.  Anglers have reported good crappie angling at the mouth of the inlet of Lake Shetek during the 2016-2017 ice fishing season. Crappie angling should be good in the spring of 2017 when they are in shallow spawning.  <br> \n <br> \nLake Shetek was stocked with 260 pounds of adult Yellow Perch in 2015 because of several years of low catch rates.  Despite the stocking, the 2016 Yellow Perch catch rate was 0.3 per gill net, which is below the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (3.0 to 22.5 per gill net).  Lengths of Yellow Perch ranged from 5.7 to 10.0 inches and averaged 7.5 inches.  Currently, it appears that there is not a fishable population of Yellow Perch in Lake Shetek, but enough brood stock is likely present to produce a year class if conditions are favorable.  <br> \n <br> \nBlack Bullhead were caught at a rate of 4.5 per gill net, the second lowest catch rate ever recorded on Lake Shetek.  Black Bullhead lengths ranged from 6.6 to 11.2 inches and averaged 10.0 inches.  The 2016 Common Carp catch rate was 2.2 per trap net, similar to catch rates dating back to 2006.  The Channel Catfish catch rate was 16.5 per gill net, which is the highest observed catch rate on Lake Shetek since the onset of surveys in 1983.  Channel Catfish ranged in length from 12.1 to 24.8 inches and averaged 15.2 inches.  Other species sampled included Bigmouth Buffalo, Brown Bullhead, Bluegill, Quillback, White Crappie, White Sucker, and Yellow Bullhead.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Shetek, in Murray County, is the largest lake in the Windom Fisheries Management Area with about 3,600 acres. The lake is separated into 2 distinct basins, North and South, and has a maximum depth of 10.0 feet. Lake Shetek is generally characterized as an ecologically degraded shallow lake. Many disturbances within the watershed have resulted in poor water quality over the past 100 years. In addition, due to its shallow nature, low winter dissolved oxygen levels can occur. Winter aeration has been used to combat this threat. Winter aeration got its start in Minnesota on Lake Shetek when an aeration system was installed in the mid 1970's in both the north and south lake.  Whether via aeration or through climate change or both, there have been limited frequency and severity of winterkills since the 1970's.  However, during the winter of 2022-2023 there was a moderate winterkill on Lake Shetek.  Additionally, connected lakes, Bloody Lake and Smith Lake, also experienced winterkill. Given the importance of Lake Shetek as one of the more popular fishing lakes in the area, and after live fish were observed in spring netting, it was determined that a follow-up summer fish survey be performed to determine the true extent of the winterkill. A survey was conducted the week of August 7, 2023 using 6 gill nets and 16 trap nets, 1 year after the last survey.  Lake Shetek is managed primarily for Walleye and secondarily for Black Crappie, Yellow Perch, and Northern Pike. Each species was observed in the pre and post-winterkill surveys and each is discussed below.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye <br> \n <br> \nWalleye are the most popular gamefish in Lake Shetek and the primary management species. Prior to the winterkill, the Walleye population was sampled at levels greater than the long term average of 14.8 per gill net since 2018.  Furthermore, the 2022 catch rate was 33.8 per gill net, the second highest gill net catch rate ever recorded. However, many Walleye in the 2022 sample were less than 15 inches with few fish greater than 15 inches.  The 2023 catch rate was also dominated by small fish, but did remain above the long-term average at 16.8 per gill net. Newly stocked Walleye dominated the catch rate with 11.8 per gill net as a result of a very successful spring stocking of Lower Mississippi Strain Walleye (Lake Sarah egg take). Even with the new abundant year class there was a 50% reduction observed in the gill net catch rate from 2022 to 2023. While a 50% total reduction is significant, the reduction in the number of Walleye greater than 9 inches caught in gill nets in 2022 to 2023 was reduced by 87%. Only 27 Walleye over 9 inches were sampled in 2023.  However, fall commercial seine hauls targeting Bigmouth Buffalo and Common Carp caught the second most adult Walleye in commercial gear over the past 23 years (450-500 individuals). All commercially caught Walleye were released as per MN DNR requirements. While the Walleye population did experience a major reduction as a result of the winterkill, there are many adult Walleye still in the lake and the abundant year class stocked in the spring of 2023 should result in many harvestable Walleye in 2 to 3 years. Health of the Walleye caught in the 2023 sample was very good, indicated by plump fish. While the Lake Shetek Walleye population was reduced significantly from levels observed in 2022, the resulting catch rate of adult Walleye (5.0 per gill net) was similar to catches observed in the mid 2000's and 2010's indicating similar abundances to those observed in the past.  Walleye abundances naturally cycle from highs and lows, and the 2023 reduction in adult density appears to be temporary with a potentially successful newly stocked year class ready to take over.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie caught in gill nets and trap nets during the 2023 summer survey was mixed between lows and highs with only 0.33 per gill net but 10.25 per trap net. The gill net catch rate is a reduction from 4.33 per gill net in 2022 (92% decrease) but an increase from 1.33 per trap net (671% increase).  While the catch rates were mixed from before the winterkill, the number of adult Black Crappie did decrease in 2023. The average size of Black Crappie in trap nets was 8.1 inches (min-max = 6.1-12.7 inches) with many young fish in the 6 to 8 inch range present. Compared to 2022 (average = 9.4 inches), the average length in 2023 decreased 1.3 inches with the presence of an abundant young year class and a reduction in larger individuals. However, the Black Crappie population appears to have fared better than expected during the winter of 2022-2023. Typically Black Crappie tend to decrease substantially after a winterkill. The lack of decrease could be due in part to pre-spawn adult Black Crappie that were stocked in rearing ponds at Lake Shetek State Park, allowed to spawn naturally, and then the ponds were drained into Lake Shetek in June 2023. With all that stated, angler satisfaction is a major component of a successful fishery. While there was no formal angler creel on Lake Shetek, angling satisfaction for Black Crappie was much reduced with limited successful angling reports for larger crappie. Lake Shetek will need several years, without major disturbance, to return to population levels that were experienced by anglers from 2018-2021. In the meantime, crappie angling may be more sporadic, but healthy fish over 10 inches are still present and will provide an angling opportunity as well as continued potential of natural reproduction.  <br> \n  <br> \nYellow Perch   <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch were a bright spot within the post-winterkill survey in 2023 with a gill net catch rate of 17.33 per net and a trap net catch rate of 5.13 per net. Both the gill net and the trap net catch rates were the greatest observed since the 2002 survey (53.5 per gill net; 5.21 per trap net). Also, the gill net and trap net values were above the long-term averages of 11.0 per gill net and 2.6 per trap net. During 2023, there were many Yellow Perch in the 5.5 to 7.5 inch range with a few in the 9 to 10 inch range. Within the gill net sample, the average length was 7.3 inches with a range from 4.8 to 10.6 inches. Additionally, Yellow Perch in the gill net and trap net sample were healthy. Angling for Yellow Perch could be good over the next several years with decent numbers of healthy 9-10 inch fish present. Yellow Perch over 10 inches are becoming increasingly rare in Minnesota and Lake Shetek could become a place where that mark is met, and exceeded in the next year or two.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike         <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike were in low abundance prior to the winterkill. During the 2023 survey the trap net catch rate remained low at 1.19 per net, but the gill net catch rate increased to 4.33 per net.  The increase in the gill net catch rate is a result of a new large year class of fish (9.0 to 12.0 inches in August).  Northern Pike reproduction was good within the lake and connected waterbodies and was probably not from stocking.  There is a rearing pond that is privately operated that is connected to Bloody Lake (a connected waterbody to Lake Shetek).  Private operation is done in conjunction with advice from DNR staff in order to net pre-spawn broodstock from Bloody Lake that migrate up to a dam.  Fish are collected and stocked into a pond above the dam and allowed to spawn naturally.  Young fish, and broodstock adults, are then drained out of the pond and into Bloody Lake in June.  It is possible that this operation helped in part to boost the population in Lake Shetek. No Northern Pike greater than 24 inches were sampled in gill nets, but 2 adult Northern Pike (26.0 and 33.0 inches) were caught in trap nets, indicating the presence of broodstock remains in Lake Shetek.  The Northern Pike population appears poised for an increase in abundance not seen for over 20 years.  The winterkill experienced in Lake Shetek may have opened a void that was partially filled by Northern Pike.  These new Northern Pike should help to predate undesirable species such as Common Carp and Bigmouth Buffalo. Common Carp are a non-native nuisance species and Bigmouth Buffalo, while native, can also overpopulate and lead to habitat degradation. An increase in Northern Pike abundance in Lake Shetek will reap huge benefits for the overall fish community, and add a bonus fishing opportunity for anglers.      <br> \n       <br> \nOther Species <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled during post-winterkill sampling in 2023 were Channel Catfish, Common Carp, Bigmouth Buffalo, Quillback Carpsucker, Black Bullhead, Bluegill, Orangespotted Sunfish, White Sucker, and Yellow Bullhead. The only species sampled pre-winterkill (2022) that was not sampled in 2023 was White Crappie. Bluegill numbers were reduced from 7 in 2022 to 1 in 2023.  Bigmouth Buffalo increased in trap nets from 16 to 79 individuals but decreased from 31 to 17 individuals in gill nets.  The only other species that seemed to be impacted by the winterkill was Channel Catfish.  Channel Catfish catch rates were reduced 97% from 63 in 2022 to only 4 in 2023.  All Channel Catfish sampled in 2023 were larger than 23 inches indicating a potential significant loss of juvenile Channel Catfish as a result of the winterkill.  Fall Commercial angling in 2023 seemed to corroborate this as adult Channel Catfish bycatch was present but much lower abundance than prior years.  However, Bigmouth Buffalo commercial harvest was the greatest in 23 years with over 200,000 pounds removed.  Common Carp harvest was typical, indicating little substantial change in abundance from pre to post-winterkill, even with large numbers of dead fish observed along the shoreline.   <br> \n <br> \nSummary <br> \n <br> \nThe 2022 to 2023 survey changes indicate that winterkill impacts are not well understood and that robust fish populations can exists post winterkill.  However, stocking subsequent to winterkill is imperative to help young gamefish have a competitive advantage.  If gamefish are not stocked, non-desirable fish could dominate. This was seen in the history of Lake Shetek with abundant Black Bullhead populations. Presently, Lake Shetek is well suited for a rebound of Walleye, Northern Pike, Yellow Perch, and Black Crappie with successful angling over the next several years.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>INTRODUCTION <br> \n <br> \nCovering 3,596 acres, Lake Shetek is the largest lake in the Windom Fisheries Management Area that covers the southern half of Lincoln and Lyon counties as well as all of Pipestone, Murray, Cottonwood, Watonwan, Rock, Nobles, Jackson, and Martin Counties.  Lake Shetek has a shoreline length of nearly 32 miles, a maximum depth of 10 feet with a sand and gravel bottom without many submerged aquatic plants.  The immediate shoreline is covered primarily by woodland areas, and the majority of the surrounding watershed is in cropland.  Lake Shetek State Park is located on the eastern shoreline with public camping, walking trails, and public water access including canoe rental (park pass required for entry or daily entry fee applies).  Lake Shetek is managed for walleye, black crappie, yellow perch, and northern pike.  A netting survey was conducted in August, 2012 to assess the fish population.   <br> \n <br> \nWALLEYE <br> \n <br> \nGill nets are the best indicator of walleye abundance and size structure in a lake.  The walleye catch rate in 2012 was just over 5 fish per gill net which is considered normal for Lake Shetek.  Walleye caught in the nets ranged in length from 8 to 22 inches with an average length of 14 inches.  The size structure of the walleye caught in the nets indicated that 79% of the walleye in the lake are larger than 15 inches.  A large proportion of bigger walleye is good for anglers, but more small walleye are needed to sustain the population.   Some natural reproduction does occur in Lake Shetek, but the majority of the walleye are stocked.  Walleye fry are stocked into Lake Shetek 2 out of every 3 years with 3.6 million fry at each stocking.  This stocking rotation was started in 2010 with walleye fry stocked in 2010 and 2011 while 2012 was the first blank year in the stocking.  Blank years in the stocking rotation help the health of the overall walleye population in a lake.  As more fish are stocked into a lake there become more mouths to feed which can lead to too much competition for minnows and other small prey items leading to a stunted and malnourished walleye population.  Additionally, less walleye feeding on minnows and small prey leads to more abundant minnow and prey fish populations for the next year when walleye are stocked again.  This relationship between blank years and prey abundance is observed in lakes that are not stocked and natural reproduction is sufficient to sustain the population.  There are years of good natural reproduction followed by one or sometimes several years of poor or no successful natural reproduction and these cycles create naturally healthy walleye populations.  When following a natural cycle like this in stocking, the walleye populations tend to be healthier and healthier fish feed more, which corresponds to more action at the end of an anglers' line!  Fishing for walleye in Lake Shetek has been good and indications from the 2012 survey suggest that fishing will remain good for Lake Shetek over the next 2 to 3 years as the fish in the lake grow and as additional walleye fry are stocked in 2013 and 2014. <br> \n <br> \nYELLOW PERCH <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch abundance has varied widely from nearly 0 per gill net in in 1980s to above 50 per gill net in the 1990s with stocking occurring in the 1980s to boost the population.  Currently, the yellow perch gill net catch rate was just below 9 fish per net which was considered normal for a lake like Lake Shetek but still below the long-term average of 14 fish per gill net.  The yellow perch caught in the nets ranged from 5 to 11 inches with an average length of 7 inches.  Fish in the sample appeared healthy indicating good growth with no stress due to foraging.  The yellow perch size structure appears to be improving and the population should contain good numbers of both small and large fish over the next 2 to 3 years.  Continued monitoring of the yellow perch abundance will occur to make sure the population expands and the size structure improves.  Stocking with adult yellow perch will occur again if the population falls below 3 fish per gill net for 2 consecutive surveys.  A healthy yellow perch population with many small and large fish is crucial to the walleye and northern pike populations as well as the anglers' who enjoy fishing for them.  Currently, the yellow perch population is doing better than it has been over the past 5 years and fishing should reflect that for the next several years with more perch caught by anglers. <br> \n <br> \nBLACK CRAPPIE <br> \n <br> \nTwo species of crappie call Lake Shetek home, white crappie and black crappie.  In 2012, 220 crappies were collected in the nets.  White crappie were less abundant than black crappie which is common for Lake Shetek with only 21 white crappie caught compared to 199 black crappie.  The white crappie catch rates were less than 1 fish per gill net and just above 1 fish per trap net.  The gill net catch rate was below normal while the trap net catch rate was within the normal range.  White crappie sampled ranged in length from 4 to 8 inches with a mean length of 6.5 inches.  While white crappie are not a large part of the fish community, the black crappie population has increased steadily since 2006.  The current gill net catch rate is just under 10 fish per net which is near the upper normal range as is the trap net catch rate of nearly 8 fish per net.  The average length of black crappie in the sample was 7 inches with fish ranging in length from 5 to 12 inches.  The population of white and black crappie have a good range of sizes with both mature and immature fish present.  Likewise, both white and black crappie in the sample were in excellent health indicating low or no stress due to foraging for food.  Overall, it appears that the healthy crappie population in Lake Shetek is on the rise with many plump fish in the 6 to 8 inch range and angling for crappie should improve as the population remains at a higher abundance over the next several years.   <br> \n  <br> \nNORTHERN PIKE <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike are maintained by stocking in Lake Shetek.  Natural reproduction was common in the lake less than 40 years ago, but today many of the spawning runs are now fragmented or disconnected.  Recent stocking of pre-spawn male and female northern pike into connected ponds that have favorable spawning conditions has helped to jump start the northern pike population.  Some northern pike in Lake Shetek are now observed returning to historical spawning runs and some natural reproduction may again be occurring.  The northern pike catch trap net catch rate in 2012 was just above 0.5 fish per trap net which is near the long-term trap net catch rate of just under 1 fish per trap net and the gill net catch rate in 2012 was just below 0.5 fish per gill net which is above the long-term catch rate of 0.2 fish per gill net.  Northern pike caught in the sample ranged in length from 19 to 32 inches with a mean length of 22 inches in the gill nets and 25 inches in the trap nets.  The size of fish in the sample indicates that nearly 25% of the northern pike in the lake are larger than 28 inches.  Additionally, the health of the northern pike in the sample was fair indicating a population that is finding a way to survive and may be helped with additional prey and improved habitat.  Overall, the northern pike population appears to be doing better than it has in the past and the pike abundance appears to be increasing and should continue to increase with additional stocking and reconnection of historical spawning runs that contain critical habitat.  Anglers looking to target northern pike in southwestern Minnesota may find Lake Shetek as an unexpected gem in the near future if conditions continue to improve. <br> \n <br> \nOTHER SPECIES <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled in Lake Shetek in 2012 using gill nets, trap nets, back-pack electrofishing, and small mesh seines included bigmouth buffalo, black bullhead, bluegill, bluntnose minnow, brown bullhead, common carp, common shiner, channel catfish, fathead minnow, johnny darter, mimic shiner, orangespotted sunfish, quillback sucker, spotfin shiner, tadpole madtom, white sucker, and yellow bullhead.  Including the managed species such as walleye, yellow perch, crappie, and northern pike there were a total of 22 species sampled in Lake Shetek in 2012.  Twenty-two species in 1 lake is rare even in more pristine northern Minnesota Lakes.  With such a high diversity of fish, Lake Shetek is a one-of-a-kind lake in southwestern Minnesota.    <br> \n <br> \nSUMMARY <br> \n <br> \nLake Shetek appears to contain a balanced fish community with a good number of predators and prey species to maintain itself with the current management plan.  Any changes in the management of Lake Shetek should focus on increased connectivity of historical spawning runs for northern pike.  Northern pike appear poised to make a comeback in Lake Shetek and any improvements in the watershed would help to improve conditions for the fish.  Better land use practices within the watershed should also be considered to increase the water quality and clarity within the lake for improved habitat benefits.  Southwestern Minnesota anglers will be satisfied with their angling experience in Lake Shetek over the next several years (barring any summer or winter fish kills) as good numbers of managed game species are present in the lake. <br> \n <br> \nPrepared by Nate Hodgins <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Shetek is a 3,596-acre, class 41 lake, located in Murray County and is the largest lake in the Windom fisheries management area. The lake has a maximum depth of 10.0 ft. and typically has poor water quality likely a result from its agricultural watershed.  Lake Shetek is managed primarily for Walleye and secondarily for Black Crappie, Yellow Perch, and Northern Pike.  Lake Shetek was stocked with Lower Mississippi Strain Walleye fry in 2017, 2019, and in 2021 in an effort to get this strain established in additional lakes.  Lake Shetek was selected because it has traditionally supported a good Walleye population and has historically had sporadic natural reproduction and thus likely has habitat for spawning walleye providing environmental conditions are conducive to natural reproduction.  A natural reproduction check was conducted on October 10, 2022 to determine if natural reproduction occurred in Lake Shetek.    <br> \n <br> \nAge-0 Walleye were captured at a rate of 226.0 per hour of electrofishing, which indicates that natural reproduction occurred in Lake Shetek.  Analysis of fall electrofishing data has indicated that a catch rate of less than 20.0 per hour often times does not produce a year class, and that a catch rate of more than 20.0 per hour could produce a strong year class but it's not certain.  The age-0 Walleyes ranged in length from 6.4 to 9.5 inches and averaged 7.7 inches.  Fin clips were taken to verify the genetic strain of the 2022 year class.  Multiple genetic strains of Walleye contributed the 2022 naturally reproduced year class, as LMS was the most persistent accounting for 42 percent of the sampled fingerlings, followed by Spicer strain (20 percent), and Red River strain (11 percent).  Other strains were present, but accounted for 9 percent or less of the sample.  Walleye in Lake Shetek have produced natural year classes in non-stocked years in 2020 (118.8 per hour) and 2022 (226.0 per hour).  The 2022 year class should be a strong year class in the Lake Shetek Walleye population. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Shetek is a 3,596-acre, class 41 lake, located in Murray County and is the largest lake in the Windom fisheries management area. The lake has a maximum depth of 10.0 ft. and has poor water quality resulting from its many years of a disturbed watershed. According to Watershed Health Assessment Framework for Lakes (WHAFL), Lake Shetek has a D+ grade with a disturbance of 75% within the watershed. The watershed contributing flow to Lake Shetek is 83,121 upland acres resulting in a watershed-to-lake ratio of 23-to-1.  A watershed-to-lake ratio of 23-to-1 is high and indicates that negative impacts within the watershed will lead to disturbed conditions within the lake. Nutrient reduction from the watershed, specifically phosphorus, is a key goal to improve within lake conditions and reduce stress on the fish within the lake. Low dissolved oxygen during winter months is another stress that is experienced in shallow southwest Minnesota lakes, including Lake Shetek. Winter aeration got its start in Minnesota on Lake Shetek when an aeration system was installed in the mid 1970's in both the north and south lake to combat low winter oxygen.  Whether via aeration or through climate change or both, there have been limited frequency and severity of winterkills since the 1970's.  However, during the winter of 2022-2023 there was a moderate winterkill on Lake Shetek.  Additionally, connected lakes, Bloody Lake and Smith Lake, also experienced winterkill. A spring gill net survey was conducted the week of May 8, 2023 using 2 gill nets to determine the number of species still alive after the 2022-2023 winterkill.   <br> \n <br> \nOne gill net was set in the north basin of Lake Shetek and 1 gill net was set in the south basin. Five species of fish were captured in the gill net samples; Black Bullhead, Northern Pike, Quillback Carpsucker, Walleye, and Yellow Perch.  Black Bullhead had a catch rate of 11.5 per gill net with fish ranging from 7.7 to 12.7 inches. Northern Pike had a catch rate of 1.0 per gill net with a 13.7 inch and a 23.2 inch specimen. No Quillback Carpsucker were measured, but the catch rate was 0.5 per gill net. Walleye had a catch rate of 7.0 per gill net with fish ranging from 7.9 inches to 16.2 inches.  Most Walleye were over 12 inches with 5 fish in the 12-13 inch range and 6 fish in the 14 to 17 inch range.  Yellow Perch had a catch rate of 5.5 per gill net with fish ranging from 6.3 to 11.3 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nWhile these 5 species were found alive, and in decent condition, it was determined to conduct a standard summer survey during the first week of August to truly assess the fish community and compare to past surveys conducted during the same time of year. However, it appeared that Lake Shetek experienced only a moderate winterkill with important gamefish remaining.    <br> \n</p>",

NATURAL RECRUITMENT OF WAE HAS BEEN WELL DOCUMENTED FROM SHORELINE SEINING AND SURVEY DATA.  THREE OF THE FIVE YEAR CLASS OBSERVED DURING THE SURVEY WERE FROM NATURAL REPRODUCTION, HOWEVER THE TWO STRONGEST YEAR CLASSES WERE FROM YEARS WAE FRY WERE STOCKED, INDICATING FRY STOCKING DOES STRENGTHEN THE YEAR CLASS.  THE BLC POPULATION APPEARS TO BE DOMINATED BY AGE 1 AND 2 FISH.  TRAP NET CATCH INDICES FOR BLC FALL BETWEEN THE FIRST AND THIRD QUARTILE FOR LAKE CLASS 40 INDICATING A NORMAL POPULATION.  GILL NET CATCH INDICES FOR YEP FALL BETWEEN THE FIRST AND THIRD QUARTILE A NORMAL POPULATION.  GILL NET INDICES FOR YEP INCREASED FROM 2.0 FISH PER GILL NET IN 1988 TO 25.4 FISH PER GILL NET IN 1992.  THIS INCREASE MAY BE ATTRIBUTED TO THE 1600 LBS OF YEP STOCKED IN 1990.  TRAP NET CATCH INDICES FOR BLB WERE ABOUT SEVEN TIMES THE UPPER END OF THE NORMAL RANGE, INDICATING A HIGH POPULATION FOR LAKE CLASS 40. TRAP NET CATCH INDICES FOR BLB INCREASED FROM 37.1 FISH PER TRAP NET IN 1988 TO 520 FISH PER NET IN 1992.  THE INCREASE IN THE YEP POPULATION AND THE DECREASE IN THE NUMBER OF BLB REMOVED BY COMMERCIAL FISHERMAN IN THE WINTER PRIOR TO THE SURVEY MAY HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THE INCREASE IN BLB.  ONLY 2500 LBS OF BLB WERE REMOVED DURING THE WINTER OF 1991-92.  AN AVERAGE OF 20,000 LBS OF BLB WERE REMOVED EACH YEAR FROM 1988-1990.  A TOTAL OF 1,560,000 LBS OF BUFFALO, CARP AND BLB WERE REMOVED FROM 1988-1991 (116 LBS/ACRE/YEAR). 1992 SHORELINE SEINING RESULTS INDICATE NATURAL REPRODUCTION OF YEP AND BLC.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Shetek is a shallow prairie lake located five miles north of Slayton.  At different times over the years, Lake Shetek has produced good black crappie, bullhead, northern pike, walleye, and yellow perch fishing.  The lake is managed for walleye as the primary species with black crappie, northern pike, and yellow perch as secondary species.The walleye population in Lake Shetek looked good in 1998.  The management goal for walleye numbers on Lake Shetek was easily attained.  When compared to lakes similar to Lake Shetek, walleye numbers were higher than 75% of other lakes.  Walleye ranged from 7.3 to 28.3 inches and averaged 11.3 inches.  Since 91% of the walleye collected in 1998 were less than 15 inches, angling should be very good for the next few years.  However, as with any fishing, if the walleye have abundant prey to eat, it will make them more difficult to catch.Yellow perch populations often fluctuate from year to year.  Spring weather conditions, water levels, and the other species in the lake all affect the success of a given year class.  In 1998, yellow perch numbers were similar to the two previous assessments.  Yellow perch ranged from 5.7 to 10.2 inches and averaged 8.0 inches.  Yellow perch should provide satisfactory fishing for the next few years.In 1998, black crappie numbers were the highest since 1983.  Black crappie numbers were higher than 75% of lakes similar to Lake Shetek.  Lake Shetek has some large black crappies but 79% of the fish were from strong 1996 and 1997 year classes.  Black crappie ranged from 5.0 to 11.4 inches and averaged 8.2 inches.  It should take a year or two before fish from the strong 1996 and 1997 year classes reach a size that interest anglers.   Lake Shetek supports a moderate population of black bullhead.  Black bullhead ranged from 6 to 12 inches and averaged about 9.5 inches.  Anglers interested in black bullhead should have no problem finding them on Lake Shetek.  To promote and maintain healthy fish populations, pollution needs to be controlled.  Fish habitat is directly affected by water quality.  Nutrients, sediments and other waste can drastically alter the chemical and physical characteristics of a lake.  It is important to maintain, if not improve, the water quality of Lake Shetek through watershed management.  Improved land use practices should insure that this fishery can be enjoyed by future generations.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>INTRODUCTION <br> \nLake Shetek is a 3,596-acre lake located north of the City of Currie in Murray County. Lake Shetek is the largest lake in the Windom fisheries management area, as the shoreline length stretches 31.7 miles and depths reach a maximum of 10.0 feet. Lake Shetek's watershed to lake ratio is 23 to 1 with the immediate shoreline being covered primarily by woodland areas and the rest of the watershed being agricultural. The poor water quality in Lake Shetek (secchi depth=1.0 feet) is likely a result of agricultural runoff, which is rich in nutrients that cause algae blooms throughout the year. Because of the turbid water in Lake Shetek, aquatic vegetation is sparse. Fish habitat is mostly limited to rocky shorelines, rock reefs, sand flats, mud flats, and fallen trees along the shoreline. Winterkill has been limited in Lake Shetek since installation of the aeration systems in the mid 1970's. Lake Shetek is managed primarily for Walleye and secondarily for Black Crappie, Yellow Perch, and Northern Pike. The Walleye population is maintained through stocking fry 2 out of 3 years (2010, 2011, 2013, 2014, 2016, and 2017). The Northern Pike population is maintained through stocking when Northern Pike fingerlings are available (2010, and 2012). Additionally, connected rearing ponds are stocked with pre-spawn adult Northern Pike, and then fingerlings are drained into water bodies that are connected to the lake. A population assessment was conducted during the week of August 4, 2014 to monitor Lake Shetek's fish populations.  <br> \n <br> \nWALLEYE <br> \nWalleye catch rates have varied from 2.8 per gill net in 2007 to 43.2 per gill net in 1992, and have averaged 12.9 per gill net since surveys began in 1983. In 2014, Walleye were captured at a rate of 5.8 per gill net, a slight increase from the 2012 catch rate of 5.1 per gill net, and within the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (3.2 to 15.3 per gill net). The 2014 trap net catch rate of 1.7 per trap net slightly exceeded the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (0.3 to 1.7 per trap net). The average length of Walleye captured in gill nets was 13.9 inches and in trap nets was 16.0 inches, with fish ranging from 6.7 to 23.5 inches. A population abundance model was used to estimate a theoretical 2014 population estimate for Lake Shetek based on gill net catches of Walleye. The model estimated that there are potentially 70,689 Walleyes in Lake Shetek. Ages of Walleye were estimated using otoliths. Of the 34 Walleye aged, six year classes were sampled including 2013 (age-1), 2012 (age-2), 2011 (age-3), 2009 (age-5), 2008 (age-6), and 2007 (age-7). Year classes from 2007, 2008, 2011, and 2013 correspond to years in which fry stocking occurred. Walleye fry were not stocked in 2009 or 2012 suggesting that some degree of natural reproduction occurs in Lake Shetek. Average lengths at age were estimated (8.4 inches at age-1, 12.6 inches at age-2, 15.3 inches at age-3, 16.7 inches at age-4, 18.8 inches at age-5, 19.4 inches at age-6 and 21.2 inches at age-7) and showed that growth of Walleye to age-4 was slow compared to other Walleye populations from similar lakes. Growth of Walleye beyond age-4 appeared to be slightly faster than similar lakes. Walleye were somewhat skinny, suggesting that the low abundance of prey species, particularly Yellow Perch, may be negatively impacting Walleye condition in Lake Shetek. The current stocking regime of stocking fry two out of three years along with occasional natural reproduction appears to be effective at keeping multiple year classes of Walleye in Lake Shetek. During the winter of 2014-2015, anglers have reported catching many Walleye fingerlings, which suggests that a strong year class may have been produced by the 2014 fry stocking. In addition, anglers have reported excellent fishing for larger Walleyes during the winter of 2014-2015. <br> \n <br> \nNORTHERN PIKE <br> \nNorthern Pike abundance has steadily increased in gill nets and trap nets since 2010. In gill nets, catch rates have increased from 0.2 per gill net to 0.4 per gill net, to 0.5 per gill net in 2010, 2012, and 2014, respectively. In trap nets, catch rates have increased from 0.3 per trap net to 0.6 per trap net to 0.8 per trap net in 2010, 2012, and 2014, respectively. Despite increasing catch rates, the gill net catch rate is still below the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (1.2 to 7.8 per gill net). Lengths of Northern Pike ranged from 16.1 to 28.8 inches and averaged 20.5 inches in gill nets and 21.7 inches in trap nets. Poor water quality and sparse prey fish populations appear to be limiting Northern Pike size in Lake Shetek, as sampled Northern Pike were skinny. Northern Pike are maintained through stocking. Natural reproduction was common in the lake less than 40 years ago, but presently, many of the spawning runs are fragmented or disconnected. Currently, pre-spawn adult Northern Pike are stocked into connected rearing ponds and allowed to reproduce. After a period of growth, Northern Pike fingerlings are drained into connected water bodies, with the ultimate goal of reestablishing some of Lake Shetek's Northern Pike spawning runs.  <br> \n <br> \nYELLOW PERCH <br> \nThe 2014 catch rate of 0.0 per gill net is the lowest observed catch rate of Yellow Perch in Lake Shetek, and is below the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (3.0 to 22.5 per gill net). The 2014 catch rate of 0.0 is a significant decrease from the 8.9 per gill net observed in 2012. Four Yellow Perch were captured in trap nets (0.3 per trap net), which is also the lowest catch rate observed for Yellow Perch in trap nets. Catch rates of Yellow Perch have been low since 2006 with catch rates less than 2.5 per gill net in all years except 2010 (4.0 per gill net) and 2012 (8.9 per gill net). The Yellow Perch sampled in the trap nets were small, ranging from 4.6 to 5.6 inches in length. Yellow Perch and Black Bullhead are likely the main prey resource for Walleye and Northern Pike in Lake Shetek. Maintenance of the Yellow Perch population is crucial to maintaining these predator populations. If the Yellow Perch catch rate is below expected levels again during the 2016 survey, pre-spawn adult Yellow Perch may be stocked to increase the brood stock in Lake Shetek.   <br> \n <br> \nCRAPPIE <br> \nBlack Crappie catch rate have been fairly stable in Lake Shetek (2.3 per trap net in 2008 to 15.2 per trap net in 1988), with the exception of 1983 and 2002, when catch rates were 38.9 and 119.9 per trap net, respectively. In 2014, the Black Crappie catch rate was 6.4 per trap net, which is within the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (1.0 to 12.3 per trap net). Black Crappie ranged in length from 4.8 to 13.0 inches and averaged 7.3 inches. A strong year class of crappie 4.5 to 6.5 inches in length is present and represented 62 and 78 percent of Black Crappie sampled in trap nets and gill nets, respectively. Black Crappie were plump, indicating an abundant prey base for Black Crappie.  <br> \n <br> \nWhite Crappie have historically occurred in low abundance in Lake Shetek (less than 1.2 per trap net since 1988). In 2014, White Crappie were captured at a rate of 0.5 per trap net. White Crappie ranged in length from 6.7 to 13.2 inches and averaged 8.7 inches. While the two species of crappie can coexist, one of the species will usually do better than the other, and in this instance, it appears that Black Crappie have historically been more abundant than White Crappie in Lake Shetek.  <br> \n <br> \nBLACK BULLHEAD <br> \nBlack Bullhead abundance has steadily increased from 2.5 per gill net in 2009 to 5.7 per gill net in 2010 to 16.3 per gill net in 2012 to 22.8 per gill net in 2014. The 2014 catch rate of 22.8 per gill net is within the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (4.6 to 83.0 per gill net), and is the highest observed catch rate since 2002. Black Bullhead abundance is likely a function of Channel Catfish abundance, as Black Bullhead are the preferred prey of Channel Catfish. Black Bullhead ranged in length from 5.4 to 10.8 inches and averaged 8.6 inches. The Black Bullhead population should stay in check as long as Channel Catfish remain in the system.  <br> \n <br> \nCHANNEL CATFISH <br> \nChannel Catfish abundance increased from 4.8 per gill net in 2012 to 7.3 per gill net in 2014, which is above the long term average of 4.6 per gill net, but below the all-time high catch rate of 11.8 in 2006. Channel Catfish ranged in length from 12.0 to 28.4 inches and averaged 17.7 inches. Channel Catfish appear to have a large impact on the prey base in Lake Shetek. Channel Catfish abundance has remained relatively high since 2006 and consequently, Yellow Perch and Black Bullhead abundance has remained relatively low.  <br> \n <br> \nOTHER SPECIES <br> \nBigmouth Buffalo abundance decreased from 6.3 per gill net in 2012 to 3.5 per gill net in 2014, which is within the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (0.3 to 6.1 per gill net). Lengths of Bigmouth Buffalo ranged from 13.9 to 24.4 inches in length and averaged 19.3 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nCommon Carp abundance remained similar to the 2012 catch rate of 1.7 per trap net, as they were captured at a rate of 1.6 per trap net in 2014, which is within the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (0.7 to 5.1 per trap net). Lengths of Common Carp ranged from 18.9 to 32.1 inches and averaged 24.8 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled in low abundance include White Sucker, Yellow Bullhead, and Quillback.  <br> \n <br> \nPlants in the water and at the water's edge provide habitat, prevent erosion, and absorb excess nutrients.  Shrubs, trees, and woody debris such as fallen trees or limbs provide good habitat both above and below the water and should be left in place.  By leaving a buffer strip of natural vegetation along the shoreline, property owners can reduce erosion, help maintain or improve water quality, and provide habitat and travel corridors for wildlife. <br> \n <br> \nBest management practices within the watershed (no-till farming, cover crops, buffer strips, targeted fertilizer application, reduced or metered tiling) would help reduce nutrients entering the lake. High nutrient and sediment input can cause algae blooms and reduce overall water quality. Any improvements in the watershed are likely to have positive impacts on the fishery. <br> \n <br> \nPrepared by Jonah Dagel <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Shetek is a 3,596-acre, class 41 lake, located in Murray County and is the largest lake in the Windom fisheries management area. The lake has a maximum depth of 10.0 ft. and typically has poor water quality likely a result from its agricultural watershed.  Lake Shetek is managed primarily for Walleye and secondarily for Black Crappie, Yellow Perch, and Northern Pike.  Lake Shetek was stocked with Lower Mississippi Strain Walleye fry in 2017 and 2019 in an effort to get this strain established in additional lakes.  LMS Walleye are present in Murray County's Lake Sarah, a lake that hasn't been stocked since 1991 because the Walleye population is sustained at high levels through natural reproduction.  Lake Shetek was selected because it has traditionally supported a good Walleye population and has historically had sporadic natural reproduction and thus likely has habitat for spawning walleye providing environmental conditions are conducive to natural reproduction.  Due to safety issues surrounding COVID-19, Walleye eggs were not taken in Minnesota in 2020, thus no stocking of age-0 Walleye occurred in the Windom management area.  A natural reproduction check was conducted on October 12, 2020 to determine if natural reproduction occurred in Lake Shetek.    <br> \n <br> \nYoung-of-the year Walleye were captured at a rate of 118.8 per hour of electrofishing, which indicates that natural reproduction occurred in Lake Shetek.  Analysis of fall electrofishing data has indicated that a catch rate of less than 20.0 per hour often times does not produce a year class, and that a catch rate of more than 20.0 per hour may produce a strong year class but it's not certain.  The age-0 Walleyes ranged in length from 6.9 to 9.8 inches and averaged 8.4 inches.  Fin clips were taken to verify the genetic strain of the 2020 year class.  Multiple genetic strains of Walleye contributed the 2020 naturally reproduced year class, as LMS was the most persistent accounting for 42 percent of the sampled fingerlings, followed by Spicer strain (20 percent), and Red River strain (11 percent).  Other strains were present, but accounted for 9 percent or less of the sample.  The 2020 year class should be a strong year class in the Lake Shetek Walleye population.   <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Covering 3808 acres, Lake Shetek is the largest lake in the Windom Area.  The Lake has a shoreline length of 31.7 miles and a maximum depth of 10 feet.  The immediate shoreline is covered primarily by woodland areas, and the majority of the surrounding watershed is cultivated.  Shoalwater areas are dominated by sand and gravel substrate.  As with most lakes in the Windom Area, aquatic vegetation is considered sparse.  Lake Shetek is managed primarily for walleye while providing secondary populations of yellow perch and black crappie.Walleye numbers are considered normal compared to similar lakes in our area.  Walleye sampled in gillnets ranged in length from 10 ? to more than 27 inches with an average length of approximately 18 inches.  The walleye population is dominated by quality sized fish with some walleye reaching memorable lengths (25+ inches).  The walleye population appears to be supported by a combination of natural reproduction, immigration, and stocking.  Lake Shetek was stocked with walleye fry in 1991, 1992, and 1996.Yellow perch numbers are considered high.  Perch collected in gillnets ranged in length from 5 to almost 10 inches with an average length of approximately 7 inches.  The population is comprised mainly of small fish.  In time, the population should provide anglers with good numbers of quality sized fish (greater than 8 inches).  The present yellow perch population appears healthy and self-supporting.  Perch were last stocked in 1990.Black crappie numbers are considered normal compared to similar lakes in our area.  Black crappie collected in trapnets ranged in length from 5 ? to more than 14 ? inches with an average length of approximately 8 inches.  The population is dominated by quality sized fish (8-9 inches).  The black crappie population appears healthy and self-supporting.  Black crappie have not been stocked in recent years.White crappie numbers are considered low.  White crappie collected in trapnets ranged in length from 6 to almost 10 ? inches with an average length of 8 inches.  Although low in numbers, the white crappie population appears healthy and self-supporting.    Northern pike numbers are considered normal compared to similar lakes in our area.  Pike collected in trapnets ranged in length from 14 ? to more than 30 ? inches with an average length of almost 19 ? inches.  The present pike population appears healthy and self-supporting.   Northern pike prefer flooded marsh areas for spawning.  Low water levels experienced during the late 1980's appeared to negatively affect northern pike numbers.  The decline may be attributed to a loss of suitable spawning habitat during these years.  Subsequently, northern pike adults were stocked in 1993 to bolster the population.Black bullhead and yellow bullhead numbers are considered normal.  Black bullhead collected in trapnets ranged in length from 4 ? to over 12 inches with an average length of approximately 8 inches.  Yellow bullhead sampled in trapnets ranged in length from 7 to more than 12 ? inches with an average length of approximately 9 ? inches.Commercial species have been removed from Lake Shetek for 30 consecutive years.  Commercial fishermen removed 444,281 pounds of carp and 578, 995 pounds of bigmouth buffalo since 1992.Other species observed during the 1996 survey include channel catfish, bluegill, orangespotted sunfish, white sucker, quillback sucker, johnny darter, and fathead minnow. To promote and maintain a healthy fish population, pollution and other inputs need to be controlled.  Fish habitat is directly affected by water quality.  Nutrient, sediment and other waste inputs can drastically alter the chemical and physical components of a Lake.  It is paramount to maintain if not improve the current water quality of Lake Shetek through watershed management to preserve this fishery for future generations to enjoy.   </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Covering 3,596 acres, Lake Shetek is the largest lake in the Windom Area.  The lake is located near Currie in Murray County and has 31.7 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 10 feet.  The lake has a history of providing good angling opportunities for walleye, northern pike, yellow perch, and black crappie.  The lake is presently managed for walleye as the primary species while northern pike, yellow perch, and black crappie are managed secondarily.Lake Shetek has a very good walleye population when compared to lakes similar to Shetek.  Lengths of walleye captured in our gill nets during our survey ranged from 7.2 to 23.2 inches and averaged 12.6 inches.  The longest walleye captured was in a trap net and was 26.9 inches in length.  The lake is stocked with walleye fry but natural reproduction has also been well documented.  Walleye from age one through age seven were captured during the survey.Shetek also has a high perch population when compared to lakes similar to Shetek.  Lengths ranged from 5.4 to 9.1 inches and averaged 6.9 inches.  The fish are on the smaller size because many of them are only age one this year.  The poplation should provide good angling opportunities next summer and winter.The black crappie population is very high when compared to other lakes like Shetek.  Lengths ranged from 5.0 to 13.7 inches and averaged 7.0 inches.  The majority of the population was one year old this year.  The high number of young fish coming up should provide good angling opportunities in future years.The northern pike population is low when compared to other lakes like Shetek.  We only sampled one age group during our survey.  The Windom Division of Fisheries is however making an effort to enhance the existing population in Shetek.  Adult northern pike were stocked in 2002 and additional northern pike will be stocked in the future.The black bullhead population is similar to other lakes like Shetek.  Lengths ranged from 4.7 to 13.1 inches and averaged 10.7 inches.If channel catfish is what you're after, Shetek has a fair population to offer.  Lengths ranged from 6.7 to 27.0 inches and averaged just under 10 inches.To promote and maintain healthy fish populations, pollution and other inputs need to be controlled.  Fish habitats are directly affected by water quality.  Nutrient, sediment and other waste inputs can drastically alter the biological, chemical, and physical components of a lake.  It is important to maintain if not improve the current water quality of Lake Shetek through watershed management to preserve this fishery for future generations to enjoy.    </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Covering 3,596 acres, Lake Shetek is the largest lake in the Windom Area.  It has a shoreline length of 31.7 miles and a maximum depth of ten feet.  The immediate shoreline is covered primarily by woodland areas, and the majority of the surrounding watershed is cultivated.  The watershed-to-lake ratio is 23 to 1 indicating a large impact of the surrounding landuse to the lake.  Shoalwater areas are dominated by sand and gravel substrate.  As with most lakes in the Windom Area, aquatic vegetation is considered sparse.  Lake Shetek is a class 41 lake based on the above features, which is characteristic of southern Minnesota lakes.  Lake Shetek is managed primarily for walleye while providing secondary populations of black crappie, yellow perch, and northern pike.  A population assessment was conducted 9 August, 2010 to assess the fish community.   <br> \n <br> \nDuring the winter of 2009-2010 oxygen levels dropped to 1.6 parts per million (ppm) in the north half of Shetek and 1.0 ppm in the south half of the lake by the middle of February, 2010.  Fish experience stress due to oxygen deprivation at or below 5.0 ppm with conditions becoming critical at 2.0 ppm.   Many dead fish were observed after the ice went off the lake.  Trap nets were set in the north and south basins in April of 2010 to assess the severity of the winterkill.  Primary management species such as walleye, black crappie, yellow perch, and northern pike did not experience noticeable negative effects from the winterkill as they were all present in good numbers in the trap nets.  The August 2010 population assessment set out to determine the true impacts, if any, of the winterkill.  <br> \n <br> \nThe walleye catch rate during 2010 was 15.0 fish/gill net, which was near the upper expected range.  The long-term average gill net catch rate since 1983 is 14.3 fish/gill net; the current catch rate exceeds the long-term average as well as exceeding the management goal of maintaining more than 12 walleye/gill net.  In addition, the trap net catch rate was 7.3 fish/trap net which is over 4 times the upper expected range of 1.7 walleye/trap net.  Trap nets usually are not a good indication of walleye abundance, but when gill net and trap net catch rates are high, as was seen in 2010, the population abundance is usually high as well.  The average length of walleye was 13 inches and fish ranged in length from 10 to 22 inches.  The size structure of the population favored smaller fish.  The overall condition was fair and indicated that the walleye may have been experiencing some foraging stress.  With a winterkill during 2009-2010, it is possible that the forage base (minnows) for walleye was thinned out, leading to competition for remaining food.  The outlook remains good for the walleye population in Lake Shetek, minnow species usually rebound quickly which should allow for additional growth and an increase in the condition of the walleye.  In 2010, 6 age groups of walleye were present representing the 2009, 2008, 2007, 2006, 2005, and 1998 year classes.  The growth of walleye was fair with fish reaching 13 to 15 inches between ages 4 and 5.  A follow-up population assessment will be conducted during the summer of 2011 to monitor the walleye population and assess growth, overall condition, stocking plan (fry every 2 of 3 years with next blank year in 2012), and abundance of walleye.  The walleye population appears primed to make a comeback in Lake Shetek as the catch rates are high and in a few years the population will consist of larger fish. <br> \n <br> \nThe black crappie catch rates were 14.8 fish/trap net and 7.8 fish/gill net.  The 2010 trap net catch rate was higher than the upper expected value of 12.3 fish/trap net, and the gill net catch rate was within the expected range of 0.8 to 11.1 fish/gill net.  The average length of black crappie was 7.5 inches with a range of 3 to 11 inches.  The size structure of the black crappie indicated a population that has a balanced size structure with 33% of the black crappie larger than 8 inches and 12% larger than 10 inches.  The overall condition of the black crappie was excellent indicating a population of black crappie that is foraging successfully.  The black crappie population currently meets the management goal of maintaining a catch rate within the expected range.  Lake Shetek appears primed to have a good black crappie population with many fish larger than 8 inches and some 10 inch plus fish.  The next several years should hold an opportunity for good black crappie fishing.    <br> \n <br> \nThe yellow perch catch rates were 4.0 fish/gill net and 3.7 fish/trap net.  The 2010 gill net catch rate was within the expected range of 3.0 to 22.5 fish/gill net, and the trap net catch rate was higher than the expected catch rate of 2.6 fish/trap net and higher than the long-term average catch rate of 3.4 fish/trap net in Lake Shetek.  Yellow perch population abundance and size structure are best assessed with the gill net catch as yellow perch are most effectively caught with gill nets.  The average length of yellow perch in the gill nets was 8 inches and yellow perch ranged from 7.5 to 12 inches.  The size structure of the yellow perch indicated that the population was balanced and did not favor smaller or larger fish.  The overall condition of the yellow perch was good and indicated that the yellow perch were foraging successfully.  The yellow perch population currently meets the management goal of maintaining a catch rate within the expected range.  While the population abundance is near the lower end of the expected range, the size of yellow perch is good with 55% of the fish larger than 8 inches.  Fishing for yellow perch in Lake Shetek should be productive over the next couple years with the majority of the fish being larger than 8 inches with some 10 inch or larger.  <br> \n <br> \nThe 2010 northern pike catch rates were 0.2 fish/gill net and 0.3 fish/trap net.  The 2010 gill net catch rate was lower than the 25% quartile of 1.2 fish/gill net for lake class 41.  The average length of all northern pike was 26 inches and fish ranged from 20 to 35 inches.  The size structure indicated a population of northern pike that was dominated by larger fish with 80% of the fish being larger than 21 inches and 20% being larger than 35 inches.  While the average weight of northern pike was excellent at nearly 4 pounds per northern pike caught, which exceeded the expected range of 1.5 to 3 pounds, the overall condition was relatively low indicating a population of northern pike that may be experiencing some stress.  The northern pike population metrics indicate that the current management goal of maintaining a catch rate within the expected catch range has not been met.  The catch rate for northern pike has only been within the expected range of 1 to 8 fish/gill net) during one year, back in 1983.  Northern pike are stocked every year in Lake Shetek, but it appears an increased stocking rate may be needed.  Stocking is only effective if habitat and resources are available to support the fish, northern pike may be experiencing some habitat and resource scarcity in Lake Shetek.  Habitat improvements in Lake Shetek will go a long way in improving the conditions for northern pike, without habitat improvements the pike abundance in Lake Shetek will remain low.  <br> \n <br> \nChannel catfish numbers were the lowest they have been since 2006.  The winterkill of 2009-2010 may have reduced their abundance slightly.  It would also appear the significant winterkill of 2009-2010 had little impact to common carp or bigmouth buffalo as their catch rates were within or above the expected range.  Black bullhead numbers continue to remain at low levels.  Since 2006 only 8 black bullhead have been sampled in trap nets. <br> \n <br> \nOther species caught in 2010 were bigmouth buffalo, black bullhead, bluegill, brown bullhead, channel catfish, common carp, green sunfish, orangespotted sunfish, quillback, white crappie, white sucker, and yellow bullhead.  Of the species listed above, bigmouth buffalo, channel catfish, and white sucker all had catch rates above their expected catch rates indicating good population abundances.  It appears at second glance that the bigmouth buffalo population may not have experienced as much of a decline due to the winterkill as we first thought.  The average size of the buffalo may have decreased slightly indicating the loss of large fish, but the numbers have increased since 2009.  Brown bullhead, common carp, quillback, and white crappie all had catch rates within their respective expected catch ranges.  Black bullhead, bluegill, green sunfish, orangespotted sunfish, and yellow bullhead all had catch rates lower than their respective expected catch ranges.  Of those species with a catch rate lower than the expected catch range, it is possible that the time of year (late summer) may have negatively influenced catch rate due to high water temperatures, or changing weather patterns.  The overall condition of all the species listed above was good and indicated good foraging conditions.  The exceptions were bigmouth buffalo and common carp, both of which were in fair condition and may have suggested some kind of foraging stress.   <br> \n <br> \nTo maintain a healthy fish community in Lake Shetek, we need to promote Best Management Practices (BMPs) within the watershed to help reduce nutrients entering the lake.  High nutrients and sediments in a lake can cause algae blooms and reduce water clarity and may alter the food chain in a lake causing foraging stress and reduced overall condition of the fish.  Improved conditions in the surrounding watershed will lead to improve water quality and habitat within the lake. <br> \n <br> \nPrepared by <br> \nNate Hodgins <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Shetek is a 3,596-acre, class 41 lake, located in Murray County and is the largest lake in the Windom fisheries management area. The lake has a maximum depth of 10.0 ft. and typically has poor water quality likely a result from its agricultural watershed.  Lake Shetek is managed primarily for Walleye and secondarily for Black Crappie, Yellow Perch, and Northern Pike.  Beginning in 2017, Lake Shetek will be stocked with Lower Mississippi strain (LMS) Walleye fry every other year to allow for additional \"blank\" years so that natural reproduction can be assessed.  Lower Mississippi strain is the same strain that is found in Lake Sarah, which has one of the only Walleye populations in the Windom fisheries management area that is sustained through natural reproduction. A recent genetics study found that Lake Sarah's Walleye are unique to the Cannon River in east-central Minnesota, which was used as an egg source decades ago.  Further genetic testing has shown that this strain of Walleye has persisted in some other southern Minnesota lakes despite extensive stocking of Mississippi strain Walleye. A nighttime electrofishing survey was conducted on September 27, 2017 to determine if the fry stocking was successful.   <br> \n <br> \nYoung-of-the year Walleye were captured at a rate of 384.8 per hour electrofishing, which indicates that the fry stocking was very successful. A fin clip was collected from 50 Age-0 walleye and sent for genetic analysis.  More than 88% of the Age 0 sampled were a byproduct of the stocking.   The age-0 Walleyes ranged in length from 4.9 to 7.6 inches and averaged 6.2 inches.  If they survive the winter, the 2017 year class should be a very strong year class in the Lake Shetek Walleye population. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Shetek is a 3,596-acre lake located in Murray County and is the largest lake in the Windom fisheries management area. The lake has a maximum depth of 10.0 ft. and typically has poor water quality likely a result from its agricultural watershed.  Aeration systems were installed in the mid 1970's in both the north and south lake and are operated annually by Murray County. Lake Shetek is managed primarily for Walleye and secondarily for Black Crappie, Yellow Perch, and Northern Pike.  A survey was conducted on August 6, 2018 to monitor fish populations using six gill nets and 15 trap nets. <br> \n <br> \nThe 2018 Walleye catch rate was 24.8 per gill net, which is the highest catch rate observed since 1998 in Lake Shetek.  The catch rate exceeds the long term average of 13.4 per gill net, and is greater than the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (3.2 to 15.3 per gill net).  Forty-three percent of the Walleye sampled were age-1 (2017 year class), which corresponds to a stocking of Lower Mississippi Strain Walleye (same strain as Lake Sarah) in 2017.  Five additional year classes were sampled (2011, 2013, 2014, 2015, and 2016), all of which correspond to stocking events, except 2015 which is likely a naturally reproduced year class.  Walleye lengths ranged from 6.6 to 24.1 inches and averaged 11.8 inches.  Average lengths at age-1, age-2, age-3, age-4, and age 5 were 8.2 inches, 10.8 inches, 12.4 inches, 13.6 inches and 14.8 inches, suggesting that Walleye growth is slow in Lake Shetek.  Beginning in 2017, Walleye fry were stocked every other year so that natural reproduction can be detected in non-stocked years.  Walleye angling should be excellent in Lake Shetek for the next few years. <br> \n <br> \nThe 2018 Northern Pike catch rate was 0.9 per trap net, similar to catch rates observed in three previous surveys and similar to the long term average for Lake Shetek (0.8 per trap net).  Lengths of Northern Pike ranged from 9.4 to 36.0 inches and averaged 23.9 inches.  Thus far, Northern Pike survey catch rates have not reflected ongoing efforts to reestablish historic Northern Pike spawning runs through the use of drainable Northern Pike rearing ponds; however, a fishable population does exist in Lake Shetek.  Lake Shetek is within the \"southern zone\" of the new Northern Pike zone regulations, so two Pike 24 inches or longer can be harvested. Northern Pike under 24 inches must be released. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie catch rates have steadily increased from 6.4 per trap net in 2014 to 10.1 per trap net in 2016 to 14.9 per trap net in 2018, which is the highest catch rate since 2002 and exceeds the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (1.0 to 12.3 per trap net).  Black Crappie lengths ranged from 3.1 to 12.4 inches and averaged 8.1 inches.  At least 4 year classes of Black Crappie were present, according to the length frequency histogram, indicating that there is a stable, self-sustaining population. <br> \n <br> \nThe Yellow Perch catch rate in 2018 was 9.7 per gill net, which is the highest catch rate since 2002, and is within the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (3.0 to 22.5 per gill net).  Previous catch rates in 2014 and 2016 were less than 1.0 per gill net, so adult Yellow Perch were stocked in 2015 and 2017, successfully boosting the population.  Yellow Perch lengths ranged from 5.3 to 10.5 inches and averaged 7.7 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack Bullhead were caught at a rate of 14.5 per gill net, below the long term average of 30.3 per gill net.  Black Bullhead lengths ranged from 6.6 to 11.5 inches and averaged 9.2 inches.  The 2018 Common Carp catch rate was 4.3 per trap net, the highest catch rate since 2002.  The Channel Catfish catch rate was 10.0 per gill net, a decrease from the 16.5 observed in 2016, but still greater than the long term average of 5.8 per gill net.  Channel Catfish ranged in length from 10.4 to 28.4 inches and averaged 16.7 inches.  Other species sampled included Bigmouth Buffalo, Brown Bullhead, White Sucker, Orangespotted Sunfish, Quillback, White Crappie, and Yellow Bullhead.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Shetek, near the town of Currie, is a 3,600-acre lake in Murray County.  The lake has a maximum depth of 10 feet and over 30 miles of shoreline.  The lake is managed primarily for walleye and secondarily for yellow perch, northern pike, and black crappie.  A resurvey was conducted during the week of August 7, 2006 using gill nets, trap nets, and seine hauls. <br> \n <br> \nThe walleye catch rate in gill nets was 4.2 fish/gill net, which was within the expected range, but the lowest since the 1956 survey.  The fish were fairly small and averaged just over 9 inches.  Shetek is stocked every other year with walleye fry at 1,000 per littoral acre, which has been successful for many years.  Seine hauls indicated some natural reproduction occurred in 2006.  To better understand and follow the fish community trend in Lake Shetek, the Windom Office will survey the lake again in 2007.  Although the numbers of larger fish are down compared to historical surveys, anglers can boat a few fish with some effort.   <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch abundance is low compared to past years, with fish averaging 7 inches in length.  Although numbers are lower than average, perch growth appeared to be good.  No northern pike were captured in gill nets, trap nets, or seine hauls despite the stocking of over 17 thousand fingerlings in 2006.  Quite often these fingerlings would not be caught in trap nets or gill nets yet because of their small size.  Seine hauls would have captured fingerlings if water temperatures were cooler, however northern pike are usually not found near shore in August when water temperatures are the warmest. <br> \n <br> \nThe most abundant gamefish to target on Lake Shetek would likely be crappie in 2007.  Black crappie numbers are near the upper normal range and average 7.6 inches.  Black crappie plumpness was high and thus growth was quite good as Age 4 fish averaged 9.3 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nAnother fish to target on Lake Shetek would be channel catfish.  Lake Shetek appears to have record high channel catfish abundance.  Although the numbers are high, the population is dominated by the 2000 year class, which are 14 to 17 inches.  The 2006 catch rate nearly tripled the previous historical high catch rate on Lake Shetek.  Channel catfish are successfully natural reproducing and are increasing in abundance.  It is very likely during those hot summer months, an angler targeting channel catfish will have good action. <br> \n <br> \nThe biggest surprise on Lake Shetek in 2006 was the low numbers of black bullheads.  Generally Windom Area lakes consistently have black bullhead abundances that exceed the normal range.  The next lowest catch rate for black bullheads was documented during the 1988 survey, which found 32.4 fish/gill net, nearly 4 times the 2006 catch rate.  Fifteen trap nets never captured a black bullhead, which has never happened before in Lake Shetek.  It would appear that if you are targeting black bullheads, you might want to consider another lake in the area.   <br> \n <br> \nEfforts to improve the health of the lake should focus on best management practices within the watershed.  Improvements and education in land stewardship will often have secondary benefits to the lake in the way of quality and quantity of habitat.  Generally, improvements in the quality and quantity of lake habitat will mean direct improvements of the fishery. <br> \n <br> \nPrepared by <br> \n <br> \nRyan Doorenbos <br> \n   <br> \n <br> \n       <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Covering 3,596 acres, Lake Shetek is the largest lake in the Windom Area.  It has a shoreline length of 31.7 miles and a maximum depth of ten feet.  The immediate shoreline is covered primarily by woodland areas, and the majority of the surrounding watershed is cultivated.  Shoalwater areas are dominated by sand and gravel substrate.  As with most lakes in the Windom Area, aquatic vegetation is considered sparse.  Lake Shetek is managed primarily for walleye while providing secondary populations of yellow perch, black crappie, and northern pike.  Northern pike had nearly disappeared from the lake due to drought conditions in the late 1980's, but have made a comeback after restocking and higher water levels once again gave them access to wetland spawning areas.\n\nLake Shetek was opened to liberalized fishing eight years during the period of 1930-1971. A Helixor aeration system (the first such system in Minnesota) was installed in 1974, and very little winterkill has occurred since then.  The heavily developed lake has long been a center of recreational activity in SW Minnesota, and it is a primary vacation and fishing destination for residents and non-residents alike.  According to a creel survey conducted in 1998, total fishing pressure for Lake Shetek during the open water creel was estimated at 33,982 angler hours (11.91 angler hours/acre).\n\nConcerns over water quality led to acquisition of a Clean Water Partnership Grant, Phase I of which was completed in 1996.  Phase II will be the implementation of best management practices (BMP\u0019s) within the watershed, with the goal of reducing total phosphorous in the lake by 30% and improving overall water quality.  Water quantity concerns during dry years brought about the construction of a diversion ditch and associated dams in the 1930's, to divert water into Lake Shetek from Beaver Creek.  One of the recommendations coming out of the Clean Water Partnership was that the diversion no longer be operated, as it was determined that it was a huge contributor of undesirable nutrients to the lake, greatly outweighing any benefits of additional water. The diversion structure was subsequently removed and the ditch plugged in 2000.\n\nWalleye numbers are down from previous years in Shetek.  The walleye gill net catch rate was 2.8 per net in 2007 compared to 4.2 per net in 2006 and 14.0 per net in 2002.  To try and determine why the walleye population has declined, annual assessments have been scheduled for the future.  Because of the decline in the walleye population, the operational plan was changed to stock walleye fry 2 of 3 years from stocking every other year.  Lengths of walleye caught in gill nets in 2007 ranged from 7.8 to 28.3 inches and averaged 12.8 inches.  Five different ages, dominated by age-2 fish (76% of the fish sampled), were observed during the assessment.  Walleye age classes from 2001, 2004, and 2006 appear to be from natural reproduction.\n\nThe yellow perch population is also low in Shetek.  The yellow perch catch rate was 1.7 per net in 2007 compared to 1.7 per net in 2006 and 53.5 per net in 2002.  Lengths of yellow perch caught in gill nets ranged from 5.9 to 9.9 inches and averaged 7.5 inches.  \n\nShetek has a very good black crappie population.  The black crappie trap net catch rate was 10.1 per net in 2007 compared to 10.7 per net in 2006 and 119.9 per net in 2002.  Lengths of black crappie caught in trap nets ranged from 4.8 to 10.5 inches and averaged 8.0 inches.  \n\nOnly two northern pike were sampled during the assessment in 2007 compared to 0 in 2006 and 11 in 2002.  The two fish sampled had lengths of 15.4 and 40.0 inches.  Northern pike fingerlings were stocked in Shetek in 2006 and 2007 in an attempt to revive the pike population.\n\nChannel catfish first showed up in 1996 when a gill net CPUE of 0.3 per net was documented.  Since Shetek is not stocked with channel catfish, it is likely some adults immigrated into the lake in 1993 when high water levels would have allowed fish to move into the lake.  The population has continued to expand.  The gill net catch rate in 2007 was 10.0 per net compared to 11.8 per net in 2006, 4.5 per net in 2002, and 1.2 per net in 1998.  Lengths of channel catfish caught in gill nets in 2007 ranged from 9.5 to 27.0 inches and averaged and averaged 6.2 inches.  We are monitoring Shetek annually to see if the increase in channel catfish numbers is affecting the walleye population.\n\nBlack bullhead numbers appear to have decreased from a high of 518.2 per net in 1992 to 0.4 per net in 2007 and 0.0 per net in 2006.   It should be noted that besides 1992, black bullhead have only gone above the average range of 1.3 per net to 78.1 per net once, and that was in 2002 when 78.2 fish per net was documented.  The black bullhead population had an overall Wr of 81 indicating that the black bullhead sampled were in poor to fair condition.\n\nOther species sampled during the assessment included common carp, white crappie, yellow bullhead, bluegill, white sucker, and quillback.\n\nTo maintain a healthy fishery in Lake Shetek, we need to promote Best Management Practices (BMP\u0019s) within the watershed to help reduce nutrients entering the lake.  High nutrients and sediments in a lake can cause algae blooms and reduce water clarity.\n\n\n\n</p>",
