                "narrative": "<p>Sargent Lake is a small, shallow, lake located within the White Earth Indian Reservation, approximately 3 miles west of Naytahwaush, MN. There is no development on the lake other than an abandoned farmstead. Spawning areas seem to be adequate for Largemouth Bass, Black Crappie, Bluegill, Yellow Perch, and Northern Pike, but Walleye spawning habitat is not present. Some fish migration between Sargent and North Twin lakes does occur. <br> \n <br> \nWinterkill or partial winterkill has occurred in severe winters in Sargent Lake. Winterkills have been documented or suspected in 1956, 1977, and at least one year between 1985 and 1990.  Bluegill were stocked in 1977, and Walleye fry in 1978 in response to winterkill. Walleye were again stocked in 1980 and 1982, and Bluegill in 1981. These fish were stocked following the 1980 survey that found very few of either species. The DNR has not stocked any fish in Sargent Lake since 1982, but the White Earth Tribe stocked Walleye frylings or fingerlings every 2-3 years between 1989-2005.  Unfortunately no Walleyes were captured in 2015, likely due to lack of spawning habitat and cessation of stocking. <br> \n  <br> \nNorthern Pike gill net catch has gradually increased since 1985, with a 2015 rate of 10.5/net.  Average length of Northern Pike caught in gill nets in 2015 was 20.2 inches, and 9.8% were greater than 24 inches.  Average length for four year old Northern Pike was 23.2 inches.  However, 87% of those captured in gill nets were 3 or fewer years old. <br> \n <br> \nIn 1995, Yellow Perch gill net catch was the highest on record (48 net) for Sargent Lake, and high compared to similar lakes in the state.  However, Yellow Perch catch declined to 17.8 per net in 2015, likely in response to greater Northern Pike abundance.  Average length of Yellow Perch in gill nets was 7 inches with fish up to 10.8 inches being captured. <br> \n <br> \nAn extremely high Black Bullhead trap net catch (134 per net) was reported in 1995.  However, no Black Bullhead were caught in trap nets in the 2015 survey.  Gill nets appeared to be more efficient at sampling both Black and Brown Bullheads, with catch rates being 14.5 and 148.3 per gill net, respectively.       <br> \n <br> \nIn 2015, only three Black Crappie and a single Largemouth Bass were captured in trap nets. However, Bluegill trap net catch was the highest on record for Sargent Lake at 15.2 per net.  An average four year old Bluegill was 6.2 inches in 2015, though 75% of Bluegill were less than or equal to 3 years old. <br> \n <br> \nThe natural setting of Sargent Lake makes for an enjoyable outing even if the fish are not biting.  Anglers can help to maintain balance in fish populations by voluntarily releasing a portion of medium and large fish and keeping smaller ones for eating.  This is particularly true for Northern Pike and Bluegill.  Shoreline owners and other watershed dwellers can help to maintain or improve water quality and fish habitat by leaving shoreline buffer zones, by leaving stands of native aquatic vegetation intact, by taking precautions to prevent invasive species introductions, and by using wise land management practices.  </p>",

Winterkill or partial winterkill can occur in severe winters.  The initial lake survey in 1980 refers to a winterkill in 1977.  Bluegill and walleye were stocked following that episode but fish can also repopulate the lake by immigration via Twin Lakes Creek.  Historical netting data indicates a partial winterkill probably occurred between 1985 and 1990.  The current fish community contains modest populations of northern pike, bluegill, black crappie, and walleye.  The bluegill and crappie populations, although not abundant, display a good size structure; bluegills in the 8-9 inch range and crappies in the 10-12 inch range.  A large 1994 year class of largemouth bass has put their numbers far above what would be expected for a lake of this type.  At this point they are exhibiting fast growth and in a few years may provide some excellent angling.  Yellow perch and black bullheads are very abundant.  The natural setting of Sargent Lake makes for an enjoyable outing even if the fish aren't biting.  If future development occurs on the lake the undisturbed character of the shoreline should be preserved as much as possible.</p>",
