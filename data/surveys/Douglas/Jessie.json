Gillnetcatches have ranged from 2.0 to 8.0 fish/gillnet in previous surveys dating back to 1977.  Mean weightof fish captured was 1.9 pounds.  Approximately 42% of the fish captured were 21 inches in length orgreater, however none exceeded 28 inches.  Daytime, DC electrofishing yielded 32.0 stock-sizelargemouth bass per hour.  Mean weight of fish captured was 1.1 pounds.  Mean length of fish capturedwas 12 inches.  Bluegill catches averaged 10.1 fish/trapnet, similar to the catch rate of 12.3fish/trapnet recorded in both 1992 and 1987.  Trapnet catches have ranged from 12.3 to 52.0 fish/netin previous surveys dating back to 1977.  The normal range of mean catch rates from similar lakes is5.9 - 43.3 fish/trapnet.  The bluegill population is mostly comprised of small individuals less than6 inches in length.  Black crappie are not effectively sampled with standard survey gear during summermonths.  Trapnet catches averaged 1.8 fish/net.  Trapnet catches have ranged from 1.6 to 5.4 fish/netin previous surveys dating back to 1977.  Eleven of the sixteen fish captured were between 4.0 and 5.0inches in total length.  Yellow perch catches averaged 2.8 fish/gillnet which is below the normal rangeof mean catch rates for similar lakes (3.7 - 28.4 fish/gillnet).  Gillnet catches ranged from 17.5 to40.5 fish/net in previous surveys dating back to 1977.  Most of the fish captured were between 5.0 and8.0 inches in total length.  Three walleye were captured in gillnets.  Two of the fish were between10.0 and 11.0 inches in total length and the other one measured 18.2 inches.  Past surveys haveindicated little or no natural reproduction.  Migration from Lake Victoria is the likely source ofwalleye present in Lake Jessie.   </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Jessie is a small, lightly developed lake within the Alexandria Chain of Lakes in Douglas County.  There is no public access.  However, most fishing boats can be manuevered under a road bridge and through a navigable channel from Lake Victoria.  Water quality and clarity appear to be good.  Aquatic vegetation is dense throughout the shallow areas of the lake.  There are large expanses of water lily on the water's surface during summer months.  These plants provide critical aquatic habitat for many gamefish species and compete with nuisance algae for the available nutrients in the lake.The fish community in Jessie Lake is typical of a small, densly vegetated lake.  Largemouth bass, northern pike, and bluegill are all abundant.  These species should all provide consistent high catch rates.  However, the average sizes of these fish are relatively small.  Spring and early summer may provide the best fishing opportunities.  Winter fishing has also picked up in recent years.       Walleye are present in low numbers.  Walleye likely migrate in an out of Lake Jessie to other lakes within the Alex Chain, as do other species.  Because there is no public access, there has been no stocking of fish into Lake Jessie.  Other fish mangement activities have also been limited.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Jessie has maintained an abundant and diverse submergent vegetation community.  Plants grow at a depth up to 12 feet and occupy most of the littoral zone of the lake.  Emergent vegetation is also common along the shoreline.  This aquatic vegetation provides ample habitat for Centrachids and Northern Pike.  Bluegill catch rates averaged 12.3 fish/trapnet in 1992 which is identical to the mean catch rate recorded during the 1987 survey.  This catch rate is within the normal range for lake class 33. Gillnet catch per unit effort averaged 13.5 fish/net which exceeds the third quartile of mean catch rates (8.0 fish/net) for lake class 33.  A catch rate of 10.8 fish/gillnet was recorded in 1987. This may be indicative of a more abundant population than the mean trapnet catch rate suggests.  Extensive submergent vegetation in shallow areas may have limited capture efficiency of trapnets.  Size structure of the Bluegill population is desirable.  PSD of fish captured in trapnets and gillnets was calculated at 47.7% and 83.3%, respectively.  Growth of Bluegill in Lake Jessie is similar to the average growth rate from other area lakes within lake class 33.  Age 5 fish average 6.6 inches in total length at time of annulus formation.  Submergent and emergent vegetation coverage is providing suitable habitat for Bluegill reproduction.  Shoreline seining captured an average of 39.4 young of the year Bluegill per 100 feet haul in 1992. Daytime ac electrofishing yielded a total of 52 Largemouth Bass/hour.  The catch rate for stock-size fish (8.0 inches and greater) was 27 fish/hour.  Catch rates of 28.8 total fish/hour and 19.2 stock size fish/hour were recorded in 1987.  PSD and RSD-P were measured at 48.1% and 7.4%, respectively, in 1992.  Size structure of fish captured in 1987 was similar to that of the 1992 capture sample.  Largemouth Bass growth in Lake Jessie is slow, however growth rates are comparable to other area lakes within lake class 33.  Age 5 fish averaged only 12.5 inches in total length at time of annulus formation.  Young of the year Largemouth Bass were captured at a rate of 2.0 fish per 100 foot seine haul.  This catch rate is low; however, the large number of juvenile Largemouth Bass collected during electrofishing may indicate that reproductive success is not a concern.  Standard survey gear is inefficient in evaluating Black Crappie populations during the mid-summer months.  The mean catch rate of 2.6 fish/trapnet recorded in 1992 is within the inter-quartile range for lake class 33.  Catch rates have ranged from 5.8 fish/ net to 1.6 fish/net in previous survey dating back to 1960.  Cohorts of the 1988 year class (age 4) comprised 78% of Black Crappie captured in 1992.  These averaged 8.3 inches in total length at time of capture.  Results from shoreline seining conducted in late august may indicate that another strong year class was produced in 1992.  Catches from 100 foot seine hauls averaged 18.8 young of the year Black Crappie.  Mean Northern Pike catches decreased from 8.0 fish/gillnet in 1987 to 2.0 fish/gillnet in 1992.  The catch rate recorded in 1992 is below the interquartile range of mean catch rates for lake class 33 (2.7-9.0). Previous catches have ranged from 2.3 to 8.0 fish/ gillnet in surveys dating back to 1960.  Limited reproductive success in 1988-1990, when water levels were low, may explain the apparent decrease in Northern Pike abundance.  Many other lakes in the Glenwood management area have experienced a similar decline in Northern Pike abundance.  The Yellow Perch gillnet catch rate averaged 17.5 fish/net, which is within the normal range of mean catch rates from lake class 33.  Mean weight of fish captured was 0.2 pounds. PSD was estimated at 27.1%.  This is similar to the PSD of 23.3% that was measured in 1987, however RSD-P fell from 7.8% in 1987 to 0% in 1992.  Three Walleye were collected during the lake survey.  Past surveys have indicated little or no natural reproduction.  Immigration from Lake Victoria is the likely source of Walleye present in Lake Jessie.  The carp trap located in the channel between Lakes Jessie and Victoria limits movement of larger fish between the lakes.  Yellow Bullhead and Black Bullhead catch rates averaged 16.8 fish/gillnet and 3.0 fish/gillnet, respectively.  The Yellow Bullhead catch rate is similar to the catch rate recorded in 1987, however the Black Bullhead catch rate is considerably lower than the catch rate of 52.0 fish/gillnet recorded in 1987.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Jessie is a small 105-acre lake located within the Alexandria Chain of Lakes in Douglas County. There is no public access on the lake.  Boats can enter the lake through a channel from Lake Victoria. Lake Jessie is the most turbid lake in the chain, although water quality and clarity remain fair. Aquatic vegetation is dense throughout shallow areas of the lake.  There are large beds of water lily on the surface during summer months.  Aquatic vegetation provides critical aquatic habitat for many fish species and helps to maintain good water quality and clarity. It is important to protect and preserve this vegetation as residential development and recreational boating pressure increase on this small lake. \n\nA standard fisheries survey was completed during summer 2020 to provide updated information on the fish community of Lake Jessie.  Standard survey components typically include spring electrofishing, gill nets, and trap nets.  However, due to safety concerns during the COVID-19 pandemic, trap nets were not utilized in 2020.\n \nThe fish community in Lake Jessie is typical of small, densely vegetated lakes in west-central Minnesota.  Largemouth Bass, Bluegill, and Black Crappie are abundant and support most angling opportunities.  Walleye and Northern Pike are also present in moderate numbers.  Size Structures of Largemouth Bass was good, about 36% of the sampled bass were over 15 inches.  The largest bass sampled was 17.9 inches.  A majority of the Bluegill sampled were over 7 inches but only one exceeded 8 inches.  Bluegill growth rates are above average and this population provides quality panfishing opportunities.  Black Crappie growth rates are moderate and a large number of 8- to 9-inch crappie sampled in 2020 should provide great angling opportunities in the near future.  Northern Pike numbers are moderate and average size was only 21.0 inches.  However, multiple 30-inch pike were caught during the survey.  A wide range of Walleye sizes are available in Lake Jessie.  Sampled fish ranged from 12.4 to 27.2 inches in length.  Walleye abundance is similar to the rest of the chain, despite much lower stocking levels.  State stocking is constrained due to lack of public access but private user groups have occasionally stocked Walleye fingerlings.  Most of the Walleye present in Lake Jessie are likely migrants from Lake Victoria.\n\nAdditional species sampled include Common Carp, hybrid sunfish, Pumpkinseed, Rock Bass, White Sucker, Yellow Perch, and Black and Yellow Bullhead.  The next standard fisheries survey is tentatively scheduled for 2028.\n\nQuality fishing opportunities exist for many species in Lake Jessie.  Anglers are encouraged to practice selective harvest to help improve and sustain quality fishing experiences.  Selective harvest philosophy encourages release of larger fish while encouraging harvest of more abundant smaller fish.  Releasing medium to large fish will help restore and maintain fish community balance, as well as increase opportunities to catch large fish in the future.\n\nLake Jessie was designated as an infested water after the discovery of zebra mussels in the Alexandria Chain of Lakes in 2009.  Minnesota statutes require all equipment be free of invasive species prior to leaving any access.  Recreational users should take necessary precautions to prevent the further spread of aquatic invasive species.\n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Jessie is a small, lightly developed lake within the Alexandria Chain of Lakes in Douglas County.  There is no public access site, however most fishing boats can enter under a road bridge and through a navigable channel from Lake Victoria.  A carp trap structure was removed from the channel in 2001 to facilitate boat traffic.  Water quality and clarity are considered good.  Aquatic vegetation is dense throughout shallow areas of the lake.  There are large beds of water lily on the water's surface during summer months.  These plants provide critical aquatic habitat for many fish species and help to maintain good water quality and clarity.  It is important to protect and preserve this vegetation as residential development increases on this small lake.  The fish community in Lake Jessie is typical of small, densely vegetated lakes in west-central Minnesota.  Largemouth bass, northern pike, bluegill, and black crappie are all relatively abundant and provide most of the angling opportunities.  The size structures of the largemouth bass and bluegill populations should be desirable for most anglers.  Over 60% of the bass captured were 12 inches in length or greater and about 25% exceeded 15 inches.  About 65% of the bluegill were 6.0 inches or greater and a few exceeded 8.0 inches.  Walleye are present in limited numbers.  Fish ranged from 15 to 25 inches in length.  Walleye, as well as other species, likely migrate in and out of Lake Jessie to other lakes within the Alex Chain.  Fish have not been stocked because there is no public access.  Other fish management activities have also been limited.      </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Jessie is a small 105-acre lake located within the Alexandria Chain of Lakes in Douglas County. There is no public access on the lake.  Fishing boats can enter the lake through a channel from Lake Victoria. Water quality and clarity are fair. Aquatic vegetation is dense throughout shallow areas of the lake. There are large beds of water lily on the surface during summer months. Aquatic vegetation provides critical aquatic habitat for many fish species and help to maintain good water quality and clarity. It is important to protect and preserve this vegetation as residential development and recreational boating pressures increase on this small lake.  <br> \n <br> \nThe fish community in Lake Jessie is typical of small, densely vegetated lakes in west-central Minnesota. Largemouth bass, northern pike, bluegill, and black crappie are abundant and support most angling opportunities. Size structures of largemouth bass and bluegill are good. Black crappie and northern pike are abundant, but average size tends to be relatively small. Walleye and yellow perch are also present but abundance of these species is limited. State stocking is constrained due to lack of public access.  Walleye that are present are likely migrants from Lake Victoria. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of the nearshore fish community in Jessie Lake was conducted by Fisheries Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program Staff from 16-18 August 2021.  Ten sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 15-foot or 50-foot seine, where possible.  Backpack electrofishing was completed at all 10 sites with two sites sampled from the boat.  A 50-foot seine was used to sample two sites, a 15-foot seine was used at five sites, and soft sediments with abundant vegetation and deep water prevented the use of seines at three sampling sites.  Nearshore sampling captured 15 native species of fish including one species that is intolerant of disturbance (Iowa Darter) and no species that are tolerant of disturbance. <br> \n <br> \nA concurrent summer trap net survey was conducted on 16-18 August 2021 by IBI Program Staff.  Nine trap nets were set along the shoreline that encompassed multiple habitat types.  Bluegill and Pumpkinseed comprised a majority of the trap net catch by number and Bluegill, Walleye, and Yellow Bullhead comprised a majority of the catch by biomass.  The number of Bluegill sampled per net was below the 50% quartile for similar Lake Class 34 lakes and the average length was 5.7 inches, with 24% over 7 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore and trap net data were combined with gill net data from a July 2020 survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based IBI (FIBI) score.  The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment.  In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g., Blackchin Shiner, Iowa Darter, and Rock Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g., Black Bullhead, Fathead Minnow, and Green Sunfish).  The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake.  For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.   <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey indicates Jessie Lake is in good health as indicated by an FIBI score above the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes.  Data from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Long Prairie River Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency. <br> \n</p>",
