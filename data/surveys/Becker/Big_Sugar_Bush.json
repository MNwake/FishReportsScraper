                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of the nearshore fish community on Big Sugar Bush Lake was conducted on July 17, 2017 by Fisheries Lake Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) program staff. Sampling stations were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at all ten stations with two sites sampled from the boat due to a substantial fringe of abundant bulrush, water lilies, and wild rice out to deep water. A 50-foot seine was used to sample two stations, a 15-foot seine was used at six station, and abundant emergent vegetation in deep water prevented the use of seines at two sampling sites. Nearshore sampling captured 13 native species of fish including three species that are intolerant of habitat disturbance (Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, and Iowa Darter). <br> \n <br> \nData from this targeted nearshore survey is combined with data from a standard gill and trap netting survey in June 2017 to calculate a Fish-based Index of Biologic Integrity (FIBI) score that describes the overall health of the lake. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment.  The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. The FIBI score for Big Sugar Bush Lake based on this survey is above the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes.  For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website. <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Buffalo River Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.    <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Big Sugarbush Lake is a scenic lake in north-central Becker County.  Water quality is good and many lakeshore property owners have retained natural shoreline characteristics that preserve aesthetic qualities and water quality.  A diverse fish community is present that provides a variety of angling opportunities.Current test net information shows a significant increase in the northern pike population, primarily two and three year old northern pike.  These fish are likely a result of increased northern pike spawning habitat created by the very high water levels the lake has experienced in recent years.  A few large northern pike (up to 36 inches) were also sampled.Big Sugarbush is probably best known for its panfishing, black crappie in particular.  Angling for crappies has reportedly been excellent in recent years with many fish in the 1 lb. + range.  Crappie growth rate is above average in this lake and test nets showed plenty of young crappies are available to provide good angling in the future.  In contrast, bluegill growth rates are slow, and although the 7 inch average size is good, these are relatively old bluegills.  It wouldn't take much angler harvest of the older bluegills to significantly reduce the size structure.  It would then take quite a few years to replace those larger bluegills.Modest populations of largemouth bass and walleye are present in the lake.  These species seem to provide good angling during certain periods.  Although test nets did not show an abundance of walleye, the average size sampled was 2.5 lbs.  Bass fishing is periodically reported by anglers to be quite good.Big Sugarbush Lake has an \"up north\" appearance about it.  This is partly due to the care many property owners have taken to retain natural shoreline characteristics.  It is this kind of stewardship and implementation of shoreland, \"Best Management Practices\" that will insure the health and well being of our lakes for the future.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Big Sugar Bush is a 472 acre, scenic lake with many bays and peninsulas in north-central Becker County.  Water quality is good and many lakeshore property owners have retained natural shoreline characteristics that preserve aesthetic and water qualities.  A diverse fish community is present that provides a variety of angling opportunities. <br> \n <br> \nThe northern pike gill net catch in 2007 was 9.8 per net which is slightly higher than the 7.7 per net recorded in 2002 and the long term average (7.8 per net) for this lake.  The northern pike sampled in 2007 ranged in age from one to eight years old.  Two and three year old fish accounted for nearly 90% of the sample.  Northern pike growth rates were slightly faster than statewide averages.  The average length of northern pike sampled was 18.1 inches. <br> \n <br> \nThe gill net catch of walleye in 2007 of 3.3 per net was about double that reported in the last two surveys and is just above the lake's long term average of 3.0 walleyes per net.  Increased walleye fry stocking in the late 1990's and early 2000's did not produce successful year classes or improve the walleye test net catches.  Consequently, stocking plans reverted to fingerlings at an increased rate.  After one evaluation period, walleye catches increased but are still not at the lake's long range goal.  Some anglers also reported better walleye fishing during the past year or two.  The current stocking regimen is to be maintained for at least one more evaluation cycle (five years) before any potential changes are made. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill trap net catches were similar to those reported in the past two studies (1997 and 2002).  Sampled bluegills were from three to six years old (most were age five) and they exhibited a below average growth rate.  However, growth rates were better than the very slow growth rate observed in 1997.  The mean length of the bluegills sampled was 6.7 inches. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch, black crappie, largemouth bass, brown and yellow bullhead, and green, hybrid, and pumpkinseed sunfish, and white sucker were also found during test netting.  Bass average about 11 inches while crappies averaged about nine inches in length. <br> \n <br> \nBig Sugar Bush Lake has a distinct \"natural\" feel about it.  This is due in large part to the efforts of lakeshore residents to protect natural shoreline and lake vegetation.  Preserving and restoring natural vegetation is critical in preserving water quality, fish habitat, and the entire lake ecosystem.</p>",

Largest year class, by far, was from a stocked year, but, only 960 - 20 lb. fingerlings were stocked that year.  If there is natural reproduction, it's extremely sporadic.  Northern pike, largemouth bass, bluegill and yellow bullhead numbers remain strong.  Black crappie were caught for the first time on this survey; numbers and sizes were good.  Yellow perch have increased, but, still remain low in number when compared to medians.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>The gillnet catch rate for northern pike is similar to the 1987 survey's.  At 5.50/GN it lies between the first and third quartile for this lake class (#25), as it has since the 1970's.  The current population exhibits an improved size structure, PSD=39, over three previous surveys, '76, '82, and '87, where PSD's were < 10.  An earlier survey, 1964, recorded a 13.33/GN catch rate (well above the third quartile) with a PSD of 13.  RSD(30)'s for all these surveys have been zero, with the exception of '87, when it was 4.  Consistent with the survey, anglers report good northern pike fishing but not many large fish.  Age classes one through six were found in the current survey.  Spawning habitat is abundant and should not be a limiting factor.  A historically small yellow perch population may possibly be inhibiting the abundance and growth of northern pike by limiting their forage base.  Growth rates for the current northern pike population are well below average.Net catches of yellow bullheads have varied considerably from survey to survey with the current trapnet catch rate at three times the third quartile value for this lake class.  Though abundant, they are generally too small to be of interst to commercial fishermen.  Interestingly, black bullheads are apparently not present in this lake.Bluegills, at 69.50/TN, show a marked increase from the previous survey's 40.25/TN.  The trapnet catch is now above the third quartile for this lake class.  This increase in numbers has not been accompanied by the characteristic decline in PSD's and RSD's; '87 PSD=62, '92 PSD=78; '87 RSD(8)=10, '92 RSD(8)=6.  As frequently occurs with abundant bluegill populations, growth rates are below average.  Ages 1-5, in particular, exhibit slow growth.  A slow growth rate coupled with a moderately good size structure suggests bluegills are not subjected to heavy fishing pressure in this lake.Largemouth bass at 3.33/TN are well above the third quartile for this lake class.  They exhibit an average to slightly above average growth rate.  Although trapnets are notoriously poor sampling gear for largemouth bass, their abundance appears to have increased from the previous survey.  A substantial increase in the current gillnet catch rate also provides evidence for an increase in abundance.  Early surveys indicate that the lake has historically supported a healthy bass population.  Current PSD and RSD(15) are 42 and 4, respectively.  With excellent spawning habitat and a plentiful forage base (small bluegills), this lake would seem to afford largemouth bass the ideal conditions.The black crappie trapnet catch is below the first quartile for this lake class.  PSD=78 and RSD(10)=44, but the small sample size must be considered.  Age and growth analysis for the nine black crappies that were collected in test nets indicate a fast growth rate.  Despite the small survey catch, anglers report good black crappie fishing, especially in winter or early spring.  Although black crappies were stocked before 1945, they did not appear in test net catches until the 1987 survey.Yellow perch have shown a trend towards gradually increasing numbers from the earliest survey to the present, although at 6.00/GN they are still not abundant.  Six/GN is, however, between the first and third quartile for this lake class.  Northern pike and walleye predation have likely served to keep the yellow perch population from expanding significantly.The walleye population at 1.50/GN is just above the first quartile for this lake class.  This is less than the 3.00/GN recorded in the previous survey.  Despite nearly annual fingerling stocking in the 1970's and biennial stocking in 1980's, the highest recorded gillnet catch rate for the period was 3.60/GN in 1976.  An earlier survey, 1964, recorded a gillnet catch rate of 8.50/GN, perhaps as a result of heavy fry stocking in the late 50's.  Age and growth analysis of the current population indicates age classes from non-stocking years are as well represented as those from stocking years.  It appears that fingerling stocking is not significantly adding to the population resulting from marginally successful natural reproduction.  Walleye growth rate is average.  Interestingly, small sunfish were found in a number of walleye stomachs.Data from the current survey dictates some rethinking of management strategies for Big Sugar Bush Lake.  Twenty years of walleye fingerling stocking has failed to produce a walleye population over and above that which might be attributable to natural reproduction, however marginal that may be.  In addition, the lake currently supports good populations of NOP, BLG, LMB, and probably BLC, that are naturally occurring and well suited to the habitat present.  Continued walleye fingerling stocking under the circumstances would seem to be ill advised.  However, it is noteworthy that in the earliest survey, 1964, large numbers of NOP, LMB, and WAE, as well as BLG, were all present at the same time, with the bluegill PSD=91 and RSD(8)=42.  Today the bluegill PSD=78 and RSD(8)=6, and they grow slowly.  Increased fishing pressure is likely a factor but it is possible that a large walleye population in 1964 was helping to suppress the proliferation of small bluegills by predation, enabling remaining bluegills to grow faster.  Walleye stomach contents in the current survey indicated significant small bluegill predation.  Therefore, a large walleye population may not only be desirable from the stand point of creating a walleye fishery, but also from the stand point of maintaining or improving the bluegill fishery.  The large walleye population present in 1964 appears to have been the result of substantial fry stocking in the late 50's, and may be worth trying again.  Should this also fail to produce a significant increase in the walleye population then walleye stocking should be abandoned.  Small, infrequent stocking might be appropriate to insure that walleye remain present in the fish community and provide some angling diversity.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Big Sugar Bush is a 472 acre, scenic lake with many bays and peninsulas in north-central Becker County.  Water quality is good and many lakeshore property owners have retained natural shoreline characteristics that preserve aesthetic and water qualities.  A diverse fish community is present that provides a variety of angling opportunities.The northern pike gill net catch in 2002 was 7.7 per net which is lower than the 10.0 per net recorded in 1997 but equal to the long term average.  The northern pike sampled in 2002 ranged in age from one to seven years old.  Two and three year old fish accounted for nearly 70% of the sample.  Northern pike growth rates were close to statewide averages.  Average length of northern pike sampled was 19.3 inches.The gill net catch of walleye in 2002 of 1.3 per net was not much different from the last two surveys and is approximately half of the long term average.  Increased walleye fry stocking in recent years has not produced year classes or improved the walleye gill net catch.  Twelve walleyes were sampled in 2002 and none were less than five years old.  They exhibited normal growth rates.  The mean length of the twelve walleye was 21.5 inches.Bluegill trap net catches declined from 31.1 per net in 1997 to 24.2 in 2002.  Sampled bluegills were from two to eight years old and they exhibited a below average growth rate.  However, growth rates were better than the very slow growth rate observed in 1997.  The mean length of the bluegills sampled was 6.3 inches.Yellow perch, black crappie, and largemouth bass all showed net catch declines from the previous survey.  Yellow perch have never been abundant in Big Sugar Bush Lake but the 2002 catch rate of 0.8 per gill net is a historic low.  The historical average is 3.1 gor gill net.  The largemouth bass trap net catch in 2002 was also at a historica low of 0.2 per net.  The long term average bass trap net catch is 1.8 per net.  A substantial number of bass were collected in gill nets in 2002.  The bass ranged from one to seven years old and exhibited normal growth rates.  Black crappies were not sampled in Big Sugar Bush Lake until the 1987 survey.  Since then, trap net catches have been variable, from a low of 0.2 per net in 1992 to a high of 3.5 per net in 1997.  The trap net catch in 2002 was 0.9 per net.  Black crappie ranged from two to seven years old and exhibited growth rates close to statewide averages.  Anglers have reported some good black crappie and bluegill fishing on Big Sugar Bush Lake in recent years.Big Sugar Bush Lake has a distinct \"natural\" feel about it.  This is due in large part to the efforts of lakeshore residents to protect natural shoreline and lake vegetation.  Preserving and restoring natural vegetation is critical in preserving water quality, fish habitat, and the entire lake ecosystem.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Big Sugar Bush is a 472-acre, scenic lake with many bays and peninsulas, located in north-central Becker County within the White Earth Reservation.  Water clarity remains high with an average secchi disk reading of 18.4 feet and many lakeshore property owners have retained natural shoreline characteristics that preserve aesthetic and water qualities.  A diverse fish community provides a variety of angling opportunities. <br> \n <br> \nThe northern pike gill net catch in 2012 was 11.9 per net which was the highest catch rate for pike since 1964.  Young fish dominated the sample with two and three year old fish accounting for nearly 90% of the sample.  Northern pike growth rates were similar to statewide averages, but it still takes about seven or eight years to grow a rare, 30-inch pike in Big Sugar Bush.  The average length of northern pike sampled was 18.3 inches. <br> \n <br> \nIncreased walleye fry stocking in the late 1990's and early 2000's did not produce successful year classes or improve the walleye test net catches.  Consequently, stocking plans reverted to fingerlings at an increased rate beginning in 2004.  After two evaluation periods, walleye catches have increased.  The walleye gill net catch rate in 2012 of 4.4 per net was slightly higher than catch rates in the past seven evaluations, but still below the management goal of 5.0 walleyes per net.  Some anglers also reported better walleye fishing during the past few years.  The current stocking regimen will likely be maintained for at least one more evaluation cycle (five years) before any potential changes are made.  If it is determined that this stocking scheme is achieving the long range goal it will probably be maintained. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill trap net catches have declined to the lowest level in history.  While the catch rate of 12.8 bluegills per net is still within the normal range for similar lakes, it is about half the previous low found in 2002.  Sampled bluegills were from two to 10 years old (most were age five or six) and they exhibited a slow growth rate of 5.1 inches in four years which was typical for this lake.  The mean length of the bluegills sampled was 7.0 inches and several over eight inches were found. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch, black crappie, largemouth bass, brown and yellow bullhead, hybrid and pumpkinseed sunfish, and white sucker were also found during test netting.  Bass averaged 10.4 inches while crappies averaged 9.0 inches in length. <br> \n <br> \nPreserving and restoring natural vegetation is critical in preserving water quality, fish habitat, and the entire lake ecosystem.  Lakeshore residents continue to work to protect natural shoreline and lake vegetation.  For example, the active lake association has been instrumental in acquiring and donating a large peninsula as a wildlife management area.  This group has also opposed large-scale shoreline development projects that they feel would forever change the character of Big Sugar Bush Lake.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Big Sugar Bush is a 472-acre, scenic lake in north-central Becker County, within the boundary of the White Earth Indian Reservation.  Water clarity is relatively high (average 17 feet), and a diverse fish community provides a variety of angling opportunities.  A standard fisheries survey was completed in June 2022 to evaluate the current status of the fish populations in Big Sugar Bush Lake.     <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike abundance was higher than normal for Big Sugar Bush Lake.  Pike were mostly small, averaging 17 inches long.  Walleye abundance was low and similar to what was observed in the late 90's.  Walleye ranged in size from 10 to 25 inches, with an average length of 18 inches.  Black Crappie abundance was lower than the last survey conducted in 2017, but still higher than average for Big Sugar Bush Lake.  Crappie had an average length of 10 inches and needed four years of growth to reach nine inches long.  Bluegill abundance was the third highest ever recorded, the first time it has reached this level since 1992.  Bluegill averaged eight inches long.  Largemouth Bass that were captured during the survey had an average size of 13 inches, with the largest bass measuring 17 inches.  Catch rates of Yellow Perch during fisheries surveys have never been high in Big Sugar Bush Lake and the 2022 survey was no exception.  Perch ranged in size from 6 to 10 inches long.  Other sampled fish species included Black, Brown and Yellow Bullhead, Pumpkinseed, Green Sunfish, and White Sucker.    <br> \n</p>",
