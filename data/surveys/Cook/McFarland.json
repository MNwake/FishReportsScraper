                "narrative": "<p>McFarland Lake is managed primarily for Walleye, and secondarily for Smallmouth Bass.  The objective of this survey was to evaluate the status of the Walleye and Smallmouth Bass populations in regards to long-range management goals identified for McFarland Lake. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance was about average compared to similar lakes in Northeastern Minnesota; however, it was the lowest ever observed for McFarland Lake. All Walleye collected in 2013 had been produced naturally, although no age groups appeared to be especially strong.  As has been the case for this lake historically, the  mean weight of Walleye was low compared to similar lakes primarily due to younger fish making up a majority of the sample.  Growth rates of Walleye were about average for the area; fish averaged 11.3 inches in length at the end of their third year.  Larger Walleye may be present in modest numbers as evidenced by a few fish over 20 inches in the 2013 assessment.    <br> \n <br> \nMcFarland Lake continues to support a high-quality Smallmouth Bass population.  Smallmouth Bass were abundant, and fast growing compared to similar lakes in the region. Ages 1-8 were all present in the sample indicating consistent reproductive success in the lake.  A majority of the Smallmouth Bass collected in 2013 were over 12 inches in length, including fish up to 18 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike abundance and size in 2013 was about average compared to similar lakes in the area, but was above average for the lake historically.  A majority of the Northern Pike sampled were two- and three-year-old fish that exhibited average growth rates for this lake type.  However, there are likely a few larger Northern Pike present within the lake as fish up to 30 inches in length were sampled. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch appear to be the primary forage species for Walleye in McFarland Lake.  Yellow Perch abundance was about average compared to similar lakes, and for this lake historically.  The average size of Yellow Perch fell within the normal range for the lake class, although only 16% of the catch was larger than 8 inches. <br> \n <br> \nLake Whitefish were present in average numbers in 2013, but their average size was large for this lake type.  A majority of the catch was greater than 19 inches, and fish up to 28.5 inches, and at least 11 years old, were observed.  Lake Whitefish growth rates were fast; fish averaged 21.3 inches at the end of their fifth year compared to 15.9 inches for the Grand Marais area.  While the 2013 Lake Whitefish catch suggests trophy angling opportunities exist, it appears there are few small fish available to provide high-quality forage for Northern Pike. Average numbers of White Sucker were sampled in 2013, but all appeared to be too large to serve as forage for Walleye or Northern Pike.   <br> \n</p>",

No age-5 walleye were taken, indicating that the 1992 year class was weak, otherwise natural reproduction has been good.  McFarland Lake seems to support a well-balanced fishery, with no stocking needed.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A temperature-dissolved oxygen profile was collected in the deepest basin on McFarland Lake on August 7th, 2023 to evaluate the amount of cold, oxygenated water (i.e., oxythermal habitat) available to Lake Whitefish and Cisco, also known as Tullibee. Based on the profile, the top of the thermocline (i.e., the location in the water column with the sharpest transition from warm to cold water) occurred at approximately 13 feet. Dissolved oxygen decreased to below 3.0 mg/L at 26.4 feet, which was below the thermocline, at the time of sampling. The temperature at which dissolved oxygen decreased to below 3.0 mg/L (i.e., TDO3, a single variable to characterize oxythermal habitat) was 8.9?C (48.0?F). <br> \n <br> \nTDO3 values cooler than 17.2?C for Lake Whitefish or 21.5?C for Cisco indicate that oxythermal conditions are favorable for both species. Dissolved oxygen concentrations below the thermocline indicate that suitable oxythermal habitat for Lake Whitefish and Cisco was available across a range of depths at the time of sampling. Data collected in 1988-2017 indicate suitable oxythermal habitat in most years, with the least favorable conditions recorded in 2017 (17.5?C). When adequate oxythermal habitat is available, Lake Whitefish or Cisco are not squeezed into unfavorable, warmer water conditions and therefore do not experience higher levels of stress.</p>",

All the walleye taken in 2003 had been produced naturally, with good year classes in 2001, 2000, and 1998.  Walleye growth rates had been slow for younger fish, probably because yellow perch abundance appeared to have been at a historic low in this lake in 2003.Northern pike abundance and size appeared to have been about average for a lake of this type, and for this lake historically.  Most of the northern pike catch consisted of two and three-year-old fish.  Growth rates had been fast, probably due to the presence of some small lake whitefish and northern cisco.Smallmouth bass were abundant and large, compared to similar lakes.  McFarland Lake has consistently supported a high-quality smallmouth bass population.  Their good average size in 2003 was due mostly to their fast growth; fish averaged 12.4 inches in length at the end of their fourth year, compared to an average length of 9.4 inches at that age in other lakes in this area.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>McFarland Lake is located on the edge of the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness (BWCAW) at the end of the Arrowhead Trail (County Road 16), approximately 35 miles by road from the City of Grand Marais. There is a DNR-owned public access within the state forest campground, which is located on the northeast shoreline of the lake. Most of the eastern shoreline of the lake has been developed.  <br> \n <br> \nMcFarland Lake is an Ecological Class 3 Lake; lakes of that class are typically deep with irregular shorelines, and have very clear, soft water. McFarland Lake is managed primarily for Walleye, and secondarily for Smallmouth Bass. Walleye were last stocked in McFarland Lake in 1987. Current management goals for the Walleye population include maintaining a population with a minimum gill net catch of 6.0 fish/net, with some fish over 18 inches present. Goals for Smallmouth Bass include maintaining a population in which at least half the catchable-sized fish sampled are 11 inches or longer in length, with a minimum gill net catch of 1.0 fish/net.   <br> \n <br> \nMcFarland Lake has historically produced above average numbers of small-medium sized Walleye. Walleye once again appeared abundant in McFarland Lake in 2017, after a lower catch was observed in 2013. Management goals for Walleye were met in 2017; the gill net catch was above average for Class 3 lakes, and included several fish that were 18 inches or longer. Walleye natural reproduction and recruitment appeared very consistent from 2013-2016. Walleye from those year classes comprised over 90 percent of the gill net sample, while the 2015 and 2016 year classes appeared above average in abundance. Walleye growth rates had been about average compared to other Class 3 lakes; fish reached a mean length of 14.6 inches by the end of their fourth year, compared to an average of 14.2 inches for similar lakes in the Grand Marais area. <br> \n <br> \nSmallmouth Bass continued to thrive in McFarland Lake in 2017, and should have provided excellent angling opportunities in recent years. The 2017 gill net catch was the highest ever recorded for the lake, and easily met the long-term catch goal for the lake. The size distribution of Smallmouth Bass sampled in 2017 was also impressive. Approximately 97 percent of the gill-net-sampled bass surpassed 11 inches in length, while 10 percent were at least 17 inches long. Smallmouth Bass up to 12 years of age were sampled in 2017, with strong year classes apparently produced in 2011 and 2012. Growth rates of Smallmouth Bass sampled in 2017 had been slightly above average; fish reached 12.6 inches at the end of their fifth year, compared to 11.8 inches in similar lakes in the area. <br> \n <br> \nMcFarland Lake has typically produced average numbers of Northern Pike, although results from the 2017 survey may indicate a there has been slight increase in Northern Pike abundance. The 2017 gill net catch was one of the higher catches observed for McFarland Lake, and was also above average compared to other lakes in this class. Northern Pike sampled in gill nets ranged from 12 to 30 inches in length, although fish in the 18-24-inch made up a majority of the sample. A total of eight year classes of Northern Pike were sampled in this survey, with the 2013 and 2014 year classes appearing most abundant. Growth rates of Northern Pike sampled in 2017 were about average; mean length of Northern Pike at the end of their fourth year was 18.8 inches, compared to a mean of 18.6 inches at that age in other area Class 3 lakes.  <br> \n <br> \nThe coldwater fish community in McFarland Lake consisted of Lake Whitefish, Cisco, and Burbot in 2017. The gill net catch of Lake Whitefish was low for Class 3 lakes supporting the species, but was similar to past catches in McFarland Lake. Six age classes (2-10 years old) of Lake Whitefish were sampled; however, only four-year-old fish appeared with any frequency. As in 2017, most surveys of McFarland Lake have captured very low numbers of small Cisco in standard gill nets. The population appears to be of the dwarf variety, which are typically too small to be effectively sampled in standard nets. As a result, we are unsure of the extant of the Cisco population in McFarland Lake based on these results. If a significant Cisco population were present in McFarland Lake, it would represent a high-quality forage source for Walleye and Northern Pike.  <br> \n <br> \nGill net catches for Yellow Perch and White Sucker in 2017 were similar to historical catches in the lake. Most of the Yellow Perch sampled in 2017 were small, although a few fish in the sample would have been large enough to draw angler interest. <br> \n  <br> \nMcFarland Lake, Pine Lake, Little John and John Lakes, the Royal River, and North and South Fowl Lakes, are designated infested waterbodies for Spiny Waterflea, a DNR-regulated aquatic invasive species (AIS). Anglers and boaters are reminded to review the recommended actions for cleaning watercraft and gear before and after accessing any waterbody, and to adhere to all Minnesota AIS laws to protect Minnesota lakes and rivers from additional infestations. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>McFarland Lake is a fairly deep medium-sized lake located in the Royal River watershed at the edge of the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness.  It hosts a small State campground, a small boat launch, and a few dozen private homes and cabins.  McFarland is currently managed mainly for Walleye and Smallmouth Bass.  The long-range goal for the Walleye population is to maintain a minimum gill net catch of 6.0 fish/net, with some fish over 18 inches present. Goals for the Smallmouth Bass population include maintaining a minimum proportional size distribution (PSD) of 50 (stock= 7 inches, quality= 11 inches), and a minimum gill net catch of 1.0 fish/net. Northern Pike, Lake Whitefish, and Yellow Perch have also contributed to the fishery on McFarland Lake. The 2021 standard survey was the third of three scheduled in the 2011 lake management plan (LMP) to monitor the fish community and summer water quality in the lake. The first two were completed as planned in 2013 and 2017. <br> \n <br> \nMcFarland Lake has historically produced above-average numbers of small-medium sized Walleye, and that was again the case in 2021.  The gill net catch fully met goals for the species from the 2011 LMP.  It exceeded the normal range for a lake of this type, but was just average for McFarland Lake, historically.  A wide range of sizes was included in the catch, including fish up to 25 inches in length.   Ten year classes (up to 12 years of age), all naturally produced, were represented in the catch.  Year classes produced in 2019, 2018, and 2015 appeared to have been fairly strong.  Growth of young Walleye had been about average for the area; fish reached a mean length of 12.1 inches at the end of their third year, compared to an area average of 11.9 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nSmallmouth Bass continued to thrive in McFarland Lake in 2021, with large numbers of fish present, and a high proportion of good-sized fish. The gill net catch was above the normal range for a lake of this type, although still just average for catches seen in McFarland Lake since 1991. Catch and size goals for the population were met.  Ninety-three percent of Smallmouth Bass over seven inches in length exceeded eleven inches, and 23% of the fish taken in gill nets were over 16 inches.  Production of young Smallmouth Bass appeared to have been good recently, with fairly high numbers of young fish (under three years of age) taken in 0.25-in-mesh trap nets in 2021. <br> \n <br> \nMcFarland Lake has typically produced average numbers of smaller Northern Pike, compared to other Class 3 Lakes.  The 2021 Northern Pike gill net catch tied the 2017 catch as one of the two highest observed to date for McFarland Lake, by a small margin.  Both catches surpassed the normal range for a lake of this type. Northern Pike sampled in gill nets ranged from 19 to 27 inches in length, although 19-23-inch fish comprised a majority of the sample. Smaller fish were scarce, although two were taken in 0.25-in-mesh trap nets. <br> \n <br> \nThe coldwater fish community in McFarland Lake consisted of Lake Whitefish, Cisco, and Burbot in 2021, but only Lake Whitefish were taken in this survey. The 2021 gill net catch of Lake Whitefish was low for a lake of this type, but was not unusually low for McFarland Lake.  As has often been the case in this lake, Lake Whitefish taken in survey gear were unusually large, with a mean weight that easily exceeded the normal range.  Nine age classes (fish two to 21 years of age) were sampled.   <br> \n <br> \nMost surveys of McFarland Lake have captured low numbers of small Cisco in standard gill nets, if they sampled any at all.  None were taken in 2021. Those results suggest the population might be of the dwarf variety, which would typically be too small to be vulnerable to standard gill nets. The 2016 survey of Pine Lake (16-0041), which directly feeds McFarland Lake, identified an abundant dwarf Cisco population through small-mesh gill net sampling, so it seems likely the population in McFarland is of the same variety. Abundance of Cisco in McFarland Lake is currently unknown. If a significant dwarf Cisco population were present it would represent a high-quality forage source for Walleye and Northern Pike.   Burbot have also been taken only occasionally in McFarland Lake. <br> \n <br> \nThe Yellow Perch gill net catch in 2021 was one of the higher catches seen in this lake historically, and exceeded the normal range for this type of lake.  However, fish taken in 2021 were small, with no fish larger than eight inches sampled.  The 2021 White Sucker gill net catch was low for this lake historically, and for a lake of this class. <br> \n <br> \nThe temperature-oxygen profile measured in the lake's main basin (at WQ-2) on 16 August found surface waters mixed and fairly warm to a depth of 22 ft.  At greater depths both water temperature and dissolved oxygen dropped.  No waters were cool enough, with enough dissolved oxygen, to support Lake Trout.  Cisco and Lake Whitefish would largely have been confined to a narrow band holding the coolest well-oxygenated waters in the lake, at depths of about 22 to 26 ft.  <br> \n <br> \nMcFarland Lake is infested with spiny waterflea.  Boaters should thoroughly clean and dry their watercraft and other equipment before moving to different waters.  Spiny waterflea can be moved from lake to lake on fishing line, so take some time to wipe lines down before leaving the lake. <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

THE SUCCESS OR IMPACT OF WALLEYE STOCKING CANNOT BE DETERMINED YET, STOCKING AND SAMPLING OVER A LONGER TIME SPAN IS NEEDED. THE SMALLMOUTH BASS POPULATION APPEARS TO BE HEALTHY. THERE IS A GOOD RANGE OF SIZES, WITH SOME OVER 15 INCHES AVAILABLE TO ANGLERS. THERE ARE ALSO SOME NORTHERN PIKE AND LARGE YELLOW PERCH AVAILABLE.</p>",
