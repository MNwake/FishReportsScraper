                "narrative": "<p>Eagles Nest Lake 3 is in Ecological Lake Class 5, which consists of 64 lakes in northeast Minnesota that have soft (unmineralized) and clear water.  Eagles Nest Lake 3 is larger, shallower, and has a more irregular shoreline shape than typical for this lake class.  Eagles Nest Lake 3 is a mesotrophic lake. Eagles Nest Lake 3 was thermally stratified on 08/15/2005 with a surface temperature of 69 F and a bottom temperature of 50 F.  Adequate oxygen for fish (more than 2 ppm) was retained to a depth of 27 ft, where the temperature was 65 F.  The inlet, from Eagles Nest Lake 4, has a beaver dam that limits fish movement.  The outlet, to Eagles Nest Lake 2, has no barrier to fish movement.  Lake bottom substrates along the shoreline of Eagles Nest Lake 3 are mostly boulder, rubble, and gravel.  Aquatic vegetation has largely disappeared since rusty crayfish first appeared in 1987.Fish sampling in the 2005 fish population assessment consisted of nine gillnet sets, twelve trapnet sets, and three small mesh smelt gillnets.  Nine previous investigations on this lake dating back to 1956 consisted of 4-12 gillnet sets.  Trapnets (9-12 sets) were used in five of these previous investigations.  Small mesh smelt gillnets were also set in 2000.Fish populations in 2005 were dominated by walleye, followed by white sucker and northern pike.  Bass populations were likely greater than indicated by their abundance in this assessment because bass are known to be difficult to catch in these sampling nets.  Bluegill numbers were much lower in 2005 than in other recent investigations on this lake.Walleye numbers in 2005 (12.8/gillnet) were in the fourth quartile for this lake class and were higher than the median catch of 6.9/gillnet in all investigations on this lake.  The high walleye catches in 2000 (12.3/gillnet) and 2005 indicate that walleye are reproducing very successfully despite the abundant population of rusty crayfish in the lake.  Smelt, should they become abundant in this lake, may threaten walleye reproduction as they have negatively affected walleye populations in other lakes.Walleye sizes in 2005 averaged 13.9\" (1.1 lb), which is in the second quartile for this lake class.  The largest walleye was 28.0\".  Many of the walleye captured in the standard gillnets (42 percent) were age three, from the 2002 year class.  Good numbers of small walleye (young-of-year and age one) were also captured in the small mesh smelt gillnets in 2005.  Growth of walleye through age three was somewhat slower than normal (in the second quartile for area lakes), while growth of walleye age four and older was somewhat faster than normal (in the third quartile).  Of 96 walleye stomachs examined in 2005, 57 percent were empty, 24 percent contained perch, 14 percent contained unidentified fish remains, and 5 percent contained rusty crayfish.White sucker have always been fairly common in this lake, and minnow dealers used to trap spawning suckers at the inlet from Eagles Nest Lake 4 many years ago.  Sucker numbers in 2005 (7.3/gillnet) were in the third quartile for this lake class and were similar to the median sucker catch of 6.8/gillnet in all investigations on this lake.Northern pike numbers in 2005 (1.3/gillnet) were in the first quartile for this lake class and were lower than the median catch of 2.9/gillnet in all investigations on this lake.  Pike sizes in 2005 averaged 24.0\" (3.0 lb), which is in the third quartile for this lake class.  The largest pike was 36.6\".  Pike scales were moderately difficult to read, and little confidence can be placed in the age and growth information for this species.  All nine pike stomachs examined were empty.Smallmouth bass numbers in 2005 (1.7/gillnet) were in the third quartile for this lake class and were similar to the median catch of 2.0/gillnet in all investigations on this lake.  Smallmouth sizes in 2005 averaged 14.8\" (2.1 lb), which is in the fourth quartile for this lake class.  Smallmouth growth was faster than normal (in the fourth quartile) by area standards.  Six of seven smallmouth stomachs examined in 2005 contained rusty crayfish, and one stomach was empty.Bluegill numbers in 2005 (1.6/trapnet) were much lower than in most previous investigations on this lake.  Young sunfish use aquatic vegetation as nursery areas, and it is likely that the loss of vegetation due to rusty crayfish has increased sunfish mortality.Rusty crayfish get entangled in the gillnets, and they were first observed in Eagles Nest Lake 3 in 1990, when 13/gillnet were captured.  Their numbers increased to 135/gillnet in 1995, 247/gillnet in 2000, and 130/gillnet in 2005.Rainbow smelt were first observed in Eagles Nest Lakes 1 & 2 in the 1980 investigation.  Three were captured in the smelt gillnets in Eagles Nest Lake 3 in 2005, the first appearance of this species in this lake.  Smelt are predatory fish and can negatively affect reproduction of other fish species.Neascus was present on many of the game fish examined in 2005.  Bass tapeworm were present in many of the smallmouth bass, and yellow grub was present on some of the yellow perch.  All of these parasites are native and common to the area.  They cannot infect humans, are often removed by filleting the fish, and are killed at temperatures used to cook fish.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Eagles Nest Lake 3 is in Ecological Lake Class 5, which consists of 64 lakes in northeast Minnesota that have soft (unmineralized) and clear water.  Eagles Nest Lake 3 is larger, has a higher proportion of littoral area, and has a more irregular shoreline shape than most of the lakes in this lake class.  Eagles Nest Lake 3 ranks as mesotrophic according to Carlson's Trophic State Index, using a Secchi water clarity of 5.2 m, chlorophyll-a of 3.1 ppb, and total phosphorus of 30 ppb.Eagles Nest Lake 3 was thermally stratified on 08/14/2000 and retained 2 ppm oxygen to a depth of 26 ft, where the temperature was 63 F.  The inlet from Eagles Nest Lake 4 has a beaver dam which limits fish movement.  The outlet to Eagles Nest Lake 2 has no barrier to fish movement.  Shoal substrates in Eagles Nest Lake 3 are mostly boulder, rubble, and gravel.  Aquatic vegetation is mostly confined to bays and, according to local residents, has declined since rusty crayfish first appeared in 1987.Fish sampling in the 2000 population assessment consisted of nine gillnet sets, 12 trapnet sets, and 3 small mesh smelt gillnet sets.  Eight previous investigations dating back to 1956 consisted of 4-12 gillnet sets.  Trapnets (9-11 sets) were used in four of these previous investigations.The total catch of fish (all species combined) in the gillnets in 2000 of 33.9 fish/net was at the median for this lake class and was higher than the median catch of 19.6 fish/net in all investigations on this lake.  By weight, the total catch in 2000 of 47.8 lb/net was at the third quartile for this lake class and was higher than the median catch of 33.8 lb/net in all investigations on this lake.  More walleye and white sucker were caught in the gillnets in 2000 than in most previous investigations.  Lake Class 5 is one of the most productive lake classes in northeast Minnesota, in terms of gillnet catches of fish.The total catch of fish in the trapnets in 2000 of 44.5 fish/net (8.5 lb/net) was higher than the median catch of 19.8 fish/net (7.3 lb/net) in all investigations on this lake.  More bluegill sunfish were caught in 2000 than in previous investigations on this lake.Fish populations in 2000 were dominated by walleye, white sucker, and bluegill sunfish, followed by northern pike and smallmouth bass.  Smelt were not captured despite their fifteen year presence in Eagles Nest Lake 1&2, just downstream of Eagles Nest Lake 3.  Other fish species were present in low numbers.  Walleye numbers in 2000 (12.3/gillnet) were in the fourth quartile for this lake class and were higher than the median catch of 6.7/gillnet in all investigations on this lake. Walleye sizes in 2000 averaged 14.6\" (1.1 lb), which was in the second quartile for this lake class; the largest walleye (caught in a small mesh smelt net) was 28.2\".  Most walleye (78 percent) were ages two and three, from the 1997 and 1998 year classes.  Walleye growth was generally in the third or fourth quartile for area lakes, although growth of age one walleye was in the first quartile.White sucker numbers in 2000 (9.9/gillnet) were in the fourth quartile for this lake class and were higher than the median catch of 6.6/gillnet in all investigations on this lake.  Sucker sizes in 2000 averaged 16.7\" (2.0 lb), which was in the third quartile for this lake class; the largest sucker was 23.1\".Bluegill numbers have increased over time in Eagles Nest Lake 3; their numbers in 2000 (36.7/trapnet) were in the fourth quartile for this lake class and were higher than the median catch of 12.2/trapnet in all investigations on this lake.  Bluegill sizes in 2000 averaged 4.9\" (0.10/lb), which was in the first quartile for this lake class; the largest bluegill (caught in a gillnet) was 9.3\".  Bluegill growth was in the first quartile for area lakes.Northern pike numbers in 2000 (3.1/gillnet) were near the median for this lake class and were similar to the median catch of 3.0/gillnet in all investigations on this lake.  Pike sizes in 2000 averaged 22.8\" (2.4 lb), which was in the second quartile for this lake class; the largest pike was 29.5\".  Pike scales were difficult to read, but pike growth appeared to be in the second quartile for area lakes.Smallmouth bass numbers in 2000 (3.1/gillnet) were in the fourth quartile for this lake class and were higher than the median catch of 2.2/gillnet in all investigations on this lake.  Smallmouth sizes in 2000 averaged 14.2\" (1.9 lb), which was in the fourth quartile for this lake class; the largest smallmouth was 18.9\".  Smallmouth growth appeared to be in the third quartile for area lakes.Neascus (black spot) was present in most of the bluegill examined in 2000, and most of the smallmouth bass had bass tapeworm.  Neascus and bass tapeworm are parasites that are native to the area and are common.  They cannot infect humans, are often removed by filleting, and are killed at temperatures used to cook fish.Rusty crayfish were first observed in Eagles Nest Lake 3 in the 1987 investigation.  Their numbers have since grown, to 13/gillnet in 1990, 135/gillnet in 1995, and to 247/gillnet in 2000.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Eagles Nest #3 is in Ecological Lake Class 5, which is comprised of 64 medium sized, deep, and clear lakes in northeast Minnesota.  Eagles Nest #3 is larger than most of these lakes, and has a higher proportion of shallow water area.Eagles Nest #3 stratifies thermally in midsummer and has less than 2 ppm oxygen below about 30'.  The East Two River enters from Eagles Nest #4 and exits to Eagles Nest #2.  There are periodic and seasonal barriers to fish movement; beaver dams and small rapids.The most common shallow water bottom types were boulder, rubble, and gravel.  Most aquatic vegetation was in bays.  Numerous aquatic plant types were identified, but the most common were the pondweeds, especially Robbin's, largeleaf, and flatstem pondweeds. The total catch of fish in the gillnets in 1995 (all species combined) was below normal for this lake class in terms of the number of fish caught.  However, the presence of many large walleye and white sucker resulted in a normal catch in terms of the total weight of the fish.  The total catch of fish in the trapnets was higher than normal in terms of the number of fish caught.  However, the presence of many small bluegill resulted in a normal catch in terms of the weight of the fish.Fish populations in 1995 were dominated by walleye, northern pike, bluegill, and white sucker.  Walleye numbers in 1995 were normal for this lake class and were near the long term average of 7/gillnet in this lake.  Walleye were present from many year classes, indicating good natural reproduction.  Walleye sizes were good, averaging 16\"; the largest was 29\" (9 lb).  Walleye growth (15\" at age four), was faster than average for the area.  Neascus was observed in about half of the walleye.  Neascus, also known as \"black spot\", is a parasite in or beneath the skin of fish.  It is usually removed by filleting, is killed by cooking, and is harmless to humans.Northern pike numbers in 1995 were normal for this lake class, but were higher than the long term average of 3/gillnet in this lake.  Pike sizes were small, averaging 19\"; the largest was 30\" (4 lb).  Pike reproduction was good, but growth (18\" at age four) was slow.  Neascus was present on half of the pike.Bluegill numbers in 1995 were normal for this lake class, but have increased in each trapnetting since the initial survey in 1956.  Bluegill sizes were somewhat small, averaging 5\"; only one percent were larger than 7\".  Bluegill growth (3\" at age four) was slow.  Neascus was present on half of the bluegill.Smallmouth bass numbers appeared to be normal for this lake class, while largemouth bass numbers were lower than normal.  Bass are very hard to capture in nets, which is why night electrofishing was done on this lake.  Smallmouth sizes averaged 15\" in the gillnets, the largest was 18\".  About 10 percent of smallmouth had Neascus.  Largemouth sizes were small, the largest was 12\".   Rusty crayfish, a large \"exotic\" crayfish from the Ohio River Valley, were first observed in 1987 and are now abundant.  These crayfish have been known to replace native crayfish populations and to eradicate much of the aquatic vegetation in lakes where they were introduced.  Rainbow smelt, originally from the Atlantic Ocean, have been present in Eagles Nest #1 & #2 since the early 1980's.  No smelt have been observed in Eagles Nest #3.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Eagles Nest 3 Lake (EN3) is one of four lakes that comprise the Eagles Nest chain of lakes.  These lakes are located seven miles east of Soudan in northeastern St. Louis County.  EN3 is a 1027-acre lake with a maximum depth of 49 feet.  Based on physical and chemical characteristics of the lake, EN3, is categorized in ecological lake class 5.  All of the Eagles Nest chain of lakes are in lake class 5.  Most of the south shore of the lake including the public access is within Bearhead Lake State Park.  A state park sticker is needed to use the access.  EN3 is managed primarily for walleye and northern pike. <br> \n <br> \nAs part of the sampling protocol, an aquatic plant vegetation survey was conducted on EN3.  All aquatic plants identified in 2010 had an abundance rating of rare.  There appears to have been a change in the abundance of aquatic plants between 1995 and 2010.  Aquatic plants were more abundant in 1995 than in 2010.  Rusty crayfish, a large invasive crayfish from the Ohio River valley, were first observed in 1987 and now are quite abundant around the entire lake.  These crayfish are known to displace native crayfish populations and eliminate much of the aquatic plants in the lakes where introduced. <br> \n <br> \nEN3 is one of the more highly developed lakes in the Tower Fisheries area. The number of lake homes increased from 43 in 1956, to 140 in 2010.  There are more areas of the lake being developed especially on the south-central shore.  Seventy-five percent of the shoreline on EN3 is privately owned and subject to development.  This increasing development around the lake and within the lakeshed can degrade water quality and impact valuable shoreline habitat.  Lakeshore owners can minimize their impact on the shoreline and maintain a more natural setting while decreasing annual maintenance.  For more information on how to accomplish this, contact the nearest area fisheries office or go to www.mndnr.gov website.   <br> \n <br> \nEN3 is a popular destination for walleye anglers.  Anglers can expect to catch walleye up to 29 inches with numerous fish in the 13-15 inch range.  In 2010, EN3 walleye abundance was comparable to what was found in 1977 the highest of any assessment conducted on the lake.  The abundance rating was higher than what you would typically find in other lake class 5 lakes.  In the 2010 walleye sample, ten different year classes were identified indicating consistent recruitment, all from natural reproduction.  Historically, walleye stocking was conducted from 1925 to 1985 using both fry and fingerlings.  It was determined that stocked years were no stronger than non-stocked years in developing year classes.  The predominant substrates found around EN3 are rubble (size of your fist), boulder and gravel.  Rubble is an excellent spawning substrate for walleye, and it occurred at 75% of the shoreline sampling stations around the lake.  The 2007 year class (age 3) was the most abundant year class comprising 45% of the sample and averaging 13 inches in length.  Of all the lake classes in the Tower Fisheries area, lake class 5 have the best growth rates for walleye.   At the end of three years of growth, an average EN3 walleye is 10.9 inches long compared to the Tower area lake class 5 average of 13.8 inches long.  <br> \n <br> \nThere are a few larger northern pike in EN3 for anglers to catch, however, it would be advisable for anglers to release these fish.  This low- density population is needed to sustain the natural reproduction in the lake.  In 2010, pike abundance was the lowest recorded on EN3 and lower than what you would typically find on lake class 5 lakes.  The four pike captured in 2010 ranged in length from 21.1 to 37.4 inches.   Three year classes were identified (2005-07).  Very little ideal pike spawning habitat exists in the lake.   <br> \n <br> \nIn 2010, only four bluegill were captured.  Bluegill abundance was the lowest recorded and comparable to the initial survey conducted in 1956. In 2000, bluegill was quite abundant and above average for a lake class 5 lake. This downward trend in abundance appears to be connected to reductions in plant biomass by rusty crayfish.  Interestingly, rock bass, a member of the sunfish family, appear to be quite abundant.  <br> \n <br> \nEvening spring electrofishing, a specialized sampling technique, was employed to sample both largemouth and smallmouth bass.  Twenty smallmouth bass and one largemouth bass were captured for on-time catch per unit effort of 11.1/hour and 0.6/hour, respectively.  Smallmouth bass ranged in length from 4.3 to 18.9 inches and were composed of six different year classes with the 2005 year class (age 5) comprising 45% of the sample.  YOY smallmouth bass were sampled around the entire lake indicating consistent natural reproduction for 2010. <br> \n <br> \nWhite suckers are another species commonly found in lake class 5 lakes and was also the case in EN3. Suckers are an excellent forage fish especially for large walleye and northern pike.  Yellow perch is another forage fish sampled in moderate numbers that are an excellent forage fish.  Few perch sampled were of a size that would be desirable by anglers. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Eagles Nest Lake 3 (EN3) is located approximately 9 miles NE of Tower. EN3 is similar to the other Eagles Nest Lakes and is moderately developed with homes and cabins. The boundaries of Bear Head Lake State Park include a portion of EN3 near the SE side. There is a public access with a concrete planked boat ramp located near the SE end that is also within the park and a park sticker must be purchased to use this landing. Boaters should use caution on EN3 with a number of shallow rock reefs being present, most of which are unmarked.\n\nThere have been changes occurring to the aquatic community of EN3 as indicated by the results of the last several surveys. In 2015, the fish community was sampled by gill nets, trap nets, smelt gill nets and night electrofishing targeting bass. Walleye were the most common species sampled in the gill nets (38%) even though the catch was the lowest since the 1995 survey. However, smallmouth bass numbers in the electrofishing sample were at a record high in 2015. \n\nSmelt and rusty crayfish are non-native species that were likely unintentionally introduced as bait in the Eagles Nest chain. Smelt spawn in the outlet of EN3 where the fish run upstream from Eagles Nest 2. Since 1984, there has been only year smelt were sampled in Eagles Nest 3. Three smelt were caught in 2005. Rusty crayfish numbers in 2015 were below the historic average and have been declining since the peak of 247.0/gill net in 2000. The lake has experienced a loss of submerged aquatic vegetation from the high population of rusty crayfish and it appears that the some of the fish community has suffered from this loss of habitat.\n\nWalleye abundance in 2015 was average for all surveys on this lake and higher than the average of 5.0/gill net for similar type lakes. The average walleye sampled was 14 inches long and about 4 years old. The largest walleye sampled was nearly 29 inches long. Approximately eighty-one percent of the walleye sampled were between the ages of 1 and 5. All walleye on EN3 are due to natural reproduction. Crayfish were observed in some of the walleye stomach samples. Smelt would typically be found in walleye stomachs if present also and this has not been observed. \n\nFive other species were sampled in the gill nets in 2015 including smallmouth bass, northern pike, yellow perch, rock bass and white sucker. Northern pike numbers were below average, however the average length of 27 inches was above average and the largest pike sampled was nearly 40 inches in length.  \n\nRock bass was the most common species sampled from the trap nets in 2015. Only one bluegill was sampled and this species has been declining in abundance since the 2000 survey when over 400 bluegill were sampled in the trap nets. Similarly, neither black crappie nor pumpkinseed have been sampled since the early 2000's. The rusty crayfish population peak coincided with a dramatic decrease in submerged aquatic plant abundance likely contributing to the observed changes in the panfish community. \n\nSmallmouth bass abundance based on electrofishing was well above the historic average of 13.4/hr. The average smallmouth sampled was almost 14 inches long which is larger than the historic average length of 11 inches. Smallmouth were sampled up to 20 inches long.\n\nLargemouth bass were also sampled by electrofishing. Largemouth numbers were much lower than the historic average of 5.8/hr. The average largemouth sampled was 15 inches which is larger than the average of 12 inches. The biggest largemouth sampled was almost 20 inches long.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Eagles Nest 3 is a 1,028 acre lake located eight miles east of Tower.  It is accessed by a concrete ramp off the Eagles Nest 3 access road off the Bear Head Lake State Park Road.  A state park vehicle permit is required to launch and park at this access.  The lake has a maximum depth of 49 feet and had light green colored water at the time of this survey due to a slight algae bloom.  On August 10, 2020 the lake was thermally stratified with a surface temperature of 73 F and a bottom temperature of 49 F.  Oxygen levels were adequate for gamefish to 28 feet where the temperature was 60 degrees.  Lake bottom substrates along the shoreline are mostly bedrock, gravel, and sand with some muck in the bays.  Aquatic vegetation is sparse due to the rusty crayfish infestation. \n\nThe overall gillnet catch rate for all fish combined was 25.9 fish/net which was above average compared to past surveys on the lake.  Yield was 30.0 lbs/net which was slightly below average.  Fish species sampled were walleye, white sucker, rock bass, northern pike, smallmouth bass, and yellow perch.  Trap nets caught fish at an overall rate of 11.3 fish/net which was right at the lakes historic average.  Yield was 10.0 lbs/net which was slightly better than normal for Eagles Nest 3.  The only additional species sampled in trap nets, that weren't also observed in gill nets, were bluegill and largemouth bass.  \n\nOne hundred seventy-three walleye were sampled in gill nets for a catch rate of 19.2 fish/net, which was well above average compared to other similar lakes and the highest gill net catch rate on record for the lake.  This catch rate was also very good compared to other walleye populations in area lakes.  Walleye lengths ranged from 7.5 to 26 inches with an average of nearly 13 inches.  Walleye growth was better than average with four year old fish averaging better than 14 inches.  Ages ranged from 0 to 16 years with the 2017, 2018, and 2019 year class representing just over 75% of the catch. \n\nSpring night electrofishing was used to assess smallmouth and largemouth bass.  The lake was electofished the night of June 16th.  No largemouth were sampled but forty-six smallmouth were captured for a catch rate of 28.5 smallmouth bass/hour, which was the highest catch rate on record for the lake and very good compared to other smallmouth lakes in the area.  Lengths ranged from 6 to 18.5 inches with an average of just over 13 inches.  Eight additional smallmouth were sampled in gill nets and five more were caught in trap nets.  Those sizes ranged from 7 to over 19 inches.  Growth rates were very good with the average smallmouth reaching over 12 inches by four years old.  Not all fish were aged, but the largest fish was aged to an astounding 25 years old.  This was likely the oldest smallmouth aged to date in the state.  \n\nThe northern pike gillnet catch rate was 1.0 fish/net which was average compared to past surveys on the lake.  The average weight was over four pounds which was very good compared to other similar lakes.  Lengths ranged from 22 to over 32 inches with an average of nearly 27 inches.  These sizes were similar to recent past surveys on Eagles Nest 3.  \n\nThe bluegill trapnet catch was 1.5 fish/net which was low compared to other similar lakes and shows a continued decline since around the year 2000.  This drop was likely due to a decrease in vegetation and other available habitat due to rusty crayfish.  Sizes of bluegill in 2020 ranged from 4 to 9 inches with an average of nearly 6 inches.  \n\nSmall mesh gills nets were set to monitor for invasive rainbow smelt present in downstream Eagles Nest 1 and 2 lakes. In six surveys since 1984, the only smelt ever caught were three fish in 2005. These nets did catch a considerable amount of small yellow perch in 2020 however at 41.5/net.\n\nRusty crayfish have been in Eagles Nest 3 since at least 1987.  The 2020 catch rate was 158.9 crayfish/net which was the second highest catch rate on record for the lake.    \n</p>",
