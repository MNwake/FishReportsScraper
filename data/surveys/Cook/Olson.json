Management goals for the lake, from the current (2018) lake management plan, are to maintain a minimum Rainbow Trout trap net catch of 0.75 fish/set, with some fish over 14 inches present.  This was not a scheduled survey under the 2018 plan.  Because the winter of 2017-18 had been harsh and long, we conducted winter dissolved oxygen testing on Olson Lake, where at least one past partial winterkill was suspected to have occurred.  When the results of that testing suggested a winterkill was a possibility in 2018, this follow-up targeted survey was done to determine whether there had been any over-winter survival of stocked trout, and to collect some additional information on late-summer temperature-oxygen conditions. <br> \n <br> \nWinter testing on 12 April at three sites found dissolved oxygen levels of less than 2 ppm just under the ice at all locations, with oxygen levels under 1 ppm at greater depths.  Although other signs of winterkill were not observed (no dead fish, no hydrogen sulfide smell), it seemed that at least a partial winterkill could have been possible. <br> \n <br> \nFollow-up testing on 22 August, using a single over-night graduated-mesh monofilament gill net set, captured two Rainbow Trout that had been stocked in the fall of 2017.  Netting results gave no indication of abundance; they merely confirmed some over-winter survival.  They did not rule out a partial winterkill. <br> \n <br> \nThe temperature-oxygen profile measured on 22 August found conditions suitable for Rainbow Trout (water temperature <= 70 F, dissolved oxygen > 5 ppm) from the surface to a depth of 10 ft.  At the testing site waters were stratified, but dissolved oxygen in colder waters below the surface layer was too low to support trout (or fish of any kind).  Surface water temperatures may already have begun to cool going into the fall, but it seemed likely that even earlier in the summer, some waters suitable for Rainbow Trout would have been present. </p>",

The lake can be accessed from a brushy spur trail off a rough logging road that begins at the USFS Two Island Lake Campground. In the winter, the logging road is part of the Gunflint snowmobile trail system. High clearance vehicles or foot travel are recommended for reaching Olson Lake during the open-water season.  <br> \n <br> \nOlson Lake has been stocked with Brook Trout and Rainbow Trout at various times since 1962. In 2007, management was shifted from Brook Trout to Rainbow Trout with the hope that Rainbow Trout would perform better under the less-than-ideal water quality conditions observed in this lake. The 2017 targeted survey of Olson Lake was the first completed since annual Rainbow Trout stocking was initiated in 2009. Currently, the lake is stocked annually with 1,500 fingerling Rainbow Trout in the fall. The long-term goal for Rainbow Trout management in Olson Lake is to maintain a population with a minimum catch in fall trap net sets of 0.75 fish/net, with some fish over 14 inches. <br> \n <br> \nInclement weather encountered during the 2017 survey of Olson Lake resulted in one gill net and five 0.75-inch-mesh trap nets being set for 48 hours before being pulled. Therefore, we could not directly evaluate the trap net catch goal set for the population from these results. The size goal set for Olson Lake was apparently met in 2017. A total of ten Rainbow Trout were taken in trap net sets in 2017, with those fish ranging in length from 6.1 to 15.2 inches. Two Rainbow Trout, 12.4 and 13.7 inches long, were taken in the gill net set. Two fish from the fall 2017 fingerling stocking (stocked about a month prior to the survey) were included in the 2017 catch; the rest were apparently two-year-old (nearly three) survivors of the 2015 fingerling stocking. Those fish ranged in length from 12.0 to 15.2 inches at capture. Rainbow Trout growth may have been somewhat slower than average; fish reached a mean length of 10.1 inches by the end of their second year, compared to an average of 11.6 inches in other Rainbow Trout lakes in the Grand Marais area. <br> \n <br> \nAs of 2017, no aquatic invasive species (AIS) had been documented in Olson Lake. Anglers and boaters are reminded to review the recommended actions for cleaning watercraft and gear before and after accessing a waterbody, and to adhere to all Minnesota AIS laws to protect Minnesota lakes and rivers from additional infestations. <br> \n</p>",
