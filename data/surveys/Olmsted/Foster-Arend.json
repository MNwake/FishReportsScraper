                "narrative": "<p>Foster Arend Lake is an 18 acre former gravel pit located in Foster Arend Park in Rochester.  The park provides ample parking and a handicapped accessible fishing pier is present.  A beach with consession stand and restrooms is also located in the park. <br> \n <br> \nDue to the steep dropping shoreline trap netting is not effective therefore electrofishing was used to sample the gamefish population.  The total catch was low.  Twenty-eight bluegill, 18 largemouth bass, 3 green sunfish, and 1 black crappie were collected.  Bluegill were small with an average length of 5.2 inches.  Largemouth bass had a mean length of 12.4 inches and a maximum size of 20.8 inches. Several additional large bass were observed but not captured.   <br> \n <br> \nFoster Arend Lake is unique in that it is managed as a two-story fishery with the stocking of catchable size rainbow trout.  In this evaluation, numerous rainbow trout were observed.  The management plan for Foster-Arend calls for 10,000 rainbow trout to be stocked annually and they are very popular with anglers, particularly during the ice fishing season.  </p>",

Crappies and bluegill are of a borderline size, which may or may not be acceptable to anglers. Walleyes were stocked by the previous owner and will provide a short term fishery of only a few years. Although white bass are present, no reproduction is possible and fishing opportunity is limited to a short period of time. Crappies, bluegills, largemouth bass and bullheads make up the present fishable population.</p>",
