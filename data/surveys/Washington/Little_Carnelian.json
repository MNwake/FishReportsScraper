The lack of public access also limits angling to riparian owners and their guests.Bluegill are the most abundant species.  The 1997 netting shows a dramatic increase in the bluegill population, but domination by small fish - average size was 5 inches.  Pumpkinseed, hybrid sunfish, and green sunfish are also abundant but small.  Neascus (black spot) is present in about 10-20% of the sunfish.  Black crappie are present in low to moderate numbers, but larger size than the sunfish - lengths ranged from 6.5 to 13 inches with an 8 inch average and 25% being over 8 inches long.  Northern pike numbers have increased from recent surveys, and size is acceptable - lengths ranged from 14 to 31 inches with a 22 inch avergae.  Yellow perch are present in low numbers and are small.  Largemouth bass are also present, but their population status is unknown because they were not adequately sampled by the gear used during this survey.   </p>",

IN ADDITION TO THESE, PUMPKINSEEDS, HYBRID SUNFISH, AND LOW NUMBERS OF GOLDEN SHINERS AND WHITE SUCKERS ARE PRESENT. BLUEGILLS ARE PRESENT AT SOMEWHAT BELOW LOCAL MEDIAN LEVELS BUT ARE DOMINATED BY SMALLER SIZE CLASSES. NORTHERN PIKE EXHIBIT AVERAGE GROWTH RATES.
