                "narrative": "<p>Lake Eleven is a 290 acre lake located in Kanabec County that has been assigned to lake class 39.  The lake is managed primarily for walleye and secondly for northern pike, largemouth bass, blugill sunfish, and black crappie.Historical records indicate that fish stocking dates back to 1921 and consisted of such species as northern pike, largemouth bass, black crappie, bluegill sunfish, and walleye.  Northern pike were last stocked in 1976, black crappie in 1990, and bluegill sunfish in 1984, while walleye stocking still remains in place.  Recent management plans (1986-present) call for walleye stocking every three years.  Preceeding 1986, walleye stocking was sporatic.A population assessment was conducted to evaluate the current fish population status during the week of July 6, 1998.  Spring night electrofishing, six gill nets, nine trap nets, and shoreline seining were the selected methods for sampling.Walleye abundance along with the average weight (1.8 lbs.) were typical of normal for this type of lake.  The current catch rate was found to be up from the 1993 catch.  Lengths ranged from 13.3 to 23.9 inches with an average length of 17.0 inches.  Of the 31 walleye captured, 74% were 15 inches or greater in length.  Ninety-seven percent of the fish sampled were from the 1992, 1994, and 1995 year classes.  These year classes were most likely the result of stocking, since stocking of fingerling and yearling walleye took place during 1992 and 1995.  Only one fish was determined to be from a year class when stocking did not occur.  Previous surveys have indicated the presence of year classes during non-stocked years, but fish numbers have been low within these year classes.  This suggests that natural reproduction may be occuring during some years in very low numbers and has been insufficient to sustain a suitable walleye population.  Lake Eleven walleye growth was typical of normal when compared to statwide averages.Abundance of northern pike was found to be normal, while the average weight, at 1.8 lbs., was below normal for a lake of this type.  Measured northern pike ranged from 11.7 to 32.9 inches with an average length of 17.6 inches.  Growth was within a normal range when compared to statewide averages.Nighttime spring electrofishing was used to capture largemouth bass for analysis.  On May 26, 1998, four electrofishing runs sampled shallow water areas suitable for spawning bass.  A catch rate of 12.9 fish/hour (on-time) was determined.  Although this appears to be somewhat low, catch rate averages for this type of sampling by lake type have not been formally developed for comparison.  Bass lengths ranged from 7.4 to 17.5 inches with an average length of 13.1 inches.  When compared to statewide averages, largemouth growth was at a normal rate.For lakes of this type, bluegill sunfish numbers were well above normal while the average weight was within a normal range.  Fish lengths ranged from 3.2 to 8.7 inches with an average length of  6.0 inches.Black crappie abundance along with the average weight were representative of normal when compared to similar lakes.  Sampled crappie lengths ranged from 5.6 to 10.7 inches with an average length of 8.3 inches.Numbers of yellow perch sampled were below the normal level for this type of lake, while the average weight was within the normal range.  Measured yellow perch ranged in length from 5.3 to 10.5 inches with an average length of 7.5 inches.Four shoreline seine hauls were conducted to evaluate natural reproduction success.  Bluegill sunfish and yellow perch showed very successful reproduction while black crappie, largemouth bass, and pumpkinseed sunfish were found in low numbers.Other fish species captured during the 1998 population assessment included; black, brown, and yellow bullhead, hybrid sunfish, pumpkinseed sunfish, and Johnny darter.  For this type of lake, black, brown and yellow bullhead were below normal in numbers and pumpkinseed sunfish were normal in abundance.</p>",

Despite being shallow with a 13 foot maximum, the fertile lake maintains good oxygen levels throughout the winter.  Angling pressure can be high at times, especially in the winter and early summer seasons.  Anglers can expect quality-size Northern Pike and Largemouth Bass, which average nearly 23 and 15 inches respectively.  The Walleye abundance improved slightly since the previous assessment in 2008, but Yellow Perch numbers continue to slip.  The Black Crappie and Bluegill catch was again higher than normal for the lake type.  Spring and summer catch rates were very similar for both species.  In the spring netting effort, Black Crappie averaged over 9 inches and Bluegill over 7 inches.</p>",

Ten sampling sites were evenly spaced around the shoreline and each site was sampled by backpack electrofishing, and/or seining.  Nearshore sampling captured 8 species of fish; Bluegill, Black Crappie, Largemouth Bass, Yellow Perch, Black Bullhead, Yellow Bullhead, Pumpkinseed Sunfish, and Tadpole Madtom. <br> \nThe nearshore fish survey data is combined with gill net and trap net data from previous Lake Eleven surveys to describe the fish community and provide a fish-based Index of Biotic Integrity (FIBI) score based on expectations for similar lakes.  The FIBI score for Lake Eleven based on this survey is above the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes. <br> \nThis survey is contributing to a watershed assessment process in coordination with the MN Pollution Control Agency. Lake Eleven is located in the Kettle River Watershed.  For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website. <br> \n</p>",

The walleye was slightly high at 4.16 per set and averaged about 1.5 pounds.  The yellow perch and white sucker both had low population figures.  The bluegill at 4.50 per set was very low and has shown a severe decline from the 1972 and 1977 surveys.  The black crappie and pumpkinseed had low populations.  The black bullhead was very low while the brown and yellow bullheads had low populations.  The largemouth bass was taken only in the shoreline seining for natural reproduction.  Lake Eleven is known to be an excellent largemouth bass lake.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>  DNR Fisheries crews completed a lake survey on Lake Eleven in July of 1993.  Trap nets, gill nets, shoreline seining, and electrofishing were the methods used to evaluate the fish population.  Compared with previous surveys, numbers of large predators such as walleye and northern pike have decreased, while panfish numbers have remained the same.  All of the walleyes netted in this survey were found to be from a single stocking in 1986.  The lake has been stocked twice since then, in 1989 and 1992, but none of these fish showed up in nets.  The number of walleyes netted was small compared with averages for similar lakes.  All of the walleyes were from 19-24 inches in length.  Northern pike numbers were also low compared to similar lakes.  Northerns had a length range of 15-29 inches, and ages were determined to be 2-5 years.  Some young-of-year northerns were seen during shoreline seining.  A small percentage of the northern pike population in Lake Eleven is of the silver phase, which lacks the markings normally found on northerns.  Largemouth bass were found to be fairly abundant during spring electrofishing.  Bass of all sizes up to at least 18 inches were present, and large numbers of bass fingerlings, seen during shoreline seining, indicate good natural reproduction.  The bluegill is the most abundant species in this lake.  High numbers of 5-6 inch bluegills were seen in trap nets.  Black crappies are not as abundant, but good numbers of 9-10 inch crappies were seen during the survey.  Other species in Lake Eleven include perch, bullhead, white sucker, golden shiner, and pumpkinseed sunfish.  None of these species were overly abundant.  Lake Eleven does have some large black bullheads; the average weight for this species was over a pound.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Eleven is a 290 acre lake in northern Kanabec county.  Despite being shallow, 13 foot maximum, and fertile the lake maintains good oxygen levels throughout the winter.  Lake Eleven's fishery is in great shape with good numbers of walleye, northerns, largemouth, and panfish.  Angling pressure can be high at times, especially in the winter and early summer seasons.  Anglers can expect quality sized walleye and bass which average 17.8 and 12.1 inches respectively.  The walleye population was dominated by the 1998 year class, a stocking year.  Northerns were not as large comparatively, but a strong 2000 year class and a rebounding perch populaiton should provide good angling opportunites.  The crappie population appears to be at an all time high with 45% of the trapnet catch exceeding 8 inches.  Bluegill have historically been high in abundance and on the small side.  Currently, the population has decreased to a level more typical of the lake class.  Subsequently, bluegill size has improved to a 7 inch and 0.3 pound average.  Fall shoreline seining found natural reproduction of perch, bass, crappie, and bluegill.  </p>",

The northern pike was high at 5.33 per set with an average weight of 2.27 pounds. The walleye was high at 6.67 and 1.75 per set in the gillnet and trapnet respectively. Average weight was 2.45 pounds. The black crappie at 56.75 and the bluegill sunfish at 64.00 per set had very high population figures. The pumpkinseed sunfish was high at 8.75 per set. The panfish population in general is made up of small size fish. The largemouth bass was slightly low at 0.25 per set. The yellow perch while at its lowest figure for all surveys (10.67 per set), is still not considered a problem concerning the forage base. The common sucker, black, brown and yellow bullhead all had low population figures.</p>",

Despite being shallow, 13 foot maximum, and fertile the lake maintains good oxygen levels throughout the winter.  Angling pressure can be high at times, especially in the winter and early summer seasons.  Anglers can expect quality sized northerns and bass, which average 23.3 and 14.1 inches respectively.  The walleye and perch abundances have slipped likely due to the expanding northern pike population.  The black crappie population was sampled at its highest rate in both the trap and gill nets.  Overall, crappies averaged 7.1 inches.  Sixty four percent of the crappie catch fell between 6 and 7.5 inches.  Bluegill have historically been high in abundance and on the small side.  The bluegill catch once again exceeded the lake class norm in 2008.  Size, however, remains acceptable with an average of 6.4 inches and a quarter pound.    </p>",

Despite being fertile and shallow (13- foot maximum), this lake maintains good oxygen levels throughout the summer and winter.  Angling pressure can be high at times, especially in the winter and early summer seasons.  Anglers can expect quality-size Northern Pike and Largemouth Bass, with pike exceeding 38 inches and bass exceeding 19 inches. The Walleye catch rate decreased slightly since the previous assessment in 2015; however, the Yellow Perch catch rate increased substantially.  Black Crappie and Bluegill catch rates were again higher than typical for the lake type.  Although harvestable sizes of Black Crappie and Bluegill are present, average lengths are 7.1 and 5.3 inches, respectively.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>  In July 1988 a Population Assessment took place on Lake Eleven.  Six gillnets and four trapnets were set to obtain data of the present fish population.  Shoreline seining efforts were conducted in August to evaluate natural reproduction in conjunction with the population assessment.\n  Based on respective local medians the present fish population is as follows:  The northern pike (6.83/set) net catch has remained almost the same as the 1983 survey (5.33/set).  There has been little fluctuation in the last four surveys since 1977 and all populations were slightly above the local median catch (3.88/set).  The 1988 length frequency distribution ranged from 14.0 to 29.9 inches with a median length group of 18.0 - 18.9 inches.  Mean weight was 1.75 pounds as compared to 2.27 pounds in 1983, when the median length was 20.0-20.9 inches.  Of the forty-four northern pike aged, age groups fell between the II and V year-classes with 61% of the sample at age III.  All age groups exhibited near normal growth rates in respect to statewide averages.\n  The walleye (6.33/set) population has remained quite stable in the past ten years of surveys.  It is still above the local median catch (3.52/set).  The length frequency distribution ranged from 12.0 to 23.9 inches with a median length group of 15.0 - 15.9 inches.  Mean weight was 1.80 pounds.  Fifty-six percent of the walleye taken were of age II, which indicates the reasoning of a median length group decrease from the 1983 survey, which was 19.0 - 19.9 inches.  Thirty-seven percent of the sample population were of ages VI through IX.  A four year stocking gap occurred from 1982 - 1985. During this time, some natural reproduction in low numbers evidently took place which could explain the presence of age groups IV and VI.  Past surveys also indicate the presence of year-classes due to natural reproduction.  Although there may be low recruitment from walleye in various years, it does not apparently maintain a population near the local median stability.  Hence, the effectiveness of a stocking rotation supplements to a reasonable population.\n  The yellow perch (3.83/set) shows a real decrease from the 1983 survey (10.67/set) and falls well below the local median catch (24.27/set).  This decline is similar to the surveys of 1977 and 1980, where net catches were 73.66/set and 15.50/set, respectively.  Hypothetically, this decline throughout the last decade may be directly related to the above local median numbers of the northern pike and walleye.  This may be a good example of forage selectivity by predators.  Although 1988 has the lowest net catch of all of the surveys from 1959, the shoreline seining efforts (50 YOY) were very comparable to the previous seining efforts of past surveys.\n  Nine largemouth bass (1.50/set) were taken by the gillnets ranging from age I to IV.  One was taken in the trapnets (0.25/set) which was 19.7 inches and of age X.  These catch indications along with shoreline seining efforts of 26 young-of-year verify that a sustaining population exists.\n  The bluegill sunfish (29.75/set) catch was slightly above the local median catch (25.67/set), yet substantially below the 1983 survey (64.00/set).  The length frequency ranged 3.0 to 8.4 inches with the median length group of 5.5-5.9 inches.  This median length group has increased from the 1983 survey (4.5 - 4.9 inches).  High numbers of bluegill sunfish young-of-year were obtained during the August shoreline seining efforts.\n  Black crappie (6.50/set) have declined significantly from the previous survey (56.75/set).  The median length group is (6.0 - 6.4 inches) with a high percentage being in the \"5 inch\" category. \n  Other species taken in test nets (golden shiner, white sucker, brown bullhead, and hybrid sunfish) do not appear to be substantially above or below the local median except for the pumpkinseed sunfish and black bullhead.  The pumpkinseed sunfish has historically been slightly above the local median catch and the reversal occurs for the black bullhead, where it has always been netted in low numbers.\n</p>",
