                "narrative": "<p>Horseshoe Lake is a 237-acre lake located in northeastern Aitkin County approximately 9 miles northeast of McGregor. The lake is shallow with a maximum depth of only 12 ft. and summer algal blooms are relatively common. The water is a tannin stained dark brown in color, limiting the secchi disk reading to only 1.5 ft. Most of the shoreline is ringed with wild rice. Shallow water areas are comprised primarily of sand, silt, and muck with occasional areas of gravel and rubble.  Horseshoe Lake does occasionally suffer from partial winterkills, the most recent known was a partial kill in the winter of 2007-2008, although partial kills have probably occurred in other years as well. Access can be gained either through the channel from Lake Minnewawa or through a private access on the northeast corner of the lake . The lake is part of the Quality Sunfish Initiative and has a 10 fish bag limit for sunfish. There is a special regulation for Walleye too where anglers can keep 3 Walleye with 1 over 20 inches. <br> \n <br> \nHistorically Walleye have been naturally occurring in Horseshoe Lake.  In order to improve an apparent declining natural population, Walleye fry were stocked into Horseshoe Lake, annually from 2012 - 2016 and are now stocked in alternating years concurrent with Lake Minnewawa. The 2022 catch of 2/gill net was identical to 2015 yet below the management goal of 3/net. It appeared there was more natural reproduction in this survey than years past, but some of those may have been stocked fish from Minnewawa that migrated into Horseshoe.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike numbers were up a bit, and their size was about average for this type of lake, although overall the size structure has dropped off over the last few surveys. There are still some decent pike to be caught though, fish ranged from 18.5 inches to 30.3 inches. Lower pike densities are generally favorable for Walleye management in this type of lake. <br> \n <br> \nPerhaps what is most notable is the lake's panfish population. Bluegill and Black Crappie populations are healthy, and both maintain decent size structures for the area. There has been improvements in Black Crappie and Bluegill sizes in recent years. Black crappie averaged over 8 inches, while Bluegills averaged about 7.5 inches. Yellow Perch numbers are in the normal range for this lake class but are probably too small to be of interest to anglers with no fish over 8 inches sampled in 2022. With an average length of 6.2 inches, the perch should provide good forage for the lake's Northern Pike and Walleye.   <br> \n <br> \nAlthough abundance is low, Largemouth Bass are present, and quality sized fish do exist. Only one was caught in this survey but it was nearly 16 inches and in previous surveys we have observed them to nearly 20 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nHorseshoe Lake maintains a healthy aquatic plant community with much of the shoreline rimmed with emergent and floating plants. Maintaining healthy plant communities is important for maintaining good water quality and fish habitat.   <br> \n</p>",

This survey was completed in addition to the standard survey conducted the week of August 24, 2015. Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake (10 stations) and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible. Species information was gathered as part of a statewide project to evaluate the fish Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) for Minnesota lakes.  <br> \n <br> \nBackpack electrofishing was completed at all 10 stations, but one site was sampled from the boat due to unstable footing. A 50-foot seine was not used, a 15-foot seine was used at 6 stations, and site conditions prevented the use of seines at 4 sites.  <br> \n <br> \n Horseshoe lake falls within lake class 39 based on the Schupp lake classification used by MnDNR and within Group 5 lakes for evaluating IBI data. IBI scores range from 0 to 100 and the impairment threshold for this group of lakes is 24 (90% CI 9-39) and the potential exceptional quality level is set at 61. The IBI score, using standard gill net and trap net data from the 2015 survey, calculated from this survey was 48.8, which is well above the impairment threshold, indicating good overall health in the fish community. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Horseshoe Lake is a 237 acre lake located in northeastern Aitkin County approximately 9 miles northeast of McGregor.  The lake is shallow with a maximum depth of only 12 ft. and summer algal blooms are relatively common.  The water is a tanin stained dark brown in color, limiting the secchi disk reading to only 3ft.  Most of the shoreline is ringed with wild rice.  Shallow water areas are comprised primarily of sand, silt, and muck with occasional areas of gravel and rubble.  Horseshoe Lake does occasionally suffer from partial winterkills, the most recent observed was a partial kill in the winter of 2007-2008.  Access can be gained either through the channel from Lake Minnewawa or through a private access on the northeast corner of the lake. <br> \n <br> \nHistorically walleye have been naturally occurring in Horseshoe Lake.  In order to improve an apparent declining natural population, walleye fry have been stocked into Horseshoe Lake, annually since 2012.  The 2015 catch of 2/gill net is up from past surveys.  All but one of the walleyes captured in the gill nets were from fry stocked years.  There is some fish movement between Horseshoe and Minnewawa.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike were caught in below average numbers, and their size was about average.  Fish ranged from 17\" to 24.6\", with an average length and weight of 21.3\" and 2.0 lbs.  Lower pike densities are generally favorable for walleye management in this type of lake. <br> \n <br> \nPerhaps what is most notable is the lake's panfish population.  Bluegill, black crappie, and yellow perch catches have decreased from the last survey.   With the decrease in abundance, there has been improvement in black crappie and bluegill sizes.  Black crappie averaged about 8\" while bluegills averaged about 7.5\".  Yellow perch numbers are still in the normal range for this lake class, but are probably too small to be of interest to anglers with only 2 fish over 8\" sampled in 2015.  With an average length of 6.2\", the perch should provide good forage for the lake's northern pike and walleye.   <br> \n <br> \nAlthough abundance was relatively low, the largemouth bass population did exhibit quality sized fish.  The 3 fish observed in the trap net sample ranged from 17\" to nearly 20\". <br> \n <br> \nA new survey tool was used in this survey to assess the quality of the shoreland, shoreline and aquatic areas called Score-the-Shore.  Overall Horseshoe Lake scored 69.8 out of a possible score of 100.  This score translates to a \"Poor\" rating, however it was only 0.2 points away from the \"Fair\" rating at 70.  Other lakes in the area with similar scores were Flemming (69) Waukenabo (71) and Dam (69).  Despite a poor Score-the-Shore rating, Horseshoe Lake maintains a healthy aquatic plant community with much of the shoreline rimmed with emergent and floating plants.  Maintaining healthy plant communities is important for maintaining good water quality and fish habitat.   <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Horseshoe Lake is a 237-acre lake located in east central Aitkin County.  The lake is shallow with a maximum depth of 12 feet and a mean depth of 7 feet.  The lake has a prominent algae bloom during the summer months.  The water is dark brown in color with a secchi disc reading of 3 feet.  Most of the shoreline is ringed with wild rice. Shoal water areas are primarily a mixture of sand silt and muck with some smaller areas of gravel and rubble. The surrounding land is a mixture of low, timber covered hills and marsh or bog.  Access can be gained either from Lake Minnewawa or through a private resort access on the northeast corner of the lake. Horseshoe Lake has a decent population of northern pike that are above average in size for this type of lake.  Shallow, dark water lakes like Horseshoe do not typically produce larger northern pike, however the pike sampled in this survey ranged from 18 to 28 inches in length with a mean length of 23 inches. The average weight of northern pike in 2004 was almost 3 pounds. For years Horseshoe Lake has been known for its panfish fishery.  Black crappie were sampled up to 12 inches in length with a mean length of 8 inches. The average size is slightly smaller than you would expect because of a strong 2002-year class of small fish.  However, this strong year class should contribute to a good black crappie fishery in a couple of years.  The same can be said for bluegill.  The 2001 and 2002 year classes of bluegill were strong, which will provide some good future angling opportunities. As in past surveys, only a few walleye were sampled.  Horseshoe Lake has limited walleye spawning habitat and poor survival of naturally produced walleye fry.  Most of the walleye found in Horseshoe Lake likely migrate into Horseshoe Lake from Lake Minnewawa.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Horseshoe Lake is a 237 acre lake located in northeastern Aitkin County approximately 9 miles northeast of McGregor.  The lake is shallow with a maximum depth of only 12 ft. and summer algal blooms are relatively common.  The water is dark brown in color, limiting the secchi disk reading to only 2.5 ft.  Most of the shoreline is ringed with wild rice.  Shallow water areas are comprised primarily of sand, silt, and muck with occasional areas of gravel and rubble.  Horseshoe Lake does occasionally suffer from winterkills, the most recent observed was a partial kill in the winter of 2007-2008.  Access can be gained either from Lake Minnewawa or through a private access on the northeast corner of the lake. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike were caught in below average numbers, but their size was above average.  Fish ranged from 14\" to 29\" with an average length and weight of 22\" and 2.7 lbs.  Perhaps what is most notable is the lake's panfish population.  Bluegill, black crappie, and yellow perch catches have all been increasing in recent years.  Along with the increase in abundance there has been a decrease in growth rates.  Even though growth was slow for bluegills, the average length was 6\" with 17% measuring at least 7\" long.  Black crappie abundance was also very high due to two very successful year classes in 2006 and 2008.  This high abundance is likely responsible for the slow growth of these fish, which had only 9% measuring at least 8\" in this assessment.  The winterkill observed in 2007-2008 was likely very minor since the 2005 and 2006 year classes were still so abundant. Yellow perch are probably too small to be of interest to anglers with only 1 fish over 8\" sampled in 2009; however, with an average length of 6\", they should provide good forage for the lake's northern pike and occasional walleye.  Walleye are not stocked, but are present in low numbers with most fish likely migrating into Horseshoe Lake from Lake Minnewawa.  Although abundance was relatively low, the largemouth bass population did exhibit an excellent size distribution. The seven fish observed in the trap net sample ranged in length from 14.7 to 20.0 inches. <br> \n</p>",

Large bluegills and black crappies were again caught in the    1994 lake survey. The bluegills ranged up to 8.7 inches and a large portion (57%) of the fish    were over 6.0 inches. Bluegill abundance was normal for lakes of this type. Black crappies ranged    up to 11.8 inches. Walleyes abundance was normal for lakes of this type. Walleyes in Horseshoe    Lake are naturally reproduced, either within the lake or inlet, or in Lake Minnewawa which is    downstream. The walleyes ranged from 10.4 to 26.1 inches long. Northern pike abundance was low    for lakes of this type. The pike ranged from 18.5 to 30.4 inches long in the gill nets and    averaged 21.6 inches long, which is decent. Yellow perch abundance was normal for lakes of this    type, however the perch were all small. Growth of larger northerns may be limited by the lack    of larger perch to feed on. Bullheads were large and not abundant. Yellow bullheads decreased and    brown bullheads increased slightly from 1989 to 1994. Twenty-one hundred pounds of bullheads were    removed in 1994. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Horseshoe Lake is a shallow, u-shaped lake that is connected to Lake Minnewawa by a 3,000 foot channel.  Access may be gained from the public access on Lake Minnewawa or through a private access on the northeast side of the lake for a small fee.  The lake is shallow, reaching its deepest point at 12 feet, and has wild rice along most of the shoreline.  The wild rice draws waterfowl in the fall and, in turn, hunters.  Despite the shallow depth and an occasionally heavy algae bloom, there is no record of a winterkill on Horseshoe Lake.  The lake may experience low dissolved oxygen levels during severe winters and may be susceptible to winterkill if there is additional nutrient loading from surrounding property within the watershed.  The fish community in Horseshoe Lake is known for producing quality panfish.  The 1999 assessment again showed decent numbers of large bluegills and black crappies.  Bluegills ranged in size up to 10 inches, but over 76 percent of the fish were two-year-olds at an average size of 3.2 inches.  This large year-class of bluegill may provide some good angling opportunities as they grow to more desirable sizes in the near future.  Black crappies were caught ranging in size from 4 to 11 inches.  The average size has decreased to 5.9 inches, however this is mainly due to the 1998 year-class, which makes up 60 percent of the fish sampled.  Similar to bluegill, this year-class should grow to desirable size within the next few years.  The abundance of bluegill was normal for this type of lake and the abundance of black crappies was just above the normal range.  Northern pike and walleye are other members of the fish community in Horseshoe Lake that are sought by anglers.  The average length for northern pike from the 1999 assessment was 18.9 inches, which is somewhat small.  Abundance of northern pike has more than doubled compared to figures from previous surveys, and is now around the state median for this type of lake.  As for walleye, only four were caught in the 1999 sampling, which is a decrease from the 23 fish caught in the 1994 survey.  There is very little suitable walleye spawning habitat within Horseshoe Lake and it is likely that most of the walleye reproduction occurs in the inlet creek and or downstream in Lake Minnewawa.  A 1987 improvement to the walleye spawning habitat near the inlet appears to be not well utilized and is partially silted in.  Past walleye fingerling stocking efforts have not succeeded in increasing the abundance index in Horseshoe Lake.  The abundance of yellow perch, an important forage species for walleye and northern pike has dropped to a below normal level relative to other lakes of this type.  Growth for walleye and northern pike may be limited by the lack of yellow perch to feed on.  Average sizes for the bullhead species remained large, while abundances were low.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of nearshore fish species in Horseshoe Lake was conducted on August 9, 2022, by Aitkin Area Fisheries Staff. Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake, and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at all ten sampling stations, but two stations were sampled from the boat due to site conditions. Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample four stations, a 15-foot seine was used at two stations and site conditions prevented the use of seines at four stations. Nearshore sampling captured 11 species of fish. <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore data were combined with trap net and gill net data from an August 2022 survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based Index of Biotic Integrity (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment. In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g., Rock Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g., Black Bullhead). The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.  <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Mississippi River-Grand Rapids Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency. <br> \n</p>",
