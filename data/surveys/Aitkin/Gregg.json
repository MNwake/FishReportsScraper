                "narrative": "<p>Gregg Lake is a small 31-acre lake in Aitkin County.  The lake is shallow with the deepest point reaching a depth of 18 feet.  There is no public access and development is limited to one residence on the south side of the lake.  Abundant wild rice around the edges of the lake makes for good duck viewing opportunities.  Over the time period that the lake has been surveyed, the most numerous species has been the black bullhead, which has been taken in very high numbers compared to other lakes of this type in the state.  The northern pike population appears to be in good health.  The abundance is at a level typical for this type of lake, while the size structure should make for exciting angling.  The average size of northern pike was 20.9 inches and the largest fish caught in the 1999 assessment was almost 32 inches.  The forage base of yellow perch is at sufficient abundance to support normal growth of northern pike during the first few years, but may be somewhat limiting in later life.  An attempt to establish largemouth bass and bluegill populations through a private stocking effort in 1986 appears to have been unsuccessful.  In order to maintain a desirable northern pike fishery in such a small lake, it will be important to continue to release large northern pike.</p>",
