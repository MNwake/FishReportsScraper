Gillnet catches have ranged from 8.6 - 12.0fish/net in previous surveys dating back to 1979.  The lowest catch rate of 8.6 fish/net was recordedin 1988.  Size structure of the northern pike population is poor.  Mean weight of fish captured was 1.0pounds.    Age-1 and age-2 fish comprised 89% of the fish captured in gillnets.  These fish areexperiencing rapid growth.  Recent walleye fry stockings have produced a viable walleye population inGrant Lake.  Gillnet catches averaged 11.5 fish/net which exceeds the normal range of 1.2 - 6.3fish/net.  Walleye ranged from 15 to 20 inches in total length.   Mean weight of fish captured was 1.2pounds.  Age-3 and age-5 fish (1989 and 1991 year classes) comprised the entire catch of walleyes ingillnets.   These two year classes correspond to the only two years in which walleye fry were stockedinto Grant Lake.  Daytime, DC electrofishing yielded 7.2 stock-sized largemouth bass per hour.  Meanweight of fish captured was 1.6 pounds.  There is no historic electrofishing data to compare with the1994 survey results.  There were 12 largemouth bass captured in the trapnets.  These fish ranged from4.0 to 9.5 inches in total length.  The bluegill population is characterized by a limited number oflarge, fast growing individuals.  Trapnet catches averaged 5.8 fish/net in 1994.  Catches have rangedfrom 2.2 - 6.4 fish/trapnet in previous surveys dating back to 1979.  The normal range of mean catchrates from similar lakes is 7.5 - 62.5 fish/net.  Mean weight of fish captured was 0.3 pounds.  Age-3and age-4 fish comprised 86% of the fish captured in trapnets.  Black crappie catches averaged 1.7fish/trapnet.  Trapnet catch rates in previous surveys have ranged from 3.7 to 11.3 fish/net.  Thenormal range of mean catch rates for this lake type is 1.8 - 21.2 fish/trapnet.  Age-1 fish comprised75% of the fish captured in trapnets.  Mean weight of fish captured was 0.2 pounds.  Yellow perchabundance may have increased significantly since 1988.  Gillnet catch rate increased from 0.0 fish/netin 1988 to 16.0 fish/net in 1994.  Catches have never exceeded 1.0 fish/net in surveys dating back to1979.  Mean weight of fish captured in 1994 was 0.2 pounds.   </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Grants Lake is a 171-acre lightly developed basin located about nine miles southwest of Alexandria near the town of Holmes City.  Water quality and clarity have improved over the past decade and are considered good at this time.  Aquatic vegetation has increased with the improvement in water clarity, especially along the north and northwest shorelines.  Aquatic plants provide spawning habitat and cover for many fish species and help to maintain water clarity by competing with nuisance algae for the available nutrients in the water.  Much of the steeply sloped shoreline is undeveloped at this time.  Residential development along this steeply sloped shoreline has the potential to increase polluted run-off and degrade water quality.  Lakeshore homeowners need to minimize the disturbance of soils and vegetation on these slopes and leave a buffer of native vegetation along the shoreline when developing new lakeshore lots.Fishing pressure on Grants Lake is relatively light, however the lake supports a desirable fish community that can provide good angling opportunities.  Walleye are relatively abundant.  Gill net catches averaged 7.1 fish/net in 2004, which exceeds the normal range of catch rates from lakes with similar physical and chemical characteristics.  Most of the walleye captured in 2004 were between 15 and 20 inches in length.  These were three- year-old fish that correspond to a fry stocking in 2001.  Walleye fry have been stocked in one of every three years since 1989.  Largemouth bass and northern pike are also abundant.  Approximately 60% of the largemouth bass captured in 2004 were 12 inches in length or greater and 30% exceeded 15 inches.  Average size of northern pike tends to be small. Most of the fish captured were 16 to 21 inches in length.  Bluegill and black crappie numbers were limited in 2004.  These species experience fast growth rates in Grants Lake, thus average size is relatively large.       </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Grants Lake is a 171-acre basin located nine miles southwest of Alexandria. The village of Holmes City is located along the north shore. Water quality and clarity are considered good. Much of the shoreline around Grants Lake is steeply sloped.  Runoff and erosion of slopes has potential to increase pollutant loading and degrade water quality. All lakeshore homeowners need to minimize disturbances of soils and vegetation on these slopes and leave a buffer of native vegetation along the shoreline. A public access is located on the west side of the lake. Fishing pressure on Grants Lake is relatively light. The lake supports a diverse gamefish community that can provide good angling opportunities.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye fry have been stocked every third year since 1989 to sustain a fishery. Walleye are relatively abundant. Gillnet catches averaged 6.7 fish/net. This exceeds normal catch rates from lakes with similar physical and chemical characteristics. Most of the walleye captured in 2009 were between 14.0 and 20.0 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike are moderately abundant. Gillnet catches averaged 5.3 fish/net. Mean weight was small with fish averaging 1.9 lbs. <br> \n <br> \nElectrofishing efforts yielded 13.7 largemouth bass/hour. Mean length was 9.8 inches. One smallmouth bass was captured in gillnets.  Bluegill are moderately abundant.  Trapnet catch rates averaged 14.9 fish/trap net.  Most bluegill captures were young fish less than 5.0 inches in length. Mean weight of captured bluegill was 0.1 lbs. Black crappie trapnet catches averaged 4.8 fish/trap net. This exceeds the normal catch for this lake type.  Black crappie lengths ranged from 3.5 to 10.0 inches. Similar to bluegill catches, nearly 80% of crappie catch was comprised of one- and two-year-old fish.  Fishing quality will improve with added growth. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled were black, brown and yellow bullhead, yellow perch, hybrid sunfish, pumpkinseed, white sucker, common carp and bowfin.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Grants Lake is a moderately productive, 177-acre basin located south of Holmes City.  A concrete public access is found on the northwest shoreline, off Country Lane SW.  Average depth is 25.0 feet.  Maximum depth is 60.0 feet.  Water clarity is high (8.0 feet).  Despite good water clarity, aquatic vegetation is not overly abundant due to predominantly sand substrates and steeply sloped shorelines.  \n\nA standard fisheries survey was completed during summer 2020 to provide updated information on the fish community of Grants Lake.  Standard survey components typically include spring electrofishing, gill nets, and trap nets.  However, due to safety concerns during the COVID-19 pandemic, gill nets were the only component used in 2020.   \n\nGrants Lake has supported an above-average Walleye population for several decades.  Currently, catch rates (1.8/gill net) have dipped below historical levels, but still approximate the average of similar lakes in Minnesota.  Individuals averaged 16.5 inches with the majority between 15.0 and 20.0 inches.  The oldest Walleye was twelve-years-old.  A young 2019 year class was present and this year class will likely provide good fishing opportunities in the next several years.  Walleye fry are stocked every third year to maintain the population.  \n\nInitially documented in 2009, Smallmouth Bass are believed to have been illegally introduced into Grants Lake.  Following introduction, catch rates have increased (7.0/gill net) and a high proportion of the individuals collected were young.  Maximum length of Smallmouth Bass was 17.8 inches.  Largemouth Bass are also relatively common.  Twelve individuals, ranging from 13.3 to 17.4 inches in length, were sampled with gill nets.  \n\nNorthern Pike catch rates (4.7/gill net) approximate the average of previous surveys.  Most pike were smaller individuals.  The largest pike measured was 32.7 inches.  Anglers are encouraged to take advantage of recently liberalized pike harvest regulations.  Grants Lake falls in the North-central Zone where all pike 22-26 inches must be immediately released.  Anglers can keep up to 10 pike but no more than two can be longer than 26 inches.  Harvesting smaller pike will help improve size structure of this population.  \n\nEight Black Crappies were sampled with gill nets.  Mean and maximum lengths were 10.5 and 12.0 inches, respectively.  Bluegill and Yellow Perch are also present in Grants Lake, but none were collected with gill nets in 2020.  \n\nOther species recorded in 2020 included Common Carp, White Sucker, Black and Yellow Bullhead.  The next standard fisheries survey is tentatively scheduled for 2026.  \n\nGrants Lake has been designated as an infested waterbody due to the presence of zebra mussels and flowering rush.  These aquatic invasive species were first confirmed in 2019.  Anglers are reminded to drain boats and equipment and remove aquatic vegetation prior to moving between bodies of water to minimize the risk of transferring aquatic invasive species.\n\n</p>",

Walleye may have accesses Grant Lake from Mill Lake during high water in 1986. Northern Pike gillnet CPUE values have decreased from 20.80/net in 1984 to 8.60/net in 1988; however, mean size has remained small. Small average size of Northern Pike may be due to lack of appropriate size prey fish. No Yellow Perch were sampled; however, large schools of small Yellow Perch were seen in shallows. Bluegill were small even though trapnet CPUE values were very low, which may indicate overexploitation of the limited fishery. Lack of vegetation, limited littoral area, and poor reproductive success may limit recruitment. Black Crappie CPUE was above the state median. Black Crappie are more of a pelagic species and may be more successful than Bluegill in maintaining a fishable population in Grants Lake. Although not adequately sampled, largemouth bass should provide fishing opportunity Black, Brown and Yellow Bullhead, Carp, White Sucker and Bowfin are present, but relative abundance continues to be low.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Grants Lake is a 171-acre lake located near Holmes City.  The public access has concrete planks, but they get covered with sand which can make launching large boats with a two-wheel-drive vehicle difficult.  Water quality and clarity have improved over the past decade and are considered good at this time.  Submergent vegetation has increased with the improvement in water clarity, especially along the north and northwest shorelines.  This aquatic vegetation provides spawning and nursery habitat for many gamefish and also maintains good water quality by competing with algae for excess nutrients in the water.  Much of the steeply sloped shoreline is undeveloped at this time.  Future residentialdevelopment along these fragile slopes has the potential to increase polluted run-off and degrade water quality.  New lakeshore homeowners need to minimize the disturbance of native vegetation and leave a buffer zone along the shoreline when developing these lakeshore lots.  Fishing pressure on Grants lake is relatively light.  However, the lake supports a desirable fish community and can provide good angling opportunities.  Walleye are relatively abundant.  Gill net catches averaged 9.7 fish per net which exceeds the expected range of catch rates for this type of lake.  Anglers have had good success by targeting the hump out from the public access in the winter and the point to the south of the access during open water.  Anglers should continue to have good results in future years.  Two strong year classes were present in 1999.  These year classes correspond to fry stockings in 1995 and 1998. Northern pike, largemouth bass, black crappie, and bluegill are also present in good numbers and fishing can be very good.  These species can be caught  in the shallow bay in the northwest corner of the lake and along the weedline on the northern part of the lake.  Shore angling can also be productive near the outlet culvert in Holmes City.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Grants Lake is a 171-acre lake located nine miles southwest of Alexandria. This small, dimictic basin has a maximum depth of 60.0 feet and an estimated average depth of 25.0 feet.  Fisheries productivity is limited by basin morphology and fertility.  Only 36% of the lake area is less than 15.0 feet in depth.  The lake was thermally stratified during the August survey.  A thermocline was detected below 15.0 feet.  Dissolved oxygen concentrations below 21.0 feet were too low to sustain fish life.  Water quality is considered good with an average summer Secchi transparency measurement in excess of 10.0 feet.  Despite good water transparency, Grants Lake does not support a robust aquatic plant community.  Most submergent plants occur along the north end of the lake near Holmes City and along Douglas County Highway 4. <br> \n <br> \nMuch of the shoreline around Grants Lake is steeply sloped.  Residential development is moderate, with most homes located on the west side of the lake.  A public access is located on the northwest side of the lake.  Fishing pressure on Grants Lake is relatively light. <br> \n  <br> \nGrants Lake supports a diverse gamefish community that can provide good angling opportunities and quiet, quality fishing experiences.  A new addition to the fish community was noted during the 2014 survey, Smallmouth Bass.  This species was not captured during preceding surveys and was not introduced by the Department of Natural Resources.  A total of 55 fish were captured during the 2014 fish community assessment.  Size of captures ranged from 5.5 to 16.9 inches suggesting smallmouth bass are reproducing.  Due to the limited productivity and carrying capacity of this lake, addition and expansion of an additional predator species may result in undesired ecological impacts to other gamefish populations. <br> \n   <br> \nA fair Walleye fishery is sustained through fry stockings.  Fry are stocked on a three-year frequency.  Gillnet catches averaged 6.8 fish/gillnet. This catch rate exceeded expectations for Grants and similar lakes.  Size of captures ranged from 9.3 to 21.7 inches in length and averaged 13.1 inches.  Most of the walleye catch was comprised of yearling fish stemming from the 2013 fry stocking.  At sustained growth rates, these fish should exceed 14.0 inches in length in late-summer of 2015. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike relative abundance estimates have steadily decreased from a high of 9.0 fish/gillnet in 1999 to a low of 3.2 fish/gillnet in 2014.  Most of the pike sampled were less than 20.0-inches in length, but two 30.0-inch pike were measured. <br> \n   <br> \nLargemouth Bass and Bluegill densities are low due to scarceness of aquatic vegetation.  Only seventeen Largemouth Bass were captured by all gear types combined in 2014.  The electrofishing catch rate was very low at 6.2 fish/hour.  Electrofishing captures ranged from 12.9 to 16.3 inches in length.  Largemouth Bass grow slow.  Those 16.0 inch captures were at least nine years old.  Bluegill catches averaged only 5.0 fish/trapnet.  Size at capture ranged from 3.1 to 8.5 inches.  Most captures proved to be young fish, age-3 or less, thus average size of bluegill caught in trapnets was 5.4 inches.  Other members of the sunfish family captured during the 2014 survey included Pumpkinseed and sunfish hybrids. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie are more tolerant of limited vegetative coverage than other resident sunfishes.  Grants Lake supports a moderately abundant crappie population.  Survey catches were comprised of cohorts of seven age groups.  Size of captures ranged from 3.9 to 12.1 inches in length.  A comparatively strong year class was produced in 2010.  These fish will exceed 10.0 inches in length in 2015. <br> \n   <br> \nFair fishing opportunities exist for less popular and under-exploited fishes.  Yellow Bullheads are common.  Gillnet catches in 2014 averaged nearly 2.0 pounds/fish.  Black Bullheads numbers have increased.  Most are young fish.  They averaged 0.5 pounds.  Other non-game fish present include Common Carp, Bowfin and White Sucker.   <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A trap net survey was conducted on Grants Lake on July 12-13, 2022 by Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program Staff. Nine trap nets were set along the shoreline in locations that encompassed multiple habitat types. Bluegill comprised a majority of the trap net catch by number. The number of Bluegill sampled per net was above the 25% quartile and below the 50% quartile for similar Lake Class 31 lakes and the average length was 5.5 inches, with 22% over seven inches. Bluegill, Hybrid Sunfish, Bowfin, and Northern Pike comprised a majority of the trap net catch by biomass.   <br> \n <br> \nThe fish data collected in this trap net survey were combined with data from an August 2020 gill net survey and July 2020 survey of nearshore fishes to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based IBI (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment. In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g. Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, and Smallmouth Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g. Black Bullhead and Common Carp). The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.   <br> \n <br> \nResults from this survey provide evidence that the fish community in Grants Lake is in good health as indicated by an FIBI score above the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes. Data from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Long Prairie River Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency. <br> \n</p>",

The 1982 Bluegill stocking may have contributed to the 6.0-7.0 inch size group. Black Crappies have increased in size since the last survey and have a good size distribution. Northern Pike numbers are extremely high and they are small. However, the size has improved since the 1979 survey when a 1.25 lb. Average was found. Yellow Perch numbers are very low, probably due to the high Northern Pike population. The Largemouth Bass population. Although poorly sampled, appears to be strong. Black Bullheads continued to be above state and local medians.</p>",

Backpack electrofishing and/or seining were conducted at 10 stations, representing a variety of habitat types, along the shoreline of Grants Lake.  The survey was conducted during the five-year sampling window for intensive monitoring efforts within the Long Prairie River watershed, and will be contributing to a watershed assessment process in coordination with Minnesota Pollution Control Agency. <br> \n <br> \nSeventeen species were collected during this survey.  Four species (Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, Mimic Shiner, and Smallmouth Bass) were considered \"intolerant\" and one species (Green Sunfish) was considered \"tolerant\" based on current tolerance classifications for Minnesota lakes.  <br> \n <br> \nNearshore catch data will be used along with gill and trap net catch data to develop an Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) score, which is indicative of the health of Grants Lake.</p>",
