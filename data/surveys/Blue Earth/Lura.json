A fishery population assessment was conducted on Lura Lake in late August 2002.  Walleye are abundant in Lura Lake.  In the 2002 assessment, walleye ranged from 12 to 25 inches with many fish around 12 and 20 inches in length.  While not reflected in the netting, excellent largemouth bass fishing opportunities exist.  Yellow perch have been very abundant in Lura Lake, but the results of the 2002 netting indicate yellow perch number may have declined.  Yellow perch up to 10 inches were sampled.  Northern pike, bluegill, and black crappie offer additional angling opportunities.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lura Lake in Blue Earth County is a 1,359 acre lake south of Mapleton.  It has an average depth of 5.0 feet and a maximum depth of 9.0 feet.  A DNR-owned public access is located in the easternmost basin, a second access is located in Daly County Park, and a third public access operated by the Lura Lake Sportsman's Club is located on the south side of the lake.  Eurasian watermilfoil was found in the lake in 2004.  Boaters should be sure to remove all aquatic vegetation from boats, trailers, and equipment and drain all water when leaving Lura Lake to prevent the spread of Eurasian watermilfoil to other lakes.  Lura Lake was surveyed the week of August 26, 2013 to monitor the fish community.  Two standard gill nets and eight standard double frame lake survey trap nets were set.  Lura Lake was reclaimed using a fish toxicant in 1994 to reduce abundances of undesirable species.  Fish stocking following the reclamation resulted in a fish community dominated by game fish, particularly walleye, providing good angling opportunities for several years.  From 2002 to 2008, however, the fish community appeared to be reverting back to a population dominated by black bullhead.  Contrary to this trend, the 2013 black bullhead catch rates were near record lows and comparable to post-reclamation abundances.  This marked decrease in black bullhead catch was accompanied by a great increase in yellow perch abundance with the second largest gill net catch rate of yellow perch observed in this system.  Accordingly, yellow perch were the most abundant fish in the assessment in both trap- and gill-net catches.  Yellow perch averaged 146.0 fish per gill net, which greatly exceeded the normal range when compared to similar lakes in Minnesota.  Average total length of yellow perch captured in gill nets was nearly 8.0 inches, which was considered an acceptable size to most anglers.   <br> \n <br> \nWalleye gill net catches were 5.8 fish/gill net, a modest increase from 3.5 fish/gill net in 2008.  Walleye from gill nets ranged from 16.0 to 27.0 inches, with an average total length of 20.1 inches.  The lengths of walleye in Lura Lake during 2013 included a high proportion of \"preferred\" length fish by anglers, which is walleye over 20.0 inches in total length.  Lura Lake walleye were generally of large size and condition; likely due to high abundances of a yellow perch forage base.  Walleye fry (1.2 million) were stocked 3 out of 4 years to sustain the population.  Age estimation indicated a population with sufficient stocking-based recruitment, with the 2013 walleye population comprised of 6 year-classes with individual ages ranging from 1 to 14 years.   <br> \n <br> \nThe Lura Lake northern pike populations should provide good angling opportunities because gill net catches in 2013 marked an all-time high.  Catch rates in 2008 were considered lower than average when compared to similar Minnesota lakes at 1.5 fish/gill net; however in 2013 gillnet catches were 10.5 fish/ gill net, which was above average.  Mean weight of northern pike was 2.7 pounds in gill nets and 4.2 pounds in trap nets.   <br> \n\t <br> \nLargemouth bass were sampled in mid-May using electrofishing.  Largemouth bass typically are not effectively sampled with trap and gill nets, thus electrofishing is the most reliable way to estimate abundance.  A total of 34 largemouth bass were captured per hour of on time.  Total lengths of largemouth bass captured using electrofishing ranged from 3.5 to 20.0 inches with an average total length about 17.0 inches.   A total of five year classes were found in Lura Lake during 2013 electrofishing with individual ages ranging from 1 to 7 years.  Lura Lake is known for having a population of older, larger individuals and has been the host site for bass angling tournaments during recent years.   <br> \n <br> \nBluegill catches dropped from 29.9 fish/trap net in 2008 to 11 fish/trap net in 2013; however, current abundances are still above average for lakes of this type.  Black crappie catch rates in trap nets (14.4 fish/trap net) were the highest observed since 1994, while the number caught per gill net (2.5 fish/trap net) was a modest decrease since the last assessment in 2008.  Mean total length of black crappie was 7.6 inches.  Common carp abundances decreased in both trap- and gill-nets since 2008.  Catch rates were 0.5 fish/gill net (below average compared to similar Minnesota lakes) and 2.5 fish/trap net (slightly above average for a lake of this type).   <br> \n <br> \nLake reclamations using a fish toxicant are thought to keep undesirable fish species at manageable levels for around 15 years.  The 2008 assessment was nearly 15 years after the 1994 reclamation and showed carp and bullhead levels near pre-reclamation numbers.  At that time, reclamation options were again being considered.  However, the 2013 assessment showed numbers of black bullhead and common carp back down to near post-reclamation levels.  The 2013 survey highlighted a fishery with good opportunities for largemouth bass, northern pike, black crappie, yellow perch, and walleye angling.  Anglers can help maintain or improve the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest allows for the taking of smaller fish for table fare, but encourages release of medium to large-sized fish.  Releasing these fish can help maintain balance in the fish community in Lura Lake and provide anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future.   <br> \n <br> \nWater quality and shoreline erosion continue to be two large issues within Lura Lake.  Watershed practices, layout, and water level and runoff management have long dictated water quality on Lura Lake, so it will take time and land use changes to see improvements in these conditions.  Shoreline areas on the land and into the shallow water provide essential habitat for fish and wildlife that live in or near Minnesota's lakes.  Overdeveloped shorelines cannot support the fish, wildlife, and clean water that are associated with natural, undeveloped lakes.  Shoreline habitat consists of aquatic plants, woody plants and natural lake bottom soils.  Plants in the water and at the water's edge provide habitat, prevent erosion and absorb excess nutrients.  Shrubs, trees, and woody debris such as fallen trees or limbs provide good habitat both above and below the water and should be left in place.  By leaving a buffer strip of natural vegetation along the shoreline, property owners can reduce erosion, help maintain water quality, and provide habitat and travel corridors for wildlife. <br> \n <br> \n-Prepared by:  Matt Mork, Fisheries Specialist.</p>",

THE INCREASED WALLEYE NET CATCH MAY BE THE RESULT OF THE '86 STOCKING OF LARGE '84 YEAR CLASS FISH FROM HANSKA LAKE. AGE-GROWTH ANALYSIS TENDS TO SUPPORT THIS WITH A STRONG '84 YEAR CLASS NOW PRESENT COMPARED TO ONLY A FEW '84 YEAR CLASS WALLEYE SAMPLED IN '86. WALLEYE SAMPLED ARE WELL DISTRIBUTED WITH SEVEN AGES SAMPLED WITH GOOD NUMBERS OF OLDER AGE 7 AND AGE 8 INDIVIDUALS STILL PRESENT. THE INCREA- SED WALLEYE NET CATCH IS A POSITIVE CHANGE FROM THE STEADY DECLINE EXPERIENCED IN RECENT YEARS. PERHASP STOCKING LARGE WALLEYE WHEN AVAILABLE IS NECESSARY TO MAINTAIN A GOOD WALLEYE POPULATION PERCH NET CATCHES HAVE INCREASED FROM 3.33/GILLNET IN '86 TO 39.83/GILL NET IN '87. PERCH NETTED WERE REPRESENTED BY AGES 1 - 5, WITH AGES 1 AND 2 SHOWING THE MOST STRENGTH. BLACK CRAPPIE NET CATCHES CONTINUE TO DECLINE FROM 6.00/TRAP NET IN '86 TO 1.62/TRAPNET IN '87. BLACK CRAPPIE SEEM TO HAVE POOR REPRODUCTIVE OR RECRUITMENT SUCCESS. CRAPPIES OF AGES 4-8 DOMINATE THE POPULATION WITH ONLY TWO YOUNGER FISH NETTED. WHITE CRAPPIE CATCHES DECLINED FROM 3.67/GILLNET IN '86 TO 1.00/GILLNET IN '87. THE PRESENT WHITE CRAPPIE CATCH WAS DOMINATED BY AGE 4 FISH AND FEWER AGE 2 AND 3 FISH CAPTURED. BLACK BULLHEADS ARE ABUNDANT AND SEEM TO BE REPRESENTED BY ONE STRONG YEAR CLASS. BULLHEADS AVERAGED 182.33/GILL NET IN '87 COMPARED TO 287.00/GILL NET IN '86. GROWTH HAS BEEN SLOW AND RELATIVE ABUNDANCE IS HIGH IN THIS POPULATION, WITH LITTLE CHANGE TAKING PLACE FROM PREVIOUS YEARS. LARGEMOUTH BASS WERE NOT SAMPLED IN NET CATCHES, BUT REPORTS FROM ANGLERS INDICATE A FAIR POPULATION OF LARGE FISH PRESENT.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lura Lake is a 1,358-acre lake located approximately 4 miles southwest of the town of Mapleton in Blue Earth County. It has a maximum depth of 9 feet. The Minnesota Pollution Control Agency describes the overall condition of the lake as, \"Not always suitable for swimming and wading due to low clarity or excessive algae caused by the presence of nutrients such as phosphorus in the water.\" The watershed is dominated by agriculture and has negatively affected the lake. For many years the lake has been aerated and no winterkills have been reported since a lake wide reclamation in 1994. Invasive Eurasian Watermilfoil and Curly Leaf Pondweed are abundant and a nuisance to boating and fishing at certain times of the year. There are 4 public accesses on the lake; two in Daly Park, one on the west side of the north basin, and one on the west side of the south basin. The lake is primarily managed for Northern Pike and Walleye and secondarily for Black Crappie, Bluegill, Largemouth Bass, and Yellow Perch. From 2016 to 2018, approximately 1,224,000 Walleye fry were stocked annually. In 2019, the stocking rate was decreased to 500 fry/littoral acre (n = 612,000). Lura Lake is designated as a Tier-1 lake and will be surveyed as part of a regular monitoring program at a frequency of every 3 years.  <br> \n <br> \nA targeted survey completed the week of August 22, 2020 using 8 gill nets. Trap nets and spring boat electrofishing targeting Largemouth Bass were not completed as planned due to COVID-19 restrictions. Water quality parameters were also recorded. Results from this survey are comparable to historical standard surveys since standardized methods were used. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappies were abundant in 2020 with a total of 460 sampled for a catch rate of 57.5/net, indicating high numbers were present. Since 1994, catch rates have varied from 0.0/net to 57.5/net with an average of 8.8/net. A rarity in surveys prior to 2002, Black Crappies have become common in Lura Lake. Black Crappie lengths ranged from 5.0 to 14.7 inches with an average of 6.2 inches. The majority of the sample was between 5.0 and 7.0 inches but a cluster of fish from 9.5 to 15.0 inches were also measured. Most of the fish were young with an overwhelming majority only1 year old. Growth was fast with 10 inches exceeded around 3 years old. Black Crappies have become an important part of the Lura Lake fish community in a time when winterkill no longer occurs regularly. <br> \n <br> \nOnly two Bluegills were captured with the gill nets in 2020. Typically, Bluegills are better sampled with trap nets. <br> \n <br> \nJust 4 Largemouth Bass ranging from 4.2 to 18.7 inches were sampled with the gill nets in 2020. Spring boat electrofishing is the preferred gear for sampling Largemouth Bass and was not completed as planned due to COVID-19 restrictions. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike were sampled at historically high numbers in 2020. A total of 266 were caught in the gill nets for a catch rate of 33.3/net, which is approximately 3 times higher than the previous high catch rate from 1994 to 2017. Northern Pike numbers have surged in recent years after being sampled at low levels prior to 2013. Northern Pike lengths in 2020 ranged from 16.2 to 38.5 with an average of 21.1 inches. Approximately 11% exceeded the legal minimum length limit of 24 inches. Ages ranged from 1 to 7 years old with 7 year classes present. Approximately 70% of the fish were 1 year old. Growth was fast with the 24 inch minimum length surpassed by their third year. The fast growing and highly abundant 2019 year class should provide excellent Northern Pike angling in coming years. Lura Lake is located in the Southern Northern Pike management zone. In order to harvest a Northern Pike the fish must be over 24.0 inches in length.  The daily bag limit in this zone is 2 Northern Pike per day. <br> \nA total of 24 Walleyes were sampled in 2020 for a catch rate of 3.0/net, indicating moderate numbers were present. Walleyes were extremely abundant in surveys completed from 1994 to 2002 but have declined sharply since then. Walleye lengths ranged from 15.4 to 27.5 inches with an average of 23.3 inches. Approximately 88% of the sample exceeded 20 inches in length. Walleye were 1 to 11 years old with 7 year classes present. Approximately 46% of Walleyes were 6 years old and a product of the 2014 fry stocking. Walleye growth was fast with 15 inches exceeded by 2 years old and 20 inches exceeded around their 3 year. Walleye fry stocking has become less and less effective in Lura Lake. Without winterkills or reclamations, it is unreasonable to expect Walleye numbers to return to the high levels enjoyed in the 1990's and early 2000's. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch were sampled in modest numbers in 2020. A total of 71 were sampled for a catch rate of 8.9/net, indicating low to moderate numbers were present. Numbers have fluctuated wildly from 1994 to 2020 with a range of 1.0/net to 290.0/net and an average of 65.5/net. Aside from 146.8/net sampled in 2013, recent catch rates have fallen well below the historical average. Lengths ranged from 4.9 to 10.6 inches with an average of 8.3 inches. Approximately 16% of Yellow Perch sampled were 10 inches or longer. Fish were mostly young with over half the sample 3 years old. Growth was moderate with 8 inches surpassed by their third year. Yellow Perch remain an important species in Lura Lake and are one of the more commonly targeted species by anglers. <br> \n <br> \nA total of 9 Channel Catfish were sampled in 2020 for catch rate of 1.1/net. The 2017 survey was the first record of Channel Catfish in Lura Lake when 4 were sampled. Lengths ranged from 7.4 inches to 26.9 inches with an average of 18.6 inches. The wide range of lengths sampled offers strong evidence of multiple year-classes and natural reproduction occurring in the lake. It remains unknown how Channel Catfish were introduced into Lura Lake but they do offer an additional game species to target and may take advantage of abundant black bullheads for food. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Bullheads are often the most abundant fish sampled in Lura Lake surveys and 2020 was no different. A total of 461 were sampled for a catch rate of 57.6/net, indicating high numbers were present. From 1994 to 2020, catch rates have varied from 15.0/net to 525.5/net with an average of 128.6/net. The degraded nature of Lura Lake matches well with Black Bullhead habitat preferences and they will likely remain an abundant species for years to come. <br> \n <br> \nA total of 22 Common Carp were sampled in 2020 for a catch rate of 2.8/net. Common Carp have become more common in recent surveys and likely have a negative impact on water quality. <br> \n <br> \nThe only other species sampled in 2020 was the Golden Shiner. <br> \n <br> \nWater clarity was poor with a secchi depth of just 1.5 feet. Dissolved oxygen and water temperature readings ranged from 6.1 ppm and 76.6 degrees Fahrenheit at the surface to 1.1 ppm and 76.5 degrees Fahrenheit at 9 feet. No thermocline was detected. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers can play an important role in maintaining or improving a fish population by practicing selective harvest. Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for consumption, while encouraging the release of medium to large fish that may contribute to natural reproduction. This practice helps maintain balance in the fish populations and provides anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future. Additionally, smaller fish often taste better and have fewer contaminants than larger, older fish from the same water body. <br> \n <br> \nShoreline property owners also play an important role in the overall health of an aquatic ecosystem, including the fish population. Natural shorelines, including vegetation, woody debris, and bottom substrates, provide valuable habitat for fish and wildlife, help maintain water quality, and reduce bank erosion. Cattails and bulrushes are particularly beneficial for fish spawning, rearing, and feeding. By leaving natural shorelines unaltered or restoring them to natural conditions, shoreline property owners are doing their part to maintain or improve a healthy ecosystem in the lake and protect the resource for future generations. <br> \n <br> \n- Sky Wigen, Fisheries Specialist <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lura Lake is a 1,358-acre lake located approximately 4 miles southwest of the town of Mapleton in Blue Earth County. Lura lake has a maximum depth of 9 feet. Lura Lake is a hypereutrophic lake and the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency describes the overall condition of the lake as, \"Not always suitable for swimming and wading due to low clarity or excessive algae caused by the presence of nutrients such as phosphorus in the water.\" The watershed is dominated by agriculture which has negatively affected the lake. For many years the lake has been aerated and no winterkills have been reported since a lake wide reclamation in 1994. Eurasian Watermilfoil and curly leaf pondweed are abundant and a nuisance to boating and fishing at certain times of the year. There are 4 public accesses on the lake; two in Daly Park, one on the west side of the north basin, and one on the west side of the south basin. The lake is primarily managed for Northern Pike and Walleye and secondarily for Black Crappie, Bluegill, Largemouth Bass, and Yellow Perch. From 2021 to 2023, approximately 612,000 Walleye fry were stocked annually. Lura Lake is designated as a Tier-1 lake and will be surveyed as part of a regular monitoring program at a frequency of every 3 years. <br> \n <br> \nThe 2023 survey was completed the week of 28 August 2023 using 8 gill nets and 11 trap nets. Daytime electrofishing for Largemouth bass was completed 26 May 2023 as Largemouth Bass are not effectively sampled by traditional netting gear. Water quality parameters were also recorded. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappies were abundant in 2023 with a total of 230 sampled in gill nets for a catch rate of 28.8/net. Black Crappie catch rates have varied from 0.0/net to 57.5/net with a mean of 8.8/net since 1994. Trap nets also sampled a high number of Black Crappies, an average of 33.7 were sampled per trap net, also well above the third quartile (6.5/net) for class 39 lakes. A rarity in surveys prior to 2002 (n = 8), Black Crappies have become common in Lura Lake. Black Crappie ranged from 3.2 to 14.6 inches with a mean of 6.1 inches. Black Crappie were aged using otoliths and scales. Ages ranged from age-1 to age-6 with 6 year classes present, indicating consistent recruitment. A majority of the sample was age-2. Growth was fast with 10 inches exceeded around age-3. Black Crappies have become an important part of the Lura Lake fish community in a time when winterkill no longer occurs regularly. <br> \n <br> \nBluegills sampled in trap nets at a rate of 12.1/net. Bluegill catch rates have varied from 0.8/net to 73.4/net with an average of 19.5/net since 1994. In 2023 lengths ranged from 3.2 to 7.2 inches with an average of 4.1 inches. Bluegills were aged using otoliths and scales. Ages ranged from age-1 to age-4 with 4-year classes present. Age-1 and Age-2 fish made up ninety percent of the sample. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass were sampled using daytime boat electrofishing in May of 2023. This is because Largemouth Bass are typically less susceptible to sampling when using passive gears such as trap nets and gill nets. Largemouth Bass were sampled at a rate of 34.3/ hour of electrofishing. Largemouth Bass caught electrofishing ranged in size from 3.0 to 20.1 inches and averaged 10.8 inches in length. One hundred and ten Largemouth Bass were sample using gill nets and trap nets. These fish ranged in length from 4.4 to 19.8 inches. Ninety-seven percent of these fish were under 10 inches in length. The Largemouth Bass population in Lura Lake is abundant and has a variety of sizes available to anglers. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike were sampled at a rate of 14.3/ gill net, down from the historically high numbers in 2020 (33.3/net). Northern Pike numbers have surged in recent surveys after being sampled at low levels prior to 2013. Northern Pike in 2023 ranged from 14.0 inches to 32.5 inches with an average of 26.0 inches. Approximately 77% exceeded the legal minimum length limit of 24 inches. The high abundance and moderate size structure should allow for great angling over the next few years. <br> \n <br> \nA total of 31 Walleyes were sampled in 2023 for a catch rate of 3.9/net. Walleyes were extremely abundant in surveys completed from 1994 to 2002 but have declined sharply since then. Walleye ranged from 7.5 to 27.1 inches with an average of 21.3 inches. Walleye were aged using otoliths. Walleye were age-1 to age-12 with 7 year classes present. Approximately 48% were age-3 to age-5. Interestingly the 2020 year class was the largest with 7 individuals, though no stocking was done due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Growth was fast with 15 inches exceeded by age-2. Walleye fry stocking has become less and less effective in Lura Lake. Without winterkills or reclamations, it is unreasonable to expect Walleye numbers to return to the high levels enjoyed in the 1990s and early 2000s. <br> \n <br> \nA total of 407 Yellow Perch were sampled for a catch rate of 50.8/net. Yellow Perch numbers have fluctuated wildly from 1994 to 2023 with a range of 1.0/net to 290.0/net and an average of 64.6/net. Aside from 146.8/net sampled in 2013, recent catch rates have fallen below the historical mean. Lengths ranged from 5.4 to 9.7 inches with an average of 6.6 inches. Yellow Perch remain an important species in Lura Lake. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Bullheads are often the most abundant fish sampled in Lura Lake surveys. In 2023 Black Bullheads were sampled at a rate of 58.0/gill net, just barely exceeding the lake class third quartile (57.5/net). Catch rates have varied from 15.0/net to 525.5/net with an average of 123.9/net since 1994. The degraded nature of Lura Lake matches well with Black Bullhead habitat preferences, and they will likely remain an abundant species for years to come. <br> \n <br> \nA total of 66 Common Carp were sampled for a catch rate of 2.8/gill net. Common Carp have become more common in recent surveys and likely have a negative impact on water quality. Bigmouth Buffalo were the most abundant species in 2023 with 482 being sampled, all but one was under 10 inches in length.  <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled in low numbers included Channel Catfish and Golden Shiner. <br> \n <br> \nWater clarity was poor with a secchi depth of just 1.5 feet. Dissolved oxygen and water temperature readings ranged from 6.7 ppm and 77.0 degrees Fahrenheit at one foot to 6.8 ppm and 76.6 degrees Fahrenheit at 8 feet. No thermocline was detected. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers can play an important role in maintaining or improving a fish population by practicing selective harvest. Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for consumption, while encouraging the release of medium to large fish that may contribute to natural reproduction. This practice helps maintain balance in the fish populations and provides anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future. Additionally, smaller fish often taste better and have fewer contaminants than larger, older fish from the same water body. <br> \n <br> \nShoreline property owners also play an important role in the overall health of an aquatic ecosystem, including the fish population. Natural shorelines, including vegetation, woody debris, and bottom substrates, provide valuable habitat for fish and wildlife, help maintain water quality, and reduce bank erosion. Cattails and bulrushes are particularly beneficial for fish spawning, rearing, and feeding. By leaving natural shorelines unaltered or restoring them to natural conditions, shoreline property owners are doing their part to maintain or improve a healthy ecosystem in the lake and protect the resource for future generations. <br> \n <br> \n-Tyler Fellows, fisheries specialist <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lura Lake was chemically reclaimed in September, 1994 and restocked with bluegills, black crappies, largemouth bass, northern pike and walleyes.  The fish community has developed nicely and the lake now offers good to very good fishing.  Angler reports from the 1998-99 winter and the results of this netting assessment indicate that the best fishing may be for yellow perch.  Perch in the 8 to 10 inch length were very abundant in the survey nets.  Smaller perch were also common and they will provide an excellent food supply for the walleyes and northern pike.     Although Lura Lake is relatively large at 1,224 acres, angler harvest is still a major factor affecting the fish community.  Anglers need to practice catch and release or selective harvest by returning some of the fish they catch to ensure that fishing will remain as good as it is today.  Such \"recycling\" of fish is especially important in maintaining good numbers of large walleyes, northerns and largemouth bass in Lura Lake.     Lura Lake is one the lakes in the Quad Lakes watershed project.  Led by local citizens, the Quad Lakes watershed project has been extremely effective in helping to improve water quality in Lura Lake.  The Quad Lakes watershed project has fixed many miles of eroding lakeshore as well as planting many miles of buffer strips to protect the shoreline and filter runoff entering the lake.  The watershed project has protected key lands and used other management techniques to reduce the flow of sediment and nutrients into the lake.  The Quad Lakes watershed project is an excellent example of citizens working with government to improve and protect valuable resources such as Lura Lake and its fish community. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lura Lake is a 1,358 acre lake located approximately 4 miles southwest of the town of Mapleton in Blue Earth County. It has a maximum depth of 9 feet. Lura is a hypereutrophic lake and the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency describes the overall condition of the lake as, \"Not always suitable swimming and wading due to low clarity or excessive algae caused by the presence of nutrients such as phosphorus in the water.\" The watershed is dominated by agriculture and has negatively affected the lake. For many years the lake has been aerated and no winterkills have been reported since a lake wide reclamation in 1994. Eurasian water milfoil and curly leaf pondweed are abundant and a nuisance to boating and fishing at certain times of the year. There are 4 public accesses on the lake; two in Daly Park, one on the west side of the north basin, and one on the west side of the south basin. The lake is primarily managed for Walleye and Yellow Perch and secondarily for Black Crappie, Bluegill, Largemouth Bass, and Northern Pike. In recent years, 1,224,000 Walleye fry have been stocked every other year starting in 2010. In 2008, 823 adult and 2,551 fingerling Northern Pike were stocked. All other game fish maintain their populations through natural reproduction. A standard survey was completed in 2017 as part of a regular monitoring program conducted by the Minnesota DNR. This survey was intended to assess the fish community by deploying 4 gill nets, 11 trap nets, and 83 minutes of boat electrofishing. Water quality parameters were also recorded. <br> \n <br> \nA standard survey was conducted on 28 August 2017 by the MN DNR using day-time electrofishing to assess the Largemouth Bass population. A standard survey is used for sampling a wide range of fish species during the summer months using standard methods (time of year, set sampling stations, taking water clarity readings and oxygen/temperature profiles, etc.) and gears (gillnets, trap nets, and spring electrofishing for Largemouth Bass). This survey was intended to assess the fish community by deploying 4 gill nets, 11 trap nets, and 83 minutes of boat electrofishing. Water quality parameters were also recorded. <br> \n <br> \nA total of 19 Walleye were sampled with gill nets for a catch rate of 4.8/net, which indicated moderate numbers were present. Walleye catch rates were high averaging 27.3/net over ten years after the 1994 reclamation. Since 2004, catch rates have dropped to an average of 5.5/net. Lengths in 2017 ranged from 16.5 to 27.1 inches with an average of 21.5 inches. The sample was dominated by larger fish and approximately 74% of the sample was larger than 20 inches. An additional 25.0 inch fish was sampled with trap nets. Fish ranged from 2 to 10 years old with 4 year classes present. Fifty-five percent of the fish were 3 years old and 30% were 6 years old. Just over half the sample was aged to stocked year classes. <br> \n <br> \nA total of 37 Yellow Perch were sampled with gill nets for a catch rate of 9.3/net, which indicated low to moderate numbers were present. Catch rates since 1994 have been extremely variable ranging from 1.0/net to 290.0/net with an average of 69.9/net. In 3 out of 5 surveys since 2004, catch rates have failed to exceed 10.0/net. Lengths in 2017 ranged from 5.8 to 12.1 inches with an average of 7.4 inches. Only 5% of the population was larger than 10 inches. An additional 112 Yellow Perch ranging from 5.1 to 10.1 inches were sampled with trap nets. Ages ranged from 1 to 4 years old with 4 year classes present. Over 81% of the population was 1 year old. Although the catch rate was low, the abundance of 1 and 2 year old fish suggest a healthy population that should provide both angling opportunity and prey for predator game species. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie were very abundant in 2017. A total of 497 were sampled with trap nets for a catch rate of 45.3/net, which was the highest on record since the 1994 reclamation. Post-reclamation, catch rates were low ranging from 0.1/net to 3.0/net from 1995 to 2002. Since 2002, catch rates increased to an average of 17.7/net. Lengths in 2017 ranged from 2.9 to 14.2 inches with an average of 6.5 inches. Approximately 7% of the catchable population was greater than 10.0 inches. An additional 52 fish ranging from 5.2 to 14.6 inches were sampled with gill nets. Fish ranged from 1 to 8 years old with 5 year classes present. Approximately 88% was 1 year old. In 2017, the Black Crappie population in Lura Lake continued to increase in abundance and become a bigger component of an increasingly diverse fishery. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill were the most abundant fish sampled in 2017. A total of 807 were caught for a catch rate of 73.4/net, which indicated high numbers were present. This was the highest catch rate on record since the 1994 reclamation. From 1995 to 2002, the average catch rate was just 7.8/net. Since then, catch rates increased to an average of 37.7/net. Lengths in 2017 ranged from 3.1 to 10.3 inches with an average of 4.8 inches. Approximately 14% of the catchable population exceeded 6 inches. Ages ranged from 1 to 4 years old with 3 year classes present. One and two year old fish accounted for more than 99% of the sample. In recent years, Bluegill have become a prominent member of the Lura Lake fish community and offer an additional angling opportunity. <br> \n <br> \nA total of 65 Largemouth Bass were sampled with boat electrofishing for a catch rate of 46.8/hour on-time which was slightly higher than the previous two samples on record. The catch rate in 2000 was 40.0/hour and in 2013 was 33.6/hour. Lengths ranged from 3.4 to 19.3 inches with an average of 10.9 inches. Approximately 18% of the catchable population was greater than 15.0 inches. An additional 8 fish ranging from 4.5 to 20.1 inches were sampled with gill and trap nets. Fish were not aged however the length frequency distribution suggested the presence of many strong year classes as well as consistent reproduction. Like other species, Largemouth Bass numbers increased in Lura Lake in recent years. <br> \n <br> \nA total of 20 Northern Pike were sampled with gill nets for a catch rate of 5.0/net, indicating low to moderate numbers were present. Few Northern Pike were sampled during the post reclamation period from 1995 to 2008 with an average catch rate of just 1.4/net. In 2008, a number of adult and fingerling Northern Pike were stocked to boost the population and in 2013 the catch rate jumped to 10.0/net. Lengths in 2017 ranged from 20.1 to 38.6 inches with an average of 27.9 inches. Approximately 45% of the catchable sample exceeded 28 inches. An additional 8 fish ranging from 10.8 to 37.6 inches were sampled with trap nets. Fish were not aged however the size structure suggests at least some natural reproduction was occurring and the population had reached a self-sustaining level following the 2008 stocking event.  <br> \n <br> \nChannel Catfish were sampled in Lura Lake for the first time in 2017 since the 1994 reclamation. A total of 12 were sampled with gill and trap nets. Lengths ranged from 13.9 to 23.7 inches. There was no record of stocking Channel Catfish within the last 10 years so the source of these fish was unknown. Anglers are reminded it is illegal to move fish from one body of water to another. <br> \n <br> \nA total of 22 Common Carp were sampled with gill nets for a catch rate of 5.5/net, which indicated high numbers were present. Common Carp remained rare in the first few years following the 1994 reclamation but eventually increased to a high of 8.5/net in 2008. As long as the lake remains relatively stable and the fish community diverse, Common Carp numbers should not return to the pre-reclamation 1994 catch rate of 27.5/net. <br> \n <br> \nA total of 271 Black Bullhead were sampled with gill nets for a catch rate of 67.8, which indicated high numbers were present. After remaining at moderate levels from 1995 to 1999, numbers increased from 2000 to 2006, reaching a high of 525.5/net in 2006 before falling to 31.0/net in 2013. Lengths in 2017 ranged from 5.4 to 15.7 inches with an average of 9.0 inches. Anglers looking to target bullhead in 2018 could do worse than Lura Lake where over a third of the catchable population exceeded 9.0 inches. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled in 2017 include Golden Shiner, Green Sunfish, and hybrid sunfish. <br> \n <br> \nTemperature and oxygen readings ranged from 70.7 degrees Fahrenheit and 9.1 ppm at the surface to 70.5 degrees Fahrenheit and 8.7 ppm at 9.0 feet. The lake is shallow and windswept and no thermocline was detected in 2017. <br> \n-Sky Wigen, fisheries specialist  <br> \n</p>",

THE NORTHERN PIKE POPUALTION REMAINS LOW AND AVGS 0.50/GILLNET REPRODUCTION OF NORTHERNS IS TAKING PLACE AS EVIDENCED BY ONE YY AND ONE I YR CLASS NORTHERN BEING CAPTURED. LURA HAS A HELLTHY CRAPPIE POPULATION THAT IS MADE UP OF EQUAL PARTS WHITE AND BLACK CRAPPIES. THE PRESENT CRAPPIE POPULATIONS HAVE BEEN RECRUITED SINCE THE 84 SURVEY. BLACK CRAPPIES ARE REPRESENT- ED BY I, II, III, AND IV YR CLASSES. BALCK CRAPPIE ARE DOMINATED BY III YR CLASS FISH WITH A STRONG IV YR CLASS PRESENT. THE BLACK CRAPPIE CATCH WAS SIMILAR TO THE 82 CATCH, NOW AVERAGING 27.50/TRAP- NET COMPARED TO 30.00/TRAPNET IN 82. WHITE CRAPPIE WERE WELL REPRESENTED BY FOUR YR CLASSES I-IV.

In the 1993 survey, black crappies were netted in average numbers, while more bluegills than average were caught.  Yellow perch are abundant, and most are 6-8 inches.

                "narrative": "<p>\tLura Lake in Blue Earth County is a 1,359 acre lake south of Mapleton. A DNR-owned public access is located in the easternmost basin, a second access is located in Daly county park, and a third public access operated by the Lura Lake Sportsman's Club is located on the south side of the lake. Eurasian watermilfoil was found in the lake in 2004. Boaters should be sure to remove all aquatic vegetation from boats, trailers, and equipment and drain all water when leaving Lura Lake to prevent the spread of Eurasian watermilfoil to other lakes. <br> \n\tLura lake was surveyed the week of September 2, 2008 to to monitor the fish community. Walleye gillnet catches dropped from 8 fish per net in 2006 to 3.5 fish in 2008. Average gill netted walleye size increased from 4.6 to 4.9 pounds, and trap netted walleye size increased from 4.1 to 5.8 pounds. 1.2 million walleye fry are stocked 3 out of 4 years. Northern pike gill net catches remained stable. 2006 catches were less than 1 fish per gill net and trap net; 2008 catches for gill net averaged 1.5 fish per net and 0.2 fish per trap net. Average (mean) pike size is large, averaging 6 pounds in trap nets and 9 pounds in gill nets. <br> \n\tLargemouth bass, while not well sampled by netting, were caught in both trap and gill nets during the assessment. Eight year classes were found in the lake, with fish from 4 to 20 inches in total length. Lura Lake is known to have a population of older, larger individuals. Hence, it has been a popular bass tournament lake.  <br> \n\tBluegill abundance was 26.6 fish per trap net in 2008, down from 30.3 fish two years ago. Black crappie abundance is mostly unchanged. 6.6 crappie per trap net and 4.5 crappie per gill net were taken in 2008 while 3.5 crappie were observed in trap nets and 6.0 fish in gill nets. Yellow perch abundance has increased. The 2006 survey averaged 1 fish per gill net lift, while the 2008 survey found 20.5 fish per lift.  <br> \n\tBlack bullhead abundance continues to sit in the upper quartile range for class 41 lakes. Gill net catches decreased from 525 fish in 2006 down to 452 in 2008. Carp abundance has increased from no fish caught in gill nets in 2006 to 8.5 per net in 2008, and 1.2 fish caught in trap nets in 2006 to 4.6 fish caught in 2008.  <br> \n\tLake reclamations are thought to keep undesirable fish species at manageable levels for around 15 years. In 2009, Lura Lake will reach its 15th anniversary since the 1994 reclamation. Carp and bullhead levels are reaching pre-reclamation numbers. Reclamation options may be examined in coming years, although there is still some interest in bass, pike, and walleye angling. <br> \n\tWater quality and shoreline erosion continue to be two large issues within Lura Lake. Shoreline erosion protection efforts are being taken in 2009 along county lands. Watershed practices, layout, and hydrography have long dictated water quality on Lura Lake, so it will take time and land use changes to see results in these conditions. <br> \n\tAnglers can help maintain or improve the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest. Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for table fare, but encourages release of medium- to large-sized fish. Releasing these fish can help maintain balance in the fish community in Lura Lake and provide anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future.  <br> \n\tShoreline areas on the land and into the shallow water provide essential habitat for fish and wildlife that live in or near Minnesota\u0019s lakes. Overdeveloped shorelines can\u0019t support the fish, wildlife, and clean water that are associated with natural undeveloped lakes.  <br> \n\tShoreline habitat consists of aquatic plants, woody plants and natural lake bottom soils. Plants in the water and at the water\u0019s edge provide habitat, prevent erosion and absorb excess nutrients. Shrubs, trees, and woody debris such as fallen trees or limbs provide good habitat both above and below the water and should be left in place. By leaving a buffer strip of natural vegetation along the shoreline, property owners can reduce erosion, help maintain water quality, and provide habitat and travel corridors for wildlife.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of the nearshore fish community on Lura Lake was conducted on August 2, 2017 by Fisheries Lake IBI program staff. Sampling stations were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at all eighteen stations with two sites sampled from the boat. Coarse woody habitat and deep water prevented the use of seines at three sampling sites. Nearshore sampling captured 8 native species of fish including Tadpole Madtom, Yellow Perch, and Largemouth Bass.   <br> \n <br> \nData from this targeted nearshore survey is combined with data from a standard gill and trap netting survey in August 2017 to calculate a Fish-based Index of Biologic Integrity (FIBI) score that describes the overall health of the lake. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment.  The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. The FIBI score for Lura Lake based on this survey is below the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes.  Data from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Le Sueur River Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.   For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lura Lake was reclaimed in September, 1994 and stocked with bluegill, black crappie, largemouth bass, northern pike, and walleye.  With the exception of black crappie, the fish community has developed nicely and yellow perch, walleye, and largemouth bass fishing has been good to excellent this past year.  The fish community continues to improve with increased size and numbers.  The large standing crop of yellow perch in the 7.5-9.0 inch range has cycled through and a large number of young, 5.5-7.0 inch fish are expected to enter the creel in 2000.           The Quad Lakes Watershed Project continues to restore eroding shoreline and establish buffer strips.  The citizen-led watershed group has protected key lands and reduced the flow of nutrients into the lake.  The Quad Lakes Watershed Project is an excellent example of citizens working with government to improve and protect valuable resources such as Lura Lake and its fish community.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lura Lake is a moderately large (1224 acres) and shallow (maximum depth 9 ft) lake in southern Blue Earth and northern Faribault Counties, northeast of Winnebago and southwest of Mapleton.  Eurasian milfoil was found in the south part of Lura Lake in September 2004.  This is the first occurrence of this exotic plant in Blue Earth or Faribault counties.  Boaters should make sure to remove all aquatic vegetation from boats and trailers when leaving Lura Lake to prevent the spread of Eurasian milfoil to other lakes.  A fishery population assessment was conducted on Lura Lake in late August 2004.  Walleye gill net catch has generally been high in Lura Lake since the reclamation in 1994.  In 2004 walleye ranged from 14 to 25 inches long with an average length of 19 inches.  Black bullhead catch in both gill and trap nets has increased from 1996 through 2004.  In 2004 the catch rate of black bullhead in both gill nets and trap nets exceeded the normal range compared to other similar lakes in Minnesota.  Most black bullhead were around 5 to 8 inches long with some up to 15 inches.  Yellow perch gill net catches were high in 1998 and trap net catches were high in 1999.  Since then yellow perch catch has declined to moderate numbers.  Golden shiner were abundant in the gill nets with a mean catch of 19.5 per net.  Northern pike were caught in moderate numbers in the gill nets and ranged from 24 to 31 inches in length.  Bluegill catch per trap net was low in the mid 1990's and has since increased with the mean catch per trap net above normal compared to other similar lakes in Minnesota.  Most bluegill were around 5 to 6.5 inches long.  While not reflected in the netting, excellent largemouth bass fishing opportunities exist.  Curly-leaved pondweed can be abundant in May and June.  The Eurasian milfoil may become more abundant in the future.  In 2004 it was limited to small isolated clumps.  A number of access are located on Lura Lake.  Daly County Park on the east side of Lura Lake has a boat launch, fishing piers, and camping.  A DNR boat launch is located next to the county park on the eastern basin.  Access is also available on the northwest shore.  An aeration system is operated on this lake in the winter.  Use caution when traveling on the ice.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lura Lake is a moderately large, shallow, prairie lake in southern Blue Earth and northern Faribault Counties.  Eurasian milfoil was found in the south part of Lura Lake in September 2004.  This is the first occurrence of this exotic plant in Blue Earth or Faribault counties.  Boaters should make sure to remove all aquatic vegetation from boats and trailers when leaving Lura Lake to prevent the spread of Eurasian milfoil to other lakes.  Ice fishermen are urged to use caution as the lake has been aerated since 1976 to avoid winterkill, resulting in thin ice.   <br> \n <br> \nLura Lake was reclaimed in 1994 to reduce abundances of undesirable species.  Fish stocking following the reclamation resulted in a fish community dominated by game fish, particularly walleye, providing good angling opportunities for several years.  In recent years, the community appears to be shifting back to black bullhead domination.  Black bullhead catch in both gill and trap nets has increased dramatically from 1996 through 2006.  In 2006, the catch rate of black bullhead in both gill nets and trap nets exceeded the normal range compared to similar lakes in Minnesota and the gill net catch of 525.5/net was the highest observed for the lake.  Most black bullhead were around 6 to 9 inches long.  Walleye gill net catch has generally been high in Lura Lake since the reclamation in 1994, but has declined since 2002.  In 2006, walleye were generally of large size, ranging from 20 to 27 inches long, providing rare angler opportunities to catch a trophy walleye in southern Minnesota.  Although abundant in the late 1990s, yellow perch gill net catches have declined to low numbers.  Only one northern pike was captured, despite frequent stocking of this species.  Bluegill catch per trap net was above normal compared to similar lakes in Minnesota.  Most bluegills were around 5 to 7.5 inches long, providing good angling opportunity for this species.  Black crappie were sampled in relatively low abundance but were generally of a size acceptable by anglers with most fish ranging from 7.5-9 inches long.  While not reflected in the netting, excellent largemouth bass fishing opportunities are known to exist in Lura Lake.   <br> \n</p>",
