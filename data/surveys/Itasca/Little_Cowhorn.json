                "narrative": "<p>Little Cowhorn Lake has a long history of low winter oxygen levels with many severe winterkills documented and several years when it was opened to \"unlimited fishing\".  Northern pike rescue operations were done on the lake from the late 1930's to 1970, and walleye were reared in 1983 with no success.  Fish populations appear to have successful natural reproduction although immigration of many species occurs in the spring through the outlet to the Mississippi River.The gill net and trap net catch rates (CPUE's) for all species were compared to a median for all lakes that are ecologically similar and grouped into lake class #39.  This classification represents many lakes that have a history of winterkill although Little Cowhorn Lake could very well be the most susceptible of this group in this management area.The present fish population is typical for this type of lake.  Most species are at normal catch rate levels, although the black bullhead gill net CPUE is 112.7 fish/net, twice that of the third quartile of 52.3 fish/net, and at the third quartile of 22.0 fish/trapnet.  Their sizes range between 5 to 7 inches.  Northern pike CPUE's are at or above the third quartile of both the gill net and trap net indices with an overall average weight of 2.8 lbs./fish.  Growth rates for northern pike are fast at 22.7 inches at age 3 with the 1987 year class composing 73% of the sample.The forage base is high with good numbers of minnows and a large number of young-of-the-year yellow perch as indicated by the shoreline seining.  Northern pike fishing could be good but the heavy submergent vegetations restricts standard fishing techniques; therefore, it is felt that this population is under-utilized.</p>",
