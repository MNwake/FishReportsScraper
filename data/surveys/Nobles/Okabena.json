                "narrative": "<p>Okabena Lake is a 751-acre lake, located in Nobles County in the City of Worthington.  Since 2018, Okabena Lake has been included in a research project that is evaluating the performance of two strains of Walleye, the Lower Mississippi Strain (LMS) and the Mississippi Strain (MIS).  The total fry quota for Okabena Lake was 376,000, of which half were MIS and half were LMS.  The MIS Walleye come from northern Minnesota and until recently, were the primary strain stocked in Windom management area lakes.  The LMS originated in the Cannon River system, was stocked in area lakes in the 1980's and early 1990's, and has persisted in some area Walleye populations despite extensive stocking of other Minnesota strains of Walleye.  LMS Walleye are present in Murray County's Lake Sarah, a lake that hasn't been stocked since 1991 because the Walleye population is sustained at high levels through natural reproduction.  Okabena Lake has areas of spawning habitat and has shown sporadic natural reproduction, thus LMS Walleye have been stocked because anecdotal evidence suggests that they may have a survival advantage and natural reproduction potential in southern Minnesota lakes.  To evaluate strain performance, 50 Walleye yearlings and 210 Walleye fingerlings were needed from Okabena Lake in 2019.  A gill net, trap nets and electrofishing were used to collect Walleye for the study.   <br> \n <br> \nThe fingerling (age-0) quota was met as 214 fingerlings were captured with electrofishing (34.9 per hour).  Fingerlings ranged in length from 4.8 to 7.8 inches and averaged 5.8 inches.  The yearling quota was met as 57 yearlings were captured with electrofishing (9.3 per hour). Yearlings ranged in length from 10.6 to 14.1 inches and averaged 12.6 inches.  Results of which strain performed better are not yet available.   <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Okabena Lake is a 752 acre lake that is managed primarily for walleye and channel catfish.  This class 41 lake is also managed secondarily for black crappie, white crappie, and yellow perch.  Winterkill has never been a problem due in part to dredging on the east end of the lake and due to installation of a 9-helixor aeration system.  Considerable recreational open water activities, open water and ice fishing and boating activities are observed during the year.  Channel catfish fingerlings were stocked in 1994 and 1998.  Walleye fry are stocked two of every three years at 750 fry/littoral acre.  In an effort to measure the catch, effort, and recreational use, a roving creel survey is scheduled during the summer of 2001 and winter of 2001-2002.The average walleye gill net catch rate was 16.60 fish/net.  The walleye catch rate has consistently been close or higher than the upper average range (15.33 fish/net) for this type of lake.  The mean walleye length was 16.43 inches.  Most of the walleyes (45%) were in the 14-17 inch range.  It was determined that 77% of the assigned ages for walleye were correlated back to fry stockings in 1997 and 1998.  Walleye fry were stocked in the spring of 2000 and scheduled for fry stocking in the spring of 2001.  Good \"frying pan sized\" walleyes are available to the angler on Okabena Lake.       The average channel catfish gill net catch rate was 2.20 fish/net.  Channel catfish captured were Age 5 (mean length=470 mm), Age 13 (Length=574 mm), Age 14 (mean length=677 mm), and Age 17 (mean length=714 mm).  Channel catfish tend to grow slow in lakes compared to river systems.  So ethical harvest of channel catfish is important while fishing because a slow growing population takes time to establish.  Channel catfish may be a valuable tool for controlling black bullhead numbers. The average yellow perch gill net catch rate was 64.60 fish/net.  The catch rate for yellow perch exceeded the upper average range (22.50 fish/net) for this lake class.  Most of the fish (69%) were in the 6-8 inch range.      The average black crappie trap net catch rate was 9.50 fish/net.  The catch rate for black crappie was greater than the average (2.96 fish/net) for this lake class.  Most of the fish (72 %) were in the 6-7 inch range.  The mean bluegill trap net catch rate was 12.67 fish/net. The bluegill catch rate was close to the upper average range (14.93 fish/net) for this lake class.  Bluegill population relative abundance has never been as high as in 2000.  Most of the fish, based on aging from scales, were from the 1997 (28%) and 1998 (56%) year classes.  These year classes were likely from natural reproduction because bluegill have not been stocked since 1990.  A good panfish population is coming on strong and could provide some good angling.     The average pumpkinseed trap net catch rate was 15.25 fish/net. The catch rate of pumpkinseed for the upper average range (4.47 fish/net) was exceeded.  Most of the fish (60%) were from the 1996 year class. The pumpkinseed population was likely a result of natural reproduction and potentially improved nursery habitat (vegetation).  The pumpkinseed population could provide some nice fillets for the angling public.     The average black bullhead gill net catch rate was 79.20 fish/net.  These bullheads could be caught and fried, based on the sizes of fish sampled.     To promote and maintain healthy fish populations, pollution and other inputs need to be controlled.  Fish habitats are directly affected by water quality.  Nutrient, sediment and other waste inputs can drastically alter the biological, chemical, and physical components of a lake.  It is paramount to maintain if not improve the current water quality of Okabena Lake through watershed management to preserve this fishery for future generations to enjoy.                 </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Okabena is a 751-acre lake located within the city limits of Worthington in Nobles County.  Okabena has a maximum depth of 16 feet with approximately 5 miles of shoreline, which has been almost entirely developed.  Okabena is managed primarily for walleye and channel catfish and secondarily for bluegill, yellow perch, black crappie, and white crappie.  A population assessment was conducted during the week of August 21, 2006 using gill nets and trap nets. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye numbers are high once again on Lake Okabena.  Walleye numbers have not been this high since 1982 and 2002.  Based on the historical surveys, the walleye catch rate has exceeded or met the upper normal range for 10 years.  The catch rate for walleye was 34.0 fish/gill net, which was more than double the normal range.  A large portion of the walleye sampled were in the 15 to 17 inches and would be considered \"good eaters\".  Okabena would be high on the priority list for the 2007 opener in the Windom Area if you are targeting walleye. <br> \n <br> \nChannel catfish numbers are on the rebound since our 2002 successful stocking of channel catfish.  Although numbers of catfish are higher, all but 1 fish were in the 6.5 to 9.0 inch range.  If you are looking for channel catfish, consider Round Lake or Fish Lake in Jackson County. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill numbers are in the normal range and averaged 5 inches in length.  Four year classes of fish were sampled with a majority of the fish being Age 1.  The pumpkinseed catch rate was in the normal range and averaged 4.6 inches.  As with the bluegill age structure, the 2005 year class dominated the catch, which may suggest that submergent vegetation was more abundant in 2005 than in the past.  Bluegill, pumpkinseed, and largemouth bass numbers are often dependent on aquatic vegetation. <br> \n <br> \nIf you are targeting panfish, it would seem yellow perch are a species to catch in Okabena.  Yellow perch are extremely abundant and average almost 8 inches in length.  Black and white crappies are almost equally abundant.  Both species have catch rates within the expected range and averaged nearly 6 inches in length.  Both species are quite plump which indicated the fish are healthy and foraging successfully.  It will be a few years until some real \"slabs\" are caught.  If you are looking for good sized crappie in the Worthington area, you may consider Indian Lake in Nobles County right away in the spring.     <br> \n <br> \nEfforts to improve the health of the lake should focus on best management practices within the watershed.  Improvements and education in land stewardship will often have secondary benefits to the lake in the way of quality and quantity of habitat.  Generally, improvements in the quality and quantity of lake habitat will mean direct improvements of the fishery. <br> \n <br> \nPrepared by <br> \n <br> \nRyan Doorenbos <br> \n     <br> \n <br> \n         <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Okabena Lake, in Nobles County, is a 751-acre lake located entirely within the city limits of Worthington.  Okabena receives over 14,000 acres of drainage from agricultural row cropping and has a watershed-to-lake ratio of 19 to 1.  Due mostly to historical dredging, Okabena has a maximum depth of about 14 feet and 6.5 miles of shoreline that is nearly all developed.  Much of the shoreline that is not in private ownership is owned by the City of Worthington, which allows public access for fishing.  The Southwest Minnesota Fishing Club, over the years, has used rip-rap projects on private property as a club fund raiser to stabilize the shoreline in the windswept basin.  As a result, most of the shoreline has been rip-rapped.  Each year the United State National Wind Surfing competition takes place on Okabena Lake.  In recent years, the issue of a good shoreline devoid of rip-rap for those using the lake for wind surfing has become an issue of discussion between the city and the Division of Waters.  As this event grows in popularity, good access of shoreline may surface again.  Walleye and channel catfish are the primary species of management along with bluegill, yellow perch, crappie (white and black) as secondary fisheries.  Because of its importance as an angling and recreational destination in southwest Minnesota, we monitor the fish community in Okabena every other year.  A population assessment was conducted on Okabena during the week of August 23, 2010 using 3 gill nets and 12 trap nets. <br> \n <br> \nThe walleye catch rate in gill nets was 14.7 fish/net, which was near the upper quartile of 15.3 fish/set.  Historically, the catch rates have ranged from 4.3 to 36.5 fish/net.  Total lengths of walleye in gill nets ranged from 10 to 18 inches with a mean length of 12 inches.  Larger walleye may have been missed in the sample due to high catch rates of channel catfish in the gill nets which could have reduced the effectiveness of the net to catch large walleye.  Even so, the population of walleye appears to be dominated by fish smaller than 15 inches.  Otolith aging revealed that 4 year classes (2009, 2008, 2007, and 2006) were present in the net catches during this survey and all but one (2008) were the result of walleye fry stocking.  Sporadic natural reproduction may occur but not enough to support the population.  Walleye reached 10 inches by age 2 and 12 inches by age 3.  The overall condition of each fish was fair indicating a population of walleye that is experiencing some stress which is typical of a population of smaller individuals.  Growth and condition should increase as the population ages and stabilizes in the next several years leading to good number of fish greater than 15 inches. <br> \n <br> \nThe channel catfish catch rate in the gill nets in 2010 was an impressive 43.0 fish/net.  During the past 3 surveys the catch rate (fish/net) has increased from 8.7 in 2006 to 30.7 in 2008 and now finally to 43.0. The last time channel catfish were stocked in Okabena Lake was in 2004 when 18,700 fingerlings were stocked.  All but one channel catfish (from 2002 stocking) appear to be from the 2004 stocking and range from 12 to 19 inches with a mean of 17 inches.  The overall condition of the channel catfish population appears to be fair.  Angling for channel catfish should be excellent in Okabena Lake during the summer of 2011. <br> \n <br> \nThe yellow perch catch rate in gill nets was 24.7 fish/net in 2010, which is greater than the upper quartile of 22.5 fish/net.  Historically catch rates have ranged from 9.6 fish/net to 116.7 fish/net with a long term average catch rate of 57.2 fish/net.  Total lengths ranged from 7 to 11 inches with a mean length of 9 inches.  The yellow perch population is balanced based on the size structure of fish sampled in 2010.  The overall condition of yellow perch was good, which indicates the fish have plenty of forage available.  Fishing for yellow perch should be good in 2011. <br> \n <br> \nThe bluegill catch rate in trap nets was 6.3 fish/net, which was twice the expected mean catch rate (3.0 fish/net) and the second highest catch rate (highest was 12.7 fish/net in 2000) observed in Okabena Lake.  Given the history of bluegill abundance, competition with yellow perch and the marginal habitat quality for bluegill in Okabena Lake the population level appears to be very high.  Total lengths of bluegill ranged from 4 to 10 inches with a mean of 7 inches.  The future outlook for bluegill looks good due to the observation of age 0 bluegill (n > 4,800) in the near shore seining.  Angling for bluegill should be good in 2011.  Additionally, a high catch rate of hybrid sunfish (2.1 fish/net) will add to the angling opportunity for sunfish in Okabena Lake.    <br> \n <br> \nThe black crappie catch rate in trap nets was 8.8 fish/net, which is within the interquartile range (1.0 to 12.3 fish/net).  Total lengths ranged from 3 to 11 inches with a mean of 9 inches.  The black crappie population is dominated by fish in the 8 to 10 inch range.  The overall condition of each fish was very good indicating that the black crappie population was in excellent condition.  The outlook of the black crappie population looks good; the size structure shows an increase to bigger individuals and the condition of the fish indicates a healthy population. <br> \n <br> \nOther fish sampled in the survey were black bullhead, common carp, fathead minnow, freshwater drum, golden shiner, Iowa darter, Johnny darter, largemouth bass, northern pike, orangespotted sunfish, pumpkinseed, spottail shiner, tadpole madtom, and white sucker.  All abundances of these fishes were as expected or lower than expected, with exception of golden shiner, in relation to the interquartile ranges for each species.  The high catch rate of golden shiner, 5.4 fish /trap net, is their highest abundance observed since sampling has begun. <br> \n <br> \nEfforts to improve the health of the lake should focus on best management practices within the watershed.  Improvements and education in land stewardship will often have secondary benefits to the lake in the way of quality and quantity of habitat.  Generally, improvements in the quality and quantity of lake habitat will mean direct improvements of the fishery.  <br> \n  <br> \nPrepared by Nate Hodgins <br> \n</p>",

The seine hauls and electrofishing captured 22 species of fish, including Iowa Darter (N=2), Johnny Darter (N=11), Bigmouth Buffalo (N=3), Black Bullhead (N=39), Black Crappie (N=390), Bluegill (N=25), Channel Catfish (N=2), Common Carp (N=7), Fathead Minnow (N=86), Freshwater Drum (N=17), Golden Shiner (N=4), Green Sunfish (N=4), Hybrid Sunfish (N=7), Largemouth Bass (N=6), Orangespotted Sunfish (N=15), Pumpkinseed Sunfish (N=16), Spotfin Shiner (N=486), Walleye (N=2), White Crappie (N=1), White Sucker (N=3), Yellow Bullhead (N=2), and Yellow Perch (N=37). Natural Reproduction exists for some of the species in Okabena Lake, as young-of-the-year Bigmouth Buffalo, Black Bullhead, Black Crappie, Fathead Minnow, Freshwater Drum, Largemouth Bass, Walleye, and Yellow Perch were sampled.  The types of species and their respective abundances in nearshore IBI sampling will be used to determine the overall health of Okabena Lake.  The IBI score will provide insight into the quality of habitat and water within the lake and can indicate problems within the watershed that could adversely affect the fish community. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>INTRODUCTION <br> \nLake Okabena is a 751-acre lake located within the City of Worthington in Nobles County. Lake Okabena has a large watershed receiving drainage from over 14,000 acres of agricultural row crops and from part of the City of Worthington. Lake Okabena has an average depth of 8 feet and a maximum depth of 16 feet, which, until 1985, was maintained by dredging. Residential development has disturbed and altered some of Lake Okabena's shoreline; however, the majority of its shoreline is owned by the City of Worthington, which allows opportunity for shoreline anglers. In areas with residential development, lawns are typically maintained to the water's edge and shorelines are altered with rock riprap, disrupting what could be a natural riparian buffer. Excessive nutrient runoff from lawns, city streets, and agricultural fields likely contribute to Lake Okabena's cloudy water (1 foot clarity in 2018). Lake Okabena is managed for Walleye, Black Crappie, White Crappie, Bluegill, Largemouth Bass, and Yellow Perch. Walleye fry were stocked two out of three years from 2006 to 2016 (2006, 2007, 2009, 2010, 2012, 2013, 2015, and 2016).  However, in 2018 a different stocking regime started.  Walleye fry were stocked with 50% Lower Mississippi Strain (LMS) Walleye and 50% Mississippi Strain (MIS) (northern MN typical) Walleye in a strain comparison study.  The LMS Walleye is a recently identified strain that originated from the Canon River and Mississippi River south of Minneapolis.  The egg source for the LMS Walleye is Lake Sarah where this strain was historically stocked and has since flourished without stocking since 1991.  The study will be conducted with annual stocking for several years along with other southern Minnesota lakes to determine Walleye strain success.  For secondary species, in cooperation with the Southwest Minnesota Fishing Club, pre-spawn Bluegill, Largemouth Bass, Northern Pike, or Black Crappie are stocked annually into drainable wetlands that are connected to Lake Okabena via Whiskey Ditch. Water is retained in the ponds until early October, which allows the young-of-the-year (YOY) fish to grow to a size conducive for survival, and then is drained into Whiskey Ditch by the club and eventually into Lake Okabena. The amount of fish produced in a year in these ponds has not been quantified, but it is likely that this operation provides some baseline benefit to fish populations in Lake Okabena. A population assessment was conducted during the week of August 13, 2018 to monitor fish populations using three gill nets and 11 trap nets.   <br> \n <br> \nWALLEYE <br> \nForty one Walleye were caught in gill nets and trap nets in 2018.  The gill net catch rate was 10 per net and the trap net catch was 1 per net.  The 2018 gill net catch rate was below the long-term catch rate of 18.5 per gill net.  However, the long-term catch rate for Okabena Lake is above the expected range observed for similar lakes (3.2 to 15.3 per gill net) indicating high abundance of Walleye are usually observed.  Okabena Lake is one of a few lakes in the Windom Fisheries Management area of southwest Minnesota that has natural reproduction of Walleye.  Five ages of Walleye were present in 2018 sampling with fish from 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, and 2017.  Two of the 5 years classes (2014 and 2017) were not from fry stocked years so they are assumed natural.  This was 10 of 25 aged fish, or 40% natural reproduction.  Since 2008, the catch rate of Walleye has declined in the gill net sample from 23.3 per gill net to 10 in 2018.  During that same time prey species, Yellow Perch and Black Bullhead, relative abundance has declined as well.  Additionally, competition with Channel Catfish and Freshwater Drum is increasing due to the increasing relative abundance of those species.  Regardless, the gill net and trap net catch rates in 2018 are still within the expected range for similar lakes (3.2 to 15.3 per gill net and 0.3 to 1.7 pet trap net).  Walleye in the netting sample ranged in length from 8 to 18 inches with an average length of 14 inches in gill nets and nearly 11 inches in trap nets.  While many of the Walleye were too small for anglers to harvest the population is indicating a balanced size distribution.  In addition to a balanced size distribution, the Walleye in the sample were in average health showing they are finding adequate food.  Larger Walleye appeared healthier than smaller Walleye indicating that there may have been a limitation of food for smaller Walleye.  Overall, with 17 species of fish to compete and interact with in Okabena Lake, the Walleye population is doing relatively well.  The future is bright for the Walleye in Okabena as the 2018 sample of newly hatched Walleye indicated that LMS fish were most abundant, followed by naturally reproduced fish and finally by MIS fish.  There is hope that the LMS Walleye will flourish in Okabena Lake and potentially create a self-sustaining population in the long-term, and an increased abundance of Walleye for anglers in the short-term.  For now, there are harvestable sized Walleye over 14 inches in Okabena Lake and those fish should become more abundant over the next several years.         <br> \n      <br> \nCRAPPIES <br> \nBlack and White Crappie are present in Okabena Lake.  Black Crappie are more abundant than White Crappie.  Both species have historically sporadic abundances.  The average trap net catch rate for Black Crappie over that time is 15 per net and the average for White Crappie is 7.5 per trap net.  In 2018, the trap net catch rate for Black Crappie was 8 per net, less than average, but within the expected range for similar lakes (1.0 to 12.3 per trap net).  The White Crappie trap net catch rate was 7.5 per trap net, which is similar to the long-term catch rate, and still within the expected range for similar lakes (0.5 to 15.9 per trap net).  Size of Black and White Crappies ranged from 4 to 10 inches in the gill net and trap net sample with an average length of 7 inches for Black Crappie in trap nets and an average length of 7.5 inches for White Crappie in trap nets.  The populations are currently dominated by smaller fish, but the fish in the sample appeared very healthy and plump.  Okabena Lake will be an excellent place to fish crappies over the next several years as the small fish in the sample mature to larger sizes.   <br> \n <br> \nBLUEGILL <br> \nBluegill abundance has been low in Okabena Lake with trap net catch rates less than expected since 1982.  In 2018 the trap net catch rate was only 1.5 per net, which surprisingly is an increase since 2014, but a decrease compared to the past 20 years.  Habitat degradation, including a loss of aquatic vegetation, has most likely resulted in less Bluegill present in Okabena Lake.  However, the fish that are present are decent size with an average length of 7 inches in trap nets (range= nearly 3.5 to just over 8.5 inches).  The outlook for Bluegill in Okabena Lake is not great.  Okabena Lake is better suited for Walleye due to cloudy water and a mostly sand and gravel bottom.  Bluegill will need to be maintained through stocking.  In partnership with the southwest Minnesota Sportsman's Club, the Windom Fisheries Office is stocking adult Bluegill in 2 drainable rearing ponds to help boost the lake population.  This partnership will continue annually in order to maintain Bluegill presence in Okabena Lake.       <br> \n <br> \nYELLOW PERCH <br> \nYellow Perch abundance has declined since 2006.  The 2006 gill net catch rate was 116.7 per net.  The following survey in 2008 had a drastic reduction to 43.3 per gill net, followed by 24.7 per gill net in 2010, 23.0 per gill net in 2014, and finally to the most recent catch rate of 7.7 per gill net in August of 2018.  However, over that time Channel Catfish have been very abundant in the gill net catch which makes catching other fish very difficult due to tangling of the gill net.  Regardless, there is still a decline which does indicate that there is some reduction in numbers of Yellow Perch.  The average length of Yellow Perch in the gill net sample was nearly 9.5 inches (range = 5.7 to 11.2 inches) with no Yellow Perch caught in trap nets.  The Yellow Perch appear to be finding adequate forage.  Reproduction of Yellow Perch has been limited in recent years as determined by a lack of small fish (<5 inches) in the sample. With that said, reproduction of Yellow Perch was observed in 2018 and should contribute to the population if they survive to catchable size.     <br> \n  <br> \nNORTHERN PIKE <br> \nNorthern Pike are a not a management species in Okabena Lake, but they do exist in low numbers and have been stocked in the past to maintain the population.  In 2018, the gill net catch rate was 0.3 per gill net, or 1 fish captured.  The single Northern Pike was 18.7 inches.  Historically, the Northern Pike relative abundance in the gill nets has been near 1 or below since sampling began in 1982.  Continued restocking of Northern Pike will be needed to maintain the population.  The new 24 inch minimum size limit along with a daily and possession limit of 2 should also help to increase Northern Pike by protecting small fish due to their easy catchability.  The potential increase should help by adding a top predator to the lake, which should put some pressure on the rough fish species in the lake.      <br> \n <br> \nOTHER SPECIES <br> \nBigmouth Buffalo, Black Bullhead, Channel Catfish, Common Carp, Freshwater Drum, Golden Shiner, Hybrid Sunfish, Orangespotted Sunfish, Pumpkinseed, White Sucker, and Yellow Bullhead were also sampled in the gill nets and trap nets.  Bigmouth Buffalo (2 per gill net), Common Carp (1 per gill net), Channel Catfish (12.7 per gill net), and Freshwater Drum (13 per gill net) were the most numerous of the above species, and they made up 13%, 8%, 54%, and 11% of the gill net catch by weight.  Only Walleye (8%) approached any of those numbers in terms of percent weight in the gill nets.  All other species were less than 3% of the weight.  Okabena Lake is currently a Walleye Lake with numerous undesirable species.  However, there is some indication that relative abundances of Bigmouth Buffalo and Common Carp are reduced from early 2000's levels and 2014 when they were high.  More monitoring will be conducted in 2022 to assess the fish community.    <br> \n   <br> \nPrepared by Nate Hodgins  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Okabena lake covers 785 acres and has a shoreline length of 5 miles.  The lake is located within Worthington city limits, and the majority of the surrounding shoreline is developed.  Nearshore areas are dominated by sand and rubble, and aquatic vegetation is limited.  Considerable interest exists in improving water quality and fish habitat in Okabena Lake.  In 1992, a Clean Water Partnership was formed by the Okabena-Ocheda Watershed District, MNPCA, and the city of Worthington.  In conjunction with the Southwest Minnesota Fishing Club, trees were installed in a shoalwater area in the winter of 1992-93 to provide fish habitat.  Okabena Lake is primarily managed for walleye and channel catfish while providing secondary populations of black crappie and white crappie.  Walleye numbers appear to have increased since our 1994 survey and are considered high compared to similar lakes in our area.  Walleye sampled in gillnets ranged in length from 10 to more than 21 inches with an average length of 14 inches.  The population is comprised of many length classes with a fair number of fish reaching more than 16 inches.  Data suggest the walleye population is supported through a combination of natural reproduction and stocking.  Walleye fry were stocked in 1991, 1994, and 1995. Channel catfish were initially stocked in Okabena Lake in 1949.  Currently, the lake supports good numbers of large channel catfish.  Lengths of catfish sampled in gillnets ranged from 16 ? to more than 27 inches with an average length of 22 inches.  Data suggest the channel catfish population is also supported through a combination of natural reproduction and stocking.  Channel catfish fingerlings were stocked in 1994.Black crappie numbers appear to have increased since 1994 and are currently considered high.  Black crappie collected in trapnets ranged in length from 3 to more than 10 inches with an average of  length of approximately 8 inches.  The population has good numbers of quality sized fish (greater than 8 inches).  Data suggest the black crappie population is healthy and self-supporting.White crappie numbers are considered normal compared to similar lakes in our area.  White crappie sampled in trapnets ranged in length from 2 ? inches to almost 10 inches with an average of approximately 6 inches.  The population has good numbers of fish in the 8-9 inch range.  The white crappie population also is healthy and self-supporting. Largemouth bass were assessed with electrofishing gear in the spring of 1996.  The majority of bass were collected in Sunset Bay which has good cover and suitable spawning habitat.  Bass ranged in length from 9 ? inches to more than 18 inches with an average length of approximately 14 inches.  Bass fingerlings were reared by Southwest Minnesota Fishing Club members and were subsequently stocked in 1994, 1995, and 1996.  Data suggest the bass population is supported by natural reproduction and stocking. Yellow perch numbers appear to have increased since 1994 and are currently considered high.  Perch sampled in gillnets ranged in length from 5 ? inches to 11 inches with an average length of more than 8 ? inches.  The population is comprised of larger fish with a fair number of fish reaching prefered size (greater than 10 inches).  Data suggest yellow perch are healthy and self-supporting.Bluegill and pumpkinseed numbers appear to have increased since our 1994 survey.  Currently, bluegill numbers are considered normal, whereas pumpkinseed numbers are considered high.  The average length of bluegill was approximately 6 ? inches and the average length of pumpkinseed was approximately 6 inches.  Both species appear healthy and self-supporting.Black bullhead numbers remain low compared to similar lakes in our area.  Black bullhead sampled in trapnets ranged in length from 8 to 11 inches with an average length of approximately 10 inches.  Other species observed during the 1996 survey include northern pike, hybrid sunfish, yellow bullhead, white sucker, carp, bigmouth buffalo, golden shiner, and fathead minnow.To promote and maintain a healthy fish population, pollution and other inputs need to be controlled.  Fish habitat is directly affected by water quality.  Nutrient, sediment and other waste inputs can drastically alter the chemical and physical components of a Lake.  It is paramount to maintain if not improve the current water quality of Okabena Lake through watershed management to preserve this fishery for future generations to enjoy.   </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>INTRODUCTION <br> \nLake Okabena is a 751-acre lake located within the City of Worthington in Nobles County. Lake Okabena has a watershed to lake ratio of 19:1, meaning it receives drainage from over 14,000 acres of agricultural row crops and impervious surfaces from part of the City of Worthington. Lake Okabena has a mean depth of 8.0 feet and a maximum depth of 16.0 feet, which, until 1985, was maintained by dredging. Residential development has disturbed and altered some of Lake Okabena's shoreline; however, the majority of its shoreline is owned by the City of Worthington, which allows ample opportunity for shoreline anglers. In areas with residential development, lawns are typically maintained to the water's edge and shorelines are altered with rock riprap, thereby disrupting the natural riparian buffer. Excessive nutrient runoff from lawns, impervious services, and agricultural fields likely contribute to Lake Okabena's turbid water (Secchi depth = 0.9 feet). The primary management species in Lake Okabena are walleye and channel catfish, and the secondary management species are black crappie, white crappie, bluegill, and yellow perch. Walleye fry have been stocked at a rate of 1,000 per littoral acre two out of three years since 2006 (2006, 2007, 2009, 2010, 2012, 2013, and 2015). In cooperation with the Southwest Minnesota Fishing Club, pre-spawn bluegill, largemouth bass, northern pike, or black crappie are stocked annually into drainable wetlands (Worthington Pond 1 and Worthington Pond 2) that are connected to Lake Okabena via Whiskey Ditch. Water is retained in the ponds until early October, which allows the young-of-the-year (YOY) fish to grow to a size conducive for survival, and then is drained into Whiskey Ditch and eventually into Lake Okabena. The amount of fish produced in a year in these ponds has not been quantified, but it is likely that this operation provides some benefit to fish populations in Lake Okabena. A population assessment was conducted during the week of August 18, 2014 to monitor fish populations using three gill nets and 12 trap nets.   <br> \n <br> \nWALLEYE <br> \nWalleye were captured at a rate of 12.3 per gill net in 2014, which is within the long term range of catch rates observed in Lake Okabena (4.3 per gill net in 1986 to 36.5 per gill net in 1982) and is within the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (3.2 to 15.3 per gill net). The trap net catch rate in 2014 was 3.6 per trap net, which is greater than the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (0.3 to 1.7 per trap net). Since 2006, walleye fry have been stocked at a rate of 1,000 fry per littoral acre, two out of three years. This strategy has produced catch rates that have been well above the upper quartile of catch rates in 2006 (34.0 per gill net) and 2008 (23.3 per gill net), and just below the upper quartile of catch rates in 2010 (14.7 per gill net) and 2014 (12.3 per gill net), indicating that this stocking strategy has been very successful at maintaining an abundant walleye population. A population abundance model was used to estimate the 2014 population size for Lake Okabena based on gill net catches of walleye. The model estimated that there are potentially 27,211 walleyes in Lake Okabena. Walleyes captured in gill nets ranged from 8.0 to 22.4 inches in length and averaged 13.0 inches. Trap netted walleyes ranged in length from 7.4 to 28.4 inches and averaged 11.0 inches. Eight year classes of walleye were sampled (2003, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, and 2013) including some years that do not correspond to stocking events. This indicates that some natural reproduction may be occurring, albeit limited. Age classes that do not correspond to stocking events include age-3 (2011) and age-6 (2008). The 2013 year class (age-1) was the most abundant and was a major component of the walleye population in Lake Okabena. Growth of walleye has improved since the last survey done in 2010 lengths at age increased from 10.0 inches at age-2 and 12.0 inches at age-3 in 2010 to 12.0 inches at age-2 and 14.1 inches at age-3 in 2014. Increased growth could be the result of higher prey availability, particularly freshwater drum (23.0 per gill net), which are relatively new to this system (first captured in 2010), and bigmouth buffalo (22.7 per gill net and 11.5 per trap net), which prior to the 2014 survey, had occurred in low abundance in Lake Okabena (less than 1.0 per gill net and 0.3 per trap net). Yellow perch are also one of the major prey items for walleye; however, the increase in walleye growth rates is likely not connected to yellow perch, as the 2014 yellow perch catch rate of 23.0 per gill net remained about the same as the 2010 yellow perch catch rate of 24.7 per gill net, as did their size structure. Despite increased growth rates, walleyes were skinny. A strong 2013 year class should provide some good walleye angling within the next couple of years when they reach a size desirable to anglers.  <br> \n <br> \nCHANNEL CATFISH <br> \nThe channel catfish catch rates have been highly variable in Lake Okabena, ranging from 0.5 per gill net in 2004 to 106.3 per gill net in 1986. In 2014, channel catfish were captured at a rate of 20.0 per gill net; down from the 2010 catch rate of 43.0 per gill net, but slightly higher than the long term average of 18.9 per gill net. Channel catfish ranged in length from 16.1 to 23.2 inches and averaged 20.2 inches. Three year classes of channel catfish were sampled including 2004, 2005, and 2006. Fifty-seven percent of the catfish sampled were age-10, which corresponds to the most recent stocking in 2004. The presence of the 2005 (40 percent of the sample) and 2006 (35 percent of the sample) year classes indicate that some natural reproduction by channel catfish occurs in Lake Okabena, and may be enough to sustain the population. Channel catfish are managed in Lake Okabena to control the black bullhead population. When channel catfish abundance is low, black bullhead abundance tends to be higher, and vice versa. Channel catfish catch rates have been high in the last three surveys 30.7, 43.0, and 20.0 per gill net in 2008, 2010, and 2014, respectively. Consequently, black bullhead gill net catch rates have been below 2.0 per gill net in those surveys. Lake Okabena's channel catfish population should provide a good fishing opportunity for years to come.   <br> \n <br> \nCRAPPIES <br> \nCharacteristic of crappie populations, black and white crappie catch rates in Lake Okabena have been highly variable with catch rates ranging from 0.9 per trap net in 1982 to 68.1 per trap net in 2002 for black crappies, and 0.1 per trap net in 2008 to 44.3 per trap net in 1982 for white crappies. The 2014 black crappie catch rate of 36.7 per trap net was the third highest catch rate since 1982 and was much higher than the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (1.0 to 12.3 per trap net). The 2014 white crappie catch rate of 1.0 per trap net was within the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (0.5 to 15.9 per trap net). The low abundance of white crappie in Lake Okabena may be a result of the high abundance of black crappie. The two species of crappie can coexist, but one of the species usually will occur at a lower abundance. Black crappie were small, with most of them (99 percent) being between 5.9 and 7.8 inches in length. Only two of the black crappie sampled were greater than 10 inches in length. White crappie were also small, ranging in length from 6.9 to 8.2 inches. Otoliths from three black crappies were aged and were estimated to be age-2 (2012 year class). The narrow range of lengths of black crappie indicates that most of them are likely from the same year class in 2012 (age-2). If growth of black crappie continues to be good, a highly abundant population should be available to anglers within the next couple of years.  <br> \n <br> \nBLUEGILL <br> \nThe 2014 bluegill catch rate was 0.4 per trap net, which is below the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (1.1 to 14.8 per trap net), and the lowest observed catch rate since 2004 (0.2 per trap net). Catch rates of bluegill in Lake Okabena have historically been highly variable (0.1 per trap net in 1990 to 12.7 per trap net in 2000), and have averaged 2.8 per trap net since 1982. Bluegills ranged in length from 6.8 to 8.0 inches and averaged 7.4 inches. A near shore survey done in 2010 captured nearly 5,000 YOY bluegills, suggesting that the bluegill population was on the upswing in Lake Okabena. It appears that while bluegills successfully reproduced in 2010, the YOY bluegills did not recruit to the population, as indicated by the poor catch rate in 2014. Recruitment of bluegills could be influenced by a number of factors including, but not limited to predation, survival through the winter, food availability, etc. The characteristics of Lake Okabena do not favor bluegills, as water quality is poor and aquatic vegetation is scarce. Bluegills tend to do well in lakes that have clear water and abundant vegetation. While the effort to enhance Lake Okabena's bluegill population by using connected ponds as bluegill rearing ponds is aesthetically pleasing, it appears that it is having little effect on the population.  <br> \n <br> \nYELLOW PERCH <br> \nHistorical catch rates of yellow perch have ranged from 9.7 per gill net in 1986 to 116.7 per gill net in 2006. In 2014, yellow perch were captured at a rate of 23.0 per gill net, similar to the 2010 catch rate of 24.7 per gill net, and slightly greater than the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (3.0 to 22.5 per gill net). Yellow perch ranged in length from 6.1 to 9.9 inches and averaged 7.6 inches. Lake Okabena's yellow perch provide a good forage base for walleye, but do not provide much of an angling opportunity for fishermen.  <br> \n <br> \nNORTHERN PIKE <br> \nAlthough not specifically managed for northern pike, Lake Okabena has maintained a low abundance pike population. The 2014 catch rate of northern pike was 1.3 per gill net, equal to the highest observed catch rate in Lake Okabena. Northern pike ranged in length from 17.6 to 25.0 inches and averaged 22.3 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nFRESHWATER DRUM <br> \nFreshwater drum are relatively new to Lake Okabena, as they were first sampled there in 2010 (N=1 in trap net). Since, the freshwater drum have taken off, and were captured at a rate of 23.0 per gill net in 2014, which is near the upper end of expected catch rates for similar lakes (24.2 per gill net). Two freshwater drum, 14.0 to 16.0 inches in length were captured, likely representing fish from the original introduction of this species. The rest of the sampled freshwater drum ranged from 9.0 to 10.5 inches (probably one year class), indicating that the original introduced fish successfully reproduced in Lake Okabena. Young-of-the-year freshwater drum can provide an additional prey resource for walleyes and other large predators when they are small; however, they can also compete with the more desirable species of fish (walleye, northern pike, yellow perch, black crappie, white crappie) for habitat and prey resources. Freshwater drum could have potentially entered Lake Okabena through the diversion prior to 2010. That diversion was closed in 2012 in an effort to prevent the movement of invasive carp.  The introduction may also have been unintentional via a bait bucket. To avoid unintended introductions, anglers should be diligent about disposing of unused bait in the trash, and should report unpermitted movement of fish. <br> \n <br> \nOTHER SPECIES <br> \nCommon carp were captured at a rate of 16.0 per trap net, which is the second highest catch rate of carp on Lake Okabena. The majority (94 percent) of common carp were between 10.0 and 15.0 inches, indicative of one strong year class accounting for most of the population.  <br> \nBigmouth buffalo abundance in 2014 was the highest recorded in survey history on Lake Okabena (22.7 per gill net, 11.5 per trap net). Bigmouth buffalo sampled in gill nets and trap nets ranged in length from 7.6 to 11.0 inches, likely representing a single year-class. <br> \n <br> \nBlack bullhead abundance continued to be low (1.3 per trap net), likely a result of predation by channel catfish. Other species of fish sampled included white sucker, golden shiner, and pumpkinseed. <br> \n <br> \nPlants in the water and at the water's edge provide habitat, prevent erosion, and absorb excess nutrients.  Shrubs, trees, and woody debris such as fallen trees or limbs provide good habitat both above and below the water and should be left in place.  By leaving a buffer strip of natural vegetation along the shoreline, property owners can reduce erosion, help maintain or improve water quality, and provide habitat and travel corridors for wildlife. <br> \n <br> \nBest management practices within the watershed (no-till farming, cover crops, buffer strips, targeted fertilizer application, reduced or metered tiling) would help reduce nutrients entering the lake. High nutrient and sediment input can cause algae blooms and reduce overall water quality. Any improvements in the watershed are likely to have positive impacts on the fishery. <br> \n <br> \nPrepared by Jonah Dagel <br> \n</p>",

TRAPNET CATCH INDICES FOR BLACK CRAPPIES ARE STILL ABOUT 30% BELOW THE STATE MEDIAN AND 75% BELOW THE LOCAL MEDIAN. GILL- NET CATCH INDICES FOR YELLOW PERCH ARE ABOVE THE STATE , MEDIAN BUT BELOW THE LOCAL MEDIAN. NET CATCH INDICES FOR CARP AND WHITE SUCKER ARE ABOVE BOTH STATE AND LOCAL MEDIANS. NET CATCH IN- DICES FOR BLACK BULLHEAD AND BLUEGILL ARE BELOW BOTH STATE AND LOCAL MEDIANS.

                "narrative": "<p>Okabena is a 751 acre lake located within the city of Worthington in Nobles County.  The lake has been dredged and has a maximum depth of 16 feet and a shoreline length of 5.0 miles.  Okabena Lake, because of it's location, is a very important lake in Southwestern Minnesota and has a reputation for it's good walleye fishing.  The lake is managed primarily for walleye and channel catfish while yellow perch, bluegill, and crappie are managed secondarily.  The present management plan calls for stocking walleye fry two of every three years.The 2004 lake survey showed that the walleye population is quite high compared to other similar lakes.  Lengths of fish caught in our nets ranged from 7.7 to 25.8 inches and averaged 15.5 inches.  The average weight of these fish was 1.7 pounds.  Seven different ages of fish were caught in our nets but the majority (about 67% of the fish) were one year old.  These fish should be available to harvest next year.The channel catfish population is down some from the early 1990's, however a good population still exists.  Lengths of channel catfish caught in our nets ranged from 20.5 to 26.7 inches and averaged 23.6 inches.  According to local anglers, interest in channel catfish fishing has increased since the early 90's.The yellow perch population is very high when compared to lakes like Okabena.  The lengths of yellow perch caught in our nets ranged from 5.6 to 9.7 inches and averaged 8.1 inches.  The majority of fish caught in our nets were in the 8 to 9 inch range.  Perch fishing looks good for the upcoming fishing seasons on Okabena.Numbers of bluegill appear to have decreased some since 2002.  Lengths of the bluegill caught in our nets ranged from 6.5 to 8.4 inches and averaged 7.4 inches.  A population still exists in the lake but it may be a little more difficult to catch the fish.The black crappie population also appears to have declined some since 2002.  The population would still be considered average when compared to other lakes like Okabena.  Lengths of black crappie caught in our nets ranged from 5.3 to 10.6 inches and averaged just under 8 inches.Shoreline seining results indicated natural reproduction of black crappie, channel catfish, white crappie, largemouth bass, and yellow perch.To promote and maintain healthy fish populations, pollution and other inputs need to be controlled.  Fish habitats are directly affected by water quality.  Nutrient, sediment and other waste inputs can drastically alter the biological, chemical, and physical components of a lake.  It is paramount to maintain if not improve the current water quality of Okabena Lake through watershed management to preserve this fishery for future generations to enjoy.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Okabena Lake is a 751 acre lake in the city of Worthington in Nobles County.   Okabena Lake has a history of Walleye reproduction and has some good spawning habitat.  This history and habitat led to the inclusion of Okabena Lake in a Walleye study.  Department of Natural Resource researchers are comparing the effectiveness of two genetic strains of Walleye.  Historically the Windom area had received \"northern strains\" of Walleye from northern Minnesota Walleye spawning runs.  This was a very cost effective way of stocking Walleye statewide. However, a \"southern strain\" of Walleye was identified as unique and Lake Sarah in Murray County is a source of this strain.  Lake Sarah has not been stocked since 1991 and has maintained excellent numbers of Walleye naturally.  An egg take has been conducted on Lake Sarah to raise these fish since 2015.  The two strains were stocked equally into Okabena Lake to test for differences in contribution to the catch.  Electrofishing for fall fingerling Walleye was used in September and October 2018.  Fin clips of each fish sampled was collected and sent for DNA analysis and determination of strain.   <br> \nFour 15 minute electrofishing stations were used during the night of September, 2018 to collect Walleye for DNA analysis.  Eighty Walleye fingerling were sampled in 60 minutes of sampling for a total catch rate of 80.0 per hour of electrofishing.  Walleye ranged in length from 5.7 to 7.6 inches with a mean length of 6.76 inches.  Additionally, 131 more Walleye fingerling were sampled to add to the total number of fish submitted for genetic analysis.  Genetic samples indicate that the distribution is 2 southern strain to every 1 northern strain or naturally reproduced fish or 141 southern strain fish and 70 northern strain or naturally reproduced fish.  This indicates that the southern LMS strain may have a competitive advantage in Okabena Lake and may be better suited to survive.  However, we need to continue examining the contribution of each strain until they are old enough to be caught by anglers.  This will be the better indication of successful stocking, when fish can be caught and utilized by anglers.  Okabena Lake stocking will be monitored in this way each year, and with samples from older fish in later years, until the study expires in 2023 when a final determination of which strain to use will be made.  The ultimate outcome should result in additional Walleye available to anglers, with an added benefit that Okabena Lake Walleye may become self-sustaining like Lake Sarah. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of nearshore and littoral fish species in Okabena Lake was conducted beginning on June 14th, 2021 by Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program Staff. Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot seine. Nearshore sampling captured 20 species of fish including one species that is intolerant of disturbance (Iowa Darter) and six that are tolerant of disturbance (Bigmouth Buffalo, Black Bullhead, Common Carp, Fathead Minnow, Green Sunfish, Orangespotted Sunfish). <br> \n <br> \nA concurrent summer trap net survey was conducted the week of June 14th, 2021 by IBI Program Staff. Nine trap nets were set along the shoreline and in shallow offshore locations that encompassed multiple habitat types. Bluegill and White Crappie comprised a majority of the trap net catch by number, while White Crappie and Channel Catfish comprised a majority of the trap net catch by biomass.  <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore and trap net data were combined with gill net data from an August 2018 survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based IBI (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment. In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g. Banded Killifish, Iowa Darter, and Smallmouth Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g. Green Sunfish, Fathead Minnows, and Common Carp). The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.  <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Little Sioux River Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Okabena Lake is primarily managed for walleye and channel catfish.  These populations have fluctuatedconsiderably over the last 12 years.  As of the summer of 1994, both populations were doing quite well.     The number of walleye in Okabena Lake would be considered slightly above normal for lakes similar to Okabena. The number of walleye collected in 1994 was higher than in 1992 but a little lower than in 1990.  Walleye growthwas good, having fish reaching 14 inches within three years.  Based on the age of walleye determined by readingscales, there appears to be pretty good natural reproduction.  Further investigations are needed to get a betterunderstanding of how often and how many walleye are produced naturally.     Walleye lengths ranged from 9.8 to 19.7 inches in 1994.  After reviewing the lengths of walleye collectedfrom our previous 5 surveys, it does not appear that Okabena Lake produces very many trophy walleye.  Accordingto our samples, very few walleyes ever make it beyond 20 inches.  Actually, there were not many walleye over 17inches in most of the surveys.  Harvest by anglers is most likely the cause for these smaller size structures ofthe Okabena Lake walleye population.  Reduced fish population size structure is often a characteristic offisheries located near population centers (Worthington) because of the fishing pressure the lake receives.     The number of channel catfish have been decreasing since 1986 when the population was extremely high. However, the size of the channel catfish has increased to the point where 3 to 5 pound fish are common.  Most ofthe channel catfish in Okabena Lake were aged as 12 and 10 year old fish.  The growth appears to be slow comparedto other channel catfish populations.  The slow growth is likely a result of the high density population that usedto exist, which would have resulted in competition for food.      Yellow perch numbers were above normal for lakes similar to Okabena Lake.  The yellow perch population wasdoing well, it had good growth, multiple year classes, and quite a few larger fish.  Yellow perch lengths rangedfrom 5.7 to 11.7 inches.  In addition, young-of-the-year yellow perch were sampled indicating successfulreproduction in 1994.      The black crappie and white crappie populations have both decreased since we last surveyed the lake in 1992. Fish populations experience highs and lows in abundance over a 10 to 15 year period.  Based on the number ofyoung-of-the-year crappies sampled during the 1994 survey, it is likely the population numbers will improve.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Okabena Lake, located within the town of Worthington in Nobles County,  is a 785 acre class 41 lake with a history of dredging.  Okabena is managed primarily for walleye and channel catfish and secondarily for bluegill, pumpkinseed, black and white crappie, and yellow perch.  Okabena Lake is on an every other year survey schedule due to the importance of this fishery as it receives considerable annual fishing pressure.  An open water and ice creel survey was conducted during 2001-02 year.  Eighty-four percent of anglers in boats were seeking walleyes and had catch rates of 0.3756 fish/hour.  Lengths of walleye harvested during the open water creel averaged 16.8 inches.  Bluegill were the second most sought after species.  Twenty-two percent of all anglers targeted bluegill or pumpkinseed, which made up 62% of all the fish harvested.  Walleye fishing dominated the angling activity during the winter of 2002.  A high walleye catch rate was likely due to the large numbers of walleye fingerlings caught during the winter, apparently from fry stocked in the spring of 2001.   Approximately 2,182 walleyes were caught and only 143 were harvested, indicating most were extremely small.A population assessment was conducted during the week of August 19, 2002 using 4 gillnets, 11 trapnets, and 3 standard seine hauls.  The catch rate of walleyes in gill nets was 31.00/set which was more than double the normal rate (15.33/set).  Total lengths of walleyes in gill nets averaged 15.7 inches.  Age 2 walleye averaged 15.1 inches which indicates walleye growth rates are at or above average compared to similar lakes in southwest Minnesota.  However, relative weights (which is an indication of how \"fat\" fish are) for all the length groups were not quite where we like to see them and may indicate some poor condition.  Overall, the walleye numbers are fabulous and should provide excellent walleye fishing now and through the next 4 years.According to our net catches, the channel catfish population might be somewhat down right now.  Only 3 channel catfish were captured in gill nets in the 2002 survey.  This was the least number of channel catfish ever captured in the 9 surveys done on Lake Okabena.  We have stocked around 44,000 channel catfish fingerlings in Lake Okabena over the last 9 years with limited returns to the survey nets.  We believe that these fish are likely in the system but are not captured using the standard gears.  If catfish are what you are seeking it may be worth your time to explore some other options such as the West Fork of the Des Moines River or Round Lake.As with walleye abundance, yellow perch numbers were nearly twice the normal range.  Total lengths of yellow perch captured averaged 6.8 inches.  Seine hauls failed to capture any Age 0 yellow perch which may indicate poor natural reproduction.  Growth rate of yellow perch captured was slower than average and their condition was below average.  There may be a down turn in the forage base in Okabena due to the large numbers of other panfish species (crappie, bluegill, and pumpkinseed).The bluegill catch rate in trap nets was above average but was much lower than the 2000 survey catch rate.  Total lengths of bluegill captured averaged 6.2 inches.  Seining data did not indicate any natural reproduction in 2001 or 2002.  Growth and condition of fish appears to be at or above average.  It is possible that the perch numbers are beginning to become more dominant as the bluegill numbers cycle downward, a trend observed in other area lakes.Black crappie abundance rebounded significantly since the 2000 survey.  Total lengths averaged 6.33 inches.  Age 1 black crappie made up 98% of the population.  Condition of black crappie was above average for all of the length groups, indicating healthy fish.  The white crappie catch rate was 2.09/set which was similar to the 2000 survey.Pumpkinseed abundance seemed to follow nearly the same trend as bluegill abundance.  The pumpkinseed catch rate was 2.09/set while the 2000 survey was 15.25/set.  Condition for both species was above average which indicated healthy fish at all length groups, most of which came from the 1999 and 2000 year classes.  Both bluegill and pumpkinseed have similar spawning and nursery requirements, needing submergent vegetation which is rare.  Angler harvest could impact the fishery as well, with twenty-two percent of all anglers targeting bluegill or pumpkinseed.  It is possible with the limited spawning and nursery habitat that a large percentage of pumpkinseed and bluegill were captured and harvested.Black bullhead abundance have been slightly higher than average (83.00/set) for the last 4-5 years.  The catch rate of black bullhead in gill nets was 75.50/set which was approximately the same for the 2000 (79.20/set) and 1998 (94.80/set) surveys.  Most of these fish were small and have little recreational value.  Most other lakes in the Windom area have abundant bullhead numbers if Okabena doesn't provide for you. It is always good to see a lake in the Windom area have a consistently low abundance of common carp.  It quite possible that without the large drop at the outlet of Lake Okabena, the common carp abundance would be much higher.A total of nineteen species of fish were captured during the survey of 2002.  Other species captured were bigmouth buffalo, largemouth bass, hybrid sunfish, white sucker, golden shiner, northern pike, and spottail shiner.To promote and maintain healthy fish populations, pollution and other inputs need to be controlled.  Fish habitats are directly affected by water quality.  Nutrient, sediment and other waste inputs can drastically alter the biological, chemical, and physical components of a lake.  It is paramount to maintain if not improve the current water quality of Lake Okabena through watershed management to preserve this fishery for future generations to enjoy.

                "narrative": "<p>Okabena Lake, in Nobles County, is a 751-acre lake located entirely within the city limits of Worthington.  Okabena receives over 14,000 acres of drainage from agricultural row cropping and has a watershed to lake ratio of 19 to 1.  Due mostly to historical dredging, Okabena has a maximum depth of about 14 feet and 6.5 miles of shoreline that is nearly all developed.  Much of the shoreline that is not in private ownership is owned by the City of Worthington and allows public access for fishing.  Walleye and channel catfish are the primary species of management along with bluegill, yellow perch, black and white crappie as secondary species of management.  A population assessment was conducted on Okabena during the week of August 25, 2008 using 3 gill nets and 10 trap nets. <br> \n <br> \nThe Okabena walleye population continues to provide one of the better fisheries in the Windom Area.  The walleye catch rate in gill nets was 23.3 fish/set, which is nearly twice the statewide normal range.  Over the years, DNR survey catch rates ranged from 11.2 to 34.0 fish/set.  Total lengths of walleyes in 2008 ranged from 8.2 to 25.6 inches and averaged 14.0 inches.  Growth appears to be average to above average as Age 2 fish at the time of capture had a mean length of 14.0 inches.  Although angling for walleye can be erratic on Okabena Lake, keeper walleye can be caught with some regularity.   <br> \n <br> \nThe channel catfish numbers are way up, with most of the fish in the 13-17 inch range.  Channel catfish have been stocked twice (2002 and 2004) with over 22,000 fingerlings and likely contributed to the high catch rate.  The channel catfish catch rate in gill nets in 2008 was an astounding 30.7 fish/set compared to the 8.7 fish/set in 2006.  Don\u0019t be surprised when you catch some channel catfish speed trolling for walleyes in the next few years. <br> \n <br> \nThe yellow perch catch rates peaked in 2006, but the catch rate in 2008 was still nearly twice the upper normal range.  Total lengths ranged from 5.7 to 9.8 inches and averaged 8.2 inches.  In the next couple years, some good keepers can be found in Okabena Lake. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch and bluegills abundance tend to be inversely related.  For example, bluegill and pumpkinseed were most abundant during the 2000 survey when there was a downward trend in the yellow perch abundance.  Both bluegill and pumpkinseed need aquatic vegetation in order to reproduce and thrive.  Okabena does not have much in the way of dense stands of aquatic vegetation and as a result tend to be limited in the reproductive capacity.  Although bluegill and pumpkinseed numbers have been higher historically, an occasional bluegill and pumpkinseed can be caught near the remaining weed edges.   <br> \n <br> \nBoth black and white crappie numbers have never been lower on Okabena Lake.  In the spring of 2008 an apparent significant die-off of white crappie occurred on Okabena Lake.  The fish that were collected and sent to the state pathology lab showed signs of bacterial gill disease.  Typically this outbreak does not catastrophically affect the entire fish population, but based on our sampling the white crappie population may have been significantly impacted.  Crappies have been known to spawn multiple times during the summer and I suspect their abundance will begin to increase even with the limited spawning stock. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled were bigmouth buffalo, black bullhead, common carp, golden shiner, largemouth bass, northern pike, and white sucker. <br> \n <br> \nEfforts to improve the health of the lake should focus on best management practices within the watershed.  Improvements and education in land stewardship will often have secondary benefits to the lake in the way of quality and quantity of habitat.  Generally, improvements in the quality and quantity of lake habitat will mean direct improvements of the fishery. <br> \n <br> \nPrepared by Ryan Doorenbos <br> \n       <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Okabena is a shallow prairie lake located within the city limits of Worthington.  The lake is managed for walleye and channel catfish as the primary species with black crappie, white crappie, and yellow perch as secondary species.According to local anglers, some of the best walleye fishing in the area occurred on Lake Okabena during the spring and summer of 1998.  During our August netting assessment, the walleye population continued to look good on Lake Okabena.  The management goal for walleye numbers on Lake Okabena was easily attained.  When compared to lakes similar to Lake Okabena, walleye numbers were better than 75% of other lakes.  Walleye ranged from 7.6 to 25.5 inches and averaged 14.8 inches.Walleye growth was quite good on Lake Okabena.  It took about three years for walleye to reach 15.0 inches.  Eight walleye year classes were identified by aging scales.  Two year old walleye represented 43% of the sample.  What is interesting is that these fish came from natural reproduction and we know that because walleye were not stocked in that year.  Natural reproduction has also been documented during shoreline seining and age analysis from early assessments.  Additional sampling will be needed to determine how often natural reproduction occurs, and the strength of those year classes.  At present, natural reproduction likely enhances the population during stocked years and reduces voids during blank years.  Due to the numbers and size of walleye in the population, fishing should be good for the next couple of years. However, as with any fishing, if the walleye have abundant prey to eat, it will make them more difficult to catch.Yellow perch populations often fluctuate from year to year.  Spring weather conditions, water levels, and the other species in the lake all effect the success of a given year class.  In 1998, yellow perch numbers had decreased substantially from 1996 but were similar to 1994.  Yellow perch ranged from 6.4 to 11.1 inches and averaged 8.6 inches.  After three years of growth, yellow perch averaged 8.8 inches.  Yellow perch fishing could be slow for the next few years.  Any increase in the available spawning habitat, such as vegetation and overhanging tree branches, should help to improve the yellow perch population.Channel catfish numbers per gill net have gradually declined from a high of 106.3 in 1986 to 1.0 in 1998.  The long range goal in the management plan is to catch six channel catfish per gill net.  Channel catfish fingerlings were stocked in the fall of 1994 and 1998.  Three trot lines (25 hooks) were also set with cut-bait for channel catfish.  We caught three channel catfish on the three trot lines.  If you like doing battle with big catfish, Lake Okabena may be the lake for you.  The three catfish we caught on trot lines ranged from 26 to 29 inches. Panfish numbers looked great on Lake Okabena in 1998.  Not only were there a lot of fish but there were many different species.  Black crappie, white crappie, bluegill, and pumpkinseed sunfish will all contribute to a fun and diverse fishing experience on Lake Okabena.  The only draw back to the current situation is that most of these panfish were still young, small fish.  It will take a year or two for the panfish to grow to a size that most anglers want to catch.Most shallow prairie lakes in southwestern Minnesota have black bullhead populations that vary from moderate to high.  Black bullhead numbers in Lake Okabena have been uncharacteristically low for the last 50 years.  In 1998, the DNR fisheries assessment nets found that the black bullhead population was anything but low.  Unfortunately, there is no way to know for sure what led to the sudden black bullhead population explosion.  It will be interesting to see if black bullhead remain at these high levels or if they will decline to the low levels of the past.  To promote and maintain healthy fish populations, pollution needs to be controlled.  Fish habitat is directly affected by water quality.  Nutrients, sediments and other waste can drastically alter the chemical and physical characteristics of a lake.  It is important to improve the water quality of Lake Okabena through watershed management.  People often associate water quality problems in a lake with agricultural or industrial practices within the watershed.  Although these can be areas of concern, lakeshore property owners also contribute to water quality problems.  Some examples include putting in sand beaches, removing trees, fertilizing lawns, and mowing their lawns down to the lakeshore.  Improved land use practices by everyone should insure that this fishery can be enjoyed by future generations. </p>",

Since 2018, Okabena Lake has been included in a research project that is evaluating the performance of two strains of Walleye, the Lower Mississippi Strain (LMS) and the Mississippi Strain (MIS).  However, during 2020, no stocking was done as no Walleye egg-take operations were conducted due to the start of the COVID pandemic causing a DNR close-contact work moratorium.  Walleye stocking, including the performance evaluation, was restarted in 2021. The total fry quota for Okabena Lake was 376,000, of which half were MIS and half were LMS.  The MIS Walleye come from northern Minnesota and until recently, were the primary strain stocked in Windom management area lakes.  The LMS originated in the Cannon River system, was stocked in area lakes in the 1980's and early 1990's, and has persisted in some area Walleye populations despite extensive stocking of northern Minnesota strains of Walleye.  LMS Walleye are present in Murray County's Lake Sarah, a lake that hasn't been stocked since 1991 because the Walleye population is sustained at high levels through natural reproduction.  Lake Okabena has areas of spawning habitat and has shown sporadic natural reproduction, thus LMS Walleye have been stocked because anecdotal evidence suggests that they may have a survival advantage and natural reproduction potential in southern Minnesota lakes.  To evaluate strain performance in 2021, 210 Walleye fingerlings were needed for testing and evaluation. Night electrofishing was used to collect the Walleye for the study.  Non-standard night electrofishing (less than 2 hours) was conducted on 28 September 2021. <br> \n <br> \nThe fingerling quota was not met with non-standard night electrofishing as only 155 fingerlings were captured during 1.3 hours of electrofishing (122 per hour).  Fingerlings ranged in length from 4.9 to 7.0 inches and averaged 5.8 inches.  The remainder of the quota (N=55) of Walleye fingerling were caught during the same night by resampling a stretch of shoreline that contained a large number of Walleye fingerling during the first pass (not included in the catch rate value above).   As with previous years genetic data, LMS made up a large percentage of the Age 0 Walleye catch.  Approximately 64% of the Age 0 Walleye came back as LMS, 14% came back as MIS, and surprisingly about 22% of the fish were from natural reproduction.  Of those naturally reproduced fish, about half of the genetics came back to LMS origin.  The remaining genetics of those naturally reproduced fish came back as Spicer strain and mix ancestry.       <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>INTRODUCTION <br> \n <br> \nLake Okabena is a 751-acre, class 41 lake located within the City of Worthington in Nobles County. Lake Okabena has a watershed-to-lake ratio of 19-to-1, meaning it receives drainage from over 14,000 acres of agricultural row crops and impervious surfaces from part of the City of Worthington. Lake Okabena has an average depth of 8 feet and a maximum depth of 16 feet, which, until 1985, was achieved and maintained by dredging. Residential development has disturbed and altered some of Lake Okabena's shoreline; however, the majority of its shoreline is owned by the City of Worthington, which allows ample opportunity for shoreline anglers. In areas with residential development, lawns are often maintained to the water's edge and shorelines are altered with rock riprap, disrupting what could be a natural riparian buffer. Excessive nutrient runoff from lawns, impervious services, and agricultural fields likely contribute a portion of Lake Okabena's turbid water (Secchi depth = 0.9 feet). Another source of poor water clarity is recycling of internal nutrients which leads to algae blooms.  Internal cycling can be caused by wind action and resuspension of sediment by bottom dwelling fish species, such as Common Carp, Bigmouth Buffalo, Black Bullhead, and Freshwater Drum.  Fish are managed in order to help bring balance to the fish community and help suppress species that may lead to internal loading of nutrients.  The primary management species in Lake Okabena is Walleye and the secondary management species are Yellow Perch, Largemouth Bass, Bluegill, and Crappie (Black Crappie and White Crappie). Walleye fry (Mississippi Strain, MIS) were stocked at a rate of 1,000 per littoral acre two out of three years from 2006 to 2016 (2006, 2007, 2009, 2010, 2012, 2013, 2015, and 2016).  However, in 2018 a different stocking regime started.  Walleye fry were stocked at a rate of 500 per littoral acre with 50% Lower Mississippi Strain (LMS) Walleye and 50% MIS Walleye in a strain comparison study (188,000 MIS and 188,000 LMS fry).  The LMS Walleye is a recently identified strain that originated from the Canon River and Mississippi River south of Minneapolis.  The egg source for the LMS Walleye is Lake Sarah where this strain was historically stocked and has since flourished without stocking since 1991.  The study concluded in 2022 and results will help to manage Walleye populations in southern Minnesota for decades.  For secondary species, in cooperation with the Southwest Minnesota Fishing Club, pre-spawn Yellow Perch, Bluegill, Largemouth Bass, Northern Pike, or Black Crappie are stocked annually into drainable wetlands (Worthington Pond 1 and Worthington Pond 2) that are connected to Lake Okabena via Whiskey Ditch. Water is retained in the ponds until early October, which allows the young-of-the-year (YOY) fish to grow to a size conducive for survival, and then is drained into Whiskey Ditch and eventually into Lake Okabena. The amount of fish produced in a year in these ponds has not been quantified, but it is likely that this operation provides some benefit to fish populations in some years in Lake Okabena. A population assessment was conducted during the week of August 15, 2022 to monitor fish populations using three gill nets and 12 trap nets.   <br> \nSixteen species of fish were sampled in gill nets and trap nets during the 2022 survey.  Bigmouth Buffalo were the most abundant by biomass (total pounds caught) at 22.5% of the catch, followed by Common Carp (17.7%), Walleye (16.9%), White Sucker (14.0%), Freshwater Drum (9.9%), Channel Catfish (7.0%), Northern Pike (6.2%), Black Bullhead (2.6%), and all others at 1% or less each (Black Crappie, Bluegill, Golden Shiner, Largemouth Bass, Pumpkinseed Sunfish, White Crappie, Yellow Bullhead, and Yellow Perch). The paragraphs that follow outline the status of each managed species as well as other gamefish that are important within the lake.  Interestingly, Walleye were the 3rd most abundant species by biomass, which is rare for a lake in southwest Minnesota.     <br> \n <br> \nWALLEYE <br> \n <br> \nOne-hundred and one Walleye were captured in gill nets (N=50) and trap nets (N=51).  Trap nets typically don't sample Walleye effectively during summer months and are deployed to target sunfish and other nearshore species.  However, 51 Walleye were sampled in 12 trap nets for a catch rate of 4.3 per trap net.  The 2022 trap net catch rate was the greatest on record since sampling began in 1982.  The gill net catch rate was also high with 16.7 per gill net, greater than the high end of the expected catch rate range for Lake Okabena (15.33 per gill net) and the most fish caught in gill nets since 2008.  Four age groups (age 1=2021, 3=2019, 5=2017, and 7=2015) of Walleye ranging in length from 10.5 inches to 24.5 inches, with an average length of just under 15 inches in the gill net, were sampled.  All but one age group (age 5, 2017) of Walleye were from years where stocking occurred.  While there is still need for stocking, naturally reproduced year classes are becoming more common. With the addition of LMS Walleye since 2018, there is now increased potential for that number to increase.  Recent genetic analysis from Lake Shetek and Round Lake, other class 41 lakes in southwest MN, suggest that natural reproduction is also increasing due at least in part to LMS stocking.  Currently, future LMS fry stocking will be needed to keep recruitment of Walleye stable in Lake Okabena.  With Walleye in excellent health, along with good numbers at harvestable size, the population is poised for excellent angling.  While we can't make the fish bite, low numbers of Yellow Perch (4.0 per gill net) should lead to a population of Walleye that may be more willing to chase a lure.  Angling should be good in Lake Okabena and angling success may increase as the population continues to trend in the direction it is going.     <br> \n       <br> \nYELLOW PERCH <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch are an important game fish for anglers, and they provide excellent forage for Walleye.  Unfortunately, Yellow Perch in Lake Okabena have been declining in relative abundance since 2006. In 2022 the gill net catch rate (4.0 per gill net) was the lowest observed since sampling began in 1982.  A declining Yellow Perch population can be an indication of a very abundant predator population, and can also be a sign of declining habitat available for successful spawning and for young to avoiding predation.  Yellow Perch ranged in length from 7.5 to just under 11 inches with an average length of 9.5 inches.  An absence of small Yellow Perch (less than 7 inches) indicates a probable failure in reproduction.  Periodic stocking of additional adults may be needed to boost the population.  However, if habitat is lacking for successful spawning, then stocking adults may not work and younger perch (fry) may need to be stocked in high numbers to create an abundant population. This approach is difficult due to the lack of spawning habitat and no hatchery program for Yellow Perch in Minnesota.  Fortunately, there are several ponds in the city of Worthington that are operated by a local sports club that are connected to Lake Okabena and can be fully drained into the lake.  These ponds can be utilized for fish production. In the past Bluegill, Largemouth Bass, and Northern Pike have been stocked and raised in these ponds. Adult fish are stocked pre-spawn and natural spawning occurs in the pond with good habitat available.  Young fish, and remaining adults, are then drained into Lake Okabena later in the summer or fall (depending on physical conditions in the ponds, i.e. water temperature and water levels).  These ponds will be utilized to raise Yellow Perch in 2023 and beyond in hopes that the population will receive a boost of younger individuals.   <br> \n    <br> \nCRAPPIES <br> \n <br> \nTwo species of Crappie are present in Lake Okabena, Black Crappie and White Crappie. Crappie species can be differentiated by the number of hard dorsal spines on their back.  White Crappie have 6 or fewer hard spines and Black Crappie have 7 or more hard spines.   Thirty-nine Crappie were caught (16 Black Crappie and 13 White Crappie) in trap nets only in 2022.  The Black Crappie and White Crappie catch rates are within normal catch rate ranges for each species, but less than past catch rates.  While relative abundance of both species of Crappie has declined, the size distribution of fish in the sample was still very good.  Crappie ranged in length from just over 3 inches to just over 12.5 inches with a mean length of 9 inches for Black Crappie and White Crappie.  While catch rates are low, angling for Crappie, especially during the spring spawning season could be very good in Okabena Lake.   <br> \n <br> \nBLUEGILL <br> \n <br> \nOnly 12 Bluegill were caught in trap nets only on Lake Okabena during 2022 sampling.  Bluegill ranged in length from just under 4 inches to nearly 7 inches with a mean length of 5.8 inches.  The relative abundance of Bluegill has remained stable in Lake Okabena since 2014. While stable, the catch rate is near the lower normal catch rate value, 1.1 per trap net, indicating a low abundance.  Habitat is not great for Bluegill in Lake Okabena with very little submerged aquatic vegetation to avoid predation.   <br> \n <br> \nNORTHERN PIKE <br> \n <br> \nThirteen Northern Pike were sampled in gill nets (Number=2) and trap nets (Number=11) in 2022 in Lake Okabena.  The fish in the sample ranged in length from 19.5 inches to 32.7 inches with only 3 less than the minimum length of 24 inches for harvest.  The relative abundance of Northern Pike in the trap net sample was the greatest observed since sampling began in 1982. While the catch rate is the greatest ever observed, the catch rate has never been very high on Lake Okabena.  Northern Pike are a low abundance predator in the lake and should continue to be managed as such to help control non-managed species such as Common Carp and Freshwater Drum.  Anglers could encounter more Northern Pike as a bycatch while they are targeting Walleye.  The 24 inch minimum length limit, with only 2 fish allowed to keep over that size, should help to protect some fish and allow them to continue to act as a biocontrol predator within the lake.  <br> \n <br> \nOTHER SPECIES <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled in 2022 were Bigmouth Buffalo (Number, N=30), Black Bullhead (N=17), Channel Catfish (N=13), Common Carp (N=22), Freshwater Drum (N=77), Golden Shiner (N=1), Largemouth Bass (N=1), Pumpkinseed (N=6), White Sucker (N=58), and Yellow Bullhead (N=1).   Of those species only Bigmouth Buffalo and Common Carp were more abundant, by biomass, than Walleye.  White Sucker, Channel Catfish, and Freshwater Drum also had abundances of 9.9% of biomass or more.  Common Carp and Bigmouth Buffalo have occasionally been removed by commercial angling.  A recent project on Lake Okabena by the Okabena-Ocheda Watershed District focused on getting an estimate of biomass of Common Carp.  Wenck Associates was contracted by the district to perform a Common Carp population estimate back in 2017 and 2018.  The results indicated Lake Okabena had about 312 pounds per acre.  Carp Solutions was contracted in 2022 to do a Common Carp population estimate.  After Carp Solutions removal of 676 Common Carp, Lake Okabena had only 61.4 pounds per acre and a far cry from 350 pounds per acre estimated in a previous study.  Additional watershed improvements, along with commercial harvest, should help to balance the fish community and lead to increased success of gamefish species.     <br> \n</p>",
