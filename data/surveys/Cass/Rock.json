THE VOLUME OF FLOW AT THE TIME OF THE SURVEY WAS UNUSUALLY LARGE BECAUSE OF AN EXTENDED RAINY PERIOD.ABOUT 80% OF THE SHOAL WATER SOILS CONSISTS OF MUCK, AND THE REMAINING 20% CONSISTS OF FIRM SAND.WILD RICE WAS FOUND TO BE ABUNDANT ALONG MOST OF THE SHORELINE, AND OTHER EMERGENT AQUATIC VEGETATION MODERATELY ABUNDANT IN THE SHALLOWS.  SUMBERGED AQUATIC VEGETATION WAS QUITE DENSE TO A DEPTH OF 9 FEET ALONG THE ENTIRE SHORELINE.SPAWNING CONDITIONS WERE EVALUATED GOOD FOR NORTHERN PIKE, LARGEMOUTH BASS, AND PANFISH AND WERE POOR TO FAIR FOR WALLEYE AND SMALLMOUTH BASS.TEST NETTING INDICATED THAT THE LAKE CONTAINED GOOD POPULATIONS OF BOWFIN, BULLHEADS, NORTHERN PIKE, AND SUNFISH; FAIR POPULATIONS OF WHITE SUCKERS, YELLOW PERCH, AND LARGEMOUTH BASS; POOR POPULATIONS OF WALLEYE, CRAPPIE AND ROCK BASS.  THE LENGTH FREQUENCY DISTRIBUTION TABLE SHOWS THAT A GOOD NUMBER OF LARGE SIZED SUNFISH WERE TAKEN IN THE TEST NETS.LOCAL RESIDENTS REPORTED THAT FISHING SUCCESS IN RECENT YEARS HAS BEEN FAIR FOR NORTHERN PIKE, LARGEMOUTH BASS AND SUNFISH.  POOR FOR WALLEYE AND CRAPPIES.THE PRESENCE OF GOOD NATURAL SPAWNING AREAS AND EVIDENCE OF GOOD NATURAL REPRODUCTION OF MOST OF THE GAME FISH SPECIES PRESENT, INDICATE THAT NO FISH MANAGEMENT IS NECESSARY AT THE PRESENT TIME.</p>",
