Submergentvegetation grows to a depth of 15 feet and is dense in most areas of the littoral zone.  Emergentvegetation is present around the entire shoreline.  There are also large expanses of floating-leafvegetation.  Fish management activities have been limited because of the lack of public access.Northern pike catches averaged 5.3 fish/gillnet which is within the normal range of mean catch ratesfrom lakes with similar chemical and physical characteristics (3.5 - 10.5 fish/gillnet).  Gillnetcatches averaged 7.5 fish/net in 1990 and 8.3 fish/net in 1985.  Mean weight of fish captured in 1995was 2.5 pounds.  Approximately 50% of the fish captured were 21 inches in length or greater, howeverno fish exceeded 28 inches in total length.  Bluegill catches averaged 4.8 fish/trapnet, compared to22.9 fish/net in 1990 and 13.8 fish/net in 1985.  The normal range of mean catch rates from similarlakes is 6.1 -46.6 fish/trapnet.  Mean weight of fish captured in 1995 was 0.2 pounds.  Eight of tenfish captured were 6 inches in length or greater.  One walleye, ten yellow perch, and one black crappiewere also captured in survey nets.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Little Osakis Lake is a small, lightly developed basin which is connected to Lake Osakis by a shallow, non-navigable stream.  There is no public access to Little Osakis Lake.  The Head of the Lakes Resort on Lake Osakis owns a boat ramp that can be used to access Little Osakis via a small channel under Highway 10.  However, only small boats can maneuver under this bridge.The lake supports an abundant and diverse aquatic plant community.  Most of the shoreline is fringed with emergent vegetation and submergent vegetation is dense in most shallow areas.  These plants provide spawning habitat and nursery areas for many gamefish.  Aquatic vegetation is also important for  protecting water quality and clarity.  Aquatic plants protect the shoreline from wave induced erosion, filter nutrient and sediment from surface water run off, and  compete with nuisance algae for the available nutrients in the water.  The fish community in Little Osakis is typical of a small, densely vegetated lake.  Northern pike and bluegill are relatively abundant, however  average size tends to be small. Northern pike average about 20 inches in length and two pounds in weight.  Most of the bluegill sampled were less than 6.5 inches in length.  Walleye are present in low numbers.  The lake has not been stocked with walleye because there is no public access.  Walleye, as well as other species, are able to move between Lake Osakis and Little Osakis.  Largemouth bass and black crappie were also captured in survey nets.  These species are likely important components of the fish community, however they are not effectively sampled with standard survey nets during summer months.   </p>",
