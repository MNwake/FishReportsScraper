                "narrative": "<p>Lake Seventeen is a small body of water at approximately 30 acres but has a large amount of deep water habitat and a maximum depth of 24 feet. There is an Isanti county park along the south and west shorelines. The park includes a fishing pier and limited shore fishing with the potential for carry-in access. All fish populations are self-sustaining and no stocking is conducted. A survey using trap nets to target the panfish population was conducted in May 2017.  <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie was the most abundant species of gamefish sampled. At 21 fish per net their abundance is above the third quartile for the lake class. Mean weight of 0.26 pound per fish was slightly higher than average for the lake class. Crappies were abundant in the previous survey but the average size appears to have increased. Average length of crappies in this survey was 7.3 inches with the largest fish measuring 13.3 inches. A wide range of sizes were sampled, likely indicating fairly consistent recruitment.  <br> \n <br> \nBluegill abundance was 16.6 fish per net which is within the interquartile range for the lake class. This catch rate was much higher than the previous surveys catch rate of 3.6 per net and average weight decreased to 0.11 lbs. Fish averaged 5.1 inches but several individuals over 8 inches were sampled. Only 12% of Bluegill were over 6 inches in length which may indicate that harvest is impacting the larger end of the population's size structure.  <br> \n <br> \nCatch rate for Yellow Perch increased substantially from 1.2 fish per net to 6.1. That puts their abundance far above the third quartile for the lake class. Mean weight also increased to .34 lbs. Mean length was 6.1 inches and the largest individual barely exceeded 9 inches but, considering the habitat these nets were placed in, the full potential of the fishery may not be represented by this survey. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike, while not accurately assessed by trap nets, were well represented with 1.4 fish caught per net. Average size was 21 inches with one individual exceeding 30 inches. Other species sampled included Bowfin, Pumpkinseed, and Black and Yellow bullhead. Bullhead were abundant, similar to the previous survey, with over 45 fish sampled per net and offer an alternative fishery. Largemouth Bass were not sampled in this survey but were present in the previous survey. They may still offer an angling opportunity as trap nets do not reliably sample them.  <br> \n <br> \n</p>",
