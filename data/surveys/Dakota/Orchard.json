                "narrative": "<p>The net catches from Orchard Lake, when compared to local net median values, indicate that high populations of white sucker, northern pike, yellow bullhead, green sunfish, and hybrid sunfish are present.  Normal sized (or average-sized) populations of yellow perch, black and brown bullhead, pumpkinseed, bluegill, black crappie, golden shiner, and walleye were found based on the same comparison.  A low population of carp exists.Based on net catches from the two gillnets set in the same locations in both 1976 and 1981, no statistically significant change in the population levels of yellow perch, walleye, or northern pike can be said to have occurred.  There is, in 1981, a wider range in yellow perch sizes  with smaller, presumably younger, fish making up the major part of the population.  This may indicate a reaction of the population to the winterkill of 1979-79 which was partial in nature.  As seen in the 1976 netting, the northern pike population is dominated by two young age classes (II and III annulus).  The III annulus fish are most abundant and are from a year class (1978) produced before the winterkill.  This and the presence of fair numbers of the 1977 year class indicates that the winterkill had little effect on the northern pike population.  Good growth was indicated at II, III, and IV annulus.  Walleye were aged as IV and V annulus.  This corresponds to no known stockings.  Rereading the scales did not change the results even with a second reader.  It is assumed that ages cannot be accurately determined from these scales, a not uncommon phenomenon with walleye.  Therefore, it is not possible to accurately determine the stocking date.Black bullhead appear to have increased, possibly in response to the partial winterkill.  More smaller fish were found in 1981 than in 1976.  Black bullhead numbers are still not alarmingly high and the average size is still quite large.  The catch of black bullhead in gillnets was higher than expected but not as high as in 1976.  Brown bullhead catches do not appear markedly changed from 1976 although more smaller fish are present.  Yellow bullhead appear to have increased since 1976.  Similar ranges and sizes were found in both years.  Yellow bullhead still appear to be dominant in the population which is as expected in a relatively clear lake.Green sunfish numbers reduced since 1976, as possibly do pumpkinseed.  The change from 167 bluegill per lift in 1976 to 18 per lift in 1981 indicates a real reduction occurred during that period, probably due to the partial winterkill.  Young fish are present indicating reproduction.  A higher percentage of bluegill over 7.0 inches was also present in 1981.  This is likely due to the effects of thinning the population from the winterkill and represents increased growth of fish present in 1978 before the winterkill.  This is further substantiated by many angler reports in 1979 and 1980 of larger than average sized bluegill being caught.  Without winterkill, the population is likely to change to one similar to 1976 in a few years.  Black crappie numbers have increased as shown by a decreased average size and an increased catch.  The black crappie population was probably not seriously harmed by the winterkill and partially expanded into the \"gap\" left by the drop in other panfish.</p>",

Bluegill and pumpkinseed sunfish were the most abundant species sampled and catch rates were at record highs for this lake. Bluegills averaged 5.2 inches with only 8.8% of all fish sampled measuring 6.0 inches or longer. Pumpkinseeds averaged slightly larger (5.6 inches) with 25.8% measuring 6.0 inches or longer. Black crappie were present within the normal range of abundance and averaged 8.2 inches in length (3.7 fish/pound). The electrofishing sample for largemouth bass indicated above average catch rates for abundance. The average largemouth bass sampled measured 11.8 inches and weighed 1.1 pounds. Approximately 21% of all largemouth bass sampled measured 16 inches or longer. The largest largemouth bass captured measured 19.3 inches in length and weighed 4.3 pounds.Northern pike were sampled above third quartile levels for abundance and size. Over 25% of all pike sampled measured 26.0 inches or longer, with the average fish being 24.1 inches and 3.3 pounds. One yearling hybrid muskellunge, stocked the previous fall, was captured during this assessment. Three 5-year old walleyes averaging 21.6 inches and 3.5 pounds were captured. These fish were from the 2,000 privately stocked fingerlings under DNR permit in 1996. DNR Fisheries stocked 170,000 walleye fry and 3,114 fingerlings in Orchard Lake during 2001. Yellow perch were sampled within normal ranges of abundance with the average size being 6.7 inches. Black and yellow bullheads were sampled in near equal abundance during this assessment.    </p>",

Bluegills averaged 5.36 inches with only 22.6% of all the fish sampled measuring 6 inches or larger. Pumpkinseeds averaged 5.45 inches and hybrid sunfish averaged 5.56 inches. Black crappie were sampled in average to above average numbers. Black crappies exceeding 13 inches were sampled. Largemouth bass are found in good abundance in the lake. Northern pike were sampled in average numbers. The average size sampled was 24.25 inches and 3.23 pounds. Walleye numbers are at their highest level since the 1971 survey, but many of these fish are from the same year class. The average size of walleye sampled was 20.6 inches and 3.24 pounds. Younger walleye from more recent fry stockings have not been sampled. Hybrid muskellunge were sampled at 1.0/gill net, which is the highest gill net cpue recorded for this lake. Lengths ranged from 23.19 to 32.17 inches. Yellow perch were sampled at normal levels but were small. The average size was only 7.5 inches in length. Brown and yellow bullhead were both sampled in higher than normal abundance, while black bullhead were sampled in average abundance.  <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

A survey targeting near shore fish species was conducted by IBI Program Staff on Orchard Lake on 3 August 2015 to assess populations of non-game species and small sport fish. Ten 100-foot sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake shore, sampling a variety of habitat types. Each site was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot 1/8th-inch mesh seine, depending on habitat condition.   <br> \n <br> \nDuring this assessment, five sites were sampled with a 50-foot seine and one station was sampled with a 15-foot seine. Site conditions prevented seining at four locations due to deep water, dense vegetation, or soft sediments. Backpack electrofishing was done on foot along the shoreline at six sites and electrofishing form the boat was conducted at four stations. Nearshore sampling captured 10 species of fish including one species intolerant of disturbance: Iowa Darter. Other species sampled during the nearshore effort included Black Bullhead, Black Crappie, Bluegill, Central Mudminnow, Golden Shiner, Green Sunfish, Largemouth Bass, Pumpkinseed, and Yellow Bullhead. Nearshore catches are used along with gillnet catch data from 18 - 20 June 2012 and trapnet catch data from 21 - 23 May 2012, to calculate a fish-based Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) score which is indicative of the health of Orchard Lake.  <br> \n <br> \nA review of potential stressors found watershed (61% disturbed land cover), riparian (a poor 2015 Score the Shore survey score: 63/100; approximately 10 residential docks per kilometer), and in-lake habitat characteristics at levels near those thought to impact the fish community.  Based on this information we also recommend that Orchard Lake be recognized as \"Vulnerable\" to future impairment with additional watershed and/or shoreline disturbance. <br> \n <br> \nThis survey is contributing to a watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency. Orchard Lake is located in the Lower Minnesota River Watershed. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Orchard Lake is a 235 acre (177 littoral acres), class 29 lake located in Lakeville in Dakota County. The lake is primarily managed for Hybrid (Tiger) Muskellunge and Largemouth Bass. Hybrid Muskellunge fingerlings are stocked at a rate of 2 fish per surface acre (468 fish) in even numbered years. Walleye were last stocked in 2015. An analysis of stocking effectiveness in 2017 determined that stocking was largely ineffective at providing a Walleye fishery and stocking plans were changed so that surplus Walleye fingerlings would be stocked at a rate of 1 pound/littoral acre when they are available. The lake was sampled with gill nets and trap nets in June while electrofishing targeting Largemouth Bass was conducted in May. The previous survey on this lake occurred in 2012.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye were sampled by gill nets at a rate of 0.5 fish per net. This is equal to the 25th percentile for the lake class and similar to historical catch rates for the lake. Both fish sampled were approximately 20 inches long and 8 years old. Walleye are not expected to be abundant in this system as stocking has not occurred since 2015. <br> \n <br> \nHybrid (Tiger) Muskellunge were sampled at a rate of 1.25 fish per gill net. This is the highest catch rate on record although it is questionable as to how accurately summer gill netting reflects Hybrid Muskellunge population metrics. Fish ranged in length from 26.9 to 37.4 inches with a mean of 30.8 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike were sampled at a rate of 5.8 fish per gill net, slightly below average for the lake class. Historical catches for this lake have varied widely but this rate is the lowest recorded and substantial lower than catches from the 2001 survey and earlier. Mean size exceeded the 75th percentile for the lake class with an average length of 22.7 inches. This is similar to historical average sizes surveyed. The largest fish sampled was 29 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch were sampled by gill nets at a rate of 2 fish per net. This is equal to the 25th percentile for the lake class and typical for the lake relative to historical catches. Sizes ranged from 5.8 to 6.4 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nTrap nets sampled Bluegill at a rate of 14.4 fish per net. This is substantially lower than the average for the lake class and historical surveys. Catch rates have been over 100 fish per net for every survey since 1991. Size was relatively small with a mean length of 4.6 inches and a maximum of 7.8 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie were sampled by trap nets at a rate of 1.1 fish per net. This is typical for the lake and lake class. Fish size was respectable with a mean length of 8.9 inches and fish up to 10.9 inches sampled. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass were sampled by electrofishing at a rate of 66.6 fish per hour. This is roughly half the catch rate of the previous survey and somewhat low relative to other historical catch rates. Mean size was the largest recorded with an average length of 12.4 inches. Fish up to 19 inches were sampled and 20 percent were longer than 15 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled were: Black Bullhead, Green Sunfish, Hybrid Sunfish, Pumpkinseed, and Yellow Bullhead.  <br> \n</p>",

The hybrid muskies sampled were taken from the 1989 year class.  Growth of the stocked fish was good.  Bluegill and crappie were typically small individuals, which is characteristic of high abundance.  Northern pike exhibited a wide range of sizes and growth was very good.</p>",

The northern pike aged were I to III annulus fish with III annulus fish being most abundant.  At I and II annuli growth was fast, and good at III annuli.  Green sunfish are very abundant being nearly 35 times higher than the median number.  Pumpkinseed are also quite high, all fish aged being II and III annulus fish showing fast growth.  II annulus fish are most abundant.  Bluegill are 14 times more abundant than the statewide median and consist of I to IV annulus fish, most being II and IV annulus.  Although high in numbers, fast growth was found for all ages.  Black crappie are only somewhat more abundant than the median.  Age groups with I to IV annuli were found; most abundant being II and III annulus.  Good growth was present throughout.  Walleye are present in numbers below the median and pounds per set above the median.  Fish aged resulted from fingerling stockings in 1971 and 1972 and showed good growth.  No fish from a 1973 fingerling stocking were present.  Golden shiner (taken in trapnets only) and yellow bullhead are above the median in numbers per set but below the median weight.  Yellow perch, black and brown bullhead and largemouth bass are each present in numbers and weight below the median.  All species of bullheads showed a length frequency distribution favoring the larger sizes.  Each species eas caught in gillnets in numbers higher than the median catch rate for that gear.</p>",

Less than 15% of the bluegill in the trap net sample were longer than 6\".  The walleye catch was reduced from 2006, with only 1 walleye sampled in 2012.   Three tiger muskie were sampled in 2012, all smaller than legal size.  Northern pike abundance remained average for this lake class.  The size of northern pike sampled ranged from 13\" to 29\".  The average size of NOP sampled was 22.5\".  Crappie were sampled in average numbers and were average sized in 2012.  Half the crappie sampled in 2012 exceeded 9\" in length.  Yellow perch were sampled in average numbers for this lake and for this lake class in 2012.  The size of perch sampled was small, ranging from 5?\" to 7?\"  long.  Yellow bullheads were sampled in low numbers, but were good sized.  The yellow bullheads sampled ranged from 9\" to 13\"long and had an average size of 11.3\"</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Orchard Lake is a fine largemouth bass - panfish lake of 250 acres with a maximum depth of 33 feet.  This lake was reported to have had a partial winterkill in 1952, which could not have been too serious.  In view of its physical nature there seems to be little likelihood of a serious fish kill occurring in the near future.  This lake is endowed with what appears to be ideal areas for northern pike spawning, one in the south side and one on the east side of the lake.  The exact ability of these areas could not be ascertained because of much stocking of this species in the lake.  However, the net ratio showed the northern pike to be present in satisfactory numbers.  The walleye pike was also found to be above the expected statewide numbers and directly traceable to the stocking.  The sunfish, both the bluegill and pumpkinseed, showed up in numbers higher than normal and had growth rates normal to these species.  The crappies, white and black, are present though of minor importance to this lake.  The three species of bullheads, having a tendency to be small, have enough individuals of large size to be considered as an appreciable portion in the fishermen's catch as well as to the lake.  The lack of the carp and any record of this fish for the lake is of special importance in this area where the carp is so common.  Generally, Orchard Lake has a fine fish population and adequate physical qualities, making it a fine largemouth bass - panfish lake.</p>",

Fish were small, with only a fifth over six inches in length and a maximum size of 6.7 inches.  Black crappie were present in low numbers with only one fish over 8.5 inches long.Northern pike were present in good numbers.  A tenth of the fish measured at least 25 inches in length and one measured 34.4 inches.  Two tiger muskellunge were captured, one below and one above the 40 inch mimimum legal size.Largemouth bass were sampled in low numbers in nets.  Electrofishing was used on this lake for the first time to obtain a better idea of the bass population present.  Twenty-seven fish were captured in one hour of fall electrofishing.  Over half of the fish were at least 12 inches in length, and over a tenth measured at least 16 inches long.One walleye was captured in a trapnet.  Two more, young-of-the-year from a private stocking in September 1996, were seen during electrofishing.  Yellow perch numbers were up from previous nettings, although still somewhat low for this type of lake.  All fish were less than 8 inches long.Black, brown, and yellow bullhead were present in low numbers, with most fish over 11 inches in length.  Two white sucker were sampled.  One carp was netted and two more seen during electrofishing.</p>",

Approximately 44% of Largemouth Bass sampled during this survey were greater than 12 inches in length, and 7% were greater than 16 inches.  Bass over 19 inches in length were sampled in both years. </p>",
