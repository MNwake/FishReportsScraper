Aquatic plants are sparse and grow to a depth of 4 ft; yellow waterlilies and pondweeds are the most common plants.Two brook trout, 12.6\" and 13.0\", were the only fish caught in the 1999 assessment.  The trout abundance by weight of 1.0 lb/gillnet was lower than the average catch of 3.4 lb/gillnet in previous trout assessments in this lake and was also lower than the median catch of 5.4 lb/gillnet in recent assessments of 25 stream trout lakes in the Ely Management Area.
