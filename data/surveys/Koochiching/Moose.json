Length in trap nets ranged from 3.3-10 inches and the mean was 7.2. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass is another popular choice on Moose Lake.  Due to the pandemic and staff storages, only angling was used to target Largemouth Bass. Three Largemouth Bass were captured, ranging in length from 10.04 to 16.73 inches.    <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike abundance has varied over time and stocking seemed to increase numbers temporarily.  The highest abundance was observed in 1988 (8.00 fish/set), which occurred after stocking events in 1984 and 1985.  However, by 2009, Northern Pike abundance was down to 0.50 fish/set.  Stocking occurred again in 2013 and 2015.  In 2021, the gill-net catch rate was 2.33 Northern Pike per net, below the expected number for this type of lake. However, Northern Pike in gill nets ranged from 20.87 to 31.30, with a mean of 25.10 inches. The mean weight was 3.65 pounds. So, while pike abundance is not high, the size of the fish is well above average. <br> \n <br> \nHistorically, Yellow Perch abundance has been variable in Moose Lake with a high of 33.00 fish/set and a low of 1.50 fish/set. In 2021, Yellow Perch abundance was within the expected range for this lake type.  However, sizes were small.  Yellow Perch in Moose Lake are more important as forage for predators rather than recreational fish for anglers. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Black crappie trap-net abundance was below the level typically observed in lakes of this type; however, the average size was above average and poised to get better as strong year classes continue to age.  Six year-classes were present and age ranged from 3-8 years.  The 2005 year-class represented 34% of the sample.  Length in trap nets ranged from 6.8-9.4 inches and the average was 8.2.  Average weight was 0.26 pounds, which was slightly above what is found in most lakes of this type.  Growth rate was slower than the area average. <br> \n <br> \nNight electrofishing was used to sample a total of 8 largemouth bass on one sampling night in late May.  Largemouth bass were captured at a rate of 11 fish per hour, which was similar to the previous investigation in 2002 (14 fish per hour).  Length ranged from 10.2 to 18.7 inches and the average was 16.1.  Average weight was 2.25 pounds.  Age ranged from 4 to 10 years.  Growth was the same as the area average. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike abundance has varied over time and stocking seemed to increase numbers temporarily.  The highest abundance was observed in 1988 (8.00 fish/net), which occurred after stocking events in 1984 and 1985.  However, by 2009, northern pike gill-net abundance was down to 0.50 fish/net.   <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch abundance in 2009 was twice as high as what is found in most lakes of this type.  Historically, yellow perch abundance has been variable in Moose Lake.  In 2009, only two year-classes were present and age ranged from 3-4 years.  The 2005 year-class represented 97% of the sample.  Length ranged from 6.0-7.0 inches.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Black Crappie is the species most often pursued on Moose Lake.  Abundance in 2016 was within the expected range for this lake type.  Many older (larger) fish were present in the sample.  The 2009 and 2010 year-classes represented 67% of the sample.  Length in trap nets ranged from 4.4-10.9 inches and the mean was 9.2.  Mean weight was 0.44 pounds, which was above the expected range for this lake type.   <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass is another popular choice on Moose Lake.  Night electrofishing was used to sample a total of 18 Largemouth Bass on one sampling night in late May, which was about double the rate observed in each of the two previous investigations.  So abundance appears to be up in Moose Lake.  Length ranged from 9.1 to 17.5 inches and the mean was 12.5.  Mean weight was 1.12 pounds.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike abundance has varied over time and stocking seemed to increase numbers temporarily.  The highest abundance was observed in 1988 (8.00 fish/set), which occurred after stocking events in 1984 and 1985.  However, by 2009, Northern Pike abundance was down to 0.50 fish/set.  Stocking occurred again in 2013 and 2015.  Abundance increased to 1.50 fish/set in 2016; however, it remained below the expected range for this lake type. <br> \n <br> \nHistorically, Yellow Perch abundance has been variable in Moose Lake with a high of 33.00 fish/set and a low of 1.50 fish/set. In 2016, Yellow Perch abundance was within the expected range for this lake type.  However, sizes were small.  Yellow Perch are likely more important as forage for predators rather than recreational fish for anglers.</p>",
