                "narrative": "<p>Little Waverly Lake is relatively shallow, with a mean depth 6.7 feet.  The lake is fed by the large Twelvemile Creek watershed, which impacts water quality. Algae blooms are common, and submerged plants are relatively sparse due to the low water clarity.  Fisheries surveys were completed for both Little Waverly and neighboring Waverly Lake in 2004.  Although Waverly Lake (mean depth 25.5 feet) is connected by a channel which allows fish passage, the fish communities of the two lakes are quite different.Walleye fry were stocked six times in Little Waverly Lake in the past twenty years.  Despite the success of fry stocking in Waverly Lake, catch rates of walleye have remained low.  In 2004, only one walleye was sampled in Little Waverly, down significantly from 1994.  Northern pike have been more abundant than walleye in Little Waverly Lake.  In 2004, the catch rate was relatively high for lakes similar to Little Waverly.  A similar catch was reported in 1994.  Northern pike were much larger in 2004 (4.0 pounds) than in 1994 (2.1 pounds); a similar increase in average size was seen on Waverly Lake.  Yellow perch were sampled in much lower numbers than in 1994, but still near the average for this type of lake.  Perch were small, with an average length of seven inches.Largemouth bass were sampled in spring by electrofishing, at a rate of 32.5/hr, which is less than the median for lakes in this part of the state (52/hr).  However, heavy algal blooms reduced visibility, and probably reduced the catch.  Although the catch rate was much lower than for Waverly (54/hr), the size of fish sampled was similar.  Two-thirds of the bass sampled were less than 12 inches, but a few larger individuals were sampled (up to 18.2 inches).The catch rate of black crappie in 2004 was lower than it was for previous surveys, but still within the expected range for this type of lake.  Average weight was 0.32 pounds, and most fish sampled were 8-9 inches.  The 2001 year class (age 3) made up 80 percent of the sample.  Bluegill did not appear to be as abundant in Little Waverly as Waverly, but still above average for lakes similar to Little Waverly.  Mean weight (0.26 pounds) was similar for the two lakes.  Most of the fish sampled were to be from a single year class (age 4).  Other species sampled during the survey included white sucker, bullhead, carp, bigmouth buffalo, and channel catfish.  Buffalo and catfish tend to be found in rivers, or in lakes connected to a river.</p>",

It has a surface area of 330 acres and a maximum depth of 12 feet. The watershed is large and dominated by agriculture. Twelve Mile Creek runs through the lake and connects to the North Fork of the Crow River; a small low head dam is located at the outlet. The lake was turbid and had an algae bloom in mid July and water clarity was only 2.0 feet.  Because the lake is shallow and nutrient rich, a winter aeration system is often used to prevent winterkill. The lake is primarily managed for Northern Pike and Largemouth Bass and the last lake survey was conducted in 2004. <br> \n <br> \nAquatic vegetation was sparse and shallow due to poor water clarity. Cattail species were the only emergent plants found along shore and only in two stands. Submerged plants were not surveyed in 2014, but the dominant species in 2004 were coontail, sago pondweed, and Eurasian watermilfoil. Eurasian watermilfoil was first found in the lake in 1993 and was observed during the 2014 lake survey.  <br> \n <br> \nThe Northern Pike catch in 2014 was lower than in 2004, but within the range of expected values for lakes similar to Little Waverly. Lengths ranged from 20.9 to 28.7 inches with an average length and weight of 24.2 inches and 3.0 pounds. Forty eight percent of pike sampled were longer than 24 inches. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass were sampled by daytime electrofishing in late May. The catch rate (81/hour) was much higher than the Montrose average (43/hour) and higher than 2004 (33/hour, nighttime). Lengths ranged from 8.7 to 19.5 inches with an average length of 15.0 inches. Among catchable size fish (>8 inches), 55% were longer than 15 inches. It is worth noting that fish were larger in 2014 than in 2004, despite a much higher catch rate. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye fry were stocked in Little Waverly in the past with little success. The Walleye catch was low in 2014, but higher than in 2004. Walleye lengths ranged from 11.9 to 22.0 inches, with a mean length and weight of 17.7 inches and 2.2 pounds. A culvert and short channel connect Little Waverly and Waverly lakes; Waverly Lake is stocked with Walleye fingerlings which likely emigrate to Little Waverly.  <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie numbers in gill nets were similar to 2004 results and above the expected range of values for similar lakes. However, trap net catches were low and have been highly variable in the past. Lengths ranged from 4.2 to 11.5 inches with an average length and weight of 7.7 inches and 0.4 pounds. The Bluegill catch was the lowest recorded and below the expected range of values for similar lakes. Bluegill lengths ranged between 6.0 and 8.3 inches with an average length and weight of 6.8 inches and 0.3 pounds.  <br> \n <br> \nOnly eight Yellow Perch were caught, much less than in 2004 and all previous surveys. It is unclear why so few perch and Bluegill were caught. Northern Pike prey readily on Yellow Perch, but pike numbers were not high. Largemouth Bass were abundant and could suppress Bluegill numbers, but bass typically do not prey heavily on perch. <br> \n <br> \nA total of 12 Channel Catfish were caught in 2014, compared to only one in 2004 and none in previous surveys. Channel Catfish were relatively large; lengths ranged from 15.5 to 30.3 inches with an average length of 22.1 inches. Channel Catfish are abundant in the Crow River and have immigrated into Little Waverly, Waverly, and other connected lakes in recent years.  <br> \n <br> \nOther species caught in the survey included: Bigmouth Buffalo, Black Bullhead, Bluntnose Minnow, Brown Bullhead, Bowfin (Dogfish), Central Mudminnow, Common Carp, Fathead Minnow, Golden Shiner, Green Sunfish, Hybrid Sunfish, Johnny Darter, Pumpkinseed, Spottail Shiner, White Sucker, and Yellow Bullhead. <br> \n</p>",

Twenty-five Northern Pike were caught in 1984. Yellow Perch were caught at a rate of 13.7/gill net and the average length was 6.0-6.4 inches. Important species caught in trap nets were Bluegill, Black Crappie, Black Bullhead and Common Carp. Bluegill were caught at a rate of 60.8/trap net, a significant increase from 1984 and twice the local average. Bluegill ranged in length from 4 to 8 inches and the average length was 5.5-5.9 inches. Black Crappie abundance has declined from 1984. Fish ranged from 5.0 to 9.6 inches and the average length was 7.0-7.4 inches. Black Bullhead abundance was similar to 1984 and the average length group was 5.5-5.9 inches. Common Carp were abundant, although the catch was comprised of mostly 3.5-3.9 inch fish.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>The catch rate of Northern Pike in gill nets significantly increased from the 1989 fish assessment and rose above expected levels for lakes similar to Little Waverly.  Northern Pike ranged in length from 13.1-30.4 inches and averaged 20.9 inches.  The average weight of pike (2.1 pounds) also appeared to increase from the 1989 assessment (1.0 pounds) but remained within expected levels for this lake type.  One to five year old Northern Pike were caught with three year old fish dominating the catch.  The growth rate of Northern Pike was average when compared to other populations in the state.     The gill net catch rate of Walleye significantly increased from the 1989 assessment but still remained below expected levels for this lake class.  Walleye average weight (1.7 pounds) increased from the 1989 assessment (0.3 pounds) and rose to within expected levels for this lake type.  Walleye are not stocked in Little Waverly Lake, but can gain access to the lake through the channel from Waverly Lake.  Walleye ranged in length from 10.4-21.9 inches and averaged 15.9 inches.  Walleye growth was average when compared with other populations in the state.     The catch rate of Yellow Perch in gill nets increased from the 1989 assessment and rose above expected levels for similar lakes.  Yellow Perch ranged in length from 4.5-10.3 inches and averaged 6.9 inches.  The average weight of Yellow Perch (0.1 pounds) was within expected levels for this lake type.  One to three year old fish were sampled, with one year old fish dominating the catch.  The growth rate of Yellow Perch was fast.     The Bluegill catch rate in trap nets appeared to decline from the 1989 fish assessment but remained above expected levels for this lake type.  Bluegill  mean weight (0.2 pounds) did not appear to change from the 1989 assessment and remained within expected levels.  Bluegill ranged in length from 4.3-9.5 inches and averaged 6.6 inches.  One to seven year old Bluegill were caught, with three and four year old fish being the most abundant year classes.  Bluegill growth was average.     The trap net catch of Black Crappie declined slightly from the 1989 assessment, but remained within expected levels for lakes similar to Little Waverly.  Black Crappie ranged in length from 4.3-9.7 inches and averaged 7.4 inches.  Two and three year old fish dominated the catch and Black Crappie growth was average.     The Largemouth Bass trap net catch rate increased from the 1989 assessment and rose to within expected levels for similar lakes.  Largemouth Bass ranged in length from 7.6-16.8 inches and averaged 11.5 inches.  One to seven year old fish were caught, with no dominant year class evident.  Largemouth Bass growth was average.     The trap net catch rate of Common Carp dropped from the 1989 assessment and fell to within expected levels.  From observations in the field, the Common Carp population does not appear to have significantly declined and abundance of Common Carp is likely still high in Little Waverly Lake.  Common Carp ranged in length from 19.3-26.2 inches and averaged 22.3 inches.  The average weight of Common Carp was 5.4 pounds, which was high for this lake type.</p>",
