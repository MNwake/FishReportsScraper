                "narrative": "<p>Lake Cowdry is a small (238 acre) lake located three miles west of Alexandria.  It is connected to lakes Lotttie, Stoney, and Union to the west by a navigable concrete culvert.  High water levels can limit the size of boat that is able to pass through the culvert.  Lake Cowdry is also connected to Lake Darling via the outlet on the north end of the lake.  There is a concrete sill at the outlet, which can limit boat traffic during low water levels.Water quality and clarity on Lake Cowdry is exceptional.  Seechi disk transparency usually exceeds ten feet during summer months.  This results in an abundant aquatic plant community.  Submergent vegetation is common in most shallow areas.  However, emergent vegetation like cattail and bulrush are limited.  Historical records suggest that a considerable amount of emergent vegetation has been lost over the past twenty years.  Aquatic vegetation is critical to the health of the fish community and is also important in maintaining good water quality.  Lake Cowdry has experienced accelerated residential development over the past decade.  Lakeshore residents need to use Best Management Practices around their homes and in their yards to minimize the impact of residential development on the lake.Lake Cowdry supports a stable fishery typical of small, densely vegetated lakes in west-central Minnesota.  The fish community is dominated by abundant, slow growing northern pike, largemouth bass, and bluegill.  All three species should provide ample angling opportunities, but average size of the fish is relatively small.  Walleye are present in limited numbers.  Gill net catches averaged 2.3 fish/net in 2003.  Gill net catches have not exceeded 3.0 fish/net in surveys dating back to 1979.  Walleye fingerling stocking in one of every three years was initiated in 1994, following the completion of the public access.  There is little evidence to suggest that recent fingerling stockings have been effective in increasing walleye abundance.  Stocking frequency and rate were both increased in 2002 as part of the Accelerated Walleye Program.         </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Although walleye have not been stocked since the mid 1960's, a small population has been maintained in the lake by immigration from other lakes and/ or by natural reproduction. Walleye growth rates appear to be quite fast. Back-calculated age 3 fish averaged 14.1 inches. Northern pike gillnet catch rates have increased from approximately 9.0 fish/net in 1975, 1979, and 1984, to 18.0 fish/net in the 1989 survey. Despite an apparent increase in relative abundance mean size increased slightly to 2.25 lbs/fish. Growth is relatively slow with age 4 fish averaging 21.9 inches. No yellow perch were captured in the gillnet and only one was observed in trapnet catches. Very few perch have been captured since the 1956 survey which resulted in a catch of 34.33 fish/gillnet. The tullibee population could provide forage for the larger predators. Bluegill catch rates decreased greatly from those recorded in previous assessments. While Lake Cowdry has traditionally had a large bluegill population, the trapnet catch rate averaged 14.75 fish/net. Mean size has remained small at .11 lb/fish. PSD was calculated at 23.0 percent. Growth is very slow with age 5 fish averaging only 4.4 inches in total length. Black crappie and largemouth bass populations were not adequately sampled. Bullhead species are large enough to provide angling opportunity and may have commercial value.</p>",

It is connected by a navigable culvert to lakes Lottie, Stoney, and Union to the west; and to Lake Darling to the north.  A concrete sill located at the outlet of Cowdry Lake can limit boat passage to Lake Darling during low water.  There has been a lot of residential development on Lake Cowdry in the past decade.  Given the small size of the lake, lakeshore residents need to use Best Management Practices around their homes and yards to minimize the impact of residential development on the lake. Water clarity on Lake Cowdry is exceptional.  Seechi disk transparency usually exceeds 10 feet.  This results in an abundant aquatic plant community.  Submergent vegetation is common in most shallow areas.  Emergent vegetation like cattail and bulrush are limited.  Historical records suggest that a considerable amount of emergent vegetation has been lost over the past twenty years.  Aquatic vegetation is vital to the health of the fish community and is important in maintaining the existing good water quality.  The fish community is dominated by abundant, but slow growing northern pike, largemouth bass, and bluegill.  All three species should provide plenty of action, yet average size of the fish is relatively small.  Walleye are considered a \"bonus\" fishery.  They are present in low to moderate numbers, but large fish are known to be taken.  Fingerling stocking in one of every three years was started in 1994 after the completion of the public access.    </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Cowdry is a 243-acre lake located approximately 3 miles west of Alexandria.  Maximum depth exceeds 50.0 feet.  Average depth is 25.0 feet.  Water quality proved to be very good at the time of the late-July survey.  Total phosphorus and chlorophyll-a concentrations, measures of system productivity, were below expectations for lakes located within the North Central Hardwood Forest ecoregion.  Water clarity is very good (17.0 feet) and improving.  Thermal stratification occurs in summer months and can influence gamefish habitat use and system stability.  For example, levels of dissolved oxygen were too low beyond 25.0 feet in depth in late July to sustain gamefishes. <br> \n <br> \nLakeshore development is heavy and comprised of year-round homes, seasonal cabins, and one resort.  Important fish habitats (e.g., emergent macrophytes, woody debris) are rare along the shoreline.  Lake Cowdry does support a diverse submergent plant community on gravel, sand, and marl bottom soils.  In response to excellent sunlight penetration, submerged plant growth has been documented at a depth of 16.0 feet.  The lake's habitat characteristics are well suited for sunfishes, largemouth bass, and northern pike. <br> \n <br> \nStandardized fish surveys are conducted on Lake Cowdry every five years.  Catch statistics from the 2013 survey continue to describe an abundant northern pike population.  Gillnet catches consistently approach 10.0 fish/net.  Most northern pike captured were small, averaging 20.6 inches and 2.0 pounds.  The largest pike sampled during the survey measured 31.7 inches. <br> \n <br> \nPanfishes such as bluegill sunfish, black crappie, and largemouth bass support an active and popular fishery.  Population abundance estimates have varied among past surveys in response to annual reproductive and recruitment inconsistencies.  Despite a decline in catch rate in 2013, largemouth bass remained moderately abundant.  Bass captured in 2013 averaged 13.6 inches in length.  Warm water temperatures in late-July drove bluegills and black crappie into deep, cool habitats resulting in lower trapnet catch rates in 2013.  Elevated catches in gillnets provided evidence that sunfishes remain moderately abundant in the system.  Bluegill collected in gillnets averaged 6.4 inches.  Two relatively strong year classes of black crappies were detected.  Length at capture varied from 5.4 to 11.1 inches. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye fingerlings, yearlings, and some adults are stocked to sustain a fishery.  A low gillnet catch rate of 2.7-fish/net describes a low density population.  Walleyes are not abundant, but they are long-lived and can grow to memorable sizes.  The largest sampled in 2013 measured 27.3 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nOther fishes captured during the 2013 survey included pumpkinseed sunfish; rock bass; hybrid sunfishes; yellow perch; brown, yellow, and black bullheads; bowfin; white suckers; shorthead redhorse; and common carp.  Tullibee were not captured in 2013.  Catch rates among surveys describe a gradual decline in tullibee population abundance.  Whether a response of climate change or other environmental stressors, Lake Cowdry may no longer provide necessary refuges (i.e., deep, cool, highly oxygenated habitats) for persistence of this coldwater fish species. <br> \n <br> \nNotes:  <br> \nLake Cowdry is part of the extended Alexandria Chain of Lakes due to its connection to Lake Darling.  Unlike the primary lakes comprising the Alexandria Chain, navigation between Lake Cowdry and Lake Darling is difficult and limited to small watercraft.  A state-owned public access is located on the southeast shoreline. <br> \n  <br> \nZebra mussels were found in Lake Cowdry in 2011.  Minnesota statutes require all equipment be free of invasive species prior to leaving any access.  Consult your current fishing regulations handbook for rules and regulations pertaining to the cleaning of equipment.  <br> \n     <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Cowdry is a 238-acre lake located about 3 miles west of Alexandria.  The lake is connected to lakes both upstream and downstream, but navigation is restricted to small boats.  Water clarity is usually quite good, with transparency readings  often greater than 10 feet.  Shallow water and shoreline areas contain diverse submerged plant communities growing in a mostly gravelly-sand substrate.  Lakeshore development is heavy and comprised of year-round homes, seasonal cabins and one resort. The lake's habitat type is best suited for sunfish, largemouth bass, and northern pike.    <br> \n <br> \nNetting assessments are completed on Cowdry every 5 years and date back to 1975.  The northern pike population has remained stable.  Gillnet catches average about 10 fish per net.  Average size is about 20 inches, but occasionally individuals as large as 30 inches or more can be found.  Chances of catching a true trophy northern pike in Lake Cowdry are slim; however, there a plenty of hungry, mid-sized fish to go around and they have excellent eating quality.  Walleyes are popular in the Alexandria Lakes Area and  have been stocked in Lake Cowdry since 1991 to provide additional angling opportunities.  Gillnet catches have averaged about 2 per net, and angling can be decent, especially along deep weedlines.   <br> \n <br> \nPanfish abundance in Cowdry is average when compared to other lakes of similar size and habitat.  Bluegills and crappies averaged about 6 and 8-inches in length, respectively.  Bluegills reach about 6-inches in 7 years and black crappies take about 5 years to reach 10-inches.  Largemouth bass are sampled using electrofishing equipment.  Electrofishing produced a total of 132 adult largemouth bass per hour of effort in the spring of 2008.  Average size was only 9-inches.  No individuals over 16-inches were sampled.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern cisco, or tullibees have been sampled in Lake Cowdry since 1975.  Tullibee are  important cool-coldwater species and a good indicator of water qualilty. It appears tullibee tullibee population numbers are declining.  It would appear that changes in tullibee abundance are the result of changes in habitat suitability.  Cool, oxygenated water typically found in the open, deep-water areas of Lake Cowdry may not be providing adequate summer refuge.  This phenomenon has been reported in many lakes across Minnesota and is cause for concern.  Ambient summer air temperatures are increasing in Minnesota and declining trends in tullibee abundance appear to be a resulting consequence.      <br> \n</p>",

Backpack electrofishing and/or seining were conducted at 10 stations, representing a variety of habitat types, along the shoreline of Lake Cowdry.  The survey was conducted during the five-year sampling window for intensive monitoring efforts within the Long Prairie River watershed, and will be contributing to a watershed assessment process in coordination with Minnesota Pollution Control Agency.\n\nTwenty-one species were collected during this survey.  Seven species (Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, Pugnose Shiner, Rock Bass, and Smallmouth Bass) were considered \"intolerant\" and one species (Green Sunfish) was considered \"tolerant\" based on current tolerance classifications for Minnesota lakes.   \n\nNearshore catch data will be used along with gill and trap net catch data to develop an Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) score, which is indicative of the health of Lake Cowdry.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>The fish community in Lake Cowdry is typical of lakes with similar chemical, physical, and biologicalcharacteristics.  Historical records indicate a relatively stable fish community dominated by abundant,and slow growing northern pike, largemouth bass and bluegill populations.  Lakeshore development hasaccelerated rapidly in the past decade.  This growth in the population of lakeshore residents and thecompletion of a public access in 1994 has increased the demand for fisheries management programs,including the stocking of walleye fingerlings.Northern pike catch rates decreased from 18.0 fish/gillnet in 1989 to 4.2 fish/gillnet in 1994. Gillnet catches have ranged from 8.3 to 18.0 fish/net in previous surveys dating back to 1975.  Thenormal range of mean catch rates from lakes with similar physical and chemical characteristics is 3.5 -10.5 fish/gillnet.   Approximately one-half of the fish captured were between 21 and 28 inches inlength, however no fish was greater than 28 inches.   Largemouth bass are abundant in Cowdry Lake,however the size structure of the population may limit quality fishing opportunities.  Electrofishingyielded 46.4 stock-size fish per hour.  Only 14%  of the fish captured was greater than 12 inches inlength.  A similar electrofishing catch rate and size structure was recorded in 1991.  The poor sizestructure of the largemouth bass population is likely a result of slow growth.  Age-5 fish average only11.0 inches in total length at time of annulus formation.  Bluegill trapnet catches averaged 31.0fish/net in 1994.  Trapnet catches have ranged from 13.8 to 58.0 fish/net in previous surveys datingback to 1975.  The normal range of mean catch rates from similar lake types is 6.1 - 46.6 fish/net. Size structure of the bluegill population is dominated by small individuals.  Only 13% were greaterthan 6 inches and no fish exceeded 8.0 inches in total length.  Two walleye were captured in gillnetswhich equates to a catch rate of 0.3 fish/net.  Historical catch rates dating back to 1979 range from1.3 to 4.7 fish/net.  The normal range of mean catch rates for similar lakes is 1.3 - 5.0 fish/gillnet.Walleye fingerlings were stocked in 1991 and 1994 in response to the planning, purchase, and completionof a public access in 1993.  There was no stocking between 1973 and 1991 because of the lack of apublic access.  Walleye captured in surveys during this period were attributed to migration from LakeDarling.  It is unlikely that walleye stocking will contribute to the fishery in Cowdry Lake given thepoor growth rates of the existing predator populations and limited yellow perch population.  Yellowperch catch rate increased from 0.0 fish/net in 1989 to 7.5 fish/gillnet in 1994.  The only other timethat yellow perch were captured in gillnets was in 1984 when catches averaged 2.5 fish/net.  The normalrange of mean catch rates for similar lakes is 3.4 - 43.6 fish/gillnet.  High northern pike densitieshave likely limited yellow perch abundance in previous years.  Black bullhead catch rates increasedfrom 2.0 fish/gillnet in 1989 to 62.7 fish/gillnet in 1994.  The normal range of mean catch rates is0.8 - 7.7 fish/net.  Mean weight of fish captured in gillnets was 0.5 pounds.    </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Cowdry is a 243-acre, moderately fertile basin located a few miles northwest of downtown Alexandria in Douglas County.  Maximum and mean depths are approximately 52 and 25 feet, respectively.  Lake Cowdry lies within the Long Prairie River watershed.  Primary inflows come from Taylor Lake via a navigable (small boats only) culvert under Lake Cowdry Road NW.  The lake outflows to Lake Darling via a channel that runs under The Central Lakes Trail.  A concrete leveling sill within this channel limits navigation to mostly non-motorized watercraft (canoes, paddleboards, kayaks, etc.).  Residential development surrounds the majority of the shoreline.  Water quality and clarity are considered good and have further increased in recent years following zebra mussel infestation.  Secchi disk readings now exceed 15 feet during summer months.  A public access is located on the northwest shore off of E Lake Cowdry Road.\n\nA standard MN DNR lake survey was completed during summer 2019 to assess the fish community of Lake Cowdry.  Survey methodology included electrofishing, gill nets, and trap nets.  Survey results were indicative of a typical bass-panfish fishery found in smaller, heavily vegetated basins in west-central Minnesota.  Largemouth Bass and Northern Pike were abundant but most of the catch was comprised of small- to medium-sized fish.  Mean size of bass collected with electrofishing was just 11.3 inches but bass exceeding 20.0 inches were sampled.  Mean size of Northern Pike was 21.7 inches.  Very few pike exceeding the upper limit of the North-central zone regulation (i.e., 26 inches) were captured.  Anglers are encouraged to harvest smaller bass and surplus pike below the lower limit of the North-central zone regulation (i.e., 22 inches) to help keep these populations in check.  \n\nPanfishes dominated net catches in 2019.  Bluegill, Pumpkinseed, hybrid sunfishes, Rock Bass, and Black Crappie were all considered abundant but these populations tend to be comprised of smaller individuals.  Yellow Perch were present but this population is extremely limited and is typically not targeted by anglers.  Walleye were also present on a limited basis due to previous stockings and likely emigration from connected basins.  Regular Walleye fingerling stockings were discontinued by the MN DNR in 2016 due to extremely poor survival of stocked fingerlings.  The current stocking regime prescribes surplus stockings of larger Walleye, when available, to maintain a limited fishery.\n  \nOther fish species sampled during the 2019 survey include Bowfin (Dogfish), Common Carp, Shorthead Redhorse, Tullibee (Cisco), and Yellow Bullhead.  The next standard MN DNR lake survey is tentatively scheduled for 2025.\n\nLake Cowdry is designated as an infested waterbody due to the presence of zebra mussels.  This infestation was first confirmed in 2011.
