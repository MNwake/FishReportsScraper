Other area lakes in this class include:  Big Pine, Jewett, Lizzie, Little McDonald, and Marion. <br> \n     Northern pike abundance remained relatively unchanged from the 1988 survey at 2.2 per gill net lift and remains below the normal range for class 27 lakes.  A slight decrease in the average weight of individual pike was noted.   <br> \n     Yellow bullhead abundance increased from 3.7 per trap net lift in 1988 to 11.7, which is 2.3 times greater than the upper limit of the normal range.   <br> \n     Rock bass abundance has increased substantially from 5.0 per gill net lift in 1988 to 11.0, which is 2.5 times greater than the upper limit of the normal range.   <br> \n     Bluegill abundance declined from 52.0 per trap net lift in 1988 to 25.5, but remains within the normal range.  Twelve percent of the bluegills measured were seven inches or greater in length.   <br> \n     Age data for smallmouth bass indicates consistent reproduction as three consecutive year classes were represented in the sample.   <br> \n     Yellow perch abundance decreased slightly from 21.4 per gill net lift in 1988 to 18.5, and remains within the normal range.   <br> \n     Walleye abundance decreased from 12.8 per gill net lift in 1988 to 7.9, but also remains within the normal range.  Strong, naturally produced, 1989 and 1990 year classes composed 28% and 37% of the walleye age-class distribution, respectively.  If the 1988 assessment is also referenced, reproduction has been documented for all skip years in walleye stocking during the 1980's. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>North Lida Lake is located in northwestern Otter Tail County five miles east of Pelican Rapids, MN.  North Lida Lake is a 5,564-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake that is located within the Otter Tail River Watershed.  North Lida Lake is connected to South Lida Lake by a navigable culvert under State Highway 108.  North Lida Lake is also connected to Lizzie Lake by an unnavigable culvert under County Road 4.  The immediate watershed is composed primarily of agricultural land interspersed with hardwood woodlots.  The maximum depth is 58 feet; however, 43% of the lake is less than 15 feet in depth.  The secchi disk reading during the 2000 lake survey was 7.8 feet.  Previous secchi disk readings have ranged from 6.0 to 9.5 feet.  North Lida Lake is included in lake class 27 of the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources' (DNR) lake classification scheme.     A majority of the shoreline on North Lida Lake has been developed.  Homes, cottages, and resorts compose the development.  The 1995 lake resurvey referenced 471 homes/cottages and nine resorts.  A DNR owned concrete public water access is located off of County Road 4 along the north shoreline.  Large stands of hardstem bulrush are scattered along various shorelines of the lake and on several midlake sunken islands.  Emergent aquatic plants such as bulrush and cattail provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat, and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms, and can actually absorb and break down polluting chemicals.  Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish such as northern pike, largemouth bass, and panfish.  They also serve as important nursery areas for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit.   North Lida Lake is a popular angling lake.  The lake is best known for its excellent walleye, smallmouth bass, bluegill, and black crappie angling.  Data from recent lake surveys indicate that these species are abundant and have good size distributions as well.     The test-net catch rate of walleye was the highest recorded in any survey conducted on this lake and was well in excess of the normal range for lake class 27.  Walleye ranged in length from 7.0 to 26.0 inches with an average length and weight of 13.8 inches and 1.0 pound.  Age and catch data indicate that the 1997 year class is strong and should provide consistently good walleye angling for several years.  Walleye attain an average length of 15.6 inches at four years of age.      Data from recent lake surveys indicate that the smallmouth bass population may be improving.  Smallmouth bass ranged in length from 6.5 to 14.4 inches.  Smallmouth bass up to 17.0 inches in length were sampled during a 1997 electrofishing assessment.  Target catch rates for smallmouth bass anglers in the 1995 and 1996 creel surveys were good.     The bluegill test-net catch rate in the recent series of lake surveys has remained within the normal range for lake class 27.  Bluegill average size has recently improved; twenty-five percent of the bluegills sampled were at least 7.0 inches in length.  Bluegills attain an average length of 7.3 inches at six years of age.     As part of a statewide experimental regulations project, an 11-inch minimum size limit for black crappie was implemented in 1997 on North and South Lida Lakes and will be in effect through 2005.  The intent of the regulation is to increase the average size of black crappie in the Lida Lakes. A spring trapnetting assessment was conducted to analyze the black crappie population.  Crappies ranged in length from 5.2 to 13.4 inches with an average length and weight of 9.9 inches and 0.7 pounds.  Thirty-eight percent of the crappies were at least 11.0 inches in length.  Crappies attain an average length of 11.1 inches at five years of age.     The DNR does not stock any fish in North Lida Lake.  The fish species present are able to sustain their levels at or above DNR management goals.  This is an indication of the quality of fish habitat that is present. To maintain the excellent angling and water quality that this lake has to offer, it is imperative to preserve the quality of the aquatic habitat.  The DNR and the Lida Lakes Association have been involved in several cooperative projects designed to improve and protect water quality and fish habitat.  In 1998, a shoreline stabilization project was completed.  Rock rip-rap was used to stabilize several areas of shoreline that were experiencing varying degrees of erosion.  In 1997, 160 smallmouth bass nesting structures were constructed and placed in North Lida Lake.  These structures will help smallmouth bass reproduce more successfully.     Anglers can also maintain the quality of angling by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large-size fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>     North Lida Lake is a 5,564-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located in northwestern Otter Tail County approximately five miles east of Pelican Rapids, MN.  North Lida Lake is connected to South Lida Lake by a navigable culvert under State Highway 108 along the south shoreline.  North Lida Lake is also connected to Lizzie Lake via a non-navigable culvert under County Road 4.  The immediate watershed is composed primarily of agricultural land interspersed with hardwood woodlots.  The maximum depth is 58 feet; however, 43% of the lake is 15 feet or less in depth.  The secchi disk reading during the 2012 lake survey was 6.5 feet.  Previous secchi disk readings have ranged from 6.0 to 9.5 feet.    <br> \n     A majority of the shoreline on North Lida Lake has been developed.  Homes, cottages, and resorts compose the development.  A DNR owned concrete public water access is located off of County Road 4 along the north shoreline.  Large stands of hardstem bulrush are scattered throughout the lake.  Emergent aquatic plants such as bulrush provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat, and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms, and can actually absorb and break down polluting chemicals.  Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish such as northern pike, largemouth bass, and panfish.  They also serve as important nursery areas for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit. <br> \n     North Lida Lake is one of the best all-around angling lakes in Otter Tail County.  Walleye, northern pike, smallmouth bass, black crappie, and bluegill are the dominant gamefish species.  Data from recent lake surveys indicate that these species are abundant and have good size distributions as well.   <br> \n     Walleye abundance is the highest recorded for this lake.  Walleyes ranged in length from 7.2 to 24.6 inches with an average length and weight of 13.7 inches and 1.2 pounds.  Age and catch data indicate that the 2011 year class is very strong and should provide consistently good walleye angling for several years.  Walleyes attain an average length of 14.2 inches at four years of age. <br> \n     Pike abundance has remained at a moderate density and natural reproduction has continued to be consistently good.  Pike ranged in length from 15.0 to 27.2 inches with an average length and weight of 20.4 inches and 1.8 pounds.  Pike attain an average length of 21.8 inches at four years of age. <br> \n     Age and catch data indicate that a balanced smallmouth bass population exists.  Smallmouth bass ranged in length from 5.8 to 18.1 inches with an average length and weight of 12.6 inches and 1.3 pounds.  Age and length data indicate that reproduction is consistently good.  Smallmouth bass attain an average length of 13.8 inches at five years of age. <br> \n     Data from a spring trapnetting assessment indicate that the black crappie population is very abundant and has a good size distribution.  Crappies ranged in length from 2.2 to 13.0 inches with an average length of 10.3 inches.  Forty-seven percent of the sample was 11.0 inches or greater in length.  Crappies attain an average length of 11.4 inches at six years of age. <br> \n     Age and catch data indicate that the bluegill population is very abundant and that reproduction is consistently good.  Twenty-nine percent of the bluegills were 7.0 inches or greater in length.  Bluegills attain an average length of 7.9 inches at seven years of age.   <br> \n     The DNR and the Lida Lakes Association have been involved in several cooperative projects designed to improve and protect water quality and fish habitat.  In 1998, a shoreline stabilization project was completed.  Rock rip-rap was used to stabilize several areas of shoreline that were experiencing varying degrees of erosion.  In 1997, 160 smallmouth bass nesting structures were constructed and placed in North Lida Lake.  These structures help smallmouth bass reproduce more successfully. <br> \n     Harvest regulations for walleye and black crappie have been implemented on North Lida Lake.  The walleye regulation is a 17.0 to 26.0 inch protected slot limit with one fish over 26.0 inches allowed in possession.  The black crappie regulation is an 11-inch minimum length limit.  The intent of these regulations is to improve the size structures of these populations. <br> \n     Anglers can also maintain the quality of angling by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large size fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future.        <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>      North Lida Lake is a 5,564-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located in northwestern Otter Tail County approximately five miles east of Pelican Rapids, MN.  North Lida Lake is connected to South Lida Lake by a navigable culvert under State Highway 108 along the south shoreline.  North Lida Lake is also connected to Lizzie Lake via a non-navigable culvert under County Road 4.  The immediate watershed is composed primarily of agricultural land interspersed with hardwood woodlots.  The maximum depth is 58 feet; however, 43% of the lake is 15 feet or less in depth.  The secchi disk reading during the 2015 lake survey was 14.5 feet.  Previous secchi disk readings ranged from 6.0 to 9.5 feet.    <br> \n     A majority of the shoreline on North Lida Lake has been developed.  Homes, cottages, and resorts compose the development.  A DNR owned concrete public water access is located off of County Road 4 along the north shoreline.  Large stands of hardstem bulrush are scattered throughout the lake.  Emergent aquatic plants such as bulrush provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat, and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms, and can actually absorb and break down polluting chemicals.  Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish such as Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, and panfish.  They also serve as important nursery areas for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit. <br> \n     North Lida Lake is one of the best all-around angling lakes in Otter Tail County.  Walleye, Northern Pike, Smallmouth Bass, Black Crappie, and Bluegill are the dominant gamefish species in the fish community.  Data from recent lake surveys indicate that these species are abundant and have good size distributions as well.   <br> \n     Walleyes ranged in length from 7.4 to 25.2 inches with an average length and weight of 14.3 inches and 1.0 pound.  Age and catch data indicate that the 2011 and 2012 year classes are very strong and should provide consistently good Walleye angling for several years.  Walleyes attain an average length of 13.7 inches at four years of age. <br> \n     Pike abundance has remained at a moderate density and natural reproduction has continued to be consistently good.  Pike ranged in length from 11.4 to 31.6 inches with an average length and weight of 20.5 inches and 1.8 pounds.  Pike attain an average length of 21.5 inches at four years of age. <br> \n     Age and catch data indicate that a balanced Smallmouth Bass population exists.  Smallmouth Bass ranged in length from 5.7 to 17.6 inches with an average length and weight of 12.1 inches and 1.1 pounds.  Age and length data indicate that reproduction is consistently good.  Smallmouth Bass attain an average length of 12.7 inches at four years of age. <br> \n     Data from a spring trapnetting assessment indicate that the Black Crappie population is very abundant and has a good size distribution.  Crappies ranged in length from 8.8 to 13.3 inches with an average length of 11.2 inches.  Forty-four percent of the crappies were 11.0 inches or greater in length.  Crappies attain an average length of 11.2 inches at five years of age. <br> \n     Age and catch data indicate that the Bluegill population is abundant and that reproduction is consistently good.  Twenty-six percent of the Bluegills were 7.0 inches or greater in length.  Bluegills attain an average length of 7.0 inches at five years of age.   <br> \n     The DNR and the Lida Lakes Association have been involved in several cooperative projects designed to improve and protect water quality and fish habitat.  In 1998, a shoreline stabilization project was completed.  Rock rip-rap was used to stabilize several areas of shoreline that were experiencing varying degrees of erosion.  In 1997, 160 Smallmouth Bass nesting structures were constructed and placed in North Lida Lake.  These structures help Smallmouth Bass reproduce more successfully. <br> \n     Harvest regulations for Walleye and Black Crappie have been implemented on North Lida Lake.  The Walleye regulation is a 17.0 to 26.0 inch protected slot limit with one fish over 26.0 inches allowed in possession.  The Black Crappie regulation is an 11-inch minimum length limit.  The intent of these regulations is to improve the size structures of these populations. <br> \n     Anglers can also maintain the quality of angling by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large size fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future.        <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>   North Lida Lake is a 5,564-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located in northwestern Otter Tail County approximately five miles east of Pelican Rapids, MN.  North Lida Lake is connected to South Lida Lake by a navigable culvert under State Highway 108 along the south shoreline.  North Lida Lake is also connected to Lizzie Lake via a non-navigable culvert under County Road 4.  The immediate watershed is composed primarily of agricultural land interspersed with hardwood woodlots.  The maximum depth is 58 feet; however, 43% of the lake is 15 feet or less in depth.  The secchi disk reading during the 2009 lake survey was 9.8 feet.  Previous secchi disk readings have ranged from 6.0 to 9.5 feet.    <br> \n     A majority of the shoreline on North Lida Lake has been developed.  Homes, cottages, and resorts compose the development.  The 1995 lake survey referenced 471 homes/cottages and nine resorts.  A DNR owned concrete public water access is located off of County Road 4 along the north shoreline.  Large stands of hardstem bulrush are scattered throughout the lake.  Emergent aquatic plants such as bulrush provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat, and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms, and can actually absorb and break down polluting chemicals.  Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish such as northern pike, largemouth bass, and panfish.  They also serve as important nursery areas for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit. <br> \n     North Lida Lake is a popular angling lake and is one of the best all-around angling lakes in Otter Tail County.  Walleye, northern pike, smallmouth bass, black crappie, and bluegill are the dominant gamefish species in North Lida Lake.  Data from recent lake surveys indicate that these species are abundant and have good size distributions as well.   <br> \n     The walleye test-net catch rate was within the expected range for similar lakes.  Walleye ranged in length from 8.2 to 26.2 inches with an average length and weight of 16.3 inches and 1.6 pounds.  Age and catch data indicate that the 2006 year class isl strong and should provide consistently good walleye angling for several years.  Walleye reach an average length of 14.1 inches at four years of age. <br> \n     Northern pike population characteristics have demonstrated stability over the recent series of surveys.  Pike abundance has remained at a moderate density and natural reproduction has continued to be consistently good.  Pike ranged in length from 10.7 to 33.8 inches with an average length and weight of 19.3 inches and 1.8 pounds.  Pike reach an average length of 22.3 inches at four years of age. <br> \n     Age and catch data  indicate that a balanced smallmouth bass population exists.  Smallmouth bass ranged in length from 7.1 to 16.1 inches with an average length and weight of 11.9 inches and 1.1 pounds.  Age and length data indicate that reproduction is consistently good. <br> \n     Data from a spring trapnetting assessment indicate that the black crappie population is very abundant and has a good size distribution.  Crappies ranged in length from 8.0 to 12.4 inches with an average length of 10.3.  Nineteen percent of the sample was 11.0 inches or greater in length.  <br> \n     The DNR and the Lida Lakes Association have been involved in several cooperative projects designed to improve and protect water quality and fish habitat.  In 1998, a shoreline stabilization project was completed.  Rock rip-rap was used to stabilize several areas of shoreline that were experiencing varying degrees of erosion.  In 1997, 160 smallmouth bass nesting structures were constructed and placed in North Lida Lake.  These structures help smallmouth bass reproduce more successfully. <br> \n     Harvest regulations for walleye and black crappie have been implemented on North Lida Lake.  The walleye regulation is a 17 to 26 inch protected slot limit with one fish over 26 inches allowed.  The black crappie regulation is an 11-inch minimum size limit.  The intent of these regulations is to improve the size structures of the respective populations. <br> \n     Anglers can also maintain the quality of angling by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large size fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future.       </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of nearshore fish species in North Lida Lake was conducted beginning on July 18, 2017 by Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program Staff.  Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible.  Backpack electrofishing was completed at 24 sampling stations, but four stations were sampled from the boat due to site conditions.  Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample 18 stations, a 15-foot seine was used at two stations, and site conditions prevented the use of seines at four stations.  Nearshore sampling captured 29 species of fish including nine species that are intolerant of disturbance (Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, Least Darter, Logperch, Mimic Shiner, Rock Bass, and Smallmouth Bass) and three that are tolerant of disturbance (Common Carp, Fathead Minnow, and Green Sunfish). <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore data were combined with trap net and gill net data from an August 2015 survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based IBI (FIBI) score.  The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment.  In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g. Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, and Rock Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g. Black Bullhead, Common Carp, and Green Sunfish).  The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake.  For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.   <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey indicates North Lida Lake is in good health as indicated by an FIBI score above the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes.  Data from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Otter Tail River Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>     North Lida Lake is a 5,564-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located in northwestern Otter Tail County approximately five miles east of Pelican Rapids, MN.  North Lida Lake is connected to South Lida Lake by a navigable culvert under State Highway 108 along the south shoreline.  North Lida Lake is also connected to Lizzie Lake via a non-navigable culvert under County Road 4.  The immediate watershed is composed primarily of agricultural land interspersed with hardwood woodlots.  The maximum depth is 58 feet; however, 43% of the lake is 15 feet or less in depth.  The secchi disk reading during the 2018 lake survey was 11.1 feet.  Previous secchi disk readings have ranged from 6.0 to 14.5 feet.    <br> \n     A majority of the shoreline on North Lida Lake has been developed.  Homes, cottages, and resorts compose the majority of the development.  A DNR owned concrete public water access is located off of County Road 4 along the north shoreline.  Large stands of hardstem bulrush are scattered throughout the lake.  Emergent aquatic plants such as bulrush provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat, and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms, and can actually absorb and break down polluting chemicals.  Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish such as Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, and panfish.  They also serve as important nursery areas for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit. <br> \n     North Lida Lake is one of the best all-around angling lakes in Otter Tail County.  Walleye, Northern Pike, Black Crappie, and Bluegill are the dominant gamefish species in the fish community.  Data from recent surveys indicate that these species are abundant and have good size distributions as well. <br> \n     Harvest regulations for Walleye and Black Crappie have been implemented on North Lida Lake.  The Walleye regulation is a 17.0 to 26.0 inch protected slot length limit with one fish over 26.0 inches allowed in possession.  The Black Crappie regulation is an 11-inch minimum length limit.  The intent of these regulations is to improve the size structures of these populations. <br> \n     Walleyes ranged in length from 8.9 to 24.6 inches with an average length and weight of 14.9 inches and 1.2 pounds.  Walleyes attain an average length of 13.1 inches at four years of age. <br> \n     Northern Pike reproduction has continued to be consistently good.  Pike ranged in length from 10.4 to 30.4 inches with an average length and weight of 18.9 inches and 1.5 pounds.  Pike attain an average length of 22.3 inches at four years of age. <br> \n     Black Crappies ranged in length from 6.8 to 12.8 inches with an average length of 11.1 inches.  Sixty-seven percent of the crappies were 11.0 inches or greater in length.  Crappies attain an average length of 11.4 inches at five years of age. <br> \n     Age data indicate that Bluegill reproduction is consistently good.  Thirteen percent of the Bluegills were 7.0 inches or greater in length.  Bluegills attain an average length of 6.6 inches at five years of age.   <br> \n     The DNR and the Lida Lakes Association have been involved in several cooperative projects designed to improve and protect water quality and fish habitat.  In 1998, a shoreline stabilization project was completed.  Rock rip-rap was used to stabilize several areas of shoreline that were experiencing varying degrees of erosion.  In 1997, 160 Smallmouth Bass nesting structures were constructed and placed in North Lida Lake.  These structures help Smallmouth Bass reproduce more successfully. <br> \n     Anglers can also maintain the quality of angling by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large size fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future.       <br> \n     North Lida Lake was listed as infested with zebra mussels in 2014.  Aquatic invasive species are threatening Minnesota waters.  Aquatic invasive species can potentially harm water quality, water recreation, aquatic habitat, native species, and fish populations.  Anglers can help prevent the introduction and spread of invasive species by following watercraft transportation laws.      <br> \n  <br> \n</p>",

Historical secchi disk readings have ranged from 6.0 to 14.5 feet.    <br> \n     A majority of the shoreline on North Lida Lake has been developed.  Homes, cottages, and resorts compose the majority of the development.  A DNR owned concrete public water access is located off of County Road 4 along the north shoreline.  Large stands of hardstem bulrush are scattered throughout the lake.  Emergent aquatic plants such as bulrush provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat, and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms, and can actually absorb and break down polluting chemicals.  Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish such as Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, and panfish.  They also serve as important nursery areas for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit. <br> \n     A reduced daily bag limit regulation for sunfish (10 per day) was implemented in 2022.  The objective of the regulation is to maintain the quality of the Bluegill size structure.  A special spring trapnetting survey was conducted to collect baseline data on the Bluegill population, which will be used for regulation evaluation purposes in future surveys.  The Bluegill population is extremely abundant and has a quality size structure.  Age data indicate that Bluegill reproduction is consistently good.  Seventy-one percent of the Bluegill sample was 7.0 inches or greater in length, while 25% was 8.0 inches or greater in length.  Bluegills attain an average length of 8.3 inches at eight years of age.  <br> \n     Harvest regulations for Walleye and Black Crappie have also been implemented on North Lida Lake.  The Walleye regulation is a 17.0 to 26.0 inch protected slot length limit with one fish over 26.0 inches allowed in possession.  The Black Crappie regulation is an 11-inch minimum length limit.  The intent of these regulations is to maintain the size structures of these populations. <br> \n     Anglers can also maintain the quality of angling by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large size fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish for table fare.

Creel census data (see creel census report) for the first two months of the season suggests a slightly lower harvest rate for walleye than what has been recorded for other walleye lakes in the area.  Electrofishing data indicate that substantial walleye natural reproduction is occurring.  <br> \n     The bullhead population has increased and weight has remained the same despite the removal plan that has been followed.  <br> \n     The cisco population has maintained itself even with moderate pressure by angling and netting.  <br> \n</p>",

Northern pike abundance has steady declined since the 1975 survey, while the average weight has increased from 1.8 lbs. to 2.2 lbs.  Age data indicates a lack of northern pike greater than age-III+.  <br> \n     Bluegill abundance increased from 1.6 per trap net lift in the 1975 survey to 52.0 per trap net lift.  With the increase in abundance there has been a subsequent decline in average weight and a reduction in the percentage of bluegills greater than 7.0 inches in length.  <br> \n     Largemouth bass abundance was similar to the 1985 survey.  Age data indicates a very strong 1987 year class. Smallmouth bass abundance as measured by gill net catch rate was more than double that found in previous surveys.  Age data indicates a strong 1986 year class. <br> \n     Yellow perch abundance increased to 21.4 per gill net lift. <br> \n     Walleye abundance was 12.8 per gill net lift, which is within the catch rate range from previous surveys.  Age and length-frequency distributions indicate a very healthy, well balanced walleye population.  Natural reproduction appears to be supporting the walleye population and there is no correlation between stocking and year class strength. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>     North Lida Lake is a 5,564-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located in northwestern Otter Tail County approximately five miles east of Pelican Rapids, MN.  North Lida Lake is connected to South Lida Lake by a navigable culvert under State Highway 108 along the south shoreline.  North Lida Lake is also connected to Lizzie Lake via a non-navigable culvert under County Road 4.  The immediate watershed is composed primarily of agricultural land interspersed with hardwood woodlots.  The maximum depth is 58 feet; however, 43% of the lake is 15 feet or less in depth.  The secchi disk reading during the 2021 survey was 10.0 feet.  Previous secchi disk readings have ranged from 6.0 to 14.5 feet.    <br> \n     A majority of the shoreline on North Lida Lake has been developed.  Homes, cottages, and resorts compose the majority of the development.  A DNR owned concrete public water access is located off of County Road 4 along the north shoreline.  Large stands of hardstem bulrush are scattered throughout the lake.  Emergent aquatic plants such as bulrush provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat, and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms, and can actually absorb and break down polluting chemicals.  Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish such as Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, and panfish.  They also serve as important nursery areas for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit. <br> \n     Harvest regulations for Walleye and Black Crappie have been implemented on North Lida Lake.  The Walleye regulation is a 17.0 to 26.0 inch protected slot length limit with one fish over 26.0 inches allowed in possession.  The Black Crappie regulation is an 11-inch minimum length limit.  The intent of these regulations is to maintain the size structures of these populations. <br> \n     A special gillnetting survey was conducted to analyze the Walleye and Northern Pike populations.   <br> \n     The general trend has been a decline Walleye abundance.  Walleyes ranged in length from 9.1 to 24.3 inches with an average length and weight of 17.1 inches and 2.0 pounds.  Walleyes attain an average length of 15.8 inches at four years of age.    <br> \n     Northern Pike abundance has remained stable at a moderate density.  Northern Pike reproduction has continued to be consistently good.  Northern Pike ranged in length from 10.9 to 25.7 inches with an average length and weight of 18.2 inches and 1.3 pounds.  Pike attain an average length of 24.7 inches at five years of age. <br> \n     The DNR and the Lida Lakes Association have been involved in several cooperative projects designed to improve and protect water quality and fish habitat.  In 1998, a shoreline stabilization project was completed.  Rock rip-rap was used to stabilize several areas of shoreline that were experiencing varying degrees of erosion.  In 1997, 160 Smallmouth Bass nesting structures were constructed and placed in North Lida Lake.  These structures help Smallmouth Bass reproduce more successfully. <br> \n     Anglers can also maintain the quality of angling by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large size fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future.       <br> \n     North Lida Lake was listed as infested with zebra mussels in 2014.  Aquatic invasive species are threatening Minnesota waters.  Aquatic invasive species can potentially harm water quality, water recreation, aquatic habitat, native species, and fish populations.  Anglers can help prevent the introduction and spread of invasive species by following watercraft transportation laws.      <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>North Lida Lake is located in northwestern Otter Tail County five miles east of Pelican Rapids, MN.  North Lida Lake is a 5,564-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake that is located within the Otter Tail River Watershed.  North Lida Lake is connected to South Lida Lake by a navigable culvert under State Highway 108.  North Lida Lake is also connected to Lizzie Lake by an unnavigable culvert under County Road 4.  The immediate watershed is composed primarily of agricultural land interspersed with hardwood woodlots.  The maximum depth is 58 feet; however, 43% of the lake is less than 15 feet in depth.  The secchi disk reading during the 2003 lake survey was 7.0 feet.  Previous secchi disk readings have ranged from 6.0 to 9.5 feet.  North Lida Lake is included in lake class 27 of the Minnesota DNR lake classification scheme.     A majority of the shoreline on North Lida Lake has been developed.  Homes, cottages, and resorts compose the development.  The 1995 lake resurvey referenced 471 homes/cottages and nine resorts.  A DNR owned concrete public water access is located off of County Road 4 along the north shoreline.  Large stands of hardstem bulrush are scattered along various shorelines of the lake and on several midlake sunken islands.  Emergent aquatic plants such as bulrush and cattail provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat, and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms, and can actually absorb and break down polluting chemicals.  Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish such as northern pike, largemouth bass, and panfish.  They also serve as important nursery areas for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit.       North Lida Lake is a popular angling lake and is one of the best all around angling lakes in Otter Tail County.  Walleye, northern pike, smallmouth bass, bluegill, and black crappie are the dominant fish species in North Lida Lake.  Data from recent lake surveys indicate that these species are abundant and have good size distributions as well.     The test-net catch rate of walleye exceeded the upper limit of the normal range for class 27 lakes.  Walleye ranged in length from 7.2 to 22.0 inches with an average length and weight of 14.0 inches and 1.1 pounds.  Age and catch data indicate that the 2001 year class is strong and should provide consistently good walleye angling for several years.  Walleye attain an average length of 14.5 inches at four years of age.      Northern pike population characteristics have demonstrated stability over the recent series of surveys.  Pike abundance has remained at a moderate density and natural reproduction has continued to be consistently good.  Northern pike ranged in length from 11.7 to 30.0 inches with an average length and weight of 20.4 inches and 1.9 pounds.  Pike attain an average length of 23.0 inches at four years of age.            Data from recent lake surveys indicate that the smallmouth bass population may be improving.  Smallmouth bass ranged in length from 4.9 to 16.4 inches.  Smallmouth bass up to 17.0 inches in length were sampled during a 1997 electrofishing assessment.  Target catch rates for smallmouth bass anglers in the 1995 and 1996 creel surveys were good.     The bluegill test-net catch rate in the recent series of lake surveys has remained within the normal range for lake class 27.  Bluegill size structure has remained stable in recent surveys.  Twenty-three percent of the bluegills sampled were at least 7.0 inches in length.  Bluegills attain an average length of 7.8 inches at six years of age.     As part of a statewide experimental regulations project, an 11-inch minimum size limit for black crappie was implemented in 1997 on North and South Lida Lakes and will be in effect through 2005.  The intent of the regulation is to increase the average size of black crappie in the Lida Lakes. A spring trapnetting assessment was conducted in 2002 to analyze the black crappie population.  Crappies ranged in length from 5.2 to 13.4 inches with an average length and weight of 9.9 inches and 0.7 pounds.  Thirty-eight percent of the crappies were at least 11.0 inches in length.  Crappies attain an average length of 11.1 inches at five years of age.     The DNR does not stock any fish in North Lida Lake.  The fish species present are able to sustain their levels at or above DNR management goals.  This is an indication of the quality of fish habitat that is present. To maintain the excellent angling and water quality that this lake has to offer, it is imperative to preserve the quality of the aquatic habitat.  The DNR and the Lida Lakes Association have been involved in several cooperative projects designed to improve and protect water quality and fish habitat.  In 1998, a shoreline stabilization project was completed.  Rock rip-rap was used to stabilize several areas of shoreline that were experiencing varying degrees of erosion.  In 1997, 160 smallmouth bass nesting structures were constructed and placed in North Lida Lake.  These structures will help smallmouth bass reproduce more successfully.     Anglers can also maintain the quality of angling by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large-size fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>     North Lida Lake is a 5,564-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located in northwestern Otter Tail County approximately five miles east of Pelican Rapids, MN.  North Lida Lake is connected to South Lida Lake by a navigable culvert under State Highway 108 along the south shoreline.  North Lida Lake is also connected to Lizzie Lake via a non-navigable culvert under County Road 4.  The immediate watershed is composed primarily of agricultural land interspersed with hardwood woodlots.  The maximum depth is 58 feet; however, 43% of the lake is 15 feet or less in depth.  The secchi disk reading during the 2006 lake survey was 6.0 feet.  Previous secchi disk readings have ranged from 6.0 to 9.5 feet.  The MN DNR has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different lake classes based on physical and chemical characteristics. North Lida Lake is included in lake class 27; other area lakes in this classification include Pelican, Lizzie, Crystal, Rush, Big Pine, and West Battle.  <br> \n     A majority of the shoreline on North Lida Lake has been developed.  Homes, cottages, and resorts compose the development.  The 1995 lake survey referenced 471 homes/cottages and nine resorts.  A DNR owned concrete public water access is located off of County Road 4 along the north shoreline.  Large stands of hardstem bulrush are scattered throughout the lake.  Emergent aquatic plants such as bulrush provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat, and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms, and can actually absorb and break down polluting chemicals.  Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish such as northern pike, largemouth bass, and panfish.  They also serve as important nursery areas for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit. <br> \n     North Lida Lake is a popular angling lake and is one of the best all-around angling lakes in Otter Tail County.  Walleye, northern pike, smallmouth bass, black crappie, and bluegill are the dominant gamefish species in North Lida Lake.  Data from recent lake surveys indicate that these species are abundant and have good size distributions as well.   <br> \n     The walleye test-net catch exceeded the upper limit of the expected range for similar lakes.  Walleye ranged in length from 8.1 to 23.3 inches with an average length and weight of 14.2 inches and 1.1 pounds.  Age and catch data indicate several strong year classes that should provide consistently good walleye angling for several years. <br> \n     Northern pike population characteristics have demonstrated stability over the recent series of surveys.  Pike abundance has remained at a moderate density and natural reproduction has continued to be consistently good.  Pike ranged in length from 13.3 to 30.7 inches with an average length and weight of 20.7 inches and 1.9 pounds. <br> \n     Data from a spring electrofishing assessment indicate that a balanced smallmouth bass population exists.  Smallmouth bass ranged in length from 6.1 to 19.5 inches with an average length and weight of 13.2 inches and 1.4 pounds.  Length data indicate that reproduction is consistently good. <br> \n     Data from a spring trapnetting assessment indicate that the black crappie population is very abundant and has a good size distribution.  Crappies ranged in length from 4.8 to 14.0 inches with an average length of 9.6 inches.  Thirty-seven percent of the sample was 11.0 inches or greater in length.  <br> \n     The DNR does not stock any fish in North Lida Lake.  The fish species present are able to sustain their levels at or above DNR management goals.  This is an indication of the quality of fish habitat that is present.  To maintain the excellent angling and water quality that this lake has to offer, it is imperative to preserve the quality of the aquatic habitat.  The DNR and the Lida Lakes Association have been involved in several cooperative projects designed to improve and protect water quality and fish habitat.  In 1998, a shoreline stabilization project was completed.  Rock rip-rap was used to stabilize several areas of shoreline that were experiencing varying degrees of erosion.  In 1997, 160 smallmouth bass nesting structures were constructed and placed in North Lida Lake.  These structures help smallmouth bass reproduce more successfully. <br> \n     Harvest regulations for walleye and black crappie have been implemented on North Lida Lake.  The walleye regulation is a 17 to 26 inch protected slot limit with one fish over 26 inches allowed.  The black crappie regulation is an 11-inch minimum size limit.  The intent of these regulations is to improve the size structures of the respective populations. <br> \n     Anglers can also maintain the quality of angling by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large size fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future.       </p>",
