                "narrative": "<p>Middle Jefferson Lake is a 705-acre lake located approximately 3 miles south southeast of Cleveland in Le Sueur County. No public boat ramps are located on the lake. Access is available via the channel connecting it to East Jefferson Lake where there is a DNR-maintained ramp located on the east side off Beaver Dam Road. The lake is a shallow, hypereutrophic lake characterized by low water clarity and excessive algae caused by the presence of nutrients such as phosphorus in the water. It is designated as an infested water body due to the establishment of Eurasian Watermilfoil. Given the maximum depth of 8 feet and elevated nutrient levels, Middle Jefferson Lake has been prone to periodic winterkill events in the past although none have occurred recently. The lake is primarily managed for Bluegill and Black Crappie and secondarily for Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, and Walleye. The current management plan calls for stocking Walleye fry at a rate of 1,000 per littoral acre in odd years and Northern Pike fry annually. Middle Jefferson Lake is managed along with West and East Jefferson Lakes and German Lake as part of a chain of lakes known collectively as the Jefferson Chain. Since these lakes are openly connected to one another, fish migration must be considered and management is coordinated as such. <br> \n <br> \nA standard survey was conducted the week of July 16, 2018 as part of a regularly scheduled monitoring program conducted by the Minnesota DNR. A standard survey is used for sampling a wide range of fish species during the summer months using standard methods (i.e. standard time of year, set sampling stations, taking water clarity readings and oxygen/temperature profiles, etc.) and gears (i.e. lake survey gillnets, trap nets, and spring electrofishing for Largemouth Bass). The survey was completed to assess the fish community using 5 gill nets, 7 trap nets, and 87 minutes of boat electrofishing. Water quality parameters were also measured.  <br> \n <br> \nBluegill were the most commonly sampled fish with the trap nets with a catch rate of 50.7/net, which indicated high numbers were present. In three surveys since 2008, this was the largest catch rate on record. The average catch rate during that time was 33.6/net. Lengths ranged from 2.8 to 8.2 inches with an average of 6.0 inches. An additional 53 Bluegills ranging from 3.7 to 8.8 inches were sampled with gill nets. Approximately 60% of the sample was 4 years old. Although size structure could improve, Middle Jefferson Lake supports a healthy Bluegill population. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappies were the most common fish sampled with gill nets with a total of 351 and a catch rate of 70.2/net, which indicated high numbers were present. Prior catch rates in 2008 (1.0/net) and 2013 (14.5/net) were much lower than in 2018. Lengths ranged from 4.3 to 12.4 inches with an average of 5.9 inches. Another 141 Black Crappies ranging from 4.2 to 11.8 inches were sampled with trap nets. Fish from both gears ranged from 1 to 6 years old with five year classes present. Most of the fish were small and young. Middle Jefferson Lake offers valuable habitat for these fish, which likely migrate throughout the chain, as they get older. <br> \n <br> \nTwenty-eight Northern Pike were sampled with gill nets for a catch rate of 5.6/net which was greater than in 2008 (0.0/net) and 2013 (5.5/net). Lengths ranged from 19.3 to 29.3 inches with an average of 24.2 inches. Approximately 46% of the sample exceeded the legal minimum length of 24 inches. Ages ranged from 1 to 4 years old with 4 year classes present. Over 80% of the sample was 3 or 4 years old. Northern Pike grow quickly in Middle Jefferson and likely exceed 24 inches during their third year of growth. Southern Zone Northern Pike regulations are in effect for Middle Jefferson Lake. Anglers are allowed two fish per day. All fish under 24 inches must be immediately released. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass were sampled with spring boat electrofishing for the first time in 2018. Eighty-five fish were sampled with a catch rate of 58.4/hour on-time. Lengths ranged from 3.3 to 19.7 inches with an average of 9.2 inches. Of catchable size fish (? 8 inches), approximately 42% were larger than 15 inches. Middle Jefferson Lake offers quality habitat for Largemouth Bass and should be sampled with spring boat electrofishing in all future surveys. <br> \n <br> \nJust 10 Walleyes were sampled with gill nets in 2018 for a catch rate of 2.0/net, indicating low numbers were present. Catch rates in 2018 were greater than in 2008 (1.0/net) and 2013 (0.0/net). Lengths ranged from 17.6 to 20.0 inches with an average of 19.2 inches. Nine of the ten fish were aged and were all 4 years old. No Walleyes were stocked in 2014 in Middle Jefferson Lake however; a number of fingerlings were stocked into adjacent West Jefferson Lake that year. It is possible these fish came from that stocking event and migrated into Middle Jefferson at some point. <br> \n <br> \nA total of 43 Black Bullheads were sampled for a catch rate of 8.6/net, which was the lowest of the three surveys on record and indicated low to moderate numbers were present. Meanwhile, Yellow Bullheads increased from 0.0/net in 2008 to 3.0/net in 2013 to 16.0/net in 2018. This inverse relationship is common and is indicative of an increasingly stable environment where Yellow Bullheads are better suited. This should continue in the absence of winterkill or other lake wide disturbances. <br> \n <br> \nCommon Carp are also on the decline in Middle Jefferson Lake. Just 2 fish were sampled with gill nets in 2018 compared to 34.0/net in 2008 and 1.0/net in 2013. Like Black Bullheads, Common Carp thrive in highly degraded systems that experience frequent winterkill. As long as Middle Jefferson remains stable and healthy, Common Carp numbers should remain low and not interfere with game fish management. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled in 2018 include Bowfin, Freshwater Drum, Golden Shiner, Pumpkinseed, White Bass, Yellow Perch, and hybrid sunfish (Lepomis spp). <br> \n <br> \nWater quality measurements included water temperature, dissolved oxygen, and secchi depth. Water clarity was poor with a secchi depth of 1.8 feet. Dissolved oxygen and water temperature readings ranged from 9.6 ppm and 83.1 degrees Fahrenheit at the surface to 6.7 ppm and 80.8 degrees Fahrenheit at 6 feet. No thermocline was detected. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers can play an important role in maintaining or improving a fish population by practicing selective harvest. Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for consumption, while encouraging the release of medium to large fish that may contribute to natural reproduction. This practice helps maintain balance in the fish populations and provides anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future. Additionally, smaller fish often taste better and have fewer contaminants than larger, older fish from the same water body. <br> \n <br> \nShoreline property owners also play an important role in the overall health of an aquatic ecosystem, including the fish population. Natural shorelines, including vegetation, woody debris, and bottom substrates, provide valuable habitat for fish and wildlife, help maintain water quality, and reduce bank erosion. Cattails and bulrushes are particularly beneficial for fish spawning, rearing, and feeding. By leaving natural shorelines unaltered or restoring them to natural conditions, shoreline property owners are doing their part to maintain or improve a healthy ecosystem in the lake and protect the resource for future generations. <br> \n-Sky Wigen, specialist <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Middle Jefferson Lake is a 645 acre lake in Le Sueur county located northwest of Elysian.  The lake is accessed through the narrows on the east side of the lake from East Jefferson Lake; it has a maximum depth of 8 feet, so partial winterkills occur infrequently.  Middle Jefferson Lake is managed to provide a bluegill and black crappie fishery with secondary opportunities for northern pike, largemouth bass, and walleye.   <br> \n <br> \nMiddle Jefferson Lake was surveyed the week of July 24th, 2013 as part of a regular monitoring program conducted by Minnesota DNR.  This survey consisted of deploying trap and gill nets to monitor the fish community.  Black bullheads were the predominant fish sampled in the 2013 assessment, with a gill net catch of 73.5 fish/gill net.  The 2013 catch rate of black bullhead marked a decrease from the 2008 catch rate of 118.0 fish/gill net.  Black bullhead trap net catches also declined from 2008 (26.22 fish/trap net) to 2013 (1.57 fish/trap net).  Black bullhead lengths ranged from 7.0 to 12.5 inches in 2013 and 4.9 to 11.1 inches in the 2008 sample.   <br> \n <br> \nBluegill, black crappie, and yellow perch abundance was high during 2013.  Bluegill were the second-most abundant fish captured in the 2013 assessment with a catch rate of 7.0 fish/gill net and 17 fish/trap net.  The 2013 catch rate of bluegill in nets was above average compared to similar lakes in Minnesota.  Bluegill mean length was 5.0 inches and ranged from 2.7 to 8.3 inches.  Mean weight for bluegill caught by trap nets was 0.1 lbs, which is below what is considered normal for a lake of this type.  Overall, the 2013 catch of bluegill indicated an abundant population comprised of smaller fish.  Black crappie gill net catch rates were 14.5 fish/gill net and above average for this lake type.  Conversely, black crappie trap net catch rates (0.6 fish/trap net) were below normal.  Mean weights for fish caught in both gear types were below average for this lake type.  Lengths ranged from 4.0 to 9.5 inches. Yellow perch between 5.6 and 10.1 inches in total length were caught in gill nets; perch were captured at a rate of 4.5 fish/gill net.  The 2013 survey reflects an overall panfish population with high abundances but less-than-average size structure when compared to similar lakes in Minnesota.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike were sampled at a rate of 5.5 fish/gill net and 0.6 fish/trap net.  The overall mean length of northern pike captured in 2013 was within expected ranges with a mean total length near 21.0 inches.  This is a marked improvement for the northern pike population, given that no individuals were sampled in the 2008 assessment.  Recent northern pike fry stockings in 2006, 2007, 2010, and 2011 are likely contributing to the northern pike population as adults. <br> \n <br> \nBased upon results of northern pike age assessment, most of the northern pike sampled during the 2013 survey were from the 2011 year class, when 36,936 fry were stocked. <br> \n <br> \nSince 2008 freshwater drum and common carp numbers have decreased to a more stable level, with average lengths and weights of both species now falling into the normal range for lakes of this type, whereas the 2008 survey indicated a much larger abundances of smaller young-of-the-year fish.   <br> \n <br> \nNo walleye were caught in the 2013 survey; two were sampled in 2008.  A walleye maintenance stocking program has been in place at Middle Jefferson Lake, walleye fry are stocked three of every four years.  The high abundance of panfish and northern pike likely limit the abundance of walleye in Middle Jefferson Lake.  <br> \n <br> \nOnly five largemouth bass were captured in nets during the 2013 survey.  However, largemouth bass typically are not effectively sampled by nets; thus, these numbers may not reflect true abundance.  The Jefferson chain remains a popular largemouth bass destination and location of bass angling tournaments which indicates that the lake supports a fishable bass population.  Spring electrofishing should be conducted to properly assess the largemouth bass population in the Jefferson Lake chain. <br> \n <br> \nOther fish observed in the 2013 assessment included golden shiners, white bass, pumpkinseed, longnose gar, yellow bullhead, and bowfin (dogfish).  Fish that have been previously sampled in Middle Jefferson but were missing from this assessment included walleye, bigmouth buffalo, common shiner, hybrid sunfish, green sunfish, and white crappie.   <br> \n <br> \nConnectivity exists between the entire Jefferson chain and German lake, so some fish migration is expected.  Eurasian Watermilfoil is present in the Jefferson chain and connected German Lake; therefore, anglers are encouraged to clean and remove all vegetation from boats, trailers, and equipment and drain all water.  Anglers can also help maintain or improve the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest allows for the taking of smaller fish for table fare, but encourages release of medium to large-sized fish.  Releasing these fish can help maintain balance in the fish community in the Jefferson lake chain and provide anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future.   <br> \n <br> \nShoreline areas on the land and into the shallow water provide essential habitat for fish and wildlife that live in or near Minnesota's lakes.  Overdeveloped shorelines cannot support the fish, wildlife, and clean water that are associated with natural, undeveloped lakes.  Shoreline habitat consists of aquatic plants, woody plants, and natural lake bottom soils.  Plants in the water and at the water's edge provide habitat, prevent erosion, and absorb excess nutrients.  Shrubs, trees, and woody debris such as fallen trees or limbs provide good habitat both above and below the water and should be left in place.  By leaving a buffer strip of natural vegetation along the shoreline, property owners can reduce erosion, help maintain water quality, and provide habitat and travel corridors for wildlife. <br> \n <br> \n-Prepared by:  Matt Mork, Fisheries Specialist. <br> \n</p>",

A fishery survey was conducted on Middle Jefferson Lake in August 2002 to assess the fish community and lake characteristics.  Black bullhead were by far the most abundant fish in both gill and trap net samples.  Black bullhead were comprised of two distinct length classes, small fish around 4 to 5 inches and large fish around 9 to 11 inches long.  Golden shiner, yellow perch, freshwater drum, bluegill, and black crappie were all common in gill net catches.  In addition to black bullhead, bluegill were abundant in trap net catches.  Black crappie up to 11 inches were caught, although most were around 6 to 8 inches long.  No public boat launch exists on Middle Jefferson Lake, but access is available via East Jefferson Lake.  Small boats may access from West Jefferson Lake.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>\tMiddle Jefferson Lake is a 645 acre lake in LeSueur county located northwest of Elysian. The lake is accessed through the narrows on the east side of the lake from East Jefferson Lake. East Jefferson was surveyed the week of July 28th, 2008 to monitor the fish community. Middle Jefferson has a maximum depth of 9 feet, so partial winterkills occur infrequently.  <br> \n\tBlack bullhead was the predominant fish in the gill net catch at 118 fish per net. Freshwater drum were gill netted at a rate of 47 per gill net lift and common carp were captured at 34 per gill net lift. In the trap nets, black bullhead were captured at a rate of 26 per net, carp at 19 per net of which 9 on average were young of the year, and freshwater drum at 6 per net. Black crappie and bluegill were numerous in the trap nets at 11 and 33 fish per lift respectively.  <br> \n\tThree walleye were caught in the combined gears. Yellow perch between 5.5 and 10 inches were caught in trap and gill nets; perch were taken at a rate of 12 fish per gill net lift. Six largemouth bass were taken in trap nets nearest the narrows to East Jefferson lake. One individual largemouth bass was over twenty inches.  Other fish observed in the assessment include golden shiner, common shiner, hybrid sunfish, green sunfish, white bass, pumpkinseed, longnose gar, bigmouth buffalo, yellow bullhead, and bowfin (dogfish). Missing from the assessment were white crappie and northern pike, which have been sampled in years past in Middle Jefferson. <br> \n\tConnectivity exists between the entire Jefferson chain and German lake, so some fish migration is expected and the perpetual threat of Eurasian Watermilfoil moving in from German lake exists. Anglers are encouraged to clean and remove all vegetation from boats, trailers, and equipment and drain all water.  <br> \n\tAnglers can help maintain or improve the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest. Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for table fare, but encourages release of medium- to large-sized fish. Releasing these fish can help maintain balance in the fish community in the Jefferson lake chain and provide anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future.  <br> \n\tShoreline areas on the land and into the shallow water provide essential habitat for fish and wildlife that live in or near Minnesota s lakes. Overdeveloped shorelines cannot support the fish, wildlife, and clean water that are associated with natural undeveloped lakes. <br> \n\tShoreline habitat consists of aquatic plants, woody plants, and natural lake bottom soils. Plants in the water and at the water\u0019s edge provide habitat, prevent erosion, and absorb excess nutrients. Shrubs, trees, and woody debris such as fallen trees or limbs provide good habitat both above and below the water and should be left in place. By leaving a buffer strip of natural vegetation along the shoreline, property owners can reduce erosion, help maintain water quality, and provide habitat and travel corridors for wildlife. <br> \n</p>",
