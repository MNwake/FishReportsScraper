Carrie is a small (89 acres), moderately deep (26 feet maximum), and moderately productive lake located in Kandiyohi County. Carrie is connected via the outlet to a large productive and shallow lake (Elizabeth) during high water levels. Fish movement between the two lakes is possible via the outlet channel during high flows. High water levels occurred during June-July of 2014. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye yearlings and adults were recently stocked in 2004 (1,440 fish, 120 pounds), 2006 (97 fish, 58 pounds), 2007 (125 fish, 50 pounds) and 2008 (448 fish, 112 pounds). Walleye oxytetracycline \"OTC\" marked fry were stocked as frylings (8,496 fish) during early July of 2009 (8,496 fish), 2011 (13,040 fish) and 2013 (3,518 fish) in Carrie. Walleye fry (47,541 fish) were stocked in 2014. <br> \n <br> \nAbundant numbers of YOY walleye (98.00 YOY/hour, 5.38 inches average length) were captured in the 2014 fall electrofishing survey. Low numbers of YOY walleye (12.00 YOY/hour, 6.00 inches average length) were captured in the 2013 fall electrofishing survey. There were no YOY walleye captured in the 2010 (non-stocked year) fall electrofishing survey. Abundant numbers of young of year \"YOY\" walleye were captured (fryling stocked years) in the 2011 (58.42 YOY/hour, 6.58 inches) and 2009 fall electrofishing surveys (50.32 YOY/hour, 4.94 inches average length). Approximately 97% and 50% of the YOY walleye were OTC marked fry from the 2011 and 2009 fryling stockings respectively. OTC marked walleye fry (fryling stocked) comprised of 40% of YOY walleye in the 2013 fall electrofishing catch. The unmarked fish observed in the 2009 and 2013 falls were probably from connected Lake Elizabeth (2009 and 2013 unmarked fry stockings) or perhaps natural reproduction in Carrie. Good walleye spawning habitat (wind-swept areas of rubble bars and points) is not present in Carrie. Walleye spawning in the outlet adjacent to Lake Elizabeth has been noted in the past. A large shallow connected lake (Elizabeth) had abundant numbers of YOY walleye from fry stocking years in 2009 (51.00 YOY/hour), 2011 (86.00 YOY/hour) and 2013 (133.13 YOY/hour). The walleye population present in Carrie had been primarily the result of fish movement from Elizabeth into Carrie during high water prior to 2009. <br> \n <br> \nCarrie Lake will be sampled for water quality, aquatic vegetation, and fish abundance during 2016 as part of the routine Spicer Area schedule. Fall electrofishing surveys will continue to occur during walleye fry or fryling stocking years. Carrie may also have additional sampling as part of the DNR Sentinel Lakes Program. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Carrie Lake is part of a statewide long-term monitoring program \"Sentinel Lakes Project\" to document effects of climate change and other stressors on 25 lakes.  A targeted fall night electrofishing survey was conducted on Carrie during September 7, 2018 to evaluate young of year \"YOY\" (fingerling sized) Walleye numbers due to a fry stocking. <br> \n <br> \nCarrie is a small (89 acres), moderately deep (26 feet maximum), and moderately productive lake located in Kandiyohi County. The primary species managed in Carrie include Walleye, Largemouth Bass, and Black Crappie. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye were not stocked of any consequence into Carrie prior to 2004. Walleye natural reproduction has been generally insignificant based on previous surveys and analysis for Carrie. Natural Walleye reproduction is generally nonexistent in Carrie Lake proper due to lack of good spawning habitat (windswept rock shoals and points). Walleye have been observed spawning in a small area of the outlet channel adjacent to Lake Elizabeth. Most Walleye present in Carrie prior to this time were due to immigration from connected Lake Elizabeth during high water years. Low numbers of Walleye yearlings and adults were stocked in 2004, 2007 and 2008. Newly hatched Walleye fry were marked with oxytetracycline \"OTC\" and raised to about 2 inch fryling size at the New London Hatchery prior to 2017. These frylings were stocked during early July of 2009 (8,496 Pike River strain fish), 2011 (13,040 Pike River Strain fish), 2013 (3,518 Pike River strain fish) and 2016 (15,220 Spicer strain fish) into Carrie. Unmarked Spicer Strain Walleye fry were stocked in May of 2014 (47,541 fish) and 2018 (51,368 fish). <br> \n <br> \nWalleye fryling and fry stockings have been generally successful at establishing moderate adult Walleye numbers into Carrie since 2009. Although low numbers of YOY Walleye (16.00 YOY/hour, 5.39 inches) were documented due to the 2018 fry stocking, Walleye adults/yearlings from previous stockings were moderately abundant (8.00 fish/hour, 14.00 inches) in the 2018 fall survey. Abundant YOY Walleye numbers (62.18 YOY/hour, 5.52 inches) were captured previously in 2016. OTC marked fish accounted for 89.5% of the 2016 fall YOY Walleye electrofishing catch. Abundant YOY Walleye numbers (98.00 YOY/hour, 5.38 inches average length) were also captured in the 2014 fall electrofishing survey. Abundant YOY Walleye numbers were captured (fryling stocked years) in the 2011 (58.42 YOY/hour, 6.58 inches) and 2009 fall electrofishing surveys (50.32 YOY/hour, 4.94 inches average length). Abundant numbers of Black Crappie (about 6 inches), Bluegill and adult Walleye also were observed in the 2018 fall electrofishing survey. <br> \n <br> \nAdult Walleye abundance (11.00 fish/gillnet) was above the normal ranges for Carrie and Lake Class 31 lakes in the most recent 2016 summer standard gillnet and trapnet survey. The 2016 Walleye average length was 15.05 inches from gillnets. The 2014 (fry stocked) year class comprised 57% of the 2016 Walleye gillnet and trapnet catch. <br> \n <br> \nCurrent fish management activities on Carrie include continued participation in the Sentinel Lakes Project, protecting the important aquatic habitats such as emergent and submergent vegetation through the permit process, assisting aquatic plant management and enforcement personnel in educating boaters and monitoring access sites for potential invasive species introductions, encouraging land owners to implement best management practices in the watershed, and stocking various fish species as warranted. All fish species will be sampled in 2021. Fall night electrofishing will be conducted during Walleye fryling/fry stocked years to assess the success or failure of the stockings. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Carrie Lake is part of a statewide, long-term monitoring program (SLICE) to document effects of climate change and other stressors on 25 lakes. Temperature dataloggers are retrieved, downloaded and redeployed in the deepest portion of lake during early winter each year on Carrie Lake as part of SLICE program. The data logger records water temperature every 30 minutes at a depth of approximately 7 feet. A standard survey of Carrie was conducted on June 21, 2021 to evaluate Bluegill, Black Crappie, Yellow Perch, Northern Pike and Walleye populations with gillnet and trapnets. A spring night electrofishing was conducted on June 1, 2021 to evaluate the Largemouth Bass population. A fall night electrofishing survey was last conducted on September 5, 2019 to evaluate young of year \"YOY\" (fingerling sized) Walleye numbers due to a fryling stocking. <br> \n <br> \nCarrie is a small (89 acres), moderately deep (26 feet maximum), and moderately productive lake located in Kandiyohi County. Carrie is connected via the outlet to a large productive and shallow lake (Elizabeth) during high water levels. Fish movement between the two lakes is possible via the outlet channel during high flows. High water levels occurred during June-July of 2014 and fall of 2016. No or reduced outlet connection was present due to low water levels in 2020 and 2021. Dissolved oxygen was near 8.0 ppm from the surface to 20 feet deep during the 2021 summer standard survey. The water temperature was near 70 F at the same depths. Water clarity was 4.0 feet on June 21, 2021. Dissolved oxygen was near 12 ppm at 1 foot below the ice during late December of 2021. Winterkill has never been an issue for Carrie due to its depth (26 feet) unlike two other nearby shallow (10 feet or less) lakes (Elizabeth and Ella). Emergent and floating-leaf aquatic vegetation present in moderate densities include cattail species, hardstem bulrush, white waterlily and yellow waterlily. Submergent vegetation species and densities have been generally limited (water moss, coontail, sago pondweed) during past surveys in Carrie. Submergent vegetation and macroalgal densities (chara, coontail) were low in 2021. Yellow waterlily frequency was low compared to previous years along the southwest cattail shore area. Curly-leaf pondweed was present in numerous scattered stands and 10 of 60 points along near shore areas of the lake, especially along the north end of the lake in June of 2013, but none in 2021. Curly-leaf pondweed was never sampled in lake surveys prior to 2010; however, it was present at one point site during the June 2010 vegetation survey. Curly-leaf pondweed densities have been abundant in nearby Elizabeth and Ella during past years. Nearby Lake Elizabeth water levels were low with high densities of submergent vegetation (coontail, northern milfoil, sago pondweed) in 2021. Shoreland development is limited along Carrie. Low agricultural row crop runoff into Carrie occurs via several small inlets. Shoalwater substrates are composed primarily of sand, marl, clay and silt. The primary species managed in Carrie include Walleye, Largemouth Bass, Bluegill and Black Crappie. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike abundance in 2021 gillnet was low (3.00 fish/gillnet) for Carrie. Northern Pike numbers were abundant (13.0 fish/gillnet) in the 2011 (13.00 fish/gillnet) and 2013 (14.00 fish/gillnet) summer gillnet surveys. The Northern Pike historical average catch rate is 7.30 fish/gillnet for Carrie. The 2021 Northern Pike average size was small (2.36 pounds and 21.73 inches). The Northern Pike historical average weight is 2.69 pounds from gillnets. The largest Northern Pike sampled was 30.00 inches in the 2021 nets. Northern Pike growth rates were below or at the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-8. There were no dominant Northern Pike year classes in Carrie. Northern Pike possession limit regulations for Carrie in the North-central Zone are as follows: anglers can keep 10 Northern Pike, but not more than two pike longer than 26 inches; and all from 22 to 26 inches must be released. Northern Pike taken by spearing follow the same rules except one pike may be between 22 and 26 inches or two larger than 26 inches. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill abundance in 2021 summer trapnets was high (24.00 fish/trapnet) for Carrie. The Bluegill historical average catch rate is 15.52 fish/trapnet. The 2021 Bluegill average size was small (0.08 pounds and 4.82 inches) from trapnets. The Bluegill historical average weight and length were 0.16 pounds and 5.35 inches from trapnets. The 2021 Bluegill catch rate of quality size (6.00 plus inches) was low (2.00 fish/trapnet). Bluegill growth rates were generally within the Spicer Area 50th normal ranges for ages 1-5. The 2019 year class comprised 68% of the 2021 Bluegill survey catch. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie abundance in the 2021 summer trapnets was low (5.60 fish/trapnet) for Carrie. High numbers of Black Crappie were captured in 2016 (25.00 fish/trapnet), 2010 (60.20 fish/trapnet) and 2009 (26.00 fish/trapnet). The Black Crappie historical average catch rate is 14.44 fish/trapnet for Carrie. The 2021 Black Crappie average size was small (0.20 pounds and 6.81 inches) from trapnets. The Black Crappie historical average weight is 0.26 pounds from trapnets. Black Crappie abundance was moderate (7.00 fish/gillnet) (0.24 pounds and 7.13 inches) in the 2021 gillnet. The 2021 Black Crappie catch rate of preferred size (10.00 inches and larger fish) was low (0.2 fish/trapnet). Black Crappie growth rates were generally below the Spicer Area normal ranges. The 2019 year class comprised 39% of the 2021 Black Crappie survey catch. White Crappie were absent in the 2021 trapnets and low in the 2016 trapnets (0.80 fish/trapnet). <br> \n <br> \nBlack Bullhead absent in the 2021 summer trapnets. Black Bullhead abundance in the 2021 summer gill net was low (0.50 fish/gillnet) for Carrie. The Black Bullhead average weight was large (1.38 pounds) in the 2021 gillnet. The Black Bullhead historical average catch rate were 15.05 fish/gillnet and 18.18 fish/trapnet respectively for Carrie. The highest Black Bullhead trapnet catch rate was 147.40 fish/trapnet in 2002. Yellow Bullhead abundance was low (0.60 fish/trapnet, 0.81 pounds) in the 2021 summer trapnets.   <br> \n <br> \nChannel catfish were sampled in gill nets for the first time in Carrie Lake in 2013. One larger individual was captured weighing 9.37 pounds and measuring 24.8 inches in 2013. Channel catfish were sampled for the first time in connected Lake Elizabeth in 2011. No Channel Catfish were captured in Carrie during 2016 or 2021. <br> \n <br> \nCommon Carp abundance in 2021 summer trapnets was low (1.00 fish/trapnet) and similar to the historical average (0.86 fish/trapnet) for Carrie. The Common Carp average size was large (7.30 pounds, 24.97 inches) in the 2021 summer trapnets. Common Carp abundance (2.50 fish/gillnet) in 2021 gillnet was also similar to the historical average (2.60 fish/gillnet) for Carrie Lake. Numerous Common Carp were observed surfacing during the 2021 survey. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass abundance was moderate for Carrie (21.29 fish/hour) in the early-June 2021 electrofishing survey. The 2021 average size was large (15.00 inches, 1.91 pounds) from early-June electrofishing. Most Largemouth Bass females had eggs during the 2021 early-June electrofishing survey. The 2021 Largemouth Bass catch rate of preferred size (15.00 inches and larger fish) was high (12.58 fish/hour). Largemouth Bass growth rates were above or near the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-8. The 2017 and 2016 year classes comprised 36% and 32% respectively of the 2021 early-June electrofishing catch. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch abundance in the 2021 gillnet was moderate (8.00 fish/gillnet) for Carrie. The Yellow Perch historical average catch rate is 10.95 fish/gillnet. The 2021 Yellow Perch average size was moderate (0.13 pounds and 7.72 inches). The Yellow Perch historical average weight is 0.14 pounds from gillnets. Yellow Perch growth rates were below the Spicer Area 50th quartiles for ages 1-5, but at the 50th quartile for age 6. The 2018 year class comprised 41% of the 2021 Yellow Perch survey catch. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance in the 2021 summer gillnet was high (20.50 fish/gillnet) for Carrie. The Walleye historical average catch rate is 6.05 fish/gillnet. The 2021 summer Walleye average weight was 1.32 pounds from the gillnet. Historical average size is 2.03 pounds for Walleye from gillnets. The 2021 Walleye average length was 14.91 inches from gillnet. The 2021 Walleye catch rate of quality size (15.00 inches and larger fish) was high (8.50 fish/gillnet). Walleye growth rates were below the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-7. The 2018 year class (fry stocked) comprised 50% of the 2021 Walleye survey catch. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye yearlings and adults were stocked in 2004 (1,440 fish, 120 pounds), 2006 (97 fish, 58 pounds), 2007 (125 fish, 50 pounds) and 2008 (448 fish, 112 pounds). Walleye oxytetracycline \"OTC\" marked fry were stocked as frylings (8,496 fish) during early July of 2009 (8,496 Pike River strain fish), 2011 (13,040 Pike River Strain fish), 2013 (3,518 Pike River strain fish) and 2016 (15,220 Spicer strain fish) in Carrie. Unmarked Spicer strain Walleye fry were stocked in 2014 (47,541 fish), 2018 (51,368 fish), 2019 (35,994 fish) and 2021 (51,368 fish). <br> \n <br> \nA fall night electrofishing survey for young of year \"YOY\" (fingerling sized) Walleye on Carrie Lake was last conducted during 2019. Abundant YOY Walleye numbers were captured in the 2019 fall electrofishing survey (78.00 YOY/hour, 5.60 inches). Low numbers of YOY Walleye (16.00 YOY/hour, 5.39 inches) were captured in the 2018 fall electrofishing survey. Walleye yearlings were abundant (27.00 fish/hour, 9.91 inches) in the 2019 fall survey and moderately abundant (8.00 fish/hour, 14.00 inches) in the 2018 fall survey. Abundant YOY Walleye numbers (62.18 YOY/hour, 5.52 inches) were captured in 2016. No yearling Walleye were captured in the 2016 fall electrofishing survey. Abundant YOY Walleye numbers (98.00 YOY/hour, 5.38 inches average length) were also captured in the 2014 fall electrofishing survey. Low numbers of YOY Walleye (12.00 YOY/hour, 6.00 inches average length) were captured in the 2013 fall electrofishing survey. There were no YOY Walleye captured in the 2010 (non-stocked year) fall electrofishing survey. Abundant YOY Walleye numbers were captured (fryling stocked years) in the 2011 (58.42 YOY/hour, 6.58 inches) and 2009 fall electrofishing surveys (50.32 YOY/hour, 4.94 inches average length). Approximately 97% and 50% of the YOY Walleye were OTC marked fish from the 2011 and 2009 fryling stockings respectively. OTC marked Walleye fish (fryling stocked) comprised of 40% of YOY Walleye in the 2013 fall electrofishing catch. The unmarked fish observed in the 2009 and 2013 falls were probably from connected Lake Elizabeth (2009 and 2013 unmarked fry stockings) or perhaps natural reproduction in Carrie. Good Walleye spawning habitat (wind-swept areas of rubble bars and points) is not present in Carrie. Walleye spawning in the outlet adjacent to Lake Elizabeth has been noted in the past. A large shallow connected lake (Elizabeth) had abundant numbers of YOY Walleye from fry stocking years in 2009 (51.00 YOY/hour), 2011 (86.00 YOY/hour) and 2013 (133.13 YOY/hour). The Walleye population present in Carrie had been primarily the result of fish movement from Elizabeth into Carrie during high water prior to 2009. <br> \n <br> \nCurrent fish management activities on Carrie include continued participation in the Sentinel Lakes Project, protecting the important aquatic habitats such as emergent and submergent vegetation through the permit process, assisting aquatic plant management and enforcement personnel in educating boaters and monitoring access sites for potential invasive species introductions, encouraging land owners to implement best management practices in the watershed, and stocking various fish species as warranted. All fish species will be sampled in 2026. Fall night electrofishing may be conducted during Walleye fryling/fry stocked years to assess the success or failure of the stockings. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Carrie Lake is part of a statewide long-term monitoring program \"Sentinel Lakes Project\" to document effects of climate change and other stressors on 25 lakes.  A targeted fall night electrofishing survey was conducted on Carrie during September 5, 2019 to evaluate young of year \"YOY\" (fingerling sized) Walleye numbers due to a fry stocking. <br> \n <br> \nCarrie is a small (89 acres), moderately deep (26 feet maximum), and moderately productive lake located in Kandiyohi County. The primary species managed in Carrie include Walleye, Largemouth Bass, and Black Crappie.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye were not stocked of any consequence into Carrie prior to 2004. Walleye natural reproduction has been generally insignificant based on previous surveys for Carrie. Natural Walleye reproduction is generally nonexistent in Carrie Lake proper due to lack of good spawning habitat (windswept rock shoals and points). Walleye have been observed spawning in a small area of the outlet channel adjacent to Lake Elizabeth. Most Walleye present in Carrie prior to this time were due to immigration from connected Lake Elizabeth during high water years. Low numbers of Walleye yearlings and adults were stocked in 2004, 2007 and 2008. Newly hatched Walleye fry were marked with oxytetracycline \"OTC\" and raised to about 2 inch fryling size at the New London Hatchery prior to 2017. These frylings were stocked during early July of 2009 (8,496 fish), 2011 (13,040 fish), 2013 (3,518 fish) and 2016 (15,220 fish) into Carrie. Unmarked Spicer Strain Walleye fry were stocked in May of 2014 (47,541 fish), 2018 (51,368 fish) and 2019 (35,994 fish). <br> \n <br> \nAbundant YOY Walleye numbers were captured in the 2019 fall electrofishing survey (78.00 YOY/hour, 5.60 inches). Low numbers of YOY Walleye (16.00 YOY/hour, 5.39 inches) were captured in the 2018 fall electrofishing survey. Walleye yearlings were abundant (27.00 fish/hour, 9.91 inches) in the 2019 fall survey and moderately abundant (8.00 fish/hour, 14.00 inches) in the 2018 fall survey. Abundant YOY Walleye numbers (62.18 YOY/hour, 5.52 inches) were captured previously in 2016. OTC marked fish accounted for 89.5% of the 2016 fall YOY Walleye electrofishing catch. Abundant YOY Walleye numbers (98.00 YOY/hour, 5.38 inches average length) were also captured in the 2014 fall electrofishing survey. Low numbers of YOY Walleye (12.00 YOY/hour, 6.00 inches average length) were captured in the 2013 fall electrofishing survey.  <br> \n <br> \nAdult Walleye abundance (11.00 fish/gillnet) was above the normal ranges for Carrie and similar lakes in the most recent 2016 summer standard gillnet and trapnet survey. The 2016 Walleye average length was 15.05 inches from gillnets. The 2014 (fry stocked) year class comprised 57% of the 2016 Walleye gillnet and trapnet catch. <br> \n <br> \nCurrent fish management activities on Carrie include continued participation in the Sentinel Lakes Project, protecting the important aquatic habitats such as emergent and submergent vegetation through the permit process, assisting aquatic plant management and enforcement personnel in educating boaters and monitoring access sites for potential invasive species introductions, encouraging land owners to implement best management practices in the watershed, and stocking various fish species as warranted. All fish species will be sampled in 2021. Fall night electrofishing will be conducted during Walleye fryling/fry stocked years (next stocking in 2021) to assess the success or failure of the stockings. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A fish population assessment of Lake Carrie was conducted in late June of 2002. Carrie is a small (81 acres) and moderately productive lake located in Kandiyohi County. The maximum depth is 26 feet. Development of the shoreline has remained relatively static for many years due to poor accessibility and low marsh areas adjacent to the lake. Cattail and bulrush vegetation are common along the entire shoreline. Water quality and clarity are moderate, but algae blooms can occur during the late summer months. Carrie is connected to a large shallow and productive lake (Elizabeth) via an outlet channel during moderate/high water level conditions. Fish movement frequently occurs between the two lakes during the spring months. Walleye have been observed spawning in the outlet channel adjacent to the two lakes. Lake Elizabeth is stocked with walleye fry every other year. Carrie was last stocked with 44 adult northern pike in 1995. Carrie is scheduled for a stocking of walleye yearlings (105 lbs.) in 2003. Local anglers had good fishing success for northern pike (3-6 lbs.) and crappies during the 2002 summer.Both black and white crappie species are present in Carrie. Combined black and white crappie numbers were the highest historical recorded value for Carrie in 2002 (66.8 fish/trapnet). The combined crappie historical average catch rate is 23.1 fish/trapnet. The combined crappie average size was small (0.13 lbs. and 6.3 inches) from trapnets. The largest crappie captured was 11.8 inches. About 90% of the white and black crappie captured in the 2002 summer assessment were hatched in 2000 or 2001.Northern pike numbers were high in 2002 (12.0 fish/gillnet) compared to the historical average (6.40 fish/gillnet). The northern pike average size was moderate (2.79 lbs. and 22.10 inches) from gillnets. The northern pike historical average length is 22.6 inches. Northern pike growth rates in Carrie were below the normal range compared to other area lakes.

The largest walleye captured was 26.9 inches in the 2002 summer assessment. Walleye growth rates in Carrie were above the normal range compared to other area lakes. There were no apparent dominant walleye year classes present in Carrie. Presently, it is not known whether the walleye population in Carrie is due primarily to movement into the Lake Carrie from Lake Elizabeth or natural reproduction within the lake. Walleye year classes represented in the 2002 Carrie catch appear to match walleye stockings in Lake Elizabeth.Bluegill numbers were moderate in 2002 (17.2 fish/trapnet) and similar to the historical average (16.5 fish/trapnet). The 2002 bluegill average size was small (0.05 lbs. and 3.7 inches) from trapnets. The Carrie historical average length is 5.3 inches.

                "narrative": "<p>Carrie Lake is part of a statewide research project \"Sentinel Lakes Project\" to document effects of climate change on 24 lakes. Intensive fish, water quality, IBI, zooplankton, and aquatic vegetation sampling was scheduled to be conducted from 2008-2011 on the Sentinel Lakes. An ice out trapnet survey of Carrie was conducted from April 14-17, 2011 to evaluate large sized northern pike abundance. A spring electrofishing survey of Carrie was conducted on May 23, 2011 to evaluate largemouth bass abundance. An early summer population assessment of Carrie was conducted on June 20-22, 2011 to evaluate bluegill, crappie, yellow perch, northern pike and walleye populations. A fall electrofishing survey was conducted on September 7, 2011 to evaluate young of year \"YOY\" walleye abundance due natural reproduction or stocking. Point-intercept vegetation surveys were conducted in early June of 2011 for curly-leaf pondweed and mid July for all aquatic vegetation species. Water quality and zooplankton sampling was conducted during the summer months primarily by DNR Ecological Services and MNPCA.  <br> \n <br> \nCarrie is a small (81 acres), moderately deep (26 feet maximum), and moderately productive lake located in Kandiyohi County. Carrie is connected via the outlet to a large productive and shallow lake (Elizabeth) during high water levels. Fish movement between the two lakes is possible via the outlet channel during high flows. Water levels were high during the spring and early summer of 2011, but normal to low by the fall of 2011. Water clarity was moderate on June 20, 2011 (5.6 feet). Dissolved oxygen levels were less than 2.0 ppm below 22 feet of water on June 20, 2011 for Carrie. Total phosphorus level (0.015 ppm) was low during June 13, 2011. Blue-green algae blooms are common during late summer. Submergent vegetation species and densities have been generally limited (water moss, coontail, sago pondweed) during past surveys in Carrie. Curly-leaf pondweed was present in numerous scattered stands and 9 of 60 points along near shore areas of the lake, especially along the north end of the lake in June of 2011. Curly-leaf pondweed was never sampled in lake surveys prior to 2010; however it was present at one point site during the June 2010 vegetation survey. Curly-leaf pondweed densities have been abundant in nearby Elizabeth and Ella during past years. Vegetation species sampled in both June and July of 2011 for Carrie consisted of hardstem bulrush, cattail species, yellow water lily, clasping-leaf pondweed, curly-leaf pondweed, chara and sago pondweed. Other species sampled in one or the other 2011 vegetation surveys for Carrie included Swamp Aster, filamentous algae, cane, reed canary grass, and arrowhead. Submergent vegetation density was light during the 2011 summer. Hardstem bulrush (north and east portions) and cattail stands (south portions) were moderately abundant in Carrie. Yellow water lily stands were abundant along the west, south, and north shore areas. Shoalwater substrates were composed primarily of silt, marl, muck, and sand. Shore land development (12 homes/cabins and 7 recreational vehicles in 2011) is limited along Carrie. Moderate agricultural row crop runoff into Carrie occurs via several small inlets. The primary species managed in Carrie include walleye, largemouth bass, and black crappie. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike abundance was low (0.69 fish/trapnet, 25 fish) in the 2011 ice out trapnets. The northern pike average size was small (1.83 pounds and 19.85 inches) from ice out trapnets. The largest northern pike captured was 26.38 inches from the 2011 ice out trapnets. Annual ice out trap netting has not been a successful gear in sampling large numbers or larger sized northern pike in Carrie from 2008-2011. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike numbers were high (13.00 fish/gillnet) in 2011 summer gillnets and above the normal ranges for Carrie and similar lakes. Northern pike numbers were also abundant (7.00 fish/gillnet, 3.11 pounds average weight) in the previous 2006 summer gillnet survey. The northern pike historical average catch rate is 7.43 fish/gillnet for Carrie. The 2011 northern pike average size was small (2.40 pounds and 21.09 inches) from summer gillnets. The northern pike historical average weight is 2.77 pounds from gillnets. The largest northern pike sampled was 31.89 inches in the 2011 nets. The catch rate of quality size (21.00 inches) and larger northern pike (7.00 fish/gillnet) was high in 2011 summer. The catch rate of preferred size (28.00 inches) and larger northern pike (1.00 fish/gillnet) was moderate in 2011 summer. Northern pike growth rates were within the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-4, but below for ages 5-8. The 2008 year class comprised 41% of the 2011 northern pike summer catch. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass catch rate (30.00 fish/hour) was moderate in the 2011 spring electrofishing and within the normal range of Spicer Area lakes. The Carrie historical average catch rate is 18.46 fish/hour. The 2011 largemouth bass average size was small (0.67 pounds and 9.41 inches) from spring electrofishing. The largemouth bass historical average weight and length are 0.97 pounds and 10.69 inches from spring electrofishing for Carrie. The largemouth bass catch rate of preferred size (15.00 inches and larger) was low (2.73 fish/hour) in 2011. Largemouth bass growth rates were near the higher ends of the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-6. The 2009 year class comprised 40% of the 2011 spring electrofishing largemouth bass catch. The largest largemouth bass captured was 15.55 inches in the 2011 spring electrofishing survey. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill numbers were low to moderate (13.00 fish/trapnet) in the 2011 and within the normal ranges for Carrie and similar lakes. The bluegill historical average catch rate is 15.32 fish/trapnet. The 2011 bluegill average size was moderate (0.18 pounds and 5.98 inches) from summer trapnets. The bluegill historical average weight and length were 0.16 pounds and 4.90 inches from trapnets. The catch rate of quality size (6.00 inches) and larger bluegill was moderate (7.40 fish/trapnet) in 2011. The catch rate of preferred size (8.00 inches) and larger bluegill was low (0.4 fish/trapnet) in 2011.  <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie numbers were moderate (13.00 fish/trapnet) in the 2011 summer compared to the normal range for Carrie, but above the normal range for similar lakes. High numbers of black crappie were captured in 2010 (60.20 fish/trapnet) and 2009 (26.00 fish/trapnet). Low numbers of black crappie were captured in 2008 summer (0.60 fish/trapnet). Moderate black crappie numbers were present in the 2006 summer (10.80 fish/trapnet). The black crappie historical average catch rate is 19.32 fish/trapnet for Carrie. The 2011 black crappie average size was small (0.16 pounds and 6.11 inches) from trapnets. The black crappie historical average weight is 0.21 pounds from trapnets. The catch rate of quality size (8.00 inches) and larger black crappie was low (3.40 fish/trapnet) in 2011. Black crappie will reproduce with white crappie in Carrie to produce \"F1\" hybrids, which closely resemble black crappie, but have faster growth rates.  <br> \n <br> \nWhite crappie numbers were low (2.60 fish/trapnet) in the 2011 summer, but within the normal range for Carrie. The white crappie historical average catch rate is 12.06 fish/trapnet. The white crappie catch rate was 44.40 fish/trapnet in 2008, 11.60 fish/trapnet in 2009 and 27.60 fish/trapnet in 2010. The 2011 white crappie average size was moderate (0.27 pounds and 8.16 inches) respectively from summer trapnets. The white crappie historical average weight is 0.17 pounds. The catch rate of quality size (8.00 inches) and larger white crappie was low (1.00 fish/trapnet) in the 2011 summer.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch numbers were high (34.00 fish/gillnet) in 2011 and above the normal range for Carrie, but within the normal range for similar lakes. The yellow perch historical average catch rate is 13.50 fish/gillnet. The 2011 yellow perch average size was small to moderate (0.16 pounds and 6.76 inches) from gillnets. The historical average weight is 0.12 pounds from gillnets. The catch rate of quality (8.00 inches) and larger yellow perch was low (4.00 fish/gillnet) in 2011. Yellow perch growth rates were within the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-6. The 2009 year class comprised 47% of the 2011 summer gillnet and trapnet catch. <br> \n <br> \nBlack bullhead numbers were low (1.40 fish/trapnet) in the 2011 summer. No black bullhead were captured in the 2011 gillnets. Brown bullhead were absent in the 2011 summer nets. Brown bullhead abundance was low (0.20 fish/trapnet) in the 2010 summer trapnets. The black bullhead and brown bullhead historical average catch rates were 17.88 and 6.20 fish/trapnet respectively for Carrie. The highest black bullhead catch rate was 147.40 fish/trapnet in 2002. <br> \n <br> \nCarp numbers were high in 2011 summer trapnets (2.00 fish/trapnet) and above the normal ranges for Carrie and similar lakes. Abundant numbers of carp of all sizes were observed during the 2010 fall electrofishing survey. The carp average size was small (3.77 pounds, 19.29 inches) in the 2011 summer trapnets. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye numbers were low to moderate (2.50 fish/gillnet) in the 2011 summer gillnets and within the normal ranges for Carrie and similar lakes. The walleye historical average catch rates are 3.14 fish/gillnet and 0.38 fish/trapnet. The walleye abundance in the 2006 summer gillnets was moderate (3.00 fish/gillnet, 2.28 pounds average weight) for Carrie. The 2011 summer walleye average sizes were 1.65 pounds and 2.72 pounds from gillnets and trapnets respectively. Historical average sizes for walleye were 2.19 pounds and 4.23 pounds from gillnets and trapnets respectively for Carrie. The catch rate of quality size (15.00 inches) and larger walleye was low (2.00 fish/gillnet) in 2011. Walleye growth rates were generally near the Spicer Area 50th quartiles for ages 1-8. The 2008 and 2009 year classes comprised the majority of the 2011 gillnet and trapnet catch in 2011. Walleye yearlings and adults were recently stocked in 2004 (1,440 fish, 120 pounds), 2006 (97 fish, 58 pounds), 2007 (125 fish, 50 pounds) and 2008 (448 fish, 112 pounds). Walleye frylings (8,496 fish) were stocked during early July of 2009 (8,496 fish) and 2011 (13,040 fish) in Carrie. <br> \n <br> \nAbundant numbers of young of year \"YOY\" walleye (58.42 YOY/hour, 6.58 inches average length) were captured in the 2011 fall electrofishing survey. Approximately 97% of the YOY walleye were OTC marked fish from a 2011 walleye fryling stocking. There were no YOY walleye captured in the 2010 (non stocked year) fall electrofishing survey. Abundant numbers of young of year \"YOY\" walleye (50.32 YOY/hour, 4.94 inches average length) were captured in the 2009 fall electrofishing survey (fryling stocked year). Approximately 50% of the 2009 YOY walleye captured were OTC marked fish from the 2009 fryling stocking. The unmarked fish observed in the 2009 fall probably moved into Carrie from connected Lake Elizabeth (2009 fry stocked). The walleye population present in Carrie had been primarily the result of fish movement from Elizabeth into Carrie during high water prior to 2009.  <br> \nGood walleye spawning habitat (wind-swept areas of rubble bars and points) is not present in Carrie.  <br> \n <br> \nCurrent fish management activities on Carrie include monitoring the fish population on a periodic basis, protecting aquatic vegetation through the permit process, participating in local watershed initiatives, assisting aquatic plant management and enforcement personnel in educating boaters and monitoring access sites for potential invasive species introductions, participating in the Sentinel Lakes Project, and stocking various fish species as warranted. Further Sentinel Lakes Project samplings are unknown for Carrie Lake as of 2012. Carrie Lake will be sampled for water quality, aquatic vegetation, and fish abundance during 2016 as part of the routine Spicer Area schedule.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Carrie Lake is part of a statewide, long-term monitoring program (SLICE) to document effects of climate change and other stressors on 25 lakes. A summer population assessment of Carrie was conducted on July 9-10, 2013 to evaluate bluegill, black crappie, yellow perch, northern pike and walleye populations. Point-intercept vegetation surveys were conducted throughout June of 2013 to monitor growth of curly-leaf pondweed. Spring and early summer was colder than normal in 2013, which delayed spawning behavior and resulted in decreased catches of bluegill, crappie species and largemouth bass in Carrie and other area lakes. <br> \n <br> \nCarrie is a small (81 acres), moderately deep (26 feet maximum), and moderately productive lake located in Kandiyohi County. Carrie is connected via the outlet to a large productive and shallow lake (Elizabeth) during high water levels. Fish movement between the two lakes is possible via the outlet channel during high flows. Submergent vegetation species and densities have been generally limited (water moss, coontail, sago pondweed) during past surveys in Carrie. Curly-leaf pondweed was present in numerous scattered stands and 10 of 60 points along near shore areas of the lake, especially along the north end of the lake in June of 2013. Curly-leaf pondweed was never sampled in lake surveys prior to 2010; however it was present at one point site during the June 2010 vegetation survey. Curly-leaf pondweed densities have been abundant in nearby Elizabeth and Ella during past years. Shoreland development is limited along Carrie. Moderate agricultural row crop runoff into Carrie occurs via several small inlets. The primary species managed in Carrie include walleye, largemouth bass, and black crappie. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike abundance in 2013 summer gillnets was high (14.00 fish/gillnet) and above the 75th quartiles for Carrie (0.25th=5.13, 50th=7.50, 75th=12.25 fish/gillnet) and Lake Class 31 lakes (75th=10.50 fish/gillnet). Northern pike numbers were also abundant (13.0 fish/gillnet) in the previous 2011 summer gillnet survey. The northern pike historical average catch rate is 8.25 fish/gillnet for Carrie. The 2013 northern pike average weight and length were 2.32 pounds and 22.15 inches respectively. The northern pike historical average weight is 2.72 pounds from gillnets. The largest northern pike sampled was 25.4 inches in the 2013 nets. There were three age classes present with the 2010 year class comprising 57% of the catch. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill abundance (9.6 fish/trapnet) in the 2013 summer trapnets was below the 50th quartiles for Carrie (25th=5.40, 50th=13.00, 75th=16.60 fish/trapnet) and Lake Class 31 lakes(50th=21.50 fish/trapnet). The bluegill historical average catch rate is 14.8 fish/trapnet. The 2013 bluegill average weight and length were 0.14 pounds and 5.73 inches respectively from summer trapnets. The bluegill historical average weight and length were 0.15 pounds and 5.21 inches from trapnets.  All bluegill aged in 2013 were 3 years old. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie abundance (7.4 fish/trapnet) in the 2013 summer trapnets was slightly above the 25th quartile for Carrie (25th=7.20, 50th=13.00, 75th=22.10 fish/trapnet), but above the 75th quartile (3.38 fish/trapnet) for Lake Class 31 lakes. High numbers of black crappie were captured in 2010 (60.20 fish/trapnet) and 2009 (26.00 fish/trapnet). Low numbers of black crappie were captured in the 2008 summer trapnets (0.60 fish/trapnet). Moderate black crappie numbers were present in the 2006 summer trapnets (10.80 fish/trapnet) and 2011 (13.00 fish/trapnet). The black crappie historical average catch rate is 18.24 fish/trapnet for Carrie. The 2013 black crappie average weight and length were 0.24 pounds and 7.53 inches from trapnets. The black crappie historical average weight is 0.21 pounds from trapnets. Black crappie abundance (5.00 fish/gill net) in 2013 gill nets was slightly lower that the 50th (25th=4.63, 50th=5.25, 75th=11.50 fish/gillnet) quartile for Carrie but above the 75th quartile (3.50 fish/gillnet) for Lake Class 31 lakes.  The 2013 black crappie average weight and length were 0.31 pounds and 7.86 inches from gillnets. The black crappie historical average weight is 0.21 pounds. White crappie were not sampled in the 2013 survey. <br> \n <br> \nBlack bullhead abundance (2.40 fish/trapnet) in the 2013 summer trapnets was above the 50th quartile (25th=0.20, 50th=1.40, 75th=8.10 fish/trapnet) for Carrie. Black bullhead abundance (28.00 fish/gillnet) in 2013 summer gill nets is just below the 75th quartile (25th=6.50, 50th=15.25, 75th=28.25 fish/gillnet) for Carrie.  Brown bullhead were absent in the 2013 summer nets. The black bullhead and brown bullhead historical average catch rates were 16.47 and 5.64 fish/trapnet respectively for Carrie. The highest black bullhead catch rate was 147.40 fish/trapnet in 2002. Brown bullhead were not sampled in the 2013 survey.   <br> \n <br> \nChannel catfish were sampled in gill nets for the first time in Carrie Lake in 2013.  One larger individual was captured weighing 9.37 pounds and measuring 24.8 inches. Channel catfish were sampled for the first time in connected Lake Elizabeth in 2011. <br> \n <br> \nCommon carp abundance in 2013 summer trapnets (1.00 fish/trapnet) was equal to the 75th quartile (25th=0.20, 50th=0.40, 75th=1.00 fish/trapnet) for Carrie and above the 75th quartile for Lake Class 31 lakes (75th=0.58 fish/trapnet). The common carp average size was small (3.90 pounds, 20.00 inches) in the 2013 summer trapnets.  Common carp abundance (5.00 fish/gillnet) in 2013 gillnets was equal to the 75th quartile (25th=0.38, 50th=2.00, 75th=5.00 fish/gillnet) for Carrie Lake.   <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance (0.40 fish/trapnet) in the 2013 summer trapnets was near the 50th quartiles for Carrie (25th=0.20, 50th=0.40, 75th=0.40 fish/trapnet) and Lake Class 31 lakes (50th=0.42 fish/trapnet). Walleye abundance (7.00 fish/gillnet) in the 2013 summer gillnets was above the 75th quartile (25th=2.38, 50th=3.25, 75th=4.63 fish/gillnet) for Carrie and Lake Class 31 lakes (75th=5.00 fish/gillnet). The walleye historical average catch rates are 3.63 fish/gillnet and 0.38 fish/trapnet. The walleye abundance in the 2011 summer gillnets was moderate (2.50 fish/gillnet, 1.65 pounds average weight) for Carrie. The 2013 summer walleye average sizes were 1.67 pounds and 0.75 pounds from gillnets and trapnets respectively. Historical average sizes for walleye were 2.13 pounds and 3.88 pounds from gillnets and trapnets respectively for Carrie. Walleye yearlings and adults were recently stocked in 2004 (1,440 fish, 120 pounds), 2006 (97 fish, 58 pounds), 2007 (125 fish, 50 pounds) and 2008 (448 fish, 112 pounds). Walleye frylings (8,496 fish) were stocked during early July of 2009 (8,496 fish), 2011 (13,040 fish) and 2013 (3,518 fish) in Carrie. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass and yellow perch were not sampled in 2013 gillnet and trapnets. <br> \n <br> \nAn Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) survey was done with 50 foot and 15 foot 1/8 inch mesh seines and a back pack electrofishing unit in early August of 2011. Generally, similar gamefish species were captured in Carrie summer gillnets and trapnets with IBI gears. In addition, IBI gears sampled other fish species such largemouth bass, yellow perch, bluntnose minnow, johnny darter, Iowa darter, spottail shiner, tadpole madtom and bowfin (dogfish) in 2013. <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A resurvey of Carrie was conducted in late June of 2006. Carrie is a small (81 acres) and moderately productive lake located in Kandiyohi County. The maximum depth is 26 feet. Development of the shoreline (10 homes/cabins) has remained relatively static for many years due to poor accessibility and low marsh areas adjacent to the lake. Shoalwater substrates consist primarily of silt, marl, muck, and sand. Emergent vegetation (cattails, bulrush) is commonly occurring along the entire shoreline. Submergent vegetation was lacking in Carrie during 2006. Water clarity is fair to poor (secchi=3.2 feet) due to algae blooms occurring during the late summer months. Water quality parameters measured included low levels of total phosphorus (0.016 ppm) and moderate levels of chlorophyll-a (6.1 ppb). The Carrie trophic status is mesotrophic based on total phosphorus and chlorophyll-a, but eutrophic based on secchi readings. Re-suspension of silt, muck and marl by carp contributes to the poor clarity and increased algae blooms in Carrie. Nutrient inflows from agricultural and residential sources into Carrie are relatively minor compared to other lakes within the watershed. Water levels were low during the 2006 summer. Carrie is connected to a large shallow and productive lake (Elizabeth) via an outlet channel during moderate/high water level conditions. Fish movement frequently occurs between these two lakes during the spring months. Walleye and northern pike have been observed spawning in or near the outlet channel adjacent to the two lakes. Lake Elizabeth is generally stocked with walleye fry every other year. Carrie was recently stocked in 1995 (44 adult northern pike), 2004 (1,440 walleye yearlings), and 2006 (97 walleye adults/yearlings).  <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie numbers were abundant in 2006 (10.80 fish/trapnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes. The black crappie historical average catch rate is 15.57 fish/trapnet. The black crappie average size was small to moderate (0.24 pounds and 7.74 inches from trapnets). The black crappie historical average weight is 0.26 pounds from trapnets. The catch rate of quality size (8.00 inches) or larger black crappie was moderate (4.20 fish/trapnet) in 2006. Black crappie growth rates in Carrie were within the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-4.  <br> \n <br> \nWhite crappie numbers were moderate to high (16.00 fish/gillnet) in 2006 compared to the Carrie historical average catch rate (14.75 fish/gillnet). The white crappie average size was small (0.10 pounds from gillnets). White crappie growth rates were near or below the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-3.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike numbers were moderate to high in 2006 (7.00 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes. The northern pike historical average catch rate is 6.50 fish/gillnet. The northern pike average size was moderate (3.11 pounds and 24.12 inches from gillnets). The northern pike historical average weight is 2.84 pounds from gillnets. The catch rate of quality size (21.00 inches) and larger northern pike was high (6.00 fish/gillnet) in 2006. Northern pike growth rates in Carrie were generally within the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-5. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch numbers were moderate to high in 2006 (16.50 fish/gillnet) compared to similar lakes. The yellow perch historical average catch rate is 10.08 fish/gillnet. The 2006 yellow perch average size was small (0.10 pounds and 6.51 inches from gillnets). The yellow perch historical average weight is 0.12 pounds from gillnets. Yellow perch growth rates were within the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-5.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye numbers were moderate in 2006 (3.00 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes. The walleye historical catch rate is 3.25 fish/gillnet. The 2006 walleye average size was moderate to large (2.48 pounds and 18.60 inches from gillnets). The walleye historical average weight is 2.28 pounds from gillnets. The catch rate of quality size (15.00 inches) and larger walleye was moderate (3.00 fish/gillnet) in 2006. Walleye growth rates were within the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-6. The 2003 year class (stocked year class) comprised the majority of the 2006 walleye catch.  <br> \n <br> \nBluegill numbers were moderate in 2006 (18.80 fish/trapnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes. The 2006 bluegill average size was small (0.13 pounds and 5.56 inches from trapnets). The bluegill historical average weight is 0.15 pounds from trapnets. The catch rate of quality size (6.00 inches) and larger bluegill was low to moderate (6.00 fish/trapnet) in 2006. Bluegill growth rates were within or above the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-5.  <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass numbers were moderate (38.40 fish/hour) in the 2006 spring electrofishing survey. An initial spring electrofishing survey of largemouth bass was conducted for Carrie in 1996 (1.33 fish/hour, 0.30 pounds average weight). The Spicer Area largemouth bass average catch rate is 46.60 fish/hour (1.23 pounds average weight). The 2006 largemouth bass average size was small (0.81 pounds and 9.33 inches from spring electrofishing). The catch rate of quality size (12.00 inches) and larger largemouth bass was moderate (12.00 fish/hour) in 2006. Largemouth bass growth rates were within the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-8. <br> \n <br> \nBlack bullhead numbers were abundant in 2006 (11.20 fish/trapnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes. The 2006 black bullhead average size was moderate (0.35 pounds and 8.64 inches from trapnets). The black bullhead historical average weight is 0.41 pounds from trapnets. <br> \n <br> \nCarp numbers were abundant in 2006 (8.00 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes. The 2006 carp average size was moderate to large (6.15 pounds and 18.76 inches from gillnets). The carp historical average weight was 2.88 pounds from gillnets. <br> \n <br> \nCurrent fish management activities on Carrie include monitoring the fish population on a periodic basis, protecting aquatic vegetation through the permit process, and stocking various fish species as warranted. The Carrie fishery will be surveyed in the 2011 summer for all fish species.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Carrie Lake is part of a statewide, long-term monitoring program (SLICE) to document effects of climate change and other stressors on 25 lakes. A standard survey of Carrie was conducted on June 20, 2016 to evaluate Bluegill, Black Crappie, Yellow Perch, Northern Pike and Walleye populations with gillnet and trapnets. Spring night electrofishing was conducted on May 31, 2016 to evaluate the Largemouth Bass population. A fall night electrofishing survey was conducted on September 8, 2016 to evaluate young of year \"YOY\" (fingerling sized) Walleye numbers due to a fryling stocking. <br> \n <br> \nCarrie is a small (89 acres), moderately deep (26 feet maximum), and moderately productive lake located in Kandiyohi County. Water clarity was 5.5 feet on June 20, 2016. Carrie is connected via the outlet to a large productive and shallow lake (Elizabeth) during high water levels. Fish movement between the two lakes is possible via the outlet channel during high flows. High water levels occurred during June-July of 2014 and fall of 2016. Submergent vegetation species and densities have been generally limited (water moss, coontail, sago pondweed) during past surveys in Carrie. Curly-leaf pondweed was present in numerous scattered stands and 10 of 60 points along near shore areas of the lake, especially along the north end of the lake in June of 2013. Curly-leaf pondweed was never sampled in lake surveys prior to 2010; however it was present at one point site during the June 2010 vegetation survey. Curly-leaf pondweed densities have been abundant in nearby Elizabeth and Ella during past years. Emergent vegetation consists of moderate sized stands of hardstem bulrush (east and north shore areas) and cattail species (south shore area). Shoreland development is limited along Carrie. Moderate agricultural row crop runoff flows into Carrie via several small inlets. The primary species managed in Carrie include Walleye, Largemouth Bass, and Black Crappie. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike numbers were low in the 2016 summer gillnet (4.00 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range of similar lakes. Northern Pike numbers were abundant in the previous 2011 (13.00 fish/gillnet) and 2013 (14.00 fish/gillnet) summer gillnet surveys. The Northern Pike historical average catch rate is 7.78 fish/gillnet for Carrie. The 2016 Northern Pike average size was small (2.78 pounds and 22.5 inches). The Northern Pike historical average weight is 2.73 pounds from gillnets. Growth rates were variable for ages 1-5. The 2013 year class comprised 80% of the 2016 Northern Pike survey catch. The largest Northern Pike sampled was 30.4 inches in the 2016 nets.  <br> \n <br> \nBluegill numbers were low (7.80 fish/trapnet) in the 2016 summer trapnets compared to the normal range for similar lakes and the historical average (14.22 fish/trapnet). The 2016 Bluegill average size was moderate to large (0.25 pounds and 6.5 inches) from trapnets. The Bluegill historical average weight and length were 0.16 pounds and 5.4 inches from trapnets. Growth rates were excellent for ages 1-6. The 2013 year class comprised 55% of the 2016 Bluegill survey catch. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie were abundant (25.00 fish/trapnet) in the 2016 summer trapnets compared to the normal range for similar lakes and the historical average (18.80 fish/trapnet). The 2016 Black Crappie average size was moderate (0.46 pounds and 9.3 inches) from trapnets. The Black Crappie historical average weight is 0.23 pounds from trapnets. Growth rates were moderate for ages 1-5. The 2013 and 2012 year classes comprised 67% and 20% respectively of the 2016 Black Crappie survey catch. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Bullhead numbers were low in the 2016 summer trapnets (1.00 fish/trapnet). The Black Bullhead average weight was large (0.97 pounds) in the 2016 trapnets. Brown and Yellow Bullhead were absent in the 2016 summer nets. The Black Bullhead historical average catch rate was 15.18 fish/trapnet for Carrie. The highest Black Bullhead catch rate was 147.40 fish/trapnet in 2002.   <br> \n <br> \nCommon Carp numbers were moderate in 2016 summer trapnets (1.40 fish/trapnet). The Common Carp average size was moderate (4.86 pounds, 21.3 inches) in the 2016 summer trapnets. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass numbers were low for Carrie (10.63 fish/hour) in the 2016 spring electrofishing survey. The Carrie historical average catch rate is 17.34 fish/hour. The 2016 average size was large (14.0 inches, 1.65 pounds) from spring electrofishing. The Largemouth Bass historical average weight and length are 1.06 pounds and 11.2 inches. The 2016 Largemouth Bass catch rate of 15.0 inches and larger fish was high (6.07 fish/hour) compared to the historical average (3.53 fish/hour). Largemouth Bass growth rates were excellent for ages 1-6.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch numbers were low in the 2016 gillnets (7.00 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes and the historical average (11.28 fish/gillnet). The 2016 Yellow Perch average size was moderate to large (7.72 inches and 0.24 pounds). The Yellow Perch historical average weight is 0.14 pounds from gillnets. Growth rates generally good for age 2 and older. The 2013 year class comprised 71% of the 2016 Yellow Perch survey catch.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye were abundant (11.00 fish/gillnet) in the 2016 summer gillnets compared to the normal range for similar lakes and the historical average (4.44 fish/gillnet). The 2016 Walleye average size was moderate (1.28 pounds and 15.1 inches). The 2016 Walleye catch rate of 15.0 inches and larger fish was moderate (5.00 fish/gillnet). Growth rates were generally good for Walleye in Carrie. The 2014 year class comprised 57% of the 2016 Walleye gillnet and trapnet catch. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye yearlings and adults were stocked in 2004 (1,440 fish), 2006 (97 fish), 2007 (125 fish) and 2008 (448 fish). Walleye oxytetracycline \"OTC\" marked fry were stocked as frylings (8,496 fish) during early July of 2009 (8,496 fish), 2011 (13,040 fish), 2013 (3,518 fish) and 2016 (15,220 fish) in Carrie. Walleye fry (47,541 fish) were stocked in 2014. <br> \n <br> \nA fall night electrofishing survey for YOY Walleye on Carrie Lake was conducted during September 8, 2016. Abundant YOY Walleye numbers (62.2 YOY/hour, 5.5 inches) were captured in 2016. OTC marked fish accounted for 90% of the 2016 fall YOY Walleye electrofishing catch. No yearling Walleye were captured in the 2016 fall electrofishing survey. Abundant YOY Walleye numbers (98.0 YOY/hour, 5.4 inches average length) were also captured in the 2014 fall electrofishing survey. Good Walleye spawning habitat (wind-swept areas of rubble bars and points) is not present in Carrie. Walleye spawning in the outlet adjacent to Lake Elizabeth has been noted in the past. The Walleye population present in Carrie had been primarily the result of fish movement from Elizabeth into Carrie during high water prior to 2009. <br> \n <br> \nCurrent fish management activities on Carrie include continued participation in the Sentinel Lakes Project, protecting the important aquatic habitats such as emergent and submergent vegetation through the permit process, assisting aquatic plant management and enforcement personnel in educating boaters and monitoring access sites for potential invasive species introductions, encouraging land owners to implement best management practices in the watershed, and stocking various fish species as warranted. All fish species will be sampled in 2021. Fall night electrofishing will be conducted during Walleye fryling/fry stocked years to assess the success or failure of the stockings. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Carrie Lake is small (81 acres) and moderately productive with a maximum depth of 26feet. About 25% of lake surface area is less than 15 feet deep. Water clarity was low tomoderate in 1996 (secchi disc=3.5 ft on 6/12/96, 4.5 ft on 6/20/96). Water clarity readingsfrom other surveys have ranged from 3.0 - 5.6 ft. Water quality measurements were taken on6/12/96 with the following results: pH=8.55, Total Alkalinity=186 ppm, Total DissolvedSolids=296, Conductivity 480 ppm, Total Phosphorus=0.056 ppm, Chlorophyll a=4.7 ppb. Waterquality results from the summer of 1984 were the following: pH=8.35, Total Alkalinity=185ppm, Total Dissolved Solids=290, Sulphate Ion=40 ppm, Total Phosphorus=0.025 ppm. Summerdissolved oxygen readings were below 5.0 ppm at a depth of 16 feet. Algae blooms are commonin Carrie Lake during the summer. Submergent vegetation is limited to water depths less thantwo feet. The most frequently occurring submergent species include coontail and water moss.Emergent vegetation such as hardstem bulrush and yellow waterlily stands are small, butscattered throughout the lake. The greatest density of emergent vegetation (common cattail)is located in the shallow south bay area. The shoalwater substrates are composed primarilyof silt, marl, sand, detritus, and clay. Natural reproduction is good for crappies, poor tonone for walleye, and fair for other species such as bluegill, largemouth bass, northernpike. There is potential for fish movement either way between Carrie and Lake Elizabethduring high/average water levels within the outlet creek. However, fish (northern pike,walleye, white sucker, carp) generally move upstream from Elizabeth into the marsh and Carrieoutlet area during the spring spawning season. There are 9 homes/cabins located on CarrieLake. Angling pressure is generally low on Carrie except when fishing is good for crappie andnorthern pike. The lake is managed for black crappie and northern pike for primary specieswith bluegill and largemouth bass as secondary species. Carrie Lake was stocked in the 1995winter with 44 adult (average size=0.9 lbs) northern pike.     A spring electrofishing survey was conducted on May 21, 1996 to assess the largemouthbass population. Only 1 largemouth bass (8.7 inches, 0.26 lbs) was caught during 45 minutesof electrofishing (1.3 fish/hour).     Black crappie abundance in 1996 (0.5 fish/gillnet, 0.8 fish/trapnet) was generally belowthe 1st and 3rd median interquartile range (0.8 - 7.7 fish/gillnet, 0.7 - 3.4 fish/trapnet)for Lake class 31. There were no white crappie captured in the 1996 survey. However, crappieabundance (black and white) in previous years had been higher (81.0 fish gillnet and 23.8fish/trapnet in 1989, 5.0 fish/gillnet and 17.2 fish/trapnet in 1984, 10.0 fish/gillnet and7.0 fish/trapnet). The 1996 average black crappie size (7.8 inches and 0.4 lbs from gillnetsand trapnets combined) was slightly above previous surveys (average=0.3 lbs.). The largestblack crappie caught in 1996 was 13.9 inches (1.5 lbs) and from the 1991 year class. Allother black crappie caught were from the 1994 year class. There were no young of year (YOY)crappies caught during the August shoreline seining survey.     Bluegill abundance in 1996 (57.4 fish/trapnet) was above the 1st and 3rd medianinterquartile range (6.1 - 46.6 fish/trapnet) for Lake Class 31 and above previous surveys(2.4 fish/trapnet in 1989, 3.2 fish/trapnet in 1984, 1.8 fish/trapnet in 1979). The 1996bluegill average size was small (4.3 inches, 0.07 lbs). The largest bluegill captured fromCarrie was 5.8 inches in 1996. The 1996 PSD and RSD-P was 0. Growth rates appear slightlybelow average compared to other area lakes. About 75% of bluegill captured were from the 1993year class. YOY bluegill numbers were moderate with 15.7 fish/seine haul during the 1996August seining survey.     Northern pike abundance in 1996 (5.5 fish/gillnet) was within the 1st and 3rd medianinterquartile range (3.5 - 10.5 fish/gillnet) for Lake Class 31 and similar to the historicalaverage (5.0 fish/gillnet). The 1996 average size (25.9 inches, 4.3 lbs from gillnets) wasabove the historical average (2.8 lbs from gillnets). The largest fish caught from Carrie was33.9 inches (9.7 lbs). The 1996 PSD and RSD-P was 91% and 27% respectively. Growth ratesappear good for northern pike in Carrie. About 36% of northern pike catch belonged to the1993 year class.     Walleye abundance in 1996 (0.5 fish/gillnet) was below the 1st and 3rd medianinterquartile range (1.3 - 5.0 fish/gillnet) for Lake Class 31 and below the historicalaverage (3.25 fish/gillnet). Carrie has not been stocked with walleye since the early 1970's,however, walleye that are attracted to the inflow of the creek have been observed movingupstream from Elizabeth into the Carrie outlet area during the spring spawning season. Mostwalleye present in Carrie are probably a result of movement from Elizabeth during the springspawning season or during winters with low dissolved oxygen levels in Elizabeth. Naturalreproduction of walleye within Carrie Lake itself probably does not occur or is insignificantdue to lack of suitable substrates (gravel/rubble shoalwater areas). Rubble and gravel islimited to the fish trap area within the Carrie outlet creek, thus natural reproduction isprobably only fair to poor during most years within the outlet area.     Yellow perch abundance in 1996 (7.0 fish/gillnet) was within the 1st and 3rd medianinterquartile range (3.4 - 43.6 fish/gillnet) for Lake Class 31 and similar to the historicalaverage (6.6 fish/gillnet). The 1996 average size was 6.0 inches. Growth rates appearslightly below average for area lakes. About 71% of the yellow perch belonged to the 1994year class. YOY yellow perch numbers were moderate to low with 12.3 fish/seine haul from the1996 August seining survey.     Black bullhead abundance in 1996 (0.2 fish/trapnet) was below the 1st and 3rd medianinterquartile range (0.3 - 3.2 fish/trapnet) and below the historical average (4.6fish/trapnet). The 1996 average size (0.45 lbs) was similar to the historical average (0.5lbs).     Carp abundance in 1996 (2.0 fish/gillnet) was slightly above the 1st and 3rd medianinterquartile range (0.2 - 1.5 fish/gillnet) for Lake Class 31 and the slightly above thehistorical average (1.8 fish/gillnet). The 1996 average size was 3.2 lbs.     Carrie Lake is a popular crappie/northern pike fishery. Local reports indicate thatnorthern pike fishing success increased in 1995-96. There have also been reports of sporadicwinter ice fishing success for black crappie during recent years. Fisheries management goalsfor Carrie include: maintaining/expanding emergent vegetation stands (hardstem bulrush,yellow waterlily); enhancing submergent vegetation growth within the lake by improving waterclarity; periodic stocking of winter rescue northern pike (put and take fishery) into Carrie;reducing nutrient inputs by encouraging local landowners to practice best land managementpractices (conservation tillage, nutrient management, restricting cattle from the lake,septic system compliance; reducing lawn fertilizer use, etc.) within the watershed andsurrounding lakeshore areas.</p>",
