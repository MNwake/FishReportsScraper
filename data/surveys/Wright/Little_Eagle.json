Largemouth Bass numbers are high at 2.3/trap net. Growth was good. Bluegill abundance (39.3/trap net) is twice the local average. Ages 2-8 were present; growth was slow but fish up to 8 inches were caught. Hybrid Sunfish numbers are about average for this area. Black Crappie numbers are low, growth appears average, but only two age classes were caught. Brown and Yellow Bullheads are present in above average numbers. Browns to 14 inches were caught. Bowfin were caught in average numbers. Yellow Perch are present but were not caught in nets. Overall, the fish population was similar to adjacent Eagle Lake.</p>",
