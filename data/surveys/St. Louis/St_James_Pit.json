Its main access is a concrete ramp along the southeast shore just north of the town of Aurora.  This 100 acre lake has a maximum depth of 381 feet and the water is very clear.\n\nOn June 10, 2013 the water temperature ranged from 60 F at the surface to 39 F at 100 feet.  Oxygen levels were adequate for trout throughout this range.  This population assessment consisted of 6 gillnets which captured two fish species, rainbow trout and white sucker.\n\nStocking of trout on St. James Pit began in 1984 when lake trout and rainbow trout were introduced.  From 1986 to 1996 rainbows and brookies were the only species being stocked.  No trout were introduced from 1997 to 2002.  Since 2003, the Iron Range Resources and Rehabilitation Board (IRRRB) has taken over the stocking by providing funds and arranging to privately stock rainbows. This has freed up fish in the DNR quota, so another local designated stream trout lake can be stocked. Typically, the IRRRB has stocked the pit twice every year in the spring and fall.\n\nThe rainbow trout gill net catch rate in 2013 was 1.2 fish/net or 0.9 pounds of fish/net. Lengths ranged from 7 to 18 inches with an average of 10 inches.  The average length is also slightly lower than the historical average (11 inches) and the lowest on record for the pit.  Fish weights averaged 0.8 pounds/fish.  \n\nEleven white suckers were sampled for a catch rate of 1.8 fish/net.  Lengths ranged from 6 to 18 inches with an average of 13 inches which is similar to historical averages. No other fish species were surveyed.\n</p>",
