FISH RANGED FORM 3.0-7.9 LENGTH, WITH A MEDIAN OF 6.0-6.4 INCHES, PSD OF 78.3%, WITH A RSD=12.4%.  THREE YOUNG-OF-YEAR WERE SAMPLED IN THE SEINE HAULS.  BLG WERE SAMPLED IN THE HIGHEST NUMBERS ON RECORD.  BLC WERE SAMPLED IN NUMBERS GREATER THAN 7 TIMES THE LOCAL MEDIAN FOR GILL NETS AND 1/2 THE LOCAL MEDIAN FOR TRAP NETS.  LENGTHS RANGED FROM 3.5-9.4 OF 4.0-4.4 INCHES, A RSD=5.4%, AND AN AVERAGE RATE OF 12.1 FISH PER POUND.  THE NUMBER OF BLC SAMPLED WAS ALSO THE HIGHEST ON RECORD.  LMB WERE PRIMARILY SAMPLED WITH ELECTROFISHING GEAR, WITH 51 FISH CAPTURED.  TEN MORE FISH WERE SAMPLED FROM GILL AND TRAPNETS.  SEINING ALSO ACCOUNTED FOR 3 ADULT BASS, ALONG WITH 10 YOY.  FISH RANGED IN SIZE FROM 2.3-20.4 INCHES, WITH A MEDIAN SIZE GROUP OF 7.0-7.4 INCHES.  PSD WAS CALCULATED AT 62.5%.  GROWTH WAS AVERAGE THROUGH AGE VI, WITH ALL AGES REPRESENTED, AND ABOVE AVERAGE FOR SUBSEQUENT AGES.  NOP WERE SAMPLED AT TWICE THE LOCAL GILL NET MEDIAN, AND 1/2 THE LOCAL TRAP NET MEDIAN.  FISH RANGED IN SIZE FROM 16.0-23.9 INCHES WITH A CALCULATED RSD=30.0%.  GROWTH WAS AVERAGE FOR ALL AGES WITH AGE II+ PIKE DOMINATING THE SAMPLE.  YEB WERE SAMPLED ABOVE MEDIAN LEVELS FOR ALL TYPES OF SAMPLING GEAR.  MEDIAN SIZE RANGE WAS 10.0-10.4 INCHES AND AVERAGE RATE WAS 1.6 FISH PER POUNDS.  BOTH YEB AND NOP NUMBERS HAVE RECOVERED TO NEAR NORMAL HISTORIC LEVELS AFTER BEING QUITE LOW DURING THE 1986 SURVEY.  BLB AND CAP WERE SAMPLED BELOW MEDIAN LEVELS.  ABUNDANCE OF BOTH SPECIES HAVE INCREASED STEADILY WITH EACH SAMPLING YEAR.  GOS, HSF, GSF, AND PMK AND YEP WERE ALSO SAMPLED DURING THIS ASSESSMENT.  YEP WERE SAMPLED BELOW MEDIAN GILLNET LEVELS.</p>",
