                "narrative": "<p>North Center Lake is a 725 acre, fertile lake, managed primarily for largemouth bass and walleye.  The lake is stocked annually with walleye fingerlings.  The shoreline is predominately sand while the water clarity can be low due to algae blooms.  The lake, popular with anglers and boaters, receives high user pressure.  The public access, though large, can be filled to capacity at times.  Two hundred seventy lake homes make for a highly developed shoreline.  During the summer of 2005, the culvert connecting North and South Center lakes was replaced with a more navigation friendly bridge.  At normal water levels, this will provide easier travel between the lakes.  In keeping with the current lake management plan, a lake assessment was conducted to evaluate long range goals.  The assessment consisted of night electrofishing on May 19th and gill and trap netting the week of August 23rd. <br> \n <br> \nThe lake supports a quality sized walleye population at abundance levels typical of the lake type.  Walleye sampled during the survey averaged 19.3 inches and 3.1 pounds with lengths ranging from 7.4 to 26.8 inches.  <br> \n      <br> \nNorthern pike were slightly less abundant than walleye but also of quality size.  Netted pike averaged 31.9 inches and 6.4 pounds.  In 2003, a special northern pike regulation was implemented following a public input meeting.  Northerns between 24 and 36 inches are now protected from harvest.  The regulation goal is to encourage the continued harvest of smaller northerns while increasing the lake's potential to produce trophy sized fish. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass were abundant with an 11 inch and 0.8 pound average.  Sampled bass ranged from 5.3 to 19.2 inches.  Bass quality has slipped a little since the previous assessment.  Just under one fourth of the catch in the recent assessment exceeded 12 inches in length compared to half the sample in 2005. <br> \n <br> \nBoth bluegill and black crappie numbers were high compared to similar lakes.  Size acceptance may be an issue with some anglers.  Crappie averaged 7.3 inches but relatively few passed the 8 inch mark.  While most bluegill surpassed 6 inches, very few attained 7 inches. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers on North Center Lake can expect heavy fishing pressure and a crowded public access at times.  The majority of the pressure is directed toward bass and panfish.  Bass, bluegill, and crappie are abundant.  Northern pike and walleye, though less common, present a bonus fishery of large individuals.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>  In July of 1990 a population assessment was conducted on North Center Lake to assess the fish population status.  Netting consisted of 12 gillnet and 8 trapnet sets and shoreline seining efforts.  Based on the results of these efforts, the status of the fish population compared to previous surveys and to lakes of the same classification statewide are as follows:\n  The walleye (7.58/set) net catch has shown a real increase from the net catch of the previous survey in 1985 (4.67/set).  This was the highest net catch recorded in all surveys dating back to 1956.  The 1990 catch was above the statewide median catch (1.87/set) and the third quartile (3.35/set).  The length frequency distribution ranged from 6.5 - 25.9 inches with a median length group of 11.5 - 11.9 inches.  The mean weight of 1.36 pounds.  Of all age classes sampled (I-XII), ages III and X were not represented in the net catches.  Analysis of back-calculated lengths show that walleyes in this lake grow at rates similar to statewide average rates.  The walleye population is largely composed of stocked fish with minor natural reproduction a possibility.\n  The northern pike (1.42/set) net catch showed a real decrease from the 1985 catch (2.75/set).  This catch was below both the statewide median (6.50/set) and the first quartile (3.33/set).  The lengths ranged from 16.0 - 36.9 inches with a median length group of 23.0 - 23.9 inches.  The mean weight was 3.36 pounds.  Age classes II-VIII, except age VII, were represented by the sample taken from net catches.  Analysis of back-calculated lengths show that northern pike in this lake grow at rates similar to statewide average rates.  Northern pike fingerlings were last stocked in 1975.  This suggests that natural reproduction within the watershed made up the established northern pike population.\n  The bluegill (82.62/set) net catch was similar to the previous survey catch (75.00/set) and was well above the statewide median and third quartile, 11.88/set and 31.00/set, respectively.  Bluegill catches in both gillnets and trapnets were historically considered high in past surveys.  The 1990 length frequency distribution ranged from 4.5 - 7.9 inches with a median length group of 6.5 - 6.9 inches.  The mean weight was 0.18 pounds.  Growth rates were normal when compared to statewide averages.\n  The black crappie (52.75/set) catch was also higher than the previous survey, statewide median, and third quartile, (10.71/set, 2.50/set, and 4.40/ set), respectively.  Like the bluegill, the black crappie gillnet and trapnet catches have historically been considered high.  The 1990 length frequency distribution ranged from 5.5 - 9.4 inches with a median length group of 6.5 - 6.9 inches.  The mean weight was 0.22 pounds.  Growth rates were normal when compared to statewide averages.\n  The largemouth bass (0.25/set) net catch was slightly below the 1985 catch (0.29/set) and statewide median (0.29/set).  The gillnet catch (0.42/set) was higher than all previously recorded gillnet catches and was above the statewide median (0.33/set) but below the third quartile (1.00/set).  Shoreline seining efforts recorded 31 young-of-year in a 0.28 acre area.\n The yellow perch (8.58/set) net catch was a real increase from the previous survey catch (3.88/set).  This was just above the first quartile (3.83/set) but falls below the statewide median (10.00/set.)  The median length group was 6.0 - 6.4 inches and the mean weight was 0.10 pounds.  They have generally maintained populations from low to moderate levels.\n  The golden shiner (13.67/set) net catch was up from the previous survey (4.83/set) and above the statewide median and third quartile, 3.33 set and 5.83/set, respectively.  The median length group was 7.0 - 7.4 inches and the mean weight was 0.13 pounds.\n  Eight (8) other species recorded in the gillnets and trapnets included: bowfin, white sucker, black bullhead, yellow bullhead, brown bullhead, hybrid sunfish, green sunfish, and pumpkinseed sunfish.  Three (3) of these species, white sucker yellow and brown bullhead, were below their respective first quartiles.  The remaining five species were at typical net catches when compared to their statewide medians.\n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>North Center Lake is located within Center City and connected to South Center Lake by a navigable channel. The lake receives heavy angling pressure. North Center is managed primarily for Walleye and Northern Pike, with Largemouth Bass, Bluegill, and Black Crappie as secondary species.   Angler concern over statewide declines in Northern Pike quality called for additional special regulations in the early 2000's. A public meeting regarding Northern Pike management on North Center took place in the fall of 2002. The consensus was to implement a 24 to 36 inch protected slot limit starting in 2003. <br> \n <br> \nAn ice out trap netting survey was conducted on North Center Lake during the middle of April 2022 to attain length frequencies of pike in order to evaluate the effectiveness of the protected slot limit. Sixty trap net lifts over a 6 day period sampled 72 Northern Pike. Pike ranged from 15.1 to 39.8 inches in length and averaged 27.2 inches. The special regulation in place will protect medium sized fish until they attain a large size for anglers while allowing harvest of the numerous smaller fish.  Anglers can expect to catch moderate numbers of smaller sized Northern Pike with the opportunity to catch and release good numbers of fish within the protected slot. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>North Center Lake is a 725 acre, fertile lake, managed primarily for largemouth bass and walleye.  The lake has been stocked biennially since 1995 with walleye fingerlings.  The shoreline is predominately sand while the water clarity can be low due to algae blooms.  The lake is popular with anglers and boaters and receives high user pressure.  The public access, though large, can be filled to capacity at times.  Two hundred seventy lake homes make for a highly developed shoreline.  During the summmer of 2005, the culvert connecting North and South Center lakes was being replaced with a more navigation friendly bridge which should provide easier travel between the lakes.  In keeping with the current lake management plan, a lake survey was conducted the week of August 1st, 2005 utilizing gill nets, trap nets, seining, and electrofishing.     The lake supports a quality sized walleye population at abundance levels typical of the lake type.  Walleye sampled during the survey averaged 19 inches and 2.8 pounds with lengths ranging from 10.3 to 23.9 inches.      Northern pike were slightly more abundant than walleye and also of quality size.  Netted pike averaged 28.3 inches and 5.4 pounds.  In 2003, a special northern pike regulation was implemented following a public input meeting.  Northerns between 24 and 36 inches are now protected from harvest.  The regulation goal is to allow the continued harvest of smaller northerns while increasing the lakes potential to produce trophy sized fish.     Largemouth bass were abundant with a 12.3 inch and 1.3 pound average.  Sampled bass ranged from 6.5 to 19.7 inches with half the catch 12 inches or more in length.     Bluegill were less abundant than in past assessments while black crappie numbers were high.  Both are plentiful and should be of acceptable size to anglers.  Crappie averaged nearly 8 inches while most bluegill were over 6.5 inches.  Overall, panfish size is higher than in past samples.     Anglers on North Center Lake can expect heavy fishing pressure and a crowded public access at times.  The majority of the pressure is directed at bass and panfish.  Bass, bluegill, and crappie are abundant.  Northern pike and walleye, while less abundant present a bonus fishery of large individuals.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>North Center Lake in in lake class 35 and is primarily managed for Walleye and Largemouth Bass. It is a 725 acre fertile lake located partially within Center City and connected to South Center Lake by a navigable channel. The lake receives high angling pressure due to a large public access, a high number of residences on the lake, and its proximity to the metropolitan area. Angler concern over statewide declines in Northern Pike quality, led to a public meeting regarding North Center in the fall of 2002.  The consensus was to implement a 24 to 36 inch protected slot limit starting in 2003. A partial winterkill occurred early in 2014 and Walleye fry and fingerlings were stocked that spring. Walleye fry are now stocked at a rate of 1000 per littoral acre in even numbered years. Electrofishing targeting Largemouth Bass and netting with gill nets and trap nets was conducted in June 2017. The previous survey occurred in 2010.  <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled Northern Pike at a rate of 14.3 fish per net which exceeded the 75th percentile for the lake class. This is the highest recorded catch of Northern Pike in North Center Lake which has historically had catch rates below average for its lake class. Mean size surpassed the 75th percentile for the lake class but was small relative to the last several surveys. Pike ranged from 15.2 to 37.3 inches in length and averaged 21.5 inches. Large fish are present at numbers similar to previous surveys but the number of fish 22 inches and smaller has substantially increased. This appears to be due to an increase in recruitment starting with the 2011 year class. It has been suspected that low recruitment in the past has been exasperated by extremely low water levels. Now that the lake is near the ordinary water level there is likely excellent spawning habitat available which had led to a boom in recruitment. Growth rates of these younger and more abundant fish are unimpressive. It remains to be seen if these levels of recruitment are temporary or if they will be sustained. The recent winterkill did not seem to have a negative impact on the pike population and the special regulation in place will protect medium fish until they attain a large size for anglers while allowing harvest of the numerous smaller fish.  The long range goal for Northern Pike is currently being exceeded for abundance and on target for average size.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye were sampled at the highest rate in two decades with 4.5 fish per net. This is above the third quartile for this lake class. Mean size was also larger than average but smaller than the lower density populations sampled in several previous surveys. Fish ranged from 10 to 26 inches and averaged 16.7 inches in length. Forty seven out of fifty two Walleyes are assigned to the 2014 year class and were approximately 15 to 18 inches long. This is impressive growth and likely due to a lack of competition for a high density stocking following the recent winterkill. Fish not belonging to the 2014 year class may have survived the winterkill or emigrated from South Center Lake. A subsequent stocking in 2015 did not show up in the survey and may have been suppressed by the numerous 2014 year class. The population is nearing the long term management goals for the lake.  <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie were abundant in trap nets with 7.9 fish per net, above the 75th percentile for the lake class. This was slightly higher than the previous survey but typical for the history of the lake. Mean size was average for the lake class with fish ranging from 3.4 to 11 inches with a mean of 8.2 inches. Several crappie were aged and were found to be from either the 2011 or 2014 year class. This correlated with the size distribution showing two large groupings of fish around 7.5 and 10 inches. While recruitment may be sporadic, fast growth should compensate for any gaps in the size distribution and provide a biologically balanced population with plenty of different sizes available for anglers.  <br> \n <br> \nBluegill trap net catch increased substantially from the previous survey and at 52.4 fish per net was twice as high as the third quartile for the lake class. Mean weight was typical for the lake class and fish ranged from 1 to 8.7 inches. Fish were fairly evenly spread throughout this range but high fishing pressure and angler harvest will likely prevent much growth on the upper end of that range.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch catch was typical for the lake and lake class with 8.5 fish per net. These fish had an unremarkable size distribution with individual from 4.6 to 9.6 inches and averaging 6.5 inches long. This is a significant improvement from the previous survey however where only 12 perch were sampled.  <br> \n <br> \nNight time electrofishing sampled Largemouth Bass at a rate of 137 per hour which was similar to the previous survey. Mean weight was typical for the lake at 0.98 lbs. and a slight improvement from 2010. Mean length was 11.7 inches with a range from 5.6 to 17.9. Forty three percent of fish were longer than 12 inches and eighteen percent were longer than 14 inches, leaving some room for improvement on the upper end of the size structure. The long range goal for catch rate was met though.  <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled were Black, Brown, and Yellow Bullhead, Bowfin, Common Carp, Golden Shiner, Green Sunfish, Hybrid Sunfish, Pumpkinseed, and White Sucker.       <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey was conducted on North Center Lake July 15-16, 2019 by Fisheries Lake Index of Biological Integrity (FIBI) program staff. Nearshore components targeted small-bodied fish and included seining and backpack electrofishing. Fourteen sampling stations were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at all fourteen stations, however two stations were sampled from the boat due to site conditions. A 50-foot seine was used to sample three stations, a 15-foot seine was used at five stations, and dense emergent vegetation and soft substrate prevented the use of a seine at four sites.  <br> \n <br> \nA summer trap net survey was conducted July 15-17 by Fisheries Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program Staff in conjunction with the targeted survey of the nearshore fish community. Twelve trap nets were set along the shoreline in locations that encompassed multiple habitat types. Bluegill were the most abundant species by number.  Common Carp were the most abundant species by biomass, followed by Bluegill, Bowfin, and Black Crappie. <br> \n <br> \nNearshore and trap net sampling captured 18 native species of fish including three species that are tolerant of disturbance (Black Bullhead, Common Carp, and Green Sunfish) and none that are intolerant of disturbance.  <br> \n <br> \nData from this nearshore and trap net survey is combined with data from a standard gill net survey from June 2017 to calculate a Fish-based Index of Biological Integrity (FIBI) score that describes the overall health of the lake. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment. In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g. Banded Killifish and Iowa Darter), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g. Black Bullhead and Green Sunfish). The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.  <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey indicates North Center Lake is in poor health as indicated by a FIBI score below the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes. Data from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Lower St. Croix River Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>North Center Lake is managed by the DNR as a walleye-northern pike lake with largemouth bass, bluegill sunfish, and crappie as secondary species.  North Center has a history of abundant populations of smaller-sized crappie and bluegill. Walleye fingerlings have been stocked regularly since the late 1970's.  DNR fisheries crews conducted a lake survey in the summer of 1995 using electrofishing, gill nets, trap nets, and shoreline seining to sample fish populations.     Northern pike maintain low to moderate numbers in North Center Lake due to natural reproduction.  Since northern pike spawning success depends on water levels in early spring, it can vary greatly from year to year. 1992 was a particularly good year for northern pike spawning; fish from this year-class are now approaching 1 1/2 to 2 pounds, which was the average size of northerns in the 1995 survey.     Walleye numbers were higher in the 1995 survey than in any previous survey on this lake.  Numbers of walleye have been higher than average for this lake type since 1982, several years after regular stocking began.  The average weight of walleyes from the 1995 survey was 1.7 pounds, which is about a 16 1/2 inch walleye.  Sizes ranged from 10-24 inches.     Largemouth bass are abundant in all of the Chisago area lakes, but North Center had the highest bass catch of any area lake when it was sampled by electrofishing in early June.  Sizes tend to be small, though, with the average bass weighing under a pound.  The largest bass seen were sixteen inches, or about 2 1/2 pounds.     Black crappie and bluegill sunfish were both less abundant than they have been in previous surveys, but their numbers are still above average.  The average length for both species was six inches, which most anglers would consider to be small. Occasionally, however, good numbers of 9-10 inch crappies can be caught.     Other species present in North Center Lake include bullhead, bowfin (dogfish), golden shiner, white sucker, pumpkinseed sunfish, and common carp.  1995 was the first year carp were seen in DNR nets, but they are believed to have been in this lake since the high water period of 1986.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>North Center Lake is managed primarily for northern pike and walleye.  The 725 acre fertile basin is in lake class 35.  In keeping with the current lake management plan, a population assessment was conducted to evaluate the long range management goals.  The assessment consisted of night electrofishing on May 8, gillnetting and trapnetting from July 31 to August 4, and shoreline seining on September 21, 2000.          Based on the gillnet catch, the walleye and the northern pike populations were both comprised of exceptionally large fish in moderate abundance.  Walleye and northern catches, 1.9 and 4.7 per set respectively, were in the normal range for the lake class.  Walleye averaged 22.2 inches and 4.1 pounds while northerns averaged 26.9 inches and 4.7 pounds.  Both species fell short of the long range goal for catch rate but exceeded the goal for weight.           Conversely, the bluegill and black crappie trapnet catches consisted of moderate sized fish in high abundance.   Bluegill and black crappie trapnet catches, 129.6 and 50.9 per set respectively, were above normal for the lake class.  Bluegill averaged 6.2 inches while crappies averaged 7.2 inches.  Young-of-year of both species were sampled in the seine hauls.            Fifty two minutes of night electrofishing sampled 62 largemouth bass for a catch rate of 70.9 per hour, a appreciable decrease from the 281.8 per hour reported in 1995.  The 1995 catch was dominated by three extremely strong year classes of young fish.  Electrofished bass had means of 11.4 inches and 1.1 pounds compared to 10.4 and 0.7 in 1995.  The 1993 year class was substantial in both the 1995 and 2000 assessments.  One hundred thirty one young-of-year bass were sampled in the seine hauls.  The long range management goal of 100 bass per hour of electrofishing was not met in the 2000 assessment.          The yellow perch population appears to have collapsed.  Only 6 perch were taken in the gillnets and none in the trapnets.  The 6 sampled perch were between 5.4 and 6.4 inches.  Four young-of-year perch were taken in the seine hauls.          The black bullhead gillnet catch was above normal for only the second time.  The catch rate of 31.3 per set was the highest recorded for North Center Lake.  Black bullheads ranged in length from 9.3 to 14.6 inches with an average of 11.2 inches.  The average weight was 0.8 pounds, also above normal for the lake class.                 Other species sampled during the survey included;  bowfin, golden shiner, spottail shiner, common carp, white sucker, brown bullhead, yellow bullhead, hybrid sunfish, green sunfish, pumpkinseed, johnny darter, painted turtle, snapping turtle, softshell turtle.          Anglers on North Center Lake should expect heavy fishing pressure and a crowded public access at times.  The majority of the pressure is directed at bass and panfish.  Bass, bluegill, and crappie are abundant.  Northern pike and walleye, while less abundant, present a bonus fishery of large individuals.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>North Center Lake is a 725-acre lake located in Chisago County. The lake is managed primarily for Largemouth Bass and Walleye, with Northern Pike and Bluegill as the secondary species. North Center Lake suffered a winterkill event in March 2014. An electrofishing assessment was done shortly after ice out in 2014. The following species were observed in the evaluation: Largemouth Bass, Black Crappie, Bowfin, Black Bullhead, Black Crappie, Northern Pike, Common Carp, and Bluegill. Based on catches in this assessment it appears as if the populations of most species have returned to pre-winterkill levels. <br> \n <br> \nThe Walleye gill net (GN) catch rate in 2021 was 5 fish per net. This was above the previous survey's catch and above the long-term average catch rate of 3.4 fish per gill net. Mean length of Walleye in gill nets was 21.8 inches, with a range of 15.6 to 27.8 inches.  The Walleye population is maintained through fry stocking biennially in even-numbered years. Based on the 2021 GN catch it would appear the Walleye population is in good shape.   <br> \n <br> \nThe Northern Pike gill net catch rate was 6.1 fish per net. This catch was above the the long term average, but below the 2017 catch rate of 14.3 per net. Mean length of Northern Pike in gill nets was 25.6 inches, with a range of 18.5 to 34.7 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch have historically fluctuated in abundance in North Center Lake. The 2021 catch rate was one of the highest across the last fourteen surveys on the lake. The catch rate was 12.2 per gill net in 2021, exceeding the historic average catch rate of 9.7 per net.  Most of the fish were between 5.5 and 6.9 inches, so they are on the small side for angler harvest but they do provide a solid forage base for the Walleye and Northern Pike in the lake. <br> \n <br> \nBased on the 2021 gill net catch of Black Crappie, the abundance was below average for North Center Lake but within the normal range for similar lakes. The gill net catch rate was up substantially since the 2017 survey, but far from the catch rates of the early 2000s. Crappies caught in the gill nets ranged in length from 5.3 to 8.9 inches with a 7.1 inch average. In addition to the fish caught in gill nets, Black Crappies were captured in the trap nets. The average size of these fish was 7.4 inches with a length range of 4.2 to 9.5 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nTrap nets were used during the population assessment to estimate Bluegill abundance and size range. The 2021 catch rate was 144.2 per trap net. The 2021 catch was the most caught in any survey dating back to 1956 in both number and catch rate. Bluegill sampled in trap nets ranged in size from 3.5 to 7.8 inches with most fish from 6.0 to 6.9 inches in length. The mean length was 6.1 inches as compared to a mean length of 6.4 inches in 2017. In addition to the fish caught in trap nets, Bluegill were also captured in the gill nets. The average size of these fish was 5.7 inches with a length range of 3.5 to 8.0 inches. There is currently a large population of Bluegill, although they are running slightly smaller than in previous surveys. <br> \n <br> \nThe Largemouth Bass catch rate decreased from 137.5 per hour in 2017 to 55.3 per hour in 2021. Mean length was 12.2 inches with a length range of 7.8 to 18.5 inches. In 2017 the average length was 11.7 inches and lengths ranged from 5.6 to 18.0 inches. Even though the catch of Largemouth Bass decreased since 2017, there are still likely plenty of fish for anglers to catch and the average size was slightly larger in 2021. <br> \n <br> \nOverall, the fishing on North Center Lake for many species should be quite good. There are good numbers of Yellow Perch, Bluegill, Black Crappie, Largemouth Bass, Walleye, and Northern Pike based on this survey.   <br> \n</p>",

The northern pike was slightly low at 2.75 fish per set but with an average weight of 3.16 pounds.  The yellow perch was very low at 3.83 while the golden shiner was slightly high at 4.83.  The bluegill was very high at 75.00 per set and of small to average size.  The largemouth bass was slightly low while the pumpkinseed and hybrid sunfish were low and of small size. The black crappie at 10.71 per set was slightly low and of small to average size.  The black bullhead was very low in the trapnets but only slightly low in the gillnet catch.  The brown bullhead was low while the yellow bullhead was slightly low.  All bullheads were of good size.  The white sucker was low while the bowfin showed high population figures.  NOTE:  Since the 1982 population assessment, there has been a significant drop in northern pike and yellow perch populations and no significant change in the walleye population.</p>",

Fourteen sampling sites were evenly spaced around the shoreline and each site was sampled by electrofishing, and/or seining.  Nearshore sampling captured 14 species of fish; Bluegill, Largemouth Bass, Pumpkinseed, Hybrid Sunfish, Green Sunfish, Yellow Perch, Bluntnose Minnow, Spotfin Shiner, Brown Bullhead, Golden Shiner, Iowa Darter, Northern Pike, Black Crappie, Johnny Darter. <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore fish survey data is combined with gill net and trap net data from the July 2019 lake survey to describe the fish community and provide a fish-based Index of Biotic Integrity (FIBI) score based on expectations for similar lakes.  The FIBI score for North Center Lake based on this survey is below the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes. <br> \n <br> \nThis survey is contributing to a watershed assessment process in coordination with the MN Pollution Control Agency. North Center Lake is located in the Lower St. Croix River Watershed.  For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website. <br> \n</p>",
