ALTHOUGH THE WAE CPUE HAS FLUCTUATED SINCE 1977, THE TREND HAS BEEN STRONGLY DOWNWARD.  WAE TAKEN IN THIS SURVEY RANGED FROM 10 TO 17 IN.  SEVERAL YEAR CLASSES WERE WEAK OR MISSING, WITH THE 1988 YEAR CLASS THE STRONGEST.  GROWTH OF AGE III FISH WAS BELOW AVERAGE FOR COOK COUNTY.  ASSESSMENTS ON POPLAR LAKE IN 1955 AND 1959 REPORTED GOOD NATURAL REPRODUCTIN OF WAE; HOWEVER, ASSESSMENTS SINCE HAVE PROVIDED STRONG EVIDENCE THE NATURAL REPRODUCTION IS VERY LIMITED.  THE 1963 ASSESSMENT FOUND A CPUE FOR WAE OF ONLY 0.8 FISH/GILL NET FOLLOWING SEVERAL YEARS WITH NO STOCKING.  IN ADDITION, YOY ASSESSMENTS FORM 1970 THROUGH 1987 FOUND LITTLE OR NO YOY WAE IN YEARS WHEN NO FRY WERE STOCKED.  IN THIS SURVEY (1991), THE STRONGEST YEAR CLASSES WERE YEARS IN WHICH FINGERLINGS WERE STOCKED.  NO WAE FROM THE 1990 (UNSTOCKED) YEAR CLASS WERE COLLECTED (ALTHOUGH THIS YEAR CLASS MAY NOT HAVE BEEN FULLY RECRUITED TO THE SAMPLING GEAR).  THERE IS SOME EVIDENCE THAT THE LOWER FINGERLING STOCKING RATES USED SINCE 1988 MAY PROVE TO BE EFFECTIVE.  THE HIGHEST CATCHES OF WAE IN POPLAR LAKE HAVE FOLLOWED PERIODS OF RELATIVELY LOW-INTENSITY STOCKING (1946-1955, 1970-1976).  IN THE 1991 SURVEY, THE STRONGEST YEAR CLASSES WERE 1989 AND 1988, BOTH YEARS WITH RELATIVELY LOW (0.5 LB/ACRE) FINGERLING STOCKINGS.  CATCH OF NOP AND SMB IN THE 1991 SURVEY WAS LOW, AND FISH OF BOTH SPECIES WERE SMALL.  NO NOP OVER 24 IN AND NO SMB OVER 10 IN WERE COLLECTED.  SMB GROWTH WAS BELOW AVERAGE FOR COOK COUNTY, WITH AGE II FISH AVERGING 4.6 IN AT LAST ANNULUS FORMATION, COMPARED TO THE COUNTY MEAN OF 5.3 IN.  SEVERAL BLC WERE COLLECTED IN THIS SURVEY.  THIS SPECIES HAS BEEN PRESENT, APPARENTLY IN LOW NUMBERS, SINCE AT LEAST 1977 (WHEN THEY WERE FIRST CAPTURED).  ALL THE FISH TAKEN IN THIS SURVEY WERE FROM THE 1988 AND 1989 YEAR CLASSES, AND HAD EXHIBITED GOOD GROWTH.   THE GILL NET CPUE FOR YEP WAS ABOUT AVERAGE FOR LAKES OF THIS ECOLOGICAL CLASS, AND WAS NOT UNUSUALLY LOW FOR POPLAR LAKE, HISTORICALLY.  SOME OF THE YEP COLLECTED WERE LARGE ENOUGH TO BE OF INTEREST TO ANGLERS.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>The walleye catch in this assessment was very low, both for lakes of this class, and for this lake historically.  All the walleye collected had been produced naturally, and although low, the walleye catch was similar to catches observed in this lake when it was being heavily stocked.  Walleye growth rates had been good.The northern pike catch was similar to past catches in this lake, and northern pike abundance was good for a lake of this type.  Several year classes were included in the catch, and growth had been good.Lake trout from 1997 and 1999 stockings were collected in 1999.  The population did not yet appear to be capable of providing much fishing, but the survival of these reintroductory stockings has been encouraging.  This assessment is the fourth in a row that has failed to collect any rainbow trout, which were stocked as large yearlings annually, 1993-1997.  Although rainbow trout can be difficult to collect, if the stocking had been successful some fish should have been seen in assessments.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Poplar Lake is a medium-sized lake in the heart of the Gunflint Trail resort community, about 30 road miles from Grand Marais.  It is one of the most heavily developed lakes in Cook County, hosting a good public access, at least five resorts, and about 100 homes and cabins.  As a result, interest in and use of fisheries in this lake has been high.  <br> \n <br> \nThe current (2011) lake management plan for Poplar Lake lists walleye and northern pike as primary and secondary management species, but the lake also supports a smallmouth bass fishery, and a rare (for this area), and very small, black crappie fishery.  The main objective in the 2011 LMP was to increase walleye abundance to reach a walleye gill net catch goal of 3.0 fish/set, with some fish over 20 inches present..  Toward that end, the lake has been stocked with walleye fingerlings every odd-numbered year since 2011.  To determine whether that goal could be reached by stocking alone, surveys were planned for 2012, 2016, and 2020.   Surveys were completed as planned in 2012 and 2016.  Due to a staff shortage and Covid-19 pandemic restrictions, the 2020 survey was reduced to a targeted survey, using trap nets and shallow gill net sets to mainly target the walleye population. <br> \n <br> \nThe 2020 walleye catch in shallow gill net sets was the second lowest seen in Poplar Lake since that sampling gear type came into use in 1993.  Had our full suite of deep and shallow sets been used in 2020, there's no doubt the total walleye catch would have fallen well short of the goal in the 2011 plan, since we usually catch few, if any, walleye in the deep sets.  Some walleye were also sampled in 0.75-in-mesh trap nets in 2020; that catch was similar to historic catches in that gear.  Walleye taken in 2020, in all sampling gears, ranged in length from 10.4 to 31.6 inches, with all but one under 18 inches.  Years in which recent fingerling stocking had been done (2017, 2015, and 2013) accounted for all but two of the walleye sampled (88% of the total catch), but none of those year classes appeared to have been strong.  Only one sampled fish was clearly from an unstocked year (2018), suggesting natural reproduction remained very low. <br> \n <br> \nSurveys in 2012-2020 have provided no evidence that the current walleye stocking program has increased walleye abundance to the goal level in Poplar Lake.  In fact, no increase at all has been evident.  However, it does appear that without stocking, there would have been even fewer walleye found, since most walleye taken have come from stocked year classes.  Every walleye stocking strategy reasonably available has been tried in Poplar Lake since 1980, and none have increased walleye numbers.  A different approach (probably regulatory) may be needed to increase walleye abundance, if such an increase is even possible. <br> \n <br> \nCatches of other fish species in shallow gill net sets and in 0.75-in trap nets in 2020 were similar to catches observed in this lake historically.  The lake supported fair numbers of small-to-medium sized northern pike, some smallmouth bass, and a few larger black crappie.  Catches of yellow perch, usually a critically important forage species for walleye and northern pike, were very low; however, that was also not unusual for this lake. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers strictly targeting walleye may have some tough fishing in Poplar Lake.  However, those willing to take a mixed bag can have some good outings.  In addition to walleye, northern pike, smallmouth bass, and a few black crappie, the lakes provides a good lake whitefish population and a few burbot for those that want to try for something different. <br> \n</p>",

All the walleye collected had been produced naturally, except for the 2001 year class, which may or may not have been from the 2001 fry stocking.  Walleye growth rates had been about average.The northern pike catch was similar to past catches in this lake, and northern pike abundance was good for a lake of this type.  Several year classes were included in the catch, and growth had been about average.Lake trout from the 2003 yearling stocking were collected in 2003.  No trout older than age-1 were caught.  The population did not yet appear to be capable of providing fishing, since long-term survival of stocked lake trout has been very poor.  The catch of smallmouth bass has been historically low during assessments of this lake, and during this assessment, only one smallmouth bass was caught.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Poplar Lake is managed primarily for walleye and northern pike.  The long range goal for walleye is to improve their abundance to achieve a minimum gill net catch of 3.0 fish/set, with some fish over 20 inches present.  The goal for the northern pike population is to maintain a minimum gill net catch of 0.6 fish/set.  This was the first of three assessments scheduled in the 2011 lake management plan to monitor the fish community and determine whether a new walleye stocking program, started in 2011, would be effective.  All previous attempts to increase walleye abundance by stocking have failed in this lake. <br> \n <br> \nIn 2012, Clean Water Legacy funding allowed areas across the state to do some nearshore fish community sampling to improve our ability to use a fish-based Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) to identify disturbed aquatic ecosystems.  Poplar Lake was selected for nearshore sampling because its accessibility allowed for use of the sampling gears required, and it was one of the more heavily developed lakes in Cook County. <br> \n <br> \nAssessments of Poplar Lake have used a combination of deep and shallow gill net sets since 1993.  Deep sets target coldwater species, while shallow sets target warm and cool-water species.  In this discussion, all references to gill net catches will be to the combined catch in deep and shallow sets.  In DNR Lakefinder reports, catches in those nets have been combined.  In addition, 0.25-in-mesh trap nets, backpack electrofishing gear, and a 15-ft beach seine were used to sample the nearshore fish community in 2012.  Catches for those nets are not included in Lakefinder reports. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye gill net catches in this lake have not exceeded 3.0 fish/set since 1982, despite periods of heavy stocking.  The 2012 gill net catch was one of the lowest ever seen in this lake; it fell far short of the long range goal for the species, and was well below the normal range for a lake of this type.  No walleye 20 inches or larger were taken in 2012.  Of the 11 walleye taken in gill nets and 0.75-in-mesh trap nets, eight were from year classes supplemented by fingerling or fry stocking (2008 fingerlings and 2007 fry).  Weak natural year classes were apparently produced in 2009 and 2010.  No fish from the 2011 fingerling stocking were taken; however, they would probably not have been large enough to have been captured in 0.75-in-mesh sampling gear in early July 2012.  Walleye growth had been slower than average; four-year-old fish reached an average length of 13.0 inches by the end of their fourth year, compared to an area mean of 14.2 inches.  Slow walleye growth was probably due to limited forage (low yellow perch abundance) and competition for forage from smallmouth bass, northern pike, lake whitefish, and black crappie. <br> \n <br> \nThe 2012 northern pike gill net catch met the long range goal for the species, and was similar to past catches seen in this lake.  Most of the northern pike collected were small (under 20 inches), but that was also typical for this lake.  The population consisted mostly of young fish; none older than four years were collected.  Growth rates had been about average; three-year-old fish reached an average length of 19.1 inches at the end of their third year. <br> \n <br> \nSmallmouth bass abundance appeared to have been low in 2012.  None were taken in gill nets, and the catch in 0.75-in-mesh trap nets barely reached the low end of the normal range for the lake class.  Low catches in both gears have not been unusual in this lake, and anglers have reported catching more bass than those low catches would indicate.  Too few fish were taken in 2012 to allow age distribution or growth rates to be described. <br> \n <br> \nPoplar Lake has supported a modest black crappie population for many years.  Although the 2012 catch in 0.75-in-mesh trap nets exceeded the normal range the lake class, this class is not known for supporting good black crappie populations.  Black crappie were not abundant enough, or large enough, to provide a very satisfactory fishery in 2012.  Most of the black crappie taken in trap nets were under six inches in length.  Larger fish have been taken in the past in Poplar Lake, but the 2012 catch was dominated by small, two-year-old fish.  Growth of those fish had been slow; they reached an average length of just 3.4 inches by the end of their second year. <br> \n <br> \nPoplar Lake has been open for fall netting of lake whitefish for many years, and netters have reported good success.  Although the netting harvest is unknown, it appears to have been sustainable.  The 2012 lake whitefish gill net catch was the highest seen to date in this lake.  Although the mean weight for lake whitefish taken in gill net sets fell below the normal range for the lake class, it was similar to values seen in some past assessments of this lake.  Lake whitefish collected in 2012 ranged in length from 8.3 to 19.1 in.  From the length frequency distribution it appeared that at least four year classes were represented in the catch, including a relatively large number of young fish that contributed to the lower mean weight seen in 2012. <br> \n <br> \nForage for walleye and northern pike appeared to have been limited.  The yellow perch gill net catch was relatively low, both for Poplar Lake historically, and for a lake of this class.  Few minnows were taken during nearshore fish sampling.  Some of the lake whitefish and white sucker collected would have been small enough to have provided forage for larger northern pike, but would have been too large for any but the largest walleye. <br> \n <br> \nSampling of the nearshore fish community was done using quarter-in-mesh trap nets, a 15-ft beach seine, and backpack electrofishing gear.  Prior to sampling done in 2012, Poplar Lake was known to have supported, at various times, yellow perch, white sucker, walleye, smallmouth bass, northern pike, lake whitefish, black crappie, burbot, pumpkinseed sunfish, central mudminnow, blacknose shiner, bluegill, hybrid sunfish, lake trout, largemouth bass, Iowa darter, brook stickleback, spottail shiner, black bullhead, green sunfish, and cisco.  No cisco have been sampled since 1955, and black bullhead were reported just once, in 1983.  Nearshore sampling  in 2012 added common shiner (a single specimen collected) to the list of species known to be present in this lake. <br> \n</p>",

Based on the profile, the top of the thermocline (i.e., the location in the water column with the sharpest transition from warm to cold water) occurred at approximately 10 feet. The dissolved oxygen did not reach 3.0 mg/L or less throughout the profile, and therefore there was sufficient oxygen from the surface to the bottom of the lake at the time of sampling. Since no TDO3 value can be calculated, the lowest dissolved oxygen level recorded was 4.6 ppm at 6.5?C (43.7?F) which was found at the deepest depth of the profile (68.9 feet). <br> \n <br> \nTDO3 values cooler than 17.2?C indicate that oxythermal conditions are favorable for Lake Whitefish. Dissolved oxygen concentrations below the thermocline indicate that suitable oxythermal habitat for Lake Whitefish was available across a range of depths at the time of sampling during the summer of 2023. Data collected in 1984-2016 further indicate suitable oxythermal habitat across years. When adequate oxythermal habitat is available, Lake Whitefish are not squeezed into unfavorable, warmer water conditions and therefore do not experience higher levels of stress. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>The walleye catch in this assessment was very low, both for lakes of this class, and for this lake historically.  Only one walleye was taken in sixteen gill net sets, and only three were taken in all gears combined.  Of those three, two had been produced naturally in 1994, and one could have come from a 1991 fingerling stocking.The northern pike catch was about average for lakes of this class.  Growth of age-3 fish collected had been slow, probably due to the low abundance of yellow perch.  Older, larger fish appeared to have grown faster, perhaps due to the availability of lake whitefish as forage for larger northern pike.Short-term survival and growth of lake trout yearlings stocked in 1997 appeared to have been fairly good, but no fish from a 1996 stocking were taken.  This assessment also failed to take any rainbow trout from yearling stockings done annually since 1994; however, rainbow trout are difficult to sample in standard gill nets, and are often missed even in stream trout lakes with relatively dense populations.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Poplar Lake is managed primarily for Walleye and Northern Pike.  The long range goal for Walleye, from the 2011 lake management plan (LMP), is to improve their abundance to achieve a minimum gill net catch of 3.0 fish/set,with some fish over 20 inches present.  The goal for the Northern Pike population is to maintain a minimum gill net catch of 0.6 fish/set.  This was the second of three surveys scheduled in the 2011 LMP to monitor the fish community and determine whether a new Walleye fingerling stocking program, started in 2011, would be effective.  Since 1980 all attempts to increase Walleye abundance by stocking have failed in this lake. <br> \n <br> \nIn 2016 the Section of Fisheries began an initiative aimed at evaluating all current Walleye fingerling stocking programs, on a lake-by-lake basis.  Poplar Lake was part of that initiative; however, the current stocking program in Poplar Lake has only been in place since 2011, and evaluation of that program, as outlined in the 2011 LMP, had started in 2012. <br> \n <br> \nAssessments of Poplar Lake have used a combination of deep and shallow gill net sets since 1993.  Deep sets target coldwater species, while shallow sets target warm and cool-water species.  In this discussion, all references to gill net catches will be to the combined catch in deep and shallow sets unless otherwise noted.  In addition, 0.75-in and 0.25-in-mesh trap nets were used to sample the nearshore fish community in 2016.  A targeted survey, using open-water angling, was done in mid-June to better assess the Smallmouth Bass population in this lake.  Results of that survey will be reported separately.  A creel survey was also completed on Poplar Lake in 2016, covering most of the open-water fishing season (May 14 - September 18).  Those results have also been reported separately, although a few have been referenced here. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance in Poplar Lake was low in 2016, as it has been in this lake since the mid-1980s.  Walleye gill net catches have not exceeded 3.0 fish/set since 1982, despite periods of heavy stocking.  The 2016 gill net catch (0.56 fish/set) was typical of catches seen in this lake since 1984; it fell far short of the long range goal for the species, and was well below the normal range for this type of lake.  One Walleye 20 inches or larger was taken in 2016, but most were under 16 inches.  Of the 12 Walleye taken in gill nets and 0.75-in-mesh trap nets, 10 were from year classes supplemented by fingerling stocking (2003, 2011, 2013, or 2015).  Weak natural year classes were apparently produced in 2010, 2012, and 2016.  Growth of Walleye at early ages appeared to have been slow.  Fish reached an average length of just 10.8 inches by the end of their third year, compared to an area average of 11.7 inches.  Similarly slow growth had been observed among Walleye sampled in 2012.  Slow Walleye growth was probably due to limited forage (low Yellow Perch abundance) and competition for forage from Smallmouth Bass, Northern Pike, Lake Whitefish, and Black Crappie. <br> \n <br> \nEvaluation of the current Walleye fingerling stocking program in Poplar Lake is in its early stages, and yielded mixed results in 2016.  Goals for Walleye abundance were not met, and in fact there was little evidence that there had been any increase in Walleye numbers at all since the latest round of stocking began.  On the other hand, stocked year classes had accounted for most of the 2016 (and 2012) Walleye survey catch, suggesting Walleye numbers would have been even lower without any stocking.  Despite the low survey catch in 2016, results of the 2016 creel survey indicated some anglers on Poplar Lake were able to find and catch Walleye, and of the four lakes included in that survey, anglers on Poplar Lake appeared to have experienced the highest Walleye catch rate (0.05 fish/angler-hour).  Forty-nine percent of parties interviewed on Poplar Lake sought Walleye, illustrating the importance of maintaining a Walleye fishery in this lake.  Because the original evaluation has not yet been completed, and early results have been mixed, we will not be changing current Walleye stocking recommendations for Poplar Lake.  Instead we will continue stocking and let the evaluation run its course before considering a change. <br> \n <br> \nThe 2016 Northern Pike gill net catch (0.67 fish/set) just met the long range goal for the species, and was similar to past catches seen in this lake.  Most of the Northern Pike collected were small (under 20 inches), but a few fish up to 25 inches in length were present.  Five year classes (up to six years of age) contributed to the 2016 catch.  All had been produced naturally, although none appeared to have been particularly strong.   Growth rates at early ages had been slow; fish reached a mean length of 14.8 inches at the end of their third year, compared to an area average of 18.8 inches.  In the 2016 creel survey, about 10% of parties interviewed reported targeting Northern Pike, and those anglers experienced an estimated catch rate of 0.31 fish/angler-hour.  Of the total estimated Northern Pike catch (647 fish), 98% were released, probably because most were small (17.1 inches on average for released fish).  <br> \n <br> \nThe 2016 Smallmouth Bass gill net catch (0.06 fish/net) was low for a lake of this type, but was similar to past catches seen in Poplar Lake.  Too few fish were sampled to allow their size or age distributions, or their growth rates, to be described with any confidence.  The net catch (all gears) included fish up to 17 inches in length.  Angling by DNR Fisheries crews on June 16 and 17 yielded a catch of 14 Smallmouth Bass.  Those fish ranged in length from 8.9 to 17.9 inches, with most in the 10-13-inch range.  In the 2016 creel survey, 26% of parties interviewed reported targeting Smallmouth Bass, with an estimated catch rate for those parties of 0.33 fish/angler-hour.  Anglers on Poplar Lake reported releasing about 91% of the Smallmouth Bass they caught, including about 88% of the fish 12 inches or larger they caught. <br> \n <br> \nPoplar Lake has supported a modest Black Crappie population since at least the 1970s.  The 2016 catch in 0.75-in-mesh trap nets was low for the lake historically, and for this type of lake; however, relatively high numbers of young-of-year Black Crappie were taken in 0.25-in-mesh trap nets.  In general, and as has been the case in this lake in the past, Black Crappie were not abundant enough, or large enough, to provide a very satisfactory fishery.  None of the parties interviewed in the 2016 creel survey reported targeting the species, and no Black Crappie were reported to have been caught by those interviewed. <br> \n <br> \nPoplar Lake has been open for fall netting of Lake Whitefish for many years, and netters have reported good success.  Although the netting harvest is unknown, it appears to have been sustainable.  The 2016 Lake Whitefish gill net catch (1.11 fish/set), and the mean weight for fish taken in gill nets (1.13 lb/fish) were similar to past catches seen in this lake.   Lake Whitefish collected in 2016 ranged in length from 8.6 to 18.1 inches.  A few Lake Whitefish were reported to have been caught by anglers interviewed in the 2016 creel survey. <br> \n <br> \nForage for Walleye and Northern Pike appeared to have been limited.  The Yellow Perch gill net catch (0.22 fish/set) was relatively low, both for Poplar Lake historically, and for a lake of this type.  Other than a single Brook Stickleback, no minnows were taken during nearshore fish sampling using 0.25-in-mesh trap nets.  Some of the Lake Whitefish and White Sucker collected would have been small enough to have provided some forage for larger Northern Pike, but most would have been too large for any but the largest Walleye. <br> \n</p>",

Standard surveys using gill nets and trap nets have typically not caught many bass in Poplar Lake, making it difficult to describe size or age distributions and growth rates with any confidence.  A standard survey of Poplar Lake done in July 2016 sampled just four Smallmouth Bass in standard gill nets and 0.75-in-mesh trap nets.  Another five non-young-of-year fish were taken in 0.25-in-mesh trap nets used in that survey. <br> \n <br> \nIn this survey 14 Smallmouth Bass were taken by angling over the course of two days.   This type of sampling does not provide a good indication of Smallmouth Bass abundance, but may be somewhat indicative of the sizes of fish anglers may encounter.  The catch rate for the MNDNR Fisheries crew (0.44 fish/angler-hour) was similar to the catch rate (0.33 fish/angler-hour) reported by parties targeting Smallmouth Bass who were interviewed during a 2016 creel survey completed on Poplar Lake.  Smallmouth Bass taken by the MNDNR angling crew ranged in length from nine to 18 inches, with most in the 10-13-inch length range.  Most of the bass caught were 4-6 years old, although fish as old as 13 years were taken.  Smallmouth Bass growth appeared to have been somewhat slow; fish reached a mean length of 10.7 inches by the end of their fifth year, compared to an area average of 11.8 inches. <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

Walleye were reproducing naturally, and stocking appeared to have contributed little to the population.  Fair numbers of northern pike were also observed, with some fish up to 24 inches.  Yellow perch abundance was low, and the lack of a good perch forage base probably contributed to the slow growth exhibited by walleye in the lake.  No rainbow trout were taken in this assessment, but angler reports indicate that stocking has resulted in at least some rainbow trout being taken by anglers.  Lake conditions were found to be suitable for lake trout, and they will be reintroduced in 1996.</p>",

All attempts to improve walleye abundance by stocking have so far failed, although it did appear that stocking could have accounted for most of the walleye collected in 2006.  The northern pike catch in 2006 was also low, and most of the northern pike collected were small.  Few smallmouth bass were taken, although there were indications that a strong year class had been produced in 2005.  Recent lake trout stocking efforts in this lake appear to have failed completely, and have been discontinued.  In contrast, black crappie abundance in 2006 appeared to have been at an all-time high for this lake, and high compared to similar lakes.  Although few of the black crappie taken in 2006 were over eight inches, many smaller fish were present and likely to enter the fishery in the next two or three years. <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Walleye abundance was low in Poplar Lake in 2009, as it has been in this lake since the mid 1980s.  Stocking since 2001 has not succeeded in improving walleye abundance.  About half of the walleye collected in 2009 had come from years when stocking was done, and about half had been produced naturally.  No strong year classes were identified.  Walleye growth rates had been about average for the area, with fish reaching a length of 14.2 inches at the end of their fourth year. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike abundance in 2009 was average for a lake of this type, and for Poplar Lake historically.  Northern pike collected in Poplar Lake historically have generally been small, and that was again the case in 2009.  Most were one or two-year-old fish, and no fish over three years of age were taken.  Growth of young northern pike had been fairly fast, despite the lack of a good yellow perch forage base. <br> \n <br> \nThe 2009 smallmouth bass gill net catch was low for a lake of this type, but not for this lake historically.  Smallmouth bass were probably more abundant than the gill net catch would indicate. <br> \n <br> \nPoplar Lake is one of a handful of Cook County lakes open to fall netting of tullibee or lake whitefish.  The 2009 lake whitefish catch was low for a lake of this class, but was similar to past catches in this lake.  Lake whitefish abundance in this lake appears to have been stable since 1982. <br> \n <br> \nPoplar Lake is also one of just a few lakes in this area to support black crappie.  The gill net catch in 2009 was low for a lake of this type, but was typical of past catches in this lake.  Growth of the two black crappie collected had been relatively fast. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch have typically not been abundant in Poplar Lake, and the catch in 2009 was again fairly low.  Yellow perch collected in 2009 would have been too small to have been of much interest in anglers, but they did provide some forage for walleye and northern pike. <br> \n <br> \nNo lake trout were taken in 2009, suggesting that long-term survival of lake trout stocked in 1999, 2003, and 2005 had been very poor.  The temperature-oxygen profile done during this assessment found conditions suitable for lake trout (temperature under 55 F, oxygen over 5 ppm) at depths of about 32 to about 42 ft.  Six gill net sets were made in that depth range, and collected mostly lake whitefish. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",
