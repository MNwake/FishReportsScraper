                "narrative": "<p>Catch rates of walleye (0.50 fish/gillnet and 1.10 lbs/gillnet) were within the normal ranges for Lake Class 36 of the Schupp Classification System, as they have been since 1987.  Prior to then, numbers were slightly above the third quartile.  Mean weight of walleye sampled in gillnets was 2.20 lbs. and in trapnets was 5.55 lbs.  The four walleye sampled ranged in length from 17.6 inches to 28.2 inches.  Walleye were stocked into Frontenac up until 1987, but success rates were low.Numbers of northern pike caught (14.00 fish/gillnet) were above the third quartile, while 22.30 lbs/gillnet was within the normal range.  These numbers result in a mean weight of 1.59 lbs.  Densities were within the normal ranges for the 1977 through 1987 surveys.  The present PSD (18) and RSD-P (2) indicate a small size structure with few fish reaching even quality length.  Northern pike exhibit slow growth, averaging 18.77 inches at age 4, however, growth rates are variable among individuals and year classes.  Age 4 northern pike range from 16.70 to 23.20 inches.  Recruitment appears variable.  1987 and 1988 were strong year classes, but there are few fish over age 4 in the population.Largemouth bass catch rates were within the normal ranges for lakes of this classification.  These catch rates are increases from the 1984 and 1987 surveys when they were below the first quartile.  Catches of bluegill were below the first quartile, as they have been since 1984 when they were first sampled.  Pumpkinseed gillnet catch rates were above the third quartile and have been increasing since 1977.  Gillnets sampled pumpkinseed more effectively than trapnets in this lake.  Pumpkinseed PSD (90) and RSD-P (0) indicate a poor size distribution.  Most fish are in one size class, with no fish reaching preferred length and few small fish to maintain the population.  The lack of small fish may be due to inefficient sampling of thes sizes, as no fish <5.70 inches were sampled in either gear.  Pumpkinseed exhibit good growth, averaging 5.37 inches at age 4.  Catches of yellow perch were above the third quartile in 1991.  Catch rates were also above the third quartile in 1977, but had since decreased until 1991.  Size structure of yellow perch is very small (PSD=8).White sucker catch rates were within the normal range for lakes of this classification and generally have been since 1977.  Density of black bullhead was below the first quartile, while that of brown bullhead was within the normal range.  Both of these bullhead species have been low in abundance since they were first sampled (1977 for black bullhead, 1987 for brown bullhead).  Yellow bullhead catches have been increasing since 1984 and are now above the third quartile.  Rock bass numbers were slightly above the median; pounds per trapnet equalled the median.  Cisco (tullibees) and black crappie have been sampled in  the past, but not in 1991.</p>",

A public access is located on the southeast end of the lake off Schoolcraft Drive. <br> \n <br> \nThe Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics. Frontenac is in Lake Class 35. Class 35 lakes generally have very high littoral area, and very irregularly shaped shorelines. Other class 35 lakes in the Park Rapids area include: Middle Crooked, Crystal, Pickerel and Waboose. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers can expect to find an abundant population of northern pike in Frontenac. Sampled northern pike had an average length and weight of 19 inches and 1.6 pounds, with pike sampled up to 30 inches.  Yellow perch were seen in average numbers compared to similar lakes, with most fish 5-10 inches in length.  The yellow perch provide a great forage base for northern pike and walleyes, and some angling opportunities for the largest perch.  Largemouth bass were sampled in similar numbers to past surveys.  Average size was very good, at 16 inches, with the largest being almost 20 inches.  Frontenac supports a healthy number of bluegills, but with small size that likely will not be targeted by anglers. Pumpkinseeds were also sampled in good numbers, and of size that could be targeted by anglers. Natural reproduction has maintained a small, but quality size walleye population with an average length of 18 inches with some trophy fish sampled. <br> \n <br> \nCurrently no aquatic invasive species (AIS) have been identified in Frontenac. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Frontenac Lake is located four miles west of Becida in northwestern Hubbard County.  Frontenac  is a shallow lake with a surface area of 204 acres and a maximum depth of 16 feet.  A state-owned public access is located on the south shore of the lake.  Frontenac is best noted for it's northern pike fishery, but also provides angling for yellow perch, largemouth bass, panfish, and a occasional walleye.  The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical and chemical characteristics.  Frontenac Lake in class 35.  Other area lakes in this same classification include Middle Crooked, Crystal, Pickerel, and Waboose.Frontenac Lake supports an abundant northern pike population.  Gillnet catch rates of northern pike were above the \"normal range\" for this lake class.  Frontenac Lake has excellent northern pike spawning habitat of shallow submerged aquatic vegetation as well as marshy areas in the inlet and outlet areas.  While northern pike are abundant, the population is dominated by small, slow growing \"hammer handle\" pike.  The average length and weight of northern pike sampled was 16.6 inches and 0.9 pounds.Frontenac Lake supports a small walleye population that can provide a bonus fishery.  The walleye catch rate of 3.8 walleye/gillnet is higher than past surveys and just above the \"normal range\" for this lake class.  Walleye have not been stocked into Frontenac Lake since 1987.  Frontenac Lake appears to be very limited in preferred walleye spawning habitat of shallow, wind swept rubble shoals.  However, the population is being maintained either from natural reproduction in the lake and streams or from migration up the outlet stream.  Frontenac Lake, as well as other class 35 lakes, that are shallow with abundant aquatic vegetation typically do not support large walleye populations and are better suited for species like northern pike.Low numbers of panfish are found in Frontenac Lake.  Catch rates of bluegill and black crappie were low, while pumpkinseed were sampled in moderate numbers for this lake class.  While most panfish were small, an occasional larger fish was sampled for each species.  The yellow perch population in Frontenac are of an acceptable size to provide limited angling.  Average size of sampled yellow perch was 8.4 inches with fish measured up to 11.4 inches.  Moderate numbers of largemouth bass were sampled in Frontenac Lake.  Bass numbers seem to be increasing from past surveys.Other species sampled in low numbers include yellow bullhead, brown bullhead, black bullhead, white sucker, and hybrid sunfish.</p>",
