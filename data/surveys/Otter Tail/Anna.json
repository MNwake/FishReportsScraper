In 1969, there were no carp sampled, the secchi disc reading was 8 feet, and submerged vegetation was abundant throughout the lake. In 1988, there was 237 carp sampled, the secchi disc reading was 4 ft., and submerged vegetation was noticeably absent or reduced from large areas of the lake. <br> \n     Northern pike abundance decreased from 4.3 per gill net lift in 1969 to 0.75 per gill net lift.  <br> \n     Bluegill numbers and size distribution is similar to the previous survey, with few fish over 7.0 inches in length.  <br> \n     Largemouth bass abundance exceeds the local median and natural reproduction appears to be adequate.  <br> \n     Black crappie abundance is well above the local median and several age classes were represented in the sample.  <br> \n     Yellow perch were absent from the sample.  <br> \n     Walleye abundance declined substantially.  In 1969, the gill net catch was 6.3 per lift while walleyes were not represented in the gill net sample of this survey; however, eight walleye were represented in the trap net sample.  All were over 19.0 inches in length and at least age- VI+. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Anna Lake is a 538-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located in south-central Otter Tail County approximately four miles north of Underwood, MN.  The immediate watershed is composed primarily of agricultural land interspersed with hardwood woodlots.  The maximum depth is 55 feet; however, 69% of the lake is less than 15 feet in depth.  The secchi disk reading during the 2004 lake survey was 5.5 feet.  Previous secchi disk readings have ranged from 4.0 to 8.0 feet.  Anna Lake is included in class 32 of the Minnesota DNR lake classification scheme.     The majority of the shoreline of Anna Lake remains undeveloped.  A DNR owned concrete public access is located along the southwest shoreline.  Shoal water substrates consist primarily of sand and gravel.  Hardstem bulrush and common cattail are prevalent along the shoreline of the entire lake.  Emergent aquatic plants such as bulrush and cattail provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat, and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms, and can actually absorb and break down polluting chemicals.  Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish such as northern pike, largemouth bass, and panfish.  They also serve as important nursery areas for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit.  To maintain the excellent water quality and angling that this lake has to offer, it is imperative to preserve the quality of the aquatic habitat.     Anna Lake can be ecologically classified as a bass-panfish type of lake and this is reflected in the assemblage of the fish community.  Largemouth bass, black crappie, and bluegill are the dominant game-fish species in the fish community.  The prolificacy of these species can be attributed to the abundance of suitable spawning habitat that is available.     A spring electrofishing assessment was conducted in 2003 to analyze the largemouth bass population.  Data indicate that bass are abundant and that there is a good size structure.  Bass ranged in length from 4.8 to 20.0 inches with an average length and weight of 11.0 inches and 1.1 pounds.  Bass attain an average length of 15.4 inches at five years of age.     Data collected from a spring trapnetting assessment indicated that black crappie are very abundant.  The 1999 year class is strong and should provide consistently good black crappie angling for several years.  Crappies attain an average length of 9.1 inches at five years of age.     The bluegill test-net catch rate was equivalent to the upper limit of the normal range for lake class 32.  Bluegill size structure has historically been poor.  Less than 1% of the bluegill were 7.0 inches or greater in length.  Bluegill attain an average length of 6.3 inches at five years of age.      The walleye test-net catch rate remained unchanged from previous surveys and was equivalent to the upper limit of the normal range.  Walleye ranged in length from 14.4 to 25.3 inches with an average length and weight of 17.7 inches and 2.0 pounds.  Walleye fry stocking on a biennial basis appears to be sustaining the walleye population.  The strongest year classes have consistently corresponded to years of walleye stocking while most skip years in the stocking sequence are weak.  Walleye attain an average length of 12.4 inches at two years of age.     Anglers can maintain or improve the quality of angling by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large-size fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future.              </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>     Anna Lake is a 538-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located in south-central Otter Tail County approximately four miles north of Underwood, MN.  The immediate watershed is composed primarily of agricultural land interspersed with hardwood woodlots.  The maximum depth is 55 feet; however, 69% of the lake is less than 15 feet in depth.  The secchi disk reading during the 2009 lake survey was 9.3 feet.  Previous secchi disk readings have ranged from 4.0 to 8.0 feet. <br> \n     The majority of the shoreline of Anna Lake remains undeveloped.  A DNR owned concrete public access is located along the southwest shoreline.  Shoal water substrates consist primarily of sand and gravel.  Hardstem bulrush and common cattail are prevalent along the shoreline of the entire lake.  Emergent aquatic plants such as bulrush and cattail provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat, and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms, and can actually absorb and break down polluting chemicals.  Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish such as northern pike, largemouth bass, and panfish.  They also serve as important nursery areas for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit.  To maintain the excellent water quality and angling that this lake has to offer, it is imperative to preserve the quality of the aquatic habitat. <br> \n     Anna Lake can be ecologically classified as a bass panfish type of lake and this is reflected in the assemblage of the fish community.  Largemouth bass, black crappie, and bluegill are the dominant game-fish species in the fish community.  The prolificacy of these species can be attributed to the abundance of suitable spawning habitat that is available. <br> \n     A spring electrofishing assessment was conducted to analyze the largemouth bass population.  Data indicate that bass are abundant and that there is a good size structure.  Bass ranged in length from 9.5 to 19.9 inches with an average length and weight of 12.8 inches and 1.3 pounds.  Bass attain an average length of 13.7 inches at five years of age. <br> \n     Data collected from a spring trapnetting assessment indicated that black crappies are very abundant.  The 2005 year class is strong and should provide consistently good black crappie angling for several years.  Twenty-three percent of the sample was 10.0 inches or greater in length.  Crappies attain an average length of 9.6 inches at five years of age. <br> \n     The bluegill test-net catch rate was within the expected range for similar lakes.  Fifty-nine percent of the bluegills were 7.0 inches or greater in length.  Bluegills attain an average length of 6.6 inches at five years of age.  <br> \n     The walleye test-net catch rate exceeded the expected range for similar lakes.  Walleyes ranged in length from 9.5 to 24.6 inches with an average length and weight of 15.6 inches and 1.3 pounds.  Walleyes attain an average length of 16.2 inches at four years of age. <br> \n     Anglers can maintain or improve the quality of angling by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large size fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future.      <br> \n   \t     <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>     Anna Lake is a 538-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located in south-central Otter Tail County approximately four miles north of Underwood, MN.  The immediate watershed is composed primarily of agricultural land interspersed with hardwood woodlots.  The maximum depth is 55 feet; however, 69% of the lake is 15 feet or less in depth.  Secchi disk readings have ranged from 4.0 to 9.3 feet.   <br> \n     The majority of the shoreline of Anna Lake remains undeveloped.  A DNR owned concrete public access is located along the southwest shoreline.  Shoal water substrates consist primarily of sand and gravel.  Hardstem bulrush and common cattail are prevalent along the entire shoreline of the lake.  Emergent aquatic plants such as bulrush and cattail provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat, and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms, and can absorb and break down polluting chemicals.  Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish such as Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, and Panfish.  They also serve as important nursery areas for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit.  To maintain the excellent water quality and angling that this lake has to offer, it is imperative to preserve the quality of the aquatic habitat.      <br> \n     A spring electrofishing survey was conducted to analyze the Largemouth Bass population.  Catch data indicate that Anna Lake has a moderate to high-density Largemouth Bass population.  Age data indicate that bass reproduction is consistently good.  Largemouth Bass ranged in length from 7.7 to 18.1 inches with an average length and weight of 12.7 inches and 1.2 pounds.  Bass attain an average length of 12.8 inches at four years of age.     <br> \n     Anglers can maintain or improve the quality of angling by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large size fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future.    <br> \n     Anna Lake is not listed as an infested water.  Aquatic invasive species are threatening Minnesota waters.  Aquatic invasive species can potentially harm water quality, water recreation, aquatic habitat, native species, and fish populations.  Anglers can help prevent the introduction and spread of invasive species by following watercraft transportation laws.   <br> \n        <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>     Anna Lake is a 538-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located in south-central Otter Tail County approximately four miles north of Underwood, MN.  The immediate watershed is composed primarily of agricultural land interspersed with hardwood woodlots.  The maximum depth is 55 feet; however, 69% of the lake is 15 feet or less in depth.  The secchi disk reading was 7.0 feet.  Previous secchi disk readings have ranged from 4.0 to 9.3 feet.   <br> \n     The majority of the shoreline of Anna Lake remains undeveloped.  A DNR owned concrete public access is located along the southwest shoreline.  Shoal water substrates consist primarily of sand and gravel.  Hardstem bulrush and common cattail are prevalent along the shoreline of the entire lake.  Emergent aquatic plants such as bulrush and cattail provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat, and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms, and can actually absorb and break down polluting chemicals.  Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish such as Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, and Panfish.  They also serve as important nursery areas for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit.  To maintain the excellent water quality and angling that this lake has to offer, it is imperative to preserve the quality of the aquatic habitat. <br> \n     Anna Lake can be ecologically classified as a Bass-panfish type of lake and this is reflected in the assemblage of the fish community.  Largemouth Bass, Black Crappie, and Bluegill are the dominant game-fish species.  The prolificacy of these species can be attributed to the abundance of suitable spawning habitat that is available. <br> \n     A spring electrofishing assessment was conducted to analyze the Largemouth Bass population.  Data indicate that Largemouth Bass are abundant and that the population is well balanced.  Bass ranged in length from 4.6 to 16.0 inches with an average length of 11.1 inches.  Bass attain an average length of 14.3 inches at five years of age. <br> \n     Data collected from a spring trapnetting assessment indicate that Black Crappies are very abundant.  The 2009 and 2010 year classes are strong and should provide consistently good Black Crappie angling for several years.  Sixty-six percent of the crappies sampled were 10.0 inches or greater in length.  Crappies attain an average length of 11.1 inches at five years of age. <br> \n     Bluegill abundance tends to fluctuate due to inconsistent levels of reproduction. Twenty-two percent of the Bluegills were 7.0 inches or greater in length.  Bluegills attain an average length of 6.3 inches at five years of age.  <br> \n     Walleye abundance is at a historical high for this lake.  Walleyes ranged in length from 10.3 to 21.9 inches with an average length and weight of 14.5 inches and 1.1 pounds.  Walleyes attain an average length of 14.5 inches at four years of age. <br> \n     Anglers can maintain or improve the quality of angling by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large size fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future.      <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>     Anna Lake is a 538-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located in south-central Otter Tail County approximately four miles north of Underwood, MN.  The immediate watershed is composed primarily of agricultural land interspersed with hardwood woodlots.  The maximum depth is 55 feet; however, 69% of the lake is 15 feet or less in depth.  Secchi disk readings have ranged from 4.0 to 9.3 feet.   <br> \n     The majority of the shoreline of Anna Lake remains undeveloped.  A DNR owned concrete public access is located along the southwest shoreline.  Shoal water substrates consist primarily of sand and gravel.  Hardstem bulrush and common cattail are prevalent along the entire shoreline of the lake.  Emergent aquatic plants such as bulrush and cattail provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat, and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms, and can absorb and break down polluting chemicals.  Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish such as Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, and Panfish.  They also serve as important nursery areas for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit.  To maintain the excellent water quality and angling that this lake has to offer, it is imperative to preserve the quality of the aquatic habitat.      <br> \n     A special gillnetting survey was conducted to analyze the Walleye and Northern Pike populations. <br> \n     Walleyes ranged in length from 9.1 to 28.2 inches with an average length and weight of 17.3 inches and 1.9 pounds.  The 2016 year class is strong and should provide good Walleye angling for several years.  Walleyes attain an average length of 15.1 inches at four years of age. <br> \n     Northern Pike ranged in length from 16.6 to 30.7 inches with an average length and weight of 23.2 inches and 2.7 pounds.  Northern Pike exhibit good growth rates with an average length of 23.9 inches at five years of age. <br> \n     Anglers can maintain or improve the quality of angling by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large size fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future.    <br> \n     Anna Lake is not listed as an infested water.  Aquatic invasive species are threatening Minnesota waters.  Aquatic invasive species can potentially harm water quality, water recreation, aquatic habitat, native species, and fish populations.  Anglers can help prevent the introduction and spread of invasive species by following watercraft transportation laws.   <br> \n        <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>     Anna Lake is a 538-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located in south-central Otter Tail County approximately four miles north of Underwood, MN.  The immediate watershed is composed primarily of agricultural land interspersed with hardwood woodlots.  The maximum depth is 55 feet; however, 69% of the lake is 15 feet or less in depth.  Secchi disk readings have ranged from 4.0 to 9.3 feet.   <br> \n     The majority of the shoreline of Anna Lake remains undeveloped.  A DNR owned concrete public access is located along the southwest shoreline.  Shoal water substrates consist primarily of sand and gravel.  Hardstem bulrush and common cattail are prevalent along the entire shoreline of the lake.  Emergent aquatic plants such as bulrush and cattail provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat, and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms, and can absorb and break down polluting chemicals.  Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish such as Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, and panfish.  They also serve as important nursery areas for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit.  To maintain the excellent water quality and angling that this lake has to offer, it is imperative to preserve the quality of the aquatic habitat.      <br> \n     A spring trapnetting survey was conducted to analyze the Black Crappie population.  Catch data indicate that Black Crappies are very abundant.  The 2014 and 2015 year classes are strong and should provide consistently good Black Crappie angling for several years.  Crappies ranged in length from 8.6 to 13.0 inches with an average length of 10.5 inches.  Seventy-six percent of the crappies were 10.0 inches or greater in length.  Crappies attain an average length of 11.2 inches at five years of age. <br> \n     Anglers can maintain or improve the quality of angling by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large size fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future.    <br> \n     Anna Lake is not listed as an infested water.  Aquatic invasive species are threatening Minnesota waters.  Aquatic invasive species can potentially harm water quality, water recreation, aquatic habitat, native species, and fish populations.  Anglers can help prevent the introduction and spread of invasive species by following watercraft transportation laws.   <br> \n        <br> \n</p>",
