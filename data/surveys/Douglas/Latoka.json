                "narrative": "<p>Lake Latoka, located southwest of Alexandria, is a heavily developed lake with very good water quality.  The mid-summer secchi reading was recorded at 14.5 feet.  Submergent vegetation is common around the basin but emergent vegetation is limited.  Lake Latoka receives heavy recreational use during the summer months.  A public swim beach is located on the north end of the lake.Walleye gillnet catches averaged 5.4 fish per net which is similar to previous survey results.  Mean weight of sampled fish was 3.0 pounds.  The mean length of sampled fish was 19.4 inches with the largest fish measuring 30.0 inches.  Lake Latoka is known for a moderate population of large walleye and would be a good choice for a wall-hanger walleye.Northern pike remain abundant and small.  Gillnet catches averaged 13.8 fish per net which is similar to previous survey results.  Mean weight of the sampled fish was 1.6 pounds and the mean length was just over 18.0 inches.  The largest fish measured 33.1 inches.Bluegill remain abundant with trapnet catches averaging 37.2 fish per net.  The mean length of sampled fish was 5.9 inches.  Strong 1995 and 1996 year classes comprised 64% of the total catch.   These fish average between 6 and 7 inches and should provide quality angling in the near future.Largemouth bass electrofishing survey resulted in a catch of 37.3 fish per hour.  Forty percent of the sample exceeded 12 inches with 32% exceeding 15 inches.  The largest fish measured just over 18.0 inches.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Latoka is a relatively deep basin with exceptional water clarity.  Submergent vegetation is commonin shallow areas, however emergent vegetation is limited.  Extensive shoreline development has likelyimpacted the distribution of emergent vegetation and threatens water quality.  Northern pike catches averaged 12.3 fish/gillnet which exceeds the normal range of mean catch ratesfrom lakes with similar physical and chemical characteristics (3.0 - 7.9 fish/gillnet).  Gillnetcatches have exceeded the normal range in all previous surveys dating back to 1981; ranging from 9.4to 20.6 fish/net.  Size structure of the northern pike population has been consistently poor.  Only 22%of the fish captured were 21 inches in length or greater and few exceeded 28 inches.  Large northernpike may be suspended in deeper water during summer months and thus are not sampled with traditionalgillnet sets.  Walleye catches averaged 7.0 fish/gillnet.  Gillnet catches have ranged from 2.9 to 6.0fish/net in previous surveys dating back to 1981.  The normal range of mean catch rates from similarlakes is 4.0 - 9.6 fish/gillnet.  Size structure of the walleye population should provide qualityangling opportunities.  Mean weight of fish captured was 2.8 pounds.  The contribution of walleyestocking is unclear.  Nearly annual stocking and the stocking of mixed age fish does not allow for ameaningful evaluation.  Gillnet catch rates have not increased significantly despite fingerlingstocking in nine of eleven years between 1984 and 1994; and the blank years in 1992 and 1988 are wellrepresented in the age class distribution.Bluegill catches averaged 26.0 fish/trapnet in 1997, compared to 45.4 fish/trapnet in 1993.  Trapnetcatches averaged 47.2, 64.7 and 56.3 fish/net in 1989, 1986, and 1981, respectively.  Almost 80% of thefish captured in 1997 were 6 inches in length or greater, however no fish exceeded 8.0 inches in totallength.  The decrease in trapnet catch rate may be related to poor reproductive success during theunusually cool summers of 1992 and 1993.  Age-4 and age-5 fish were poorly represented in the age classdistribution of fish captured in trapnets.  Largemouth bass also did not reproduce successfully in 1992and 1993.  Age-4 and age-5 fish were not present in the electrofishing sample.  Accordingly, nightelectrofishing catches decreased from 116.0 per hour in 1993 to 35.0 per hour in 1997.  Size structureof the largemouth bass population has also been impacted by the missing year classes.  Most of the fishcaptured in 1997 were 12 inches in length or greater and about one-half exceeded 15 inches.  Yellowperch catches averaged 1.8 fish/gillnet.  Gillnet catches have been low in previous surveys, rangingfrom 0.7 to 2.4 fish/net.  Fish ranged from 4.6 to 7.6 inches in total length.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Latoka is a 776-acre lake located about four miles west of Alexandria.  It\u0019s a deep, clear-water lake with habitat best suited for northern pike, bluegill and walleyes.  Latoka\u0019s close proximity to Alexandria and its clear water make it popular with boaters and anglers alike.  Shoreline development density (homes per mile of shoreline) is the fourth highest in Douglas County at 30.2 homes per mile of shoreline.  Approximately 40 percent of the shoreline has been altered from its natural state.  <br> \n   <br> \nLake Latoka supports an over-abundance of small northern pike, a well structured largemouth bass population, average bluegill and black crappie populations and a low density walleye population made up of large fish. <br> \n    <br> \nNorthern pike abundance well above what is considered healthy.  Average numbers of northern pike sampled during eight assessments since 1981 was 14.0/gillnet.  Gillnets catches in the range of 3.0 - 7.9/net are typical of lakes similar to Lake Latoka.  Average length of pike captured in 2008 was 18.2 inches.  Growth rates are slow.  Ten-year-old catches averaged 27.0 inches in length.  Nearly 75% of the population measured 13.0 -19.0 inches in length.  A special fishing regulation is currently in effect that requires the release of all northern pike between 24.0 and 36.0 inches.  The goal of the regulation is to shift the population to larger-sized fish by promoting harvest of small pike and returning medium-size catches.  Because the regulation has only been in effect since 2003, conclusive evidence as to its effectiveness cannot be ascertained at this time.  Success of the regulation is dependent upon a willingness of anglers to catch and keep small pike.   <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass are moderately abundant.  Spring electrofishing catches averaged 45.0 bass/hour.  Individual lengths ranged from 9.0-16.1 inches, averaging 12.0 inches.  Anglers report catching largemouth bass approaching 20.0 inches in total length.  <br> \n   <br> \nLake Latoka has a reputation for producing trophy walleyes.  Presently, walleye abundance (1.6/gillnet) appears to be down from a long term average of 6.4/gillnet.  Gillnet captures ranged from 8.3 - 28.2 inches with 79% of the sample measuring over 17.0 inches.  Long term data indicate that abundance of walleyes larger than 20.0 inches are increasing.   <br> \n <br> \nBluegill catches averaged 11.8/trapnet which is lower than anticipated but within the range of normal for similar lakes.  Bluegill grow slow in Lake Latoka so 8.0 inch or larger fish are not common.  Average length of 2009 captures was 5.4 inches.   <br> \n    <br> \nImportant prey fishes found in Latoka include yellow perch, tullibee and white sucker.  Survey catches of all three species are low suggesting a predator/prey imbalance. <br> \n     <br> \nAnglers have requested special regulations be considered to address what they see as over-harvest of crappie.  Special trapnetting was therefore conducted in May of 2008 and 2009 to better determine population characteristics.  Average length of black crappies measured was 9.1 inches.  Twenty-two percent of captures were greater than 10.0 inches.  A public input meeting will be held in late 2010 to determine if special fishing regulations for Lake Latoka will receive further consideration. <br> \n</p>",

Backpack electrofishing and/or seining were conducted at 14 stations, representing a variety of habitat types, along the shoreline of Lake Latoka.  The survey was conducted during the five-year sampling window for intensive monitoring efforts within the Long Prairie River watershed, and will be contributing to a watershed assessment process in coordination with Minnesota Pollution Control Agency.\n\nSixteen species were collected during this survey.  Seven species (Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, Least Darter, Pugnose Shiner, and Rock Bass) were considered \"intolerant\" and one species (Green Sunfish) was considered \"tolerant\" based on current tolerance classifications for Minnesota lakes. \n\nNearshore catch data will be used along with gill and trap net catch data to develop an Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) score, which is indicative of the health of Lake Latoka.</p>",

Walleyes averaged 3.1 fish/ gillnet. Walleye stocking records correspond favorably with the current Walleye age-class distribution. Growth rates of Walleyes appears to be good. Cisco are present in the lake and are probably used extensively by large Northern Pike and Walleyes for forage. Northern Pike abundance is high and the average size is small. However, there appears to be s favorable size distribution with 10% of the Northern Pike sampled being over 25 largemouth bass and Black Crappies also are present and should provide good fishing.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Latoka is a 767-acre lake located about two miles west of the City of Alexandria.  The basin has a maximum depth of 108.0 feet and average depth of 42.0 feet.  The lake has exceptional water quality.  Summer water transparency measurements within the northern portion of the lake average 13.3 feet.  Total productivity from a fisheries management perspective is moderate due to the lake's limited fertility and littoral area.  Only 35% of the surface area of Lake Latoka is less than 15.0 feet in depth.  This shallow area with sunlight penetration and active aquatic plant growth is considered the most productive area of lakes.  Even with modest carrying capacity, Lake Latoka supports a diverse fish community and good fishing opportunities. <br> \n <br> \nA standardized fish community survey was completed on July 23, 2015.  Fish sampling gear included trap nets and gill nets.  The netting portion of the survey was augmented with a night electrofishing survey on June 8, 2015, to better estimate abundance and size distribution of the Largemouth Bass population. <br> \n <br> \nElectrofishing catches of Largemouth Bass were lower than that of prior surveys.  Age distribution of captures extended to age 10, but annual recruitment of young bass into the population appeared limited since 2005.  Bass captures ranged from 9.7 to 18.8 inches and averaged 15.4 inches.  One Smallmouth Bass was captured during the electrofishing survey.  This was the first recorded catch of this gamefish.  Another 19 Smallmouth Bass were captured in nets.  Four age classes were documented in this limited catch, which indicated Lake Latoka now supports a self-sustaining Smallmouth Bass population.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike are excessively abundant.  Gill net catches averaged 18.5-pike/net.   Due to the high population density, growth is slow.  Average size of captures was 18.8 inches.  The largest Northern Pike recorded in the 2015 survey measured 32.5 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nLarge Walleye fingerlings and yearlings are stocked to sustain this popular fishery.  A gill net catch rate of 6.5-fish/net describes a moderate population density.  Walleyes grow well in Lake Latoka and age distribution of gill net captures extended to age 18, so the lake can offer good opportunities to catch large Walleyes.  Captures of 25.0-inch and larger Walleyes have been common among all surveys. <br> \n <br> \nSunfishes are abundant in Lake Latoka, particularly Bluegills and Pumpkinseed Sunfish.  A relatively high proportion of Bluegill captures were four-years-old or younger, thus average size of Bluegill captures was 5.6 inches.  Due to their excessive abundance, Bluegill growth is too slow to optimize fishing quality potential.  Few 8.0-inch Bluegills have been captured among surveys.  Rock Bass catches during the 2015 survey were also elevated.   Gill net captures averaged 8.6 inches in length.  Many Rock Bass captures exceeded 10.0 inches in length.  Black Crappies are less abundant than other sunfishes, but the population can offer good fishing.  Crappie recruitment was good in 2010.  Those five-year-old crappies captured during the 2015 survey averaged 11.1 inches in length. <br> \n <br> \nLake Latoka has the depth and water quality to sustain a Cisco population.  Cisco, commonly called tullibees, is a coldwater fish intolerant of water temperatures exceeding 70 degrees F.  Lake Latoka becomes thermally stratified during summer months.  The thermocline was detected below 30.0 feet at time of the 2015 survey.  There proved to be sufficient dissolved oxygen and cooler water temperatures at this depth during the summer to provide suitable habitat for the Cisco population.  Ciscos are considered high fat, high value prey for Northern Pike and Walleyes.  They also grow large enough to add to the lake's overall fishery.  The largest Cisco captured measured 18.3 inches. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers are strongly encouraged to harvest the surplus of small Northern Pike (< 21.0 inches) to reduce pike density, release some excessive predatory pressure off the Yellow Perch population, and increase survival of stocked Walleyes.  Releasing medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish and should provide anglers with opportunities to catch more large fish in the future.   <br> \n <br> \nLake Latoka is designated as an infested waterbody due to the presence of zebra mussels, which were first confirmed in 2014.  Regulations restricting bait harvest and transport of water apply to this basin.

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Latoka is a deep, 767-acre basin located about two miles west of Alexandria in Douglas County.  Mean and maximum depths are 42 and 108 feet, respectively.  The lake is split into a north bay and a south bay (often referred to as \"Little Latoka\") but both bays are connected by a navigable channel below Interstate 94.  Boaters should be aware of a new \"no wake zone\" ordinance within this channel.  Lake Latoka is located within the Long Prairie River watershed.  Residential development surrounds the entire shoreline.  Water quality and clarity are exceptional.  Water clarity measurements typically exceed 15 feet throughout the summer and have increased in recent years following zebra mussel infestation.  Two public accesses are present.  One is located on the north shoreline of the north bay off Latoka Beach Road NW.  A popular swimming beach is adjacent to this access.  The other public access is located on the north shoreline of the south bay off Vonderheide Drive SW.  Lake Latoka is a popular lake and recreational pressure can be heavy at times, especially on weekends and holidays during summer months.\n\nA standard MN DNR lake survey was completed in 2021 to assess the fish community of Lake Latoka.  Lake Latoka is known as a trophy Walleye fishery.  Walleye abundance is typically lower than that of similar Minnesota lakes, but average size is much larger.  In 2021, average size was 20.4 inches and 3.5 pounds.  Over 20% of Walleyes captured in gill nets exceeded 25 inches in length with the largest measuring 29.3 inches.  Trophy potential is high due to an abundant Tullibee (Cisco) population that provides ample forage and an age structure comprised of older fish.  Almost 18% of the gill net sample was age 10 or older and the oldest Walleye was age 21.  Northern Pike remained abundant.  Similar to many lakes in west-central Minnesota, small \"hammerhandle\" pike dominated the population.  Mean pike size was just 18.3 inches and 1.5 pounds.  Larger pike, some exceeding 30.0 inches, were also sampled.  New Northern Pike zone regulations were implemented in 2018 to help improve pike size structure.  Lake Latoka is located in the North-central Zone.  Anglers can now keep up to 10 pike but not more than two can be over 26 inches in length.  All pike between 22-26 inches must be immediately released.  Quality panfishing opportunities are somewhat limited and most effort is targeted at Black Crappie.  Crappie populations can be \"boom or bust\" but this population typically exhibits low to moderate abundance with a favorable size structure.  Bluegill and Yellow Perch are also present but growth rates for both species are slow resulting in smaller average size and limited availability of harvestable-size fish.  Only one Bluegill and one Yellow Perch exceeding 8 inches in length were sampled in 2021.  Both Largemouth and Smallmouth Bass are present in Lake Latoka.  Largemouth Bass are more abundant but the Smallmouth Bass population is expanding.  Similar to Walleye, bass populations in Lake Latoka tend to exhibit lower abundances, larger average sizes, and older age structures than populations in similar Minnesota lakes.  Largemouth Bass up to age 18 and Smallmouth Bass up to age 11 were collected in 2021.  The largest bass collected in spring electrofishing efforts was just shy of 19 inches for both species.\n       \nOther species sampled during the 2021 survey included Bowfin (Dogfish), Hybrid Sunfish, Pumpkinseed, Rock Bass, Shorthead Redhorse, and White Sucker.  The next standard lake survey is tentatively scheduled for 2027.\n\nLake Latoka is designated as an infested waterbody due to the presence of zebra mussels.  Adult zebra mussels were first confirmed in 2013.  Regulations restricting bait harvest and transport of water apply to this basin.  Anglers are reminded to drain boats and equipment prior to moving between bodies of water to minimize the risk of transferring aquatic invasive species to other lakes.

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of nearshore fish species in Latoka Lake was conducted on July 18-20, 2022, by DNR Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program staff. Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake, and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at all 14 sampling stations. Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample eight stations and a 15-foot seine was used at six stations. Nearshore sampling captured 18 species of fish including seven species that are intolerant of disturbance (i.e., Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, Pugnose Shiner, Rock Bass, and Smallmouth Bass) and one that is tolerant of disturbance (i.e., Green Sunfish). <br> \n <br> \nA summer trap net survey was also conducted by IBI Program staff on July 18-20, 2022. Twelve trap nets were set along the shoreline in locations that encompassed multiple habitat types. Trap net sampling captured 12 species of fish, including two that are tolerant of disturbance (i.e., Common Carp and Green Sunfish).  <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore and trap net were combined with h gill net data from a 2021 survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based IBI (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment. In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g., Banded Killifish, Blacknose Shiner, and Blackchin Shiner), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g., Fathead Minnow, Black Bullhead, and Green Sunfish). The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.  <br> \n <br> \nResults from this survey indicate that the fish community in Latoka Lake is healthy as indicated by an FIBI score that is above the general use threshold determined for similar lakes. Data from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Long Prairie River Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency. <br> \n</p>",

Fingerlings were stocked again in 1989 after the survey was completed. Population size structure has shifted to a greater percentage of smaller fish. This decline in average size may be due to annual stockings and thus more small fish in the population, fishing pressure, selective for larger fish or sampling error. Mean weight of captured Walleye has declined from 3.96 lbs. in 1976 to 2.21 lbs. in the 1989 survey. An evaluation of natural reproduction is difficult to assess since there are few years in which Walleye were not stocked. Any fish produced in 1988 were not year vulnerable to capture in gillnets. Growth rates are acceptable. Four year old Walleye averaged 16.7 inches in total length. Northern Pike abundance, as estimated by gillnet catch rate, continues to increase. Gillnet CPUE values increased from 6.5 Northern Pike/net in 1976 to 20.6 Northern Pike/net in 1989. Coupled with this increase in CPUE is a respective decrease in mean weight from a 2.0 lbs. average in 1976 to only a 1.0 lb./fish in 1989. Size structure in- dices reflect this change in size distribution. The percentage of quality-size individuals has decreased from 38.0 to 11.0 percent. Northern Pike appear to grow slow until they reach approx. 20.0 inches in total length. Once they attain 20.0 inches their growth rate increases, possibly in response to a shift to a Tullibee diet. Despite the increase in Northern Pike abundance, the Tullibee population also seems to be increasing. Gillnet catches have steadily increased from 0.08 Tullibee/net in 1976 to 5.17 Tullibee/net in 1989. Mean weight has remained constant at 0.5 lb average. Yellow Perch catch rates remain low; however, most Yellow Perch may be too small to be captured in standard sampling gear. Bluegill are abundance. Size distribution has improved steadily. The percentage of quality-size fish has increased to 48.0 percent. No preferred size fish were captured. Growth rates are extremely slow. Five year old Bluegill averaged only 4.45 inches in total length. Largemouth Bass and black crappie were not adequately sampled; however, net catches indicate their presence. Age 3 bass averaged 9.0 inches in length. Black crappies growth rates were slow for this area. Four year old fish were only 8.0 inches in total length. Black, Brown, and Yellow Bullhead CPUE values are low. Most fish are relatively large. No carp were captured in the 1989 survey.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Latoka is a relatively deep lake with steep drop offs.  Submergent vegetation is common in shallowzones, however emergent vegetation is limited to a few areas.  Extensive shoreline development haslikely impacted the distribution of emergent vegetation and poses a threat to water quality which iscurrently considered good.   Walleye catch rate averaged 6.0 fish/gillnet.  Previous catches have ranged from 2.9 - 5.7 fish/net insurveys dating back to 1981.  The normal range of mean catch rates from lakes with similar chemical andphysical characteristics is 3.0 - 8.2 fish/net.  The size structure of the population is desirable andshould enhance fishing quality.  The mean weight of fish captured was 2.4 pounds.  It is difficult todetermine the effectiveness of past walleye fingerling stockings.  Nearly annual stocking and thestocking of mixed age fish does not allow for evaluation of natural reproduction.  Annual fingerlingstocking from 1984 through 1987 did not appear to increase walleye abundance.  However walleye seekingthermal refuge at depths of up to 28 feet may not be effectively sampled by standard gillnet sets. Northern pike catch rate decreased from 20.6 fish/gillnet in 1989 to 9.4 fish/gillnet in 1993.  Catchrates averaged 11.3 and 9.2 fish/net in 1986 and 1981.  The average weight of fish captured was 1.4pounds.   Larger northern pike may have been suspended at depths which were not sampled with standardgillnet sets.  Largemouth bass are very abundant.  Electrofishing yielded 116 fish per hour.  Theaverage  size of fish captured was about one pound.  Bluegill are also abundant.  Trapnet catch rateaveraged 45.3 fish/net in 1993.  Catch rates have been stable in previous surveys averaging 47.5, 64.7,and 56.3 fish/trapnet in 1989, 1986, and 1981, respectively.  Approximately one half of the fishsampled were greater than 6 inches in length, however few exceeded 8.0 inches in length.  Yellow perchabundance is low.  Gillnet catch rate averaged 2.4 fish/net which is below the normal range of meancatch rates for similar lakes (5.0 - 27.4 fish/net).  Historical catch rates from surveys dating backto 1976 ranged from 0.7 - 2.0 fish/gillnet.  Northern pike are likely suppressing yellow perch numbers. Ciscos are also present in Lake Latoka and may provide a large prey item for predators inhabiting deepthermal refuges during summer months.       </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Latoka, located southwest of Alexandria, is a heavily developed lake with very good water quality.  The mid-summer Secchi reading was 13.0 feet.  Submergent vegetation is common around the basin.  Emergent vegetation such as hardstem bulrush is limited.  Lake Latoka receives heavy recreational use during summer months.  A public swim beach is located on the north end of the lake, adjacent to one of two public accesses on the lake.Walleye gillnet catches averaged 6.8 fish per net which is similar to previous survey results.  Mean weight of sampled fish was 3.0 pounds.  Mean length of sampled fish was 19.9 inches.  The largest fish measured 29.6 inches.  Lake Latoka is known for its yields of large walleye. Northern pike remain abundant, but small.  Gillnet catches averaged 16.8 fish per net which exceeded previous survey results.  Mean weight of sampled fish was 1.3 pounds. Mean length was 18.0 inches.  The largest fish measured 29.8 inches.  A 24-36\" protective slot regulation was implemented in 2003 to improve the quality of the northern pike fishery.  It is too soon to adequately evaluate the regulation's effectiveness.  Anglers must harvest excessive numbers of small pike to maximize potential benefits.Bluegill remain abundant.  Trapnet catches averaged 28.6 fish per net.  Mean length of sampled fish was 6.5 inches, however, few fish exceeded 8.0 inches.Largemouth bass electrofishing efforts resulted in a catch of 60.0 fish per hour.  Forty-one percent of the sampled fish exceeded 12.0 inches with 24% exceeding 15.0 inches.  The largest fish measured 17.7 inches.  Mean length of captured bass was 13.2 inches.</p>",
