                "narrative": "<p>Clear Lake is a 132-acre lake located in northwest Itasca County one mile north of Wirt, MN.   An Itasca County administered access is located off County Road 31 on the eastern shore with parking for two vehicles along the shoulder of the road.  Clear Lake has a maximum depth of 30 feet and 39% of the lake is 15 feet or less.  Water chemistry analysis indicates low to moderate hardness and fertility.   The lake's water is fairly clear resulting in visibility to 11 feet.  The depth of water at which oxygen levels limit fish presence has varied between 18 and 23 feet in mid-summer.  Other area lakes with similar habitat include Dead Horse, Trestle, McCarthy and Shamrock.  <br> \n <br> \nThe 2017 survey was the eighth survey of the fish community since 1960.  This survey was conducted to monitor the fish community for changes in species composition, abundance, size structure and growth.   The gamefish species that are best suited for the lake are Northern Pike, Bluegill and Largemouth Bass.  The 2009 management plan indicated Northern Pike were the primary management species due to the population having low density and above average size distribution.  Bluegill were a secondary management species due to their population having moderate density, while Black Crappie were a secondary management species due to angler interest.  Additionally, Walleye were a secondary management species due to angler interest and because Walleye are being stocked.     <br> \n <br> \nThe Northern Pike population has low density, good size distribution and average growth.  The gill-net catch (1.3/net) was below average for the lake and for lakes with similar habitat.  Lengths ranged from 18 to 26 inches, with an average of 23 inches.  The proportion sampled greater than 21 inches was above average for the second consecutive survey; however, pike greater than 28 inches have only been sampled in 3 surveys.  Ages ranged from 3 to 6, with age 6 most common.  Growth was similar to average, resulting in pike taking four years to exceed 21 inches.  Neascus (Black spot), a small parasite that encysts and produces black pigmentation around it, was observed on 74% of pike examined the past four surveys and likely reduces angler interest.  Although unsightly, filets are safe to consume if well cooked.  Due to the lake's small size it is recommended that anglers release fish over 26 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nThe Walleye population has low density, larger individuals and below average growth.  The gill-net catch (0.5/net) was below average for the lake and for lakes with similar habitat for the second consecutive survey.  Declines in the number of Walleye in recent decades are likely due to changes in the fish community such as declines in the number of perch.  Additionally, lakes with similar habitats typically do not support viable Walleye fisheries.  Four Walleye were sampled in 2017 that ranged from 19 to 26 inches and from age 9 to 15.  Although low in number, the lake does have trophy potential with five fish over 25 inches and one fish over 30 inches sampled between all surveys.  Growth was below average, resulting in it taking six years to exceed 15 inches. <br> \n <br> \nThe Bluegill population has moderate density and below average size distribution and growth.  The trap-net catch (15.7/net) was similar to the average for the lake and for lakes with similar habitat.  Gill-net catches the past two surveys were the two highest, potentially indicating an increasing trend in number.  Lengths ranged from 3 to 8 inches with an average of 6 inches.  The proportions of Bluegill sampled greater than 6 inches was above average the past two surveys, while fish greater than 8 inches were sampled for the first time since 1975.  Ages ranged from 3 to 12, with age 6 most common.  Growth was below average, resulting in it taking seven years to exceed 6 inches.  Due to the lake's small size it is recommended that anglers release fish over 8 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nThe Black Crappie population has low density and poor size distribution.  Both the gill-net catch (1.7/net) and trap-net catch (1.4/net) were above average for the lake and for lakes with similar habitat.  Lengths ranged from 5 to 9 inches, with an average of 8 inches.  Only four 10+ inch fish have ever been sampled, indicating consistently poor size structure.  Growth was below average, resulting in it taking five years to exceed 8 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nThe Largemouth Bass population has low density, average size distribution and below average growth.  Bass were first sampled in 1993 and have been sampled in each survey since.  A night electrofishing survey has not yet occurred.  Twelve bass were sampled in 2017, the most sampled in any survey to date.  Lengths ranged from 5 to 18 inches, with an average of 9 inches.  A fish greater than 15 inches was sampled for the first time (18.1 inches).  Ages ranged from 2 to 12.  Growth was below average, resulting in bass taking six years to exceed 12 inches.  Due to the lake's small size it is recommended that anglers release fish over 15 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nThe Yellow Perch population has low density and a limited number of harvestable sized fish.  The gill-net catch (9.2/net) was below average for the lake.  While catches were high and averaged 133.9/net the first three surveys, they have declined substantially and averaged 10.1/net the past four surveys.  Low perch numbers likely limit the number of Walleye and other gamefish and survival rates of stocked Walleye.  Lengths ranged from 5 to 10 inches, with an average of 7 inches.  Only 8% of perch ever sampled have exceeded 8 inches, while only 2% have exceeded 10 inches.  The consistently poor size structure likely reduces angler interest.  Growth was below average, resulting in it taking six years to exceed 8 inches.   Ninety percent of perch examined the past four surveys had either yellow grub or Neascus (Black spot), likely reducing angler interest.  Although both are unsightly, fillets are safe to consume if well cooked.  <br> \n <br> \nThe other species sampled were Brown Bullhead, Pumpkinseed Sunfish and White Sucker.    <br> \n <br> \nIn order to maintain or improve fish and wildlife populations, water quality and habitat must be protected.  People often associate water quality problems with large-scale agricultural, forestry, urban development or industrial practices in the watershed.  In reality, the impact of land use decisions on one lake lot may be relatively small, yet the cumulative impact of those decisions on many lake lots can result in a significant decline in water quality and habitat.  For example, removing shoreline and aquatic vegetation, fertilizing lawns, mowing to the water's edge, installing beach sand blankets, failing septic systems and uncontrolled run-off, all contribute excess nutrients and sediment which degrade water quality and habitat.  Understanding these cumulative impacts and taking steps to avoid or minimize them will help to insure our quality fisheries can be enjoyed by future generations. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers and boaters are reminded to help stop the spread of invasive species by removing all aquatic plants from boats, trailers, and equipment.  All drain plugs must be removed and live and bait wells must be drained before leaving the access.  Anglers and boaters are encouraged to power wash and thoroughly dry all equipment prior to use in another water body. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Clear Lake is located 3 miles east of Dora Lake and is in northern Itasca County.  The lake is 132 acres and 30 ft deep.  The fish community includes walleye, northern pike, and panfish.  A Forest Service campground is located across the highway on Noma Lake. Walleye gill-net catch was 1.3/set which is equal to the average walleye gill-net catch for lakes of similar size, depth, and habitat.  Walleye size structure was good and all the fish sampled were greater than 17 inches.  Walleye fingerlings were last stocked in 1996 and 1991.  In this assessment, three of the eight walleye sampled were from these two stocked year classes, the remaining walleye were from natural reproduction.  Reproduction appears to be sporadic with a good year class produced in 1995.  Walleye growth was higher than statewide averages with fish reaching 16 inches by their third year.  Anglers should keep in mind that most walleye which are greater than 19 inches in length are females.  Thus to ensure a quality walleye population, anglers should consider releasing walleye greater than 19 inches.  Northern pike gill-net catch was 2.7/set which is slightly lower than the expected range for similar lakes.  Size structure was generally poor with no fish exceeding 28 inches.  Northern pike growth was similar to statewide averages for ages 1 to 3, and slower than statewide averages for ages 4 to 6.  Northern pike in Clear Lake reach 20 inches in 5 years.Largemouth bass gill-net catch was 1.3/set which is within the expected range for similar lakes.   Size structure was poor and no fish greater than 12 inches were sampled in this assessment.  Bluegill trap-net catch was 3.0/set which is lower than the expected range for similar lakes.  Bluegill size was poor and dominated by fish under 4 inches.  Black crappie trap-net catch was 1.0/set which is within the expected range.  Yellow perch gill-net catch was 3.2/set which is also within the expected range.  Most of the yellow perch were small, however, a few fish exceeded quality size of 8 inches.</p>",

The fish community primarily consists of northern pike and panfish.  A modest population of walleye exists through stocking.  A US Forest Service campground is located across the road on Noma Lake. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike were sampled at a rate lower than lakes similar to Clear Lake, however size structure is considered moderate indicated by an average length of almost 25 inches in sampled pike.  Growth exceeded the statewide average for young ages and was similar to the statewide average by age five. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill were abundant in both trap nets and gill nets.  The trap net catch rate was within the lake class expected range.  The average length for gill net sampled bluegill was 6.3 inches and 5.5 inches for trap net sampled fish indicating poor size structure.  No bluegill were sampled over 7.2 inches. <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled black crappie within the expected range while the trap net catch rate was below the expected range.  Size structure was poor with no fish exceeding nine inches in the sample.  The average length for gill net sampled fish was 7.5 inches. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch were sampled in gill nets at a rate within the expected range for similar lakes, and was above the historical low sampled in the previous assessment.  Lengths ranged from five to eleven inches, however, the average length was about six inches. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled include brown bullhead, largemouth bass, pumpkinseed sunfish, white sucker, and one walleye. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",
