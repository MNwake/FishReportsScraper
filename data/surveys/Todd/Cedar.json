                "narrative": "<p>       Cedar Lake is a clear water lake with light development and is bordered by Highway 71.   Development is restricted around the lake due to roadways near the west and north shores and marsh areas on the south.  Water clarity was good with a secchi disk reading of 13 feet in mid-August which allows vegetation to grow to depths of 19 feet.  Flatstem pondweed and coontail were the most common submergent plants found in the lake.  Sand was the most abundant shallow water substrate.  The lake has very little fishing structure other than weedlines and a steeper drop-off along the west side.  Cedar Lake supports a variety of fish species including largemouth bass, northern pike, bluegill, black crappie, and walleye. This variety attracts anglers on a regular basis. <br> \n       Northern pike  abundance appears to have gone down since the last survey and is at a historic low for the lake.  Most anglers would call the pike \"hammerhandles\" as the average size was 18 inches or 1.3 pounds.  Only one of the pike caught was more than 24 inches in length.   Walleye abundance appears to have increased, but, remains within the normal range when compared to similar type lakes.  The walleye population is maintained through both fall fingerling stocking and natural reproduction.   All of the walleye caught in the summer survey were between 14 and 17 inches in length.  Cedar Lake has an abundant largemouth bass population.  The electrofishing bass catch rate was one of the highest in the area.  Most of the bass were small (7.5 to 10 inches in length).  There were some bass over 16 inches caught in the electrofishing effort with the largest at 19 inches.  Yellow perch numbers continue to be lower than desired.  It is anticipated that with the low northern pike numbers, the perch population will have a chance to increase in abundance. <br> \n       A panfish assessment was conducted in early June of 2009 to evaluate the bluegill and black crappie populations.  The assessment sampled a fair number bluegill, but black crappie abundance appears to be low as few crappie were caught in both the spring and summer nets.  Average size of the bluegill caught in the spring assessment was about 7 inches with one up to 9 inches observed.  Anglers who can locate the crappie have a chance to catch some up to 11 inches,  as some were netted in assessments.  Pumpkinseed sunfish were also common in the spring assessment as were hybrid sunfish.   <br> \n       Two species of bullhead, brown and yellow, were caught in the 2009 summer survey with the  yellow bullhead the most numerous.   Yellow bullhead can be an indicator of good water quality as they are less tolerant of turbid water than brown or black bullhead.  The single brown bullhead was over 12 inches and many of the yellow bullhead were over 11 inches in length.  Bowfin or dogfish abundance appears to be normal for this type of lake and although most anglers are not happy to see a dogfish on their line, the fish can provide some exciting fishing. <br> \n       Protecting the water quality in Cedar Lake should be a high priority for the State, County, and lakeshore owners.  Since development on the lake is restricted, road run-off and nutrients via the inlets would likely have the most impact on the lake.   Anglers are encouraged to keep the northern pike under 24 inches in length and release the larger pike as well as limiting their harvest of the larger bluegill.   These practices will help provide a more balanced fish community. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Cedar Lake is a 158 acre basin with a maximum depth of 28 feet.  The lake is characterized by a low level of shoreline development and excellent water quality.  Summer water clarity regularly exceeds 17 feet and nutrient levels are low when compared to other lakes in central Minnesota.    A panfish assessment was conducted on Cedar Lake in early June of 2015 to better evaluate Bluegill and Black Crappie populations.  Panfish, Bluegill in particular, provides an important fishery in the area. <br> \n     Three panfish trap net assessments have been conducted on Cedar Lake since 2003.    Spring trap nets have shown a noticeable improvement in Bluegill size structure.  Bluegill averaged over 7 inches long in the 2015 trap nets with about 20% surpassing 8 inches and a fair number over 9 inches.  Sunfish take 5-8 years to reach \"keeper\" size so excessive harvest of these fish could quickly reduce panfish quality in a lake of this size.  Black Crappie abundance has also shown a recent improvement based on 2015 sampling.   Most of the crappies observed were in the 8-10 inch range but a few larger fish were present.  Average size is about 9 inches. <br> \n</p>",

Nine trap nets were set along the shoreline in a variety of habitat types.  Net catches were light.  Yellow Bullhead, Bowfin, and Northern Pike were the most abundant species by biomass and Bluegill were most abundant by number. <br> \n <br> \nData from this trap net survey is combined with data from a standard gill net survey and a nearshore survey in 2015 to calculate a Fish-based Index of Biological Integrity (FIBI) score that describes the overall health of the lake. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment.  The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. The FIBI score for Cedar Lake based on this survey is above the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes.  For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website. <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Sauk River Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.   <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A population estimate for Largemouth Bass was conducted in the fall of 2021 on Cedar Lake.  Fish were captured via daytime electrofishing performed during five separate days from September 7 to October 14.  A sampling effort using angling took place October 6th in an attempt to provide an additional gear type and reduce sampling bias.  All bass 250 mm (about 10 inches) or greater were netted and marked with a partial left pelvic fin clip to provide for the mark-recapture estimate.  Smaller bass were not netted, therefore catch rates and size structure comparisons cannot be made to electrofishing efforts from previous years.   <br> \n   <br> \nElectrofishing provided a sample of 259 measured fish and a catch rate of 51.6/hr. for bass 250 mm or larger.  Angling produced a sample of 63 fish 250 mm or longer.  Bass over 12 inches comprised 63.7% of the combined angling/electrofishing catch, though fish over 16 inches accounted for only about 1.6% of the total and only 1 fish exceeded 18 inches.  Four of the five bass 16 inches or longer were caught by angling, as was the largest fish which was 18.3 inches.  Mean length was 12.4 inches for electrofished bass and 12.7 inches for angled fish.  The mark-recapture method produced a population estimate of 835 bass (6.0/acre) that were 250 mm or longer.  Population estimates for Largemouth Bass have been conducted in the past on three other similar size lakes, Moose, Pierz Fish and Green Prairie Fish.  Moose Lake was estimated to contain 2,495 bass 250 mm or longer (19.3/acre).  The estimate for Pierz Fish Lake was 1,982 bass 250 mm or longer (10.5/acre) and the Green Prairie population was estimated at 1,467 bass 250 mm or longer (8.1/acre).  The results for Cedar Lake suggest a somewhat lower density of bass than was found on the three lakes previously studied.  The angling effort and electrofishing data collected during this project suggest the lake supports a moderate number of bass, with the bulk of the fish in the 12-14 inch range.  The fish were willing biters during the angling effort and a few larger fish up to 18 inches were caught. <br> \n <br> \nThe only other fish netted during this population estimate was a Walleye that measured 20.5 inches.  One Walleye was also caught angling but not measured as were a small number of Northern Pike.   <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Cedar Lake is a mesotrophic or moderately fertile bass-panfish lake in centralMinnesota.  The access, off Highway 71, is basically undeveloped (gravel) and bestsuited to medium and smaller boats.  Water clarity is quite good for a lake locatedin this area of the state.  Dense vegetation beds are found in the shoal watersaround the shoreline with some submerged vegetation extending out to 18 feet ofwater.  Lakeshore development has been restricted around much of the lake due toroads on the west and north sides and marsh on the south end.            Cedar Lake supports a variety of fish species that attract anglers includinglargemouth bass, northern pike, bluegill, black crappies, and walleye.  Northernpike numbers have declined since 1991 and are comparable with management goals forthe lake.  A lower pike population may encourage an increase in yellow perchabundance and decrease competition with and predation on walleye fingerlings. Walleye stocking appears to have been successful in producing an additional anglingopportunity on the lake.  Stocking began in 1987 and has continued on an everythird year stocking schedule.  The presence of several of the year classes suggestsome natural reproduction may be occurring and continued stocking may not benecessary.  The number and size of the walleye were above average for lakes similarto Cedar.  The lake has an excellent largemouth bass population in both abundanceand size.  While the average size was about thirteen inches, fish up to nineteeninches were measured.  With slow growth rates being observed in the bass, catch andrelease is encouraged to maintain the quality in the population.     Yellow perch numbers continue to be low for this lake class and this couldhave a negative impact on the remainder of the fish community.  Perch are theprincipal prey species for walleye and northern pike.  Perch can also beinstrumental in helping maintain a well balanced bluegill population with fastgrowing, quality individuals.     Cedar is a popular bluegill lake in the area.  Black crappies and pumpkinseedswere also present in the survey.  The panfish sampled were small to average sizeby anglers standards.  Some bluegills were up seven inches long and one 10-inchcrappie was measured.  Large panfish typically are difficult to assess withstandard lake survey gear.  Roughfish species in Cedar include yellow bullheads,brown bullheads, and bowfin or dogfish.     Neascus was common on most of the northern pike and some of the bluegills. Neascus is a black trematode or parasite going from snails to fish to a fish-eatingbird, such as herons, to mature.  Humans can not be infested.  Skinning the fishremoves most of the parasite and cooking will kill the rest.     Water quality in Cedar Lake is very good for central Minnesota and should beprotected.  Since development on lake is restricted, road run-off and nutrients viathe inlet would likely have the most impact on water quality.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Cedar Lake supports a variety of fish species that attract anglers such as largemouth bass, northern pike, bluegill, black crappies, and walleye.  The access for the lake just off of Highway 71 is basically undeveloped (gravel) and best suited to medium and smaller boats.  Lakeshore developement has been restricted around much of the lake due to roads on the west and north sides and marsh on the south end.    Of the gamefish species, northern pike are the most numerous and easiest to catch.   Pike numbers appear to have increased from the last survey and are at a record high for the lake. Along with the increase in abundance has been a decrease in average size, dropping from an average of 21 inches to 20 inches in length.  A decline was seen in walleye abundance but the fish caught in the survey were big, over 19 inches in length.  Walleye fingerlings are stocked in Cedar Lake every other year.  High pike numbers can also suppress yellow perch numbers which could have several undesirable effects including predation upon young gamefish.  Yellow perch can be an important prey species that maintains good growth rates of the gamefish and have been found to have a positive effect on maintaining a balanced bluegill population of fast growing, quality individuals.  No perch were caught in the 2003 survey and past surveys also recorded low perch numbers.    Cedar Lake has a healthy largemouth bass population.  Average size apparent from sampling efforts was about 14 inches.  Larger bass up to 18 inches were observed but finding them could be difficult.  Locating large bluegills could also be a challenge.  The lake has an abundant population of bluegills but the average size from the summer survey was about 5 inches.  A spring assessment targeting panfish was also done in early June on the lake.  Some of the larger adult fish were in the shallows for spawning and some nice fish up to 9 inches were observed.  Pumpkinseeds are also abundant and the population dominated by small to medium size fish.  The spring netting did capture some larger pumpkinseed up to 8 inches in length.  Black crappies are also present in Cedar Lake but numbers appear to be low and the fish small to medium in size.    Two species of bullheads, brown and yellow, are in the lake with the yellow bullheads being the most numerous.  Average size of the bullheads was an impressive 11 inches with some measuring up to 14 inches.  Bowfin or dogfish and hybrid sunfish were two additional species caught during the survey.      Neascus or black spot was common on the northern pike.  Neascus is a trematode or parasite that is usually found in the skin of the fish.  The life cycle of the parasite also includes snails and fish-eating birds, such as herons and bitterns.  Skinning the fish removes most of the parasites and cooking the fish will kill the rest.  Humans cannot be infested.    Water clarity during the survey was about average for a lake in this area of the state but had been twice as good in the last survey in 1997.  Since developement on the lake is restricted, road run-off and nutrients via the inlet would likely have the most impact on water quality.  Anglers are encouraged to keep the northern pike under 24 inches in length and release the larger pike.  This will help toward a more balanced fish community.</p>",

The average lakewide habitat score was 70.6 (+/- 3.0) out of 100 possible.

                "narrative": "<p>This survey used gill nets and electrofishing to evaluate Walleye, Northern Pike, Yellow Perch and Largemouth Bass fisheries and is an update from the last standard survey completed in 2015. <br> \n <br> \nGoals outlined in the management plan are, for the most part, meeting expectations for targeted species mentioned. We found Walleyes and Largemouth Bass doing very well and Northern Pike maintaining stable numbers without becoming too abundant. Yellow Perch on the other hand are very low in abundance which is of concern since they're a prey species important to Walleyes.  <br> \n <br> \nCedar Lake is primarily a bass/panfish lake which, in this area, are usually smaller in size, have decent water clarity and support a diversity of submerged aquatic plants. However, we often stock Walleyes in such lakes to provide bonus fisheries to anglers. This is the case for Cedar. A Walleye fingerling stocking in 2019 resulted in good numbers of 3-year old fish caught in our gill nets. These Walleyes were 17-20 inches in length which represents very good growth.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike often become overly abundant in Area lakes which can present several problems to the fish community. At this time, we don't see this problem in Cedar. Average individual size of pike however is less than 21 inches which is not the best from an angler's viewpoint. There are occasional fish exceeding 30 inches but for now, the best news related to pike is that they're not overly abundant. Less competition for Walleyes and the potential for perch to come back to a healthier level may be realized.  <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass have always been present in reasonably good numbers in Cedar Lake which is the case in several other Area lakes similar in size and type. Individual size however is generally on the smaller side with the majority of bass sampled measuring less than 15 inches. Near-shore habitat for bass and panfish is good so the lake is expected to sustain healthy numbers for now and into the future. <br> \n <br> \nWhile Bluegills and crappies were not targeted with the gear used in this survey, past trap net surveys indicate healthy populations of both species especially Bluegill. In addition, crappies seem to be readily caught in gill nets used in Cedar Lake dating back to the 1990s. Over the years, we have seen higher numbers caught recently than in the past. The average size is a little under 8 inches but maximum length is always around 11 inches. As far as Bluegills go, Cedar Lake has plenty exceeding 8 inches and individual growth rates are good. There is the potential for Cedar to develop into a trophy Bluegill fishery and for this reason, a special, 5-fish bag limit is in place to enhance the lake's ability to reach this goal. Anglers must abide by the regulation and are encouraged to release Bluegills over 9 inches. Doing so can greatly increase the chances of Cedar Lake becoming an excellent lake to catch large Bluegills.   <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>     Cedar Lake is a 158 acre basin with a maximum depth of 28 feet.  The lake is characterized by a low level of shoreline development and excellent water quality.  Summer water clarity regularly exceeds 17 feet and nutrient levels are low when compared to other lakes in central Minnesota.  Fishing is the primary recreational activity on the lake.  Cedar is managed as a bass-panfish lake but is stocked with Walleyes on regular basis. <br> \n     Largemouth Bass are abundant in Cedar Lake though small fish dominate the population.  Bass provide fast action for anglers but few of memorable size are likely to be encountered.  Spring trap nets have shown a noticeable improvement in Bluegill size structure.  Bluegill averaged over 7 inches long in the 2015 trap nets with about 20% surpassing 8 inches and a fair number over 9 inches.  Sunfish take 5-8 years to reach \"keeper\" size so excessive harvest of these fish could quickly reduce panfish quality in a lake of this size.  Black Crappie abundance has also shown a recent improvement based on 2015 sampling.   Most of the crappies observed were in the 8-10 inch range but a few larger fish were present. <br> \n     Northern Pike appeared in moderate numbers during 2015 netting with a majority of the fish under 20 inches long, however a pike just under 38 inches was captured.  Cedar Lake's pike population has fluctuated widely over the years but the present level of abundance is within management goals.  A higher population is not desired due heavy predation by pike on stocked Walleye.  Despite stocking Walleye fingerlings every odd numbered year the 2015 gill nets sampled only 7 Walleye in 6 nets.  This catch rate is below management goals though it may improve if pike abundance remains at lower levels.  Walleye caught in 2015 gill nets ranged in size from 12 to 23 inches.  Yellow Perch have historically been found in low numbers and only 2 perch were caught in the 2015 gill nets. <br> \n Rough fish such as White Sucker, Bowfin (Dogfish), Common Carp, Brown Bullhead and Yellow Bullhead reside in Cedar Lake but in low to moderate numbers.  Also residing in the lake are several pollution intolerant species including the Least Darter, a species of Special Concern.  The presence of these intolerant species indicates that the lake continues to provide desirable water quality and habitat capable of supporting such sensitive species.  Proper land use practices in the watershed and along the shoreline are encouraged to maintain the lake's water quality.  Minimizing vegetation removal and other habitat disruption will help ensure Cedar Lake continues to provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Spring Trap netting was performed May 24-26 and June 7-9 to provide pre-regulation data on the Bluegill size structure.   A bag limit of 5 sunfish was implemented on March 1, 2021 as Cedar Lake was selected for participation in the statewide Quality Sunfish Initiative.  The objective of the lowered bag limit is to reduce sunfish harvest and allow for more fish to attain larger sizes (8-10 inches).   Data collected during this survey is considered pre-regulation data due to the short time period since the inception of the reduced bag limit.  Spring trap netting is the preferred method for evaluating panfish populations and has been conducted on the lake three previous times since 2003.  Several future evaluations relating to the 5 sunfish bag limit are planned over the 10 year evaluation period and will incorporate spring trap netting to provide proper comparisons. <br> \n <br> \nSpring trap netting in 2021 captured 280 Bluegill.  This sample size was typical for Bluegill in Cedar Lake as previous spring sample sizes have ranged from 208-384 fish.  Bluegill in 2021 ranged from 2.9 - 10.24 inches and mean length was 6.89 inches.  Many of the Bluegill were of sizes desired by anglers, as fish over 7 inches comprised 58% of the catch and fish greater than 8 inches made up 18% of the sample.   Eight fish over 9 inches were measured (2.9% of sample).  Bluegill 10 inches or greater had not been observed prior to 2021.  Bluegill size structure goals developed for the Quality Sunfish Initiative aim for at least 50% of the sample to exceed 7 inches, 20% to exceed 8 inches, 5% over 9 inches and the persistent presence of fish 10 inches or longer.  Whether voluntary or required due to the reduced bag limit, release of larger sunfish, especially fish over 9 inches will be important if the lake is to realize its potential in reaching management goals.  Additional criteria that may be used to measure success of the reduced sunfish bag limit include: mean size, catch rate of fish over 8 inches, and mean length of the top 10% of fish.  When combining the four pre-regulation spring trap net surveys mean size is 6.7 inches, mean catch rate of fish over 8 inches is 1.8/net, and mean length of the top 10% is 8.39 inches. Bluegill grow well in Cedar Lake, reaching 6.9 inches in length by Age 5. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie spring trap net catches can vary considerably due to sampling conditions, and the Cedar Lake catches have demonstrated this variability.  Spring trap net catches crappies in Cedar Lake have ranged from 0 in 2003 to 85 in 2021.  The comparatively large sample of 85 fish in 2021 ranged in length from 6.5 to 13.2 inches, mean length was 9.35 inches with 33% of the sample 10 inches or longer.  A nice proportion of the crappies currently in Cedar Lake are in the 9-10.5 inch range which should be attractive to anglers.  The crappie bag limit remains at 10 fish.   <br> \n <br> \nSpring trap netting captured 132 Hybrid Sunfish and 70 Pumpkinseed.  Quality size was evident in the measured samples of both species as 62% of the Hybrid Sunfish exceeded 7 inches and 33% were over 8 inches.  Maximum length of Hybrids was 8.7 inches while maximum length of Pumpkinseeds was 8.8 inches.  Thirty percent of Pumpkinseeds were 7 inches or longer and 7% exceeded 8 inches.   <br> \n</p>",

Panfish, bluegill in particular, provide an important fishery in the area.  Six lake survey trapnets were set and lifted twice for a total of 12 net lifts.  The water temperature was 63 degrees.  Air temperatures had been cold the previous three or four days which slowed the warming of the water.    <br> \n      The 2009 assessment captured 332 bluegill between 2.9 and 8.9 inches in length for a catch rate of 27.7 bluegill per trapnet.  Mean length for the sample was 6.9 inches with a modal length of 6.5 - 7 inches.  Bluegill exceeding 7 inches in length accounted for 45% (n=150) of the catch, but only 2% (n=8) of the fish were more than 8 inches in length.  The 2009 catch rate and percent of bluegill exceeding 7 inches met the lake management plan goals of a spring bluegill catch with at least 25 fish per lift and at least 15% of the bluegill over 7 inches in length.  Ages 2 thru 9 were represented in the 2009 sample.  The majority of fish appeared to be from the 2003 year class.  Age groups 2 and 6 thru 9 exhibited fast growth while the bluegill between 3 and 5 years of age showed normal growth. <br> \n      The 2003 panfish assessment also had 12 net lifts.  A total of 384 bluegill were captured for a catch rate of 32/set.  The fish ranged in length from 2.8 to 8.7 inches with a mean length of 5.9 inches.  Modal length for the sample was 6 - 6.5 inches.  Only 14% (n=52) of the fish were more than 7 inches in length with 2% (n=8) exceeding 8 inches.   A summer population assessment in August of 2003 captured 519 bluegill in 9 trapnets.  Summer trapnets tend to sample fewer of the large bluegill that may be present in the population.  Bluegill measured from 3.4 to 8.1 inches in the summer trapnet catch, but only 4% of the fish were over 7 inches in length.  Modal lengths for the sample were 4.5 - 5 inches and 5 - 5.5 inches. <br> \n      Black crappie were another target species in the 2009 panfish assessment, but only 4 crappie were captured.  The fish ranged from 5.7 to 10.7 inches in length with two of the fish over 9.5 inches in length.  Two of the crappie came from the 2007 year class and two from the 2005 year class.  The 2009 summer survey, which used only gillnets, sampled only 4 crappie.  The catch rate was 0.7/gillnet which was below the 25% quartile of 1/gillnet for lake class 29.   One of the crappie was over 11 inches in length, but the other three were between 6 and 7 inches in length.  The 2003 panfish assessment did not sample any black crappies and only 3 were caught in the 2003 summer assessment.   Black crappie catches have historically been low for all gear types since 1991.  Ages 2 and 4 were represented in the 2009 panfish assessment with both age groups showing fast growth. <br> \n       Two small bass between 6 and 8 inches were also captured in the 2009 spring assessment along with a 12-inch and 18-inch northern pike.   Three other panfish species netted during the assessment were hybrid sunfish, green sunfish, and pumpkinseed.   Some of the other fish species captured were bowfin, brown bullhead, white sucker, and yellow bullhead.   <br> \n       Spring assessments appear to be an effective method to monitor the bluegill population in Cedar Lake and will continue to be used as a means of assessing bluegill quality. <br> \n       An area mean back-calculated length table was used to compare the growth rates of the black crappie and bluegill.</p>",
