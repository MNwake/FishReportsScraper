                "narrative": "<p>South Twin Lake has a fishery that is typical of other ecologically similar lakes in Minnesota.  Largemouth bass, panfish, and northern pike are best suited for this 139 acre lake.  Northern pike comprised the largest portion of the total fish catch by weight while bluegills were most abundant.Pike catches were relatively high compared to other class 28 lakes at 7.2 per net but within the historical range for this lake.  These fish averaged 3.1 pounds and 24.2 inches.  Some northern pike over 30 inches were found.  Pike from the 2000 year class dominated the catch although some as old as nine years were caught.Bluegill catches have remained quite consistent since the first net survey in 1976.  Growth rates are slower than normal and bluegills over eight inches long are rare.Black crappie and largemouth bass catches were slightly higher than historical averages for South Twin Lake and were within the normal ranges when compared to other class 28 lakes.  Crappies sampled in test nets were young and small with the majority of those caught being two years old.  Largemouth bass were generally older and larger with an average length of 13.1 inches.Although South Twin is not heavily developed, its small (139 acres) size makes it vulnerable to development related pressures.  Water quality is relatively good at present and shoreline owners are encouraged to use best land management practices when doing work in the lake's watershed.  While there is not currently a public boat access, overfishing is still possible in this small lake and anglers are encouraged to release medium to large fish and harvest smaller ones to maintain balance and sustain the fishery.</p>",
