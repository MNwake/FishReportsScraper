                "narrative": "<p>Amber Lake is located within the city of Fairmont.  Nineteen species of fish and turtles were sampled during the summer assessment of 1997.  Amber Lake is managed primarily for walleye and secondarily for yellow perch and bluegill.The walleye population appeared to be doing well in 1997.  Survey nets indicated walleye numbers were about average for lakes similar to Amber.  Walleye lengths ranged from 9.4 to 18.4 inches and averaged 13.3 inches.Yellow perch populations often experience large fluctuations from one assessment to the next.  Spring spawning conditions (water levels and climatic conditions) play an important role in determining the success of perch reproduction.  Currently, yellow perch are at a low point in these fluctuations.The bluegill population has never been very large in Amber Lake.  Although survey nets in 1997 indicated there were more bluegill than in 1993, the population is still fairly low.  Bluegill seek to spawn near abundant vegetation.  Young bluegill require vegetation because it provides food, and cover from predators.  Until vegetation growth improves, the bluegill population will probably remain low.Although crappie are not specifically managed for in Amber Lake, they looked good in 1997.   When comparing black crappie and white crappie numbers to lakes similar to Amber, they were higher than 75% of the lakes.  Black crappie ranged in length from 3.3 to 9.0 inches and averaged 7.1 inches.  White crappie ranged from 6.7 to 9.9 inches and averaged 8.5 inches.  Crappie fishing should be pretty good in 1998 and 1999.Channel catfish is another species not specifically managed for in Amber Lake but are doing well.  Twenty-three channel catfish were sampled during the summer of 1997.  Channel catfish ranged from 12.7 to 23.5 inches.  Although no trophy channel catfish were observed, catfish should provide a bonus species while anglers seek other species. To promote and maintain healthy fish populations, pollution needs to be controlled.  Fish habitat is directly affected by water quality.  Nutrients, sediments and other waste can drastically alter the chemical and physical characteristics of a lake.  It is important to maintain, if not improve, the water quality of Amber Lake through watershed management.  People sometimes associate water quality problems in a lake with land use practices in the watershed but lakeshore property owners also contribute to water quality problems.  For example, putting in sand beaches, removing trees and aquatic vegetation, fertilizing lawns, and mowing lawns down to the lakeshore can also be harmful.  Improved land use practices by everyone will help insure this fishery can be enjoyed by future generations.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Amber Lake is a 180 acre lake with a max depth of 19 feet and 108 acres of littoral zone (15 feet or less).  Amber Lake is part of the \"Fairmont Chain of Lakes\" and is within the city limits of Fairmont.  The Fairmont Chain of Lakes (from headwaters to mouth) is comprised of Amber Lake, Hall Lake, Budd Lake, Sisseton Lake, and George Lake which are natural impoundments of Center Creek in the Blue Earth River Watershed.  A dam built on George Lake 1939 increased water storage and depth of each lake.  Dredging in the 1970's to early 1990's also increased the depth of Budd and Hall Lakes.  Amber Lake is the first lake and one of the deepest of the lakes with a watershed-to-lake ratio of 59 to 1 indicating a large influence of the watershed effects in the lake.  The watershed has many factors that contribute to degraded conditions within Amber Lake.  Agriculture and municipal sources of pollution are both present within the watershed.  Many miles of agricultural tile move nutrient rich water to Amber Lake without wetland treatment and the city of Fairmont operates a storm water runoff system that empties roadway drainage into the lakes.  These are the same lakes that the city of Fairmont draws drinking water (Budd Lake directly downstream), so it is imperative to reduce negative influences of water impairments to improve the water quality in the Fairmont Chain of Lakes.   <br> \n <br> \nAmber Lake is managed primarily for Walleye and Muskellunge while Yellow Perch, Black Crappie and Bluegill are managed secondarily.  Fish population assessments have been conducted every 4 to 7 years since 1982 with an initial assessment conducted in 1971.  A recent fish population assessment was conducted during the week of August 22, 2022 to analyze the current species composition in Hall Lake and to determine changes in the fish community.  Fish community changes over time tell us a lot about the health of an aquatic environment. <br> \n <br> \nDuring the fish assessment, water quality in Amber Lake was poor due to a heavy algae bloom. The algae bloom contained blue-green algae and surface water pH (9.25) was higher than Western Corn Belt Plain lakes (8.3-9.0).  When pH is high, it is a result of a chemical process of blue-green algae photosynthesis in the upper part of the water column and causes alkaline water that can affect fish gills.  This can have detrimental consequences to the fish community by forcing them to deeper depths.  However, the deeper water, during an algae bloom, is often characterized by low dissolved oxygen. At the time of the survey dissolved oxygen was below 5.0 ppm (considered stressful to fish) as depths increased to greater than 12 feet.  The combination of higher pH at the surface and lower dissolved oxygen at greater depths puts fish into a \"squeeze\" by forcing them to the middle of the water column. As the bloom continues to progress, this squeeze can be very stressful and/or result in water that is inadequate to sustain life if the bloom occurs over a long period of time.  The final result can trigger a summerkill of fish, particularly those sensitive to low dissolved oxygen such as Walleye, Crappies, Yellow Perch, Muskellunge, and Bluegill.  Fortunately, Amber Lake did not experience a summerkill and water quality improved shortly after the algae bloom.         <br> \n <br> \nSince Walleye are the primary species of management, they are most important to track in Amber Lake.  Since 1993, Walleye have been at or below the long-term gill net catch rate average of 3 per gillnet.  In 2022, the catch rate was 2.5 per gillnet while the trap net catch rate was 1.9 per trap net.  The gill net and trap net catch rates both increased from 2018, when the gill net catch was 0.5 per net and the trap net catch was 1 per net.  Lower Mississippi Strain (LMS, Lake Sarah egg take) Walleye fry were stocked in Amber Lake in 2019, 2021, and 2022.  Additionally, 2,214 fingerling Walleye (Upper Mississippi River Strain) were stocked in 2019.  Walleye in the gill net and trap net sample ranged in length from 6.6 to 26.3 inches with 4 different ages (Ages 1-4).  Three of the 4 year age groups present were from years where LMS Walleye fry were stocked, indicating that LMS Walleye are establishing well each year.  Average size of Walleye in the sample was good with more than 50% of the fish over 15 inches.  Health of each fish appeared good too.  Therefore, the Walleye population appears to be doing well and potentially increasing in abundance due to a change in stocking strategy utilizing LMS Walleye fry.  Angling for Walleye has been good in Amber Lake since 2020 and should continue with most fish at a harvestable size.      <br> \n <br> \nMuskellunge have been managed in Amber Lake and the entire Fairmont Chain of Lakes since 2016.  Muskie fingerling have been stocked in even years with 314 fingerling in each year, except 2020 due to Covid related shutdown of spring egg take operations.  To make up for the missed stocking in 2020, the Fairmont Chain of Lakes was stocked in 2021.  No Muskies were sampled during netting in Amber Lake in 2022, but reports from anglers indicate that the original stocking in 2016 was successful and Muskies near 40 inches have been reported.  One 37 inch Muskie was sampled in a trap net on Hall Lake during the summer of 2022.  A large frame trap net survey will be conducted on the Fairmont Chain of Lakes in 2024 with recapture surveys in 2025 and 2026 (if necessary).  Continued Muskie management will help to add a consistent top predator to Amber Lake and the Fairmont Chain that historically was missing within the Chain of Lakes.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch relative abundance has been less than the long-term gill net catch rate of 15.9 since 1982 except 2011 when the catch rate was 39.0 per gill net.  In 2022 the catch rate was 2.5 per gill net.  Yellow Perch in the sample ranged in length from 8 to just under 10 inches.  Yellow Perch have not been stocked into Amber Lake.  They are self-sustaining, but potentially limited by habitat degradation due to low aquatic plant and woody debris abundance.  Additionally recently illegally introduced Yellow Bass in 2013 have now taken hold in Amber Lake and could be occupying a similar niche and potentially exclude Yellow Perch to some degree.  Continued monitoring is necessary and potential stocking may be warranted in the future.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie have exhibited a different trend, compared to Yellow Perch, since 1987.  Generally, the relative abundance of Black Crappie has remained above or near the long-term gill net average of 6.7 per net.  Since 1987, 5 out of 7 fish assessments have had Black Crappie relative abundance near or exceeding the long-term average of just under 19 per trap net.  More impressive is an increase in size structure of Black Crappie since 1997.  Currently, 100% of the fish in the sample were over 7.9 inches.  Black Crappie ranged in length from just under 8 to nearly 12.5 inches with an average length of 9.4 inches in the trap net sample.  Health of Black Crappie was above average with many plump fish.  Overall, Black Crappie have been resilient in the Fairmont Chain of Lakes.  Black Crappie are able to thrive in degraded aquatic systems and can spawn without aquatic vegetation or woody debris.  Angling for Black Crappie should remain good in the Fairmont Chain of Lakes particularly if Yellow Bass don't become a nuisance while fishing for crappie.   <br> \n <br> \nA bright spot in the Amber Lake fish community is Bluegill abundance.  Bluegill were caught in trap nets at a rate of 13.9 per net, the greatest catch rate ever observed in Amber Lake.  Bluegill ranged from nearly 4 inches to just over 9 inches with a mean length in the 7 to 8 inch range.  Overall body condition of each fish was excellent indicating ample food exists.  All signs point to excellent angling for Bluegill which will provide a unique opportunity in Amber Lake over the next several years. With an average length approaching 8 inches, many harvestable Bluegill should be available. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled in Amber Lake were Bigmouth Buffalo, Black Bullhead, Channel Catfish, Common Carp, Freshwater Drum, Largemouth Bass, Quillback Carpsucker, White Crappie, White Sucker, Yellow Bass, and Yellow Bullhead.  These species, except Yellow Bass, are typical residents of degraded aquatic lakes.  Channel Catfish and Freshwater Drum have been the most abundant of the species listed since the early 1990's.  Increases in Channel Catfish and Freshwater Drum relative abundance can lead to competition with Walleye, Yellow Perch, and even Black Crappie.  However, it appears that Yellow Perch are the most affected.  Interestingly, Common Carp relative abundance has generally declined in Amber Lake since 2001.  However, there was a slight increase in numbers in 2022 with 6 per gill net and 18.7 per trap net.  This slight increase in catch rate during the survey follows 2 commercial seine hauls done towards the beginning of March 2022, when over 1200 pounds per acre of Bigmouth Buffalo and Common Carp were removed.  There may be an ability to continue to suppress the Common Carp population through exclusion of backwater spawning habitat and continued predator management including Muskie stocking.  However, in 2012, the Fairmont Chain of Lakes was confirmed to have Yellow Bass.  Yellow Bass were most likely introduced through illegal stocking.  Since 2012, they have expanded in relative abundance in Hall, Budd, Sisseton, and George Lakes.  During 2022, Yellow Bass were sampled for the first time in Amber Lake with 12 per gill net (0 per trap net).  Several high water events in 2018 and 2019 could have led to an introduction of Yellow Bass into Amber Lake, with those fish not showing up in the summer 2018 netting. <br> \n <br> \nOverall, it appears that Amber Lake is maintaining an adequate abundance of Walleye, potentially increasing.  Yellow Perch, however, appear to be decreasing and stocking may be necessary to sustain the population.  Black Crappie and Bluegill are doing much better in Amber Lake and both could produce a decent fishery over the next several years.  Habitat improvement projects could positively influence the fishery.  There are options to allow trees that fall into the lake to stay and provide woody habitat for refuge or spawning.  Get out and enjoy Amber Lake, a great opportunity awaits! <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Amber Lake is a 180 acre lake of which 108 are less than 15 feet (littoral zone).  Amber Lake is part of the\" Fairmont Chain of Lakes\" and is within the city limits of Fairmont.  The Fairmont Chain of Lakes (from headwaters to mouth) is comprised of Amber Lake, Hall Lake, Budd Lake, Sisseton Lake, and George Lake which are all natural impoundments of Center Creek in the Blue Earth River Watershed.  Amber Lake is the first lake and one of the deepest of the lakes with a watershed-to-lake ratio of 59 indicating a large influence of the watershed effects in the lake.  The city of Fairmont operates a storm water runoff system that empties into the lakes and the city also draws drinking water from Budd Lake, so it is imperative to reduce negative influences of water impairments in the watershed to improve the water quality in the Fairmont Chain of Lakes.   Martin County Soil and Water Conservation District has taken the lead on this and has implemented some projects that help reduce the effects of water quality impairments on the lake, but more can be done to virtually eliminate all influences through best management practices in the watershed.  Fish community changes over time tell us a lot about the health of an aquatic environment and its water quality.  Amber Lake is a class 24 lake and is managed primarily for walleye while crappie, yellow perch and channel catfish are managed secondarily.  Fish population assessments have been conducted every 4 to 6 years since 1982 with an initial assessment conducted in 1971.  A recent fish population assessment was conducted during the week of August 29, 2011 to analyze the current management of species in Hall Lake and to determine changes in the fish community over time.  <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nThe walleye catch rate in Amber Lake was 3.0 fish per gill net, within the normal range of 1.2 to 6.3 fish per gill net.  Historically, the long term gill net catch rate was 3.4 fish per gill net with the catch exceeding that only 3 times (1971=12.8, 1982=3.5, 1987=5.0) in the past 8 fish population assessments.  The 2011 trap net catch rate was 1.4 fish per trap net, exceeding the normal range of 0.3 to 1.2 per trap net.  Historically, the trap net catch rate average of 0.9 fish per net has been exceeded 4 times (1987=1.1, 1993=1.6, 1997=2.1, and 2011=1.4) in the past 8 fish population assessments.  Trap net catch rates are not good indicators of walleye abundance, therefore gill net catch rates are used to assess the population.  The sizes of walleye were dominated by smaller sized fish (less than 15 inches).  The average length of walleye in the gill net sample was 12.5 inches with a range in length of 9.7 to 16.1 inches.  The walleye sampled were likely from a 2008 fingerling stocking.  The average length of age-3 fish was 12.2 inches, which is fair to poor growth for a walleye population in a southern Minnesota lake.  The overall condition of the walleye in the sample was fair to poor for walleye in August in a southern Minnesota lake.  Several factors are most likely responsible for the low walleye catch rate, size structure, and condition.  First, there are many species of fish in the Fairmont Chain of Lakes; in 2011 there were 14 species of fish caught in the gill nets and trap nets.  Many species can lead to competition for resources, particularly food.  Competition with freshwater drum and black crappie is common for walleye, especially the competition between walleye and black crappie.  Another factor is a possible decrease in the food supply of walleye through water quality changes.  The Fairmont Chain of Lakes has been treated in the past with copper sulfate to decrease algae blooms, the negative effect of copper sulfate that is often overlooked is an alteration of the food web due to invertebrate reduction leading to forage fish reductions.  This alteration can last for a long period of time due to copper as a heavy metal that accumulates in the sediment of the lake and is not easily removed.  The current fish population assessment does show the greatest abundance of walleye since 1987 so the population may be making a comeback.  Fishing success for walleye should increase in the next 2 to 3 years due to this increase and due to stocking of walleye fingerling in 2011 and 2012.    <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nThe yellow perch catch rate was 39.0 fish per gill net and 1.8 fish per trap net, both exceeding the normal ranges for gill nets (2.0 to 27.9 per gill net) and trap nets (0.3 to 1.7 per trap net).  The average length of yellow perch in the gill nets and trap nets was 7.4 inches with a range in length from 4.9 to 8.9 inches.  The length of yellow perch caught in the sample indicating a population that is dominated by fish in the 5 to 8 inch range.  Overall, it appears that the yellow perch population is on the rise, as the population is dominated by younger and smaller individuals, and the population size structure will continue to improve.  The opportunity to catch 8 to 10 inch yellow perch in Amber Lake should be good, if not excellent, in the next 2 to 3 years.    <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nTwo species of crappie (white and black) have been caught in Amber Lake since 1971.  The historical white crappie catch rate average is 1.0 per gill net and 3.5 per trap net and the historical black crappie catch rate is 7.3 fish per gill net and 20.4 per trap net.  In 2011, no white crappies were caught in gill nets or trap nets.  However, the 2011 black crappie catch rates were 15.0 fish per gill net and 35.1 fish per trap net exceeding the long-term average.  The normal catch rate ranges for black crappie are 2.5 to 16.5 fish per gill net and 1.8 to 21.2 fish per trap net.  The 2011 gill net catch rate is within the normal range and the trap net catch rate exceeds the normal range.  The size structure of the black crappie in the sample was above average indicating a population of black crappie dominated by fish in the 8 to 10 inch length group.  The average length of black crappie in the gill net and trap net samples was 8.4 inches with a range of 5.8 to 10.0 inches indicating an abundance of 2 or 3 consecutive year classes.  The overall condition of the black crappie in the sample was average for an August sample and indicated a population that is foraging successfully.  Amber Lake is poised to be a black crappie hotspot in the next 2 to 3 years as almost 30% of all fish caught in the 2011 fish population assessment were black crappie.       <br> \n  <br> \n <br> \nChannel catfish are also managed in Amber Lake.  The gill net catch rate in 2011 was 3.3 fish per net, with a long-term average of 1.2 indicating an adequate population of channel catfish reside in Amber Lake.  The size structure of the channel catfish in the sample was balanced; the average length of channel catfish in the gill net and trap net sample was 12.7 and 12.9 inches respectively with a range in length from 7.5 to 21.1 inches.  The overall condition of the channel catfish in the sample was low for August, indicating some stress with respect to foraging ability.  Overall, it appears that the channel catfish population is maintaining itself at a low abundance.  Channel catfish fishing in Amber Lake will continue to be hit-or-miss with several caught here-and-there given the low abundance.   <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nOther non-managed species caught in the gill nets and trap nets were bigmouth buffalo, black bullhead, bluegill, common carp, freshwater drum, largemouth bass, northern pike, quillback carpsucker, white sucker, and yellow bullhead.  Amber Lake is a unique lake in southern Minnesota because of its species diversity and general characteristics of deeper than usual water for the area.  In addition to fishing, Amber Lake is a destination for recreational watercraft users.  Regardless, in order to preserve the unique features of Amber Lake all watercraft entering and exiting Amber Lake should remove aquatic vegetation and drain all water to reduce the chance of spreading harmful invasive species. <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nPrepared by Nate Hodgins <br> \n</p>",

Approximately 70% of the walleye we sampled in 1993 were less than 14 inches.  The remainder of the walleye ranged from 14-23 inches.  Channel catfish fishing in Amber Lake should be very good.  18 channel catfish were sampled in Amber Lake.  Channel catfish lengths ranged from 11 to 32 inches.  Two channel catfish weighed in at over 15 lbs (15.1 and 17.3 lbs).Several crappie were sampled in Amber Lake.  The majority of the fish were in 7 to 9.5 inch range.  Bluegill sampled in the lake were up to 9.5 inches and averaged almost 1/2 lb.  </p>",

Age class 1, 3, and 8 were the dominant year classes caught, which correspond with Fisheries stocking records.  Net catches indicate 7 times more black crappie than the state median and 2.4 more than the local median with lbs per trap being 3.3 and 1.3 times greater respectively.  Four age 2 LMB, averaging .75 lbs, were caught in trapnets during the survey.  Net catch indices for yellow perch, northern pike, and channel catfish were below state and local medians.  Net catch indices for carp and black bullhead were singificantly greater then both state and local medians.  Gillnet catch indices for white sucker were less than state medians and about equal to local medians.  Trapnet catch indices for bluegill were about half the state medians and twice the local medians.  During the 1982 survey no black crappie were captured and net catch indices for white crappie were significantly greater than state and local medians.  During the 1987 assessment indices for white crappie were about equal to state and local medians while indices for black crappie were greater than both medians.</p>",

The lake is part of a \"chain\" of lakes located within the city limits of Fairmont in Martin County.  Amber is presently managed for walleye primarily, while black crappie, yellow perch and channel catfish are managed secondarily.  The lake is stocked every other year with walleye fingerlings and is due to be stocked again in 2006.Based on our netting results, the walleye population is low when compared to other lakes similar to Amber.  The only fish sampled during the assessment were age 1 which conicides with a fingerling stocking that was done in 2004.  Lengths of walleye sampled in trap nets ranged from 7.3 to 7.5 inches and averaged 7.4 inches.  This doesn't mean that larger walleye are not present in the lake, it just means we didn't sample any in our nets during the 2005 assessment.The black crappie population looks very good when compared to similar lakes.  Lengths of black crappie sampled in trap nets ranged from 7.2 to 8.9 inces and averaged 8.2 inches.  A majority of the fish were in the 8.5 to 9.0 inch range.  The average weight of black crappie was about 1/3 of a pound.The white crappie population is similar to other lakes like Amber.  A white crappie is a little narrower and has vertical banding on their side when compared to a black crappie.  Lengths of white crappie sampled in our nets ranged from 5.3 to 9.9 inches and averaged 8.1 inches.  They also had an average weight of just under 1/3 of a pound.The bluegill population is low when compared to other lakes like Amber.  You might be better off fishing on Sisseton or George if it's bluegill you're after.  Lengths of bluegill sampled in Amber ranged from 6.5 to 8.1 inches and averaged 7.4 inches.Yellow perch numbers were low according to our assessment.  Lengths of yellow perch sampled ranged from 5.7 to 7.4 inches and averaged 6.8 inches.The black bullhead population is similar to other lakes like Amber.  Lengths ranged from 7.2 to 8.9 inches and averaged 8.2 inches.Other fish sampled in our nets included bigmouth buffalo, carp, freshwater drum, quillback, and white sucker.To promote and maintain healthy fish populations, pollution and other inputs need to be controlled.  Fish habitats are directly affected by water quality.  Nutrient, sediment and other waste inputs can drastically alter the biological, chemical, and physical components of a lake.  It is paramount to maintain if not improve the current water quality of Amber Lake through watershed management to preserve this fishery for future generations to enjoy.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>An assessment of lakeshore habitat on Amber Lake was conducted on 7/7/2017.  The assessment consisted of 34 survey sites evenly spaced 100 meters around the lake.  The average lake wide habitat score was 71.9(+/- 3.6), indicating overall lakeshore habitat quality was moderate (66-84).  Sites with moderate habitat quality have a high percentage of unaltered habitat but at least one zone has lower habitat quality than a high scoring site.  Undeveloped sites may score moderate if they naturally lack a habitat component.  Developed sites that retain a high percentage of natural habitat areas may score in this range.  Approximately 70 percent of the sites were developed with a mean score of 64.9(+/- 4.1), while undeveloped sites had a mean score of 88.7(+/- 4.4).  This habitat survey was designed to provide a means to quantify and compare lakeshore habitat between lakes.  The Amber Lake shoreline habitat score is lower than the statewide score average of 73.6.  If you have concerns or questions on how a lakeshore might score better or questions how to manage for a better shoreline, please call the Windom Area Office.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Amber Lake is a 180 acre lake within the city of Fairmont in Martin County.  Amber Lake is part of the \"Fairmont Chain of Lakes\".  The Fairmont Chain of Lakes (from headwaters to mouth) is comprised of Amber Lake, Hall Lake, Budd Lake, Sisseton Lake, and George Lake which are all natural impoundments of Center Creek in the Blue Earth River Watershed.  Amber Lake is the deepest of the lakes with a large watershed of nearly 12,000 acres.  The watershed has many factors that contribute to degraded conditions within Amber Lake.  Agriculture and municipal sources of pollution are both present within the watershed.  Many miles of agricultural tile move nutrient rich water to Amber Lake without wetland treatment and the city of Fairmont operates a storm water runoff system that empties into the Chain of Lakes.  These are the same lakes that the city of Fairmont draws drinking water (Budd Lake directly downstream), so it is imperative to reduce negative influences of water impairments to improve the water quality in the Fairmont Chain of Lakes.   Martin County Soil and Water Conservation District has taken the lead on creating a water plan for Martin County that includes the Fairmont Chain of Lakes and has implemented some projects that help reduce the effects of water quality impairments on the lake.  One project that is yet to be done is within the Dutch Creek watershed that feeds Hall Lake just downstream.  This project will restore a floodplain wetland that should have water quality benefits to Hall Lake and the other 3 lakes.  Amber Lake will still require upstream improvements.   <br> \n <br> \nAmber Lake is managed primarily for Walleye and Muskellunge while Black Crappie and Yellow Perch are managed secondarily.  Fish population assessments have been conducted every 4 to 7 years since 1982 with an initial assessment conducted in 1971.  A recent fish standard survey was conducted during the week of August 21, 2018 to analyze the current species composition in Amber Lake and to look for changes in the fish community.  Fish community changes over time tell us a lot about the health of an aquatic environment. <br> \n <br> \nSince Walleye are the primary species of management, they are most important to track in Amber Lake.  Since 1993, Walleye have been at or below the long-term gill net catch rate average of 3 per gillnet.  In 2018, the catch rate was less than 1 per gillnet.   The trap net catch rate was 1 per trap net.  While those catch rates were low, the 10 Walleye in the sample were between 10 and 16 inches with balanced size distribution.  Additionally, Walleye yearlings were stocked into Amber Lake in the fall which should boost the population.  Amber Lake is stocked once every other year with additional Walleye added when available.  Since the last lake survey in 2011, over 6,500 fingerling, yearling, or adult Walleye have been added to Amber Lake.  That is just shy of 1,000 Walleye per year.  This number is creating a low density Walleye fishery with a decent percentage of fish above harvestable size.   <br> \n <br> \nMuskellunge have been managed in Amber Lake and the entire Fairmont Chain of Lakes since 2016.  Muskie fingerling have been stocked in even years (2016 and 2018) with 314 fingerling in each year.  No Muskies were sampled in netting, but reports from anglers indicate that the original stocking in 2016 was successful and Muskies near 25 inches have been reported.  One mid-20's-inch Muskie was verified by fisheries staff in a photo.  Continued Muskie management will help to add a consistent top predator to Amber Lake and the Fairmont Chain that had been sorely missing within the Chain of Lakes.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch abundance has exhibited a similar trend as Walleye.  The Yellow Perch abundance has been less than the long-term gill net catch rate of 18 since 1982 except 2011 when the catch rate was 39 per gill net.  In 2018 the catch rate was 5.5 per gill net.  The Yellow Perch in the sample ranged in length from 5.5 to 8 inches.  Yellow Perch are not stock but instead are self-sustaining, potentially limited by habitat degradation due to decreased aquatic plant and woody debris abundance.    <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie have exhibited a different trend since 1987.  Generally, the abundance of Black Crappie has increased.  Since 1987, 5 out of 7 surveys have had Black Crappie abundance near or exceeding the long-term average of just under 20 per trap net.  Black Crappie ranged in length from 8 to just over 10 inches with an average length of nearly 9 inches in the trap net sample.  Overall, Black Crappie have done much better in the Fairmont Chain of Lakes over the past 10 years.  Black Crappie are able to thrive in degraded aquatic systems and can spawn without aquatic vegetation or woody debris.   <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled in Amber Lake were Bigmouth Buffalo, Black Bullhead, Bluegill, Channel Catfish, Common Carp, Freshwater Drum, White Crappie, White Sucker, and Yellow Bullhead.  These species, except for Bluegill, are typical residents of degraded aquatic lakes.  Bluegill were stocked from a private source 2 times over the past 7 years (Fairmont Lakes Foundation provided funding for the fish and arranged the stocking).  Channel Catfish and Freshwater Drum have been the most abundant of the species listed since the early 1990's.  Increases in Channel Catfish and Freshwater Drum relative abundance can lead to competition with Walleye, Yellow Perch, and even Black Crappie.  However, it appears that Walleye and Yellow Perch were the most affected.   <br> \n <br> \nInterestingly, Common Carp abundance has decreased in Amber Lake since the 2001 survey.  There may be an ability to continue to suppress the Common Carp population through exclusion of backwater spawning habitat, continued Bluegill presence in the lake, and long-term predator management including Muskies.  However, in 2012, the Fairmont Chain of Lakes was confirmed to have Yellow Bass.  Yellow Bass were most likely introduced through illegal stocking.  Since 2012, they have expanded in relative abundance in Hall, Budd, Sisseton, and George Lakes.  Currently, no Yellow Bass have been sampled in Amber Lake, but it is only a matter of time before they find their way into the lake.  In 2018, several high water events could have led to an introduction of Yellow Bass into the lake, with those fish not showing up in the summer netting.  The impact of Yellow Bass on the Fairmont Chain of Lakes has not been determined yet.  <br> \n <br> \nOverall, it appears that Amber Lake is maintaining adequate to low abundances of Walleye and Yellow Perch.  Black Crappie are doing much better in Amber Lake and could even produce a decent fishery over the next several years.  Habitat improvement projects could boost the fishery.  There should also be a focus on allowing trees that fall into the lake to stay in the lake (may need to be anchored to shore) for fish habitat.  Best management practices for agriculture and city runoff could also improve conditions within Amber Lake.  Currently, Amber Lake is sustaining an average fishery with degraded water quality and insufficient habitat.    <br> \n <br> \nPrepared by Nate Hodgins   <br> \n</p>",

Northern pike taken were 55% age II and 29% age IV, with the balance being I's and V's.  Abundance is above average, growth rate average.  Bluegill numbers were low, so 400 adults were stocked following the survey.  Natural reproduction check in the fall indicated a successful hatch.  White crappie abundance is 3 times the state average with good growth rate and good average size.  All were in age classes III and IV.  Yellow perch abundance is about 6 times the state average, with growth rate also well above average.  Black bullhead abundance was even higher than the yellow perch.  Good average size (2.1/lb.) should create both commercial and angling interest.  There is a high population of large, old suckers.  The non-vulnerability of largemouth bass and channel catfish to netting makes their respective populations more difficult to determine.</p>",

The seine hauls captured 7 species of fish, including Johnny Darter (N=1), Bigmouth Buffalo (N=2), Fathead Minnow (N=11), Freshwater Drum (N=1), Orangespotted Sunfish (N=1), Bluegill (N=3), and Largemouth Bass (N=1).  Electrofishing captured 10 species of fish including Johnny Darter (N=5), Bluegill (N=9), Common Carp (N=7), Fathead Minnow (N=8), Green Sunfish (N=2), Largemouth Bass (N=7), Orangespotted Sunfish (N=3), White Sucker (N=1), Yellow Bullhead (N=3), and Yellow Perch (N=1). Natural Reproduction exists for some of the species in Amber Lake, as young-of-the-year Freshwater Drum, Largemouth Bass, and Orangespotted Sunfish were sampled.  The types of species and their respective abundances in nearshore IBI sampling will be used to determine the overall health of Amber Lake.  The IBI score will provide insight into the quality of habitat and water within the lake and can indicate problems within the watershed that could adversely affect the fish community. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Amber is a 180 acre lake located within the city of Fairmont in Martin County.  This lake has a maximum depth of 19 feet and is connected to Wilmert, Mud, Hall, Budd, Sisseton, and George lakes.  Amber is managed primarily for walleye and secondarily for yellow perch, channel catfish, and black crappie.  Amber Lake, like many of the other Fairmont lakes,  has had extensive shoreline development.  Aquatic vegetation which is important for natural reproduction for some species and is important nursery habitat for almost all species has often been limited.  The current management plan calls for stocking walleye fry and fingerlings.  A resurvey was conducted during the week of August 27, 2001 and utilized four gillnets, nine trapnets, and three standard seine hauls.Overall, walleye numbers were lower in 2001 than in past surveys.  It is likely that the walleye fry stocked in 2000 were eaten by the abundant black crappie.  Because the Fairmont chain of lakes are connected and due to the surplus of walleye fingerlings in 2001, walleye fingerlings (447 lbs) were stocked into Budd and Hall Lake.  Growth is typically slow in the Fairmont chain so it will be a few years until these fish are of  \"keeper\" size.More black crappies were sampled in Amber Lake in 2001 than ever before and they were good keeping size.  All of the test netting indicated that good numbers and sizes of black crappie are available to be caught.  Since adult black crappie eat other fish species including other crappie, it is not surprising that zero Age 0 black crappie were captured in three seine hauls.  Yellow perch numbers were lower than usual, which shouldn't be surprising since high catch rates of black crappie sometimes correspond to low catch rates of yellow perch.  Total lengths of yellow perch ranged averaged about 7 inches.  It may be a few years before Amber yellow perch numbers return because of the high numbers of black crappie in the system.Channel catfish were more abundant in 2001 than ever before with most of them Age 4 and about 15 inches long, as was seen in Budd and Hall lakes.  Climatic conditions in 1997 must have been a ideal for natural reproduction because that year class also dominated in Round Lake.  These channel catfish seem to be numerous and can be delicious as table fare.  A great species to target during the dog days of summer when the crappies are not biting.  Carp numbers were way above average as has been true in the entire Fairmont chain of lakes. To promote and maintain healthy fish populations, pollution and other inputs need to be controlled.  Fish habitats are directly affected by water quality.  Nutrient, sediment and other waste inputs can drastically alter the biological, chemical, and physical components of a lake.  It is paramount to maintain if not improve the current water quality of Amber Lake through watershed management to preserve this fishery for future generations to enjoy. Other species captured were black bullhead, freshwater drum, white crappie, bigmouth buffalo, bluegill, golden shiner, quillback, white sucker, yellow bullhead, emerald shiner, and orangespotted sunfish.Prepared by : Ryan Doorenbos     </p>",
