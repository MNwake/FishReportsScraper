                "narrative": "<p>Lottie Lake is a small, relatively shallow basin in a chain of three lakes that connect Lake Brophy toLake Cowdry.  Lottie Lake supports an abundant and diverse aquatic plant community.  Submergentvegetation grows to a depth of 13 feet and is dense throughout the littoral zone.  The entire shorelineis fringed with a wide band of common cattail.  Dense vegetation in shoreline areas likely reduced thecapture efficiency of trapnets.  The fish communities in all three lakes are typical for small, denselyvegetated basins.  Northern pike catches averaged 7.5 fish/gillnet which is within the normal range of mean catch ratesfrom lakes with similar physical and chemical characteristics (4.5 - 11.3 fish/gillnet).  Gillnetcatches averaged 9.0 fish/net in 1992, 6.0 fish/net in 1987, and 4.5 fish/net in 1966.  Mean weight offish captured in 1997 was 2.2 pounds.  Total length ranged from 14.4 to 34.1 inches.  Bluegill catchesaveraged 7.8 fish/trapnet in 1997, compared to 19.2 fish/trapnet in 1992.  Trapnet catches averaged91.0 fish/net in 1987 and 61.6 fish/net in 1966.  Gillnet catches decreased from 20.0 fish/net in 1992to 0.5 fish/net in 1997.  Size structure of the bluegill population has improved.  over one-half of thefish captured were 6 inches in length or greater, however none exceeded 8 inches.  Poor reproductivesuccess during the unusually cool summers of 1992 and 1993 is responsible for the decrease in catchrates and shift in size structure.  Age-4 and age-5 fish were not present in trapnet catches.  Thestatus of the largemouth bass population is unknown.  Electrofishing was not conducted because the boatis to large to navigate the culverts that provide the only access to Lottie Lake.  Prior surveys witha smaller, handmade boat depict a moderate population density with a balanced size structure.One walleye measuring 28.6 inches in total length and weighing 7.6 pounds was captured in a trapnet. Walleye likely move freely through this chain of lakes from Lakes Brophy and Cowdry.  Tullibee, commoncarp, black bullhead, yellow bullhead, pumpkinseed sunfish, and yellow perch were also captured insurvey nets.         </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Lottie is a small, shallow lake with abundant emergent and submergent vegetation.  The fish community found in Lake Lottie is a typical Bass, Bluegill, and Northern Pike assemblage.  Because of the lakes small size there is no public access.  Northern Pike catch per unit effort averaged 9.0 fish/gillnet which is within the normal range of mean catch rates for lake class 36.  The mean weight of fish captured in gillnets was 2.0 pounds.  PSD and RSD-P were calculated at 33.3% and 16.7% respectively.  The growth rate of Northern Pike is similar to other lakes in the area.  Age 3 fish averaged 19.3 inches in total length at the time of annulus formation. Daytime dc electrofishing yielded 15.6 stock-sized Largemouth Bass per hour.  Size distribution of the population is desirable. PSD and RSD-P were measured at 61.5% and 7.7%, respectively.  Growth of Largemouth Bass is poor in Lake Lottie.  Age 5 fish average only 12.5 inches in total length at time of annulus formation.  Largemouth Bass population parameters measured during the 1992 survey are similar to those recorded in 1987.  In both cases the survey crew felt that capture efficiency was poor due to exceptional water clarity.  Bluegill catches in trapnets declined from 91.0 fish/net in 1987 to 19.7 fish/net in 1992.  This decline in CPUE may not verify a reduction in Bluegill abundance.  Gillnet CPUE averaged 20.0 fish/net which is indicative of an abundant population.  The mean weight of fish captured in trapnets was 0.1 pounds.  PSD was 22.9% in 1992.  Gillnets captured Bluegill with a mean weight of 0.2 pounds and a PSD of 85%.  Bluegill growth is poor in Lake Lottie.  Age 5 fish averaged only 6.2 inches in total length at time of capture.  Catch rates for bullhead species averaged 18.5 fish/gillnet, 12.0 fish/gillnet, and 2.0 fish/gillnet for Black Bullhead, Yellow Bullhead, and Brown Bullhead, respectively. Yellow Perch, Walleye, and Pumpkinseed were also captured during the survey.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>North Union, Stony, and Lottie (Taylor) lakes form a chain of lakes between Brohpy and Cowdry Lakes in Douglas County.  Lottie Lake is lower or third lake in the chain.  Lottie Lake discharges to Lake Cowdry.  None of basins have public landings, but anglers can utilize access sites on Cowdry and Brophy Lakes and navigate small watercraft throughout the chain via flowage channels.  Large boats will be restricted by road crossings and undersized road culverts.  The lakes are small and relatively unique in that shoreline development is limited and much of the natural shoreline remains intact.  Water quality and clarity are very good.  Near-shore areas support lush vegetative growth including bulrushes and water lilies.  Habitat attributes constitute ideal environment for northern pike, largemouth bass, and bluegill sunfish.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike are abundant.  Gillnet catches averaged 6.5/gillnet.  Average size of pike captured in 2007 was about 20.0 inches, but individuals approaching 30.0 inches were measured.  Pike do not grow fast in probable response to high summer water temperatures and limited yellow perch abundance.  Anglers are encouraged to harvest \"hammer-handle\" pike to thin the population and promote a balanced fish community. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill accounted for most of the total gamefish catch.  Population abundance is described as \"moderate\".  Bluegill trapnet catches averaged 16.7/net.   Size distribution of the population sample was fairly good.   Average size of 2008 survey catches was 6.2 inches. A few 8.0 inch and larger bluegill were recorded.   <br> \n <br> \nNavigation restrictions prevented utilization of electrofishing equipment to sample the largemouth bass population in 2008.  Habitat is excellent and prior survey statistics have described a moderately abundant population.  Growth is relatively slow, so most bass are 12.0 - 15.0 inches in length.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow and black bullhead carry unique importance in terms of water quality.  Yellow bullheads prefer and do best in lakes with good water quality, while an abundant black bullhead population is indicative of poor water quality conditions.  Presently, the North Union/Stony/Lottie chain has a survey catch ratio of about 2:1 yellow to black bullheads.  Black bullhead abundance can be projected to increase should cumulative pressures of land use, shoreline development, and recreational boating increase.  Thoughtful, low-impact residential development practices and environmentally-sensitive surface water use will help to ensure long-term sustainability of these quality lakes. <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

There is a large Bluegill population (91.0/trapnet) but the size and age would suggest a stunted population. Mean weight of the Bluegills sampled was 0.1 lbs. Largemouth Bass were sampled in the spring by electrofishing. Catch per unit effort was good with 21.6 bass caught per hour. Size and growth of the population is consistent with other lakes in the Alexandria Chain. Northern Cisco were present in the survey and could provide excellent forage for Northern Pike and Walleye.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lottie Lake is a small, relatively shallow basin in a chain of three small lakes that connect Lake Brophy to Lake Cowdry.  The other lakes in this chain include Stoney and North Union.  Total surface acreage of the three lakes is 253 acres.  The three lakes are treated as one in terms of fish management.  Management activities on this chain of lakes have been limited to periodic fish population surveys.  The Division of Fisheries has not stocked fish into any of these lakes because there is no legal public access.  Access to these lakes must be gained through culverts from lakes Brophy and Cowdry.  Culvert size and water level can restrict the size of boats that can access these lakes.All three lakes support abundant and diverse aquatic plant communities.  Submergent vegetation is dense in most shallow areas and the shoreline is fringed with common cattail.  These lakes also support beds of hardstem bulrush and wild rice.  Water lily is also common throughout the three lakes.  These aquatic plants provide valuable fish habitat and help maintain water quality in lakes.The fish communities present in these three lakes are quite similar and typical of small, densely vegetated lakes in west-central Minnesota.  Northern pike, largemouth bass, and sunfish provide most of the fishing opportunities in this chain of lakes.  These species are all relatively abundant, but average size tends to be small.   Anglers tend to target these lakes when high winds force them off of the larger lakes.  Anglers also fish for black crappie on these lakes in the spring, prior to the walleye opener.  Walleye likely move throughout the chain from the other lakes and are present in low numbers.    </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>North Union, Stony, and Lottie (Taylor) lakes form a chain of lakes between Brophy and Cowdry Lakes in Douglas County.  Lottie Lake is the lower lake in the chain and discharges to Lake Cowdry.  None of these three small basins have public landings, but anglers can utilize access sites on Cowdry and Brophy Lakes and navigate small watercraft throughout the chain via flowage channels.  Access to these lakes with larger, high profile boats is constrained by bridge crossings and road culverts. <br> \n  <br> \nThe lakes are small and relatively unique in that shoreline development is limited and much of the natural shoreline remains intact.  Water quality and clarity are very good. Water transparency at time of the early August survey was measured at 19.0 feet.  Near-shore soils support lush vegetative growth including bulrushes and water lilies.  These habitat characteristics are ideal for Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, and Bluegill. <br> \n <br> \nBluegills are abundant in Lottie Lake and accounted for most of the total gamefish catch.  Many of the Bluegills caught in the survey were small, but some fish over 8 inches were observed.  Average length of Bluegill captures was 5.8 inches.  Black Crappies catches were low, but crappies are typically difficult to catch in mid-summer surveys.  Crappies are likely more abundant than reflected in survey catch data.  Northern Pike are moderately abundant in Lottie Lake.  Most of the pike caught in the survey were less than 22 inches long, however pike over 30 inches long have been observed in past surveys.  Navigation restrictions prevented access with proper equipment to survey the Largemouth Bass population.  Only a few Largemouth Bass were caught in the survey nets, but habitat conditions are excellent for Largemouth Bass and bass are likely abundant. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers and other outdoor recreationists looking for a quiet lake should check out the North Union, Stony, and Lottie lake chain.  This chain of lakes provides a remote lake setting in close proximity to the city of Alexandria. <br> \n <br> \nLottie Lake was designated as an infested water in 2011 after discovery of zebra mussels in upstream lakes. Recreational users should take necessary precautions to prevent further spread of invasive species.  Drain all water and remove all aquatic vegetation from your boat and trailer when leaving any body of water.  Updated information on invasive species infestations can be found on the MN DNR website. <br> \n</p>",
