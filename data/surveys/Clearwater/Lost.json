                "narrative": "<p>Long Lost Lake is a scenic 493-acre lake located about ten miles west of Itasca State Park in southern Clearwater County.  Long Lost Lake has clear water; the Secchi depth was 16.8 feet in August 2010.  Bluegill, largemouth bass, and black crappie are the primary management species, with walleye, smallmouth bass, and northern pike managed as secondary species.  Long Lost Lake has an interesting history.  Since the early 1990's, the level of the lake has risen twelve feet, and recently has receded by two feet.  This has increased the surface area of the lake by approximately 100 acres, flooding lake cabins (some of which are still standing), and creating large amounts of standing timber in deep water.  This type of aquatic habitat is unique to natural lakes in northern Minnesota, and is more typical of a flood control reservoir.  Another recent change has been the unauthorized introduction of smallmouth bass.  These fish were first documented in 1993, and are now well established in Long Lost Lake, making it one of the only lakes in the Bemidji area with a fishable smallmouth bass population.   <br> \nThe bluegill catch rate from the 2010 population assessment (38.5/TN) was nearly twice the median catch rate for class 25 lakes.  The population is currently dominated by smaller fish, with no bluegill greater than 7.5 inches in length captured in the assessment.  The average size was 0.11 pounds (5.3 inches in length).  Growth rates for bluegill in Long Lost Lake are slow.  There are good numbers of bluegill from 6.0 to 7.5 inches in length present, and some of these fish will grow to a size preferred by anglers in the near future.   <br> \nThe black crappie catch rate of 0.8/TN was below the median for this lake class (1.5/TN) and similar to the previous assessment in 2005.  The largest black crappie captured was 12.2 inches in length.  Four age classes of crappie were identified in the catch.  Black crappie reproduction can be inconsistent in northern Minnesota Lakes.  Habitat for black crappie in Long Lost Lake is abundant, and potential fishing spots are numerous.  Fishing with a bobber around the flooded timber can be productive but be prepared to deal with numerous snags.    <br> \nLargemouth bass and smallmouth bass (LMB and SMB) electrofishing catch rates in the 2010 assessment were good, and substantially higher than historic catch rates from the 1990's.  LMB outnumbered SMB in the sample by 4 to 1.  LMB up to 16.7 inches and SMB up to 14.8 inches in length were captured.  Larger fish were observed but not captured.  Given the extensive flooded timber-deep water habitat, it may not be possible to get a truly representative sample of the bass population.  Interestingly, bass catch rates in the gill net portion of the 2010 assessment were high, which is not typical for this gear type, and suggests that bass (particularly SMB) in Long Lost Lake are utilizing deep water habitat as some of the gill nets are set in 45 feet of water.   Bass anglers should enjoy the scenery and diversity of habitat on Long Lost Lake and have an opportunity for some quality fishing.   <br> \nWalleye have been sampled in low numbers in the past few assessments.  Average size of the walleye catch in 2010 was impressive, with fish up to 29.7 inches in length captured, and a wide range of age classes present in the catch.  Walleye utilize deep water habitat in Long Lost Lake.  The lake stratifies deeply, with good oxygen levels down to 40+ feet in August of 2010.  Catch rates for walleye in Long Lost Lake may not be comparable to the more popular walleye lakes in the area, but the opportunity to catch a truly large walleye exists. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Long Lost Lake is a 501-acre lake with a maximum depth of 63 feet located 8 miles south of the town of Zerkel in southern Clearwater County.  Lake levels have fluctuated considerably since the early 1990's, and have receded approximately 3 feet in recent years although the lake is still quite a bit higher than historic levels.  This has resulted in extensive stands of flooded timber around the lakeshore.  There are two DNR public water accesses located on the lake.  The public access located on the south shore of the lake is flooded and has been closed.  The public access located on the east shore of the lake off of County Road 39 is also flooded; however, boat launching is possible and parking for 3 or 4 vehicles/trailers is available.  Long Lost Lake is managed for Bluegill, Largemouth and Smallmouth Bass, Black Crappie, Northern Pike and Walleye.  The lake is stocked annually with Walleye fry. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill and Black Crappie are abundant in Long Lost Lake although trap net catch rates for both species were down from the most recent survey in 2010.   This may be related to the recent drop in water levels, which changed the shoreline habitats where these nets are set.  Gill nets, on the other hand showed good catch rates for both Bluegill and Black Crappie.  Gill nets were set offshore in deeper water and captured quality-size fish of both species, with Bluegill up to 9.17 inches in length and Black Crappie up to 11.38 inches in length present.  A good representation of smaller fish in the catch shows that reproduction has been consistent for both species in recent years.   <br> \n <br> \nThe flooded timber habitat around the lakeshore is excellent for panfish species as well as Largemouth and Smallmouth Bass.  Actually, Long Lost is one of just a few lakes in the Bemidji area that contains Smallmouth Bass.  Both species were assessed in early June by night electrofishing.  In just under 2 hours of effort, 71 Largemouth and 23 Smallmouth Bass were captured, and these were good catch rates compared to other area bass lakes.  Largemouth lengths ranged from 4.5 to 18.4 inches with an average of 11.3 inches while smallmouth lengths ranged from 5.1 to 15.7 inches with an average of 9.8 inches.  Similar to the panfish catch, gill nets captured a better representation of larger Smallmouth Bass in the population, with an average length of 14.98 inches for gill net-caught smallies.  <br> \n   <br> \nNorthern Pike numbers have been increasing in Long Lost Lake over time, and the 2017 catch rate of 8 fish/gill net was near the top of the normal range found in similar lakes.  The average size was on the small side at 19.73 inches, although some larger pike are present.  The largest pike captured measured 37.17 inches in length, but only 16% of the pike catch was greater than 24 inches in length.  Long Lost Lake's pike population would likely benefit from the additional harvest of small Northern Pike that will be encouraged with the new statewide pike regulations that go into effect in 2018 and allow possession of up to 10 pike, with all fish from 22 to 26 inches immediately released and two fish over 26 inches allowed in possession.   <br> \n <br> \nThe 2017 Walleye catch rate of 3.63 fish/gill net was above the median catch rate (3 fish/gill net) for similar lakes.  Walleye had a good average size of 17.87 inches in length and 1.98 lbs/fish.  The largest Walleye captured was 23.35 inches in length.  There were 7 consecutive year classes of Walleye identified from age-1 to age-7, which shows that recent Walleye fry stockings are surviving and contributing to the fishery.   <br> \n <br> \nOther species of fish captured in the 2017 survey were Pumpkinseed, Hybrid Sunfish, Brown Bullhead and Yellow Perch.  Perch were small with an average size of 6.49 inches and few fish that would be big enough to interest anglers. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of the nearshore fish community in Long Lost Lake was conducted by Fisheries Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program Staff starting August 19, 2019. Fourteen sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 15-foot or 50-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at all 14 sites with two sites sampled from the boat due to site conditions. Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample six sites, a 15-foot seine was used at three sites, and soft sediments with abundant vegetation, dense woody habitat in the water, and deep water prevented the use of seines at five sampling sites. Nearshore sampling captured 10 native species of fish including one species that is intolerant of disturbance (Mimic Shiner) and no species that are tolerant of disturbance. <br> \n <br> \nData from this targeted nearshore survey is combined with trap net and gill net data from a July 2017 standard survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based Index of Biological Integrity (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment. In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g., Iowa Darter, Mimic Shiner, and Rock Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g., Black Bullhead). The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website. <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Crow Wing River Watershed assessment of surface waters process completed in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Long Lost Lake is a land-locked lake in southern Clearwater County.  The primary public access is off County Road 39, approximately 3 miles north of Highway 113.  The water level has risen 10.7 feet since 1993 and is now 8.7 feet above the ordinary high water level.  There is a potential for this lake to rise more, and the observed trend suggests this may happen.  The rising water has inundated some cabins and adjacent woodland areas.  The lake surface area has increased by about 60 acres with much of that area now flooded timber.  Submerged trees are creating some navigation hazards but are also providing additional habitat for various fish species.  A 10 mph speed limit is posted on the entire lake.  The primary public access and parking area is under water, but access is available off the entrance road.  Parking is limited, and the access is soft.  Anglers without 4 wheel drive and/or with large boats - BEWARE.  High water has also affected our sampling efforts and our ability to replicate previous sampling locations.  The 1995 management plan lists walleye as the primary management species.  Secondary management species are largemouth bass and bluegill.  The management plan recommends walleye fry stocking every third year.The walleye catch rate was the lowest, by far, in the last two decades of sampling.  An average weight of 1.7 pounds in the 2000 assessment reflects a lack of small walleye in the sample.  Assessments in 1983, 1988, and 1993, with higher catch rates of walleye, all had lower average weights.  There appears to be some natural reproduction though the walleye population has generally been dominated by stocked year classes.  The recent decline in the walleye catch rate probably illustrates the unpredictable success of infrequent fry stocking and/or the inability of natural reproduction to maintain a desirable walleye abundance.  However, it is also possible that the increased water level has negatively affected our ability to sample the habitat now utilized by the walleye population.Largemouth bass were abundant in the 2000 assessment, just as they have been in past assessments.  The abundance of submerged woody debris is considered to be beneficial to the largemouth population.  Many small largemouth bass were observed in shallow water areas.  The average size of the sample in the 2000 assessment was 10.7 inches.  Electrofishing over the 1993-1999 period captured 104 largemouth bass, but only five were more than 15 inches long.Smallmouth bass were introduced, from an unknown source, about 1989, and by 1993 they were well established in the lake.  The average weight of fish in the sample has increased since 1993, while catch rates by each gear type have decreased.  This is typical of an expanding population.The panfish population is composed of bluegill, pumpkinseed sunfish, black crappie, yellow perch, and an occasional hybrid sunfish.  Bluegill were sampled at a normal rate for this lake type.  With some searching in the bays, most anglers will be able to find angling action.  Some increase in assessment catch rate has occurred since 1983, but average size has declined.  The average length in the 2000 assessment was 5.8 inches.  About 10% of the bluegill in the sample exceeded 8 inches.  Pumpkinseed sunfish were common but not as abundant, nor as large, as bluegill.  The black crappie catch rate and average weight were about normal for this lake type.  Crappies may be seasonally available to anglers willing to search for them.  Results from scale aging suggested that three year classes of crappie were sampled, with about 80% of the sample from the 1997 year class. The black crappie sample averaged 8.3 inches long.  Yellow perch were not sampled in large numbers, but anglers targeting them may find enough for a meal.  The average length of the sample was 7.0 inches, but 23% of the perch measured were more than 8 inches long.Northern pike assessment catch rate was at a normal level for this lake type.  Average length and weight were 18.7 inches and 1.6 pounds.  The largest pike measured was 35.5 inches.</p>",
