Based on the profile, the top of the thermocline (i.e., the location in the water column with the sharpest transition from warm to cold water) occurred at approximately 19 feet. Dissolved oxygen decreased to below 3.0 mg/L at 27.4 feet, which was below the thermocline, at the time of sampling. The temperature at which dissolved oxygen decreased to below 3.0 mg/L (i.e., TDO3, a single variable to characterize oxythermal habitat) was 10.7?C (51.3?F). <br> \n <br> \nA TDO3 value warmer than 8.8?C indicates that oxythermal conditions are stressful for Lake Trout. Low dissolved oxygen concentrations (less than 3 mg/L) near the thermocline and warm surface temperatures would limit Lake Trout distributions within the water column. Data collected in 1956 and 1999 further indicate marginal oxythermal habitat, with the least favorable conditions recorded in 1999. When inadequate oxythermal habitat is available, these species are squeezed into unfavorable, warmer water conditions and experience higher levels of stress. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Ram is a designated stream trout lake that has been managed for Lake Trout and Rainbow Trout since it was reclaimed with a fish toxicant in 1966.  Lake Trout stocking was discontinued after 2011 due to strong evidence for sufficient natural reproduction.  This survey was the first of two scheduled in the 2011 lake management plan to determine whether the long range goal for Lake Trout (a minimum gill net catch of 2.0 fish/gill net set, with fish up to 20 inches) could be met without stocking. <br> \n <br> \nLake Trout appeared to have been abundant in 2016; the gill net catch (6.75 fish/net, deep and shallow sets combined) was well above the normal range (1.0-4.5 fish/net) for a lake of this type.  The 2016 catch easily exceeded the long range goal for Lake Trout in this lake, in terms of numbers of fish taken, and the size goal was also met by the capture of three fish larger than 20 inches.  Of the 27 Lake Trout taken in 2016, only seven bore fin clips identifying them as stocked fish (five from the 2011 stocking, and two from the 2009 stocking).  Long range goals for Lake Trout in this lake (catch and size) would have been met in 2016 even if no stocked fish had been taken.  Reasonably strong natural year classes were apparently produced in 2013, 2011, and 2010.   Growth for naturally produced Lake Trout had been relatively slow; six-year-old fish reached an average length of 13.3 inches at the end of their sixth year, compared to an area mean of 16.7 inches.  Growth of stocked fish had been faster.  <br> \n <br> \nAlthough Rainbow Trout (Kamloops strain) fingerlings had been stocked in 2010, 2012, and 2014, none were taken in this survey.  There has been no change in Rainbow Trout stocking that would account for a drop in gill net catches (the 2009 catch was 1.75 fish/gill net set).  Rainbow Trout gill net catches in this lake have typically been low, and the species is typically hard to sample in gill nets in any lake.  The failure to capture Rainbow Trout in any one survey is not necessarily an indication of a problem with the fishery; however, anglers also reported difficulty catching Rainbow Trout in Ram Lake in 2016, so it may well be that their numbers were unusually low. <br> \n <br> \nWhite Sucker have been present in Ram Lake since at least 1978, and the 2016 catch was similar to most catches seen in this lake since that time.  White Sucker compete with trout for invertebrate forage.  Many small lakes in this area support high numbers of Lake Trout and White Sucker, but Lake Trout growth in those lakes tends to be slow.  No other undesirable fish species were found in 2016.  Ram Lake discharges to Dislocation Lake, and movement of fish between those lakes has been suspected in the past.  Dislocation Lake supports a dense Yellow Perch population, and a natural Brook Trout population, but so far we have seen no evidence of either species making it into Ram Lake. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

Stocked 2007 and 2005 year classes were strong, but in each case about half the fish taken in the year class were unclipped and probably produced naturally.  The unstocked 2004 year class was also fairly strong.  The catch of unclipped lake trout alone (5.50 unclipped fish/gill net set) would have been high enough to meet current management goals for this lake.  Lake trout growth had been close to average for the Grand Marais area.  Fish reached an average length of 13.2 inches by the end of their fourth year. <br> \n <br> \nThe 2009 rainbow trout catch was about average for this lake historically, and when compared to catches in other rainbow trout lakes in the area.  All of the rainbow trout taken were age-3 fish from the 2006 stocking of kamloop-strain fingerlings.  As a result, average size for rainbow trout collected in 2009 was higher than usual.  The lack of smaller rainbow trout was not surprising.  Its likely that few of the small fingerlings stocked in fall 2008 would have been large enough by June 2009 to be taken in standard gill nets.  Growth of three-year-old rainbow trout taken in 2009 had been relatively fast; they averaged 16.5 inches in length at the end of their third year. <br> \n <br> \nThe 2009 white sucker gill net catch was one of the lower catches seen in this lake historically, and was low compared to catches seen in other stream trout lakes in this area.  Reduced competition for invertebrate forage, due to lower white sucker abundance, may have helped rainbow trout achieve the good growth seen in fish taken in 2009. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",
