                "narrative": "<p>Lake Crystal is a 393-acre lake partially surrounded by the city of Lake Crystal on its southwest side in Blue Earth County.  Lake Crystal is shallow and highly productive, which is common in landscapes dominated by agriculture.  Much of the shoreline and riparian zone of Lake Crystal is developed.  A city owned park located on the southwest shore provides public access to the lake.  The sport fish community consists of black crappie, white crappie, northern pike, walleye, channel catfish, bluegill, and yellow perch.  The walleye population is maintained through stocking.  Walleye fry were stocked in 2002, 2007, 2008, and 2010.  The current management plan calls for walleye fry stocking to occur in even years.  Lake Crystal was surveyed the week of 8/8/2011 to monitor the fish community. <br> \n <br> \nAlthough gill net catch rates of walleyes in the 2011 survey (11.5/gill net) were the lowest observed catch rates since 1972, walleye numbers were still above average for lakes similar to Lake Crystal in 2011. Walleye catch rates declined from 57.0/gill net in the 2006 survey to 11.5/gill net in the 2011 survey. Gill netted walleyes ranged in length from 10.0 inches to 22.4 inches with an average of 16.3 inches. Size structure of walleyes was good, with 63% of the fish sampled being larger than 17.8 inches in total length.  <br> \n <br> \nThe northern pike population appears to be on the upswing in Lake Crystal. Prior to this survey, pike were in low abundance (i.e., 0.0/gill net and less than 0.5/trap net) dating back to the 1991 survey. In the 2011 survey, pike were captured at a rate of 6.3/gill net which is above average for lakes similar to Lake Crystal. Total length of northern pike sampled in gill nets ranged from 18.4 inches to 24.6 inches and averaged 21.1 inches. Although northern pike have not been stocked directly into Lake Crystal, northern pike were stocked in Mills Lake in 2003, 2004, and 2006 which is directly connected to Lake Crystal.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch catch rates for gill nets (3.3/gill net) and trap nets (0.5/trap net) were below average when compared to similar lakes and were consistent with historical catch rates.  Approximately 78% of the yellow perch sampled were between 8.0 and 10.2 inches, with no fish exceeding 10.2 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nCatch rates of black crappies in both trap nets and gill nets were very high at 28.6/trap net and 94.5/gill net. In comparison, catch rates in 2006 were 14.4/trap net and 11.5/gill net. Although catch rates of black crappie were extremely high compared to similar lakes, the size structure of the population was small. Black crappies ranged in length from 5.0 inches to 11.6 inches and averaged 5.9 inches in gill nets. Total length of black crappies captured in trap nets ranged from 4.0 inches to 11.5 inches and averaged 6.2 inches. Ninety-eight percent of black crappies captured in gill nets and 90% of black crappies captured in trap nets were less than 6.5 inches in total length. White crappies were sampled in both sampling gears. Although relative abundance was low (4.8/gill net and 1.3/trap net), this was the first time that white crappies have been sampled during a survey since the 1972 survey.  <br> \n <br> \nBlack bullhead catch rates in trap nets and gill nets were substantially higher than in the previous survey in 2006. In the 2006 survey, catch rates of black bullheads were 61.0/gill net and 6.8/trap net while the 2011 survey revealed increased black bullhead abundance (189.8/gill net and 159.4/trap net). Catch rates of black bullheads were above average when compared to lakes similar to Lake Crystal. The yellow bullhead population also appears to be increasing. Since 1996, yellow bullhead catch rates have not exceeded 1.7/trap net. 2011 trap net catch rates averaged 14.6/trap net. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch catch rates for gill nets (3.3/gill net) and trap nets (0.5/trap net) were below average when compared to similar lakes. Approximately 78% of the yellow perch sampled were between 8.0 and 10.2 inches, with no fish exceeding 10.2 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nCommon carp numbers increased substantially from catch rates observed during the 2006 survey. Gill net catch rates of common carp increased from 2.5/gill net in 2006 to 30.5/gill net in 2011. Trap net catch rates of common carp increased from 0.6/trap net in 2006 to 8.5/trap net in 2011. The majority of common carp captured ranged from 9.0 to 15.0 inches in total length.  <br> \n <br> \nBigmouth buffalo, bluegill, channel catfish, and white sucker were present but occurred in low numbers. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers can help maintain or improve the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest. Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for table fare, but encourages release of medium- to large-sized fish. Releasing these fish can help maintain balance in the fish community in Lake Crystal and provide anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future.  <br> \n <br> \nShoreline areas on the land and into the shallow water provide essential habitat for fish and wildlife that live in or near Minnesota's lakes. Overdeveloped shorelines cannot support the fish, wildlife, and clean water that are associated with natural undeveloped lakes. Shoreline habitat consists of aquatic plants, woody plants, and natural lake bottom soils.  <br> \n <br> \nPlants in the water and at the water's edge provide habitat, prevent erosion, and absorb excess nutrients. Shrubs, trees, and woody debris such as fallen trees or limbs provide good habitat both above and below the water and should be left in place. By leaving a buffer strip of natural vegetation along the shoreline, property owners can reduce erosion, help maintain water quality, and provide habitat and travel corridors for wildlife. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Crystal is a 393-acre lake located within the town of Lake Crystal in northwest Blue Earth County. A city-owned public access is located on the west side of the lake within Robinson Park. The lake is shallow with a maximum depth of 8 feet. The lake has generally poor water clarity and frequent algal blooms caused by elevated nutrient levels and has a history of periodic winterkills. Approximately half of the shoreline has been altered to suit residential development. Nearshore woody habitat is common along the unaltered shorelines, but aquatic vegetation is sparse lakewide and of poor quality. County Ditch 56 flows into the lake near the public access and carries silt and elevated nutrients into the lake. A silt delta forms at the mouth and requires regular dredging to maintain depth near the access. Lake Crystal is primarily managed for Walleye and secondarily for Black Crappie, Bluegill, and Yellow Perch. Walleye fry are stocked annually. Additional Walleye fry and adult Black Crappie, Bluegill, and Yellow Perch are stocked following winterkill events. Lake Crystal is designated as a Tier-2 lake and will be surveyed as part of regularly scheduled monitoring program at a frequency of every 6 years.  <br> \n <br> \nA standard survey is used for sampling a wide range of fish species during the summer months using standard methods (i.e., standard time of year, set sampling stations, taking water clarity readings and oxygen/temperature profiles, etc.) and gears (i.e., lake survey gillnets, trap nets, and spring electrofishing for Largemouth Bass). The 2022 survey was completed the week of August 15, 2022, using 4 gill nets and 9 trap nets. Water quality parameters were also measured. <br> \n <br> \nA total of 44 Walleyes were sampled with the gill nets for a catch rate of 11.0/net, indicating moderate to high numbers were present. The 2022 Walleye catch rate was the lowest since 1996. The average catch rate from 1996 to 2022 was 25.6/net. Walleye ranged from 9.5 to 26.2 inches with an average of 17.6 inches. Approximately 86% of Walleye sampled were larger than 15 inches and 25% exceeded 20 inches. An additional 70 Walleyes averaging 18.1 inches were sampled with the trap nets. Walleye from both gears were 1 to 8 years old with 7 year-classes present. The 3-year-old age group was the most abundant, accounting for over half the sample. Growth was fast with Walleye approaching 16 inches at year 3. Annual fry stocking continues to support an abundant Walleye population in Lake Crystal. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie were common in the trap nets with a total of 141 sampled for a catch rate of 15.7/net. Since 1996, Black Crappie catch rates have varied from 11.2/net to 40.8/net with an average of 20.4/net.  The 2016 catch rate was 40.8/net. Black Crappie sampled in 2022 ranged from 5.5 to 15.2 inches with an average of 8.6 inches. Most Black Crappie were over 8 inches and about 13% were over 10 inches. Black Crappie numbers were also high in the gill nets with a catch rate of 14.8/net and a maximum size of 11.7 inches. Black Crappie from both gears were 1 to 5 years old with 2-year-old fish accounting for more than 71% of the sample. Black Crappie growth was fast with an average length of 9.1 inches at year 3. The Black Crappie population of Lake Crystal was of high quality in 2022 and anglers have reported good trips targeting them in recent years. <br> \n <br> \nOnly 9 Bluegills were sampled with the trap nets in 2022 for a catch rate of 1.0/net, indicating low numbers were present. Catch rates have averaged just 2.5/net since 1996. A lack of aquatic vegetation and suitable spawning habitat has limited the ability of Bluegills to reproduce and create a viable fishery in Lake Crystal. <br> \n <br> \nA total of 25 Yellow Perch were sampled with the gill nets for a catch rate of 6.3/net which nearly matched the all-time high catch rate of 7.3/net in 2016. Catch rates have averaged just 3.7/net since 1996. Yellow Perch were small with an average of 7.6 inches. <br> \n <br> \nThe most abundant species sampled in 2022 was the Black Bullhead. Black Bullhead dominated both gill net (186.0/net) and trap net (399.2/net) samples. Extremely high numbers of Black Bullheads correlate with poor water quality and lake instability, and they often dominate the fish community following winterkills and other disturbances. Drastic improvements in water quality and habitat are needed in Lake Crystal in order to suppress Black Bullhead numbers. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled in 2022 include Bigmouth Buffalo (19.8/gill net), Common Carp (0.2/trap net), Northern Pike (1.8/gill net), White Crappie (0.2/trap net), White Sucker (0.8/gill net), and Yellow Bullhead (3.8/trap net). <br> \n <br> \nWater clarity was poor with a secchi reading of 1.5 feet due to dense algae. The dissolve oxygen and temperature readings ranged from 9.1 ppm and 73.9 degrees Fahrenheit at the surface to 7.4 ppm and 73.6 degrees Fahrenheit at 7 feet. No thermocline was detected. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers can help maintain or improve the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest. Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for table fare but encourages release of medium- to large-sized fish. Releasing these fish can help maintain balance in the fish community in Lake Crystal and provide anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future. <br> \n <br> \nShoreline areas on the land and into the shallow water provide essential habitat for fish and wildlife that live in or near Minnesota's lakes. Overdeveloped shorelines cannot support the fish, wildlife, and clean water that are associated with natural undeveloped lakes. Shoreline habitat consists of aquatic plants, woody plants, and natural lake bottom soils.  <br> \n <br> \nPlants in the water and at the water's edge provide habitat, prevent erosion, and absorb excess nutrients. Shrubs, trees, and woody debris such as fallen trees or limbs provide good habitat both above and below the water and should be left in place. By leaving a buffer strip of natural vegetation along the shoreline, property owners can reduce erosion, help maintain water quality, and provide habitat and travel corridors for wildlife. <br> \n <br> \n-Sky Wigen, fisheries specialist <br> \n</p>",

Although an aeration system is operated on Lake Crystal, low oxygen conditions in the winter of 2000 - 2001 caused a temporary decline in the populations of black crappie and bluegill.  However, walleye populations were less impacted by the winterkill.  In the spring of 2001, 880 lbs. of yellow perch adults and 620,000 walleye fry were stocked into Lake Crystal.  In 2001 walleye gill net catch was 21 per net and was similar to 1996 survey (36 per net).  Most walleye were around 16 to 17 inches and the largest was 27 inches.  A number of young-of-year black crappie were caught in trap nets indicating good reproduction that should reestablish black crappie in Lake Crystal.  Lake Crystal has been aerated since 1979.  Frequent winterkill historically limited the abundance of some fish species.  The operation of the aeration system has significantly reduced the occurrence of winterkill.</p>",

No northern pike were sampled during the survey.Bluegill are low in abundance but are large - many over 8 inches.  Others, 6 inches or smaller, should contribute to the fishery over the next several years.  Black crappie are very abundant.  The majority of crappie are between 5-7 inches, and almost 20% are between 9-13 inches.    A channel catfish population is emerging, with fish between 12-18 inches.  This should provide fishing opportunities for anglers seeking them.  Black bullhead are low in abundance, with fish between 8-12 inches making up most of the population.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Crystal is a 393-acre lake partially surrounded by the city of Lake Crystal on its southwest side in Blue Earth County.  Lake Crystal is shallow and highly productive, which is common in landscapes dominated by agriculture.  Much of the shoreline and riparian zone of Lake Crystal is developed.  A city owned park located on the southwest shore provides public access to the lake.  The sport fish community consists of Black Crappie, White Crappie, Northern Pike, Walleye, Channel Catfish, Bluegill, and Yellow Perch.  The Walleye population is maintained through stocking.  <br> \nWalleye <br> \n <br> \nWalleye catch rates (18.3/gill net) rebounded from 2011 (11.5/gill net) which were the lowest observed catch rates since the 1972 survey. The 2016 catch exceeded the 3rd quartile for lakes similar to Lake Crystal (Class 43).  Gill netted Walleyes ranged in length from 7.7 inches to 15.6 inches with an average of 10.4 inches.  Size structure indices indicate a young Walleye population and only 3 year classes (2013, 2014, and 2015) were sampled due to a strong winter-kill during 2013-2014.  Walleye fry were stocked in 2014, 2015, and 2016 following the winter-kill. <br> \nNorthern Pike <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike have been sampled in low abundance (i.e., 0.0/gill net and less than 0.5/trap net) dating back to the 1991 survey, with the exception of the 2011 survey (6.3/gill net).  Northern Pike numbers in 2016 returned to more historic levels as only two Northern Pike (0.7/gill net), measuring 17.6 and 19.4 inches, were sampled with gill nets. Although Northern Pike are not stocked directly into Lake Crystal, Northern Pike were stocked in Mills Lake in 2003, 2004, and 2006 which is directly connected to Lake Crystal.  Northern Pike are more tolerant of low oxygen than many other game fish species and some may have survived the winter-kill of 2013-2014. <br> \nBlack Crappie <br> \n <br> \nCatch rates of Black Crappies in both trap nets and gill nets were high in 2016 with 34.2/gill net and 40.8/trap net compared to 28.6/trap net and 94.5/gill net in 2011.  The 2016 trap net and gill net catch rates of Black Crappies exceeded the 3rd quartile for similar lakes for both sampling gears. Black Crappie size structure improved from 2011 when the majority of fish were small.  Black Crappies sampled in gill nets in 2016 ranged in length from 5.9 inches to 13.1 inches and averaged 8.5 inches. Total length of Black Crappies captured in trap nets ranged from 3.1 inches to 14.1 inches and averaged 8.7 inches.  White Crappies were sampled in low numbers (1.6/net) with trap nets in 2016.  White Crappies were also present in the 2011 survey (4.8/gill net and 1.3/trap net) for the first time since the 1972 survey. <br> \nYellow Perch <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch catch rates for gill nets (7.3/gill net) were between the 1st and 2nd quartiles for lakes similar to Lake Crystal and was the highest rate since 1982. Yellow Perch averaged 8.8 inches and ranged from 7.5 to 11.1 inches. <br> \nYellow Bullhead <br> \n <br> \nBlack Bullhead catch rates in trap nets (69.4/trap net) and gill nets (112.3/gill net) were between the median and upper quartile for class 43 lakes and were lower than in the 2011 survey.  In 2006, catch rates of Black Bullheads were 189.8/gill net and 159.4/trap net.  Yellow Bullhead catch rates (8.8/trap net) also decreased from the 2011 survey (14.6/trap net), although they remain higher than recent surveys and exceed the upper quartile for class 43 lakes.  Size structure of Yellow Bullheads sampled with gill nets was good.  Yellow Bullheads averaged 9.0 inches and ranged from 6.5 to 14.3 inches. <br> \nCommon Carp <br> \n <br> \nCommon Carp abundance decreased substantially from the 2011 survey.  Gill net catch rates of Common Carp decreased from 30.5/gill net in 2011 to 1.3/gill net in 2016.  Trap net catch rates of Common Carp decreased from 8.5/trap net in 2011 to 4.3/trap net in 2016.  Both trap net and gill net catch rates were between the lower and upper quartiles for class 43 lakes.  The majority of Common Carp captured were greater than 20 inches in total length. <br> \n <br> \nOther species <br> \nBigmouth buffalo, Bluegill, Channel Catfish, Golden Shiner, Hybrid Sunfish and White Sucker were present but occurred in low numbers. <br> \n  <br> \nAnglers can help maintain or improve the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest. Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for table fare, but encourages release of medium- to large-sized fish. Releasing these fish can help maintain balance in the fish community in Lake Crystal and provide anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future. <br> \n <br> \nShoreline areas on the land and into the shallow water provide essential habitat for fish and wildlife that live in or near Minnesota's lakes. Overdeveloped shorelines cannot support the fish, wildlife, and clean water that are associated with natural undeveloped lakes. Shoreline habitat consists of aquatic plants, woody plants, and natural lake bottom soils.  <br> \n <br> \nPlants in the water and at the water's edge provide habitat, prevent erosion, and absorb excess nutrients. Shrubs, trees, and woody debris such as fallen trees or limbs provide good habitat both above and below the water and should be left in place. By leaving a buffer strip of natural vegetation along the shoreline, property owners can reduce erosion, help maintain water quality, and provide habitat and travel corridors for wildlife. <br> \n <br> \n-Sky Wigen, Fisheries Specialist <br> \n</p>",

This population features well-balanced size and age structures, which provides excellent angling opportunities.  Bluegill and black crappie populations have rebounded following a 2001 winterkill event.  Most fish were less than age 5 and growth rates are good for both species. Given the populations size and age structure, the panfishing opportunities should continue to improve.  The channel catfish population also appears to be improving as catch rates continue to increase.  The size structure is good and the populations should provide good fishing for quality-sized catfish.</p>",
