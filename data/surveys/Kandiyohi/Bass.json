                "narrative": "<p>A standard survey of Bass Lake was conducted in early July of 2018. In addition, a mid-June Largemouth Bass (post spawn fish) night electrofishing survey was also conducted in 2018. A targeted survey is generally used for sampling a specific kind of fish or time of year (i.e. spawning season, fall season, etc.) unlike a standard survey which samples a wider range of fish species during the summer months using standard methodology (i.e. standard time of year, set sampling stations, taking water clarity readings and oxygen/temperature profiles, etc.) and gears (i.e. lake survey gillnets, trapnets and possibly spring electrofishing for Largemouth Bass). <br> \n <br> \nBass is a small (52 acres) and moderately productive lake located in Kandiyohi County. The maximum depth is 31 feet. A township public access with limited parking and turn around is located along the north shore. Residential development (11 homes) has occurred primarily along the north and west shoreline areas. Hardwoods dominate the east and south shorelines. Agricultural row crop drainage into the lake occurs via 3 inlets/tiles located along the west and north shores. Water levels were above normal in 2018. Recently, an existing tile line along the west side was repaired allowing more runoff to flow into Bass Lake during rain events. The crude log/mud outlet structure failed in 2002 because of erosion making fish movements more feasible and causing a water-level drop of about 2 feet. Common Carp were sampled in both gillnets and trapnets in 2003 which was the first time Common Carp were sampled since 1979. Common Carp may have immigrated into Bass Lake after the outlet structure failed. The outlet structure was repaired in 2006 by SWCD, county, and state. The Bass Lake outlet connects to Tait's Lake. It continues flowing downstream thru two wetlands of which the furthest downstream wetland was the Diamond Lake Northern Pike Spawning Area \"NPSA\". The NPSA wetland flowed under Kandiyohi County Road #4 and into the southwest corner of Diamond Lake. Kandiyohi County Road #4 was rerouted around to the west side of the Diamond Lake County Park in 2018. The Diamond Lake NPSA water control structure and fish barrier were removed due to the new culvert placement and road upgrades. However this may increase fish movement from Diamond into Bass Lake during high water events if the Bass Lake outlet structure fails again.  <br> \n <br> \nLate ice out (late April-early May) occurred on area lakes in 2018. Water clarity was fair (secchi=6.0 feet) on July 16, 2018. The total phosphorus level relatively low (0.026 ppm) from a previous survey conducted on June 10, 2013. Dissolved oxygen was low (< 1 ppm) in water depths greater than 15 feet during a 2018 mid-summer profile. Algae blooms often occur during the late summer months or years with high precipitation and runoff events on Bass. A light algae bloom was present during the 2018 survey. Submergent vegetation densities (pondweed species) have been historically variable in the lake, but were light during 2018. Light densities of curly-leaf pondweed was present in 2018. The most frequently occurring aquatic vegetation species sampled included water moss, filamentous algae, clasping-leaf pondweed and sago pondweed during the 2013 survey. Emergent vegetation presently consists of yellow waterlily (southwest corner), reed canary grass (scattered stands around the lake), cattails (north and east shoreline) and hardstem bulrush (east shoreline). Hardstem bulrush plants were transplanted into Bass Lake along the northeast and southwest corners of the lake in June of 1994. Shoalwater substrates consist mostly of sand, gravel and silt. A severe winterkill occurred during the 1996-97 winter due in part to heavy snow accumulations. Dissolved oxygen levels were adequate (> 6 ppm) during heavy snow accumulations of February/March 2019. Anglers target primarily Northern Pike, Bluegill, Black Crappie and Largemouth Bass in Bass Lake. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass numbers (post spawn) were abundant (180.00 fish/hour) in the 2018 mid-June night electrofishing survey. The Largemouth Bass average size was moderate (11.82 inches and 1.06 pounds) in the 2018 mid-June electrofishing survey. The 2018 catch rate of preferred size (15.0 inches and larger) largemouth bass was high (25.09 fish/hour). There were also abundant numbers of small (<8.0 inches) Largemouth Bass present in the 2018 mid-June electrofishing survey. Post spawn electrofishing surveys generally catch greater numbers of smaller or younger Largemouth bass than previous electrofishing surveys conducted during the spawning season. Largemouth Bass also tend to be found near docks, downed trees in the water or within submergent vegetation adjacent to deep water during post spawn conditions versus shallow spawning bay areas often containing bulrush. Largemouth Bass growth rates were slightly below average. The 2013 year class comprised 23% of the 2018 total Largemouth Bass spring electrofishing catch. Largemouth Bass adults were stocked (22 fish) in Bass Lake during the spring of 1997 following the 1996-97 winterkill. No Smallmouth Bass were captured in the 2018 survey.  <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie numbers were low in 2018 (1.17 fish/trapnet) compared to similar lakes and the historical average (7.63 fish/trapnet). Abundant Black Crappie numbers (13.67 fish/trapnet, 8.7 inches) were captured in the previous 2013 survey. The Black Crappie average size was large (0.60 pounds and 9.9 inches) in the 2018 trapnets. Black Crappie growth rates were above average for older fish. The 2014 and 2013 year classes each comprised 33% of the 2018 Black Crappie catch. Black Crappie adults were stocked into Bass during the spring of 1997 (121 fish) and 2000 (532 fish) following the 1996-97 winterkill. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike were absent in 2018 survey nets. Northern Pike abundance was moderate in the previous 2013 survey (4.00 fish/gillnet, 27.0 inches). The Northern Pike historical average catch rate is 5.18 fish/gillnet. Northern Pike adults (48 fish) were stocked into Bass Lake during 1998. It is unlikely that Northern Pike are totally absent from Bass Lake. Northern Pike possession limit regulations for Bass Lake in the North-central Zone are as follows: 10 (Not more than 2 over 26\". All from 22-26\" must be immediately released.) by angling; 10 (only 1 Northern Pike between 22-26\" and 1 over 26\"; or 2 over 26\") by dark house spearing. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch were absent in 2018 and 2013 surveys. The Yellow Perch historical average catch rate is 20.85 fish/gillnet. Local lakeshore residents have reported a recent decrease in catch rates of Northern Pike, Black Crappie and Yellow Perch. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye numbers were low (2.00 fish/gillnet and 0.17 fish/trapnet) in 2018. Walleye were absent in the 2013 survey. The Walleye historical catch rate is 1.45 fish/gillnet. The 2018 Walleye average size was large (4.09 pounds) from gillnets. The Walleye historical average weight is 2.64 pounds from gillnets. Walleye are not currently stocked in Bass. These fish entered Bass either from downstream sources (Tait's Lake or Diamond Lake) during high water events or were stocked by other people. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill numbers were moderate in 2018 (27.83 fish/trapnet) compared to similar lakes. The Bluegill historical average catch rate is 37.58 fish/trapnet. The 2018 Bluegill average size was large (0.26 pounds and 6.7 inches) from trapnets. The Bluegill historical average weight is 0.18 pounds from trapnets. The 2018 catch rate of quality size (6.0 inches and larger) Bluegill was high (20.62 fish/trapnet). The 2018 catch rate of preferred size (8.0 inches and larger) Bluegill was moderate (3.02 fish/trapnet). Bluegill growth rates were above average. The 2012 year class comprised 41% of the 2018 total Bluegill catch. Bluegill adults (2,415 fish) were stocked into Bass Lake during the spring of 1997 following the 1996-97 winterkill. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Bullhead were absent in the 2018 survey and low in the previous 2013 survey (0.17 fish/trapnet). Yellow Bullhead abundance was also low in the 2018 and 2013 trapnets (0.50 fish/trapnet). Common Carp abundance was high (5.00 fish/gillnet and 1.17 fish/trapnet) in 2018. The Common Carp average size was small (2.40 pounds) in the 2018 trapnets. No Common Carp were captured in the 2013 survey nets. The historical average catch rates are 14.08 Black Bullhead/trapnet, 1.35 Yellow Bullhead/trapnet and 1.07 Common Carp/gillnet.  <br> \n <br> \nCurrent fish management activities on Bass Lake include monitoring the fish population on a periodic basis, periodic winter oxygen testing, participating in local watershed initiatives, protecting native aquatic vegetation through the permit process, preventing and educating about the spread of invasive species, and stocking various fish species as warranted. The Bass Lake fishery will be resurveyed in 2023 for all fish species. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A fish population assessment of Bass Lake was conducted in July of 2003. Bass is a small (52 acres) and moderately productive lake located in Kandiyohi County. The maximum depth is 31 feet. Residential development has occurred primarily along the north and west shoreline areas. Hardwoods dominate the east and south shorelines. Agricultural row crop drainage into the lake occurs via several inlets/tiles located along the west shore. A township public access with limited parking and turn around is located along the north shore. Emergent vegetation (bulrush) is present along the northeast and southeast corners. Water quality and clarity are moderate, but algae blooms can occur during the late summer months. Submergent vegetation densities (pondweed species) have been historically variable in the lake. Bass is connected to a large shallow and productive lake (Taits) via an outlet channel during moderate/high water level conditions. Taits Lake is connected to Diamond Lake. Fish movement into Bass can occur from the two lakes during high water events in the spring months. Water levels were down 2-3 feet in 2003 due to drought conditions and the partial collapse and erosion of a private outlet structure. A severe winterkill occurred during the 1996-97 winter due in part to heavy snow accumulations. Fish species captured in the 1997 spring trapnet sets following the winterkill were yellow perch, black bullhead, yellow bullhead, and white sucker. Bass Lake was restocked between 1997-2000 with northern pike, largemouth bass, bluegill, and black crappie. Local anglers had good fishing success for yellow perch during the 2002-2003 winter and largemouth bass during the 2003 summer.Largemouth bass numbers were high in the 2003 Bass Lake spring electrofishing survey (58.5 fish/hour) and above the historical average (47.3 fish/hour). The 2003 largemouth bass average size was moderate to large (1.85 pounds and 13.3 inches) from spring electrofishing. The catch rate of preferred size (15.0 inches) and larger largemouth bass was high (19.4 fish/hour) in 2003. The largest largemouth bass captured was 18.5 inches in the 2003 spring electrofishing survey. Largemouth bass growth rates in Bass Lake were above the normal ranges for ages 1-7 compared to area lakes. The 2001 year class comprised 51% of the total largemouth bass spring electrofishing catch. Black crappie numbers were low in 2003 (2.0 fish/gillnet), but similar to the historical average (1.8 fish/gillnet). There were no black crappie captured in the 2003 trapnets (7.4 fish/trapnet historical average). The black crappie average size was small (0.09 pounds and 5.5 inches) from gillnets. All black crappie captured in the 2003 summer assessment were from the 2002 year class. A moderate sized black crappie year class from 1997 was documented in a 1999 resurvey, however no fish from this year class were captured in 2003. Black crappie adults were stocked into Bass during the spring of 1997 (121 fish) and 2000 (532 fish) following the 1996-97 winterkill.Northern pike numbers were high in 2003 (14.0 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes and above the Bass Lake historical average catch rate (5.4 fish/gillnet). The 2003 northern pike average size was moderate to small (2.19 pounds and 20.9 inches) from gillnets. The northern pike historical average weight is 3.08 pounds from gillnets. The catch rate of quality size (21.0 inches) and larger northern pike was moderate (5.0 fish/gillnet) in 2003. The largest northern pike captured in the 2003 nets was 30.7 inches. Northern pike growth rates in Bass Lake were generally within the normal ranges for ages 1-5 except for age 3 compared to area lakes. Approximately 68% of the northern pike captured in the 2003 summer assessment were from the 2001 year class. Yellow perch numbers were low in 2003 (1.0 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes and below the historical average catch rate (29.4 fish/gillnet). The 2003 yellow perch average length was 6.3 inches from gillnets and trapnets combined. The largest yellow perch captured in the 2003 nets was 9.5 inches. The majority of yellow perch captured in the 2003 gillnets and trapnets were from the 2001 and 2000 year classes.Walleye numbers were high in 2003 (6.0 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes and also above the Bass Lake historical catch rate (1.64 fish/gillnet). The 2003 walleye average size was moderate to large (2.02 pounds and 17.2 inches) from gillnets. The walleye historical average weight is 2.13 pounds from gillnets. Walleye growth rates were above the normal ranges for ages 1-3, and within the normal range for age 4 compared to area lakes. Walleye captured in 2003 nets were from 1999-2001 year classes. The catch rate of quality size (15.0 inches) and larger walleye was moderate (5.0 fish/gillnet) in 2003. Presently, it is not known whether the walleye population in Bass Lake is due primarily to immigration into the lake from Diamond via Taits Lake or illegal stockings. Bluegill numbers were moderate in 2003 (19.0 fish/trapnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes, but below the Bass Lake historical average catch rate (35.7 fish/trapnet). The 2003 bluegill average size was large (0.24 lbs. and 6.5 inches) from trapnets. The bluegill historical average weight is 0.17 pounds from trapnets. The catch rate of quality size (6.0 inches) and larger bluegill was high (15.5 fish/trapnet) in 2003. Bluegill growth rates in Bass Lake were generally above the normal ranges for ages 1-4 compared to area lakes. The 2000 year class comprised 64% of the total bluegill catch in the 2003 nets. Bluegill adults (2,415 fish) were stocked into Bass Lake during the spring of 1997 following the 1996-97 winterkill.Black bullhead numbers were high in 2003 (62.0 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range of similar lakes and the highest historical recorded value from gillnets for Bass Lake The 2003 black bullhead average size was moderate to large (0.40 pounds and 7.5 inches) from gillnets. The black bullhead historical average weight is 0.42 pounds from gillnets.Other fish species of special interest captured in the 2003 gillnets included moderate numbers of carp (2.0 fish/gillnet) and high numbers of white sucker (4.0 fish/gillnet). The historical average catch rates were 0.8 carp/gillnet and 2.6 white sucker/gillnet. The 2003 average weights were 2.31 pounds and 1.13 pounds for carp and white sucker respectively.Current fish management activities on Bass Lake include monitoring the fish population on a periodic basis, periodic winter oxygen testing, protecting aquatic vegetation through the permit process, habitat enhancement through bulrush planting, and stocking various fish species as warranted. The Bass Lake fishery will be resurveyed in the 2007 spring and summer for all fish species. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A standard survey of Bass Lake was conducted in early July of 2023. Two large frame trapnets (6'W x 5'H) were also set for Bluegill. In addition, an early June Largemouth Bass (mix of pre and post spawn fish) night electrofishing survey was conducted in 2023. A targeted survey is generally used for sampling a specific kind of fish or time of year (i.e. spawning season, fall season, etc.) unlike a standard survey which samples a wider range of fish species during the summer months using standard methodology (i.e. standard time of year, set sampling stations, taking water clarity readings and oxygen/temperature profiles, etc.) and gears (i.e. lake survey gillnets, trapnets and possibly spring electrofishing for Largemouth Bass). <br> \n <br> \nBass is a small (52 acres) and moderately productive lake located in Kandiyohi County. The maximum depth is 31 feet. A township public access with limited parking and turn around is located along the north shore. Residential development (11 homes) has occurred primarily along the north and west shoreline areas. Hardwoods dominate the east and south shorelines. Agricultural row crop drainage into the lake occurs via 3 inlets/tiles located along the west and north shores. Water levels were below normal in 2023. Recently, an existing tile line along the west side was repaired allowing more runoff to flow into Bass Lake during rain events. The crude log/mud outlet structure failed in 2002 because of erosion making fish movements more feasible and causing water-level to drop about 2 feet. Common Carp were sampled in both gillnets and trapnets in 2003 which was the first-time carp were sampled since 1979. Common Carp may have immigrated into Bass Lake after the outlet structure failed. The outlet structure was repaired in 2006 by SWCD, county, and state. The Bass Lake outlet connects to Tait's Lake. It continues flowing downstream thru two wetlands of which the furthest downstream wetland was the Diamond Lake Northern Pike Spawning Area \"NPSA\". The NPSA wetland flows under Kandiyohi County Road #4 and into the southwest corner of Diamond Lake. Kandiyohi County Road #4 was rerouted around to the west side of the Diamond Lake County Park in 2018. The Diamond Lake NPSA water control structure and fish barrier were removed due to the new culvert placement and road upgrades. However, this may increase fish movement from Diamond into Bass Lake during high water events if the Bass Lake outlet structure fails again. Water clarity was moderate (secchi=7.5 feet) on July 10, 2023. The total phosphorus level was relatively low (0.026 ppm) from a previous survey conducted on June 10, 2013. Dissolved oxygen was low (< 1 ppm) in water depths greater than 20 feet during a 2023 mid-summer profile. Algae blooms often occur during the late summer months or years with high precipitation and runoff events on Bass. No significant blue-green algae blooms were noted in the 2018 and 2023 surveys. Filamentous algae were abundant in Bass during the 2023 survey. Submergent vegetation densities (pondweed species) have been historically variable in the lake but were moderate during 2023. Curly-leaf pondweed and Eurasian watermilfoil were not observed in the 2023 vegetation survey. However, Eurasian watermilfoil was found in Bass Lake later during 2023. The most frequently occurring aquatic vegetation species observed during the 2023 survey included water moss, filamentous algae, clasping-leaf pondweed, coontail, northern watermilfoil and sago pondweed. Emergent vegetation consists of yellow waterlily (southwest corner), reed canary grass (scattered stands around the lake), cattails (north shoreline) and leafy bulrush (north shoreline). Hardstem bulrush stands were not observed during 2023 in Bass Lake. Moderate stands of bulrush were present along the east and southeast near shore areas in 2013 and the east shore in 2018. Hardstem bulrush plants were transplanted into Bass Lake along the northeast and southwest corners of the lake in June of 1994. Shoalwater substrates consist mostly of sand, gravel, rubble and silt. A severe winterkill occurred during the 1996-97 winter due in part to heavy snow accumulations. Dissolved oxygen levels were adequate (> 6 ppm) during heavy snow accumulations of February/March 2019. Although winterkill (significant/partial) occurred in several area lakes (Point, Swenson, School Grove, Lady Slipper and Elizabeth) for the 2022-23 winter due to high snowfall accumulations, none occurred in Bass Lake. Anglers target primarily Northern Pike, Bluegill, Black Crappie and Largemouth Bass in Bass Lake. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass numbers (pre and post spawn) were abundant (148.00 fish/hour) in the 2023 early June night electrofishing survey. Abundant numbers and similar sizes were also captured (180.00 fish/hour) in the 2018 mid-June night electrofishing survey. The Largemouth Bass average size was moderate (11.56 inches and 1.17 pounds) in the 2023 early June electrofishing survey. The 2023 catch rate of preferred size (15.00 inches plus) largemouth bass was high (45.00 fish/hour). There were also abundant numbers of small (<8.00 inches) Largemouth Bass present in the 2023 early June electrofishing survey. Post spawn electrofishing surveys generally catch greater numbers of smaller or younger Largemouth bass than previous electrofishing surveys conducting during the spawning season. Largemouth Bass also tend to be found near docks, downed trees in the water or within submergent vegetation adjacent to deep water during post spawn conditions versus shallow spawning bay areas often containing bulrush. Largemouth Bass adults were stocked (22 fish) in Bass Lake during the spring of 1997 following the 1996-97 winterkill. One Smallmouth Bass was captured in the 1994 survey, but no Smallmouth Bass have been captured in other surveys since 1994. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie abundance was low in 2023 (2.00 fish/trapnet). The Black Crappie historical average catch rate is 7.12 fish/trapnet. Low Black Crappie numbers were caught in 2018 survey (1.17 fish/trapnet). Abundant Black Crappie numbers (13.67 fish/trapnet, 8.72 inches) were captured in the 2013 survey. The Black Crappie average size was small (0.25 pounds and 7.64 inches) in the 2023 trapnets. The Black Crappie historical average weight and length are 0.28 pounds 7.78 inches respectively from trapnets. The 2023 Black Crappie catch rate of quality size (8.00 inches plus) was low (0.33 fish/trapnet). Black Crappie adults were stocked into Bass during the spring of 1997 (121 fish) and 2000 (532 fish). <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike were absent in 2018 and 2023 surveys. Northern Pike abundance was moderate in the 2013 survey (4.00 fish/gillnet, 27.03 inches). The northern pike historical average catch rate is 4.71 fish/gillnet. Northern Pike adults (48 fish) were stocked into Bass Lake during 1998. Although Northern Pike numbers are low, it is unlikely that Northern Pike have been totally absent from Bass Lake. Northern Pike possession limit regulations for Bass in the North-central Zone are as follows: anglers can keep 10 Northern Pike, but not more than two pike longer than 26.0 inches; and all from 22.0 to 26.0 inches must be released. Northern Pike taken by spearing follow the same rules except one pike may be between 22.0 and 26.0 inches or two larger than 26.0 inches. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch abundance was low (5.00 fish/gillnet, 0.83 fish/trapnet) in the 2023 survey. Yellow Perch were absent in 2018 and 2013 surveys. The Yellow Perch historical average catch rate is 19.41 fish/gillnet. The Yellow Perch average size was small (0.13 pounds and 6.58 inches) from all gears combined. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye were absent in the 2023 survey. Walleye numbers were low (2.00 fish/gillnet and 0.17 fish/trapnet) in 2018. Walleye were absent in 2013 gillnet and trapnets. The Walleye historical catch rate is 1.32 fish/gillnet. The Walleye average size was 4.09 pounds in 2018 gillnets. The Walleye historical average weight is 2.64 pounds from gillnets. Walleye are not currently stocked in Bass.  <br> \n <br> \nBluegill abundance was low (19.67 fish/trapnet) in 2023 compared to the historical average catch rate (35.95 fish/trapnet). The 2023 Bluegill average size was moderate (0.22 pounds and 6.37 inches) from trapnets. The Bluegill historical average weight is 0.19 pounds from trapnets. The 2023 Bluegill catch rate of quality size (6.00 inches plus) was moderate (11.33 fish/trapnet). The 2023 Bluegill catch rate of preferred size (8.00 inches plus) was low (1.67 fish/trapnet). Bluegill growth rates were excellent for ages 1-8. The 2020 and 2019 year classes comprised 64% and 26% respectively of the 2023 total Bluegill catch. Bluegill adults (2,415 fish) were stocked into Bass Lake during the spring of 1997 following the 1996-97 winterkill.  <br> \n <br> \nA total of three Bluegill (8.40 inches average) were captured in the two large frame trapnets. Low catchability of fish was probably due to fish swimming over the large frame net/lead because of the steep drop off. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Bullhead abundance was low (0.17 fish/trapnet) in the 2023 and 2013 surveys. Black Bullhead were absent in the 2018 survey. Yellow Bullhead abundance was also low (0.50 fish/trapnet) in the 2023 survey. Common Carp were absent in the 2023 survey. Common Carp abundance was high (5.00 fish/gillnet and 1.17 fish/trapnet) in 2018. The Common Carp average size was small (2.40 pounds) in the 2018 trapnets. No Common Carp were captured in the 2013 survey nets. The historical average catch rates are 12.82 Black Bullhead/trapnet, 1.27 Yellow Bullhead/trapnet and 0.97 Common Carp/gillnet.  <br> \n <br> \nCurrent fish management activities on Bass Lake include monitoring the fish population on a periodic basis, periodic winter oxygen testing, participating in local watershed initiatives, protecting native aquatic vegetation through the permit process, preventing and educating about the spread of invasive species, and stocking various fish species as warranted. The Bass Lake fishery will be surveyed in 2028 for all fish species. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A resurvey of Bass Lake was conducted in early July of 2013. Bass is a small (52 acres) and moderately productive lake located in Kandiyohi County. The maximum depth is 31 feet. A township public access with limited parking and turn around is located along the north shore. Residential development (11 homes) has occurred primarily along the north and west shoreline areas. Hardwoods dominate the east and south shorelines. Agricultural row crop drainage into the lake occurs via 3 inlets/tiles located along the west and north shores. Water clarity was excellent (secchi=17.5 feet) and the total phosphorus level relatively low (0.026 ppm) on June 10, 2013. Dissolved oxygen was low (< 1 ppm) in water depths greater than 18 feet during a 2013 mid-summer profile. Algae blooms often occur during the late summer months on Bass. A moderate algae bloom was present during the 2013 survey. Submergent vegetation densities (pondweed species) have been historically variable in the lake. The most frequently occurring submergent vegetation species during 2013 included water moss, filamentous algae, clasping-leaf pondweed and sago pondweed. Emergent vegetation consists of yellow waterlily (southwest corner), reed canary grass (scattered stands around the lake), cattails (north and east shoreline) and hardstem bulrush (east shoreline). Hardstem bulrush plants were transplanted into Bass Lake along the northeast and southwest corners of the lake in June of 1994. Shoalwater substrates consist mostly of sand, gravel and silt. A severe winterkill occurred during the 1996-97 winter due in part to heavy snow accumulations. Anglers target primarily northern pike, bluegill, black crappie and largemouth bass in Bass Lake. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass numbers were abundant (74.77 fish/hour) in the 2013 spring electrofishing survey and above the Bass Lake historical average (53.33 fish/hour). The 2013 largemouth bass average size was moderate (0.99 pounds and 11.09 inches) from spring electrofishing. The Bass Lake historical average weight and length are 1.54 pounds and 12.68 inches. The 2013 catch rate of larger (>15 inches) largemouth bass was moderate (6.46 fish/hour). Largemouth bass growth rates were within the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-8. The 2010 year class comprised 50% of the 2013 total largemouth bass spring electrofishing catch. Largemouth bass adults were stocked (22 fish) in Bass Lake during the spring of 1997 following the 1996-97 winterkill.  <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie numbers were moderately abundant in 2013 (13.67 fish/trapnet) compared to the normal range of similar lakes and the Bass Lake historical average (8.35 fish/trapnet). The 2013 black crappie average size was moderate (0.36 pounds and 8.72 inches) from trapnets. The black crappie historical average weight and length are 0.24 pounds 7.29 inches respectively from trapnets. The 2013 catch rate of moderate sized (>8 inches) black crappie was excellent (13.33 fish/trapnet).  Black crappie growth rates were above the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 2-5. The 2010 black crappie year class comprised 96% of the 2013 black crappie catch. Black crappie adults were stocked into Bass during the spring of 1997 (121 fish) and 2000 (532 fish) following the 1996-97 winterkill. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike numbers were moderate in 2013 (4.00 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range of similar lakes and the Bass Lake historical average (5.76 fish/gillnet). The 2013 northern pike average size was moderately large (4.60 pounds and 27.03 inches) from the gillnet. The northern pike historical average weight is 3.25 pounds from gillnets. The 2013 catch rate of larger (>28 inches) northern pike was high (2.00 fish/gillnet). Northern pike growth rates were above the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 2-5. Approximately 40% of the northern pike captured in the 2013 gillnet were from the 2008 year class. Northern pike adults (48 fish) were stocked into Bass Lake during 1998. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch were absent in 2013 gillnet and trapnets. The yellow perch historical average catch rate is 23.17 fish/gillnet. Walleye were also absent in 2013 gillnet and trapnets. The walleye historical catch rate is 1.56 fish/gillnet. The walleye historical average weight is 2.35 pounds from gillnets.  <br> \n <br> \nBluegill numbers were abundant (70.00 fish/trapnet) and the average size was large (0.31 pounds and 7.28 inches) in 2013.  The bluegill historical average catch rate is 38.66 fish/trapnet. The bluegill historical average weight is 0.17 pounds from trapnets. The 2013 catch rate of moderate sized (>6 inches) bluegill was high (68.50 fish/trapnet). The 2013 catch rate of larger (> 8 inches) bluegill was also high (9.83 fish/trapnet). Bluegill growth rates were above the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-8. The 2010 year class comprised 86% of the 2013 total bluegill catch. Bluegill adults (2,415 fish) were stocked into Bass Lake during the spring of 1997 following the 1996-97 winterkill. <br> \n <br> \nBlack bullhead numbers were low in 2013 (0.17 fish/trapnet). Black bullhead were absent from the 2013 gillnet. Yellow bullhead numbers were also low in the 2013 trapnets (0.50 fish/trapnet). There were no carp captured in the 2013 survey nets. The historical average catch rates are 15.65 black bullhead/trapnet, 1.44 yellow bullhead/trapnet and 0.63 carp/gillnet.  <br> \n <br> \nCurrent fish management activities on Bass Lake include monitoring the fish population on a periodic basis, periodic winter oxygen testing, participating in local watershed initiatives, protecting native aquatic vegetation through the permit process, preventing and educating about the spread of invasive species, and stocking various fish species as warranted. The Bass Lake fishery will be resurveyed in the 2018 for all fish species. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Bass is a small lake (52 acres) with a maximum depth of 31 feet. Water clarity is fairto poor. Algae blooms are common. Reported winterkills have been rare (1944-45). Adequatesummer dissolved oxygen levels for fish were in water depths between 1-14 feet. Aquaticvegetation species and densities were rare (water moss, sago pondweed, bushy pondweed).Emergent vegetation was limited to yellow waterlily (SW and SE shores), reed canary grass (SWshore), and a small stand of hardstem bulrush (SE shore). Nutrient levels were reportedmoderate in 1989. Adjacent agricultural row crops are the primary source of nutrient runoff.There are three inlets (southwest, west, and north shores) and an outlet (southeast shore)that drains into Tait's Lake, Diamond Lake Northern Pike Spawning Area, and Diamond Lake.Fish movement into Bass Lake from Diamond is possible during high water. This small watershedis characterized by mixed hardwoods and agricultural row crops on gently rolling glacialtill. The shoreline is characterized by mixed hardwoods and red cedar on steep slopes.Residential development is limited to the north and west shores. Several new homes have beenbuilt and lots purchased along the west shore recently. A public township access (gravel) islocated along the north shore, however, parking and turn around is limited. Historically,fishing pressure has been light with most people seeking largemouth bass, bluegill, andnorthern pike. Bass was known as an excellent largemouth bass lake prior to the 1944-45winterkill. Past management activities included winter rescue northern pike stocking duringthe 1970-80's, largemouth bass fingerling stocking during the late 1970's, removal ofbullhead and carp during the 1950's, lake surveys/population assessments of fish population,and habitat work (transplanting bulrush) in 1994.     Black crappie abundance in 1994 (1.3 fish/trapnet) was below the normal range (1.8 -18.1 fish/trapnet) and below the historical average (9.1 fish/trapnet). The 1994 average size(5.4 inches) was below the historical average (6.2 inches). The highest abundance rating andaverage size of black crappie surveyed occurred in 1984 (29.4 fish/trapnet, average size=8.4inches). Black crappie population densities have been low the last several years throughoutKandiyohi County.     Bluegill abundance in 1994 (65.5 fish/trapnet) was above the normal range (6.5 - 59.6fish/trapnet) for similar lakes and above the historical average (39.9 fish/trapnet).Although, it was similar to the two previous surveys conducted (1989=60.2 fish/trapnet,1984=70.0 fish/trapnet), the average size in 1994 (4.4 inches) was below the historicalaverage (5.4 inches). Growth rates appear below average compared to other local lakes. About83% of the bluegill caught were from the 1991 year class. No fish over 4 years of age orolder were captured. Quality habitat (hardstem bulrush) for bluegill is lacking in Bass Lake.     Largemouth bass catch rate in the 1994 spring night electrofishing survey was low (15.7fish/hour). The average size was 13.5 inches and 1.5 lbs. About 59% of the largemouth basscaptured were between 14-15 inches. Growth rates appear good.       Northern pike abundance in 1994 (8.0 fish/gillnet) was the highest recorded value(historical average=2.9 fish/gillnet) and above the normal range (2.5 - 7.9 fish/gillnet) forsimilar lakes. The 1994 average size (22.4 inches) was slightly below the weighted historicalaverage (23.0 inches). Growth rates appear good. Spawning areas are probably limited to theinlet ditch along the southwest side. However, there may be some movement of northern pike(adults or fingerlings) into Bass Lake from the Diamond Lake Northern Pike Spawning Area andTait's Lake.     Yellow perch abundance in 1994 (1.0 fish/gillnet) was below the normal range (1.5 - 12.8fish/gillnet) for similar lakes and below the historical average (27.9 fish/gillnet). Yellowperch gillnet catch rates have varied greatly (1989=0.0 fish/gillnet, 1984=53.5 fish/gillnet,1979=4.7 fish/gillnet, 1950=80.3 fish/gillnet).     Walleye abundance in 1994 (3.0 fish/gillnet) was within the normal range (0.5 - 3.5fish/gillnet) for similar lakes. Walleye have been caught in Bass Lake during only one othersurvey (1989=0.5 fish/gillnet). Bass Lake has only been stocked once with walleye (22 adultsin 1985). Although, there may be some illegal fish stocking taking place as indicated by thecapture of a 3.3 lb smallmouth bass in the trapnets during 1994. Smallmouth bass are notpresent in Diamond, however they are present in nearby Green Lake.     Priority management for Bass should include expanding important largemouth bass,bluegill, and black crappie habitat (transplanting hardstem bulrush). Another priority shouldinclude increasing water clarity by reducing agricultural nutrient runoff (phosphorous) whichcontributes to algae blooms. This can be accomplished by encouraging local farmers to useconservation farming techniques (minimum till, ridge till, no till, etc.) that leave at least30% crop residue which reduces silt and nutrient runoff significantly. In addition,encouraging wetland restoration upstream of the inlets would also aide in reducing nutrientand silt runoff. Also, lake resident volunteers (Citizens Lake Monitoring Program) are neededto take secchi readings to provide better information about the water clarity of Bass Lake.Other management activities include the reestablishment of the black crappie populationthrough brood stocking as needed and when fish are available.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Bass is a small (52 acres) and moderately deep (31 feet maximum) lake located inKandiyohi County. The public access is located on the north side, but parking and launchingspace is limited. The surrounding watershed is dominated by agricultural land. The shorelinecharacteristics are about 50% undeveloped hardwood stands and 45% residential homes\\cabins.Local residents have perceived a decline of Bass Lake water clarity and quality during recentyears. Water clarity was good during June of 1999 (8 - 8.5 feet). Total phosphorus levelswere moderate (0.041 ppm) in Bass on June 8, 1999. Non point runoff of nutrients (phosphorus,nitrogen) from agricultural crops enters Bass Lake via three intermittent tile/ditch inlets.Submergent vegetation is moderately dense within Bass Lake. Filamentous algae and water mosspresent in Bass Lake are the least desirable submergent vegetation species in terms of fishhabitat and aesthetics. Emergent vegetation is rare in Bass. A partial winterkill occurredon Bass Lake during the 1996-97 winter. Yellow perch was the only gamefish species withmoderate/abundant numbers present in the lake immediately after the winterkill. Adultgamefish (bluegill, largemouth bass, black crappie, and northern pike) were restocked in 1997and 1998 following the winterkill. Spawning habitat is good for largemouth bass, bluegill andyellow perch in Bass Lake. The primary gamefish species that anglers have sought in Bassinclude largemouth bass, bluegill, black crappie, and northern pike.     Abundant numbers of moderate sized largemouth bass (67.66 fish/hour, 0.97 lbs averagesize) were captured in the 1999 spring electrofishing survey. The 1997 year class comprised77% of the total spring electrofishing largemouth bass catch. The 1997 largemouth bassstocking was successful in producing a good natural year class in 1997. Moderate northernpike numbers (3.50 fish/gillnet) were present in the 1999 summer gillnet sets. The 1999northern pike catch rate was similar to the historical average (3.97 fish/gillnet). Thenorthern pike average size was moderately large (25.66 inches, 4.02 lbs.) in 1999. The 1995year class comprised 57% of the total northern pike catch in the 1999 survey. The 1995 yearclass was probably from a 1998 stocking of adult northern pike into Bass. Bluegill numberswere moderately abundant (31.67 fish/trapnet) in 1999, but similar to the historical average(38.50 fish/trapnet). The bluegill average size was small (4.51 inches, 0.12 lbs.) in 1999,but the fish were generally young (82% of the catch less than 3 years old). Bluegill growthrates generally appeared above or within the normal ranges for similar lakes. Bluegillnatural reproduction was good (52.00 young of year fish/seine haul, 1.35 inches average size)as documented by the 1999 August shoreline seine hauls. Moderate numbers of black crappie(6.17 fish/trapnet) were present in 1999. The 1999 black crappie average size was small (6.52inches), but indicative for their respective average age. The 1997 black crappie year classcomprised 70% of the total black crappie catch in 1999. It appears that the 1997 spring broodstocking of black crappie was successful in producing a good year class in 1997. Moderatesized yellow perch (65.00 fish/gillnet, 6.85 inches average size). Black bullhead numbers(31.50 fish/gillnet) in 1999 were abundant compared to the historical average (14.14fish/gillnet). The 1999 black bullhead average size was 8.13 inches (gillnets). Walleyenumbers (2.00 fish/gillnet) were low in Bass. Although walleye were not stocked into Bassafter the winterkill by the DNR, there were reports of local residents illegally stockingadult fish into Bass Lake after the winterkill. There are no plans on future walleyestockings in Bass because walleye may have a detrimental effect on both black crappie numbersby potential competition and the yellow perch forage base by predation in conjunction withnorthern pike.     It appears that the gamefish populations in Bass Lake have recovered from the 1996-97winterkill. There appears to be adequate natural reproduction for bluegill, largemouth bass,black crappie, and yellow perch. A strong year class (1997) of black crappie is presentwithin Bass. Adequate northern pike numbers are present, but limited northern pike broodstocking may be necessary in the future on Bass due to poor spawning areas and potentialharvest vulnerability in a small lake. Potential slow bluegill growth is a concern for BassLake. Prior to the 1996-97 winterkill, bluegill growth rates were below average in Bass Lake.Removal of small bluegill may be an option to increase growth rates in Bass Lake. Futurewinterkills on Bass Lake are possible, but the frequency of occurrence is probably rare basedon the historical record. If winterkill does occur again, then Bass Lake will be restockedwith adult brood fish. The DNR Spicer Fisheries Office goal for Bass Lake is to provide alargemouth bass/panfish/northern pike fishery for both moderate numbers and sizes of fish.Maintaining good water quality is the one greatest issues facing Bass Lake. Privatelandowners (agricultural and lake residential) need to be encouraged to practice bestmanagement practices (use of only low/no phosphorus fertilizers, conservation tillage,planting buffer strips, proper fertilizer/manure application, updating old septic systems,etc.) within the immediate lake watershed in order to reduce the inflow of excessivenutrients into Bass Lake.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A fish population assessment of Bass Lake was conducted in July of 2008. Bass is a small (52 acres) and moderately productive lake located in Kandiyohi County. The maximum depth is 31 feet. Residential development has occurred primarily along the north and west shoreline areas. Hardwoods dominate the east and south shorelines. Agricultural row crop drainage into the lake occurs via several inlets/tiles located along the west shore. Water levels were normal to high in 2008. A partial winterkill (primarily gamefish) occurred during the 1996-97 winter. Water levels were down 2-3 feet in 2003 due to drought conditions and the partial collapse and erosion of a crude (rock/log) private outlet structure. The outlet structure was repaired in 2006 by SWCD, county, and state. The outlet connects to Tait's Lake and eventually to Diamond Lake via the northern pike spawning area. Fish movement upstream into Bass Lake has occurred during high water events, especially during spring runoff. A township public access with limited parking and turn around is located along the north shore. Emergent vegetation (bulrush) is currently present along the east shoreline. Hardstem bulrush plants were transplanted into Bass Lake along the northeast and southwest corners of the lake in June of 1994. Water clarity was fair to poor (3.0 feet) in 2008. Algae blooms can occur during the late summer months. Moderate submergent vegetation was present in 2008. Submergent vegetation densities (pondweed species) have been historically variable in the lake. Dissolved oxygen was low (<0.6 ppm) in water depths greater than 18 feet during a 2008 mid summer profile. Bass Lake is managed primarily for largemouth bass and secondarily for northern pike, bluegill, and black crappie. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass numbers were moderate (50.00 fish/hour) in the 2008 spring electrofishing survey compared to the normal range (25th=14.85, 50th=33.05, 75th=70.98 fish/hour) for Spicer Area lakes and similar to the Bass Lake historical average (47.97 fish/hour). The 2008 largemouth bass average size was large (2.39 pounds and 14.5 inches) from spring electrofishing. The catch rate of preferred size (15.00 inches) and larger largemouth bass was high (24.29 fish/hour) in 2008. Largemouth bass growth rates in Bass Lake were near the high end or above the Spicer Area normal range for ages 1-8. The 2004 year class comprised 29% of the 2008 total largemouth bass spring electrofishing catch. Largemouth bass adults were stocked (22 fish) in Bass Lake during the spring of 1997 following the 1996-97 winterkill. One smallmouth bass (3.78 fish/hour, 15.98 inches) was captured in the 2008 spring electrofishing survey. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie numbers were abundant in 2008 (9.60 fish/trapnet) compared to the Bass Lake normal range (25th=1.00, 50th=3.98, 75th=10.50 fish/trapnet). There were also abundant numbers of small black crappie captured in the 2008 gillnets (20.00 fish/gillnet, 0.06 pounds average weight). The 2008 black crappie average size was moderate (0.36 pounds and 8.44 inches) from trapnets. The black crappie historical average weight is 0.22 pounds from trapnets. The catch rate of quality size (8.00 inches) and larger black crappie was high to moderate (6.60 fish/trapnet) in 2008. Black crappie growth rates were generally within or above the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-4. The 2005 black crappie year class comprised 36% of the 2008 black crappie catch. Black crappie adults were stocked into Bass during the spring of 1997 (121 fish) and 2000 (532 fish) following the 1996-97 winterkill. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike numbers were abundant in 2008 (10.00 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal ranges for both Bass Lake (25th=2.96, 50th=5.50, 75th=8.50 fish/gillnet) and similar lakes. The northern pike historical average catch rate is 5.98 fish/gillnet. The 2008 northern pike average size was moderate (2.90 pounds and 22.41 inches) from gillnets. The northern pike historical average weight is 3.06 pounds from gillnets. The 2008 catch rate of quality size (21.00 inches) and larger northern pike was high (5.00 fish/gillnet). Northern pike growth rates were within or above the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-5. Approximately 36% of the northern pike captured in the 2008 gillnets were from the 2006 year class. Northern pike adults (48 fish) were stocked into Bass Lake during 1998. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch numbers were moderate in 2008 (3.00 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal ranges for Bass Lake (25th=1.00, 50th=3.83, 75th=56.38 fish/gillnet) and similar lakes. The yellow perch historical average catch rate is 26.06 fish/gillnet. The 2008 yellow perch average length was moderate (6.58 inches) from gillnets and trapnets combined.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye numbers were low in 2008 (1.00 fish/gillnet), but within the normal ranges for Bass Lake (25th=0.00, 50th=0.75, 75th=2.25 fish/gillnet) and similar lakes. The walleye historical catch rate is 1.56 fish/gillnet. The 2008 walleye average size was large (3.20 pounds and 20.08 inches) from gillnets. The walleye historical average weight is 2.35 pounds from gillnets.  <br> \n <br> \nBluegill numbers were moderate in 2008 (28.00 fish/trapnet) compared to the normal ranges for Bass Lake (25th=15.15, 50th=29.83, 75th=61.53 fish/trapnet) and similar lakes. The bluegill historical average catch rate is 34.75 fish/trapnet. The 2008 bluegill average size was small (0.07 pounds and 4.33 inches) from trapnets. The bluegill historical average weight is 0.15 pounds from trapnets. The catch rate of quality size (6.00 inches) and larger bluegill was low (2.40 fish/trapnet) in 2008. Bluegill growth rates were within or above the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-4. The 2006 year class comprised 80% of the 2008 total bluegill catch. Bluegill adults (2,415 fish) were stocked into Bass Lake during the spring of 1997 following the 1996-97 winterkill. <br> \n <br> \nBlack bullhead numbers were low to moderate in 2008 (12.00 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal ranges for Bass Lake (25th=1.50, 50th=17.67, 75th=28.88 fish/gillnet) and similar lakes. The 2008 trapnet black bullhead catch was moderate (10.00 fish/trapnet). The 2008 black bullhead average size was large (0.65 pounds and 10.46 inches) from gillnets. The 2008 black bullhead average weight and length were 0.61 pounds and 10.31 inches respectively from trapnets. The black bullhead historical average weights are 0.46 and 0.45 pounds from gillnets and trapnets respectively. <br> \n <br> \nThere were no carp or white sucker captured in the 2008 survey nets. The historical average catch rates were 0.71 carp/gillnet and 2.31 white sucker/gillnet.  <br> \n <br> \nCurrent fish management activities on Bass Lake include monitoring the fish population on a periodic basis, periodic winter oxygen testing, protecting aquatic vegetation through the permit process, and stocking various fish species as warranted. The Bass Lake fishery will be resurveyed in the 2013 spring and summer for all fish species.  <br> \n</p>",
