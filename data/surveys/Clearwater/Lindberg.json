                "narrative": "<p>Lindberg Lake is a 95-acre lake located four miles southeast of the city of Clearbrook in Clearwater County.  There is a county-owned public water access with an unimproved boat ramp and parking for 5 trucks/trailers located on the east shore of the lake.  The ramp is located in a very shallow bay and is not suitable for larger boats.  Lindberg Lake is managed primarily for Walleye, Bluegill, and Black Crappie.  <br> \n <br> \nLindberg Lake is stocked with Walleye fingerlings.  The 2017 Walleye catch rate of 4.5 fish/gill net was up considerably from 1 fish/gill net in the most recent survey (2010) and above the range found in similar lakes (0.50 to 3.83 fish/gill net), indicating that recent fingerling stockings have been successful.  Walleye captured in 2017 ranged from 9.06 inches to 25.0 inches with an average size of 15.38 inches in length and 1.54 lbs/fish.   <br> \n <br> \nThe 2017 Bluegill catch rate (7.89 fish/trap net) was below the median catch rate for similar lakes (13.83 fish/trap net).  Bluegill had an average length of 5.34 inches, and Bluegill up to 8.94 inches in length were captured in the survey.  Black Crappie were also captured in low numbers (0.44 fish/trap net)   although the majority of Black Crappie exceeded 10 inches in length, with fish up to 11.54 inches in length captured in the survey.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike are abundant in Lindberg Lake.  The 2017 catch rate of 10.0 fish/gill net was above the range found in similar lakes (2.67 to 9.33 fish/gill net).  Abundance in this range would be an excellent place to utilize the expanded 10 fish bag limit for Northern Pike under 22 inches (new in 2018). Northern Pike up to 35.83 inches in length were captured with an average size of 21.78 inches and 2.58 lbs/fish.  Twenty five percent of Northern Pike captured exceeded 24 inches in length which compares favorably with many pike populations in the Bemidji area.   <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass were assessed using night electrofishing.  Ten bass were captured, measured, and released in about 40 minutes of effort.  Lengths ranged from 5.6 to 16.9 inches with a mean of 10.5 inches.  This was the first time an electrofishing assessment targeting bass was conducted on Lindberg Lake.   <br> \nOther species of fish captured in the 2017 survey were Yellow Perch, Brown Bullhead and Pumpkinseed. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lindberg lake is a small landlocked lake located about 6 miles south and west of Clearbrook, Mn.  The lake watershed is primarily agriculture with four farms encompassing the entire lake shore.  It is in lake class 33, a group of small shallow lakes with irregular shorelines.  During severe winters the lake can experience partial to severe winter kills.  About one-third of the lake is less than five feet deep.  The public access is earthen and may not be accessible to large boats.  Primary fish species present are northern pike, bluegill, black crappie, walleye, and yellow perch.     Northern pike are abundant but tend to be small with only about 20% of the population greater than 24 inches in length.  About one-third of the pike examined had neascus (black spot), a common parasite of fish.  These small parasites may be unsightly but they are not harmful to humans.     Walleye are managed by stocking fry every third year. It appears that natural reproduction does not contribute to the population.  The walleye population fluctuates depending on the variable success of fry stockings.  Currently the population is low, reflecting poor survival of recent stockings.  Some quality size fish are available, though they are not common.     The bluegill population fluctuates considerably and currently has an  abundance of quality fish available.  About 94% of the bluegill measured were 8.5-10 inches long and seven to ten years old.  The lack of young fish indicates that there may be a decline coming when the large fish are harvested or lost to natural mortality.  In time they should be replaced as conditions are favorable for another strong year class.     Black crappie have apparently not been able to produce a good year class since 1994.  The population is low but a few quality fish are present.     Yellow perch are abundant, and with many of them between nine and ten inches long they are acceptable to anglers.  Some perch have neascus and/or yellow grubs, another parasite of fish that is not harmful to humans.     Other fish species known to be present include brown bullheads and pumpkinseed sunfish.     Quality panfish such as those found in this lake can only be maintained through limiting harvest or catch and release.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lindberg Lake is a 92-acre lake located near the town of Clearbrook in Clearwater County.  A public water access with an earthen ramp and parking for about 4 trucks/trailers is located on the east shore of the lake.  Lindberg Lake is in lake class 33.  Other class 33 lakes in the Bemidji area include Carr, Upper Lindgren, and Glanders Lake.  Lindberg is more reminiscent of a prairie lake than a lake in the north woods.  Bluegill are the primary species managed, while black crappie and walleye are managed as secondary species.  Fishing pressure on Lindberg Lake is thought to be low.   <br> \nBluegill are the most sought after species of fish in Lindberg Lake.  The 2010 population assessment showed a good population, with fish up to 9.9 inches in length present, and a large proportion of the population between 5.5 and 7.5 inches in length.  These medium-size fish should grow to a size preferred by anglers in the next few years and provide some good fishing.  Black crappie are present in the lake.  Four age classes were identified in the sample.  The largest black crappie captured was 10.0 inches in length.  Walleye are also present in Lindberg Lake; however, 2010 catch rates were at an all-time low.  Average size was 2.5 pounds (19.5 inches in length).  The northern pike population has shown improvement since the 2005 assessment.  Total numbers of pike captured were down, but the size structure of the population has moved toward larger fish.  Like many lakes in the state, Lindberg has been dominated by high numbers of small northern pike, which can be a nuisance to anglers and problematic from a fisheries management standpoint.  Since 2005, the average size of northern pike has nearly doubled to 3.0 pounds/fish, which is good news for anglers.  Forty seven percent of northern pike captured were greater than 24.0 inches in length, and the largest pike sampled was 32.1 inches in length.    <br> \n</p>",
