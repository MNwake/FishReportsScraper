                "narrative": "<p>Assessment results suggest that in 2008 Flour Lake supported a modest walleye population consisting mainly of small, young fish, probably from recent fingerling stocking.  There was apparently little natural reproduction.  Walleye growth had been slower than average, compared to similar lakes in the area, probably due to low yellow perch abundance and competition created by the high walleye stocking rate used in this lake. <br> \n <br> \nLake trout abundance was also low in 2008, and most of the fish taken had been stocked as yearlings in the spring of 2008.  Long-term survival of stocked lake trout has been poor in this lake, and to date there is no evidence of natural reproduction.  The lake does have the potential to produce some good-sized fish, due to the presence of a fairly dense northern cisco population. <br> \n <br> \nThe smallmouth bass catch was low in 2008, but gill net catches often do not provide a good indication of real smallmouth bass abundance.  The lake supported a high-quality population; all of the fish taken were over 12 inches in length.  Smallmouth bass in Flour Lake are managed under a special regulation - a 12-inch maximum size limit (all fish 12 inches or larger must be released, except that one fish over 20 inches may be taken). <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike have rarely been found in Flour Lake.  One was taken in 2008, a 26.9-inch fish weighing 5.2 lb.  Flour Lake lacks the spawning habitat required to produce a larger northern pike population. <br> \n <br> \nAlthough northern cisco were abundant and large, they were all infested with Triaenophorus, a tapeworm that lodges in the flesh of the fish.  Although the organism cannot infest humans, it is unpleasant to deal with in fillets, and consumption of infested fish is not recommended. <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

THE RELATIVE CONTRIBUTIONS OF STOCKING AND NATURAL REPRODUCTION TO THE WAE POPULATION WERE UNCLEAR, SINCE THERE WAS ONLY ONE UNSTOCKED YEAR CLASS COVERED IN THIS ASSESSMENT; HOWEVER, THERE WAS SOME EVIDENCE TO SUGGEST THAT WAE FINGERLING STOCKING WAS IMPORTANT TO THE POPULATION.  NO FISH WERE COLLECTED FROM THE UNSTOCKED YEAR CLASS (1989), WHILE THE STRONGEST YEAR CLASSES OCCURRED IN YEARS WHEN THERE WAS FINGERLING STOCKING (1990 AND 1988).  SMB WERE ABUNDANT BUT SMALL, WITH MOST FISH RANGING FROM 5 TO 11 IN.  SEVERAL YEAR CLASSES WERE REPRESENTED, WITH THE STRONGEST BEING 1988 AND 1987.  SMB GROWTH WAS SOME WHAT SLOWER THAN AVERAGE FOR COOK COUNTY, WITH AGE IV FISH AVERAGING 7.8 IN AT LAST ANNULUS FORMATION, COMPARED TO A COUNTY AVERAGE OF 9.1 IN. YEP ABUNDANCE WAS NOT UNUSUALLY LOW FOR LAKES OF THIS CLASS, BUT THEIR AVAILABILITY AS FORAGE APPEARED TO BE LIMITED.  NOP ABUNDANCE WAS LOW, BUT FISH AS LARGE AS 35 IN WERE COLLECTED. TLC WERE ABUNDANT, WITH MOST FISH COLLECTED RANGING FROM 13 TO 16 IN.  FROM THE LENGTH FREQUENCY DISTRIBUTION IT APPEARED THAT AT LEAST THREE TLC YEAR CLASSES WERE REPRESENTED IN THE SAMPLE.  FROM THE TEMPERATURE-OXYGEN PROFILE OBTAINED IN THIS ASSESSMENT, IT APPEARED THAT FLOUR LAKE COULD EASILY SUPPORT A LAT POPULATION. TEMPERATURES BELOW 55F, AND DISSOLVED OXYGEN ABOVE 5 PPM WERE FOUND ACROSS A 48 FT VERTICAL WATER COLUMN.</p>",

The average size of walleye was unusually large for the lake and the area.  Ages of walleye corresponded to years in which walleye had been stocked, suggesting that these walleye had been stocked.Smallmouth bass abundance appeared to be about average for the lake, lake class, and this type of assessment.  Average size of smallmouth bass was somewhat small, and growth had been slow.The lake trout catch was within the usual range for this lake and similar assessments in area lakes.  All lake trout had been stocked.Cisco abundance was typical for the lake, and above average for the area.  The catch was composed entirely of adults, so average size of cisco was larger than usual.Yellow perch numbers were low, and average size was small.  Green sunfish appeared to be somewhat more abundant than yellow perch, but were also small.</p>",

Based on the profile, the top of the thermocline (i.e., the location in the water column with the sharpest transition from warm to cold water) occurred at approximately 13 feet. Dissolved oxygen decreased to below 3.0 mg/L at 76.7 feet, which was below the thermocline, at the time of sampling. The temperature at which dissolved oxygen decreased to below 3.0 mg/L (i.e., TDO3, a single variable to characterize oxythermal habitat) was 6.3?C (43.3?F). <br> \n <br> \nTDO3 values cooler than 8.8?C for Lake Trout or 21.5?C for Cisco indicate that oxythermal conditions are favorable for these species. Dissolved oxygen concentrations below the thermocline indicate that suitable oxythermal habitat for these species was available across a range of depths at the time of sampling. Data collected in 1956-1994 also indicate suitable oxythermal habitat in most years, with the least favorable conditions recorded in 1956. When adequate oxythermal habitat is available, Lake Trout or Cisco are not squeezed into unfavorable, warmer water conditions and therefore do not experience higher levels of stress. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Flour Lake is currently managed for Walleye, Lake Trout and Smallmouth Bass (2014 Lake Management Plan).  Walleye have been regularly stocked in this lake since the 1930s, and since 2009 Walleye fingerlings have been stocked at an elevated rate of 1.0 pounds/littoral acre/year.   The long range goal for Walleye in Flour Lake is a population with a minimum combined catch in deep and shallow gill net sets of 3.0 fish/set.   The Smallmouth Bass population in this lake is managed under a special regulation:  all fish 12-inches or larger must be released, except that one fish over 20 inches may be kept.  Lake Trout have been stocked in Flour Lake since 1993 in an attempt to reintroduce the species (once native to this lake) and to support a Lake Trout fishery.  This survey was scheduled as part of an effort to evaluate Walleye stocking in this lake and to determine whether Lake Trout stocking had been effective, and if Lake Trout were reproducing. <br> \n <br> \nThe Walleye catch goal for this lake has not been met since 1997, and results of the 2016 assessment were no exception.  The combined catch in deep and shallow gill net sets (0.92 fish/set) fell well short of the goal, and was one of the lower catches seen in this lake historically.  Only five year classes were represented in the catch, and only the stocked 2012 year class was even moderately strong.  Several recent year classes, stocked and unstocked, appeared to have been very weak, or to have failed completely.  Of the 11 Walleye collected in all sampling gears, eight were from year classes supported by fingerling stocking (six from the 2012 year class).  Growth had been somewhat slower than average for a lake of this type.  Slow Walleye growth was probably due to modest Yellow Perch numbers and competition for forage from Smallmouth Bass, Northern Pike, and Cisco.  <br> \n <br> \nThis survey provided no evidence that stocking Walleye fingerlings at a higher rate had resulted in any increase in Walleye abundance in this lake.  Although some stocked year classes contributed to the 2016 catch, their numbers were low.  Results of surveys done in 2015 indicated the 2012 year class was strong in many area Walleye lakes reliant solely on natural reproduction, and there is a chance that some fish of that year class taken in Flour Lake in 2016 could also have been produced naturally.  A review of past stocking in Flour Lake done in December 2016 indicated somewhat stronger stocked year classes were produced when the lake was stocked with fingerlings at a lower rate (0.5 pounds/littoral acre/year).  A creel survey done on Flour Lake over the summer of 2016 estimated total Walleye catch on the lake was probably less than 50 fish (with none harvested).  That seemed a poor result for an expensive stocking practice. <br> \n <br> \nManagement goals for Lake Trout in Flour Lake have not been met, despite 20 years of regular stocking.  The catch goal for Lake Trout in Flour Lake  been met just once (in 1994) since the species was re-introduced in 1993, and it was not met in 2016.  The catch in deep gill net sets and the mean weight for Lake Trout taken in that gear were both below normal for this area.  The 2016 catch was poorer in terms of numbers and size than most past catches observed in this lake since 1994.  The only Lake Trout taken in 2016 were one-year-old fish from the 2016 yearling stocking.  As has been indicated by previous surveys of this lake, while there has been some short-term survival of stocked Lake Trout, long-term survival has been poor.  This survey provided no evidence for any natural reproduction of Lake Trout.   In the 2016 creel survey of this lake, fewer than five percent of parties interviewed reported fishing for Lake Trout, and no Lake Trout were reported caught by any parties contacted during that survey. <br> \n <br> \nFlour Lake supported high numbers of Smallmouth Bass in 2016, and, although the average size for bass taken in gill nets in 2016 was on the low side for this lake historically, anglers interviewed during the 2016 creel survey reported catching large numbers of large bass.  Goals for the Smallmouth Bass population in this lake were met or exceeded in 2016, based on results of this survey and the 2016 creel survey.  <br> \n <br> \nAs has typically been the case in this lake, Northern Pike abundance appeared to have been low in 2016.  Although Northern Pike were scarce, fish sampled in this survey were fairly large.  Anglers interviewed during the 2016 creel survey reported catching just one Northern Pike, and the estimated harvest for the summer was just six fish. <br> \n <br> \nCisco gill net catches in Flour Lake had been fairly stable through 2012, but the combined catch in deep and shallow gill net sets in 2016 was one of the lower catches seen in this lake historically (Table 3).  Nevertheless, the 2016 catch in deep gill net sets was still above normal for a lake of this type.  Cisco provided important forage for Northern Pike and Lake Trout, although most were too large to be taken by most of the Walleye present in 2016. <br> \n <br> \nFlour Lake is infested with spiny waterflea, so anglers and other visitors should carefully clean and dry any equipment used in Flour Lake before moving to another water.   <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Flour Lake is a 330 acre lake approximately 31 miles north of Grand Marais with a public boat landing located on the northwestern side of the lake. Primary management species have historically been walleye, smallmouth bass, and lake trout. Lake trout stocking was discontinued after 2018 due to lack of survival. The 2023 standard survey was the first of two scheduled surveys to determine whether goals for the walleye population can be met with supplemental stocking, to evaluate the effectiveness of the current smallmouth bass regulation (protected 14-20 inches slot; one over 20 inches), and to determine whether any remnant lake trout were present from previous stocking efforts. <br> \n <br> \nManagement goals for lake trout in Flour Lake have only been met once (1994) despite 20 years of regular stocking. No lake trout were captured in the 2023 survey and continued to indicate natural recruitment is likely very low or non-existant. As indicated by previous surveys of this lake, while there has been some short-term survival of stocked lake trout, long-term survival has been poor. Thermal habitat may be a limiting factor for lake trout in Flour. A temperature-oxygen profile completed in mid-July found cold, well-oxygenated water from 21-51 ft deep. Although conditions probably deteriorated further as the summer progressed, a sufficient volume of suitable habitat may have persisted until fall turnover.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye catch rates were above average for Flour Lake and similar to other Minnesota lakes. Walleye ranged from 6.7 to 29.6 inches with a mean of 17.5 inches. Aging results showed 12 year classes present with the oldest fish being 15 years old. Most year classes align with historic walleye fingerling stockings. However, naturally reproduced year classes seem to be present in the population from 2008, 2011, 2013, and 2017. Walleye growth rates were good with individuals averaging 17.1 inches at year 5. Anglers should have good success finding walleye with some large fish present.  <br> \n <br> \nSmallmouth bass catch rates were some of the highest recorded in Flour Lake. Smallmouth bass ranged between 7.4 and 17.9 inches with a mean of 13.3 inches. Aging results found 9 naturally reproduced year classes present with the oldest fish being 12 years old. Smallmouth bass growth rates were slow. Survey results suggest that the current smallmouth bass regulation (protected 14-20 inches slot; one over 20 inches) is continuing to provide a high-quality smallmouth bass fishing opportunity for anglers.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike catch rates were low but in the normal range for Flour Lake. Although not very numerous, northern pike were large up to 36 inches. Anglers targeting northern pike in Flour have the potential to encounter some larger individuals.  <br> \n <br> \nCisco gill net catches continue to be high in Flour Lake and well above average for similar Minnesota lakes. Cisco likely provide very high-quality forage for predator populations in Flour.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch abundance was similar to past catches in this lake and not very large in size. Green sunfish were abundant in the trap nets but also small with no individuals larger than 7 inches collected. <br> \n</p>",

THE 1985 ASSESSMENT REPORTED STRONG 1983 AND 1981 YEAR CLASSES, WITH HALF THE 1983 YEAR-CLASS ACCOUNTED FOR BY STOCKED (CLIPPED) FINGERLINGS. NEITHER YEAR-CLASS IS STRONG NOW, AND THERE IS LITTLE EVIDENCE OF STOCKING OR REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS SINCE 1985. PAST ASSESSMENTS HAVE SHOWN GOOD GROWTH IN WALLEYE, AND THE PRESENT ASSESSMENT SHOWS AN ADEQUATE FORAGE BASE COMPOSED OF YELLOW PERCH AND NORTHERN CISCO. SMALLMOUTH BASS ARE ABUNDANT, BUT SIZE IS SMALL. SMALLMOUTH BASS HARVESTED BY ANGLERS IN 1988 AVER- AGED 11 INCHES. FAR MORE BASS WERE RELEASED THAN WERE KEPT, WITH MOST RELEASED SMALLMOUTH BASS RANGING FROM 5 TO 9 INCHES. SMALLMOUTH BASS GROWTH IS SLOW, BY STATE STANDARDS. THIS ASSESSMENTS SHOWS STRONG 1986 AND 1984 YEAR-CLASSES. AGING FROM THE 1988 CREEL SURVEY SHOWS A STRONG 1983 YEAR-CLASS (MEAN LENGTH AT LAST ANNULUS OF 10.3 INCHES). NORTHERN CISCO ABUNDANCE IS VERY HIGH. IT APPEARS THAT THE COMMERCIAL HARVEST HAS HAD LITTLE EFFECT ON NORTHERN CISCO NUMBERS. A COMPARISON OF CREEL SURVEY RESULTS FROM 1983 AND 1988 SHOWS THAT FISHING PRESSURE HAS REMAINED FAIRLY CONSTANT. HARVEST RATES HAVE DECLINED FOR WALLEYE, NORTHERN PIKE, AND SMALLMOUTH BASS.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>The walleye catch in 1997 was relatively high compared to past assessments in this lake.  There appeared to have been little natural reproduction, with 95% of the walleye collected coming from stocked year classes.  Most of the 1997 catch was the result of a strong 1994 year class.  Fish from that year class averaged 14.0 inches in length when collected in late July.The catch of smallmouth bass in gill nets and by electrofishing was relatively low for lakes of this class, and for this lake historically.  Smallmouth bass as large as 14 inches were taken, but the number of larger fish present appeared to have been low.  Lake trout, reintroduced in 1993, were collected in fairly high numbers in 1997.  Most of the lake trout taken were from a 1997 yearling stocking, but two fish from the 1995 stocking were also taken.  Lake trout growth had been fast, and fish from the 1995 stocking averaged 19.5 inches when captured in early July.The northern pike catch was low, as it has usually been in this lake, but the one fish collected was large.  The yellow perch catch was also low.  Forage for gamefish was provided by yellow perch and a good population of northern cisco.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Gill net sets in this assessment were stratified on the basis of depth.  In this discussion 'combined' will refer to the combined catch in deep and shallow gill nets, which should be comparible to past catches in this lake, and to lake class medians.The combined walleye catch in 2001 was low for a lake of this class; however, it was not unusually low for this lake historically.  The catch included fish from four year classes, all of which had been stocked.  None of the year classes (with the possible exception of the 2000 year class) were strong.  Although sample size was small, it appeared that walleye growth had been fairly fast.  Good walleye growth may have been due to the presence of a northern cisco forage base, since yellow perch abundance was apparently very low.The combined smallmouth bass catch was about average for this lake class, and it was similar to past catches in this lake.  Mean weight of smallmouth bass taken in gill nets was about average for the lake, historically.  The smallmouth bass catch was too low to allow assessment of year class strength; however, these results, plus results from a creel survey conducted on the lake in 2001, suggest that several recent year classes may have been unusually weak.  Smallmouth bass growth had been relatively slow.No lake trout were collected in 2001, despite continued stocking, and reports of anglers taking lake trout in the spring.  A review of net set location data suggests that most of the deep gill net sets were in waters with marginal oxygen levels for lake trout.  The combined catch of northern cisco in 2001 was about average for lakes of this type; however, it was low for this lake, historically.  The catch in deep gill net sets was the lowest observed to date in that gear.  Northern cisco may be showing the effects of predation from the newly-introduced lake trout population.  They have also become infested with triaenophorus (a tapeworm inhabiting muscle tissue) in recent years (although infested populations have not declined in other area lakes).  The 2001 catch appeared to have consisted mainly of adult fish.</p>",
