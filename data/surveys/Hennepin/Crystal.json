The growth rates of the NOP and BLG were above average when compared with the statewide figures. The fish population presently appears to be in good shape though no crappies were reported. The lack of this species is of minor consequence. Other specie reported present in 1948, but not taken during the 1958 lake survey include: LMB, PMK, and GOS. Though this lake is presently lightly used, it is doubtful that stocking would appreciably change this situation. Light fishing just seems to be the circumstance of our close-in Twin Cities lakes. The lake is classified as Largemouth Bass/Panfish lake for management purposes.</p>",

The average size of Black Crappie sampled was 7.1 inches and the average rate was 5 fish per pound. Only one crappie above nine inches was captured. Bluegills have decreased in abundance since 1993, but are still present in above average numbers. The average size of Bluegill captured was 5.8 inches in length and these fish ran approximately 6 fish per pound. Pumpkinseed Sunfish have increased in abundance since 1993, but are only 4.7 inches long on the average. Northern Pike have shown a significant increase in abundance since 1993, but they average only 22 inches in length. Two Hybrid Muskies from the 1994 stocking were captured, and these fish exhibited good growth rates and a good length to weight ratio. Crystal Lake contains an above average abundance of forage. Golden Shiners averaging 6.2 inches long and Yellow Perch averaging 6.4 inches long were both observed in increased abundance since 1993. No Goldfish were captured in 1998, however, Carp were captured for the first time in this lake.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Crystal Lake is located in Robbinsdale with city parks on the north and south ends of the lake.  Both parks provide shorefishing opportunities, and a fishing pier is located on the northern end of the lake.  Boaters can access Crystal Lake at the public access on the southern end of the lake.  Crystal Lake is primarily a panfish lake, and has been stocked with tiger muskellunge fingerlings every 2 to 4 years since 1994, most recently in 2001.  The city of Robbinsdale maintains winter aerators to prevent winterkill, and has been working to reduce storm water input to Crystal Lake to improve the water quality.  In addition, a shoreline restoration is planned in 2005 on the northern end of the lake.  Small panfish dominate the fish community at Crystal Lake.  Bluegills were sampled at an abundance above the 75th percentile for this lake type and were smaller than average.   Bluegills had a mean length of 4.8 inches, and the largest individual was 6.9 inches.  Black crappie abundance was lower than in previous surveys, but numbers were still above average when compared to similar lakes.  The mean length of black crappies sampled was 6.1 inches, and only one fish larger than 8 inches was sampled.  Northern pike were the most abundant predator species sampled in survey nets, but were less abundant than during the previous survey.  The catch of 2.8 northern pike per gill net is just above the 25th percentile for class 30 lakes.  The mean length and weight were 27.8 inches and 5.6 pounds.  Four year-classes of northern pike were represented in the survey, ages 4 to 7.   The average age of the northern pike sampled increased from 3.0 in 1998 to 5.3 in 2004.  During the 1998 survey it was noted that historical northern pike spawning areas on the southern end of the lake had been filled, and the area converted to ball fields.  Four tiger muskellunge from the 2001 stocking were sampled in gill nets, an average abundance of 0.67 fish per net.  The tiger muskellunge had a mean length and weight of 29.3 inches and 6.6 pounds.   Tiger muskellunge are a cross between a male northern pike and a female muskellunge.  Largemouth bass were present in the trap net samples representing 3 year-classes.  Growth rates were average.Important prey species in Crystal Lake are golden shiners and yellow perch.  Golden shiners were the most abundant forage species.  Yellow perch were also abundant, and were present in gill nets at a level just below the third quartile.   The yellow perch sampled in gill nets had a mean length of 6.5 inches; growth was average.Yellow bullhead, white sucker, pumpkinseed sunfish, green sunfish, hybrid sunfish, and one 18.1-inch walleye were also present in net samples.  Eighteen painted turtles, 8 snapping turtles, and 1 exotic eastern slider turtle were sampled.For more information about the FiN program or to see what FiN has done in your neighborhood, please visit us at: www.dnr.state.mn.us/fishing/fin.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>GOS, NOP, YEP, WTS, and BLB were taken in numbers per set significantly higher than the statewide median. YEB and PMK were found in numbers significantly lower than the statewide median. Goldfish were taken in the gillnets, but no median exists for this species. NOP are present in numbers significantly higher than the local median. Fish aged were found to be II to VI annulus fish with III and IV annulus fish equally most abundant. Both III and IV annulus NOP showed average growth. The IV annulus NOP correspond to a stocking of yearlings made in 1976. Five annulus fish were also present and correspond to a 1974 fingerling stocking. The NOP taken consisted primarily of very large fish, the average weight of 26 fish being 4.2 pounds. YEP numbers were considerably higher than the local median. Forty-seven of 50 fish aged were II and III annulus fish. Growth rates at both of these ages was found to be fast. BLB are numerous compared to the local median figures and the fish tend to be small. PMK numbers are equal to the local median with the most common age being II annulus fish showing fast growth. LMB were taken in trap nets and all were found to be II annulus fish. Crystal lake will be managed primarily through NOP yearling stockings on an annual basis. LMB can be stocked. Previous stockings of BLC and BLG are no longer present, nor have their progeny showed up. Past winterkills seem to have reduced them to virtually nothing. Since the YEP population is high and consists of fish desirable to anglers, stocking of competing species such as BLC and BLG should not be made. The addition of a third aerator is recommended since recent past winterkills have been associated with failure of units during critical periods. Three units should prevent this.</p>",

Hybrid Muskellunge averaged 35.8 inches long and 12.6 pounds while northern pike averaged 28.0 inches and 5.0 pounds. Growth for both species was found to be good. Largemouth bass were observed only during shoreline seining and all individuals sampled were young-of-the-year. Bluegill and black crappie were captured in nearly equal abundance. Bluegill averaged 5.0 inches while black crappie averaged 7.0 inches in length. Both species are present in above normal abundance. Pumpkinseed sunfish are also present but average only 4.6 inches in length. Black and yellow bullhead are present in below average numbers, but above average sizes. Of the two main forage species present, golden shiner were captured in far greater numbers than yellow perch.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Crystal Lake is a 78-acre lake located in Robbinsdale. City parks are situated to the north and south of the lake, and both provide shore fishing access.  The park to the north includes a fishing pier (Installed in 2019), and the park to the south includes a boat access with trailer parking.  Crystal Lake is primarily a panfish lake and has been stocked with Tiger Muskellunge fingerlings every 2 to 4 years since 1994, most recently in 2017.  The city of Robbinsdale maintains winter aerators to prevent winterkill, and has been working to reduce storm water input to Crystal Lake to improve the water quality.  A flocculation plant (built in 2014) is in operation on the southern end of the lake to remove phosphorus.  Crystal Lake is part of Fishing in the Neighborhood (FiN).  For more information about FiN, please visit:   <br> \nwww.dnr.state.mn.us/fishing/fin. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill and Black Crappie are the primary management species in Crystal Lake. Bluegill abundance was average when compared to similar lakes, but these fish were small at approximately 5 inches in length.  No Bluegill greater than 7 inches were captured, and only 6% of fish sampled in 2022 were between 6-7 inches.  Black Crappie were relatively abundant compared to similar lakes but were small as 71% of the fish sampled were between 5-6.5 inches in length. Only 1 individual was >9 inches. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch were sampled in above average abundance, but the fish were small, averaging 0.08 pounds and just over 5.5 inches.  Three Tiger Muskellunge were captured in gillnets, ranging from 34 to 40 inches and weighing 13.4 pounds on average.  Northern Pike and Largemouth Bass, species noted from the earlier surveys, were not captured in 2022.  Common Carp and Golden Shiner were abundant and captured in above average values.  Other species sampled included Black Bullhead, Green Sunfish, hybrid sunfish, Yellow Bullhead, White Sucker, and Bowfin.   <br> \n</p>",
