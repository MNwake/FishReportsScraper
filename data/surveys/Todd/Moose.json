                "narrative": "<p>        Moose Lake has a permanent largemouth bass regulation that requires the immediate release of all bass greater than 12 inches.  The regulation was first enacted June 1, 1996 and by 1997 there were already signs of improvement in the bass population size structure.  Objectives of the regulation are to develop a largemouth bass population characterized in spring electrofishing by a PSD of 50 or higher with 10% or more of the fish exceeding 17 inches in length.  Another goal is to maintain catch rates at over 50 bass per hour on-time.   An electrofishing assessment was conducted in mid-May of 2010 to evaluate the bass population since the last bass electrofishing sampling was done in 2004.  Scales were collected from the bass for aging data. <br> \n       The 2010 spring electrofishing results may not be directly comparable to previous data.  The 2010 electrofishing was conducted during the day using a new boat and two netters.  The other electrofishing assessments were done at night with a less efficient older boat and one netter.  The catch rate for the 2010 effort was 131.6 bass per hour on-time (n=104) which was the highest catch to date for the lake but still comparable to the 1995 catch rate of 128/hour.   Moose Lake continues to exhibit a size structure much improved from what existed prior to special regulations.  The bass measured from 6.5 to 18.4 inches in length with a mean length of 13 inches.  PSD for the sample was 62 and 7% (n=7) of the bass were more than 17 inches in length.  The 2010 catch rate was more than twice the management goal.  The PSD also met the management goal of 50 or higher, however, the proportion of fish that exceeded 17 inches was lower than desired.  The table below shows the results from previous electrofishing assessments. <br> \n <br> \n     Moose Electrofishing Data <br> \n           Pre-Reg\t       Regs <br> \n    1993    1994   1995    1997    1999     2001    2004    2010 <br> \nEffort/hrs.       1.3       1.2       1.7      1.3      1.1        1.1       1.1      0.8 <br> \nCatch rate       83       105      128      51       47         79         71      132 <br> \nPSD        6 16       30        75        60         44         62       62 <br> \n% > 17\"   0         1.6       1          3 13         14        10        7 <br> \nAve. Len.       9.3      10.0     11.3     12.7     11.8      12.2     12.9     13 <br> \n\t <br> \n       Ages 2 through 10 were represented in the 2010 electrofishing catch.

                "narrative": "<p>     Moose Lake is a popular panfish lake north of Burtrum along Highway 28.  Bluegill and black crappie provide fishing opportunity year round while spring time seems to be the most popular time for walleye fishing.   The lake does not have much for fishing structures other than a sunken island, fallen trees, and edges of waterlily beds.  Water quality has been an ongoing problem in the lake with algae blooms common in the summer months.   Filamentous algae and star duckweed were the two most frequently encounted aquatic plants which is common with nutrient rich water.   Coontail, flatstem pondweed, and fries' pondweed were the most common submergent plants and grew to a depth of 9 feet.  Sand was the most prevalent shallow water substrate.  Moose Lake falls in the category of a eutrophic lake characterized by limited transparency, frequent algae blooms, high in nutrient concentrations, and oxygen depletions below the thermocline.  At the time the survey was conducted in late July, little oxygen was available to fish below the 9 foot depth. <br> \n     The primary management species for Moose Lake is largemouth bass.  A regulation limiting the size of bass in possession to 12 inches or under is in effect on the lake.  The goal of the regulation is to increase the number of bass over 17 inches while allowing the harvest of fish under 12 inches which are more numerous.  The lake has an abundant bass population with a wide range of sizes available to anglers including fish up to 19 inches.   <br> \n   A spring panfish trap net assessment was done in May of 2012 to evaluate the adult bluegill and black crappie populations.   Moose Lake supports an abundant crappie population that is dominated by smaller fish as average length was 7.3 inches in the 2012 assessments.  Although most of the crappie were less than 9 inches in length a few fish up to 11 inches were observed.  The bluegill population is also dominated by smaller fish, but, the lake is known for producing fish up to 10 inches.  Fast growth has helped to sustain some quality in the past; however, present population appears much reduced in terms of quality.   <br> \n    Northern pike numbers appear to be low when compared to similar type lakes.   Average size was better than in most lakes in the area at 3.4 pounds and anglers also have the opportunity to encounter quality size fish as a pike over 36 inches was caught in the spring panfish assessment.  Despite a low perch population, pike growth was good.  Lower pike numbers may allow the yellow perch population to rebound in abundance.  Higher perch numbers are desirable to help maintain good growth rates in both northern pike and walleye.  Perch can also be instrumental in helping maintain a well-balanced bluegill population with fast growing, quality sized individuals. <br> \n     The walleye fishery in the lake is maintained by stocking.  While fall fingerling stocking had been the primary method, Moose Lake was part of a Research study that was conducted to determine if frylings would be a viable option.  Frylings are typically stocked in June and are less costly to produce although they are much smaller than fingerlings and more susceptible to predation.   Anglers have an opportunity to catch a nice size walleye as most of the fish seen in the 2012 assessments were between 16 and 27 inches.   <br> \n    Two species of bullhead, black and yellow, were caught in the 2012 assessments.  Yellow bullhead were the more numerous, and quality size individuals up to 14 inches were caught in both species.   Other members of the fish community include pumpkinseed sunfish, bowfin or dogfish, and common carp.   <br> \n     Releasing larger northern pike and walleye is encouraged along with voluntary release of large bluegill and black crappie to achieve a more balanced fish community.  Water quality in Moose Lake is a major concern.  Although much of the immediate shoreline is still covered in forest, the watershed is dominated by cultivated row crops.   Surrounding land use practices can be having a detrimental effect on water quality and the recreational value of the lake.  Some effort may be needed to identify sources of excess phosphorus so plans can be developed to reduce these sources.  Buffer strips along inlets and lakeshore property are encouraged to reduce nutrients entering the lake.  Maintaining adequate septic systems, keeping grass clippings and raked leaves out of the lake, and the use of zero phosphorus lawn fertilizer are all ways landowners can reduce nutrients entering the lake, thus slowing algae and excess weed growth. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Moose Lake has been managed with a reduced bag limit for sunfish since 2016 when a 10 fish bag limit was enacted. This bag limit was further reduced to 5 fish in 2021. Trap netting and daytime electrofishing were performed throughout the month of May 2023 in an effort to calculate a population estimate of Bluegills 175 mm (about 7 inches) and larger.  The combined trap netting and electrofishing work resulted in the marking of 662 Bluegill. Recapture efforts produced very few fish and only a single recaptured individual. The failure of recapture efforts to produce an adequate sample or sufficient recaptures resulted in the inability to calculate a statistically valid population estimate. Since only fish over 175 mm were measured, comparisons of size structure to past trap net assessments would not be suitable. The largest Bluegill sampled was 9.6 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nTrap netting provided a large sample of Black Crappie totaling 1,515 fish of which 336 were measured. All size groups between 8 and 10.9 inches were strongly represented and mean length was 9.6 inches. Fish exceeding 10 inches accounted for 36% of the catch but only 1% were over 12 inches.  Black Crappie growth rates are good.  The present crappie population offers an abundance of harvestable size fish. <br> \n <br> \nA large sample of Largemouth Bass was also caught in the trap nets. A total of 308 bass were observed and 184 were measured. Bass ranged in length from 6.6 to 19.7 inches and mean length was 13.9 inches.  Only one bass over 18 inches was captured.  Moose Lake has an abundant bass population where anglers can experience high catch rates of medium sized bass (12-16 inches).   <br> \n <br> \nA total of nine Northern Pike were captured in the trap nets and the catch was predominantly larger fish.  Mean length was 30.7 inches and two fish over 38 inches were observed. Eight Walleye were also captured and 6 of the 8 appeared to be yearling fish from the 2022 fingerling stocking. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>       Moose Lake is a popular panfish lake north of Burtrum along Highway 28.  Bluegill and Black Crappie provide fishing opportunity year-round while spring time seems to be the most popular time for Walleye fishing.   The lake does not have much for fishing structures other than a sunken island, fallen trees, and edges of waterlily beds.  Water quality has been an ongoing problem in the lake with algal blooms common in the summer months.   Filamentous algae and star duckweed were the two most frequently encountered aquatic plants in the last survey which is common with nutrient rich water.    Moose Lake falls in the category of a eutrophic lake characterized by limited transparency, frequent algae blooms, high in nutrient concentrations, and oxygen depletions below the thermocline.   <br> \n     The primary management species for Moose Lake is Largemouth Bass.  A regulation limiting the size of bass in possession to 12 inches or under is in effect on the lake.  The goal of the regulation is to increase the number of bass over 17 inches while allowing the harvest of fish under 12 inches which are more numerous.  The lake has an abundant bass population with a wide range of sizes available to anglers including fish up to 19 inches.   <br> \n      Although few panfish were sampled in the summer survey, a spring panfish trap net assessment conducted in early June of 2014 was used to evaluate the adult Bluegill and Black Crappie populations.   Moose Lake supports an abundant crappie population that is dominated by smaller fish as average length was 8.3 inches in the 2014 assessments.  Although most of the crappie were less than 9 inches in length a few fish up to 11 inches were observed.  Past assessments suggest that few Black Crappie reach 11 inches in Moose Lake.  Medium size Bluegill, 6.5 - 7.5 inches, were common in the spring assessment and the lake is known for producing fish up to 10 inches.  Fast growth has helped to sustain some quality in the past; however, the present population appears much reduced in terms of quality.   <br> \n    Few Northern Pike  were caught in the summer survey, but average size was better than in most lakes in the Little Falls area at 3.7 pounds and anglers also have the opportunity to encounter quality size fish over 36 inches.   Lower pike numbers may allow the currently low Yellow Perch population to rebound in abundance.  Higher perch numbers are desirable to help maintain good growth rates in both Northern Pike and Walleye.  Perch can also be instrumental in helping maintain a well-balanced Bluegill population with fast growing, quality sized individuals. <br> \n     The Walleye fishery in the lake is maintained by stocking.  While fall fingerling stocking had been the primary method, Moose Lake was part of a Research study conducted to determine if frylings would be a viable option.  Frylings are typically stocked in June and are less costly to produce although they are much smaller than fingerlings and more susceptible to predation.   Anglers have an opportunity to catch a nice size Walleye as all the fish caught in the survey were over 19 inches.   <br> \n    All three species of bullhead, Black, Brown, and Yellow, were caught in the 2014 assessments.  Yellow Bullhead was the more numerous, and quality size individuals up to 11 inches were caught in all species.   Other members of the fish community include Pumpkinseed Sunfish, Bowfin or Dogfish, hybrid sunfish, Green Sunfish, and Common Carp.   <br> \n     Releasing larger Northern Pike and Walleye is encouraged along with voluntary release of large Bluegill (especially males) and Black Crappie to achieve a more balanced fish community.  Water quality in Moose Lake is a major concern.  Although much of the immediate shoreline is still covered in forest, the watershed is dominated by cultivated row crops.   Surrounding land use practices may be having a detrimental effect on water quality and the recreational value of the lake.  Some effort may be needed to identify sources of excess phosphorus so plans can be developed to reduce these inputs.  Buffer strips along inlets and lakeshore property are encouraged to reduce nutrients entering the lake.  Maintaining adequate septic systems, keeping grass clippings and raked leaves out of the lake, and the use of zero phosphorus lawn fertilizer are all ways landowners can reduce nutrients entering the lake, thus slowing algae and excess weed growth. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Moose Lake is a popular panfish lake north of Burtrum along Highway 28.  Bluegills and black crappies provide fishing opportunities all year round while spring time seems to be the most popular time for walleye fishing on the lake.  The lake does not have a lot of structure other than a sunken island and edges of waterlily beds.  Water quality has been an ongoing problem in the lake with algae blooms common in the lake.  Filamentous algae and star duckweed were the most common aquatic plants in the lake.  Flatstem pondweed was the most abundant submerged aquatic plant and only grew out to a depth of 7 feet due to the poor water clarity.  Vegetation will typically grow out to a depth of 12 to 15 feet in most area lakes.  Moose Lake falls in the catagory of a eutrophic lake charaterized by limited transparency, algae blooms common, rich in nutrients, and oxygen depleted in area of the lake below the thermocline.   At the time the survey was conducted in early August little oxygen was available to fish below 13 feet.    Two of the most notable changes from the last survey in 1998 were the northern pike and yellow perch catches.  Pike numbers showed a significant decline and appear to be low, while perch abundance increased and rose above the normal range when compared to similar type lakes.  Anglers have a good opportunity to catch a nice size northern pike as the average size in the survey was 4 pounds with several fish in the 8 pound range.  The higher yellow perch population should help to maintain good growth rates in the pike and walleye.  Perch can also be instrumental in helping maintain a well balanced bluegill population with fast growing, quality individuals.  The perch can also provide a fishery as some of the fish measured up to almost 11 inches, however, about half of the perch caught in the survey had neascus or black spot.    The primary management species for Moose Lake is largemouth bass.  A regulation limiting the size of bass in possession to 12 inches or under is in effect on the lake.  The goal of the regulation is to increase the number of bass over 17 inches while allowing harvest of bass under 12 inches which are more numerous.  Moose Lake appears to have an excellent bass population with a wide range of sizes available to anglers including fish up to 20 inches.  Along with an improvement in number of larger fish since the implementation of the regulation, has been an improvement in growth rates for the bass.      The walleye fishery in the lake is maintained by fall fingerling stocking in odd numbered years.  Walleye numbers appeared to be within the normal range for that type of lake and were similar to the catch seen in 1998.  Anglers have a wide range of sizes available to them as walleye from 10 to 29 inches were seen in the survey.  The lower northern pike and higher perch number could be a positive for walleye stocking.  There should be better survival of the fingerlings from less predation by the pike and the perch providing a good food source.    Moose Lake has abundant populations of both bluegills and black crappies.  Despite the high numbers some quality size bluegills can be found in Moose Lake with fish up to almost 10 inches being documented in a late spring assessment.  Average size of the bluegills, however, was about 6 inches.  Along with the high crappie numbers comes a low average size of about 7 inches.  Even with fertile water the crappies showed variable growth rates, but few fish over 10 inches have been seen in surveys suggesting anglers are cropping them off as the fish approach 9 inches in length.  The bluegills in Moose Lake grow fast but they also show evidence of high harvest at 5 - 6 years of age and 6.5 to 7 inches of length.    Other species in the fish community include black bullhead, hybrid sunfish, pumpkinseeds, white sucker, and yellow bullhead.  Both species of bullheads had quality individuals up to 12 inches with some yellow bullheads up to 15 inches in length.    Releasing larger northern pike and walleye is encouraged along with voluntary release of large bluegills and black crappies to work toward a more balanced fish community.  Water quality in Moose Lake is a major concern.  Surrounding land use practices are having a detrimental effect on the water and recreational value of the lake.  Improving the water quality in Moose Lake should be a high priority of the county and landowners around the lake.  Some effort may be needed to identify any sources of excess phosphorus and plans developed to reduce these sources.  Buffer strips along inlets and lakeshore property are encouraged to reduce nutrients entering the lake.  Maintaining adequate septics, keeping grass clippings and raked leaves out the lake, and the use of zero phosphorus lawn fertilizer will also help reduce nutrients entering the lake, thus slowing algae and excess weed growth.  The Todd County Planning and Zoning office in Long Prairie has a good website which provides information for shoreline property owners. (www.co.todd.mn.us/PlanningZoning/planning.htm) </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>       Bluegill and black crappie are highly sought after species in Moose Lake.  A panfish assessment was conducted in late May to evaluate the population size structure of the two species.  Six lake survey trap nets were set with two of the nets being reset after the first lift for a total of eight lifts.  Only two of the trap nets were reset due to the high panfish catches from the first lift.  Similar panfish assessments were conducted in 2004 and 1999.  The 2004 assessment had 12 net lifts and the 1999 assessment ten net lifts.  A subsample of bluegill and crappie were measured and scales taken for aging data in the 2010 assessment.  Gamefish along with the carp were measured while other fish species were identified and counted. <br> \n       All of the panfish assessments have been effective at catching bluegill.  Catches have ranged from 88.2/trap net in 1999 to 146.9/trap net in 2004 with a catch rate of 123.5/trap net recorded in 2010.   The fish caught in all assessments have ranged from 3 to 9.5 inches.    The mean length has shown an improved trend through the assessments that started at 6.2 inches in 1999, then 6.4 inches in 2004, and 7.1 inches in 2010.  The proportion of the catch larger than seven inches in length has also shown a steady increase, from 6% (n=54) in 1999 to 18% (n=313) in 2004 and 51% (n=502) in 2010.  The results in the 2010 assessment greatly exceeded the lake management goal of at least 20% of the spring bluegill catch exceeding seven inches in length.  All of the panfish assessments had bluegill that were more than nine inches in length, also a management goal for the lake.   <br> \n       Ages 3 through 10 were represented in the 2010 bluegill catch.  All of the age groups displayed fast growth when compared to an area mean back-calculated length table.  The strongest year class was 2005 which accounted for 43% of the catch. <br> \n       The 2010 panfish assessment was also effective at catching black crappies with 177 fish netted (22.3/trap net).  The 2004 assessment also produced a good catch (n= 146; 12.2/trap net) while fewer fish were caught in 1999 (n=85; 8.5/trap net).  The size structure displayed in the 2010 assessment was the most desirable of the three panfish assessments.  The fish measured from 7.8 to 10.9 inches in length with a mean length of 9.1 inches, modal length of 9 - 9.5 inches, and 57% (n=100) of the crappie larger than nine inches.  Crappie in 2004 assessment ranged from 4.2 to 10.8 inches in length.  Mean length was 6.8 inches, modal length 7 - 7.5 inches with only 3% (n=4) of the fish more than 9 inches in length.  The size structure of the 1999 crappie catch was between the former two results.  The length range was similar to 2004 (3.5 - 10.5 inches), but the mean length was better ( 7.8 inches), with a modal length of 8 - 8.5 inches, and 26% (n=22) of the catch larger than nine inches.  Both the 2010 and 2004 catch rates exceeded the lake management goal of at least ten crappie per trap net lift in a panfish assessment.  Only the 2010 assessment met the management goal of at least 35% of the spring crappie catch greater than nine inches in length.   No crappie over eleven inches have ever been sampled in any of the previous surveys or panfish assessments.  The fish likely do not reach large size due to population density and natural mortality. <br> \n       Ages 4 through 8 were represented in the 2010 crappie catch.  All of the age groups exhibited normal growth.  As with bluegill, 2005 was the strongest year class in the crappie catch, accounting for 50% of the sample. <br> \n       Gamefish that were measured during the 2010 panfish assessment included four walleye between 24 and 29 inches along with four largemouth bass between 14 and 19.5 inches.  Three common carp ranging from 21 to 29 inches were also caught and measured.  Other fish species caught during the panfish assessment included bowfin, brown bullhead, golden shiner, green , hybrid and  pumpkinseed sunfish, yellow bullhead, and yellow perch. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>       A spring panfish assessment was conducted on Moose Lake in early June of 2014 to evaluate the Bluegill and Black Crappie populations.  Panfish, especially Bluegill, provide an important fishery in the area as Moose Lake has a reputation of producing larger Bluegill.  The Black Crappie population, although abundant, has typically been dominated by smaller fish.  Spring panfish assessments have proven successful in sampling the quality aspects in panfish populations that are typically missed in summer trap nets.  Summer gill nets were scheduled later to evaluate game fish populations, particularly Walleye.  Moose Lake was proposed for special regulations which would set a Bluegill bag limit of ten fish daily in 2016.   <br> \n       Six standard lake survey trap nets were set and lifted twice for 11 net lifts.  All fish were identified and most measured.  Scales were taken from Bluegill and Black Crappie for age and growth evaluation.  Spring panfish assessments were also conducted in 2012, 2010, 2004, and 1999.   <br> \n       The 2014 spring panfish assessment was very effective at sampling both Bluegill (n=789) and Black Crappie (n=230).  The Bluegill catch was the second lowest and the Black Crappie catch the second highest of the five spring panfish assessments completed on Moose Lake.  The highest Bluegill catch was 1,763 fish in 2004 and lowest 484 fish in 2012.  The highest crappie catch was 362 fish in 2012 and the lowest 85 fish in 1999. <br> \n       The size structure of the 2014 Bluegill catch displayed more desirable characteristics when compared to the 2012 assessment.  Fish ranged from 3.2 to 8.5 inches in 2014 with 31% (n=241) of the fish more than seven inches and 2% (n=15) that exceeded eight inches in length.  In 2012 the Bluegill measured from 3 to 8.2 inches in length with 18% (n=85) that exceeded seven inches and 1% (n=5) over eight inches.  Mean length was 6.1 inches in 2014 compared to 5.7 inches in 2012.  Modal length was also longer in 2014, 6.5 to 7 inches compared to 6 - 6.5 inches in 2012. <br> \n       Ages 2 through 6, 8, and 9 were represented in the 2014 Bluegill sample.  Relative abundance and age data suggest few Bluegill make it past six years of age, a point at which they reach a length acceptable to anglers.  Three year classes from 2009 to 2011 accounted for most of the catch, each contributing from 21% to 27% of the sample.  All but the oldest fish (n=1) displayed fast growth rates when compared to an Area Mean Back-calculated Length table. <br> \n       Bluegill management goals for Moose Lake are to have a spring trap net catch where at least 20% of the catch exceeds seven inches with a presence of nine-inch fish.  The 2014 catch met the first goal but not the second.   Nine-inch Bluegill were caught in both 2010 (n=12; 1%) and 2004 (n=38; 2%) spring trap net assessments.  Also in 2010, 51% (n=502) of the Bluegill netted exceeded seven inches compared to only 17% (n=313) in 2004. <br> \n       The 2014 spring panfish assessment sampled 230 Black Crappie that ranged from 4.6 to 11.2 inches in length with a mean length of 8.3 inches.  Modal length for the catch was 8.5 \u0013 9 inches with 23% (n=54) of the fish more than nine inches with 3% (n=6) that exceeded ten inches in length.   Size structure of the crappie catches in both 2012 and 2004 were comparable, with fish up 10.7 inches measured and a modal length of 7 - 7.5 inches.  Mean length was slightly better in 2012, 7.4 inches compared to 6.8 inches in 2004.  In 2012, 4% (n=16) of the crappie exceeded nine inches with 1% (n=5) over ten inches in length while in 2004, 3% (n=4) of the crappie were over nine inches as well as ten inches. <br> \n       Ages 2 through 7 were represented in the 2014 spring crappie catch.  All age groups exhibited normal growth rates when compared to an Area Mean Back-calculated Length table.  Relative abundance and age data suggest consistent recruitment and high mortality after five years of age.  Few crappie larger than 11 inches have been sampled in Moose Lake and none over 12 inches have ever been recorded in the various assessments. <br> \n       The 2010 spring assessment displayed a more desirable size structure with crappie up to 10.9 inches measured, mean length of 9.1 inches, and a modal length of 9 - 9.5 inches.  More than half (57%; n=100) of the fish exceeded nine inches with 15% (n=26) more than ten inches in length.  The 2014 gill net catch size structure was similar to that shown in the 2010 spring TN catch.  Crappie up to 11.3 inches were measured with a mean length of 9 inches and modal length 9 - 9.5 inches.  More than half (56%; n=23) of the fish were more than nine inches in length and 10% (n=4) exceeded 10 inches. <br> \n       Game fish sampled in the 2014 spring trap net assessment on Moose Lake included one 19.8-inch Walleye and 16 Largemouth Bass between 9 and 16 inches in length.  Other fish species caught included Black Bullhead, Bowfin, Brown Bullhead, Common Carp, Golden Shiner, Green Sunfish, hybrid sunfish, Pumpkinseed, Yellow Bullhead, and Yellow Perch.  Yellow Bullhead accounted for a significant portion of the spring trap net catch, being the third most abundant species after Bluegill and Black Crappie.  The bullhead species did however, account for the most biomass of the catch.  <br> \n        Species composition was more diverse in the 2014 spring trap net catch than the summer gill net catch.  Fourteen species were caught in the spring compared to nine in the summer.  Species caught in the spring assessment but not the summer survey included Black Bullhead, Bowfin, Common Carp, Golden Shiner, Green Sunfish, hybrid sunfish, and Pumpkinseed.  White Sucker, however, were caught in the summer gill nets but not in the spring trap nets.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Moose Lake is a 129 acre bass/panfish lake located near Burtrum, MN.  A population estimate for Largemouth Bass was conducted in the fall of 2020 on Moose Lake.  Fish were captured via daytime electrofishing performed during six separate days from September 1 to October 1.  The original intent was to complete this daytime electrofishing survey in the spring, however staff/time shortages and workload priorities resulting from the Covid-19 pandemic required this population estimate to be moved to the fall.   Water temperatures dropped from 73F to 58F during the month-long sampling period.  All bass 250 mm (10 inches) or greater were netted and marked with a partial left pelvic fin clip.    Smaller bass were not netted therefore catch rates and size structure comparisons cannot be made to electrofishing efforts from previous years.  No aging structures were collected.  Moose Lake has had special regulations in place for Largemouth Bass since 1996 consisting of a 12 inch maximum size limit.  The goal of this regulation has been to improve the size structure within the bass population and it has succeeded in producing a higher proportion of bass from 12-17 inches. <br> \n <br> \nElectrofishing provided an overall sample of 641 measured fish and a catch rate of 77.5/hr. for bass 250 mm or larger.  Bass over 12 inches comprised 79% of the catch though fish over 16 inches accounted for only about 7% of the total and just 4 fish exceeded 18 inches.  The largest fish observed was 19.6 inches.  Calculations produced a population estimate of 2,495 bass that were 250 mm or longer.  Population estimates for Largemouth Bass have been conducted in the past on two other similar size lakes, Pierz Fish and Green Prairie Fish.  The estimate for Pierz Fish Lake was 2,906 bass 200 mm or longer and the Green Prairie population was estimated at 1,813 bass 200 mm or longer. <br> \n <br> \nA significant sample of Bluegill was also netted and measured during the September 25 effort to assess the viability of fall electrofishing targeting sunfish.  These fish are not documented in this report as the data was added to the targeted spring Bluegill electrofishing also completed in 2020.  Fall water temperatures of 60-67F appeared to be the most productive for sampling Bluegill and Black Crappie with electrofishing gear.  Large numbers of juvenile bass (under 250 mm) especially young-of-year were noted during the early September visits as were roughly 10 yearling Walleye.   Adult Common Carp were common along the east shore in early September and some juveniles were also observed.  Yellow Perch were also common with some adults up to 11 inches long.  Golden Shiners were especially abundant in the earliest effort.  Northern Pike were seen in their highest numbers during the latest sampling on October 1. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A standard survey using six gill nets was completed on July 27-29, 2020. Bluegill were most commonly caught followed by Yellow Bullhead and Largemouth Bass. Additionally, Bluegill were targeted using daytime electrofishing rather than trap nets due to Covid working guidelines.  <br> \n <br> \nMoose Lake is a small, 124-acre lake with moderately-high nutrient fertility. Water clarity is usually reduced due to algal blooms, however, our July 2020 water clarity measurement was 8.5 feet which is not bad. The lake is primarily managed for Largemouth Bass and Bluegills with Walleyes also stocked to provide an additional fishery to the public.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye fingerlings were stocked in 2013, 2015 and 2019. Subsequent surveys using gillnets to determine fingerling contributions to the adult fishery indicate that the 2013 and 2015 stockings were successful, with these fish now measuring 17.7-20.7 inches. A single fish from the 2019 stocking was caught and it measured 7.5 inches indicating this year class is not yet large enough to be caught efficiently with gill nets (typically 10 inches and larger fish are vulnerable to capture). Several yearling Walleye were observed during fall electrofishing. <br> \n <br> \nMoose Lake supports a Bluegill population that has the potential to develop into a high quality fishery (identified as Bluegills commonly reaching 9-10 inches and larger). For this reason, a special bag limit regulation went into effect March 1, 2021 limiting an angler's possession limit to five sunfish. Bag-reduction regulations for sunfish have been shown to improve the average size of Bluegills. Bluegill greater than eight inches made up 23% of the fall electrofishing sample and six fish over nine inches were captured. The vast majority of lakes in the Little Falls Area will continue to have the statewide 20-fish limit. Only a few lakes showing the highest potential to grow large Bluegill were selected for bag-reduction regulations. Individual lengths from angler-caught sunfish as well as those collected by traditional survey nets have been completed during 2020/21 and earlier in order to determine progress towards the goals of the regulation. While fishing for sunfish it is best to limit harvesting the largest individuals, especially the males. Large males exhibit the best growth rates and also discourage the behavior of smaller, slower growing males from spawning. Studies show that it's important for sunfish to use their energy for body growth rather than gonadal development at a young age and small size. Male Bluegill can usually be discerned from females by their more pronounced coloration and darker orange breast. <br> \n <br> \nAt this time, Northern Pike abundance is not problematic in Moose Lake. Often times, small pike become over-abundant, causing negative impacts to other competitors and occasionally to the entire fish community. The average number of pike we see in the gill nets is about 2.9 fish/net which is below average for most lakes in the area. Currently, about 22% of the pike population is 28 inches or larger, better than many lakes similar in character. The average length in the sample was 23.7 inches. <br> \n <br> \nA total of 26 Black Crappies were caught in 2020 gill nets ranging in size from 5.9-12.2 inches. Yellow perch, an important prey species have been declining in abundance since 2004. This is not uncommon but somewhat puzzling given that Walleye and Northern Pike are not very abundant. Due to the small size of Moose Lake, it's possible that perch abundance can be impacted by lower levels of predation and/or the substantial bass population present.   <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>     A spring panfish assessment was conducted on Moose Lake in mid-May of 2012 to evaluate the black crappie and bluegill populations.  Panfish, especially bluegill, provide an important fisheries in the area as Moose Lake has a reputation of producing larger bluegill.  The black crappie population, although abundant, has typically been dominated by smaller fish.   Six standard lake survey trap nets were set and lifted twice for 12 net lifts.  All fish were identified and most measured with scales taken from the crappie and bluegill for age and growth data.  Previous spring panfish assessments were conducted in 2010, 2004, and 1999.  Also in 2012, a scheduled summer lake survey using gill nets was conducted in mid-July to evaluate the game fish populations. <br> \n     The 2012 spring assessment was very effective at catching black crappie, producing a record catch of 30.2/TN (n=362).   The fish measured from 4 - 10.7 inches in length with a mean length of 7.4 inches.  Crappie exceeding nine inches accounted for 4% (n=16) with 1% (n=5) more than ten inches in length.   Ages 2 through 6 were represented in the 2012 panfish catch.   All age groups displayed normal growth when compared to an Area Mean Back-calculated Length table.  A strong year class produced in 2009 (Age 3) accounted for 84% of the sample. <br> \n     Crappie trap net catches have increased in each panfish assessment since 1999, from 8.5/TN (n=85) in 1999 to 12.2/TN (n=146 in 2004, and then 22.1/TN (n=177) in 2010.  The 2010 panfish assessment had the most desirable population size structure of any of the catches.  The fish ranged from 7.8 to 10.9 inches in length with a mean length of 9.1 inches and modal length of 9 - 9.5 inches due to a strong 2005 year class (Age 5) which accounted for 50% of the catch.   Crappie exceeding nine inches comprised 57% (n=100) of the catch with 15% (n=26) more than ten inches in length.  The 1999 panfish assessment had 31% (n=26) of the crappie exceeding nine inches with 5% (n=4) more than ten inches in length.   While all but the 1999 panfish assessment met the lake management goal of maintaining a spring black crappie catch of at least ten per trap net, the 2010 assessment was the only one to meet the management goal of having at least 35% of the crappie exceeding nine inches in length. <br> \n     The gill nets in the 2012 summer lake survey were also effective at catching black crappies.  The 10.5/GN (n=63) catch was the second highest after the 1988 catch of 18.8/GN (n=113) and three times the 75% quartile of 3.5/GN for lake class 31.  All of the crappie in the 2012 catch were less than nine inches in length, however, the mean length was similar to that in the spring trap net catch at 7.3 inches.   As in the spring trap net catches, few of the crappie in the past gill net catches were over ten inches and only a single crappie over eleven inches  has ever been reported in any of the gear types.  An 11.4 inch black crappie was netted in the 2012 spring largemouth electrofishing effort. <br> \n     Spring electrofishing for largemouth bass proved to be an opportune time to catch black crappie.   One hundred twelve crappie were netted during the 2012 spring electrofishing.  The fish measured from 3.9 to 11.4 inches in length with a mean length of 7.4 inches.  That catch was also dominated by small fish as only 9% (n=10) of the crappie exceeded nine inches.    Six of the fish (5%) were more than ten inches in length.  Ages 2 through 7 were represented in the electrofishing sample.   All groups displayed normal growth when compared to an Area Mean Back-calculated Length table.  The 2009 year class (Age 3) was also prevalent in the electrofishing catch, comprising 78% of the sample.  Few black crappie over Age 5 were caught in any of the 2012 surveys suggesting high mortality after reaching nine inches, a size acceptable to most anglers. <br> \n     Although the 2012 bluegill catch was the lowest spring trap net catch to date, a substantial number of fish were caught.  The 2012 40.3/TN (n=484) was less than half of the second lowest catch of 88.2/TN (n=882) in the 1999 panfish assessment.  Catch rates were 123.5/TN (n=988) and 146.9/TN (n=1,763) in 2010 and 2004, respectively.   Bluegill in the 2012 assessment were between 3 and 8.2 inches in length with a mean length of 5.7 inches.   Modal length was 6 - 6.5 inches with 18% (n=85) exceeding seven inches and 1% (n=5) more than eight inches in length.   Ages 2 through 8 were represented in the 2012 bluegill catch.  Two year class from 2009 (Age 3) and 2008 (Age 4) accounted for 39% and 23% of the sample, respectively. <br> \n     The most desirable sample size structure was displayed in the 2010 bluegill catch.  The fish measured from 4.7 to 9.3 inches in length with a mean length of 7.1 inches and modal length of 6.5 - 7 inches.  Over half (51%; n=502) of the fish exceeded seven inches with 19% (n=186) over eight inches and 1% (n=12) more than nine inches in length.   Results from the 2012 panfish assessment represent a significant change in size structure occurring between 2010 and 2012.  The 2010 panfish assessment was the only spring assessment to produce a bluegill catch that met or exceeded the lake management goal of 20% of the fish exceeding seven inches in length.  All of the panfish assessments except the 2012 assessment met another goal of having some nine inch bluegill in the spring catch.  \t <br> \n      Game fish sampled in the 2012 panfish assessment included 21 largemouth bass, one northern pike, and four walleye.  The pike was 36.6 inches in length which was six inches longer than any of the northern pike caught in the 2012 summer survey.   Other fish species caught included bowfin, golden shiner, hybrid sunfish, pumpkinseed sunfish, yellow bullhead, and yellow perch.  Yellow bullhead (n=193) accounted for a significant portion of the spring trap net catch, being the third most abundant species behind bluegill and black crappie.  Species composition was more diverse in the 2012 spring trap net catch than the summer gill net catch.  Eleven species were caught in the spring compared to eight in the summer survey.  Species caught in the spring assessment and not in the summer survey included bowfin, hybrid sunfish, pumpkinseed sunfish, and yellow perch.  Black bullhead, however, were caught in the summer gill nets and not in the spring trap nets.</p>",

A Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MNDNR) owned concrete boat ramp is located on the northwest Shore. Moose Lake has 13.12 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 42 feet. Moose Lake is in Lake Class 25; lakes in this class are generally deep, have hard water, clear, and are an irregular shape. <br> \n <br> \nIn 2016 a survey targeted at Largemouth Bass was completed. Largemouth Bass abundance and was down comparted to previous years, but the size structure of the population was good with fish up to 18 inches captured. <br> \n <br> \nPeople can have significant impacts on lakes and the fish populations they support. Harvest, lakeshore development, removal of shoreline vegetation, and introductions of invasive species can all adversely affect fish populations. Curly Leaf Pondweed has been identified in Moose Lake. Aquatic invasive species (AIS) are moved from infested to non-infested waters by anglers, boaters, and lake shore owners and can adversely impact lakes and fish populations. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access. If you suspect an infestation of an invasive species in this lake, save a specimen and report it to a local natural resource office. Additional information on all of these topics can be found on the DNR website (www.dnr.state.mn.us) or by contacting the Little Falls Area Fisheries office. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A special regulation was introduced on Moose Lake in 2016 that reduces the possession limit of Bluegill from the statewide limit of 20 fish to ten fish in an effort to improve the size structure of the Bluegill fishery. This targeted survey is intended to evaluate the effect of the regulation by using trap nets during the month of May to assess current population size structure attributes.  <br> \n  <br> \nA total of 272 Bluegills were caught (24.3 fish/net). Measured lengths ranged from 3.5-9.8 inches, with 11 percent of the catch exceeding nine inches. The percentage of large Bluegills caught in 2018 is much higher than in 2017 however it appears that an increasing trend in the abundance of large Bluegill began prior to regulation introduction (2012). At this time, it's too early to attribute any shifts in the average size of Bluegill to the regulation, however, additional trap netting surveys are planned and future data are expected to indicate the success or failure of this management strategy. Anglers can assist DNR in helping to improve Moose Lake's Bluegill fishery by adhering to the special regulation and by voluntarily releasing Bluegill exceeding nine inches.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Moose Lake is a popular panfish lake north of Burtrum along Highway 28.  Bluegills and black crappies provide fishing opportunities all year round.  Spring time seems to be the most popular time for walleye fishing on the lake.  While the lake does not have alot of structure, there is a sunken island near the north end.  Water quality has been a problem in the lake, with algae blooms common in the summer.      Fish populations have shown some dramatic changes since the last survey in 1993.  Two of the most significant changes have been the increase in northern pike numbers and decrease in yellow perch.  Typically when pike numbers are high, the average size tends to be smaller because of the increased competition for food.  A fair number of the northern pike, however, sampled in the survey continued to be over 24 inches in length.  While the perch population remains within the normal range for lakes similar to Moose Lake, the lower yellow perch abundance could have a negative impact on the fish community in the lake.  Perch are an important food species for both northern pike and walleye.  They can also be instrumental in helping maintain a well balanced bluegill population with fast growing, quality individuals.     The primary management species for Moose Lake is largemouth bass.  An experimental regulation limiting the size of bass in possession to 12 inches or under is in effect on the lake.  The goal of the regulation is to increase the number of largemouth bass over 17 inches while allowing the harvest of bass under 12 inches which are more numerous.     Walleye numbers were down from those seen in 1993 but the quality remains good.  All the walleye captured were over 18 inches in length, suggesting no recent recruitment from stocking.  Moose Lake appears to have little or no natural reproduction of walleye as all aged fish corresponded with stocking years.  The lake is presently on an every other year stocking schedule with fingerlings.      Bluegill and black crappie are abundant when compared to lakes similar to Moose.  The crappies all showed fast growth, but all fish seen in the summer survey were under 10 inches in length.  Bluegills over 6 inches were common in the summer survey and fish over nine inches have been observed during spring electrofishing.     Other species in the fish community include black, brown, and yellow bullheads, bowfin or dogfish, hybrid sunfish, and pumpkinseeds.  Bullheads over eleven inches were common in the summer survey.          Neascus or black spot was common on yellow perch and some bluegill and northern pike.  Neascus is a trematode or parasite that is usually found in the skin of the fish.  The life cycle of the parasite also includes snails and fish-eating birds, such as herons and bitterns.  Skinning the fish removes most of the parasites and cooking will kill the rest.  Humans cannot be infested.     Water quality in Moose Lake is a major concern.  Surrounding land use practices are having a detrimental effect on the water and recreational value of the lake.  Releasing larger northern pike and walleye is encouraged along with selective harvest of bluegills and crappies to work toward a more balanced fish community.            </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>The current fish community structure of Moose Lake exhibits many desirablecharacteristics.  The lake continues to support a yellow perch population that iswell above the normal range for lake class 34.  High perch abundance provides anexcellent prey base for predators and limits overproduction of bluegills which mayenhance growth.  Northern pike gillnet catches in 1993 were near the median for thelake class, however numerous pike in the 8 to 10 inch range were observedsuggesting the potential for a dramatic population increase.  Additional increasesin pikeabundance could be detrimental to the perch population and pike growth rates whichare very good at the present time.  Pike up to 39 inches were captured in the 1993survey.  The walleye gillnet catch has declined since 1988 but is still within thenormal range for the lake class.  Nearly half the catch was comprised of fish over20 inches long.  Electrofishing results suggest  Moose Lake has a relativelyabundant bass population dominated by fish in the 8 to 12 inch range.  Reproductionis consistently good but growth rates are relatively slow.  Moose Lake is beingexamined to determine if experimental bass regulations could be used to increasethe abundance of larger bass.  The bluegill trapnet catch fell within the normalrange for lake class 34.  Large bluegill (7+ inches) were not well represented insummer trapnets, however electrofishing observations and angler reports indicategood numbers of 7 to 9 inch fish are available.  The black crappie trapnet catchin 1993 was the lowest on record though the catch was considered normal for lakesof this type.  Anglers continue to report good crappie fishing year-round. Increasing development is expected to occur on Moose Lake as many new lots havebeen plotted.  Minimizing the impacts of new developments on the riparian zone willbe necessary to ensure protection of the fishery.  Water quality of Moose Lake isimpacted by land use practices within the lake's watershed (primarily agricultural)and warrants concern. </p>",
