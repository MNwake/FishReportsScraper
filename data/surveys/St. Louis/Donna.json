                "narrative": "<p>Donna is an 18 acre lake located 15 miles north of Two Harbors, MN on the Drummond Grade (County Rd. 611).  The lake lies adjacent to the Drummond Grade and can be accessed by the right-of-way off of the road.  Maximum depth is 9 feet. Donna was surveyed during the summer of 2019 to evaluate and update information about fish populations, and to evaluate the effectiveness of the Brown Trout stocking program. <br> \n <br> \nAlmost 3,000 yearling Brown Trout have been stocked into the lake since 2017. The Brown Trout gillnet abundance was 10 per net and exceeds the management plan goal of 1 per gillnet.  The average length was 10.4 inches and the largest Brown Trout measured was 11.8 inches. Brown Trout trapnet abundance was 4.0 per net and the average length was 10.4 inches. Stocked Brown Trout appear to be overwintering in Donna Lake, and should provide a unique fishing opportunity for this area. <br> \n <br> \nIn past surveys, small numbers of Brook Trout were present which likely originated from the designated trout stream at the outlet of Donna Lake.  Brook Trout were not observed in either the gillnet or trapnets in 2019. <br> \n <br> \nWhite Sucker and Creek Chubs were also sampled in the trapnets. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Donna is an 18 acre lake located 15 miles north of Two Harbors, MN on the Drummond Grade (County Rd. 611).  The lake lies adjacent to the Drummond Grade and can be accessed by the right-of-way off of the road.  Maximum depth is 9 feet.  Prior to this investigation, Donna had not been surveyed by MN DNR.  Donna was surveyed during the summer of 2013 to gather baseline information about fish populations. <br> \n <br> \nBrook trout abundance was 0.5 per gillnet in 2013.  One specimen was captured that measured 11.0 inches.  The fish was aged to the 2010 year-class.  Not enough individuals were sampled to evaluate stock density or growth.   <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch gillnet abundance of 0.5 per lift was below average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  One specimen was captured that measured 7.1 inches.  The fish was aged to the 2010 year-class.  Not enough individuals were sampled to evaluate stock density or growth.   <br> \n <br> \nWhite sucker gillnet abundance of 5.0 per lift was average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Average length was 7.9 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species sampled included creek chub, Iowa darter, black bullhead, blacknose shiner, bluntnose minnow, brook stickleback, central mudminnow, fathead minnow and northern redbelly dace. <br> \n <br> \nInformation was collected on aquatic vegetation, substrates and water quality.  Twenty aquatic plant species or species groups were identified along 10 transects.  Yellow waterlily was the most frequently found plant species (90% of transects) followed by bladderwort and smartweed (80% of transects).  The most common substrate types were detritus, sand and silt which were identified along 90%, 70% and 70% of the transects, respectively.  Results of laboratory water analysis indicate Donna is an alkaline, moderately hard water lake with low fertility. <br> \n <br> \nAdditional information is needed before deciding to manage this lake for trout.  Data loggers will be deployed into Donna in 2014 to acquire water temperature data which will aide in determining if trout would survive if stocked.</p>",
