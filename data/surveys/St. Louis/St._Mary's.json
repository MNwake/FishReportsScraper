                "narrative": "<p>St. Mary's Lake is a 234 acre lake located two miles south of Eveleth.  It is accessed by a ramp on the north side of the lake on land owned by the city of Eveleth.  The ramp is not a MNDNR designated public access but is open for public use.  Caution should be used as the ramp is relatively close to Miller Trunk Road and the short gravel ramp to the lake is quite steep.  Only vehicles with 4-wheel drive capabilities should attempt to launch boats.  \n\nSt. Mary's has a maximum depth of 44 feet and clear water.  On July 29, 2019 the lake was thermally stratified with a surface temperature of 74 F and a bottom temperature of 47 F.  Oxygen levels were adequate for gamefish to a depth of 26 feet where the temperature was 51 degrees.  The lake is relatively developed with year round and seasonal homes.  The Eveleth Golf Course is located adjacent to the western shore and St. Mary's is also used as the city of Eveleth's municipal water supply.  Lake bottom substrates along the shoreline are mostly gravel and sand with some muck in the bays.  In addition to parts of the shoreline being rimmed by cattail, some of the bays contain moderate amounts of aquatic vegetation.  There are no major inlets or outlets to the lake.\n\nDating back to 1941 St. Mary's was stocked with \"bass\", largemouth bass, \"crappie\", northern pike, and walleye.  More recently walleye have been stocked by permit on an every other year basis by a private citizen group.  \n\nThe overall gillnet catch rate for all fish combined in this survey was 17.0 fish/net which was the lowest on record for the lake.  Yield however, was 28.9 lbs/net which was above average compared to past surveys on the lake.  Fish species sampled were largemouth bass, cisco, walleye, northern pike, black crappie, bluegill, white sucker, hybrid sunfish, and rock bass.   Trap nets caught fish at an overall rate of 22.3 fish/net which was the second lowest on record for the lake.  Yield was 5.2 lbs/net which was also the second lowest on record.  Additional fish species sampled in trap nets that weren't already represented in the gill nets were brown bullhead, golden shiner, and pumpkinseed.  \n\nFourteen walleye were sampled in gill nets for a catch rate of 2.3 fish/net, which was below average compared to other similar lakes in the state and the lowest catch rate on record since walleye were stocked in the lake.  Lengths ranged from 10 to 24 inches with an average of 17 inches.  This average length was better than past catches and the largest walleye sampled in this survey was the largest sampled to date.  Average weight was 2 pounds which was quite good compared to other similar lakes.  Growth rates were average when compared to other walleye lakes in the area, taking 4 years for the average walleye to approach 14 inches long.  Ages ranged from 2 to 15 years with six year classes represented.  All fish, except the 15 year old individual, came from years when stocking occurred.  \n\nThe northern pike gillnet catch rate was 2.0 fish/net which was average compared to past surveys of the lake.  Lengths ranged from 22 to 37 inches with an average of 28 inches, which was better than past surveys.  The mean weight was over 5 pounds which was very good compared to other similar lakes.\n\nElectrofishing was used for the first time on St. Mary's Lake for largemouth bass sampling.  One-hundred thirty-five largemouth were captured in the 1.33 hours of fishing for a catch rate of 101.3 fish/hour.  This was a very good catch rate when compared against other largemouth bass lakes.  Lengths ranged from nearly 3 to just over 16 inches with an average of 12 inches.  Over 65% of the catch was 12 inches or longer.  Growth appeared very slow with it taking the average bass 11 years to grow to 14 inches long.  Some fish were aged up to 16 years old.  \n\nThe black crappie trapnet catch was 1.6 fish/net which was slightly below average compared to other similar lakes and tied for the lowest catch rate on record for St. Mary's.  Lengths ranged from 4 to just over 10 inches with an average of nearly 8 inches.  Ages ranged from 1 to 7 with the strongest year class from 2012.  Growth rates were quite slow taking 8 years for crappie to average over 8 inches.    \n\nThe bluegill trapnet catch was 12.1 fish/net which was above average compared to other similar lakes, but low compared to past surveys on St. Mary's.  Sizes ranged from 3 to just over 7 inches with an average of nearly 6 inches.  Over 74% of the bluegill were between 5.5 and 7.5 inches.  Ages ranged from 2 to 8 years with strong representation from the 2012 year class.  Growth was very slow taking over 7 years to reach 6 inches.  Additionally, 57 hybrid sunfish were sampled for a catch rate of 6.3 fish/net.  The size structure of hybrids was slightly better than the bluegill with 75% of the catch measuring over 6.5 inches.  The maximum length was nearly 8.5 inches.\n\nOther species sampled in low numbers were cisco, rock bass, white sucker, brown bullhead, golden shiner, and pumpkinseed.\n\nSome of the walleye and northern pike had moderate neascus (black spot) infestations but bluegill, a typically susceptible species, showed very few individuals being infested. \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>St. Mary's Lake is a 249-acre lake with a maximum depth of 44 feet located two miles south of Eveleth next to state highway 53 in central St. Louis County.  There is no designated public access on the lake.  The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical and chemical characteristics.  St. Mary's Lake is in lake class 5.  Other area lakes in the same lake class include Armstrong, Eagles Nest Lakes, Ely, Esquagama, and Pleasant Lakes.  Lakes in this lake class are typically deep, and have soft, clear water.  Private stocking of walleye was conducted in 2007 (fry) and 2009 (fingerling). <br> \n <br> \nIn 2011, walleye abundance was comparable to what you would find in class 5 lakes.  Walleye ranged in length from 9.5 to 20.8 inches with a mean length and weight of 13.2 inches and 0.90 pound.  The size structure of walleye was influenced by the 2009 stocking.  Twenty-four of the 33 walleye sampled were from the 2009 year class.  Walleye grew slowly.  At age three, a typical St. Mary's walleye was 11.6 inches long. <br> \n  <br> \nNorthern pike abundance was also typical of other class 5 lakes.  Northern pike displayed excellent quality ranging from 21.6 inches to 35.8 inches with a mean length and weight of 28.4 inches and 5.6 pounds.  There were reports of bigger pike being caught by anglers.  Five year classes were identified.  Growth was exceptional.  At age three, a typical St. Mary's Lake pike was 24.8 inches long compared to the Tower area mean of 19 inches. <br> \n <br> \nIn 1986, bluegill reached their highest abundance but then declined somewhat in 2011. The 2011 abundance is still above what you would typically find in class 5 lakes.  Bluegill was generally small ranging from 3.2 to 7.1 inches with only 1% greater than or equal to seven inches.  Seven different year classes were identified with the 2006 year class (age five) composing 48% of the catch.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie is abundant in St. Mary's Lake, well above what you would typically find in class 5 lakes.  Crappie ranged in length from 3.7 inches to 10.2 inches with a mean length and weight of 7.4 inches and 0.24 pound.  Year classes 2004 through 2010 were all present in the catch indicating consistent recruitment.  Growth was slightly below average.  After four years of growth, a typical St. Mary's crappie was 6.0 inches long compared to the area mean of 6.6 inches. <br> \n <br> \nIn 2011, hybrid sunfish, a cross between bluegill and pumpkinseed, were abundant in St. Mary's Lake.  Hybrid sunfish were generally bigger than bluegill averaging 6.3 inches long.   <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass was also abundant with 46 bass captured in 2011 assessment.  Bass ranged in length from 4.7 inches to 15.1 inches.  Seven different year classes were identified with no particularly strong year class.  Growth was below average.  After four years of growth, bass were 8 inches long compared to the area mean of 9.2 inches.  Rock bass and pumpkinseed were two other members of the sunfish family that were caught in low numbers. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled in 2011 include yellow perch, white sucker, and cisco (tullibee). <br> \n <br> \nSt. Mary's Lake was selected for fish index of biotic integrity (IBI) sampling.  This index is designed to help determine the overall health of the biological fish community of the lake.  This type of sampling will typically capture the non-game species and young-of-year game species.  Eleven different species were identified.  Johnny darter, blacknose shiner, golden shiner, and brook stickleback were non-game species sampled.  Bluegill, largemouth bass, rock bass, and yellow perch young-of-year were also sampled. <br> \n</p>",
