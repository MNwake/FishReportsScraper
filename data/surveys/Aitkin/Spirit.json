The gillnet index for northern pike is above the third regional quartile. The trap net index for bowfin is above the third regional quartile. The trap net indices for black bullhead and black crappie are below their third regional quartiles. Tullibee ranged from seven to eight plus years of age. All growth increments analyzed showed normal growth rates. Northern pike ranged from one to eight plus years of age strong year classes indicated from 1984, 1985 and 1986. Growth rates for the second, third, fourth, fifth and seventh growth increments were within the normal growth range. The growth rates for the sixth and eighth growth increments were twenty-three and thirty three percent faster than normal. Bluegill ranged from two to eight years of age with strong year classes indicated from 1982, 1983 and 1984. The growth rates for the second and third growth increments were fifty-four and forty percent slower than normal, respectively. The growth rates for the sixth, seventh and eighth growth increments ranged from thirty to fifty percent faster than normal. Largemouth bass ranged from two to seven years of age. Growth rates appeared to be normal. Black crappie ranged from one to six years of age. Growth rates for the fourth, fifth and sixth growth increments were from thirty three to forty percent faster than normal. Walleye ranged from two to six years of age with a strong year class indicated from 1984, which corresponds to the 1985 stocking of 1+ walleyes. Growth rates appeared to be normal. The gillnet index for walleye indicates a significant increase in abundance since 1981, based on nine gillnets. The trap net index for bluegill indicates an apparent decrease in abundance since the 1981 survey.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Spirit Lake is located six miles south of Aitkin and is one of ten lakes that comprise the Ripple River watershed.  Spirit Lake has diverse habitats that provide angling opportunities for most anglers.  Panfish anglers can find both bluegill and black crappie in good numbers.  As a result of consistently high recruitment, younger bluegill exhibit slower than normal growth rates. On average, bluegill were about 5.5 inches in length.  Growth rates for fish that survive beyond four years of age improve, and several fish over eight-inches in length were sampled in 2006.  Black crappie also exhibited uniform recruitment with an occasional stronger year class. The average black crappie is about nine inches long and weighs about one-half pound.  Several crappies were caught that approached 13 inches in length.  For those anglers after larger prey, there are northern pike, walleye and largemouth bass. Northern pike abundance is high for this lake type, but is similar to that observed in previous surveys.  A higher than normal abundance is the result of consistently high recruitment.  The western end of the lake is a large wild rice bed, which provides prime northern pike spawning habitat. The high annual recruitment results in a small average size of about 19 inches.  The small average size is due to large numbers of young fish.  Growth rates are good and several northern pike over 25 inches were caught.  The largest northern pike sampled was almost 35 inches in length. The walleye population is maintained by fingerling stocking on alternate years.  Age analysis indicates that there was no recruitment from natural reproduction.  While walleye are not overly abundant, a wide range of sizes are available to the angler.  The largest walleye sampled was almost 25 inches in length.  Fishing can be good for those anglers targeting largemouth bass. Largemouth bass sampled averaged about 12 inches in length and weighed just under one-pound.  The longest largemouth bass sampled was over 15 inches long.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Spirit Lake is located approximately six miles south of Aitkin and is one of ten lakes that comprise the Ripple River watershed.  The lake is 530 acres with nearly half the lake being less than 15 feet deep and a maximum depth of 49 feet.  There is a designated public access at the outlet on the south end of the lake.  Shallow water substrates consist primarily of sand, gravel, and rubble, though areas of boulders, muck, and clay are present as well.  The aquatic plant community is quite diverse with 45 species present and is integral to maintaining good water quality as well as maintaining healthy fish populations.  Emergent plants such as bulrush are important for shoreline protection, maintaining water quality, and provide essential spawning habitat for bass and panfish species.  Submerged plants provide food and cover needed by fish and other aquatic species.   <br> \n <br> \nSpirit Lake has been stocked with walleyes in alternate years since 1985.  Rates varied from 1-2 pounds per littoral acre.  The 2010 walleye catch of 1.9/gill net was similar to past catches on Spirit, which average 1.8/gill net, but remains below average when compared to other similar lakes.  Average length and weight were 16.8\" and 1.7 lbs.  Walleye spawning does occur in the Ripple River at the outlet to Spirit Lake, although any successfully reproduced walleye cannot re-enter Spirit Lake due to the water control structure, which inhibits fish movement in low water periods of the summer. <br> \n <br> \nThe northern pike catch was above average when compared to similar lakes at 13.6/gill net in 2010.  Past catches have ranged from 2.5 to 18.0/gill net with an average of 9.2/gill net.  Average length and weight were 18.1\" and 1.5 lbs with 13% measuring at least 24\".   <br> \n <br> \nSpring electrofishing resulted in a largemouth bass catch rate of 67/hr, which is higher than observed in 1998 (18/hr).  Average length of these fish was 11.8\" with fish over 18\" sampled.  The gill net catch of largemouth bass continues to increase with an above average catch of 1.8/gill net in 2010. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch and tullibee are important forage species for the lake's game fish.  Yellow perch were sampled in low numbers in 2010 at 1.4/gill net.  Past catches have ranged as high as 18.4/gill net, though the average is 3.5/gill net.  The tullibee catch of 2.1/gill net was average when compared to similar lakes.  Average length of these fish was 10.7\" with fish over 16\" present. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill were caught in average numbers at 8.8/trap net.  Black crappie abundance has generally been decreasing, though the gill net catch of 2.4/net still remains good when compared to similar lakes.  Additionally, while the overall catches of crappie are lower than previous years, catches of larger crappie (>10\") are more prevalent than in the earlier years of the time series.  Past catches have ranged up to 14.3/gill net with an average of 4.6/gill net.   Panfish size structure is generally good with several year classes present. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Spirit Lake is located approximately six miles south of Aitkin and is one of ten lakes that comprise the Ripple River watershed.  The lake is 530 acres with nearly half the lake being less than 15 feet deep and a maximum depth of 49 feet.  There is a designated public access at the outlet on the south end of the lake.  Shallow water substrates consist primarily of sand, gravel, and rubble, though areas of boulders, muck, and clay are present as well.  The aquatic plant community is quite diverse with 45 species present and is integral to maintaining good water quality as well as maintaining healthy fish populations.  Emergent plants such as bulrush, as well as coarse woody habitat such as downed trees, are important for shoreline protection, maintaining water quality, and to provide essential spawning habitat for bass, panfish, and yellow perch.  Submerged plants provide food and cover needed by fish and other aquatic species.  <br> \n  <br> \nSpirit Lake has been stocked with walleyes since 1985.   Currently walleye fry are stocked annually, with additional fingerling stocking in odd years if fall electrofish catches are low.  The 2015 walleye catch of 0.8/gill net was below past catches on Spirit, which average 1.8/gill net, and is below average when compared to other similar lakes.  Average length and weight were 15.8\" and 1.2 lbs.  Walleye spawning does occur in the Ripple River at the outlet to Spirit Lake, although any successfully reproduced walleye cannot re-enter Spirit Lake due to the water control structure, which inhibits fish movement in low water periods of the summer. <br> \nThe northern pike abundance was above average when compared to similar lakes at 10.2/gill net in 2015.  Past catches have ranged from 2.5 to 18.0/gill net with an average of 9.8/gill net.  Average length and weight were 19.5\" and 1.7 lbs with 13% measuring at least 24\".  Anglers are encouraged to release the larger pike as they have beneficial effects on the fish community. <br> \n <br> \nSpring electrofishing resulted in a largemouth bass catch rate of 45.5/hr, which is slightly lower than observed in 2010 (67/hr).  Average length of these fish was 11.6\" with fish up to 19.5\" sampled. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill were caught in average numbers at 12.4/trap net.  Black crappie abundance was above average when compared to similar lakes.  Additionally, while the gill net catches of crappie are lower than previous years, catches of larger crappie (>10\") are more prevalent than in previous surveys.  Panfish size structure is generally good with several year classes present. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch and tullibee are important forage species for the lake's game fish.  Yellow perch were sampled in low numbers in 2015 at 1.4/gill net.  Past catches have ranged as high as 18.4/gill net, though the average is 3.1/gill net.  The tullibee catch of 0.9/gill net was below average when compared to similar lakes, although similar to past catch rates at Spirit Lake. Water quality, in terms of dissolved oxygen and temperature, offer only marginal habitat for tullibee in Spirit Lake. This issue will be exacerbated with a warming climate, which emphasizes the need for sound management in the shoreland as well as in the remainder of the watershed.  <br> \n</p>",

This survey was completed in addition to the standard survey conducted the week of July 13, 2015. Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake (14 stations) and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible. Species information was gathered as part of a statewide project to evaluate the fish Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) for Minnesota lakes. IBI program staff completed an additional repeat assessment that is meant to provide a means to evaluate quality control of sampling protocols (see Spirit 6/16/2015).  <br> \n <br> \nBackpack electrofishing was completed at all 14 stations, but two sites were sampled from the boat due to unstable footing. A 50-foot seine was used to sample 5 stations, a 15-foot seine was used at 7 stations, and site conditions prevented the use of seines at 2 sites. Nearshore sampling captured several intolerant fish species including blackchin shiner, blacknose shiner, banded killifish, Iowa darter, mottled sculpin, and rock bass. <br> \n <br> \nSpirit lake falls within lake class 27 based on the Schupp lake classification system used by MnDNR and within Group 2 lakes for evaluating IBI data. IBI scores range from 0 to 100 and the draft impairment threshold for this group of lakes is 45 (90% CI 36-54) and the potential exceptional quality level is set at 64. The IBI score, using standard gill net and trap net data from the 2015 resurvey, calculated from this survey was 62. The survey conducted by IBI program staff, using standard gill net and trap net data from the 2015 standard assessment, resulted in a score of 56.2. Both of these scores were well above the impairment threshold indicating good overall fish community health.</p>",

Fall night electrofishing was conducted on September 7, 2017. The total sample time was 1.5 hours with no YOY or age-1 walleye sampled. A single adult walleye was captured and was 28.4 inches long. Fry stocking began in 2012, and the continued use of fall electrofishing may be useful in determining the effectiveness of the current fry with contingent fingerling stocking strategy.  Currently it appears that fry survival is minimal in this system based on fall electrofishing results from 2013, 2015 and 2017. This stocking strategy will be fully evaluated following a population assessment in 2019. </p>",

Sampling by electrofishing and short term mono gill nets was also conducted in lakes located immediately downstream (Little Pine, Hickory, and Spirit) to document movement among basins.  A total of 6 walleyes were marked via electrofishing in Spirit by removal of the first three dorsal spines and a left pelvic clip.  No recapture sampling (via short term mono gill nets) was done in Spirit, although none of the 6 marked fish were observed in any other basin.  One fish marked in Hickory was recaptured while bass electrofishing on 5-19-2010 on Spirit.  Additional information can be found in the 8/02/2010 population assessment report for Farm Island Lake.</p>",

Comparing profiles collected from 2011-2018, the best conditions for tullibee occurred in 2013 and 2015 although still only marginal compared to other lakes in the area that are monitored. Because the Aitkin area is located near the southern edge of Minnesota's tullibee range, TDO profiles should continue to be collected to monitor the availability of coldwater habitat.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Spirit Lake is located approximately six miles south of Aitkin and is one of ten lakes that comprise the Ripple River watershed. The lake is 530 acres with nearly half the lake being less than 15 feet deep and a maximum depth of 49 feet. There is a designated public access at the outlet on the south end of the lake. Shallow water substrates consist primarily of sand, gravel, and rubble, though areas of boulders, muck, and clay are present as well. The aquatic plant community is quite diverse with 45 species present and is integral to maintaining good water quality as well as maintaining healthy fish populations. Emergent plants such as bulrush, as well as coarse woody habitat such as downed trees, are important for shoreline protection, maintaining water quality, and to provide essential spawning habitat for bass, panfish, and Yellow Perch. Submerged plants provide food and cover needed by fish and other aquatic species.  <br> \n  <br> \nWalleye have been stocked in alternate years as fingerlings, yearlings, or adults in Spirit Lake since 1969. A Walleye fry stocking strategy was implemented from 2012-2019 but after several evaluations it was determined they didn't appreciably contribute to the fishery. There will be a three year period where no Walleye will be stocked so the lake and its forage base can reset and fingerling stocking will resume again in 2024. The 2019 Walleye catch of 0.8/gill net was below past catches on Spirit, which averages 1.5/gill net, and is below average when compared to other similar lakes. Average length and weight were 17.5\" and 1.9 lbs. Walleye spawning does occur in the Ripple River at the outlet to Spirit Lake, although any successfully reproduced Walleye cannot re-enter Spirit Lake due to the water control structure, which inhibits fish movement in low water periods of the summer. <br> \n <br> \nThe Northern Pike abundance was above average when compared to similar lakes at 11.1/gill net in 2019. Past catches have ranged from 2.5 to 18.0/gill net with an average of 9.9/gill net. Average length and weight were 19.2\" and 1.7 lbs., with 21% measuring at least 24\". Anglers are encouraged to release the larger pike as they have beneficial effects on the fish community. <br> \n <br> \nThe 2019 gill net catch of Largemouth Bass showed an increase from the previous survey and like many area lakes shows an increasing trend over time. A gill net catch rate of 2.0/gill net is the highest on record. Past catches ranged from 0-2.0/gill net with an average of 0.9/gill net. Size structure was good with an average size of 12.5 inches and a maximum size of 17.7 inches. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill were caught in average numbers at 9.5/trap net. Black Crappie abundance was above average when compared to similar lakes and comparable to recent surveys. Additionally, catches of larger crappie (>10\") are more prevalent over the last two surveys. Panfish size structure is generally good with several year classes present. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch and Tullibee are important forage species for the lake's game fish. Yellow Perch were sampled in low numbers in 2019 at 0.7/gill net. Past catches have ranged as high as 18.4/gill net, though the average is 2.7/gill net. The Tullibee catch of 0.1/gill net was below average when compared to similar lakes, and was the lowest catch recorded at Spirit Lake to date. Water quality, in terms of dissolved oxygen and temperature, offer only marginal habitat for Tullibee in Spirit Lake. This issue will be exacerbated with a warming climate, which emphasizes the need for sound management in the shoreland as well as in the remainder of the watershed. <br> \n</p>",

Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible.  Backpack electrofishing was completed at all 14 sampling stations, a 50-foot seine was used to sample 10 stations and a 15-foot seine was used at 2 stations, and site conditions prevented the use of seines at 2 sites due to abundant vegetation and soft sediments.  Nearshore sampling captured 16 species of fish including several species that are intolerant of shoreline disturbance and/or poor water quality (Banded Killifish, Iowa Darter, Mottled Sculpin, Logperch, and Rock Bass).   <br> \n <br> \nThe near shore fish survey data is combined with gillnet and trapnet data from a July 2015 survey to describe the fish community and provide a fish-based Index of Biotic Integrity (FIBI) score based on expectations for similar lakes. The FIBI score for Spirit Lake is well above an impairment threshold developed for similar lakes; of note was the diversity and abundance of small benthic species captured in nearshore sampling gears. <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to a watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency. Spirit Lake is located in the Mississippi River - Brainerd Watershed.  A review of stressor information found low watershed disturbance (15% - NLCD 2011 data) and a 2015 Score the Shore Survey assessed the shoreline habitat as fair; there are approximately 14 docks/km of shoreline. <br> \n</p>",

Comparing profiles collected from 2011-2016, the best conditions for tullibee occurred in 2013 and 2015, although still only marginal compared to other lakes in the area that are monitored. Because the Aitkin area is located near the southern edge of Minnesota's tullibee range, TDO profiles should continue to be collected to monitor the availability of coldwater habitat.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Spirit Lake contains a diverse plant community and bottom substrate, which tends to produce a stable and diverse fish community and fishery. Anglers can seek and find walleyes, northern pike, bluegills, black crappies, largemouth bass, tulibees and bullheads, and use a variety of techniques to pursue their catch. There are rocky outcroppings, areas of heavy vegetation, even marshy shorelines to probe. Cultural development on the lake is high and probably becoming limited by available shoreline.    The walleyes are doing as well as in any of the previous surveys, due largely to stocking. Survey catches, at 3.5 walleyes per net, were barely within the range considered normal for this lake type. The mean length was a desirable 16.4 inches and fish up to 26.1 inches were caught. The strongest year classes were those in which larger fingerlings or yearlings were stocked. Northern pike predation substantially reduces survival of smaller walleyes in the lake. Natural reproduction appears to be very limited.    Northern pike abundance is higher than in previous surveys. Slow growth rates of older fish and high mortality rates have resulted in a small mean length of 18.3 inches and few fish reaching a size preferred by anglers. The appearance of older and larger fish up to 31.6 inches long in this survey may be the result of a change in angler attitude and an increase in catch and release of larger fish.     Black crappies were caught at a below-normal rate of abundance in this survey and are produced sporadically. Most of the fish caught were two years old and small. No crappies were caught in the trap nets, which are fished near shore. Survey catches of crappies has been low since 1981, coincident with increased walleye stocking which began in 1985.     Bluegill catch decreased from the 1992 survey to this survey, yet slow growth continues and few fish reach 7 inches. The mean length of bluegills in this survey was only 5.7 inches and the maximum size was only 7.7 inches. Production of new fish, or recruitment, is regular. Stunting, or slow growth and small mean size, will continue into the forseeable future.    Abundance of yellow perch is up from 2.4 fish per net in 1992 to 4.9 per net in this survey, yet is still below normal for this type of lake. The ages and sizes of yellow perch are varied and there are a few fish in the 9 inch range, yet most of the fish are six to seven inches long. Perch in the lake also tend to contain many parasites, which makes them unacceptable to many anglers.    The largemouth bass catch was low, as it has been in most survey nettings. Tulibees were also caught at low rates. Both species may require specialized sampling to assess and this specialized work was not completed in this survey. Forage, including yellow perch, tulibees and white suckers, have historically been low in Spirit Lake, with few exceptions. Abundant northern pike may be reducing the forage base. Walleye stocking has not noticably affected the forage base. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p> Walleye have been stocked in alternate years as fingerlings, yearlings, or adults in Spirit Lake since 1969. From 2005 to 2011, 2 pounds per littoral acre were stocked in alternate (odd-numbered) years. Annual fry stocking of 260,000 fry/year started in 2012, with fall electrofishing conducted in odd years to monitor fry survival. Acceptable levels of fry survival were not documented during fall electrofishing in 2013, 2015 or 2017 so fingerlings or yearlings were stocked in 2013(FGL), 2015(YRL) and 2017(FGL). \n\nWalleye gill net catches during the 10 previous nettings have ranged from 0.6 to 3.5/net with mean and median values of 1.7 and 1.6/net, respectively. The 2017 walleye catch rate of 0.6/gill net was the lowest on record and below the management goal of 3-8/gill net. Mean length and weight were 15.8\" and 1.6 lbs in 2017.  Five year classes were present, which met the management goal of 4 year classes, however only 5 total walleye were caught. Analysis of stocking records indicates that one of the five of the walleyes (2015 year class) may have originated from a fry stocking since no fingerlings were stocked that year. The current stocking strategy will be fully evaluated following a 2019 standard survey, however at the moment it appears fry stocking is not contributing much to the fishery. Walleye spawning does occur in the Ripple River at the outlet to Spirit Lake, although any successfully reproduced walleye cannot re-enter Spirit Lake due to the water control structure, which inhibits upstream fish movement in low water periods of the summer.\n\n\n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Spirit Lake is located approximately six miles south of Aitkin and is one of nine lakes in Aitkin County that comprise the Ripple River watershed. The lake is 530 acres with nearly half the lake being less than 15 feet deep and a maximum depth of 49 feet. There is a designated public access at the outlet on the south end of the lake. Shallow water substrates consist primarily of sand, gravel, and rubble, though areas of boulders, muck, and clay are present as well. The aquatic plant community is quite diverse with 45 species present and is integral to maintaining good water quality as well as maintaining healthy fish populations. A substantial wild rice bed on the southwest shore, along with other emergent plants such as bulrush, as well as coarse woody habitat such as downed trees, are all important for shoreline protection, maintaining water quality, and to provide essential spawning habitat for bass, panfish, and Yellow Perch. Submerged plants provide food and cover needed by fish and other aquatic species. \n \nWalleye have been stocked in Spirit Lake since 1965.  Since 1989, they have primarily been stocked in alternate years as fingerlings, with some yearlings and adults. Walleye fry were also stocked 2012-2019, but after several surveys it was determined they hadn't appreciably contributed to the fishery. Walleye stocking was then suspended for 3 years to help reset the forage base. Annual fingerling stocking resumed in the fall of 2023, but at a much lower rate than before so to not tax the forage. The 2023 Walleye catch rate of 1.2 per gill net was similar to past catches on Spirit, which average 1.5 per gill net, although was below typical levels when compared to other similar lakes. Average length and weight were 20.4 inches and 3 pounds. This large size is indicative of the break in stocking from 2020-2022, with no small fish present in the sample. While Walleye spawning does occur in the Ripple River at the outlet to Spirit Lake, any successfully reproduced Walleye cannot re-enter Spirit Lake due to the water control structure, which inhibits fish movement in low water periods of the summer.\n\nThe Northern Pike abundance was above average when compared to similar lakes at 10 per gill net in 2023, yet was similar to the last 4 surveys and average for Spirit Lake. Past catch rates have ranged from 2.5 to 18.0 per gill net with an average of 9.9 per gill net. Average length and weight were 19 inches and 1.8 pounds, with 16% measuring at least 26 inches . Anglers are encouraged to release the larger pike as they have beneficial effects on the fish community.\n\nLargemouth Bass abundance based in both gill net and trap net indices appeared to be above average for both Spirit Lake and similar lakes.  Like many lakes in the north half of the state, Bass abundance has been increasing over time.  Size structure was good with an average size of 11.9 inches and a maximum size of 16.4 inches in the gill net sample and an average size of 11.4 inches and a maximum size 19.4 inches in the trap net sample.\n\nBluegill and Black Crappie abundance have been remarkably stable the past 3 decades, and at moderate levels relative to similar lakes. Decent numbers of Bluegills over 7 inches exist in Spirit Lake, with fish over 8 inches regularly present in recent surveys. The average size of Black Crappie in 2023 was over 8.5 inches, with fish up to 12.2 inches observed in the samples. \n\nYellow Perch and Tullibee are important forage species for the lake's game fish. While Yellow Perch continued to be sampled in low numbers in 2023, it was a slight improvement from the previous two surveys. Perch growth in the Aitkin Area is typically slow, limiting effectiveness of standard gill nets for sampling simply because the fish don't get large enough to get caught in the gear. However, large numbers of small Perch were captured in shoreline seining during the July 22, 2023 Targeted survey indicating a presence likely higher than the gill net sample suggested.\n\nThe Tullibee catch of 0.3 per gill net was a slight increase from the previous survey (0.1 per gill net in 2019), but below average when compared to similar lakes. Water quality, in terms of dissolved oxygen and temperature, offer only marginal habitat for Tullibee in Spirit Lake. A temperature - dissolved oxygen (TDO) profile was collected on August 7, 2023, to measure the amount of this habitat. Good oxy-thermal habitat was available from about 16 to 24 feet. Comparing profiles collected from 2011-2019, the best conditions for Tullibee occurred in 2023, with adequate yet marginal habitat in 2013, 2015, 2017 and 2018, and then poor condition in the remaining years. These are marginal levels of oxy-thermal habitat compared to other lakes in the area that are monitored. Because the Aitkin area is located near the southern edge of Minnesota's Tullibee range, TDO profiles should continue to be collected to monitor the availability of cold-water habitat. This issue will be exacerbated with a warming climate, which emphasizes the need for sound management in the shoreland as well as in the remainder of the watershed.\n</p>",

Fall night electrofishing was conducted on September 29, 2015.  The total sample time was 1.6 hours with no YOY or age-1 walleye sampled. A single adult walleye was captured and was 19.9\" long.  Fry stocking began in 2012, and the continued use of fall electrofishing will be useful in determining the effectiveness of the current fry with contingent fingerling stocking strategy.</p>",

Tullibee (3 of 3 aged) were all greater than eight years of age.  Northern pike (54 of 111 aged) ranged from one to eight plus years of age with strong year classes indicated for 1989 and 1990. Growth rates for the third through the sixth annual increments were slower than normal.  Bluegill (40 of 140 aged) ranged from three to seven years of age with strong year classes indicated for 1986, 1987, and 1988.  Growth rates for the second, third, and fourth annual increments were slower than normal.  Largemouth bass (19 of 19 aged) ranged from one to five years of age with most of the sample from the 1989 and 1990 year classes. Growth rates were normal.  Black crappie (11 of 11 aged) ranged from three to five years of age with most of the fish sampled from the 1989 year class. The growth rate for the first annual increment was slower than normal.  Growth rates for the third and fourth annual increments were faster than normal.  Total length at formation of the fourth annulus was normal.  Yep (22 of 25 aged) ranged from two to six years of age with a strong year class indicated for 1989.  The growth rate for the first annual increment was slower than normal. Walleye (16 of 19 aged) ranged from one to seven years of age with strong year classes indicated for 1986, 1987, and 1989.  The 1986 and 1987 year classes correspond to stocked year classes.  The presence of the strong 1987 year class and the lack of a 1988 year class indicates that while natural reproduction does occur it is not always successful.  The growth rate for the third annual increment is faster than normal.  Pumpkinseed and bluegill trap net catches increased from the 1988 assessment to the 1992 assessment (Wilcoxon's signed rank test: pumpkinseed, p=0.0249, n=11; bluegill, p=0.0208, n=11). Yep gill net catch increased from the 1986 assessment to the 1992 assessment (Wilcoxon's signed rank test: p=0.0143, n=10).</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A temperature - dissolved oxygen (TDO) profile was collected on August 8, 2022, to measure the amount of thermal habitat available for Tullibee. The TDO3 (temperature at 3 mg/l dissolved oxygen) was determined to be 22.2 degrees C. Limited oxy-thermal habitat was available throughout the water column with only a couple of points falling inside the suitable curve. Comparing profiles collected from 2011-2022, the best conditions for Tullibee occurred in 2013, 2015, 2017 and 2019, although still only marginal compared to other lakes in the area that are monitored. Because the Aitkin area is located near the southern edge of Minnesota's Tullibee range, TDO profiles should continue to be collected to monitor the availability of cold-water habitat.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of nearshore fish species in Spirit Lake was conducted on June 27, 2023 by Aitkin Area Fisheries staff.  Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at all 14 sampling stations, but two stations were sampled from the boat due to site conditions. Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample eleven stations, a 15-foot seine was used at one station, and site conditions prevented the use of seines at two stations.  Nearshore sampling captured 22 species of fish including 7 species that were intolerant of disturbance (ie., Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, Logperch, Pugnose Shiner, and Rock Bass) and none that were tolerant of disturbance. <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore data were combined with trap net and gill net data from a July 2023 survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based IBI (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment.  In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g., Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, Logperch, Pugnose Shiner, and Rock Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g., Black Bullhead, Common Carp, Green sunfish). The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake.  For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.   <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey indicates Spirit Lake is healthy as indicated by an exceptionally high FIBI score, well above the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes. Data from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to Mississippi River (Brainerd) Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency. <br> \n</p>",
