                "narrative": "<p>Clear Lake is a small pothole prairie lake located near the town of Russell in Lyon County.  Clear Lake is managed primarily for yellow perch and secondarily for black crappie and walleye.  Clear Lake could be described as a bowl shaped 68-acre lake with a maximum depth of 11 feet.  Much of the shoreline is sand and gravel and most of the lake lacks any significant emergent or submergent vegetation.  The Clear Lake watershed is relatively small and is virtually isolated in terms of inlets and outlets, which may partially explain why common carp have not been captured in any historical netting.  A resurvey was conducted during the week of August 25th using 2 gillnets, 6 trap nets, and 2 seine hauls.Clear Lake appears to be rebuilding in terms of the recreational fishery.  Based on the test netting done in 2003, the yellow perch population is primarily 5-8 inch fish that average 6.8 inches long.  The good news is the numbers are nearly three times greater than similar lakes in the area.  If you had fished Clear Lake in 1999, the population has not changed much since that survey.  Most of the fish caught in 2003 were 2 years old and from natural reproduction in 2001.  According to historical records, yellow perch have never been stocked in Clear Lake by the DNR.  Maintaining a good predator base might improve the size structure of yellow perch so that some of the fish grow to \"harvestable\" size over time.  If you are looking for good action and not necessarily a meal then Clear Lake might be the ticket.The walleye population is also in a rebuilding situation.  Walleye fingerlings were stocked in 1996, 1999, 2001, and 2003.  Despite the catch rate of walleye in gill nets being more than twice the norm compared to other similar lakes, the fish were small.  Netting data found some fish from the 1996 fingerling stocking that are in the 18 inch range but are not numerous.  It appears that the walleye from the 2001 fingerling stocking are slow growing.   Most walleye captured in gill nets were 7 to 10 inches long and averaged 8 inches.  Generally we would expect these walleye to be nearly 14 inches by age 2.  Given the slow growth issue, stock-piling of walleye and the historically abundant white sucker and yellow perch populations, perhaps adding northern pike to the fish community would improve fishing in Clear Lake.  If you are looking for a potential walleye/yellow perch lake in that area, East Twin Lake might be a better option in the next year or two.A total of 2 black crappie were captured in the survey which was substaintially lower than in the 1999 survey.  Dissolved oxygen readings, during the winter of 1999-2000 were 1.7, 2.6, and 3.4 ppm, which may have been low enough to winterkill black crappies and bluegill.The black bullhead catch rate in gill nets was 195/set, which is more than twice the upper average range.  The black bullhead catch rate in trap nets was 150.3/set which was also more than twice the expected range.A total of 9 species of fish were sampled.  Other species sampled were bluegill, fathead minnow, largemouth bass, and northern pike.To promote and maintain healthy fish populations, pollution and other inputs need to be controlled.  Fish habitats are directly affected by water quality.  Nutrient, sediment and other waste inputs can drastically alter the biological, chemical, and physical components of a lake.  It is important to maintain if not improve the current water quality of Clear Lake through watershed management to preserve this fishery for future generations to enjoy.Prepared by Ryan Doorenbos   </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Clear Lake is a 68-acre lake located near Russell, MN in Lyon County.  The lake has a maximum depth of 11 feet, a shoreline length of 1.3 miles and is a class 42 lake.  It is managed primarily for yellow perch while walleye, crappie, northern pike, and bluegill are managed secondarily.\n\nThe only stocking record we had prior to the 1995 Initial Survey was a 1962 stocking of northern pike fingerlings done via transfer permit.  Local interest in the lake inspired the development of a public access and boat ramp, which was completed in 1996.  The initial lake survey, conducted in 1995, found a surprisingly diverse fish population, including such sport species as largemouth bass, bluegill, and yellow perch, that had never been officially stocked.  Since there is no true inlet or outlet to account for fish immigration, the presence of these species is probably due to unauthorized stocking activity.  No common carp or bigmouth buffalo have been sampled in Clear Lake, which is unique in Southwest Minnesota.\n\nClear Lake shows promise as an angling lake, especially with its proximity to the town of Russell, it being one of relatively few lakes in the immediate area, and it\u0019s basically favorable physical characteristics.  Most of the lake bottom is sand and gravel, the watershed is relatively small, and flooded trees and brush provide some spawning habitat and cover.  \n\nClear Lake has a fairly good yellow perch population.  The yellow perch gill net catch rate of 5.00 per net in 2007 compared to 104.5 per net in 2003 and 169.0 per net in 1999.  Lengths of yellow perch caught in gill nets ranged from 9.4 to 10.7 inches and averaged 9.8 inches.  \n\nThe walleye population is also doing well in Clear Lake.  The walleye gill net catch rate was 5.5 per set in 2007 compared to 17.0 per set in 2003 and 10.50 per set in 1999.  Lengths of walleye caught in gill nets ranged from 10.9 to 26.5 inches with an average length of 18.0 inches.  Five different ages of walleye were observed during the assessment of which four age classes coincided with walleye fingerling stockings.  \n\nThe bluegill population is low in Clear Lake.  The bluegill trap net catch rate was 1.3 per set in 2007 compared to 0 per set in 2003 and 17.0per set in 1999.  Lengths of bluegill caught in trap nets ranged from 3.5 to 9.5 inches and averaged 7.4 inches.  \n\nClear Lake has a fairly good black crappie population.  The black crappie trap net catch rate was 3.5 per net in 2007 compared to 0.3 per net in 2003 and 66.3 per net in 1999.  Lengths of black crappie caught  in trap nets ranged from 5.2 to 10.0 inches and averaged 8.0 inches.  \n\nClear Lake has a good black bullhead population.  The black bullhead trap net catch rate was 37.8 per net in 2007 compared to 150.3 per net in 2003 and 42.7 per net in 1999.  Lengths of black bullhead caught in trap nets ranged from 7.6 to 8.8 inches with an average length of 8.1 inches.  \n\nOther species sampled during the assessment included largemouth bass and white sucker.\n\nTo maintain a healthy fishery in Clear Lake, we need to promote Best Management Practices (BMP\u0019s) within the watershed to help reduce nutrients entering the lake.  High nutrients and sediments in a lake can cause algae blooms and reduce water clarity.\n\n\n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Give this southern Minnesota Lake a try! Clear Lake near the town of Russel is a 65 acre southern Minnesota lake with turbid water and a maximum depth near 10 feet with an average depth near 6 feet.  While the statistics indicate it historically has underperformed, Clear Lake is a recent overachiever!   <br> \n <br> \nClear Lake was surveyed in August 2016 with 1 gill net and 6 trap nets to assess the fish community.  Five species of fish were sampled in the nets including 192 Black Bullhead, 13 Northern Pike, 150 Walleye, 6 White Sucker, and 14 Yellow Perch.  Gill nets are good indicators of Walleye and Yellow Perch abundance while trap nets are good indicators of Black Crappie, Bluegill, and Northern Pike abundance.   <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch, when caught, should be bigger than 8 inches.  The catch of 14 per gill net was within the normal range for Clear Lake.  The overall size of the Yellow Perch in the 2016 sample was good ranging from 7 to 11 inches with an average length just shy of 9 inches.  Additionally, the overall health of each fish was excellent with well-rounded bellies and thick bodies.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike across a wide range of sizes can be found in Clear Lake.  Northern Pike were caught at a rate of 4 per gill net and 1.5 per trap net.  Northern Pike ranged from 11 to 38 inches in the sample with 2 less than 20 inches, 6 within the 20 to 24 inch range, and 5 greater than 24 inches.  Overall, the Northern Pike in the sample were in fair health across a wide range of sizes.   <br> \n <br> \nWalleye are plentiful in Clear Lake!  Walleye were caught at a rate of 94 per gill net and 9 per trap net.  The gill net catch rate was nearly 13 times greater than expected catch rates for similar lakes and the trap net catch rate was nearly 5 times greater than expected catch rates for similar lakes.  Walleye in the nets ranged in length from 10 to 24 inches with an average length of 15 inches in the gill net and 20 inches in the trap nets.  The health of Walleye in the sample was good too, indicating the fish are finding plenty to eat, most likely small Yellow Perch.  The Walleye population abundance and overall health is extremely good for a small shallow lake in SW MN.  Clear Lake appears primed for good Walleye fishing when the fish are hungry and the bite is on!  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Clear Lake is a 65-acre lake located in the Town of Russell in Lyon County.  Clear Lake has a maximum depth of 10 ft. and a watershed to lake ratio of 6 to 1, which is fairly small compared to many of our other lakes (Secchi depth = 0.8 ft.).  Clear Lake is managed primarily for Walleye and secondarily for Yellow Perch and Northern Pike.  A standard survey was conducted the week of June 1, 2021 to monitor fish populations using a gill net and trap nets. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye catch rates have been highly variable in Clear Lake, ranging from 0.0 per gill net in 1995 to 94.0 per gill net in 2016, and averaging 30.7 per gill net since 1995.  The 2021 gill net catch rate was 61.0 per gill net and 9.8 per trap net, both exceeding their expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (1.0 to 7.3 per gill net and 0.4 to 1.9 per trap net).  Three year classes of Walleye were present (age-2, 4, and 6) with age-2 Walleye comprising 76 percent of the sample.  Walleye growth appears to be fast, as mean length at age-2 was 14.6 inches.  Lengths of Walleye ranged from 13.0 to 27.6 inches and averaged 18.1 inches.  Stocking Walleye fingerlings every other year appears to be an effective stocking strategy that has produced a very abundant Walleye population.  <br> \n <br> \nThe 2021 Yellow Perch catch rate was 2.0 per gill net, which is the lowest observed catch rate ever observed on Clear Lake and is below the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (3.0 to 26.5 per gill net).  Lengths of the two Yellow Perch sampled were 8.1 and 8.3 inches.  The abundant Walleye population is likely decimating the Yellow Perch population.  It is likely that pre-spawn adult Yellow Perch will be stocked to restart this population.  <br> \n <br> \nOne, 22.8-inch Northern Pike was sampled in the survey. Seven-hundred Northern Pike fingerlings were last stocked in 2016.  Other species sampled included Black Bullhead and White Sucker. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Clear Lake was first surveyed in 1995.  The lake covers 68 acres, and the deepest spot in the lake is approximately 11 feet.  The bottom substrates in near shore areas are predominantly sand in combination with boulders and gravel.  Although overall vegetation is lacking, the lake has numerous sunken and fallen trees and, due to recent high water levels, flooded brush areas.  The last recorded stocking occurred in 1962 when northern pike fingerlings were released.Clear Lake has a high population of yellow perch compared to similar lakes in our area.  The yellow perch population is dominated by 1 and 2 year old fish.  Yellow perch sampled in our gillnets ranged in length from 6 to 9 ? inches with an average length of approximately 8 inches.  Because of favorable spawning habitat, yellow perch are reproducing naturally in Clear Lake.  With adequate forage currently present, anglers should encounter numerous yellow perch more than 10 inches in following years.  Clear Lake also has good numbers of bluegill.  The population is dominated by small fish ranging in length from 4 to 5 inches.  The largest bluegill collected in our trapnets was 9 inches in length.   The bullhead population is comparable to other lakes in our area.  Bullhead lengths ranged from 4 to 12 inches with the majority of the fish in the 5 to 7 inch range.Long term management plans are currently being devised for Clear Lake.To promote and maintain a healthy fish population, pollution and other inputs need to be controlled.  Fish habitat is directly affected by water quality.  Nutrient, sediment and other waste inputs can drastically alter the chemical and physical components of a Lake.  It is paramount to maintain if not improve the current water quality of Clear Lake through watershed management to preserve this fishery for future generations to enjoy.   </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Clear Lake near the town of Russell in Lyon County is a 68-acre lake with a maximum depth of 11.0 feet.  Clear Lake is managed primarily for yellow perch and secondarily for black crappie and walleye.  The first survey was conducted in 1995 so not much biological information on Clear Lake is  known.  The initial lake survey indicated the lake had little aquatic vegetation and reduced water clarity (secchi disk of 0.9 feet).  Spawning habitat for yellow perch and black crappie was rated \"good\" because of the firm substrate and the abundance of submerged branches, logs, and bushes. The number of yellow perch per gill net was 169.00 fish/net set which was six times greater than the upper normal range (26.50 fish/net set) for this lake class.  The catch rate in the 1995 survey was almost two times the 1999 survey catch rate.  Although the density of yellow perch was high, the size structure was dominated by small individuals.  Total lengths of yellow perch ranged between 5.7 and 6.8 inches, with a mean of 6.3.  Only two year classes of yellow perch were recorded in gill nets with the 1997 year class dominating the population.  This suggests the yellow perch population density was very high and the population size structure was dominated by smaller fish.  In the next few years these fish should be approaching the size anglers' desire.  The average black crappie trap net catch rate was 66.33 fish/net set which was four times greater than the upper range for this type of lake.  Adult black crappies were first stocked in May of 1997.  Three year classes of black crappie were recorded with the 1997 and 1998 year classes dominating.  Total lengths of black crappie ranged between 5.3 and 12.6 inches, with an average of 6.9.  Shoreline seining did not sample any black crappie.  These data suggest the black crappie population density is higher than other area lakes and that the size structure of black crappie was dominated by smaller sized individuals.  Anglers should be seeing more of these fish on their lines in the next few years provided oxygen during the winter stays high enough (>5.00 ppm of O2).The average walleye gill net catch was 10.50 fish/net set which was higher than the upper range for this type of lake.  Walleye fingerlings were first stocked in 1996 at a rate of 3.6 fish/lb.  Total lengths of walleye sampled ranged between 15.2 and 21.5 inches and had an average of 19.0.  Three year classes of walleye were aged with the 1996 year classes dominating.  Seven of the 21 walleyes aged were not from the 1996 year class, indicating illegal stocking and/or natural reproduction occurred.  The majority of fish were in the range of 18 to 21 inches which indicates reasonable growth.  No walleye were sampled shoreline seining which suggests limited natural reproduction.  Some good walleye are available for anglers in Clear Lake.The largemouth bass electrofishing catch rate was 3.75 fish/hr.  Total lengths from five largemouth bass ranged between 7.5 and 9.5 inches, with an average of 8.4.  Two year classes of largemouth bass were caught.  Most of the fish were from the 1998 year class.  No largemouth bass have ever been stocked by the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources and are likely from an illegal stocking.  The bluegill trap net catch rate was 17.00 fish/net set which was similar to other lakes of this type.  Total lengths of bluegill ranged between 6.0 and 7.4 inches, with an average of 6.6.  Three year classes of bluegill were documented with the 1995 and 1996 year classes dominating the age structure.  One young of the year bluegill was sampled shoreline seining in 1999 which indicated some limited natural reproduction.  The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources has never stocked bluegill or managed for bluegill in Clear Lake.  Again these fish are likely from illegal stockings.The black bullhead gill net catch rate was 189.00 fish/net set which was more than twice the upper range for this type of lake.  The initial survey conducted in 1995 had a catch rate of 151.00 fish/net which was nearly as high.  Total lengths of black bullhead ranged between 5.6 and 8.5 inches, with an average of 7.1.  These data suggest that the black bullhead population was thriving at a relatively high density and the population size structure consisted mostly of smaller sized individuals.  Clear Lake has been surveyed twice (1995 and 1999) and neither time has common carp been captured.  This unique situation provides a true opportunity to manage for largemouth bass because of the potential for increasing aquatic vegetation in Clear Lake.  If the density of black bullhead can be reduced then it may provide the opportunity for aquatic vegetation to increase.  The density of black bullheads may be better kept in check by maintaining a higher population density of predators (largemouth bass).  If this scenario is to work, anglers should carefully evaluate their harvest of largemouth bass for a few years.     To promote and maintain healthy fish populations, pollution and other inputs need to be controlled.  Fish habitats are directly affected by water quality.  Nutrient, sediment and other waste inputs can drastically alter the biological, chemical, and physical components of a lake.  It is paramount to maintain if not improve the current water quality of Clear Lake through watershed management to preserve this fishery for future generations to enjoy.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>INTRODUCTION <br> \n <br> \nClear Lake is located partially within the city limits of Russell in Lyon County, has a surface area of 68 acres, a maximum depth of 11 feet when full, and is a DNR lake class 42.  Minnesota DNR fisheries classifies lakes with similar characteristics, such as depth, size, water chemistry, etc. on a statewide basis for comparison of data.  The watershed is fairly small and the surrounding land is dominated by agricultural practices along with some nearby gravel mining.  Even with an aeration system this lake has commonly experienced partial winterkills which makes it difficult to manage on a long term basis.  Two substantial winterkills have occurred since 2004, the most recent in 2009-2010 when only white sucker and black bullhead survived according to spring netting.   The lake is managed primarily for yellow perch, while walleye, crappie, northern pike, and bluegill sunfish are managed secondarily.  To assess fish populations and evaluate management plan objectives test netting was conducted by Windom area fisheries personnel during the week of August 20, 2012 with the following results. <br> \n <br> \nYELLOW PERCH <br> \n <br> \nThe gill net catch for yellow perch was 15 fish per net which is within the normal range of 3-26.5 for class 42 lakes similar to Clear.  Prior survey numbers recorded in 1995 were 301fish per net, 169 fish per net in 1999, and at 104.5 fish per net in 2003.  Perch numbers have plummeted following the last two winterkills to a low of 5 fish per net in 2007.  Although the population has crept up slightly since then,  the lake has excellent perch spawning habitat and should continue to increase rapidly to previous levels barring another major  winterkill event.  Lengths of yellow perch in gill nets ranged from 8.4 inches to 10.9 inches with an average length of 9.7 inches.  This probably represents one year class of quality sized fish with some larger individuals showing good growth.  There is no history of perch stocking in Clear so this self sustaining population should help provide ample forage for the walleye and northern along with white suckers.  <br> \n <br> \nWALLEYE <br> \n <br> \nWalleye gill net catch was a historical high for this lake at 27 fish per net, and their lengths ranged from 8 inches to 15 inches.  Trap net catches for walleye were also a historical high at 7 fish per net with their lengths very similar to those in gill nets.  The majority of the gill netted walleye (n=24) were aged by counting growth rings on a bony internal structure called an otolith (oto=ear and lith=bone).  Eighteen of those fish (75%) were two years old and correspond to a walleye fry stocking in the spring of 2010.  The remaining six fish aged (25%) were one year old and correspond to a walleye fingerling stocking in the fall of 2011.  Growth rates of walleye in Clear are somewhat below average for the 1 year old fish, which may be due to competition for food with the overly abundant black bullhead population. <br> \n <br> \nBLACK BULLHEAD <br> \n <br> \nBlack bullhead gill net catches were also at an all time high of 402 fish per net.  Their lengths ranged from 4.5 inches to nearly 15 inches with an average length just under 9 inches.  The condition factor of the bullheads in Clear Lake was somewhat below average, but they should still provide plenty of angling action for this species. <br> \n <br> \nNORTHERN PIKE <br> \n <br> \nOnly three northern pike were captured in both net types used, and they were larger fish measuring 27.5 inches to just over 29 inches with a mean weight of nearly 6 pounds.  Northern pike abundance may continue to improve with fingerling stocking every other year if there isn't a winterkill, or predation on the small northern by the overly abundant black bullheads.  <br> \n <br> \nBLACK CRAPPIE <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie catch in trap nets was 1.2 fish per net with a total of 7 caught, compared to 66.3 fish per  trap net back in 1999.  The 9-10 inch crappies sampled most likely came from a stocking of adults in early May of 2012 to re-establish the species after winterkill. <br> \n <br> \nBLUEGILL <br> \n <br> \nNo bluegill sunfish were sampled in either gill nets or trap nets during this assessment.  There have been two substantial winterkills on Clear Lake since adult bluegills were last stocked in 2004.  In the 1990's an average number of bluegills were present and sought after by local anglers.   Plans call for adult fish to be stocked in the near future to start a new population, hopefully in the absence of another winterkill event. <br> \n <br> \nWHITE SUCKER <br> \n <br> \nClear Lake has always had a robust population of white suckers which serve as an excellent food source especially for the larger northern pike, and also sometimes the walleye.  The number of sucker sampled were near the long term average at 8 fish per gill net and measured 14.5 to 20.5 inches. <br> \n <br> \nCOMMON CARP <br> \n <br> \nAn interesting point is that no common carp have ever been sampled during test netting according to DNR records.  Anglers should be very proud of this fact and extremely cautious not to release any minnows or introduce any new species of fish into Clear Lake.  Anglers should also remember that this lake is in the process of recovering from a substantial winterkill and may take a couple more years to reach its full potential.  <br> \n <br> \nPrepared by Chuck Obler <br> \n</p>",
