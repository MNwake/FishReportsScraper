                "narrative": "<p>Little O'Reilly Lake is a small lake located in central Itasca County, north of Bovey, MN.  The Division of Waters lists the lake area as 77 acres, but the open water portion of the lake is closer to 45 acres.  The lake has a maximum depth of 41 ft and a littoral area of 25 acres.  This was the first assessment ever conducted on Little O'Reilly Lake.  The surrounding watershed was actively mined in the past and red sediments are still present in the deeper portions of the lake.  Access can only be gained through private property and fishing pressure is probably very light.  Two gill nets sampled three northern pike for a gill net catch rate of 1.5/net, which was lower than the expected range for similar lakes.  Northern pike varied in length from 24 to 25 inches.  The survey crew commented that the northern pike were heavy for their length indicating they were in good condition.  Growth was slower than the statewide average for ages one to three, and faster than the average for ages four to five.  Northern pike averaged 24 inches by age four.   Bluegill trap net catch rate was 8.6/net and was within the expected range for similar lakes.  Size structure was poor with no fish larger than 8 inches sampled.  Growth was slower than the lake class average with fish averaging 6 inches by age eight.Black crappie trap-net catch was 0.9/net, which was similar to the low end of the expected range.  No black crappie were sampled in gill nets.  Size structure was poor with no fish larger than 10 inches sampled.  Growth was similar to the statewide average with fish averaging 8 inches at age five.  Five largemouth bass were sampled in trap nets for a catch rate of 0.6/net, which was within the expected range.  No largemouth bass were sampled in gill nets.  Size structure was poor with no fish larger than 15 inches sampled.  Growth was slower than the statewide average with fish averaging 14 inches by age eight.Yellow perch catch rates were very low with two fish sampled in gill nets and trap nets.  Other species sampled include pumpkinseed sunfish, rock bass, brown bullhead, and yellow bullhead.  </p>",
