The length frequency distributions for lake trout collected in the 1972 survey and this assessment were similar.  The walleye catch in this assessment was low, and was below the normal range for lakes of this class.  Growth of the two walleye collected had been above average by area standards.  The good growth exhibited by the walleye collected indicated that forage was not limiting, despite the absence of yellow perch in the catch.</p>",
