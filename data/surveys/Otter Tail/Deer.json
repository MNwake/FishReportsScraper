                "narrative": "<p>     Deer Lake is a 457-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located in central Otter Tail County approximately five miles north of Battle Lake, MN.  Deer Lake is connected to Otter Tail Lake via the Otter Tail River.  The immediate watershed is composed primarily of agricultural land interspersed with hardwood woodlots.  The maximum depth is 26 feet; however, 67% of the lake is 15 feet or less in depth.  The secchi disk reading was 7.8 feet during the 2014 survey.  Previous secchi disk readings have ranged from 5.5 to 9.8 feet. <br> \n     The majority of the shoreline of Deer Lake has been extensively developed.  A DNR owned public access is located on the southeast shoreline where the Otter Tail River enters the lake.  There are remnant stands of hardstem bulrush and wild rice in the shallow areas of the lake.  These emergent plants provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat and are critical in maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms from wave erosion and help absorb excess nutrients.  Emergent plants also provide critical spawning habitat for several fish species including Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass and panfish.  They also serve as important nursery areas for many species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants cannot be removed without a DNR permit.   <br> \n     A moderate density Northern Pike population exists.  Age and length data from recent surveys indicate that Northern Pike reproduction is consistently good.  Northern Pike ranged in length from 12.4 to 29.5 inches with an average length and weight of 17.7 inches and 1.1 pounds.  Northern Pike attain an average length of 24.3 inches at six years of age. <br> \n     Catch data indicate that Bluegills are abundant.  Bluegill size structure is good with 22% of the sample measuring 7.0 inches or greater in length.  Bluegills attain an average length of 7.0 inches at five years of age.    <br> \n     Walleye abundance has remained stable over the recent series of surveys.  Walleyes ranged in length from 9.2 to 24.7 inches with an average length and weight of 16.4 inches and 1.6 pounds.  Walleyes attain an average length of 14.1 inches at four years of age. <br> \n     Anglers can maintain the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large-size fish while allowing the harvest of the more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with opportunities to catch more large fish in the future. <br> \n</p>",

Bluegill size and age class distributions remained stable, with few fish greater than 7.0 inches in length.  <br> \n     Only three black crappies were captured, all age-IV+.  <br> \n     Yellow perch abundance declined to 0.5 per gill net.  <br> \n     Walleye abundance increased from 2.0 per gill net in 1983 to 5.2 per net.

                "narrative": "<p>Deer Lake is 457 acres in size and is located in central Otter Tail County approximately four miles north of Battle Lake, MN.  The lake reaches a maximum depth of 26 feet; however, 65% of the lake is less than 15 feet deep.  There is a state owned concrete public access on the southeast corner of the lake off of County Road 83.  The Otter Tail River enters the lake near the public access, flowing from Otter Tail Lake about 1.5 miles upstream.  A narrow, navigable straight separates Deer Lake from East Lost Lake.  The secchi depth reading during the survey was 9.5 feet, indicating good water clarity.  Landowners on the lake can protect water quality by properly maintaining septic systems,maintaining a vegetated buffer along the lakeshore, and by not using fertilizers that contain phosphorous.       The majority of the shoreline of Deer Lake has been extensively developed.  The development is composed primarilyof homes and cabins.  There are a couple of resorts located on Deer Lake.  There are remnant stands of hardstem bulrush and wild rice in shallow areas of the lake.  Emergent aquatic plants such as bulrush and wild rice provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat, and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms, and can actually absorb and break down polluting chemicals.  Emergent plants provide spawning area for fish such as northern pike, largemouth bass, and panfish.  They also serve as important nursery area for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit.  To maintain the excellent water quality and angling that this lake has to offer, it is imperative to preserve the quality of the aquatic habitat.Deer Lake can be ecologically classified as a bass-panfish type of lake and this is reflected in the assemblage of the fish community.  Largemouth bass, walleye, and bluegill are the dominant species in the fish community.     During the past five surveys, bluegill trap net catch rates have exceeded the upper limit of the normal range for class 34 lakes.  Bluegill size structure has decreased; only 8% of the bluegills were > 7.0 inches.  Bluegill growth is slow with an average length of 6.3 inches at six years of age.  There are also moderate numbers of pumpkinseed and hybrid sunfish present in Deer Lake.       Historically, northern pike test-net catch rates have not varied much and have always been with the normal range for class 34 lakes.  Northern pike size structure is poor with an average length and weight at capture of 18.0 inches and 1.1 pounds.  Present and past age data has shown that the northern pike population is composed of predominately young fish (> 5 years of age).  It is speculated that overexploitation and/or high natural mortality are the causes of this young population.  Pike reached an average length of 19.0 inches at age-IV, which is slightly slower than the area average.     The walleye test-net catch rate exceeded the upper limit of the normal range for class 34 lakes.  This was the highest recorded catch rate.  Walleye ranged in length from 9.1 to 28.4 inches with an average length and weight at capture of 15.6 inches and 1.4 pounds.  The 2001 and 2002 year classes appear to be strong and should provide consistently good walleye angling for several years.  Walleye attain an average length of 14.8 inches at four years of age.  Data from past and recent test-netting assessments indicate that year classes have developed from natural reproduction.  Walleye probably do not successfully spawn in Deer Lake itself, as it lacks gravel and cobble substrates.  It is unclear whether naturally reproduced fish in Deer Lake are spawned in the river above the lake, or are migrants from the large walleye population in Otter Tail Lake.  Past surveys have shown a correlation between strong Otter Tailand Deer Lake walleye year classes.  Years of stocking in Deer Lake have also corresponded to good year classes, which suggests that stocking may be supplementing natural reproduction.       The DNR does not stock any fish species other than walleye in Deer Lake.  The other species present are able to sustain their levels at or above management goals without stocking.  This is an indication of the excellent water quality and fish habitat that is available.  To maintain the excellent fishing that this lake has to offer, it is imperative to preserve the water quality and fish habitat.       Anglers can also maintain the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages therelease of medium to large-size fish while allowing the harvest of the more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future.   </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>     Deer Lake is a 457-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located in central Otter Tail County approximately five miles north of Battle Lake, MN.  Deer Lake is connected to Otter Tail Lake via the Otter Tail River.  The immediate watershed is composed primarily of agricultural land interspersed with hardwood woodlots.  The maximum depth is 26 feet; however, 67% of the lake is 15 feet or less in depth.  The secchi disk reading, which is a standard measure of water clarity, was 9.8 feet during the 2009 survey.  Previous secchi disk readings have ranged from 5.5 to 9.5 feet. <br> \n     The majority of the shoreline of Deer Lake has been extensively developed.  A DNR owned public access is located on the southeast shoreline where the Otter Tail River enters the lake.  There are remnant stands of hardstem bulrush and wild rice in the shallow areas of the lake.  These emergent plants provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat and are critical in maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms from wave erosion and help absorb excess nutrients.  Emergent plants also provide critical spawning habitat for several fish species including northern pike, largemouth bass and panfish.  They also serve as important nursery areas for many species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants cannot be removed without a DNR permit.  With recent high water levels, shoreline erosion has become an increasing concern for lakeshore owners.  By using shoreline best management practices (BMP's) and lakescaping concepts, impacts of development and shoreline erosion can be minimized.  Contact any County Extension Office for information on BMP's and the local DNR Fisheries Office for information on lakescaping techniques. <br> \n     The northern pike test-net catch rate was within the expected range for similar lakes.  Age and length data from recent surveys indicate that northern pike reproduction is consistently good and that the population is dominated by young fish.  Northern pike ranged in length from 9.5 to 29.8 inches with an average length and weight of 17.2 inches and 1.2 pounds.  Northern pike reach an average length of 22.1 inches at age four. <br> \n     The bluegill test-net catch rate was within the expected range for similar lakes but was the lowest recorded since the 1979 survey.  Bluegill size structure remains poor with 13% of the sample measuring 7.0 inches or greater in length.  Bluegills reach an average length of 6.5 inches at age six.    <br> \n     The walleye test-net catch rate was within the expected range for similar lakes.  Walleye ranged in length from 13.1 to 24.2 inches with an average length and weight of 16.1 inches and 1.4 pounds.  Walleye reach an average length of 14.2 inches at age four. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>     Deer Lake is a 457-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located in central Otter Tail County approximately five miles north of Battle Lake, MN.  Deer Lake is connected to Otter Tail Lake via the Otter Tail River.  The immediate watershed is composed primarily of agricultural land interspersed with hardwood woodlots.  The maximum depth is 26 feet; however, 67% of the lake is 15 feet or less in depth.  The secchi disk reading during the 2019 survey was 8.8 feet.  Previous secchi disk readings have ranged from 5.5 to 9.8 feet. <br> \n     The majority of the shoreline of Deer Lake has been extensively developed with homes and cabins.  A DNR owned public access is located on the southeast shoreline where the Otter Tail River enters the lake.  There are remnant stands of hardstem bulrush, common cattail, and wild rice scattered along the east and west shorelines of the lake. These emergent plants provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat and are critical in maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms from wave erosion and help absorb pollutants and excess nutrients.  Emergent plants also provide critical spawning habitat for several fish species including Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, and panfish.  They also serve as important nursery areas for many species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants cannot be removed without a DNR permit.   <br> \n     Walleye abundance has remained stable over the recent series of surveys.  Walleyes ranged in length from 11.6 to 19.7 inches with an average length and weight of 14.6 inches and 1.0 pounds.  Walleyes attain an average length of 13.9 inches at four years of age. <br> \n     Catch data indicate that Bluegills are abundant.  Bluegill size structure is moderate with 16% of the sample measuring 7.0 inches or greater in length and 1% measuring 8.0 inches or greater in length.  Bluegills attain an average length of 7.0 inches at six years of age.    <br> \n     A moderate density Northern Pike population exists.  Age and length data from recent surveys indicate that Northern Pike reproduction is consistently good.  Northern Pike ranged in length from 12.4 to 29.5 inches with an average length and weight of 17.7 inches and 1.1 pounds.  Northern Pike attain an average length of 24.3 inches at six years of age. <br> \n     A Lake Sturgeon re-introduction plan was implemented in 2002 when yearling Lake Sturgeon were stocked into Otter Tail Lake.  Lake Sturgeon fingerlings have been stocked in Otter Tail Lake on an annual basis since 2004 and will be stocked annually through 2022.  The objective of the re-introduction plan is to re-establish a self-sustaining Lake Sturgeon population in the Otter Tail River system.  Lake Sturgeon sampled in the 2019 standard survey ranged in length from 25.6 to 50.5 inches with an average length and weight of 42.4 inches and 10.2 pounds. <br> \n     Anglers can maintain or improve the quality of angling by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large size fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future.     <br> \n     Deer Lake was designated as infested with zebra mussels in 2017.  Aquatic invasive species are threatening Minnesota waters.  Aquatic invasive species can potentially harm water quality, water recreation, aquatic habitat, native species, and fish populations.  Anglers can help prevent the introduction and spread of invasive species by following watercraft transportation laws.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>     Deer Lake is a 457-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located in central Otter Tail County approximately five miles north of Battle Lake, MN.  Deer Lake is connected to Otter Tail Lake via the Otter Tail River.  The immediate watershed is composed primarily of agricultural land interspersed with hardwood woodlots.  The maximum depth is 26 feet; however, 67% of the lake is 15 feet or less in depth.  Historical secchi disk readings have ranged from 5.5 to 9.8 feet. <br> \n     The majority of the shoreline of Deer Lake has been extensively developed with homes and cabins.  A DNR owned public access is located on the southeast shoreline where the Otter Tail River enters the lake.  There are remnant stands of hardstem bulrush, common cattail, and wild rice scattered along the east and west shorelines of the lake. These emergent plants provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat and are critical in maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms from wave erosion and help absorb pollutants and excess nutrients.  Emergent plants also provide critical spawning habitat for several fish species including Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, and panfish.  They also serve as important nursery areas for many species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants cannot be removed without a DNR permit.   <br> \n     A reduced daily bag limit regulation for sunfish (10 per day) was implemented in 2021.  The objective of the regulation is to improve and maintain the quality of the Bluegill size structure.  A special spring trapnetting survey was conducted to collect baseline data on the Bluegill population, which will be used for regulation evaluation purposes in future surveys.  The Bluegill population is abundant and has a moderate quality size structure.  Seventy-one percent of the Bluegill sample was 7.0 inches or greater in length, while 15% was 8.0 inches or greater in length.  Age data indicate that Bluegill reproduction is consistently good.  Bluegills attain an average length of 7.9 inches at eight years of age. <br> \n     Anglers can also maintain or improve the quality of angling by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large size fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future.     <br> \n     Deer Lake was designated as infested with zebra mussels in 2017.  Aquatic invasive species are threatening Minnesota waters.  Aquatic invasive species can potentially harm water quality, water recreation, aquatic habitat, native species, and fish populations.  Anglers can help prevent the introduction and spread of invasive species by following watercraft transportation laws. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Deer Lake is 457 acres in size, and is located in central Otter Tail County.  The lake reaches a maximum depth of 26 feet, however, 65% of the lake is less than 15 feet.  There is a publicaccess on the southeast corner of the lake off of County Road 83.  The Otter Tail River enters the lake near the public access, flowing from Otter Tail Lake about 1.5 miles upstream.  A narrow, navigable straight seperates Deer Lake from East Lost Lake.  The lake secchi depth reading was 7.0 feet, indicating good water quality.  Landowners on the lake can protect water quality by properly maintaining septic systems, maintaining a vegetated buffer along the lakeshore, and by not using fertilizers that contain phosphorous.     There are remnant stands of hardstem bulrush and wild rice in shallow areas of the lake that serve as important spawning and nursery areas for fish, and so are protected by law.  A DNR permit is required before any emergent aquatic plants are removed, although limited amounts of submerged or floating leaf vegetation may be removed by landowners to allow for swimming or a boat dock.  Check with DNR Fisheries before undertaking any aquatic vegetation removal to learn about specific regulations.     Deer Lake supports good numbers of panfish and largemouth bass, along with moderate numbers of northern pike and walleye.  There are also several species of non-game fish in the lake.  Walleye are the only fish stocked in the lake; all other species are maintained by natural reproduction.     Bluegill trap net catches were high, averaging 53.7 per net, which is similar to the previous survey (54.2).   The statewide median for lakes of this type is 21.5 per net, and only one survey (1978) out of six has averaged below 50.0 per trap net.  Average size was 5.8 in., the largest individual was 8.5 in.,  and 16% of the sample exceeded 7.0 inches.  The 1993 survey showed a similar size distribution, with 17% above 7.0 inches.  Bluegill in Deer Lake grow more slowly than other similar lakes in the Fergus Falls Management Area; Deer Lake fish averaged 6.5 inches at age 6, while area lakes averaged 7.5 inches.  Growth was similar (6.7 at age 6) in the 1993 survey.     Trap net catches for black crappie averaged 1.8 per net, which is above the statewide median (1.5) for this type of lake, and slightly above the 1993 survey (1.4 per net).  Crappieaveraged 9.0 inches in length, and 69% were greater than 9.0 inches.  The previous survey found that 54% were above 9.0 inches.  Crappie averaged 8.6 inches at age 4, which is typical of area lakes of this type.     There are also moderate numbers of other sunfish species in Deer Lake.  Pumpkinseed catches averaged 8.0 per trap net, and hybrid sunfish averaged 1.2 per net.  Twenty-two percent of the pumpkinseeds exceeded 6.0 inches in length, and 27% of the hybrid sunfish exceeded 7.0 inches.     Largemouth bass trap net catches averaged 3.9 per net, which is above the normal range for this type of lake.  Catches were also higher than in previous surveys, which ranged from 0.4 to 1.8 bass per net.  Of the 35 fish sampled in this survey, 23 were from the 1998 year class and ranged in size from 5.5 to 7.5 inches.   As this year class matures, largemouth bass fishing may be excellent.  Only 6% of largemouth sampled in this survey were larger than 10 inches in length.  Growth is slow compared to similar lakes; bass on this lake reach 9.6 inches by age 4, while the area average for this type of lake is 12.8 inches at age 4.     There was an average of 3.2 northern pike per gill net lift in this survey, which is the lowest catch rate surveys have measured (5.7-8.8) and is below the statewide median for this type of lake (6.7).  Low catch rates may be the result of low yellow perch numbers, which are a primary source of food for pike.  Only 6% of pike sampled were greater than 20 inches.  All fish sampled were age 4 or less, suggesting that either reproduction has not been consistent or mortality is high.  Pike reached an average of 16.6 inches at age 4, while the area average for this type of lake was 20.8 inches.  Current growth rates are significantly lower than in the 1993 survey, wherepike averaged 19.8 inches at age 4.  Slow growth rates may also implicate low yellow perch numbers as a limiting factor for northern pike.     Walleye catch rates averaged 2.0 per gill net, which is below the previous survey (2.6) and the statewide median (2.5) for this type of lake.  Low catch rates have been typical in this lake; catch rates have ranged between 2.0 and 3.0 per net in all previous surveys, with the exception of 1988 (5.2).  The average length was 14.4 inches, with 33% of the sample exceeding 16.0 inches, similar to the previous survey (30%).  Walleye reach 14.3 inches at age 4, which is slightly slower than similar lakes in the area (15.0 at age 4).</p>",
