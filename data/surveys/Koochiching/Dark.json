                "narrative": "<p>Dark Lake is located about 1 mile southeast of Gemmel.  The lake is 120 acres and over 50 percent is less than 15 feet deep.  Aquatic plants are abundant.  Walleyes are the primary focus of management and have been stocked since 1948.  However, several species of sportfish were present in 2014 and have been stocked in the past. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill abundance has fluctuated greatly since 1972 when they were first documented in Dark Lake.  In 2014, bluegill abundance was within the expected range for this lake type.  The largest captured in 2014 was 9.6 inches.  Age in trap nets ranged from 2-8 with several strong year classes; age-3 was most numerous and represented 27% of the sample.  Growth was well above the area and statewide means.      <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass were stocked in 1946 and low numbers have been occasionally captured in the past.  In 2014, two largemouth bass were captured during night electrofishing.   The mean length for the two was 15.3 inches       <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike abundance was within the expected range for this lake type, but well below the level observed in the previous investigation.  Pike were generally small; the mean weight was 1.56 pounds, which was slightly below the expected range for this lake type.  Age-3 fish represented almost half of the sample and will grow into more attractive sizes in the future.  In the 2014 assessment the largest fish captured was 32 inches and found in a trap net.    <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance was above what was found during the previous investigation and also above the expected range for this lake type.  Length ranged from 7.6-23.0 inches with a mean of 16.8.  Growth was much greater than the statewide average and six year-classes were present, which should help continue the positive trend for those targeting walleye.   <br> \n    <br> \nYellow perch abundance has varied greatly over time, but record lows have occurred in Dark Lake in the past 3 assessments.  In 2014, abundance of yellow perch remained low and was tied the second lowest abundance ever documented in Dark Lake. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Dark is a 100 acre, class 32 lake located about 1 mile southeast of Gemmel.  Seventy percent of the lake is less than 15 feet deep and aquatic plants are abundant.  Walleyes are the primary focus of management and have been stocked since 1948.  However, several species of sportfish were present in 2009 and stocked in the past. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill abundance has flucuated greatly since 1972 when they were first documented in Dark Lake.  In 2009, bluegill abundance in trap nets increased greatly compared to the previous investigation in 2004, but still slightly below the level found in most class 32 lakes.  The largest captured in 2009 was 9.3 inches and the oldest was 8 years old.  Age in trap nets ranged from 2-8, with age-3 representing 66% of the sample.  Growth was well above the area and statewide means.   <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass were stocked in 1946 and low numbers have been occasionally captured in the past.  In 2009, no largemouth bass were captured in nets and night electrofishing was not used due to low catches in the previous investigation.    <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike gill net abundance was 14.75 fish/set, which was well above most class 32 lakes and the level observed in the previous investigation (5.25 fish/set).  Age ranged from 1-8 years.  Total length ranged from 10.7-27.0 inches.  Growth was well below the area mean.  The mean weight was well below most class 32 lakes.   <br> \n <br> \nWalleye gill net abundance was 2.00 fish/set, which was above most class 32 lakes.  Three year-classes were present and age ranged from 2-6 years.  Total length ranged from 11.6-26.5 inches.  Growth was much greater than the area and statewide averages.  <br> \n    <br> \nYellow perch abundance has varied greatly over time.  In 2009, abundance of yellow perch was low and only five were captured in gill nets, which was the second lowest abundance ever documented in Dark Lake.  The lowest abundance ever recorded was in the previous investigation conducted in 2004, when only two yellow perch were captured in gill nets.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Dark is a 120 acre lake located in Koochiching County about 1 mile southeast of Gemmel, Minnesota. Dark is accessed via a concrete ramp on the northwest end of the lake, which also has a public fishing pier. The lake has a maximum depth of 50 feet and fairly abundant aquatic vegetation. The brown tinted water has approximately 6 feet of clarity. Dark is stocked with Walleye, but other gamefish species are present in good numbers. A standard fisheries survey was completed in Dark Lake during the summer of 2019 as part of a rotation of regularly scheduled surveys in the International Falls Management Area.   <br> \n <br> \nBluegill abundance is similar to what would be expected for this lake class, but the average size is larger than expected. Bluegill averaged about 7 inches and some up to nearly 9 inches were sampled. Bluegill up to 7 years old were sampled, and growth was significantly faster than other lakes in the International Falls Management Area. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie were sampled for the first time ever in Dark Lake during this survey. Abundance was average for this lake class and the average size was good with some fish up to nearly 11 inches in the sample. The vast majority of the Black Crappie were 3 to 5 years old, but two older individuals (6 and 9 years old) were present. The abundance of young fish indicates that this population has likely grown to a self-sustaining population.  <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass were stocked in 1946 and low numbers have been occasionally captured in the past. Bass sampling was not able to be completed due to equipment failures during the 2019 field season. Largemouth are most likely still present in Dark Lake at numbers that may be of interest to some anglers.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike in Dark Lake are abundant and relatively small. The average size is slightly less than 20 inches, and the largest sampled in 2019 was approximately 26 inches. Dark Lake is in the north central Pike management zone, which includes a harvest regulation aimed toward increasing the size structure of these high density Northern Pike populations. The new regulation protects medium sized Pike (22 to 26 inches) while allowing an expanded bag limit of 10 fish, with no more than 2 over 26 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye fingerlings have been stocked in even numbered years in Dark Lake, but abundance is still relatively low. There is a good variety of sizes in Dark Lake, with lengths ranging from 11 to nearly 24 inches during the 2019 survey.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch catch rates were within the expected range for similar lakes. Perch in Dark Lake are relatively small and are primarily a forage species for large predators. However, a few manage to reach sizes that may be of interest to anglers. The largest sampled in 2019 were over 8 inches in length.  <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species sampled during the 2019 survey include Bullheads and White Suckers.  <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

Average size sampled was 20.3 inches long, and 1.9 pounds.  The largest northern pike sampled was 27.9 inches.  Growth is slow, and the preferred forage is yellow perch.    Walleye were present in low numbers, but were of good size.  Average size was 18.8 inches long, and 2.9 pounds.  The largest walleye sampled was 27.2 inches long.  Growth was fast, compared to other lakes in the state.  Few walleye are encountered by anglers.    Yellow perch and bluegills were sampled in high numbers for a lake of this type.  Average length of perch and bluegills was 5.8 inches and 6.4 inches respectively.  Growth rate for perch is slow, and for bluegill is average, compared to other Minnesota lakes.  Largemouth bass have been sampled historically, but have not been sampled in the last 2 assessments.  White suckers and bullheads are also present in the lake.  </p>",

Average pike length was 18.7 inches although occasional larger fish up to 34 inches were sampled in 1998.     Walleye number, while only 2.5 per gillnet, were at their highest level since 1984 with the bulk of the sampled fish from the 1995 year class.  Average length was 14.7 inches with a few fish over 21 inches.     Electrofishing done in the spring of 1998 sampled only thirteen largemouth bass with the majority of the bass from the 1997 year class resulting in an average length of 6.5 inches.  Bluegill and yellow perch numbers dropped dramatically from the previous investigation.  White sucker, black and brown bullhead and golden shiner make up the rest of the sampled fish community.</p>",

Walleyes are the primary focus of management and have been stocked since 1948.  However, several species of sportfish were present in 2004 and stocked in the past.    Bluegill abundance has flucuated greatly since 1972 when they were first documented in Dark Lake.  In 2004, bluegill abundance in trap nets was 7.11 fish/set, which was an increase since the previous investigation in 1998, but still below the first quartile of 9.50 fish/set for class 32 lakes.  The largest captured in 2004 was 9.2 inches t and the oldest was seven years old.  Age in trap nets ranged from 3-7, with age-3 composing 38% of the sample.  Growth was greater than the area and statewide means.      Largemouth bass were stocked in 1946 and low numbers have been occasionally captured.  Night electrofishing was used to sample largemouth bass on June 2, 2004.  A total of 1 bass was captured at a rate of 0.6 fish per hour of on-time.  However, age-0 largemouth bass were the second most abundant species captured while seining in July, 2004.         Northern pike gill net abundance was slightly lower than most class 32 lakes.  Five year-classes were captured in gill nets and age ranged from 2-6 years.  Total length ranged from 15.4-29.4 inches.  Growth and mean weight was below what is usually found in similar lakes.      Walleye gill net abundance was 2.00 fish/set, which was above what is found in most class 32 lakes.  Four year-classes were present and age ranged from 2-6 years in gill nets.  Most walleyes captured were large; total length ranged from 11.2-22.2 inches with a mean of 16.9 in gill nets.  Growth was much greater than the area and statewide averages.        Yellow perch abundance has varied greatly over time.  In 2004, abundance of adult yellow perch was low and only two were captured in gill nets, which was the lowest abundance ever documented in Dark Lake.  However, age-0 yellow perch were the most abundant species captured while seining in July.   </p>",
