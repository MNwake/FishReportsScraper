The walleye population was entirely self-sustained, with good natural reproduction in most years.  Yellow perch were also abundant, and unusually large for lakes of this type.  Most ranged from 10 to 12 inches.  Northern pike and smallmouth bass were present in fair numbers.  Most of the northern pike collected were small, two and three-year-old fish.</p>",

The walleye population was entirely natural, and several year classes were included in the catch.  Walleye growth rates had been fast for a lake of this class, probably due to the presence of an excellent yellow perch forage base.Yellow perch were abundant, and many large fish were present.  Yellow perch growth had also been relatively fast for this area.  The northern pike catch was about average for lakes of this class, and for this lake historically.  Northern pike growth had been slow, despite the excellent forage base, and most of the fish collected in 1998 were less than 25 inches in length.  The smallmouth bass catch was similar to past catches in this lake.  South Fowl Lake has not been known as a good smallmouth bass lake.</p>",
