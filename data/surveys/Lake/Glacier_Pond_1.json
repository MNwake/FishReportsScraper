                "narrative": "<p>Glacier Pond 1 is in Ecological Lake class 13, which consists of 84 lakes in northeast Minnesota that are small and have soft (unmineralized) water.  Glacier Pond 1 is smaller, is more bowl-shaped, and has harder (more mineralized) water than most of the lakes in this lake class.Glacier Pond 1 thermally stratifies in midsummer with surface temperatures about 70 F and bottom temperatures in the 40's F.  Adequate oxygen for trout (more than 5 ppm) is retained to a depth of about 17 ft, where the temperature is in the mid 60's F.  Winter oxygen was checked in eighteen years from 1975 through 2004 and was marginal in some years.  Winterkill of trout in Glacier Pond 1 has been suspected during severe winters in the past.  The west half of the lake is shallow and has a muck bottom.  The east half is deeper with gravel and boulder shoal areas.  There are no inlets and the outlet has a filter barrier to prevent fish migration.Glacier Pond 1 was poisoned in 1983 with rotenone, which eradicated the northern pike, yellow perch, and white sucker that were present.  Rainbow trout have been stocked annually since 1984.  The 2004 fish population assessment consisted of two gillnets, four 3/4\" bar mesh trapnets, and two 1/4\" bar mesh trapnets.  Six previous trout assessments, dating back to 1985, used 1-2 gillnets. Three of these previous assessments also used 3/4\" and 1/4\" trapnets.Only one trout was captured in the gillnets in 2004.  Trout catches in recent assessments (1994-2004) have ranged from 0.5/gillnet to 1.5/gillnet and were much lower than catches in previous assessments (1985-1991), which ranged from 7.0/gillnet to 16.5/gillnet.  The catch of trout by weight in 2004 of 0.6 lb/gillnet was lower than the median catch of 4.6 lb/gillnet in previous assessments on this lake and was lower than the median trout catch (all species combined) of 2.5 lb/gillnet in recent investigations on 25 stream trout lakes in the Tower Fisheries Management Area.The trout catch in the 3/4\" trapnets in 2004 (0.2/trapnet) was lower than in previous assessments, where catches ranged from 1.0-2.0/trapnet.Similar to previous small mesh trapnettings, the 1/4\" trapnets in 2004 captured high numbers of fathead minnows and northern redbelly dace.</p>",

Glacier Pond 1 is smaller, has a rounder shape, and has harder (more mineralized) water than most of the lakes in this lake class.Glacier Pond 1 stratifies in midsummer and has less than 5 ppm oxygen below about 18 ft.  The west half of the lake is shallow and has a muck bottom; the east half is deeper with a gravel and boulder bottom.  Aquatic plants are scattered along the shoreline; pondweeds are the most common.All fish were removed from Glacier Pond 1 in 1983 and rainbow trout have been stocked annually since 1984.  Only two trout were caught in 1997, similar to the low catch of one trout in 1994.  Three assessments prior to 1994 caught much higher numbers of trout (10-16/gillnet).  Both of the trout caught in 1997 had been stocked as fingerlings the previous fall.By weight, only 0.3 lb of trout per gillnet was caught in 1997, much lower than the average catch of 10.4 lb/gillnet in three assessments in this lake prior to 1994 and lower than the median catch of 6.0 lb/gillnet for 24 stream trout lakes in the Ely Management Area.  Winterkill (low oxygen) or summerkill (high temperatures) are the likely cause of low trout numbers in 1997.Also captured in 1997 were high numbers of several species of minnows.  These species had been observed in previous assessments in this lake.</p>",

Glacier Pond 1 is surrounded by US Forest Service land but is located outside the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness.  There is a small parking area located in an old gravel pit located near the lake.  The lake has recieved moderate to high angling pressure in the past.\n\nIn 2010, two experimental gill nets were set in Glacier Pond 1 to assess the rainbow trout population and determine the success of yearling stocking.  A total of three trout weighing 5.6 pounds (2.8 lbs/net) were caught in the nets. The three trout averaged 15.8 inches in length with the largest individual weighing over two pounds. The 2010 catch rate was the second highest of five assessments dating back to 1994.  Glacier Pond 1 was chemically reclaimed in 1983 to eliminate competition for trout.  Three assessments between two and eight years following reclamation produced higher numbers of rainbow trout.  </p>",

Glacier Pond 1 is smaller, has a rounder shape, and has harder (more mineralized) water than most of the lakes in this lake class.Glacier Pond 1 thermally stratifies in midsummer and retains good oxygen for trout (more than 5 ppm) to a depth of about 18 ft, where the water temperature is about 62 F.  Winter oxygen has been marginal in some years and some winterkill has been suspected.  The west half of the lake is shallow and has a muck bottom; the east half is deeper with gravel and boulder shoal areas.  There are no inlets and the outlet has a filter barrier to prevent fish migration.Glacier Pond 1 was reclaimed in 1983 and rainbow trout have been stocked annually since 1984.  The 2001 assessment consisted of two standard gillnets set in late May.  Five previous trout assessments dating back to 1985 consisted of 1-2 gillnets and varying sizes and numbers of trapnets.Only three trout were caught in 2001, similar to the low catches of two trout in 1997 and one trout in 1994.  Assessments from 1985 through 1991 caught higher numbers of trout (7-16/gillnet), however the sizes of trout caught in 2001 (14\" - 20\") were much larger than the average size of 12\" in the earlier assessments.  The total trout catch by weight in 2001 of 3.9 lb/gillnet was lower than the average catch of 6.6 lb/gillnet in all previous assessments on this lake and was lower than the average catch of 5.0 lb/gillnet in recent assessments of 25 stream trout lakes (excluding mine pit lakes) in the Tower Fisheries Management Area.</p>",
