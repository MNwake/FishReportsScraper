                "narrative": "<p>Island River Lake is a 122 acre lake with a maximum depth of 7 feet located in a remote area just south of the Boundary Water Canoe Area Wilderness.  The Island River runs through the lake and there are two campsites located on the lake, one official United States Forest Service site and one user-made campsite.  The best way to access Island River Lake is a short channel or portage trail (40 yards) from Comfort Lake, which has a carry-down access.  The road into Comfort Lake is rough and a portion of the road was burned over in the 2011 Pagami Creek Fire, a high clearance four-wheel drive vehicle is strongly recommended and there is a high potential for trees to be down over the road. <br> \n <br> \nA population of Black Crappie became established in Island River Lake sometime prior to 2008.  The purposes of this spring netting were to assess the state of the Black Crappie population and to compliment the summer survey. <br> \n <br> \nA total of six Black Crappie were sampled in trap nets.  These fish ranged in length from 5 to 13 inches with an average length of 9 inches and an average weight of 0.6 pounds.  A total of five year classes were captured with fish up to age-10 present in the sample.  Colder than expected water temperatures likely resulted in the low catch rate.  The sample collected from a standard survey conducted in August of 2017 was larger and likely a better representation of the Black Crappie population. <br> \n   <br> \nIn addition to Black Crappie, eight Northern Pike were sampled with a mean length of 14 inches and a maximum length of 24 inches.  One 25 inch Walleye was sampled, it was estimated to be 15 years old.  Two Yellow Perch were sampled, both were approximately 8 inches long.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Island River Lake is a 122 acre lake with a maximum depth of 7 feet located in a remote area just south of the Boundary Water Canoe Area Wilderness (BWCAW).  The Island River runs through the lake and there are two campsites located on the lake, one official United States Forest Service (USFS) site and one user made campsite.  Island River Lake is the upstream end of an 8 mile USFS canoe route with maintained portages that runs down to the Island River BWCAW access point.  The best way to access Island River Lake is by way of a short channel or portage trail (40 yards) from Comfort Lake, which has a carry down access.  The road into Comfort Lake is rough and a portion of the road was burned over in the 2011 Pagami Creek Fire, a high clearance four wheel drive vehicle is strongly recommended and there is a high potential for trees to be down over the road. <br> \n <br> \nThe purpose of the summer 2017 survey was to provide an update on the status of the fish community, which is maintained entirely through natural reproduction.   <br> \n <br> \nWalleye catch in Island River Lake was slightly below average when compared to other area lakes.  The average weight of Walleye sampled was right around a pound with the heaviest Walleye tipping the scales at roughly five and a half pounds.  Average length was approximately 14 inches with the longest fish measuring 25 inches.  Seven different ages of Walleye were identified in the sample ranging from zero to 10 years old.  Age-2 fish were the most common and averaged nine inches long at the time of sampling.  Growth of Walleye in Island River Lake was average when compared to similar lakes in the area.     <br> \n <br> \nThe catch of Northern Pike in Island River Lake was below average when compared to other area lakes, but the average size was good.  The average weight of Northern Pike in the sample was approximately three pounds with fish up to seven pounds sampled.  Northern Pike averaged 22 inches long with the longest fish measuring 33 inches.  Northern Pike ranged from zero to 11 years old, and age-1 fish made up 29 percent of the catch.  These fish only averaged 11 inches at the time of sampling.  Northern Pike growth was near average relative to other area lakes. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie catch was slightly better than average when compared with other area lakes.  On average, the Black Crappie sampled weighed just less than a pound, better than the average when compared to other similar lakes.  The average length of Black Crappie sampled was a little over 11 inches with fish as long as 14 inches sampled.  Age analysis determined several year classes are present and Black Crappie growth was near average when compared to other area lakes.  Based on the numbers captured, size range, and age range, Black Crappie appear to be well established in Island River Lake.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch catch was well above average compared to other area lakes, but average weight was only 0.2 pounds.  Yellow Perch length averaged seven inches with the longest fish measuring between nine and ten inches.  Several year classes were present and growth of Yellow Perch in Island River Lake was average relative to other area lakes. <br> \n <br> \nIn addition to game fish species, White Sucker, Rock Bass, Pumpkinseed Sunfish, a Burbot, Johnny Darter, Golden Shiner, and Trout-Perch were sampled.  Young of the year Largemouth Bass were also captured for the first time in Island River Lake.  This may indicate a spawning population exists in the lake; Largemouth Bass have previously been sampled upstream in the Island River and Silver Island Lake.  It is not known at this time whether a fishable population of Largemouth Bass will become established in Island River Lake. <br> \n <br> \nDespite being remote and difficult to access, Island River Lake offers diverse angling opportunities for those willing to put in the effort.  The lake supports populations of both Walleye and Black Crappie with good numbers and size structures.  There are also opportunities to camp on the lake and opportunities to explore the Island River above and below the lake.   <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>The walleye numbers sampled in Island River Lake was below average for the lake class, but was similar to past investigations on this lake.   The average length was 14.6 inches with one 26 inch walleye sampled.  The walleye population in Island River Lake is self-sustaining.   <br> \nNorthern pike numbers were also lower than average for the lake class; however, the average length of northern pike was an impressive 26.5 inches with two fish greater than 35 inches sampled.  Small, remote, lightly fished lakes like Island River Lake often produce some quality size northern pike. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch numbers were well above average for the lake class, with an average length of 6.8 inches with a few  nine inches or larger.  White sucker were sampled in average numbers and along with yellow perch provide the forage base for larger predator fish in Island River Lake. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappies were sampled for the first time in the 2009 lake survey; however, anglers had reported catching black crappie for a number of years.  Crappie numbers were near average for the lake class with fish over 13 inches sampled.  Good spawning habitat in Island River Lake allows for a self-sustaining population. <br> \n <br> \nThe preferred access is a carry-in at the Comfort Lake BWCA entry point. Across Comfort Lake; then depending on the water level, pull through the outlet channel or take a short portage around the channel into Island River Lake.  A second access from the Island River (outlet); is a 60 rod portage around rapids to the west end of Island River Lake.  The third access is a trail from the old access road on the far eastern end of the lake.  This is a rough and narrow road and used mainly to access the eastern portion of the lake.  In summer, when vegetation is at its peak, the eastern one-half of the lake is difficult to navigate with an outboard motor.  Two USFS remote water-access campsites are located on Island River Lake.  Island River Lake is not within the BWCAW, outboard motor use is allowed.  BWCAW permits and day-use permits are not needed on Island River Lake <br> \n</p>",
