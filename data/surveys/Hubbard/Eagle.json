                "narrative": "<p>Present walleye population is composed of mainly 2, 3, 4, and 5 age groups; this goes along with the stocking.  Abundance is below area average; growth is average; spawning area is fair.  Northern pike are slightly above average in numbers; spawning area is good.  Yellow perch caught higher in numbers in trapnets, lower in gillnets.  Bullhead species, tullibees, rock bass, pumpkinseed, bluegill, black crappie are present, but low in numbers.  Adult suckers slightly above average.Management Recommendations:Northern pike stocking not necessary at this time.  It appears that there is sufficient spawning area to maintain a fishable population of northern pike.Walleye population suggests that a significant contribution has been made by stocked fingerlings.  Therefore, it is recommended that fingerling stocking be continued at the rate of one pound of fingerlings (50/lb) per littoral acre.  To provide a means of future fingerling stocking evaluation, every third year should be skipped.</p>",

Shoal water soil types are as follows: 75 percent sand, 20 percent marl, and 5 percent rubble.Hay Creek enters the lake from Island Lake, and the outlet from Eagle Lake flows to Potato Lake.  Most of the time this channel can be traversed by small boats.Test netting indicated above average size populations of northern pike and bullhead, and fair-sized populations of perch, pumpkinseed, rock bass, and crappie.This lake has five resorts with 38 cabins and an additional 16 cottages or homes.  There were 18 boats located here at the time of the survey.  During the summer of 1961 this lake had approximately 16,674 man-hours of fishing pressure on it.  During the winter of 1961-62 there was a maximum of 12 fish houses located on this lake.Fish StockingAlthough Eagle Lake has some natural walleye spawning areas within the lake, supplemental plants are apparently needed to maintain this fishery.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Eagle Lake is located in Hubbard County, seven miles north of Park Rapids.  Eagle Lake has a surface area of 411 acres and a maximum depth of 77 feet.  There is a public access located on the west shore of the lake.  Eagle Lake is part of the Island, Eagle, Potato chain of lakes, with connections to Island Lake upstream and Potato Lake downstream.  Boating access in the river connecting these lakes is possible with a small to medium size boats.  Eagle is a popular fishing lake, and provides angling opportunities for walleye, northern pike, and panfish. <br> \n <br> \nThe Minnesota Dept. of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics.  Eagle Lake is in lake class 25.  Other area lakes in this same classification include Bad Axe, Belle Taine, West Crooked, Big and Little Mantrap, Ojibway, Little Sand, and Spider. <br> \n <br> \nEagle Lake is well known for its walleye fishery and is a popular fishing spot, especially early in the season.  Walleye abundance (7.4 walleye/gillnet) was up from past surveys and above the current management goal of (3 walleye/gillnet).  The 2007 gillnet catch rate of 7.4 walleye/net is the highest for all surveys conducted on Eagle since 1961.  Walleye abundance in past surveys has generally fluctuated around the current management goal.  Sampled walleye had an average length and weight of 14.7 inches and 1.3 pounds.  Eagle Lake is stocked with walleye fingerlings during odd numbered years.  Yellow perch, an important forage species for walleye, were sampled in high numbers.  Yellow perch were small in size, with few perch an acceptable size for angling. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike were sampled in high numbers (8.2 pike/gillnet), at the upper end of the range \"typical\" for this lake class.  The 2002 survey had similar pike abundance, while earlier surveys sampled pike in low to moderate numbers.  Sampled northern pike had an average length and weight of 22.1 inches and 2.6 pounds, with pike measured up to 32.7 inches.  Eagle Lake, as well as surrounding lakes, have seen an increase in northern pike numbers in recent years.  Higher than normal water levels in Hubbard County in the late 1990's and early 2000's have provided excellent spawning conditions for northern pike.  While dominated by small pike, Eagle Lake can produce a few large fish.  Important forage species such as tullibee (cisco), white sucker, and shorthead redhorse are present providing the right conditions for growing large pike. <br> \n <br> \nWhile not known as a panfish lake, Eagle does support fishing opportunities for black crappie and bluegill.  Black crappie were sampled in low numbers, similar to past surveys.  Anglers can expect to find black crappie in the 10-12 inch size range.  The bluegill population in Eagle Lake has been increasing.  Bluegill were sampled in moderate numbers (26.1 bluegill/trapnet), within the range \"typical\" for this lake class.  Bluegill abundance in surveys prior to 2000 was low, well below the range \"typical\" for this lake class.  Anglers can expect to find bluegill in the 6-8 inch size range. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled in moderate numbers included pumpkinseed, rock bass, shorthead redhorse, yellow bullhead, brown bullhead, and black bullhead.  Largemouth bass are present in low numbers when compared to other area lakes. <br> \n</p>",

A survey targeting near shore fish species was conducted by Park Rapids Fisheries Staff on August 3, 2017 to assess populations of non-game and small sport fish. Ten 100-foot sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake shore, sampling a variety of habitat types. Each site was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot 1/8th-inch mesh seine, depending on habitat conditions.   <br> \n <br> \nDuring this assessment, one site was sampled with a 15-foot seine. Site conditions prevented the use of seines at nine sites.  Backpack electrofishing was done at all ten sites, several of which were conducted from the side of the boat.  Nearshore sampling captured several species of fish including Bluegill, Central Mudminnow, Johnny Darter, Largemouth Bass, and Yellow Perch.  Nearshore catches will be used along with gillnet and trapnet catch data from a standard fisheries survey on July 24, 2017, to calculate a fish-based Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) score which is indicative of the health of Eagle Lake.   <br> \n <br> \nThis survey is contributing to a watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.  Eagle Lake is located in the Crow Wing River Watershed.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Eagle Lake is located seven miles north of Park Rapids in west-central Hubbard County. Eagle has a surface area of 424 acres and a maximum depth of 77 feet. A DNR owned public access is located on the west shore of the lake off US-71. Access is also available by small craft from Island Lake which lies to the north of Eagle or Potato which lies to the south. Eagle is a very popular lake for fishing and water recreation during the summer. Eagle provides angling opportunities for Walleye, and Northern Pike, and Panfish. <br> \nThe Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics. Eagle is in class 25. Class 25 lakes are generally deep, very clear, have hard water, and are irregularly shaped. Other class 25 lakes in the Park Rapids management include: Bad Axe, Belle Taine, Big Mantrap, Dead (Upper Ojibway), Island, Little Mantrap, Little Sand, Spider, Straight, Third Crow Wing, Two Inlets, and West Crooked. <br> \nWalleye abundance was in line with recent surveys, and above the management goal. Most fish were spread out evenly in size from 12 - 20 inches. A strong class of 7.5 - 11 inch Walleye should provide good angling in future years. Walleye sampled had an average length of 15.2 inches with fish measuring up to 27.8 inches. Yellow Perch, an important forage species for Walleye were sampled in low numbers but some of the largest were a suitable size for anglers. <br> \nNorthern Pike abundance was up and was the fourth highest recorded number for all surveys on Eagle. Northern Pike numbers in past surveys have generally fluctuated in moderate numbers for this lake class. Anglers will find the Northern Pike population spread out from 14 - 30 inches in length, with around half of them from 18 - 22 inches. Northern Pike sampled had an average length of 21 inches and weighed 1.9 pounds. <br> \nEagle supports a good Black Crappie population and angling for them is popular year-round. Anglers will find Black Crappie in the 9.5 - 13 inch size range. Eagle also provides good fishing for Bluegill and Pumpkinseed; with some nicer fish up to 9 inches. <br> \nCurrently, no Aquatic Invasive Species (AIS) have been identified in Eagle. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Eagle Lake is located in Hubbard County, seven miles north of Park Rapids.  Eagle Lake has a surface area of 411 acres and a maximum depth of 77 feet.  The Fish Hook River flows through Eagle Lake, with connections to Island Lake upstream and Potato Lake downstream.  Eagle Lake is part of the Two Inlets, Island, Eagle, Potato, and Fish Hook chain of lakes.  A public access is located on the west shore of the lake.  Access is also possible from Island and Potato lakes through the river channel.  The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical and chemical characteristics.  Eagle Lake is in lake class 25.  Other area lakes in this same class include: Bad Axe (2 miles northeast of Emmaville), Belle Taine (west of Nevis), West Crooked (7 miles northwest of Nevis), Big Mantrap (2 miles east of Emmaville), Little Mantrap (16 miles north of Park Rapids), Ojibway (5 miles north of Dorset), Little Sand (1.5 miles north of Dorset), and Spider (2.5 miles north of Nevis).Eagle Lake is well known for its walleye fishery and is a popular fishing spot especially early in the season.  Walleye were sampled in low numbers (1.1/net), below the range typical for lake class 25.  Historical walleye gillnet catch rates have been stable, but slightly higher than the 1997 catch rate ranging from 1.7/net (1961, 76) to 4.5/net (1987).  Sampled walleye ranged in length from 8.4 to 27.8 inches.  Walleye growth rates were similar to other class 25 lakes.  Nine of the twelve walleye aged corresponded to years of walleye fingerling stocking.  Eagle Lake is stocked with walleye fingerlings every other year.  Walleye fingerling stocking was switched to odd calendar years starting in the fall of 1997.  This will put Eagle Lake on the same stocking schedule as other lakes in the chain (Two Inlets, Island, Potato, Fish Hook).  Having the same stocking schedule on these lakes will allow for better evaluation of natural reproduction and walleye stocking success.  Eagle Lake has suitable walleye spawning habitat, especially in the inlet and outlet areas.  The northern pike gillnet catch rate of 3.8/net is within the range typical for lake class 25.  With the exception of 1961 (8.2/net), historical northern pike gillnet catch rates have been similar, ranging from 1.0/net (1976) to 4.3/net (1982).  Northern pike were small in size, with an average length and weight of 16.3 inches and 1.0 pounds.  Northern pike up to 26.4 inches were sampled.  Northern pike growth rates were slow compared to other class 25 lakes.The yellow perch gillnet catch rate of 4.3/net is within the range typical for lake class 25.  Yellow perch gillnet catch rates have fluctuated in past surveys.  The prior survey in 1992 had a gillnet catch rate of 45.7/net, while historical catch rates have ranged from 2.0/net (1987) to 55.0/net (1976).  The yellow perch population in Eagle Lake provides a limited fishery as well as a forage base for the walleye and northern pike population.  Sampled yellow perch were an average length of 7.0 inches with fish measured up to 9.9 inches.Eagle Lake is known for having a low abundance but quality-sized black crappie population.  The black crappie trapnet catch rate of 0.3/net is below the typical range for lake class 25 and similar to past surveys.  Black crappie up to 12.0 inches were sampled.Eagle Lake has a low abundance bluegill population.  The bluegill trapnet catch rate of 0.9/net is below the range typical for lake class 25.  Historical bluegill trapnet catch rates have been similar ranging from 0.6/net (1982) to 5.9/net (1992).  Bluegill were large in size with fish measured up to 9.5 inches.  Bluegill growth rates were above other class 25 lakes.The tullibee (cisco) gillnet catch rate of 2.0/net is within the range typical for lake class 25 and similar to past surveys.  Tullibee provide an additional forage base for the walleye and northern pike populations.Other fish sampled in moderate numbers were white sucker, pumpkinseed, and rock bass.  Species sampled in low numbers included yellow bullhead, brown bullhead, shorthead redhorse, and largemouth bass.Anglers can help maintain or improve the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for table fare, but encourages release of medium to large-size fish.  Releasing these fish will help maintain the fish population in Eagle Lake and provides anglers with opportunities to catch more and larger fish in the future.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Eagle Lake is located in Hubbard County, seven miles north of Park Rapids.  Eagle Lake has a surface area of 411 acres and a maximum depth of 77 feet.  There is a public access located on the west shore of the lake.  Eagle Lake is part of the Island, Eagle, Potato chain of lakes, with connections to Island lake upstream and Potato Lake downstream.  Boating access in the river connecting these lakes is possible with a small to medium size boat.The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical and chemical characteristics.  Eagle Lake is in lake class 25.  Other area lakes in this same classification include Bad Axe, Belle Taine, West Crooked, Big and Little Mantrap, Ojibway, Little Sand, and Spider.Eagle Lake is well known for its walleye fishery and is a popular fishing spot, especially early in the season.  Walleye abundance (1.8 walleye/gillnet) was below the management goal of 3.0 walleye/gillnet and at the low end of the range \"typical\" for this lake class.  Walleye numbers were also low in the previous survey in 1997, while surveys in the late 1980's and early 1990's had walleye catch rates above the management goal.  The walleye  population in Eagle Lake is being maintained by a combination of natural reproduction and stocking by the DNR.  Good walleye spawning habitat is found in the inlet and outlet areas.  Eagle Lake is stocked with walleye fingerlings during odd numbered years.  Stocking rates were increased in 1999 to try to bolster walleye numbers in Eagle Lake.  Yellow perch, an important forage species for walleye, were sampled in moderate numbers.Northern pike were sampled in high numbers (8.4 pike/gillnet), at the upper end of the range \"typical\" for this lake class.  Northern pike abundance in past surveys has been much lower, below or at the low end of the range \"typical\" for this lake class.  The northern pike sample was dominated by small, \"hammer handle\" pike, with an average length and weight of 19.5 inches and 1.7 pounds.  Eagle Lake, as well as surrounding lakes, has seen an increase in northern pike numbers in recent years.  Higher than normal water levels in Hubbard County in the late 1990's and early 2000's have provided excellent spawning conditions for northern pike.  High recruitment of young fish and slow growth rates are limiting the northern pike population in Eagle Lake.  While dominated by small pike, Eagle Lake can produce a few large fish.  Important forage species such as tullibee (cisco), white sucker, and shorthead redhorse are present providing the right conditions for growing large pike.While not known as a panfish lake, Eagle Lake does support fishing opportunities for black crappie and bluegill.  Black crappie were sampled in low numbers, similar to past surveys.  Anglers can expect to find crappie in the 10-12 inch size range.  Bluegill were sampled in moderate numbers (15.4 bluegill/trapnet).  Bluegill have been sampled in low numbers in past surveys.  Bluegill in the 6-7 inch size range are common.Other species sampled in moderate numbers include yellow bullhead, rock bass, and pumpkinseed.  Largemouth bass and brown bullhead were sampled in low numbers.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Eagle Lake is located seven miles north of Park Rapids in Hubbard County. Eagle has a surface area of 424 acres and a maximum depth of 77 feet.  A state owned public access is located on the southwest shore of the lake off US Highway 71.  Eagle Lake provides angling opportunities for Walleye, Yellow Perch, Northern Pike and panfish. <br> \nThe Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics.  Eagle Lake is in lake class 25. Class 25 lakes generally are irregularly shaped, deep, with hard and clear water.  Other class 25 lakes in the Park Rapids area include: Bad Axe, Belle Taine, West Crooked, Third Crow Wing, Island, Big Mantrap, Little Mantrap, Ojibway, Little Sand, Spider, Straight, and Two Inlets.  <br> \nWalleye abundance was good and most are a great size for anglers of 14-19 inches, with a number of smaller fish for the future. The average length was 16 inches, with the largest sampled at 27.5 inches.  Most perch were small, but a few are available to anglers. <br> \nNorthern Pike abundance was good, but they are generally small with an average size of 19.5 inches and 1.6 pounds.  Most fish were 15 to 24 inches, with the largest sampled at 31 inches. <br> \nAngling opportunities for panfish include Black Crappie, Bluegill and Pumpkinseed. Black Crappie abundance was good, and most fish were 9-12.5 inches. Bluegill and Pumpkinseed abundance was lower than recent years.  The majority were under 6 inches, but some were 7-9 inches.  <br> \nCurrently no aquatic invasive species (AIS) have been identified in Eagle. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of nearshore fish species in Eagle Lake was conducted beginning on July 27th, 2020 by Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program Staff. Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at 10 sampling stations, but one station was sampled from the boat due to site conditions. Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample three stations, a 15-foot seine was used at six stations, and site conditions prevented the use of seines at one station. Nearshore sampling captured 24 species of fish including seven species that are intolerant of disturbance (Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Banded Killifish, Logperch, Mimic Shiner, Pugnose Shiner, and Rock Bass) and one that is tolerant of disturbance (Fathead Minnow). <br> \n <br> \nA concurrent summer trap net survey was conducted July 27th-28th, 2020 by IBI Program Staff. Nine trap nets were set along the shoreline and in shallow offshore locations that encompassed multiple habitat types.  Bluegill and Pumpkinseed Sunfish comprised a majority of the trap net catch by number, and Northern Pike and Bluegill comprised a majority of the catch by biomass. The number of Bluegill and Pumpkinseeds per net were both between the 25th and 50th quartiles for similar Lake Class 25 lakes, while the mean weight of Bluegill were also between the 25th and 50th quartiles for Lake Class 25 lakes. <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore and trap net data was combined with gill net data from a July 2017 survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based IBI (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment. In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g. Banded Killifish, Pugnose Shiner, and Rock Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g. Green Sunfish, Fathead Minnows, and Common Carp). The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.  <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Crow Wing River Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Walleye gillnet catch rates (4.33 fish/set and 5.13 lbs/set) were within the normal ranges for lake class 25 and have been since 1961.  Mean weight of individual walleye was 1.18 pounds.  Growth rates are generally slow after age 2; mean length at age 5 is 15.39 inches.  These slow growth rates result in a small size structure (PSD=32, RSD-P=4).  Only one walleye sampled in the gillnets was >18 inches.  Some natural reproduction is occurring in Eagle Lake, as evidenced by the 1987, 1989 and 1991 year classes, which accounted for 44% of the sampled walleye.  A dominant 1989 (age 3) year class comprised 33% of the sampled walleye.  Again, note the 1989 year class is recruitment from natural reproduction.Number of northern pike sampled (2.67 fish/gillnet) was below the first quartile, whereas 8.13 lbs/gillnet was within the normal ranges for lakes in class 25.  Mean weight of individual northern pike was 3.04 pounds.  Northern pike abundance has decreased since 1961, but along with this decrease in number has been an increase in mean weight.  Northern pike exhibit good early growth, averaging 17.29 inches at age 3.  However, growth rates decline as the fish age and by age 7, mean lengths are well below the state average.  These varying growth rates are reflected in the size structure.  A good proportion of northern pike are quality length (PSD=63); however, only one northern pike sampled was >28 inches (RSD-P=6).  Age analysis suggests consistent northern pike recruitment.Bluegill catch rates were below the first quartile for this class of lakes and have been since 1961.  The size structure indicates a high density of quality-length bluegill (PSD=74), but very few preferred-length fish (RSD-P=2).  Growth rates of bluegill are good and account for the abundance of quality fish.  Mean length at age 3 is 5.04 inches.  Pumpkinseed abundance has varied slightly since 1961.  The 1992 catch rates were within the normal ranges.  Pumpkinseed size structure is very small (PSD=6).  Yellow perch density has recovered from a low year in 1987 to rise above the third quartile in 1992.  Size structure of yellow perch (PSD=11) is similar to that of the pumpkinseed.  Rock bass trapnet catch rates were also above the third quartile in 1992, for the first time since the 1961 survey.Catches of white sucker and shorthead redhorse were above the third quartile, black bullhead catch rates were within the normal ranges and tullibee and yellow bullhead catches were below the first quartile for lake class 25.  Black bullhead density was high in 1976 and 1987, but no longer appears to be a problem.  None of the other non-game species has ever had an abundant population.  Current densities are also low enough to prevent any negative effects on the fish community.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Eagle Lake is located in Hubbard County, seven miles north of Park Rapids.  Eagle Lake has a surface area of 423 acres and a maximum depth of 77 feet.  There is a public access located on the west shore of the lake.  Eagle Lake is part of the Island, Eagle, and Potato chain of lakes, with connections to Island Lake upstream and Potato Lake downstream.  Boating access in the river connecting these lakes is possible with small to medium size boats, but conditions can vary with water level fluctuations. <br> \n <br> \nThe Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics.  Eagle Lake is in lake class 25.  Class 25 lakes are generally characterized by being deep, clear, hard water lakes, with an irregularly shaped shoreline.  Other class 25 lakes in the Park Rapids area include Bad Axe, Belle Taine, West Crooked, Third Crow Wing, Island, Big Mantrap, Little Mantrap, Ojibway, Little Sand, Spider, Straight, and Two Inlets. <br> \n <br> \nEagle Lake is well known for its walleye fishery and is a popular fishing spot, especially early in the season.  Walleye abundance was within the normal range for similar type lakes and at the current management goal.  Walleye abundance in past surveys has been fairly stable and similar to the 2012 survey.  Anglers will find good numbers of walleye in the 14-18 inch size range, with walleye measured up to 27 inches.  Eagle Lake is currently stocked with walleye fingerlings during odd numbered years.  Yellow perch, an important forage species for walleye, were sampled in very low numbers.  Yellow perch abundance in past surveys has generally fluctuated from moderate to high numbers. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike were sampled in moderate numbers, within the normal range for similar type lakes.  Northern pike abundance in past surveys has fluctuated from low to moderate numbers.  Sampled northern pike had an average length and weight of 20 inches and 1.7 pounds, with pike measured up to 31 inches.  While dominated by small pike, Eagle Lake can produce a few large fish.  Important forage species such as tullibee (cisco), white sucker, and shorthead redhorse are present providing the right conditions for growing large pike. <br> \n <br> \nWhile not known as a panfish lake, Eagle does support fishing opportunities for black crappie, bluegill and pumpkinseed.  Black crappie were sampled in low numbers, similar to past surveys.  Anglers can expect to find black crappie in the 9-12 inch size range.  The bluegill population in Eagle has been increasing.  Bluegill were sampled in moderate numbers, within the range for similar type lakes.  Bluegill abundance in surveys prior to 2000 was low, well below the normal range for similar type lakes.  Anglers can expect to find bluegill and pumpkinseed in the 6-8 inch size range.   <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled included moderate numbers of rock bass and low numbers of brown and yellow bullhead.  Largemouth bass are present in Eagle Lake but numbers are low compared to other area lakes. <br> \n <br> \nCurrently no aquatic invasive species (AIS) have been identified in Eagle Lake.  To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access. <br> \n</p>",
