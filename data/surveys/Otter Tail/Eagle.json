                "narrative": "<p>Eagle Lake is a 845 acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located in south-central Otter Tail County approximately eight miles south of Battle Lake.  It has a maximum depth of 46 feet and 18% of the lake is 15 feet or less in depth.  The lake is round in shape and has a shoreline length of 4.3 miles.  Shoreline substrates consist primarily of sand interspersed with areas of gravel and rubble.  Secchi disk readings, a measure of water clarity, have been taken during fisheries assessments since 1970.  The reading in 1999 was 22.6 feet; past readings have ranged from 14.8 to 19.0 feet.  A public access is located in a park on the south shoreline.  A public swimming beach is also located at the park.     Development on Eagle Lake is considered heavy.  Seasonal and residential dwellings surround the entire lake.  Emergent vegetation (i.e., cattails and bulrush) is not present and submerged vegetation consists of about twelve species.       Eagle Lake is a popular lake for both winter and open water angling.  The eighteen-year average of winter fish houses is 31.   The lake contains good populations of largemouth bass and bluegill.  These species flourish due to the amount of suitable spawning habitat that exists throughout the lake.  Black crappie have never been sampled in Eagle Lake.  Northern pike numbers are low, primarily due to a lack of suitable spawning habitat; however,  size structure is good as most of the pike sampled were over 24.0 inches.  A good population of walleye exists in Eagle Lake.  Average length and weight of walleye sampled in 1999 was 17.0 inches and 1.90 pounds with over eighty percent fifteen inches and greater in length.       Anglers are asked to practice catch and release in order to maintain this excellent size structure.  Although natural reproduction exists, walleye stocking is necessary to maintain a good walleye population in Eagle Lake.  The current stocking of walleye fingerlings biennially at double the normal rate will attempt to increase the walleye population to current management goals.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>     Eagle Lake is an 845-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located in south-central Otter Tail County approximately eight miles south of Battle Lake, MN.  Eagle Lake is located within the Pomme de Terre River Watershed; however, there are no inlets or outlets connected to the lake.  The immediate watershed is composed of agricultural land interspersed with hardwood woodlots.  The secchi disk reading during the 2008 lake survey was 25.2 feet, which indicates exceptional water clarity.  Previous secchi disk readings have ranged from 14.8 to 22.6 feet.   <br> \n     The majority of the shoreline of Eagle Lake has been extensively developed.  Homes and cabins surround the entire shoreline of the lake.  A township owned concrete public access is located in a park along the south shoreline.  A public swimming beach is also located in the park.  The shoal water substrates consist of sand and gravel.  There is no emergent vegetation present in Eagle Lake. <br> \n     Eagle Lake can be ecologically classified as a bass-panfish type of lake and this is reflected in the assemblage of the fish community.  Largemouth bass, walleye, and bluegill are the dominant fish species present in Eagle Lake.   <br> \n     Catch data from recent test-netting assessments indicate that a high-density largemouth bass population exists.  Length data from these assessments indicate that the bass population is dominated by fish less than 15.0 inches in length.  Bass ranged in length from 9.1 to 15.9 inches with an average length and weight of 12.6 inches and 1.1 pounds.  Age data indicate that reproduction is consistently good.  Bass attain an average length of 13.7 inches at five years of age. <br> \n     The bluegill test-net catch rate has exceeded the normal range for this class of lake in every survey conducted.  Age data indicate that the 2003 year class is very strong.  Twenty-six percent of the bluegill were 7.0 inches or greater in length.  Bluegill attain an average length of 6.7 inches at six years of age. <br> \n     The walleye test-net catch rate also exceeded the normal range.  Historically, walleye gill net catch rate has consistently exceeded the normal range.  Walleye ranged in length from 8.9 to 23.9 inches with an average length and weight of 15.3 inches and 1.3 pounds.  Walleye attain an average length of 14.3 inches at three years of age. <br> \n     Data from recent test-netting assessments indicate that walleye natural reproduction is very inconsistent in Eagle Lake and that walleye fingerling stocking is maintaining the population.  Catch rate data over the recent series of surveys indicate that the walleye population can be maintained at or above management goals by stocking walleye fingerlings on a biennial basis.  The DNR does not stock any fish species other than walleye in Eagle Lake.  The other species present are able to sustain their levels at or above management goals without stocking.  This is an indication of the excellent water quality and fish habitat that is available.  To maintain the excellent fishing that this lake has to offer, it is imperative to preserve the water quality and fish habitat. <br> \n     Anglers can also maintain the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large-size fish while allowing the harvest of the more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with opportunities to catch more large fish in the future. <br> \n</p>",

Bluegill size structure is poor, with few fish 7.0 inches or greater in length.  The walleye length-frequency is well represented from 7.0 to 23.0 inches, with a large year class around 17.0 inches in length.  A walleye natural reproduction assessment cannot be done because of annual fingerling stocking since 1970. <br> \n</p>",

Pike reproduction appears to be limited as all fish sampled were ages III+ or IV+.   <br> \n     Yellow bullhead abundance remains high at 24.5 per gill net lift.   <br> \n     Bluegill abundance increased from previous levels of approximately 100.0 per trap net lift to 252.0 per net; however, growth rates do not appear exceptionally slow.  Six percent of the bluegills measured were greater than 7.0 inches in length, which is similar to the 1986 survey.   <br> \n     Largemouth bass abundance remains well above area medians, suggesting a large population exists.  Largemouth bass reproduction appears good as fish aged II+ through V+ were represented in the sample.   <br> \n     Yellow perch abundance declined from 6.0 per gill net lift in 1986 to 0.7 per net.   <br> \n     Walleye abundance was 15.2 per gill net lift, which is similar to 14.7 per net in 1986 and nearly three times the area median.  Average weight of walleye was 1.2 pounds.  Although past walleye fingerling stockings makes it difficult to assess reproduction, age data indicate the presence of age-I+ walleye, a year of no stocking. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Eagle Lake is a 845-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located in south-central Otter Tail County approximately eight miles south of Battle Lake, MN.  Eagle Lake is located within the Pomme de Terre River Watershed; however, there are no inlets or outlets connected to the lake.  The immediate watershed is composed of agricultural land interspersed with hardwood woodlots.  The secchi disk reading during the 2004 lake survey was 22.6 feet, which indicates exceptional water clarity.  Previous secchi disk readings have ranged from 14.8 to 22.6 feet.  Eagle Lake is included in class 27 of the Minnesota DNR lake classification scheme.     The majority of the shoreline of Eagle Lake has been extensively developed.  Homes and cabins surround the entire shoreline of the lake.  A township owned concrete public access is located in a park along the south shoreline.  A public swimming beach is also located in the park.  The shoal water substrates consist of sand and gravel.  There is no emergent vegetation present in Eagle Lake.     Eagle Lake can be ecologically classified as a bass-panfish type of lake and this is reflected in the assemblage of the fish community.  Largemouth bass, walleye, and bluegill are the dominant fish species in Eagle Lake.       Catch data from recent test-netting assessments indicate that a high density largemouth bass population exists.  Length data from these assessments indicate that the bass population is dominated by fish less than 15.0 inches in length.  Bass ranged in length from 6.1 to 17.4 inches with an average length and weight of 11.9 inches and 1.0 pound.  Bass attain an average length of 13.1 inches at five years of age.     The bluegill test-net catch rate has exceeded the upper limit of the normal range for class 27 lakes in every survey conducted.  Bluegill exhibit consistently good reproduction.  Ten percent of the bluegill were 7.0 inches or greater in length.  Bluegill attain an average length of 7.2 inches at eight years of age.     The walleye test-net catch rate also exceeded the upper limit of the normal range.  The walleye gill net catch rate has consistently exceeded the normal range.  Walleye ranged in length from 8.7 to 26.9 inches with an average length and weight of 14.5 inches and 1.1 pounds.  Walleye attain a mean length of 15.0 inches at three years of age.     Data from recent test-netting assessments indicate that walleye natural reproduction is very inconsistent in Eagle Lake and that walleye fingerling stocking is maintaining the population.  Catch rate data over the recent series of surveys indicate that the walleye population can be maintained at or above management goals by stocking walleye fingerlings on a biennial basis.  The DNR does not stock any fish species other than walleye in Eagle Lake.  The other species present are able to sustain their levels at or above management goals without stocking.  This is an indication of the excellent water quality and fish habitat that is available.  To maintain the excellent fishing that this lake has to offer, it is imperative to preserve the water quality and fish habitat.     Anglers can also maintain the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large-size fish while allowing the harvest of the more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with opportunities to catch more large fish in the future.     </p>",

Eagle Lake is located within the Pomme de Terre River Watershed; however, there are no inlets or outlets connected to the lake.  The immediate watershed is composed of agricultural land interspersed with hardwood woodlots.  The secchi disk reading during the 2019 survey was 22.1 feet.  Previous secchi disk readings have ranged from 14.8 to 25.2 feet.   <br> \n     The majority of the shoreline has been extensively developed.  Homes and cabins surround the entire shoreline of the lake.  A township owned concrete public access is located in a park along the south shoreline.  A public swimming beach is also located in the park.  The shoal water substrates consist of sand and gravel.  There is no emergent aquatic vegetation present in Eagle Lake. <br> \n     A special gillnetting survey was conducted to analyze the Walleye and Northern Pike populations.  <br> \n     Walleye abundance has consistently remained at a high level.  Walleyes ranged in length from 8.2 to 20.0 inches with an average length and weight of 13.6 inches and 0.9 pounds.  Walleyes exhibit fast growth with an average length of 15.3 inches at four years of age. <br> \n     Northern Pike abundance has consistently remained at a very low level.  Northern Pike natural reproduction is extremely limited due to the lack of emergent aquatic vegetation.  Pike ranged in length from 14.8 to 28.4 inches.   <br> \n     Anglers can maintain the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large-size fish while allowing the harvest of the more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with opportunities to catch more large fish in the future. <br> \n     Eagle Lake was designated as infested with zebra mussels in 2019.  Aquatic invasive species are threatening Minnesota waters.  Aquatic invasive species can potentially harm water quality, water recreation, aquatic habitat, native species, and fish populations.  Anglers can help prevent the introduction and spread of invasive species by following watercraft transportation laws.  <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>     Eagle Lake is an 845-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located in south-central Otter Tail County approximately eight miles south of Battle Lake, MN.  Eagle Lake is located within the Pomme de Terre River Watershed; however, there are no inlets or outlets connected to the lake.  The immediate watershed is composed of agricultural land interspersed with hardwood woodlots.  The secchi disk reading during the 2014 lake survey was 17.0 feet.  Previous secchi disk readings have ranged from 14.8 to 25.2 feet.   <br> \n     The majority of the shoreline of Eagle Lake has been extensively developed.  Homes and cabins surround the entire shoreline of the lake.  A township owned concrete public access is located in a park along the south shoreline.  A public swimming beach is also located in the park.  The shoal water substrates consist of sand and gravel.  There is no emergent vegetation present in Eagle Lake. <br> \n     Eagle Lake can be ecologically classified as a bass-panfish type of lake and this is reflected in the assemblage of the fish community.  Largemouth Bass, Walleye, and Bluegill are the dominant fish species present in Eagle Lake.   <br> \n     Catch data from recent assessments indicate that a high-density Largemouth Bass population exists.  Age data indicate that reproduction is consistently good.  Bass ranged in length from 7.9 to 17.9 inches with an average length and weight of 12.4 inches and 1.1 pounds.  Bass attain an average length of 13.9 inches at five years of age. <br> \n     Bluegill abundance has historically been high.  Thirty-five percent of the Bluegills were 7.0 inches or greater in length.  Bluegills attain an average length of 7.4 inches at six years of age. <br> \n     The Walleye test-net catch rate was the highest recorded for this lake.  Walleyes ranged in length from 9.3 to 21.7 inches with an average length and weight of 14.8 inches and 1.1 pounds.  Walleyes attain an average length of 15.4 inches at four years of age. <br> \n     Anglers can maintain the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large-size fish while allowing the harvest of the more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with opportunities to catch more large fish in the future. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of the nearshore fish community in Eagle Lake was conducted by Fisheries Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program Staff starting July 18, 2018. Fourteen sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 15-foot or 50-foot seine, where possible, as part of the nearshore survey. Backpack electrofishing was completed at all 14 sites. Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample all 14 sites. Nearshore sampling captured 16 native species of fish including five species that are intolerant of disturbance (Banded Killifish, Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, Mimic Shiner and Rock Bass) and two species that are tolerant of disturbance (Fathead Minnow and Green Sunfish). <br> \n <br> \nData from this targeted summer trap net and nearshore survey is combined with gill net data from a July 2014 standard survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based Index of Biological Integrity (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment. The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. The FIBI score for Eagle Lake from this survey is above an impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes.
