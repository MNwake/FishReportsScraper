                "narrative": "<p>A fish population assessment was conducted on Thunderbird Lake in the summer of 2003.  Species sampled during this assessment were walleye, northern pike, yellow perch, white sucker, pumpkinseed sunfish and common shiner.Walleye were sampled in above average numbers as they were in the two previous assessments in this lake.  The fish averaged just under 1.0 pound (12.8 inches) each and ranged in size from 6.9 inches to 23.5 inches (5.0 pounds).  Approximately 30% of the walleye sampled were between 14 inches and 17.9 inches.  Walleye fingerlings are stocked in a two-of-four year rotation in Thunderbird Lake, and stocked year classes accounted for most of the 2003 catch.Northern pike are typically sampled in low numbers in this lake and the number sampled in this assessment was not much different, being near the low end of the average range.  A few large northern pike (greater than 10 pounds) have been sampled in the past; however, none were taken in this assessment.  The largest northern pike sampled was 8.9 pounds and the remainder of the fish ranged between 3 and 4 pounds.Yellow perch were present in average numbers; however, their size was too small to interest anglers; the largest fish sampled was only 7.2 inches.</p>",

Test nets in 1995 found over 50% of the walleye sampled were in the 14 inch to 16 inch range (1.0 to 1.5 pounds) with fish up to 6.2 pounds observed.     Northern pike are present in low numbers which is common for this lake. Past surveys have sampled some larger northern pike (up to 17 pounds) however the largest sampled in the 1995 survewy was 5.6 pounds. Most angling in Thunderbird Lake is directed at walleye. The lake is fairly remote and requires a minimum of a 0.25 mile portage.</p>",

Northern pike numbers were below average for this lake class.  The largest fish sampled was 29.1 inches. The present walleye population should provide good fishing opportunities for anglers who want to fish off the beaten path.  Yellow perch were present in good numbers and the average size was small with only 8% of the 2008 catch over 8 inches.  The largest yellow perch sampled was 9.1 inches. <br> \n <br> \nPublic access to Thunderbird Lake is difficult.  The trail off of Thunder Road is 0.75 miles across federal and state land.  There is very little parking on Thunder Road.  There is a little used portage trail from the south end of Crooked Lake to Meme Lake, then across Meme Lake to the same trail that comes from Thunder Road.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Thunderbird Lake is characterized as a lake class 13 lake and is located nine miles west and three miles north of Schroeder in the Superior National Forest in the Lake Superior watershed.  Public access is a carry-in on the northeast corner of the lake, from the trailhead off of Thunder Road, then northwest 0.75 miles on the user developed trail across federal and state land.  This trail is suitable for ATV and foot traffic only.  The lake is 96.7 acres, 91% littoral with a maximum depth of 18 feet and a Secchi disc reading of four feet in brown bog stained water.  Rubble and gravel were \"common\" shoreline substrates, with boulder, sand, muck and detritus rated \"rare\".  Vegetation was found to a maximum depth of six feet, 30 species/groups of aquatic vegetation were identified with horsetail rated \"common\" and all others rated \"rare\".  The majority of plants identified were emergent and bog species.  Two inlets enter the lake. Moose Creek originates in Shoepack Lake.  An unnamed Creek is along the northeast shore and originates in Bonanza Lake.  Moose Creek is the outlet and exits the lake along the south shore.  Two designated campsites are on the lake.  One is northeast of the outlet about halfway to the point, has many down trees and looks as though it hasn't been used in quite a long time.  The other is along the northwest shore about 30 yards north of the portage trail to Shoepack Lake and is neat and well used. <br> \n <br> \nThe 2013 Walleye gill net catch of 9/gillnet lift was higher than average for lake class 13.  Average weight was 0.78 pounds which is below average, and was heavily influenced by a strong age-3 year class which comprised 53% of the catch.  The lake is stocked with fingerlings two consecutive years out of four.  The contribution from stocking of this year class is uncertain, since strong non-stocked year classes have been documented in the past.  Three fish in the catch were near 25 inches with the largest 25.3 inches and 6.2 pounds.  Past assessments revealed similar results of high catch with small average size.  The 2013 catch was comprised of 26% from non-stocked years.  In 2008, 66% were from non-stocked years, 2003 contained 21% and 1995 11% from non-stocked years.  In 2013 all Walleyes greater than 12 inches scales and otoliths were sampled, making age data as accurate as possible.  Of twelve year classes identified, seven were from non-stocked years.  Growth of Walleyes in Thunderbird Lake is slower than average compared to other lakes in the Finland Area. <br> \n <br> \nThe Northern Pike catch of 0.5/gillnet lift was below average for the lake class. Average weight was 3.12 pounds which is larger than average.  Historical catch has revealed similar results of very low numbers with large average size.  Growth of Northern Pike in Thunderbird Lake is faster than average by area standards.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch catch of 1.17/gillnet lift was below average, with an average weight of 0.19 pounds which is larger than average for the lake class. Yellow Perch catch rates and sizes have ranged in past assessments. Growth of Yellow Perch in Thunderbird Lake is faster than the Finland Area average. <br> \n <br> \nWhite Sucker catch of 12.17/gillnet lift was above average for the lake class, and the lowest catch recorded in past assessments.  The average weight of 1.37 pounds is slightly smaller than average for the lake class.  <br> \n <br> \nThunderbird Lake is known by local anglers as a decent Walleye lake with a somewhat small average size and some occasional large fish present.  Hammerhandle Northern Pike are not a problem in this lake with a few large fish taken.  The appeal with its main clientele is in its remote location and difficult access, making Thunderbird Lake a BWCA-experience without the need for a permit or restrictive regulations. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Thunderbird Lake is located about seven miles east and 12 miles north of Finland and is 97 acres in size with a maximum depth of 18 feet. Access is a 0.75-mile user made carry-in trail that crosses federal and state land. There is a small parking area available along Thunder Road with enough room for a vehicle or two.   <br> \nWalleye are the primary management species in Thunderbird Lake and the current plan calls for fry to be stocked for two years followed by two non-stocked years.  <br> \n <br> \nThe 2022 gill net catch of 12/lift was higher than average compared to similar lakes. Size structure was good with about a third of the catch greater than 16 inches long and an average size of 13.9 inches long and 1.15 pounds. Age analysis determined less than half the catch came from stocked years suggesting fry stocking may not be necessary. Survey results indicate the 2018 and 2019 naturally reproduced year classes currently provide anglers with good opportunities for Walleye 13-17 inches long.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike are the secondary management species. The gill net catch was 1.8/lift with average length and weight of 27.4 inches and 4.7 pounds, which exceeded management goals. Of the 11 fish sampled only one was less than 20 inches long. The remainder of the catch was greater than 24 inches long, with two fish over 30 inches, and the largest fish sampled in 2022 measuring 35 inches long. Historically the Pike catch on Thunderbird has been low with a very nice average size.  <br> \n <br> \nThe Yellow Perch gill net catch of 6.2/lift is average compared to other similar lakes. Most of the catch was between 6-8 inches long, with 13.5% longer than 9 inches. Thunderbird is not locally known as a big perch destination, however; a keeper or two may be mixed in while Walleye fishing. <br> \n <br> \nOther important forage species sampled were Iowa and Johnny Darters, Blacknose and Common Shiners, Pearl Dace, Pumpkinseed, and White Sucker.</p>",
