Total length ranged from 3.9-11.1.     <br> \n <br> \nTwo black crappies were captured during our investigation.  Both were very large at 11.3 and 12.1 inches.   <br> \n  <br> \nNorthern pike gill-net abundance was 13.5 fish/set.  Nine year-classes were present and age ranged from 1-10 years.  Total length ranged from 9.0-28.1 inches and the average weight was 2.2 pounds.  Growth was below the area average.     <br> \n  <br> \nYellow perch gill-net abundance was 8.3 fish/set.  Five year-classes were present and age ranged from 3-7 years.  Total length in gill nets ranged from 5.4-10.5 inches.  Growth was slightly above the area average.    <br> \n</p>",
