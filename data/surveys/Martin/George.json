IN ADDI- TION, IT APPEARS THAT WALLEYE ABUNDANCE HAS INCREASED SINCE THE 1984 SURVEY. HOWEVER, THE AVERAGE SIZE OF THE WALLEYE APPEARS TO HAVE DECREASED. THE MEAN WEIGHT OF FISH CAUGHT IN 1984 WAS 2.13 LBS. AND THE PSD FOR FISH OVER 19.9 INCHES WAS 33. IN 1989, THE MEAN WEIGHT WAS 0.85 LBS. AND THE PSD FOR FISH OVER 19.9 INCHES WAS 3. THE PRESENT WALLEYE STOCK IS DOMINATED BY AGE TWO FISH POSSIBLY ARISING FROM A FRY STOCKING IN 1987. THERE IS EVIDENCE THAT WALLEYE DID EXHIBIT NATURAL REPRODUCTION IN 1988. WALLEYE GROWTH RATES ARE FAST EARLY IN LIFE BUT THEN DROP BELOW THE STATE AVERAGE BY THE TIME THE FISH ATTAIN EIGHT INCHES IN LENGTH. THE BLUEGILL CPUE OF 32.6 FISH PER TRAP NET FALLS IN THE FOURTH QUARTILE FOR WINDOM AREAS LAKES CONTAINING BLUEGILL. ALTHOUGH IT APPEARS THAT BLUEGILL ARE SLIGHTLY MORE ABUNDANT THAN THEY WERE IN 1984, THEIR AVERAGE SIZE HAS DECREASED. THE MODAL LENGTH OF FISH CAPTURED IN 1984 WAS 6.7 INCHES AND IN 1989 THE MODAL LENGTH OF FISH CAP- TURED IN 1984 WAS 6.7 INCHES AND IN 1989 THE MODAL LENGTH WAS 5.7 INCHES. THE BLUEGILL STOCK IS DOMINATED BY AGE ONE FISH. GROWTH APPEARS TO BE SLOW EARLY IN LIFE BUT THEN EXCEEDS THE STATE AVERAGE ONCE THE FISH ATTAIN A LENGTH OF 1.5 INCHES. ALL BLUEGILL ARE FROM NATURAL REPRODUCTION THE LARGEMOUTH BASS CPUE OF 1.2 FISH PER TRAP NET FALLS IN THE FOURTH QUARTILE AND, IN FACT, IS THE SECOND HIGHEST INDEX EVER RECORDED IN THE WINDOM AREA. SEVERAL DIFFERENT AGES WERE PRESENT IN THE CATCH AND IT APPEARS THAT LARGEMOUTH BASS HAVE SPAWNED SUCCESSFULLY IN EACH YEAR FROM 1984 TO 1988. THERE IS NO INDICATION OF SUCCESSFUL REPRO- DUCTION OCCURRING IN 1989. GEORGE LAKE LARGEMOUTH BASS GROWTH RATES EXCEED THE STATE AVERAGE AT ALL LENGTHS SAMPLED. THE 1989 SURVEY IS THE FIRST TIME IN RECENT HIS- TORY THAT BLACK CRAPPIE ADULTS HAVE BEEN CAPTURED IN GEORGE LAKE. THE STOCK IS COMPRISED ENTIRELY OF AGE ONE FISH BUT REPRODUCTION CHECKS INDICATE THAT BLACK CRAPPIE DID SPAWN SUCCESSFULLY IN 1987. GROWTH RATES EXCEED THE STATE AVERAGE FOR ALL LENGTHS SAMPLED. ALTHOUGH ABUNDANT DURING THE TIME OF THE 1984 SURVEY, NO WHITE CRAPPIE WERE CAPTURED DURING THE 1989 SURVEY. ONLY FOUR NORTHERN PIKE WERE CAPTURED DURING THE SURVEY AND ALL FOUR CAME FROM THE SAME TRAP NET. THE AVERAGE WEIGHT OF THE FOUR PIKE WAS 4.67 LBS. THE YELLOW PERCH CPUE OF 96.5 FISH PER GILL NET FALLS WITHIN THE FOURTH QUARTILE FOR ALL WINDOM AREA LAKES CONTAINING PERCH AND REPRESENTS AN INCREASE IN PERCH ABUNDANCE SINCE THE 1984 SURVEY. AVERAGE WEIGHT OF THE PERCH REMAINS APPROXIMATELY THE SAME, HOWEVER, THE MODAL LENGTH HAS DECREASED FROM 8.2 INCHES IN 1984 TO 6.7 INCHES IN 1989. THE PRESENT YELLOW PERCH STOCK IS DOMINATED BY AGE ONE FISH. ALL YELLOW PERCH CAPTURED DURING THE SURVEY WERE FROM NATURAL REPRODUCTION. GEORGE LAKE ALSO HAS A HIGH NUMBER OF SPECIES. THE CARP CPUE OF 39.0 FISH PER TRAP NET IS THE HIGHEST RECORDED CPUE EVER RECORDED IN THE WINDOM AREA. THE CARP ABUNDANCE IS 22 TIMES THAT RECORDED IN 1984. THE CARP LENGTH DISTRIBUTION RANGED FROM 11.5 TO 30.9 INCHES WITH A MODE OF 14.5 INCHES. BLACK BULLHEAD NUMBERS APPEAR TO HAVE INCREASED SINCE 1984 BUT THE CPUE OF 62.4 FISH PER TRAP NET IS STILL SLIGHTLY LOWER THAN THE LOCAL MEDIAN. BLACK BULLHEAD LENGTHS RANGED FROM 6.0 TO 13.9 INCHES WITH A MODE OF 7.2 INCHES. THE FRESHWATER DRUM CPUE OF 55.5 FISH PER GILL NET FALLS IN THE FOURTH QUARTILE FOR WINDOM AREA LAKES CONTAINING DRUM. THE DRUM SIZE DISTRIBUTION IS BIMODAL WITH PEAKS AT 7.7 INCHES AND 13.5 INCHES.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>George is an 84 acre lake located in Fairmont in Martin County.  The lake is 11 feet deep and has 2.4 miles of shoreline.  George is the lowermost of the Fairmont Chain of Lakes.  George is presently managed for walleye as the primary species while yellow perch, largemouth bass, and black crappie are managed secondarily.The walleye population is down somewhat from previous years but still can provide some fishing action.  Lengths of walleye sampled during our survey ranged from 7 to 22 inches with several around 16 inches.The best fishing opportunities may come from the crappie population in George.  Crappie numbers are high compared to lakes like George.  Many crappie were sampled in the 7.5 to 9 inch range.There are also fishable populations of largemouth bass, bluegill, northern pike, yellow perch, and bullhead.To promote and maintain healthy fish populations, pollution and other inputs need to be controlled.  Fish habitats are directly affected by water quality.  Nutrient, sediment and other waste inputs can drastically alter the biological, chemical, and physical components of a lake.  It is paramount to maintain if not improve the current water quality of George Lake through watershed management to preserve this fishery for future generations to enjoy. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>George is an 84-acre lake located within the city limits of Fairmont in Martin County.  The lake has a maximum depth of 11 feet and is a class 40 lake.  George Lake is just one of the five lakes in Fairmont that make up what is known as the \"Fairmont Chain of Lakes\".  George is managed primarily for walleye while yellow perch, largemouth bass, crappie, and bluegill are managed secondarily.  Low dissolved oxygen readings were recorded on George Lake during the winter of 2008-09.  Oxygen levels dropped from 9.1 ppm in early January to 0.4 ppm in early February.  George is connected to Sisseton Lake and fish can migrate into George so determining the extent of any winterkill is almost impossible. <br> \n <br> \nBased on the 2009 fish survey on George Lake, walleye numbers are typical of what we would see in lakes similar to Budd in water chemistry, depth, and size.  Lengths of walleye caught in our gill nets in 2009 ranged from 10.4 to 22.5 inches and averaged 13.3 inches.  The majority of walleye sampled in our gill nets were one year old.  There is a good number of walleye in the 10 - 12 inch range coming up in the fishery.  These fish were more than likely the result of a walleye fingerling stocking in 2008.  The Fairmont Chain of lakes, including George, are on the list to get additional walleye fingerlings in the fall of 2010.   <br> \n <br> \nDespite the possible winterkill on George, the bluegill population is doing fairly well.  Lengths of bluegill caught in trap nets in 2009 ranged from 4.1 to 9.2 inches and averaged 7.9 inches.  Since bluegill are susceptible to low oxygen, it is likely that many of these fish migrated into George after oxygen levels recovered in the spring <br> \n <br> \nCrappie numbers are also typical of lakes similar to George.  Both black and white crappie are available to anglers in George Lake as well as the entire \"Chain\" of lakes.  Black crappie have 7-8  dorsal spines with dark splotches against a white background on their body.  White crappie have 5-6 dorsal spines and black splotches that form vertical lines on their bodies.  Lengths of black crappie caught in trap nets ranged from 5.8 to 10.3 inches and averaged 9.0 inches.  Lengths of white crappie caught in trap nets ranged from 7.0 to 11.3 inches and averaged 9.4 inches. <br> \n <br> \nResults from the 2009 fish survey indicated George Lake has good numbers of yellow perch available to anglers.  Lengths of yellow perch caught in our gill nets ranged from 6.2 to 9.8 inches and averaged 7.1 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nThe Fairmont Chain of lakes was stocked once with channel catfish since the reclamation in 1967 when 31 adult catfish were stocked in Hall Lake in 1992.  We first started seeing channel catfish in fish surveys on George Lake in 1993 when one fish with a weight of 3.2 lbs was sampled in our nets.  This fish may have been one of the adults stocked in Hall in 1992.  The channel catfish gill net catch rate increased from 1.0 fish/net in 2001 to 7.5 fish/net in 2009.  Lengths of channel catfish caught in gill nets in 2009 ranged from 14.0 to 22.6 inches and averaged 16.5 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nOther fish caught in our nets during the assessment in 2009 included black bullhead, yellow bullhead, common carp, northern pike, golden shiner, white sucker and 1 red pacu (released from an aquarium). <br> \n <br> \nTo maintain a healthy fishery in George Lake, we need to promote Best Management Practices (BMP's) within the watershed to help reduce nutrients entering the lake.  High nutrients and sediments in a lake can cause algae blooms and reduce water clarity. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>George Lake is an 84-acre lake located within the City of Fairmont, and is one of the five lakes collectively known as the \"Fairmont Chain of Lakes\".  George Lake is managed primarily for Walleye and secondarily for Bluegill, Largemouth Bass, Yellow Perch, and crappie. Muskellunge were introduced into the Fairmont Chain of Lakes in the fall of 2016 to provide an apex predator and an additional angling opportunity.  It will take 5-10 years for Muskellunge to become a noticeable member of the fish community.  A survey was conducted the week of August 14, 2017 to monitor fish populations using two gill nets and nine trap nets.  An electrofishing survey was conducted on May 15, 2017 to monitor the Largemouth Bass population.  <br> \n <br> \nThe Walleye catch rate decreased from 4.0 per gill net in 2009 to 0.0 per gill net in 2017.  In trap nets, the 2017 catch rate was 0.9 per trap net, which is within the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (0.3 to 1.3 trap net).  Walleye ranged in length from 11.7 to 24.1 inches and averaged 17.8 inches.  The possibility exists to catch a Walleye at George Lake; however, the low abundance may make it a challenge.  <br> \n <br> \nThe Yellow Perch catch rate in 2017 was 3.5 per gill net, a decrease from the 2009 catch rate of 15.0 per gill net, but within the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (2.5 to 25.8 per gill net).  Lengths of Yellow Perch ranged from 6.7 to 9.2 inches and averaged 7.9 inches.  Yellow Perch abundance is relatively low and it could be the result of competition with Yellow Bass.  <br> \n <br> \nThe 2017 Bluegill catch rate was 6.1 per trap net, which is within the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (2.8 to 43.3 per trap net).  Bluegill lengths ranged from 3.5 to 8.7 inches and averaged 6.5 inches.  A quality Bluegill population with good size structure exists in George Lake.  <br> \n <br> \nSince 1993, Largemouth Bass catch rates have averaged 12.5 per hour.  The 2017 Largemouth Bass catch rate was 38.2 per hour, which is the highest observed catch rate on George Lake.  The previous high catch rate was 5.7 per hour in 2001.  Largemouth Bass lengths ranged from 4.8 to 20.5 inches and averaged 11.5 inches. Bass fishing should be good, with the opportunity to catch a lunker.   <br> \n <br> \nThe Black Crappie catch rate in 2017 was 11.1 per trap net, just below the long term average of 12.9 per trap net, but within the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (1.3 to 27.7 per trap net).  Black Crappie lengths ranged from 5.7 to 12.5 inches and averaged 8.9 inches.  The White Crappie catch rate was 0.7 per trap net, a decrease from 8.3 per trap net in 2009, but within the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (0.3 to 8.2 per trap net).  Lengths of White Crappie ranged from 7.6 to 10.5 inches and averaged 9.2 inches. Black and White Crappie can be distinguished by the number of hard spines on their dorsal fin (back fin).  If the Crappie has 7 or more hard sharp spines it is a Black Crappie and if it has less than 7 it is a White Crappie.  Crappie fishing should be good in the next year or two when more of the population grows to desirable lengths.   <br> \n <br> \nYellow bass are relatively new to the Fairmont Chain of Lakes, with the first confirmed record being in February of 2013 in Hall Lake.  In 2017 in George Lake, Yellow Bass were captured at a rate of 33.0 per gill net with two year classes being sampled.  Lengths of Yellow Bass ranged from 6.8 to 10.7 inches and averaged 7.8 inches.  It appears that Yellow Bass are naturally perpetuating in the Fairmont Chain of Lakes; however, it is unknown what effects they will have on the native fish community.   Although Yellow Bass are native to Minnesota, this species has a tendency to become very abundant in a fish community and outcompete other desirable fish.  However, where Yellow Bass grow to 8 inches or more people are satisfied with fishing for them and they are good to eat.   <br> \n <br> \nThe Channel Catfish catch rate was 5.0 per gill net in 2017, a decrease from 7.5 per gill net in 2009. Lengths of Channel Catfish ranged from 8.4 to 24.0 inches and averaged 19.6 inches.  The Freshwater Drum catch rate decreased slightly from 33.5 per gill net in 2009 to 23.0 per gill net in 2017.  Other species sampled include Black Bullhead, Common Carp, Northern Pike, White Sucker, and Yellow Bullhead.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>George Lake is an 84-acre lake that has a maximum depth of 11.0 ft., and is located within the City of Fairmont in Martin County.  George Lake is the farthest downstream on a chain of five lakes collectively known as the \"Fairmont Chain of Lakes\".  George Lake is managed primarily for Walleye and Muskellunge and secondarily for Bluegill, Crappie, Largemouth Bass and Yellow Perch.  A standard survey was conducted the week of August 16, 2021 to monitor fish populations using gill nets and trap nets.  An electrofishing survey was conducted May 17, 2021 to monitor the Largemouth Bass population.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye catch rates at George Lake have ranged from 0.0 per gill net in 2017 to 20.0 per gill net in 1989, and have averaged 7.8 per gill net since 1984.  In 2021, the Walleye catch rate was 10.5 per gill net, exceeding the long-term average and the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (2.3 to 17.8 per gill net).  Two year classes of Walleye were sampled (age-2 and age-3), with the 2019 year class (age-2) comprising 67 percent of the sample.  Both year classes correspond with stocking events, fingerlings in 2018 and fry in 2019.  Lengths of Walleye ranged from 3.0 to 26.9 inches and averaged 15.7 inches.  Mean Length at age-2 was 14.3 inches, indicating that Walleye grow fast in this system.   <br> \n <br> \nMuskellunge is also a primary management species in George Lake, but no Muskellunge were caught during the standard survey.  Muskellunge are typically sampled in the Spring with large frame trap nets and it is not surprising that we did not sample one during the standard survey time frame.  A targeted Muskellunge survey using large frame trap nets will be conducted in 2024 to assess the Muskellunge population.   <br> \n <br> \nIn five surveys since 1993, the Bluegill catch rate has been less than 7.5 per trap net.  In 2021, the  Bluegill catch rate was 24.0 per trap net, which is above the long term average of 11.9 per trap net and is within the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (2.8 to 43.3 per trap net).  Bluegill lengths ranged from 4.3 to 9.2 inches and averaged 7.6 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie catch rates have ranged from 0.0 per trap net in 1984 to 29.2 per trap net in 2001, averaging 13.1 per trap net since 1984.  In 2021, the Black Crappie catch rate was 14.6 per trap net, which is within the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (1.3 to 27.7 per trap net).  Black Crappie lengths ranged from 5.7 to 11.6 inches and averaged 8.7 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nThe Yellow Perch catch rate in 2021 was 18.5 per gill net, which is within the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (2.5 to 25.8 per gill net), and was an increase from the 2017 catch rate of 3.5 per gill net.  Lengths of Yellow Perch ranged from 5.9 to 10.2 inches and averaged 7.4 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nThe 2021 catch rate of Largemouth Bass was 34.3 per hour, which is a slight decrease from the 2017 catch of 38.2 per hour, but is above the long-term average of 16.9 per hour.  Lengths of Largemouth Bass ranged from 5.4 to 20.5 inches and averaged 13.3 inches.  The wide range of lengths suggests that multiple year classes are present and that the population is able to sustain itself through natural reproduction.   <br> \n <br> \nYellow Bass, which is a native fish to MN and not an invasive species, continues to thrive in the Fairmont Chain of Lakes.  The 2021 catch rate was 293.0 per gill net, a drastic increase from 33.0 per gill net observed in 2017.  Yellow Bass age-1 through age-5 were sampled, suggesting that they are producing a year class annually.  Age-1 Yellow Bass were the most abundant, comprising 83 percent of the sample.  Yellow Bass averaged 6.0, 8.1, and 10.4 inches at age-1, age-2, and age-5, respectively, suggesting that growth is fast at this time.  Although Yellow Bass are native to Minnesota, this species has a tendency to dominate a fish community in terms of abundance and biomass.  It is because of this reason why the general public often has a mistakenly call them an invasive species.  Yellow Bass were likely introduce to the Fairmont Chain through an illegal stocking.  It is illegal to move fish from one lake to another and it can have negative impacts on management activities in other basins.  <br> \n <br> \nThe Channel Catfish catch rate was 3.0 per gill net in 2021, a decrease from 5.0 per gill net in 2017. Lengths of Channel Catfish ranged from 19.3 to 29.3 inches and averaged 22.6 inches.  The Freshwater Drum catch rate decreased slightly from 23.0 per gill net in 2017 to 9.5 per gill net in 2021.  Other species sampled included Bigmouth Buffalo, Black Bullhead, Common Carp, Golden Shiner, Northern Pike, White Sucker, and Yellow Bullhead.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>George Lake is an 84-acre lake in the city of Fairmont.  The lake has been dredged in the past and has a maximum depth of 11 feet.  George is presently a class 40 lake and is managed for walleye as the primary species while yellow perch, largemouth bass, bluegill, and channel catfish are managed secondarily.The walleye population would be considered normal compared to other lakes similar to George.  Lengths of walleye sampled in George ranged from 11 to almost 24 inches and averaged about 15 inches.  The average weight of walleye in George was 1.6 pounds.   The yellow perch population is in good shape according to our survey.  Lengths of yellow perch ranged from 7 to 9.6 inches and averaged just over 8.5 inches.  The average weight of yellow perch was 1/3 of a pound.  The number of yellow perch appears to be down slightly from 1993.  However, there should be plenty of yellow perch to catch.The bluegill population is normal compared to other lakes like George.  Numbers of bluegill are apparently up slightly since 1993.  Lengths of bluegill ranged from 4 to 8 inches and averaged about 6.5 inches.  The average weight of bluegill sampled during our survey was about 1/3 of a pound.The black crappie population looks good in George Lake.  Numbers are up slightly from our 1993 survey data.  Lengths of black crappie ranged from 6 to 9.3 inches with an average length of 8.4 inches.  The average weight of black crappie sampled in 1997 was 0.4 pounds.To promote and maintain a healthy fish population, pollution and other inputs need to be controlled.  Fish habitat is directly affected by water quality.  Nutrient, sediment and other waste inputs can drastically alter the chemical and physical components of a lake.  It is paramount to maintain if not improve the current water quality of George Lake through watershed management to preserve this fishery for future generations to enjoy.   </p>",
