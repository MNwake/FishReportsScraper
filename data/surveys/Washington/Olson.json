Northern pike were sampled in lowerthan average abundance.  Black crappie are present, but weresampled in low numbers.  Good numbers of largemouth bass weresampled by electrofishing.  The catch of two walleye wasunexpected as no walleye have been stocked into this system.  Itis believed the walleye were introduced illegally by a localangler.       Bluegill sampled were of small average size.  Less than 10%of the bluegill measured were large enough for the average anglerto keep.  Hybrid sunfish and pumkinseed sampled were also small. Largemouth bass sampled had good size distribution.  Almost 40%of the bass sampled were protected by the 12\" to 16\" slot limitregulation.  Over 20% of the bass sampled were over 16\".   </p>",

Almost half of the fish were between 12 and 16 inches long, and about one quarter were over 16 inches long.  Bluegill are abundant but small - 3 to 6.8 inches long.  Average length was 5.5 inches and one third were over 6 inches long.  Bluegill growth rate is slow.  Black crappie catch was up considerably from past netting.  Black crappie lengths ranged from 3.7 to 10.6 inches, but most were between 4 and 6 inches, and fewer than 10% were over 9 inches long.  Pumpkinseed and hybrid sunfish are present in moderate numbers, with about one third over 6 inches long.  Northern pike catch was the highest recorded since 1960, but numbers are only moderate compared to similar lakes.  Only two were over 30 inches long.  Northern pike growth rate is good.  Yellow bullhead are present in moderate numbers, with lengths between 5.2 and 13.8 inches and two thirds being over 10 inches long.  Other species captured were: black bullhead (8); brown bullhead (2); yellow perch (18); and walleye (1).</p>",

The bluegill PSD was 22.9% in 1988 and 30.4% in 1989.  The largemouth bass sample showed II-VI year fish, most in the III group.  The bass exhibited average growth.  One IV year old northern pike with average growth rate was caught.  Yellow bullheads, hybrid sunfish, and pumpkinseeds were captured in numbers above local medians for those species.  Catch rates for white sucker, brown bullhead and black crappie were below local median abundance levels.</p>",

Largemouth bass were sampled in good numbers, and were of good average size.  Pumpkinseed and hybrid sunfish were present in fair numbers, with some individuals larger than the bluegills.  Northern pike were sampled in low numbers, with most fish age I and II, and consequently of small size.  Black crappie  were captured in low numbers and were of small size, with few fish over 9 inches.  Bullheads were present in fair numbers, mostly yellow with a few black.  Several were over a pound in weight.  One golden shiner, two white sucker, and two walleye were sampled.</p>",

The average length sampled was 4.78 inches. Pumpkinseed, green and hybrid sunfish were all sampled during the survey. The northern pike population was sampled at the second highest level recorded for this lake. The average size sampled was 21.9 inches and 2.41 pounds. Black crappies numbers are moderate, but the size is small. Largemouth bass were sampled in average abundance. This lake continues to be popular with bass anglers. Two walleye were sampled during the survey despite having not been stocked since 2003 in Olson Lake and 2005 in Demontreville Lake, which is connected. Yellow bullhead and black bullhead were each sampled in Olson Lake. Black bullhead were found in low numbers but yellow bullhead were found in average abundance.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Olson Lake is a hard water lake of 79 acres.  It has a maximum depth of 15 feet and a median depth of 9 feet.A pumphouse which is owned and operated by the Demontreville-Olson Lakes Association is present on the west shore of the lake.  It is used during dry periods to maintain a suitable lake level.A short seasonal inlet from an adjacent swamp is present on the extreme southeast shore and a combination inlet-outlet stream is on the central southeast shore of the lake.  The inlet-outlet stream acts as an outlet during periods when the pump is in use, and as an inlet during wet periods when Demontreville Lakes receives the greater runoff.The shoal water bottom consisted of about 35% sand, 35% mixed sand and gravel, 20% mixed sand, gravel, and rubble, and 10% sandy muck.Submerged aquatic plants were abundant along the entire shoreline, and water lilies and emergent aquatic vegetation were sparse in the lake.A secchi disk reading of 2 feet at the time of the survey indicated that the lake was quite turbid, and oxygen testing indicated that the dissolved oxygen content was sufficient to support fish life throughout the lake at the time.The test net catches indicated that bullheads, sunfish, and crappies are quite abundant in the lake and that the sizes of these fish are quite small.  Northern pike, common suckers, and golden shiners were taken in lower numbers in the test nets.Spawning conditions were considered to be poor for northern pike and walleyes, and good for largemouth bass and panfish, and shoal water seining during the survey indicated that natural reproduction of largemouth bass was good in 1960.Local residents reported that the lake has received very little fishing pressure in past years, and that the lake has paritally winterkilled at various times.The only winterkill on record occurred during the winter of 1955-56.The broad connection between Olson and Demontreville Lakes enables fish to move from lake to lake during the entire open water season.  Olson Lake may restock itself following winterkills by this means from the deeper Demontreville Lake.</p>",

The average length sampled was 4.5 inches. Pumpkinseed, green and hybrid sunfish were all sampled during the survey. The northern pike population was sampled at the highest level recorded for this lake. The average size was 20.8 inches and 1.89 pounds. Black crappie numbers are moderate, but the size is small. Largemouth bass were found in moderate abundance. Individuals exceeding 19 inches were found. A special regulation that requires the immediate release of all largemouth bass is inplace on Olson Lake. Walleye were sampled in average abundance for this type of lake. The average size sampled in the gill nets was 18.97 inches in length. All three species of bullhead native to Minnesota were sampled during the survey. Yellow and brown bullhead were each sampled in high abundance in the gill nets. The average weight for each species was approximately 3/4 of a pound. Yellow perch and white suckers were each found in low abundance.     </p>",

IV annulus fish, followed by III snnulus fish were most common.  Both showed good growth.  Pumpkinseed were represented nearly equally by I, II, and III annulus fish, all of which showed fast growth.  Bluegill were also represented by young fish, I and II annulus being most common.  I annulus fish showed good growth and II annulus fish show fast growth.  Black crappie aged were I to III annulus fish.  All showed good growth.  Black bullhead measured were mostly over 7.0 inches long.  Young of the year and II annulus largemouth bass were taken in seines and trap nets.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Olson Lake is provides angling opportunities primarily for largemouth bass and panfish.  All largemouth bass between 12 and 16 inches must be immediatelt released. Largemouth bass are abundant - spring electrofishing catch rate was the second highest since 1986.  Lengths ranged from 8.5 to 19 inches with a 13.5 inch average.  Two thirds of the sample was over 12 inches and one fifth over 16 inches.  Blugills are abundant but small.  Average length was 4.5 inches with only 2% over 6 inches.  Pumkinseed and hybrid sunfish are also common but small - average length of 5 inches for both species.  Black crappie are present in moderate numbers but small.  Average length was 6.5 inches and only 20% over 8 inches.  Northern pike are present in low numbers.  Lengths ranged from 17 to 27 inches with 75% over 20 inches, 25% over 25 inches, but none over 30 inches.  Yellow perch are also present in low numbers with most fish between 5 and 7 inches.  One 24 inch walleye was captured.  Walleye are not stocked but have been occasionally sampled in the past.  Yellow bullhead are moderately abundant and large.  Average length was 10.5 inches and 25% were over 12 inches.  Other species sampled in low numbers were green sunfish, golden shiner, and white sucker.  Neascus (black spot) is common in sunfish and prevalent in northern pike.</p>",

The bluegills fell mostly in the 5.5\" group and growth was slower than the statewide average.  An extremely large number of bluegill YY were captured seining.  Black bullhead, yellow bullhead, black crappie, and yellow perch were below the median numbers and hybrid sunfish, green sunfish, and pumpkinseed were above.NOTE:  See special regulation assessment length frequency distribution charts for bluegills and largemouth bass.</p>",

The size structure is still small, with the average length being 4.6 inches. Pumpkinseed sunfish are also abundant. They are also small, averaging only 5.0 inches. Although, some fish up to 7.5 inches were sampled. Northern pike are currently at one of their highest population levels recorded for this lake, with nearly 28% exceeding 25 inches. Black crappie numbers are moderate, but the size is small. Only one crappie over 10 inches was sampled. Largemouth bass were found in average abundance. Three species of bullhead were sampled in Olson Lake, black, brown, and yellow. Each was caught in average abundance. Two walleyes were sampled during this survey. This species was not stocked prior to 2001, but was occasionally sampled. In 2001 the Mn DNR began stocking Olson lake with walleye. It will be stocked every other odd numbered year with walleye fry. Periodic assessments may be done to determine whether fingerlings should be stocked in place of the fry. Yellow perch, white suckers, hybrid sunfish, and green sunfish were also sampled.         </p>",
