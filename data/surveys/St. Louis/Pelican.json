                "narrative": "<p>Pelican is a 10,945 acre, class 7 lake located west of Highway 53 at Orr, MN.  The maximum depth is 38 feet, but large areas of very shallow water with abundant aquatic vegetation are present.  Bass, panfish, northern pike, and yellow perch dominate the sport-fish community.  Special regulations protecting northern pike (24 to 38 inches) and largemouth and smallmouth bass (14 to 20 inches) were enacted in the spring of 1998 to address concerns about declining size of pike and to protect the high quality bass population.  The northern pike regulation was modified in 2001; fish from 24 to 32 inches are currently protected.  Most species have increased in abundance since the previous investigation in 1998; however, black and brown bullheads continued to decline, a trend that has continued for over a decade.      Black crappie trap-net abundance of 6.00 fish/set exceeded the average for most lakes in Minnesota and has increased from the two previous investigations.  Length in trap nets ranged from 4.2 to 11.3 inches and the average was 6.8.  Many strong year-classes were present, which should provide good fishing for several years.  Growth rate was much lower than other lakes in the area.     Bluegill trap-net abundance of 2.96 was similar to other lakes of this type and has increased since the previous investigation.  Average length in trap nets was 5.1 inches with a range from 3.2 to 7.0.  The proportion of large bluegills captured in trap nets has dramatically declined from the three previous investigations.  Eighty-seven percent of the fish in trap nets were from the 1997 or 1998 year-classes.  Growth rate was similar to other lakes in the area.      Forty-five largemouth bass were captured in trap nets set from April 26 to May 4, 2001.  Catch rate was 0.47 fish/set.  Eight year-classes were sampled and age ranged from 8 to 15 years.  Length ranged from 5.7 to 20.4 inches and the average was 16.4.     Night electrofishing was used to sample a total of 365 largemouth and smallmouth bass on May 29-30, 2001.  Largemouth bass were captured at a rate of 52.8 per hour of on-time, which was the highest ever recorded on Pelican Lake.  Eight year-classes were sampled and age ranged from 2 to12 years.  The 1998 year-class represented 45% of the sample.  Length ranged from 3.7 to 19.8 inches and the average was 10.4, which was similar to 2000 (10.8 in).  Growth similar to the area lakes.     Smallmouth bass were captured at a rate of 43.6 per hour of on-time, which was near the record high of 48.3 in 1998.  Eleven year-classes were sampled and age ranged from 1 to 11 years.  Length ranged from 3.3 to 18.9 inches and the average was 10.5.  Growth was similar to the area average.           Abundance of northern pike in 2001 was similar to the average from 1959-1998 and well above most lakes of this type.  In the short term, northern pike gill-net abundance has increased from 6.25 in 1998 to 9.92 in 2001.  Although abundance has increased from the last investigation, mean TL and weight remained the same.  Growth is below the area average.  Total length in 2001 ranged from 10.5 to 34.9 inches and the average was 20.3, an increase from the 1995 average of 18.3.  In an attempt to increase sampling of northern pike, ice-out trap netting was also done from April 26 to May 4, 2001.  A total of 996 northern pike were captured at a rate of 10.48 fish/set.  Length ranged from 7.7 to 36.9 inches and the average was 20.6, up from 18.9 in 1998.      Walleye gill-net abundance of 1.08 was well below most lakes of this type.  Mean length was 22.1 inches with a range from 18.5 to 28.0.  Growth and mean weight was considerably higher than the area average.       Yellow perch gill-net abundance has increased with each of the past three investigations and was 26.58 in 2001, over six times greater than the average for this lake type.  Mean length in gill nets was 7.0 inches with a range from 5.2 to 11.4.  Growth was similar to the area average.  Eleven year-classes were present and over 33% of the sample was from the 1998 year-class.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>     Pelican is a 10,945 acre, class 7 lake located west of Highway 53 at Orr, MN.  Slightly over <br> \nhalf of the lake is less than 15 feet deep.  Bass, northern pike, and panfish dominate the sport-fish community.   <br> \n     Special regulations protecting northern pike (24 to 38 inches) and largemouth and smallmouth bass (14 to 20 inches) were enacted in the spring of 1998 for a period of 10 years.  The regulations were implemented to address concerns about declining northern pike quality and to protect the high quality bass fishery that was present.  The northern pike regulation was modified in 2001; fish from 24 to 32 inches were protected.   <br> \n     Most species have increased in abundance during the last 10 years; however, black and brown bullhead abundances continued to decline, a trend that has continued for over a decade.  Generally, size structure and growth for all species has been maintained or improved during the last decade.   <br> \n     Black crappie trap-net abundance of 8.05 fish/set was the second highest level ever observed in Pelican Lake and greatly exceeded what is observed in the majority of class 7 lakes.  Size in trap nets ranged from 3.9 to 12.4 inches and the mean was 6.8.  Several strong year-classes were present and age ranged from 1 to 9.  Growth was much lower than the area mean, which has been case in previous investigations. <br> \n     Bluegill trap-net abundance of 7.91 fish/set was the highest level observed since 1992 and more than twice as high as the level observed in most class 7 lakes.  Average size in trap nets was 6.3 inches with a range from 3.2 to 8.9.  Over half of the bluegill captured in trap nets were from the 2002 year-class.  Growth was slightly below the area average.  <br> \n     Night electrofishing was used to sample a total of 463 largemouth and smallmouth bass on May 29-30, 2007.  Largemouth bass were captured at a rate of 54.0 per hour of on-time, which was the highest ever recorded on Pelican Lake.  Total length ranged from 3.7 to 19.3 inches and the mean was 10.9, which was similar to other recent investigations.  However, the trend for mean weight continued to increase; 0.79 lb in 2001 to 1.08 lb in 2007.  Age and growth data was collected in 2006 and was similar to the area mean.   <br> \n    Smallmouth bass were captured at a rate of 64.4 per hour of on-time, which was well above the previous high 48.3 in 1998.  Total length ranged from 2.5 to 20.2 inches and the mean was 8.7.  Mean weight was 0.71 lb., an increase from 2006 (0.51 lb).  Age and growth data was collected in 2006 and was similar to the area mean.    <br> \n     Abundance of northern pike in 2007 was 22.2 fish/set, which was more than twice the mean of 10.0 fish/set from 1959-2001 and well above most class 7 lakes.  Size has also greatly increased since the experimental regulations were enacted in 1998.  Total length in 2007 ranged from 10.2 to 32.2 inches and the mean was 21.7, compared to a mean of 18.3 in 1995.  Although abundance and size have increased, growth has not suffered as a consequence.  Growth was much greater in 2007 than in 1995.     <br> \n     Walleye gill-net abundance of 2.13 was well below most class 7 lakes, but twice as high as the investigation in 2001 (1.08 fish/set).  Average length was 19.8 inches with a range from 11.6 to 27.7.  Nine year-classes were present, which was the most year-classes ever observed.  The mean number of year-classes observed in Pelican Lake from 1989-2001 was 5.  In 2007, age ranged from 2-21 years.  Growth was slightly higher than the area mean.  Mean weight was well above what is seen in most class 7 lakes.  <br> \n     Yellow perch gill-net abundance was 44.33 fish/set, the highest level observed since 1959.  Mean length in gill nets was 6.7 inches with a range from 5.0 to 11.8.  Growth was similar to the area mean.  Nine year-classes were present and age ranged from 2-10 years.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Pelican Lake is located west of Highway 53 at Orr, MN.  The lake is 10,945 acres and slightly over half (54%) is less than 15 feet deep.  Centrarchids, northern pike, and yellow perch dominate the sport-fish community.   <br> \n <br> \nSpecial regulations protecting northern pike (24 to 38 inches) and largemouth and smallmouth bass (14 to 20 inches) were enacted in the spring of 1998 for a period of 10 years.  The regulations were implemented to address concerns about declining northern pike quality and to protect the high quality bass fishery that was present.  The northern pike regulation was modified in 2001; fish from 24 to 32 inches were protected.  In 2008, the regulations were reviewed and the decision was to continue for an additional 10-year trial period.  The bass regulation remained the same and the northern pike regulation was modified to match similar lakes in Minnesota (24 to 36 inches protected).  <br> \n <br> \nMost species have increased in abundance during the last 15 years; however, black and brown bullhead abundances continued to decline, a trend that has continued for over a decade.  Generally, size structure and growth for all species has been maintained or improved during the last decade.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie abundance greatly exceeded the level for this lake type and was the highest level ever observed in Pelican Lake.  Length in trap nets ranged from 3.9 to 12.6 inches and the mean was 6.2.  Sixty-six percent of the sample were from the 2010 year-class, which could provide great fishing and reproduction in the near future.   <br> \n <br> \nBluegill abundance decreased from the previous investigation, but not outside the normal range for Pelican Lake.  The mean length of fish captured in trap nets was 5.6 inches with a range from 3.8 to 7.5.  Nearly half (46 percent) of the bluegill captured in trap nets were from the 2010 year-class.   <br> \n <br> \nAbundance of northern pike in 2012 was essentially equal to the mean from 1959-2001 and well above the normal range for this lake type. Size has increased since the experimental regulations were enacted in 1998; the mean was 21.5 inches in 2012, compared to a mean of 18.3 in 1995.    Growth has also improved compared to surveys done prior to the regualtion changes.   <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance was the highest level ever observed in Pelican Lake.  Mean length was 17.5 inches with a range from 11.2 to 27.0.  Eleven year-classes were present, which was the most year-classes ever observed.  In 2012, age ranged from 2-18 years and age-2 fish represented 41 percent of sample.  Mean weight was well above the normal range observed in similar lakes.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch gill-net abundance decreased from the previous investigation in 2007 (highest level observed since 1959), but remained well above the normal range for this lake type.  Mean length was 6.7 inches with a range from 5.1 to 11.0.  Growth was slightly less than the area mean.  Ten year-classes were present and age ranged from 2-11 years. <br> \n <br> \nOriginally, the population assessment for Pelican Lake was planned for 2011.  However, due to the Minnesota State Government shutdown that occurred July 1-20, 2011; the population assessment had to be postponed until 2012.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>PELICAN LAKE HAS A DIVERSE COMMUNITY OF FISH SPECIES. FISH SPECIES PRESENT IN THE 1986 ASSESS- MENT WERE NORTHERN PIKE, GOLDEN SHINER, WHITE SUCKER, BLACK BULLHEAD, BROWN BULLHEAD, ROCK BASS, PUMPKINSEED SUNFISH, BLUEGILL SUNFISH, LARGEMOUTH BASS, BLACK CRAPPIE, YELLOW PERCH, WALLEYE, SPOT- TAIL SINER, SHINERS, BLUNTNOSE MINNOWS AND CENTRAL MUDMINNOW. THESE SPECIES HAVE BEEN PRESENT IN PAST ASSESSMENT WITH EXCEPTION OF BLACK BULLHEAD WHICH BELIEVED TO BE A RECENT INTRODUCTION. NUMBERS OF BLACK BULLHEADS WERE 0 IN 1980 AND 1,433 IN THE 1986 ASSESSMENT. YELLOW PERCH ABUNDANCE HAS DE- CLINED AT ABOUT THE SAME TIME AS BLACK BULLHEAD HAVE INCREASED. CATCH PER GILL NET OF YELLOW PERCH WAS 27.8 IN 1977, 9.08 IN 1980 AND 5.5 IN 1986. THE AVG WEIGHT OF A SINGLE PERCH HAS REMAINED STEADY. THE POPULATION STRUCTURE APPEARS TO BE SIMILAR TO WHEN THEY WERE MORE ABUNDNAT. BR. BULL- HEAD ABUNDANCE HAS REMAINED RELATIVELY STEADY WITH POPULATGION STRUCTURE SIMILAR TO THAT OF PAST YEARS. BLUEGILL SUNFISH ABUNDANCE IN TRAPNETS INCREASED SINCE THE 1980 ASSESSMENTS. LARGER NUM- BERS OF SMALLER FISH AND SMALLER NUMBERS OF LARGER FISH WERE PRESENT IN 1986. GROWTH RATES OF BLUE- GILLS HAVE DECLINED SINCE 1980. IN 1980 GROWTH OF BLUEGILLS WAW SLIGHLY BETTER THAN STATE AVG. IN 1986 GROWTH RATES WERE 15-20% LOWER THAN THE STATE AVG AND 20-25% SLOWER THAN THEIR 1980 GROWTH RATES NORTHERN PIKE ABUNDANCE HAS REMAINED FAIRLY STEADY AND GROWTH RATES HAVE DECLINED 10-20% FROM THE 1971 DATA, WHICH PUTS THEM 5-15% BELOW THE STATE AVG. WALLEYE NUMERS HAVE BEEN LOW IN PAST ASSESS- MENTS AND ARE STILL LOW IN 1986. HOWEVER AN INCREASE IN CATCH PER NET FROM .67 TO 2.25 OCCURED FROM 1977 TO 1980. A DECLINE TO 1.27 FISH PER NET OCCURED IN 1986 WHICH REFLECTS THE LACK RECRUIT- MENT SINCE 1980. CALCULATING GROWTH RATES FOR WALLEYE WAS DIFFICULT BECAUSE OF LOW NUMBERS, HOW- EVER IT APPEARS THAT WALLEYES ARE GROWING GOOD WITH GROWTH RATES ABOUT 15% GREATER THAN THE STATE AVG. BLACK CRAPPIES ABUNDANCE APPEARS TO FLUCTUATE AND STRONG YEAR CLASSES INFLUENCE THE CATCH. THE 1986 CATCH PER GILL NET WAS DOWN FROM THE 1971 AND 71 ASSESSMENTS AND UP SLIGHTLY FROM THE 1980 AND 1974 ASSESSMENTS. GROWTH OF CRAPPIES HAS CHANGED LESS THAN THAT OF OTHER SPECIES GROWTH RATES FROM 1971, 74,77,80 AND 1986 ARE ALL SLIGHTLY BELOW THE STATE AVG AND APPEAR TO BE DECREASING SLIGHTLY. THIS CHANGE MAY NOT BE SIGNI- FICANT. NO SMALLMOUTH BASS WERE CAUGHT IN THE 86 TRAP OR GILL NETS HOWEVER ONE YOUNG OF THE YEAR WAS CAUGHT IN A SEINE HAUL. A SUMMARY OF THE PROBABLY RECENT HISTORY OF FISH STOCKS IN PELICAN FOLLOWS. THE INCREASE IN ABUNDANCE OF WALLEYE FROM 1977 TO 1980 ALONG WITH THE ABUNDANT NORTHERN PIKE POPULATION HAS CAUSED THE YELLOW PERCH POPULATION TO DECREASE. BLUEGILL SUNFISH FILLED THE VOID BY INCREASING THEIR ABUNDANCE CAUSING A DECREASE IN THEIR GROWTH RATE. BLACK BULLHEADS WERE INTRODUCED (UNKNOWN SOURCE) AS YELLOW PERCH ABUNDANCE WAS DECLINING. BLACK BULLHEADS ARE NOW THE LARGEST PERCENTAGE OF BIOMASS IN THE LAKE.</p>",

Bass, panfish, northern pike, and yellow perch dominate the sport-fish community. <br> \n <br> \nSpecial regulations protecting northern pike (24 to 38 inches) and largemouth and smallmouth bass (14 to 20 inches) were enacted in the spring of 1998 for a period of 10 years.  The regulations were implemented to address concerns about declining northern pike quality and to protect the high quality bass fishery that was present.  The northern pike regulation was modified in 2001; fish from 24 to 32 inches were protected.  In 2008, the regulations were reviewed and the decision was to continue for an additional 10-year trial period.  The bass regulation remained the same and the northern pike regulation was modified to match similar lakes in Minnesota (24 to 36 inches protected). <br> \n <br> \nMost species have increased in abundance during the last 20 years.  Generally, size and growth for all species has been maintained or improved during this time.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie trap-net abundance greatly exceeded the normal range for this lake type and was the third highest level ever observed in Pelican Lake. Length in trap nets ranged from 3.5 to 11.8 inches and the mean was 7.4. Many year-classes were represented and age ranged from 2 to 11. Several strong year-classes were present which should provide good fishing and consistent spawning for years.   <br> \n <br> \nBluegill trap-net abundance was within the normal range for Pelican Lake.  Length in trap nets ranged from 3.4 to 8.7 inches. Six year-classes were represented and age ranged from 2 to 8.  The strongest year-classes were in 2011, 2012, and 2014; which should provide good fishing and consistent spawning for years.  <br> \n <br> \nNight electrofishing was used to sample largemouth and smallmouth bass on June 1 and 2, 2016.  A total of 118 bass were captured. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass were captured at a rate of 21.32 per hour of on-time, which was similar to the level observed during the previous investigation.  The highest level ever recorded was 54.0 fish per hour of on-time, which occurred in the 2007 investigation.  In 2016, length ranged from 5.8 to 18.9 inches and the mean was 13.4.  The mean length in 2016 was similar to 2011 (14.2 inches) but much greater than the three sampling events before 2011 (10.9 inches in 2007, 10.1 inches in 2006, and 10.4 inches in 2001).   <br> \n <br> \nSmallmouth bass were captured at a rate of 26.15 per hour of on-time, which was a dramatic decline from the record catch of 64.4 per hour of on-time observed in the 2007 survey and the lowest level observed since 2001.  Length ranged from 4.1-19.5 inches.  The mean lenth was 13.0 inches, which was greater than the four most recent sampling events (10.6 inches in 2011, 8.7 inches in 2007, 7.7 inches in 2006, and 10.5 inches in 2001).    <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike gill-net abundance was 11.9 fish/set, which was above the mean of 10.0 fish/set from 1959-2001 and well above the expected range for this lake type.  In 2016, length ranged from 11.7 to 28.6 inches; 24.5 percent of northern pike were equal to or greater than 24.0 inches.  Size has increased since the experimental regulations were enacted in 1998; the mean was 21.6 inches in 2016, compared to a mean of 18.3 in 1995.  Growth appears to not have suffered, the rate was the similar in 2016 and 1995. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance was low for this lake type, which was consistent with what has been observed historically in Pelican Lake.  However, although low, abundance in 2016 was the third highest level ever observed in Pelican Lake. The highest level was recorded in the previous investigation (2012).  In 2016, mean length in the sample was 15.8 inches with a range from 7.9 to 27.8.  Mean weight was 1.93 pounds, which was above the expected range for this lake type.  Five year-classes were present and age ranged from 1-22 years. Age-2 fish represented 50 percent of sample and age-6 fish represented 31 percent.  Growth rate was higher than the average observed in other area lakes. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch abundance was over six times greater than the expected range for this lake type.  Fortunately, sizes are present that are attractive to anglers.  The size range included fish up to 12.2 inches. </p>",

Protective size regulations for bass and northern pike were implemented in 1998 and will be evaluated in 2007.   <br> \n <br> \nNight electrofishing was used to sample largemouth and smallmouth bass on June 1 and 6, 2006.  A total of 313 bass were captured.   <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass were captured at a rate of 31.2 per hour of on-time, which was the second highest rate ever recorded for Pelican Lake.  Nine year-classes were sampled and age ranged from 1-9 years.  Length ranged from 2.6 to 20.3 inches and the mean was 10.1.  The mean weight was 0.99 lb, an increase from 0.79 lb in 2001.  Growth was similar to previous sampling events and the area mean. <br> \n <br> \nSmallmouth bass were captured at a rate of 48.2 per hour of on-time, which was essentially the same as the record high of 48.3 in 1998.  Thirteen year-classes were sampled and age ranged from 1-13 years.  The 2001-2003 year-classes represented 60% of the sample.  Length ranged from 2.2-18.7 inches and the mean was 7.7 inches.  Mean weight decreased from 0.89 lb in 2001 to 0.51 lb in 2006.  Growth was slightly better than the area mean.       <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

The sport fish community is dominated by bass, panfish, and northern pike.  Protective size regulations for bass and northern pike were implemented in 1998.   <br> \n <br> \nNight electrofishing was used to sample largemouth and smallmouth bass on June 8-10, 2011.  A total of 176 bass were captured.   <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass were captured at a rate of 18.77 per hour of on-time, which was well below levels observed during investigations conducted in the previous 10 years.  The highest level ever recorded was 54.0 fish per hour of on-time, which occurred in 2007.  In 2011, 13 year-classes were sampled and age ranged from 2-14 years.  The 2004 year-class represented 26% of the sample.  Total length (TL) ranged from 4.4 to 18.3 inches and the mean was 14.2.  The mean TL in 2011 was greater than the three most recent sampling events (10.9 inches in 2007, 10.1 inches in 2006, and 10.4 inches in 2001.   <br> \n <br> \nSmallmouth bass were captured at a rate of 31.3 per hour of on-time, which was a dramatic decline from the record catch of 64.4 per hour of on-time observed in 2007 and the lowest level observed since 2001.  In 2011, 13 year-classes were sampled and age ranged from 2-16 years.  The 2006 year-class represented 23% of the sample.  Total length ranged from 4.4-18.9 inches.  The mean TL was 10.6 inches, which was greater than the three most recent sampling events (8.7 inches in 2007, 7.7 inches in 2006, and 10.5 inches in 2001).  </p>",

Special regulations were implemented for Pelican Lake in 1998 which designated a protected slot for Northern Pike and Black Bass (Smallmouth and Largemouth). Several revisions of the special regulations and numerous surveys have been completed since that time to aid in the review of the protected slots. A special assessment targeting Northern Pike in the spring of 2016 was completed to add to the information used to evaluate the effect of these regulations on the Northern Pike population in Pelican Lake.   <br> \n <br> \nA total of 59 trap net sets were completed at 25 sites in Pelican Lake from April 19 to April 25, 2016. A sample of 142 Northern Pike were measured, weighed, and inspected for sex before being released. The average weight was 1.75 pounds, and the average length was 19.6 inches. The largest Northern Pike sampled was 33.4 inches, and only 15 (10.6%) were greater than 24 inches in length. Of the 141 fish that were examined for sex, 59 were female (41.8%), 37 were male (26.2%), and 45 were unknown (31.9%). </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Sampling with DNR test nets showed high abundance of northern pike in Pelican Lake.  Northern pike up to 34.8\" long were sampled, with an average length of 18.3\", and an average weight of 1.6 pounds.  While the average size of northern pike was small, the number of fish over 28\" in length has increased, showing improved prospects for trophy sized fish.  Growth of northern pike was slow, and many fish were underweight for their length.  This suggests that abundance of northern pike may be too high for the available food supply.     Bluegill abundance has declined to levels similar to 1980 and prior years on Pelican Lake, but remained within the range reported for lakes of this type.  Bluegill up to 9.7\" long were sampled, with an average length of 6.8\", and an average weight of 0.2 pounds.  The size structure of the population continued to improve, with greater numbers of fish over 8\" in length.  Growth rates improved, but remained below the levels observed in 1986 and prior years.  The age structure of the population showed that little or no recruitment resulted from natural reproduction in 1992 and 1993.     Sampling efforts for largemouth bass and smallmouth bass were increased during this investigation by using night electrofishing.  Catch rates were similar for the two species, which suggests similar abundance.  Largemouth bass up to 19.8\" long were sampled, with an average length of 13.4\", and an average weight of 1.8 pounds.  The size structure of the largemouth bass population showed high numbers of quality sized fish.  Largemouth bass recruitment from natural reproduction was limited in 1992 and 1993.  Smallmouth bass were smaller, with an average length of 7.7\", and an average weight of 0.3 pounds.     Black crappie abundance was above average for lakes of this type, with an average length of 8.3\", and an average weight of 0.3 pounds.  The proportion of quality sized fish in the population has increased since 1992.  As noted for bluegill and largemouth bass, natural reproduction of black crappie was limited in 1992 and 1993.     Yellow perch abundance increased to levels not seen on Pelican Lake since 1977.  Black bullhead abundance declined to a record low, since first reported in 1986.  Brown bullhead abundance was similar to historical levels for Pelican Lake.  Walleye abundance remained low, but the average weight of those sampled was 3.1 pounds.</p>",

The average length, 20.2 inches, increased slightly from the 1995 investigation average of 18.3 inches.  No pike larger than the protected slot limit were sampled in this summer netting.  Growth rate also increased slightly from the 1995 investigation, although was still below the state average.     Bluegill numbers declined to levels similar to the 1970s sampling and were approaching the lower end of the range typically observed.  Average length was 6.6 inches with most of the sampled fish either three or four years old.  Growth rate was near the statewide average.     Both largemouth and smallmouth bass numbers from the spring night sampling increased.  The average largemouth length was 11.1 inches primarily due to large numbers of immature fish.  Several fish were near the upper limit of the protected slot.  Average length of smallmouth increased slightly to 8.0 inches with many fish over 12 inches present.  Growth remained good for both species.     Black crappie numbers also increased and now exceed the level expected for lakes like Pelican.  Average size decreased to 7.2 inches with some of this decline from a large 1997 year class.  Many crappies were over 10 inches in the 1998 investigation.     Yellow perch abundance was high and fish over 12 inches were present.  Black and brown bullhead numbers continue to decline in Pelican Lake.     Walleye abundance was near the historic high, although still below the range typically observed in lakes of this type.  There was good natural reproduction of walleyes in 1994.  Average length was 18.6 inches with an occasional fish over 24 inches.</p>",

Protective experimental size regulations for northern pike and black bass were implemented in 1998.   <br> \n     Trap nets were used to sample northern pike from April 12 to April 20, 2006.  Temperature ranged from 45 to 52 degrees fahrenheit during the sampling period.  Fifty-eight set-days were used to capture 435 northern pike.   <br> \n     Northern pike were captured at a rate of 7.5 fish/set.  Total length ranged from 8.5 to 33.2 inches and the mean was 22.1.  Only 2 of the 435 fish captured were immature.  The majority of fish were female (75%).     <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Pelican is a 11,546-acre, class 7 lake located west of Highway 53 at Orr, MN. Slightly over half (54%) of the lake is littoral area. Centrarchids, Northern Pike, and Yellow Perch dominate the sport-fish community. <br> \n <br> \nSpecial regulations protecting Northern Pike (24 to 38 inches) and Largemouth and Smallmouth Bass (14 to 20 inches) were enacted in the spring of 1998 for a period of 10 years. The regulations were implemented to address concerns about declining Northern Pike quality and to protect the high-quality bass fishery that was present. The Northern Pike regulation was modified in 2001; fish from 24 to 32 inches were protected. In 2008, the regulations were reviewed, and the decision was to continue for an additional 10-year trial period. The bass regulation remained the same and the Northern Pike regulation was modified to match similar lakes in Minnesota (24 to 36 inches protected). Currently, Northern Pike on Pelican are managed under the north-central zone state regulation. The statewide Northern Pike regulation for the north-central zone allows anglers harvest 10 Northern Pike with not more than 2 over 26 inches and all Northern Pike between 22-26 inches must be immediately released. The bass regulation remains the same at all 14\" - 20\" fish must be immediately released. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie catch rate was 3.2 fish per net, which was above the average for similar lakes. Catch rate was above the management goal of 2.6 fish per net for Pelican Lake. Length ranged from 4.1 to 10.6 inches and the average was 6.4 inches. Average weight was 0.2 pounds, which is less than the average for similar lakes. A total of seven year-classes were present, and ages ranged from 2-10 years. There are quite a few Black Crappie under 6\", with a decent number between 7\" - 11\". Very few fish over 11\" were present. Even though the average weight was less than average for similar lakes there are still good quality Black Crappie in Pelican Lake. There are good numbers of Black Crappie providing good fishing opportunities. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill catch rate of 2.3 fish per net, which is less than average for similar lakes. Catch rate was below the management goal of 3.2 fish per net for Pelican Lake. Length ranged from 3.3 to 7.3 inches and the average were 4.7 inches. Mean weight was 0.1 pounds, which is less than average for similar lakes. A total of seven year-classes were present, and ages ranged from 2-12 years. There are quite a few Bluegill under 6\", with a decent number between 6\" - 8\". Very few fish over 8\" were present. Even though Bluegill numbers and the average weight was less than average for similar lakes there are still good quality Bluegill in Pelican Lake. <br> \n <br> \nNight electrofishing was used to sample Largemouth and Smallmouth Bass on June 7 and 8, 2022. A total of 205 bass were captured. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass catch rate was 42.9 fish per hour of On-Time, which is greater than the Pelican Lake historic average of 28.6 fish per hour of On-Time. Length ranged from 4.3 to 18.5 inches and the average was 13.3 inches, which was similar to the 2011 and 2016 surveys in Pelican Lake. Largemouth Bass length was above the management goal of total length greater than 14 inches for Pelican Lake. Average weight was 1.6 pounds. A total of 14 year-classes were present, and ages ranged from 2-22 years. The Largemouth Bass population looks very healthy with good numbers of bass under 14\". Also, there are good numbers of Largemouth Bass present between 14\" and 20\" providing a good quality bass fishing opportunity.  <br> \n <br> \nSmallmouth Bass catch rate was 19.4 fish per hour of On-Time, which was less than the Pelican Lake historic average of 36.0 fish per hour of On-Time. Length ranged from 4.1 to 17.9 inches and the mean was 11.8 inches, which was less than the 2016 survey (13.0 in.), but greater than the 2011 (10.6 in.), 2007 (8.7 in.), 2006 (7.7 in.), and 2001 (10.5 in.) surveys in Pelican Lake. Smallmouth Bass length was above the management goal of total length grater than 14 inches for Pelican Lake. Average weight was 1.2 pounds. A total of 12 year-classes were present, and ages ranged from 2-17 years. The Smallmouth Bass population looks very healthy with good numbers of bass under 14\". Also, there are good numbers of Smallmouth Bass present between 14\" and 20\" providing a good quality bass fishing opportunity. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike catch rate was 15.4 fish per net, which was well above the average for similar lakes. Catch rate was above the management goal of 11.1 fish per net for Pelican Lake. Length ranged from 9.2 to 28.9 inches, with an average of 20.2 inches. Northern Pike length was below the management goal of an mean length greater than 21 inches for Pelican Lake. Mean weight was 1.8 pounds, which was less than the expected range for this lake type. A total of seven year-classes were present, and ages ranged from 1-7 years. There are quite a few Northern Pike under 22\" inches and in the 22\"-26\" slot in Pelican Lake, with a few above 26\" inches. Some Northern Pike sampled were a bit skinny for their length. There are good numbers of Northern Pike providing good fishing opportunities. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye catch rate was 6.8 fish per net the highest it has ever been on Pelican Lake. Catch rate was well above the management goal of 3.0 fish per net. for Pelican Lake. Average length in the sample was 17.1 inches with a range from 12.0 to 26.3. Average weight was 1.9 pounds, which was well above the average range for similar lakes. A total of 10 year-classes were present, and ages ranged from 1-13 years.
