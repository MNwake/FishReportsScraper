                "narrative": "<p>A resurvey was conducted at Hanska in 2006 to monitor the lake's physical, chemical and biological charecteristics.  The lake's watershed was dominated by row crop agriculture.  Much of the shoreline was undevelped and had a thin fringe of trees before the crop fields began.  Submergent vegetation was rare in late summer, but emergent cattails were ranked as common.  Patches of curlyleaf pondweed may be more abundant in May and June.  Silt and sand were classified as common shoalwater substrates.  Aeration systems (2) are operated on each end of the lake with hopes of reducing the frequency and severity of winterkill.  Mild winters in recent years have also reduced the likelyhood of winterkill.  The latest partial winterkill occurred during the 2000-2001 winter.  Bluegill, black crappie, northern pike, walleye and channel catfish were stocked in 2001. <br> \n <br> \nHigh numbers of walleye were gill netted (47.0/net) averaging 13.7 inches.  Gill netted walleye were 11.5-21.5 inches long, but trap nets sampled fish up to 23.2 inches.  Approximately 98% of the gill net sample was 11.5 to 17.9 inches long.  Walleye fry are stocked every-other-year at Hanska.  Low numbers of large sized northern pike were sampled in 2006, as was the case in 2005.  Trap nets sampled more northern pike than gill nets did, with fish ranging in length from 27.2-37.1 inches.  Black bullhead were extremely abundant in the gill nets (197/net), but averaged only 6.4 inches.  The longest black bullhead surveyed was 8.3 inches.  Gill nets sampled high numbers of carp that averaged 14.5 inches.  Moderate numbers of black crappie were gill netted, for this type of lake, with fish ranging from 7.0-11.2  in length.  Black crappie only averaged 7.9 inches and few fish were over 9 inches.  Low to fair numbers of bluegill were trap netted (4.2/net) as was the case during the past several assessments.  Bluegill were 3.5-8.3 inches long averaging 5.3 inches.  Gill nets sampled few (2) channel catfish ranging in length from 20.4-25.6 inches.  During shoreline seining several young-of-th-year channel catfish were sampled, indicating that natural reproduction had occurred.  Catfish were last stocked in 2001.   </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A population assessment was conducted at Hanska Lake, a designated wildlife lake, in 2012 to monitor the fish community and assess the latest walleye stocking regime. An aerator is operated at each end of the lake during the winter to reduce the frequency and severity of winterkill events. No winterkill events have been reported in recent years. <br> \n <br> \nA total of 85 walleyes were sampled with gill nets for a catch rate of 17.0/net, indicating high numbers were present. The catch rate in 2011 was 14.0/net. Lengths ranged from 12.6 to 15.9 inches long with an average length of 14.0 inches. A total of 8 walleyes up to 16.5 inches long were sampled with trap nets for a catch rate of 0.7/net. Fish from both gears were either 3 or 4 years old, with over 96% being 4 years old from 2009 when walleye fry were stocked. Growth rates in 2012 were moderate. Four strong year-classes, all during stocked years, have been produced (2001, 2003, 2005, and 2009) since the partial winterkill in 2001, however naturally reproduced contributions cannot be ruled out.  <br> \n <br> \nTwo northern pike were sampled with the gill nets for a catch rate of 0.4/net, indicating low numbers were present for the 7th consecutive sample since 2001.Gill netted northern pike were 20.5 and 22.5 inches long. One 42.3 inch long northern pike was sampled with trap nets for a catch rate of 0.1/net. <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled a total of 249 yellow perch for a catch rate of 49.8/net, indicating high numbers were present for the first time in 9 samples since 1997 (55.0/net). The catch rate in 2011 was 7.3/net. Lengths ranged from 4.5 to 11.8 inches with an average of 7.5 inches. It appears as though the yellow perch population in Hanska Lake has finally recovered from partial winterkill events in 1998 and 2001. Yellow perch were not reintroduced following either event. <br> \n <br> \nA total of 121 black crappie were sampled with gill nets for a catch rate of 24.2/net, indicating high numbers were present. No black crappies were sampled with gill nets in 2011. In 2012, gill netted black crappies ranged from 5.1 to 7.7 inches long with an average length of 6.5 inches. Trap nets sampled a total of 53 black crappies for a catch rate of 4.4/net, also indicating high numbers were present. Lengths ranged from 5.3 to 11.1 inches with an average of 7.3 inches. Black crappies from both gears ranged from 1-3 years old with 3 year-classes present. Age-1 fish from 2011 accounted for approximately 90% of the sample. Growth rates were fast. <br> \n <br> \nTrap nets sampled 115 bluegills for a catch rate of 9.6/net, indicating high numbers were present. Lengths ranged from 3.0 to 9.4 inches long with an average length of 7.4 inches. Approximately 77% of the trap net sample was over 8 inches. A total of 13 bluegills up to 9.3 inches long were sampled with gill nets for a catch rate of 2.6/net. Bluegills from trap nets were 1-3 years old with 98% being 3 years old from 2009. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass were not sampled with trap or gill nets in the 2012 or 2011 sample. <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled 18 common carp for a catch rate of 3.6/net, indicating high numbers were present. The catch rate in 2011 was 12.3/net. Lengths ranged from 18.6 to 29.1 inches long with an average length of 20.9 inches. A total of 19 common carp up to 30.0 inches long were sampled with trap nets for a catch rate of 1.6/net.  <br> \n <br> \nA total of 61 black bullheads were sampled with gill nets for a catch rate of 12.2/net, indicating moderate numbers were present. The catch rate in 2011 was 42.7/net. Black bullhead numbers have decreased considerably after averaging 295.4/net from 1999-2006 following the winterkill events in 1998 and 2001. Only 16 black bullheads were sampled with  trap nets in 2012 for a catch rate of 1.3, indicating low numbers were present. <br> \n <br> \nA total of 90 channel catfish were sampled with gill nets for a catch rate of 18.0/net, indicating high numbers were present and was the highest ever sampled in Hanska Lake. The next highest catch rate was 8.7/net in 2011. Channel catfish were sampled for the first time in 2001. Lengths ranged from 6.5 to 26.1 inches with an average of 20.8 inches. Over 74% of the sample was over 20 inches long. A total of 23 channel catfish up to 24.6 inches long were sampled with trap nets for a catch rate of 1.9/net. Fish from both gears ranged from 1-7 years old with 5 year-classes present. More than half the sample was from the 2008 year-class. Since channel catfish were only stocked once (2001), it appears there is now a self-sustaining population in Hanska Lake.  <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled in 2012 include bigmouth buffalo, white sucker, yellow bullhead, and hybrid sunfish (Lepomis spp.).</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>STATUS OF THE FISHERY:\nThis assessment was done to track the fishery, which is developing, following the 1989 reclamation.  Few fish were sampled in the1990 population assessment with only 3 perch, 1 northern and 25 crappie sampled.  Largemouth bass are now abundant averaging 63.33/trap net.  Largemouth bass are 6.5-7.4 inches and are age 1.  Black Crappie were abundant, averaging 233.00/gill net and 188.33/trapnet.  Crappies were dominated by young of the year and yearlings.  The yearlings exhibited normal growth, averaging 2.4 inches, and then grew extremely fast until the time they were sampled.  These fish ranged from 6.5-7.9 inches long in August.  Young of year fish grew very fast, ranging from 3.5-4.9 inches long in August.  The density of fathead minnows in 1990 and 1991 may explain the different crappie growth patterns in these two years (normal in 1990; fast for both year classes present in 1991).  Fatheads were very abundant in 1990, probably competing with the 1990 black crappie year class during the first year, so limiting their growth to the normal rate - even in an environment that appears vacant at first glance.  After their first year, the black crappie had grown large enough to use the fathead minnows as food, did so, and grew very quickly as a result.  As the fatheads were consumed, their competitive influence on the growth of the 1991 black crappie year class was much less than on the 1990 year class.  Bluegill were in low abundance, averaging 9.67/trap net.  Bluegill are growing fast.  Walleye were well represented in the gill net with 49 fish captured.  Walleye range in size from 6.5-15.9 inches.  Walleye yearlings dominated the netting with fewer 2 year olds sampled.  This indicates the 1990 yearling stocking was successful, and either the fry or fingerling (or both) stockings in 1990 were also successful.  Growth is above average for walleye, at 5.8 and 10.8 inches for age 1 and 2, respectively.  </p>",

A single year class of 6-8 inch fish dominated.  Black crappie were caught at 19.3/trap net.  Some of these fish were 9-11 inches, with good numbers of small fish present.  Walleye were abundant, averaging 52.0/gill net.  Most of these fish were 12-14 inches in length.  Yellow perch were captured at 36/gill net, a considerable increase from the 0.5/gill net observed in 1992.  The majority of these fish appear to be members of a 1991 year class.Largemouth bass were abundant at 46/hour of electrofishing.  Largemouth bass were represented by 8-12 inch fish (89%) and 12-15 inch fish (11%).</p>",

Walleye remain very abundant, with most fish exceeding 14 inches.  Walleyes are in excellent condition and may be difficult to catch because of the abundant forage in the lake.  Northern pike appear to have successfully reproduced in the lake and the fish are of quality size, averaging 25 inches in length and 3 pounds in weight.  Because of the shallowness of the lake, anglers should focus on cool water inlets that concentrate fish during the summer months.Yellow perch fishing should continue to improve, with the average perch at 9 inches in length.  Perch fishermen should be able to locate fish on some of the sand bars located in the west arm of the lake.  Bass fishermen should enjoy fishing Hanska, with the abundance of largemouth present.  The remaining cattail band around part of the lake will concentrate and hold many of these fish.  Black crappie numbers continue to be good, with many fish between 8-10 inches and many 6-7 inch fish coming up.  Spring and winter seem to provide the best angling for Hanska crappies.  Bluegill numbers have shown some decline, but young fish are present, suggesting natural reproduction is occurring.  Most of the population is made up of fish between 4 and 6 inches in length.  These fish should provide some angling over the next couple of years.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Hanska is a large (1,794 acres) and shallow lake located near the City of Hanska in Brown County. A large state-owned access with a double cement boat ramp is located on the southeast shore. A smaller state-owned access with a cement boat ramp is located at the northwest end of the lake - north of Godahl. A moderate-sized county access with a cement boat ramp is located at the northwest end of the lake - on the north shoreline. Fishing piers are found at the two accesses on the northwest end and at the Hanska County Park on the east end of the lake. Hanska has 21 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 16 feet. There are dredged sections of the lake at the southeast and the northwest ends of the lake, but much of the mid-portion of the lake is closer to 6 feet in depth. The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MNDNR) has divided Minnesota's lakes into 44 different classes based on physical and chemical characteristics. Hanska is a class 41 lake and other similar lakes in the Hutchinson Fisheries Management Area are Washington and Long (Grove City), both in Meeker County.  <br> \n <br> \nHanska Lake occasionally suffers from winterkill and fish populations can fluctuate widely depending on the severity of the latest event. The last severe winterkill was in 2001. Species that are more intolerant of low winter oxygen levels include Bluegill, Largemouth Bass, and Channel Catfish and these species tend to experience greater mortality during harsh winters. Hanksa is often aerated during the winter to provide small refuge areas for fish during severe winters. Aeration systems are present at the southeast and northwest ends of the lake. Anglers are encouraged to stay far back from the open water and thin ice signs during the winter.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye were sampled in good numbers in 2021, with fish averaging 16 inches in length and maxing out at 23 inches. Walleye tend to do well in the turbid waters of Hanska Lake. Trolling crankbaits should do the trick as submergent vegetation is often sparse at this lake. A leech under a bobber or a jig and a minnow are other local favorite techniques for catching Walleye. In recent years, Black Crappie have become a larger part of the angler's catch as their numbers have increased during the last two surveys (2017 and 2021). The fishing pier at the county park is a great place to try a tube jig tipped with a small minnow to catch crappie in the spring.  <br> \n <br> \nChannel Catfish were abundant in 2021 with gill netted catfish averaging 14 inches in length. The longest Channel Catfish sampled in 2021 was just under 28 inches. Shore fishing towards sunset with a piece of chicken liver laying on the bottom should provide some action from a hungry channel cat. Bluegill were not abundant in 2021, but large sized fish were definitely present. Almost half the Bluegill sampled in the trap nets were 8 inches or longer, with maximum length being an impressive 10 inches. Try a teardrop jig with a waxworm along the shorelines, up under the tree branches, for both Bluegill and crappie in the spring. You may even get a nice perch using this technique. Although Yellow Perch were not sampled in good numbers, a few 9 to 10 inch fish were present that could be considered a bonus catch while fishing Hanksa Lake.  <br> \n <br> \nOther species that anglers may encounter include Bigmouth Buffalo, Black Bullhead, Common Carp, Freshwater Drum, Green Sunfish, Hybrid Sunfish, Largemouth Bass, White Sucker, and Yellow Bullhead. Of interest, this was the first time that Freshwater Drum were sampled at Hanska. As a new member of the fish community and opportunistic forager, Freshwater Drum will provide angling opportunities and make great table fare for anglers who take the time to fillet carefully and remove the red tissue along the fish's lateral line. <br> \n <br> \nPeople can have significant impacts on lakes and the fish populations they support. Overharvest, lakeshore development, removal of shoreline vegetation, and introductions of invasive species can all adversely affect fish populations. Aquatic invasive species (AIS) are typically moved from infested to non-infested waters by anglers, boaters and lakeshore owners, and can adversely impact lakes and fish populations. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants and animals from their watercraft and drain all lake water from their boat and bait buckets before leaving the lake. If you suspect an infestation of an invasive species in this lake, save a specimen and report it to a local DNR office. Additional information on all of these topics can be found on the DNR website (www.dnr.state.mn.us) or by contacting the Hutchinson Area Fisheries office.</p>",

This population assessment is in response to evaluate the success of the reclamation and to assess the introduction stockings.  Few fish were sampled in netting, with none captured in gill nets and one northern pike and three yellow perch sampled in 3/4 inch trap nets.  Additional 1/2 inch and 1/4 inch trap net sets were made to sample young-of-year fish.  A few black crappie young-of-year and many fathead minnows were captured.  Other species sampled, which apparently survived the reclamation, include green sunfish and stickleback.  Species introduced but not sampled include walleye, largemouth bass and bluegill.\n\n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>In 2011, a population assessment was conducted at Hanska, a designated wildlife lake, to monitor the fish population.  Two aeration systems were operated during the winter to reduce the likelihood and severity of winterkill, with the most recent partial winterkill occurring in 2001.  A lack of winterkill over the last decade could also have been the result of several mild winters and/or higher water levels.  A reduced number of nets were set in 2011, due to the July 1st government shutdown.  A fishing pier is present at the County Park on the east end of the lake.     <br> \n  <br> \nGill nets sampled 42 walleye for a catch rate of 14.0/net, which was within the normal range for this type of lake.  The 2006 catch rate was 47.0/net.  Gill net catch rates from 2001 to 2011 (n=7) were variable, ranging from 4.5 to 47.0/net with an average of 18.2/net.  Catch rates from 1983 to 2011 (n=17), under various stocking regimes, ranged from 0.0 to 54.0/net with an average of 21.5/net.  Gill netted walleye were 8.2 to 20.1 inches long with an average of 9.9, in 2011.  Approximately 90% of the gill net sample was less than the 10 inches in length.  Aged walleye were 2 to 6 years old with 4 year-classes present.  Approximately 98% of the fish that were aged corresponded with stocked year-classes, which may indicate that natural reproduction was not significant at Hanska Lake.  Age 2 fish made up the majority of the gill net catch (93%), indicating a strong year-class.  The latest fry stocking regime (1,000/littoral acre every-other-year) was initiated in 2001.  Initial growth was slow for the 2009 year-class, but those fish should be of a more acceptable size to anglers within a year or two.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike were not sampled in gill nets or in trap nets, in 2011.  Gill net catch rates from 2001 to 2011 (n=7) ranged from 0.0 to 4.3/net with an average of 0.8.  Catch rates from 1983 to 2011 (n=17) ranged from 0.0 to 5.5/net with an average of 0.9.  Only 3 northern pike have been gill netted in the last six assessments (2002-2011), indicating that recruitment is poor most years.  Past assessments, looking at fall trap netting data, has shown low numbers of large sized northern pike to be present in Hanska.    <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled 22 yellow perch for a catch rate of 7.3/net, which was within the normal range for this type of lake.  The 2011 catch rate was the highest recorded since the partial winterkill in 2001.  Catch rates from 1983 to 2011 (n=17) were highly variable, ranging from 0.0 to 55.0/net with an average of 14.4.  Gill netted yellow perch were 6.6 to 10.1 inches long with an average of 8.95.  Approximately 41% of the gill net sample was 9 inches or longer.    <br> \n <br> \nGill nets did not sample any black crappie in 2011.  The trap net catch rate was 0.6/net in 2011 and 2.5/net in 2006, both indicating that low numbers were present.  Trap net catch rates from 2001 to 2011 (n=7) were mostly low ranging from 0.6 to 16.8/net with an average of 4.4.  In 2011, trap netted black crappie were 8.1 to 8.7 inches long with an average of 8.4.  Black crappie were estimated to be 2 to 3 years old with 2 year-classes present, in 2011.  Growth was fast.    <br> \n    <br> \nTrap nets sampled 17 bluegill for a catch rate of 3.4/net, which was within the normal range for this type of lake.  The 2006 catch rate (4.2/net) was also low.  Catch rates from 1983 to 2011 (n=17) were highly variable ranging from 0.0 to 166.0/net with an average of 20.2.  Catch rates from 2001 to 2011 (n=7) were all low, ranging from 0.5 to 4.8/net with an average of 2.9.  In 2011, trap netted bluegill were 6.9 to 8.1 inches long with an average of 7.4.  In 2011, trap netted bluegill were 3 to 5 years old with 3 year-classes present.  Growth was fast.     <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass were not sampled in gill nets or in trap nets, in 2011.   <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled 37 carp for a catch rate of 12.3/net, which was above the normal range for this type of lake, and indicated that high numbers were present.  The 2006 catch rate was even higher at 24.0/net.  Catch rates (n=17) from 1983 to 2011 were highly variable ranging from 0.0 to 36.0/net with an average of 5.8.  Catch rates from 2001 to 2011 (n=7) ranged from 0.0 to 24.0/net with an average of 5.5.  Gill netted carp were 12.7 to 26.3 inches long with an average of 17.6.  Carp were the most abundant species sampled in trap nets (9.6/net) in 2011. <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled 128 black bullhead for a catch rate of 42.7/net, which was within the normal range for this type of lake.  The 2006 catch rates was over four times higher at 197.8/net.  Trap nets sampled 5.2/net in 2011 and 143.8/net in 2006.  The gill net catch rate and the trap net catch rate were both the lowest on record following the 2001 partial winterkill.  Gill netted black bullhead were 7.1 to 10.8 inches long with an average of 8.6.     <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled 26 channel catfish for a catch rate of 8.7/net, which was the highest ever measured at Hanska.  Catch rates from 2001 to 2011 (N=7) were variable, ranging from 0.0 to 8.7/net.  Channel catfish were 12.8 to 23.7 inches long averaging 17.7.  Approximately 77% of the gill net sample was 16 inches or longer.  A small sub-sample (6 fish) of channel catfish was aged and those fish were 3 to 6 years old with 3 year-classes being present.  This data indicated that natural reproduction may be occurring within Hanska Lake.  Channel catfish (yearlings and fingerlings) were only stocked one time (2001), at Hanska. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A standard survey was conducted at Hanska Lake the week of June 19, 2017 to monitor the fish population and to do a preliminary evaluation of the 2013 Walleye stocking regime.  Gill nets and trap nets were set to sample the fish community.  The 2013 lake management plan lists Walleye as the primary management species while, Channel Catfish, Bluegill, and Black Crappie are listed as secondary species.  In 2017, a total of 14 species, plus Hybrid Sunfish, were sampled in the gill nets and trap nets.  Catch rates were compared to other similar lakes across the state.  Hanska Lake's dissolved oxygen levels were adequate for fish use, from top to bottom, on 6/19/17.  The water clarity was limited, with a secchi disk reading of 2.3 feet, due to algae.  A fishing pier was available at the Hanska Lake Brown County Park on the east side of the lake.  Smaller fishing piers, at accesses on the Northwest side of the lake, were also available.  Hanska has a history of winterkill with a severe kill occurring in 2001, and a lighter event occurring in 2014.  Aerators, one at the northwest end and the other on the southeast end, are sometimes operated at Hanska to reduce the likelihood and severity of winterkill.  Fish populations can fluctuate widely on winterkill lakes depending on the frequency and severity of the latest kill.  Hanska Lake is a designated Wildlife Lake with drawdown capabilities.  Curlyleaf Pondweed, a non-native aquatic submerged plant, can reach nuisance levels in May and June in various parts of the lake.  Hanska is a long (7 miles) and shallow lake, and with its NW to SE orientation, is subject to big waves on a windy day.  Areas on the NW and SE ends have been dredged to 10 to 12 feet, but most of the center of the lake is only 5 to 6 feet deep.    <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled low to moderate numbers (22) of Walleye for a catch rate of 4.4/net, which was within what might be expected for this type of lake.  The 2012 catch rate was 17.0/net.  Historic catch rates from 1983 to 2017 (n=19) were generally high, ranging from 0.0 to 54.0/net with an average 20.4.  Different stocking amounts and periods of no stocking occurred during these 34 years.  The latest Walleye fry stocking regime (1,773,000 fry two out of three years) was initiated in 2013.  Fry were stocked in 2013, 2014, 2016, and 2017.  In 2017, gill netted Walleye were 10.4 to 26.2 inches long with an average of 13.9.  Approximately 68% of the gill net sample was between 12.0 and 14.9 inches in length, but only 9% were 15.0 inches or longer, indicating a mediocre size structure.  Trap nets sampled almost as many (19) Walleye as the gill nets did, which is rare, with a maximum length of 28.4 inches.  Walleye, from both gears, were age-1 to age-12 with seven year classes present.  Gill net aged fish matched up 100% with stocked years and approximately 94% of the trap net aged fish matched up with stocked years also.  This may indicate that natural reproduction is not significant at Hanska Lake.  Assessments in 2011 and 2012 also indicated that natural reproduction may not be significant.  The inability to separate fry stocked Walleye from naturally reproduced fish, during stocked years, confounds potential evaluation.  Walleye anglers could expect fair fishing at Hanska. <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled low numbers (1) of Northern Pike for a catch rate of 0.2/net, which was below what might be expected for this type of lake.  This catch rate indicated that recruitment was very low.  The 2012 catch rate was also low at 0.4/net.  Historical catch rates from 1983 to 2017 (n=19) were mostly low ranging from 0.0 to 5.5/net with an average of 0.9.  The gill netted Northern Pike was 17.5 inches long.  Trap nets did not sample any Northern Pike in 2017.  Inadequate spawning habitat and hot summer water temperatures may be limiting the pike population at Hanska.   <br> \nTrap nets sampled moderate numbers (181) of Black Crappie for a catch rate of 15.1/net, which was above what might be expected for this lake type.  The 2012 catch rate was 4.4/net.  Historic catch rates from 1983 to 2017 (n=19) were highly variable ranging from 0.0 to 188.3/net with an average of 25.1.  Trap netted Black Crappie were 5.1 to 11.3 inches long with an average of 9.5.  Approximately 82% of the trap net catch was 9 inches or longer.  Gill nets sampled low numbers (1) of Black Crappie for a catch rate of 0.2/net, which was below what might be expected for this type of lake.  The 2012 catch rate was 24.2/net.  Historic gill net catch rates (n=19) were variable, ranging from 0.0 to 223.0/net with an average of 23.3.  The trap net size distribution indicated that multiple year classes were present and that a quality population was present.  Good numbers and sizes of crappie were present, but it may take a little searching to find them in this 1,700 acre lake. <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled high numbers (42) of Channel Catfish for a catch rate of 8.4/net.  The 2012 catch rate was 18.0/net.  Historic catch rates from 1983 to 2017 (n=19) ranged from 0.0 to 18.0/net with an average of 2.3.  In 2017, gill netted Channel Catfish were 6.6 to 25.8 inches long with an average of 19.5.  Approximately 55% of the gill net catch was 20 inches or longer.  The size distribution indicated that multiple year classes were present.  Trap nets sampled fish up to 26.8 inches in length.  The one year stocking of Channel Catfish, in 2001, was highly successful and the population is now naturally reproducing and sustaining themselves.  A light winterkill, in 2014, followed by a summerkill that same year, likely reduced Channel Catfish numbers at Hanska Lake, but the population likely rebounded in time for the 2017 assessment.  Catfish anglers should expect good action from these easy to catch, hard fighting, and delicious tasting fish.   <br> \n <br> \nTrap nets sampled low numbers (65) of Bluegill for a catch rate of 5.4/net which was within what might be expected for this type of lake.  The 2012 catch rate was 9.6/net.  Historic catch rates from 1983 to 2017 (n=19) were mostly low, ranging from 0.0 to 166.0/net, with an average of 18.9.  In 2017, trap netted Bluegill were 3.4 to 9.9 inches long with an average of 7.6.  Approximately 67% of the trap net sample was 7 inches or longer, indicating a quality size structure.  The size distribution indicated that multiple year classes were present, but recruitment would not be considered consistent.  Bluegill anglers may want to target these fish in the spring and early summer, when they should be more concentrated and easier to locate. <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled low numbers (9) of Yellow Perch for a catch rate of 1.8/net, which was below what might be expected for this type of lake.  The 2012 catch rate was much higher at 49.8/net.  Historic catch rates from 1983 to 2017 (n=19) were variable, ranging from 0.0 to 54.4/net with an average of 15.6.  In 2017, gill netted Yellow Perch were 6.3 to 10.5 inches long with an average of 8.7.  The size distributions and a low catch rate indicated inconsistent reproduction.  Some quality sized fish were present for anglers, but numbers appeared to be quite low.  <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled high numbers (146) of Common Carp for a catch rate of 29.2/net which was above what might be expected for this lake type and the second highest ever recorded at Hanska.  Historic gill net catch rates from 1983 to 2017 (n=19) were highly variable, ranging from 0.0 to 36.0/net with an average of 6.9.  Gill netted fish were 16.0 to 27.6 inches long with an average of 19.1.  Trap nets also sampled high numbers (84) of Common Carp for a catch rate of 7.0/net, which was above what might be expected for this type of lake.  Historic catch rates (n=19) were also quite variable, ranging from 0.0 to 24.0/net with an average of 3.8.  Trap netted Common Carp were 9.7 to 29.6 inches long with an average of 19.3.  Size distributions likely indicated that at least four year classes were present.   <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled moderate numbers (134) of Black Bullhead for a catch rate of 26.8/net, which was within what might be expected for this type of lake.  Historic catch rates from 1983 to 2017 (n=19) were highly variable ranging from 0.0 to 374.0/net with an average of 139.6.  Gill netted Black Bullhead were 9.9 to 12.2 inches long with an average of 11.0.  Trap nets sampled low numbers (54) of Black Bullhead for a catch rate of 4.5/net, which was within what might be expected for this lake type.  Trap netted fish were 10.1 to 13.0 inches long.  Both size distributions indicated inconsistent recruitment.   <br> \n <br> \nAdditional species sampled in the standard gear included Bigmouth Buffalo, Brown Bullhead, Golden Shiner, Green Sunfish, Hybrid Sunfish, Yellow Bullhead, and White Sucker. <br> \n</p>",

The abundant age 4 group is from the 1984 fry stocking, and the well represented age 1 and age 2 groups are from natural reproduction.  Walleyes averaged 37.60/gill net, which exceed the state median by over ten times.  There is an excellent size distribution, with 25% of the fish sampled exceeding 17 inches.  Yellow perch average 10.60/gill net compared to 29.60/gill net in the 1983 survey.  Perch are represented by ages 1-4 compared to the 3 and 4 year olds sampled in 1983.  Apparently, perch survived the ?84 winterkill, with perch last stocked in 1982.  Black crappie were not sampled in 1988.  Black crappie were well represented in the ?83 survey with 1 year olds 7.0-9.4 inches.  Black crappie were not stocked after the 1984 winterkill.   Black bullhead, white sucker, and bigmouth buffalo have remained unchanged since the 1983 survey, and are all abundant.  Carp have shown a large increase, now averaging 36.00/gill net compared to only one sampled in 1983.  Orangespot sunfish and green sunfish were abundant in the 1983 netting compared to only one orangespot sunfish sampled and no green sunfish sampled in the 1988 netting.  </p>",

An assessment of the fish community in Lake Hanska was conducted in early September 2003.  Walleye stockings of the 2001 year-class as fry, fingerlings, and yearlings have produced a sizeable walleye population consisting entirely of fish from this single year-class.  Walleye catch per gill net was well above normal levels for class 41 lakes.  Most walleye were around 12 to 15 inches.  Black bullhead catch in both gill nets and trap nets was extremely high, continuing the high catches first observed in 1999 after being low from 1993 though 1997.  Black bullhead ranged in size from 4 to 14 inches with most trap nets captured fish around 7 inches.  Trap net catches of black crappie, walleye, and white sucker were above normal.  Black crappie were mostly around 7 inches long with some up to 9 inches.  Bluegill were mostly 7 inches.  Northern pike, channel catfish, and largemouth bass also provide some angling opportunities.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>STATUS OF THE FISHERY:\nLargemouth bass are abundant, averaging 16.00/gill net compared to 63.33/trap net in 1991.  Bass continue to be represented by one cohort, which had a median length of 7.0 inches in 1991 compared to the 9.5 inch bass now present.  The two year olds present are expected to enter the creel next year as 11.0-12.0 inch fish.  Black crappie remain abundant at 78.75/trap net compared to 188.33/trap net in 1991.  Both year classes, which dominated in 1991 as young of the year and yearlings, continue to dominate as 1 and 2 year olds.  Growth remains good averaging 5.6 inches at age 2 compared to the state median of 4.8 inches.  Angling for crappie should increase next year, as they become acceptable size.  Bluegill have grown enough to become vulnerable to survey gear.  Bluegills averaged 9.67/trap net in 1991 compared to 166.00/trap net in 1992.  The median length for bluegill is 5.5 inches.  Bluegills netted are represented by 1 and 2 year olds.  Growth has been fast, averaging 4.9 inches at age 2 compared to the state average of 3.4 inches.  Anglers should begin harvesting bluegills next year with many bluegills > 6.0 inches present.  Walleye have declined from 49.0/gill net in 1991 to 15.5/gill net.  Walleye netted in 1991 were represented by 1 and 2 year olds compared to ages 1-3 now present.  The large peak in the length distribution that appeared from 12-14\" in the1991 survey did not carry through to the 1992 survey, suggesting that larger fish have been harvested by anglers.  Growth is average for 2 year olds, but well above state averages for ages 1 and 3.  Few northern pike are present, with 1 fish netted in 1991 compared to none in 1992.  Yellow perch are in low abundance, with only one fish netted compared to eleven sampled in 1991.  Hybrid sunfish and green fish have increased, averaging 47.5 and 21.5/trap net, respectively.  Only a few green sunfish were netted in 1991.  Carp averaged 24.0/trap net in 1991 compared to 3.5/trap net now.  Carp are represented by 12.0-18.5 inch fish compared to the 8.5-11.4 inch fish sampled in 1991.  Black bullhead were first netted in 1991 with 4 fish sampled, following the 1989 reclamation of Hanska Lake.  Black bullhead now (1992) average 16.5/gillnet, and are dominated by 7.5 to 10.4 inch fish.</p>",
