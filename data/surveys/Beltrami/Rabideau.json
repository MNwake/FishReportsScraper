                "narrative": "<p>Rabideau Lake is a 577-acre lake with a maximum depth of 112 feet.  There is two distinct basins on the lake.  The eastern basin is mostly less than 10 feet deep.  The western basin is much smaller but has the deepest water in the lake.  The lake is located six miles south of Blackduck in Beltrami County.  There is a DNR public access on the east end of the lake off of Forest Service road 2208.  The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different lake classes based on physical and chemical characteristics.  Rabideau Lake is in lake class 35.  Lakes in this lake class are typically small, irregularly shaped and with a high percentage of the lake area less than 15 feet deep.  Other area lakes in the same lake class include Big Bass, Gull, Stump, Larson, Moose and Minnow Lakes.  Rabideau Lake is managed for bluegill, black crappie and walleye.  Rabideau Lake is within the Chippewa National Forest.  Most of the shoreline is under public ownership.  Most of the private shoreline is on the south shore on both east and west basins.  Periodic winter kills have been documented.  The last documented winter kill occurred in 1995 - 96.  Because of these periodic winter kills, bullheads are the most common species in Rabideau Lake since they are adapted to survive low levels of oxygen.  A lot of the bullheads present are of a size that would be acceptable to anglers seeking these species.Rabideau Lake is known for producing panfish such as black crappie and bluegill.  These populations can be cyclic as they recover from winter kill events.  Eighty-six percent of the bluegill aged in 2002 were 2 - 4 years old as the population rebuilds from the last winter kill.  Bluegill grow fast in Rabideau Lake reaching seven inches by the time they are four years old.  There were a lot of black crappie sampled that were 10.0 - 10.5 inches long.  These crappie were from the 1998 year class.  Four other year classes were also sampled.  If this lake can avoid another winter kill event in the next couple of years, it should provide some very good panfish angling.Anglers will have good success fishing for northern pike.  Pike abundance is typical of other lake class 35 lakes and of past surveys.  Ample spawning is the reason for this consistency in abundance.  Most of the shoreline in the east basin has a marshy fringe and provides excellent habitat for spawning pike.  The DNR stocked walleye fry immediately after the last winter kill, then continued with fingerling stockings on alternate years.  Walleye were sampled at relatively low abundance.  Only walleye from the initial fry stocking in 1996 were sampled in substantial numbers.  It would appear that fingerling stocking and natural reproduction are contributing very little to this fishery.Yellow perch is the main food for northern pike and walleye.  Yellow perch abundance is typical of other lake class 35 lakes but below what was found in past surveys.  Perch ranged in length from 5 - 11 inches with 34% greater than eight inches.  Shoreline areas are important habitat for both fish and wildlife that live in or near our lakes.  Overdeveloped shorelines degrade both the habitat and water quality that are associated with natural undeveloped lakes.  The combined effects of all lakeshore owners \"fixing up\" their property can destroy a lake's valuable natural shorelines.A shoreline consists of many parts such as aquatic plants, woody debris and natural lake bottom soils.  Shrubs, trees and woody debris such as fallen trees or limbs provide good habitat both above and below the water and should be left in place.  Natural lake bottom materials like silt or gravel is more ecologically productive than pure sand trucked in for a swimming beach.  A tidy lawn and a sandy beach make great spots for sunbathing and swimming but do little to provide habitat for fish and wildlife.  By leaving a buffer strip of natural vegetation along the shoreline, property owners can reduce erosion, help maintain water quality and provide habitat and travel corridors for wildlife.Only if more lakeshore owners manage their shoreline in a natural condition can fish and wildlife populations on Minnesota lakes remain healthy and abundant.  More specific information on protecting or restoring shorelines and watersheds is available at your area DNR Fisheries offices.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Rabideau Lake is a 577 acre lake with a maximum depth of 112 feet located in southeastern Beltrami County.  The lake is characterized by having two distinct basins.  The larger east basin is less than 15 feet deep and is covered with aquatic vegetation.  In contrast, the smaller western basin has little water less than 15 feet deep and a maximum depth of more than 100 feet.  Rabideau Lake is within the Chippewa National Forest and most of its shoreline is under public ownership.  There is a state-owned public access on the east end of the lake off of Forest Service road 2208. <br> \n <br> \nThe Minnesota Department of Natural Resources has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different lake classes based on physical and chemical characteristics.  Rabideau Lake is in lake class 35.  Lakes in this lake class are typically small, have an irregularly shaped shoreline and a high percentage of the lake area less than 15 feet deep.  Other Bemidji area lakes in the same lake class include Big Bass, Gull, Stump, Larson, Moose and Minnow.  Rabideau Lake is managed for bluegill, black crappie and walleye. <br> \n <br> \nPeriodic winterkills have been documented with the last one occurring in 1995-96.  Fish community composition is affected by these winterkills and species that can withstand low oxygen levels such as bullheads have a competitive advantage.  However, in the past ten years, adult bullhead abundance has declined, while average fish size has increased.  It appears that the lake's fish community is moving from a lake in flux to a community with more balance and diversity.  In the past, after a winterkill, introductory stockings of adult bluegill, largemouth bass and walleye were conducted.  Currently, walleye fingerlings are stocked on alternate years. <br> \n <br> \nRabideau Lake is well known to anglers for its bluegill and black crappie fishing.  These populations can be cyclic as they recover from winterkill events.  In 2008, Rabideau Lake had a low-density bluegill population with an excellent size structure.  Forty percent of the bluegill captured in the 2008 assessment were greater than eight inches in length, and eight different year classes were identified.  Seventy-eight percent of the bluegill were older than age-4, while in 2002, only 48% were older than age-4.  Black crappie appear to have recovered as well, ranging in length from 7 to 12 inches with an average length of 9 inches.  Six different year classes were identified which indicates consistent natural reproduction. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers should have good success fishing for northern pike.  Pike are fairly abundant, though most pike captured in the 2008 assessment were less than 22 inches long. However, some pike greater than 30 inches long were also captured.  Six different year classes were identified. <br> \n <br> \nEven though walleye fingerlings are stocked every other year, walleye abundance in 2008 was the lowest of the past four assessments dating back to 1990.  It appears that fingerling stocking is contributing little to this fishery. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch are abundant in Rabideau Lake and are an important forage species.  However, few perch were captured that were of a size that would be acceptable to anglers. <br> \n <br> \nOther species captured during this assessment include bullheads, largemouth bass, pumpkinseed, rock bass, white sucker and tullibee (cisco). <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Rabideau Lake is a 577-acre lake located in the Chippewa National Forest near the city of Blackduck in Beltrami County.  Most of the lakeshore is undeveloped, with a small number of lake homes and cabins.  The lake has two distinct basins connected by a navigable channel.  The east basin of the lake is less than 12 feet deep and has lots of aquatic vegetation, while the west basin of the lake contains little shallow water and has a maximum depth of 120 feet.  The lake tends to stratify strongly in summer, with little oxygen for fish below a depth of 10 feet.  There is a DNR public water access located on the east end of the lake with a concrete ramp and parking for about 5 trucks/trailers.  Rabideau is managed for Bluegill, Black Crappie and Walleye.   <br> \n <br> \nThe Minnesota Department of Natural Resources has classified Minnesota lakes into 43 different lake classes based on physical characteristics and the fish community present in the lake.   Rabideau is in lake class 35.  The following discussion makes comparisons between Rabideau Lake and other class 35 lakes in the state.  Other Bemidji area lakes in this class include Big Bass, Stump, and Gull Lake near Tenstrike.   <br> \n <br> \nDue to the extensive aquatic vegetation and shallow water found in the eastern lake basin, Rabideau Lake is prone to winterkill events, which affect the size and numbers of fish present in the lake at any time.   The last significant winterkill was documented in 1995-96.  However, several partial winterkills have occurred since then, and reports of some dead fish were received shortly after ice-out in 2014.  The results of the 2014 population assessment showed that numbers and sizes of the primary management species were down slightly but still comparable to past assessments as well as populations in other similar lakes.   <br> \n <br> \nThe 2014 assessment results showed a low density Bluegill population with quality size structure.  The trap net catch rate for Bluegill (3.67/trap net) was just below the normal range for this lake class (4/trap net - 28.07/trap net).  Bluegill captured ranged from 4.09 inches to over 10 inches in length with an average length of 8.46 inches and average weight of 0.60 lbs/fish, which was well above the normal range (0.1 lbs -0.3 lbs/fish) for class 35 lakes.  The trap net catch rate for Black Crappie (1.08/trap net) was within the normal range (0.69/trap net - 4.32/trap net) and down just slightly from the previous assessment in 2008.  Fish up to 12.99 inches in length were captured; however, the majority of the catch measured less than 9 inches in length.  <br> \n <br> \nRabideau Lake is stocked with Walleye fry on alternate years.  The 2014 Walleye catch rate of 1.11/gill net was just within the normal range for class 35 lakes.  Walleye catch rates have never been particularly high, and catch rates from the past three assessments have been below the median value for this lake class (2.11/gill net).  Walleye captured ranged in length from 15.08 inches to 26.14 inches with a large average size of 20.11 inches.   The absence of smaller fish may indicate low survival from recent stockings; however, Rabideau has good connectivity with the North Branch of the Turtle River, and fish are able to migrate through the connected system to other lakes.  The importance of this connectivity was illustrated by the age distribution of the walleye catch, which included a nearly equal proportion of fish from stocked and non-stocked years.   <br> \n <br> \nThe Northern Pike catch rate of 8.56/gill net was nearly identical to the previous assessment (2008) and falls within the normal range for lake class 35 (3.55/gill net - 11/gill net).   The proportion of larger Pike (>24 inches in length) doubled from 2008, although the average size of Pike in Rabideau Lake remained on the small side at 19.61 inches in length.  The largest Pike sampled in 2014 was 36.65 inches in length.   <br> \n <br> \nOther species of fish captured in the 2014 assessment were Pumpkinseed, Rock Bass, Tullibee Cisco, White Sucker, Bullhead species and Yellow perch.  Yellow perch were abundant, but few fish were of a size that would be of interest to anglers (>8 inches in length).  <br> \n</p>",

Based on the profile, the top of the thermocline (i.e., the location in the water column with the sharpest transition from warm to cold water) occurred at approximately 13 feet. Dissolved oxygen decreased to below 3.0 mg/L at 13.4 feet, which was within the thermocline, at the time of sampling. The temperature at which dissolved oxygen decreased to below 3.0 mg/L (i.e., TDO3, a single variable to characterize oxythermal habitat) was 18.7?C (65.7?F).   <br> \n <br> \nThe TDO3 value and limited habitat indicate that oxythermal conditions are  marginal for Cisco. Dissolved oxygen concentrations within  the thermocline indicate that suitable oxythermal habitat for Cisco was available across a limited range of depths at the time of sampling during the summer of 2023. Data collected in 1998-2014 indicate marginal oxythermal habitat in most years, with the least favorable conditions recorded in 1998. When inadequate oxythermal habitat is available, Cisco are squeezed into unfavorable, warmer water conditions and therefore experience higher levels of stress. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Rabideau Lake is located about six miles south of Blackduck, Minnesota.  Access is off a series of forest service roads and on the east side of the lake.  There is a concrete slab for boat launching but parking is limited.  The lake has essentially two basins with the public access on the larger, shallower part.  That part of the lake is generally less than 10 feet deep and has moderate to heavy submerged and emergent vegetation.  The other part of the lake, accessible by way of a lane through wild rice is very deep with a steep sloping shoreline area.  Winter kills due to oxygen depletion occur frequently in the shallow basin and will occasionally occur throughout the lake.  The lake supports a good wild rice crop many years and occasionally has good waterfowl hunting.  The watershed is entirely forested and within the Chippewa National Forest.  There are a few homes on the lake's west basin.  Rabideau lake is a MN DNR class 35 lake for comparisons of fish communities and abundance.  Other Bemidji area lakes in this class include Big Bass, Little Bass, Stump, and Gull.  Primary management is for walleye with secondary species listed as northern pike, yellow perch, bluegill and black crappie.        Walleye in 1998 were sampled at their highest abundance since assessments began in 1958.  The average length of walleye sampled was 16 inches and the largest was 25 inches.  Walleye fry, fingerlings, and yearlings have been stocked over the past six years, occasionally in response to winter kills.  There may also be natural reproduction some years.  A few walleye had Neascus (black spot), a common parasite of fish that is not harmful to humans.     Northern pike are common though, not as abundant as expected with the high amount of suitable spawning habitat.  The average size of the pike sampled was near 20 inches and the largest was 30 inches. About one-fourth of the pike examined had Neascus.     Yellow perch are abundant but with an average length of 7.1 inches, most are probably too small to be acceptable to most anglers.  Some perch have Neascus and/or yellow grubs, another parasite of fish that is not harmful to humans.     Panfish species (bluegills, black crappie, pumpkinseed sunfish) were apparently hit hard by a partial winter kill in 1996.  Some of them have been reintroduced but it will take some time for the populations to recover.  They are present but anglers contacted on the lake were having difficulty catching them, and sampling results showed low abundances.  Largemouth bass adults were stocked in 1996 to reestablish that population but none were sampled in 1998.     Bullheads are abundant and are occasionally removed under the state's inland commercial fishing program.  Other fish species sampled include white suckers, rock bass, and dogfish.     Wild rice and other emergent plants that are plentiful on Rabideau lake are protected under state statutes.  They provide food and cover for fish and other aquatic life, remove nutrients resulting in improved water clarity, and can protect shoreline areas from wave action that can cause erosion.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Rabideau Lake is a 680-acre lake located in the Chippewa National Forest near the city of Blackduck in Beltrami County.  The lake consists of two distinct basins connected by a navigable channel.  The east basin of the lake is less than 12 feet deep and has lots of aquatic vegetation, while the west basin of the lake contains little shallow water and has a maximum depth of 120 feet.  The west basin of Rabideau stratifies during the summer months with little oxygen for fish below a depth of 15 to 20 feet during most years, which eliminates a lot of water when searching for fish.  There is a DNR public water access located on the east end of the lake with a concrete ramp and parking for about 5 trucks/trailers.  Rabideau is managed for Bluegill, Black Crappie and Walleye.  Statewide fishing regulations are in effect for all species.   <br> \n <br> \nRabideau has a history of partial winter fish kills resulting from low oxygen levels that develop beneath the ice as winter progresses.  The impact of these events on fish populations can be difficult to measure however partial winterkills can certainly affect the abundance of fish such as Bluegill and Black Crappie that are intolerant of low oxygen levels.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie catch rates were at their highest levels recorded in 2021 however the majority of the survey catch consisted of small fish.  These fish should grow quickly and be noticed by anglers in the next few years barring a severe winterkill event.  Quality-size Black Crappie were also present with fish up to 13 inches in length captured.  <br> \n <br> \nRabideau also has a history of producing big Bluegill in the absence of winterkill conditions.  Trap net catch rates were low in this survey but fortunately gill nets produced good catch rates for that gear type and a good sample size for the survey.  A high proportion of the Bluegill catch exceeded 8 inches with fish over to 10 inches in length present.  Similar to Black Crappie, recently produced Bluegill should grow rapidly and hopefully catch the attention of anglers within a few years.    <br> \n <br> \nRabideau supports an abundant Northern Pike population with a good proportion of fish over 26 inches in length.  The largest pike captured in the 2021 survey measured 39 inches.  Pike can provide a lot of fishing action on days when other species refuse to cooperate.  <br> \n  <br> \nFry stocking and fish migration from the North Branch of the Turtle River provide a modest Walleye fishery on Rabideau Lake.  Walleye captured in 2021 had a good average size of nearly 18 inches in length.  Although Walleye are present, anglers targeting the species may want to focus their attention on any of a number of more consistent Walleye fisheries in the area.  <br> \n <br> \nOther species of fish captured in the 2021 survey were bullhead species, Pumpkinseed, Rock Bass, Largemouth Bass, Tullibee (cisco), White Sucker and Yellow Perch.      <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of nearshore fish species in Rabideau Lake was conducted on July 19, 2021, by Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program staff.  Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake, and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible.  Backpack electrofishing was completed at 14 sampling stations, but six stations were sampled from the boat due to site conditions.  Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample two stations, a 15-foot seine was used at five stations, and site conditions prevented the use of seines at seven stations.  Nearshore sampling captured 14 species of fish including two species that are intolerant of disturbance (Blackchin Shiner, Rock Bass) and no species that are tolerant of disturbance. <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore data were combined with trap net and gill net data from a July 2021 survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based IBI (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment.  In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (Blackchin Shiner, Iowa Darter, and Rock Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (Green Sunfish).  The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake.  For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.   <br> \n <br> \nResults from this survey indicate that the fish community in Rabideau Lake is healthy as indicated by an FIBI score above the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes. These results will be considered when the biological health of the lake is assessed during the Mississippi River-Headwaters Watershed assessment process, which will be completed in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency. <br> \n</p>",
