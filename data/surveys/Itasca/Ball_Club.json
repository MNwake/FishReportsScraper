                "narrative": "<p>Ball Club Lake is a large, mesotrophic lake located near Ball Club, MN in the Mississippi River watershed.  The lake is situated within the Chippewa National Forest and the Leech Lake Indian Reservation.  Ball Club Lake has a surface area of 3,936 acres, a maximum depth of 85 feet and clear water.  The lake has four inlets and its outlet is the Ball Club River which flows to the Mississippi River. <br> \n <br> \nThe fisheries lake management plan (LMP) was last revised in 2015.  Walleye and Northern Pike were the primary management species while Black Crappie and Lake Whitefish were considered secondary species.  Walleye are actively managed via stocking, most recently with Mississippi strain fingerlings in alternate years.  The Leech Lake Division of Resource Management provides half of the quota and DNR Fisheries provides the other half.  A targeted survey was conducted in August 2022 to collect updated information on the fishery.  The survey utilized 15 standard gill nets and one special deep-water gill net targeting Tullibee. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike were the most common fish in the gill-net sample.  The catch rate was considered average for the lake and comparable to similar type lakes.  Pike ranged from 14.3 to 32.9 inches with an average length of 22.1 inches.  Size structure was moderate, with 7% of the sample exceeding 28 inches.  Seven year classes (ages 2-7) were represented in the sample, with age 3 fish the most frequently sampled.  Growth was considered average with pike averaging 25.8 inches after five years.  Ball Club Lake provides good opportunities to catch small to medium-sized pike with an occasional chance at fish exceeding 28 inches. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye catch rates on Ball Club have typically been low compared to similar lakes.  In 2022, Walleye were sampled at a catch rate of 2.4/gill net.  This catch was below average compared to lakes with similar habitat but typical for Ball Club.  Extremely high water levels during the time of the survey may also have affected the catch rate.  Size structure was good; sampled Walleye ranged from 10 to 26 inches with a mean length of 17.5 inches.  Twenty-three percent of the sample exceeded 20 inches.  Nine year classes (ages 2-10) were identified, with 34% of the sample belonging to the 2018 year class (age 4).  The contribution of stocking to the population was difficult to evaluate since eight of the previous 10 years were stocked with either fry or fingerlings.  Growth was considered average.  Walleye averaged 17.8 inches after five years of growth.  Angler reports suggest Ball Club Lake provides fair fishing opportunities for Walleye. <br> \n <br> \nThe Yellow Perch gill-net catch rate was relatively low compared to similar lakes, but similar to the previous survey on Ball Club.  Extremely high water levels were present during the two most recent surveys which may have negatively affected the catches.  Perch were generally too small to be of interest to anglers, ranging from 5.2 to 10.5 inches with an average length of 6.4 inches. <br> \n <br> \nThe special deep-water gill net captured 57 Tullibee, suggesting an abundant population.  Sampled Tullibee ranged from 6.5 to 12.6 inches, with an average length of 8.9 inches.  A majority (82%) of fish were infested with the parasite Whitefish Grub (Triaenophorus).  Tullibee are an important prey species for predators like Northern Pike and Walleye. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled in this survey included Black Crappie, Rock Bass and White Sucker. <br> \n <br> \nZebra Mussels, an exotic species, are present in Ball Club Lake and the connecting Mississippi River.  Zebra Mussels are effective filter feeders and contribute to notably increased water clarity.  Anglers and boaters are reminded to help stop the spread of invasive species by removing all aquatic plants from boats, trailers, and equipment. All drain plugs must be removed and live and bait wells must be drained before leaving the access. Anglers and boaters are encouraged to power wash and thoroughly dry all equipment prior to use in another water body. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Ball Club Lake is a lake class 22 lake located in the Mississippi River watershed and the Chippewa National Forest.  Class 22 lakes are relatively large, deep, and have moderate water clarity.  Ball Club Lake has a surface area of 3,936 acres and a maximum depth of 85 feet.  Ball Club Lake is managed primarily for walleye, northern pike and black crappie.  In addition to regular assessments of the fish population, management includes stocking of walleye and whitefish (by the Leech Lake Indian Reservation, Division of Resource Management). <br> \n <br> \nThe walleye gill-net catch rate in the 2007 survey was 3.7/net.  This catch rate is slightly below the lake class normal range, but similar to the long-term average for Ball Club Lake and up substantially from the previous assessment (1.1/net).   Sampled walleye ranged from 8.9 to 22.4 inches, with an average length of 14.8 inches and an average weight of 1.3 pounds.  Ages 1-6 were represented in the sample, with 80% of the fish corresponding to stocked year classes.  Growth was similar to the statewide average for all ages. <br> \n <br> \nThe northern pike gill-net catch rate was 12.5/net, above the lake class normal range and the highest catch on record for Ball Club Lake.  Sampled pike ranged from 12.7 to 31.6 inches, with an average length of 19.7 inches and an average weight of 1.8 pounds.  Ages 1-7 were represented in the sample and growth was similar to the statewide average. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch and tullibee, important prey species for walleye and northern pike, were both sampled at rates within their expected ranges.  Yellow perch were sampled at 9.8/gill net and ranged from 4.1 to 12.5 inches, with an average length of 7.3 inches.  Tullibee were sampled at 1.4/gill net and ranged from 8.5 to 13.4 inches, with an average length of 10.9 inches.  No lake whitefish were sampled in the most recent survey, although a population of them is known to exist in the lake. <br> \n <br> \nNet catches for black crappie and bluegill have generally been low in all assessments.  In the 2007 survey, black crappie were caught at a rate within the expected range and ranged from 4.4 to 13.0 inches with an average length of 7.8 inches.  The 2005 year class made up 78% of the sample.  Growth of black crappie was similar to the statewide average.  The trap net catch for bluegill (0.7/net) was below the expected range but higher than previous assessments.  Sampled bluegill ranged from 3.4 to 8.6 inches, with an average length of 7.2 inches.  Ages 1-5 were represented and bluegill growth was faster than the lake class average. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled included banded killifish, bowfin, brown bullhead, burbot, hybrid sunfish, pumpkinseed sunfish, Johnny darter, largemouth bass, rock bass and white sucker.  <br> \n <br> \nBecause land use practices near the lake often have the most impact on water quality, lakeshore owners should consider following best management practices when managing their shoreline.  Maintaining natural vegetation buffers or restoring such natural buffers along the shoreline reduces erosion, maintains the aesthetic beauty of the lake and filters nutrients from reaching the water.  Aquatic vegetation, especially emergent vegetation like bulrush, protects shorelines from wave action, filters nutrients from the water, and provides habitat for fish and wildlife.  Not fertilizing lawns or using non-phosphorus fertilizers along with maintaining functional septic systems (including regular pumping) helps keep the lake healthy.  <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Ball Club Lake is a relatively large lake which appears to receive light to moderate fishing pressure.  The walleye population appears to be about average for this type of lake.  The walleyes sampled in this assessment ranged from 9.5 to 22 inches in length and averaged 1.5 pounds.  Although Ball Club Lake is stocked on a regular basis, it is difficult to say how much the stocking contributes to the population.  In fact, in the two years of the last seven that the lake wasn't stocked there appears to be almost no reduction in numbers of fish.  This suggests that a large part of the walleye population may be the result of natural reproduction.          Northern pike abundance also appears to be average for this type of lake.  Most of the northern pike appeared to be in good condition.  The largest northern pike that was sampled was 31 inches long and the average length was 20.8 inches.  The average weight was 2.4 pounds.       Black crappies were not found in great numbers, but the gear used to sample them isn't always effective so it is difficult to determine their actual abundance.  The crappies that were sampled averaged 10.0 inches in length.       There are very few bluegills in Ball Club Lake.  Yellow perch and tullibee abundance is good.  In addition, it has been reported that Ball Club Lake has a strong whitefish population.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Ball Club Lake is a large, mesotrophic lake near Ball Club, Minnesota.  The lake is in ecological lake class 22 and is in the Mississippi River watershed.  Ball Club Lake has a surface area of 3,936 acres, a littoral area of 984 acres, a maximum depth of 85 feet and a Secchi transparency of 11.5 feet (average from 2008 MN PCA data).  There are four inlets to Ball Club Lake and its outlet is the Ball Club River, which flows to the Mississippi River. <br> \n <br> \nThe fisheries lake management plan (LMP) was last revised in 2008.  Walleye and Northern Pike were the primary management species and Lake Whitefish and Black Crappie were secondary species.  Long range goals were to  increase the Walleye gill net catch to 4.0 per net; maintain a Northern Pike fishery with a gill net catch of 6.0 per net and maintain a crappie catch of 1.0 per trap net.  The Leech Lake Division of Resource Management stocked Walleye fry in alternate years and excess Walleye fry produced by the Grand Rapids hatchery from the Cut Foot Sioux egg take were stocked when available. The Leech Lake Division of Resource Management also stocked Lake Whitefish fingerlings on an annual basis. <br> \n <br> \nA population assessment was conducted in August of 2014 to evaluate the status of the fish community.  This assessment consisted of 15 standard gill nets, 1 special deep water gill net targeting Tullibee, and 15 trap nets.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike were the most common fish in the gill net sample.  The catch was within the typical range for similar lakes, typical for Ball Club Lake, and met the 2008 LMP goal.  Past sampling has typically resulted in a moderate to poor size structure.  Length in 2014 ranged from 13.5 to 29.5 inches and averaged 21.3 inches.  Seven year classes were present (ages 1-6 and 8) and recruitment appeared consistent.  Growth was near the statewide average as pike averaged nearly 24 inches by age 6.   <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch were captured at low rate compared to similar lakes and the lowest catch reported for Ball Club Lake.  Perch abundance appears to have declined.  Perch catch averaged 31.2 per gill net in the four assessments from 1978 to 1993 but have steadily declined, averaging only 10.6 per net in the last three assessments.  Perch were generally too small to interest anglers as length ranged from 5.0 to 11.6 inches and averaged 6.8 inches.  Perch are an important prey species and declining perch abundance may impact Walleye abundance. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye were captured at a low rate compared to similar lakes and below average for Ball Club.  It should be noted that gill net catches from Ball Club has typically been near low compared to lakes with similar habitats.  Walleye length ranged from 8.0 to 23.2 inches and averaged 13.6 inches.  Walleye populations often exhibit irregular recruitment, resulting in dominant year classes, shifting age and size structures, which may result in inconsistent angler success.  Age analysis identified 7 year classes (age 1-7) and 40% of the sample belonged to the 2011 year class.  Interestingly, 2011 was the only year in which fry were not stocked.  Growth was near the statewide average for ages 1-5 as Walleye averaged 18.8 inches by age 5. <br> \n <br> \nThe Tullibee is an important prey species associated with the production of large predators, such as Northern Pike.  Tullibees are often difficult to sample because of their pelagic habitat preference.  A special deep water gill net resulted in 64 Tullibee, suggesting good abundance.  Captured Tullibee ranged from 8.0 to 14.6 inches and averaged 10.2 inches in length.  Past samples documented the presence of the tapeworm, Triaenophorus.  Tapeworms were common in Tullibee in the 2014 sample and was detected in 83% of sampled fish. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappies were captured at typical rate for the lake type.  The crappie population exhibited a quality size structure, as crappie ranged from 6.5 to 13.6 inches and averaged 8.9 inches.  Black Cappie populations often exhibit irregular recruitment resulting in dominant year classes, shifting age and size structures, and inconsistent angler success.  Only four year classes were present, indicating inconsistent recruitment.  Growth was fast as crappie typically exceeded 12 inches by age 6.   <br> \n <br> \nOther species captured included Bluegill, Bowfin, Rock Bass, and White Sucker. <br> \n <br> \nBall Club supports invasive purple loosestrife.  Anglers and boaters are reminded to help stop the spread of invasive species by removing all aquatic plants from boats, trailers, and equipment.  All drain plugs must be removed and live and bait wells must be drained before leaving the access.  Anglers and boaters are encouraged to power wash and thoroughly dry all equipment prior to use in another water body.    <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Ball Club Lake is managed primarily for walleye, northern pike and crappie.  In addition to regular assessments of the fish population, management includes stocking of whitefish and walleye (by the Leech Lake Indian Reservation).     The walleye gill net catch rate is below the expected range for this type of lake.  However, on most lakes, gill nets are placed perpendicular to shore to capture fish following contours.  Because of the steepness of the drop-off in Ball Club Lake, nets must be set parallel to shore which may result in a lower percentage of the fish encountering the nets.  Walleye sampled in gill nets ranged from 11.5 to 23.1 inches in length and had a mean length of 16.1 inches and a mean weight of 1.5 pounds.  Anglers encountered during the assessment reported fair to good walleye fishing.  Growth of walleye appears to be good.     Northern pike were sampled in gill nets at a rate above the expected range for this type of lake.  They ranged from 10.6 to 35.3 inches in length and had a mean length of 19.1 inches and a mean weight of 1.7 pounds.     Yellow perch, which are an important prey species for walleye and northern pike, were sampled at a rate in the gill nets that was within the expected range.  They ranged from 5.0 to 11.5 inches in length and had a mean length of 7.5 inches.     Only two black crappie were sampled in gill nets, but the trap net catch rate was within the expected range.  Crappies in the trap nets ranged from 7.9 to 11.1 inches in length and had a mean length of 9.2 inches.  They appear to grow at average, to above average rates.  Anglers encountered during the assessment reported crappie fishing had been good this year, with some large crappie being caught.     Tullibee, an important prey species for producing large northern pike and walleye, were sampled at a rate within the expected range.     Although only one bluegill was sampled, pumpkinseed and hybrid sunfish were also captured.     Other species sampled include: bowfin, black bullhead, rock bass, whitefish and white sucker. </p>",

Number of whitefish netted has decreased the past four years at a noticeable rate.  Walleye population is just above the local and state medians.  The lake has a very large perch (yellow) population that runs over the state and local medians.  The populations that run below the state and local medians are the bluegill, pumpkinseed and crappie.  The validity of the trap nets is questionable, due to the areas in which they were set.  (Because of the contour of the lake.)</p>",
