                "narrative": "<p>Takucmich Lake is in Ecological Lake Class 3, which consists of 72 lakes in northeast Minnesota that are deep and have steep shorelines, have irregular shoreline shapes, and have clear and soft (unmineralized) water.  Takucmich Lake is typical of these lakes except that it is deeper (150 ft) than the lake class average of 77 ft.Takucmich Lake was thermally stratified on 9/1/99 and retained good oxygen for lake trout (more than 5 ppm) to a depth of 110 ft, where the temperature was 39 F.  Inlets are from Tesoker and Trillium lakes and the outlet is to Lac La Croix.  Lake bottom substrates along the shoreline are mostly boulder and rock, with small amounts of sand, gravel, and muck.  Aquatic plants are sparse and grow to a depth of 20 ft.This fish population assessment consisted of four shallow gillnets set in depths of 21 ft or shallower (64 F or warmer) and nine deep gillnets set in depths of 30 ft or greater (47 F or colder).  Previous investigations consisted of shallow-to-deep gillnets set through the thermocline in 1966 and 1974, deep-only gillnets in 1979, and separate deep and shallow nets in 1986.The total catch of fish in the shallow gillnets in 1999 of 7 fish/net (1 lb/net) was lower than normal for this lake class and was similar in numbers, but lower in weight than previous investigations in this lake.  Shallow water fish populations in 1999 were dominated by rock bass.  Rock bass numbers in 1999 (6/net) were higher than normal for this lake class and were higher than previous catches.  No northern pike were captured in 1999, down from an average catch of 4/net in previous investigations.  White sucker numbers in 1999 (0.2/net) were down from an average catch of 4/net in previous investigations.The total catch of fish in the deep gillnets in 1999 of 18 fish/net (8 lb/net) was similar to previous catches of 15/net (8 lb/net) in 1979 and 23 fish/net (10 lb/net) in 1986.  Deep water fish populations in 1999 were dominated by cisco.Cisco numbers in 1999 (16/net) were similar to previous catches of 13/net in 1979 and 19/net in 1986.  Cisco sizes in 1999 averaged 9\"; the largest was 13.3\".Lake trout numbers in 1999 (0.9/net) were lower than previous catches of 2.0/net in 1979 and 2.6/net in 1986.  Lake trout sizes in 1999 averaged 19\"; the largest was 29.2\" (9.2 lb).  Lake trout ages appeared to range from five to twelve, although their otoliths (ear bones) were difficult to read.  Many of the lake trout had roundworms in their air bladders.  Low levels of PCB's and moderate levels of mercury were found in lake trout collected during this assessment.Burbot numbers in 1999 (1.3/net) were similar to previous catches of 0.6/net in 1979 and 1.4/net in 1986.  Burbot sizes in 1999 averaged 16\"; the largest was 21.5\".</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Takucmich Lake is located within the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness (BWCAW) within the Superior National Forest and is a non-motorized lake.  It is in the far northwest corner of the Tower Fisheries Management Area and has four access locations, all via portage from surrounding lakes.  It has a maximum depth of 150 feet, soft nutrient poor water, and is very clear.  \n\nTakucmich Lake was thermally stratified on August 13, 2013 with a surface temperature of 68 F and a bottom temperature of 40 F.  Oxygen levels peaked at 12.1 ppm at 21 feet and were still at 3.3 ppm at 130 feet.  Inlets are from Tesaker and Trillium Lakes and the only outlet is to Lac La Croix.  Shoreline substrates are mostly ledgerock and boulder with some areas of sand, gravel, and muck.  Aquatic plants are very sparse.\n\nThis fish population assessment consisted of six shallow gillnet sets ranging from 7 to 22 feet of water and nine deep gillnet sets ranging from 30 to 122 feet.  Trapnets have never been used due to the difficult portage access.\n\nThe total catch rate of all fish in the shallow gillnets in 2013 was 8 fish/net, similar to past surveys.  The catches were dominated by rock bass (52%) and northern pike (23%).  Additional species sampled at low levels were lake trout, pumpkinseed, smallmouth bass, tullibee, and yellow perch.  Notably, white suckers were the most prevalent species in the shallow water nets from the 1986 survey at 64% of the catch, only one was sampled in 1999, and none were sampled in 2013.  \n\nThe rock bass catch rate of 4 fish/net was similar to the last survey in 1999 but an increase from 1 fish/net in 1986.  The northern pike catch rate has increased since the last two surveys.  Growth rates for pike were near the average for all lakes in the Tower Fisheries Management Area and fish up to age nine were sampled.  \n\nThe total catch of all fish in the deep gillnets in 2013 was 8.2 fish/net.  This is much lower than the previous two assessments and mostly due to a lower tullibee catch rate.  Catches consisted of tullibee (55%), lake trout (24%), burbot (16%), and smallmouth bass (5%).  \n\nThe tullibee catch rate of 4.4 fish/net was much lower than in the previous three investigations of 13 to 9 fish/net.  \n\nLake trout catch rates have stayed fairly constant throughout the past four investigations.  Catches have ranged from 1 to 2 fish/net.  Sizes ranged from 9 to 29 inches and the average was 19.5 inches in 2013.  Lake trout ages range from 5 to over 15 years.  The population was dominated by older fish. Over half were 15 years of age or older.  \n\nThe burbot catch rate over the past four investigations has ranged from 0.6 to 1.4 fish/net since 1979.  Sizes ranged from 14 to 22 inches with an average of 18 inches.  \n\nSmallmouth bass were sampled for the first time in deep-water gillnets (0.4 fish/net) and were of decent sizes.  The four fish captured ranged from 15 to 19 inches.  These fish came from the 2003 and 2005 year classes.  \n</p>",
