                "narrative": "<p>Laura Lake is a 22-acre impoundment which is managed primarily for largemouth bass.  Largemouth were stocked only in 1979 upon completion of the dam.  Largemouth bass reproduce naturally in Laura Lake, and the current population appears to be healthy.  Bass collected in our sampling gear ranged in length from 3 ? to 20 inches with an average of 10 inches.  The key to maintain a good population of largemouth bass is to preserve the current water quality in Laura Lake.  Water degradation could ultimately reduce the existing amount of submerged vegetation which is essential habitat for largemouth bass.  A fair amount of sediment input in Laura Lake has  already accumulated in the upper reaches of the lake.  The black crappie population in Laura Lake increased since our last survey conducted in 1991.  Currently, the population is considered high compared to similar lakes in our area.  The majority of black crappie collected in our sampling gear were between 4 and 6 inches.  Although the black crappie population is dominated by small fish, these fish should grow and provide anglers with good numbers of quality size fish in following years.  Black crappie were last stocked in 1984.Although the yellow perch numbers decreased since our last survey, the population is considered high compared to similar lakes in our area.  Yellow perch ranged in length from 5 to 9 ? inches with an average of 6 ? inches.  Yellow perch were not officially stocked in Laura Lake.Laura lake has historically supported high populations of black bullhead.  Currently, the population remains high compared to similar lakes in our area.  Bullhead ranged in length from 5 ? to 12 inches with an average of 8 ? inches. To promote and maintain a healthy fish population, pollution and other inputs need to be controlled.  Fish habitat is directly affected by water quality.  Nutrient, sediment and other waste inputs can drastically alter the chemical and physical components of a Lake.  It is paramount to maintain if not improve the current water quality of Laura Lake through watershed management to preserve this fishery for future generations to enjoy.   </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Laura Lake is a 22-acre reservoir that is managed primarily for largemouth bass and for secondary populations of black crappie and yellow perch.  Laura Lake was impounded in 1978 for flood control and was reported to have a maximum depth of 21.0 feet.  During the survey in 1999, our data indicated a maximum depth of 16.0 feet near the outlet.  The tendency for reservoirs to fill with silt is common in the highly agricultural areas of the Midwest.The average largemouth bass electrofishing catch rate was 16.50 fish/hour.  Thirty-three largemouth bass were sampled and had total lengths ranging between 6.3 and 19.9 inches, with an average of 14.9.  The average largemouth bass electrofishing CPUE was 33.43 fish/hour in 1995 and an average length of 9.8 inches.  Most of the fish sampled in 1999 were in the 15.0 to 17.0 inch range which would be appealing to most anglers.  The largemouth bass aged from scales show an average growth of approximately three inches per year.  Largemouth bass haven't been stocked by the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources since 1979.  Based on visual observations at the time of trap and gill netting, aquatic vegetation was visibly dense and numerous fingerling largemouth bass were observed which indicates natural reproduction was probably successful in 1999.The black crappie trap net catch rate was 10.00 fish/net set which was more than two times the upper  range for this type of lake.  Historically, the average black crappie trap net catch rate has ranged between 3.67 and 23.00 fish/net set.  Total lengths of black crappie sampled in trap nets ranged between 4.9 and 8.4 inches, with an average of 6.0.  Black crappie have not been stocked since 1984.  Black crappie populations quite often cycle in the prairie pothole region so enjoy the fishery now because the population is on the higher side of the cycle.  The yellow perch trap net catch rate was 12.00 fish/net set which was more than three times the upper normal range for this type of lake.  The yellow perch trap net catch rate was 6.40 fish/net set in 1995 and 39.67 fish/net set in 1991.  Total lengths of yellow perch sampled in trap nets ranged between 5.3 and 7.3 inches, with an average of 6.0.  Yellow perch have never been stocked in Laura Lake by the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources.  The yellow perch numbers are higher than expected but the fish tend to be small.The bluegill trap net catch rate was 3.00 fish/net set which was close to the lower range for this type of lake.  The average bluegill trap net catch rate has been historically low except for the survey conducted the year following impoundment of the lake.  Reservoirs typically have exceptional production initially after creation.  Total lengths of bluegill sampled in trap nets ranged between 7.8 and 8.3 inches, with an average of 8.0.  These bluegill will likely make some anglers happy.No black bullheads were sampled in trap nets in 1999.  The black bullhead gill net catch rate was 7.00 fish/net set which was higher than the 50% quartile (5.00 fish/net set) for this lake class.  The catch rate for black bullhead was at an all-time low based on historical surveys.  Total lengths of black bullhead sampled in the gill nets ranged between 5.4 and 9.6 inches, with an average of 8.5.  No common carp have ever been sampled in Laura Lake since impoundment.  These low catch rates of both black bullhead and common carp are rare occurrence in the prairie pothole region.To promote and maintain healthy fish populations, pollution and other inputs need to be controlled.  Fish habitats are directly affected by water quality.  Nutrient, sediment and other waste inputs can drastically alter the biological, chemical, and physical components of a lake.  It is paramount to maintain if not improve the current water quality of Laura Lake through watershed management to preserve this fishery for future generations to enjoy.   </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Laura is a picturesque 22-acre reservoir just outside the city of Walnut Grove in Redwood County.  The reservoir has a maximum depth of 21 feet, a shoreline length of 1.8 miles, and is a class 33 lake.  Laura has shoreline access through a Redwood County Park.  Boat access is by portage only.  The lake is managed for largemouth bass primarily while black crappie and yellow perch are managed secondarily. <br> \n <br> \nThe largemouth bass population is doing well in Laura Lake.  Spring electrofishing for largemouth bass resulted in a catch rate of 13.6 fish per hour.  The electrofishing catch rate in 1999 was 16.5 fish per hour.  Lengths of largemouth bass sampled electrofishing ranged from 4 to just over 18 inches and averaged just over 11 inches.  Six ages of largemouth bass from age 1 to age 8 were observed during the assessment indicating good natural reproduction. <br> \n <br> \nThe black crappie population is high when compared to other lakes like Laura.  Lengths of black crappie caught in trap nets ranged from 4 to 8 inches and averaged just under 6 inches.  Five ages of black crappie from 2001 through 2005 were observed during the assessment indicating good natural reproduction.  <br> \n <br> \nThe yellow perch population is also high compared to other lakes like Laura.  The yellow perch gill net catch rate was 27 in 2006 compared to 19 in 1999.  Lengths of yellow perch caught in gill nets averaged just under 7 inches.    Three different ages of yellow perch were observed, however the majority of fish were age three. <br> \n <br> \nIf its large northern pike youre after, you may want to give Laura a try.  Lengths of northern pike caught in our gill nets ranged from 23 to 34 inches and averaged just over 28 inches.  Lengths of northern pike caught in trap nets ranged from 31 to 40 inches and averaged just under 34 inches.  Four ages from 1999 through 2002 were observed during the assessment.  The 40-inch northern pike was not aged. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill numbers were low when compared to other lakes like Laura.  Lengths of bluegill caught in our trap nets ranged from 3.5 to 7.5 inches and averaged about 5.5 inches.  The bluegill trap net CPUE of 2.20 was below the interquartile range of 2.92 to 41.19.  Three different ages were observed during the assessment. <br> \n <br> \nOther fish caught in our nets included pumpkinseed, white sucker, yellow bullhead, and common carp. <br> \n <br> \nTo maintain a healthy fishery in Laura Lake, we need to promote Best Management Practices (BMPs) within the watershed to help reduce nutrients entering the lake.  High nutrients and sediments in a lake can cause algae blooms and reduce water clarity. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>INTRODUCTION <br> \n <br> \nLaura Lake is a 22-acre reservoir 1 mile southwest of Walnut Grove in Redwood County.  The reservoir has a maximum depth of 21 feet, a shoreline length of 1.8 miles, and is a DNR class 33 lake based on physical and chemical characteristics.  Laura Lake has shoreline access through a Redwood County Park.  Boat access is by portage only with non-gas powered boats only.   The lake is managed for largemouth bass, black crappie, and yellow perch. <br> \n <br> \nLARGEMOUTH BASS <br> \n <br> \nThe largemouth bass were introduced shortly after construction of the reservoir with the first and only stocking in 1979. Since 1979 the population has maintained itself naturally.  Largemouth bass are best assessed with the use of spring electrofishing to capture the fish as they prepare to spawn or have just finished spawning.  In June 26 largemouth bass were caught in just over an hour of electrofishing.  The length of largemouth bass captured ranged from 4 to 19 inches with an average size of 13 inches.  The wide range of fish sampled coupled with the presence of 7 age groups of fish indicates a population that is successfully sustaining itself.  Additionally, the health of the largemouth bass population is above average compared to other populations in other lakes.  The Largemouth bass population in Laura Lake currently exceeds the management goals set by the DNR (20 fish per hour of electrofishing).   Local bass anglers particularly shore, canoe, and kayak anglers should consider Laura Lake as a fishing destination.  Some large fish can be caught!   <br> \n <br> \nBLACK CRAPPIE <br> \n <br> \nThe black crappie population in Laura Lake has been on the rise since the early 1990's.  The current catch rates are the highest on record with 42 fish in the gill net and an average of 33.5 fish in each trap net.  The crappie ranged in length from 4 inches to 8 inches with an average length of 6 inches in the gill net and trap nets.   The high catch rate in 2012 combined with healthy and plump fish gives evidence that the population will sustain itself at or near these levels for several years.  Larger fish will become more common over the next 2 to 3 years as the youngest and most abundant crappie grow.  <br> \n <br> \nYELLOW PERCH <br> \n <br> \nThe yellow perch catch rate in 2012 was 31 fish per gill net and 3 fish per trap.  The historical catch rate indicates that yellow perch abundance was highest in the early 1990s.  This was then followed by catch rates just above or equal to the upper normal range of 19 fish per gill net and 4 fish per trap net, except for the 2006 trap net catch rate of 1.4 which was just average.  The current yellow perch population abundance appears to have reached equilibrium as the catch rates have not changed substantially since the 1999 survey.  Yellow perch in the 2012 sample ranged from 5 to 8 inches with an average length of 7 inches.  The population is dominated by 1 age group of fish and the population is dominated by smaller fish.  The overall average health of the yellow perch was average indicating no unusual stressors.  Overall, the yellow perch population is sustaining itself and the size structure appears to provide a good forage base for the northern pike and largemouth bass in the lake.   <br> \n <br> \nBLUEGILL <br> \n <br> \nThe bluegill population in Laura Lake used to be included as a managed species up until 2006. Stocking to boost the population in the early 1990's did not work due to poor spawning habitat, poor water quality, and competition with other species.  Surprisingly, in 2012 the bluegill catch rate was near 9 fish per trap net which is the second highest net catch rate since DNR sampling began in the late 1980's.  Bluegill ranged in length from 4 to 7 inches with an average length of 5 inches.  The bluegill population is sustaining itself at a low abundance, but it appears every so often that Laura Lake contains good numbers of bluegill when conditions are right for bluegill to do well.   <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nOTHER SPECIES <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled in Laura Lake during August were black bullhead,  common carp, hybrid sunfish, northern pike, pumpkinseed sunfish, white crappie, white sucker, and yellow bullhead.   <br> \n <br> \nSUMMARY <br> \n <br> \nOverall, Laura Lake appears to contain healthy numbers of catchable size largemouth bass, black crappie, and yellow perch.  Also, an emerging bluegill population will add a species to angler's creel over the next 2 to 3 years.  Laura Lake would benefit from increased conservation of land in the watershed area.  Improvements in the watershed will directly improve oxygen levels in the lake for species such as northern pike, bluegill, and bait fish as well as giving Laura Lake a potential to support walleye if stocked.  At this point walleye cannot be recommended as a managed species by the DNR due to poor oxygen levels in the lower depths that walleye would need to survive.  In the time being, Laura Lake will continue to sustain a robust population of largemouth bass and should be a destination for shore, canoe, and kayak bass anglers in southwestern Minnesota.  Good luck fishing!  <br> \n <br> \nPrepared by Nate Hodgins <br> \n</p>",

IN THE 1987 SURVEY, 7 PIKE WERE CAPTURED, INCLUDING AGE 1+ AND 2+ FISH, AND FISHING WAS REPORTED AS QUITE GOOD AND IMPROVING.  THIS YEAR ONLY 3 PIKE WERE CAUGHT, WITH NO FISH LESS THAN 4+. REPRODUCTION IN THIS LAKE MAY BE SUFFERING DUE TO LOW WATER FOR THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS.  BLC NUMBERS ARE CLOSE TO LOCAL MEDIANS.  MANY YOU BLC WERE ELECTROFISHED IN THE FALL.  PASSIVE NETS COLLECTED 1+ AND 2+ AGED FISH AS WELL AS SOME ADULTS CLOSE TO 11 INCHES LONG.  CRAPPIE FISHING IS GOOD TO EXCELLENT, DEPENDING ON SEASON, AND THE POPULATION APPEARS TO BE HOLDING ITS OWN.  PMK AGE STRUCTURE ALSO SUGGESTS A HEALTHY POPULATION WITH GOOD RECRUITMENT, ALTHOUGH NO FISH EXCEEDED 6 INCHES. BLG, HOWEVER, SHOW SPOTTY REPRODUCTION WITH SEVERAL MISSING YEAR CLASSES.  LMB WERE ELECTRO- FISHED AT 19.5 FISH PER HOUR (7.8 LBS/HR).  MANY OF THESE FISH WERE YOY. 1+, 2+ AND SEVERAL LARGER ADULTS WERE ALSO SAMPLED.  BASS REPRODUCTION APPEARS QUITE SUCCESSFUL IN RECENT YEARS.  IF GOOD RECRUITMENT CONTINUES, THIS LAKE COULD BECOME A REASONABLE BASS FISHERY.  LACK OF COVER ALONG THE LAKESHORE MAY BECOME A LIMITING FACTOR FOR THIS SPECIES.  YEP ARE EXTREMELY ABUNDANT, WITH 7 TIMES THE LOCAL MEDIAN IN GILLNETS, AND 30 TIMES THE LOCAL MEDIAN IN TRAPNETS.  THE FISH ARE SMALL, HOWEVER, WITH ABOUT 85% BEING LESS THAN 7 INCHES LONG.  IF LMB ARE UNABLE TO CONTROL THE PERCH, LIMITED NUMBERS OF AN ALTERNATIVE PREDATOR MIGHT BE CONSIDERED.  PIKE MIGHT BE EFFECTIVE.  IF PIKE REPRODUCTION REMAINS POOR, THE LAKE COULD BE MANAGED WITH LMB AS A PRIMARY SPECIES, USING PIKE TO TEMPORARILY CONTROL OUTBREAKS OF YEP.  AT THE SAME TIME, LMB MAY PREVENT THE BLB POPULATION FROM INCREASING TO THE POINT OF STUNTING.  AT THE TIME OF THIS SURVEY, THE BULLHEAD CPUE WAS CLOSE TO THE LOCAL MEDIAN IN GILLNETS, AND WELL BELOW THE MEDIAN IN TRAPNETS.</p>",
