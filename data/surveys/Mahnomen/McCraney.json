Growth rates for the species examined (walleyes, northern pike, and pumpkinseeds) were above the statewide average.  This apparent high productivity of McCraney Lake can be attributed to the shape of the basin which provides a large littoral area where most fish-food organisms are produced.Spawning conditions are considered to be good for northern pike, walleyes, and centrarchids, and examination of the length and age-frequency distributions indicates consistent successful natural reproduction for most species with the notable exceptions of bluegills and black crappies.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>McMraney Lake is a small lake that is lightly developed, has good water quality, and a variety of fish species.  The White Earth river traverses the lake from northeast to southwest.  Northern pike, largemouth bass, walleye, black crappie, and bluegill create a variety of opportunities for the angler.  An abundance of yellow perch provide an ample food source for the large predator fish like northern pike.  Northern pike have historically been a significant part of the fishery.  Current test net results shows northern pike abundance to be in the normal range for lakes of this ecological type.  It also indicates that northern pike are growing at a rate that is above average.  The fast growth rate is likely due to the abundance of yellow perch and tullibee that pike feed on.  Additionally, the presence of tullibee indicates that summertime oxygen levels are good in the cooler zones of the lake.  Cool, oxygenated water is considered a requirement for growing large pike.Summer test nets do not sample largemouth bass or black crappie very effectively but it appears that both species are present in good numbers.  Test nets did sample a large number of one year old bass that should provide good angling in a few years.  Anglers periodically report good catches of black crappies.Lakes of this ecological type are better suited for northern pike and largemouth bass than for walleye.  However, a combination of sporadic natural reproduction and biennial fingerling stocking has produced a modest walleye population in McCraney Lake.  The population has fluctuated from time to time but generally remains in the normal range for lakes of this type.  As in many area lakes, spring and early summer are rumored by anglers to be the only time to catch any number of walleye in McCraney Lake.Bluegill, after many years of very low test net catches, appear to have significantly increased in abundance in recent years.  Trapnet catches increased from 3 per trapnet in 1990 to 33 per trapnet in 1995.  The current level of abundance is in the normal range for a lake of this type.  Bluegill ranged up to 9 inches in length with the average length equal to 6.8 inches.McCraney Lake's angling variety, good water quality, and undeveloped shoreline make it attractive to the outdoor recreationalist.  Future development on the lake should try to minimize shoreline alterations and protect bulrushes or other aquatic vegetation that make the lake what it is.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>McCraney Lake has a diverse fish community that is typical of other ecologically similar lakes in Minnesota.  Northern pike are abundant, but small.  They average about a pound and a half and 19.4 inches in length with very few over 24 inches.  Growth rates remain good and it is likely that anglers are harvesting most pike by the time they reach about two or three pounds.  Pike over thirty inches have been found during about half of the past studies, but none were sampled in 2003.Good walleye spawning habitat is lacking in this lake and the walleye population is sustained by stocking.  Sampled walleyes averaged just under 15 inches and weighed about a pound and a quarter.Yellow perch catches decreased dramatically since 1995.  Since perch are the primary forage of not only northern pike and walleye, but also largemouth bass in many Minnesota lakes, it is hoped that their decline will not hurt growth rates of the larger predator fish.  This will be monitored in future surveys.Bluegill, black crappie, largemouth bass, and tullibee (cisco) can also be found in McCraney Lake.  Sampled bluegills were generally young (two years) and small (5.4 inches average length).  Bluegills exhibit good growth rates in McCraney and have the potential to grow larger than nine inches if not harvested before reaching that length.</p>",

The walleye gillnet catch rate has increased substantially from the 1985 survey but still remains below the local median.  It appears from age distribution of walleyes that the population is comprised largely of stocked fingerlings nad natural reproduction is contributing little.  Both walleyes and northern pike exhibit normal growth rates.  A historically abundant yellow perch population is currently four times the local median.  An abundance of pumpkinseeds and green sunfish is perhaps inhibiting the establishment of a good bluegill population.  Bluegills have consistently been far below the local median.</p>",
