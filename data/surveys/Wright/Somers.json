                "narrative": "<p>Mink and Somers Lakes are located in Wright County near the town of Maple Lake.  The lakes are connected via a navigable channel and a public access is located on the east side of Mink Lake. Both lakes were reclaimed with rotenone in 1994 to eliminate large populations of carp and bullheads, then restocked.  Current special regulations include bag limits of five sunfish, five crappie, ten yellow perch, two walleye and one largemouth bass less than 12 inches.  Northern pike from 24 to 36 inches must be released (three may be harvested, with only one over 36 inches allowed).  The use of live minnows is prohibited.  A partial winterkill occurred in 2001 and aeration systems will be deployed as needed in the future to prevent winterkill.Seven walleye were netted in 2003, but more extensive netting in 2001 had catch rates above the expected range for lakes similar to Mink and Somers. The walleye population is sustained by stocking, and fry are currently stocked every other year.  Fry stocking in 2001 was successful and these walleye were 11 to 12 inches long in 2002 and 12 to 14 inches by the spring of 2003.  Walleye captured in fall trap nets in 2003 averaged 17.5 inches in length.Largemouth bass catch rates during spring electrofishing increased compared to 2002 and were well above average for the area.  This increase was due to the catch of large numbers of 8 to 10 inch fish from the 2000 year class that are now large enough to be sampled by our electrofishing gear.  The largest individual captured was 20 inches.  The maximum length of bass has been increasing and growth rates are high.  The new largemouth bass regulation allows harvest of smaller fish, while retaining larger bass in the population.Bluegill catch rates in 2003 did not change from 2002 and the average size is larger than expected for lakes similar to Mink and Somers.  Half of the bluegill sampled were over 8 inches in length and grew quickly.  The largest individuals were 9 inches.  Black crappie numbers were in the expected range for these lakes and include both a strong 2001 year class (6 to 8 inches) and a few fish from the 1996 year classes (12 inches).  Twenty three northern pike were captured, ranging in size from 7 to 28 inches.  Most fish sampled were over 21 inches.  The new protected slot limit and abundant forage may provide a trophy pike fishery in the future.  Carp have become re-established in the lakes and were caught at expected rates in 2003.  Most fish come from one year class and it remains to be seen whether carp will reach nuisance levels, as they did prior to the reclamation.A winter angler survey in 2002 found that both angler success and satisfaction with the fishery were high, and a new regulation allows limited bass harvest in response to angler feedback. Overall, the special regulations seem to be successful at maintaining a high quality, multi-species fishery by limiting harvest.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Mink and Somers Lakes are located in Wright County near the town of Maple Lake. The lakes are connected via a navigable channel and a public access is located on the east side of Mink Lake. Both lakes were reclaimed with rotenone in 1994 to eliminate large populations of carp and bullheads, then restocked. Current special regulations include bag limits of 5 sunfish, 5 crappie, 10 yellow perch, 2 walleye and 1 largemouth bass less than 12 inches.  Northern pike from 24 to 36 inches may not be harvested (only 1 over 36 inches allowed) and the use of live minnows is prohibited.  A partial winterkill occurred in 2001 and aeration systems will be deployed as needed in the future to prevent winterkill.Only two walleye were sampled by trap nets in 2004, a decline from 2003.  Both walleye were nearly 4 pounds and from the 1997 year class.  Walleye fry have been stocked four times since 1999, with mixed success.  The 2001 year class appeared strong, based on fall 2001 and spring 2002 electrofishing.  However, none of these fish were sampled during the 2004 survey.  Fingerlings were stocked in 2004 to supplement the walleye population.Six northern pike were sampled in 2004.  Half were greater than 29 inches, and growth appeared fast.  Northern pike were first discovered in the lake in 2001; the population will likely increase during the next several years.  Sampling in 2005 is planned for ice-out; this will likely provide a larger sample of northern pike, and thus a better means of evaluating the effects of the special regulation.Largemouth bass abundance was very high in 2004 for both Mink and Somers Lakes.  The average size increased from 2003 (from 10.0 to 10.8 inches) due to the growth of fish from strong 2000 and 2001 year classes.  Many 15-17 inch bass were also sampled.Bluegill catch rates in 2004 were similar to 2003, and within the range expected for lakes similar to Mink and Somers.  However, while mean weight of bluegill on Mink Lake (0.28 pounds) changed little, mean weight on Somers Lake (0.04 pounds) dropped dramatically from 2003 (0.35 pounds).  Nearly all of the bluegill sampled on Somers Lake were from the 2003 year class, and less than four inches.  Only seven bluegill over eight inches were sampled between the two lakes in 2004, compared to 127 in 2003.   Black crappie numbers were in the expected range for these lakes, but lower than in 2003.  All fish sampled were estimated to be from the strong 2001 year class, and ranged in length from 7.5-10 inches.Carp have become re-established in the lakes and were caught at expected rates in 2004.  Most fish come from one year class (now averaging over seven pounds) and it remains to be seen whether carp will reach nuisance levels, as they did prior to the reclamation.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Mink and Somers Lakes are located in Wright County near the town of Maple Lake. Mink Lake is in lake class 38 and Somers is in lake class 30.  The lakes are connected via a navigable channel and both were reclaimed with rotenone in 1994. The lakes were restocked and closed to fishing until 1998, when special regulations were established, including bag limits of 5 sunfish, 5 crappie, 10 yellow perch, 2 walleye and no harvest of largemouth bass.  The use of live minnows is prohibited. Beginning in 2003, only 1 bass less than 12 inches could be harvested and northern pike received a protected slot limit of 24 to 36 inches, with one over 36 inches allowed in the bag.  Annual population assessments have been conducted on the lakes since reclamation using trap nets, seines, and spring electrofishing, and gill nets were used as part of the 2001 survey.The 2005 survey included ice-out trap netting for northern pike, spring electrofishing for largemouth bass, and trap nets in late August. Ice-out trap nettingTrap netting (37 lifts April 6-8) at ice-out produced a catch of 65 northern pike, 1.76  per trap net.  Northern pike are considered moderately abundant at this catch rate.  Mean length was 29.4 inches and fish ranged in size from 13.0 to 34.5 inches.  Only three fish were not in the protected slot limit and all of these were less than 24 inches.   There are no other lakes in the area with northern pike of this quality.Largemouth Bass Electrofishing SurveyLargemouth bass abundance was high in 2005 for both basins.  The catch rate for Mink Lake was 104/hr.  It was similar to the catch rate in 2004 (116/hr, on-time), and twice the Montrose area median of 52/hr.  The catch rate for Somers Lake in 2005 was 145/hr.  This compares to 322/hr in 2004 and 313/hr in 2003.  The average size of largemouth bass on Mink and Somers was 11.7 inches.  More than one-third of the fish sampled were greater than 12 inches and many were greater than 15 inches.  Mink and Somers Lakes have become \"destination\" lakes for anglers seeking a quality largemouth bass fishing experience.  Late August trap nettingThe catch rate of bluegill for Mink Lake (15.2/trap net) appeared higher than that observed in 2004 (6.0/net) whereas the catch rate in Somers Lake (30.1/net) was similar to 2004 (32.9/net).  Nearly all of the bluegill sampled were from the 2002 and 2003 year classes and less than 6.5 inches.  Only nine bluegill over eight inches were sampled between the two lakes in 2005, compared to seven in 2004 and 127 in 2003.  It appears that the bluegill fishery may be in the \"rebuilding mode\" as larger fish from previous year classes have exited  and younger fish are recruiting to the fishery.In 2005 the black crappie catch rate for Mink Lake (21.4/trap net) was higher than 2004 (2.5/net) and above the catch expected for similar lakes. The catch rate on Somers Lake (4.0/net) was similar to 2004 (1.8/net).  Sampled black crappies are the result of three year-classes, 2001, 2004 and 2005.  Angling for 9-10 inches crappies should be good for the next few years.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Mink and Somers Lakes, two connected lakes totaling 458 acres in Wright County, Minnesota, were reclaimed in 1994. Pre-treatment population estimates showed carp populations ranged from 400-800 pounds per acre. <br> \n  <br> \nRotenone formulations were applied to the lakes and wetland areas and a complete kill was achieved.  The lakes were restocked with walleye, largemouth bass, bluegill, yellow perch and non-game species.  Angling regulations were applied to prolong good fishing.  Daily possession limits became five sunfish, five crappie, and three walleye (17\" minimum).  Largemouth bass and northern pike were maintained with protected slot limits; and no live minnows were permitted.  Fisheries were inventoried with trap and gill nets, electrofishing and creel surveys at annual, then five year intervals, most recently in 2011.  <br> \n <br> \nFish population numbers and sizes have fluctuated around the 75th percentile for the respective lake classes.  Largemouth bass, northern pike and walleye have been more stable than sunfish and black crappies. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth night time electrofishing catch rates have been above the area median.  The densities of largemouth greater than 12 and 15 inches were higher than statewide averages.  The lakes have become a destination for largemouth anglers. <br> \n <br> \nThough northern pike were never stocked, populations became established by 2001.  The initial experiment was to manage without northern pike to test if yellow perch would prosper with resulting positive effects on bluegill.  Since then northern pike have been within the range of expected values and 72 percent were larger than 24 inches.  That places the size structure in the 88th percentile of area lakes. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye fingerlings have been stocked every other year.  The population has remained above or near the 75th percentile.  The average size of walleye was large (2.7 pounds) and 84 percent of walleye were greater than 17 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nBluegill catches have fluctuated over time but remain high.  Although the average size has decreased, bluegill larger than eight inches are still present. <br> \n <br> \nGiven the hyper eutrophic nature of the lakes black crappie have become very abundant.  The 2011 gill net catch of black crappie was 71/lift, (average weight 0.11 lb,) which was about four times the 75th percentile statewide catch (18/gill net).  All this despite a 2003 summer-kill when tens of thousands of crappies perished. The burgeoning crappie population should produce quality angling as crappie mature. <br> \n <br> \nCarp appeared to enter the lake in 2001 due to a flooding event.  No reproduction has been noted and none were caught in 2011.  No bullheads have ever been taken, possibly because of the live minnow prohibition. <br> \n <br> \nCreel surveys in 1998 and 2001 encountered anglers who were thrilled about the fishing but wished the bag limits were greater.  No funding is available for creel surveys currently.</p>",

Northern Pike were caught at a rate of 2.0/gill net, which was similar to the 1984 catch. Lengths ranged from 24.4 to 32.1 inches. Northern Pike were dominated by age 4 and 5 fish. Average length was 28 inches and growth was good. Walleye abundance was 2.2/gill net, which was near the local average. Walleye lengths ranged from 15.8 to 21.4 inches and were primarily age 4. The average length was 19.0-19.9 inches and growth was good. \n\nBluegill, Black Crappie, and Black Bullhead were the most important species caught in trap nets. Bluegill were caught at a rate of 17.2/net, which was about equal to the local average. The average length was 5.5-5.9 inches. Black Crappie numbers were 11 times the local average. The average length was 5.5-5.9 inches. Common Carp and Black Bullhead were abundant and populations were dominated by single year classes.\n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Mink and Somers Lakes are located northwest of the City of Maple Lake in Wright County, Minnesota.  Mink Lake covers 301 acres, has a maximum depth of 39 feet, with 276 acres less than 15 feet deep.  Somers Lake covers 158 acres, has a maximum depth of 21 feet, with 128 acres less than 15 feet deep.  Mink and Somers Lakes have one DNR public access, which is located on the southwest corner of Mink Lake; access to Somers Lake is possible though a navigable channel to Mink Lake.  After the 1994 reclamation of Mink and Somers Lakes, annual surveys have been conducted to assess fish population abundance and size structure.  During 1998, a September trap net survey, a spring electrofishing survey and a May through September angler creel survey were completed on Somers Lake to assess the status of the recently reclaimed fishery.   Catch rates of fish from trap nets in 1998 consisted of Bluegill (45.0/net), Largemouth Bass (16.3/net), Yellow Perch (10.0/net), Black Crappie (6.7/net), Pumpkinseed (2.8/net), Walleye (2.0/net) and Golden Shiner (0.7/net).  Largemouth Bass abundance was 21 times the expected value, Yellow Perch abundance was 6 times the expected value and Walleye abundance was 1.5 times the expected value for lakes similar to Somers Lake.  Black Crappie, Pumpkinseed, Bluegill, and Golden Shiner had slightly higher than average values for similar lakes.  The trap net catch rate for Bluegill increased since the 1996 survey with 0.3/net, 6.5/net, and 45.0/net in 1996, 1997, and 1998, respectively; however, average length has  decreased from 7.7, to 6.2, and 5.3 inches, respectively.  Bluegill lengths in 1998 ranged from 3.5 to 8 inches, with an average weight of 0.1 pounds.  Growth was above average for Age 1 through 3 as Bluegill reached 4.0, 5.2, and 6.4 inches, respectively.  Growth was average for Age 4 (6.9 inches) individuals, and slightly below average for Age 5 (6.6 inches). Creel survey data from Mink and Somers Lakes indicated an overall angler catch rate of 0.7 Bluegill/hour, whereas anglers who targeted Bluegill caught 2.5 fish/hour.  Angler catch rate and the catch rate for anglers targeting Bluegill were below expected values for similar lakes; however, the average length of Bluegill harvested was 7.6 inches.  All anglers caught a total of 10,764 Bluegill, and harvested 3,421 Bluegill with a total weight of 1,269 pounds. Although Black Crappie were not stocked by DNR fisheries in Somers Lake, they were introduced sometime in 1996.  The trap net catch rate for Black Crappie (6.7/net) for 1998 increased since 1997 (0.5/net); however, average length has remained similar with 6.9 and 7.3 inches, respectively.  Lengths in 1998 ranged from 5.8 to 10.0 inches, with an average weight of 0.2 pounds.  Growth was above average for Minnesota lakes as Age 1 fish reached 6.4 inches, Age 2 reached 7.3 inches and Age 3 reached 9.5 inches.  The 1998 creel survey on Mink and Somers lakes indicated an overall angler catch rate of 0.1 Black Crappie/hour, whereas anglers who targeted Black Crappie caught 0.6 fish/hour.  All anglers caught a total of 1,201 Black Crappie, harvested 111, with a total harvested weight of 34 pounds.Gill nets are the primary gear for assessing Walleye and Yellow Perch numbers; however, they have not yet been used on Somers Lake since the reclamation.  The trap net catch rate for Yellow Perch has decreased since 1996 with 58.2/net, 16.0/net, and 10.0/net in 1996, 1997, and 1998; however, average length of fish has remained similar with 6.2, 7.8 and 6.5 inches, respectively.  Yellow Perch sampled in 1998 ranged in length from 5 to 10.6 inches, with an average weight of 0.1 pounds. Yellow Perch growth was above average for Minnesota lakes as Age 1, 2, and 3 individuals reached 5.6, 7.4, and 9.4 inches, respectively. Creel survey data on Mink and Somers Lakes gave an overall angler catch rate of 1.8 Yellow Perch/hour, whereas anglers who targeted Yellow Perch caught 3.5 fish/hour.  Angler catch rate was 6.4 times the average for similar lakes.  All anglers caught a total of 28,866 Yellow Perch, harvested 7,795, with a total harvested weight of 3,380 pounds.The trap net catch rate for Walleye has decreased since the 1996 survey with 3.5/net, 3.2/net and 2.0/net in 1996, 1997, and 1998, respectively.  Walleye average length decreased from 16.1 inches in 1997 to 10.5 inches in 1998.  Walleye fry and yearlings were stocked in 1995, and fingerlings and fry were stocked in 1997.  Evidence of good survival from stocking was observed, as the 1997 year class represented the majority of the fish sampled.  Walleye growth was above average as Age 1 and 3 reached 9.4 and 19.9 inches, respectively.  Creel survey data on Mink and Somers Lakes indicated an overall angler catch rate of 0.2 Walleye/hour, whereas anglers who targeted Walleye caught 0.3 fish/hour.  Angler catch rate was 81 times the average, and the catch rate for anglers targeting Walleye was 14 times the average for similar lakes.  All anglers caught a total of 3,545 Walleye, harvested 1,226, with a total harvested weight of 3,045 pounds.  The spring electrofishing catch rate for Largemouth Bass in 1998 was 41.3/hour, which was an improvement from 1997 (18.7/hour).  Largemouth Bass ranged in length from 3.5 to 13.7 inches, with an average length of 10.2 inches, and an average weight of 0.8 pounds.  Of the catchable Largemouth Bass (larger than 8 inches) caught in 1998, 75% were larger than 12 inches.  Largemouth Bass growth was above average for Minnesota lakes as age 1, 2, and 3 fish reached 5.8, 7.7 and 13.2 inches, respectively.  Creel survey data on Mink and Somers Lakes indicated an overall angler catch rate of 1.2 Largemouth Bass/hour, whereas anglers who targeted Largemouth Bass caught 2.9 fish/hour.  Angler catch rate was 6 times the average, and the catch rate for anglers targeting Largemouth Bass was 5 times the average for lakes similar to Somers Lake.  All anglers caught a total of 18,764 Largemouth Bass.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Mink and Somers Lakes were reclaimed in the fall of 1994.  The restocking efforts for these lakes began in the spring of 1995 and this survey was intended to evaluate the recovery of the system.  Survey gear included one 250 foot gill net, 3/4 inch trap nets, and shoreline seining.  The trap nets were set to assess survival of yearling and adult fish, while shoreline seining was done to assess natural reproduction.  The gill net was set to assess the effectiveness of spring and fall trap netting to evaluate the status of the Walleye and Yellow Perch populations.Representatives of each of the 4 stocked species were recovered during the fall survey.  In addition to the stocked species, Pumpkinseed (2.2/trap net), Black Crappie (6.3/trap net) and Golden Shiner (0.8/trap net) were also caught.  Yellow Perch (208/net) and Walleye (28/net) were the most common species caught in the gill net.  Bluegill (13/net), Largemouth Bass (3/net) and Black Crappie (2/net) were the only other species caught.  Yellow Perch ranged in length from 5.6-10.4 inches and averaged 8.4 inches.  The length structure of Yellow Perch was excellent, with 52% larger than 9 inches.  The growth rate of Yellow Perch was fast when compared with other populations statewide, with fish reaching 7.6 inches by age 2.  Walleye ranged in length from 14.6-20.7 inches and averaged 17.7 inches.  Walleye growth was fast compared to other populations statewide, with female Walleye reaching 16.9 inches by age 3.  From previous spring and fall trap netting, the quality of the Yellow Perch and Walleye populations were believed to be excellent.  The gill net information supports this data and further use of gill nets to sample these populations appears unnecessary.  Yellow Perch were caught in trap nets at a rate of 13.0/net, little changed from the previous fall assessment (16.5/net).  The fish ranged in length from 4.9-10.2 inches and averaged 8.1 inches.  A total of 650 young-of-year fish were caught during fall seining, indicating excellent levels of reproduction in the basin.  Yellow Perch from seining ranged in length from 2.4-3.5 inches and averaged 3.0 inches.  Walleye were caught (2.2/trap net) from the 1997 fry stocking, the 1995 fry and 1995 yearling stockings.  In the fall of 1997, the one Walleye from the 1997 fry stocking was 6.3 inches in length.  Walleye from the 1995 fry stocking averaged 16.4 inches, whereas Walleye from the 1995 yearling stocking ranged in length from 18.0-21.7 inches and averaged 19.7 inches.  The average weight was 2.3 pounds.Bluegill were caught in all gears used in 1997.  A total of 123 young-of-year Bluegill were caught during fall seining, showing a good level of natural reproduction in the lake.  The fish ranged in length from 1.3-2.5 inches and averaged 2.0 inches.  Bluegill were caught in trap nets at a rate of 43.7/net, ranged in length from 3.2-7.9 inches, and averaged 5.6 inches.  The overall length structure of Bluegill was good, as 34% of the fish caught were over 7 inches.  The growth rate of Bluegill was fast when compared with statewide averages, with fish reaching 5.8 inches by age 2. Largemouth Bass were caught in both seines and trap nets.  A total of 82 young-of-year fish were caught by seining.  The fish ranged in length from 2.7-4.6 inches and averaged 3.3 inches.   Largemouth Bass were caught in trap nets at a rate of 16.7/net, which increased from the previous assessment (5.3/net).  Largemouth Bass ranged in length from 3.2-7.9 inches and averaged 5.6 inches.  The growth rate of Largemouth Bass was fast for age 1 and 2 fish and average for ages 3-5.Fall electrofishing was conducted to assess the Largemouth Bass fishery and the success of Walleye fry stocking.  A total of 17 Largemouth Bass were caught at a rate of 18.0/hour (on-time).  This fell below the Montrose Area average.  The poor water clarity present during sampling may have affected the catch rate of Largemouth Bass.  A total of 8 Walleye were caught during electrofishing.  Of these 8 fish, only 1 was a young-of-year from spring fry stocking.  Because of the apparent low survival of fry, a supplemental stocking of Walleye fingerlings was done in the fall of 1997. </p>",

Nearshore sampling captured six species of game fish and no minnows, shiners, or darters.   <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey is combined with data from a standard game fish survey completed in August 2016 to calculate a Fish-based Index of Biologic Integrity (FIBI) that describes the overall health of the lake.

                "narrative": "<p>Primary species in gill nets were: Common Carp and Yellow Perch.  Walleye and Northern Pike were not captured in gill nets; however, one six year old (24.1 inch) Walleye was captured in a trap net (0.2/net).  The one Walleye probably originated from the 1986 fry stocking. Subsequent fry stockings may have been unsuccessful because of partial winter and summer fish kills.  Walleye and Northern Pike growth in the past (1989) have been average to fast based on statewide values.  \n\nCommon Carp numbers (29.0/gill net) were high compared to similar lakes, but decreased from 72.7/gill net in 1989.  Most lengths were between 9.0 and 14.9 inches.  Several Common Carp greater than 20 inches were also caught.  This indicates that several year classes of Common Carp were present in the lake during 1992.  Common Carp caught during 1989 ranged in length from 10.0 to 12.9 inches.  \n\nYellow Perch numbers (0.7/gill net) were below the expected range of values for lakes similar to Somers and well below the 1984 catch of 30.0/gill net.  Yellow Perch average weight (0.1 pounds) equaled the low end of the range of expected values.  The length range of Yellow Perch during 1992 (5.0-6.4 inches) has changed little since the 1984 survey (5.0-8.4 inches) and the average length has remained identical (6.0-6.4 inches). \n\nImportant species caught in trap nets were: Bluegill, Black Crappie, Largemouth Bass, and Black Bullhead.  Bluegill trap net catches have decreased from above the expected range in 1984 (154/set), to below the average value in 1992 (7.8/set).  Bluegill average weight (0.2 pounds) was average compared to similar lakes, and the length range (4.5 to 7.9 inches) remained consistent with previous surveys.  Young-of-year Bluegill were not caught during the assessment.  Black Crappie numbers (17.0/trap net) were within the expected range, but declined from 117/trap net in 1984. Black Crappie average weight was 0.2 pounds, which was at the low end of the expected range of values.  The average weight and range of lengths remained similar to past surveys. \n\nLargemouth Bass numbers (0.2/trap net) were low; however, it was the first year a Largemouth Bass was captured during a survey.  Average weight (0.6 pounds) was average compared to similar lakes and growth rates were similar to statewide averages.  Largemouth Bass from trap nets ranged in age from one to three years, and two young-of-year were caught during shoreline seining.  \n\nThe Black Bullhead catch (9.0/trap net) was average compared to similar lakes and far less than the 1989 catch (251/trap net); however, the low 1992 catch may be the result of cooler water temperatures.  The average Black Bullhead weight (0.2 pounds) was low compared to similar lakes, whereas the average weight for Common Carp (1.0 pounds) was average. Four additional species were captured during the survey:  Golden Shiner, White Sucker, Hybrid Sunfish, and Pumpkinseed.  The Golden Shiner catch was average, while the catch of White Sucker, Hybrid Sunfish and Pumpkinseed were low compared to similar lakes.\n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Somers Lake is located in Wright County, two miles northeast of the town of Maple Lake.  Somers Lake is 158 acres in size, with a maximum depth of 21 feet and an average depth of 10.2 feet.  Boaters can access Somers Lake by a short channel from Mink Lake.  A public access in the southwest corner of Mink Lake offers a boat ramp and parking for several vehicles.Mink and Somers Lakes were treated in 1994 with rotenone (a fish toxicant) in an attempt to eliminate bullheads and Common Carp, which were abundant.  Following the treatment, the lakes were re-stocked with Yellow Perch, Walleye, Largemouth Bass, Bluegill, and several forage species.  Black Crappie also became re-established in the lakes.  The lakes were closed to angling for five years after the treatment.  When the lake was opened to fishing, special regulations were established for the two lakes to further enhance the fishery.  As of 1999, the daily limits were two Walleye, five sunfish, five Black Crappie, and ten Yellow Perch.  Largemouth Bass are designated as catch-and-release only.  The use of live minnows is prohibited.The lakes have been surveyed annually following the reclamation to follow the changes in population size and structure, and growth rates of fish.  The most recent survey was conducted in 1999.  A gill net set in Somers Lake indicated that the Walleye population is high compared to lakes similar to Mink and Somers.  The catch was lower than in 1997, prior to re-opening the lake to fishing.  A creel survey conducted in 1998 showed that even with the more restrictive limits, Walleye harvest by anglers was high.  This high angler harvest may have reduced Walleye numbers from the 1997 survey.  Walleyes from the gill net ranged from 20 to 24.5 inches, and grew quickly.  The Yellow Perch population is also high, which provides abundant food for Walleye.  Average length of Yellow Perch was 6.8 inches, with some fish nearly 12 inches long.  Largemouth Bass are abundant in Mink and Somers Lakes, and many are now over 16 inches.  During spring electrofishing, catch rates were high for both Mink and Somers Lakes.  The Bluegill population is high for both lakes, with the largest individuals over 8 inches in 1999.  Black Crappie numbers were average, but the population is probably still increasing.   Crappies had an average length of 8.2 inches, with some fish over 10 inches.  Growth rates for all game species were fast, which is common for newly reclaimed lakes.  Food is abundant and competition is lower than normal.  It is expected that growth rates will slow over time as populations increase.  Water clarity improved due to the reclamation, and this allowed submerged plants to become more abundant.  Curled pondweed and Canada waterweed are the most common plants present and provide cover and feeding habitat for many species of fish.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Mink and Somers Lakes were reclaimed with rotenone in 1994, in an attempt to eliminate the large population of carp and bullheads.  The lakes now contain walleye, yellow perch, bluegill, black crappie and largemouth bass.  Special regulations were placed on the fishery, allowing harvest of two walleye, five black crappie, five bluegill and ten yellow perch.  No harvest is allowed on bass, and no live minnows are allowed.  Fisheries surveys have been conducted in each year following the reclamation to track changes in fish populations.Partial winterkill occurred in March 2001 on both Mink and Somers Lakes.  Losses appeared high (based on visual estimates), especially for bluegill and larger walleye and bass.  However, trap nets set following ice-out sampled high numbers of bluegill and yellow perch, as well as black crappie, largemouth bass, and walleye.Walleye are managed as a primary game species for the lakes.  In 2001, walleye were caught at higher rates than is typical for lakes like Mink and Somers.  Most of the walleye sampled were 14-16 inches in length (the 1997 year class), although some were as large as 25 inches.  The walleye fishery requires regular stocking, and the current management plan calls for fry stocking, with fingerlings used only when no evidence of fry survival is observed.  Fry were stocked in 2001, and evaluated with fall electrofishing.  Many fingerlings were sampled, which may represent another strong year class.  Largemouth bass populations were assessed by night electrofishing in the spring, and catch rates were similar to other lakes in the area.  There was little change in the number of medium-sized fish (8-14 inches) from 2000 to 2001.  However, there appeared to be fewer large bass (15 inches or larger) present.  The recent winterkill may have impacted the large fish more than the smaller fish.  However, growth rates and recruitment of bass are still high, and losses to winterkill will be temporary. The catch rates of bluegill on both Mink and Somers lakes in 2001 were within the expected range.  Following a peak in 1999, catch rates have dropped, while mean weight of bluegill has increased.  Lower densities of bluegill allow for faster growth rates and larger average size.  The mean weight of bluegill in 2001 was 0.34 pounds.  Many individuals sampled were larger than 8 inches, and the largest was 8.4 inches.  Like the bluegill, the numbers of black crappie sampled in 2001 was within the expected range for both lakes, but mean weight was very high (0.70 pounds).  Yellow perch catch was high in 2001, for both lakes.  Average size was high (9 inches, or 0.3 pounds), with some nearly 12 inches.  A high number of young-of-year perch and black crappie were sampled by shoreline seining in 2001; this may signal strong year classes for both species.  Other species that were not stocked by DNR fisheries staff have been discovered in Mink and Somers Lakes.  Northern pike were sampled during the ice-out netting in 2001, and again during the fall assessment.  Most of the pike sampled in the fall were young-of-year, with a mean length of 12 inches.  Prior to the reclamation, pike populations never appeared high.  However, given the high number of yellow perch currently available, northern pike may become more abundant than in the past.  White sucker were also sampled by gill nets in 2001, but at low rates.  Carp were sampled by both gill nets and trap nets.  Nearly all individuals sampled were small (10-13 inches).  Angling success has been good on Mink and Somers Lakes since the reclamation project, initially for walleye and yellow perch, and more recently for panfish and largemouth bass.  A creel survey is being conducted during the winter of 2001-2002, and a summer creel will be conducted in 2002.  Along with catch and harvest information, data will be collected on attitudes towards the current set of special regulations.  Regulations will be evaluated in 2002 and changes may be made at that time.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Mink and Somers Lakes are located in Wright County near the town of Maple Lake. The lakes are connected via a navigable channel and a public access is located on the east side of Mink Lake. Both lakes were reclaimed with rotenone in 1994 to eliminate large populations of carp and bullheads, then restocked. Current special regulations include bag limits of 5 sunfish, 5 crappie, 10 yellow perch, 2 walleye and 6 largemouth bass less than 12 inches. Northern pike from 24 to 36 inches may not be harvested (only 1 over 36 inches allowed) and the use of live minnows is prohibited. A partial winterkill occurred in 2001 and aeration systems will be deployed as needed in the future to prevent winterkill.Few walleye were netted in 2002, but more extensive netting in 2001 had catch rates above the expected range for lakes similar to Mink and Somers. The walleye population is sustained by stocking and fry are currently stocked every other year. Fry stocking in 2001 was successful and these walleye were 11 to 12 inches long in 2002. Walleye captured in 2002 ranged from 11.1 to 21.7 inches in length.Largemouth bass catch rates during spring electrofishing decreased compared to 2001 and were below average for the area. However, this is because few small bass were caught; most were between 12 and 17 inches and the number of larger bass was relatively high. The largest individual captured was 18.6 inches. Average length has been increasing and growth rates are high. The new largemouth bass regulation allows harvest of smaller fish, while retaining larger bass in the population.Bluegill catch rates increased in 2002 and the average size is larger than expected for similar lakes. Most bluegill were 7 to 8.5 inches and grew fast. The largest individuals were just under 9 inches. Black crappie numbers are in the expected range for the lakes and include both a strong 2001 year class (4.5-6.5 inches) and a group of older year classes (10-12 inches). The largest crappie captured was 12.4 inches. Yellow perch are abundant and the average size (8.6 inches) was larger than expected. Most perch were 9-10.5 inches; the largest individual was 11 inches.A few northern pike were captured, ranging in size from 10-24 inches. The new protected slot limit and abundant yellow perch for forage may provide a trophy pike fishery in the future. Carp have become reestablished in the lakes and were caught at higher than expected rates in 2001 and 2002. It remains to be seen whether carp will reach nuisance levels, as they did prior to the reclamation.A winter angler survey in 2002 found that both angler success and satisfaction with the fishery were high and a new regulation allows limited bass harvest in response to angler feedback. Overall, the special regulations seem to be successful at maintaining a high quality, multi-species fishery by limiting harvest.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Mink and Somers Lakes are located in Wright County near the town of Maple Lake. Mink Lake is in lake class 38 and Somers is in class 30.  The lakes are connected via a navigable channel and both were reclaimed with rotenone in 1994. The lakes were restocked and closed to fishing until 1998, when special regulations were established, including bag limits of 5 sunfish, 5 crappie, 10 yellow perch, 2 walleye and no harvest of largemouth bass.  The use of live minnows is prohibited.  Beginning in 2003, only 1 bass less than 12 inches could be harvested and northern pike received a protected slot limit of 24 to 36 inches, with one over 36 inches allowed in the bag.   <br> \n <br> \nAnnual population assessments have been conducted on the lakes since reclamation using trap nets, seines, and spring electrofishing.  Gill nets were used as part of the 2001 and 2006 surveys.  Since the lakes are connected, all age and growth data as well as size structure data was combined for the two lakes. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass abundance was high in 2006 for both basins.  The catch rate for Mink Lake was 176.7 fish/hr.  It was similar to the catch rate in 2005 and 2004 and three times the Montrose area average.  The catch rate for Somers Lake in 2006 was 79.3 fish/hr.  Sixty percent of the fish sampled were greater than 12 inches, and many were greater than 15 inches.  Largemouth bass in Mink and Somers lakes reach 12 inches in five years.  Since the reclamation the lakes have become a popular destination for largemouth bass anglers. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye have been stocked as fry, fingerlings, and adults since the reclamation.  In 2001, walleye were caught at a rate of 5.5/gill net in Mink Lake, and 6.8/net in Somers Lake.  Both catch rates exceeded the expected range of values for the lake classes.  Results were very similar in 2006. Walleye ranged in length from 12-25 inches with an average length and weight of 18.4 inches and 2.5 pounds.  The current management plan calls for fingerling stocking since fry survival was not observed in several stocking attempts.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike were never stocked in Mink-Somers Lakes but established populations by 2001.  Catch rates of northern pike in that year were low but similar in the two basins.  In 2006 northern pike catch rates showed significant increases.  Northern pike from Mink and Somers lakes reach 24 inches in 4-5 years and forty percent of northerns were within the protected slot.   At current levels of abundance anglers can expect outstanding fishing for above average size northern pike.   <br> \n <br> \nCatch rates of yellow perch declined significantly for both lakes.  It seems certain that the northern pike are influencing perch populations.  This has implications for future growth of northern pike as well as survival of stocked walleye fingerlings. <br> \n <br> \nIn 2001 the catch rates of bluegill on both basins were within the expected ranges for the respective lake classes.  The mean weight of bluegill sampled by trap nets was 0.34 lbs. In 2006 the catches were similar but average size has declined.  Bluegill now grow to seven inches in 4-5 years.  Fishing success for bluegill and crappie is not what it once was, but bluegill larger than eight inches are still common. The crappie population is burgeoning and should produce good fishing in 2007 and beyond. <br> \nFirst noticed in 2001 carp were present in high numbers.  All individuals sampled were small (10-13 inches).  Since then annual sampling has revealed no reproduction.  As the average size of carp increased, the catches decreased such that in 2006 both the gill and trap net catches are low.   Only one bullhead has been captured during the past 11 years.  <br> \n <br> \nAll of the fish populations will be dynamic because of poor water quality conditions.  Fishing regulations will be evaluated in 2007 and, with the consent of the public, continued into the future. <br> \n</p>",

Targeted surveys using trap nets around spawning time can give a more accurate picture of Bluegill abundance and size structure than standard surveys conducted later in the summer. The lakes are connected by a short, navigable channel and results were quite similar; therefore, data for Mink Lake and Somers Lake were combined for the analysis. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill numbers were high; a total of 1,075 were caught in two days of lifting nets. Lengths ranged from 2.5 to 8.8 inches with an average length of 5.7 inches. The size structure of a fish population is typically described in terms of Proportional Stock Density (PSD) and Relative Stock Density (RSD). For Bluegill, PSD is the percentage of fish longer than three inches that are also longer than six inches. RSD 8 is the percentage of fish longer than three inches that are also longer than eight inches. For Mink and Somers Lakes, PSD was 46 and RSD 8 was 1. So 46% of Bluegill were longer than six inches and 1% were longer than eight inches. Bluegill size structure was poor; recent targeted Bluegill surveys in the Sauk Rapids Area have found a PSD range of 26 to 91 and an RSD 8 range from 0 to 54. <br> \n <br> \nOnly 13 Pumpkinseed were captured in the survey. Lengths ranged from 4.1 to 7.8 inches with an average length of 6.2 inches. No other sunfish species were caught. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill grow slowly in the Sauk Rapids Area, taking up to eight years to reach eight inches. Anglers are encouraged to limit their harvest of larger Bluegill (>8 inches) and keep smaller fish for a meal. This can help prevent stunted populations of small fish and keep larger Bluegill available. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Somers Lake is a 158-acre lake located about three miles north of Maple Lake in Wright County. Somers is connected to Mink Lake via a navigable channel and a public boat access is located on the southwest side of Mink Lake. High phosphorous concentrations result in nuisance algal blooms, large stands of curly-leaf pondweed and reduced water clarity. A standard lake survey was conducted in Augustto monitor changes in the fishery from the last survey completed in 2011. In addition to the standard survey, a Bluegill assessment was conducted in May and an Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) survey was conducted in August. Results from these surveys will be summarized in separate reports. <br> \n <br> \nMink and Somers Lakes were reclaimed with rotenone in 1994. The lakes were restocked and closed to fishing until 1998, when special regulations were established, including bag limits of 5 sunfish, 5 crappie, 10 Yellow Perch, 2 Walleye and catch and release of Largemouth Bass. The use of live minnows is also prohibited. In 2003, a 24 to 36 inch protected slot with one over 36 inches allowed in possession was put in place for Northern Pike. In 2008, the Yellow Perch regulation was dropped, the Walleye regulation was changed to a 17 inch minimum, three fish bag limit, and the Largemouth Bass regulation was changed to a 12 to 20 inch protected slot limit with harvest of one bass over 20 inches allowed.   <br> \n <br> \nWalleye have been stocked as fry, fingerlings, and adults since the reclamation and the lake is currently stocked with fingerlings every other year. The catch of Walleye was lower than reported in 2011, but within the expected range of values for similar lakes. Walleye ranged in length from 20 to 28 inches with an average length of 24 inches. Only six Walleye were sampled during the survey, but represented five different year classes.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike were never stocked in Mink-Somers Lakes but established populations by 2001. The 2016 catch of Northern Pike was the highest observed since reclamation and is above the expected range for similar lakes. Pike ranged in length from 11 to 33 with a mean length of 26 inches. Seventy-six percent of the Northern Pike sampled were longer than 24 inches and 12% were longer than 30 inches. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers are encouraged to harvest smaller pike (under 22 inches) and release the larger ones to help achieve a more balanced fish community and promote good growth rates. Lower pike numbers may also increase the survival of young Walleye and Yellow Perch. Higher perch populations are desirable as they are an important prey species for both Walleye and Northern Pike. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass were sampled by night-time electrofishing on June 19, 2016. Eighty-seven bass were sampled in 0.92 hours of effort for a catch rate of 95.0 fish/hr. This is higher than the average night-time catch rate for Sauk Rapids Area lakes (73.6 fish/hour). Largemouth Bass ranged in length from 3 to 20 inches with an average length of 13 inches and numerous bass longer than 15 inches. <br> \n <br> \nThe catch of Yellow Perch was significantly higher when compared to recent surveys and well above the range of expected values for similar lakes. Yellow Perch ranged in length from 5 to 8 inches with an average length of 6 inches. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill catches were slightly lower than previous surveys, but still within the range of expected values for similar lakes. Overall, Bluegill ranged in length from 3 to 9 inches with an average length of 6 inches. The trap net catch of Black Crappie was also slightly lower than previous surveys, but within the range of expected values for similar lakes. Whereas, the gill net catch was higher the previous survey and higher than the expected values for similar lakes. Black Crappie ranged in length from 4 to 12 inches with an average length of 7 inches. <br> \n <br> \nIn 2001, Common Carp were present in high numbers in Mink and Somers lakes (9.4/gill net and 3.4/trap net, lakes combined). However, as the average size of Carp increased, the catches decreased such that in 2016 no Carp were caught in the gill nets and only 1.1/trap net.  <br> \n <br> \nPumpkinseed Sunfish were the only other fish species sampled during the survey. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Somers Lake is a 158-acre lake located about three miles north of Maple Lake in Wright County. Somers is connected to Mink Lake via a navigable channel and a public boat access is located on the southwest side of Mink Lake. High phosphorous concentrations result in nuisance algal blooms, large stands of curly-leaf pondweed and reduced water clarity. A standard lake survey was conducted in August to monitor changes in the fishery from the last survey completed in 2016. <br> \n <br> \nMink and Somers Lakes were reclaimed with rotenone in 1994 due to an overabundance of Common Carp. The lakes were restocked and closed to fishing until 1998. Since that time an aeration system has been deployed as needed to prevent winterkill. Similar to connected Mink Lake, Somers Lake is also managed with a suite of fishing regulations. Current regulations include: daily bag limits of five sunfish, five crappie, a 17 inch minimum size limit on Walleye with a possession limit of three, a 12 - 20 inch protected slot on Largemouth Bass with one over 20 inches allowed in possession, and a 24 - 36 inch protected slot on Northern Pike with one over 36 inches allowed in possession. Possession and use of live minnows is also prohibited. <br> \n <br> \nThe Walleye population in Somers Lake is sustained through fingerling stocking during odd numbered years. Walleye have been stocked as fry, fingerlings, and adults since the reclamation and the lake is currently stocked with fingerlings every other year. The catch of Walleye was similar to that reported in 2016, and within the expected range of values for similar lakes. Walleye ranged in length from 20 to 27 inches with an average length of 22 inches. Only nine Walleye were sampled during the survey but represented five different year classes.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike were never stocked in Mink-Somers Lakes but populations became established by 2001. The 2021 catch of Northern Pike decreased by half from the record high catch observed in 2016 but still remained near the top of the expected range for similar lakes. Pike ranged in length from 8 to 36 inches with an average length of 24 inches. Sixty-seven percent of the pike sampled were longer than 24 inches and 26% were longer than 30 inches. Anglers are encouraged to harvest smaller pike (under 22 inches) and release the larger ones to help achieve a more balanced fish community and promote good growth rates. Lower pike numbers may also increase the survival of young Walleye and Yellow Perch. Higher perch populations are desirable as they are an important prey species for both Walleye and Northern Pike. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass were sampled by day-time electrofishing on June 2, 2021. Fifty-five bass were sampled in 0.98 hours of effort for a catch rate of 56.3 fish/hr. This is higher than the average day-time catch rate for Sauk Rapids Area lakes (43.3 fish/hour). Largemouth Bass ranged in length from 7 to 20 inches with an average length of 13 inches and numerous bass longer than 15 inches. <br> \n <br> \nThe catch of Yellow Perch decreased but was still good compared to recent surveys and remained well above the range of expected values for similar lakes. Yellow Perch ranged in length from 5 to 9 inches with an average length of 7 inches. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill trap net catches were twice that of the previous survey, and exceeded the range of expected values for similar lakes. Overall, Bluegill ranged in length from 3 to 10 inches with an average length of 6 inches. The trap net catch of Black Crappie were also two times higher than the previous survey but remained within the range of expected values for similar lakes. The gill net catch on the other hand was lower than the previous survey, but still above the range of expected values for similar lakes. Black Crappie ranged in length from 4 to 13 inches with an average length of 6 inches. <br> \n <br> \nIn 2001, Common Carp were present in high numbers in Mink and Somers lakes (9.4/gill net and 3.4/trap net, lakes combined). However, as the average size of Carp increased, the catches decreased such that in 2021 only three Carp were caught in the gill nets and none in the trap nets.  <br> \n <br> \nHybrid and Pumpkinseed Sunfish were the only other fish species sampled during the survey. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Somers Lake is located two miles northeast of Maple Lake in Wright County.  It has a surface area of 158 acres, a maximum depth of  21 feet, and an average depth of 10.2 feet.  Mink Lake is connected to Somers Lake by a navigable channel and a public access at the southwest corner of Mink Lake serves both lakes.Mink and Somers Lakes were treated with rotenone (a fish toxicant) in 1994 to eliminate abundant carp and bullheads.  The lakes were re-stocked with yellow perch, walleye, largemouth bass, bluegill, and several forage species.  Black crappie were not stocked, but have become established.  Angling was prohibited (except for bluegill) for five years, then special regulations were applied to enhance and protect the fishery.  Current daily limits are two walleye, five sunfish, five black crappie, and ten yellow perch.  Largemouth bass are catch-and-release only and no live minnows are allowed.Surveys are conducted annually to monitor changes in the fishery of both lakes.  The 2000 survey found that walleye continue to be present in above average numbers and size.  The average size of walleye caught in fall trap nets was 20.3 inches and 3.5 pounds.  Walleye continue to be stocked, but recent survival has been poor.  Few yellow perch were caught in 2000, but the average size was large (8.1 inches) and the largest perch caught was 11.5 inches.  Few small perch have been seen in the past three years; however, dense vegetation has made sampling them difficult.  Largemouth bass are abundant and many larger fish are present.  The average bass size was 14.4 inches, maximum size was 18.4 inches, and 64% of all fish of catchable size were 15 inches or longer.  Bluegill abundance and average size (6.3 inches) remain high; many bluegill exceed 7 inches and several 8-inch fish were caught.  Black crappie are not as abundant, but most are 8-10 inches long and average 0.5 pounds.  Hybrid sunfish and pumpkinseed sunfish were also captured, although neither was stocked by the DNR.Growth rates were very high following restocking, which is common for reclaimed lakes.  Fish populations have increased and competition for food is likely causing growth rates to slow to normal levels.  The special regulations seem to be prolonging the high quality fishery and reducing the threat of undesirable species being re-introduced.  Water clarity improved following reclamation, but has declined since 1997.  The lakes have a largely agricultural watershed and changes in land use practices could help improve water quality.</p>",
