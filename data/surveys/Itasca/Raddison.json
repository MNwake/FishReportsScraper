                "narrative": "<p>Radisson Lake is a 197-acre lake in Itasca County within the Big Fork River watershed.  Radisson Lake is approximately 10 miles east of Bigfork, MN.  The lake has a maximum depth of 40 ft and 73 acres less than 15 ft deep.  A public access is located on the south shore.  Water clarity was good with a Secchi disk reading of 14.0 ft. Northern pike gill-net catch was 14.2/net, which was almost twice the expected range for similar lakes.  Northern pike gill-net catch has varied from 1.5 to 8.5/net in previous assessments.  In general, size structure was poor with few fish greater than 24 inches in length.  Northern pike populations with high abundance often exhibit poor size structure.  Growth was similar to the statewide average with fish reaching 25 inches in 6 years.Bluegill trap-net catch was 25.2/net, which was within the expected range of similar lakes.  Abundance in past assessments has varied from 2.0 to 73.2/trap net.  Size structure was good with a high percentage of fish sampled between 6 and 8 inches, but few fish greater than 8 inches.  Black crappie gill-net catch was 2.0/net, which was also within the expected range for similar lakes.  Gill-net catch rates have varied from 1.3 to 8.2 in past assessments.  Although abundance was low in this assessment, size structure was good with fish up to 11 inches sampled.  Growth was slower than the statewide average for ages 1 to 2 and similar to the average for ages 3 to 5.  Black crappie reach 9 inches in 5 years.Largemouth bass trap-net catch was 1.8/net, which was higher than the expected range for similar lakes.  Abundance in past assessments has varied from 1.0 to 2.5/trap net.  Size structure was poor with no fish larger than 12 inches sampled.  Gill nets and trap nets do not sample largemouth bass effectively, therefore the results of this assessment should be viewed cautiously, and may not accurately reflect abundance or size structure.  Largemouth bass grew slower than the statewide average with fish only reaching 9 inches in 4 years.  Smallmouth bass have been sampled in low abundance in past assessments.  One fish was sampled in gill nets and no fish were sampled in trap nets.  Yellow perch gill-net catch was 0.7/net, which was lower than the expected range for similar lakes.  Abundance in past assessments has varied from 1.3 to 10.8/net.  Size structure was poor with no fish larger than 7 inches sampled.  Other species sampled include white sucker and pumpkinseed sunfish.In order to maintain or improve fish and wildlife populations water quality and habitat must be protected.  People often associate water quality problems with large-scale agricultural, forestry, urban development or industrial practices in the watershed.  In reality, the impact of land use decisions on one lake lot may be relatively small, yet, the cumulative impacts of those decisions on many lake lots can result in a significant decline in water quality and habitat.  For example, removing shoreline and aquatic vegetation, fertilizing lawns, mowing to the waters edge, installing beach sand blankets, failing septic systems and uncontrolled run-off, all contribute excess nutrients and sediment which degrade water quality and habitat.  Understanding these cumulative impacts and taking steps to avoid or minimize them will help to insure our quality fisheries can be enjoyed by future generations.</p>",
