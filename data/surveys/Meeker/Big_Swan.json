                "narrative": "<p>Big Swan Lake in Meeker County was netted begining 8/05/02 to evaluate the fish community and walleye stocking efforts.  The water level at Big Swan Lake can flucuate up to ten feet because of the connection to the North Fork of the Crow River.  Heavy rains during the 2002 summer raised water levels and caused severe erosion to sections of the shoreline around the lake.  Even the public access was submerged at times.  Good numbers of northern pike were present at Big Swan Lake, averaging 21.3 inches and 2.2 pounds.  The longest northern pike sampled was 29.8 inches.  Excellent numbers of good sized black crappie were sampled in 2002.  Approximately 26% of the black crappie caught in trap nets were 9 inches or longer, with a maximum length of 11.1 inches.  Good crappie fishing reports in the summer of 2002 and winter 2002-2003 confirmed net catch information.  Gill netting in 2002 produced the second highest walleye catch rate ever at Big Swan Lake.  Age one walleye, averaging 9.6 inches, made up 78% of the catch.  Age two walleye averaged 16.5 inches.  So, by late summer 2003 there should be good numbers of eater sized walleye if growth rates remain consistent.  Fair numbers of 16 to 20 inch walleye were also sampled.  Walleye fingerlings are stocked every-other-year at Big Swan Lake.  Fall electrofishing has documented natural reproduction of walleye at Big Swan Lake.  In 2002, 13% of the walleye sampled came from non-stocked years.  In the 1997 assessment 42% of the walleye gill netted came from non-stocked years.  It is unknown what portion of a year class is a result of stocking and what portion is a result of natural reproduction during years when walleye fingerlings are stocked.  Big Swan Lake is one of the best lakes to fish for channel catfish in the Hutchinson Fisheries Management Area.  Gill netted channel catfish averaged 17.1 inches and 2.1 pounds in 2002.  Channel catfish up to 26.2 inches were sampled.  The lake is not known as a bluegill lake but there are a few keepers out there.  Approximately 33% of the bluegill trap netted were 7 inches or longer.  Other species that you may encounter when fishing Big Swan Lake are shorthead redhorse, silver redhorse, bigmouth buffalo, bowfin (dogfish) and there are even a few smallmouth bass present.  Largemouth bass are also present, but typically don't sample well in gill or trap nets and spring electrofishing was not conducted in 2002.  Water clarity was measured at 4.1 feet in August 2002 and water color was clearish brown from the recent flooding.  Heavy algal blooms are common at Big Swan Lake.  During high water, try fishing up in the trees and brush.  Many people have good success shore fishing near the outlet at the North end of the lake.   </p>",

White crappies were taken at 5.6/gillnet lift with many being over 9 inches.  Only three walleye were taken in this survey; however, we know that walleye fishing was excellent, with walleyes averaging 2-8 pounds.  Commercial netting also showed many walleye present.  Northern pike were sampled at 5.6/gillnet lift with nearly all fish over 16\", some up to 35\".  Channel catfish are providing a moderate sport fishery.  Perch are present at 11.4/gillnet lift.  There is a good largemouth bass fishery though numbers of fish sampled do not indicate this.  Bluegill are present at 19.3/trapnet lift, though their size is averaging quite small. </p>",

All gamefish appear to be growing at normal rates with the exception of Bluegill, which appear to be growing at a slightly greater rate.  Northern Pike appear to be primarily of age group II, although sufficient numbers of this species were not obtained to permit accuracy in age determination of the population.  Black Crappies are better represented, and appear to be composed of mainly age groups II and III.  Bluegills were only age group III.  No other gamefish species were captured. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>STATUS OF THE FISHERY:\nCatches of fish species are diverse, as might be expected, as Big Swan is connected with the North Fork of the Crow River.  Among the gamefish, northern pike are abundant at 7/gillnet.  Growth is average for these II and III year old fish, which are 14-23 inches in length.  Walleye are present in numbers below local catch-rates at 2/gillnet; these are large fish, 19-25 inches in length.  Test netting shows numbers of centrarchids (bluegill and crappies) to be less than catches of other are lakes.  However, observations indicate that crappies are abundant as they are captured in great numbers during under the ice seining operations.  Carp and black bullheads are present in numbers about equal to catch-rates in other area lakes.  Several thousand pounds of carp were removed during seine operations in 1979, but the annual migration of carp from the Crow River probably accounts for the relatively high population.  Shoreline seining reveals that centrarchids seemed to spawn successfully, including largemouth bass.\n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Big Swan is a moderate-sized lake (684 acres) located north of the City of Dassel in Meeker County. A state-owned access with a single cement boat ramp is present on the north shore. Big Swan has six miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 32 feet. The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MNDNR) has divided Minnesota's lakes into 44 different classes based on physical and chemical characteristics. Big Swan is a class 24 lake and other similar lakes in the Hutchinson Fisheries Management Area are Erie and Manuella in Meeker County. Curlyleaf pondweed can be abundant in the shallows in May and June. Water level can fluctuate widely at Big Swan due to the lake's outlet connecting to the nearby North Fork of the Crow River. The river is known to back flow into the lake during flood events. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye were sampled in record high numbers in 2022 (14 fish per gill net), with fish averaging 16 inches in length. The longest Walleye sampled was 26 inches. Walleye were age-1 to age-13 with nine year classes being present. Natural reproduction was substantial in the 2022 assessment; nearly 80% of the walleye gill net catch came from non-stocked years. <br> \n <br> \nModerate numbers of Northern Pike were gill netted this year with fish averaging 23.7 inches in length. Approximately 24% of pike netted were 26 inches or longer. Northern pike regulations were revised at a statewide level beginning in 2018 to better accommodate regional differences in pike habitats and population abundance and size structuring. Three zones were established for northern pike with their own bag and length limit restrictions. In the north-central zone where Big Swan is found, anglers can keep up to 10 northern pike, but no more than two pike larger than 26 inches; and all pike from 22 to 26 inches must be released. This zone regulation is meant to reduce small pike abundance by shifting population size structure back to more medium to large pike. <br> \n <br> \nModerate to high numbers of Black Crappie were netted in 2022. Approximately 10% of the gill net catch was 9 inches or longer, however spring crappie assessments gave a better glimpse at adult Black Crappie size structure.. The longest Black Crappie sampled in summer gill nets was just over 12 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nLow numbers of Yellow Perch were netted and most were small, but a few reached 8 inches in length. Perch play an important role as forage in this lake, in addition to minnow and sucker species from the lake and from the Crow River connection. Moderate numbers of Channel Catfish were captured with fish averaging 19 inches in length and maxing out at almost 28 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nOther fishes that anglers may encounter include Bigmouth Buffalo, Black Bullhead, Bluegill, Bowfin (dogfish), Brown Bullhead, Common Carp, Golden Shiner, Hybrid Sunfish, Largemouth Bass, Shorthead Redhorse, Silver Redhorse, Smallmouth Bass, White Crappie, White Sucker and Yellow Bullhead.   <br> \n <br> \nPeople can have significant impacts on lakes and the fish populations they support. Overharvest, lakeshore development, removal of shoreline vegetation, and introductions of invasive species can all adversely affect fish populations. Aquatic invasive species (AIS) are typically moved from infested to non-infested waters by anglers, boaters and lakeshore owners, and can adversely impact lakes and fish populations. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants and animals from their watercraft and drain all lake water from their boat and bait buckets before leaving the lake. If you suspect an infestation of an invasive species in this lake, save a specimen and report it to a local MNDNR office. Additional information on all of these topics can be found on the MNDNR website (www.dnr.state.mn.us) or by contacting the Hutchinson Area Fisheries office. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A population assessment was conducted on Big Swan Lake in 2013 to monitor the fish population. The lake is primarily managed for Black Crappie, Northern Pike, and Walleye and to a lesser extent for Channel Catfish. <br> \n <br> \nA total of 34 Walleyes were sampled with gill nets for a catch rate of 3.8/net, indicating moderate to high numbers were present. The catch rate in 2007 was 1.4/net. Since 1971, catch rates have varied from 0/net to 13.7/net with an average catch rate of 3.8/net. Gill netted Walleyes were 12.1 to 26.1 inches long with an average length of 16.8 inches. A total of 5 Walleyes ranging from 13.3 to 28.1 inches long were sampled with trap nets for a catch rate of 0.5/net. Fish from both gears ranged from 2 to 16 years old with 10 year-classes present. Overall, 77% of all sampled Walleyes were aged to years in which fingerlings were stocked, with 41% from the 2011 fingerling-stocked year-class alone, though it is unknown if these were a result of stocking, natural reproduction, or a combination of the two. Growth was moderate.  Although natural reproduction has been documented in Big Swan, it appears the latest stocking regime of 2 lbs of fingerlings/littoral acre has resulted in an increase in Walleye abundance. The presence of fish exceeding 25 inches offers anglers a chance at a trophy Walleye.  <br> \n <br> \nA total of 85 Northern Pike were sampled with gill nets for a catch rate of 9.4/net, which was the highest catch rate ever recorded at Big Swan and indicated high numbers were present. The catch rate in 2007 was 2.5/net. Since 1971, catch rates have varied from 0.5/net to 9.4/net with an average catch rate of 4.2/net. Gill netted Northern Pike were 15.9 to 31.4 inches long with an average length of 21.8 inches. A total of 14 Northern Pike ranging from 16.9 to 37.2 inches long were sampled with trap nets for a catch rate of 1.3/net. Fish from both gears ranged from 1 to 6 years old with 6 year-classes present. Age-2 and age-3 fish made up 47% and 29% of the sample, respectively. Growth was fast. <br> \n <br> \nA total of 40 Black Crappies were sampled with trap nets for a catch rate of 3.6/net, which was the lowest since the 1994 sample and indicated low to moderate numbers were present. The 2007 catch rate was 4.8/net. Since 1971, catch rates have varied from 0/net to 100.2/net with an average catch rate of 19.1/net.  Trap netted Black Crappie were 4.6 to 12.2 inches long with an average length of 8.9 inches. A total of 61 Black Crappies were sampled with gill nets for a catch rate of 6.8/net, indicating moderate numbers were present. Lengths ranged from 4.5 to 11.7 inches with an average of 7.5 inches. Fish from both gears ranged from 1 to 5 years old with 5 year-classes present. Age-1 and age-2 fish made up 22% and 40% of the sample, respectively. Growth was fast. <br> \n <br> \nChannel Catfish were the most common fish sampled with gill nets in Big Swan Lake in 2013. A total of 108 were sampled for a catch rate of 12.0/net, which was the most ever sampled in Big Swan Lake. After being introduced and stocked in the late 1980's and early 1990's, and with connectivity to North Fork Crow River, Channel Catfish have become self-sustaining and have increased in numbers in every sample since 1997. Since 1971, catch rates have varied from 0/net to 12.0/net with an average catch rate of 3.5/net. Just one 19.3 inch Channel Catfish was sampled with trap nets for a catch rate of 0.1/net. Fish from both gears ranged from 3 to 13 years old with 11 year-classes present. Age-7 fish made up approximately 31% of the sample. The presence of 11 year-classes suggests consistent annual reproduction and low mortality. The ability of the population to consistently recruit new year-classes coupled with low mortality may be responsible for the ever increasing number of Channel Catfish in Big Swan Lake. <br> \n <br> \nA total of 3 Yellow Perch ranging from 6.1 to 8.7 inches long were sampled with gill nets for a catch rate of 0.3/net, indicating low numbers were present. The catch rate in 2007 was also 0.3/net. Since 1971, catch rates have varied from 0/net to 37.5/net with an average catch rate of 8.1/net.  No Yellow Perch were sampled in trap nets in 2013. The observed decline in Yellow Perch catch rates in Big Swan is consistent with area and statewide trends. The cause of the decline is not yet known but remains an important consideration to future management decisions. <br> \n <br> \nA total of 16 Bluegills ranging from 2.8 to 7.3 inches long were sampled with trap nets for a catch rate of 1.5/net, indicating low numbers were present for the sixth consecutive sample since 1984. Since 1971, catch rates have varied from 0.2/net to 19.3/net with an average catch rate of 3.9/net. An additional 2 Bluegills were sampled with gill nets. Bluegill recruitment and survival are likely limited by the fluctuating water levels and sparse aquatic vegetation in Big Swan Lake. <br> \n <br> \nJust 3 Largemouth Bass up to 15.6 inches long were sampled with both gears in 2013. Like the Bluegill population, the ideal habitat for Largemouth Bass in Big Swan Lake was sparse. <br> \n <br> \nA total of 7 Smallmouth Bass ranging from 10.5 to 16.1 inches long were sampled with gill nets for a catch rate of 0.8/net, indicating moderate to high numbers were present. An additional fish that measured 17.1 inches long was sampled with the trap nets. The only fish aged was one 16.1 inch fish from the gill net sample that was 3 years old. <br> \n <br> \nA single 13.6 inch White Crappie was sampled with gill nets in 2013 after being absent from the 2007 sample. Trap net catch rates have indicated low numbers were present in every sample since 1984. There only appears to be a very small White Crappie population existing in Big Swan Lake. <br> \n <br> \nA total of 7 Black Bullheads were sampled with gill nets for a catch rate of 0.8/net, which was the lowest ever recorded in Big Swan Lake and indicated low numbers were present for the second consecutive sample since 2007. Before the 2007 sample, Black Bullhead gill net catch rates varied from 9.5/net to 109.5/net with an average catch rate of 58.4/net. Since that time, catch rates have dropped to an average of just 1.4/net in the 2007 and 2013 sample. An additional Black Bullhead was sampled with trap nets in 2013. Historically, Black Bullheads were an important forage species in Big Swan Lake and simultaneous decline of both Yellow Perch and Black Bullhead presents a challenge to predator game fish management in Big Swan Lake. <br> \n <br> \nA total of 34 Common Carp were sampled with gill nets for a catch rate of 3.8/net, indicating high numbers were present. The catch rate in 2007 was 9.4/net. Since 1971, gill net catch rates have varied from 0.3/net to 57/net with an average catch rate of 13.0/net. An additional 11 Common Carp were sampled with trap nets. Common Carp continue to be a prominent member of the fish community in Big Swan Lake. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled 2013 include Bigmouth Buffalo, Bowfin, Shorthead Redhorse, Silver Redhorse, White Sucker, Yellow Bullhead, and hybrid sunfish (Lepomis spp.) <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Big Swan Lake outlets to the North Fork Crow River.  During high water events on the N. F. Crow River, the flow can reverse and flow into Big Swan Lake.  This can have significant impacts on the lake.  It is not unusual to see water level fluctuations of several feet within short time periods.  The rivers influence also affects fish populations and species diversity.  Big Swan Lake can be characterized as a turbid lake with little submersed vegetation.  The lack of vegetation and the resulting lack of cover and food production probably limits largemouth bass and panfish populations.An assessment of fish populations was conducted on Big Swan Lake in 1994.  Assessment work included lake survey gillnets, trapnets, shoreline seining and night electrofishing in the spring and fall.  Trotlines were also used during the survey to assess channel catfish populations.  Fish species of particular interest captured in the survey included black crappie, white crappie, bluegill, channelcatfish, largemouth bass, smallmouth bass, northern pike, walleye and yellow perch.  Non-game or forage species of interest included bigmouth buffalo, shorthead redhorse, silver redhorse and johnny darter.The black crappie trapnet catch was below the normal range for this lake class.  The gillnet catch was within the normalrange and above the lake class average.  Two strong age classes (age one and three) accounted for 90% of the sample.  Growth was good, with an average length of 9.6 inches for age three fish.  Past surveys have documented black crappie gillnet catch rates within the normal range.  Trapnet catches have been more variable.  Occasionally Big Swan Lake produces nice catches of large black crappie.  Shore fishing can be productive on the north end near the outlet in the early spring.Only four white crappie were sampled in gillnets, for a catch rate of 0.3 per net.  This is below the normal range for this lake class.  White crappie abundance appears to have decreased from previous surveys.The bluegill trapnet catch was below the normal range for this lake class.  With the exception of the 1984 survey, bluegill trapnet catches have been below the normal range.  Growth was good with an average length of 7.5 inches for age three bluegill.  Bluegill young-of-year (YOY) were sampled while shoreline seining indicating natural reproduction occurred this year.Channel catfish were sampled in gillnets at a rate of 3.3 per net.  Channel catfish sampled in gillnets ranged in length from 12 to 26 inches with an average length of 20 inches.  Trotlines were also used to assess the channel catfish population.  Sixteen channel catfish were sampled with trotlines.  Lengths of channel catfish taken on trotlines ranged from 19 to 26 inches with an average length of 23 inches.  It is not known to what extent, if any that stocking contributes to the channel catfish population.  Channel catfish have not been stocked in Big Swan Lake since 1989, but fish from younger age classes were present in the sample.  Channel catfish may be reproducing in the lake or may bemigrating from the North Fork Crow River.  Anglers report good success for channel catfish.Largemouth bass do not appear to be abundant.  Only one largemouth bass was captured in trapnets during the survey.  Nolargemouth were captured in gillnets.  Night electrofishing was conducted in the spring to assess bass populations.  No largemouth bass were sampled at that time.  Electrofishing at night in the fall sampled eighteen largemouth bass, twelveof which were adult bass.Smallmouth bass are present but are not abundant.  Night electrofishing in the spring captured three smallmouth bassthat ranged in length from 8.1 to 14.4 inches.  No smallmouth bass were captured in gillnets or trapnets during the survey.Northern pike numbers were slightly below the lake class average but within the normal range.  Past surveys have usuallydocumented northern pike numbers within the normal range.  Northern pike captured in gillnets ranged in length from 11.4to 24.5 inches with an average length of 18.4 inches.  Trapnets sampled nine northern pike that ranged in length from 12 to 30.7 inches with an average length of 20.3 inches.  Growth was good with average lengths of 16.7 and 20.4 inches for age one and two fish, respectively.  Similar to other Area lakes, northern pike numbers have rebounded in the past several years with increases in spawning habitat as water levels have returned to normal.The walleye gillnet catch rate of 5 per net was above the lake class average and within the normal range.  This is similar to catch rates documented in past surveys.  Walleye from several age classes were present.  It is not known to what extent stocking or natural reproduction contributes to the walleye population.  Growth was good with average lengths of 17.5 and 19.6 inches for age three and four walleye, respectively.  Anglers report fair to good success for walleye.The yellow perch gillnet catch rate was below the lake class average, but within the normal range.  Past surveys havedocumented wide fluctuations in yellow perch catches on Big Swan Lake.  Nearly 75% of this years catch were age one fish.  Yellow perch ranged in length from 5.2 to 8.3 inches with an average length of 6.2 inches.  Several other species of interest were sampled during the survey.  Five bigmouth buffalo were sampled in gillnets.  Shorthead redhorse were sampled in gillnets and trapnets.  Eight silver redhorse were sampled in trapnets.  These species are not common in most Area lakes and their presence is probably due to the connection to the North Fork Crow River.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Big Swan is a moderate sized Lake (684 acres) located near Kingston, MN in Meeker County.  A state owned access, with a cement boat ramp, is present on the north shore.  Water levels can fluctuate widely on this lake, due to the outlets connection to the North Fork of the Crow River.  Big Swan has 6.31 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 32 feet.  The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has divided Minnesota's lakes into 44 different classes based on physical and chemical characteristics.  Big Swan is a class 24 lake and other similar lakes in the Hutchinson Fisheries Management Area include Belle and Collinwood.   <br> \n <br> \nBig Swan is known to Walleye anglers for pretty good fishing.  Past gill netting assessments, have shown average numbers of Walleye typically being present in Big Swan.  The gill net catch was down in 2020, but the average size was nice (15 inches long).    Historic Northern Pike gill net catch rates have been variable at Big Swan, and numbers were low in 2020, with many fish being on the small to medium side, ranging from 18 to 24 inches in length.  Average numbers of Channel Catfish were netted in 2020, with many being nice sized (18 to 21 inches in length).  Try a frog, some worms, or chicken liver sitting on the bottom, if you are after a Big Swan catfish.  Catfish are excellent on the grill!  Black Crappie gill net catches were low in 2020, but average size was impressive, at 10.4 inches in length.  Crappie anglers may want to try Francis Lake, northeast of Big Swan, for a little faster action.  Historic trap net catches show that Bluegill are not abundant at Big Swan, but occasionally a few large half pounders are encountered by anglers.  The two Bluegill captured in the gill nets were both over 8 inches in length in 2020.  You will likely have to put your time in before you find them gills.  Long and Little Swan Lakes, south of Big Swan, would be better sunfish picks if you are looking for action and a meal of smaller sized fish.  Hardcore bass fishermen don't flock to Big Swan, but a few Largemouth and Smallmouth Bass can be had at this lake, including an occasional lunker.  Historic gill net catches and spring electrofishing assessments indicate that neither of the two bass species are particularly abundant at Big Swan.  Shore anglers may have some luck fishing the large outlet culvert at the north end of the lake.  <br> \n  <br> \nOther species that anglers may encounter, including some typically found in rivers, include Bigmouth Buffalo, Bowfin, Brown Bullhead, Common Carp, Smallmouth Buffalo, Shorthead Redhorse, Silver Redhorse, White Crappie, and White Sucker.  A rare (for this area) Eelpout could also surprise you at Big Swan Lake.    <br> \n <br> \nPeople can have significant impacts on lakes and the fish populations they support.  Over harvest, lakeshore development, removal of shoreline vegetation, and introductions of invasive species can all adversely affect fish populations.  Aquatic invasive species (AIS) are typically moved from infested to non-infested waters by anglers, boaters and lakeshore owners, and can adversely impact lakes and fish populations. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants and animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access.  If you suspect an infestation of an invasive species in this lake, save a specimen and report it to a local DNR office.  Additional information on all of these topics can be found on the DNR website (www.dnr.state.mn.us) or by contacting the Hutchinson Area Fisheries office.  Thanks and good fishing! <br> \n</p>",

A total of 112 YOY were sampled for a catch rate of 112.0 fish/hr of electrofishing, which was the second highest catch rate ever recorded at Big Swan. The 2023 year class was the result of natural reproduction. The average length for the YOY was 6.4 inches, which was below Big Swan's historical average of (7.2 inches). In 2023, 89 yearlings were sampled, for a catch rate of 89.0 fish/hr of electrofishing, which was the highest yearling catch rate on record for this lake. The average length for the yearlings sampled in 2023 was 11.2 inches and was below Big Swan's historic yearling average (12.6 inches). </p>",

In 1984, the gill net catch rate for black crappies was 18.8/lift, and the black bullheads was 48.2/lift.  Low northern pike catch rates may be due to; 1) lack of natural reproduction due to low water; 2) increased numbers of channel catfish; 3) low water levels preventing migration into or out of the lake via Collinwood Creek, and 4) variation in the number of gill net and trap net sets. \n\n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A resurvey was conducted at Big Swan Lake in 2007.  Many pieces of shoreline that were eroding in 2002 had been rip-rapped by 2007.  A drought occurred during the summer of 2007 and the water level at Big Swan was low during the week of netting.  Big Swan is primarily managed for walleye.  \n\nBig Swans watershed was dominated by agriculture.  Approximately 37% of the shoreline was developed with residential homes.  Only 2 types of aquatic vegetation were sampled in early August, and both curly-leaf pondweed and filamentous algae were ranked as rare.  Fluctuating water levels (up to an 8 foot bounce) likely limit many forms of submergent vegetation at Big Swan.  Curly-leaf pondweed had formed surface mats in some areas of the lake by mid-May, but those had broke down by early July.  Sand and silt were classified as abundant shoalwater substrates, while marl, detritus and gravel were ranked as rare.  The secchi disk reading was 2.3 feet in mid-August.\n\nA total of 17 walleye were gill netted for a catch rate of 1.4/net, which indicated that numbers were low.  The catch rate in 2002 was 10.7/net.  Catch rates have been decreasing since the 1997 assessment.  Walleye were 12.4-29.2 inches long averaging 21.1 inches.  Walleye were 2-11 years old with 9 year-classes present.  Growth was fast.  Approximately 41% of the gill net catch corresponded with stocked years.  The current stocking regime (1lb of fingerlings/littoral acre every-other-year) was initiated in 1991.  Gill net catch rates during this regime (2007,2002,1997) ranged from 1.4-13.7/net averaging 11.7/net.  \n\nA total of 30 northern pike were gill netted for a catch rate of 2.5/net, which indicated that only fair numbers were present.  The catch rate in 2002 was 4.4/net.  Catch rates have been decreasing since the 1997 assessment.  Northern pike were 18.4-37.1 inches long averaging 25.8 inches.  Northern pike were 2-5 years old with 4 year-classes present and growth was fast.  \n\nA total of 3 yellow perch were gill netted for a catch rate of 0.3/net, which inidcated that numbers were low.  The catch rate in 2002 was 6.2/net.  Catch rates have been decreasing since the 1997 assessment.  Yellow perch were 8.0-8.7 inches long.  Yellow perch were 3-4 years old with 2 year-classes present.   \n\nA total of 106 channel catfish were gill netted for a catch rate of 8.8/net, which was the highest ever recorded at Big Swan Lake.  The catch rate in 2002 was 5.8/net.  Catch rates have been increasing since the 1997 assessment.  Gill netted channel catfish were10.0-26.3 inches long averaging 19.0 inches.  Trap nets sampled channel catfish up to 27.3 inches in length.  Channel catfish were last stocked in 1994 and are now a self-sustaining population.  Channel catfish were 2-12 years old with 9 year-classes present.  \n\nA total of 251 black crappie were gill netted for a catch rate of 20.9/net, which indicated that high numbers were present.  The catch rate in 2002 was similar at 20.0/net.  In 2007, gill netted black crappie were 5.3-11.9 inches long averaging 8.0 inches.  A total of 57 black crappie were trap netted for a catch rate of 4.8/net, which inidcated that fair numbers were present.  The trap net catch rate in 2002 was 33.5/net, but water levels were higher during that assessment.  In 2007, trap netted black crappie were 6.4-9.1 inches long averaging 8.4 inches.  Black crappie were 1-5 years old with 4 year-classes present.  Age 2 fish accounted for 88% of the gill net catch, suggesting a stronger year-class.\n\nA total of 22 bluegill were trap netted for a catch rate of 1.8/net, which inidcated that numbers were low, but this was typical at Big Swan.  The catch rate in 2002 was 3.7/net.  Bluegill were 3.9-7.5 inches long averaging 6.0 inches.  Bluegill were 1-3 years old with 3 year-classes present.  The lack of submergent plant habitat, throughout much of the summer, likely limits bluegill at Big Swan Lake.\n\nA total of 113 carp were gill netted for a catch rate of 9.4/net, which indicated that high numbers were present.  The catch rate in 2002 was 0.3/net.  In 2007, gill netted carp were 13.4-26.9 inches long.      \n\nA total of 23 black bullhead were gill netted for a catch rate of 1.9/net, which indicated that numbers were low.  The gill net catch rate in 2002 was 59.7/net.  In 2007, black bullhead were 5.8-12.4 inches long.  Trap nets did not sample any black bullhead in 2007.\n\nA total of 9 largemouth bass were sampled during spring night-time electrofishing for a catch rate of 7.2/hour.  Electrofished largemouth bass were 7.1-9.9 inches long averaging 8.5 inches.  Trap nets sampled largemouth bass (4) up to 12.7 inches in length.  Largemouth bass were all age 2, indicating inconsistent recruitment.  The lack of submergent plant habitat likely limits largemouth bass at Big Swan Lake.\n  \nA total of 5 smallmouth bass were sampled during spring night-time electrofishing for a catch rate of 4.0/hour of electrofisher on-time.  Electrofished smallmouth bass were 7.3-9.1 inches long.  Gill nets sampled 3 smallmouth bass ranging in length from 8.5-15.8 inches in length.  Smallmouth bass were 2-3 years old with 2 year-classes present.  \n\nA total of 9 varieties of fish were sampled during shoreline seining.  Young-of-the-year were collected for largemouth bass (4), smallmouth bass (1), yellow perch (2).  Also of interest were johnny darter (6), brook silverside (5), common shiner (3), log perch (1), and spottail shiner (2).\n</p>",

Scales were removed for ageing analysis.  Electrofishing sampled 145 YWAE for a catch rate of 72.5/hour, which was the highest ever recorded at Big Swan.  Historical catch rates from 1994 to 2018 (n=7) ranged from 1.6 to 72.5/hour with an average of 22.2.  The 2018 year class resulted from natural reproduction and would likely be considered moderate to strong in size.  In 2018, the average length for YWAE was 7.9 inches, indicating fast growth for this lake.  A new stocking regime (338,000 fry every other year) was initiated in 2017.  The fry stocked year catch rate (n=1) was 45.9/hour.  From natural reproduction during non-stocked years (n=5) and a fingerling stocked year (n=1), YWAE catch rates ranged from 1.6 to 72.5/hour with an average of 18.2/hour.  The YWAE sampled in 2018 were the result of natural reproduction.  Natural reproduction during skip years was documented 6 out of 6 times (100%) at Big Swan.  In 2018, fall electrofishing sampled 65 YRLWAE for a catch rate of 32.5/hour which may indicate that the 2017 year class (45.9 YWAE/hour) was still moderate to strong in size.  Yearling Walleye catch rates (n=2) ranged from 9.0 to 32.5/hour.  The 2018 YRLWAE average length was 12.4 inches, indicating fast growth.  Age-1 Walleye were 8.9 to 13.8 inches long, while age-2 Walleye were 11.9 to 14.6 inches long at time of capture.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Big Swan Lake, Meeker County, is a 628 acre lake with a maximum depth of 32 feet. A population assessment conducted in 1997 sampled 17 species of fish.  Big SwanLake may be described as a hard-water lake of good fertility and impacted waterquality.  Big Swan is a reservior-type lake, with fluctuating water levels.  Waterclarity as measured by secchi disk depth ranges from 2.5 to 3.0 feet in mid to latesummer.  Adequate dissolved oxygen was sampled to a depth of 5 feet.  The Big SwanLake Association has applied for a grant under the MPCA Clean Water Partnershipprogram.  It has a relatively low diversity of aquatic plants growing in sparsebeds around the lake (1994 survey data).Big Swan Lake is managed primarily as a walleye fishery.  About 340 pounds ofwalleye fingerlings are stocked into Big Swan every other year, in odd numberedyears.  Species such as carp, sucker and buffalo have been commercially harvestedas recently as 1996.  Samples of the fish population were taken in late summerusing gillnets, trapnets and trotlines.  Game fish catches were better thanexpected for this type of lake.Gillnets sampled walleye at the rate of 13.5 per lift. This was well above averagefor lakes like Big Swan, and exceeded catch rates from previous surveys.  Walleyesranged in size from 5.5 to 26 inches, averaging about 15.5 inches long.  Of theadult walleyes sampled, 89.1% were at least 15 inches long, with 20.2% at least 20inches in length.  Northern pike were sampled at the rate of 7.4 per gillnet lift,also above average.  Pike ranged in size from 8.4 to 33 inches, with an averagelength of 19.7 inches.  Of the adults sampled 39.5% were at least 21 inches, withone fish 33 inches long.  Catches of northern pike have varied somewhat over pastsurveys.Gillnets sampled 13.4 yellow perch per lift, below average but within the normalrange.  Trapnets sampled 1.2 per set, also above average but again within normallimits.  Perch ranged in size from 4.5 to 9 inches in gillnets, averaging 6 incheslong.  Black crappies were sampled at a catch rate of 15.8 per gillnet lift and11.3 per trapnet set.  The gillnet catch was above average and the trapnet catchwas below average, but both were within the normal range for lakes of this type. Black crappies ranged in size from 4 to 13 inches, with an average length of about6.9 inches.  Of the adults sampled, 39.4% were at least 8 inches, and 6.3% were atleast 10 inches long.Channel catfish have become a targeted species in Big Swan Lake in recent years. Gillnets caught 13 channel catfish, for a catch rate of 1.3 per lift, whiletrotlines caught 11, for a catch rate of 1.8 per line.  Catch rates were comparableto the 1994 survey, when gillnets sampled 3.3 per lift and trotlines sampled 2 perlift.  Channel catfish ranged from 13 to 26 inches long in gillnets and from 17 to19 inches long on trotlines.  Of the catfish sampled, 95.5% were 16 inches orlonger and 37.5 were 24 inches or longer.Big Swan Lake was sampled for bass by night electrofishing.  The catch rate was 4.8largemouth bass and 3.2 smallmouth bass per hour.  The six largemouth bass rangedin size from 11 to 17 inches, all adults, with 3 fish at least 12 inches and twofish at least 15 inches long.  The four smallmouth ranged from 7 to 14 inches, withthree fish at least 11 inches long.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Big Swan is a moderate sized lake (684 acres) located north of the City of Dassel in Meeker County. Big Swan has 6.3 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 32 feet. A state-owned public access with a cement boat ramp and a fair amount of parking is present on the north shore. Water clarity is variable, often being clearer in the spring and then quite green by mid-summer. Aquatic vegetation is often sparse in abundance at Big Swan, except in May and June when curlyleaf pondweed can be abundant in the shallows. Water levels can fluctuate greatly following high rainfall events at this lake, due to the outlet's close connection to the North Fork of the Crow River and subsequent back flowing into Big Swan Lake. A spring trap netting survey was conducted during May 2022. Trap nets were used to target Black Crappie and Bluegill. Spring trap net data should not be compared to historical summer trap net data as summer nets often do a poor job of representatively sampling Bluegill. <br> \n <br> \nLow numbers of Bluegill were collected, and fish averaged 7 inches in length. The longest Bluegill captured was 8.6 inches. Anglers seeking to catch Bluegill may want to try a different lake, as numbers at Big Swan appear to be on the low side. Marginal habitat (low amounts of submergent vegetation in July and August) is likely a limiting factor resulting in poor reproduction and survival of Bluegill at Big Swan Lake. <br> \n <br> \nModerate to high numbers of Black Crappie were collected, averaging 8.5 inches in length. The longest Black Crappie collected was just over 14 inches.  Approximately 22% of the Black Crappie sampled were 9 inches or longer, indicating that fair numbers of keeper-sized fish were present. Anglers may also encounter a few White Crappie and Hybrid Crappie at Big Swan. The longest Hybrid Crappie sampled was just under 15 inches in length. <br> \n <br> \nPeople can have significant impacts on lakes and the fish populations they support. Over harvest, lakeshore development, removal of shoreline vegetation, and introductions of invasive species can all adversely affect fish populations. Aquatic invasive species (AIS) are typically moved from infested to non-infested waters by anglers, boaters and lakeshore owners, and can adversely impact lakes and fish populations. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants and animals from their watercraft and drain all lake water from their boat and bait buckets before leaving the lake. If you suspect an infestation of an invasive species in this lake, save a specimen and report it to a local DNR office.  Additional information on all of these topics can be found on the DNR website (www.dnr.state.mn.us) or by contacting the Hutchinson Area Fisheries office. <br> \n</p>",

A total of 170 YOY were sampled for a catch rate of 170.0/hour, which was the highest catch rate ever recorded at Big Swan and was within the lake's historical fourth quartile (53.0 to 170.0). The 2022 year class appears strong in abundance. In 2022, the mean length for YOY was 5.5 inches, which was within Big Swan's historical first quartile (<= 6.6), indicating slow growth (within the first quartile) for this lake. The 2022 YOY mean length was the shortest on record. In 2022, 8 yearlings were sampled, for a catch rate of 8.0/hour, which was within Big Swan's historical first quartile (<= 9.0) and was the lowest yearling catch rate on record. The mean length for the 2022 yearling was 13.6 inches, which was within Big Swan's historic fourth quartile (> 13.5), indicating fast age-1 growth for this lake. The 2022 year class appeared abundant at the end of the first growing season but may not recruit to adulthood if the small average size compromises their ability to survive their first winter. Followup assessments will shed light on the fate of the 2022 year class.</p>",

Walleye were a primary management species at Big Swan.  Electrofishing sampled 92 YWAE for a catch rate of 45.9/hour, which was the highest ever recorded at Big Swan.  Historical catch rates from 1994 to 2017 (n=6) ranged from 1.6 to 45.9/hour with an average of 13.8.  The 2017 year class would likely be considered moderate in size.  In 2017, the average length for YWAE was 6.5 inches, likely indicating moderate growth.  A new stocking regime (338,000 fry 1 in 2 years) was initiated in 2017, to determine if the Walleye population could be maintained or possibly be enhanced through fry stocking.  Fry will be stocked in 2019 and 2021.  The previous stocking regime was 676 pounds of fingerlings every other year.  The fry stocked year catch rate (n=1) was 45.9/hour.  Natural reproduction YWAE catch rates ranged from 1.6 to 15.2/hour with an average of 7.4/hour.  It was undetermined whether the YWAE sampled in 2017 were the result of natural reproduction, the fry stocking, or some combination of both.  Natural reproduction, during non-stocked years, was documented 5 out of 5 times (100%) at Big Swan.  In 2017, electrofishing sampled 18 YRLWAE for a catch rate of 9.0/hour which may indicate that the 2016 year class was weak.  The 2017 YRLWAE average length was 13.3 inches, indicating fast growth.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A standard survey was conducted at Big Swan in 2016 to monitor the lake's fish population.  A total of 18 species, plus Hybrid Sunfish, were sampled in the gill nets, trap nets, and by spring night-time electrofishing.  The lake was stratified, on 8/08/16, with the dissolved oxygen concentration falling below 2 mg/l at 18', limiting fish usage of deep water.  Water clarity was poor with a secchi disk reading of 2.5 feet, due to an algae bloom.  Curlyleaf Pondweed was abundant in the southern basin and the shallows along the west shore during spring night-time electrofishing sampling in May.  Anglers may need to adjust their tactics when fishing around this aquatic invasive species, until it dies back in late June.   <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled moderate to high numbers of Northern Pike (77) for a catch rate of 8.6/net, which was above the normal range for this type of lake, or what we would expect from lakes similar to Big Swan Lake.  The 2013 catch rate was similar at 9.4/net.  Net catches in 2013 and 2016 were the two highest ever measured at Big Swan.  Historic catch rates from 1971 to 2016 (n=11) were variable, ranging from 0.5 to 9.4/net with an average of 4.6.  Historically, recruitment could be classified as low (0-4.9/net) at Big Swan, but recent catch rates indicated that Northern Pike numbers could be on the increase.  In 2016, gill netted Northern Pike were 16.9 to 32.6 inches long with an average of 21.6.  Approximately 49% of the gill net sample was 21 inches or longer while 11% were 28 inches or longer, indicating a quality size structure.  Northern Pike were age-1 to age-6, with five year classes being present.  Age-1 and age-2 fish were well represented accounting for 39% and 45% of the gill net aged fish, respectively.  Growth would be considered moderate or fast.     <br> \n   <br> \nTrap nets sampled low numbers (27) of Black Crappie for a catch rate of 2.5/net, which was within the normal range for lakes similar to Big Swan.  The 2013 catch rate was also low (3.6/net).  Catch rates from 1971 to 2016 (n=12) were highly variable, ranging from 0.0 to 100.2/net with an average of 17.8.  Trap netted Black Crappie were 2.4 to 11.0 inches long with an average of 7.2.  Approximately 22% of the trap net catch was 9 inches or longer.  Gill nets sampled low numbers of Black Crappie (56) for a catch rate of 6.2/net, which was within the normal range for this type of lake.  The 2013 gill net catch rate was similar (6.8/net).  Catch rates from 1971 to 2016 (n=11) were variable, ranging from 0.0 to 34.0/net with an average of 14.2.  Gill netted Black Crappie were 5.6 to 13.6 inches long with an average of 8.1.  Approximately 32% of the gill net sample was 9 inches or longer, indicating a quality size structure.  Black Crappie (all gears) were Age-0 to age-5, with six year classes present.  Age-1 fish were most abundant, accounting for 62% of the gill net sample.  This data also indicated inconsistent recruitment in recent years.  Growth was fast.  Extreme water level fluctuations, could explain the high variability in trap nets catches over the decades, likely indicating that gill nets provide more reliable data on Black Crappie at Big Swan.    <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled high numbers of Walleye (79) for a catch rate of 8.8/net, which was above the normal range for lakes similar to Big Swan.  Walleye were the most abundant fish sampled by gill nets in 2016.  The 2013 catch rate was much lower (3.8/net).  Catch rates from 1971 to 2016 (n=11), under various stocking regimes, were variable ranging from 0.0 to 13.7/net with an average of 4.3.  In 2016, gill netted Walleye were 12.5 to 25.8 inches long with an average of 16.5.  Approximately 70% of the gill net catch was 15 inches or longer, indicating a quality size structure.  Walleye were age-2 to age-15 with eight year classes present.  The 2014 year class was ranked as strong, accounting for 50% of the gill net catch and may have been the result of the large fall yearlings (1.3/pound) stocked in 2015.  The 2013 year class was also strong, making up 37% of the gill net catch and could have resulted from the fingerlings (45/pound) stocked that year.  All other year classes were considered to be weak.  Growth was fast.  The current stocking regime (676 pounds of fingerlings every other year) was initiated in 2009.  Additional yearlings were stocked in 2011 and only yearlings were stocked in 2015 due to fingerling shortages.  Non-stocked year classes (n=6), age-1 to age-15, in the stocking regimes accounted for 4% of gill net aged walleye.  The contribution from natural reproduction during stocked years (fingerling/yearling) was unknown, indicating that natural reproduction or immigration was occurring.  Gill net catches during the latest stocking regime (2013 and 2016) ranged from 3.8 to 8.8/net with an average of 6.3.  The lake's connection to the North Fork of the Crow River, and possible immigration of river Walleye, makes it difficult to properly evaluate Walleye stocking and natural reproduction at Big Swan.  Higher numbers of Northern Pike, in 2013 and 2016 (average of 9.0/net), may be negatively affecting Walleye recruitment at Big Swan. <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled high numbers of Channel Catfish (70) for a catch rate of 7.8/net.  The 2013 catch rate was 12.0/net.  Historic catch rates, from 1971 to 2016 (n=11), were variable, ranging from 0.0 to 12.0/net with an average of 3.9.  In 2016, Channel Catfish were 13.5 to 27.5 inches long with an average of 19.8.  Approximately 93% of the gill net catch was 15 inches or longer, indicating a quality size structure.  The gill net size distribution indicated that multiple year classes were present.  Channel Catfish were last stocked in 1994, indicating that the population is now 100% sustained by natural reproduction.  A connection to the North Fork of the Crow River allows this species to move into and out of Big Swan freely.  Channel Catfish are easy to catch and their white flesh is tender and juicy.  They can also be filleted, just like a Walleye. <br> \n <br> \nTrap nets sampled low numbers of Bluegill (62) for a catch rate of 5.6/net which was below the normal range for lakes similar to Big Swan.  The 2013 catch rate was also low (1.5/net).  Catch rates from 1971 to 2016 (n=12) were mostly low, ranging from 0.2 to 19.3/net, with an average of 4.0.  Eleven out of twelve of the historic trap net catch rates were below the normal range for this classification of lake.  In 2016, trap netted Bluegill were 1.5 to 8.3 inches long with an average of 4.3.  Approximately 3% of the catch was 7 inches or longer, indicating a poor size structure.  Gill nets sampled fish up to 8.4 inches in length.  Bluegill were not aged, but size distribution data indicated that multiple year classes were present.  Recruitment was inconsistent.  Widely varying water levels may limit trap netting efficiency (especially low water years), at Big Swan.  As in past years, marginal submergent vegetation habitat was likely limiting Bluegill at Big Swan.       <br> \nSpring night-time electrofishing sampled low numbers (8) Largemouth Bass for a catch rate of 6.4/hr.  The 2007 catch rate was similar (7.2/hr.).  Catch rates (n=4) from 1994 to 2016 were all low, ranging from 0.0 to 7.2/hr. with an average 4.6.  Largemouth Bass were 10.1 to 17.4 inches long with an average of 11.8.  Largemouth Bass (electrofished and trap netted) were age-1 to age-6 with four year classes present.  Growth was fast.  Data indicated inconsistent recruitment for this species.  Largemouth Bass were likely not doing well for the same reasons that the Bluegill were not flourishing (marginal submergent vegetation habitat).   <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled low numbers (6) of Smallmouth Bass for a catch rate of 0.7/net, which was within the normal range for this type of lake.  The catch rate in 2013 was similar (0.8/net).  Catch rates from 1971 to 1994 (n=6) were all 0 and catch rates from 1997 to 2016 (n=5) ranged from 0.1 to 0.8/net with an average of 0.4.  That data also indicated an upward trend in abundance over the last 20 years at Big Swan, although numbers were still considered to be low.  Gill netted fish were 9.6 to 19.4 inches long with an average of 13.5.  Smallmouth Bass (all gears) were age-1 to age-7 with three year classes present.  Smallmouth Bass were not sampled during spring night-time electrofishing.   <br> \n   <br> \nGill nets sampled low numbers of Yellow Perch (25) for a catch rate of 2.8/net, which was within the normal range for this type of lake.  The 2013 catch rate was also low (0.3/net).  Catch rates from 1971 to 2016 (n=11) were highly variable ranging from 0.0 to 37.5/net with an average of 7.6.  Yellow Perch were 5.5 to 8.5 inches long with an average of 6.7.  Approximately 23% of the catch was 8 inches or longer.  Yellow Perch scales were not aged.    <br> \n <br> \nTrap nets sampled high numbers of Common Carp (60) for a catch rate of 5.5/net, which was well above the normal range for this type of lake.  Historic catch rates (n=12) from 1971 to 2016 were highly variable, ranging from 0.1 to 37.0/net with an average of 6.3.  Trap netted Common Carp were 11.5 to 29.9 inches long with an average of 19.8.  Gill nets sampled high numbers of Common Carp (40) for a catch rate of 4.4/net, which was also above the lake's normal range.  Historic gill net catch rates were mostly high, ranging from 0.3 to 57.0/net with an average of 12.2.  Gill netted Common Carp were 11.6 to 26.1 with an average of 19.3.  Size distribution data indicated that multiple year classes were present.  High numbers of Common Carp, over the last 45 years, have likely had significant negative impacts on submergent plant abundance and water quality in Big Swan Lake.  Common Carp would likely be difficult to control due to the highly connected watershed that Big Swan was part of. <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled low numbers (11) of Black Bullhead for a catch rate of 1.2/net, which was below the normal range for lakes similar to Big Swan.  The 2013 catch rate was 0.8/net.  Historic catch rates from 1971 to 2016 (n=11) were highly variable, ranging from 0.8 to 109.5/net with an average of 42.8.  Gill netted Black Bullhead were 5.6 to 14.5 inches long with an average of 8.4.  Trap nets sampled low numbers (2) of Black Bullhead for a catch rate of 0.2/net which was below the lake's normal range.  Trap netted Black Bullhead had an average length of 6.2 inches.  In recent years, some area lakes have experienced declines in Black Bullhead abundance and a similar shift seems to have occurred at Big Swan (2007 to 2016 time period).  Since 2007, the average gill net catch rate (1.3/net) was much lower than the average from the 1971 to 2002 time period (58.4/net).  The exact cause of this shift was unknown, but could be related to increasing numbers of predatory Channel Catfish. <br> \n <br> \nAdditional species sampled in the standard gear included; Bigmouth Buffalo, Bowfin, Green Sunfish, Hybrid Sunfish, Pumpkinseed Sunfish, Shorthead Redhorse, Silver Redhorse, White Sucker, and Yellow Bullhead. <br> \n</p>",
