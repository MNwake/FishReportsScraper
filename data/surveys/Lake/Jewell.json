The Summer Homes Road comes within 100 yards of Jewell Lake.  This road is located on USFS land but is gated and requires permission for entry. An old portage trail exists between Ojibway Lake and Jewell Lake however the portage has not been maintained in recent years.\n\nJewell is a small (9 acre), former stream trout lake with clear water and a maximum depth of 55 feet.  It was stocked regularly with rainbow trout and twice with brook trout between 1959 and 1972. Fishing pressure apparently was light and, therefore, when the access road was gated, stocking was discontinued.  Jewell is currently home to a low density northern pike population comprised of small fish.\n\nIn 2012, a total of nine northern pike were caught in three experimental gill nets for a catch rate of 3.0/net.  This was the same catch rate recorded during the last assessment in 1990.  In 2012, pike lengths ranged from 19.1 to 25.0 inches with an average length of 21.8 inches.  Aging indicated that growth was slow.  The only other fish species caught during the assessment was fathead minnow.\n\n </p>",
