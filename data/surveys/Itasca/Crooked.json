                "narrative": "<p>Crooked Lake is in ecological lake class 25 and is located approximately 12 miles north of Coleraine, in the Mississippi River Watershed.  The lake is 418 acres and has a maximum depth of 60 feet.  A survey targeting nearshore fish species was conducted by Area staff on 7 July, 2015.  Ten sampling sites (100 feet long) were evenly spaced around the lake shore, sampling a variety of habitat types.  Each site is sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-ft or 15-ft 1/8th inch mesh seine, depending on habitat condition. <br> \n <br> \nShoreline seining (15-ft seine) and backpack electrofishing was completed at all 10 sites.  Nearshore sampling captured a total of 16 different species; 12 species by seining and 10 species by backpack electrofishing.  The species can be found in the gear-specific catch tables in this report. <br> \n <br> \nNearshore catches will be used with the gill net and trap net data from the standard survey conducted on 24 August, 2015, to calculate a fish-based Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) score which is indicative of lake health.  The surveys will assist the watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Crooked Lake is 418 acres and is located 9 miles north of Marble, MN.  The lake is part of the Prairie River system and has experienced wide fluctuations in water levels.  Bog stain reduces water clarity to around 6 ft and low phosphorous levels indicate low productivity.  The lake is managed for walleye, northern pike and panfish.  Walleye gill-net catch indices have fluctuated in the past and the abundance in 1999 was 0.8/set which is slightly below the expected range for similar lakes.  Walleye gill-net abundance has fluctuated in the past from 0.4 to 3.7/set.  Size structure was moderate with a few fish over 18 inches sampled.  Walleye growth was similar to the statewide average with fish reaching 19 inches in 6 years.  Because most walleye in a lake greater than 19 inches are females, and it takes at least 6 years to replace a fish of this size, anglers should consider releasing walleye greater than 19 inches.Although walleye fry were stocked in 1990 and 1992 and fingerlings were stocked in 1991 and 1989, none of these year classes were sampled in this assessment.  Natural reproduction accounted for all of the fish sampled in this assessment.  Extensive historical stocking has yielded mixed results.  Previous assessments have suggested that poor spawning habitat and water level fluctuations likely limit walleye reproduction in Crooked Lake, however, walleye spawning conditions are favorable in the Prairie River and migration of walleye occurs between Crooked Lake and the Prairie River.  As with many riverine walleye lakes, populations in Crooked Lake likely peak in the springtime related to spawning movements and decrease throughout the year.Northern pike gill-net catch was 6.0/set which is within the expected range for similar lakes.  Size structure was excellent with a few fish exceeding 34 inches.  Growth was similar to the statewide average and fish reach preferred length of 28 inches in 7 years.  Northern pike are an aggressive predator and can easily be over harvested by anglers.   Exploited northern pike populations exhibit increased abundance and poor size structure with few fish reach quality size.  To prevent over harvest, anglers should consider releasing fish greater than 24 inches.    Black crappie gill-net catch was 3.9/set which is higher than the expected range for similar lakes.  Size structure was poor with no fish exceeding 10 inches.  Growth was slightly slower than the statewide average with fish reaching 9 inches in 5 years.  Bluegill trap-net catch was 9.8/set which is within the expected range for similar lakes.  Size structure was poor with no fish exceeding 8 inches.  No growth information is available for this assessment.A single largemouth bass was sampled in gill nets.  Routine summer assessments do not sample largemouth bass effectively, therefore little information is available for largemouth bass during this assessment.  It appears, however, that largemouth bass are not abundant in Crooked Lake.Yellow perch gill-net abundance was 4.6/set which is within the expected range for similar lakes.  Size structure was poor with most fish between 5 to 6 inches and no fish larger than 9 inches.Other fish sampled include bowfin, pumpkinseed sunfish, shorthead redhorse, tullibee, white sucker, tadpole madtom, and yellow bullhead.Lakeshore owners may affect fish populations not only through fishing, but also through land use practices.  It is important to leave a 30 to 50 ft buffer of native vegetation along the shoreline to prevent lawn wastes and sediments from entering the lake.  In addition, if fertilizers must be used, lakeshore owners should use a brand containing no phosphorus.  Nonfunctioning septic systems can also lead to water quality problems.  Good water quality and fish populations are the direct result of good land use practices.   </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Crooked Lake is a 418 acre lake located 8 miles north of Marble, MN and is connected to the Prairie River system.  Crooked Lake has a maximum depth of 60 feet and moderately stained water (5.7 ft transparency).  Crooked Lake is managed primarily for northern pike and walleye.The northern pike gill-net catch rate in 2005 was within the normal range and similar to the previous assessment at 4.4/net.  The sample was dominated by age 2, 3 and 4 fish (84% of the sample) and size structure was modest.  Gill-net sampled pike varied in length from 14.0 to 38.0 inches with an average length of 21.3 inches.  Growth was similar to the statewide average.The walleye gill-net catch was below the lake class normal range but similar to previous assessments at 0.9/net.  Since 2001, walleye fingerlings (as well as some yearlings and adults) have been stocked every third year at 1 lb./littoral acre.  Ages 2, 3, 4 and 8 were represented in the 2005 sample, with 4 of the 8 walleye (50%) attributed to stocked years.  Fish in the 2005 sample varied in length from 10.0 to 23.4 inches, with an average length of 14.5 inches.  Growth was similar to the statewide average.As in the previous survey, net catches of black crappie were above the normal range for both gill nets and trap nets.  Catch rates were 2.8 and 4.0/net for gill nets and trap nets, respectively.  Size structure was fairly poor; black crappie from gill nets had an average length of 7.4 inches, while those from trap nets had an average length of 6.5 inches.  Growth rates were below the statewide average for ages 1-3, and similar to the statewide average for ages 4 and 5.The trap-net catch rate for bluegill (7.7/net) was near the low end of the expected range, but similar to previous assessments.  Size structure was poor; fish in the sample varied from 3.2 to 10.0 inches in length with an average length of 5.0 inches.  The gill-net catch rate for yellow perch (8.4/net) was near the lake class median and the highest on record.  Catch rates in previous assessments have generally been low but within the normal range.  The gill-net catch rate for tullibee similar to recent assessments at 0.7/net, but considerably lower than catches in the 1970's. Other species sampled in test nets include: pumpkinseed sunfish, rock bass, shorthead redhorse, white sucker and yellow bullhead.   </p>",

The lack of any perch over eight inches was probably due to northern pike predation.  The black crappie size structure appears adequate and approximately half of the fish were of acceptable size for anglers.  The walleye sample was inadequate to draw any conclusions.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Crooked Lake is a class 23 lake located 8 miles north of Marble, MN and is within the Mississippi River watershed.  Crooked Lake has a surface area of 418 acres, a littoral area of 104 acres (25%) and a maximum depth of 60 feet.  Secchi disk transparency, which is a standard measure of water clarity, was 7.5 feet, and has ranged from 3.1 - 9.0 feet in previous surveys.  The Prairie River flows through the northwest corner of the lake.  There are two public accesses on the lake.  A state owned access is located on the northwest shore along Co. Rd. 336, and a County owned access is located on the southwest shore along Co. Rd. 8.   <br> \n <br> \nThe 2006 Lake Management Plan (LMP) lists Northern Pike and Walleye as primary species for management and Black Crappie and Bluegill as secondary species.  The LMP goals were to increase the Walleye gill-net catch to 2.5 per net and maintain the Northern Pike gill-net catch at the lake mean of 3.8 per net.  <br> \n <br> \nA standard survey was conducted in August of 2015 utilized 9 gill nets and 9 trap nets to obtain current information on the fish population.   <br> \n <br> \nThe Northern Pike gill-net catch rate decreased from 4.4/net in 2005 to 1.8/net, and was below the expected range for similar lakes (3.1 - 8.5) for the first time since 1992, and met the management goal.  Northern Pike gill-net catch rates have varied from 1.0 - 7.0/net in previous surveys.  Northern Pike from gill nets ranged from 11.7 - 34.1 inches with a mean length of 20.9 inches.  Northern Pike averaged 19.2 inches at age 5, which is below the statewide average.  Five age classes were represented in the sample.   <br> \n <br> \nThe Walleye gill-net catch rate increased from 0.9/net in 2005 to 2.2/net.  The catch  was within the ecpected range for similar lakes lakes (1.3 - 5.5) for the first time since 1988, and near the management goal of 2.5/net.  Walleye gill-net catch rates have been below this range in 8 of 10 surveys.  Walleye from gill nets ranged from 8.5 inches to 18.6 inches with a mean length of 16.4 inches.  Walleye attained averaged 13.8 inches at age 4, which is comparable to the statewide average.  Five consecutive age classes (age 1-5) were represented in the sample.  Walleye fingerlings are currently stocked at a rate of one pound/ littoral acre (104 lbs.) every third year.  Walleye natural reproduction has been well documented in previous surveys, and 70% of the walleye aged in the 2015 survey were from non-stocked years, suggesting that the population is maintained by natural reproduction.   <br> \n <br> \nThe Black Crappie gill-net catch rate decreased slightly from 2.8 /net in 2005 to 1.9 /net, but remained within the expected range for similar lakes (0.5 - 2.7).  Black Crappie gill-net catch rates have varied from 1.5 - 6.0/net for the last 8 assessments.  Black Crappie from gill nets ranged from 5.6 - 11.2 inches with a mean length of 7.6 inches.  Reproduction appears consistent as 6 consecutive age classes (age 2 - 7) were sampled.  Black Crappie growth rates were similar to the statewide average with a mean length of 8.3 inches at age 5.  Few Black Crappie over 10 inches were sampled in this, or previous, surveys.  <br> \n <br> \nThe Bluegill trap-net catch rate increased from 7.7/net in 2005 to 10.2/net. The catch was the highest observed for the lake, but remained within the lake class range (5.6 - 42.3).   Bluegill from trap nets ranged from 3.0 - 9.1 inches with a mean length of 5.0 inches.  Seven consecutive age classes (age 2 - 8) were represented in the sample.  Bluegill growth rates exceeded the lake class average with a mean length of 6.3 inches at age 5. <br> \n <br> \nThe Yellow Perch gill-net catch rate decreased from 8.4 per net in 2005 to 3.1/net, but remained within the expected range for similar lakes (2.5 - 24.2).  Yellow perch gill-net catch has varied from 0.8 - 8.4/net in previous assessments. Yellow perch from gill nets ranged from 5.4 - 7.1 inches. <br> \n <br> \nThe Tullibee gill-net catch rate decreased from 0.7/net in 2005 to 0.4/net, and was below the expected range for similar lakes (0.7 - 6.5) for the first time.  Tullibee gill net catches have shown a nearly steady decline since 1970 when the gill-net catch was 21.8 per net.   <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass have been sampled in low numbers in only 4 of 10 surveys. Two Largemouth Bass were sampled in 2015, one in a trap net and one in a gill net.  <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled included: Rock Bass, Shorthead Redhorse, Silver Redhorse, White Sucker and Yellow Bullhead.   <br> \n <br> \nCrooked Lake is not known to support invasive species.  Anglers and boaters are reminded to help stop the spread of invasive species by removing all aquatic plants from boats, trailers and equipment.  All drain plugs must be removed and live and bait wells must be drained before leaving the access.  Anglers and boaters are encouraged to power wash and thoroughly dry all equipment prior to use in another water body. <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n</p>",
