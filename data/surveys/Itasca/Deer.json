                "narrative": "<p>Deer Lake has historically been managed as a walleye lake but it also supports an excellent population of smallmouth bass and muskellunge.     The walleye gill net catch has exceeded the lake class median of 6.6/set in three of the six assessments that have been conducted on the lake since 1948.  Walleye were captured at  a gill net catch of 7.5/set in this assessment with an average length of 15.5 inches and an average weight of 1.3 pounds.  Two and four year old walleyes made up 66% of the catch.  These two years, 1991 and 1993, were both fingerling stocked years.            Northern pike, although never abundant in Deer Lake, have generally been of quality size.  Although northerns were sampled at only 0.7/gill net, the mean weight was 3.7 pounds.  These fish ranged in length from 18.3-34.3 inches.       The lake supports an excellent population of quality muskellunge.  Although only four muskellunge were caught in this netting, summer assessments are ineffective at sampling this species.  A 1993 spring assessment sampled 176 muskies and 76% of those fish werer greater than 36 inches.     The smallmouth bass population remains in excellent condition with a gill net catch of 4.1/set in this assessment.  The average weight of those fish was 1.6 pounds.  Although this catch was the second highest ever recorded for this lake, the average size of the smallmouth was the largest recorded.     Yellow perch abundance has remained similiar to that observed in past assessments.  Rock bass and bluegill have shown increases, however.  This and the 1990 assessment sampled these species at much higher rates than what was observed in the past.  The reasons for the increase is unclear.     The fish population in Deer Lake appears to be in excellent condition.  Good numbers of smallmouth and muskellunge are present and quality continues to improve.  The increasing acceptance of catch and release for both species may, at least in part, be responsible for this improvement.  Walleye abundance also continues to be at acceptable levels.  Although natural reproduction of this species occurs on Deer Lake it appears that walleye fingerling stocking continues to make a significant contribution to this fishery.    </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Deer Lake is a native Muskellunge lake that was stocked eight times with Shoepack strain fish and once with a Wisconsin strain from 1965 to 1985.  Though natural reproduction has maintained the population since 1985, there have been unintended genetic consequences of the stockings that persist still today.  Genetic ancestry assignments for all Muskellunges sampled in 2017 will be completed, compared to prior ancestry data, and eventually incorporated into the Lake Management Plan (LMP).  The LMP identifies Muskellunge as a primary management species with a goal to maintain a spring adult Muskellunge estimate of 0.2 fish/acre with 45% longer than 42 inches, through natural reproduction.  The spring targeted Muskellunge survey was conducted to evaluate if the management goals were being met and to collect genetic information. <br> \n <br> \nSpring Trap Net Survey <br> \n <br> \nMuskellunge are difficult to sample using the standard summer netting methods because they exist at such low densities.  Consequently, surveys targeting Muskellunge in the spring, when they are concentrated in the warming, shallow water to spawn, are necessary to capture a better sample.  Twenty large-frame trap nets (LTN) were set on April 18 and were fished until May 5.  Twice during the survey the nets were either collapsed or left to fish two days due to strong winds and below freezing temperatures.  All Muskellunge were measured for length and weight, gender was determined, and scales were collected for genetic analysis.  A PIT (Passive Integrated Transponder) tag was implanted just below and in front of the dorsal fin on the left side.   <br> \n <br> \nA total of 169 different Muskellunge (one Hybrid) were sampled and there were an additional 19 recaptures.  The length distribution of the sampled Muskellunge suggests fairly consistent recruitment.  The 85 males ranged from 27.8 to 43.5 inches and had a mean length of 37.0 inches.  The 83 females ranged from 31.9 to 51.3 inches and had a mean length of 43.4 inches.  Only 31% of the sample was 42 inches or longer so the LMP goal was not attained.  Males averaged 12.1 pounds while females averaged 23.3 pounds.  The adult average weight used for estimating adult biomass was 17.7 pounds. <br> \n <br> \nSpring Electrofishing and Population Estimates <br> \n <br> \nMuskellunge were sampled using electrofishing beginning the day the LTNs were removed.  The goal of the sampling was to obtain a ratio of marked to unmarked Muskellunge in order to calculate an adult population estimate.  Electrofishing catch rates should not be used for any comparisons because the sampling methodology was not and was never intended to be standardized.  All fish were released after the data were collected. <br> \n <br> \nThe marked population consisted of 164 adult Muskellunge caught in the trap nets.  The estimate was based on 38 fish sampled by electrofishing, of which 20 had been previously marked in the trap nets.  The estimate for adult Muskellunge was 305 fish, with 95% confidence that the population was between 211 and 399 fish.  The estimate translates into one adult Muskellunge for every 13.4 acres (0.07 fish/acre) and approximately 1.32 pounds/acre.   <br> \n <br> \nThe 2017 estimate was somewhat lower than expected and did not attain the LMP goal of 0.2 adults/acre; however, it is unclear if the goal was realistic for Deer Lake.  Methods for sampling and estimating Muskellunge have improved since the first targeted survey in 1981 and with these improvements the LMP goals will reflect more realistic expectations for a species that is difficult to sample.  Deer Lake is deep, clear and relatively unproductive lake so all fish species tend to be lower than lakes with more productivity.  Deer Lake remains popular with Muskellunge anglers even though the population appears low.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Deer Lake is in ecological lake class 22 and is located 5 miles northeast of Deer River, MN, in the Mississippi River Watershed.  The lake is 4,097 acres and has a maximum depth of 121 feet.  A survey targeting nearshore fish species was conducted by Area fisheries staff beginning on 17 July, 2023.  Twenty-four sampling sites (100 feet long) were evenly spaced around the lake shore, sampling a variety of habitat types.  Each site is sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-ft or 15-ft 1/8th inch mesh seine, depending on habitat condition. <br> \n <br> \nShoreline seining was conducted at 21 sites using the 15-ft seine (2 sites) and 50-ft seine (19 sites).  Backpack electrofishing was completed at all 24 sites.  Nearshore sampling captured 24 different species: 21 species by seining and 19 species by backpack electrofishing.  The species can be found in the gear-specific catch tables in this report. <br> \n <br> \nNearshore catches will be used with the gill net and trap net data from the standard survey conducted on 24 July, 2023, to calculate a fish-based Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) score which is indicative of lake health.  The surveys will assist the watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Deer Lake is a 4,097 acre lake located northeast of Deer River, Minnesota.  There is one public access on the southwest part of the lake.  There were 373 homes or cabins counted during the 2005 survey, indicating moderate to high shoreline development.  The 2002 lake management plan indicated muskellunge, smallmouth bass and walleye as the primary species of management with northern pike and largemouth bass as secondary species.Muskellunge are difficult to sample with our standard sampling methods.  In the 2005 survey, only one muskellunge was sampled in the gill nets and two in the trap nets.  The most recent spring muskellunge assessment was conducted in 2003.  Spring netting conditions were ideal for sampling muskellunge since the weather was relatively stable and water temperatures progressively increased.  Of the 339 muskellunge captured (1.7/net) in the 199 trap nets, 72 were recaptures.  The population was estimated at 600 fish or about one fish for every seven acres.  The fish ranged from 26 to 50 inches with 79% being 42 inches or less.Walleye catch rates have fluctuated considerably since the first assessment in 1948.  The lowest catch rate was 2.3 fish/net in 1975 and the highest catch of 13.3 fish/net occurred in 1984.  In 2005, the catch was 8.1 fish/net, which was above average for this type of lake.  The catch did not attain the aggressive management goal of 11 walleye/gill net.  However, the catch rate was good considering stocking in an effort to meet the new goal only began in 2001.  Prior to 2000, one of the goals of our stocking regime was to allow for evaluation of natural reproduction.   Due to the large, deep nature of the lake, spring water temperatures increase slowly, resulting in delayed production of zooplankton relative to shallow, darker lakes.  As a result, it appears walleye fry do not have sufficient food to survive after hatching.  Therefore, fingerling walleye stocking would be required to provide a fishable population.The walleye population appeared to be in good condition based on the size and age structures sampled.  Walleye from 9.8 to 28.2 inches were sampled and they averaged 15.2 inches.  Eight year classes were identified by scale and opercle analysis.  The 2003 (54%) and 2001 (30%) year classes represented the majority of the fish sampled and both corresponded to stocked years.  Walleye growth was good with four year old fish averaging 16.3 inches.  Growth was similar to statewide averages for all ages.Largemouth bass were sampled with spring electrofishing in 1995, 2000, and 2005.  Catch rates have increased substantially from 2.2 fish/hr in 1995 to 45.0 fish/hr in 2005.  In 2005, the sampled fish ranged from 5.1 to 13.9 inches and averaged 9.8 inches.  Six year-classes were sampled from two to seven years old.  Three and four year old fish represented 82% of the sample.  Growth was poor compared to the statewide averages.Smallmouth bass were also sampled with spring night electrofishing in 1995, 2000, and 2005.  Catch rates followed a similar trend as for largemouth bass.  From 1995 to 2005, the smallmouth bass electrofishing catch increased from 17.3 fish/hr to 55.9 fish/hr.  In 2005, the fish ranged from 3.9 to 18.6 inches and had a mean length of 8.9 inches.  Eight year classes were sampled from two to nine years old.  Fish from two to four years old represented nearly 81% of the sample.  Growth was slower than statewide averages for all ages.Northern pike net catch rates have always been low when compared to similar lakes.  The highest catch rate of 1.1 fish/net occurred 1948 and 1984.  In 2005, the catch was 0.5 fish/net.  Low northern pike numbers frequently results in good size distributions.  Northern pike ranged from 23.8 to 34.6 inches and averaged 27.4 inches.  Five year classes were identified by age analysis ranging from three to eight years old.  Growth was fast compared to the statewide average.  Northern pike averaged 26.3 inches after four years of growth.  The black crappie population has always been low and will likely remain low due to the lack of suitable habitat.  Black crappie were only sampled by trap nets once between 1948 and 1990 and were first sampled by gill nets in the 2000 assessment.  Black crappie gill-net and trap-net catch rates were both 0.7 fish/net in 2005.  Both gears sampled black crappie near the lake class average.  The fish ranged from 7.2 to 11.8 inches for the combined gears.  Three year classes were identified from age 3 to age 6, with age-3 fish representing 90% of the sample.  Growth was similar to the statewide average.Bluegill were seldom sampled prior to the 1990 population assessment (0.2 to 2.7 fish/trap net).  Bluegill catch rates have increased substantially beginning in 1990 with a catch of 21.0/net, followed by 23.9/net in 1995, 10.5/net in 2000, and 32.0/net in 2005.  Bluegill catch rates have been near or above the lake class average of 15.3 fish/net in the last four assessments.  Bluegill lengths ranged from 3.2 to 8.0 inches, with an average of 5.4 inches.  Six year classes were sampled from two to seven years old.  Age-4 and age-6 fish each represented 35% of the sample.  Growth was slow compared to other lake similar to Deer Lake.Tullibee, due to their pelagic nature, are difficult to sample with our standardized, summer  assessments.  As a result, tullibee catch rates are generally low but they can be highly variable.  In 1948, the catch was 11.2 fish/net but in the next assessment in 1975 none were captured.  In 1980, 8.6 tullibee/net were sampled but in the next five assessments the highest catch was 0.3 fish/net.  None were sampled in 2005.  Anecdotal information indicates there is an abundance of tullibee in the lake and the sampling methodology has not accurately reflected the population.The yellow perch population has been relatively stable, ranging from a low of 11.8 fish/net in 1948 to a high of 32.2 fish/net in 2005.  Yellow perch lengths ranged from 5.5 to 11.4 inches and averaged 7.9 inches.  Seven year classes were sampled in 2005 indicating consistent reproduction.  Growth was slow compared to the statewide averages.  Yellow perch are probably more important within the Deer Lake fish community as a prey source than as a species desired by anglers.Other species observed during the lake survey included banded killifish, blacknose shiner, bowfin, brassy minnow, common shiner, creek chub, hybrid sunfish, Iowa darter, Johnny darter,  lake whitefish, logperch, pumpkinseed sunfish, rock bass, spottail shiner, and white sucker.In order to maintain or improve fish and wildlife populations, water quality and habitat must be protected.  People often associate water quality problems with large-scale agricultural, forestry, urban development or industrial practices in the watershed.  In reality, the impact of land use decisions on one lake lot may be relatively small, yet, the cumulative impact of those decisions on many lake lots can result in a significant decline in water quality and habitat.  For example, removing shoreline and aquatic vegetation, fertilizing lawns, mowing to the water's edge, installing beach sand blankets, failing septic systems and uncontrolled run-off, all contribute excess nutrients and sediment which degrade water quality and habitat.  Understanding these cumulative impacts and taking steps to avoid or minimize them will help to insure our quality fisheries can be enjoyed by future generations.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Deer Lake is located northeast of Deer River, Minnesota.  There is one public access on the southwest part of the lake.  There were 373 homes or cabins counted during the last full survey, indicating moderate to high shoreline development.  The 2018 lake management plan (LMP) indicated Muskie, Smallmouth Bass and Walleye as the primary species of management with Northern Pike as a secondary species.  The LMP goals include maintaining the Walleye catch near 9.6/net, a spring electrofishing catch of 30 Smallmouth Bass/hr, and a spring Muskie estimate of 0.15 adults/acre with 45% greater than or equal to 42 inches by natural reproduction. <br> \n <br> \nA standard survey was conducted in late July to assess the fish community and evaluate Walleye stocking.  A total of 15 gill nets and 15 trap nets were used in the survey.  Bass were sampled using night electrofishing in the spring. <br> \n <br> \nMuskie are difficult to sample with standard summer survey methods because they exist at such low densities.  Spring sampling of Muskie in the shallows during the spawning period is the best method for evaluating the population.  The last Muskie survey was completed in 2017.  In the 2023 standard survey, one Muskie was sampled in the gill nets and none in the trap nets.  The sampled fish was a 44.9 inch female estimated to be 12 plus years old.  It was tagged as a 35.7 incher during the spring of 2017 survey. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike catches have always been low on Deer Lake due to a lack of suitable habitat.  The highest catch of 1.6 fish/net occurred in 2017.  The 2023 catch was 1.0 fish/net.  Low pike numbers frequently result in good growth and size structure.  The sampled pike ranged from 19.7 to 37.2 inches and averaged 25.3 inches.  Six year-classes were identified with fish from age 2 to age 9 present.  Growth was fast compared to statewide averages for the first five years then average thereafter.  Northern Pike averaged 25.2 inches after four years of growth.   <br> \n <br> \nBass have been sampled with spring, night electrofishing six times from 1995 to 2023.  The Largemouth Bass population appears to have expanded from a very low level prior to the mid-1990s.  Catch rates increased from 2.2 fish/hr in 1995 to 45.0 fish/hr in 2005 but fluctuated at lower levels since 2005.  The catch rate was 37.0 fish/hr in 2023.  In 2023, the sampled fish ranged from 5.2 to 16.9 inches and averaged 9.7 inches.  Largemouth Bass over 16 inches were not aged.  Five year-classes were sampled from age 2 to age 8.  The 2020 year-class dominated the sample (77%).  Growth was similar to the statewide average.   <br> \n <br> \nSmallmouth Bass catches have followed a similar trend as Largemouth Bass.  From 1995 to 2005, the Smallmouth Bass electrofishing catch increased from 17.3 fish/hr to 55.9 fish/hr, moderated in 2012 and 2017, and then peaked at 90.0 fish/hr in 2023.  The 2023 catch exceeded the LMP goal of 30 fish/hr.  The sampled fish ranged from 2.8 to 20.3 inches and averaged 12.2 inches.  Smallmouth Bass over 16 inches were not aged.  Of the smaller fish, seven year-classes from 1 to 7 years old were sampled.  The population has experienced consistent and good recruitment in recent years.  Growth was somewhat slow but not surprising for the population density and lake productivity.  Smallmouth Bass fishing opportunities are better in Deer Lake than Largemouth Bass based on numbers and size. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye catch rates have fluctuated considerably since the first survey in 1948.  The lowest catch was 2.3 fish/net in 1975 while the highest was 13.3 fish/net in 1984.  In 2023, the catch of 6.1 fish/net was near the average for the lake but fell short of the aggressive management goal.  Walleye from 7.5 to 25.5 inches were sampled and averaged 17.6 inches.  Twelve year-classes were identified by scale and otolith analysis.  Age-2 through 4 fish represented 63% of the sample.  Walleye averaged 16.9 inches after four years of growth.  Growth was good compared to statewide averages.  The Walleye population should continue to provide good angling opportunities over the next few years. <br> \n <br> \nThe Black Crappie population has always been low and will likely remain low due to the lack of suitable habitat.  Black Crappie were only sampled by trap nets once from 1948 to 1990 and were first sampled by gill nets in the 2000 assessment.  Black Crappie were not sampled in gill nets and only four were sampled in trap nets in 2023.  The four sampled fish ranged from 10.9 to 12.6 inches.  Anglers who find the crappies will likely experience good fishing for quality fish but they are encouraged not to overharvest this smaller population. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill were seldom sampled prior to the 1990 survey (0.2 to 2.7 fish/trap net).  Bluegill catches have increased substantially in 1990 to 21.0/net.  Bluegill catch rates have consistently been near or above 15.0 fish/trap net in the last six surveys.  The catch of 22.9 fish/trap net in 2023 was the third highest ever recorded.  The sampled fish ranged from 3.4 to 8.9 inches and averaged 6.2 inches.  The size distribution will likely discourage most anglers from seeking Bluegill in Deer Lake. <br> \n <br> \nTullibee are difficult to sample with our standardized, summer survey methods because they often suspend over deep water.  As a result, catch rates are generally low but can be highly variable.  For example, the highest catch of 11.2 fish/gill net occurred in 1948 but none were sampled in the next survey (1975).  Likewise, in 1980, 8.6 fish/net were sampled but in the next seven surveys, the highest catch was 1.0 fish/net.  The oxygen/temperature profile in 2023 revealed that well-oxygenated, cool water was higher in the water column than normal for late July.  As a result, the overlap of the favorable thermal habitat and standard net locations likely contributed to the highest catch (3.3/net) since 1980.  The sampled fish ranged from 8.1 to 15.1 inches and averaged 11.5 inches.  Tullibee are an important prey species for predators like Muskie, Northern Pike, and Walleye. <br> \n <br> \nLake Whitefish also pose a challenge to sample because of the deep, open water they inhabit during the summer.  Consequently, limited information exists on the population in Deer Lake.  Whitefish catches have always been very low prior to 2023.  Similar to the Tullibee catches, it appears the thermal habitat conditions in the summer were favorable for sampling whitefish in 2023.  A total of 17 whitefish were captured for a catch rate of 1.1/net.  The sampled fish ranged from 13.6 to 27.2 inches and averaged 19.1 inches.  Six year-classes ranging from age 3 to 22 were observed.  Fish averaged 15.6 inches after four years of growth. <br> \n <br> \nThe Yellow Perch population has been relatively stable in Deer Lake.  The 2023 catch of 10.5 fish/gill net was the lowest on record, yet not alarmingly low.  The sampled fish ranged from 5.9 to 10.2 inches and averaged 7.6 inches.  Perch are probably more important within the fish community as a prey source than as a species desired by anglers. <br> \n <br> \nOther species observed during the survey included Bowfin, Pumpkinseed Sunfish, Rock Bass, White Sucker, and Yellow Bullhead. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers and boaters are reminded to help slow the spread of invasive species by removing all aquatic plants from boats, trailers and equipment.  All drain plugs must be removed and live/bait wells drained before leaving the access.  Anglers and boaters are also encouraged to power-wash and thoroughly dry all equipment prior to use in another water body.</p>",

Tullibee size has historically been small.Commercial removal of suckers has not significantly changed their numbers and appear to be at acceptable levels now.Rock bass abundance has steadily increased.  Bluegill and pumpkinseed abundance have increased by approximately 10 times from previous high levels in 1948 trap net sampling.Largemouth bass have increased although size has fallen.  Smallmouth bass has increased with good size and age distribution.The population of northern pike has been relatively constant over the years being well below medians and at tolerable levels for muskellunge management.Walleye abundance was relatively high in the 1948 survey but dropped until the early 1980's when fingerling stocking from the late 1970's began to be recruited.  Abundance in 1990 has declined from 1984 but falls near lake class medians now.  Most year classes represent fingerling and yearling stocked years.  The average size has increased.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Deer Lake, located just north of Grand Rapids, MN, is known as a walleye lake but also has an excellent population of muskellunge and smallmouth bass.  Walleyes in this assessment varied in length from 5.9-25.8 inches.  The average walleye in the gill nets was 15.8 inches and weighed 1.4 pounds.  Of the 77 walleye aged, 62 (81%) were from the fingerling stocked year of 1997.  Growth was excellent, exceeding the statewide averages for age 2 and 3 walleye.     The lack of spawning habitat for northern pike is reflected in the low catches historically observed in past assessments.  Quality, however, has been excellent.  Although sampled at only 0.8/gill net, northerns in this assessment averaged 4.6 pounds.  They varied in length from 22.8-38.6 inches and averaged 28.2 inches. Typical of lakes with low density and an excellent and diverse forage base, growth was excellent.     Yellow perch abundance has historically fluctuated around the lake class median of 17.1/gill net.  The catch of 26.7/gill net in this assessment was the highest recorded.  This coincides with a period of reduced walleye stocking (2 of the previous 7 years).     Deer Lake has experienced an increase in bluegill and rock bass in the past years.  Rock bass, although always sampled above the lake class 3rd quartile (6.6/gill net), were sampled at 25.3/gill net in 2000.  Down slightly from the 1995 assessment.  Bluegill have also increased in the past years.   Down from the highs in 1990 and 1995, bluegill were sampled at 10.5/trap net.  The reasons for the recent increases in abundance are not clear.     Tullibee and whitefish are also present in Deer Lake.  Although sampled in relatively low numbers in this assessment, sampling of both species can be highly variable due to their pelagic, schooling nature.     The smallmouth bass population remains in excellent condition with a gill net catch of 2.5/gill net.  The average length of those fish was 13.5 inches.  Only two smallmouth bass (<0.1/gill net) were sampled in the first 1948 survey.     Summer population assessments are not effective at evaluating muskellunge populations.  In the 1998 spring trap netting assessment, 140 muskellunge (0.42/trap net) or 0.42/acre were sampled.  Quality of the muskellunge has improved substantially from only 7.5% > 40 inches of those sampled in 1981 to 22.6% in 1998.     The fish population in Deer Lake appears to be in excellent condition.  Good numbers of smallmouth bass and muskellunge are present and quality continues to improve.  The increasing acceptance of catch and release for both species may, at least in part, be responsible for this improvement.  Walleye abundance appears to largely be the result of fingerling stocking.  Although natural reproduction occurs in Deer Lake, it is not enough to maintain a satisfactory fishery.                 </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Deer Lake is a 4,000 acre lake located northeast of Deer River, Minnesota.  There is one public access on the southwest part of the lake.  There were 373 homes or cabins counted during the 2005 survey, indicating moderate to high shoreline development.  The 2013 lake management plan (LMP) indicated Muskellunge, Smallmouth Bass and Walleye as the primary species of management with Northern Pike as a secondary species.  The LMP goals include maintaining the Walleye catch near 11.0 fish/net, maintain a spring electrofishing catch rate of 30 Smallmouth Bass/hr of sampling, and maintain a spring adult Muskellunge estimate of 0.2 fish/acre with 45% > 42 inches.  A standard survey (15 gill nets 15 trap nets) was conducted in late July to assess the fish community.  Spring electrofishing was also conducted to sample bass.  <br> \n <br> \nMuskellunge are difficult to sample with the standard survey methods because they exist at such low densities.  In April of 2017, a survey targeting Muskellunge in the shallows during the spawning period was conducted to evaluate the population and those results are presented in a separate report.  In the 2017 standard survey, four Muskellunge were sampled in the gill nets and none in the trap nets.  The sampled fish ranged from 19.0 to 43.3 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike catches in Deer Lake have always been lower than lakes with similar habitat.  The highest catch of 1.6 fish/net occurred in 2017.  Low Northern Pike numbers frequently result in good size distribution.  The sampled fish ranged from 19.9 to 30.4 inches and averaged 23.8 inches.  Five year-classes were identified with fish from age 2 to age 6 present.  Age-3 fish represented 58% of the sample.  Growth was fast compared to statewide averages and fish averaged 23.8 inches after four years.   <br> \n <br> \nBass numbers have increased in most area lakes within the last few decades.  The trend apparently is not limited to local lakes, since other parts of the state and other Upper Midwest states have experienced similar results.  Regional weather patterns that include earlier springs and longer growing seasons appear to favor bass reproduction and survival.   <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass were sampled with spring night electrofishing five times from 1995 to 2017.  Catch rates increased substantially from 2.2 fish/hr in 1995 to 45.0 fish/hr in 2005 but declined to 10.1 fish/hr in 2017.  In 2017, the sampled fish ranged from 5.8 to 16.0 inches and averaged 11.5 inches.  Seven year-classes were sampled from two to 10 years old.  No one age-class dominated the sample.  Growth was poor compared to the statewide average and five year old fish were only 11.2 inches. <br> \n <br> \nSmallmouth Bass catches followed a similar trend as Largemouth Bass.  From 1995 to 2005, the Smallmouth Bass catch increased from 17.3 fish/hr to 55.9 fish/hr but moderated to 28.3 and 41.9 fish/hr in 2012 and 2017.  The 2017 catch exceeded the LMP goal of 30 fish/hr.  Lengths ranged from 3.1 to 20.4 inches and averaged 11.2 inches.  Eleven year-classes from 1 to 11 years old were sampled with age-2 fish representing 31% of the sample.  Growth was somewhat slow but not surprising for the population density and lake productivity. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye catch rates have fluctuated considerably since the first survey in 1948.  The lowest catch was 2.3 fish/net in 1975 while the highest was 13.3 fish/net in 1984.  In 2017, the catch of 10.3 fish/net was above average for Deer Lake and approached the aggressive management goal of 11.0 fish/net.  Walleye from 7.6 to 22.3 inches were sampled and the mean length was 14.4 inches.  Twelve year-classes were identified with age-2 and 3 Walleye representing 66% of the sample.  Walleye growth was good with age-4 fish averaging 16.0 inches.  The Walleye population appeared to be doing well. <br> \n <br> \nThe Black Crappie population has always been low due to the lack of shallow, protected habitats.  Black Crappie were only sampled by trap nets once from 1948 to 1990 and were first sampled by gill nets in 2000.  In 2017, catch rates were 0.3 fish/net for both gill nets and trap nets.  The sampled fish ranged from 9.5 to 11.9 inches for the combined gears.  Age and growth information was not collected in this survey. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill were seldom sampled prior to the 1990 population assessment (0.2 to 2.7 fish/trap net).  Catches increased beginning in 1990 to 21.0/net and have been near or above the average for the lake type (15.3 fish/net) in the last five surveys.  The catch was 15.1 fish/net in 2017.  Bluegill lengths ranged from 3.4 to 8.8 inches and averaged 5.6 inches.  Age and growth information was not collected in this survey. <br> \n <br> \nTullibee are difficult to sample with our standardized survey gear because they frequently suspended over deep water during the summer.  As a result, catch rates are generally low but can be highly variable.  In 1948, the catch was 11.2 fish/gill net but in the next survey in 1975 none were captured.  In 1980, 8.6 fish/net were sampled but in the next five surveys the highest catch was 0.3 fish/net.  No Tullibee were sampled in gill nets in 2005, only four in 2012, while 15 were sampled in 2017.  The sampled fish ranged from 10.4 to 15.2 inches and averaged 12.5 inches.  In addition to the lack of higher catches in nearly 40 years, reports of anglers not finding the large schools of open water prey (likely Tullibee) like they used to may suggest a decline in the population.   <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch catches have been relatively stable, fluctuating from a low of 11.8 fish/net in 1948 to a high of 32.2 fish/net in 2005.  In 2017, the catch of 13.6 fish/gill net approached the average for lakes like Deer Lake.  The sampled fish ranged from 5.8 to 11.4 inches and averaged 7.8 inches.  Age and growth information was not collected in this survey.  Yellow Perch are probably more important within the fish community as a prey source than as a species desired by anglers. <br> \n <br> \nOther species observed during the population assessment included Bowfin, Lake Whitefish, Pumpkinseed Sunfish, Rock Bass, and White Sucker. <br> \n <br> \nIn order to maintain or improve fish and wildlife populations, water quality and habitat must be protected.  People often associate water quality problems with large-scale agricultural, forestry, urban development or industrial practices in the watershed.  In reality, the impact of land use decisions on one lake lot may be relatively small, yet the cumulative impact of those decisions on many lake lots can result in a significant decline in water quality and habitat.  For example, removing shoreline and aquatic vegetation, fertilizing lawns, mowing to the water's edge, installing beach sand blankets, failing septic systems and uncontrolled run-off, all contribute excess nutrients and sediment which degrade water quality and habitat.  Understanding these cumulative impacts and taking steps to avoid or minimize them will help to insure our quality fisheries can be enjoyed by future generations.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Deer Lake is a class 22 lake located northeast of Deer River, Minnesota.  There is one public access on the southwest part of the lake.  There were 373 homes or cabins counted during the 2005 survey, indicating moderate to high shoreline development.  The 2006 lake management plan indicated muskellunge, smallmouth bass and walleye as the primary species of management with northern pike as a secondary species.  The 2012 assessment also included sampling of near shore fish species in order to calculate an Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) score. <br> \n <br> \nMuskellunge are difficult to sample with our standard sampling methods.  In the 2012 assessment, only one muskellunge was sampled in the gill nets.  The most recent spring muskellunge assessment was conducted in 2003.  Spring netting conditions were ideal for sampling muskellunge since the weather was relatively stable and water temperatures progressively increased.  Of the 339 muskellunge captured (1.7/net) in the 199 trap nets, 72 were recaptures.  The population was estimated at 600 fish or 0.15 fish/acre.  The fish ranged from 26 to 50 inches with 79% being 42 inches or less. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye gill-net catch rates have fluctuated considerably since the first assessment in 1948.  The lowest catch rate was 2.3 fish/net in 1975 and the highest catch of 13.3 fish/net occurred in 1984.  In 2012, the gill-net catch was 12.9 fish/net, which exceeded the 3rd quartile value of 9.6 fish/net.  The catch exceeded the aggressive management goal of 11 walleye/gill net.  The walleye population appeared to be in good condition based on the size and age structures sampled.  Walleye from 7.8 to 27.6 inches were sampled and they had a mean length of 14.1 inches.  Ten year-classes were identified by scale, opercle, and otolith analysis.  Age-1 through 4 walleye dominated the sample, representing close to 90% of the total.  Walleye growth was good with age-4 fish averaging 18.8 inches.  Mean back-calculated length-at-ages were similar to statewide averages for all ages. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass were sampled with spring night electrofishing four times from 1995 to 2012.  Catch rates had increased substantially from 2.2 fish/hr in 1995 to 45.0 fish/hr in 2005 but declined to 15.5 fish/hr (on-time) in 2012.  The sampled fish ranged from 6.7 to 16.1 inches and had a mean length of 11.2 inches.  Nine year-classes were sampled from two to 10 years old.  No one age-class dominated the sample.  Growth was poor compared to the statewide averages.   Mean back-calculated lengths were below 15% of the statewide average. <br> \n <br> \nSmallmouth bass were also sampled with spring night electrofishing four times from 1995 to 2012.  Catch rates followed a similar trend as for largemouth bass.  From 1995 to 2005, the smallmouth bass electrofishing catch increased from 17.3 fish/hr to 55.9 fish/hr but declined to 28.5 fish/hr (on-time) in 2012.  Gill nets can often sample smallmouth bass quite effectively depending on the lake.  In 2012, 85 fish were sampled for a catch of 5.7/gill net.  The gill-net sampled fish ranged from 5.1 to 19.1 inches and had mean length of 14.0 inches.  The spring electrofishing sample ranged from 4.6 to 19.5 inches and had a mean length of 12.0 inches.  Age and growth information was only collected during the spring electrofishing sample.  Ten year-classes were sampled from two to 11 years old with age-2 fish representing nearly 28% of the sample.  Growth was slower than statewide averages for all ages. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike gill-net catch rates have always been below the lake class 1st quartile of 3.0 fish/net.  The highest catch rate of 1.1 fish/net occurred in 1948 and 1984.  In 2012, the gill-net CPUE was 0.3 fish/net.  Low northern pike numbers frequently results in good size structure.  Northern pike ranged from 15.4 to 27.2 inches and had a mean length of 20.0 inches.  Age and growth information was not collected in this assessment.   <br> \n <br> \nThe black crappie population has always been low and will likely remain low due to the lack of suitable habitat.  Black crappie were only sampled by trap nets once from 1948 to 1990 and were first sampled by gill nets in the 2000 assessment.  Black crappie gill-net and trap-net catch rates were both 0.7 fish/net in 2005.  In 2012, the gill-net and trap-net catches were 0.7 and 0.1 fish/net.  Black crappie ranged from 6.3 to 11.2 inches for the combined gears.  Age and growth information was not collected in this assessment. <br> \n <br> \nBluegills were seldom sampled prior to the 1990 population assessment (0.2 to 2.7 fish/trap net).  Bluegill catch rates have increased substantially beginning in 1990 with a catch of 21.0/net.  In the four assessments since 1990, the trap-net catch has fluctuated from 10.5 to 32.0/net.  The catch was 16.8 fish/net in 2012.  Bluegill catch rates have been near or above the lake class median of 15.3 fish/net in the last five assessments.  Bluegill lengths ranged from 3.6 to 8.0 inches, with a mean of 6.0 inches.  Age and growth information was not collected in this assessment.   <br> \n <br> \nTullibees, due to their pelagic nature, are difficult to sample with our standardized, summer assessments.  As a result, tullibee catch rates are generally low but they can be highly variable.  In 1948, the gill-net catch rate was 11.2 fish/net but in the next assessment in 1975 none were captured.  In 1980, 8.6 tullibee/net were sampled but in the next five assessments the highest catch was 0.3 fish/net.  None were sampled in gill nets in 2005 and only four were sampled in 2012.  Anecdotal information indicates there is an abundance of tullibee in the lake and the sampling methodology has not accurately reflected the population. <br> \n <br> \nThe yellow perch population has been relatively stable remaining between the 1st and 3rd quartile values for all assessments.  In 1948, the catch was 11.8 fish/gill net (lowest on record), and catches have gradually increased to 32.2 fish/gill net (highest on record) in 2005.  In 2012, the catch declined to 10.7 fish/gill net.  Yellow perch lengths ranged from 5.8 to 11.5 inches and had a mean length of 8.1 inches.  Age and growth information was not collected in this assessment.  Yellow perch are probably more important within the fish community as a prey source than as a species desired by anglers. <br> \n <br> \nOther species observed during the population assessment included bowfin, hybrid sunfish, lake whitefish, pumpkinseed sunfish, rock bass, white sucker.  Additional species observed during IBI sampling included banded killifish, blackchin shiner, blacknose dace, bluntnose minnow, brook stickleback, central mudminnow, common shiner, Iowa dater, Johnny darter, least darter, logperch, longnose dace, mottled sculpin, and spottail shiner. <br> \n <br> \nIn order to maintain or improve fish and wildlife populations, water quality and habitat must be protected.  People often associate water quality problems with large-scale agricultural, forestry, urban development or industrial practices in the watershed.  In reality, the impact of land use decisions on one lake lot may be relatively small, yet the cumulative impact of those decisions on many lake lots can result in a significant decline in water quality and habitat.  For example, removing shoreline and aquatic vegetation, fertilizing lawns, mowing to the water's edge, installing beach sand blankets, failing septic systems and uncontrolled run-off, all contribute excess nutrients and sediment which degrade water quality and habitat.  Understanding these cumulative impacts and taking steps to avoid or minimize them will help to insure our quality fisheries can be enjoyed by future generations.</p>",
