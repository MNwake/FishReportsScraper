THE BLACK CRAP- PIE WAS ALSO QUITE HIGH AT 33.75 PER SET WITH A MEDIAN LENGTH OF 8.0 - 8.4. THE BROWN BULLHEAD WAS HIGH AT 16.50 PER SET WITH A MEDIAN LENDTH 7.0 - 7.4, THE BROWN BULLHEAD  WAS HIGH AT 12.75 PER SET WHILE THE BLACK BULLHEAD, YELLOW BULLHEAD, PUMP- KINSEED, HYBRID SUNFISH AND WALLEYE ALL HAD LOW POPULATION FIGURES.
