As in 1991, five species were collected: walleye, smallmouth bass, northern pike, yellow perch, and white sucker.  The number of walleye caught per gill net was the highest so far in Dick Lake, but was in the normal range for lakes of this class.  Lengths were well distributed between 7 and 27 inches, and seven year-classes were found.  Growth rates had been faster than average.  Walleye reached 12 inches by age 3, and 19 inches by age 6.The number of smallmouth bass caught per gill net was the lowest observed so far in Dick Lake, but was in the normal range for lakes of this class.  Average size was the highest to date, but in the normal range for lakes of this class.  Seven year-classes were identified.  Growth rates had been average for the area.  Mean lengths had been 9.7 inches at the end of the third year, and 14.5 inches at the end of the fifth year.For northern pike, the number per gill net and average size were in the same range as in previous population assessments, and within the normal range for lakes of this class.  Ages 1-4 were identified.  Northern pike reached 16 inches by age 2, 19 inches by age 3, and 21 inches by age 4.The number of yellow perch caught was similar in 2002 and 1991, and was in the normal range for lakes of this class.  The average size was greater than in 1991, and slightly above average for lakes of this class.  Most were 7.5-10.5 inches long.The number of white sucker caught per gill net was high for Dick Lake, but was low relative to lakes of this class.  Most were 16-19 inches long.All fish were naturally reproduced.  Yellow perch appear to be the primary forage fish available to game fish.  No minnows were collected in minnow traps.</p>",
