Brook trout were stocked in 1995 and 1996 to try to establish a brook trout fishery.  Prior to the brook trout stockings the lake contained various minnow species.  Test nets in 1997 determined that unsuitable conditions exist for brook trout at some point in the year, as there was little evidence of their survival.  Test nets sampled only one 6.5 inch brook trout.  No further management for brook trout will be attempted.</p>",
