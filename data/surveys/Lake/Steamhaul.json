Access is by gravel road (3.1 miles) and then a 200 yard walk on a trail.  The trail is on private land; however, an easement agreement with the property owner allows the public to access the lake through this trail.The 2004 assessment sampled brook trout in relatively high numbers.  The brook trout ranged from 8.9 to 13 inches with most of the fish between 10 and 11.5 inches.  All were from a May 2004 stocking of 2000 yearlings.The assessment did not capture any splake although they had been stocked the preceding year.  It is possible splake were present, but were not collected in the sampling gear; however, that would have been unusual.One small bluegill (5.7 inches) was collected in the assessment.  This species was never collected in this lake before and most likely was illegally introduced.  Bluegill and most other fish species are undesirable species in a lake managed for stream trout since they compete with trout for the available forage.</p>",

The fish population is comprised of splake, brook trout and various minnow species.  Test nets in 1997 found splake and brook trout abundance about average when compared to other trout lakes in this lake class in the Finland Management Area.  Brook trout averaged 12.4 inches with a maximum length of 13.9 inches recorded.  Normally the large brook trout in lakes are three year old fish, however due to stocking cycles there were none in Steamhaul Lake at the time of the assessment.  Brook trout yearlings are stocked every other year.     The splake averaged 13.8 inches with a maximum length of 15.0 inches recorded.  Splake are stocked in years opposite of brook trout stocking.</p>",
