                "narrative": "<p>No-ta-she-bun Lake (also known as Willow Lake) is a 238 acre lake in southwest Itasca County in the Mississippi River watershed.  The lake is located approximately 8 miles northeast of Remer, MN off State Hwy 6.  The most recent lake management plan lists northern pike, walleye and largemouth bass as primary management species, with black crappie listed as a secondary management species. <br> \n <br> \nThe northern pike gill-net catch in 2011 was 5.7/net.  This catch rate is similar to the lake class average and the previous assessment.  Sampled pike had a good size structure, ranging from 18.4 to 36 inches, with a mean length of 24.6 inches.  Ages 2 - 6, and 8 were present in the sample, and growth was faster than the statewide average.  Pike reached 24.8 inches at age 4. <br> \n <br> \nThe walleye gill-net catch was at the lake class first quartile of 1.3/net.  Catches in previous assessments have ranged from 0 to 3.7/net.  Walleye fingerlings and/or yearlings were stocked every other year from 2001 through 2007.  Walleye frylings were stocked in 2008 and 2010 as part of a statewide project to evaluate various densities of fryling stocking.  All eight walleye captured in 2011 corresponded to stocked year classes, however eight of the previous ten years would be considered stocked years.  The frylings stocked in 2008 and 2010 were chemically marked with OTC to differentiate between stocked fish and naturally produced fish.  Only one walleye from the 2011 sample corresponded to an OTC-marked year (2008), and that fish did not have a mark.  This indicates at least some of the walleye in No-ta-she-bun Lake are the result of natural reproduction.  Sample size was inadequate to calculate size structure indices, but walleye ranged from 13.3 to 25.4 inches, with a mean length of 20.4 inches. <br> \n <br> \nThe gill-net catch rate for black crappie was in the expected range at 2.7/net.  Sampled crappie had a good size structure ranging from 4.8 to 12.4 inches, with a mean length of 9.3 inches.  Ages 2-4, 6 and 7 were represented in the sample and growth was similar to the statewide average.  Black crappie averaged 8.7 inches at age 4. <br> \n <br> \nThe gill-net catch for largemouth bass was similar to the lake class average at 0.7/net.  Night electrofishing for bass was not conducted in 2011, but electrofishing assessments in 1996 and 2000 both indicated an abundant population of bass, with most fish less than 15 inches. <br> \n <br> \nThe trap-net catch for bluegill was similar to the lake class average at 16.6/net.  Catches have varied from 4.5 to 41.7/net in historical assessments.  The 2011 sample had a poor size structure; fish ranged from 3.2 to 8.7 inches, with a mean length of 5.5 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nThe gill-net catch for yellow perch was below the expected range at 1.8/net.  Catches of perch have been very low in the last two assessments.  Yellow perch are an important prey species for walleye and northern pike. <br> \n <br> \nTullibee, another important prey species, were not sampled in 2011.  No tullibee have been captured in No-ta-she-bun since 1991. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled in test nets included pumpkinseed sunfish, hybrid sunfish, rock bass, golden shiner, white sucker and yellow bullhead.  Near-shore IBI (index of biotic integrity) sampling with seines and backpack electrofishing also sampled nine other non-game/minnow species. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>No-ta-she-bun Lake, also known as Willow Lake, is located about eight miles northeast of Remer, MN.  The lake borders the Chippewa National Forest, but most of the shoreline is in private ownership.  There is a state-administered access on the northwest shore along with a state rest area.  There are no defined inlets and one outlet, the Willow River. <br> \n <br> \nThe lake management plan (LMP) was last amended in 2017.  Northern Pike and Largemouth Bass were the primary management species and Black Crappie were considered a secondary species.  A standard lake survey utilizing gill nets and trap nets was conducted in June 2023 to update information on the fishery.  No boat night electrofishing for bass was conducted due to staff and workload constraints.  Additional sampling for near-shore fishes was conducted to calculate an Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) score.  That sampling utilized back-pack electrofishing and seining gear and is summarized in a separate report. <br> \n <br> \nThe Northern Pike population has low to moderate numbers and a favorable size structure.  Lower pike densities are desirable because they often result in faster growth rates and high-quality size structure. The gill-net catch for Northern Pike was at the low end of the expected range and near the LMP goal.  Size structure remained favorable as pike ranged from 19.8 to 39.2 inches and averaged 26.1 inches.  Six year-classes from age 3 to 9 were identified, with faster than average growth rates.  Northern Pike approached 25 inches after 4 years of growth.  Anglers and spearers are encouraged to limit harvest of larger pike to help maintain the good quality size structure. <br> \n <br> \nNet catches for Black Crappie tend to be variable because of their habit of suspending in the water column in off-shore areas.  Gill-net catches have varied from 0.2 to 18.5/net in past surveys.  The 2023 catch rate of 1.0/net was below average for the lake, but within the expected range for the lakes with similar habitat.  Only one crappie was sampled in trap nets.  The few crappie sampled were of favorable size ranging from 10.4 to 12.7 inches. <br> \n <br> \nThe Walleye gill-net catch was below the expected range for similar lakes, but typical for No-ta-she-bun.  The four Walleye sampled ranged from 17.3 to 26.5 inches.  Meaningful evaluations of age structure and growth cannot be drawn from such a small sample size.  Two of the four Walleye did correspond to previously stocked year-classes.  Past stocking did not appear to contribute substantially to the population and was discontinued.  Lakes like No-ta-she-bun rarely produce quality Walleye fisheries due to habitat, fish community and prey base limitations.  <br> \n <br> \nOnly one Yellow Perch was sampled for a catch rate of 0.2/gill net.  This was well below the expected range and the lowest catch on record. <br> \n <br> \nThe Bluegill population has typically had moderate numbers and poor size structure.  The 2023 trap-net catch was typical for No-ta-she-bun and lakes with similar habitat.  Size structure improved from past surveys.  Sampled Bluegill ranged from 3.2 to 9.0 inches and averaged 6.6 inches.  Fourteen percent of the sampled exceeded the preferred-length of 8 inches.  Bluegill were not aged in this survey but previous surveys reported slower than average growth rates.  No-ta-she-bun provides fair angling opportunities for moderate-sized Bluegill. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass were sampled in low numbers with fish ranging from 8 to 12.9 inches.  Previous surveys employing electrofishing showed No-ta-she-bun contains good numbers of small to medium-sized bass. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled in test nets included Golden Shiner, Hybrid Sunfish, Pumpkinseed Sunfish, Rock Bass, White Sucker and Yellow Bullhead. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Northern pike numbers (2.2 fish/gill net) were low relative to the lake class but they had good size structure.  About 80% of the fish were longer than 24 inches at the time of capture.  Growth was faster than statewide averages for all ages.  The presence of a good tullibee population (20 fish sampled) is likely one reason for good northern pike growth and size structure. Walleye were introduced in 1984 and subsequent stocking has maintained the population.  The sampled fish ranged from 10.0 to 25.9 inches (n=16).  Due to low sample sizes, above average growth compared to statewide averages should be viewed cautiously.   There was no conclusive evidence of natural reproduction at this time.  Bluegill size distribution was skewed toward smaller fish with 30% of the fish from 4.0 to 4.5 inches.  Growth rates were below statewide averages for all ages.A few largemouth bass were sampled (n=11) less than 12 inches.  Mean back-calculated lengths at age were below statewide averages. Catch rates for most of the species sampled from Willow Lake few within the interquartile ranges for their respective gears.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of nearshore fish species in Burrows Lake was conducted on August 16-17th, 2023, by Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program staff. Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake, and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at ten sampling stations. Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample six stations and a 15-foot seine was used at four stations. Nearshore sampling captured seven species of fish including one species that is intolerant of disturbance (i.e., Smallmouth Bass) and zero that are tolerant of disturbance. <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore data were combined with trap net and gill net data from a July 2023 survey to describe the fish community and provide a fish-based IBI (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment. In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g., Blackchin Shiner, Iowa Darter, and Smallmouth Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g., Black Bullhead and Common Carp). The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.  <br> \n <br> \nResults from this survey provide evidence that the fish community in Burrows Lake is Lake is healthy as indicated by an FIBI score that exceeds the exceptional use threshold determined for similar lakes. These results are similar to previous survey findings, which indicated that Burrows Lake is fully supporting for aquatic life use. The survey results will be considered when the biological health of the lake is assessed during the Mississippi River - Grand Rapids Watershed assessment process, which will be completed in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency. <br> \n <br> \nMinnesota DNR Fisheries IBI program staff also conducted an assessment of lakeshore habitat on No-ta-she-bun Lake on June 26th, 2023, following the Score the Shore survey protocols. The assessment consisted of 33 survey sites evenly spaced 150 meters around the lake. Assessments were made in three habitat zones: Shoreline Zone (the shore-water interface to the top of the natural bank), Shoreland Zone (land-ward from shoreline to development structure or 100 feet), and Aquatic Zone (lake-ward 50 feet of shoreline). The average lakewide habitat score was 84.0 (?2.7) out of 100 possible. A score of 84.0 indicates the lakewide shoreline condition is Moderately High (80-85). Approximately 33 percent of the sites were developed with a mean score of 70.8 (?4.7) indicating shoreline habitat quality of developed sites is Moderate (70-80), while undeveloped sites had a mean score of 90.6 (?2.3) with High (85-92) habitat quality.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>No-Ta-She-Bun (Willow) Lake is managed primarily for northern pike and secondarily for walleye, largemouth bass and panfish.  Northern pike were sampled in gill nets at the lowest rate yet and below the expected rate for this type of lake.  This rate is within the range set in the lake management plan, however.  A goal of low pike abundance was set because lower abundance of northern pike often produces faster growing fish, resulting in a larger average size.  Northern pike sampled in gill nets had a mean length of 21.8 inches and a mean weight of 2.6 pounds.  Growth appears to be above average.     Walleye are not native to the lake and were first stocked in 1984.  They were sampled in the gill nets at a rate below the expected range.  They had a mean length of 17.4 pounds and a mean weight of 1.9 pounds.  Growth appears to be good.  Walleye were sampled from nonstocked age classes which suggests that natural reproduction is occuring.     Few largemouth bass were captured in the nets, but the electrofishing catch rate suggests that there may be a moderate or large population present.  Bass captured electrofishing ranged form 4.5 to 15.9 inches in length.  Younger fish appear to grow well but growth appears slow for older fish.     Black crappie were sampled in trap nets at a high rate, well above the expected range.  They ranged from 4.3 to 11.3 inches in length.  Growth appears good for most ages of fish.     Bluegill were sampled in trap nets at their highest rate yet but this rate is still within the expected range.  They ranged from 4.1 to 8.1 inches in length.     Other species that were sampled include: tullibee, white sucker, brown bullhead, golden shiner, rock bass, and hybrid and pumpkinseed sunfish.      </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>The 1998 Willow Lake management plan lists northern pike as the primary species for management with walleye and largemouth bass as secondary species.Northern pike catch rates during historical assessments have ranged from 1.6 to 9.0 per gill net.  The 2000 catch rate of 6.3 per gill net was similar to the lake class median of 6.7, and the mean weight of 2.8 pounds was similar to the lake class upper quartile of 2.9 pounds.  The northern pike management goal from the 1998 lake management plan was to maintain a catch rate below 3.5 per gill net with a mean weight above 2.9 pounds.  Although the catch rate was higher in 2000, the mean weight was very near the goal.  The PSD (21 inches) was 70 and RSD-P (28 inches) was 5, indicating a good proportion of 21-28 inch fish but few larger individuals.  Growth rates were somewhat (<15%) above the statewide averages for ages 1, 3 and 4 and were >15% over for age 2.Walleye fingerlings have been stocked every third year since 1993; various stocking occurred before that time.  The 2000 catch rate of 3.7 per gill net was between the lake class median and upper quartile (2.5 and 5.0, respectively), and the mean weight of 2.2 pounds was also between the lake class median and upper quartile (1.8 and 2.5, respectively).  No walleye were sampled during assessments prior to 1991, and the 2000 catch rate is the highest on record.  The 1998 lake management plan had a goal of maintaining walleye catch rates within the lake class interquartile range of 1.3 to 5.0 per gill net, which was met in 2000.  Of the 22 walleye aged, 41% were naturally reproduced from non-stocked years (an unknown percentage of fish from stocked years were also likely from natural reproduction).  Size structure was good, with a PSD (15 inches) of 86 and a RSD-P (20 inches) of 29.  Growth rates were also above the statewide averages for ages 1-5 (>15% above for ages 2, 3, and 5).  The largest individual was 27 inches and 10 years old.Largemouth bass were sampled with spring nighttime electrofishing for a catch rate of 83.4 per hour on-time.  Although this is a very high catch rate, the PSD (12 inches) of 20 and RSD-P (15 inches) of 3 indicate a very poor size structure.  Growth rates were also slow, at least 15% below the statewide averages for ages 1-7.  The largest individual was 16.5 inches and 11 years old.Black crappie catch rates during historical assessments have ranged from 0.2 to 18.5 per gill net and from 0.3 to 7.0 per trap net, although most have been on the low end.  The 2000 catch rates were 4.0 per gill net and 2.2 per trap net, both above their lake class median.  Size structure was fair, with a PSD (8 inches) of 66 and a RSD-P (10 inches) of 14.Bluegill catch rates during historical assessment have ranged from 4.5 to 41.7 per trap net, and those for pumpkinseed have ranged from 2.6 to 25.0 per trap net.  The 2000 bluegill catch rate of 29.8 per trap net was above the lake class median, and the 2000 pumpkinseed catch rate of 12.7 per trap net was above the lake class upper quartile.  Bluegill size structure was poor, with a PSD (6 inches) of 45 and a RSD-P (8 inches) of 0.  Pumpkinseed size structure was also poor, with a PSD (6 inches) of 29 and a RSD-P (8 inches) of 2.Shoreline owners can directly help maintain or improve water quality and fish habitat by following lakeshore development best management practices, such as maintaining or upgrading septic systems, minimizing nutrient inputs from fertilizer use, and leaving aquatic vegetation and terrestrial vegetation intact within at least 50 feet of the shoreline or restoring such vegetation to its native state.  Poorly-maintained septic systems and fertilizers contribute excess nutrients and bacteria to the lake, and removal of upland and aquatic vegetation can cause additional ecological problems.  Symptoms of impaired water quality can include increases in winter kills, summer kills, algae, aquatic plants, and fecal coliform bacteria.  Conversely, a naturally vegetated shoreline (not mowed grass) provides cover for young and adult fish, filters nutrients before they reach the lake, reduces erosion, and provides food and habitat for invertebrates and wildlife.

                "narrative": "<p>No-ta-she-bun Lake, also known as Willow, is located about eight miles northeast of Remer, MN.  The 238 acre lake has 72 littoral acres, a maximum depth of 45 feet, and 3.1 miles of shoreline.  The lake borders the Chippewa National Forest, but most of the shoreline is in private ownership.  There is a state administered access on the northwest shore along with a state rest area.  There are no inlets and one outlet, Willow River.  Walleye is one of the primary management species and has had various stockings since 2001.  No-ta-she-bun was part of a walleye stocking density study in which Oxytetracycline (OTC) marked fryling were stocked in 2008 and 2010. <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled walleye at a historically low rate since stocking began and below the expected range for lakes similar to No-ta-she-bun.  The trap net catch was close to the expected range.  Both catches were lower than the previous assessment.  The one gill net sampled fish was 18.9 inches, while the two trap net sampled fish were 19.9 inches and 26.6 inches.  This low catch suggests No-ta-she-bun did not respond well to fryling stocking.  Past assessments documented the potential for natural reproduction.  However, stocking was likely required to achieve management goals, as higher catches occurred during periods of fingerling stocking. <br> \n <br> \nThe northern pike catch was the same as the previous assessment and within the expected range.  Size structure appeared to be favorable.  Lengths ranged from 18.8 to 35 inches with an average length of 24.4 inches. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie were sampled at a rate higher than expected and the previous assessment in trap nets.  Conversely, the gill net catch rate was lower than expected and the previous assessment.  Size structure appeared to be modest in the trap net sample with lengths from 7.1 to 10.2 inches and an average of 8.5 inches. <br> \n <br> \nTrap net sampled bluegill have typically had catches within the expected range, which was observed in 2013.  Size structure was moderate.  Lengths ranged from 3.0 to 8.6 inches with an average of 6.4 inches. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch were sampled at a rate lower than expected, yet similar to the previous assessment.  Lengths ranged from 5.8 to 7.2 inches with an average of 6.4 inches. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled included brown bullhead, golden shiner, hybrid sunfish, largemouth bass, pumpkinseed sunfish, rock bass, white sucker, and yellow bullhead. <br> \n <br> \nAs part of IBI (Index of Biotic Integrity) near shore sampling, blackchin shiner, blacknose shiner, bluntnose minnow, pumpkinseed sunfish, and yellow perch were sampled in seven 15 foot seine haul.  Backpack electrofishing sampled Iowa darter, Johnny darter, blackchin shiner, bluegill, bluntnose minnow, central mudminnow, largemouth bass, mottled sculpin, pumpkinseed sunfish, rock bass, tadpole madtom, yellow bullhead, and yellow perch at 10 stations. <br> \n</p>",
