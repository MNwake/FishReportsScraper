The gill net CPUE of 11.5 remains above the third quartile for the lake group, while the average size remains small. Growth of the northern pike is slow. The bluegill population remains high with a trap net CPUE of 107.8. The size structure of the population is fair, with 36 of the 246 sampled greater than 7 inches. Growth of the bluegill is slow. The yellow perch population peeked in 1984 after the stocking of adult yellow perch in 1982 and 1983. However, the gillnet CPUE declined from 5.8 in 1984 to 0.7 in 1987. The pumpkinseed, largemouth bass and black crappie populations are average for the lake group, while the bowfin, black and brown bullhead populations are lower than average. The yellow bullhead population is higher than average.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of nearshore fish species in O'Brien Lake was conducted on August 22nd, 2022 by Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program Staff. Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at all ten sampling stations, but four stations were sampled from the boat due to site conditions. Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample four stations, a 15-foot seine was used at five stations, and soft sediments with abundant vegetation and deep water prevented the use of seines at one station. Nearshore sampling captured 20 species of fish including seven species that are intolerant of disturbance (i.e., Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, Least Darter, Rock Bass, and Smallmouth Bass) and one species that is tolerant of disturbance (i.e., Green Sunfish). <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore data will be combined with trap net and gill net data from a planned 2024 survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based IBI (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment. In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g., Blackchin Shiner, Iowa Darter, and Rock Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g., Green Sunfish). The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.  <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey indicates O'Brien Lake is healthy as indicated by the presence of several intolerant fish species. Data from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Pine River Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.</p>",

Other species were present in average abundance for the lake class. Northern pike (8.0/gillnet) were caught in average numbers, compared to a high abundance in 1987 (11.5/ gillnet).  Ages 1-6 were sampled and growth was good.  Average size increased slightly to 1.65 lbs.  Average was 1.34 lbs (small) in 1987. Median length remained at 18 inches.  Largemouth bass (0.5/ trapnet) were also found in average abundance after being abundant (1.7/trapnet) in 1987.  Ages 3-5 were sampled.  Walleye (0.33/gillnet) were low in abundance, and had not been sampled since 1967. For the five fish sampled, median length was 12 inches and average size 0.7 lbs.  Bluegills (62.75/trapnet) remained abundant.  Ages 3-7 were sampled and growth was again slow.  The 1987 and 1986 year classes were most strongly represented in the catch, contributing 40% and 37% respectively to the sample.  Bluegills to 8.2 inches were sampled, and about 21% of measured fish were at least 7.0 long (compared to 14.6% in 1987).  Black crappie (1.0 trapnet) was caught in average numbers.  Only ages 3 and 4 were sampled in trapnets.   Yellow perch abundance (3.33/gillnet) rose to the average category in 1992 after being caught at a low 0.7/ gillnet in 1987.  Ages 4-8 were present in low numbers.  Yellow bullheads (11.25/trapnet) and brown bullheads (3.0 gillnet) were sampled in high numbers.  Yellow bullheads averaged 0.32 lbs (small) while brown bullheads averaged 0.8 lbs.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>O'Brien Lake is a 188 acre lake located in Northern Crow Wing County three miles east of Crosslake.  O'Brien reaches a maximum depth of 49 feet, with 55% shallower than 15 feet.  Water clarity is good with a secchi disk reading of 16 feet.  The shoreline is moderately developed with 120 homes on 4.7 miles of shoreline.  A public access is scheduled to be developed in 2013.  A 2012 survey of the aquatic plant community found 33 native species.  Protection of aquatic vegetation, especially emergent vegetation, is important for maintaining good water quality and provides critical spawning habitat and cover for fish.   <br> \n <br> \nThe northern pike gillnet catch of 6.0/net was average for this lake class.  Average size was 17.3 and 1.6 lbs.  There are some larger northern pike present with 22% over 24 inches in length.  The largest captured was 34.3 inches. <br> \n <br> \nThe bluegill catch of 14.7/trapnet was average compared to similar lakes.  The average length was 6.3 inches, with 44% over 7 inches in length.  Growth was faster than similar lakes.   The black crappie catch of 1.0/trapnet was also average for this lake class.  Of the 6 crappies caught, 5 were over 8 inches in length.  The 2008 year class represented 50% of the catch. <br> \n <br> \nEven though walleye fingerlings have been privately stocked into O'Brien in alternate years, no walleyes were captured in the survey.   Other fish captured included largemouth bass, rock bass, yellow perch, yellow bullhead, brown bullhead, pumpkinseed and hybrid sunfish.  Additional species sampled during IBI backpack electrofishing, and seining included Johnny darter, banded killifish, blackchin shiner, bluntnose minnow, golden shiner, green sunfish, and smallmouth bass. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>O'Brien lake is a 188 acre lake located three miles east of Crosslake.  The lake has a maximum depth of 49 feet with 55% shallower than 15 feet.  The lake has moderate fertility with excellent water clarity. The lake is primarily managed as a northern pike, largemouth bass, and panfish lake.  Walleye have been stocked yearly since 1988.  The stocking has taken place by private stocking sponsored by the lake association with approval of the DNR.The walleye catch rate of 0.7 fish/gill net is considered normal for this lake type but this lake class is not considered a typical walleye lake.  Five previous surveys have been done and only the initial survey with 2.3 fish/gill net in 1967 had a higher catch rate than 1999 for walleye.  The low walleye population level present makes walleye fishing difficult.  Northern pike catch rates have ranged previously from 7.3 fish/gill net in 1967 to 11.5 in 1987.  The 1999 catch rate at 8.0 fish/gill net is considered normal for this lake type.  Fish size in 1999 ranged from 11.6  to 28.6 inches with average size of 16.5 inches.  Largemouth bass were observed in moderate numbers with size ranging from 7.7 to 14.2 inches.  Black crappiewere caught in low numbers with various sizes present.  Bluegill abundance was very high at 64.2/trap net with sizes ranging from 3.2 to 8.5 inches with an average size of 5.9 inches.  Yellow perch were present in low numbers at 0.7 fish/gill net.  Past surveys also indicate a low perch population.  The high northern pike population and low perch numbers make conditions unfavorable for establishing and maintaining a walleye population.</p>",

O'Brien is located in the Pine River watershed.  A nearshore survey was conducted to assess the populations of both game and non-game fish species.  Ten 100' long sampling stations were evenly spaced around the lakeshore.  Each station was then sampled by backpack electrofishing, and if conditions allowed with a 15' or 50' 1/8th inch seine. <br> \n <br> \nThe survey took place on August 23, 2019, with all 10 stations sampled by backpack electrofishing.  The 50' 1/8th inch seine was used at 1 station and the 15' 1/8th inch seine was used at an additional 4 stations.  Heavy vegetation and/or soft bottom prevented the use of seines at the other 5 sampling sites.  Thirteen species were sampled, including 5 species that are intolerant of habitat disturbance: banded killifish, blacknose shiner, Iowa darter, smallmouth bass, and rock bass.  This nearshore survey will be used along with the gill net and trap net survey conducted on June 24-27, 2019 to calculate a Fish-Based Index of Biotic Integrity (FIBI) score.  The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health by the types of fish species present and comparing it to what is expected for this type of lake. <br> \n</p>",

Conditions for higher walleye abundance seem to be lacking as net catches haven't been higher than 0.7/gill net since 1967.  Only 2 walleyes were captured in gill nets and 4 in trap nets in 2019. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike numbers were high for this type of lake at 10.7/gill net.  Average length was 18.1\" and fish above the 22\"-26\" protected slot made up 8% of the catch.  Lakes in this part of the state have a new northern pike regulation enacted in 2018: possession limit of 10 with not more than 2 over 26\".  All from 22\"-26\" must be immediately released.  Please refer to the current Minnesota Fishing Regulations for additional information. <br> \n <br> \nAs far as panfish go, black crappie numbers were low in our netting, but bluegill numbers (16.0/trap net) and size were a little better.  Average size was 7.3\" and 74% of the fish were 7\" or larger. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass were not sampled by electrofishing, but net catches were average for this type of lake.  Fish ranged in size from 5.9\" to 18.4\". <br> \n <br> \nOther fish captured included black crappie, bowfin (dogfish), hybrid sunfish, pumpkinseed, rock bass, yellow bullhead, and yellow perch. <br> \n</p>",
