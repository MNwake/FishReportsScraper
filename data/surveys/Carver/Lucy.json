It has been subject to periodic partial winterkills (1955-56, 1963-64, 1974-75, 1977-78, and 1988-89).  As a result, fish populations have tended to fluctuate dramatically over time.  During high water, boats can travel from Lake Ann to Lake Lucy via Riley Creek.  Small boats can navigate this channel at normal water levels.  Only canoes can access Lucy Lake during low water levels.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike were sampled at levels well above average for a lake like Lucy Lake.  Average weight for the pike was 2.75 lbs, with lengths ranging from 14.5-30.9 inches.  Approximately 60% of the pike sampled were over 20 inches, 37% were over 24 inches, and 20% over 28 inches.  The size of these pike could be a result of the special regulation on pike in the connected Lake Ann. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill were by far the most sampled fish in Lucy Lake, representing 65% of the total catch.  The fish ranged in length from 3.0-8.0 inches, with 80% being over 6.0 inches.  The average weight per bluegill was 0.25 lbs.   <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch, pumpkinseed and hybrid sunfish were all present in below average rates for a lake in this lake class, with a total of 6.6% of the total catch.  Black crappie only accounted for 3% of the total catch at Lucy Lake, with lengths ranging from 4.5-10.5 inches and an average weight of 0.3 lbs.   <br> \n <br> \nOn the other hand, largemouth bass were sampled at average and above average rates, with well above average weights.  The bass ranged in length from 14.0-19.0 inches, and averaged 2.3 lbs/ fish.  To further evaluate the largemouth bass population, spring electrofishing should be completed on Lucy Lake. <br> \n <br> \nYellow, black and brown bullheads were all present in Lucy Lake and accounted for, respectively, 9.5%, 3.8% and 0.9% of the total catch.  Numbers and rates were about average for a lake like this, with the exceptions that yellow bullheads were more abundant and black bullheads were much heavier than what would have been expected. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

Presently the lake harbors large numbers of bluegill and pumpkinseed sunfish; although average size is small (5.4 inches for bluegill, 3.9 for pumpkinseed), over a third of bluegill sampled were over 7 inches.  There are also good numbers of largemouth bass and northern pike available to anglers.  Northern pike average 22 inches.  Submerged aquatic vegetation is abundant in most shallow areas, and water clarity is moderate (visibility to 5 feet deep).</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lucy is a small, productive, 92-acre lake located in Chanhassen, Carver County.  The lake has been subject to periodic partial winterkills, and, as a result, fish populations have fluctuated, at times dramatically.  Most recently, oxygen was low enough in the winter of 2010-11 to induce another partial winterkill. Public access to this lake is limited, but available from City-owned Lake Ann Park, across lake Ann, and using the channel to Lake Lucy. A population assessment was completed in June 2012 to characterize the fish community in Lucy Lake.   <br> \n <br> \nLucy has an abundant northern pike population with a good size structure.  At 17.3/gill net, catch was more than double the 75th percentile (7.0/net) of similar lakes.   Size structure indices revealed a balanced population, including a number of preferred-sized fish (56% were 21 inches or larger and 17% were 28 inches or larger).  Seven year classes were present, with the majority (81%) of fish equally distributed among ages 3 through 6.  Growth was near the statewide average as pike grew to 17.5 inches by age 3 and 25.6 inches by age 6.   Mean length and weight were 22.4 inches and 2.80 lbs with the largest fish measuring 34.8 inches and 8.80 lbs.  The quality northern pike population may be influenced by the connection to Ann Lake.  Ann also has a quality pike population, with a protected slot limit of 24-36 inches.  High water levels allow fish to move between lakes. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill abundance is also high in Lucy.  Catch averaged 33/trap net, which is near the 75th percentile when compared to similar lakes.  Size structure was balanced where 60% were 6 inches or longer and 1% were 8 inches or longer.  Mean length and weight of trap-net-caught bluegill were 6.2 inches and 0.20 lbs, with the largest measuring 9.0 inches and 0.42 lbs.  The strongest year class was in 2006, which represented 38% of the catch.  Ages 2 through 7 were also present.  Bluegill growth was average, as they attained lengths of 5.1 inches by age 3 and 7.6 inches by age 6.    <br> \n <br> \nThe black crappie population did not exhibit the same high quality characteristics as the previously mentioned game species.  Abundance (4.7/gill net) was near the median compared to other similar lakes and size structure quality was low (28% were 8 inches or longer).  Mean length and weight of gill-net-caught black crappie were 7.3 inches and 0.24 lbs, with the largest reaching 9.7 inches and 0.51 lbs.  The black crappie population is young as 53% were age 3.  Ages ranged from 1 to 7.  Growth tended to be slower than statewide averages; Lake Lucy black crappie grew to 7.2 inches by age 3 and 8.8 inches by age 5.         <br> \n <br> \nNo largemouth bass were collected during the assessment.  Passive sampling gears, such as trap nets and gill nets, are not effective methods for collecting largemouth bass.  As a result, this data is not indicative of the largemouth bass population.  Electrofishing is the typical method for largemouth bass assessments but was not conducted during this survey.   <br> \n <br> \nOther species collected in low abundance during this assessment were black bullhead, common carp, golden shiner, hybrid sunfish, pumpkinseed, yellow bullhead, and yellow perch. <br> \n</p>",
