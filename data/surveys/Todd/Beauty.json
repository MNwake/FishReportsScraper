                "narrative": "<p>Beauty Lake is a typical bass/panfish lake in central Minnesota that provides a diversity of angling opportunities.  The lake has a reputation for producing very good northern pike fishing with quality fish over 30 inches occasionally caught.  Northern pike captured during the assessment averaged 23.4 inches and fish up to 34.3 inches were present.  Although pike numbers are typically above management goals (goal=less than 7/gillnet), a healthy prey base supports normal to fast growth rates.  Individuals approached 30 inches in their sixth year of growth.  To maintain existing fast growth rates and quality size structure, it is recommended that anglers practice catch and release of all northern pike greater than 24 inches.  Anglers should consider keeping northern pike less than 24 inches as a harvestable surplus of small fish exists.  Reducing the population of small northern pike could be beneficial to the entire fish community.  Walleye management in particular would benefit from a lower northern pike population.    Largemouth bass are present in average numbers for this area and have desirable population characteristics.  Bass averaged 11.7 inches and ranged from 5.8 to 18.2 inches.  Largemouth greater than 12 inches comprised 41.7% of the catch and provide an excellent angling opportunity.  The presence of nine age classes suggests consistent recruitment occurs on Beauty Lake and growth rates are normal to fast.  Releasing all bass greater than 12 inches will help maintain the existing quality population.  In addition, protecting existing bulrush and other emergent vegetation stands will help protect the bass population.    The walleye population on Beauty Lake is maintained through fingerling stocking in odd years and abundance is typically at the upper end of the normal range.  The current population, however, appears to be at a low level despite 15,501 walleye fingerlings being stocked since 1995.  No natural reproduction has been documented in recent years.    Poor survival of stocked fingerlings due to predation by northern pike and other predators is the likely cause of the decline.  Nine walleye averaging 17.1 inches and ranging from 10.3 to 23.5 inches were sampled.  Walleye captured in this assessment grew at a normal rate when compared to other populations in the area.    Black crappie abundance (2.78/trapnet, 5.33/gillnet) was higher than the last survey but typical when compared to historical averages.  A total of 51 black crappies were captured during spring trapnetting averaging 8.5 inches and ranging from 6.3 to 9.6 inches in length.  The majority of fish caught were 8.5 to 9.5 inches (62.7%).  Ages III through VI were present in the sample with the 1996 cohort making up 68.6% of the catch.  Growth rates were slow to normal when compared to area means for black crappie growth in the Little Falls area.    Summer trapnetting suggests bluegill abundance (39.00/net) was normal when compared to similar type lakes and comparable to previous surveys.  A special spring panfish trapnet assessment documented good numbers of fish in the 7 inch range were present in the lake.  Growth rates were normal to fast with individuals attaining 7.0 inches at age VII.  The absence of fish over 8.0 inches in spite of good growth suggests angler harvest rates may be very high on larger size groups.</p>",

About 58% of the lake is shallower than 15 feet.The survey report indicates that Beauty Lake is a typical central Minnesota centrarchid (largemouth bass) lake.Angling success in recent years has ranged from fair to good, with crappies, sunfish, and northern pike composing the bulk of the angler's catch.  Natural spawning facilities for these species appear to be adequate.Submerged aquatic plants were found to be quite abundant in the lake at the time of the survey.Dissolved oxygen testing indicated that during the summer months the dissolved oxygen content below the thermocline is too low to support warm-water fish.There was no designated public access area present at the time of the survey.</p>",

Although pike numbers appeared to be the highest they've been since 1984 about a quarter of the fish caught in the survey were over 24 inches.  Northern pike captured during the assessment averaged 22.5 inches with fish up to 34 inches documented.   Anglers should consider keeping northern pike less than 24 inches as a harvestable surplus of small fish exists.  Reducing the population of small northern pike could be beneficial to the entire fish community.  Walleye management in particular would benefit from a lower pike population.    The walleye population in Beauty Lake is maintained through fingerling stocking in odd years and abundance typically had been near the upper end of the normal range.  This survey suggested the abundance was near the middle range, a slight improvement from the last survey which showed low numbers.  A wide range of sizes was seen in the walleye catch, from 9 to 27 inches with an average size of 17 inches.  The high northern pike population and other predators may be having a detrimental affect on the survival of the walleye fingerlings stocked in the lake.    Largemouth bass numbers appear to be at a level which is normal when compared to similar type lakes in this area.  Growth rates have been normal to fast in the past with anglers having the opportunity to catch fish up to 18 inches with a fair number of fish over 12 inches.  Releasing all bass greater than 12 inches will help maintain a quality fishery.  In addition, protecting existing bulrush and other emergent vegetation stands will help protect the bass population.    Many of the summer fishermen seem to be seeking bluegills while black crappie seem to be more popular in the winter.  A special assessment was conducted in the late spring of 2004 targetting panfish.  Beauty Lake appears to have an excellent bluegill population with some quality fish up to 9 inches present.  While most of the bluegills in the assessment were between 6 and 7 inches there was a fair number of fish which exceeded 7 inches in length.  The crappie catch was a little more disappointing as far as size structure.  Most of the crappies were between 8 and 9 inches with the biggest crappie being just over 10 inches in length which has been the norm when looking at past surveys.    Other fish species that are present in the lake include bowfin or dogfish, brown and yellow bullheads, white suckers, pumpkinseeds, and yellow perch.  Yellow perch numbers appear to be maintaining at normal population abundance despite the abundant northern pike population.  Perch can be an important prey species for northern pike and walleye.  They can also be instrumental in helping maintain a well balanced bluegill population with fast growing, quality individuals.    Protecting the water quality in Beauty Lake should be a high priorty of the lake association and landowners around the lake.  Preservation of the emergent vegetation beds can improve water quality, reduce shoreline erosion, and protect valuable fish habitat.  Buffer strips along inlets and lakeshore property are encouraged to reduce nutrients entering the water.  Maintaining adequate septics, keeping grass clippings and raked leaves out of the lake, and the use of zero phosphorus lawn fertilizer will also help reduce nutrients entering the lake, thus slowing algae and excess weed growth.  The Todd County Planning and Zoning office in Long Prairie has a good website which provides information for shoreline property owners.  (www.co.todd.mn.us/PlanningZoning/planning.htm)</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>      A panfish assessment was conducted on Beauty Lake in early June to evaluate the bluegill and black crappie populations.  Eight lake survey trap nets were set and lifted twice for a total of 16 net lifts.  Similar special assessments were conducted in early June in both 2004 and 2001.  The 2004 assessment had 12 net lifts and the 2001 assessment 18 net lifts. <br> \n      The 2010 assessment sampled 20 black crappie (1.3/TN), which was the lowest crappie catch of the three panfish assessments.  The 2004 assessment sampled 42 crappie (3.5/TN) and the 2001 assessment 51 crappie (2.8/TN).  All three assessments had the same length range, six to ten inches.  The mean length was shorter in 2010, 7.9 inches, compared to 8.4 inches in 2004 and 8.5 inches in 2001.  The modal length was also shorter in 2010 assessment, 6.5 - 7 inches, while in the 2004 assessment it was 8 - 8.5 inches and 8.5 - 9 inches, and 9 - 9.5 inches in 2001.  The proportion of the sample exceeding 9 inches was greater in 2010, 25% (n=5) compared to 14% (n=6) in 2004, however, 35% (n=18) of the crappie in the 2001 assessment exceeded nine inches in length.   The lake management goal was to have a catch rate of at least three crappie per trap net with 35% of the fish exceeding 9 inches.  Results from the 2010 assessment fell short of both goals while the 2004 assessment met the catch rate and the 2001 assessment met the proportion of catch over nine inches in length. <br> \n      Ages 3 through 5 were represented in the 2010 black crappie sample.    The 2007 year class dominated the catch, and comprised 55% of the sample.  All of the age groups displayed normal growth when compared to an area mean back-calculated length table. <br> \n      All of the panfish assessments produced good catches of bluegill.  The 2010 panfish assessment had a catch of 685 bluegill that ranged from three to nine inches.  In 2004, 877 bluegill from three to nine inches in length were caught, and the 2001 assessment produced a catch of 937 bluegill between three and eight inches.  Modal length was the same in all three assessments, 6 - 6.5 inches.   The 2010 and 2004 assessments had a similar mean length of about six inches, while in 2001 the mean length was 5.2 inches.  The 2010 panfish assessment was dominated by smaller bluegill as only 12% (n=82) of the fish were more than seven inches in length.  Twenty-nine percent (n=253) of the 2004 catch exceeded seven inches and 17% (n=165) of the fish were more than seven inches in length in 2001.  There was a greater proportion of fish over eight inches in 2010 (2%; n=12), however, compared to 0.9% (n=8) in 2004 and 0.1% (n=1) in 2001.   The management goal for bluegill is to have a spring trap net catch where at least 15% of the fish exceed seven inches. <br> \n      Ages 3 through 10 were represented in the 2010 panfish assessment bluegill sample.   There were two strong year classes, 2005 and 2006, which accounted for 47% and 34% of the sample, respectively.  Ages 3 and 4 exhibited normal growth and the older age groups fast growth when compared to an area mean back-calculated length table. <br> \n      The 2010 panfish assessment also sampled 150 pumpkinseed and 66 hybrid sunfish.  Some of the gamefish caught included two largemouth bass around 14 inches in length, seven northern pike between 10 and 19 inches in length, and one 22-inch walleye.  Other fish species sampled included bowfin, brown bullhead, green sunfish, rock bass, and yellow bullhead.   <br> \n      Spring panfish assessments have proven to be effective at sampling bluegill although black crappie catches have been lower that desired to evaluate populations.  Spring electrofishing may be used to help evaluate black crappie populations.  Water temperature at the time of the assessment was 71 degrees which may have been too warm for an effective catch. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A standard survey was completed on Beauty Lake the week of July 10 with specific targeted sampling for Largemouth Bass and Black Crappie completed in May. This survey is a replicate of the survey completed in 2017 and while data variability can be considerable, Northern Pike and Walleye populations remain similar to what they were in 2017. Yellow Perch abundance appears to have increased since 2017, while Largemouth Bass, Bluegill and Black Crappie remain within the range we'd expect for this lake.   <br> \n <br> \nBased on results from this survey, anglers can expect a Northern Pike population generally comprised of fish ranging from 13-30 inches with the majority around 20 inches. About a third of the population measures over 24 inches which is decent compared to other Area lakes similar in character. Walleyes have never been very abundant in Beauty Lake, and this continues to be the case. Fingerling stockings from 2001-2015 have failed to produce a fishery. Reasons for this are not conclusive but it is likely due to competition and predation from Northern Pike and an overall presence of habitat favoring bass and panfish rather than Walleye.  <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass captured while electrofishing ranged from 7-19 inches with nearly two-thirds of the sample measuring over 12 inches. Total average length of the sample was 13.4 inches. Bluegill and Black Crappies captured in trap nets averaged 6.2 and 7.3 inches with Bluegills more abundant than crappies. Aging data for crappies was examined and growth rate was determined to be \"moderate\" with individual fish taking about seven years to reach 10 inches. Beauty Lake was selected for participation in the statewide Quality Sunfish Initiative which requires anglers to release all sunfish once the harvest limit of five is caught. The objective of the lowered bag limit is to reduce sunfish harvest and allow for more fish to attain larger sizes (8-10 inches). Monitoring efforts are ongoing, and it is too early to determine regulation impacts.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>   Daytime electrofishing was conducted on Beauty Lake in early June to evaluate the largemouth bass population.  The day was cool and windy, with rain at times.  Wind was from the south, which caused the water to be turbid on the north end of the lake.  Shocking time was just under an hour and produced a catch rate of 92 bass per hour with 85 largemouth bass being netted.  The 2008 catch rate was well over the Area Mean CPUE of 51.8/hour as well as the previous catches of 38.4/hour in 2001 and 39.4/hour in 1995.  The previous electrofishing efforts were conducted at night in late May with an older boat and one netter.  Prior catch rates may not be comparable as the 2008 electrofishing was done during the day with a new boat and two netters.  A new Area Mean will be produced from catches with the new boat. <br> \n    The bass in the 2008 effort measured from 4 to 19.6 inches in length with a mean length of 9.5 inches.  Modal length for the sample was 7 - 7.5 inches.  PSD for the catch was 25, which was half of the Area Mean of 53 as well as below the PSDs of the previous electrofishing catches, 64 in 2001 and 47 in 1995.  The bass ranged from 6 to 18 inches in 2001 and 4 to 17.5 inches in 1995.  Mean lengths were better in both of the previous assessments also, 11.7 inches in 2001 and 10.8 inches in 1995.  The 2001 assessment showed an impressive modal length at 16 - 17 inches while in 1995 it was 10.5 - 11 inches.  Ages 2 thru 11 were represented in the 2008 electrofishing catch.  Age 2 bass showed slow growth and Ages 3 thru 8 normal growth.  The Age 9 and 10 bass, one of each, displayed fast growth.  The Age 11 bass (n=1) showed normal growth when compared to an Area Mean Back-calculated Length Table. <br> \n     A walleye assessment using gillnets was also conducted in mid-July of 2008, which captured 9 largemouth bass.  The 1.5/gillnet catch was just below the 75% quartile of 1.7/gillnet for lake class 31, suggesting normal population abundance.  The bass were between 10 and 15 inches in length with a mean length of 12.9 inches and had a PSD of 67.  The 2008 catch was the highest recorded for Beauty Lake with 0.5/gillnet being the average catch rate in the past 6 surveys. <br> \n     Black crappie can be a difficult species to sample with standard lake survey gear.  The 2008 electrofishing assessment presented an opportunity to better evaluate the population.  Thirty-two crappie were netted and the fish ranged from 5 to 10 inches in length with an average length of 8.2 inches.  Only a subsample of the observed crappies was netted, as they were not the target species.  The crappies were also more visible as they appeared to be in the shallows on spawning beds.  Modal length for the catch was 8 - 8.5 inches with 19% (n=6) of the fish exceeding 9 inches in length.  The 2008 summer assessment captured fifty-nine crappie for a catch rate of 9.8/gillnet, which was a significant increase from the 0.8/gillnet catch of 2004 and more than twice the 75% quartile of 3.5/gillnet.  The fish measured from 6 to 12 inches in length with a mean length of 8.3 inches.  Modal length was the same as in the electrofishing catch but only 12% (n=6) of the crappies were more than 9 inches in length.   <br> \n     Other observations made during the 2008 electrofishing assessment were that both bowfin and yellow bullhead were common.  Bluegill were fairly abundant with some 7 - 8 inch fish being observed.  Various size yellow perch were seen, but few northern pike or white sucker. <br> \n     Electrofishing may be an effective method for sampling black crappie with proper seasonal timing, (spawning).  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>   Beauty Lake is a typical bass/panfish lake in central Minnesota that provides a diversity of angling opportunities.  The lake has a reputation for producing good seasonal fishing for walleye, northern pike, bluegill, and black crappie.  Bluegills are the primary summer target while black crappies typically provide a winter fishery.   The lake has development on most of the south half of the lake which includes a bible camp on the west shore.  With the north end being mostly marsh, development is set back further from the lakeshore or absent.  Summer water clarity was excellent for a lake in this area of the State, as the lake has a watershed comprised mainly of forest, grasslands, and marsh.    <br> \n    Northern pike numbers increased significantly since the last survey in 2008 but average size was about the same at 20 inches or 1.8 pounds.   Several fish exceeding 30 inches were observed in the 2012 summer survey.   Anglers should consider keeping northern pike less than 24 inches as a harvestable surplus of small fish exists.   Reducing the population of small northern pike could be beneficial to the entire fish community.  Walleye management in particular would benefit from lower pike numbers.   Yellow perch numbers continue to be below normal levels when compared to similar type lakes and have been for the last three surveys which could be a result of high pike numbers and walleye stocking.  Perch can be an important prey species for both the northern pike and walleye.  They can also be instrumental in helping maintain a well-balanced bluegill population with fast growing, quality size individuals. <br> \n    The walleye population in the lake has been sustained through fingerling stocking in odd years and abundance was within the normal range when compared to similar type lakes.  A wide range of sizes were apparent in the walleye catch.  Walleye ranged from 7 to 25 inches with the average size being 18 inches or about 2 pounds.  Fish up to 27 inches have been documented in past surveys.  Anglers on the lake during the survey reported good walleye fishing this year. <br> \n    Beauty Lake supports a good largemouth bass population although residents reported poor bass fishing this year.  Spring electrofishing was used to evaluate the largemouth bass population.   Average size in the electrofishing catch was 14 inches which was higher than many lakes with fish up to 19 inches observed.   Many of the summer fishermen were seeking bluegills while black crappies seem to be more popular in the winter.  Some nice size bluegills over 8 inches were caught during the survey.  Few crappies were seen in the survey which is not that unusual as they can be a difficult species to catch in nets.  Most of the crappies in the summer survey were less than 9 inches in length. <br> \n    Other fish species that are present in the lake include bowfin or dogfish, brown bullhead, white sucker, and yellow bullhead.  Yellow bullheads were the most abundant on the two species of bullheads.  The single brown bullhead was over 14 inches while the average yellow bullhead was over 11 inches in length.   <br> \n    Neascus or black spot was common on the northern pike and yellow perch.  Neascus is a trematode or parasite that is usually found in the skin of the fish.  The life cycle of the parasite also includes snails and fish-eating birds, such as herons and bitterns.  Skinning the fish removes most of the parasites and cooking will kill the rest.  Humans cannot be infested. <br> \n     Protecting the water quality in Beauty Lake has been and should be a high priority of the lake association and landowners around the lake.  Preservation of the emergent vegetation beds can improve water quality, reduce shoreline erosion, and protect valuable fish habitat.  Buffer strips along inlets and lakeshore property are encouraged to reduce nutrients entering the water.  Maintaining adequate septic systems, keeping grass clippings and raked leaves out of the lake, and the common sense use of lawn fertilizer will also help reduce nutrient loading, thus slowing algae and excess weed growth.   <br> \n</p>",

Walleye stocking regimes are being studied to determine the method most effective in moderate-sized Minnesota lake classes 23, 24, 24, and 31.  Beauty Lake was stocked with walleye fingerlings marked with oxytetracyline in the fall of 2005.  The lake was divided into six electrofishing stations for a total of 2 hours of run-time.  Yearling walleye along with those suspected to be from the 2004, 2001, and 2000 year classes were to be collected to look for the OTC marks with a total of nineteen walleye between 8.5 and 14.2 inches being netted and kept for mark determination.  Eighteen of the fish were yearlings for a catch rate of 10.5/hour on-time. <br> \n <br> \nThe fish were sent to the Glenwood Research personel for aging and OTC mark checking.  Results from the project are expected in 2009</p>",

Nine trap nets were set along the shoreline in a variety of habitat types.  Yellow Bullhead, Bowfin, and Bluegill were the most abundant species by biomass.   <br> \n <br> \nData from this targeted nearshore survey is combined with data from a standard gill net survey and a nearshore survey in July 2017 to calculate a Fish-based Index of Biologic Integrity (FIBI) score that describes the overall health of the lake. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment.  The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. The FIBI score for Beauty Lake based on this survey is above the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes.  For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website. <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Mississippi River-Brainerd Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.   <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Beauty Lake is a 238 acre bass/panfish lake located east of Long Prairie, MN.   A five (5) fish bag limit on sunfish is scheduled for implementation on March 1, 2021 as Beauty Lake has been selected for participation in the statewide Quality Sunfish Initiative.  The lower bag limit is intended to reduce the harvest of sunfish while improving the sizes of sunfish available to anglers.  The goal is to have the lake produce more 7 to 9 inch sunfish which are most desired by anglers.  Evaluations of lakes that have had similar reduced bag limits for several years have shown that most respond favorably and produce larger sunfish.  Spring trap netting is the preferred method for evaluating Bluegill populations, however electrofishing was employed due to staff/time shortages resulting from the Covid-19 pandemic.  Daytime electrofishing was performed on June 17 and September 17, 2020 to provide pre-regulation data on the Bluegill size structure.  The June electrofishing seemed to produce a sample that poorly represented the adult Bluegill population.  Fall electrofishing was added to enhance the sample and determine the efficacy of fall sampling.  Future evaluations relating to the 5 sunfish bag limit will incorporate trap netting to provide proper comparisons. <br> \n <br> \nSpring Electrofishing appeared to be moderately efficient in terms of numbers of Bluegill sampled with 146 fish captured in just over 41 minutes of on-time.   Bluegill appeared to be past the peak spawning period and adult fish were difficult to locate.  Spring electrofished Bluegill ranged from 2.9 - 7.9 inches in length with most length groups well represented up to 7 inches.  Fish over 7 inches comprised just 4% of the catch and fish greater than 8 inches were absent.  Fall electrofishing provided a slightly better sample in terms of numbers and size.  A total of 260 Bluegill were collected in just over an hour of on-time.  Fall fish ranged from 3.1-8.3 inches in length.  Bluegill greater than 7 inches made up 11.5% of the sample and 3 fish over 8 inches were captured.  Past aging has shown that Bluegill display fair growth (average length of 6.48 inches at Age 5) which is sustained well past 8 inches.  <br> \n    <br> \nPrevious spring trap net surveys were conducted in 2001, 2004, 2010 and 2017.  Trap nets have provided larger sample sizes of 267 to 937 fish.  Bluegill over 7 inches in spring trap net efforts have comprised 12-23% of the catch and fish over 9 inches were observed in 2010 and 2017.  Maximum size in 2017 was 9.61 inches. <br> \n <br> \nWhile fishing for sunfish it is best to limit your harvest of the large individuals, especially the males.  The large males exhibit the best growth rates and also inhibit smaller and slower growing males from spawning.  Studies have shown that it is important for sunfish to use their resources for growth instead of reproduction at younger ages and smaller sizes.  Male Bluegill can usually be discerned from females by their brighter coloration and darker orange bellies. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie were commonly observed during spring electrofishing.  A sample of 14 crappie was measured while fall electrofishing.  These fish ranged from 7.6 to 11.9 inches long with the majority (11) in the 8.5 to 9.9 inch range.     <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Beauty Lake displays fish community characteristics that are typical of lakeswithin its classification.  Northern pike continue to be fairly abundant (8/gillnetset) and most are small, however fish up to 10 pounds were noted in 1995 sampling. Electrofishing showed largemouth bass abundance to be moderate with consistentreproduction.  Walleye abundance is also moderate (4.8/gillnet set) and maintainedthrough fingerling stocking.  Large walleye are common as 41% of the summer samplewas 20 inches long or greater.  Electrofishing results also suggest good walleyefingerling survival from the 1993 stocking.  Yellow perch numbers have increasedsince 1989 resulting in an expanded forage base for pike and walleye.  Maintainingan adequate perch population is important to growth of gamefish and survival offingerling walleye.  Yellow perch also help to control bluegill numbers so stuntingis less likely to occur.     Black crappie are generally found in high abundance in Beauty Lake and 1995survey information indicates this is still the case.  A strong year class wasproduced in 1991 resulting in good numbers of 9 inch and larger crappies.  Bluegillabundance is normal with some \"keeper\" size fish (7+ inches) observed in thesampling.     Protecting and maintaining healthy stands of emergent vegetation(cattail,bulrush,wild rice) is of vital importance to the Beauty Lake fishcommunity.  These plants provide critical habitat to many fish species year-round. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Spring Trap netting was performed May 17-18 to provide pre-regulation data on the Bluegill size structure.   A bag limit of 5 sunfish was implemented on March 1, 2021 as Beauty Lake was selected for participation in the statewide Quality Sunfish Initiative.  The objective of the lowered bag limit is to reduce sunfish harvest and allow for more fish to attain larger sizes (8-10 inches).   Data collected during this survey is considered pre-regulation data due to the short time period since the inception of the reduced bag limit.  Spring trap netting is the preferred method for evaluating panfish populations and has been conducted on the lake four previous times since 2001.  Several future evaluations relating to the 5 sunfish bag limit are planned over the 10 year evaluation period and will incorporate spring trap netting to provide proper comparisons. <br> \n <br> \nSpring trap netting in 2021 captured 418 Bluegill.  This sample size was typical for Bluegill in Beauty Lake as previous spring sample sizes have ranged from 267-937 fish.  Bluegill in 2021 ranged from 3.4 - 9.1 inches and mean length was 6.55 inches.  The 2021 catch exhibited the best size structure observed to date.  Fish over 7 inches comprised 40% of the catch and fish greater than 8 inches made up 6% of the sample.   Two fish over 9 inches were measured (0.5% of sample).  Bluegill 10 inches or greater have never been observed in any sampling efforts.   Spring trap netting in 2017 produced a less impressive size structure with 11% of the fish 7 inches or longer, 1% were over 8 inches and none exceeded 9 inches.  Mean length was 6.18 inches. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill size structure goals developed for the Quality Sunfish Initiative aim for at least 35% of the sample to exceed 7 inches, 10% to exceed 8 inches, 2% over 9 inches and the persistent presence of fish 10 inches or longer.  Whether voluntary or required due to the reduced bag limit, release of larger sunfish, especially fish over 9 inches will be important if the lake is to realize its potential in reaching management goals.  Additional criteria that may be used to measure success of the reduced sunfish bag limit include: mean size, catch rate of fish over 8 inches, and mean length of the top 10% of fish.  When combining the five pre-regulation spring trap net surveys, mean size is 6.13 inches, mean catch rate of fish over 8 inches is 2.1/net, and mean length of the top 10% is 7.76 inches.   Bluegill growth is acceptable with the fish reaching 6.5 inches in length by Age 5. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie spring trap net catches can vary considerably due to sampling conditions and the Beauty Lake catches have demonstrated this variability.  Spring trap net catches in Beauty Lake have ranged from 19 fish in 2017 to 85 fish in 2021.  Almost ? of the crappies captured in 2021 were in the 9-9.9 inch length group which should be attractive to anglers.  The crappie bag limit remains at 10 fish. <br> \n   <br> \nSpring trap netting captured 50 Pumpkinseed.  Maximum length of Pumpkinseeds was 8.5 inches and 30% were 7 inches or longer.   <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Summer gillnetting was conducted in mid-July as part of a research study to determine the most effective stocking regime for moderate-sized Minnesota lakes (classes 23, 24, 25, and 31).  The stocked walleye fingerlings have been marked with oxytetracyline and the otoliths from the gillnetted walleye are checked for a mark.  The frequency of gillnetting in the lake was increased to sample walleye and check contribution to the population from various stocking rates.  The 2008 walleye gillnet catch of 2/lift was comparable to the catches from the last three surveys, 3.7/gillnet in 2006, 2.2/gillnet in 2004, and 1.5/gillnet in 2001.  The 2008 catch rate fell within the normal range for lake class 31 but continues to be below the management goal of 4 - 6 walleye per gillnet (interquartile range = 1.3 - 5).  The highest gillnet catch for Beauty Lake was 5.2/lift in 1984.  The walleye in the 2008 survey measured from 16 to 24.5 inches with a mean length of 20.6 inches.  Average weight for the walleye in the 2008 survey was 3.2 pounds compared to 2 pounds in 2006.  The last two surveys were able to sample some of the younger walleye, which were more likely to have the OTC marking.  Spring night electrofishing had also been conducted in conjunction with the last two gillnet surveys in an effort to augment the sample of smaller fish for testing. Refer to the Research report for an analysis of walleye stocking.  The six larger fish were aged by the area office and found to be Ages 9, 11, and 13. <br> \n <br> \nThe 2008 northern pike gillnet catch of 7.8/lift (n=47) was down from the 2006 catch of 10.2/gillnet (n= 61) and the lowest its been since 1960.  The catch rate fell within the normal range for the lake class and was just above the management goal of less than 7 pike per gillnet.  The highest catch was recorded in 1984 at 12.3/lift.  The pike population appeared to remain relatively stable from 1989 to 2001 with gillnet catches averaging about 8.6/lift and then there was a slight increase to 10.5/lift in 2004.  The pike population size structure has shown a definite trend of declining quality since 2001.   In 2008, the pike measured from 14 to 29 inches with a mean length of 20 inches and only 9% (n=4) exceeding 24 inches in length.  The 2006 survey showed a size range between 14 and 32 inches, a mean length of 20.7 inches, 20% (n=12) of the pike more than 24 inches with 3% (n=2) exceeding 30 inches.  In 2004, 24% of the pike caught were over 24 inches with 6% over 30 inches and in 2001, 33% exceeded 24 inches and 14% exceeded 30 inches.  The average weight of the pike in the surveys also emphasized the downward quality trend.  In the 2008 survey, the average weight was 1.75 pounds compared to 2.1 pounds in 2006, 2.8 pounds in 2004, and 3.2 pounds in 2001. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass appear to be abundant with the gillnet catch of 2.2/lift being above the 75% quartile of 1.7/gillnet for the lake class.  The gillnet catch was also the record high for Beauty Lake and up from the 2006 gillnet catch of 1.5/lift.  Daytime electrofishing was conducted in early June, which produced a catch rate of 92/hour, well above the Area Mean CPUE of 51.8/hour and the previous rates of 39/hour in both 2001 and 1995.  However, the bass catch rates may not be comparable as most of the previous electrofishing was conducted at night.  A new boat along with an additional netter was used in 2008.  A new Area Mean will be developed from catches with the new boat.  Bass in the 2008 survey were between 7 and 19 inches in length with an average length of 12.4 inches and a PSD of 42.  The length distribution for the electrofishing sample was 4 to 19.6 inches with an average length of only 9.5 inches and PSD of 25.  Both of the PSDs were below the Area Mean of 53. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch numbers continue to be low in Beauty Lake with the 2008 catch of 3.3/lift comparable to the 2006 catch of 2.7/gillnet and below the 25% quartile of 3.4/gillnet for the lake class.  The highest catch was 46.5/gillnet in 1960 but had been at 37.3/gillnet as recently as 2004.  The perch measured from 5 to 7 inches suggesting the presence of only one to two year classes.  When the pike population stabilized between 1989 and 2001, perch numbers appeared to rebound, going from 4.5/gillnet in 1989 to 42.2/gillnet in 2001.  The perch catch showed a slight drop in 2004 to 37.3/gillnet as pike increased, however, as the pike catch remained around 10+/gillnet between 2004 and 2006, there appeared to be a significant decrease in perch abundance (2.7/gillnet).   <br> \n <br> \nOne change observed in the 2008 survey was black crappie abundance.  The 2008 gillnet catch of 9.8/lift was a significant increase from 2.2/gillnet in 2006 and above the 75% quartile of 3.5/gillnet for the lake class.  The highest crappie catch was recorded in 1989 at 11/gillnet and the lowest was 1.3/gillnet in 1960.  Crappie in the 2008 gillnet survey measured from 6 to 12 inches with a mean length of 8.3 inches and modal length of 8 - 8.5 inches.  Fish exceeding 9 inches accounted for 12% (n=7) of the sample.  Black crappie were also netted during the 2008 bass electrofishing effort.  A total of 32 crappie between 5 and 10 inches were measured.  Mean length of the sample was comparable at 8.2 inches to the summer sample with the modal length being the same.  Six or 19% of the crappies were more than 9 inches in length. <br> \n <br> \nCatches for brown bullhead and yellow bullhead suggest high population densities for the two species.  Catch rates for black bullhead, bowfin, and white sucker, meanwhile, were below their respective 25% quartiles for the lake class suggesting low densities.  Some bluegill, hybrid sunfish and pumpkinseed sunfish were also caught during the survey, but densities for those species are usually measured with trapnet catch rates.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Beauty Lake (DOW# 77-0035-00; Lake Class 31) is a 238 acre lake located near Long Prairie, Minnesota. A Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MNDNR) owned concrete boat ramp is located on the southeast shore. Beauty Lake has 3.55 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 27 feet. Beauty Lake is in Lake Class 31; lakes in this class generally have very hard water, and are regular shaped. <br> \n <br> \nBeauty Lake is a typical bass/panfish lake in the Little Falls area. Anglers can expect good numbers of Largemouth Bass with fish up to 20 inches and Bluegill up to 10 inches. Some larger Northern Pike were found in the 2017 survey with almost a quarter of pike larger than 24 inches and fish up to 34 inches. The average Black Crappie sampled was 8 inches with some up to 9 inches. Walleye are still stocked in Beauty Lake and a few were sampled in the last survey, so anglers should count on any Walleye caught as a bonus. <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species that anglers can expect to encounter include Black Bullhead, Bowfin (Dogfish), Brown Bullhead, Hybrid Sunfish, Pumpkinseed Sunfish, Rock Bass, White Sucker, Yellow Bullhead, and Yellow Perch. <br> \nPeople can have significant impacts on lakes and the fish populations they support. Fish harvest, lakeshore development, removal of shoreline vegetation, and introductions of aquatic invasive species (AIS) can all adversely affect fish populations. Curly Leaf Pondweed has been identified in Beauty Lake. AIS can be moved from infested to non-infested waters by anglers, boaters, and lake shore owners and can adversely impact lakes and fish populations. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access. If you suspect an infestation of an invasive species in this lake, save a specimen and report it to a local natural resource office. Additional information on all of these topics can be found on the DNR website (www.dnr.state.mn.us) or by contacting the Little Falls Area Fisheries office. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>    Beauty Lake is a typical bass/panfish lake in central Minnesota that provides a diversity of angling opportunties.  The lake has a reputation for producing very good northern pike fishing seasonally.  Bluegills are the primary summer target while black crappies typically provide a winter fishery.   The lake has development on most of the south half of the lake which includes a bible camp on the west shore.  With the north end being mostly marsh, development is set back further from the lakeshore or absent.  Water clarity was slightly better than what the average has been for the lake in July.  Vegetation was found to grow to a depth of 13 feet with the most common submerged vegetation being coontail, filamentous algae, and flatstem pondweed.  White and yellow waterlilies along with wild rice were common around the shoreline.  The two most common substrates in the shallow shoal waters were sand and detritus.  Beauty Lake has a fairly buffered watershed with much of it being forested, grasslands, and marsh. <br> \n    The northern pike numbers appear to be higher than what is desired but some quality fish can be still found as two of the fish netted were over 30 inches in length.  The average size seen in the summer survey, however, was about 21 inches or around 2 pounds.   Anglers should consider keeping northern pike less than 24 inches as a harvestable surplus of small fish exists.   Reducing the population of small northern pike could be beneficial to the entire fish community.  Walleye management in particular would benefit from lower pike numbers.   Yellow perch numbers showed a real decrease since the last survey which could be a result of high pike numbers and walleye stocking.  Perch can be an important prey species for both the northern pike and walleye.  They can also be instrumental in helping maintain a well balanced bluegill population with fast growing, quality individuals. <br> \n    The walleye population in the lake has been sustained through fingerling stocking in odd years and abundance typically has been near the upper end of the normal range when compared to similar type lakes.  A wide range of sizes were apparent in the walleye catch.  Walleye ranging from 10 to 25 inches with the average size being 17 inches or about 2 pounds.  Fish up to 27 inches have been documented in past surveys.  Anglers on the lake during the survey reported catching or heard reports of walleyes being caught earlier in the season. <br> \n    Beauty Lake supports a good largemouth bass population.  While the average size seen in the summer survey was about 13 inches, the lake does provide opportunities to catch trophy size bass in the 18 inch range.   Many of the summer fishermen seem to be seeking bluegills while black crappies  seem to be more popular in the winter.  Some nice size bluegills were caught  during the survey and anglers on the lake also reported catching good size pumpkinseeds.  Few crappies were seen in the survey which is not that unusual as they can be a difficult species to catch in nets.  Most of the crappies on the survey were under 9 inches in length except for one which was almost 11 inches. <br> \n    Other fish species that are present in the lake include bowfin or dogfish, brown bullhead, white sucker, and yellow bullhead.  Yellow bullheads were the most abundant on the two species of bullheads.  Both species had quality size fish over 12 inches in length in the catches.  All of the brown bullheads were over 12 inches while the average size of the yellow bullheads was 11 inches. <br> \n    Neascus or black spot was common on the northern pike and yellow perch.  Neascus is a trematode or parasite that is usually found in the skin of the fish.  The life cycle of the parasite also includes snails and fish-eating birds, such as herons and bitterns.  Skinning the fish removes most of the parasites and cooking will kill the rest.  Humans cannot be infested. <br> \n     Protecting the water quality in Beauty Lake has been and should be a high priority of the lake association and landowners around the lake.  Preservation of the emergent vegetation beds can improve water quality, reduce shoreline erosion, and protect valuable fish habitat.  Buffer strips along inlets and lakeshore property are encouraged to reduce nutrients entering the water.  Maintaining adequate septics, keeping grass clippings and raked leaves out of the lake, and the common sense use of lawn fertilizer will also help reduce nutrient loading, thus slowing algae and excess weed growth.  The Minnesota Pollution Control Agency and Todd County Planning and Zoning Office in Long Prairie have good websites which provide information for shoreline property owners. <br> \n <br> \nMPCA  - \"Guide to Lake Protection & Management\" <br> \nwww.pca.state.mn.us/water/lakeprotection.html <br> \n <br> \nTodd County - \"Information for Shoreline Property Owners\" <br> \nwww.co.todd.mn.us/PlanningZoning/planning.htm <br> \n</p>",
