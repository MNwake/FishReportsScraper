A public access is located within the State Forest campground that adjoins the lake.  Competition for campsites is high on weekends in the summer.  Pickerel Lake is managed primarily for northern pike, largemouth bass, and black crappie.  Anglers can expect light fishing pressure, mainly from campground users.  Compared to past assessments and similar lakes, the northern pike population is in good shape.  Northerns near 30 inches were netted with most of the sample between 20 and 22 inches.  Largemouth bass should provide plenty of angling opportunity.  Bass were more abundant than in 1999 with half the catch exceeding 12 inches.  Black crappie were at normal levels and were similar to the 1999 numbers.  Crappie over 11 inches were present but most were between 7 and 8 inches.  Bluegill adundance was high compared to similar lakes and past net catches on Pikerel Lake.  Although the average size was only 5.3 inches 20% of the catch surpassed 6.5 inches and may be acceptable to some anglers. </p>",

A public access is located within the adjoining State Forest campground.  Competition for campsites is high on weekends in the summer.  Pickerel Lake is managed primarily for Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, and Black Crappie.  Anglers can expect light fishing pressure, mainly from campground users.   <br> \n <br> \nA standard lake survey was conducted on Pickerel Lake during the week of August 29, 2022 to evaluate the current status of the fish population.  Evaluation of the fish population utilized two gill nets and nine trap nets.  Only seven northerns were captured in the gill nets and trap nets, measuring between 20.0 to 34.0 inches. Black Crappie abundance was average for similar lakes in the area at 5.1 per trap net lift.  Crappie lengths were 3.8 to 14.8 inches with a 7.3 inch average.  Bluegill abundance was normal compared to similar lakes.  Although the average size was only 5.2 inches bluegill exceeding 7 inches were present.  Yellow Perch were also present in the survey and measured 5.4 to 7.1 inches with an average size of 6.2 inches <br> \n</p>",

A public access is located within the adjoining State Forest campground.  Competition for campsites is high on weekends in the summer.  Pickerel Lake is managed primarily for northern pike, largemouth bass, and black crappie.   <br> \n <br> \nAnglers can expect light fishing pressure, mainly from campground users.  Compared to past assessments and similar lakes, the largemouth bass population is in good shape and should provide plenty of angling opportunity.  Bass were abundant with half the catch exceeding 15 inches.  Only three northerns were captured in the gill netting, all just under 24 inches.  Black crappie were larger but less abundant than in past assessments.  Crappie over 10 inches were present.  Bluegill abundance, while normal compared to similar lakes, has decreased with only a slight increase in size.  Although the average size was only 5.2 inches bluegill exceeding 8 inches were present.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Pickerel Lake is a 53-acre lake located in northern Pine County about three miles east of the town of Nickerson and State Highway 23.  The Nemadji State Forest surrounds the lake.  Of the 96,100 acres that make up this state forest, 93,300 acres are managed by the MN DNR.  The shoreline surrounding Pickerel Lake is made up of, in order of abundance, bog land, undeveloped forest or woodland, marshland, and the Gafvert Campground and Day Use Area.  The campground has 9 campsites with fire rings, tables, outdoor toilets, and potable water.  A fee is charged for camping in designated state forest campgrounds.  A public water access is located adjacent to the campground in the day use area.  The popularity of state forest trail use during the summer months limits available weekend camping space.  Outdoor fishing and camping enthusiasts may want to visit this lake during the week to avoid the crowd.  The fishery in this lake is managed primarily for northern pike with largemouth bass, bluegill sunfish, and black crappie as the secondary species.A standard lake survey was conducted during the week of July 19, 1999 to evaluate the current status of the fish population, the physical, chemical, and biological factors concerning habitat, and the water quality.  Evaluation of the fish population utilized spring night electrofishing, two gill nets, six trap nets, and three shoreline seine hauls.  The selected gear types were chosen based on guidelines obtained from the MN DNR Manual of Instructions for Lake Survey.  Habitat and water quality data were also collected based on guidelines from this manual.Numbers of northern pike along with an average weight of 1.5 pounds, were normal for this lake type.  Fish lengths ranged from 16.7-37.4 inches with an average length of 21.1 inches.  Pickerel Lakes northern pike growth rate was found to be normal.  Largemouth bass numbers and size appear to be excellent for lakes of this type.  Bass lengths ranged from 6.9-18.4 inches with 52% of the fish sampled at 16.0 inches or greater.  Ages for larger bass extended from 6 to 9 years old.  Growth for largemouth at all ages was determined to be normal when compared to statewide averages.  Bluegill sunfish abundance was down from previous surveys, but remained within a normal range for lakes of this type.  Their lengths extended from 3.5-7.9 inches and growth was normal.  Black crappie numbers and average weight were representitive of normal for this lake type with lengths ranging from 5.9-9.1 inches.  Reproductive success for bluegill was excellent while black crappie, northern pike, and yellow perch displayed some success.  Other fish species found during the survey included hybrid sunfish, pumpkinseed sunfish, white sucker, and yellow perch.  Snapping turtles and painted turtles were also observed.  The plant community in and around Pickerel Lake was found to be diverse and included some soft-water species (floatingleaf burreed) and  bog-land species (leatherleaf, pitcher plant, and cottongrass).Anglers can expect smaller northern pike and bluegill sunfish to be part of their fishing experience; however, the chance of hooking a larger northern pike or bluegill sunfish is possible.  The likelihood of catching a quality sized largemouth bass is also very good.  Fishing enthusiasts are encouraged to release larger bass to maintain the high quality of this fishery. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A LAKE SURVEY WAS CONDUCTED IN JULY OF 1989 ON PICKEREL LAKE. TWO GILLNETS AND FOUR TRAPNETS WERE SET IN ORDER TO OBTAIN INFORMATION PERTAINING TO THE PRESENT FISH POPULATION IN THE LAKE. SHORELINE SEINING WAS PERFORMED IN EARLY SEPTEMBER IN AN EFFORT TO EVALUATE THE NATURAL REPRODUCTION OF THE FISH SPECIES PRESENT. BASED ON RESPECTIVE LOCAL MEDIANS AND OTHER COM- PARATIVE DATA THE FISH POPULATION CAN BE DESCRIBED AS FOLLOWS: THE NORTHERN PIKE NET CATCH ROSE SLIGHTLY FROM THE PREVIOUS SURVEY, HOWEVER, REMAIN JUST BELOW THE LOCAL MEDIAN OF 3.50/SET. THE LENGTH FREQUENCY DISTRIBUTION RANGED FROM 17.0 TO 24.9 INCHES FOR ALL NETTING IN COMPARISON TO THE 1984 RANGE OF 12.0 TO 29.9 INCHES. THE SIZE OF NORTHERN PIKE PRESENT IN THE CATCH HAS DECREASED AS THE MEDIAN LENGTH GROUP DROPPED FROM 25.0-25.9 INCHES IN 1984 TO 17.0-17.9 INCHES DURING THE RECENT SURVEY. THE MEAN WEIGHT HAS ALSO FALLEN FROM 3.24 POUNDS TO 1.50 POUNDS DURING THE SAME TIME PERIOD. A TOTAL OF NINE NORTHERN PIKE WERE AGED REPRESENTING AGE GROUPS III-V. THESE FISH DISPLAYED NORMAL GROWTH RATES WHEN COMPARED TO STATEWIDE AVERAGES. YELLOW PERCH NET CATCHES ALSO INCREASED SLIGHTLY SINCE THE PREVIOUS SURVEY, HOWEVER, THE RATE ALSO REMAINS SLIGHTLY BELOW THE LOCAL MEDIAN OF 8.58/SET. THE MEDIAN LENGTH GROUP WAS 5.5-5.9 INCHES AND THE FISH RANGED IN LENGTH FROM 4.5 TO 6.4 INCHES. TEN FISH WERE AGED AND EXHIBITED NOR- MAL GROWTH RATES. THE BLUEGILL SUNFISH NET CATCH DECREASED FROM THE PREVIOUS SURVEY AND WAS BELOW THE LOCAL MEDIAN OF 20.00/SET. THE LENGTH FREQUENCY RANGED FROM 2.5 TO 8.4 INCHES WITH 6.0-6.4 INCHES AS THE MEDIAN LENGTH GROUP. THIRTY-EIGHT FISH WERE AGED REPRE- SENTING ALL AGE GROUPS FROM II-X. NORMAL RATES WERE EXHIBITED BY THE FISH IN THIS SAMPLE THE PUMPKINSEDD SUNFISH NET CATCH REMAINED UN- CHANGED FROM 1984, BELOW THE LOCAL MEDIAN OF 3.00/SET. A MEDIAN LENGTH GROUP OF 4.5 TO 4.9 INCHES WAS FOUND AS FISH RANGED IN SIZE FROM 4.0 TO 7.9 INCHES. AGE GROUPS II-IV AND ALSO VIII WERE REPRESENTED BY THE EIGHT FISH THAT WERE AGED. THESE FISH SHOWED NORMAL GROWTH RATES. THE BLACK CRAPPIE NET CATCH DECREASED FROM THE PREVIOUS SURVEY AND WAS BELOW THE LOCAL MEDIAN. THE LENGTH FREQUENCY DISTRIBUTION RANGED FROM 3.5 TO 9.4 INCHES WITH A MEDIAN LENGTH GROUP OF 6.5-6.9 INCHES. SLOW GROWTH RATES WERE EXHIBITED BY THE SEVENTEEN FISH AGED. REPRESENTED IN THE SAMPLE WERE AGE GROUPS I-VIII. A SINGLE LARGEMOUTH BASS WAS CAPTURED IN A TRAPNET THE FISH WAS 17.2 INCHES IN LENGTH AT THE TIME OF CAPTURE, WEIGHED 3.0 PDS, AND WAS AGED AT SEVEN YEARS. TWO BROWN BULLHEADS WERE ALSO CAUGHT IN TRAPNETS WHICH IS A RATE BELOW THE LOCAL MEDIAN OF 1.23/SET YELLOW BULLHEADS AND GOLDEN SHINERS WERE TAKEN BY TEST NETTING IN 1984 BUT WERE ABSENT IN THE 1989 SAMPLING. WHITE SUCKER WAS ALSO ABSENT IN TEST NETS IN 1989 THOUGH THE NET CATCHES IN 1974 AND 1984 WERE 22.00/SET AND 2.50/SET RESPECTIVELY. YOUNG OF THE YEAR LARGEMOUTH BASS AND BLUEGILL SUNFISH WERE CAUGHT IN THE SHORELINE SEINE HAULS.</p>",
