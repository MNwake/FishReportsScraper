                "narrative": "<p>Bertram Lake is a small (100 acre) lake in Wright County near the town of Monticello.  It has a maximum depth of 44 feet and a large watershed dominated by agriculture and forest.  A small public access is located on the south side of the lake, but only electric motors are allowed.  A summer camp is located north of the lake with a swim beach along shore; the rest of the lake shore is undeveloped.  The land around the lake is being purchased by Wright County and the City of Monticello to use as a park.  This is the first survey since 1984. <br> \n <br> \nAquatic vegetation was sparse and shallow and no invasive species were found.  Aquatic plants grew to a maximum depth of only 3.0 feet, although water clarity was 8.0 feet in June and remained clear throughout the summer.  Yellow waterlily and cattail surrounded much of the lake. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike numbers were within the range of expected values for lakes similar to Bertram, but pike size was small.  Average length and weight were 19.4 inches and 1.4 pounds and lengths ranged from 11.9 to 25.2 inches.  Only two fish were longer than 24 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass were sampled by daytime boat electrofishing at the end of May, covering the entire shoreline.  The catch rate was well below the Montrose Area average and no smaller bass were caught.  Largemouth Bass ranged in length from 15.6 to 19.1 inches.  Results were probably lowered by very clear, shallow water and plenty of sunshine.  Many fish were seen avoiding the boat; sampling at night would likely increase the catch. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill were the most abundant species in the survey, but the catch rate was still within the expected range of values.  Bluegill were small, ranging from 3.0 to 7.5 inches long and averaged 3.9 inches and less than 0.1 pounds. The Black Crappie catch rate was low, but within the expected range of values.  Crappies ranged from 5.0 to 12.4 inches long and averaged 8.5 inches and 0.4 pounds. <br> \n <br> \nOther species caught in low numbers included: Black Bullhead, Brown Bullhead, Common Carp, Green Sunfish, Hybrid Sunfish, Pumpkinseed, and Yellow Bullhead.  The low number of bullheads (7 total) was surprising for the area.  Yellow Perch were sampled in average numbers in 1984, but were absent in the 2014 survey. <br> \n</p>",
