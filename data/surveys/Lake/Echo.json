The gillnet catch of 8.0/lift represents a small decline from historic levels, however Splake numbers are sufficient to sustain the fishery. No Splake over 12 inches were taken, however anglers commonly catch Splake in the 12 to 14 inch range.     Recent assessments have shown a decline in gillnet catches of Rainbow Trout. No Rainbow Trout were taken in gillnets during this survey, and only 2 were captured in trapnets. A more effective sampling method may have to be found as anglers are catching Rainbow Trout but fisheries sampling gear is not.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Echo Lake is 42 acres, has a maximum depth of 61 feet, and is located approximately 16 miles northeast of Finland, MN.  There is a gravel back-in access on the southeast side of the lake off of Lake County Road #7.  There are numerous shore fishing spots along the side of Lake County Road #7.    <br> \n <br> \nThe 2018 standard survey was conducted to monitor the fish community in Echo Lake and continue to evaluate the trout stocking for the lake.  Echo Lake is stocked annually with 3,000 Rainbow Trout yearlings in the spring.  The Rainbow Trout gill net catch was slightly above average compared to similar lakes in the area.  The trap net catch of Rainbow Trout was also above average for the area.   The average size of Rainbow Trout was 12.3 inches and 0.7 pounds.  The largest Rainbow Trout was 16.1 inches.  Three year classes were seen and indicate Rainbow Trout are able to survive in Echo Lake.   <br> \n <br> \nAnnual fall stocking of 2,500 Splake fingerlings maintain a Splake population in Echo Lake.  The Splake gill net catch was lower than average and one of the lowest seen in the lake.  However, the trap net catch for Splake was well above average and one of the highest seen in the lake.  The average size was 12.5 inches and 0.7 pounds.  The largest fish seen was 16.8 inches.  Splake are able to survive and grow in Echo Lake as three year classes were sampled.  <br> \n <br> \nWhite Sucker were also sampled with the survey nets have been caught in every survey since 1987 but generally at low numbers. <br> \n <br> \nEcho Lake is one of the better \"designated stream trout\" lakes in the Finland area.  Anglers tend to target the lake in the early spring and late fall for open water fishing although fish can be caught throughout the summer.  The winter trout season is another great time to target Rainbow Trout and Splake on Echo Lake and the angling pressure is usually high.   <br> \n</p>",

There is a public access with earthen ramp suitable for smaller boats on the south side of the lake as well as several places to fish from shore along Lake County Road 7. The lake is stocked with yearling Rainbow Trout each spring and fall to provide fish for the summer and winter angling seasons. In addition, fingerling Splake are stocked each fall that live in the lake from year to year to provide additional angling opportunities.  <br> \n <br> \nThe 2023 fisheries survey sampled low numbers of Rainbow Trout that were stocked in spring based on their size. The survey occurred toward the end of the summer season when most harvest had taken place and before fall yearling stocking meant to supplement the population for the winter fishery. The few Rainbow Trout caught does confirm that not all the fish stocked in spring are harvested by anglers during the summer.    <br> \n <br> \nSplake catch was the highest to date for the lake, but only a few fish were longer than fourteen inches. These results are similar to previous surveys of the lake that found Splake regularly survive in the lake for multiple years, but seldom reach larger sizes compared to other stream trout lakes in the area.  <br> \n <br> \nEcho Lake is a popular trout lake and receives a good amount of angling effort in summer and winter. Annual stocking with Rainbow Trout and Splake will continue into the future to provide quality fishing opportunities for anglers.</p>",

Echo Lake was found to support a splake (and brook trout) population of between 187 and 1,148 fish (probably about 470 fish).Few rainbow trout were taken in gill nets or trap nets, but electrofishing indicated that fairly high numbers of 8 to 10 inch fish from the 2002 stocking were present.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Echo Lake is a \"Designated Stream Trout Lake\" that is stocked annually with yearling rainbow trout and fingerling splake.  The lake is open to angling during the stream trout season (lakes) only and possessing minnows or using them for bait on designated stream trout lakes is prohibited.  Only one line is permitted at any time.  All stream trout must have head, tail, fins and skin intact when being transported.  There is a back down gravel ramp on the south end of the lake and the lake is easily accessible from Lake County Road #7 for shore fishing.  Echo Lake is one of the more popular stream trout lakes in the Finland area.The splake catch in 2005 was in the normal range compared to other lakes in this class, but was lower than past catches in this lake.  This lake is usually a decent lake for catching splake, especially during the winter trout season.  Splake in this assessment had a mean length of 9.2 inches with a maximum of 12.4 inches.  Splake caught by anglers during the winter trout season may be somewhat larger.  Most of the splake caught by anglers are from 1-3 years old.  Due to natural mortality and angler harvest not many splake survive to 4 years in this lake.Rainbow trout were collected in fairly low number in this assessment and the size ranged from 12.8 inches to 14.0 inches.  All the rainbow trout in this assessment were age-2 fish. Age-1 year-class (8-10 inch) fish had not been stocked yet at the time of the assessment, and due to natural mortality and angler harvest few rainbow trout survive to reach age 2 or older.</p>",

The lake is located 13 miles northeast of Finland.  Access is a gravel ramp off of Lake County Highway #7 along the southeast shore. <br> \n <br> \nCold water temperatures and good dissolved oxygen levels are essential for trout growth and survival.  To assess these important criteria, six automatic temperature loggers were deployed at the deepest location in the lake, they were suspended at depths of 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, and 35 feet on May 23, 2018.  Dissolved oxygen checks were conducted throughout the summer at the same location.  During the temperature and oxygen test performed on September 20 the crew was not able to locate the underwater buoys marking the logger chain.  Attempts made to recover the gear were unsuccessful and it is assumed that the logger chain was tampered with and either lost or stolen. Echo Lake is stocked annually with Rainbow Trout yearlings, Splake fingerlings and occasionally Rainbow Trout brood stock when available. <br> \n <br> \nThe results of the investigation indicate that during the summer of 2018, Echo Lake maintained sufficient oxygen and thermal habitat for the survival of stream trout.  These parameters will continue to be carefully monitored in future investigations to check the suitability of Echo Lake for trout stocking. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Echo Lake is a Designated Trout Lake located on a maintained gravel road 15 miles northeast of Finland, Minnesota.  Angling is allowed during the open trout season only, and the possession and use of live minnows is prohibited.  A gravel ramp on the south end of the lake provides access to watercraft, and shorefishing is accessible from Lake County Road #7 on the east side of the lake.     The gamefish population is comprised primarily of splake and rainbow trout which are stocked annually.  There is also a remnant population of lake trout and brook trout.     Test nets in 1997 indicate splake numbers are high when compared to other splake lakes in the Finland Management Area.  Splake up to 13.5 inches were observed, but the most common size sampled was from 10 inches to 12 inches.     Rainbow trout were sampled in low numbers, however this species has traditionally been difficult to sample with standard netting gear. These results should not discourage anglers from pursuing rainbow trout as good fishing reports are not uncommon. The rainbow trout in test nets in 1997 ranged in size from 12.4 inches to 15.3 inches.     Although lake trout have not been stocked since 1985 Echo Lake does support a very small population, but they are not commonly caught by anglers.  The lone lake trout sampled in 1997 was 13.6 pounds.     Echo Lake is no longer managed for brook trout. The last stocking in 1996 is providing a low population to anglers.  As these brook trout complete their life cycle in one or two years none will be present in the lake. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Echo Lake is a 42.1 acre \"Designated Stream Trout Lake\" with a maximum depth of 61 feet.  Much of the eastern shore is near Lake County Road #7, allowing for ample shore fishing.  The south end of the lake has a gravel back-in access off of Lake County Road #7.  The lake stocked with three thousand Rainbow Trout yearlings each spring.  The yearlings average around 1/3 pound when stocked.  The 2013 assessment sampled higher than normal numbers of Rainbow Trout ranging in size from 11.0 to 17.1 inches at capture and had an average weight of 0.73 pounds.  Rainbow Trout provide good open water angling opportunities.  Fall stocking of 2,500 Splake fingerlings maintains a Splake population in the lake. The 2013 assessment captured Splake ranging from 5.7 to 20.1 inches and weighed an average of 0.37 pounds.  The Splake numbers were above average for similar lakes in the area.  Splake provide excellent angling opportunities during the winter trout season on Echo Lake.  White Suckers are also present in low numbers in Echo Lake.  Anglers tend to target Echo Lake in the early spring and late fall for open water fishing and the first few weeks of the winter trout season.  </p>",
