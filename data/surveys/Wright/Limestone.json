                "narrative": "<p>Limestone Lake is a 188 acre recreational development lake located north of Maple Lake in north central Wright County. The lake has a maximum depth of 34 feet and an average summer clarity of about ten feet. There is a County-owned public access located on the north side of the lake. A standard lake survey was conducted in 2017 to monitor changes in the fishery from the last survey completed in 2008. In addition to the standard survey, an Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) survey was conducted in late July. Those results will be summarized in a different report. <br> \n <br> \nEmergent and floating leaf vegetation covered almost a third of the lake in June, primarily cattail and white waterlily. Submerged vegetation was not surveyed, but coontail and northern watermilfoil were the dominant species in 2008. <br> \n <br> \nLimestone Lake is managed for naturally occurring species and Walleye have not been stocked since 1992. There were three Walleye sampled by gill net in 2017 and they ranged in length from 21 to 23 inches. <br> \n <br> \nThe catch of Northern Pike was the highest recorded and above the expected range of values for similar lakes. Pike were small and ranged in length from 14 to 32 inches with an average length and weight of 19 inches and 1.5 pounds. Only eight percent of the Northern Pike sampled were longer than 24 inches. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass were sampled during daytime electrofishing on May 23, 2017. A total of 61 Largemouth Bass were captured in 1.6 hours of sampling for a catch rate of 38.4/hour. This is slightly lower than the Sauk Rapids area daytime average of 43.3/hour. Largemouth Bass ranged in length from 6 to 17 inches with an average length of 10 inches. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill catches were lower than previous surveys, but still within the range of expected values for similar lakes. Bluegill ranged in length from 3 to 8 inches with an average length of five inches.  <br> \n <br> \nThe catch of Black Crappie was lower than previous surveys and lower than the range of expected values for similar lakes. Black Crappie ranged in length from 7 to 10 inches with an average length of 8 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch numbers have historically have been low and 2017 was no exception. Only three yellow perch were sampled during the entire survey. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled during the survey included: Black Bullhead, Bowfin (dogfish), Brown Bullhead, Green Sunfish, Hybrid Sunfish, Pumpkinseed and Yellow Bullhead. <br> \n</p>",

Northern Pike, Walleye, and Black Crappie numbers were within the range of expected values for lakes similar to Limestone. \nBluegill numbers were much greater than the range of expected values. \n\nForage species present are: Yellow Perch, White Sucker, Brook Silversides, Banded killifish, and Blackchin, Blacknose, and Spottail shiners. Of these, Blackchin Shiners and Yellow Perch young-of-year were most abundant in shoreline seining and 27% respectively, by numbers. \n\nNorthern Pike were captured at a rate of 7.5/gill net and averaged 1.25 pounds. They ranged in length from 11.5 to 33.8 inches and 16 inch fish were most abundant. Age classes 1-5 and 7 were represented in the sample. Age 2 Northern Pike were most abundant and numbers decreased progressively with age. Catch rates are statistically similar to past surveys. Growth rates were near normal. Four Walleye were captured for a catch rate of 0.7/gill net which is equal to the previous survey. They represented age classes equal to that of the previous survey.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Limestone Lake is a 188 acre recreational development lake located in north central Wright County.  Maximum depth is 34 feet.  Little oxygen was present below 18 feet in mid-July.  Water clarity was good and the aquatic plant community was diverse.   Northern milfoil and coontail were widespread.  Only a few sprigs of curly-leaf pondweed were observed at or near the surface in June.  This was the first survey since 1998. <br> \n <br> \nThe access to Limestone Lake is adjacent to a small Wright County Park located on the northeast shoreline.  The lake is located in a rural area with modest shoreline development.  One campground was present on the lake.  Much of the shoreline is fringed with cattails and aquatic plants, presenting excellent fisheries habitat.   <br> \n <br> \nLimestone Lake is managed for naturally occurring species and no walleye have been stocked since 1992.  Not surprisingly then only four walleye were sampled by all gear in 2008.  The gill net catch was below the expected range for similar lakes.  Walleye ranged from 18 to 23 inches and averaged 20 inches and three pounds.  Anglers can expect only a rare walleye in the creel. <br> \n <br> \nThe northern pike gill net catch was within the range of expected values.  Northern pike  averaged 20 inches and two pounds.  Growth was within statewide averages. Fifteen percent of northern pike were longer than 24 inches.  Angling for small northern pike should be good.  No muskellunge were sampled during 2008, but occasionally we hear of one that moves down from Sugar Lake, a designated muskellunge lake. <br> \n <br> \nTwenty-two largemouth bass were sampled by night electrofishing on May 13, 2008.  The catch rate was less than other lakes in Wright County.  Bass of all sizes were captured.   The average largemouth was 12 inches long and weighed a little more than one pound. Growth was similar to statewide averages.  Largemouth reached 12 inches between ages four and five.  Even though the catch rate was somewhat low Limestone has the reputation of being an excellent lake for largemouth. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers can expect good fishing for small bluegill and black crappie.  Trap net catches for bluegill and black crappie were similar to 1998 and within expected ranges.   Growth of bluegill was near the average for similar lakes.   Black crappie reached 6.6 inches by age three. <br> \n  <br> \nOnly eight yellow perch were sampled by gill nets and trap nets in 2008, but numbers have historically been low.  The lack of yellow perch led to the decision to cease walleye stocking.  In the absence of this forage species northern pike grow slowly.           <br> \n <br> \nBanded killifish, a sensitive species, was collected during shoreline seining.  Other fish sampled in 2008 were bowfin, Iowa darter, bluntnose minnow, brook silverside, green, hybrid and pumpkinseed sunfish, yellow bullhead and white sucker.</p>",

Ten sampling sites were evenly spaced around the shoreline and each site was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining, except seven sites where deep water or dense vegetation prevented the use of a seine. Nearshore sampling captured 21 species of fish, including four species that are intolerant of shoreline disturbance and/or poor water quality (Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Least Darter, and Iowa Darter). <br> \n <br> \nThe near shore fish survey data will be combined with gill net and trap net data from the 2017 summer survey to describe the fish community and provide a fish based Index of Biotic Integrity (FIBI) score based on expectations for similar lakes. <br> \n <br> \nThis survey is contributing to a watershed assessment process in coordination with the MN Pollution Control Agency. Limestone Lake is located in the Mississippi River - St. Cloud Watershed. <br> \n</p>",

Golden Shiner, White Sucker, Black Bullhead, and Brown Bullhead were also taken.  The Northern Pike catch (8.5/gill net), which has historically been high, was again above the range of expected values for lakes similar to Limestone.  Average weight (1.7 pounds) was below the range of expected values.  Northern Pike lengths ranged from 11.5 to 30.9 inches. Ages 1 through 4 were sampled and growth rates were average for a Minnesota lake.  One 33 inch Muskellunge that weighed seven pounds was caught.  No Muskellunge have been stocked in Limestone Lake and this fish is thought to have migrated from Sugar Lake.  Walleye from 14 to 27 inches long, ages 2 through 10, were caught.  The catch rate of 2.2/gill net was within expected values for similar lakes.  Growth rate was average and average weight (3.1 pounds) was above the expected range.  One Yellow Perch was captured (0.2/gill net), which was below expected values; its weight (0.05 lb.) was also below expected values.  \n\nPrincipal species sampled with trap nets were Black Crappie, Bluegill, and Pumpkinseed.  Yellow Bullhead, Common Carp, and Bowfin were also captured.  The Black Crappie catch (1.5/trap net) was below the range of expected values for lakes similar to Limestone, whereas average weight (0.3 lb.) was within expected values.  Black Crappie from 5.5 to 9.4 inches were caught.  Bluegill (25.7/trap net) and Pumpkinseed (1.5/trap net) numbers were within the range of expected values for similar lakes.  Average weight for Bluegill (0.14 lb.) was below the expected range, while average weight for Pumpkinseed was within expected values.  Maximum length for all sunfish was 7.4 inches.  \n\nLargemouth Bass were sampled by night electrofishing on 5/14/92. Forty-four bass were caught, with lengths from 5.0 to 18.5 inches (ages 2 through 6).  Average weight was 0.8 pounds and growth rates were average for a Minnesota lake.  The Largemouth Bass catch rate was 15.5/hour (run time), which translates to 42.1/hour of actual on time.\n</p>",

Northern pike abundance was above the upper expected value, walleye abundance wasbetween lower and mid-range expected values, and yellow perch abundance was below the lowexpected value for lakes similar to Limestone Lake.The gill net catch rate for northern pike has appeared to increase from 8.50/lift in 1992 to11.50/lift in 1998, and mean length decreased from 18.9 inches in 1992 to 17.0 inches in 1998. Northern pike growth was slightly above average for Minnesota lakes as fish sampled reached12.9 inches by Age I, 16.5 inches by Age II, 19.2 inches by Age III, and 22.5 inches by Age IV.   The gill net catch rate for walleye appeared to decrease from 2.17/lift in 1992 to 1.33/lift in 1998,and mean weight per fish decreased from 3.07 to 2.79 lbs.  Walleye fingerlings and adults were stocked in 1992.  Walleye growth appeared to be above the statewide average as fish reached 16.8, 18.6, 21.0, and 25.7 inches by Age IV, V, VI, and VII, respectively.The gill net catch rate for yellow perch has appeared to increase from 0.17/lift in 1992, to0.33/lift in 1998.  Only two individuals were captured, with a mean length of 5.9 inches.  Bothcatches were below low-range expected values for similar lakes.  Relative abundance estimates of fish from trap nets in 1998 consisted of three major species:bluegill (34.00/set), pumpkinseed sunfish (4.50/set) and black crappie (3.17/set).  Pumpkinseedsunfish abundance was above upper-range expected values for lakes similar lakes, while bluegillabundance was between mid and upper-range expected values, and black crappie abundance wasbetween the low and mid-range expected values.  The trap net catch for bluegill appeared to decrease from 42.17/set in 1992 to 34.00/set in 1998.Length of fish sampled in 1998 ranged from 3.0 to 7.5 inches, with a mean length of 4.5 inches. Growth for Age III through VIII  fish was below average, as fish reached  4.32, 5.50, 5.52 , 6.52,6.85, and 7.44 inches, respectively.The trap net catch for pumpkinseed sunfish has appeared to increase from 2.17/set in 1992 to4.50/set in 1998.  Length of fish sampled in 1998 ranged from 3.4 to 6.5 inches, with a meanlength of 5.0 inches and a mean weight of 0.11 lbs. The trap net catch for black crappie has appeared to increase from 1.5/set in 1992 to 3.17/set in1998.  Fish sampled in 1998 ranged in length from 5.7 to 9.5 inches, with a mean length of 7.4inches.  Mean weight per fish declined from 0.32 lbs in 1992 to 0.22 lbs in 1998.  Growth wasabove average as fish reached 4.31, 5.98, and 7.35  inches by Age I, II, and III, and belowaverage for Age V and VII fish as individuals reached  8.86 and 11.28 inches, respectively.</p>",
