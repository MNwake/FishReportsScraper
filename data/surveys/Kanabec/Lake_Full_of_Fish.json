                "narrative": "<p>Full of fish lake is small (78 acre), relatively shallow (28 foot max.) with a fluctuating water level (plus or minus 3 feet).  It has experienced periodic severe winterkills, most recently in 1995-96.  Minnow species, brown bullheads, and yellow bullheads were the only fish taken in this survey.  Bullhead numbers were very low.  Because access is only over privately owned land, the lake is not eligible for DNR stocking.  The lake , however, may have some potential as a walleye rearing pond in years following a severe winterkill.  If it was used to rear walleyes, it would be stocked with walleye fry in the spring, which would be harvested as fingerlings in the fall.  Because many fingerlings escape harvest, and these fish eat or compete with subsequently stocked fry, the lake would only be stocked following a confirmed severe winterkill.The one previous (1960) survey showed northerns, pumpkinseeds, yellow perch, and largemouth bass present.  Northerns were 18 - 22.9 inches, and pumpkinseeds averaged about 4.5 - 4.9 inches.  The 1960 survey notes that crappie fishing was excellent about 10 - 12 years previously.  Like other lakes that experience severe winterkills, but are also restocked by intermittent connections to other water bodies, or by human intervention, Full of Fish Lake may periodically produce good to excellent fishing for one or more species.  Different species may become dominant after different winterkill events.  Best results probably occur when a single species dominates the system.Prepared by:   Steve Morse</p>",
