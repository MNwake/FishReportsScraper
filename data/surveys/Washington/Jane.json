White sucker, yellow perch, and black crappie are each present in low numbers based on the above.  Northern pike numbers are considered to be high since the catch rate is above the 75th percentile of the range for the local median.  Single specimens of both walleye and sauger were taken.  Since these fish are not a result of any DNR stocking, it is obvious that some local resident is conducting unauthorized stocking, probably fish caught in the St. Croix.  Northern pike aged were from the 1978, 1977, and 1976 year classes in descending order of abundance.  All exhibited good growth rates when compared to statewide averages.  No stocking has been done which would account for these fish.</p>",

This area, except for a small portion of the north shore, is cluttered with stumps of drowned trees, which invaded the lake bed in the dry 1930s.  These stumps provide almost perfect protection from natural predation for the profuse natural reproduction of panfish this lake is able to bring off.  These stumps also curtail the effective use of seines and other fish trapping gear and cause the cessation of \"panfish removal\" after 5,760 sunfish had been removed in 1953.  At present the reduction in the sunfish population is the proper management goal.  The effective promotion of a northern pike population holds the greatest promise of success.</p>",

Northern pike sampled at more than 3 times the local median, but were of small average size.  Growth of NOP was average for the area.  Yellow bullhead, brown bullhead, green sunfish, and pumpkinseed were taken in above average numbers.  Black crappie and yellow perch were taken in below median numbers.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Management efforts on Jane Lake have primarily focused on Largemouth Bass (LMB). An experimental regulation requiring the release of all LMB between 12 and 16 inches total length (TL) was in effect from 1986 to 1993. The regulation was intended to reduce the harvest of LMB and thereby improve the Bluegill (BLG) size structure through predation. Evaluation of that regulation showed no positive response by the BLG population, so the regulation was discontinued. A new experimental regulation was implemented in 1997 requiring the release of all LMB caught. The objective of this regulation was to maintain the numbers of LMB 16.0\" TL and larger at a minimum of 40 percent of the spring electrofishing catch. This catch-and-release only regulation for LMB was made permanent in 2006.  <br> \n <br> \nIn 2007, the gill net catch rate for Northern Pike (NOP) was the highest ever recorded for this lake. The average size of gill net sampled NOP was 17.4 inches and 1.30 pounds. Only 2.5 percent of all NOP captured measured 26.0 inches or longer, with the largest fish captured measuring 38.27 inches. One 18.98 inch Walleye (WAE) was captured during this survey. Largemouth Bass (LMB) were sampled above median levels for abundance in both gill and trap nets. The electrofishing catch rate for LMB was the lowest recorded since 1994. This could be a direct result of low water levels and the displacement of fish from normal areas. The average size LMB captured by electrofishing was 12.2 inches and 1.2 pounds. The proportion of LMB sampled over 12.0 and 16.0 inches was comparable to electrofishing efforts since the year 2000. No Yellow Perch (YEP) were captured during this fisheries survey. Bluegill (BLG) abundance in the trap net sample, while almost half of that observed in 2002, still remains above the median level for lakes of this type. The average size of BLG sampled was 4.9 inches and 0.10 pounds. Only 15.3 percent of sampled BLG measured 7.0 inches or longer with individuals up to 8.19 inches being captured. Black Crappie (BLC) were sampled below median levels for abundance for both gill and trap nets, with the average size of BLC captured measuring 6.85 inches and 0.175 pounds. Approximately one-third of all BLC captured measured 8.0 inches or longer.  <br> \n</p>",

Largemouth Bass is the primary management species. A catch and release regulation for Largemouth has been in place since 1997. No stocking of fish has occurred in recent history. The lake was surveyed with trap nets, gill nets, and electrofishing in June 2019. The previous survey was conducted in 2013. <br> \n  <br> \nLargemouth Bass were sampled by nighttime electrofishing at a rate of 68.3 fish per hour. This is higher than the two previous surveys which had just over 40 fish per hour but it is far less than surveys from 2004 and earlier. Mean weight of 1.2 lb was typical relative to previous surveys. All sizes of fish between 6 and 19 inches were well represented. The average length sampled was 12.4 inches. During all previous surveys, electrofishing was conducted during the daytime, which may have influenced differences in catch. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike were sampled at a rate of 11.8 fish per gill net. Although this is the lowest catch in the last several surveys, it is still considerably higher than the lake class average. A mean weight of 1.4 lb is low for the lake class and is typical relative to previous surveys. The majority of Pike ranged from 13 to 24 inches in length. The average length was 18.2 inches and the largest individual measured 29.9 inches.  <br> \n  <br> \nTrap nets sampled Bluegills at a rate of 7.7 fish per net which is lower than any previous survey. Recent surveys have sampled Bluegills at a rate 5 to 10 times higher. Mean weight of 0.11 lb is also low, below the typical range for the lake class but is typical for the lake. The average Bluegill length was 5 inches and the largest fish sampled was 7.7 inches long.  <br> \nBlack Crappies were sampled at low rates in both gill nets (1.2 fish per net) and trap nets (0.9 fish per net). Mean weight for both gears was high relative to similar lakes. Most fish sampled measured between 7 and 10 inches in length with an average of 8.6 inches in gill nets. The largest Crappie sampled was something of an outlier at 13 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled included: Black Bullhead, Brown Bullhead, Green Sunfish, Hybrid Sunfish, Pumpkinseed, and Yellow Bullhead. <br> \n</p>",

The bluegill PSD remained about the same as 1988 and the catch rate went up only slightly.  The largemouth bass sampled by electrofishing showed slow to average growth.  Northern pike showed slightly slower than normal growth for the metro area.  Almost 20 times the local median of hybrid sunfish were captured.  Yellow bullhead, brown bullhead, green sunfish, and pumpkinseed were sampled at above local median levels.  Golden shiner, black bullhead, and black crappie were sampled at below local median rates.</p>",

Their average size was 6.6 inches with some fish over 8 inches. Hybrid sunfish, although low in abundance, are large. The average size sampled was over 7 inches. Black crappies were captured in low numbers, with less than 5% exceeding 10 inches.Northern pike were abundant. The gill net catch was the third highest for this lake. Most of the northern pike were small but some fish exceeded 30 inches. The largest was 38.23 inches long. Largemouth bass were also relatively abundant. Largemouth bass up to 15.59 inches were caught. Bullheads are present but in lower abundance than in previous years. Yellow perch, white suckers, and green sunfish are also present.  </p>",

Bluegills were very abundant and the PSD was 5.6, a sloght improvement over the 1990 size distribution for bluegill, and the highest for the special regulation sampling period.  Bluegill growth was slow, which is to be expected with very high abundance.  Largemouth bass and golden shiner were also sampled.  Bass reproduction was determined by shoreline seining.  Several size classes of largemouth bass were sampled, but growth was below the average for the area.  Northern pike growth was average.</p>",

Largemouth bass are present in a variety of sizes and ages, with good numbers of larger fish available to anglers.  Northern pike numbers are lower than in previous years, and their reduced predation on yellow perch has caused numbers to increase.  Brown and yellow bullheads are present in good numbers, with a number of fish weighing over a pound.  White sucker, black crappie, pumpkinseed and green sunfish are all present in low numbers.</p>",

The bluegill number per set was 176.29 compared to 40.3 in 1986.  The greatest number of bluegills were in the 4.5-4.9 inch group and only 3 fish were six inches or greater bringing the PSD down to 1% (5.2% in 1986).  Yellow bullhead, green sunfish, and black crappie were below the state and local medians.  Black crappie numbers have historically been below the medians.  One largemouth bass was sampled in a trap net, however, 24 bass were captured electrofishing.  1987 PSD value is 33.3% vs. 38.5% in 1986.</p>",

An experimental regulation scheduled to end on March 1, 2006 requires the release of all largemouth bass caught.This survey used gillnets, trapnets, and seining.  No electrofishing was done, so largemouth bass data collected here may not be representative of the population.Bluegill and hybrid sunfish were abundant, with some fish over 7 inches long.  The larger bluegills aged were slow growing and up to 12 years old.  Pumpkinseed sunfish were present in average numbers.  None were 7 inches long.  Black crappie were captured in low numbers with a tenth of the fish over 10 inches long.Northern pike were abundant, captured at near historic high levels.  Most fish were small, with a few over 25 inches long.  All fish were age 5 or younger.  Largemouth bass were moderately abundant in the nets, with fish up to 17 inches long present.  One walleye was captured, only the second walleye ever captured in the lake.Black and yellow bullhead were present in average numbers, with most fish between 10 and 12 inches long.  A few green sunfish, brown bullhead, and yellow perch were captured.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Management efforts on Jane Lake have primarily focused on Largemouth Bass (LMB). An experimental regulation requiring the release of all LMB between 12 and 16 inches total length (TL) was in effect from 1986 to 1993.  The regulation was intended to reduce the harvest of LMB and thereby improve the Bluegill (BLG) size structure through predation.  Evaluation of that regulation showed no positive response by the BLG population, so the regulation was discontinued. A new experimental regulation was implemented in 1997 requiring the release of all LMB caught.  The objective of this regulation was to maintain the numbers of LMB 16.0\" TL and larger at a minimum of 30 percent of the spring electrofishing catch.  This catch-and-release only regulation for LMB was made permanent in 2006. <br> \n <br> \nIn 2013, the gill net catch rate for Northern Pike (NOP) decreased from 24.67 fish/set in 2007 to 19.25 fish/set.  The average size of gill net sampled NOP was 18.87 inches and 1.63 pounds.  Only 7.69 percent of all NOP captured in both gill and trap nets measured 26.0 inches or longer, with the largest fish captured measuring 35.28 inches.  The electrofishing catch rate for Largemouth Bass (LMB) increased from the 2007 assessment.  The average size LMB captured by electrofishing was 12.37 inches and 1.20 pounds.  The proportion of LMB sampled over 16.0 inches increased from 5.6 percent in 2007 to 18.5 percent in 2013. Bluegill (BLG) trap net abundance exceeded the median level for trap nets.  The average size of BLG sampled in trap nets was 5.64 inches and 0.12 pounds.  Black Crappies (BLC) were sampled below the median abundance levels for both gill and trap net with an average size of BLC captured measuring 7.36 inches and 0.22 pounds.  <br> \n <br> \n</p>",
