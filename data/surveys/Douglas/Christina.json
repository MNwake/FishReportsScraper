                "narrative": "<p>Lake Christina was chemically rehabilitated with rotenone in the fall of 1987 for waterfowl management purposes. The main fisheries aspect of the project was to maintain a fish community dominated by large predators to controlbiomass of planktivorous fish.  Lake Christina was restocked with walleye and largemouth bass following thereclamation.  The lake was opened to fishing in May 1991 and angling success was reported to be excellent.  TheSection of Wildlife opted to close the lake to angling prior to the 1992 fishing opener based on concerns relativeto waterfowl hazing and physical disturbance of aquatic macrophytes.  Annual population assessments have beencompleted to monitor the development and changes in fish community structure following chemical reclamation. Testnetting indicates that gamefish populations have declined and fish community structure is beginning toresemble pre-treatment conditions.  Low dissolved oxygen concentrations during winter months are likelyresponsible for the shift in community structure towards more tolerant species.  Walleye gillnet catch averaged 1.7 fish/net in 1994.  Catch rates had stabilized at 6.6 fish/net in 1992 and 6.9fish/net in 1993,  after declining steadily from 127.5 fish/net in 1989.  The recent decline in walleye gillnetcatches is likely due to over-winter mortality.  Approximately 300 dead walleye were observed along the easternshore of Lake Christina in March of 1994.  Mean weight of fish captured was 2.3 pounds.  Northern pike were notrestocked following the chemical reclamation, however they have become abundant in recent years.  Gillnet catchesaveraged 16.2 fish/net in 1994.  Mean weight of fish captured was 2.6 pounds.  The largemouth bass population mayhave also experienced significant over-winter mortality.  Daytime, DC electrofishing catches fell from 36.0 stocksize fish per hour in 1993 to 3.2 stock size fish per hour in 1994.  Electrofishing catches averaged 22.9 fishper hour in 1992 and 24.0 fish per hour in 1991.  Bluegill catch rates have significantly decreased since 1991. Trapnet catches averaged 29.0, 9.0, 1.5, and 0.2 fish/net in 1991, 1992, 1993, and 1994, respectively.  Theremaining fish are large and fast growing.  Mean weight of fish captured was 0.5 pounds.  Yellow perch gillnetcatches averaged 21.6 fish/net in 1994.  Catches averaged 28.3, 68.9, and 34.1 fish/net in 1991, 1992, and 1993,respectively.  Mean weight of fish captured was 0.2 pounds in 1994.  Black bullhead gillnet catch rates havedeclined steadily since 1991 when catches averaged 271.0 fish/net.  Catches averaged 60.4, 35.8, and 22.6 fish/netin 1992, 1993, and 1994, respectively.  Trapnet catches have ranged from 10.6 - 19.4 fish/net during the same timeperiod.  The mean weight of fish captured was 0.4 pounds, nearly identical to the past three surveys.   Bigmouthbuffalo catches averaged 0.1 fish/gillnet and 0.4 fish/trapnet in 1994.  Fish ranged from 16.0 to 24.0 inches intotal length.  White sucker, common carp, yellow bullhead, brown bullhead, and pumpkinseed sunfish were alsocaptured in survey nets in 1994.   </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Christina is a large, shallow, eutrophic lake in Douglas and Grant counties.  Historicallyrecognized as an important waterfowl staging area, Lake Christina was in a turbid, algae dominatedstate throughout the late 1970's and 1980's.  Water clarity was poor, aquatic plant abundance waslimited, and waterfowl use was minimal. Lake Christina was chemically rehabilitated with rotenone inthe fall of 1987 for waterfowl management purposes.  There were dramatic increases in water clarity,aquatic plant abundance, and waterfowl use in the years following the reclamation.  Lake Christina wasrestocked with walleye and largemouth bass in order to establish and maintain a fish communitydominated by large predators.  Annual population assessments have been completed to monitor thedevelopment and changes in fish community structure following chemical reclamation.  Recent testnettingindicates that fish populations have reverted back to a community dominated by black bullhead, northernpike, and yellow perch, which is typical of shallow lakes that experience low dissolved oxygenconcentrations during ice cover.  The east basin of the lake was aerated during winter months from 1988through 1993 to prevent winterkill.  Aeration was discontinued in 1994 after the fish community wasmostly comprised of species tolerant to low dissolved oxygen.  Following the reclamation, Lake Christina was opened to fishing in May 1991 and angling success wasreported to be excellent.  The Section of Wildlife opted to close the lake to open water angling priorto the 1992 fishing opener based on concerns relative to waterfowl hazing and physical disturbance ofaquatic macrophytes.  Presently the lake is open to winter fishing only from December 1 through March31.  Northern pike are abundant and provide most of the fishing opportunities.  Average size of thefish is about 2.0 pounds.  Yellow perch may also provide some angling opportunities.  Abundance ismoderate, however 17% of the fish captured were 10 inches in length or greater.    </p>",

A complete survey was conducted in August. The surviving black bullhead population has expanded exponentially. Catch rates have increased to 84.0 fish per gillnet. Growth is very rapid. Length frequency observations indicate the 1988 year class grew 4.0-5.0 inches between annual netting assessments. Because of the reclamation, intraspecific competition was decreased allowing the remaining bullheads to recruit to large sizes. These larger fish may be more vulnerable to the nets.</p>",

This switch may have been a result of the extremely mild weather in the spring of 1987. Northern pike numbers are similar to the 1986 survey, but are below the 1982 and 1985 survey. This is probably the result of the promiscuous fishing from 1985-1987. The growth rate of northern pike is very good, especially among the age one fish. Recruitment into the population is excellent. Gillnet indices for yellow perch were very high 85.0/net set. Age one largemouth bass also sampled. Lake christina was reclaimed in November 1987.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Christina is a large, shallow, eutrophic lake in Douglas and Grant counties.  Historically recognized as an important waterfowl staging area, Lake Christina was in a turbid, algae dominated state throughout the late 1970's and 1980's.  Water clarity was poor, aquatic plant abundance was limited, and waterfowl use was minimal. Lake Christina was chemically rehabilitated with rotenone in the fall of 1987 for waterfowl management purposes.  There were dramatic increases in water clarity, aquatic plant abundance, and waterfowl use in the years following the reclamation.  Lake Christina was restocked with walleye and largemouth bass in order to establish and maintain a fish community dominated by large predators.  Annual population assessments have been completed to monitor the development and changes in fish community structure following chemical reclamation.  Recent testnetting indicates that fish populations have reverted back to a community dominated by black bullhead, northern pike, and yellow perch, which is typical of shallow lakes that experience low dissolved oxygen concentrations during ice cover.  The east basin of the lake was aerated during winter months from 1988 through 1993 to prevent winterkill.  Aeration was discontinued in 1994 after the fish community was mostly comprised of species tolerant to low dissolved oxygen.  Following the reclamation, Lake Christina was opened to fishing in May 1991 and angling success was reported to be excellent.  The Section of Wildlife opted to close the lake to open water angling prior to the 1992 fishing opener based on concerns  relative to waterfowl hazing and physical disturbance of aquatic macrophytes.  Presently the lake is open to winter fishing only from December 1 through March 31.  Northern pike are abundant and provide most of the fishing opportunities.  Average size of the fish is about 2.0 pounds.  Yellow perch may also provide some angling opportunities.  Abundance is moderate, however 30% of the fish captured were 10 inches in length or greater.    </p>",

In 1985 gillnets had a mean catch of 12.50 northern pike weighing 31.02 pounds. The 1986 gillnets had a mean catch of 6.00 northern pike weighing 12.37 pounds. The 1986 gillnet catch of northern pike in trapnets dropped from 239 northern pike weighing 616.2 pounds in 1985 to 49 northern pike weighing 94.4 pounds in 1986. Length frequencies of northern pike in 1985 and 1986 would suggest the larger northern pike disappeared. This may be the result of promiscuous fishing or it could be the result of low oxygen levels during the winter.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Christina is a large, shallow, eutrophic lake in Douglas and Grant counties.  Historically recognized as an important waterfowl staging area, Lake Christina was in a turbid, algae dominated state throughout the late 1970's and 1980's.  Water clarity was poor, aquatic plant abundance was limited, and waterfowl use was minimal. Lake Christina was chemically rehabilitated with rotenone in the fall of 1987 for waterfowl management purposes.  There were dramatic increases in water clarity, aquatic plant abundance, and waterfowl use in the years following the reclamation.  Lake Christina was restocked with walleye and largemouth bass in order to establish and maintain a fish community dominated by large predators.  Annual population assessments have been completed to monitor the development and changes in fish community structure following chemical reclamation.  Fish populations have reverted back to a community dominated by black bullhead, northern pike, and yellow perch, which is typical of shallow lakes that experience low dissolved oxygen concentrations during ice cover.  Water clarity and aquatic plant abundance has also returned to pre-reclamation conditions.      Following the reclamation, Lake Christina was opened to fishing in May 1991 and angling success was reported to be excellent.  The Section of Wildlife opted to close the lake to open water angling prior to the 1992 fishing opener based on concerns relative to waterfowl hazing and physical disturbance of aquatic macrophytes.  Presently the lake is open to winter fishing only from December 1 through March 31.  Northern pike provide most of the fishing opportunities.  Average size of the fish is about 2.0 pounds.       </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Christina was chemically rehabilitated with rotenone in the fall of 1987 for waterfowl managementpurposes.  The main fisheries aspect of the project was to maintain a fish community dominated by largepredators to control biomass of planktivorous fish.  Lake Christina was restocked with walleye andlargemouth bass following the reclamation.  The lake was opened to fishing in May 1991 and anglingsuccess was reported to be excellent.  The Section of Wildlife opted to close the lake to angling priorto the 1992 fishing opener based on concerns relative to waterfowl hazing and physical disturbance ofaquatic macrophytes.  Annual population assessments have been completed to monitor the development andchanges in fish community structure following chemical reclamation.  Recent testnetting indicates thatgamefish populations have stabilized at levels that are consistent with the limitations of the lake'senvironment.  Catches of undesirable non-game species have increased since 1995.  Low dissolved oxygenconcentrations during winter months are likely responsible for the shift in community structure towardsmore tolerant species.  Walleye gillnet catches averaged 2.9 fish/net in 1996.  Gillnet catches averaged 1.7 and 1.9 fish/netin 1994 and 1995, respectively.  Mean weight of fish captured in 1996 was 2.4 pounds.  The age classdistribution of walleye indicates that natural reproduction is occurring in Lake Christina.  Walleyehave not been stocked since 1992.  Northern pike were not restocked following the chemical reclamation,however they have become the primary predator in the lake.  Gillnet catches averaged 10.8 fish/net in1996.  Gillnet catches averaged 10.4, 16.2, and 10.9 fish/net in 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively. Mean weight of fish captured in 1996 was 2.1 pounds.  The bluegill population is characterized by alimited number of large individuals.  Trapnet catches averaged 1.9 fish/net.  Catches averaged 1.8,0.2, and 1.5 fish/trapnet in 1995, 1994, and 1993.  Mean weight of fish captured was 0.5 pounds. Yellow perch gillnet catches averaged 9.9 fish/net.  Gillnet catches averaged 18.6, 21.6, and 34.1 in1995, 1994, and 1993, respectively.  Mean weight of fish captured was 0.3 pounds in 1996.  Blackbullhead gillnet catches increased from 20.6 fish/net in 1995 to 102.6 fish/net in 1996.  Trapnetcatches increased from 6.8 to 50.4 fish/net.  The inflated catch rates were due to an increase in 5.0to 7.0 inch fish.   Mean weight of fish captured was 0.2 pounds, compared to 0.4 pounds in the pastfour surveys.  Bigmouth buffalo catches increased from 0.6 fish/gillnet in 1995 to 1.9 fish/gillnet in1996.  Fish ranged from 6.5 - 14.1 inches in total length.  Mean weight of fish captured was 1.1pounds.  Common carp catches increased from 0.2 fish/trapnet in 1995 to 3.5 fish/trapnet in 1996.  Mostof the fish captured were between 18.0 and 21.0 inches in total length.  White sucker, yellow bullhead,brown bullhead, largemouth bass and pumpkinseed sunfish were also captured in survey nets in 1996.   </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Christina was chemically rehabilitated with rotenone in the fall of 1987 for waterfowl managementpurposes.  The main fisheries aspect of the project was to maintain a fish community dominated by largepredators to control biomass of planktivorous fish.  Lake Christina was restocked with walleye andlargemouth bass following the reclamation.  The lake was opened to fishing in May 1991 and anglingsuccess was reported to be excellent.  The Section of Wildlife opted to close the lake to angling priorto the 1992 fishing opener based on concerns relative to waterfowl hazing and physical disturbance ofaquatic macrophytes.  Annual population assessments have been completed to monitor the development andchanges in fish community structure following chemical reclamation.  Recent testnetting indicates thatgamefish populations have stabilized at levels that are consistent with the limitations of the lake'senvironment.  Low dissolved oxygen concentrations during winter months are likely responsible for theshift in community structure towards more tolerant species.  Dead fish were prevalent along theshoreline of the eastern basin following ice-out in 1997.  Northern pike were not restocked following the chemical reclamation, however they have become theprimary predator in the lake.  Gillnet catches averaged 17.1 fish/net in 1997.  Gillnet catches haveranged from 10.4 to 16.2 fish/net in surveys dating back to 1993.  Mean weight of fish captured in 1996was 2.4 pounds.  Yellow perch gillnet catches averaged 8.8 fish/net.  Gillnet catches averaged 9.9,18.6, 21.6, and 34.1 in 1996, 1995, 1994, and 1993, respectively.  Mean weight of fish captured was 0.3pounds in 1997.  Black bullhead gillnet catches averaged 80.8 fish/net in 1997 compared to 102.6fish/net in 1996.  Gillnet catches averaged 20.5, 22.6, and 35.8 fish/net in 1995, 1994, and 1993,respectively.   Mean weight of fish captured was 0.2 pounds.  Brown bullhead catches decreased from49.0 fish/gillnet in 1996 to 1.0 fish/gillnet in 1997.  Mean weight of fish captured was 0.3 pounds.Walleye were not captured in gillnets.  Gillnet catches averaged 2.9, 1.9, and 1.7 fish/net in 1996,1995, and 1994, respectively.  One walleye measuring 20.7 inches in total length was captured in atrapnet.  Bluegill catches were also limited to one fish.  Trapnet catches ranged from 0.2 to 1.9fish/net in surveys dating back to 1993.  Common carp trapnet catches decreased from 3.5 fish/net in1996 to 0.3 fish/net in 1997.  The majority of the dead fish observed along the shoreline after ice-outin 1997 were common carp.  Bigmouth buffalo, white sucker, and pumpkinseed sunfish were also capturedin survey nets in 1997.   </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Christina was chemically rehabilitated with rotenone in the fall of 1987 for waterfowl management purposes. The main fisheries aspect of the project was to maintain a fish community dominated by large predators to controlbiomass of planktivorous fish.  Lake Christina was restocked with walleye and largemouth bass following thereclamation.  The lake was opened to fishing in May 1991 and angling success was reported to be excellent.  TheSection of Wildlife opted to close the lake to angling prior to the 1992 fishing opener based on concerns relativeto waterfowl hazing and physical disturbance of aquatic macrophytes.  Annual population assessments have beencompleted to monitor the development and changes in fish community structure following chemical reclamation. Recent testnetting indicates that gamefish populations have stabilized at levels that are consistent with thelimitations of the lake's environment.  Low dissolved oxygen concentrations during winter months are likelyresponsible for the shift in community structure towards more tolerant species.  Walleye gillnet catches averaged 1.9 fish/net in 1995.  Gillnet catches averaged 1.7 fish/net in 1994.  Meanweight of fish captured in 1995 was 2.3 pounds.  The age class structure of walleye indicates that naturalreproduction has occurred in Lake Christina.  Cohorts of the 1993 year class (age-2 fish) comprised 41% of thefish captured in gillnets.  Walleye have not been stocked since 1992.    Northern pike were not restockedfollowing the chemical reclamation, however they have become the primary predator in the lake.  Gillnet catchesaveraged 10.4 fish/net in 1995.  Gillnet catches averaged 16.2 fish/net in 1994 and 10.9 fish/net in 1993.  Meanweight of fish captured in 1995 was 3.4 pounds.  The bluegill population is characterized by a limited number oflarge individuals.  Trapnet catches averaged 1.8 fish/net in 1995.  Catches averaged 0.2 and 1.5 fish/trapnet in1994 and 1993.  Mean weight of fish captured was 0.5 pounds.  Largemouth bass were not sampled with electrofishingbecause of time constraints.  It is likely that largemouth bass abundance is limited.  Daytime, DC electrofishingcatches fell from 36.0 stock-size fish per hour in 1993 to 3.2 fish per hour in 1994.  Yellow perch gillnetcatches averaged 18.6 fish/net in 1995.  Gillnet catches averaged 21.6, 34.1, and 68.9 fish/net in 1994, 1993,and 1992, respectively.  Mean weight of fish captured was 0.2 pounds in 1995.  Black bullhead gillnet catchesaveraged 20.6 fish/net in 1995; nearly identical to the catch rate of 22.6 fish/net in 1994.  The mean weight offish captured was 0.4 pounds.  Mean weight of black bullhead has not changed in the past four surveys.  Bigmouthbuffalo catches averaged 0.6 fish/gillnet and 0.6 fish/trapnet in 1995. Three size classes were represented inthe catch including fish ranging from 4.0 - 8.0 inches in total length.  White sucker, golden shiner, common carp,yellow bullhead, brown bullhead, and pumpkinseed sunfish were also captured in survey nets in 1995.   </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Christina is a large, shallow basin located near the town of Ashby in west-central Minnesota.  The lake is nationally recognized as a critical staging area for migrating waterfowl, especially canvasbacks.  The lake is known to alternate between a clear water state in which aquatic macrophytes are dominant and a turbid phase characterized by poor water clarity and high phytoplankton density.  Rotenone was used in 1987 and 2003 to reduce the existing fish community and induce a shift from the turbid state to a clear water state.  Comprehensive monitoring of the lake ecosystem has followed each chemical treatment.  The DNR Section of Fisheries teamed with researchers from the University of St. Thomas to monitor the fish community in 2004.Lake Christina is designated as a Wildlife Management Lake and is managed for migratory waterfowl.  The current management strategy is to minimize the total fish biomass in the lake to optimize water clarity and aquatic plant abundance.  Fish were not re-stocked following the chemical treatment in 2004.  The lake is closed to fishing.     </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Christina was chemically rehabilitated with rotenone in the fall of 1987 for waterfowl management purposes. The main fisheries aspect of the project was to maintain a fish community dominated by large predators to controlbiomass of planktivorous fish.  Lake Christina was restocked with walleye and largemouth bass following chemicalreclamation.  The lake was opened to fishing in May 1991 and angling success was reported to be excellent.  TheSection of Wildlife opted to close the lake to angling prior to the 1992 fishing opener based on concerns relativeto waterfowl hazing and physical disturbance of aquatic macrophytes.  Annual population assessments have beencompleted to monitor the development and changes in fish community structure following chemical reclamation. Testnetting indicates that gamefish populations have declined and fish community structure is beginning toresemble pre-treatment conditions.  Low dissolved oxygen concentrations during winter months are likelyresponsible for the shift in community structure towards more tolerant species.  Walleye gillnet catches averaged 6.9 fish/net in 1993.  Catch rates seem to have stabilized after declining from127.5 fish/net in 1989 to 6.6 fish/net in 1992.  The present catch rate is more typical for this lake type.   Mean weight of fish captured was 2.4 pounds.  Northern pike gillnet catches averaged 10.9 fish/net.  Catchesaveraged 6.4 fish/net in 1992 and 16.0 fish/net in 1991.  Northern pike were not restocked following reclamation. Success of northern pike can be attributed to their tolerance to low dissolved oxygen concentrations.  Mean weightof fish captured was 2.7 pounds.  The largemouth bass population appears to be expanding.  Electrofishing yielded36.0 fish per hour in 1993.  Electrofishing catches averaged 22.9 fish per hour in 1992 and 24.0 fish per hourin 1991.  Mean weight of fish captured was 1.0 pounds.  Bluegill catch rates have significantly decreased since1991.  Trapnet catches averaged 29.0, 9.0, and 1.5 fish/net in 1991, 1992, and 1993, respectively.  The remainingfish are large and fast growing.  Mean weight of fish captured was 0.4 pounds.  Approximately 90% of the fish are6 inches in length or greater and 28% exceed 8 inches in length. Yellow perch gillnet catches averaged 34.1fish/net in 1993.  Catches averaged 68.9 fish/net in 1992 and 28.3 fish/net in 1991.  Mean weight of fish capturedwas 0.2 pounds in 1993.  Black bullhead gillnet catch rates have declined since 1991 when catches averaged 271.0fish/net.  Catches averaged 60.4 fish/net in 1992 and 35.8 fish/net in 1993.  Trapnet catches have been similarduring the same time period, ranging from 14.0 - 19.4 fish/net.  The mean weight of fish captured was 0.4 pounds;nearly identical to the past two surveys.   White sucker, yellow bullhead, brown bullhead, pumpkinseed sunfish,and hybrid sunfish were captured in survey nets in 1993.  Bigmouth buffalo were observed during electrofishing,however they were not captured in survey nets.  Bigmouth buffalo were first captured in 1992. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Walleye abundance continues to decline.  Gillnet catches averaged 6.6 fish/net as compared to previous catch rates of 127.5 Walleye/gillnet in 1988 (post reclamation), 58.0 Walleye/gillnet in 1989, 21.7 Walleye/gillnet in 1990, and 10.0 Walleye/gillnet in 1991.  The decline may be attributable to several factors including harvest during the 1991 fishing season.  The population may have stabilized from the initial and current densities may more accurately reflect a Walleye population at or near normal carrying capacity.  The lower catch rates recorded in the western basin, which was sampled with fewer nets in 1991, may also explain the decline in Catch Rates from 1991 to 1992.  PSD  values increased from 29% in 1990 to 88% in 1992.  Mean weight of Walleye captured in gillnets increased from 1.3 pounds in 1991 to 1.80 pounds in 1992.  An overall decline in physical condition of Walleye was observed with Wr Q-P declining from 110.1 in 1991 to 95.8 in 1992. Northern Pike catch rates declined from 16.0 fish/gillnet in 1991 to 6.4 fish/gillnet in 1992.  Catch Rates in the 1992 survey approximates the third quartile of 6.0 fish/gillnet for lakes with similar physical and chemical dimensions.  PSD increased from 28% in 1991 to 52% in 1992; however, the relative percentage of 28.0 inch and larger fish decreased. RSD-P-M values dropped from 10% in 1991 to 0% in 1992.  Harvest during the 1991 fishing season may explain the decrease in catch rates as well as the shift in size structure.  The mean weight of fish captured in gillnets was 2.12 pounds.  Daytime electrofishing produced 22.9 stock-length Largemouth Bass per hour.  This catch rate which is consistent with previous survey results.  PSD values increased from 50% in 1991 to 81% in 1992.  Bluegill catch rates declined from 29.0 fish/trapnet in 1991 to 8.95 fish/trapnet in 1992.  PSD values increased from 38% in to 46% in 1992.  The relative percentage of 8.0 inch and larger fish fell from 7% in the previous survey to less than 1% in 1992.  This may be resultant from size selective harvest or over winter mortality.  Yellow Perch catch rate was 68.9 fish/gillnet. This exceeds the third quartile of 24.55 for lakes with similar chemical and physical dimensions. The mean weight of fish captured was 0.24 pounds and PSD was calculated at 43%.  Black Bullhead catch rates averaged 60.4 fish/gillnet in 1992, which was a substantial decline from 1991 values of 271, fish/gillnet.  The mean weight of Black Bullhead was 0.46 pounds.  The great variability in catch rates values is difficult to explain.  More gillnets in the western basin may explain some of the decline in mean catch rates. Three new species were captured which include Golden Shiner, Bigmouth Buffalo and Brown Bullhead.  Six Bigmouth Buffalo were observed or netted during the spring electrofishing survey.  One individual was captured in the trapnets.  This fish was a cohort of the 1986 year class which predates reclamation.  They may have migrated upstream from Pelican Lake during the installation of the new electric weir at the outlet of Lake Christina or moved downstream from Lake Ina.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Christina is a large, shallow, eutrophic lake in Douglas and Grant counties.  Historically recognized as an important waterfowl staging area, Lake Christina was in a turbid, algae dominated state throughout the late 1970's and 1980's.  Water clarity was poor, aquatic plant abundance was limited, and waterfowl use was minimal. Lake Christina was chemically rehabilitated with rotenone in the fall of 1987 for waterfowl management purposes.  There were dramatic increases in water clarity, aquatic plant abundance, and waterfowl use in the years following the reclamation.  Lake Christina was restocked with walleye and largemouth bass in order to establish and maintain a fish community dominated by large predators.  Annual population assessments have been completed to monitor the development and changes in fish community structure following chemical reclamation.  Recent testnetting indicates that fish populations have reverted back to a community dominated by black bullhead, northern pike, and yellow perch, which is typical of shallow lakes that experience low dissolved oxygen concentrations during ice cover.  The east basin of the lake was aerated during winter months from 1988 through 1993 to prevent winterkill.  Aeration was discontinued in 1994 after the fish community was mostly comprised of species tolerant to low dissolved oxygen.  Following the reclamation, Lake Christina was opened to fishing in May 1991 and angling success was reported to be excellent.  The Section of Wildlife opted to close the lake to open water angling prior to the 1992 fishing opener based on concerns relative to waterfowl hazing and physical disturbance of aquatic macrophytes.  Presently the lake is open to winter fishing only from December 1 through March 31.  Northern pike are abundant and provide most of the fishing opportunities.  Average size of the fish is about 2.0 pounds.  Yellow perch may also provide some angling opportunities.  Abundance is moderate, however 14% of the fish captured were 10 inches in length or greater.    </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Christina is a large, shallow basin located near the town of Ashby in west-central Minnesota.  The lake is nationally recognized as a critical staging area for migrating waterfowl, especially canvasbacks.  The lake is known to alternate between a clear water state in which aquatic macrophytes are dominant and a turbid phase characterized by poor water clarity and high phytoplankton density.  Rotenone was used in 1987 and 2003 to reduce the existing fish community and induce a shift from the turbid state to a clear water state.  Comprehensive monitoring of the lake ecosystem has followed each chemical treatment.  The DNR Section of Fisheries teamed with researchers from the University of St. Thomas to monitor the fish community in 2005Lake Christina is designated as a Wildlife Management Lake and is managed for migratory waterfowl.  The lake is following the same trend as the last time it was treated with rotenone.  Water clarity improved dramatically in 2005 and submergent vegetation was lush and abundant.  Management efforts will continue to be directed towards minimizing the abundance of fish present in Lake Christina.  The lake is closed to fishing.   </p>",
