                "narrative": "<p>This early spring gillnet assessment for stream trout consisted of one standard survey gillnet set at depths from 6' to 24'.  A standard smelt gillnet was also set and is reported separately.As in past assessments, this assessment found Hanson Lake to be clear (Secchi = 16'), infertile (total alkalinity = 2 ppm), and to have excellent water quality (5 ppm oxygen to a depth of 37').  In comparison to other Ely Area stream trout lakes, Hanson Lake is deeper and less fertile.The gillnet captured nine splake ranging in size from 8\" to 20\".  The total weight of these splake (12.3 lb per gillnet) is average for stream trout lakes in the Ely Management Area.  The smaller splake had insects in their stomachs.  The larger splake had empty stomachs, in contrast to the 1992 assessment where larger splake had smelt in their stomachs.  Smaller splake were eating insects in both assessments. SMELT NETS:This assessment consisted of one standard smelt net.  It was set in conjunction with an early spring stream trout gillnet assessment.  Smelt were first observed in Hanson Lake in 1983.  They were probably upstream migrants from adjacent Burntside Lake, where they were introduced about 1970.  Since the outlet stream from Hanson Lake to Burntside Lake contains drops and a bog, all of which might hinder fish movement, it is possible that the smelt in Hanson Lake did not migrate naturally, but were stocked intentionally.The number of smelt captured in this assessment (45) is the lowest in six assessments since smelt were introduced.  Most of the smelt were captured in the smaller 3/8\" bar mesh, a dramatic decline from recent assessments where most smelt were caught in the larger 1/2\" mesh.  This is an indication that smelt are smaller, as well as less numerous.  In addition to smelt, four small splake were captured.  They had been stocked as fingerlings the previous fall.The decline in the smelt population is probably due to predation by splake.  Annual splake stocking began in 1988 in the hope that they would eat the smelt, as splake are known to forage on fish.  Smelt were observed in the stomachs of larger splake in the 1992 assessment, however the stomachs of three large splake (18-20\") in the 1995 assessment were empty.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Hanson Lake is a 19 acre designated trout lake located within the Superior National Forest. The lake is quite picturesque with very clear water and towering pines surrounding the shoreline. The lake is completely undeveloped and has a nice shore fishing/camping area near the access. It is accessible by a 100 yard portage from a parking area off USFS Rd 450. \n\nHanson Lake has a maximum depth of 65 feet with fairly steep drop-offs along most of its shore. The only inlet is from a small bog drainage.  The outlet to Burntside Lake flows through a large bog with fish passage being unlikely.  Lake bottom substrates along the shoreline are mostly sand and boulder with some ledge rock and muck.  Aquatic plants are sparse and grow to a depth of 15 feet.  \n\nIn 1963 Hanson Lake was poisoned to remove a population of largemouth bass and minnows, and in 1965 was stocked solely with rainbow trout.  Rainbow trout were stocked annually until the discovery of rainbow smelt in 1983.  After smelt were discovered the stocking regime was switched to brook trout and splake, both are species which are more likely to prey upon smelt.  Since 1989 to the present, splake have been the only species stocked.  \n\nThe catch of splake by weight in this assessment was 13.7 lbs/gill net.  This catch rate was better than 70% of the other stream trout lakes in the Tower Fisheries Management Area.  Note that trout abundance is expressed in terms of pounds per net rather than number per net to reduce the influence of occasional high catches of just-stocked fingerlings.\n\nTwenty-one splake were captured and ranged in size from 9 to 26 inches with an average of 14 inches.  Seven of the twenty-one (33%) fish captured were over 15 inches long.  When compared to the historic splake catch of the lake, the average size is better and the largest splake recorded for the lake was the 26 inch fish sampled in this assessment.\n\nEighty-four rainbow smelt were caught in one small mesh gillnet set.  This catch rate is lower than the average catch since 1983.  Although the population does bounce around a fair amount, overall it seems to be trending down both in numbers and size.  Over the past four surveys the maximum size has decreased every assessment (from 9 inches in 1998 to 5 inches in 2014).  \n\nStomach content analyses of eleven splake showed 6 were empty, 3 contained smelt and 2 contained crayfish remains.  \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Hanson Lake is in Ecological Lake Class 4, which consists of 47 lakes in northeast Minnesota that are small, deep, bowl-shaped, and have very clear and soft (unmineralized) water.  Hanson Lake was thermally stratified on 05/21/98 and retained good oxygen for supporting trout (more than 5 ppm) to a depth of 37 ft, where the temperature was 41 F.  The only inlet to Hanson Lake is a small bog drainage.  The outlet to Burntside Lake flows through a large bog, and fish passage is unlikely.  Lake bottom substrates along the shoreline are 45% sand, 35% boulder, 10% muck, and 10% ledgerock.  Aquatic plants are sparse and grow to a depth of 15 ft; the most common plants are water moss and bushy pondweed.Largemouth bass and minnows were the only fish species originally present in Hanson Lake.  They were poisoned in 1963 and annual trout stocking began in 1965.This early spring assessment for stream trout and smelt consisted of one standard gillnet set at depths of 6-24 ft, and one small mesh 6 ft X 200 ft smelt net (100 ft of 0.5\" bar mesh and 100 ft of 0.375\" bar mesh) set in depths of 10-41 ft.  Eleven previous trout assessments have been conducted on Hanson Lake beginning in 1969, each consisting of 1-4 standard gillnet sets.  Smelt netting began with the discovery of smelt in 1983.The standard gillnet in 1998 captured 14 splake ranging in size from 10\" to 20\" and averaging 12.9\".  Twelve of the 14 splake had been stocked the previous spring as yearlings averaging 8.5\" and had grown to an average of 12.1\" in the 12 months since being stocked.  The remaining two splake were 16\" and 20\".  The splake were in good shape; one third had empty stomachs, the remainder had been eating mostly leeches and sticklebacks, although water boatmen and fathead minnows were also present.  The 16\" splake had smelt in its stomach.The total weight of trout in the standard gillnet of 11.4 lb was similar to the catch of 12.3 lb/gillnet in 1995 and 9.6 lb/gillnet in 1992, but was higher than in previous assessments when rainbow trout and brook trout were being stocked.  The 1998 catch was also higher than the median catch of 6.0 lb/gillnet in recent assessments on 24 stream trout lakes in the Ely Fisheries Management Area.Splake have been the only trout species stocked in Hanson Lake in recent years in the hope that their fish-eating nature would allow them to utilize the abundant smelt forage base.  This appears to have worked, as smelt catches have declined in recent years.  Smelt numbers averaged 294/smelt net (range: 151-610) in four assessments from 1983 through 1989.  The smelt catch subsequently declined to 75/net in 1992, 45/net in 1995, and to 22/net in 1998.  Smelt captured in the 0.5\" bar mesh in 1998 averaged 7.4\", while smelt captured in the 0.375\" bar mesh averaged 4.6\".  The largest smelt in 1998 was 9.1\".</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Hanson Lake is in Ecological Lake Class 4, which consists of 47 lakes in northeast Minnesota that are small, deep, bowl-shaped, and have very clear and soft (unmineralized) water. Hanson Lake was thermally stratified on 05/21/2002 and retained good oxygen for trout (more than 5 ppm) to a depth of 37 F, where the temperature was 41 F. The only inlet is a small bog drainage. The outlet to Burntside Lake flows through a large bog, and fish passage is unlikely. Shoal substrates are 45% sand, 35% boulder, 10% muck, and 10% ledgerock. Aquatic plants are sparse and grow to a depth of 15 ft; the most common plants are water moss and bushy pondweed.Largemouth bass and minnows were the only fish species present in 1961. Hanson Lake was poisoned in 1963 and annual trout stocking began in 1965.This early spring assessment for stream trout and smelt consisted of two standard gillnet set in depths of 6-24 ft, and two 6 ft X 200 ft smelt nets (100 ft of 0.5\" bar mesh and 100 ft of 0.375\" bar mesh) set in depths of 10-43 ft. Twelve previous trout assessments have been conducted on Hanson Lake dating back to 1969, each consisting of 1-4 standard gillnet sets. Smelt netting began with the discovery of smelt in this lake in 1983.The standard gillnets in 2002 captured 10.5 splake/net ranging in size from 7\" to 24\" and averaging 12.0\". All but one of the splake were probably from the 2000 year class which had been stocked as fingerlings averaging 32/lb in the fall of 2000 and as yearlings averaging 6/lb in the spring of 2001. The remaining splake was 24.8\" and weighed 5.9 lbs.  Stomachs of 15 splake were examined: four were empty, the rest contained fish remains (including smelt and darters), crayfish, various insects, leeches, or daphnia.The weight of trout in the standard gillnets in 2002 of 8.0 lb/net was higher than the median catch of 3.2 lbs/net (all trout species combined) in all investigations on this lake, was similar to the average catch of 8.9 lbs/net in this lake since exclusive splake stocking began in 1988, and was higher than the median catch of 5.0 lbs/net (all trout species combined) in recent investigations of 25 stream trout lakes in the Tower Fisheries Management Area.Splake have been the only trout species stocked in Hanson Lake in recent years in the hope that their piscivorous nature would allow them to utilize the abundant smelt forage base. When available, splake yearlings were stocked to allow them to feed on smelt immediately, rather than having to grow to a suitable size. Splake stocking appears to have worked, as smelt catches have declined in recent years. Smelt numbers averaged 294/smelt net (range: 151-610) in four assessments from 1983 through 1989. The smelt catch subsequently declined to 75/net in 1992, 45/net in 1995, 22/net in 1998, and 20/net in 2002.   </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Hanson Lake is in Ecological Lake Class 4, which consists of 47 lakes in northeast Minnesota that are small, deep, bowl-shaped, and have very clear and soft (unmineralized) water. <br> \n <br> \nHanson Lake was thermally stratified on 05/30/2006 with a surface temperature of 72 F and a bottom temperature of 40 F.  Adequate oxygen for trout (more than 5 ppm) was retained to a depth of 32 feet, where the temperature was 41 F.  The only inlet is a small bog drainage.  The outlet to Burntside Lake flows through a large bog, and fish passage is unlikely.  Lake bottom substrates along the shoreline are 45% sand, 35% boulder, 10% muck, and 10% ledgerock.  Aquatic plants are sparse and grow to a depth of 15 feet. The most common plants are water moss and bushy pondweed. <br> \n <br> \nHanson Lake was poisoned in 1963 to remove populations of largemouth bass and minnows.  Annual trout stocking began in 1965.  Rainbow trout were stocked for many rears, until smelt were discovered in the lake in 1983.  Management was switched to brook trout, and then to splake, which are most likely to prey on the smelt. <br> \n <br> \nThe 2006 fish population assessment consisted of two standard gillnets targeting trout and set in depths of 6-24 feet, and two 6 feet X 200 feet smelt nets (100 feet of 0.5 inch bar mesh and 100 feet of 0.375 inch bar mesh) targeting smelt and set in depths of 10-43 feet.  Thirteen previous assessments, dating back to 1968, used 1-4 standard gillnets.  Smelt gillnetting began with the discovery of smelt in 1983. <br> \n <br> \nThe standard gillnets caught 4.0 splake/net ranging in size from 9.7 to 23.0 inches and averaging 13.0 inches.  It appears that the seven smallest splake had been stocked the previous spring as yearlings averaging 8 inches and had grown to an average length of 11.5 inches (range: 9.7 to 13.5 inches) when recaptured 12 months later.  The largest splake was about 6 years old.  Three of the splake stomachs were empty, while one contained crayfish, one contained dragonfly nymphs, and the remainder contained fish remains (mostly smelt). <br> \n <br> \nThe trout catch by weight in 2006 of 4.2 lb/gillnet was similar to the median trout catch of 3.4 lb/gillnet in all assessments on this lake, and was identical to the median trout catch of 4.2 lb/gillnet in recent investigations of 25 stream trout lakes in the Tower Fisheries Management Area.  The 2006 catch was lower, however, than the median trout catch in this lake of 9.6 lb/gillnet since management for splake only began in 1989.   <br> \n <br> \nA white sucker was also caught in 2006.  Low numbers of sucker have occasionally been caught in assessments of Hanson Lake since 1977.  A few golden shiner and a creek chub were caught in 2006, the first appearance of these fish species in this lake. <br> \n <br> \nSplake have been the only trout species stocked in recent years in the hope that their piscivorous nature would allow them to forage on the abundant smelt population.  When available, splake yearlings were stocked to allow them to feed on smelt immediately, rather than having to grow to a suitable size. This strategy appeared to be working, as splake populations were high and smelt numbers declined from an average of 294/smelt net in four assessments from 1983 through 1989, but then declined to 75/net in 1992, 45/net in 1995, 22/net in 1998, and 20/net in 2002.  In 2006, however, just as the splake catch declined from previous assessments, the smelt catch increased to 128/smelt net.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Hanson is a 19 acre stream trout lake located 5 miles north of Ely in the Superior National Forest. Access is by a short portage from a parking area off of Hanson Lake Road (USFS Rd 450). This clear lake is surrounded by large pines, and has a sandy shoreline with sparse areas of muck and rock that steeply drops off towards a maximum depth of 65 feet. Several shore fishing sites are present and a user developed camp site exists on the east side of the lake. Splake fingerlings are stocked on an annual basis. <br> \n <br> \nThe 2019 survey consisted of two standard experimental gill nets for trout and two small mesh deep water nets targeting smelt. Splake numbers were 4.5/net, below the long term average of 9/net, with an average length of 13 inches and weight of 1.1 pounds. Trout sizes were consistent with previous assessments. Fish from at least 3 year classes were present and the largest splake sampled was 19.5 inches long. Stomach contents consisted primarily of aquatic insects, but one large splake contained several rainbow smelt.  <br> \n <br> \nRainbow Smelt are not native to Minnesota, and are belived to have entered Hanson from Burntside by the small outlet on the north side of the lake. The introduction of smelt prompted a shift from rainbow trout stocking to splake, which are more likely to feed upon the now abundant forage supply. Smelt numbers have fluctuated quite a bit since their introduction in the early 1980s from a high of 610/net in 1989 to a low of 20/net in 2002, but have shown a continuing trend of reduced population and size structure. Smelt numbers were moderate at 55/net with a low average length of 5.2 inches. <br> \n</p>",
