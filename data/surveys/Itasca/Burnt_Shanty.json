                "narrative": "<p>Burnt Shanty Lake is a 182-acre lake in Itasca County within the Mississippi River watershed.  Burnt Shanty is located 20 miles north of Grand Rapids, MN.  The lake has a maximum depth of 35 ft and 127 littoral acres.  There is a public access on the south shore off Forest Road 3510.  The northern pike gill-net catch was 8.8/net, which was higher most other lakes in lake class 32.  Catch rates in past assessments have varied from 8.6 to 15.7/net.  Size structure was good with fish up to 31 inches sampled.  Growth was similar to the statewide average with fish reaching 26 inches by age 8.  The bluegill trap-net catch was 7.5/net, below the expected range for similar lakes.  Catch rates in past assessments have varied from 5.5 to 28.0/net.  Size structure was poor with no fish larger than 8 inches.  Growth was faster than the lake class average with fish growing to 6 inches by age 6.    The black crappie gill-net catch was 5.5/net, which was higher than the expected range for similar lakes.  Catch rates in past assessments have varied from 4.7 to 9.5/net.  The catch rate in trap nets was 1.3/net, which was within the expected range.  Size structure for fish sampled in gill nets was poor with no fish exceeding 10 inches, although some fish up to 11 inches were sampled in trap nets.  Growth was similar to the statewide average for ages 1 to 5 and below the average for ages 6 to 8.  Fish reach 9 inches by age 8.  Electrofishing was used for the first time to sample largemouth bass.  The catch rate was 30.9/hour, which indicates a moderately abundant population.  Size structure was moderate with a fish up to 19 inches sampled.  Growth was similar to the statewide average with fish growing to 15 inches by age 7.Yellow bullhead catch rate declined to 48.2/net, however it is still much higher than the expected range.   Catch rates in the two most recent assessments have been very high, varying from 92.0 to 98.0/net.  The yellow perch catch rate was 1.2/gill net, which was within the expected range for similar lakes.  Catch rates in past assessments have varied from 0 to 10.2/net.  Size structure was poor with no fish exceeding 7 inches.  Two walleye were sampled in gill nets, which is the first time walleye have been sampled in Burnt Shanty.In order to maintain or improve fish and wildlife populations, water quality and habitat must be protected.  People often associate water quality problems with large-scale agricultural, forestry, urban development or industrial practices in the watershed.  In reality, the impact of land use decisions on one lake lot may be relatively small, yet, the cumulative impact of those decisions on many lake lots can result in a significant decline in water quality and habitat.  For example, removing shoreline and aquatic vegetation, fertilizing lawns, mowing to the waters edge, installing beach sand blankets, failing septic systems and uncontrolled run-off, all contribute excess nutrients and sediment, which degrade water quality and habitat.  Understanding these cumulative impacts and taking steps to avoid or minimize them will help to insure our quality fisheries can be enjoyed by future generations.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Burnt Shanty Lake is a 182-acre lake located 19 miles north of Grand Rapids.  A state owned cement public access is located off Burnt Shanty Lake Rd. (off Spider Lake Rd.) on the south shore with parking for four boats with trailers.  Burnt Shanty Lake has a maximum depth of 33 feet and 70% of the lake is 15 feet or less.  The lake has soft water and low to moderate fertility.  Water transparency was good in 2018 with visibility to 19 feet in mid-summer.  The depth of water at which oxygen levels limit fish presence was 21 ft. in 2018.  Burnt Shanty Lake has no inlets or outlets.  Other lakes with similar habitat in the Grand Rapids area include Owen, Burrows, and Eagle.   <br> \n <br> \nThe 2018 survey was the sixth survey of the fish community since 1971.  This survey was conducted to monitor the fish community for changes in species composition, abundance, size structure and growth.  The gamefish species that are best suited for the lake are Northern Pike, Black Crappie, and Largemouth Bass.  No special regulations are present.  The 2004 management plan indicated Northern Pike and Largemouth Bass were primary management species, while Black Crappie and Bluegill were secondary management species.   <br> \n <br> \nThe Northern Pike population had moderate catch rates, good size distribution, and growth similar to the statewide average.  The gill net catch was the lowest observed in 2018 and has declined each of the past two surveys.  Higher catch rates are undesirable, as they are typically indicative of higher density populations with poor size structure and slow growth.  Lengths ranged from 12 to 38 inches, with an average of 22 inches.  Size structure was favorable, as 53% of pike sampled exceeded 21 inches and 10% exceeded 28 inches.  Pike were aged from 1 to 8 years old.  Growth was similar to the statewide average, resulting in pike taking five years to average 21 inches.  Due to the lake's small size anglers are encouraged to release Northern Pike exceeding 26 inches and harvest up to 10 less than 22 inches.     <br> \n <br> \nThe Largemouth Bass population had average catch rates and size distribution and below average growth.  Bass have been sampled in all surveys and gill-net catch rates have had an increasing trend.  Electrofishing was not conducted in 2018; however, the 2003 catch rate was similar to the average value for all prior Grand Rapids Area electrofishing surveys.  Lengths in 2018 ranged from 5 to 17 inches, with an average of 10.1 inches.  Size structure was average, as 35% of bass sampled exceeded 12 inches and 10% exceeded 15 inches.  Bass were aged from 2 to 9 years old.  Growth was below the statewide average, resulting in Largemouth Bass taking five years to average 12 inches. <br> \n <br> \nThe Black Crappie population had above average catch rates and size distribution, while growth was below average.  Trap net catches were lower than average while gill net catches were higher than the lake average in 2018.  Lengths ranged from 5 to 11 inches, with an average of 8 inches.  Some level of recruitment appears to occur regularly with eight age classes sampled in 2018.  However, typical of most crappie populations, there has been one primary year class sampled in each of the past three surveys.  Crappie were aged from 2 to 10 years old, with age 4 fish most common.  Growth was below average, resulting in crappie taking six years to average 8 inches. <br> \n <br> \nThe Bluegill population had low to moderate catch rates and below average size distribution and growth.  Trap-net catches have remained similar throughout all surveys and are typically less than lakes with similar habitat.  Lengths of fish sampled ranged from 3 to 7 inches, with an average of 5 inches.  Size structure was below average, as 38% of Bluegill sampled exceeded 6 inches, and 0% exceeded 8 inches.  The size quality continues to decline.  Eight inch Bluegills have not been sampled since 1989, while 10 inch fish have not been sampled since 1971.  Bluegill were aged from 3 to 9 years old.  Growth was below the statewide average, resulting in Bluegill taking seven years to average 6 inches.  Anglers are encouraged to release Bluegill exceeding 8 inches to help improve size structure. <br> \n <br> \nThe Yellow Perch population had low catch rates and poor size distribution.  Gill net catch rates have been low and were no different in 2018.  Size structure was below average with only 4 perch over 8 inches sampled.  Ten inch perch were only sampled in 1983, when 3 were sampled.  Age and growth information has never been determined.  Perch may be too small to interest anglers; however, they are an important prey source for gamefish. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled in this survey included Brown Bullhead, Hybrid Sunfish, Pumpkinseed Sunfish, and Yellow Bullhead.   <br> \n <br> \nIn order to maintain or improve fish and wildlife populations, water quality and habitat must be protected.  People often associate water quality problems with large-scale agricultural, forestry, urban development or industrial practices in the watershed.  In reality, the impact of land use decisions on one lake lot may be relatively small, yet the cumulative impact of those decisions on many lake lots can result in a significant decline in water quality and habitat.  For example, removing shoreline and aquatic vegetation, fertilizing lawns, mowing to the water's edge, installing beach sand blankets, failing septic systems and uncontrolled run-off, all contribute excess nutrients and sediment which degrade water quality and habitat.  Understanding these cumulative impacts and taking steps to avoid or minimize them will help to insure our quality fisheries can be enjoyed by future generations. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers and boaters are reminded to help stop the spread of invasive species by removing all aquatic plants from boats, trailers, and equipment.  All drain plugs must be removed and live and bait wells must be drained before leaving the access.  Anglers and boaters are encouraged to power wash and thoroughly dry all equipment prior to use in another water body. <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n</p>",
