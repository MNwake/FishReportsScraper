                "narrative": "<p>Green Lake is 802 acres and is managed for walleye and northern pike.  The walleye population is maintained through biennial fingerling stocking.  Green Lake is in lake class 27.  Lakes assigned to class 27 are typically large, deep lakes with very hard water.  To assess lake management goals and the success of the current stocking plan, Green Lake was surveyed in September of 2007. <br> \n <br> \nThe walleye catch (4.2/gillnet) was normal for the lake class and met the lake management goal, but was down slightly from 2002.  Over the last 30 years the catch rate for walleye has averaged just under 5/gillnet.  Walleye were large compared to other lakes in class 27 and most other Green Lake catches.  Sampled walleyes ranged from 12.6 to 27.5 inches and averaged 2.8 pounds.  Nearly half the sampled walleye exceeded 21 inches in length.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike were also sampled within both the lake class norm and management goals.  The 2007 catch rate (4.7/net) was above the 30 year mean for Green Lake.  Like walleyes, the northerns were large with a 3.2 pound average.   <br> \n <br> \nAt 4.6 per gillnet, yellow perch abundance was down drastically since the high catch in 2002.  Perch were below the lake class norm in both abundance and size.  Only one perch larger than 6.5 inches was present in the netting.  The current decline in the perch population is likely an effect of the increase in northern pike size and abundance.   <br> \n <br> \nAs in 2002, black crappie numbers, 20.6/gillnet, were at record levels.  This catch rate was above the lake class norm and similar to the 2002 sampling.  The average size (0.4 pounds) has improved and is near the 50th percentile for lake class 27.  Crappie ranged in length from 4.7 to 10.7 with a mean and mode of 8.5 inches.  Twenty eight percent of the catch exceeded 9 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nThe bluegill catch (5.8/trapnet) was normal compared to other lakes but lower than the 2002 rate, more similar to 20 year Green Lake average.  Bluegill averaged just 5.2 inches and 0.1 pounds, below the 25th percentile and the 2002 mean of 0.3 pounds.  Only one bluegill in the sample exceeded 7 inches. <br> \n  <br> \nLargemouth bass were sampled by night electrofishing at a rate of 40 per hour, up from 11.7 in 2002.  Bass remained high in quality ranging from 6.5 to 19.7 inches.  Forty three percent of the catch was 13 inches or larger. <br> \n    <br> \nBowfin (dogfish), black, and yellow bullhead were all present in normal abundance.  White sucker abundance was high while pumpkinseed sunfish and common carp were present in low numbers.  Greater redhorse were also sampled.    <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>During the week of September 02, 1997, a population assessment was conducted on Green Lake (lake class 27).  Sampling gear utilized included nine gillnets and eight trapnets.  Night electrofishing for largemouth bass (June 01, 1997) and shoreline seining for young-of-the-year fish (September 09, 1997) were also part of the standard sampling methods.  Green Lake is managed primarily for walleye and northern pike and secondly for largemouth bass, black crappie, and bluegill.According to stocking records, previous stocking that occurred from 1919 to 1977 was composed of such species as sunfish, black crappie, largemouth bass, northern pike, walleye, and sucker with their frequencies being sporadic.  From 1978 to 1993, stocked fish were primarily walleye fingerlings.  Stocking frequency of walleye fingerlings during this time frame was annual with the exception of 1985.  In 1993, the lake management plan was revised to alternate year walleye fingerling stocking as to evaluate natural reproduction during non-stocked years.Green Lake walleye abundance was found to be average while the average size (2.2 lbs.) exceeded the normal range for this type of lake.  Walleye lengths ranged from 11.9 to 28.9 inches with an average length of 20.0 inches.  Of the 41 walleye measured, 78% were 15 inches or greater in length (1.25 lbs. or greater).  The walleye population in Green Lake appears to primarily consist of stocked walleye.  However, the lake may have some natural reproduction potential in the adjoining Rum River and on a scattered gravel areas along the lake shoreline.  Further evaluation will be necessary to determine the contribution of natural reproduction to the walleye fishery.  Walleye in Green Lake showed above average growth at ages 2-7 and normal growth continued thereafter.Northern pike abundance along with average size (2.7 lbs.) was within the normal range when compared to lake similar in type.  The minimum size captured was 16.1 inches, while the maximum size was 29.9 inches (average length = 24.3 inches).  Growth rates of Green Lake northern pike were normal when compared to statewide averages.Largemouth bass numbers appear to be moderately low.  The average weight was 1.9 pounds, while lengths ranged between 7.0 to 18.2 inches with an average length of 13.8 inches.  Bass growth was normal for this type of lake.Black crappie numbers were normal, while their average size (0.1 lbs.) was somewhat small.  Total lengths ranged from 4.1 to 7.7 inches with an average length of 6.4 inches.The bluegill abundance along with average weight (0.1 lbs.) during the 1997 survey was within the normal range for lakes of this type.  When compared to historical bluegill numbers, this survey sampled the highest recorded catch.  Sizes ranged from 3.2 to 7.2 inches in length and the average length was determined to be 5.2 inches.Yellow perch numbers were below normal when compared to similar lakes.  The average weight of perch (0.1 lbs.) captured during this survey was normal.  Lengths of perch were from 3.6 to 7.5 inches and the average length was 6.0 inches.In addition to the above species, eleven other species made up the fish composition in Green Lake (white sucker, green and pumpkinseed sunfish, common carp, black, brown, and yellow bullhead, fathead minnow, Johnny darter, spottail shiner, and golden shiner).  Net catches for white sucker, green sunfish, common carp, and black and yellow bullhead all fell below their respective normal ranges.  Pumpkinseed sunfish were sampled at normal abundance levels while brown bullhead abundance exceeded the normal range for this type of lake.The 1997 shoreline seining found the bluegill and largemouth bass natural reproduction to be quite successful while yellow perch and black crappie showed limited success.Prepared by Audrey Posterick, Fisheries Specialist</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>  Green Lake was surveyed on August 30 through September 4, 1992 utilizing nine gillnets, seven trapnets, and three shoreline seine hauls.  The present fish population of Green Lake was assessed by comparing the resultant net catch, age, and growth data with that of previous surveys and lake class 31 medians.  \n  The northern pike gillnet catch (4.22/set) was a significant increase from the 1987 catch (1.44/ set) and falls between the first and third quartile values of the lake class 31 median indicating a normal abundance of northern pike.  The sampled northern pike ranged in length from 19.1 to 31.9 inches and had a median length group of 23.0 to 23.9 inches.  Their mean weight was 2.81 pounds which is above the third quartile value (2.74 pounds) for the lake class.  Back-calculated age and growth data from scale samples indicated that captured northern pike ranged from two to five years of age with the 1989 year class representing 50% of the sample.  Growth was normal based on the statewide growth rate of northern pike.  \n  The walleye gillnet catch (2.78/ set) was a significant decrease from the 1987 catch of 6.44/set but very near the lake class median of 2.71/set.  Sampled walleye ranged in length from 12.0 to 26.9 inches with a median length group of 21.0 to 21.9 inches.  Their mean weight of 2.30 pounds was an increase from 1987 (1.63/ pounds) and normal based on a lake class mean of 1.80 pounds.  Back-calculated age and growth data from spine and scale samples indicated that captured walleye ranged in age from one to eight years with 1989 having the strongest year class.  Growth of walleye from ages four to six was faster than the statewide rate of the species.\n  The yellow perch gillnet catch (38.11/set) was the lowest ever recorded on Green Lake since the first survey in 1957, but is still higher than the third quartile value (37.17/set).  Sampled yellow perch ranged in length from 5.0 to 9.4 inches with a median length group of 6.0 to 6.4 inches.  Their mean weight was 0.09 pounds which is just below the first quartile value (0.10 pounds) for the lake class mean.  Back-calculated age and growth data from scale samples indicated that captured yellow perch ranged from two to six years of age with 1989 having the strongest year class.  Growth was slower than the statewide rate for yellow perch.  The shoreline seine hauls captured forty nine young of the year yellow perch.\n  The black crappie gillnet catch (14.11/set) was higher than the 1987 catch of 10.67/set and above the third quartile value (3.50/set).  Sampled black crappie ranged from 4.5 to 9.4 inches in length with a median length group of 7.0 to 7.4 inches.  Their mean weight of 0.21 pounds is just below the first quartile value (0.23 pounds) of the lake class mean weight.  Back- calculated age and growth data from scale samples indicated that captured black crappie ranged from one to five years of age with the 1989 year class representing 50% of the sample.  Growth was normal based on the statewide growth rate of black crappie.\n  The bluegill trapnet catch (2.86/set) was down from the 1987 catch of 7.86/set and is below the first quartile value (11.71/set) of the lake class median.  Sampled bluegill ranged in length from 3.0 to 7.9 inches with a median length group of 5.5 to 5.9 inches.  Their mean weight of 0.20 pounds was normal compared to the lake class mean weight of 0.16 pounds.  Back-calculated age and growth data from scale samples indicated that captured bluegill ranged in age from one to five years with 1988 having the strongest year class.  Growth was normal based on the statewide growth rate of the species.  Bluegill abundance was most likely underestimated due to the lack of habitat and depth in the trapnetted areas.\n  Of the remaining eight species sampled (bowfin, common carp, white sucker, yellow bullhead, black bullhead, brown bullhead, hybrid sunfish, and pumpkinseed) only pumpkinseed had a net catch (0.14/set) below its first quartile value (0.67/ set) of the lake class.  Bowfin (1.57/set) and white sucker (4.78/set) had net catches above their respective third quartile values of 1.25 and 2.83/set.  Yellow bullhead, bowfin, and white sucker had mean weights below their respective lake class first quartile values of 0.43, 3.40, and 1.70 pounds.  The remaining species had normal mean weights, and net catches in the normal range.\n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Green Lake is primarily managed for walleye and northern pike. The walleye population is maintained through annual fingerling stocking. Green Lake is in lake class 27. which includes  moderately large, deep lakes with very hard water. To assess lake management goals and the success of the current stocking plan, Green Lake was surveyed in August of 2012. <br> \n <br> \nThe 2012 assessment found both walleye size and abundance at historic highs. The walleye catch (6.8/gillnet) was normal for the lake class and met the lake management goal. Over the last 30 years the catch rate for walleye has averaged just under 5 per gill net. Walleye were large compared to other lakes in class 27.  In the gill nets, walleyes ranged from 13.0 to 27.4 inches and averaged 3.1 pounds.  More than half the catch exceeded 20 inches in length. Age and growth analysis found good growth rates. Eight year classes were present with 5 and 7 year old walleye representing 49 and 28 percent of the total respectively. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike were also sampled within both the lake class norm and management goals. The 2012 catch rate (4.3/net) remained above the 30 year mean for Green Lake and was very similar to the 2007 rate. Like walleyes, the northern size was at a historic high. With a 3.8 pound average, pike were larger than found in most other lake class 27 lakes. Lengths ranged from 21.9 to 30.6 inches and averaged 25.9 inches. Five year classes were present. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie numbers, 16.8/gillnet, remained well above the lake class norm and lakes long term mean. The average size (0.3 pounds) has decreased some compared to the previous assessment, but remained within the normal range. Crappies were between 3.2 and 11.4 inches in length and averaged 8.1 inches. <br> \n <br> \nBased on the trap net catch, both bluegill abundance (6.7/trap net) and average size (0.15 pounds) were up slightly compared to 2007 and normal compared to other similar lakes. Trap netted bluegill averaged just 5.8 inches and ranged from 3.5 and 7.5 inches. Although not typically considered the sampling gear of choice for bluegill, gill nets had nearly the same catch rate as trap nets. These bluegill were noticeably larger, averaging 6.8 inches and over a quarter pound.   <br> \n  <br> \nLargemouth bass were sampled by night electrofishing at a rate of 62.7 per hour, the highest catch rate recorded for the lake. The average size of bass has decreased slightly with the increased abundance. Largemouth ranged from 5.8 to 19.0 inches with an 11.8 inch 1.1 pound average. Thirty six percent of adult bass were 15 inches or larger. Bass exhibited good growth, reaching 12 inches in four years. <br> \n <br> \nCommon carp, yellow perch, black bullhead, and yellow bullhead were all present in normal abundance. Bowfin (dogfish) and brown bullhead abundance were high while pumpkinseed sunfish and white sucker were present in low numbers.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Green Lake is an 802 acre basin managed for Walleye and Northern Pike. There is one public access located on the north side of the lake. Water clarity is moderate with algal blooms present as summer progresses. The Walleye population is currently maintained through biennial fingerling stocking (even numbered years). Green is in lake class 27.  <br> \n <br> \nIn 2021 a fisheries survey was conducted which included trap netting and gill netting from August 20th through August 23rd. Nine gill net sets and nine trap nets were used during the assessment.  The previous assessment on Green Lake was conducted in 2016. The Northern Pike catch rate was 4.9 fish per net which is within the interquartile range for the lake class and similar to the historic catch for the lake. Mean weight of pike sampled was 3.5 lbs.  Gill net catches for Walleyes were 3.7 fish per net. This is lower than the 2016 survey of 4.1 fish per net but still within the range typical for the lake class. Mean weight was above the lake class median at 2.3 lbs. Black Crappie catch in gill nets was high with 6.8 per net, well above average for this lake class. Sixty-seven percent of the crappie catch exceeded 8 inches in length. Mean weight of crappies was 0.31 lbs.  The Bluegill catch rate was 18.0 fish per net. This was similar to historical catches and average for the median catch for the lake class. Mean weight was also typical for the lake class and historical surveys. Bluegill sampled ranged from 1.0 to 9.1 inches and averaged 5.1 inches in length. Just 8 percent of the Bluegill sampled exceeded 7 inches in length.  Spring electrofishing found a Largemouth Bass catch rate of 56 fish per hour, similar to 54 per hour caught in 2016.  Bass averaged 12.1 inches and 1.2 lbs., ranging in length from 6.3 inches to 19.5 inches. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Based on respective local medians the present fish population is as follows:  The walleye (6.44/ set) shows a real increase from the 1982 survey (3.00/set) to a level well above the local median (3.52/set).  Growth rates are good and the overall size distribution is excellent (median length group 18.0 - 18.9 inches, mean weight 2.1 pounds).  The current walleye population is the product of sustained fingerling stocking with a minimal contribution from natural reproduction.  A drop in the northern pike net catch (1.44/set) from the 1982 survey (2.11/set) is not large enough to indicate a real decline in the population.  It is, however, well below the local median (3.88/set).  The northern pike population is the product of some natural reproduction supplemented with periodic fingerling stocking.  Length frequency and aging data from the current survey suggests that stocking, as opposed to natural reproduction, is contributing to the bulk of the population.  This has not been the case in previous surveys.  An unusually narrow size distribution is seen in the current survey, 13 of 14 northern pike between 19.0 - 22.9 inches.  Yellow perch (39.44/set) show a real decline from 1982 (83.89/set) but remain well above the local median (24.27/set).  Yellow perch tend to be small (median length group 5.5 - 5.9 inches).  Only 2 largemouth bass were taken in test nets but 78 YOY (young of the year) were recorded in shoreline seining.  Smallmouth bass (2) were taken for the first time during the current survey. The bluegill net catch (7.86/set) is above that of 1982 (4.50/ set) but still well below the local median (25.67/ set).  The majority of bluegills are very small (median length group 4.0 - 4.4 inches).  The black crappie population (2.43/set) remains far below the local median (18.45/set) and consists of predominantly small fish (median length group 5.5 - 5.9 inches).  Black bullheads were taken more readily in gillnets than trapnets but are still well below the local median. Other species taken in test nets (bowfin, carp, white sucker, yellow bullhead, common shiner, and pumpkinseed) do not appear to be substantially above or below local medians nor to have undergone any noteworthy changes from the previous survey. Although not specifically indicated by test nets, a large carp population is suspected and has been utilized by commercial fishermen in the past.</p>",

Yellow perch representing the major forage species was very high at 83.89 per set.  The hybrid, pumpkinseed, and bluegill sunfish had low to very low populations respectively.  This has been the history in general of the panfish status in Green Lake.  The black crappie was low at 2.38 in the trapnet but was high at 19.44 per set in the gillnet.  The white sucker, black bullhead, yellow bullhead, brown bullhead, carp, and bowfin all had low population figures.  The largemouth bass, while absent in both the trapnet and gillnet, showed up well in the shoreline seining results.</p>",

The walleye while low at 3.00 per set was slightly high in pounds per set at 8.53.  Average weight per fish was 2.84 pounds.  The yellow perch population was very high at 74.83 per set, but has shown a continuous decline from a high of 641.00 per set in 1957.  The white sucker and carp had slightly low median figures while the bowfin and hybrid sunfish were slightly high.  The common shiner, black bullhead, and brown bullhead all had low median figures.  The yellow bullhead and pumpkinseed sunfish had high median figures.  The bluegill and black crappie maintained their very low population status as has been their history in this lake.  Both the largemouth and smallmouth bass were taken in the natural reproduction shoreline seining.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Green Lake is 802 acres and managed for walleye and northern pike.  The walleye population is maintained through biannual fingerling stocking.  Green Lake is in lake class 27.  Lakes assigned to class 27 are typically large, deep lakes with very hard water.  To assess lake management goals and the success of the current stocking plan, Green Lake was surveyed in September of 2002.The walleye catch (6.2/gillnet) was normal for the lake class and met the lake management goal.  Over the last 30 years the catch rate for walleye has averaged just under 5/gillnet.  Walleye were large compared to other lakes in class 27 and other Green Lake catches.  Sampled walleyes ranged from 10.4 to 25.9 inches and averaged 2.8 pounds.  Four and five year old walleyes, likely from the fingerling stocking in 1997 and the yearling stocking in 1999, accounted for 64% of the catch.  Night electrofishing in the fall found an abundance of yearling walleye from the 2001 stocking but failed to sample any fingerlings, indicating very limited natural reproduction.  Northern pike were also sampled within both the lake class norm and management goals.  The 2002 catch rate (3.2/net) was very near the 30 year mean for Green Lake.  Like walleyes, the northerns were large with a 2.8 pound average.  At 72.9 per gillnet, yellow perch abundance was the highest it's been since 1982.  Although the perch catch was high compared to similar lakes, they averaged less then one tenth of a pound with 80% of the catch between 5.5 and 6.5 inches.  The current perch population provides a plentiful forage base for walleye and northern pike and is likely responsible for their present quality size.  Black crappie numbers, 19.4/gillnet and 21.3/trapnet, were high compared to the lake class norm and the highest recorded catch for the lake.  The average size was below normal (0.26 pounds) but 40% of the catch was over 8 inches, a size acceptable to some anglers.  The crappie population was fairly young with the 1999 year class accounting for 90% of the catch. The bluegill catch (10.9/trapnet) was normal compared to other lakes but higher than the 20 year Green Lake average.  Size was larger than normal with a 6.8 inch and 0.3 pound average.  Forty five percent of the catch was greater than 7 inches.Largemouth bass were sampled by night electrofishing at a rate of 11.7 per hour.  Although the catch rate was low to moderate, bass were quality sized ranging from 11.8 to 18.7 inches and averaging 2.5 pounds.  The 1997 catch was slightly higher but bass were noticeably smaller.Shoreline seining sampled young of the year bluegill, largemouth bass, and yellow perch.  Black, brown, and yellow bullhead were all present in normal abundance.  Bowfin (dogfish), common carp, and white sucker abundance was high while pumpkinseed sunfish were present in low numbers.   </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Green Lake is primarily managed for Walleye and Northern Pike. The Walleye population is currently maintained through annual fingerling stocking. Green Lake is in lake class 27 which includes moderately large, deep lakes with very hard water. To assess lake management goals and the success of the current stocking plan, Green Lake was surveyed in August of 2016. <br> \n <br> \nThe 2016 assessment found both Walleye size and abundance similar to the lake historic average. The Walleye catch (4.1 per gill net) was normal for the lake class and met the lake management goal. Over the last 30 years the catch rate for Walleye has averaged just under 5 per gill net. Walleye were large compared to other lakes in class 27.  In the gill nets, sampled Walleye ranged from 9.7 to 27.0 inches and averaged 2.7 pounds.  More than half the catch exceeded 20 inches in length. Age analysis found good growth rates. Nine year classes were present, all associated with stocking events.  The 2011 year class represented 24 percent of the total catch.  These 5 year old fish averaged 20.7 inches. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike were also sampled within both the lake class norm and management goals. The 2016 catch rate (6.8 per net) was a historic high for Green Lake. Like Walleye, the Northern Pike were large compared to other lakes in class 27, averaging 3.1 pounds and 24 inches.  Six year classes were present with 2012 representing nearly half the catch. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie numbers, 26.4 per gill net, were at a historic high and remained well above the lake class norm. The average size (0.24 pounds) was on the small size compared recent catches. Crappies ranged from 3.9 to 13.7 inches in length with a 7.6 inch average. <br> \n <br> \nBased on the trap net catch, both Bluegill abundance (23.4/trap net) and average size (0.18 pounds) were up slightly compared to 2012 and normal compared to similar lakes. Trap netted Bluegill averaged 6.3 inches in length and ranged from 3.0 and 9.3 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass were sampled by night electrofishing at a rate of 53.7 per hour, very similar to the historic high rate established in 2012. The average size of bass has increased slightly. Largemouth ranged from 8.3 to 19.5 inches with a 13.3 inch 1.5 pound average. Fifty five percent of bass were 14 inches or larger.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch were captured in the gill nets at a rate of 32.7 per lift.  This rate was the highest since the 2002 assessment and within normal ranges for lake class 27 but below the long term average for Green Lake.  Although Yellow Perch have historically been on the small side (a 6.3 inch average in this survey), they provide the primary forage for both Walleye and Northern Pike. <br> \n</p>",
