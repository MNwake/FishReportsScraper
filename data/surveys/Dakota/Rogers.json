                "narrative": "<p>Rogers Lake is located in Mendota Heights.  The lake is divided into a larger south basin and smaller north basin.  Both basins are shallow, with a maximum depth of 8 feet.  There is a city park on the south side with a fishing pier.  Fishing from shore is also possible from the road that divides the two basins.  Dense submerged vegetation often occurs by mid-summer which can interfere with angling. Motorboats are not allowed but canoe access is easy from the park.  The park has picnic facilities, toilets, a playground, parking, and a skate park.  The lake is aerated in the winter to prevent fish kill. <br> \n <br> \nThe 2008 fish survey found abundant bluegill of moderate size.  Average length was 5.5 inches, but few fish were over 7 inches.  Northern pike were moderately abundant and of good size.  Average length was just under 30 inches.  Channel catfish are stocked but abundance was low.  The fish sampled were generally large, with most between 19 and 28 inches.  Black crappie and yellow perch were both sampled in low numbers, with most between 6 and 7 inches.  Black bullhead were found in low numbers; much lower than in previous surveys.  Largemouth bass were sampled in low numbers, but abundance may be higher than indicated because the sample gears used are not effective on bass. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Rogers Lake is located in Mendota Heights and is divided into a larger south basin and smaller north basin.  Both basins are shallow, with a maximum depth of 8 feet.  There is a city park on the south side with a fishing pier.  Fishing from shore is also possible from the road that divides the two basins. Dense submersed vegetation often occurs by mid-summer which can interfere with angling. Motorboats are not allowed but canoe access is easy from the park.  The park has picnic facilities, toilets, a playground, parking, and a skate park.  The lake is aerated in the winter to prevent fish kill. <br> \n <br> \nThe 2018 fish survey found abundant Bluegill of average size with few fish were over 7 inches.  Northern Pike were very abundant and were small in size averaging 20 inches.  Black Crappie and Yellow Perch were both sampled in low numbers with both averaging slightly over 9 inches. Although Largemouth Bass were also sampled in low numbers, abundance may be higher than indicated due to the abundant vegetation found in the lake and the passive sampling gears used during the survey are not particularly effective for sampling Largemouth Bass. <br> \n</p>",

A city park on the norths side of the large basin has a fishing pier.  Motorboats are not allowed, but carry-in boats and canoes can be launced from the park.  The south basin is aerated in the winter to prevent fishkill.This survey found abundant bluegills with an average lenght of 6 inches, and 20% over 7 inches.  Black crappie are moderately abundan, but small with and average length of 6 inches and very few over 7 inches.  Northern pike aubundance was moderate to low with lengths from 14 to 27 inches and a 22 inch average.  Channel catfish from a 2001 stocking are moderately abundant and are 12 to 13 inches. Largemouth bass are fairly abundant and were sampled up to 15 inches.  Yellow perch were sampled in low numbers.  Black bullheads, pumpkinseeds, and hybrid sunfish are all moderately abundant.</p>",
