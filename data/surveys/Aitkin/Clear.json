                "narrative": "<p>Clear Lake, as its name implies, is a clear water lake located in south central Aitkin County.  The lake has a long history of stocking, dating back to 1912.  The two most common species stocked have been walleye and northern pike.  Since 1980 walleye have been the only species stocked.  Analysis of walleye stocking effects indicate that natural reproduction does not appreciably contribute to the population.  Past stocking success has also been variable as measured by netting indices.Northern pike are relatively abundant in Clear Lake and have a wide range of sizes available to the angler, including good numbers of fish greater than 25 inches in length.  Angler harvest of quality size pike is not excessive, to the point that larger pike are rare.  A greater presence of large pike would be desirable to provide additional predation on the over-abundant small pike.Bluegill are small and are found in great abundance in Clear Lake.  This is probably the result of several factors including the abundant spawning habitat available, the heavy bed of submerged vegetation that shelter the young bluegill from predators and a fish community structure incapable of providing adequate predation to allow better growth and a larger average size.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Clear Lake, as its name implies, is a clear water lake located in south central Aitkin County.  The secchi disc reading was 16 feet.  There is a State owned public access East of Highway 6 on the Northeast side of the lake.  There is also a nice swimming beach adjacent the public access. <br> \n <br> \nClear Lake has a long history of supplemental stocking, dating back to 1912.  The two most common species stocked have been walleye and northern pike (pike discontinued in 1980).  The gill net catch rate for walleye in 2008 was 1.0 fish per net, which is down from 2.3 per net in the 2003 survey, and the lowest observed in all surveys. All of the walleye observed in 2008 were from stocked year classes. The 2006 and 2007 stockings were well represented in this year's catch and should provide better fishing in the near future.  Analysis of age distributions of the walleye gill net samples indicates that natural reproduction has not appreciably contributed to the population in recent years.  As recently as 1991, over one-half of the gill netted sample were fish from natural reproduction.  This equated to over 2 fish per net.  But by the 1996 assessment, less than 1 walleye per net was naturally reproduced, and this continued to decline to 0.1 fish per net in 2002, and finally 0 fish per net in 2008.  Considering that the walleye population continued to spawn and produce catchable size walleyes throughout the 1970s and 1980s, and considering that northern pike abundance has been relatively stable since 1974, it is quite feasible that the lack of natural reproduction in recent years is due to habitat degradation or loss. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike are relatively abundant in Clear Lake and have a wide range of sizes available to the angler, with 19% of the catch greater than 24 inches in length.  A greater presence of large northern pike would be desirable to provide additional predation on the over abundant small pike, therefore it is important for anglers to release these bigger fish.  Anecdotally, small northern pike were observed in the stomachs of larger pike in this survey. <br> \n <br> \nThere is a high abundance of small bluegill in Clear Lake.  This is probably the result of several factors, including the abundant spawning habitat available, the heavy bed of submerged vegetation that shelter the young bluegill from predators, and a fish community structure incapable of providing adequate predation to allow better growth.   The average size increased this year, with 28% of the population over 7 inches.  We also observed some fish over 8 inches long. These larger bluegill are the result of longevity, as 70% of the bluegill were over 7 years of age, with the oldest being 14 years old. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie have made a comeback from the last survey with a strong year class in 2005.  They average 7.5 inches, but will continue to grow. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass were plentiful with 4.4 fish per gill net, which is well above average for this lake type.  The problem is the average size is only 10 inches, which is small for this lake type. The largest bass observed in this survey were 14-16 inches long; although, in previous assessments fish as long as 20 inches have been observed in low numbers. <br> \n</p>",

The assessment was conducted on September 6, 2011.  The total sample time was 1 hour with no YOY walleyes sampled.  All of the adult fish sampled were from stocked years, suggesting natural reproduction no longer contributes significantly to the fishery.  Twenty-one of the 24 fish sampled were age-1 fish, presumably from the 2010 fingerling stocking.  Fry stocking began in 2011 and continued fall electrofishing will be useful to determine the effectiveness of the current fry with contingent fingerling strategy.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Clear Lake is located in Glen Township in Aitkin County. There is state owned land including a swimming area and a public access with a concrete log ramp on the east side of the lake. The lake is popular for residents and visitors for its clear water, sandy shorelines, and variety of angling opportunities. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye are the primary management species and various stocking strategies, primarily as fingerlings, have been used since the 40's. Most recently after 6 years of annual Walleye fry stocking, no surviving age-0 Walleye were observed in annual fall electrofishing surveys. During that time period fingerlings were stocked to supplement the fishery when fry were known not to have survived. It's unclear what factors were limiting stocked fry survival. Currently Walleye fingerlings are being stocked annually at 0.5/lb per littoral acre. Historically, fingerlings stocked at a high rate have not performed better than at lower rates. It's thought that the lower stocking level may also relieve pressure on Yellow Perch and result in higher survival for juvenile Walleye. The Walleye catch (1.2/gill net) showed a decrease yet remained within the normal range for similar lake types. The catch was below the goal of 3/net in the current management plan despite the intensive stocking strategy. While recent surveys have been between 1 and 2.9/net, prior assessments have ranged from 3.5 to 5.5/net.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike catch (9.1/gill net) increased slightly since 2016 and is in the normal range for this lake class. Size distribution in gill nets ranged from 10.4 to 35.3\" with an average of 19.2\" and 1.2 pounds, and 28% were greater than 24\". Large pike play an important role in lakes and anglers are encouraged to release fish greater than 26\" to maximize their benefit. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass continue to be found in good numbers with a gill net catch of 4.4/gill net. The bass population has shown an increasing trend over time in gill net catches. Bass from gill nets ranged from 6.8 to 16.1\", with an average of 10.1\" and 0.6 pounds. Spring night time electrofishing was also done in 2019. Sixty Largemouth Bass were caught which translated to a catch rate of 31.3/hr. Size of bass from electrofishing ranged from 7.4 to 20.3\" with a mean size of 11.8\". <br> \n <br> \nThe Bluegill catch (48.7/trap net) showed a slight increase compared to 2014. Sizes ranged from 3.5 to 8.1\" and averaged 6.5\". Few Bluegill greater than 8\" were sampled, which is similar to previous surveys of this lake. Black Crappie gill net (1.9/net) and trap net (1.1/net) catches remained within the normal range for the lake class. Sizes combined from both gears averaged 8.3\", with 33 percent greater than 10\" and fish up to 11.8\" sampled. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

THE CATCH INDICES FOR NORTHERN PIKE, YELLOW BULLHEAD AND PUMPKINSEED ARE ABOVE THE THIRD REGIONAL QUARTILE. CATCH INDICES FOR BLACK BULLHEAD, BROWN BULLHEAD, GREEN SUNFISH, AND BLACK CRAPPIE ARE BELOW THE FIRST REGIONAL QUAR- TILE. CATCH INDICES FOR WHITE SUCKER, BLACK BULL- HEAD, BROWN BULLHEAD, ROCK BASS, LARGEMOUTH BASS AND BLACK CRAPPIE ARE BETWEEN THE FORST AND THIRD AREA QUARTILES. THE CATCH INDICES FOR NORTHERN PIKE, YELLOW BULLHEAD, PUMPKINSEED, BLUEGILL, YELLOW PERCH AND WALLEYE ARE ABOVE THE THIRD AREA QUARTILE.  NORTHERN PIKE RANGED FROM ONE TO EIGHT YEARS OF AGE. AGES ONE, FOUR, FIVE AND SIX EACH CONTRIBUTED APPROXIMATELY ELEVEN PERCENT TO THE SAMPLE.GROWTH FOR THE FIRST INCREMENT WAS NORMAL. THE SECOND AND THIRD INCREMENTS FROM NINE- TEEN TO TWENTY SEVEN PERCENT SLOWER THAN NORMAL. GROWTH FROM THE FOURTH INCREMENT THROUGH THE EIGHT INCREMENT IS NORMAL. THIS GROWTH RATE PATTERN  TAKEN IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE NUMBERS OF NORTHERN PIKE FOUND IN EACH AGE GROUP MAY INDICATE THAT 1983 AND 1984 WERE SUPER YEARS FOR REPRODUC- TION OF NORTHERN PIKE AND THAT INTRASPECIFIC COM- PETITION MAY REDUCING THEIR GROWTH RATES AND ALSO THE GROWTH RATE OF THE 1985 YEAR CLASS. ROCK BASS RANGED FROM TWO TO SEVEN YEARS OF AGE. REPRODUCTION SEEMS TO BE FAIRLY CONSISTENT AND THE GROWTH RATES ARE WITHIN THE NORMAL GROWTH RANGE FOR ROCK BASS IN MINNESOTA. PUMPKINSEED RANGED FROM FOUR TO SEVEN YEARS OF AGE. FORTY SIX PERCENT OF THE FISH AGED WERE SIX YEARS OLD. GROWTH DURING THE SECOND INCREMENT WAS VERY SLOW. GROWTH FOR THE THIRD AND FORTH INCRE- MENTS RANGED FROM TWENTY TO THIRTY THREE PERCENT SLOWER THAN NORMAL. NORMAL GROWTH RATES WERE FOUND IN THE FIFTH THROUGH SEVENTH INCREMENTS. BLUEGILL RANGED FROM THREE TO SEVEN YEARS OF AGE. THERE WERE NO DOMINANT YEAR CLASSES FOUND IN THE SAMPLE AGED. GROWTH THE FIRST INCREMENT WAS NORMAL WITH SLOW GROWTH THE NEXT FOUR INCREMENTS. THE GROWTH FOR EACH OF THE INCREMENTS TWO THROUGH FIVE WAS FROM .81 TO .88 INCHES AND RANGED FROM TWENTY TO FORTY SEVEN PERCENT SLOWER THAN NORMAL. GROWTH FOR THE SIXTH AND SEVENTH INCREMENTS WAS NORMAL. LARGEMOUTH BASS RANGED FROM TWO TO FIVE YEARS OF AGE. FIFTY SEVEN PERCENT OF THE FIRST THREE INCRE- MENTS WAS NORMAL. GROWTH THE FOURTH INCREMENT RANGED FROM TWENTY THREE TO THIRTY EIGHT PERCENT SLOWER THAN NORMAL AND THE FIFTH INCREMENT RANGED FROM TEN TO FORTY FOUR PERCENT SLOWER THAN NORMAL. BLACK CRAPPIE WERE ALL ONE AND TWO YEARS OLD, WITH SIX OF THE FISH AGED BEING TWO YEARS OLD. GROWTH THE FIRST INCREMENT IS FIFTY TO SIXTY FIVE PERCENT FASTER THAN NORMAL, WITH GROWTH THE SECOND INCRE- MENT RANGING FROM TWENTY EIGHT TO THIRTY FIVE PER- CENT FASTER THAN NORMAL. WALLEYE RANGED FROM TWO TO SEVEN YEARS OF AGE. THE 1981 YEAR CLASS WAS THE STRONGEST ONE AGED WITH APPARENTLY FAIR NATURAL REPRODUCTION FOR WALLEYE. THE GROWTH RATES FOR ALL INCREMENTS ARE WITHIN THE NORMAL RANGE. THE NORTHERN PIKE CATCH INCREASED DRAMATICALLY FROM 14.17 TO 23.2 PER GILLNET, AN INCREASE OF SIXTY-FOUR PERCENT. THE MEAN WT DECREASED 0.3 PDS AND THE MEAN LENGTH DECREASED FROM 17.6 INCHES TO 15.7 INCHES. THE RANGE OF LENGTH FREQUENCIES IS BASICALLY THE SAME FOR THE TWO SAMPLING RECORDS, 1980 AND 1986. THE DIFFERENCE IN MEAN LENGTH CAN BE SEEN IN THE FACT THAT IN 1980 TWENTY SEVEN PERCENT OF THE CATCH WAS BETWEEN 12.0 AND 14.9 INCHES WHILE THIS SAME LENGTH GROUP HAS FIFTY PERCENT OF THE 1986 CATCH. THE ROCK BASS INDEX OF ABUNDANCE INCREASED FROM 0.25 TO 0.8 PER TRAP- NET. THE LENGTH FREQUENCY RANGE DID NOT CHANGE EXCEPT FOR THREE INDIVIDUALS, ONE 3.5 TO 3.9 INCHS 8.5 TO 8.9 INCHES AND ONE 9.5 TO 9.9 INCHES. ALL OF WHICH WERE CAUGHT IN 1986. THE MEAN LENGTH DID INCREASE SLIGHTLY. PUMPKINSEED DID INCREASE IN ABUNDANCE FROM 7.75 TO 12.5 PER TRAPNET, AN INCREASE OF SIXTY ONE PERCENT. THE MEAN LENGTH INCREASED FROM 5.1 TO 6.1 INCHES . THE RANGE OF LENGTH FREQUENCIES SHIFTED FROM 3.0 TO 6.4 INCHES IN 1980 TO 3.5 TO 7.4 INCHES IN 1986. THIS SHIFT IN THE LENGTH FREQUENCIES IS A RESULT OF OLDER FISH BEING CAUGHT IN 1986. THE BLUEGILLS DECREASED IN ABUNDANCE FROM 59.0 PER LIFT TO 33.8 PER LIFT A DECREASE OF FORTY THREE PERCENT. THE MEAN LEN- GTH INCREASE FROM 5.4 TO 5.6 INCHES. TIS SLIGHT INCREASE IN MEAN LENGTH WAS CAUSED BY FEWER SMALL BLUEGILL SAMPLED IN 1986. SEVENTEEN PERCENT OF THE BLUEGILLS SAMPLED IN 1980 WERE LESS THAN 4.5 INCHES IN LENGTH. IN 1986, FISH LESS THAN 4.5 INCHES IN LENGTH MADE UP ONLY 9.8 PERCENT OF THE SAMPLE. THE GILLNET CATCH INDEX FOR YELLOW PERCH DECREASED FROM 33.67 TO 15.5 A SIGNIFICANT DE- CREASE SINCE 1980. THE MEAN LENGTH INCREASED FROM 6.8 INCHES IN 1980 TO 7.9 INCHES IN 1986. IN 1980 THE RANGE OF LENGTHS SAMPLED WAS 4.5 TO 9.9 INCHES IN 1986 THE LENGTH FREQUENCIES RANGED FROM 5.5 TO 9.9A INCHES. THIS INCREASE IN MEAN LENGTH AND THE SHIFT IN THE LENGTH FREQUENCIES TO A LARGER MINI- MUM LENGTH OBSERVED MAY BE A REACTION OF THE YEL- LOW PERCH POPULATION TO THE INCREASE IN THE NUM- BERS OF SMALL NORTHERN PIKE. SINCE THE OPTIMUM SIZE PREY OF NORTHERN PIKE IS FROM THIRTY TO FIFTY PERCENT OF THEIR OWN BODY LENGTH AND SINCE MOST OF THE NORTHERN PIKE SAMPLED IN CLEAR LAKE WERE LESS THAN SIXTEEN INCHES IN LENGTH, THERE WOULD BE VERY HEAVY PREDATION ON SMALLER YELLOW PERCH. THIS HEAVY PREDATION AT FIRST WOULD BE SEEN AS A REDUCTION IN THE NUMBER OF SMALLER INDIVIDUALS SEEN AS A REDUCTION IN THE NUMBER OF SMALLER IN- DIVIDUALS SEEN IN THE CATCH WITH A CORRESPONDING SHIFT IN THE LENGTH FREQUENCIES TOWARD AN APPARENT POPULATION OF LARGER, OLDER INDIVIDUALS. THE WALLEYE POPULATION INDEX DECREASED FROM 4.8 TO 3.5 PER GILLNET. THE RANGE OF LENGTH FREQUENCIES AND THE MEAN LENGTH HAS NOT CHANGED SIGNIFICANTLY IN THE SIX YEARS SINCE THE LAST TEST NETTING.</p>",

Sampling was conducted on September 24, 2014. The total sample time was 1.2 hours with no YOY walleyes sampled and 6 older fish captured. Fry stocking began in 2011 and no YOY walleye have been sampled in any subsequent fall electrofishing survey, but catch of age 1 fish has ranged from 1-21/hour. Results from a full resurvey conducted in 2014 also suggest that density of age 1 fish was low, but older fish were present (see Clear 2014 resurvey report). Fall night electrofishing will continue at least until the current stocking strategy is evaluated following a special gill net assessment scheduled for 2016.</p>",

Northern pike (73 of 77 aged) ranged one to eight years of age with a strong year class indicated for 1988.  The growth rates for the second, third and fourth annual increments were slower than normal.  Total length at formation of the sixth annulus was normal.  Bluegill (45 of 161 aged) ranged from three to eight plus years of age, and were primarily seven years of age or older.  The growth rates for the first through the fifth annual increments were slower than normal.  Total length at formation of the eighth annulus was less than normal.  Largemouth bass (29 of 30 aged) ranged from one to eight plus years of age with a strong year class indicated for 1988. Growth rates were normal.  Black crappie (10 of 10 aged) ranged from two to four years of age with one-half of the sample from the 1989 year class.  The growth rate for the first annual increment was slow.  The growth rates for the third and fourth annual increment were fast.  Total length at formation of the fourth annulus was normal.  Yep (28 of 34 aged) ranged from two to eight plus years of age.  Growth rates for the first and second annual increments were slower than normal. Total length at formation of the fourth annulus was normal.  Walleye (29 of 29 aged) ranged from two to eight plus years of age with a strong year class indicated for 1988.  Clear lake was stocked in 1987 with yearlings, which shows up as the moderately strong 1986 year class, and in 1989 with fingerlings.  The strong 1984 and 1988 year classes represent years of good natural reproduction.  Northern pike and yellow perch gill net catches decreased from the 1986 assessment to the 1991 assessment (Wilcoxon's signed rank test: northern pike p=0.0322, n=6; yep, p=0.0312, n=6).  Pumpkinseed trap net catches decreased from the 1986 assessment to the 1991 assessment (Wilcoxon's signed rank test, p=0.0322, n=12).</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>This survey was conducted, in part, to assess walleye stocking in Clear Lake. The catch of 1.8 walleyes per net set is about the median, or average, rate for lakes similar to Clear Lake. Few small walleyes were caught, indicating that the stocking efforts in 1993 did not succeed. In this survey, year classes which were not stocked were weak. Walleyes ranged up to 28.4 inches and averaged 19.3 inches in length.     The most probable cause for reduced stocking success is too much predation on young walleyes from northern pike. The pike population is near the high end of normal for lakes similar to Clear Lake. Northern pike ranged up to 34.4 inches and averaged 18.5 inches. The northern pike's age and size distributions are broad and indicate consistent recruitment and a level of angler harvest which is not depleting the larger pike. The slow growth for three to five year old fish is probably due to limited forage.    High predation by northern pike shows up in the yellow perch size structure, where few perch under 7 inches were caught. Most of the perch are between 7.5 and 9.5 inches and were caught in deeper water where predation by northern pike may be less. The perch, though larger than in many other area lakes, tend to contain many parasites which seems to have reduced their appeal to anglers.    Bluegills are abundant and small, reaching only 6.4 inches in 8 years of life. Very few bluegills in the survey were over 8.0 inches long. Abundant spawning habitat will allow the continued high reproduction and survival for bluegills which has prevailed in Clear Lake for decades.    The habitat also supports relatively high, though sporadic, largemouth bass production and survival. Growth tends to be slow. Anglers should be able to catch a lot of bass, though few fish will reach memorable sizes. Most of the fish in this survey were in the 12 to 13 inch range and should provide good bass fishing for a year or two. Black crappie survey catches have been relatively low and crappies probably do not provide much action throughout the year.</p>",

Sampling was conducted on September 16, 2013.  The total sample time was 1.5 hours with no YOY walleyes sampled.  All fish sampled were from stocked years, suggesting natural reproduction no longer contributes significantly to the fishery.  Ten of the 18 fish sampled were age-1 fish (12/hr), presumably from the 2012 contingent fingerling stocking, but their origin is unknown because fingerlings are stocked in the same year as fry.  Fry stocking began in 2011 and no YOY walleye have been sampled in any subsequent fall electrofishing survey, but catch of age-1 fish has ranged from 7-21/hour.  A full resurvey scheduled for 2014, as well as fall electrofishing in 2014, will be useful in determining the effectiveness of current walleye fry with contingent fingerling stocking strategy.  </p>",

Sampling was conducted on September 29, 2015. The total sample time was 1.1 hours with no YOY walleyes sampled. A single 1 yr old walleye was sampled at a catch rate of .9/hr.  A few other larger adult walleye were observed but not captured.  Fry stocking began in 2011 and no YOY walleye have been sampled in any subsequent fall electrofishing surveys to date. Previous catches of age 1 fish have ranged from 1-21/hour. Results from a full resurvey, conducted in 2014, also suggest that density of age 1 fish was low, but older fish were present (see Clear 2014 resurvey report). Fall night electrofishing will continue at least until the current stocking strategy is evaluated following a special gill net assessment scheduled for 2016.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Clear Lake is located in Glen Township in Aitkin County. There is state owned land with swimming area and public access with concrete log ramp on the east side of the lake. The lake is popular for residents and visitors for its clear water, sandy shorelines, and variety of angling opportunities. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye are the primary management species and have been stocked primarily as fingerlings since the 1940's.  The current strategy began in 2011, and calls for annual walleye fry stocking with additional fingerling stocking as needed.  Walleye gill net catch was 1.9/net in 2014, compared to 1.0/net in 2008, and was within the expected range for this type of lake.  All walleye were from stocked years, with the 2010 fingerling stocked year class making up 41% of the gill net catch.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike abundance decreased to 7.1/gill net, which is the lowest level since the initial fish survey of the lake in 1970.  Size was generally small and averaged just 17.4\" and 1.5 pounds, although a few pike over 30\" were sampled.  Large pike play an important role in lakes and anglers are encouraged to release fish greater than 24\" to maximize their benefit. <br> \nThe largemouth bass gill net catch of 5.3/net was the highest to date and continued a trend of increasing catches in each of the five surveys conducted since 1991.  Ages ranged from 2-10 years old, with each of the nine year classes represented in the sample. Most bass were less than 12\", but one fish over 18\" was sampled. <br> \n <br> \nPanfish anglers tend to target the lake's black crappie as they reach a larger size more regularly than do the bluegill. While not overly abundant, crappie size was good and averaged about 8.5\" in 2014, with fish over 11\" observed in the sample.  Bluegill are fairly abundant, with good numbers of fish 6.5-7.5\" long. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A gill net only assessment of Clear Lake was conducted the week of 7/5/2016 to aid in the evaluation of a walleye fry stocking strategy in place since 2011.  The plan called for stocking walleye fry annually at a rate of 1000/littoral acre (360,000). A contingency plan to also stock walleye fingerlings annually at a rate of 2 pounds per littoral acre (730 lbs), conditional upon young-of-the-year (YOY) electrofishing catch rates being less than 15/hr was also in place. No YOY walleye were sampled in any of the six subsequent fall electrofishing surveys through 2016. The gill net catch rates for walleye during this time period were 1.9/net (2014) and 2.0/net (2016), which were nearly identical to catches found in 1996 and 2002. The catch was below the goal of 3/net in the current plan despite the intensive stocking strategy.  While the five most recent surveys have been between 1 and 2/net (1996-2016), prior assessments ranged from 2.9 to 5.5/net (1970-1991).  Since no YOY walleye were observed during fall electrofishing surveys it's thought that the fry were unable to survive and contingent fingerling stockings are supporting the walleye fishery at this time. Fry stocking will be discontinued in 2017, and walleye management will change to annual base fingerling stocking.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch, northern pike and largemouth bass catches were all comparable to recent surveys, although the number of larger northern pike (>24\") was the lowest observed since the 1970 survey. Black crappie catches were also lower than normal at 0.3/net, compared to approximately 2/net the previous 2 surveys.   <br> \n</p>",

Sampling was conducted on September 25, 2012.  The total sample time was 1 hour with no YOY walleyes sampled.  All fish sampled were from stocked years, suggesting natural reproduction no longer contributes significantly to the fishery.  Twelve of the 16 fish sampled were age-1 fish, presumably from the 2011 contingent fingerling stocking, but their origin is unknown because fingerlings are stocked in the same year as fry.  Fry stocking began in 2011 and no YOY walleye have been sampled in either fall electrofishing survey, but catch of age-1 fish has ranged from 12-21/hour.  Continued fall electrofishing will be useful in determining the effectiveness of the current fry with contingent fingerling strategy.</p>",

This survey was completed in addition to the standard resurvey conducted the week of July 14, 2014. Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake (14 stations) and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible.  Species information was gathered as part of a statewide project to evaluate the fish Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) for Minnesota lakes.  <br> \n <br> \nBackpack electrofishing was completed at all 14 stations, but one site was sampled from the boat due to unstable footing.  A 50-foot seine was used to sample 4 stations, a 15-foot seine was used at 5 stations, and site conditions prevented the use of seines at 5 sites.  Nearshore sampling captured several intolerant fish species including blackchin shiner, blacknose shiner, Iowa darter, and rock bass. <br> \n  <br> \nClear Lake falls within lake class 29 based on the Schupp lake classification used by MnDNR and within Group 4 lakes for evaluating IBI data.  IBI scores range from 0 to 100 and the draft impairment threshold for this group of lakes is 38 (90% CI 30-46) and the potential exceptional quality level is set at 59.  The IBI score calculated from this survey, using standard gill net and trap net data from the 2014 resurvey, was 53.  The score calculated from data collected in 2011 was also 53.  <br> \n</p>",
