                "narrative": "<p>Ida Lake is a 79-acre lake located three miles northeast of Winsted in Wright County.  Ida Lake has a maximum depth of 26 feet and water clarity of 1.5 feet.  Ida Lake has 1.6 miles of shoreline with 76% of the lake considered littoral area (<15 ft deep).  There is one public access located along the northeast side of the lake, however there is no designated parking area.  The public access is maintained by the Winsted Sportsman\u0019s Club. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass catch in 2006 (75.3 fish/hr) was above the average catch rate for Montrose Area lakes (59/hr).  Largemouth bass ranged in length from 6 - 19 inches with an average length and weight of 12.4 inches and 1.3 lbs.  Largemouth bass reproduction has been successful with multiple years classes sampled during the survey.  Largemouth bass in Ida Lake take about five years to reach 12 inches.  The oldest fish sampled was 16 years old and 19.1 inches long. <br> \n <br> \nThe catch of northern pike in 2006 (8.5/gill net) was similar to 1990 and above the range of expected values for similar lakes.  Northern pike ranged in length from 20 - 33 inches with an average length and weight of 24.1 inches and 3.1 pounds.  Reproduction had been consistent in the past and multiple year classes were present during the survey, however no fish younger than four years old were sampled.  Northern pike in Ida Lake grow to 24 inches in 5 - 6 years. <br> \n <br> \nNo yellow perch were sampled during the 2006 survey and yellow perch abundance has historically been low and was 1.7/gill net in the 1990 survey. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill catch (41.1/trap net) was similar to those in 1990, but within the range of expected values for similar lakes.  Bluegill ranged in length from 3 - 7 inches with an average length of 5.5 inches.  Reproduction has been consistent with multiple year classes were sampled during the survey.  Bluegill from Ida Lake take about eight years to reach seven inches.  The largest bluegill sampled was 7.3 inches long and 8 years old. <br> \n <br> \nThe catch rate of black crappie (7.0/trap net) was similar to 1990 and within the range of expected values for similar lakes.  Black crappie ranged in length from 4 - 9 inches with an average length of 7.0 inches.  Reproduction has been consistent and multiple year classes were sampled during the survey.  Black crappie from Ida Lake take 6 - 7 years to reach eight inches.  The largest black crappie sampled was 8.9 inches and 12 years old. <br> \n <br> \nBased on these catches, anglers can expect good fishing for largemouth bass, northern pike and panfish species.  Other species sampled during the survey included: black bullhead, brown bullhead, carp, green sunfish, golden shiner, hybrid sunfish, pumpkinseed sunfish and yellow bullhead.</p>",

The Northern Pike population is average compared to the rest of the state, but their growth rate is below normal.  The Common Carp population is also about equal to statewide values and has not been a problem in the lake.  Overall, Northern Pike & Bluegill are the most desirable fish from an angling standpoint. </p>",

The Black Crappie catch rate, 8.0 per trap net, was nearly equal to the average of 8.6 fish per trap net. Black Crappie 7.0 inches and larger comprised 58% of the total. Yellow Bullhead were the most numerous species sampled. Both trap and gill net catches were above average for similar lakes. Yellow Bullhead ranged in length from 8.5 to 13.9 inches.</p>",

The lake has a maximum depth of 26 feet with an average summer water clarity of three feet. A public access maintained by the Winsted Sportsman's Club is located on the northeast side of the lake. The access has limited parking along the road for three vehicle/trailer combos. A standard survey was conducted in 2022 to update fisheries data last collected in 2006. <br> \n <br> \nThe highlight for Ida Lake is its Largemouth Bass fishery. Bass are abundant in the lake and can provide some fun fishing action. Although the average size of bass is just under 11 inches, there are opportunities to catch fish up to 19 inches. Much of the lake's perimeter provides good bass fishing along the water lily fringe. Other fish species in the lake are on the smaller side. Anglers looking for constant action could take advantage of the lake's sunfish populations. Bluegill abundance is high, but most are in the five and six-inch range. No Bluegill over seven inches were observed during this survey. Black Crappie are present in low numbers. Those observed ranged in length from five to nine inches. Northern Pike are present in modest numbers and ranged in length from 13 to 28 inches with an average length and weight of 24 inches and 2.5 pounds. Other species sampled during the survey include Brown Bullhead, Common Carp, Golden Shiner, Hybrid Sunfish, Pumpkinseed, and Yellow Bullhead.  <br> \n</p>",
