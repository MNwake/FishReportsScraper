                "narrative": "<p>Upper Sucker Lake is 120-acre lake located east of Cass Lake, Minnesota that has 3.8 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 25 feet.  There is a US Forest Service owned earthen boat ramp in the channel between Middle Sucker and Upper Sucker Lakes.  The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MNDNR) has classified Minnesota lakes into 43 different classes based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics.  Upper Sucker Lake is in Lake Class 28; lakes in the class are small, clear and regularly (bowl shape) shaped lakes.  The lake is primarily managed for northern pike and black crappie and secondarily for bluegill and largemouth bass.  Northern pike are present in Upper Sucker Lake.  The mean length was 20 inches and fish up to 26 inches were sampled.  Few black crappie were sampled; however, fish up to 11 inches are present.  Historically, partial winterkills have occurred on Upper Sucker Lake, it is believe that one has occurred since 1995, which is evident by the abundance of black bullhead sampled in 2000 and 2005.Other fish species that available for anglers to catch are black bullhead, bluegill, bowfin (dogfish), brown bullhead, hybrid sunfish, pumpkinseed sunfish, yellow bullhead, and yellow perch.Anglers can help maintain or improve the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for table fare, but encourages release of medium- to large-sized fish.  Releasing these fish can help maintain balance in the fish community in Upper Sucker Lake and provide anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Upper Sucker Lake is 120-acre lake is located approximately nine miles east of Cass Lake, Minnesota. The lake has 3.8 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 25 feet.  There is a US Forest Service owned earthen boat access on the channel between Middle Sucker and Upper Sucker lakes. The access is suitable for small boats, canoes, and kayaks due to the shallow water and limited maneuvering area at the launch.  Parking space is also limited. The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MNDNR) has classified Minnesota lakes into 43 different classes based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics.  Upper Sucker Lake is in Lake Class 28; lakes in the class are small, clear and regularly (bowl shape) shaped lakes.  Other Walker Area Lake Class 28 lakes include Kerr (DOW# 11-0268), Cedar (DOW# 11-0289), Johnson (DOW# 11-0363), and Rat (DOW# 11-0285). The entire shoreline of Upper Sucker Lake is undeveloped and publicly owned by the US Forest Service and the State of Minnesota.  Boating, fishing, and wildlife viewing on this lake are similar to a wilderness experience. Historically, partial winterkills occasionally occur on Upper Sucker Lake, but game fish populations recover to healthy levels during extended periods during which winterkills do not occur.  No aquatic invasive species have been documented in Upper Sucker Lake. Angling for northern pike, bluegill, and black crappie can be quite productive on Upper Sucker Lake. Northern pike were abundant and averaged 21 inches in length with fish over 36 inches long in the sample. Bluegills numbers were low compared to other Lake Class 28 lakes, but 18 percent of the bluegills in the sample were 8 inches or longer.  Black crappies averaged 8 inches in length and fish over 12 inches in length were present. Other fish species that available for anglers to catch are black bullhead, bluegill, bowfin (dogfish), brown bullhead, hybrid sunfish, pumpkinseed sunfish, yellow bullhead, and yellow perch. <br> \nPeople can have significant impacts on lakes and the fish populations they support.  Selective harvest by anglers (harvest of smaller to medium-sized fish) promotes balanced fish communities and sustainable fishing quality.  Removal of shoreline vegetation on private lake lots and mowing grass to the water's edge can reduce water quality, which in turn can adversely affect fish populations.  Similarly, removal of woody debris and aquatic plants from near-shore areas reduces critical habitat needed to support quality fish populations.  Finally, aquatic invasive species (AIS) can adversely impact lakes and fish populations.  These species are primarily moved from infested to non-infested waters by anglers, boaters, and lake-shore owners.  To avoid spreading AIS, lake users should inspect and remove any aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat away before leaving the access.  If you suspect an infestation of an invasive species in this lake, save a specimen and report it to a local natural resource office.  Additional information on all of these topics can be found on the DNR website (www.dnr.state.mn.us/). <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Upper Sucker Lake is 113-acre lake is located approximately nine miles east of Cass Lake, Minnesota. The lake has 4.2 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 25 feet.  There is a US Forest Service owned earthen boat access on the channel between Middle Sucker and Upper Sucker lakes. The access is suitable for small boats, canoes, and kayaks due to the shallow water and limited maneuvering area at the launch.  Parking space is also limited. The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MNDNR) has classified Minnesota lakes into 43 different classes based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics.  Upper Sucker Lake is in Lake Class 28; lakes in the class are small, clear and regularly (bowl shape) shaped lakes.  Other Walker Area Lake Class 28 lakes include Kerr (DOW# 11-0268), Cedar (DOW# 11-0289), Johnson (DOW# 11-0363), and Rat (DOW# 11-0285). The entire shoreline of Upper Sucker Lake is undeveloped and publicly owned by the US Forest Service and the State of Minnesota.   <br> \n <br> \nBoating, fishing, and wildlife viewing on this lake are similar to a wilderness experience. Historically, partial winterkills occasionally occur on Upper Sucker Lake, but game fish populations recover to healthy levels during extended periods during which winterkills do not occur.  No aquatic invasive species have been documented in Upper Sucker Lake. Angling for Northern Pike, Bluegill, and Black Crappie can be quite productive on Upper Sucker Lake. Northern Pike were abundant and averaged 19 inches in length with fish over 32 inches long in the sample. Bluegills numbers were low compared to other Lake Class 28 lakes, but 49 percent of the Bluegills in the sample were 8 inches or longer. Black Crappie averaged 9 inches in length and fish over 12 inches in length were present. Only two Largemouth Bass were sampled and both fish were 18 inches long. Other fish species available for anglers to catch are Black Bullhead, Bowfin (Dogfish), Brown Bullhead, Hybrid Sunfish, Pumpkinseed Sunfish, Yellow Bullhead, and Yellow Perch. <br> \n <br> \nPeople can have significant impacts on lakes and the fish populations they support. Harvest, lakeshore development, removal of shoreline vegetation, and introductions of invasive species can all adversely affect fish populations. Currently no aquatic invasive species (AIS) have been identified in Upper Sucker Lake. AIS are moved from infested to non-infested waters by anglers, boaters, and lake shore owners and can adversely impact lakes and fish populations. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access. If you suspect an infestation of an invasive species in this lake, save a specimen and report it to a local natural resource office. Additional information on all of these topics can be found on the DNR website (www.dnr.state.mn.us) or by contacting the Walker Area Fisheries office. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Upper Sucker Lake is 113-acre lake is located approximately nine miles east of Cass Lake, Minnesota. The lake has 4.2 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 25 feet.  There is a US Forest Service owned earthen boat access on the channel between Middle Sucker and Upper Sucker lakes. The access is suitable for small boats, canoes, and kayaks due to the shallow water and limited maneuvering area at the launch.  Parking space is also limited. The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MNDNR) has classified Minnesota lakes into 43 different classes based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics.  Upper Sucker Lake is in Lake Class 28; lakes in the class are small, clear and regularly (bowl shape) shaped lakes.  Other Walker Area Lake Class 28 lakes include Kerr (DOW# 11-0268), Cedar (DOW# 11-0289), Johnson (DOW# 11-0363), and Rat (DOW# 11-0285). Upper, Middle, and Lower Sucker (DOW # 11-0313) lakes are connected by a small stream channel and these lakes are connected to Leech Lake (DOW# 11-0203) through Sucker Creek (Kittle # M-146-010). This connectivity allows fish migration among the lakes and facilitates recovery of fish communities from occasional winter kills.  The entire shoreline of Upper Sucker Lake is undeveloped and publicly owned by the US Forest Service and the State of Minnesota. <br> \n <br> \nBoating, fishing, and wildlife viewing on this lake are similar to a wilderness experience. Historically, partial winterkills occasionally occurred on Upper Sucker Lake, but game fish populations recover to healthy levels during extended periods during which winterkills do not occur.  No aquatic invasive species have been documented in Upper Sucker Lake. Angling for Northern Pike, Bluegill, and Black Crappie can be quite productive on Upper Sucker Lake. Northern Pike were abundant and averaged 19 inches in length with fish over 26 inches long in the sample. Bluegills numbers were low compared to other Lake Class 28 lakes, but the lake is known for Bluegills 8 inches or longer. Black Crappie were small, averaging 7 inches in length yet fish over 10 inches in length were present. Most of the Black Crappie in the sample were two years old and will be reaching 10 inches in length by the 2023 season. No Largemouth Bass were sampled. Other fish species available for anglers to catch are Black Bullhead, Bowfin (Dogfish), Brown Bullhead, Hybrid Sunfish, Pumpkinseed, Yellow Bullhead, and Yellow Perch. <br> \n <br> \nPeople can have significant impacts on lakes and the fish populations they support. Harvest, lakeshore development, removal of shoreline vegetation, and introductions of invasive species can all adversely affect fish populations. Currently no aquatic invasive species (AIS) have been identified in Upper Sucker Lake. AIS are moved from infested to non-infested waters by anglers, boaters, and lake shore owners and can adversely impact lakes and fish populations. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access. If you suspect an infestation of an invasive species in this lake, save a specimen and report it to a local natural resource office. Additional information on all of these topics can be found on the DNR website (www.dnr.state.mn.us) or by contacting the Walker Area Fisheries office. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Upper Sucker Lake is a 120-acre lake with a maximum depth of 25 feet.  It is located eight miles east of Cass Lake in northern Cass County. Based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics, the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types.  Upper Sucker Lake is in Lake Class 28.  Other area lakes in this same class include; Alice (located five miles south of Walker), Anoway (located four miles south of Walker), Johnson (located three miles east of Backus), and Kerr (located six and ? miles east of Hackensack) Lakes.  There is a user-developed access on public land between Upper and Lower Sucker Lakes.   Upper Sucker is attached to both Middle and Lower Sucker Lakes.  Fish can migrate up from Leech Lake by way of the Sucker River.Test netting indicated an abundant northern pike population in Upper Sucker,  more abundant than what is typically found in a class 28 lake.  Sampled northern pike ranged in length from 9.1-30.9 inches and had an average size of 19 inches.  There were many year classes of fish indicated good natural reproduction.  Sampled Bluegill were of excellent size with 37 percent of the sample seven inches or larger.  Age and growth analysis indicated good growth.  Six inch bluegill were four years old on average.  Typically a six inch bluegill would be five or six years old in other area lakes.The primary food for large predator fish was yellow perch.  They were more abundant than what is found in other class 28 lakes.  Yellow perch ranged in length from 4 to 10 inches.  Anglers would find some of the yellow perch big enough to keep.Other fish sampled include bowfin, black bullhead, brown bullhead, yellow bullhead, and pumpkinseed, largemouth bass and black crappie.To help maintain quality fish populations in Upper Sucker Lake, lake users should safeguard aquatic habitat by preserving or reestablishing aquatic plants and natural shorelines.  Aquatic and terrestrial plants provide food and cover for fish and wildlife. They also help protect shorelines from erosion and absorb nutrients and pollutants.  Natural shorelines, shorelines that have not been altered by man, help protect a lake from silt-laden runoff waters They also provide excellent places for wildlife to feed, hide, and raise their young. Protection of the Upper Sucker Lake watershed is also needed for maintaining water quality.Anglers can help maintain or improve the quality of fishing by practicing catch and release of medium to large-sized fish. Releasing these fish will help maintain the fish population in Upper Sucker Lake and provides anglers with more opportunities to catch more large fish in the future.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Upper Sucker Lake has an area of 120 acres and a maximum depth of 25 feet.  About one-thirds of Upper Sucker Lake is 15 feet or less in depth.  Upper Sucker Lake is located about seven miles east of Cass Lake, MN.  The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MN DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different lake classes based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics.  Upper Sucker Lake is in lake class 28.  Lakes in this class generally have hard water, and are small and very clear.  There is a user-developed access on public land along the west side of the navigable channel connecting Upper Sucker and Middle Sucker Lakes. The access is located on USFS Road 2930 south of US Highway 2.  Sucker Creek runs from Middle Sucker Lake to Lower Sucker Lake, and then to Leech Lake.  The shoreline of Upper Sucker Lake is forested, and most of it is publicly owned by the US Forest Service or the State of Minnesota.      Due to abundant snowfall, Middle Sucker Lake experienced a partial winterkill during the winter of 1995-96, and it appears that Upper Sucker may also have had a partial kill the same winter.  Northern pike abundance was similar to other lakes in lake class 28 though most were small.  Northern pike survive winterkill better than most fish species.  Bluegill abundance is down; most of the bluegill were young (two years old) and small (less than 5 inches).  The bluegill fishery should recover in two or three years.  Yellow perch were abundant and good numbers of 8- to 11-inch fish were present.  A few black crappie, all around 8 inches,  were sampled in DNR test nets in 2000.  Though largemouth bass were reported in the 1990 survey, none were found during 2000 test netting.  Other species sampled in 2000 included pumpkinseed sunfish, black bullhead, yellow bullhead, brown bullhead, bowfin, and hybrid sunfish.       Anglers who fish on Upper Sucker Lake can help protect fish and wildlife natural habitat on this lake by avoiding wild rice beds, especially during late spring and early summer.  Boating or casting through rice beds during the sensitive floating-leaf stage can destroy plants and greatly reduce the harvest come fall.      Anglers can help maintain or improve the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for table fare, but encourages release of medium- to large-size fish.  Releasing these fish can help maintain balance in the fish community in Upper Sucker Lake and provide anglers with opportunities to catch more and larger fish in the future.</p>",
