Bemidji area lakes in this class include; Elk, Grant, North Twin, Buck, Swenson, Sandy (near Debs), Long (trout management lake), and Upper Lasalle. There are about 115 lakes of this class distributed throughout northern Minnesota.  They are typically very deep, hard water lakes with good water clarity and have a low percentage of littoral area (area less than 15 feet deep).     Walleye fingerlings have been stocked every third year since 1981 and most walleye sampled came from these stocks.  The largest walleye sampled in 1995 was 22 inches in length, but the average was 14.5 inches and weighed 1.2 pounds.   Abundance is near average, for this lake class.     Northern pike abundance has continued to increase, and is presently about three times that of comparable lakes, though the weight is average at 2.5 pounds.  The largest northern pike sampled was 34 inches, with the average near 21 inches.     Muskellunge have not been stocked since 1977 and there are no plans to resume muskellunge stocking.  Local angler reports suggest a few muskellunge may remain in the lake, either from the original stocks or reproduction.      Largemouth bass were sampled at near average abundance, for this lake class, though the average size sampled may be too small to be attractive to anglers.  The largest bass sampled was 14.5 inches, with an average of 9.5 inches.      Black crappie are present, though netting results suggest that the population may be declining.  Average size of crappie sampled was about 9 inches, and the abundance has fallen below average for this lake class.     Bluegill are the dominant panfish species, with an average size of about 6.2 inches, and an average weight of 0.2 pounds.  Abundance is well above the class average.  Rock bass are also abundant, with an average length of about seven inches, and about one-forth pound.  Pumpkinseed averaged six inches in length and weighed about one-sixth pound.  Pumpkinseed abundance is low by class comparison.     Yellow perch were sampled at the lowest recorded level, though they still about double the class average.  Perch averaged about 8 inches in length, and weighed about one-fifth pound.     White suckers, an excellent forage source for the northern pike population were sampled at 2.3/GN, the lowest abundance since 1956.</p>",

The source of pike is still unknown but they appear to be effectively using bullrush beds to successfully spawn based on the amount of small fish observed by anglers.

                "narrative": "<p>South Twin Lake is about 9 miles east of the village of Turtle River.  The public access has a concrete ramp and parking space for about 4 fishing rigs.  Primary management species are largemouth bass and panfish, and secondary management species are northern pike and walleye.The panfish community is composed of bluegill, pumpkinseed sunfish, black crappie, rock bass, and yellow perch.  Bluegill are by far the most common of the panfish species.  The 2000 assessment captured them at an average abundance and size for this lake type.  Abundance has generally declined since the 1981 assessment, but average weight has remained stable.  Average length of bluegill in the 2000 assessment was 6.1 inches, and the largest measured was 9.4 inches.  Black crappie were abundant in the 1981 assessment and provided an excellent fishery for a number of years.  By 1995, the population had declined to a low level and it has remained low since then.  Rock bass were sampled at above the normal range in both abundance and weight.  Yellow perch are abundant, but not as abundant as in the late 1960's before the pike population became dominant.  The average length of perch sampled was 6.8 inches with about 8% more than 8 inches long.Largemouth bass catch rate in nets was low, but our nets sample bass with varying degrees of efficiency.  Day time electrofishing was initiated in 2000 as an alternate method of assessing the bass population.  Sixty-three bass were captured in about 2 hours of electrofishing.  Average length of the sample was 10.3 inches and the maximum length was 17.4 inches.Northern pike catch rate was about half that recorded in the 1995 survey but still nearly double the average for this lake type.  Northern pike were not present prior to introduction in 1963.  The average length of 84 pike measured in 2000 was 19.8 inches and the maximum length was 33.2 inches.Walleye fingerlings are scheduled for stocking on a three-year rotation.  The 1999 fingerling quota was not available so fish were also stocked in the fall of 2000.  The 2000 assessment captured walleye at a rate higher than average for this lake type, and at a rate higher than in any assessment since 1973.  Average size was 1.4 pounds in the 2000 assessment.White suckers were sampled at the lowest catch rate on record, possibly due to the continuously high population of northern pike.  Pumpkinseed sunfish and brown bullheads were also sampled in low numbers.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>South Twin Lake (D.O.W. # 04-0053-00) is a 222-acre lake with a maximum depth of 45 feet located within the Chippewa National Forest about 20 miles northeast of Bemidji in Beltrami County.  There is a Forest Service public water access with limited parking located on the southeast end of the lake off of Turtle River Lake Road.  South Twin Lake is managed for Bluegill, Black Crappie, Largemouth Bass, Northern Pike and Walleye.  South Twin Lake has a special regulation for Largemouth Bass (catch and release only) while statewide regulations apply to all other species.   <br> \n <br> \nThe Minnesota Department of Natural Resources has classified Minnesota lakes based on similarities in lake basin (depth, size) and water chemistry (alkalinity, water clarity).  South Twin Lake is in lake class 23.  The following discussion makes comparisons between South Twin Lake and other class 23 lakes in the state.  Other Bemidji area lakes in this class include Elk, Grant, and North Twin.  <br> \n <br> \nThe 2016 Bluegill catch rate was 15.44/trap net.  Bluegill had a very good average size (7.46 inches in length and 0.39 lbs/fish) and a good proportion of the Bluegill catch exceeded 8 inches in length.   <br> \n <br> \nThe Black Crappie catch rate of 1.22/trap net.  The average size of 9.65 inches in length and 0.53 lbs/fish was larger than the average size of Black Crappie captured in surveys on similar lakes.   <br> \n <br> \nAn electrofishing survey targeting Largemouth Bass was conducted as part of the 2016 survey.  The catch rate of 68.90 bass/hour was high for the Bemidji area and shows an abundant Largemouth Bass population.  The average size of bass captured was 11.69 inches in length and 1 lb/fish, with bass up to 17.72 inches in length captured. <br> \n <br> \nThe Northern Pike catch rate was 8.83/gill net. Pike had average size of 20.69 inches and 2.32 lbs/fish.  The largest pike captured in 2016 measured 34.45 inches in length.  <br> \n  <br> \nThe Walleye catch rate of 2.50/gill net was similar to the median catch rate for similar lakes (2.37/gill net).  Walleye had a respectable average size of 19.11 inches in length and 2.57 lbs/fish. <br> \n <br> \nOther species of fish captured in the 2016 assessment were Pumpkinseed, Rock Bass, Hybrid Sunfish, Yellow Perch, White Sucker and Bullhead species.   <br> \n</p>",
