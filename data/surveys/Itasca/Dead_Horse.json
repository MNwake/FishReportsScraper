                "narrative": "<p>Dead Horse Lake is a small, undeveloped lake located four miles southwest of Marcell, MN.  The lake has a carry-in public access.  The lake has maintained good bluegill, largemouth bass, and northern pike populations for many years. The lake management plan indicates walleye and northern pike as the primary species of management with bluegill and largemouth bass as secondary species.  The management plan is in the process of revision at the writing of this report.Due to the size of the lake and perceived low fishing pressure, walleye stocking was discontinued after 1993 to see if the population could be maintained naturally.  In 1999, three walleye were sampled of which one was produced naturally.  It appears the walleye population can not be maintained through natural reproduction alone.  The new management plan will address a stocking regime to produce walleye population that will add an occasional bonus species to anglers catch.  In a bass/panfish lake like Dead Horse, walleye will never be a dominant species due to a lack of spawning habitat and other fish community interactions.Northern pike numbers have fluctuated greatly over the years.  The population in 1999 was higher than most lakes similar to Dead Horse.  Fish ranged from 17 to 27 inches and averaged roughly 22 inches.  The lake would be characterized as an action lake for anglers with a chance of catching a few fish pushing 30 inches.Bluegill are probably the species that would provide the most consistent fishing on Dead Horse.   Although bluegill numbers have varied they have remained good for the last 12 years.  In 1999, fish from 3 to 8 inches were sampled and the average length was 6.2 inches.  These fish generally reach 6 inches after seven years of growth.  Dead Horse Lake would be a good lake to keep a kid's interest and find some nice size fish as well.The largemouth bass population appears to be doing well.   Moderate numbers of fish were present in 1999, with fish ranging from 5 to 18 inches.  Nearly 45% of the sample were 14 inches or longer.  Fish averaged 14 inches in five years of growth.   To promote and maintain healthy fish populations, healthy habitat is necesary.  Fish habitat is directly affected by water quality.  Nutrients, sediments and other waste can drastically alter the chemical and physical characteristics of a lake.  People often associate water quality problems in a lake with agricultural or industrial practices within the watershed.  Although these point sources can be areas of concern, nonpoint sources are equally important.  Maintaining natural shoreline habitat and using Best Management Practices throughout the watershed will help insure good water quality and habitat and a healthy fishery to be enjoyed by future generataions.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Dead Horse Lake is located about 5 miles south of Marcell, MN, within the Chippewa National Forest, and within the Big Fork River Watershed.  The 96 acre lake has 54 littoral acres with a 30 foot max depth, and is relatively undeveloped.  Diverse aquatic plant life can be found along the 1.9 mile shoreline.  The public access on the north side of the lake has been converted to a carry-in access since the 1999 assessment, with large boulders blocking trailer access. <br> \n <br> \nSimilar to the previous assessment, northern pike were sampled within the expected range for lakes similar to Dead Horse.  A quality pike fishery exists indicated by an average gill net sampled length of almost 25 inches.  Lengths ranged from 17-37 inches.  Scale analysis indicated that six ages were sampled with fish up to age-7 in the sample.  Back calculated length-at-age indicated growth exceeded the statewide average for all ages.  Northern pike averaged 23 inches by age-3. <br> \n <br> \nGill netting sampled four walleye, similar to the previous assessment.  One was sampled in a trap net.  Lengths ranged from 15.2-16.5 inches.  Typically in lakes similar to Dead Horse, walleye are a bonus fishery and are maintained through stocking.  Scale analysis indicated these fish were age-3 and likely stocked as fingerlings in the fall of 2006.  Back calculated length-at-age indicated growth exceeded the statewide average. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill were the most abundant species sampled in both gill nets and trap nets.  The trap net catch rate was within the expected range; however it was noticeably less than the previous assessment.  The gill net catch rate was greater than the previous assessment.  The difference in catches between assessments may be a function of a cold front moving fish into deeper water at the time of the assessment.  Size structure appeared moderate with lengths ranging from 3.3-9.7 inches.  The average length sampled in gill nets was 6.9 inches, while the average length sampled in trap nets was 5.7 inches.  Within the trap net sample, eight age classes were identified through scale analysis with fish up to age-11 present.  Back calculated length-at-age indicated growth was similar to the lake class 29 average.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie were sampled in gill nets near the upper end of the expected range, while the trap net sample was within the expected range.  Size structure was poor for both gill net and trap net sampled fish with only two fish being sampled over six inches.  The gill net sample had lengths ranging from 4.9-9.3 inches with an average length of 5.6 inches, while the trap net sample had lengths ranging from 4.9-9.1 inches with an average length of 5.5 inches.  This was the first time black crappie were sampled since 1981, in which one was sampled in a trap net.  Ageing structures were not collected during this assessment, making age or growth only speculative; however these crappie may be young and hadn't reached a larger size at the time of this assessment. <br> \n <br> \nBoth gears sampled largemouth bass within the lake class expected range, but this may not accurately represent the population due to net avoidance, typical of bass.  Lengths ranged up to almost 17 inches.  Four yellow perch were sampled in gill nets (1.0/net), below the expected range and considerably lower than the 1999 assessment (34/gill net).  Lengths ranged from 6.1-9.9 inches.  Other species sampled included golden shiner, pumpkinseed sunfish, and rock bass. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Dead Horse Lake is located about four miles southwest of Marcel, MN in the Bigfork River watershed.  Dead Horse has a total surface area of 97 acres, a littoral area of 54 acres (56%), and a maximum depth of 30 feet.  There is no connectivity to facilitate fish passage.  The small outlet drains to a wetland which the 2009 assessment noted a beaver dam has blocked and has likely increased the lake level about a foot.  Residential development is low, mainly along the southwest shore.  There is a U.S. Forest Service administered carry-in access on the north side with limited parking availability.   <br> \n <br> \nLocal residents reported poor fishing and suspected a winterkill had occurred.  A special assessment using one gill net and three trap nets was conducted to evaluate the fish community. <br> \n <br> \nGill net sampling captured four Bluegill and 21 Northern Pike.  The Northern Pike ranged in length from 16.5 to 26.4 inches and averaged 20.1 inches.  Age analysis identified multiple year classes (age 2-6) and growth was near the statewide average as pike averaged 25 inches by age 5. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill were the most common fish in the trap net sample and the catch of 19.7 per trap net was within the expected range for the lake class.  Size structure was moderate as Bluegill ranged from 3.1 to 9.4 inches and averaged 5.6 inches.  Eight year classes were present (age 2-9).  Growth was fast compared to the lake class average as Bluegill averaged 5.8 inches by age 5 and exceeded 8 inches by age 8. <br> \n <br> \nOther species captured included Black Crappie, Largemouth Bass, Pumpkinseed Sunfish, Rock Bass, and Yellow Perch.  The fish community assemblages, along with length and age structures, do not suggest a recent winterkill.  The current fish community should provide good angling opportunities. <br> \n</p>",

The catch in this assessment was 3.0/gill net and the fish in the sample had an average weight of 2.5 pounds.     Bluegill abundance is very high and the population is dominated by small slow growing fish.       Northern pike numbers have been decreasing in the past years but are now at 5.0/trap net and are of quality size.  The average weight was 3.8 pounds in this assessment.     A 1978 winterkill has impacted the fish population causing wide fluctuations in species abundance.</p>",
