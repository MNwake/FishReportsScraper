                "narrative": "<p>In 2008 lake trout abundance in West Bearskin Lake was high compared to other lake trout lakes in the area, although it appeared to have been about average for the lake itself.  The lake trout population was entirely self-sustained.  Lake trout have been stocked regularly since 1970; however, all lake trout stocked since 1970 have been fin clipped, and no fin-clipped fish were included in the 2008 catch.  Lake trout growth had been fairly fast due to the presence of large numbers of rainbow smelt, which provided excellent forage. <br> \n <br> \nWest Bearskin Lake supported average numbers of smallmouth bass in 2008 compared to other lakes in the area, and compared to historic catches seen in this lake.  Most of the smallmouth bass collected were 10 to 12 inches in length, but some larger fish were present as well.  Growth rates for bass had been average for the area. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill have been found occassionally in West Bearskin Lake, but they have not been abundant.  The 2008 catch was the highest catch observed to date in this lake, but bluegill abundance may still have been too low to support a satisfactory fishery.  Most of the bluegill taken in 2008 were small, under six inches in length. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike have rarely been found in West Bearskin Lake.  The 2008 catch of two fish was actually one of the higher catches seen in this lake, where very little spawning habitat is available for the species.  West Bearskin Lake does not support a significant walleye population - since 1970 the species has rarely been taken in assessments. <br> \n  <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

Average size of lake trout collected in 2002 was excellent.  Most of the lake trout collected in 2002 appeared to have been produced naturally.  Only two of the 24 fish taken bore fin clips identifying them as stocked fish, and all lake trout stocked since 1970 in this lake have been fin clipped.  Lake trout growth rates had been fast, probably because of the excellent forage base provided by a relatively dense rainbow smelt population.Smallmouth bass abundance appeared to have been about average for a lake of this type; however, the average size of the fish collected in 2002 was above average.  Smallmouth bass growth rates had been relatively slow.Bluegill and northern pike were present in 2002, but apparently not in very high numbers.  Most of the bluegill collected were small fish, two or three years of age.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>West Bearskin Lake is a 509-acre lake located 23 miles northwest of Grand Marais with a public access boat launch on the east shore of the lake and carry-in portage landing along the south shore. Primary and secondary management species in West Bearskin Lake are lake trout and smallmouth bass. The 2023 standard lake survey was conducted to monitor the fish community in West Bearskin, record current limnological conditions, and evaluate management goals for lake trout and smallmouth bass populations. <br> \n <br> \nLake trout abundance was slightly below average but within the normal range West Bearskin Lake. Catch rates continued to meet management goals. Lake trout ranged from 11.7 to 26.5 inches in length. Aging data obtained from captured lake trout indicated fish were from 7 different naturally reproduced year classes and up to 13 years old. No fish were found from the last stocking event in 2009. The 2023 survey results suggest that West Bearskin Lake continues to support a relatively healthy naturally reproducing lake trout population. Naturally reproducing lake trout populations are unique in Minnesota lakes, anglers targeting lake trout should consider catch and release practices with safe handling procedures.   <br> \n <br> \nSmallmouth bass abundance was high in West Bearskin Lake and above average for similar lakes in the area. Smallmouth bass management goals were met. Fish ranged from 5.9 to 17.4 inches with a mean length of 10.8 inches. West Bearskin Lake should provide good opportunities for anglers looking to target smallmouth bass in both quality and quantity.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike abundance was well above average for similar lakes and in the upper range for West Bearskin Lake. Northern pike captured in the survey ranged from 16.6 to 35.2 inches with a mean length of 23.1 inches. West Bearskin provides anglers the opportunity of catching memorable sized (> 34 inches) fish.  <br> \n <br> \nBluegill, green sunfish, and yellow perch relative abundances in trap nets were low and similar to historical values. However, yellow perch catch rates in gill net sets were high. None of these fish were found larger than 7 inches and would not be of interest to anglers. Rainbow smelt abundance was down from the previous two surveys, but comparable to historic catches. Smelt can provide forage for lake trout, but may also compete with young lake trout, and may prey directly on larval fish.  <br> \n <br> \nCook County, Minnesota lakes continue to be susceptible to aquatic invasive species introductions. Invasive species have the potential to significantly alter fish communities and overall lake health. Anglers should clean watercraft and fishing gear, drain all water, and dispose of unused bait in the trash to prevent accidental introductions.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake trout were abundant, and were present in a wide range of sizes, including fish as large as 30 inches.  Stocking accounted for slightly more than half of the fish collected, but there has also been significant natural reproduction.  Lake trout growth had been relatively fast, perhaps due to the presence of fairly high numbers of rainbow smelt, which provided excellent forage.Smallmouth bass were present in fair numbers, but most were less than 12 inches in length.  Smallmouth reproduction appeared to have been sporadic recently; some year classes were weak or missing.  No other gamefish were taken, which is not unusual for this lake.Readers should be aware that the gill net catches listed in the standard lake report for this lake in 1996 are for shallow gill net sets only, and do not include the catch in deep gill nets set to sample lake trout.  The combined catch in deep and shallow gill nets in 1996 was:Species\t\t\tNumber/net\tAverage weightGreen sunfish\t\t0.33\t\t0.18Lake trout\t\t5.44\t\t1.61Smallmouth bass\t\t0.78\t\t0.37White sucker\t\t0.33\t\t1.27Rainbow smelt\t\t0.78\t\t0.12</p>",

Stocking provided just under half the fish collected, the rest resulting from natural reproduction.  Lake trout growth rates slightly exceeded the average for Cook County.  Rainbow smelt were abundant, and provided excellent forage.Smallmouth bass were present but not common, although the 1999 year class appeared to be relatively abundant and may provide some angling in several years.As in past surveys, northern pike and yellow perch were present but rare.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>West Bearskin is a deep, cold-water Lake Trout lake that has been managed primarily for Lake Trout since at least 1928.  It was stocked regularly with Lake Trout (fry or fingerlings) from 1928 through 1970.  No stocking was done from 1971 through 1980, but it was again stocked regularly, with Lake Trout yearlings, from 1981 through 2009.  All Lake Trout stocked after 1970 were fin clipped so stocked fish could more easily be identified.  Lake Trout stocking was discontinued after 2009 due to poor survival of stocked fish and high levels of natural reproduction.  This was to have been the second of three surveys scheduled in the 2009 lake management plan to determine whether a resumption of Lake Trout stocking would be needed, and whether special or experimental regulations on the Lake Trout fishery might be necessary.  The first (in 2012) could not be completed due to a shortage of staff and funding. <br> \n <br> \nLake Trout were present in average numbers and above average sizes in 2016.  The Lake Trout catch (1.33 fish/net in deep and shallow sets combined) fell within the normal range for a lake of this type (0.85-4.25 fish/net), but fell short of the long range goal for this lake (1.50 fish/net) established in the 2009 plan.  Although the catch goal was not met in 2016, the size goal for Lake Trout (a mean weight of at least 1.5 lb/fish) was exceeded.  None of the Lake Trout taken in 2016 bore fin clips identifying them as stocked fish.  Although no strong year classes were identified, nine year classes contributed to the catch, indicating natural reproduction had been occurring fairly consistently.  Lake Trout as old as 17 years were collected, and most of the catch consisted of fish older than eight years, and likely to have been mature adults.  The presence of so many older fish suggested that low recruitment, rather than excessive harvest, was the reason for the low Lake Trout catch seen in 2016.  Lake Trout growth appeared to have been somewhat slower than average.  Fish reached an average length of 14.9 inches by the end of their sixth year, compared to an area mean of 16.2 inches. <br> \n <br> \nWest Bearskin Lake appeared to support good numbers of large Smallmouth Bass in 2016.  The gill net catch (deep and shallow combined; 1.22 fish/net) fell within the normal range (0.25-2.19 fish/net) for a lake of this type.  Most of the Smallmouth Bass collected in 2016 were over 14 inches in length, and the presence of some fish over 16 inches met the 2009 plan's goal for the species.  The catch consisted mostly of fish over eight years of age (up to 16 years), indicating harvest by anglers had probably been light.  Reproductive success appeared to have been limited in recent years, with no strong year classes identified.  Growth appeared to have been slow; fish reached a mean length of just 7.8 inches at the end of their fifth year, compared to an area average of 10.7 inches. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike numbers appear to have increased in West Bearskin Lake, and some larger fish were present in 2016.  Northern Pike had been rarely seen in this lake in the past, but a few were observed in a 2014 summer creel survey, and the gill net catch in 2016 (0.67 fish/net, deep and shallow sets combined) was the highest ever seen in this lake.  Several year classes, all naturally produced, contributed to the 2016 catch, although none had been exceptionally strong.  The largest fish collected was aged at 20 years, and several fish five or more years old were collected.  Northern Pike growth appeared to have been somewhat slower than average, at least at younger ages.  By the end of their third year fish reached a mean length of 17.7 inches, compared to an area average of 19.9 inches.  Low numbers of Yellow Perch in this lake may have contributed to the slow early growth of Northern Pike observed among fish sampled in 2016. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill became established in West Bearskin Lake fairly recently.  They were present in only modest numbers and small sizes in 2016, but offered some angling opportunity for those seeking panfish in this panfish-poor area. The 2016 trap net catch was similar to catches seen in 2002 and 2009, but the average size of fish taken in those nets appeared to have declined.   The catch consisted mainly of 4-6-inch fish from a strong 2012 year class.  Their growth had been slow. <br> \n <br> \nThe single Walleye taken in 2016 was the first seen in a survey of this lake since 1969.  Walleye can reach West Bearskin Lake from Hungry Jack Lake, where they are present in fair numbers.  Yellow Perch numbers have typically been low in this lake; the 2016 catch (1.33 fish/net, deep and shallow combined) was the highest seen to date.  White Sucker numbers have also been low historically.  Although none were sampled in any gear in 2016, a few were probably present nonetheless. <br> \n <br> \nRainbow Smelt apparently remained abundant in West Bearskin Lake in 2016, and fish taken were also fairly large, compared to those typically seen in other area lakes.  The Rainbow Smelt catch in small-mesh gill nets was well above the normal range (10.75-62.33 fish/net) for that gear when used in the Grand Marais area, and the mean weight for smelt sampled was well abvove average.  Smelt provide excellent forage for Lake Trout, Walleye, and Northern Pike, but they have also been implicated in Lake Trout and Walleye recruitment failures.  Rainbow Smelt have been present in West Bearskin Lake since about 1963.  Anglers looking for a meal of smelt could probably catch enough for a meal in this lake, particularly in the winter. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

It drains to Lake Superior via Duncan, Rose, and Arrow Lakes, the Arrow River (in Ontario), and the Pigeon River.  The only gamefish species native to the lake were northern pike and lake trout.  Primary and secondary management species in West Bearskin Lake are now lake trout and smallmouth bass.  Current long range goals for lake trout, from the 2009 lake management plan (LMP), are to maintain a minimum lake trout gill net catch (in deep and shallow sets combined) of 1.5 fish/set, with a minimum mean weight of 1.5 lb/fish.  The goal for smallmouth bass is to maintain a population providing some fish over 16 inches. <br> \n <br> \nThis was to have been the third of three standard surveys scheduled in the 2009 LMP to determine whether resumption of lake trout stocking was needed, and to determine whether there was a need for special regulations to preserve or imporove the quality of lake trout and smallmouth bass fisheries.  The first survey, scheduled for 2012,  was canceled due to fund and staffing cuts, but the second was completed as planned in 2016.  This survey was scheduled for 2020, but was moved up to 2019 so that results would be available for a planned March 2020 revision of the current LMP. <br> \n <br> \nGood numbers of lake trout were found in 2019, and the catch included some larger fish, as well as many smaller fish.  The 2019 lake trout gill net catch (deep and shallow sets combined) was well within the normal range for a Class 1 lake, met current management goals, and was similar to other catches seen in this lake since 2002.  The mean weight for lake trout taken in gill nets met the long range size goal for this lake as well.  Concerns about a lack of young fish in the 2016 survey catch were allayed in 2019 by the capture of good numbers of small young lake trout.  Seven year classes contributed to the 2019 catch, including fish up to 17 years of age.  None of the  22 lake trout sampled had been stocked; 19 had been produced naturally since the lake was last stocked (2009; 2008 year class), and no stocking fin clips were seen on the three older fish taken.  Lake trout growth had been somewhat faster than average; fish reached a mean length of 15.1 inches at the end of their fifth year, compared to an area mean of 14.4 inches.  Good growth, plus good long-term survival, allowed this lake to maintain a fairly high-quality lake trout population, with fish as large as 30 inches taken in 2019.  Good growth rates were no doubt fueled by the large numbers of rainbow smelt found in this lake. <br> \n <br> \nThe sampling gear used in the 2019 survey does not provide a very good indication of the true abundance of smallmouth bass; however, smallmouth bass gill and trap net catches in 2019 were low for this lake, and for a lake of this class.  The current management goal for the species was not met in 2019 since no fish over 16 inches were sampled.  Sample sizes for bass in all gears were low, but growth rates appeared to have been very slow.  Fish reached a mean length of just 6.2 inches at the end of their fifth year, compared to an area mean of 10.7 inches.  If those results were correct, survival of fish to a length of 16 inches would have been rare.  The largest fish taken in this survey (12.3 inches) was apparently ten years old. <br> \n <br> \nPrior to 1999 northern pike were rarely seen in West Bearskin Lake,  Since that time they have been found in every survey, although their numbers have not been high.  The 2019 gill net catch in deep and shallow sets combined (0.44 fish/set) was typical of catches seen since 1999, and fell within the normal range for a Class 1 lake. Of the six northern pike taken in all sampling gears in 2019, three were over 25 inches in length and one was over 30 inches.   Five year classes, none strong, contributed to the overall catch, which included fish as old as nine years. <br> \n <br> \nA few bluegill were still present in 2019, but the catch in 0.75-in-mesh trap nets was the lowest seen in this lake since 2002.  The catch included a couple fish over six inches in length.  Anglers seeking bluegill could probably catch some in this lake, but most would be small. <br> \n <br> \nRainbow smelt remained abundant in West Bearskin Lake in 2019.  The smelt catch in small-mesh gill nets exceeded the normal range for that gear in this area (10.8-62.3 fish/set) by a wide margin.  Rainbow smelt taken in 2019 seemed to have been smaller than those seen in many past surveys.  Smelt provide high-quality and abundant forage for lake trout, but also compete with young lake trout, and may prey directly on very young lake trout.  So far, in this lake, the balance seems to have favored lake trout. <br> \n <br> \n </p>",
