                "narrative": "<p>Mitchell Lake is a 270-acre lake with a maximum depth of 38 feet located three miles south and three miles west of Ely in northern St. Louis County.  There is no public access on the lake.  The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical and chemical characteristics.  Mitchell is in lake class 5.  Other area lakes in the same lake class include Armstrong, Eagles Nest Lakes, Low, and Wolf Lakes. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance (3.8 walleye/gillnet) fell within the range typically found in lake class 5 lakes.  Since no stocking occurs on the lake in recent times, all walleye captured in 2011 were the result of natural reproduction.  Walleye ranged in length from 18.8 inches to 26.8 inches with a mean length and weight of 21.3 inches and 3.4 pounds. <br> \n <br> \nMitchell Lake northern pike abundance (2.8 northern pike/gillnet) is typical of other class 5 lakes.  Pike sampled in 2011 ranged in length from 25 inches to 40 inches with a mean length and weight of 32.6 inches and 8.3 pounds.  This is the highest mean length of any assessment conducted on Mitchell Lake.  NOP age analysis identified ages 4 to 9 with no particularly strong year class. Growth rates were above average.   <br> \n <br> \nThe most likely forage fish available for these large northern pike and walleye is white sucker which had an abundance rating that was above average.  Yellow perch abundance was the lowest recorded over the past four assessments. <br> \n <br> \nIn 2011, eleven different fish species were sampled in the near-shore nets.  This compares to seven species captured in 1988.  Bluegill is a recent newcomer to Mitchell Lake and was sampled for the first time in 2011.  Bluegill were also the most abundant species sampled with an abundance rating that was well above what you would typically find in a class 5 lake.  Bluegill ranged in length from 3.6 inches to 8.1 inches with a mean length of 5.1 inches.  Bluegill growth was slow.  After four years of growth, a typical bluegill in Mitchell Lake is only 3.7 inches long. <br> \n <br> \nAnother member of the sunfish family that was sampled for the first time in 2011 was black crappie. Their abundance was typical of other lakes in the same lake class.  Crappie ranged in length from 4.3 inches to 12.4 inches with a mean length of 8.8 inches.  Other members of the sunfish family sampled in 2011 were green sunfish, pumpkinseed, rock bass, largemouth bass, and smallmouth bass. <br> \n</p>",
