                "narrative": "<p>Battle is a 323 acre, shallow and productive lake located in the southwest corner of Koochiching County.  The lake is three miles west of Northome, Minnesota.  Battle is characterized by moderately clear water, soft muck or organic substrates and abundant aquatic vegetation.  The fish community is relatively simple and apparently influenced by periodic winterkill events.Northern pike appear to be the primary predator species present in Battle Lake. The 2004 pike gillnet abundance (2.0/net) was low for lakes in the same class as Battle. The average individual weight (1.3 pounds) was also low.  Lengths of pike ranged from 16.1 to 21.2 inches and averaged 17.6 inches.  Growth of Battle Lake northern pike was about average for the International Falls Management Area. The yellow perch gillnet abundance (62.3/net) in Battle Lake was high. Most of the perch however, were small and young. Ninety-five percent of the perch sampled were less than 7.5 inches in length and 92% were one year olds.  Growth of yellow perch was above average for lakes in the International Falls Management Area. The only other species present in high numbers during this investigation were bullheads.  Although some large individuals (up to 11.9 inches) were present in Battle Lake, a large majority of the bullheads sampled were less than six inches in length.</p>",
