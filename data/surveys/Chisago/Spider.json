In order to compare the present fish population to others in this lake class and evaluate the recreational fishery, Spider Lake was surveyed May 22, 2018.    <br> \n <br> \nBoth Black Crappie and Bluegill numbers were typical of the lake class.  While a small portion of the Bluegill catch exceeded 7 inches, most didn't reach 5 inches.  But, more than a third of the Black Crappies caught in the trap nets were nine inches or longer.  The largest Bluegill sampled was 7.7 inches and the largest Black Crappie 11.1. <br> \n <br> \nBased on the gill net catch, Northern Pike were abundant compared to similar lakes.  Pike averaged 24.2 inches and 3.4 pounds with fish up to 34 inches present.   <br> \n <br> \nA moderate Black Bullhead population was present.  Although average length was small at just over 6.5 inches, one 13.7 inch bullhead was sampled.  Additionally, a few Golden Shiners and one Largemouth Bass just under 12 inches were also sampled.  Spider Lake's management plan was recently amended to include the occasional stocking of 122,000 Walleye fry, when they are available. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers targeting Northern Pike or Black Crappies on Spider should find fish acceptable in both size and abundance.   <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

TWO GILLNETS AND FOUR TRAPNETS WERE SET DURING THE SURVEY ALONG WITH SHORELINE SEINING EFFORTS. THE SHORELINE SEINING WAS PERFORMED IN LATE AUGUST TO EVALUATE NATURAL FISH REPRODUCTION. A TOTAL OF FOURTEEN BROWN BULLHEADS WERE CAUGHT DURING TEST NETTING. TWELVE WERE CAPTURED IN TRAPNETS AND TWO WERE CAUGHT IN GILLNETS. NO OTHER FISH WERE CAUGHT BY THESE SAMPLING METHODS. THE BROWN BULLHEAD TRAPNET CATCH WAS ABOVE THE LOCAL MEDIAN OF 1.23/SET, HOWEVER, THIS IS SIGNIFICANTLY BELOW THE NET CATCH FROM THE PREVIOUS SURVEY IN 1978 OF 177.83/SET. THE LENGTH FREQUENCY DISTRI- BUTION RANGED FROM 7.5 TO 9.4 INCHES WITH 8.0-8.4 INCHES BEING THE MEDIAN LENGTH GROUP. THE MEAN WEIGHT OF BROWN BULLHEADS WAS 0.23 POUNDS FOR THE CURRENT SURVEY COMPARED TO 0.18 POUNDS IN THE 1978 SURVEY. SHORELINE SEINING EFFORTS PRODUCED THIRTY-TWO YOUNG-OF-YEAR BLACK BULLHEADS AND SEVEN CENTRAL MUDMINNOWS.</p>",

Minnesota lakes  have been assigned classifications based on their physical, chemical and biological similarities.  Spider is assigned to lake class 42.  In order to compare the present fish population to others in this lake class and evaluate the recreational fishery, Spider Lake was surveyed during the summer of 2007.    <br> \n <br> \nWalleye were sampled above the 50th and 75th percentiles in the gillnets and trapnets respectively.  Mean weight was below the 50th percentile in both gear types.  Lengths ranged from 9.5 to 19.9 inches with a fairly even distribution.  Sampled walleye averaged 13.9 inches and 1 pound.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie and bluegill were both above the 75th percentile in the gillnets and trapnets respectively.  Both fell below the 50th percentile for mean weight.  While a small portion of the bluegill catch exceeded 7 inches none of the sampled crappies reached 8 inches. <br> \n <br> \nA moderate population of black bullheads was present.  A few golden shiners and one largemouth bass were also sampled. <br> \n <br> \nBased on the assessment netting results anglers targeting walleyes should find fish acceptable in both size and abundance.  Although panfish numbers are more than adequate, harvest minded anglers might want to look elsewhere for the time being.    <br> \n</p>",
