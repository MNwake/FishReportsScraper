                "narrative": "<p>Bass Lake is a typical central Minnesota bass-panfish lake, displaying somedesirable fish community characteristics. Walleye and northern pike populations areat normal levels for this type of lake.  The walleye sample was dominated by largerfish and appears to be maintained by fingerlings stocked every third year.  Allwalleye captured in the 1996 survey were between 18 and 26 inches in length. Northern pike in the lake were fast growing with 30% of the fish observed over 24inches in length.  Northern pike fishing has been reported to be good in recentyears.  Neascus, a small black grub, was prevalent on the northern pike. Largemouth bass are abundant, but slow growing.  Average size was 12 -13 inches,however, larger fish up to 17 inches were observed during spring electrofishing. Both bluegill and black crappie averaged 6 to 7 inches, which is good size forbluegills, but small for crappies.  One crappie over 12 inches was sampledindicating the presence of larger individuals.  The lake continues to maintain onlya low population of yellow perch, which are an important prey species for gamefish.Yellow, black, and brown bullheads are present in Bass Lake at normal populationlevels and most of the fish sampled exceeded ten inches in length.  Many carp wereobserved during spring electrofishing, but abundance is difficult to determine withlake survey gear.A public fishing pier is located at the north end of the lake near the publicaccess, providing an additional fishing opportunity for those without boats. Selective harvest is encouraged for both angling and spearing to minimize impacton the fish community.  Releasing larger northern pike and walleye and voluntarilylimiting harvest of large panfish will help sustain the quality and balance of thefish community.  Lakeshore homeowners and others in the watershed need to useproper management practices to maintain water quality and healthy fish habitat.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A summer trap net survey was conducted on Bass Lake on July 30-August 1, 2018 by Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program Staff.  Bluegill and Hybrid Sunfish comprised a majority of the trap net catch.  The number of Bluegill sampled per net was below the 50% quartile for similar Lake Class 31 lakes and the average length was 5.3 inches, with 15% over seven inches.  Conversely, the number of Largemouth bass sampled per net was above the 50% quartile for Lake Class 31 lakes. <br> \n <br> \nThe fish data collected in this trap net survey will be combined with data from a June 2015 gill net survey and July 2015 survey of nearshore fishes to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based IBI (FIBI) score.  The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment.  In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g. Pugnose Shiner and Least Darter), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g. Green Sunfish).  The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake.  For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.   <br> \n <br> \nThe fish community of Bass Lake is relatively diverse, containing at least 17 fish species including several that are intolerant of degraded conditions.  Data from the FIBI survey indicates Bass Lake is in exceptional health as indicated by an FIBI score above the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes.  Data from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Sauk River Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Bass Lake is a relatively small, clearwater bass-centrachid lake in Todd County.  The lake lies on the outskirts of the town of Grey Eagle and provides several recreational opportunities for the area.  A fishing pier, swimming beach, picnic area, and boat access are located together on the north side of the lake off of Highway 28.  Water clarity was excellent for a lake in this area of the state with a secchi disk reading of 13 feet.  The 2002 survey documented a change in Bass Lake's fish community which may have some undesired effects.    Northern pike abundance appears to be at a record high for the lake while yellow perch numbers continue to be low.  Walleye stocking was resumed in Bass Lake in 1999 at the request of anglers.  A higher perch population is desirable to provide a prey base for both the northern pike and walleye.  Having perch available also reduces predation on the walleye fingerlings by the northern pike.  Most of the northern pike seen in the survey were between 17 and 20 inches in length, too small by most angler's standards.  Some larger pike more than 24 inches in length were seen along with one individual up to 31 inches long.    The walleye fishery seems to be dependent on stocking which was resumed in 1999 at the request of anglers.  All of the walleye seen in the 2002 survey were between 14 and 19 inches in length.  Northern pike abundance needs to drop and yellow perch increase if walleye stocking is to succeed.  Anglers will find no shortage of largemouth bass.  There appears to be an abundance of small bass under 12 inches, but some bigger fish up to 17 inches were documented.  Bluegills are also abundant and the population dominated by medium size fish from 5 to 7 inches in length.  Perch have been found to be instrumental in helping maintain a well balanced bluegill population with fast growing, quality individuals.    Pumpkinseeds, another species of sunfish, are abundant and small.  Most of the pumpkinseeds seen in the survey were under 6 inches in length.  All three species of bullheads were sampled in the survey.  While most of the bullheads would be considered small by angler's standards, some individuals up to 13 inches were measured.  Bowfin or dogfish along with green fish and hybrid sunfish were the other species sampled in the survey.      Neascus or black spot was common on bluegills, northern pike, and yellow perch which may make them undesirable to fishermen.  Neascus is a trematode or parasite that is usually found in the skin of the fish.  The life cycle of the parasite also includes snails and fish-eating birds, such as herons and bitterns.  Skinning the fish removes most of the parasites and cooking will kill the rest.  Humans cannot be infected.     Bass Lake appears to have excellent water quality and landowners are encouraged to use good shoreline practices to protect the lake.  Anglers are encouraged to harvest small northern pike under 24 inches and release the larger pike along with limiting harvest of larger bluegills to work toward a more balanced fish community.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>     Bass Lake is a relatively small, clear-water bass-panfish lake in Todd County.  The lake lies on the outskirts of the City of Grey Eagle and provides a multitude of recreational opportunities for the area.  The City maintains a park on the north end of the lake, which offers a fishing pier, swimming beach, picnic area, and boat access.  The lake has some of the best water clarity in the area with a secchi disk reading of over 18 feet at the end of June.  Weed lines, woody debris, and sunken points are the main fishing structures in the lake.  Bass Lake has little development close to the lake, which probably benefitted the water quality.    <br> \n      Several species showed a significant change in abundance from the last survey in 2002.   While the 2008 summer survey showed a decrease in northern pike abundance, numbers are still high when compared to similar type lakes.   Walleye abundance appears to be within the normal range for this type of lake, yet yellow perch numbers remained low.  Lower northern pike numbers are desirable because of the negative affect they can have on the fish community especially yellow perch and walleye.  A more abundant perch population could provide a prey base for both walleye and northern pike, and may also reduce pike predation on walleye fingerlings.   The average size of the pike seen in the survey was 20 inches or just under 2 pounds, but there were some pike between 24 and 31 inches measured.    The walleye fishery is dependant on stocking which occurs in odd numbered years.        <br> \n       Bass Lake has a largemouth bass population, which attracts anglers.  There appears to be an abundance of smaller bass under 12 inches in length, however, some fish up to 17 inches were observed.  Bluegill are also quite common and the population appears to be dominated by medium size fish between 5 and 7 inches.  Although black crappie are in the lake, they can be a difficult species to sample in standard survey gear, but electrofishing has shown some promise as a sampling method for the species.   The average size of the crappies caught with survey gear was about 9 inches, but there were some measured up to almost 11 inches in length.  Other panfish species in the lake include green sunfish, hybrid sunfish, and pumpkinseed sunfish.  The hybrid sunfish catch yielded the largest fish with some individuals over 8 inches being measured.       <br> \n      Other species in the fish community include black bullhead, brown bullhead, bowfin or dogfish, and yellow bullhead.   Yellow bullhead was the most numerous of the three species and abundance was within the normal range for the lake type.  The brown bullhead were the largest in size of the three species with some of the individuals measuring up to 14.5 inches in length.  The abundance of black bullhead and yellow bullhead can be an indicator of water quality.  Black bullhead tend to be more abundant in turbid water while yellow bullhead prefer cleaner water.   <br> \n      Bass Lake appears to have excellent water quality and landowners are encouraged to use good shoreline practices around the lake and its inlets.  Anglers are encouraged to harvest small northern pike under 24 inches and release the larger pike along with limiting harvest of larger bluegills to work toward a more balanced fish community. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>This survey used gill nets, trap nets and electrofishing to obtain updated information on the population status of Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, Bluegill, Crappie, Walleye and Perch.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike abundance is higher than we'd like to see and the average size is small. About 70 percent of the gill net sample measured less than 20 inches. Good trolling for pike can be had however, and it shouldn't be too difficult to catch a limit of 10. We did catch one 33-inch fish so there are some larger pike present. A total of 72 Largemouth Bass were captured during the electrofishing-part of the survey. Average size was 9.2 inches and maximum length was 19.2 inches. Bluegill and Black Crappie were captured with targeted trap netting in early June. Bluegills are more abundant than crappies in Grey Eagle Bass. Bluegills are small for the most part, averaging 6.4 inches in length. A total of 27 crappies were caught when combining trap net, gill net and electrofishing captures. Average size was 9 inches, three of the 27 fish measured over 10 inches.  Walleyes are scarce in Grey Eagle Bass, we didn't catch a single one in any of our gear types. Gill nets caught a total of three in 2015. Fingerlings have been stocked in years past, most recently in 2019 but survival appears very poor and a desirable population has not been established. The Yellow Perch catch was the same as Walleye - nothing. Perch populations in many area lakes experience declines or shifts to smaller body-size (not vulnerable to gill nets) due to high pike populations. This could be what's happening in Grey Eagle Bass.    <br> \n <br> \nGrey Eagle Bass Lake is mostly undeveloped. Near-shore cattails and bulrush are common and water clarity was 15 feet, however there are times throughout the summer when algae blooms cast a green hue over the water's surface. There is a fishing pier next to the boat ramp on the north side of the lake. <br> \n</p>",

The assessment consisted of 29 survey sites evenly spaced 100 meters around the lake. Assessments were made in three habitat zones: Shoreline Zone(the shore-water interface to the top of the natural bank), Shoreland Zone (land-ward from shoreline to development structure or 100ft), and Aquatic Zone (lake-ward 50ft of shoreline). The average lakewide habitat score was 75.3(+/- 3.8) out of 100 possible. Approximately 55 percent of the sites were developed with a mean score of 63.0(+/- 4.7), while undeveloped sites had a mean score of 90.5(+/- 2.3).</p>",

Water clarity often exceeds 15 feet and nutrient levels are low when compared to other lakes in central Minnesota.  A fishing pier and swimming area are located at the public access site.  Panfish assessments target the larger, spawning adults that typically are underrepresented in a standard summer survey. <br> \n Bluegills are present in good numbers with a fair number reaching 7 inches but very few attaining 8 inches.  The 2015 panfish trap net assessment caught 476 Bluegill between 3.3 and 8.5 inches in length.  Mean length for the sample was six inches with 15% (n=71) of the fish exceeding seven inches and 0.6% (n=3) more than eight inches in length.  Black Crappie are also found in good numbers.   The 2015 panfish assessment netted forty-five crappie between 7.7 and 10.9 inches in length.  Mean length for the sample was 8.6 inches with 20% (n=9) of the fish exceeding nine inches and 4% (n=2) more than ten inches in length.  A majority of the crappie caught were between 8 \u0013 9 inches in length most in the 8-9 inch range but fish over 11 inches have been observed.  Winter and spring are probably the best times to target crappie.   <br> \n       Proper land use practices in the watershed and along the shoreline are encouraged to maintain the lake's water quality.  Minimizing vegetation removal and other habitat disruption along the lakeshore will help ensure Bass Lake continues to provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Bass Lake is a small, moderately deep (47' max. depth) basin with excellent water quality characteristics.  Water clarity often exceeds 15 feet and nutrient levels are low when compared to other lakes in central Minnesota.  A fishing pier and swimming area are located at the public access site.  The lake is managed primarily for bass and panfish, however Walleye stocking does take place during odd numbered years. <br> \n     Despite frequent fingerling  stocking the Walleye population is pretty low.   Northern Pike are numerous and at the high end in relation to management goals.  Most of the pike are small, averaging 20 inches and 1.8 pounds.  These small pike have likely limited survival of stocked Walleye through predation.  Yellow Perch numbers are also very low due to pike predation.  A reduction in the population of small pike through angler harvest would potentially benefit the lake's fish community. <br> \n     Bluegills are present in good numbers with a fair number reaching 7 inches but very few attaining 8 inches.  Black Crappie are also found in good numbers with most in the 8-9 inch range but fish over 11 inches have been observed.  Winter and spring are probably the best times to target crappie.  Largemouth Bass are abundant  but most are under 1 pound, with few reaching over 16 inches. <br> \n     Rough fish such as Bowfin (Dogfish), Common Carp, Brown Bullhead and Yellow Bullhead reside in Bass Lake but in low to moderate numbers.  Also residing in the lake are several pollution intolerant species including the Least Darter, a species of Special Concern.  The presence of these intolerant species indicates that the lake continues to provide desirable water quality and habitat capable of supporting such sensitive species.  Proper land use practices in the watershed and along the shoreline are encouraged to maintain the lake's water quality.  Minimizing vegetation removal and other habitat disruption along the lakeshore will help ensure Bass Lake continues to provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat. <br> \n</p>",
