Habitat conditions are best suited to nortern pike and panfish, but establishment of an incidental walleye fishery through fingerling stocking appears to have been successful.  Tamarack Lake has been stocked with walleye fingerlings in 1994 and 1992; yearlings in 1990; and fry in 1989, 1986 and 1984. Walleye aged from the 1995 assessment exhibited an 83% correlation to years of stocking, with 67% correlating to 1994 and 1992 fingerling plants, and 17% correlating to the 1989 year class stocked as fry and yearlings.  Walleye gillnet catch rate from 1995 assessment was 3.0 per lift, which is within accepted ranges compared to other lakes of similar type.  Walleye size structure was fair with 32% of sampled fish longer than 15 inches. Walleye from the aged sample were 14.1 inches long at age IV, which is average compared to other populations from Duluth Area.     Gillnet abundance indices stated as number per net-night was within accepted ranges for this type of lake for northern pike, white sucker, black and yellow bullhead, shorthead redhorse and rockbass.  Yellow perch had the only abundance index value below the accepted lower end of the range for this lake type.  Size structure for northern pike and yellow perch was poor with only 10% of sampled northerns longer than 21 inches and 20% of sampled perch longer than 8 inches.  Mean length of white sucker sampled in gillnets was 15.3 inches.  Northern pike were 22.0 inches long at age IV, which is average compared to other populations from Duluth Area.     Trapnet abundance indices stated as number of fish per net-night were within accepted ranges for bluegill and bowfin, and below the accepted lower end of the range for black crappie when compared to other lakes of this type.  Size structure for both bluegill and black crappie was good.  Of sampled bluegill, 85% were longer than 6 inches and 33% were longer than 8 inches.  Similarly, 73% of sampled black crappie were longer than 8 inches and 30% were longer than 10 inches.  Growth rates for both bluegill and black crappie were average compared to other populations from Duluth Area.  Mean weight and length of bowfin sampled in trapnets was 11.5 and 27.0 inches. </p>",

Walleye is the primary management species for Tamarack Lake.  The current management plan for Tamarack directs Walleye fingerling stocking at a rate of one pound per littoral acre every even year.   <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance of 3.0 per gillnet lift was average compared to other similar Minnesota Lakes.  Mean length was 17.9 inches.  The proportion of adult Walleye that exceeded quality size (greater than 15 inches) was 72%, while the proportion that exceeded preferred size (greater than 20 inches) was 39%.  All stocked year-classes from 2012 through 2018 were present and 100% of the Walleyes aged corresponded to stocked year-classes.  In addition, one large fish captured that was nearly 25 inches long was assigned to the 2002 year-class. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie abundance of 1.7 per trapnet lift was below average compared to other similar Minnesota lakes.  Average length was 8.2 inches and fish up to 10.9 inches in length were sampled.  The proportion of adult Black Crappie that exceeded quality size (greater than 8 inches) was 71%, while the proportion that exceeded preferred size (greater than 10 inches) was 14%.   Anglers may expect improving catch rates of Black Crappie in the next couple years with moderate abundances of fish present from the 2018 and 2019 year-classes.   <br> \n <br> \nBluegill abundance was average at 4.7 per trapnet lift.  Average length was 7.2 inches.  The proportion of adult Bluegill that exceeded quality size (greater than 6 inches) was 71%, while the proportion that exceeded preferred size (greater than 8 inches) was 0%.    <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike abundance of 4.3 per gillnet lift was average compared to other similar Minnesota Lakes.  Average size was small at 18.7 inches and 1.4 pounds. <br> \n</p>",

Walleye is the primary management species for Tamarack Lake. <br> \n   <br> \nWalleye fingerlings have been stocked into Tamarack at a rate of one pound per littoral acre every even year since 1992.  Walleye abundance of 0.2 per gillnet lift was well below average compared to other similar Minnesota Lakes.  Only one specimen was sampled which was 11.9 inches in length.  The fish was from the 2014 year-class, which was a stocked year-class.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie abundance of 3.9 per trapnet lift was average compared to other similar Minnesota lakes.  Average length was 8.1 inches with fish up to 10.4 inches sampled.  Anglers should expect good catches of Black Crappie in the next couple years with a strong 2012 year-class present.  Bluegill abundance was average at 6.9 per trapnet lift.  Average length was 7.2 inches with over two-thirds of the sample exceeding 7.0 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike abundance of 5.0 per gillnet lift was average compared to other similar Minnesota Lakes.  Average size was 19.6 inches and 2.0 pounds. <br> \n</p>",

Walleye fingerlings have been stocked in the fall of even numbered years since 1990.  Fish population investigations have been conducted in 1951, 1972, 1985, 1990, 1995 and 2000.     Walleye abundance indexed with assessment nets was 1.3 per lift.  This index value was typical compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Size of walleye was good but growth rates were slow.  Mean length of sampled walleye was 15.4 inches and length at the beginning of their fourth year of life was 12.8 inches.  From a sample of aged walleye it was determined that 64% were born in years that walleye fingerlings were stocked.     Yellow perch abundance indexed with assessment nets was 2.5 per lift.  This index value was typical compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Average length of sampled yellow perch was 7.6 inches.     Northern pike abundance indexed with assessment nets was 7.3 per lift.  This index value was above average when compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Size of northern pike was poor and growth rates were slow.  Mean length of sampled northerns was 18.9 inches and length at the beginning of their fourth year of life was 19.2 inches.  A sample of aged northern pike showed that 60% were born in 1997 or 1998 and no northerns were older than age VI.     Bluegill abundance indexed with assessment nets was 6.7 per lift.  This index was typical compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Size of bluegill was good and rate of growth was fast.  Mean length of sampled bluegill was 6.4 inches and the length at the beginning of their fourth year of life was 5.9 inches.  A sample of aged bluegill showed that most year classes between 1991 and 1999 were relatively well represented.     Black crappie were sampled at a low level.  Other species sampled include black bullhead, brown bullhead, bowfin, shorthead redhorse, rock bass, white sucker and pumpkinseed sunfish.</p>",

Tamarack Lake is located just south of Wright, MN off County Road #128.  A DNR administered public access is located on the southwest side of the lake. Walleye fingerlings have been stocked in the fall of even numbered years since 1990.  Previous fish population investigations were conducted in 1951, 1972, 1985, 1990, 1995 and 2000.  Tamarack was surveyed during the summer of 2008 to update information about fish populations and to evaluate the success of the walleye stocking program.   <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance of 2.0 was up slightly from 2000 (1.3) and was average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Walleye mean length was 15.4 inches and growth was average when compared to other Duluth Area lakes.  Fifty percent of the walleyes sampled were over 18 inches in length.  Five year-classes were not represented (1996, 1999-2000 and 2002-2003) from 1995 through 2006.  Sixty-seven percent of the walleyes aged corresponded to stocked years.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike abundance of 5.5 per gillnet lift was down from 2000 (7.3) and was average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Average length was 21.7 inches and growth was above average when compared to other Duluth Area lakes.  Only 24 percent of the northern pike were over 22 inches in length, with fish up to 36.2 inches sampled.  All year-classes from 2002 to 2007 were represented. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie abundance of 6.4 per trapnet lift was up from 2000 (0.8) and was average when compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Black crappie mean length was 8.1 inches, and growth was below average when compared to other Duluth Area lakes.  All year-classes from 2001 to 2006 were represented. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill abundance of 15.8 per trapnet lift was up from 2000 (6.7) and was average when compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Average length of sampled bluegills was good at 6.9 inches and growth was average when compared to other Duluth Area lakes.  Six percent of the fish captured exceeded 8 inches.  All year-classes from 1999 to 2006 were represented, with strong 2002 and 2003 year-classes, comprising 61% of captured fish.   <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch abundance of 1.3 per gillnet lift was down from 2000 (2.5) and was below average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Average length of perch was 6.2 inches.  Not enough individuals were sampled (8) to evaluate stock density or growth.  All year-classes from 2003 to 2005 were represented.  Shoreline seining sampled 51 young-of-the-year (YOY) perch indicating a possible strong year-class for 2008.   <br> \n <br> \nA total of 20 largemouth bass were sampled for the first time in 2008 on Tamarack Lake.  Eighteen bass were sampled during shoreline seining, of which 12 were YOY indicating natural reproduction is occurring.  This follows an emerging pattern in Duluth Area lakes of largemouth bass showing up in lakes where they have not been documented before.   <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species sampled included bowfin, pumpkinseed sunfish, hybrid sunfish, rock bass, shorthead redhorse, Iowa darter, brown bullhead, yellow bullhead and white sucker.    <br> \n <br> \nInformation was collected on aquatic vegetation, substrate and water quality.  Diversity of aquatic plants was good with 44 species or species groups identified along 20 transects.  White waterlily was the most frequently found plant (95% of transects) followed by coontail and wild celery (90% and 80% of transects, respectively).  Many species were only found at one transect (5%) including blue flag iris, bulb-bearing water hemlock, bushy pondweed, coiled pondweed, lesser duckweed, liverwort, muskgrass group, needlerush, purple loosestrife, reed canary grass, swamp fivefinger, water moss group and water smartweed.  The most common substrate types were sand and detritus, which were identified along 85% and 80% of the transects, respectively.  Results of laboratory water analysis indicate Tamarack is a slightly basic, moderately soft water lake with moderate fertility.     <br> \n</p>",
