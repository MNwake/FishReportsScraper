The absence of Age I, II and IV fish is unusual as natural reproduction historically has been good with very few missing year classes. Walleye growth is good for all ages sampled.     Gillnet catches of Northern Pike have increased with each assessment. Present Northern Pike densities are high for a lake in this classification. Average size was 5.3 pounds however there was also an absence of smaller with none smaller than 23.0 inches sampled.     Yellow Perch have increased substantially and are presently providing an abundant forage base.     White Sucker densities have historically been low. Gillnet catches of White Sucker have been increasing in each assessment but the catch per net is below that of similar lake types.</p>",

The average length was 17.8 inches with a range from 14.3 to 25.9 inches. Growth for walleyes was faster than those from similar lakes in the Finland area. <br> \n  <br> \nNorthern pike numbers have increased in each assessment with a catch in 2009 of 6.0 fish per net which was slightly above the third quartile for the lake class. Average length was 22.5 inches with a range from 15.8 to 28.5 inches. Growth for northern pike was faster than other lakes in the Finland area. <br> \n <br> \nThe yellow perch population was slightly below average for the lake class.  The small sized perch provide a good portion of the forage base in this lake. White sucker, golden shiner and fathead minnows also contribute to the forage base. <br> \n <br> \nNipisiquit Lake is within Tettegouche State Park and fishing pressure is likely low due to difficult access. Regulations restrict use of outboard motors on Park lakes.  Some open water fishing is done from canoes by people camping at nearby MicMac Lake where rentals are available.   A snowmobile trail comes within 300 feet of the lake access, which shortens the hike for winter anglers.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Nipisiquit Lake is a 57 acre lake with a maximum depth of 21 feet located completely within Tettegouche State Park; there is a picnic area located at the access on the east end of the lake.  Because this lake is completely within the state park and is not a designated trout lake, a fishing license is not required for Minnesota residents.  State Park rules do not allow for use of motorized watercraft and gas augers.  Access to Nipisiquit Lake is difficult and involves either a 1.7 mile hike from the Tettegouche State Park Trailhead or a 1.7 mile hike into Tettegouche Camp, a paddle across Micmac Lake, and then a short portage (700 feet) into Nipisiquit Lake.  In the winter, snowmobiles can be used to get to the lake, but may not be used on the lake.  <br> \n <br> \nThe purpose of the 2018 survey was to provide an update to the status of the fish community, which is maintained entirely through natural reproduction.  Walleye catch in Nipisiquit Lake was near average when compared to similar lakes.  The average weight of Walleye sampled was almost 1 3/4 pounds with the heaviest Walleye tipping the scales at roughly 2 3/4 pounds.  Average length was approximately 17 inches with the longest fish measuring 21 inches.  Five different ages of Walleye were identified in the sample ranging from two to eight.  Age-3 fish were the most common and averaged 16 inches long at the time of sampling.  Growth of Walleye in Nipisiquit Lake was fast when compared to similar lakes in the area.     <br> \n <br> \nThe catch of Northern Pike was near average when compared to similar lakes in northeast Minnesota.  Most pike sampled were between 19 and 25 inches long, although one large fish measured 39.5 inches and weighed 15.5 pounds.  Northern Pike ranged in age from two to 12 with age three and four fish making up the largest portion of the catch.  Age three fish averaged 20 inches and age four fish averaged 22 inches at the time of sampling.  Northern Pike growth was fast relative to other area lakes. <br> \n <br> \nCatch of adult Yellow Perch was well below average compared to similar lakes with only six sampled in gears designed to sample gamefish.  These six fish ranged in length from 5 1/2 to 6 1/2 inches.  Nets designed to sample forage were also used in this survey and large numbers of small Yellow Perch were sampled in these nets.  In addition to gamefish species, White Sucker, Fathead Minnow, and Golden Shiner were also sampled.   <br> \n <br> \nFor anglers willing to put in the effort to get to Nipisiquit Lake it offers good Walleye and Northern Pike fishing opportunities for quality sized fish.  It's location within the park provides a very scenic and pristine setting for anglers that make the trek.  </p>",
