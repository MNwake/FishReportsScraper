These two species catch rates exceeded the third quartile of the area median for lakes of less than 230 acres with a total alkalinity of less than 47.6 ppm within the Brainerd management area. Pumpkinseed and largemouth bass net catches show average population levels with net catches between the first and third quartile of the area median. Black crappie exhibited below average population levels with catch rates below the first quartile of the Brainerd area median. Northern pike density appeared to be high with gill net catches greater than the third quartile. The northern pike ranged in size from 16.4 to 28.0 inches with a mean weight sampled of 2 lbs. Age classes 3-7 were represented in the net catches with growth rates slightly below average. The yellow bullhead population density appears high with gill net catches above the third quartile of the region 3 median. The mean weight at capture was 0.8 pound/fish. The bluegill population is high. Ages 3-11 were sampled. Growth rates were slow when compared to state averages. The largemouth bass population density appears average. Only six fish were sampled. Growth rates appear to be slightly below average compared to statewide growth rates. Black crappie population density appears low from the net catches. Black crappie growth rates were above when compared to state averages.</p>",
