The northern population has increased drastically from the 1980 assessment.  Net catches rose from 5 per lift to 11 per lift.  The perch population has increased from 2 per lift in 1980 to 17.6 per lift in 1983.  Numbers of largemouth bass have remained constant at 0.67 per lift.  There is a large population of bluegills (64.7 per lift), though the sizes taken by anglers are generally small.\n\n</p>",

Definite age groups were undefinable because of age.  The walleye ranged from 17.3\" to 27.7\" in length and were thought to be 5 years of age and older.  Eight northerns were taken during the survey. Their growth rates were good and they ranged from one to four years of age.  Spawning areas are poor to fair for walleyes and northern.  Only one largemouth bass (age IV) was taken.  Its growth rate was average.  There were a number of young of year bass taken during shoreline seining.   Spawning areas for largemouth bass seem good.  There is a good population of panfish; namely pumpkinseed, bluegills and black crappies.  They were from I to IV years of age and their growth was good.  Spawning is good to excellent for panfish.  Though a small lake, Erie has adequate and fairly well balanced populations of gamefish.  This is one reason that it is one of the most heavily fished lakes in the area.</p>",

A good population of northern pike appears to exist with a catch rate of 5/lift.  These fish range in size from 14-26\" total length (TL), age classes I-III.  Yellow perch numbers are somewhat low at 2/gillnet, but there is evidence of natural reproduction for this species.  Bluegill were taken at a rate of 18.5/trapnet, but are slow growing.  An age IV bluegill is just 4.3\" TL.  Black Crappies are somewhat less abundant at 0.17/trapnet.  Yellow bullheads are taken by anglers, but no black bullheads were captured during this assessment.\n\n</p>",

Approximately 87% of the sample was under 12 inches, due to the particularly strong 2001 year class.  High numbers of bluegill were trap netted, averaging 5.8 inches.  Approximately 49% of the catch was 6 inches or longer, while only 6% reached at least 7 inches.  Few northern pike were gill netted, but average size was large (29.1 inches).  The longest pike sampled was 34.7 inches.  Low numbers of black crappie were trap netted, averaging 8.0 inches.  Black crappie have not been sampled in large numbers since the 1996 netting.  High numbers of walleye were gill netted, with fish averaging 14.4 inches.  The 2004 catch rate was the highest ever measured at Erie Lake and was probably the result of natural reproduction.  Walleye were last stocked in 1992.  Moderate numbers of yellow perch were sampled, but few would be big enough to interest most anglers.  Perch averaged 6.6 inches.  High numbers of large yellow bullhead may appeal to some anglers.  Yellow bullhead averaged 12.4 inches, and the longest fish sampled was 15.2 inches.    </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of nearshore fish species in Erie Lake was conducted on July 17th-19th 2023, by Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program staff. Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake, and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine. Backpack electrofishing was completed at ten sampling stations. Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample seven stations and a 15-foot seine was used at three stations. Nearshore sampling captured fourteen species of fish including three species that are intolerant of disturbance (i.e., Banded Killifish, Blacknose Shiner, and Iowa Darter) and one that is tolerant of disturbance (i.e., Green Sunfish). <br> \n <br> \nA concurrent summer trap net survey was also conducted by IBI Program staff. Nine trap nets were set along the shoreline in locations that encompassed multiple habitat types. Trap net sampling captured eight species of fish, including one that is tolerant of disturbance (i.e., Green Sunfish). Bluegill comprised a majority of the catch by number and by biomass. <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore and trap net data were combined with gill net data from a June 2023 survey to describe the fish community and provide a fish-based IBI (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment. In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g., Banded Killifish, Blacknose Shiner, and Iowa Darter), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g., Black Bullhead and Green Sunfish). The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.  <br> \n <br> \nResults from this survey provide evidence that the fish community in Erie Lake is Lake is healthy as indicated by an FIBI score that exceeds the general use threshold determined for similar lakes. The survey results will be considered when the biological health of the lake is assessed during the South Fork Crow River Watershed assessment process, which will be completed in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A survey of the nearshore fish community was conducted at Erie Lake in 2018, by Hutchinson Area Fisheries staff.  Sampling stations were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by electrofishing and seining, where possible.  Sampling captured 13 species of native fish, and 1 Hybrid (Hybrid Sunfish).  Bluegill, Bluntnose Minnow, and Hybrid Sunfish were the three most abundant fish sampled in the 50 foot seine. <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey was combined with summer gill net and trap net data to calculate a fish based Index of Biotic Integrity (FIBI) score that described the overall health of the lake.  The FIBI used fish community data to measure a lake's health and the types of fish species present could help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment.  The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicated the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake.  The 2018 Erie FIBI score was 38, which was below the impairment threshold (45) for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes.  <br> \n  <br> \nData from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the North Fork of the Crow River Watershed assessment process, in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.  For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.  <br> \n</p>",

Northerns sampled were from 20\" to 33\" in length.  Walleyes were from 12\" to 22\" in length.  Other species of fish present are yellow bullhead, white sucker, yellow perch, pumpkinseed, and hybrid sunfish.  Largemouth bass are also present, but were only observed in the shoreline seining.\n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Erie is a small-sized lake (189 acres) located south of the Town of Darwin in Meeker County. A state-owned access with paved parking and a single cement boat ramp is present on the south shore. Erie has approximately three miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of thirty-four feet. The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MNDNR) has divided Minnesota's lakes into 44 different classes based on physical and chemical characteristics. Erie is a class 24 lake and other similar waterbodies in the Hutchinson Fisheries Management Area are Manuella and Francis Lakes in Meeker County. Erie's 2015 lake management plan listed Largemouth Bass and Bluegill as primary management species, while Northern Pike, Walleye and Black Crappie were secondary species. Netting was completed in 2023 to monitor the fish populations. <br> \n <br> \nHigh numbers of Bluegill were trap netted, and average size was small (4.8 inches). The longest Bluegill sampled was 7.7 inches. Only 3% of the trap net catch was 7 inches or longer. Low numbers of Walleye were netted, but size was large. Walleye averaged 20 inches in length. The maximum length of Walleye sampled was 23 inches. The oldest Walleye was age-18. Black Crappie were netted in 2023, with fish averaging around 8.5 inches in length. Approximately 35% of the trap net catch was 9 inches or longer. The longest Black Crappie sampled was captured in a trap net, and it was 11.5 inches <br> \n <br> \nModerate numbers of Northern Pike were gill netted this year with fish averaging an impressive 27 inches in length. Approximately 67% of pike netted were 26 inches or longer. Northern pike regulations were revised at a statewide level beginning in 2018 to better accommodate regional differences in pike habitats and population abundance and size structuring. Three zones were established for northern pike with their own bag and length limit restrictions. In the north-central zone, anglers can keep up to 10 northern pike, but no more than two pike larger than 26 inches; and all pike from 22 to 26 inches must be released. This zone regulation is meant to reduce small pike abundance by shifting population size structure back to more medium to large pike.  <br> \n <br> \nAdditional fishes sampled in the nets included Bowfin, Brown Bullhead, Golden Shiner, Green Sunfish, Hybrid Sunfish, Largemouth Bass, Pumpkinseed, Yellow Bullhead and Yellow Perch.    <br> \n <br> \nPeople can have significant impacts on lakes and the fish populations they support. Overharvest, lakeshore development, removal of shoreline vegetation, and introductions of invasive species can all adversely affect fish populations. Aquatic invasive species (AIS) are typically moved from infested to non-infested waters by anglers, boaters and lakeshore owners, and can adversely impact lakes and fish populations. Erie has the AIS Eurasian watermilfoil. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants and animals from their watercraft and drain all lake water from their boat and bait buckets before leaving the lake. If you suspect an infestation of an invasive species in this lake, save a specimen and report it to a local MNDNR office. Additional information on all of these topics can be found on the MNDNR website (www.dnr.state.mn.us) or by contacting the Hutchinson Area Fisheries office.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A population assessment was conducted at Erie Lake in 2014 to monitor the fish population.  A total of 11 species, plus Hybrid Sunfish, were sampled in the gill nets and trap nets.  The lake was stratified on 6/16/14 with the dissolved oxygen concentration falling below 2.0 mg/l at 21'.  Game fish tend to avoid water with less than 2.0 mg/l of oxygen, so don't fish too deep at this time of the year.  Water clarity was good with a secchi disk reading of 9.0 feet that day.   The exotic plant, Eurasian Watermilfoil, was found in Erie Lake in 2014.  Anglers are reminded to remove all vegetation from their boats and trailers when leaving the lake.  <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled low numbers of Northern Pike (7) for a catch rate of 1.2/net, which was below the normal range for this type of lake.  The 2012 catch rate was also low at 2.7/net.  Catch rates from 1975 to 2014 (n=12) were mostly low, ranging from 0.7 to 11.2/net with an average of 3.1.  Historically, recruitment could be classified as low (<5/net) at Erie Lake.  Gill netted Northern Pike were 21.5 to 30.1 inches long with an average of 27.3.  The 2014 population was similar to past assessments, with there being low numbers of nice sized fish.         <br> \n <br> \nTrap nets sampled low numbers of Black Crappie (22) for a catch rate of 2.4/net.  This catch rate was within the normal range for a lake of this type.  The 2009 catch rate was also low (1.0/net).  Catch rates from 1975 to 2014 (n=12) were variable, ranging from 0.0 to 25.4/net with an average of 4.8.  The last four catch rates have been below the historical average.  Trap netted Black Crappie were 3.2 to 12.1 inches long with an average of 7.0.  Gill nets also sampled low numbers of Black Crappie (30) for a catch rate of 5.0/net, which was also within the normal range for this type of lake.  The 2009 gill net catch rate was 8.0/net.  Catch rates from 1975 to 2014 (n=12) were mostly low, but fairly stable.  They ranged from 0.3 to 8.0/net with an average of 3.7.  Gill netted Black Crappie were 5.5 to 9.1 inches long with an average of 6.4.       <br> \n    <br> \nGill nets sampled low numbers of Walleye (8) for a catch rate of 1.3/net, which was within the normal range for a lake of this type and the second lowest on record at Erie Lake.  The 2009 catch rate was also low at 1.8/net.  Catch rates from 1975 to 2014 (n=12), under various stocking regimes and a period of no stocking, were variable ranging from 1.0 to 11.3/net with an average of 4.7.  In 2014, gill netted Walleye were 13.7 to 25.6 inches long with an average of 19.3.  Walleye were estimated to be age-2 to age-13 with 8 year-classes being present.  All year-classes were ranked as being weak.  Non-stocked year-classes accounted for 75% of the gill net aged Walleye, indicating that some natural reproduction was occurring at Erie Lake.  In 2014, growth was good, with Walleye reaching 16.0 inches after four summers of growth.  The current stocking regime of 2 pounds of fingerlings/littoral acre (acres less than 15 feet deep) every-other-year was initiated in 2010.    Preliminary evaluation of the new stocking regime and contributions (2 fish) of the two stocked year-classes (2010 and 2012) indicated that the stocking was having little effect on gill net catch rates at Erie Lake. Gill net catch rates in 2000, 2004, and 2009, during years when Walleye stocking was discontinued (1993 to 2009) ranged from 1.8 to 11.3/net with an average of 5.4/net.  Predation by high numbers of Largemouth Bass may be limiting survival of stocked Walleye fingerlings at Erie Lake.      <br> \n   <br> \nTrap nets sampled high numbers of Bluegill (760) for a catch rate of 84.4/net which was above the normal range for this type of lake.  The 2009 catch rate was nearly identical at 82.3/net.  Catch rates from 1975 to 2014 (n=12) were variable, ranging from 18.5 to 329.3/net, with an average of 81.7.  In 2014, trap netted Bluegill were 2.8 to 5.9 inches long with an average of 4.2, indicating a poor size structure.  Bluegill were age-2 to age-6 with five year-classes being present.  Age-3 and age-4 fish accounted for 93% of the trap net aged fish.  Growth was slow.  Sunfish anglers can expect plenty of action, but not too many keepers from Erie Lake.    <br> \n       <br> \nElectrofishing sampled high numbers of Largemouth Bass (73), for a catch rate of 30.2/hr and this was the lowest catch rate ever recorded at Erie Lake. The 2009 electrofishing catch rate was 47.2/hr.  Historic catch rates from 1991 to 2014 (n=17) ranged from 30.2 to 105.1/hr with an average of 59.1.  Largemouth Bass were 2.8 to 19.3 inches long with an average of 14.2.  Approximately 79% of the fish captured were between 12.0 and 16.9 inches, indicating a quality size structure that should appeal to anglers.  Largemouth Bass were age-1 to age-11 with 11 year-classes being present.  Growth was moderate.  Despite the lower catch rate in 2014, Erie is still one of the better Largemouth Bass lakes in Meeker County.   <br> \n     <br> \nGill nets sampled low numbers of Yellow Perch (27) for a catch rate of 4.5/net, which was within the normal range for this type of lake.  The 2009 catch rate was higher at 20.7/net.  Catch rates from 1975 to 2014 (n=12) were highly variable ranging from 0.0 to 39.2/net with an average of 10.8.  Yellow Perch were small, ranging from 5.1 to 6.2 inches long with an average of 5.7.     <br> \n <br> \nTrap nets and gill nets failed to sample Common Carp in 2014.  Historic trap net catch rates (n=12) from 1975 to 2014 were all low, ranging from 0.0 to 0.8/net with an average of 0.1.  Historic gill net catch rates were also low ranging from 0.0 to 0.5/net with an average of 0.1.        <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled low numbers of Black Bullhead (1) for a catch rate of 0.2/net, which was below the normal range for a lake of this type.  The 2009 catch rate was also low at 0.5/net.  Historic catch rates from 1975 to 2014 (n=12) were all low, ranging from 0.0 to 2.8/net with an average of 0.7.  Trap nets sampled 4 Black Bullhead for a catch rate of 0.4/net which was below the normal range.  Trap net catch rates from 1975 to 2014 (n=12) were all low ranging from 0.0 to 0.8/net.  Trap netted Black Bullhead were 10.8 to 14.7 inches long with an average of 12.7.         <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Erie, Meeker County, is a 182 acre lake with a maximum depth of 34 feet.  A resurvey was conducted June 19, 2000, and 19 fish species were sampled.  The lake management plan lists largemouth bass and bluegill as primary management species.  Northern pike are listed as a secondary species.  Lake Erie is a typical bass\\panfish lake.A total of 324 bluegill were sampled by trap net for a catch rate of 36.0 per net.  Bluegill ranged in length from 4.2 to 8.0 inches and averaged 6.4 inches.  Bluegill were II to VI years old.  Growth was above average for this type of lake.  A total of 77 largemouth bass were sampled by spring night time electrofishing for a catch rate o 51.5 largemouth bass per hour of electrofishing.  Largemouth bass ranged in length from 7.5 to 20.2 inches and averaged 13.6 inches.  Largemouth bass were II to XI years old with nine year classes represented.  Lake Erie is a control lake in a statewide experimental regulations project.  A total of four northern pike were sampled by gill net for a catch rate of 0.7 per net.  Northern pike ranged in length from 25.7 to 34.3 inches and averaged 29.8 inches.  Average weight was 6.0 pounds.  Northern pike were V to VII years old with three year classes represented.  Although pike numbers were down, size was up.    A total of 18 walleye were sampled by gill net for a catch rate of 3.0 per net.  This catch rate was within the expected range for lakes of this type.  Walleye ranged in length from 15.1 to 24.6 inches and averaged 21.1 inches.  Average weight was 3.5 pounds.  Walleye were III to VIII years old with six year classes represented.  Walleye stocking was discontinued in 1992.  Natural reproduction accounted for 89% of the walleye sampled in gill nets.A total of 34 black crappie were sampled by trap net for a catch rate of 3.8 per net.  Black crappie ranged in length from 7.0 to 8.6 inches and averaged 8.1 inches.  Black crappie numbers were similar to historical catches and within the expected range for lakes of this type.Development on the lake is relatively low with 33 homes present.  Good water quality and diverse plants, both emergent and submergent, provide fish habitat.  Forage was abundant and all fish showed good growth.  </p>",

Prior to 1982, both walleye and northern pike were stocked in Erie, and gill net catches for walleye and northern pike averaged 4.2 and 3.1 fish per lift, respectively.  Since 1982, gill net catch for pike has decreased from 11.50 to 0.83 fish per lift in 1990.  The median catch for pike in lakes in the same ecological classification was 6.50 fish per lift.  Walleye catch has increased to 10.67 fish per lift, which falls above the normal range for the lake class.  Walleye in the sample ranged from 12.0 to 26.9 inches, and averaged 17.0 inches.  Walleye averaged 19.5 inches at age 4 and 21.4 inches at age 5.  Yellow perch gill net catch, at 39.17 fish per lift, was above the normal range for the lake class.  The average length of perch sampled in gill nets was 6.1 inches.  Young of the year (YOY) perch were abundant in seine samples, averaging 41 fish per haul.  Abundance of bluegill in trap net samples was high, averaging 329.25 fish per lift, above the normal range for the lake class.  Bluegill in the trap net sample ranged from 3.0 to 6.5 inches, and averaged 4.7 inches.  Pumpkinseed sunfish were also abundant in trap net samples, averaging 8.75 fish per lift, which is above the normal range for the lake class.  Largemouth bass YOY were abundant in seining samples (113 YOY total).  Yellow bullhead trap net catch, at 8.75 fish per lift was above the normal range for the lake class.  Yellow bullhead in the trap net samples ranged from 6.5 to 15.5 inches, and averaged 11.8 inches.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Erie is a medium size lake (182 acres) with a maximum depth of 34 feet, located in southeastern Meeker County.  In 1993 an assessment of fish populations was conducted in Lake Erie that included the use of gillnets and trapnets, electrofishing for largemouth bass and shoreline seining to assess natural reproduction.  Fish species of particular interest captured in the survey included black crappie, bluegill, largemouth bass, northern pike, walleye and yellow perch.      The black crappie trapnet catch (12.8 per net) was above the normal or expected range for lakes of this class.  This is a significant increase in black crappie numbers from past surveys, when they have usually been near the lake class median.  Of the black crappie sampled nearly 80% were age II and they averaged 6.5 inches long.  These fish may provide good angling opportunities in the next several years.       Bluegill numbers in the trapnets (80 per net) were also above average for this lake class.  Past surveys have usually shown bluegill numbers to be near the median level.  However, the 1990 survey had bluegill trapnet catches of over 300 per net.  Age distribution of bluegill was evenly distributed with fish from age II through VI, indicating consistent reproduction.   Growth was slower than many Hutchinson Area lakes with age V bluegill averaging 6.4 inches long.       A northern pike gillnet catch of 0.7 per net was below the normal range for this lake.  Surveys done in the early 1980's had northern pike gillnet catches near or above the median level.  At one time northern pike had access to several spawning marshes around the lake that have since been partially filled or blocked for lakeshore development.  This, combined with low water conditions of the late 1980's may have impacted northern pike populations in Lake Erie.  Of the four northern pike captured during the survey two were age II and one was age IV and one age V.    A walleye gillnet catch of 4.5 per net was within the normal range for this lake class.  This was similar to past surveys when the walleye catch has been near the lake class median.  The exception was the 1990 survey when the walleye gillnet catch of 10.7 per net was above the normal range for this lake.  Walleye age I, III and IV comprised nearly 80% of the catch.  Growth was good with age III and IV fish averaging 18 to 20 inches long.       A yellow perch gillnet catch rate of 7 per net was within the normal range for this lake.  However, trapnetting at ice-out indicated a high yellow perch population as evidenced by numerous small perch caught in the trapnet leads.  Growth was slow with age IV perch averaging 6 inches long.  It is likely that the perch population is much higher than gillnets indicate and that many are not large enough to recruit to the gillnets.            Electrofishing to assess largemouth bass populations was conducted by DNR Research staff from Hutchinson during the spring of 1993.  Electrofishing was done during both the day and night to determine differences in catch rates.  Spring nighttime catch rates from two different nights were reported as 77.4 and 68.9 bass per hour.  Daytime catch rates during the same time period were reported as 21.0 and 18.4 bass per hour.  Age class distribution of the catch was similar for night and day electrofishing.  Largemouth bass from age II through VI+ were captured with good representation of all year classes, indicating consistent reproduction.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Erie is located in Meeker County, south of Darwin.  It is a small lake (182 acres) with a maximum depth of 34 feet.  The lake has good water quality and a diverse fish community.  Lake Erie usually produces good catches of bluegill, largemouth bass, northern pike and occasionally black crappie and walleye.  A public access is located on the south end of the lake.  A fisheries survey conducted in 1996 sampled above average numbers of black crappie.  Although the average length was 6 inches, most were age 2 fish that should provide good angling in the next several years.  Bluegill trapnet catch rates were above the lake class median, but within the normal range for this lake type.  Past surveys have shown bluegill numbers within or above the normal range.  Although bluegill were abundant, average length was less than 6 inches.  Yellow perch were also present, but average length was less than 7 inches.  Yellow bullhead were abundant.  Yellow bullhead sampled in trapnets ranged in length from 6 to 15 inches and average length was over 12 inches.  The abundance and nice size of these fish may provide an overlooked opportunity for anglers.  Black bullhead were sampled in low numbers.  Northern pike numbers have fluctuated, but the gillnet catch in 1996 was above the lake class average and within the normal range.  The average length of northern pike was 26 inches and fish up to 33 inches were sampled.  The walleye gillnet catch rate was slightly above the normal range for this lake class.  This is similar to past surveys.  Walleye sampled in gillnets ranged in length from 10 to 22 inches and average length was nearly 17 inches.  Walleye have not been stocked in Lake Erie since 1992 and they seem to be producing natural year classes.  The biggest draw to anglers may be the largemouth bass fishing.  Lake Erie is one of the better lakes in the Hutchinson Fisheries Management Area for numbers and size of bass.  Abundant vegetation and undeveloped, wooded shorelines provide good habitat and angling locations.  Good numbers of largemouth bass were sampled with electrofishing gear.  The average length was 12 inches and fish up to 19 inches were sampled.  Because of the lakes small size and good population structure, catch and release or selective harvest is encouraged.</p>",

Although walleyes were stocked for thirteen years, few were caught.  Panfish appear to be doing well and bass should also approve of the conditions in this lake.  The lake is definitely a game fish lake and should be managed as such. <br> \n <br> \nFISHES PRESENT: <br> \nCommon sucker, golden shiner, black bullhead, brown bullhead, northern pike, western banded killifish, perch, walleye, Iowa darter, largemouth bass, bluegill, pumpkinseed, black crappie, green x pumpkinseed hybrid sunfish.  <br> \n  <br> \nRATIO OF ABUNDANCE: <br> \nAbundances compared to statewide averages.  Common sucker (0.09 pounds/Hoopnet -HN) abundance below average.  Black bullhead (0.32 pounds/HN) abundance below average.  Brown bullhead (3.61 pounds/HN) abundance below average.  Northern pike (0.41 pounds/HN) abundance below average.  Perch (0.12 pounds/HN) abundance below average.  Walleye (0.11 pounds/HN) abundance below average.  Largemouth bass (0.06 pounds/HN) abundance below average.  Pumpkinseed (0.38 pounds/HN) abundance average.  Bluegill (0.23 pounds/HN) abundance below average.

Northern pike average 18.3 inches.  Perch average 7.0 inches.  Bluegill average 4.4 inches.  Pumpkinseed 6.3 inches.  Black crappie average 7.5 inches.  Bluegill and black crappie were below average, and all others listed were average.   <br> \n <br> \nFISH GROWTH RATES: <br> \nGrowth rates for Northern pike, bluegills, pumpkinseed, and black crappie are above statewide averages, while perch were average.   <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A resurvey was conducted at Erie Lake in 2009 to evaluate the lake's physical, chemical, biological characteristics.  A total of 18 different species of fish were sampled, plus hybrid sunfish.    <br> \n <br> \nErie's lakeshed was small (590 acres) and dominated by row crop agriculture.  The lakeshed to lake ratio was 3:1.  Roughly 36% of the shoreline was developed, with residential being the dominant coverage.  Aquatic vegetation was abundant with much diversity (11 submergent varieties).  Coontail, northern milfoil,  and water celery were all classified as common.  Sand was classified as abundant, gravel was common, and all other substrate types were catagorized as rare.  Dissolved oxygen (DO) dropped below 2 mg/l at 19 feet on 6/22/09, limiting fish to the well oxygenated area above this depth.  Water clarity was moderate, with a secchi disk reading of 4.9 feet in late June.   <br> \n <br> \nSpring night-time electrofishing sampled 81 largemouth bass for a catch rate of 47.2/hr.  The 2006 catch rate was 73.4/hr.  Catch rates (n=16) from 1991 to 2009 ranged from 31.6/hr to 134.0/hr averaging 60.9/hr.  Largemouth bass were 8.9 to 19.2 inches long averaging 12.3 inches in length.  Good numbers of fish of varying sizes makes Erie one of the better largemouth bass lakes in Meeker County.  Data showed a slight decline in the overall quality of largemouth bass at Erie Lake since sampling began in 1991, but data for the past 3 assessments showed a positive trend for numbers of fish greater than 15 inches.  Largemouth bass were 3 to 10 years old with 8 year-classes present.  Age 4 fish accounted for 42% of the electrofishing sample.  Growth was slow.     <br> \n <br> \nTrap nets sampled 741 bluegill for a catch rate of 82.3/net, which indicated that high numbers were present.  The 2004 catch rate was 69.4/net.  The last three catch rates indicated an upward trend for bluegill numbers at Erie Lake.  Bluegill were 3.2 to 7.1 inches long averaging 5.4 inches.  Unfortunately most of the fish were small, with 64% of the trap net catch being under 6 inches in length.  Bluegill were 3 to 7 years old with 5 year-classes present.  Age 4 fish accounted for approximately 39% of the trap net catch.  Growth was slow. <br> \n <br> \nTrap nets sampled 9 black crappie for a catch rate of 1.0/net, which indicated that numbers may be down.  However, recent research findings concluded that trap nets do not always sample crappie well in June.  The 2004 catch rate was 1.78/net.  The last four trap net catches indicated a downward trend in black crappie numbers, but the gill net catch in 2009 was the highest ever measured at Erie.  The gill net catch was 8.0/net, which indicated that moderate numbers were present for this type of lake.  The 2004 gill net catch was 0.7/net.  Gill netted black crappie were 3.5 to 8.5 inches long averaging 5.3 inches.  Trap nets did sample fish up to 9.3 inches in length, but very few fish (9 total) from either gear were over 8 inches in length.  Black crappie were 2 to 5 years old with 4 year-classes present.  Approximately 73% of the gill net catch was from the 2007 year-class (age 2), perhaps indicating a stronger year-class.  Growth was slow, with fish not reaching 8 inches until age 4 or age 5. <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled 16 northern pike for a catch rate of 2.7/net, which was within the normal range for this type of lake.  The 2004 catch rate was similar at 2.0/net.  The latest three catch rates indicated a slight upward trend in the number of fish caught per net.  Northern pike were 24.7 to 35.3 inches long averaging 30.1 inches.  Approximately 50% of the gill net catch was 30 inches or longer.  As has usually been the case at Erie, anglers should expect to find low numbers, but quality sized fish.  Northern pike were 3 to 6 years old with 4 year-classes present.  Growth was fast.   <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled 124 yellow perch for a catch rate of 20.7/net.  The latest four catch rates indicated an upward trend in the number of fish caught per net. Yellow perch were 5.3 to 7.7 inches long averaging of 6.1 inches.  Yellow perch were 2 to 5 years old with 4 year-classes present.  Age 4 fish accounted for 75% of the sample.  Growth was slow.  Although no quality sized fish were present for anglers, yellow perch are probably an important forage for Erie's predator fish. <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled 11 walleye for a catch rate of 1.8/net, which was within the normal range for this type of lake.  The 2004 catch rate was 11.3/net.  Walleye were 15.8 to 20.4 inches long averaging 18.1 inches.  Trap nets sampled walleye up to 27.6 inches in length.  Walleye were 4 to 8 years old with 5 year-classes present.  The strong 2001 year-class, documented in the 2004 assessment, appeared to be quite diminished (2 fish sampled) in 2009, but gill nets don't always do a good job of sampling those larger fish.  Growth was fast.  Since walleye were last stocked in 1992, natural reproduction coninues to sustain the population.     <br> \n <br> \nCarp were not sampled in 2009.  Gill nets sampled 3 black bullhead and trap nets sampled 1.  Gill nets sampled 1 yellow bullhead and trap nets sampled 12.     <br> \n <br> \nShoreline seining sampled young-of-the-year: bluegill (306), largemouth bass (73), and yellow perch (51).  Iowa darter (8), Johnny darter (2), banded killifish (28), bluntnose minnow (189), golden shiner (1), and spottail shiner (19) were also seined. <br> \n</p>",

Day-time electrofishing was used to capture Largemouth Bass, which were then measured and given a fin clip for the mark/recapture population estimate.  All fish were released back into the lake.  Erie Lake is infested with Eurasian watermilfoil, an invasive exotic.  Anglers are reminded to remove all vegetation from their boats and trailers when leaving the lake.  Public shore fishing is limited to the public boat ramp on Erie's south shore. <br> \n <br> \nA total of 8.1 hours of electrofishing occurred, sampling 386 Largemouth Bass (including recaptured fish).  The average catch rate was 47.4/hour of electrofishing.  Measured Largemouth Bass were 7.9 to 20.1 inches long averaging 13.4 inches.  Approximately 67% of the catch was 12 inches or longer, 32% were 15 inches or longer, and 8% were 18 inches or longer, indicating a quality population.  The PE for fish of all lengths was estimated to be 1,692 fish or 8.9 fish/acre.  The PE for 12 inch and longer fish was estimated to be 1,025 fish or 5.4 fish/acre.  Erie is one of the better Largemouth Bass lakes in Meeker County and anglers should expect plenty of action from all sizes of fish. <br> \n</p>",
