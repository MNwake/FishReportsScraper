                "narrative": "<p>Bello Lake is located about four miles north of Marcell, MN, within the Chippewa National Forest.  Largemouth bass, black crappie, and bluegill are the species managed in Bello Lake. <br> \n <br> \nPassive sampling gears tend to inadequately sample bass populations.  An active capture technique, electrofishing, was used to sample the largemouth bass population.  Largemouth were sampled at a rate of 58.5 fish per hour, up from the previous assessment of 11.8 fish per hour.  Largemouth averaged about 12 inches in length, with the longest being 20.6 inches indicating a quality fishery exists.  Most of the fish sampled in the previous assessment were less then 12 inches.  Anglers can help maintain the fishery by practicing catch-and-release.  Scale analysis indicated seven age classes present, with fish up to age-9 in the sample.  Growth was near the statewide average for all ages, except age-1, which was below average. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie were sampled in gill nets at a rate above the expected range for lakes similar to Bello.  Trap nets also sampled crappie at a rate within the expected range.  Previous catch rates were within to slightly above the expected range, similar to the 2007 assessment.  The average length was 6.3 inches, and the longest sampled was 10.7 inches.  A moderate proportion of preferred-sized fish exists, however angler accounts may suggest that this is under estimated.  Six age classes were identified through scale analysis, with fish up to age-seven present.  Growth was below the statewide average for all ages, except age-6 and -7, which was within the expected range. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill were the most abundant fish sampled in gill nets, at a rate relatively higher then previous assessment.  Trap netting tends to more accurately sample the preferred shallow water area.  The trap net catch rate was near the lower end of the expected range, similar to the previous assessment.  Lengths varied from 3.3-8.7 inches with an average length of 5.6 inches.  The size structure appears to be moderate to low with an average proportion of quality length fish and few individuals exceeding eight inches.  Scale analysis indicates that there were eight age classes present with individuals up to age-9 present.  Growth was near the lake class statewide average for all ages. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike were the second most abundant fish sampled in gill nets.  While the previous assessment had a slightly higher catch rate, both catch rates exceeded the expected range for similar lakes.  Past assessments show an increasing population trend, however 2007 was the first catch rate that decreased from the previous assessment.  The size structure is moderate with a good proportion above quality length fish, yet few individuals exceeded the preferred length of 28 inches.  Lengths ranged from 12.6-30.4 inches with an average length of 21.7 inches.  Scale and bone analysis identified eight age classes with individuals up to age-8 present.  Growth was similar to the statewide average for all ages. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch were sampled at a rate lower then the expected range, however it was still within the range of previous sampling.  The size structure was poor shown by an average length of 6.2 inches and no fish exceeded 6.5 inches.  Another important prey species, tullibee, were sampled at a historically low rate.  Previous assessments indicate a consistently decreasing catch rate.  The two fish sampled averaged about nine inches. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled include black, brown, and yellow bullhead, bowfin, pumpkinseed, rock bass, walleye, and white sucker.  The origin of the one 23 inch walleye sampled is unclear.  Walleye stocking was discontinued in 1988 due to the lack of returns. Walleye were last sampled in the 1985 assessment. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Gill net catches indicated that the northern pike population was slightly above normal as the gill net CPUE (10.7 fish per net) exceeded the third quartile value (8.3 fish per net) for this species for lake class #23.Gill net catches for walleye (0.8 fish per net) and trap net catches for bowfin (0.1 fish per net) were below the appropriate first quartile values thus indicating low population levels for these species. Although net catch indices for largemouth bass were within the quartile range for lake class #23, it may be presumptuous to evaluate the population level due to the low catchability of this species with the gear type used.The gill net catch effort (CPUE) for tullibee (4.8 fish per net) fell within the quartile range (1.2-13.9) while the yellow perch gill net CPUE (0.5 fish per net) fell below the first quartile value (1.7 fish per net) thus indicating a normal population level for tullibee and a low population level for yellow perch.  The low perch population correlates with the high northern pike population mentioned previously in this report.Black crappies were within normal abundance limits within this lake as indicated by gill net and trap net indices (1.2 and 0.8 fish per net) which fell within the appropriate quartile ranges (0.3-1.8 fish per gill net, and 0.5-2.5 fish per trap net).Gill net and trap net catches of bluegills indicated that the population contained an above normal abundance of quality bluegills (>6 inches) for lakes in the same class.  Larger bluegills (>6 inches) made up 67% (PSD=67) of the gill net sample (n=58 fish) and the gill net CPUE (9.7 fish per net) fell above the appropriate quartile value (5.7 fish per net).  In contrast with these results, 85% (PSD=15) of the trap net sample (n=41) consisted of bluegills less than 6 inches and the trap net CPUE (4.9 fish per net) fell below the first quartile value (9.8 fish per net) which indicated a lower than expected population of small bluegills (<6 inches).</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Bello Lake is a 493 acre lake located near Marcell, MN.  The fish community is dominated by largemouth bass, northern pike, and panfish.  The lake has clear water and low fertility.  There are few cabins on the lake and much of the shoreline is part of the Chippewa National Forest.  Largemouth bass were sampled on May 23rd using shoreline electrofishing.  The catch rate was 11.8/h which is slightly higher than similar lakes in the Grand Rapids Area.  Most of the largemouth bass were less than 8 inches, however, a few fish greater than 15 inches were sampled.  The bluegill trap-net catch was 5.9/set which is lower than the first quartile of 7.7/set.  Lower bluegill abundance is often favorable, because high abundance can lead to poor growth and size structure.  Size structure was moderate with a good number of fish greater than 6 inches, however, only a few fish reached preferred length of 8 inches.  Bluegill growth was similar to comparable lakes with six year old fish averaging 6 inches.  However due to low lake fertility, bluegill grew much slower than statewide averages.  Bluegill grow much more slowly than most anglers are aware.  On average it takes more than 10 years for bluegill to reach 10 inches.  Because it takes 10 years to replace a 10 inch bluegill, anglers should consider releasing larger bluegill.  Black crappie gill-net catch was 0.8/set which is within the expected range for similar lakes.  The trap-net catch rate was 0.7/set which is also within the expected range for similar lakes.  Although only 7 fish were sampled in gill nets the size was generally good with fish over 9 inches sampled.  Black crappie growth was slower than statewide averages from ages 1 to 3 and similar to statewide averages for ages 4 and 5.  Northern pike gill-net catch was 11.1/set which is higher than the expected range for similar lakes.  Northern pike abundance in the last couple of assessments has generally been higher than the expected range.  Although abundance was high, size structure was poor with few fish exceeding 21 inches and only 1 fish exceeding preferred length of 28 inches.    Yellow perch gill-net catch was 3.3/set which is within the expected range of similar lakes.  Yellow perch size structure was poor with no fish greater than 9 inches.  Other fish sampled included black bullhead, yellow bullhead, pumpkinseed sunfish, rock bass, tullibee, and white sucker.</p>",

The 493 acre lake has 251 littoral acres, a maximum depth of 58 feet with no connectivity.  There is an earthen DNR administered access on the east shore between the north and south basin.  The lake management plan was last updated in 2008.  Largemouth Bass and Black Crappie are primary management species while Bluegill are considered secondary management species.  The 2016 survey is one of seven conducted since 1973, assessing the fish community. <br> \n <br> \nElectrofishing sampled Largemouth Bass at a rate nearly double the previous assessment.  The 2016 catch rate surpassed the antiquated 2008 management goal which was likely based on the initial electrofishing survey.  Size structure was quality with lengths ranging from 5.1 to 19.4 inches with an average length of 13.2 inches, similar to the previous survey.  Scale analysis identified ages 2-10 present.  Growth was slow early, but similar to the statewide average by age 3.  Largemouth Bass averaged 15.1 inches by age 7. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie were sampled at a rate above what was expected for lakes similar to Bello and the previous assessment.  The trap net catch rate was within the expected range and similar to the 2007 assessment.  The 2016 trap net catch rate was similar to the lake management goals.  Size structure was favorable.  Lengths ranged from 4.7 to 11.0 inches and an average length of 8.7 inches, similar to the previous assessment.  Scale analysis identified ages 1, 3-7.  The sample size was too small to evaluate recruitment, but age 5 represented 44% of the sample.  Similar to the previous assessment, growth was slow and below the statewide averages.  Black Crappie averaged eight inches by age 5. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill were sampled at a rate within the typical range and above the previous assessment.  A modest size structure was observed with lengths from 3.4 to 8.4 inches and an average length of 5.8 inches.  Scale analysis identified ages 2-10 present with most ages represented indicating relatively consistent recruitment.  Growth was similar to the lake class averages for all ages.  Bluegill averaged almost seven inches by age 8. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike were the second most numerous species sampled in gill nets at a predictable rate but lower than the previous survey.  Size structure was favorable with some quality individuals present.  Lengths ranged from 15.0 to 36.7 inches and an average length of 22.2 inches.  Scale and bone analysis identified eight age classes, with individuals up to age 9 present.  Growth was similar to the statewide average for all ages.  Northern Pike averaged 24.9 inches by age 5. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch were sampled at a rate of 0.5/gill net below the typical range for this lake type, and similar to the last survey.  The four fish sampled had a mean length of 6.1 inches. <br> \n <br> \nTullibee were sampled at a rate of 3.5/gill net, near the lake class average.  Lengths ranged from 8.5 to 18.7 inches with a mean length of 10.7 inches.  Triaenophorus was not observed in 24 inspected Tullibee. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled included Bowfin, Brown Bullhead, Hybrid Sunfish, Pumpkinseed Sunfish, Tullibee, Rock Bass, Yellow Bullhead and Yellow Perch. <br> \n</p>",
