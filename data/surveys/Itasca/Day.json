                "narrative": "<p>Day Lake is located 17 mile north of Grand Rapids along State Highway 38 and is within the Chippewa National Forest.  This is a relatively small lake encompassing 57 surface acres, with only 22.8% littoral (<15 ft) and a maximum depth of 57 feet.  An alkalinity of 11 ppm and a mid-summer Secchi disk reading of 17.0 ft were found during this assessment.  The characteristics of Kremer Lake are most like those associated with lake class 20 (mean area=77.9 acres, max depth=55.2 ft, are 39.5% littoral, total alkalinity=25.1, and a Secchi disc reading=10.3 ft).  A temperature and oxygen profile indicated that the lake was thermally stratified from 76.1?F at the surface to 40.5?F at the bottom and the area of most rapid change (thermocline) occurred between 9 to 25 feet of water.  Dissolved oxygen levels increased in the cooler waters of the thermocline to nearly 11.0 ppm and then decreased gradually at greater water depths but remained at a level (2.3 ppm) at the bottom (57 ft) that was adequate to sustain fish (>2.0ppm).  Access consists of a short narrow trail of State Highway #38, with no turn around area at the lake. The largemouth bass population was sampled in early June using an electrofishing barge at night and the entire shoreline was sampled with 4 electrofishing stations (15-20 minutes of running time/station).  Largemouth bass were effectively sampled as 360 individuals were captured for a catch rate of 200 fish/hour.  Fish ranged from 3.1 to 16.6 inches, but consisted of predominantly small fish, as their mean length was 8.1 inches. Age analysis indicated fish from ages 1 to 8 were present and age-2 and age-4 fish were most abundant.  Growth rates for all age groups were slightly lower than the statewide average, but were a within 15% of the average.  Largemouth bass reach a quality size of 12 inches at age-5 in Day Lake.  Yellow perch were the most abundant species in the gill nets, with a catch rate of 29.7 fish/set. The catch exceeded the expected range for similar lakes in the same lake class (20).  Although yellow perch observed during fieldwork appeared to be more slender than usual, the mean length and weight was 9.4 inches and 0.3 lbs, respectively.  The length-weight relationship was similar to that for perch in Lake Winnibigoshish.  The yellow perch catch consisted of fish from ages 2 to 8 with 90% of the fish from ages 4 to 7.  Growth rates for all age groups slightly exceeded the statewide means, but they were still within 15% of the mean length values.  Yellow perch averaged 10.3 inches in 7 years in this lake, which was similar to other lakes statewide (10.0 inches in 7 years).  The bluegill catch was low with a trap-net catch of 1.6 fish/net, which was below the expected range for similar lakes in lake class 20.  Although the total bluegill sample was small (14 fish), ageing indicated that they were either age 4 or 5.  These fish had growth rates for each age class that were slightly above those for other bluegill populations in lake class 20 but were within 15% of the lake class means.The black crappie catch rate was low and only 4 fish were captured in all types of gear. Size structure was poor with lengths varying from 3.8 to 6.5 inches.This lake survey included an inventory of the aquatic plants from the water's edge out to 20 feet.  A total of 44 plant species, 34 emergent and 10 submerged, were identified from 10 transects equally spaced around the lake.  Cattails, arrowhead, and sedges were the most common emergent plants growing near or at the water's edge.   Water shield, which grows in low alkaline lakes, was the most predominant floating-leaf plant and formed a band along with white water lilies around most of the shoalwaters.  The submerged plant community extended out beyond the band of floating-leaf plants to a depth of 20 feet due to good water clarity, which allows good light penetration.  Species growing in the deeper depths included slender naiad, water starwort, quillwort, largeleaf, ribbonleaf and river pondweeds, and water celery.  Water moss, which thrives in the lowest light conditions in clear lakes, was found growing in a narrow segment at the deepest end of most transects.  Due to federal ownership of the entire shoreline this will protect the immediate shoreline and the adjacent aquatic habitat from the intrusive effects of human development.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Day Lake is located about 17 miles north of Grand Rapids.  The public access does not have room to park or turn around, which likely limits angler use.  The access, lake and fish community may be more suited to anglers fishing from a canoe or kayak.  Fish populations are particularly vulnerable to angler overharvest in lakes like Day Lake due to the small size. <br> \n <br> \nThe 2004 lake management plan (LMP) indicates Yellow Perch and Largemouth Bass were the primary species of management with Bluegill as a secondary species.  The LMP goals include maintaining a catch rate at 20 Yellow Perch/gill net, with 60 and 30% of the sample longer than 8 and 10 inches.  There was also a goal to maintain a catch for Largemouth Bass of 80/hour of electrofishing.  Due to the small size of the lake (57 acres) only two gill nets and eight trap nets were set. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie catch rates improved from nearly non-existent in 2003 to above average for lakes similar to Day Lake in 2019.  The trap net sampled fish ranged from 4.1 to 9.4 inches and averaged 6.8 inches while the gill net sampled fish ranged from 7.1 to 10.3 inches and averaged 8.8 inches.  Growth was similar to other class 20 lakes with fish averaging 7.9 inches after four years.  Due to the Black Crappie poor size distribution and condition, anglers most likely would not target this population. <br> \n <br> \nThough Bluegill were mentioned as secondary species for management, only three were sampled in 2019.  The fish ranged from 5 to 6 inches and were all from the 2015 year class.  The Bluegill population is not likely providing much of a fishery for anglers. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass were not sampled with electrofishing due to a lack of time and the poor access.  As a result, the management goal could not be evaluated.  The bass sampled by gill nets ranged from 9.7 to 13.2 inches and averaged 11.9 inches.  The fish were predominantly age 4 or 6 and averaged 12.5 inches after six years of growth.  The abundant Largemouth Bass population may attract anglers interested in high catch rates. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch catches have consistently been high for this lake class.  In 2019, the catch was 22.5 fish/gill net.  The population met or exceeded the management goals.  The sampled perch ranged from 5.8 to 13.1 inches and averaged 8.8 inches.  The largest age class was age 3 but fish from age 3 to age 17 were sampled.  Interestingly, 20% of the sample were age 10 or older and only one male was sampled.  The size and age structure would suggest there is limited fishing pressure directed at Yellow Perch. <br> \n   <br> \nAnother interesting observation was that perch had a high infestation of an internal grub, as well as yellow grub.  The internal grub did not appear to be the common yellow grub observed for many species.  These grubs were primarily observed on the ovaries.  It was unclear what affect they had on the health of the Yellow Perch. <br> \n  <br> \nOther species observed during the survey included Hybrid Sunfish and Pumpkinseed Sunfish. <br> \n</p>",
