                "narrative": "<p>Glacier Lake is a 133 acre lake of low fertility.  The lake is located in northern Aitkin County just northeast of Big Sandy Lake off County Road 14.  The immediate shoreline surrounding the lake is minimally developed along the east and south shores with the remaining shoreline characterized by the following: undeveloped steep hills covered with mixed hardwoods and large conifers, spruce bogs, and marshland.  Past management has included some fish stocking, but this has not occurred since the late sixties due to the lake's small size, lack of a public access, and self sustaining game fish population.  Currently, the lake is primarily managed for northern pike and bluegill sunfish with largemouth bass and walleye as the secondary management species.During the open water season of 2001, a fish population assessment was conducted to evaluate the current status of the fishery in Glacier Lake.  Sampling gear types included gill and trap nets.  Northern pike abundance and average size (2.2 pounds) were within a normal range for this type of lake.  Measured northern pike ranged from 12.6 to 33.7 inches with an average length of 18.1 inches.  Growth of northern pike was slow at ages 1-2 and normal thereafter.  The number of bluegill sunfish and black crappie sampled were at normal levels, but the average size for both species were small.  Their lengths extended from 2.9 to 8.7 and 4.5 to 10.2 inches, respectively.  Panfish growth was slow until age six for both species and normal thereafter.  Two largemouth bass that were 5.5 and 15.4 inches in length were captured.  Since the sampling methods utilized are not the most effective for sampling largemouth bass, the sampled fish probably do not adequately represent the true population.  Walleye were first sampled by the DNR in 1991.  These fish or their ancestry may have originated in Big Sandy Lake and entered Glacier Lake via Highland Creek during high water periods.  Walleye were again sampled in 2001 with their abundance and average weight at normal levels for lakes of this type.  Ages 5, 6, and 10 were sampled with their lengths between 16.0 and 22.0 inches.  The sampled fish community also consisted of bowfin (dog fish), brown and yellow bullhead, hybrid sunfish, pumpkinseed sunfish, and rock bass.  Anglers seeking a peaceful, relaxing, aesthetically pleasing fishing experience supplemented by the possibility of catching a memorable sized northern pike, largemouth bass, or pumpkinseed sunfish may want to visit Glacier Lake.  An abundance of smaller bluegill sunfish and black crappie could also be encountered along with an occassional walleye.  Since Glacier Lake does not have a public access, fishing enthusiasts will have to obtain permission from a private land owner to gain access to this lake.  Anglers are encouraged to be selective when they harvest fish by keeping the smaller ones for eating and releasing the larger ones.  Releasing the larger fish will help maintain or enhance the current quality and provide future angling opportunities for other people who would like to experience catching a quality sized fish.  Lakeshore property owners and land owners within the surrounding watershed can maintain the current good water quality of Glacier Lake by protecting or re-establishing buffer strips along the shoreline of the lake with native plants; updating outdated or failing septic systems; using only phosphorus free fertilizer (if needed) on lawns, gardens, or crop land; utilizing farming practices that reduce run-off; limiting aquatic plant removal or disturbance; and limiting construction of impervious surfaces near the shoreline.</p>",

Northern pike (38 of 39 aged) ranged from one to eight plus years of age with a strong year class indicated for 1987.  Almost one third of the northern pike sampled were eight years old or older.  Growth rates were slower than normal for annual increments after age four.  Bluegill (52 of 255 aged) ranged from three to eight plus years of age with strong year classes indicated for 1984, 1986 and 1988.  Growth rates for the first, second third and fourth annual increments were slower than normal.  Black crappie (26 of 28 aged) ranged from two to eight years of age. Growth rates were slow for all annual increments checked.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Glacier Lake is a small, 133 acre lake located in northern Aitkin County about 5 miles east of Libby and within Savanna State Forest.  About half of the shoreline is in state ownership, primarily woody wetlands along the west side of the lake.  The picturesque nature of the lake has been maintained in part due to the steep topography of the eastern shoreline which has kept structures set back further from the water.  A carry-in type public water access is currently (2012) being developed to provide access to the lake while maintaining the tranquil setting.   <br> \n <br> \nA 2011 survey of the fish community revealed healthy populations of a variety of popular game fish species.  Northern pike were captured in average numbers (5.2/gill net) and ranged from 11.1 to 33.3 inches, with a respectable average size of 21.3 inches and 2.4 pounds.  While catching large pike (greater than 24 inches) can be exhilarating, anglers are encouraged to release large fish due to their role in maintaining quality size structure of many species, and to maximize the sporting benefit for multiple anglers by recycling these quality fish. <br> \n <br> \nAbundance of bluegill and black crappie were within the normal range for this type of lake and similar to previous surveys.  Bluegill captured in trap nets ranged from 3.0 to 8.3 inches, but only 12% measured over seven inches long.  Likewise, the catch of black crappie in standard sampling gear included a variety of sizes, ranging from 4.8 to 11.0 inches, but fish greater than nine inches made up just 15% of the sample.   <br> \n <br> \nSpring night electrofishing was conducted on Glacier Lake for the first time in 2011, to survey the abundance and size structure of the largemouth bass population.  A total of 40 fish were captured in 1 hour of sampling, suggesting ample opportunities for this popular species.  Size ranged from 3.7 to 16.4 inches with an average of 11.4 inches and 1.0 pounds.   <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled in 2011 included bowfin (dogfish), hybrid sunfish, walleye, yellow bullhead, and yellow perch.  Walleye have been caught in low numbers in each survey since 1991.  These fish could have migrated to the lake from Big Sandy during unique hydrologic conditions, or be the result of non-DNR management activities.  A single yellow perch was caught in a gill net in 2011, which was the first time this species was captured in survey gear. <br> \n <br> \nIn addition to the standard survey work, IBI (Index of Biotic Integrity) sampling was also conducted in 2011.  IBI sampling included backpack electrofishing and seining to more broadly sample the general fish community and develop a fish-based index of overall lake health.  Shoreline seining proved to be difficult due to the lake's morphology and presence of large amounts of woody habitat along shore. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Glacier Lake is a small, 133-acre lake located in northern Aitkin County about 5 miles east of Libby and within Savanna State Forest.  About half of the shoreline is in state ownership, primarily woody wetlands along the west side of the lake.  The picturesque nature of the lake has been maintained in part due to the steep topography of the eastern shoreline which has kept structures set back further from the water.  A carry-in type public water access is available to provide access to the lake while maintaining the tranquil setting.   <br> \n <br> \nA 2021 survey of the fish community revealed healthy populations of a variety of popular game fish species.  Northern Pike were captured in average numbers (4.0/gill net) and ranged from 15.3 to 30.7 inches, with a respectable average size of 23.0 inches and 2.7 pounds.  While catching large pike (greater than 26 inches) can be exhilarating, anglers are encouraged to practice selective harvest  due to their role in maintaining quality size structure of many species, and to maximize the sporting benefit for multiple anglers by recycling these quality fish. <br> \n <br> \nAbundance of Bluegill and Black Crappie were within the normal range for this type of lake and similar to previous surveys.  Bluegill captured in trap nets ranged from 3.0 to 7.9 inches, but only 16 percent measured over seven inches long.  There were some Hybrid Sunfish that exceeded 8 inches.  Likewise, the catch of Black Crappie in standard sampling gear included a variety of sizes, ranging from 4.2 to 9.7 inches, but fish greater than nine inches made up just 15 percent of the sample.   <br> \n <br> \nA handful of Largemouth Bass were caught in the survey nets in 2021. They measured 8 to 16 inches long.  The 2011 electrofishing survey suggested a reasonable population of Largemouth Bass, with good expectations for angling.  Electrofishing was not conducted this time due to staffing and time constraints.  <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled in 2021 included Bowfin (dogfish), Pumpkinseed, Rock Bass and Yellow Bullhead.  Walleye have been caught in low numbers in most surveys, although none were sampled this time around.   <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of nearshore fish species in Glacier Lake was conducted on June 30, 2021, by Aitkin Area Fisheries Staff. Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake, and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible.   Backpack electrofishing was completed at all ten sampling stations. Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample two stations, a 15-foot seine was used at six stations and site conditions prevented the use of seines at two stations. Nearshore sampling captured 8 species of fish including one species that is intolerant of disturbance (i.e., Iowa Darter). <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore data were combined with trap net and gill net data from a June 2021 survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based Index of Biotic Integrity (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment. In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g., Rock Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g., Black Bullhead). The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.  <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Mississippi River-Grand Rapids Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency. <br> \n</p>",
