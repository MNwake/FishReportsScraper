Significant fishing pressure was observed during the winter of 2013-2014 and this special assessment was conducted to determine the status of the tullibee population following this intense pressure.  The tullibee catch rate was 54.0 per gill net.  This is the highest ever recorded for this lake.  The lowest recorded tullibee catch rate was 23.0 per gill net in 1988.  This is well above the upper quartile value of 4.8/gill net for the lake class.  The average length of tullibee from this special assessment was 15.0\" with fish as large as 18.2\" measured.  It appears that this population of tullibee in Pillager Lake was able to withstand the extremely high fishing pressure during the winter of 2013-2014. <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species sampled during the special assessment were black crappie, bluegill, largemouth bass, northern pike, walleye, white sucker, and yellow perch. <br> \n</p>",

It has a park, swimming beach, fishing pier, and public access all at one location on the SW corner.  Recent surveys suggest fishing for Tullibee (Cisco) is one of the better options available to anglers. <br> \n <br> \nTullibee (Cisco) were caught in high numbers (43.5/gill net) as they have been in every survey on record.  Average size of these fish is 13.1\".  While Tullibee (Cisco) are currently considered a rough fish with no limit, anglers are asked to show restraint as to protect this unique opportunity. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill numbers were average (15.2/gill net), but size wasn't great.  Average size was 5.3\" and 20% of the fish were 7\" or larger. <br> \n <br> \nWalleyes are stocked in odd number years as fry, but net catches have gone down for the last five surveys.  No walleyes were captured in 2023. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike were also caught in low numbers for this type of lake at 2.7/gill net.  Average size was 23.8\" with 31% above the 22-26\" protected slot. <br> \n <br> \nOther species such as Black Crappie (0.3/gill net), Yellow Perch (0.2/gill net), and largemouth bass (0.1/trap net) were caught in very low numbers as they have been for several surveys.   <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Pillager is a 206 acre lake located several miles north of the City of Pillager, in Cass County.  In 1997 there were 14 homes/cabins located along the lake's 2.4 miles of shoreline.  There was a township-owned public access located on the southwest corner of the lake, off of CSAH No. 1.  Maximum water depth is 39 feet and about 35% of the surface area is less than 15 feet deep.  It is a hardwater lake with low phosphorus fertility.  Water clarity was about average for area lakes in 1997.The aquatic plant community was fairly diverse in 1997.  Emergent species are important for controlling nutrient levels and minimizing shore erosion caused by wave action.  Species like  bulrush enhance the quality of spawning habitat for largemouth bass and several panfish species.  Wild rice can provide additional spawning habitat for northern pike.  Submerged and floating leafed species provide food and cover for a wide variety of aquatic species.Test netting was conducted in summer, 1997.  The catch of tullibee was in the \"high\" category when compared to similar type lakes.  Catches of northern pike, walleye and bowfin (dogfish) were in the \"low\" category.The northern pike catch was \"low\" in '97, however catches have been \"low\" in three of the five nettings done on this lake.  The walleye catch was also in the \"low\" category.  Stocking was discontinued in '93.  Eighteen year of stocking, using a variety of fish sizes, failed to produce a satisfactory walleye fishery, as measured by gill net catch.  Largemouth bass were caught in \"average\" numbers, similar to past catches.Bluegill numbers dropped into the \"average\" category, after being in the \"high\" category in three of the previous four nettings.  Eight age classes were sampled and growth was slow.  The strongest year classes were from 1992 and 1994.  About 17% of measured bluegills were 7.0 inches or more in length in 1997.Yellow perch were absent from gill nets but were caught in \"average\" numbers in trap nets.  Tullibees were present in \"high\" numbers and most fish were 16-18 inches long.  Past tullibee catches have all been in the \"high\" category.  White sucker, another important forage species was caught in \"average\" numbers.  Other species sampled in \"97 included \"low\" numbers of bowfin (dogfish) and black bullhead.  Pumpkinseed, rock bass and brown bullhead catches were all \"average\" when compared to similar type lakes.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Present Fish Population Status: The test netting on Pillager Lake indicated average populations of bowfin, northern cisco, northern pike, yellow bullhead, rock bass, pumpkinseed, bluegill, largemouth bass and walleye.  Low populations of white sucker and yellow perch were indicated.  These population estimates were compared with medians of Lake Group 4 in the Brainerd Area.The individual lengths of the northern pike sampled ranged from 25 to 40 inches.  Ages represented were IV,V,VI and VIII.  Pillager Lake is connected to a rice bed for excellent northern pike spawning and one could assume that the younger fish remain there for the summer since no young fish (ages I,II, or III) were sampled in the nets.Age classes 1 thru 5 of largemouth bass were sampled and average growths were indicated.  Individual lengths ranged from 4 to 15 inches.Yellow perch were only sampled in the trapnets so population comparisons can be made with similiar lakes in the area.  the fish sampled in the trapnets were aged and ages III,IV and V were represented.  Growth rates appeared slow when you compare with statewide growth rates.  Length frequencies ranged from 6 to 8 inches.Three age groups (III,V, and VI) of walleyes were sampled during the netting.  Three year old fish exhibited slow growth rates.  Lengths ranged from 10 to 24 inches.Northern cisco from 12 to 16 inches were sampled during the netting.  A population of 23/lift is near the third quartile of 23.83/lift for Lake Group 4 of the Brainerd Area.Yellow bullheads were present in average numbers (3.2/lift) and length frequencies of 9 to 12 inches.</p>",
