                "narrative": "<p>Upper Sakatah Lake is strongly influenced by the Cannon River, which is its major inlet and outlet.  Most game fish populations are found in below area medians, while most non-game fish populations are found in above area medians of abundance.Black crappie averaged 1.50/trap net, compared to 4.75/trap net in 1981.  Black crappies are represented by I-IV age classes, compared to I-IV and VI age classes present in 1981.  White crappies now average 2.00/trap net, compared to no fish sampled in 1981.  White crappies are represented by a strong II age class and fewer III age class fish.Bluegills have increased from 5.62/trap net in 1981 to 8.62/trap net in 1986.  The present bluegill population has a strong III and IV age classes and fewer V-VII aged fish.  Bluegills in 1981 were represented by I-IV age classes with a dominant II age class.Northern pike were sampled in below area medians, averaging 1.64/gill net compared to 2.00/gill net in 1981.  Northerns are represented by I-V age classes with II age class fish dominating the catch.  Younger fish dominated the northern catch in 1981, with I-III year classes present.  In the 1981 survey, I and II age classes showed the greatest strength.Walleyes have increased from 0.17/gill net in 1981 to 2.54/gill net in the 1986 netting.  The present walleye population is evenly distributed from 7.5-17.9 inches.  Walleyes are represented by II-VI age classes with II and III age classes showing the most strength.  Walleyes sampled are probably migrants from Tetonka Lake, because no walleyes have been stocked in recent years.Channel catfish averaged 0.25/trap net, compared to 0.37/trap net in 1981.  Catfish sampled in 1981 were much larger than the two sampled in 1986.White bass have declined in abundance from 3.92/gill net in 1981 to 1.45/gill net in 1986.  White bass were represented by a dominant III age class and a few IV age class fish in 1981 and 1986 surveys.  Length frequencies indicate slightly larger fish present in 1986 than in 1981.Yellow perch now average 2.36/gill net compared to 0.25/gill net in 1981.Non-game fish populations are well represented in Upper Sakatah Lake with good catches of freshwater drum, carp, black bullhead, and white sucker.</p>",

All sizes of walleye are present, with 12.0-16.0 inches most abundant.  Walleye fry are stocked 3 out of 4 years.  Yellow perch are found in average numbers, with many fish exceeding 9.0 inches.  Panfish numbers are low, and angling has been poor for a long time.  Northern pike numbers are average for area waters, with all sizes present up to 33.0 inches.  Black bullheads, at times very abundant, are present in moderate numbers.Because of Upper Sakatah's shallow, fertile nature, it supports significant populations of carp, bigmouth buffalo, freshwater drum, white sucker, bowfin, white bass, and green sunfish.  Seasonal fish movement is common due to the influence of the Cannon River.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Upper Sakatah Lake in Le Sueur County is a 881 acre lake located east of the city of Waterville. A public access is located in the city of Waterville on the Cannon River, before it flows into Sakatah Bay, the western basin of Upper Sakatah Lake. There is also a public access located inside Sakatah State Park on the southern shoreline of the lake.  <br> \n <br> \nA state park daily or annual vehicle permit is required for park admittance. The lake is accessible from the bridge between Upper and Lower Sakatah on Leroy Avenue. The Cannon River flows through Upper Sakatah Lake from Tetonka Lake, and downstream into Lower Sakatah Lake. It then continues on through the city of Morristown and further east to Cannon Lake. Sakatah State Park is located on the south shoreline of most of Upper Sakatah Lake. With purchase of a state park permit, a resident may take fish by angling (in open water) without an angling license when shore fishing or wading on state-owned land within a state park. Because Sakatah State Park does not encompass the entire shoreline of Upper or Lower Sakatah State Park, the angling license exemption does not extend to residents angling from a boat or float; those anglers must still purchase an angling license. <br> \n <br> \nUpper Sakatah Lake was surveyed the week of August 3rd, 2009 to monitor the fish community and aquatic habitat. Black bullheads are notable for their decline in abundance from 2004. During the 2004 assessment, black bullheads averaged 117 fish per gill net lift. In 2009, black bullheads averaged 9 fish per gill net lift.  <br> \n <br> \nBluegills were the most abundant game fish in gill and trap net catches, at 8.1 and 7.1 respectively per lift. Average size of bluegills is very poor, at 4.3 inches for all fish measured. Three percent of fish sampled were larger than 7 inches in length. Black crappies continue to maintain a low level abundance in Sakatah. Black crappies averaged 5.2 inches in length and averaged 3.4 fish per gill net lift. <br> \n <br> \nWhite bass averaged just over 10 fish per gill net lift. White bass are found throughout the Cannon River chain of lakes. Length ranged from 5 to 16 inches, with an average length of 12.6 inches. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch abundance has increased since the 2004 assessment, from 10 to 27 per gill net lift. Also in that time size has decreased from an average weight of 0.45 pounds per fish to 0.22 pounds per fish. 22 percent of fish sampled in gill nets were larger than 9 inches. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike maintain a low level of abundance at just over two fish per gill net lift. Pike size ranged from 18 to 31 inches, with an average of 25 inches. Upper Sakatah is a popular darkhouse spearing lake because of its shallow water and often clear winter waters; many shanties are found across the lake with many concentrated along the distinct point/bar on the north end of the lake. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye, like northern pike, maintain a low level of abundance on Upper Sakatah. Walleye average 3 fish per gill net lift, ranging in size from 7 to 18 inches with an average of 12.6 inches. Upper Sakatah is stocked with walleye fry three out of four years. <br> \n <br> \nTwo channel catfish were caught during the survey. Channel catfish are found throughout lakes in the Cannon River chain. Both were large individuals, one at 27 inches and the other at 32 inches total length. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass were sampled using a boom electrofishing boat in late May. Bass averaged 65 fish per hour of on-time. Average length was 12 inches, with an average weight of 1.4 pounds. Size ranged from four to eighteen inches, with most fish concentrated between 14 and 16 inches. Largemouth bass do well in Upper and Lower Sakatah, in part because of the minimal shoreline development and fair amount of coarse woody debris in the water.  <br> \n <br> \nOther fish observed in the survey include bigmouth buffalo, bowfin (dogfish), common carp, freshwater drum, golden shiner, green sunfish, white sucker, and yellow bullhead. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers can help maintain or improve the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest. Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for table fare, but encourages release of medium- to large-sized fish. Releasing these fish can help maintain balance in the fish community in Upper Sakatah Lake and provide anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future.  <br> \n <br> \nShoreline areas on the land and into the shallow water provide essential habitat for fish and wildlife that live in or near Minnesota's lakes. Overdeveloped shorelines cannot support the fish, wildlife, and clean water that are associated with natural undeveloped lakes. Shoreline habitat consists of aquatic plants, woody plants, and natural lake bottom soils.  <br> \n <br> \nPlants in the water and at the water's edge provide habitat, prevent erosion, and absorb excess nutrients. Shrubs, trees, and woody debris such as fallen trees or limbs provide good habitat both above and below the water and should be left in place. By leaving a buffer strip of natural vegetation along the shoreline, property owners can reduce erosion, help maintain water quality, and provide habitat and travel corridors for wildlife.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Introduction <br> \nUpper Sakatah Lake is an 881 acre lake located in Le Sueur County east of the town of Waterville. A city-owned public access is located within the town of Waterville on the Cannon River, before it flows into the west bay of Upper Sakatah Lake. There is also an access located inside Sakatah Lake State Park off MN-60. Upper Sakatah Lake has a maximum depth of 12 feet. Upper Sakatah Lake is managed primarily for walleye and secondarily for northern pike. Walleye fry are stocked three out of every four years at a rate of 1,500 fry per littoral acre. Northern pike fry (N = 100,00) are stocked annually into a marsh area, which is connected the lake. Based in lake characteristics and limnological variables, Upper Sakatah Lake is classified in Lake Class 41. Other area lakes with this classification include Cannon Lake (Rice County), Lura Lake (Blue Earth County), and Elysian Lake (Waseca County). Upper Sakatah Lake was surveyed the week of August 4, 2014 as part of a regular monitoring program conducted by Minnesota DNR. This survey was intended to assess the fish community by deploying gill nets and trap nets, as well as recording water quality parameters. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye <br> \nWalleye abundance in Upper Sakatah Lake has been steadily decreasing since it was at peak abundance in 1994 (17.3 fish/gill net). The 2014 walleye catch rate of 1.3 fish/gill net was below the long-term average of 6.6 fish/gill net. Walleye lengths ranged from 9.3 to 21.1 inches and averaged 15.8 inches, indicating a relatively small size structure. Walleye were recently stocked in Upper Sakatah Lake in 2012, 2013, and 2014. Following the base stocking plan of fry stocking three out of every four years, walleye will not be stocked again until 2016.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike <br> \nNorthern pike catch rates in Upper Sakatah Lake have remained relatively stable since 1981, hovering around the long-term lake average of 1.7 fish/gill net. The 2014 survey yielded a higher catch rate of 2.8 fish/gill net, which is the highest catch rate in recent years. Northern pike lengths ranged from 18.1 to 32.8 inches and averaged 23.2 inches, indicating a moderately low size structure. Northern pike in southern Minnesota have relatively fast growth rates, especially in early life. For example, the average length of two year old northern pike from Upper Sakatah Lake was 21.7 inches. Northern pike fry (N = 100,000) are stocked into a connected marsh every year to sustain the population in Upper Sakatah Lake. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch <br> \nYellow perch were the most abundant fish species sampled from gill nets in the 2014 survey, with a catch rate of 7.8 fish/net. However, this was below the long-term average for yellow perch catch rates in Upper Sakatah Lake (9.6 fish/net). The 2014 catch rate was a steep drop from that of the previous survey completed in 2009, which was a record high 26.5 fish/net. Yellow perch lengths ranged from 5.3 to 10.7 inches and averaged 7.2 inches, indicating a small size structure of yellow perch. These small yellow perch sizes are typical of the Cannon River chain of lakes. Yellow perch are only stocked after winterkill events and have not been stocked in recent years, so the current population is sustained through natural recruitment. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie <br> \nBlack crappie abundance has been variable in Upper Sakatah Lake, ranging from 5.0 fish/net in 1999 to 0.4 fish/net in 2004. The 2014 catch rate of 2.0 fish/net was close to the long-term lake average of 2.2 fish/net. Black crappie are not stocked in Upper Sakatah Lake, so abundance is dependent on spawning success from year to year, as well as recruitment from other lakes along the Cannon River chain. The length of black crappie ranged from 4.8 to 6.6 inches and averaged 5.5 inches, which indicates that the black crappie population in Upper Sakatah Lake is small. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill <br> \nSimilarly to black crappie, the bluegill abundance in Upper Sakatah Lake has varied considerably throughout the survey years. The 2014 trap net catch rate dropped considerably from that of 2009 (7.1 fish/net) to only 0.1 fish/net. Six bluegill were also collected in gill nets (0.8 fish/net). Bluegill from both gear types ranged in length from 3.5 to 8.3 inches and averaged 6.2 inches. Given the low abundance and small size structure of bluegill in Upper Sakatah Lake, other lakes in the area are likely better bluegill fishing options.  <br> \n <br> \nWhite Bass  <br> \nIn surveys conducted from 1999 to 2009, the white bass catch rate averaged 14.7 fish/gill net. In 2014, the catch rate dropped to 3.3 fish/gill net. The length of white bass was impressive, ranging from 8.6 to 15.9 inches and averaging 13.7 inches, indicating a large size structure for white bass. White bass are not stocked in Upper Sakatah Lake, so the current population is sustained through natural reproduction. <br> \n <br> \nOther Species <br> \nBlack and yellow bullhead are present in Upper Sakatah Lake in relatively low abundance. The black bullhead gill net catch rate in 2014 was 3.0 fish/net and lengths averaged 13.0 inches, so the size structure is comprised of larger individuals. Yellow bullheads were sampled in gill nets at a rate of 0.6 fish/net and averaged 12.6 inches. Other fish species collected in the 2014 survey included channel catfish (N = 6), freshwater drum (N = 188), bowfin (N = 46), common carp (N = 37), white sucker (N = 3), and pumpkinseed (N = 1). <br> \n <br> \nAnglers can play an important role in maintaining or improving a fish population by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for consumption, while encouraging the release of medium to large fish that may contribute to natural recruitment.  This practice helps maintain balance in the fish community and provides anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future.  Additionally, smaller fish often taste better and have fewer contaminants than larger, older fish from the same water body. <br> \n <br> \nShoreline property owners also play an important role in the overall health of an aquatic ecosystem, including the fish population.  Natural shorelines, including vegetation, woody debris, and bottom substrates, provide valuable habitat for fish and wildlife, help maintain water quality, and reduce bank erosion.  By leaving natural shorelines unaltered or restoring them to natural conditions, shoreline property owners are doing their part to maintain or improve a healthy ecosystem in the lake and protect the resource for future generations. <br> \n</p>",

The lake has two popular public shore-fishing sites, one in Waterville at the State Highway 13 bridge and another at the LeSeuer County Road 99 bridge between Upper and Lower Sakatah lake.  Locals report excellent fishing there for walleye, perch, and panfish into mid-summer and again in the fall.  There is also a fishing pier located in Sakatah State Park just east of Waterville.  High numbers of walleye in the 12 to 15 inch size range should provide excellent fishing in the coming year.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Upper Sakatah Lake is an 881-acre lake located on the east side of the town of Waterville in Le Sueur County. It has a maximum depth of 12 feet. A boat access is located in Sakatah State Park on the south shore but it can also be accessed via the Cannon River. Upper Sakatah Lake is primarily managed for Walleye and secondarily for Bluegill, Black Crappie, and Northern Pike. The current management plan calls for stocking 500 Walleye fry/littoral acre (n = 440,500) annually. A 50:50 mix of LMS and MIS strain fry are stocked to accommodate the ongoing research project involving Cannon River Walleye stocks. Upper Sakatah Lake is designated as a Tier-2 Lake and will be surveyed as part of a regularly scheduled monitoring program at a frequency of every 6 years.  <br> \n <br> \nA targeted survey was completed the week of August 3, 2020 using 8 gill nets. Trap nets and spring boat electrofishing targeting Largemouth Bass were not completed due to COVID-19 restrictions. Water quality parameters were also measured. Results of this survey can be compared to historical standard surveys because standardized methods were used. <br> \n <br> \nA total of 85 Walleyes were sampled for a catch rate of 10.6/net, indicating moderate to high numbers were present. In the three surveys prior to 2020 Walleye numbers were on a downward trend with catch rate of 5.0/net in 2004, 3.1/net in 2009, and 1.3/net in 2014. Since 1994, catch rates have varied from 1.3/net to 17.3/net with an average of 8.8/net. Lengths in 2020 ranged from 8.8 to 23.4 inches with an average of 12.8 inches. Approximately 25% of Walleye sampled were greater than 15 inches. Ages ranged from 1 to 6 years old with 5 year classes present. Approximately 95% of Walleye sampled were 1 or 2 years old. Growth was rapid with 17 inches exceeded by year 3. The fast growing 2018 and 2019 year classes should provide a welcome quality opportunity for anglers in coming years after experiencing a slump in Walleye numbers over the past 15 years or so. <br> \n <br> \nA total of 19 Bluegills ranging from 3.7 to 6.6 inches were sampled with the gill nets for a catch rate of 2.4/net. Bluegills are better sampled with trap nets and caution should be used before drawing conclusions about the Bluegill population in Upper Sakatah Lake using the 2020 survey. <br> \n <br> \nA total of 77 Black Crappies were sampled for a catch rate of 9.6/net, indicating moderate to high numbers were present. This was the highest catch rate from 1994 to 2020 (n = 6). The average during that time was just 3.5/net. Lengths in 2020 ranged from 2.6 to 11.9 inches with an average of 7.0 inches. Approximately 31% of Black Crappies sampled were larger than 8 inches and just 1% were larger than 10 inches. With the exception of one 6 year old fish, all were 1 or 2 years old. Growth was fast with fish reaching around 7 inches between year 2 and 3. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike were sampled in low numbers in 2020 with a total of 14 caught for a catch rate of 1.8/net, indicating low numbers were present. This was right at the 1994 to 2020 average catch rate of 1.8/net. The previous catch rate of 2.9/net in 2014 represented the high mark for that time. Lengths in 2020 ranged from 19.5 to 34.1 inches with an average of 25.4 inches. Most Northern Pike sampled were larger than 21 inches and approximately 75% of the sample exceeded the legal minimum length limit of 24 inches. Ages ranged from 1 to 5 years old with 6 year classes present. Growth was fast with fish surpassing 22 inches around year 2. Upper Sakatah Lake is located in the Southern Northern Pike management zone. In order to harvest a Northern Pike the fish must be over 24.0 inches in length.  The daily bag limit in this zone is 2 Northern Pike per day. <br> \nYellow Perch were common in 2020 with a catch rate of 17.6/net, indicating high numbers were present. From 1994 to 2020, catch rates have varied from 7.8/net to 26.5/net with an average of 13.5/net. The previous catch rate was 7.8/net in 2014. Lengths ranged from 5.4 to 11.2 inches with an average of 7.3 inches. Only 26% of Yellow Perch sampled exceeded 8 inches and 2% exceeded 10 inches. Ages ranged from 1 to 3 years old with 3 year classes present. The 2019 year class accounted for 70% of the sample. Growth was moderate with a length of 7.2 inches reached by year 2. <br> \n <br> \nWhite Bass remained a common member of the Upper Sakatah fish community in 2020. A total of 133 White Bass ranging from 4.7 to 17.3 inches were sampled at a rate of 16.6/net, indicating high numbers were present. From 1994 to 2020, catch rates varied from 3.3/net to 17.2/net with an average of 11.3/net. Although most of the 2020 sample was small and young, there were fish in the 13 to 18 inch range that offer an additional target for anglers. <br> \n <br> \nA total of 55 Freshwater Drum were sampled at a rate of 6.9/net. The long term average catch rate was 12.5/net between 1994 and 2020. Lengths ranged from 3.1 to 19.1 inches with an average of 12.1 inches. Freshwater Drum are often caught by anglers while targeting other species. For the open-minded angler, they offer an additional fishing target and are surprisingly good table fare. <br> \n <br> \nJust a single Black Bullhead was sampled in 2020 for a catch rate of 0.1/net. Catch rates have fallen dramatically in recent surveys with catch rates of 116.7/net in 2004, 9.1/net in 2009, and 3.0/net in 2014. Typically, Black Bullheads are abundant in lakes like Upper Sakatah but the lack of winterkill events in recent years has prevented Black Bullheads from producing dominant year classes in Upper Sakatah Lake. <br> \n <br> \nCommon Carp were sampled at a rate of 1.3/net, which was below the long term average of 1.8/net. High Common Carp numbers are detrimental to lake water quality and habitat but they appear mostly stable at moderate to low numbers in Upper Sakatah Lake. <br> \n <br> \nOther Species sampled in 2020 include Bigmouth Buffalo, Bowfin (dogfish), Golden Shiner, Largemouth Bass, and White Sucker. <br> \n <br> \nWater clarity was poor with a secchi depth of 1.8 feet. Dissolved oxygen and water temperature readings ranged from 10.4 ppm and 76.1 degrees Fahrenheit at the surface to 8.7 ppm and 76.5 degrees Fahrenheit at 12 feet. No thermocline was detected due to the shallow, windswept nature of the lake. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers can play an important role in maintaining or improving a fish population by practicing selective harvest. Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for consumption, while encouraging the release of medium to large fish that may contribute to natural reproduction. This practice helps maintain balance in the fish populations and provides anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future. Additionally, smaller fish often taste better and have fewer contaminants than larger, older fish from the same water body. <br> \n <br> \nShoreline property owners also play an important role in the overall health of an aquatic ecosystem, including the fish population. Natural shorelines, including vegetation, woody debris, and bottom substrates, provide valuable habitat for fish and wildlife, help maintain water quality, and reduce bank erosion. Cattails and bulrushes are particularly beneficial for fish spawning, rearing, and feeding. By leaving natural shorelines unaltered or restoring them to natural conditions, shoreline property owners are doing their part to maintain or improve a healthy ecosystem in the lake and protect the resource for future generations. <br> \n <br> \n- Sky Wigen, Fisheries Specialist <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Upper Sakatah Lake is located east of the City of Waterville in southeastern Le Sueur County.  Sakatah Lake State Park is located along the south shore of the lake.  Camping, a boat ramp, a fishing pier, as well as hiking and bicycle trails are all available in the park.  Access is also available from the boat launch on the Cannon River in Waterville, between Tetonka and Upper Sakatah lakes.  A fishery survey was conducted on Upper Sakatah Lake in 2004 to assess the fish community and aquatic habitat.  Black bullhead were the most abundant species in both the gill net and trap net catches.  Seven to 8 inch bullhead were abundant with some fish up to around 12 inches in length.  Black bullhead abundance in the gill net catches showed a decline from 1994 to 1999 and then and increase in 2004 to values similar to 1994.  Walleye catch per gill net in 2004 was moderately low and declined from the 1994 and 1999 surveys when catch was moderately high.  Walleye ranged from 10 to 23 inches with most fish around 12 inches long.  Most (80%) of the walleye were age-3 from the 2001 year class when walleye were not stocked in the Cannon River lakes.  Yellow perch, freshwater drum, and white bass were all common in the gill net catches.  Yellow perch were mostly around 9 inches long.  Few northern pike were caught in the gill nets, they were around 25 to 30 inches long.  Bluegill and black crappie abundance was low, but they were generally large.  Bluegill were mostly around 7 inches with the largest over 9 inches.  Black crappies were up to 10 inches.  Aquatic vegetation was rare except in the bay west of highway 13 and near where Whitewater Creek enters Upper Sakatah Lake.  Water clarity in midsummer is often low, depending on the growth of blue-green algae and wind intensity on this fairly shallow lake.  </p>",

Most game fish populations are found in below area medians, while most non-game fish populations greatly exceed area medians in abundance.White crappie were not sampled but averaged 2.00/trap net in 1986.Black crappie remain in low abundance averaging 2.37/trap net compared to 1.50/trap net in 1986.  Black crappie were dominated by 1 year olds, with fewer 2-4 year olds sampled.Bluegill declined from 8.62/trap net in 1986 to 3.37/trap net.  Most of the bluegill were 6.5-7.5 inches and are represented by 1-4 age classes.White bass are abundant, averaging 11.64/gill net and exhibit fast growth rates.  Most of the white bass were 10.5-13.9 inches.  White bass sampled are represented by ages 1-4 with 2 year olds dominating.  White bass were scarce in 1986 netting, averaging 1.45/gill net.Northern pike remain low and unchanged in abundance, averaging 1.64/gill net.  Northern are represented by young fish with ages 1-3 sampled, compared to the 1-5 age classes sampled in 1986.Walleye catch rates improved from 2.54/gill net in 1986 to 7.64/gill net.  Walleye have a favorable age distribution with 1-7 year olds sampled.  Walleye in 1986 were represented by ages 2-6, with 2 and 3 year olds most abundant.  It is suspected that most of the walleye present have migrated from Tetonka Lake.  The only recent stocking of Upper Sakatah was of walleye fry in 1988 and 1989.Yellow perch were sampled in good numbers, averaging 10.54/gill net compared to 2.34/gill net in 1986.  Yellow perch have a favorable size distribution with 1-5 and 7 age classes sampled.Black bullhead are abundant, averaging 994.62 and 431.18 in trap nets and gill nets, respectively.  Black bullheads were low in abundance in 1986, averaging 34.87 and 29.00 in trap nets and gill nets, respectively.Non-game fish sampled in relatively high numbers include freshwater drum, carp, and yellow bullhead.Other species present in low numbers include largemouth bass, bigmouth buffalo, white sucker, golden shiner, and bowfin.</p>",
