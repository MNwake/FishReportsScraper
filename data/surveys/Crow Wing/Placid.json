                "narrative": "<p>Northern pike and bluegill net catches indicated above average populations. These species catch rates exceed the third quartile of the Brainerd Area median for group 1 lakes that are less than 230 acres with a total alkalinity of less than 47.6. Yellow bullhead, hybrid sunfish, pumpkinseed and black crappie exhibited average populations since the net catches were between the first and third quartile of the area median. Brown bullhead, yellow perch and walleye net catches indicate a below average population with catch rates below the first quartile of the area median. The northern pike abundance seems to indicate an upward trend. The two previous surveys (June 1971 and June 1983) had net catches of 7.0 and 9.3/ gill net. The northern pike ranged in size from 11.1 to 31.4 inches, at time of capture. The average size was 19.1 inches long. Age class 2 thru 9 were present in the nets with growth rates on the low side of average. Yellow bullhead populations took a large jump in gill net catches, 0.1 in 1971, 9.7 in 1983, and 64.33 in 1988; yet trapnet catches were down 61.0 in 1971, 66.8 in 1983 and 19.25 in 1988. The brown bullhead is quite low. The bluegill population has remained high with age classes 4 thru 10 represented in the net catch, and all classes indicated a slow growth rate in comparison to statewide averages. Yellow perch population remains extremely low. The walleye population shows the following changes: 0.0 in 1971, 0.3 in 1983, and 0.67 in 1988. Long lake was stocked with walleye fingerling in 1979; fry in 1980 and fingerling again in 1982.</p>",
