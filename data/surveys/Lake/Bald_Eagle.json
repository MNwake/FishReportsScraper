                "narrative": "<p>Bald Eagle Lake is located within the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness (BWCAW) within the Superior National Forest and is a non-motorized lake.  It is approximately 15 miles southeast of Ely.  It is a 1,243 acre lake with a maximum depth of 36 feet and bog-stained water.   <br> \n <br> \nThere are four accesses: two portages, one water route and a combination of both depending on water levels.  The access to Gabbro Lake on the northeast corner can be navigated going downstream if water levels are high enough, otherwise a small portage avoids the shallow rapids.  A 186 rod portage off the northern most bay connects to Turtle Lake and a 190 rod portage on the east shore connects to a small stream that leads to Gull Lake.  The water connection on the south side of Bald Eagle connects to both the Isabella and Snake Rivers.  BWCAW permits are required to visit Bald Eagle through an official entry point and there are twelve U. S. Forest Service maintained campsites on the lake.   <br> \n <br> \nOn June 18, 2019 Bald Eagle showed weak thermal stratification near the outlet in the deepest part of the lake but was not stratified in the middle of the main basin.  The outlet location had a surface temperature of 67 F and a bottom temperature of 52 F.  The mid lake location had a surface temperature of 66 F and a bottom temperature of 64 F.  Oxygen levels were adequate for gamefish throughout the water column at both locations.  Lake bottom substrates along the shoreline are dominated by boulder with muck and sporadic boulders in some of the bays.  Aquatic plants are relatively sparse for most of the shoreline, however some of the muck bottom bays harbor various species of aquatic vegetation including wild celery, floating leaf bur-reed, wild rice, and various water lilies and water shield.  Bald Eagle has six inlets and one major outlet.  The most substantial inlet is the Little Isabella River/Snake River which enters on the south side of the lake.  The lone outlet is still considered the Isabella River where it exits Bald Eagle to the northwest on its way eventually to the South Kawishiwi River. <br> \n <br> \nThe overall gillnet catch rate for all fish combined was 30.0 fish/net which ranked third out of the four surveys for the lake.  Fish species sampled were yellow perch, walleye, cisco, northern pike, white sucker, black crappie, rock bass, and bluegill. <br> \n <br> \nFifty-one walleye were sampled for a catch rate of 5.7 fish/gill net, which was just below average compared to other similar lakes in the state but above average compared to other lakes in the Tower area.  Sizes were small with the average fish just under 12 inches and a max length of just over 22 inches.  Growth rates were extremely slow as is often the case in very bog-stained lakes, with fish taking 6 years to reach an average of 14 inches.  Walleye were aged up to 9 years old with good representation from the 2012, 2015 and 2016 year classes.   <br> \n <br> \nThe northern pike gillnet catch was 3.4 fish/net which was low compared to past surveys but still better than average compared to other similar lakes. Sizes were decent with the average fish weighing nearly 4 pounds and measuring 24 inches long. The largest pike sampled was nearly 36 inches.       <br> \n <br> \nFifteen black crappie were sampled for a catch rate of 1.7 fish/net which was very good compared to other similar lakes and the highest catch rate on record for Bald Eagle. Sizes were good with an average length of 11 inches and the largest fish measuring over 12 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nNo smallmouth bass were sampled in gill nets however, it is known they do inhabit the lake.  Conversations with anglers during the week of the survey suggested some had done well angling for smallmouth.  Additionally, none of the previous surveys sampled smallmouth bass although this isn't surprising as bass can be very net shy. <br> \n <br> \nThe yellow perch gillnet catch was 9.1 fish/net which was above average for the lake and very good when compared against other similar lakes throughout the state.  Sizes were small compared to perch catches from past surveys on Bald Eagle with the average fish measuring 7 inches and the largest nearly 10 inches.    <br> \n <br> \nAdditional species sampled were one large bluegill as well as moderate numbers of rock bass, cisco, and white sucker.   <br> \n</p>",
