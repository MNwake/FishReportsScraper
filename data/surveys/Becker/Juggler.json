                "narrative": "<p>Juggler Lake's fish community, as well as its water level, has changed markedly over the past 38 years.  Fish populations have been affected by recently high water, abundant crayfish, recent introductions of rock bass (unauthorized) and smallmouth bass, stocking of walleye and other fish species, angling pressure, and by the nature of the lake itself.Walleye numbers remained higher than normal compared to similar lakes.  Even though Juggler's walleyes were relatively young and small (55% were two years or younger), the average length of net-sampled walleye was 14.4 inches, over two inches longer than during the assessment five years ago.  Natural reproduction as well as stocking has occurred during recent years.  No creel surveys have been done, but, other factors indicate that walleye were heavily exploited in Juggler Lake.Smallmouth bass, introduced in 1987, were reproducing and maintaining \"normal\" numbers.  Average length of sampled smallmouth bass was 11.8 inches.  Rock bass remain extremely abundant.  Bluegills, while remaining relatively low in abundance, were larger than five years ago; mean length was 6.2 inches and some longer than nine inches were sampled in test nets.  Largemouth bass, black crappie, and yellow perch were found in very low numbers in Juggler Lake while net catches of northern pike increased to the normal range.In summary, Juggler is a scenic lake with relatively good water quality, increasing shoreline development, and relatively heavy fishing pressure.  Increased fishing pressure is likely the biggest factor in the shortage of large walleye and northern pike.  While realizing that fish for eating are important to most anglers, catch and release of mid-sized gamefish is encouraged to help restore a more balanced fish community.</p>",

This data will be analyzed in conjunction with the gill net and trap net survey completed in 2017 to provide a complete assessment of the fish community that will be used to evaluate the biological condition of Juggler Lake, and contribute to the assessment of the watershed.  Sampling gear utilized during this survey targets fish species not commonly sampled by gill nets and trap nets. <br> \nTen sites within Juggler Lake were sampled during this survey.  Electrofishing was conducted at all 10 sites, and seining was conducted at five sites.  Difficult sampling conditions prevented the use of seines at five sites.  The near-shore substrate of Juggler Lake contains many areas of dense vegetation, woody habitat, and rocks. <br> \nBluegill, Bluntnose Minnow, Central Mudminnow, Green Sunfish, Iowa Darter, Largemouth Bass, Smallmouth Bass, and Yellow Perch were sampled during this survey.  Iowa Darter is the only species sampled that is intolerant of poor habitat conditions.  The results of this survey, combined with results of the gill net and trap net survey done in 2017, indicate that the fish community in Juggler Lake meets expectations for lakes of similar characteristics, and that the lake is not biologically impaired.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Juggler Lake is a moderately developed, 365 acre lake located in northeastern Becker County.  The surrounding watershed is primarily mixed hardwood and conifer forest.  Shoal water substrates range from silt and sand to rubble and boulder.  Boulders are most common along the east shore and along islands.Smallmouth bass were introduced in Juggler Lake in 1987.  Spawning habitat (especially boulders) is common and this species is thriving.  Test net catches appear to have leveled off well above the normal range for similar lakes.  Smallmouth bass grow at faster than normal rates in Juggler and lengths of sampled fish ranged from 4.6 to 18.3 inches.Walleyes, northern pike, black crappie, and bluegill continue to exhibit test net catch rates near the lake's historic averages.  Pike averaged 21.9 inches and 2.3 pounds.  Crappie averaged 9.1 inches and approximately 1/2 pound and bluegills averaged 6.4 inches.Walleyes are regularly stocked in Juggler Lake.  Since 2001, the lake has been involved in a statewide walleye stocking study.  The goal of this study has been to determine what sizes and amounts of walleyes are most effective for stocking a given lake type.  Walleye fingerlings have been stocked approximately every other year since 1970.  However, the relatively strong 2001 year class (stocked as walleye fry) shows that fry stocking may be more effective for Juggler Lake.  Future assessments should reveal if this is the case.  Walleyes sampled in 2004 averaged 16.5 inches and 1.7 pounds.  Growth rates appeared to be somewhat faster than they were in the past, despite the recent lack of yellow perch in Juggler.The bottom line is that Juggler is a scenic lake with relatively good water quality and fish populations.  Good land management, selective fish harvest, and other stewardship methods can help to keep it that way.  Anglers are particularly urged to release medium to large fish while harvesting the more abundant small fish for eating.  This ensures that mature fish are available for spawning, that fish populations are better balanced, and that there will be more opportunities to catch large fish in the future.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Juggler Lake is involved in a walleye stocking study along with several other Minnesota lakes.  The study is designed to test the effectiveness of stocking fingerlings, frylings, or fry of various amounts.  During the study, walleye fry were stocked here in 2001 at 1,000 per littoral acre (149,000 fry) and walleye fingerlings were stocked in 2003 and 2005 at 2.0 pounds per littoral acre (298 lb).  Fry stocking appeared to result in the strongest year class of walleye in Juggler Lake in 2006. <br> \n <br> \nExcept for another special assessment in 2008 (three years after the last experimental stocking), the stocking study has now been completed.  The lake's management plan calls for resuming a regular walleye stocking rate of 1.0 pounds of walleye fingerlings per littoral acre (149 lb) biennially, beginning in 2007.  This stocking regimen is the same as that used in most years prior to the stocking study.  Given the success of the 2001 year class (a walleye fry stocking year), it would seem prudent to conduct a longer fry stocking comparison in Juggler Lake.  If fry stocking sustains or improves the walleye fishery, fry are preferred due to their relatively inexpensive cost. <br> \n <br> \nThe average size of all sampled walleyes in Juggler Lake in 2006 was a very nice 18.0 inches and 2.3 pounds.  At 4.9 per set, walleye catch rates were similar to the 2004 Juggler Lake study, but slightly less than the lake's historic mean of 5.9 per gill net set and the long-range goal of 6.0 per set. <br> \n <br> \nFish species other than walleye will also be studied more intensively during the 2011 assessment.  It should be noted, however, that the catch rate of northern pike reached the historic high for this lake at 8.4 per set in 2006.  The pike averaged 21.6 inches in length and 2.3 pounds in weight.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Juggler is a 410-acre, class-23 Lake located in northern Becker County.  Juggler Lake is within the boundaries of the White Earth Indian Reservation.  Nearly all the lake's shoreline is privately owned, but the watershed contains large blocks of forested, county tax-forfeited land.  There are approximately 40 homes/cabins on Juggler Lake.  The lake is categorized as mesotrophic with a mean trophic state index in the thirties.  There are no significant inlets or outlet.  The county-owned public access is located on the southwest shore. <br> \n <br> \nA standard survey was done on Juggler Lake on 08/07/2017 to assess the fish community.  This survey was conducted using nine gill nets and nine trap nets.  Also during 2017, the near shore fish community was sampled by seining and electrofishing, emergent vegetation was mapped, and shoreline development was assessed using Score the Shore methods.  The detailed results of those surveys are provided in separate reports. <br> \n <br> \nOnly nine Walleyes were caught during the 2017 assessment, resulting in the lowest catch rate on record for Juggler Lake.  Walleyes sampled ranged from 15.1 inches to 28.7 inches, with a mean length of 22.9 inches.  Past Walleye stocking in Juggler Lake has consisted of stocking fingerlings and fry, with neither life stage resulting in a consistent population of Walleye. <br> \n <br> \nSmallmouth and Largemouth Bass are present in Juggler Lake.  Smallmouth were introduced in 1987, and have thrived in Juggler Lake with abundant spawning habitat.  Their population is higher than the normal range of lakes of similar characteristics.  Smallmouth Bass sampled in 2017 gill nets ranged from 11.2 to 19.8 inches, with a mean length of 16.1 inches and a mean weight of 2.18 pounds.  The 2017 trap net catch rate of Largemouth Bass was slightly lower than the normal level for Juggler Lake.  Largemouth Bass sampled ranged in size from 5.4 inches to 14.9 inches, with gill nets catching more (and larger) Largemouth Bass than trap nets.   <br> \n <br> \nThe Bluegill population in Juggler Lake was higher than it has been in over 30 years.  Bluegills sampled ranged from 3.7 inches to 10.0 inches, with Bluegills captured in trap nets having a mean length of 7.0 inches.  Bluegills are commonly sought by anglers, and spawning habitat is abundant.  <br> \n <br> \nThe Northern Pike population is slightly lower than it was in 2012, yet is still above Juggler Lake's normal range, and also the range for similar lakes.  Pike sampled ranged from 10.7 inches to 36.7 inches, with a mean length of 19.7 inches.  High water levels have provided an abundant amount of spawning habitat for Northern Pike.  New Northern Pike regulations take effect in May 2018 that may shift the Pike population towards lower numbers and larger fish.   <br> \n <br> \nVery few Yellow Perch were sampled during this assessment.  The low population is not surprising, due to the abundance of predators such as Northern Pike.  Other species sampled in this assessment include Hybrid Sunfish, Rock Bass, and White Sucker.  The near-shore fish assessment conducted in 2017 found similar species, but also Bluntnose Minnow, Central Mudminnow, Green Sunfish, and Iowa Darter.  Iowa Darter is the only species sampled that is intolerant of poor habitat conditions.  Bullheads have not been documented in Juggler Lake, although they were once present in the small basin adjacent to the north end of Juggler Lake.  That basin was treated with Rotenone, a chemical that causes fish to die, in 2002 to prevent the possible introduction of bullheads to Juggler Lake due to rising water levels. <br> \n <br> \nFish habitat in Juggler Lake is diverse, with many stands of emergent and floating leaf vegetation.  Emergent vegetation was mapped in 2017.  The shoreline of Juggler Lake is moderately developed.  Score the Shore methods in 2017 found that the average lakewide habitat score was 83.7 (+/- 2.1) out of 100 possible. Approximately 42 percent of the sites were developed with a mean score of 72.5 (+/- 3.7), while undeveloped sites had a mean score of 92.1 (+/- 1.2).  The Score the Shore survey was designed to provide a means to quantify and compare lakeshore habitat between lakes. The Juggler Lake shoreline habitat score was higher than the statewide lake score average of 73.6. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Juggler Lake is a moderately developed, 365-acre lake located in northeastern Becker County.  The surrounding watershed is primarily mixed hardwood and conifer forest.  Shoal water substrates range from silt and sand to rubble and boulder.  Boulders are most common along the east shore and along islands.  The common, but small and scattered bulrush stands provide spawning, rearing, and hiding cover for panfish and bass.  White waterlilies beds are thickest in the south and west bays.  A few cattail and cane stands are also located in scattered locations. <br> \n <br> \nSmallmouth bass were introduced in Juggler Lake in 1987.  Spawning habitats including boulders and sunken logs are common and this species appears to be thriving.  The most recent test net catches have declined, but catch rates are still in the upper end of the normal range for similar lakes.  Smallmouth bass grow at normal rates in Juggler and lengths of sampled fish ranged from 12.9 to 18.8 inches in 2012.   <br> \n <br> \nDespite continued fingerling stocking, walleye catch rates have declined to the lowest point in netting history and fish smaller than 14 inches were not found.  The current stocking strategy will be examined and potentially modified in the upcoming lake management plan.  Conversely, northern pike catch rates have reached a new historical high for Juggler Lake.   The abundant northern pike and perhaps smallmouth bass are likely contributing factors to the decline in walleye numbers.  Walleye fingerlings are the perfect food size and shape for young pike.  Flooded meadow grasses are a preferred pike spawning habitat and with lower water levels in the past, this habitat was rare in this lake.  Recently high water levels have resulted in more available pike spawning habitat.  Currently, pike fishing is good for small fish, but a few large ones can also be found. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass and panfish are also common in Juggler Lake's fishery.  Black crappie are not considered abundant, but are good-sized on average with fish over 12 inches present.  Bluegills showed a wide range of sizes (2.8 - 9.8 inches) and several were sampled that were larger than eight inches. <br> \n <br> \nJuggler is a scenic lake with relatively good water quality and fish populations.  Good land management, selective fish harvest, and other stewardship methods can help to maintain the lake's status.  Protection of the small stands of bulrush can be particularly valuable.  Anglers are urged to release medium to large fish while harvesting the more abundant small fish for eating.  This ensures that mature fish are available for spawning, that fish populations are better balanced, and that there will be more opportunities to catch large fish in the future.  Anglers are also encouraged to target small northern pike to help balance the fishery in Juggler Lake.</p>",

Crayfish numbers, recent introductions of rock bass (unauthorized) and smallmouth bass,high water levels, walleye and other fish stocking, and increased fishing pressure have all contributed to thecurrent fish population status.     First, the good news.  Walleye numbers are up, higher than any of the past surveys.  Smallmouth bass areholding their own since introduction in 1987, are reproducing naturally and are adding a new gamefish for anglers. Yellow perch, the primary forage for Juggler Lake's walleye and northern pike populations, are rebounding afterlows during the past decade.  Crayfish, a probable predator on bluegill eggs, may be declining from extremenumbers in the eighties.  For those who appreciate rock bass, they are now very abundant and catchable afterunauthorized introduction during the eighties.     Now, the bad news.  Large walleye, northern pike, and bluegill are rare.  Northern pike, bluegill, blackcrappie and largemouth bass populations have all declined significantly since 1960.  Crayfish remain veryabundant, though they may be decreasing.  For those who dislike rock bass, they are hard to keep off the otherend of the line._x000C_     In summary, Juggler Lake is a scenic little lake with good water quality and gamefish populations thatfluctuate more than many area lakes.  Increased fishing pressure may be the largest factor in the shortage oflarge walleye and northern pike.  Hopefully, increasing smallmouth bass numbers will help take some of thepressure off other gamefish species.  While realizing that fish for the pan are important to most anglers, catchand release of mid-sized gamefish is encouraged.  A conservation ethic should help to restore more balancedpopulations of gamefish.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Juggler Lake is a 410-acre Lake located in northern Becker County.  Juggler Lake is within the boundaries of the White Earth Indian Reservation.  Nearly all the lake's shoreline is privately owned, but the watershed contains large blocks of forested, county tax-forfeited land.  There are approximately 40 homes/cabins on Juggler Lake.  There are no significant inlets or outlet.  There is a county-owned public access located on the southwest shore.  A standard fisheries survey was completed on Juggler Lake on at the end of July 2022 to assess the fish community.   <br> \n <br> \nOnly five Walleyes were caught during the 2022 survey, resulting in the lowest catch rate on record for Juggler Lake (0.7 Walleyes per net).  The Walleyes that were sampled were big, ranging from 22.4 inches to 28.1 inches.  Catch rates for Northern Pike were slightly higher in 2022 (11.2 per gill net) than in 2017 (10.8 per gill net).  This rate is above the lake's historical average.  Northern Pike sampled ranged from 13.9 to 38.0 inches, with an average length of 19.3 inches.  Catch rates of Bluegill were slightly below the historical average with 12.9 fish per set observed in 2022.  Bluegills sampled ranged from 3.1 inches to 9.1 inches, with Bluegills captured having an average length of 7.9 inches.  Bluegills eight inches or larger made up 18% of the fish sampled. <br> \n <br> \nSmallmouth and Largemouth Bass are present in Juggler Lake.  Smallmouth Bass were introduced in 1987 and have thrived with the abundant spawning habitat in the lake.  The catch rate of Smallmouth Bass sampled in 2022 gill nets was down slightly to 1.4 per net.  These fish ranged from 11.1 to 20.9 inches with an average length of 15.2 inches and an average weight of 2.2 pounds.  About 77% of the Smallmouth Bass sampled were over 14 inches.  The 2022 gill net catch rate of Largemouth Bass was higher than recent surveys with a catch of 3.9 per net.  Largemouth Bass sampled ranged in size from 6.4 to 17.6 inches, with an average length of 12.9 inches.  Yellow Perch numbers have increased slightly from recent surveys with 3.3 fish per gill net caught in 2022.  These fish averaged 7.3 inches with fish up to 11.0 inches measured.  Other species sampled in this assessment include Green Sunfish and Rock Bass.</p>",
