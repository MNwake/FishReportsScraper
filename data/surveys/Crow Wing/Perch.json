                "narrative": "<p>Perch is a 270 acre lake located within the City of Baxter in Crow Wing County.  The lake is forty feet deep and about 61% of the surface area is less than fifteen feet deep.  In 1997 there were 83 homes/cabins located along the four miles of shoreline.  Soils in water less than four feet deep were primarily sand and/or muck.  Lake water was moderately hard and had low phosphorus fertility, similar to results of the 1987 water sample analysis.  Water clarity was above average for area lakes.  The aquatic plant community was fairly diverse.  Emergent species like bulrush help enhance the quality of spawning areas for bass and panfish species.  Others, like wild rice and burreed, often provide important spawning habitat for northern pike.  Emergent species also help protect shorelines from damage caused by wave activity and help remove excess nutrients from the water.  Submergent and floating leafed species provide important cover and food resources for a wide variety of aquatic life.In the 1997 test netting, catch rates for northern pike, largemouth bass and walleyes was \"high\" when compared to similar type lakes.  Catches of white suckers, yellow perch, black crappies, bluegills, pumpkinseeds, brown bullheads and yellow bullheads were in the \"average\" category.The northern pike catch was in the \"high\" category when compared to both similar type lakes and to previous nettings done on Perch Lake.  As in previous nettings, northerns aged 2 and 3 years old were most abundant in the sample.  Fish averaged 17 inches and 1.2 lbs., similar to recent netting results.  Six age classes were sampled and growth was good.Walleyes have been stocked periodically since before the 1940's.  Fry, fingerling and yearling sized fish have been used.  The current walleye catch rate is \"high\" compared to similar type lakes and is within the range of past catches for Perch Lake.  Five year classes were sampled.  Most fish were from the 1991 year class.  There continues to be a rather poor match between stocking records and results of ageing netted fish.  In '97, walleyes averaged 19 inches long and 2.6 lbs..The largemouth bass catch was also in the \"high\" range in '97.  Five age classes were sampled and growth was good.  A strong 1993 year class was present.Bluegills were caught in \"average\" numbers in 1997.  Of the five year classes sampled, over half of the fish were from the 1992 year class.  Bluegill growth was good.  About 64% of the fish measured were 7.0 inches or more in length.  Black crappies were sampled in trap nets for the first time since the 1982 netting.  They were caught in \"average\" numbers compared to similar type lakes.Yellow perch are an important food resource for the lake's gamefish.  The '97 catch was in the \"average\" category and was typical for Perch Lake.  Young perch continued to be caught in reasonable numbers in shoreline seine hauls.</p>",

A nearshore survey was conducted to assess the populations of both game and non-game fish species.  Ten 100' long sampling stations were evenly spaced around the lakeshore.  Each station was then sampled by backpack electrofishing, and if conditions allowed with a 15' or 50' 1/8th inch seine.   <br> \n <br> \nIn this survey all ten station were sampled by backpack electrofishing.  The 50' 1/8th inch seine was used at one station, and the 15' 1/8th inch seine was used at four additional stations.  Five stations had heavy vegetation and/or soft sediments which did not allow for seining.  14 species were sampled including Johnny Darter, Iowa Darter, banded killifish and blackchin shiner.  This nearshore survey will be used along with the gillnet and trapnet survey on 10-12 June 2015, to calculate an Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) score.  This score will be an indicator of the health of Perch Lake. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Perch Lake is a 270 acre lake located inside the city limits of Baxter in Crow Wing County.  A DNR owned public access is located on the south end of the lake.  Perch reaches a depth of 40 feet, with 61% being 15 feet deep or less.  Large beds of bulrush and water lilies surround the lakeshore.  Protection of aquatic vegetation, especially emergent vegetation, is important for maintaining good water quality.  Aquatic vegetation is critical for fish spawning areas as well as providing habitat for fish and other aquatic life. <br> \n <br> \nAlthough Walleye fry are stocked annually (165,000/year), not much of a Walleye fishery exists.  Only two Walleyes were captured in the 2021 survey, with past catches have ranged from 0.7/gill net (2009) to a high of 4.7/gill net (1997).   <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass were sampled by a spring electrofishing survey and captured at a rate of 43.8/hour.  Average length was 12.1\" with 54% measuring at least 12\" in length, and 20% measuring at least 15\".  Largemouth bass up to 18.1\" were sampled. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike numbers were high for this type of lake at 12.3/gill net.  While average size was small at 19.4\", fish up to 34.8\" were captured.  With only 11% of the fish in the protected slot and only 9% above it, there is ample opportunity to harvest your 10 Northern Pike under 22\" on Perch Lake. <br> \n <br> \nA new regulation was implemented on Perch Lake in 2021 reducing the daily possession of sunfish and crappie to five.  Both Bluegill (16.4/trap net) and Black Crappie (1.4/trap net) were caught in average numbers for this type of lake.  Both species were fast growing and had plenty of fish that were of harvestable size.  Average size of Bluegill was 6.5\", with 32% measuring at least 7\" in length.  Average size of Black Crappie was 8.9\", with 69% measuring at least 8\". <br> \n <br> \nNo invasive species have been discovered in Perch Lake, but they are located in the local area.  Before and after launching lake users are required to inspect and remove any aquatic plants and animals from their watercraft and trailers as well as pull the plug and drain all water from the watercraft, including bilges, livewells and baitwells. <br> \n</p>",

Perch reaches a depth of 40 feet, with 61% being 15 feet deep or less.  Water clarity is good with a secchi disk reading of 14 feet.  Large beds of bulrush and water lilies surround the lakeshore.  Protection of aquatic vegetation, especially emergent vegetation, is important for maintaining good water quality.  Aquatic vegetation is critical for fish spawning areas as well as providing habitat for fish and other aquatic life. <br> \n <br> \nAlthough walleye fry are stocked annually (165,000/year) no walleyes were captured in this survey.  Past catches have ranged from 0.7/gillnet (2009) to a high of 4.7/gillnet (1997).  <br> \n  <br> \nThe northern pike gillnet catch of 5.8/gillnet was average compared to similar lakes, and the lowest catch to date.  Average size was 18.1\" and 1.8 lbs.  Northern pike up to 33.7\" were captured, with 21% measuring at least 24\" in length.  Voluntary catch and release of these large pike will help build a balanced population. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass were sampled by a spring electrofishing survey.  Largemouth were captured at a rate of 89.4/hr of run time.  Average length was 12.3\" with 47% measuring at least 12\" in length, and 17% measuring at least 15\".  Largemouth bass up to 20.9\" were sampled. <br> \n <br> \nBluegills were captured in trapnets in average numbers at 23.0/net.  Average length was 6.8\", with 47% at least 7\" in length.  Black crappies were caught in low numbers in both gillnets (0.3/net) and trapnets (0.4/net).  For both gears combined all crappies were at least 8\" in length. <br> \n <br> \nNo invasive species have been discovered in Perch Lake, but they are located in thelocal area.  Before and after launching lake users are required to inspect and remove any aquatic plants and animals from their watercraft and trailers as well as pull the plug and drain all water from the watercraft, including bilges, livewells and baitwells. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Perch Lake is a 270 acre lake located within the city of Baxter in Crow Wing County.  A public access is located on the south end of the lake.  The lake is heavily developed with 83 homes/cabins (as of 1997) along 4 miles of shoreline.  The maximum depth is 40' and about 61% of the lake is 15' deep or less.  Shallow water substrate is primarily sand and/or muck.  The aquatic plant community is relatively diverse with 29 species present.  Emergent plants such as bulrush and water lilies are important for shoreline protection, maintaining water quality, and provide essential spawning habitat for bass and panfish species.  Submerged plants provide food and cover needed by fish and other aquatic species.Walleyes are currently stocked annually as fry at a rate of 1,000 per littoral acre.  Past catches have been variable and ranged from 1.0 to 7.5/gill net.  The 2002 walleye catch of 1.2/gill net was average when compared to similar lakes.  Compared to 1997, mean length and weight increased from 19.5\" and 2.6lbs to 20.8\" and 3.6lbs.Northern pike were caught in above average numbers for the second consecutive netting at 16.7/gill net in 2002.  This is the second highest catch to date.  Past catches have ranged from 6.7 to 20.7/gill net.  The 2000 year class was the largest and contributed 32% of the catch with most of these fish measuring about 13\" to 16.5\".  Average length and weight in 2002 (17.5\" and 1.3lbs) remained similar to that in 1997 (17.7\" and 1.2lbs).The largemouth bass abundance of 0.4/trap net and 1.3/gill net was average compared to similar lakes.  Spring electrofishing resulted in a largemouth bass catch rate of 31.9/hr with an average length of 12.3\" and 55% measuring 12\" or larger.The bluegill catch of 11.2/trap net was average and 47% of trapnetted bluegills measured 7\" or larger, compared to 64% in 1997.  The 1996, 1997, and 1998 year classes represented 88% of the catch.  Black crappie abundance was below average in 2002 at 0.6/trap net, but was similar to past catches ranging from 0 to 1.0/trap net.Yellow perch are an important forage species for the lake's game fish.  The 2002 abundance of 2.8/gill net was the highest in 7 nettings to date and is average when compared to similar lakes.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Pumpkinseed, bluegill and largemouth bass net catches indicate existence of an above average population. Net catches exceeded the third quartile of the Brainerd Area median for lakes 230 to 510 acres and greater than 36 feet deep. Northern pike, white sucker, yellow bullhead, brown bullhead, yellow perch and walleye net catches indicate the presence of an average population with net catches falling between the first and third quartile of the Brainerd Area median for similar lake types. The northern pike population has shown very little abundance change from the previous three surveys with numbers remaining high (6.67/gillnet in 1987). The length-frequency range was 10.5 to 24.9 inches long. The median size was 19.3 inches long and weighed 1.7 lbs. Year classes 1-4 were represented in the nets with annulus 2 and 3 fish predominate as they were in the 1982 survey. Annulus 1 fish exhibited fast growth rate while the others exhibited average growth rates when compared to statewide averages. Yellow and brown bullhead populations have shown a decline over the 1974 and 1982 surveys with the mean weight in 1987 being 0.45 lbs and 0.33 lbs respectively. The bluegill population remains high with no change in abundance or the small average size that was exhibited in the past two surveys. Year classes 3-8 were present and all exhibited a very slow growth rate in comparison to statewide averages. The largemouth bass population apparently has rebounded to a moderate level over the extreme lows observed in the 1982 survey. Year classes 2-4 and 6 were present with all exhibiting average growth rates. As in past surveys, the yellow perch population remained low (2.67/gillnet), but it has improved slightly over the last three surveys. Year classes 3 and 5 were present with growth rate normal. The walleye population remained unchanged (1.0/gillnet) from the 1979 and 1982 surveys. The 1960 lake survey indicated a high population (7.5/gillnet). Apparently the walleye stockings in recent years have been failures.</p>",

AGES I-V WERE PRESENT, 84% WERE AGED II OR III (AS IN 1987) AND HAD GOOD GROWTH.  LMB (0.5/TRAPNET) WERE CAUGHT IN AVERAGE NUMBERS IN 1992, COMPARED TO THE HIGH ABUNDANCE NOTED IN 1987 (2.67/TRAPNET).  AGES YY, III AND IV WERE SAMPLED.  SMB WERE SAMPLED ONLY AS YY FISH IN SHORELINE SEINING.  WAE ABUNDANCE (3.33 GILLNET) WAS AT THE UPPER QUARTILE FOR THE LAKE CLASS IN 1992.  THIS MAY REPRESENT A REAL INCREASE IN ABUNDANCE SINCE 1987 BUT THE CATCH WAS NOT MUCH HIGHER THAN THE 1-2/GILLNET FOUND IN THE PREVIOUS THREE NETTING.  FOUR AGE CLASSES WERE SAMPLED, THREE FROM YEARS WHEN STOCKING OCCURRED AND GROWTH APPEARED TO BE GOOD.  SIMILAR PATTERNS WERE SEEN IN THE 1982 AND 1987 NETTINGS WHERE ONLY A PORTION OF THE FISH AGED TO BE FROM A YEAR WHEN STOCKING WAS DONE AND A GIVEN YEAR CLASS WAS REPRESENTED BY ONLY ONE OR TWO FISH.  THE PATTERN SUGGESTS CONTINUED LOW SURVIVAL OF WAES WHETHER STOCKED AS FRY, FINGERLINGS OR YEARLINGS.  THE ABUNDANCES OF PMK (0.5/LIFT) AND BLG (0.5/LIFT) WERE LOW IN TRAPNETS.  GILLNET CATCHES FOR THE TWO SPECIES WERE 6.33/LIFT AND 28.0/LIFT, RESPECTIVELY.  BOTH VALUES WERE WELL ABOVE THE THIRD QUARTILE VALUE AND CONSISTENT WITH THE HIGH ABUNDANCE VALUES OBTAINED FROM TRAPNET CATCHES IN THE PREVIOUS THREE NETTINGS.  BLC (0.67/GILLNET) HAD LOW ABUNDANCE AND WAS ONLY TAKEN IN GILLNETS. YEP (0.33/GILLNET) WAS CAUGHT IN LOW NUMBERS, AS THEY WERE IN 1974 AND 1982; HOWEVER, YOY PERCH WERE COMMON IN SHORELINE SEINE HAULS.  WTS WAS ABUNDANT (2.67/GILLNET) AND AVERAGE SIZE WAS 2.4 LB.  BLB (0.75/TRAPNET) AND YEB (3.75/TRAPNET) ABUNDANCES WERE AVERAGE FOR THE LAKE CLASS AND SIMILAR TO 1987.  BRB WAS NOT TAKEN IN TEST NETS IN 1992.</p>",

These fish averaged 12.3\" and 1.1 lbs. and 54% were 12\" or larger. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappies were caught in low numbers in both gill nets (1.7/gill net) and trap nets (0.1/trap net) when compared to similar lakes.  The fish were fast growing and 55% were 8\" or larger.  Bluegills were also caught in low numbers (9.0/trap net), with an average size of 6.0\".  These fish were fast growing and 28% were 7\" or larger.
