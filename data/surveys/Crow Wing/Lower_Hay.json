                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of the nearshore fish community in Lower Hay Lake was conducted by Fisheries Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program Staff starting August 1, 2018. Fourteen sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 15-foot or 50-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing and a 50-foot seine were used to sample at all 14 sites. Nearshore sampling captured 29 native species of fish including nine species that are intolerant of disturbance (Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Iowa Darter, Logperch, Longnose Dace, Mimic Shiner, Mottled Sculpin, Rock Bass, and Smallmouth Bass) and three species that are tolerant of disturbance (Black Bullhead, Fathead Minnow, and Green Sunfish). <br> \n <br> \nData from this targeted nearshore survey is combined with trap net and gill net data from a June 2018 standard survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based Index of Biological Integrity (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment. The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. The FIBI score for Lower Hay Lake from this survey is above an impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes and indicates an exceptional fish community is present in this lake. For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website. <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Pine River Watershed assessment of surface waters process completed in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency. </p>",

Based on the profile, the top of the thermocline (i.e., the location in the water column with the sharpest transition from warm to cold water) occurred at approximately 17 feet. Dissolved oxygen decreased to below 3.0 mg/L at 95.8 feet, which was below the thermocline, at the time of sampling. The temperature at which dissolved oxygen decreased to below 3.0 mg/L (i.e., TDO3, a single variable to characterize oxythermal habitat) was 4.9?C (40.8?F). <br> \n <br> \nTDO3 values cooler than 17.2?C for Lake Whitefish or 21.5?C for Cisco indicate that oxythermal conditions are favorable for these species.

Due to Covid restrictions during spring of 2020, no walleye fry were stocked in 2020.  However, night electrofishing was conducted on Lower Hay Lake on September 16, 2020 to monitor the abundance of young-of-the-year (YOY) walleyes from natural reproduction.  The total sample time was 1 hour and 24 minutes, which resulted in no YOY walleye being caught.  Previous catches have ranged from 0/hr to 53.1/hr run-time.  Walleyes that were age 1 and older were sampled at a rate of 4.3/hr run-time.  They ranged in size from 8.7\" to 20.9\", with a mean length of 12.6\".  </p>",

The littoral area (area 15 feet deep or less) is 215 acres or 31% of the surface area.  Maximum depth is 100 feet and water clarity is good, with a secchi disc reading of 11 feet.In 2000, bluegill,largemouth bass, pumpkinseed and rock bass sampled in high numbers.  Walleyes, shorthead redhorse, tullibee, yellow bullheads, black bullheads and green sunfish were taken in low numbers.  Lake whitefish, northern pike, white suckers, yellow perch, black crappies, bowfin, and brown bullheads were taken in average numbers.  All species exhibited good growth rates.Walleye were netted at a rate of 3.1/gillnet and northern pike were netted at 6.11 /gillnet.  Mean weights were 1.94 pounds and 2.76 pounds respectively.Bluegills remain to be present in very high numbers and 22% of those fish sampled were 7.0 inches or greater in length.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lower Hay Lake, part of the Whitefish Chain, is a 685 acre lake in northern Crow Wing County.  Maximum depth is 100 ft.  Lower Hay is highly developed with 112 homes around its 4.2 miles of shoreline.  A DNR access is located on the south shore with access also possible through a channel from Whitefish Lake.  Water clarity was good with a secchi reading of 12 feet. <br> \n <br> \nThe northern pike catch rate of 15.7/ gillnet was well above average, and the highest to date.  Average size was 18.8 inches and 1.5 lbs.  Northern pike over 24 inches made up only 8% of the population.  Growth was above average compared to area lakes.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleyes were caught at below average numbers at a rate of 1.7/gillnet, although average size was nice at 20.3 inches and 3.3 lbs.  Walleyes are stocked annually as fry and every other year as fingerlings into the Whitefish Chain.   <br> \n <br> \nBluegills were caught in above average numbers at 49.7/ trapnet.  Size should be very acceptable to anglers with 85% of the population over 7 inches, and 29% over 8 inches with the largest measuring 9.7 inches.  Average weight was 0.4 lbs.   Anglers need to practice selective harvest to protect the quality size of bluegills.   <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch were caught in the lowest numbers to date at 0.6/gillnet. Yellow perch are an important prey species especially for walleyes and northern pike.  Other fish captured included black crappie, hybrid sunfish, lake whitefish, pumpkinseed, largemouth bass, rock bass, tullibee (cisco), white sucker, yellow bullhead, bowfin (dogfish), brown bullhead, greater redhorse, silver redhorse and shorthead redhorse.  During near shore electrofishing and seining for IBI an additional ten species of fish were captured. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

Fish are regularly stocked from the Lower Hay access as it is one of the better accesses on the chain.  Walleyes were caught in below average numbers in 2018 (1.5/gill net), although size was quite good, with an average size of 20.1\" and all of the fish measuring over 15\". <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike numbers continue to be high at 14.1/gill net, but size is relatively small.  Average length was 19.7\" and only 9% of the fish were 24\" or larger.  Lakes in this part of the state have a new northern pike regulation enacted in 2018: possession limit of 10 with not more than 2 over 26\".  All from 22\"-26\" must be immediately released.  Please refer to the current Minnesota Fishing Regulations for additional information. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass numbers for the Whitefish Chain, which includes Lower Hay, were 68.8/hr run-time during night electrofishing.  Average length was 13.5\".  Five smallmouth bass were also netted while electrofishing the chain.  All but one were over 17\". <br> \n <br> \nPanfish numbers were moderately low with 5.8 bluegills/trap net.  Average size was 6.5\" and 54% of the fish were 7\" or larger.  Black crappies were sampled at a rate of 0.7/trap net with 75% measuring at least 8\". <br> \n <br> \nLake whitefish and tullibee (cisco), which are important forage fish for walleye and northern pike, were both caught in Lower Hay.  Numbers were average for both whitefish (1.6/gill net) and tullibee (4.1/gill net).  Average size was 15.1\" for whitefish and only 8.9\" for tullibee. <br> \n</p>",

Development is heavy with 121 homes/cabins on four miles of shoreline in 1995.  The littoral area (area 15 feet deep or less) is 215 acres, or 31% of the surface area.  Maximum depth is 100 feet and water clarity is good, with a secchi disc reading of 13 feet in mid-June, 2005.In 2005, lake whitefish, black crappie, bluegill, bowfin, largemouth bass and rock bass were sampled in high numbers.  Walleye, yellow bullhead and yellow perch were sampled in low numbers.  Northern pike, black bullhead, brown bullhead, tullibee, white sucker, pumpkinseed and shorthead redhorse were taken in average numbers compared to similar type lakes.  Growth rates for all species were generally good.The walleye catch was 1.08/GN.  Size averaged 17.4 inches and 2.3 pounds.  The northern pike catch was 8.5/GN.  Their size averaged 22.1 inches and 2.5 pounds.  Bluegills were present in high numbers but 49% were at least 7 inches long.  The black crappie catch was also high and 55% were at least 8 inches long.</p>",

As was the case in 2017, surplus fry often get stocked into this chain as it is the source of the walleye egg take for the Brainerd Area.  Night electrofishing was conducted on Lower Hay Lake on September 26, 2017 to monitor the abundance of young-of-the-year (YOY) walleyes.  Only one YOY fish was captured, measuring 6.6\" long.  Previous catches have ranged from 0/hr to 53.1/hr.  Walleyes that were age 1 and older were sampled at a rate of 13.3/hr.  They ranged in size from 8.5\" to 23.9\", with an average length of 13.7\".  </p>",

High population levels are indicated by catch rates above the third quartile and low population levels by catch rates below the first quartile.  Catch rates falling between the first and third quartiles are indicative of average, or normal numbers for a particular species. Average size of fish for a particular species or mean weight per individual fish are listed as small, average and large.  Average size is indicated by mean weight falling between the first and third quartile. Small size is indicated by mean weight below the first quartile and large size by mean weight above the third quartile.</p>",
