Walleye fingerlings are currently stocked biennially on even numbered years at a rate of 4.0 pounds per littoral acre (approximately 320.0 lbs.). Despite doubling the stocking rate since 2002, WAE have been sampled in relatively low abundance during the last two assessments. The average size of WAE in the gill net catch was 19.9 inches in length and 2.8 pounds. Growth rates for WAE were found to be average. Northern Pike (NOP) were sampled within the normal range for abundance, but well below the catch rates of previous assessments. The average size of NOP sampled in 2009 was 18.7 inches and 1.7 pounds. Over one-third of all NOP captured measured 26.0 inches in length or longer. Growth rate of sampled NOP was average. Although Hybrid Muskies are still being stocked, none were captured during this assessment. While yellow perch were sampled with the normal range for abundance, the gill net catch rates in 2009 were the lowest recorded on this lake since 1984 and the fish averaged only 6.4 inches in length. Very few black crappies were sampled during this assessment, but captured fish averaged 7.1 inches long and 0.18 pounds. Bluegill (BLG) were captured in relatively high abundance but the catch rate was about one-half of that recorded in 2004. The average size of BLG sampled was 5.6 inches in length and 0.14 pounds, with approximately 4 percent of the catch being 7.0 inches or larger</p>",

Over 3/4 of the fishing pressure is from the piers and shore.  Walleye numbers reached a historic high in 1999, with almost 7 per gillnet.  Sizes ranged from 8-24 inches.  Yellow perch were moderately abundant with no large individuals sampled.  Largemouth bass were common, with fish near 20 inches long captured.  Northern pike were average in number with some over 30 inches long.  Bluegill were abundant with a few over 7 inches long.  Other sunfish species were low in number and small in size.  Black crappie were few in number with none measuring 9 inches.  White sucker, yellow bullhead, sauger, white bass and black bullhead were present in low numbers.</p>",

Water quality in Lake Phalen was good during the past survey, with sufficient dissolved oxygen down to a depth of 40ft and a secchi depth of 9ft. <br> \n <br> \nA near shore Index of Biotic Integrity survey (IBI) was conducted on August 15-16, 2016 to assess populations of non-game species, young-of-the-year (YOY) sport fish, and overall lake health using backpack electrofishing and seining. Electrofishing with a backpack unit and seining were conducted at 10 stations around the perimeter of Lake Phalen.  <br> \n <br> \nEight species were sampled by backpack electrofishing including Iowa Darter, Bluegill, Green Sunfish, Hybrid Sunfish, Largemouth Bass, Rainbow Darter, Yellow Bullhead and Yellow Perch.  Bluegill and Green Sunfish were the most abundant species sampled by backpack eletrofishing.  Phalen is the only lake in the East Metro Area where Rainbow Darters have been sampled.  Eight species were sampled by seining including Iowa Darter, Black Crappie, Bluegill, Largemouth Bass, Northern Pike, Pumpkinseed, Yellow Bullhead and Yellow Perch.  Eleven total species were sampled between both gears in Lake Phalen.  Two intolerant and two toleratn species were sampled during this survey, and Lake Phalen recieved an IBI score of 50.5. <br> \n</p>",

LARGEMOUTH BASS, GREEN SUNFISH, LOGPERCH, JOHNNY DARTER, IOWA DARTER, AND BLUNT- NOSE MINNOW WERE SAMPLED IN SHORELINE SEINING. THE NUMBER OF BLUEGILLS HAS INCREASED DRAMATICALLY (APPROX. 3 TIMES HIGHER) OVER THE 1974 AND 1979 LEVELS, ALTHOUGH ABOUT TWO THIRDS OF THE BLUEGILLS ARE OVER 6.0' IN LENGTH AND THEREFORE DESIRABLE TO MOST ANGLERS. THE POPULATION OF NORTHERN PIKE IS THREE TIMES THE LOCAL MEDIAN LEVEL. THE 1979- 1983 YEAR CLASSES WERE ALL REPRESENTED IN THE POPULATION DESPITE NO STOCKING SINCE 1978 AND LACK OF NPSA OPERATION.

Walleye fingerlings are currently stocked biennially on even numbered years at a rate of 2.0 pounds per littoral acre (158.0 pounds). Walleye were sampled at the lowest catch rate in gill nets since 1989. The average size for sampled fish was 17.7 inches and 2.3 pounds. Northern Pike were sampled above the median level for abundance in gill nets at a level near the 53-year average for this lake. The average size of Northern Pike captured was 21.6 inches and 2.6 pounds, with 21% of the catch measuring 25.0 inches or larger. Growth rate for this species is average. Although Hybrid Muskies are still being stocked, none were captured during this survey. Yellow Perch were sampled in above average numbers in gill nets, which was the third highest catch rate ever recorded for this lake. Black Crappie were sampled in low numbers for both gill and trap nets. The average size of Black Crappie sampled was 7.1 inches and 0.2 pounds. Bluegill were sampled in trap nets at the second highest catch rate ever record recorded for this lake, but they averaged only 5.8 inches and 0.15 pounds in size. Approximately 5.3 percent of the sampled Bluegill measured 7.0 inches or larger. Bluegill growth rate is below average. </p>",

Walleye fall fingerlings are stocked annually at a rate of 2lbs of fish per littoral acre (160lbs), and hybrid Muskellunge are stocked at a rate of 1.5 fall fingerlings per littoral acre (120 fish) during odd numbered years. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye were sampled at a catch per unit effort (CPUE) of 1.83 fish per gillnet.  The average Walleye sampled in 2015 was 14.43 inches long, and fish up to 25\" were present.  Growth was below average with Walleye reaching 13 inches in length by age-3, and 18 inches by age-5.  Northern Pike were sampled at a CPUE of 9.50 per gillnet.  The average pike sampled was 21.43 inches long, and individuals up to 31.5 inches were observed.   <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch CPUE was 12.83 fish per net in gillnets, the average size Yellow Perch sampled was 6.4 inches long, and only 4 fish over 8 inches were sampled.

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Phalen is a 197-acre, class 24 lake located in Ramsey County within the Cities of St. Paul and Maplewood. A regional park surrounds the lake and contains a swimming beach, boat ramp, picnic area, extensive walking and biking trails, and a golf course.  Maximum depth is 97 feet, and only 40% of total lake area is littoral (80 acres, 15 feet deep or less).  The lake is primarily managed for Walleye, White Bass and Hybrid Muskellunge (Tiger Muskellunge) with Largemouth Bass as secondary management species.  Water quality in Lake Phalen was fair during this survey, with sufficient dissolved oxygen down to a depth of 15ft and a secchi depth of 5ft. The purpose of this survey was to assess the success of recent White Bass management, however no White Bass were sampled. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye were sampled at a catch rate of 0.33 fish per gillnet. The two Walleye sampled in 2020 were 17.2 and 20.9 inches long and displayed average growth reaching 17 inches in length by age-5.  Northern Pike were sampled at a catch rate of 2.50 per gillnet.  The average pike sampled was 25.5 inches long, and individuals up to 31.5 inches were observed. Three Yellow Perch were sampled with the largest fish being 6.18 inches long. Bluegills, averaging 6.0 inches were sampled at a catch rate of of 12.0 per gill net, with the largest at 8.1 inches.  Black Crappie catch rate was 3.0 per gill net and slightly below average for lakes similar to Phalen. Black Crappie averaged 6.7 inches, with largest measuring 9.0 inches. Other fish sampled in low abundance were Yellow and Black Bullheads, Pumpkinseed Sunfish and Largemouth Bass. <br> \n</p>",
