The northern pike population appears to be dominated by small fish aged II+ and III+.  <br> \n     Abundance of the three bullhead species was similar to area medians.  <br> \n     Bluegill abundance increased from 6.3 per trap net lift in 1982 to 74.2 per net. The increase in abundance does not appear to have significantly changed the length distribution, as 10% of the bluegills measured were 7.0 inches or greater in length compared to 7% in 1982.  The bluegill population appears dominated by small fish exhibiting slow growth rates.  <br> \n     Largemouth bass reproduction appears good, as four age-classes were represented in the sample.  <br> \n     Black crappie reproduction also appears good, as three age-classes were represented in the sample.  <br> \n     Yellow perch were not sampled during this survey, and only 10 were sampled in 1982.  <br> \n     Walleye abundance increased from 1.3 per gill net lift in 1982 to 4.0 per net.

                "narrative": "<p>Molly Stark Lake is located almost entirely within Glendalough State Park.  Four private residences are located on the south shore.  The park is located about five miles northeast of the town of Battle Lake in central Otter Tail County off of County Road 16.  Molly Stark lies within a chain of lakes between West Battle and Otter Tail Lake.  West Battle Lake is about 0.5 miles upstream, and Annie Battle Lake lies about 0.25 miles downstream of Molly Stark Lake.  Annie Battle Lake is connected to Blanche Lake, which in turn connects to Otter Tail Lake.  Molly Stark has an area of 153 acres, and reaches a maximum depth of 48 feet.  A concrete public water access is located within Glendalough State Park.     Molly Stark Lake has good populations of northern pike, largemouth bass, and bluegill, as well as moderate numbers of walleye, black crappie, rock bass, and pumpkinseed sunfish.  There are also several species of non-game fish present.  No fish species are presently stocked in the lake.     Walleye catches averaged 0.8 per gill net, which is below the previous survey (1.7) and the statewide median (2.5) for this type of lake.  Although numbers were low, the average size was large.  Walleye averaged 20 inches and 2.35 lbs.  Molly Stark lacks gravel and cobble substrates required for spawning, so it is likely that walleye are migrants from either West Battle, Blanche, or Otter Tail Lake.     Northern pike catches averaged 7.0 per gill net, which is near the statewide median (6.7), but below the previous survey (8.8).  Pike averaged 15.8 inches, and 2% were greater than 24.0 inches.   The largest individual measured 34.0 inches in length.  Growth is slow, as pike reached an average of 13.7 inches by age 4, while the area average at age 4 for lakes of this type is 18.1 inches.  In the previous survey, the average size was 18.1 inches, and 10% were greater than 24.0 inches, but growth rates were similarly slow.     Largemouth bass catches averaged 1.5 per gill net and 1.8 per trap net.  Both exceed the expected catches for this lake type.  The average size was 10.6 inches from gill nets and 8.5 inches in trap nets.  The previous survey found similar numbers.  Bass, especially larger individuals,  are typically not sampled very efficiently by either type of gear, so it is likely that these figures under-represent the true bass population.     Black crappie catches increased to 2.0 per trap net from 0.9 in the previous survey.  Both are within the expected range for this lake type.  The average size was 8.7 inches, and 11% were greater than 10.0 inches.  Crappie reached 7.9 inches at age 4 which is slightly below area averages for this lake type.     Bluegill catches averaged 42.8 per trap net, an increase from the previous survey when the average was 16.8 per trap net.  The present catch rate is at the upper end of the range typical for this lake type, but catch rates have ranged widely in this lake (6.3 - 74.2).  The average size was 5.5 inches, and 11% were over 7.0 inches in length.  A similar size distribution was observed in the previous survey.  Bluegill were an average of 5.6 inches at age 7, which is slow growth for this lake type.     Tullibee catches averaged 2.3 per gill net, which is typical for this lake type.  The average size was 13.5 inches.  The previous survey found 3.7 per gill net.  One lake whitefish, most likely a migrant from West Battle Lake, was also captured in this survey.     Yellow perch catches were low, averaging 0.3 per gill net.  Rock bass averaged 4.7 per trap net, which is higher than previous surveys.  Pumpkinseed sunfish averaged 3.3 per trap net, and hybrid sunfish averaged 5.6 per trap net.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Molly Stark Lake is a 153-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located almost entirely within Glendalough State Park, approximately five miles northeast of the town of Battle Lake, MN.  There is an unnavigable inlet along the southeast shoreline that connects Molly Stark to West Battle Lake.  An unnavigable outlet along the northeast shoreline flows into Annie Battle Lake.  The immediate watershed is composed primarily of hardwood woodlots and pasture.  The maximum depth is 48 feet and 43% of the lake is 15 feet or less in depth.  The shoreline length is 1.8 miles.  The secchi disk reading, a standard measure of water clarity, during the survey was 13.0 feet.  Secchi disk readings from previous surveys have ranged from 11.0 to 17.0 feet.  Molly Stark Lake is included in lake class 31 of the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources' (DNR) lake classification scheme.      A majority of the lakeshore is located within Glendalough State Park; therefore, development is very limited.  A DNR owned concrete public water access is located along the southwest shore.  A picnic area and shelter with a swimming beach is located on the north shore within the state park.  There are three private residences located along the southeast shore.       The predominant shoreline substrate is sand.  Chara, also referred to as sand grass, is the most abundant submerged aquatic plant in the shoal water areas.  The most prevalent emergent aquatic plant is hardstem bulrush, which is found in scattered beds mainly along the east and northwest shorelines.  These emergent plants provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat and are critical in maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms from wave erosion and help absorb excess nutrients.  Emergent plants also provide critical spawning habitat for several fish species including northern pike, largemouth bass, and panfish.  They also serve as important nursery areas for many species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants cannot be removed without a DNR permit.     Molly Stark Lake can be ecologically classified as a bass-panfish type of lake and this is reflected in the assemblage of the fish community.  Northern pike, largemouth bass, and bluegill are the dominant fish species in Molly Stark Lake.  Tullibee are a popular target of ice fisherman.     A high-density northern pike population exists.  The gill net catch rate, 10.0 per net, is equivalent to the upper limit of the normal range for class 31 lakes.  Northern pike ranged in length from 12.3 to 33.9 inches with an average length and weight of 18.0 inches and 1.4 pounds.  Northern pike growth rates are slow, which may correspond with the low abundance of yellow perch, a preferred forage specie.  Pike reach an average length of 19.3 inches at four years of age.      Data collected from a spring electrofishing assessment indicated that Molly Stark Lake has a balanced largemouth bass population.  Largemouth bass reproduction appears to be consistently good.  Largemouth bass ranged in length from 7.6 to 15.1 inches with an average length and weight of 11.1 inches and 0.7 pounds.  Bass attain an average length of 11.7 inches at four years of age.     The bluegill trap net catch rate was 32.9 per net, which is within the normal range for class 31 lakes.  There are several strong year classes which should provide good bluegill angling for several years.  Twenty-six percent of the bluegill in the trap net sample were 7.0 inches or greater in length.  No bluegill 8.0 inches or greater in length have ever been sampled in a survey.  Bluegill reach an average length of 6.8 inches at seven years of age.       Walleye are present, but in low numbers.  This is likely due to the lack of suitable spawning habitat.  Walleye ranged in length from 16.2 to 20.7 inches with an average length and weight of 18.4 inches and 2.3 pounds.       Anglers can maintain the quality of fishing in Molly Stark Lake by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large-size fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future.      </p>",

A survey targeting near shore fish species was conducted by IBI Program Staff on Molly Stark Lake on 30 July 2015 to assess populations of non-game species and small sport fish. Ten 100-foot sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake shore, sampling a variety of habitat types. Each site was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot 1/8th-inch mesh seine, depending on habitat condition.   <br> \n <br> \nDuring this assessment, eight sites were sampled with a 50-foot seine and two sites with a 15-foot seine. Backpack electrofishing was done on foot along the shoreline at all 10 sites. Nearshore sampling captured 19 species of fish including many species intolerant of disturbance such as Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, Logperch, Mimic Shiner, Pugnose Shiner, and Rock Bass. Other species sampled during the nearshore effort included Bigmouth Shiner, Bluegill, Bluntnose Minnow, Brook Stickleback, Golden Shiner, Green Sunfish, Johnny Darter, Largemouth Bass, Pumpkinseed, Spottail Shiner, and Yellow Perch. Nearshore catches are used along with gillnet and trapnet catch data from a survey on 24 - 27 August 2015, to calculate a fish-based Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) score which is indicative of the health of Molly Stark Lake. The fish IBI score for Molly Stark Lake was exceptionally high compared to similar lakes; of note were the high numbers of intolerant, small benthic, and vegetation-dwelling species sampled, the high proportion of small benthic dwelling individuals in the nearshore catch, the high proportion of biomass of insectivorous species and the low proportion of biomass of omnivorous species in the trap net catch. <br> \n <br> \nA review of potential stressors found watershed (53% disturbed land cover) characteristics at a level surpassing those thought to impact the fish community, and riparian (2015 Score the Shore survey score: 88/100; approximately 1 docks per kilometer of shoreline) characteristics at levels thought to have minimal impact on the fish community. <br> \n <br> \nThis survey is contributing to a watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency. Molly Stark Lake is located in the Otter Tail River Watershed. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>    Molly Stark Lake is a 153-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located almost entirely within Glendalough State Park approximately three miles northeast of Battle Lake, MN.  There is a non-navigable inlet along the southeast shoreline that connects Molly Stark to West Battle Lake.  A non-navigable outlet along the northeast shoreline flows into Annie Battle Lake.  The immediate watershed is composed primarily of hardwood woodlots and grasslands.  The maximum depth is 48 feet; however, 43% of the lake is 15 feet or less in depth.  Shoreline length is 1.8 miles.  The secchi disk reading during the 2010 lake survey was 8.5 feet.  Previous secchi disk readings have ranged from 11.0 to 17.0 feet.   <br> \n     The majority of the shoreline is located within the state park; therefore, development is very limited.  A DNR owned public access is located in the park along the southwest shoreline. A picnic area, shelter, and swimming beach are located along the north shoreline.  Three private residences are located along the southeast shoreline.  The dominant shoreline substrate is sand.  The most prevalent emergent aquatic plant is hardstem bulrush, which is found in scattered beds mainly along the east and northwest shorelines.  These emergent plants provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat and are critical in maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms from wave erosion and help absorb excess nutrients.  Emergent plants also provide critical spawning habitat for several fish species including northern pike, largemouth bass, and panfish.  They also serve as important nursery areas for many species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants cannot be removed without a DNR permit. <br> \n     Molly Stark Lake can be ecologically classified as a bass-panfish type of lake and this is reflected in the assemblage of the fish community.  Northern pike, largemouth bass, and bluegill are the dominant gamefish species.  Tullibees are a popular target of ice fishermen. <br> \n     A moderate-density northern pike population exists.  Northern pike ranged in length from 11.4 to 29.8 inches with an average length and weight of 17.2 inches and 1.1 pounds.  Northern pike growth rates are slow, which may correspond with the low abundance of yellow perch, a preferred forage specie.  <br> \n     Data collected from a spring electrofishing assessment indicated that Molly Stark Lake has a balanced largemouth bass population.  Largemouth bass reproduction appears to be consistently good.  Largemouth bass ranged in length from 7.4 to 17.4 inches with an average length and weight of 11.0 inches and 0.8 pounds.  <br> \n     Bluegill abundance has historically fluctuated.  There are several strong year classes which should provide good bluegill angling for several years.  Twenty percent of the bluegills in the trap net sample were 7.0 inches or greater in length.     <br> \n     Walleye abundance is low; however, the average size is good.   Walleyes ranged in length from 16.5 to 23.7 inches with an average length and weight of 19.8 inches and 2.8 pounds.   <br> \n      Anglers can maintain the quality of fishing in Molly Stark Lake by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large size fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>     Molly Stark Lake is a 153-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located almost entirely within Glendalough State Park approximately three miles northeast of Battle Lake, MN.  There is a non-navigable inlet along the southeast shoreline that connects Molly Stark to West Battle Lake.  A non-navigable outlet along the northeast shoreline flows into Annie Battle Lake.  The immediate watershed is composed primarily of hardwood woodlots and grasslands.  The maximum depth is 48 feet, however, 43% of the lake is 15 feet or less in depth.  Shoreline length is 1.8 miles.  The secchi disk reading during the 2006 lake survey was 14.0 feet.  Previous secchi disk readings have ranged from 11.0 to 17.0 feet.  The MN DNR has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different lake classes based on physical and chemical characteristics. Molly Stark Lake is included in lake class 31; other area lakes in this same classification include Annie Battle, Johnson, Pebble, Portage, and Wall. <br> \n     The majority of the shoreline is located within the state park; therefore, development is very limited.  A DNR owned public access is located in the park along the southwest shoreline. A picnic area, shelter, and swimming beach are located along the north shoreline.  Three private residences are located along the southeast shoreline.  The dominant shoreline substrate is sand.  The most prevalent emergent aquatic plant is hardstem bulrush, which is found in scattered beds mainly along the east and northwest shorelines.  These emergent plants provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat and are critical in maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms from wave erosion and help absorb excess nutrients.  Emergent plants also provide critical spawning habitat for several fish species including northern pike, largemouth bass, and panfish.  They also serve as important nursery areas for many species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants cannot be removed without a DNR permit. <br> \n     Molly Stark Lake can be ecologically classified as a bass-panfish type of lake and this is reflected in the assemblage of the fish community.  Northern pike, largemouth bass, and bluegill are the dominant gamefish species in Molly Stark Lake.  Tullibee are a popular target of ice fisherman. <br> \n     A moderate-density northern pike population exists.  The gill net catch rate is within the expectd range for similar lakes.  Northern pike ranged in length from 11.0 to 28.6 inches with an average length and weight of 16.2 inches and 0.9 pounds.  Northern pike growth rates are slow, which may correspond with the low abundance of yellow perch, a preferred forage specie.  <br> \n     Data collected from a spring electrofishing assessment indicated that Molly Stark Lake has a balanced largemouth bass population.  Largemouth bass reproduction appears to be consistently good.  Largemouth bass ranged in length from 7.4 to 17.4 inches with an average length and weight of 11.0 inches and 0.8 pounds.  <br> \n     The bluegill trap net catch rate was within the expectedl range for similar lakes.  There are several strong year classes which should provide good bluegill angling for several years.  Twenty-two percent of the bluegill in the trap net sample were 7.0 inches or greater in length.     <br> \n     Walleye are present, but in low numbers.  This is likely due to a lack of suitable spawning habitat.  Walleye ranged in length from 18.0 to 23.2 inches with an average length and weight of 20.4 inches and 2.7 pounds.   <br> \n      Anglers can maintain the quality of fishing in Molly Stark Lake by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large size fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>     Molly Stark Lake is a 153-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located almost entirely within Glendalough State Park approximately three miles northeast of Battle Lake, MN.  There is a non-navigable inlet along the southeast shoreline that connects Molly Stark to West Battle Lake.  A non-navigable outlet along the northeast shoreline flows into Annie Battle Lake.  The immediate watershed is composed primarily of hardwood woodlots and grasslands.  The maximum depth is 48 feet; however, 43% of the lake is 15 feet or less in depth.  Shoreline length is 1.8 miles.  The secchi disk reading during the 2015 lake survey was 9.6 feet.  Previous secchi disk readings have ranged from 8.5 to 17.0 feet.   <br> \n     The majority of the shoreline is located within the state park; therefore, development is very limited.  A DNR owned public access is located in the park along the southwest shoreline. A picnic area, shelter, and swimming beach are located along the north shoreline.  Three private residences are located along the southeast shoreline.  The dominant shoreline substrate is sand.  The most prevalent emergent aquatic plant is hardstem bulrush, which is found in scattered beds mainly along the east and northwest shorelines.  These emergent plants provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat and are critical in maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms from wave erosion and help absorb excess nutrients.  Emergent plants also provide critical spawning habitat for several fish species including Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, and panfish.  They also serve as important nursery areas for many species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants cannot be removed without a DNR permit. <br> \n     Molly Stark Lake can be ecologically classified as a bass-panfish type of lake and this is reflected in the assemblage of the fish community.  Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, and Bluegill are the dominant gamefish species.   <br> \n     A moderate-density Northern Pike population exists.  Northern Pike ranged in length from 11.7 to 35.4 inches with an average length and weight of 16.4 inches and 1.1 pounds.  Pike attain an average length of 18.4 inches at four years of age.  <br> \n     Data collected from a spring electrofishing assessment indicated that Molly Stark Lake has a balanced Largemouth Bass population.  Age data indicate that Largemouth Bass reproduction is consistently good.  Largemouth Bass ranged in length from 6.6 to 19.3 inches with an average length and weight of 11.2 inches and 0.9 pounds.   Bass attain an average length of 11.7 inches at four years of age. <br> \n     Bluegill abundance has historically fluctuated.  There are several strong year classes which should provide good Bluegill angling for several years.  Twenty-one percent of the Bluegills were 7.0 inches or greater in length.  Bluegills attain an average length of 6.8 inches at six years of age.     <br> \n     Anglers can maintain the quality of fishing in Molly Stark Lake by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large size fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future. <br> \n</p>",
