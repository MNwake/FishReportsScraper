                "narrative": "<p>     Swan Lake is a 689-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located in southwestern Otter Tail County approximately three miles southeast of Fergus Falls, MN.  Swan Lake is part of the Pomme de Terre River Watershed.  The Pomme de Terre River outlet is located along the south shoreline of the lake.  The outlet is unnavigable.  The immediate watershed of Swan Lake is composed primarily of agricultural land interspersed with hardwood woodlots.  The maximum depth of Swan Lake is 44 feet; however, 54% of the lake is less than 15 feet in depth.  The secchi disk reading during the 2013 lake survey was 9.5 feet.  Previous secchi disk readings ranged from 4.5 to 17.2 feet.  Periodic plankton/algae blooms during the summer months can influence secchi disk readings.   <br> \n     A majority of the shoreline of Swan Lake has been developed.  The development consists primarily of homes and cottages.  A resort/campground is located along the east shoreline.  A DNR owned public water access is also located along the east shoreline of the lake.  The shoal water substrates consist primarily of sand, gravel, and rubble.  Hardstem bulrush and common cattail are prevalent along the shoreline of the southern portion of Swan Lake.  Emergent aquatic plants such as hardstem bulrush and cattail provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat, and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms, and can actually absorb and break down polluting chemicals.  Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish such as Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, and panfish.  They also serve as an important nursery area for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit. <br> \n     Because of its proximity to Fergus Falls, Swan Lake is a popular angling lake.  Swan Lake can be ecologically classified as a bass-panfish type of lake and this is reflected in the assemblage of the fish community.  Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, Black Crappie, and Bluegill are the dominant gamefish species in Swan Lake.   <br> \n     A high-density Northern Pike population exists.  Age data indicate that Northern Pike reproduction is consistently good. Northern Pike ranged in length from 12.6 to 32.8 inches with an average length and weight of 20.4 inches and 1.9 pounds. Northern Pike attain an average length of 24.4 inches at five years of age.   <br> \n     Data from a spring electrofishing assessment indicate that a balanced Largemouth Bass population exists.  Bass ranged in length from 7.5 inches to 20.0 inches with an average length and weight of 14.4 inches and 1.9 pounds.  Age data indicate that Largemouth Bass reproduction is consistently good.  Largemouth Bass attain an average length of 13.7 inches at four years of age.   <br> \n     Blluegill abundance exceeds the normal range for this type of lake.  Bluegill abundance and size structure tends to fluctuate due to inconsistent reproduction.  Twenty-four percent of the Bluegills were 7.0 inches or greater in length.  Bluegills attain an average length of 7.0 inches at six years of age.   <br> \n     Data from a spring trapnetting assessment indicate that the Black Crappie population is abundant and a good size structure exists.  Fifty-one percent of the Black Crappies were 10.0 inches or greater in length.  Crappies attain an average length of 9.9 inches at five years of age.  <br> \n     Walleye abundance has remained stable in recent surveys.  Walleyes ranged in length from 10.3 to 27.3 inches with an average length and weight of 19.2 inches and 2.7 pounds.  Walleyes attain an average length of 16.7 inches at four years of age.   <br> \n     Anglers can maintain the quality of fishing in Swan Lake by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large-size fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of nearshore fish species in Swan Lake was conducted on July 1, 2019 by Fergus Falls Area Fisheries staff.  Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible.  Backpack electrofishing was completed at thirteen sampling stations, but one station was sampled from the boat due to site conditions.  Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample four stations and a 15-foot seine was used at ten stations.  Nearshore sampling captured 23 species of fish including 7 species that are intolerant of disturbance (Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, Least Darter, Pugnose Shiner, and Rock Bass) and 1 that are tolerant of disturbance (Green Sunfish). <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore data were combined with trap net and gill net data from a July 5, 2017 survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based IBI (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment.  In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g., Blackchin Shiner, Iowa Darter, Least Darter), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g., Black Bullhead, Green Sunfish,).  The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake.  For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.   <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Pomme de Terre Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>     Swan Lake is a 689-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located in southwestern Otter Tail County approximately three miles southeast of Fergus Falls, MN.  Swan Lake is part of the Pomme de Terre River Watershed.  The Pomme de Terre River outlet is located along the south shoreline of the lake and is unnavigable.  The immediate watershed of Swan Lake is composed primarily of agricultural land interspersed with hardwood woodlots.  The maximum depth of Swan Lake is 44 feet; however, 54% of the lake is less than 15 feet in depth.  The secchi disk reading during the 2022 survey was 8.1 feet.  Previous secchi disk readings have ranged from 4.5 to 17.2 feet.     <br> \n     A majority of the shoreline of Swan Lake has been developed.  The development consists primarily of homes and cottages.  A resort/campground is located along the southeast shoreline.  A DNR owned concrete public water access is located along the east shoreline of the lake.  The shoal water substrates consist primarily of sand, gravel, and rubble.  Hardstem bulrush and common cattail are prevalent along the shoreline of the southern portion of Swan Lake.  Emergent aquatic plants such as hardstem bulrush and cattail provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat, and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms, and can actually absorb and break down polluting chemicals.  Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish such as Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, and panfish.  They also serve as an important nursery area for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit. <br> \n     Because of its proximity to Fergus Falls, Swan Lake is a popular angling lake.  Swan Lake can be ecologically classified as a bass-panfish type of lake and this is reflected in the assemblage of the fish community.  Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, Black Crappie, and Bluegill are the dominant gamefish species in Swan Lake.   <br> \n     Northern Pike abundance has remained high, but the size structure has improved in recent surveys.  Age data indicate that Northern Pike reproduction is consistently good. Northern Pike ranged in length from 18.3 to 27.6 inches with an average length and weight of 22.1 inches and 2.3 pounds. Northern Pike attain an average length of 25.5 inches at five years of age.   <br> \n     Data from a spring electrofishing survey indicate that a balanced Largemouth Bass population exists.  Age data indicate that Largemouth Bass reproduction is consistently good.  Largemouth Bass ranged in length from 2.9 inches to 19.5 inches with an average length and weight of 14.3 inches and 1.8 pounds.  Largemouth Bass attain an average length of 13.1 inches at four years of age.   <br> \n     Data from a spring trapnetting survey indicate that the Black Crappie population is abundant and that the size structure is good.  Black Crappies ranged in length from 4.9 to 13.7 inches.  Thirty-five percent of the Black Crappies were 10.0 inches or greater in length.  Black Crappies attain an average length of 10.6 inches at five years of age.  <br> \n     Bluegill abundance and size structure tend to fluctuate due to inconsistent reproduction.  Only one percent of the Bluegills were 7.0 inches or greater in length.  Bluegills attain an average length of 6.7 inches at seven years of age.   <br> \n     Walleye abundance has historically remained at a moderate level.  Walleyes ranged in length from 7.0 to 25.8 inches with an average length and weight of 17.2 inches and 2.0 pounds.  Walleyes attain an average length of 16.8 at four years of age.   <br> \n     Anglers can maintain the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large-size fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future. <br> \n     Swan Lake was listed as infested with zebra mussels in 2019.  Aquatic invasive species are threatening Minnesota waters.  Aquatic invasive species can potentially harm water quality, water recreation, aquatic habitat, native species, and fish populations.  Anglers can help prevent the introduction and spread of invasive species by following watercraft transportation laws.      <br> \n</p>",

A total of 25 largemouth bass were sampled with a catch rate of 7.5 per hour.  The average weight of bass sampled was 0.5 lbs. <br> \n     Test-netting results indicate that the northern pike, walleye, bluegill, and bullhead populations exceed both local and state medians. Yellow perch catch per net was well below both local and state medians.  <br> \n     Northern pike abundance is high and the average size is small.  Effort should be made to reduce northern pike numbers to a desirable level and possibly, as a result, the yellow perch population may increase to the 1980 level of 18.0 per lift.    <br> \n     The walleye population is in good shape with ages-I+ thru VII+ represented in the sample.  Ageing data indicate strong age-IV+ and age-VI+ age-classes with the age-V class being exceptionally strong.  The stocking history indicates that the age-IV class corresponds to a skip year in the stocking program.   <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>     Swan Lake is a 689-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located in southwestern Otter Tail County approximately three miles southeast of Fergus Falls, MN.  Swan Lake is part of the Pomme de Terre River Watershed.  The Pomme de Terre River outlet is located along the south shoreline of the lake.  The outlet is unnavigable.  The immediate watershed of Swan Lake is composed primarily of agricultural land interspersed with hardwood woodlots.  The maximum depth of Swan Lake is 44 feet; however, 54% of the lake is less than 15 feet in depth.  The secchi disk reading during the 2009 lake survey was 10.1 feet.  Previous secchi disk readings ranged from 4.5 to 17.2 feet.  Periodic plankton/algae blooms during the summer months can influence secchi disk readings.   <br> \n     A majority of the shoreline of Swan Lake has been developed.  The development consists primarily of homes and cottages.  A DNR owned public water access is located along the east shoreline of the lake.  The shoal water substrates consist primarily of sand, gravel, and rubble.  Hardstem bulrush and common cattail are prevalent along the shoreline of the southern portion of Swan Lake.  Emergent aquatic plants such as hardstem bulrush and cattail provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat, and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms, and can actually absorb and break down polluting chemicals.  Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish such as northern pike, largemouth bass, and panfish.  They also serve as an important nursery area for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit. <br> \n     Because of its proximity to Fergus Falls, Swan Lake is a popular angling lake.  Swan Lake can be ecologically classified as a bass-panfish type of lake and this is reflected in the assemblage of the fish community.  Northern pike, largemouth bass, and bluegill are the dominant gamefish species in Swan Lake.   <br> \n     The northern pike test-net catch rate was within the normal range for similar lakes.  Age data indicate that northern pike reproduction is consistently good. Northern pike ranged in length from 13.6 to 36.2 inches with an average length and weight of 20.9 inches and 2.2 pounds. Northern pike attain an average length of 23.7 inches at five years of age.   <br> \n     Data from recent assessments indicate that a balanced largemouth bass population exists.  Bass ranged in length from 11.7 inches to 16.7 inches with an average length and weight of 14.5 inches and 1.8 pounds.  Age data indicate that largemouth bass reproduction is consistently good.  Largemouth bass attain an average length of 11.3 inches at four years of age.   <br> \n     The bluegill test-net catch rate was within the normal range for similar lakes.  Age data from recent assessments indicate that bluegill reproduction is inconsistent.  Four percent of the bluegills were 7.0 inches or greater in length.  Bluegills attain an average length of 6.3 inches at five years of age.   <br> \n     The walleye test-net catch rate was within the normal range for similar lakes.  Walleyes ranged in length from 9.5 to 27.5 inches with an average length and weight of 16.9 inches and 1.8 pounds.  Walleye attain a mean length of 13.1 inches at four years of age.   <br> \n     Anglers can maintain the quality of fishing in Swan Lake by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large-size fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future.  <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Swan Lake is a 689-acre mesotrophic lake located in southwestern Otter Tail County approximately three miles southeast of Fergus Falls, MN.  Swan Lake is part of the Pomme de Terre River Watershed.  The Pomme de Terre River outlet is located along the south shoreline of the lake.  The outlet is unnavigable.  The immediate watershed of Swan Lake is composed primarily of agricultural land interspersed with hardwood woodlots.  The maximum depth of Swan Lake is 44 feet; however, 54% of the lake is less than 15 feet in depth.  The secchi disk reading during the 2005 lake survey was 4.5 feet.  Previous secchi disk readings ranged from 6.5 to 17.2 feet.  Periodic plankton/algae blooms during the summer months can influence secchi disk readings.  Swan Lake is included in class 25 of the MN DNR lake classification scheme.       A majority of the shoreline of Swan Lake has been developed.  The development consists primarily of homes and cottages.  The 1994 lake survey referenced 125 homes/cottages and one resort.  A DNR owned public water access is located along the east shoreline of the lake.  The shoal water substrates consist primarily of sand, gravel, and rubble.  Hardstem bulrush and common cattail are prevalent along the shoreline of the southern portion of Swan Lake.  Emergent aquatic plants such as hardstem bulrush and cattail provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat, and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms, and can actually absorb and break down polluting chemicals.  Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish such as northern pike, largemouth bass, and panfish.  They also serve as an important nursery area for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit.     Because of its proximity to Fergus Falls, Swan Lake is a popular angling lake.  Swan Lake can be ecologically classified as a bass-panfish type of lake and this is reflected in the assemblage of the fish community.  Northern pike, largemouth bass, black crappie, and bluegill are the dominant fish species in Swan Lake.  The prolificacy of these species can be attributed to the abundance of suitable spawning habitat that is available.       A high-density northern pike population exists.  Age data indicate that pike reproduction is consistently good.  Northern pike ranged in length from 11.5 to 31.3 inches with an average length and weight of 18.1 inches and 1.4 pounds.  Northern pike attain an average length of 20.5 inches at five years of age.  Growth rate estimates are slower than average northern pike growth rates for class 25 lakes in the Fergus Falls Management Area.     Data collected from a spring electrofishing assessment indicated that Swan Lake has a high-density largemouth bass population.  Largemouth bass reproduction is also consistently good.  Bass ranged in length from 3.5 to 16.5 inches with an average length and weight of 11.8 inches and 0.9 pound.  Largemouth bass attain an average length of 11.9 inches at four years of age.  Growth rate estimates are equivalent to average bass growth rates for class 25 lakes in the Fergus Falls Management Area.     The black crappie test-net catch rate was within the normal range for class 25 lakes.  Crappies ranged in length from 5.8 to 13.7 inches with an average length and weight of 8.9 inches and 0.5 pound.  Thirty-eight percent of the crappies were at least 9.0 inches in length.  Black crappie attain an average length of 9.6 inches at five years of age.  Growth rate estimates are slower than average black crappie growth rates for class 25 lakes in the Fergus Falls Management Area.     The bluegill test-net catch rate was within the normal range for class 25 lakes.  Age data from recent assessments indicate that bluegill reproduction is inconsistent.   Nine percent of the bluegills were at least 7.0 inches in length.  Bluegill attain an average length of 6.6 inches at seven years of age.  Growth rate estimates are slower than average bluegill growth rates for class 25 lakes in the Fergus Falls Management Area.       The walleye test-net catch rate was within the normal range for class 25 lakes.  The DNR stocks 371,000 walleye fry on a biennial basis and natural reproduction also contributes to the walleye population.  Walleye ranged in length from 7.1 to 27.1 inches with an average length and weight of 14.2 inches and 1.3 pounds.  Walleye exhibit good growth with an average length of 14.3 inches at three years of age.     Anglers can maintain the quality of fishing in Swan Lake by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large-size fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future. </p>",

Average weight of northern pike was 1.1 pounds.  Age data indicate good reproduction as fish aged from I+ to IV+ were represented in the sample.  <br> \n     Bluegill abundance was unchanged from 1984 at 69.3 per trap net lift. The size structure of the bluegill population does not appear to have changed much over time and growth rates appear to be good. Of the bluegill measured, 15% were greater than 7.0 inches in length.  <br> \n     Largemouth bass abundance appears to have increased significantly from 1.4 per gill net lift in 1984 to 11.0 during this survey. Largemouth bass reproduction appears to be good as fish aged II+ to V+ were well represented in the sample with a strong 1985 year class.  <br> \n     Yellow perch abundance has increased, but still remains below the area median.  <br> \n     Walleye abundance declined from 11.6 per gill net in 1984 to 6.3, which is similar to that found in previous surveys.

                "narrative": "<p>   Swan Lake is a 689-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located in southwestern Otter Tail County approximately three miles southeast of Fergus Falls, MN.  Swan Lake is part of the Pomme de Terre River Watershed.  The Pomme de Terre River outlet is located along the south shoreline of the lake.  The outlet is unnavigable.  The immediate watershed of Swan Lake is composed primarily of agricultural land interspersed with hardwood woodlots.  The maximum depth of Swan Lake is 44 feet; however, 54% of the lake is less than 15 feet in depth.  The secchi disk reading was 9.5 feet.  Previous secchi disk readings have ranged from 4.5 to 17.2 feet.     <br> \n     A majority of the shoreline of Swan Lake has been developed.  The development consists primarily of homes and cottages.  A resort/campground is located along the southeast shoreline.  A DNR owned public water access is located along the east shoreline of the lake.  The shoal water substrates consist primarily of sand, gravel, and rubble.  Hardstem bulrush and common cattail are prevalent along the shoreline of the southern portion of Swan Lake.  Emergent aquatic plants such as hardstem bulrush and cattail provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat, and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms, and can actually absorb and break down polluting chemicals.  Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish such as Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, and panfish.  They also serve as an important nursery area for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit. <br> \n     Because of its proximity to Fergus Falls, Swan Lake is a popular angling lake.  Swan Lake can be ecologically classified as a bass-panfish type of lake and this is reflected in the assemblage of the fish community.  Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, Black Crappie, and Bluegill are the dominant gamefish species in Swan Lake.   <br> \n     A high-density Northern Pike population exists.  Age data indicate that Northern Pike reproduction is consistently good. Northern Pike ranged in length from 17.5 to 30.6 inches with an average length and weight of 23.3 inches and 2.7 pounds. Northern Pike attain an average length of 25.1 inches at five years of age.   <br> \n     Data from a spring electrofishing assessment indicate that a balanced Largemouth Bass population exists.  Bass ranged in length from 5.1 inches to 18.9 inches with an average length and weight of 10.6 inches and 0.9 pounds.  Age data indicate that Largemouth Bass reproduction is consistently good.  Largemouth Bass attain an average length of 13.3 inches at four years of age.   <br> \n     Bluegill abundance and size structure tend to fluctuate due to inconsistent reproduction.  Eight percent of the Bluegills were 7.0 inches or greater in length.  Bluegills attain an average length of 7.1 inches at six years of age.   <br> \n     Data from a spring trapnetting assessment indicate that the Black Crappie population is abundant and that the size structure is good.  Forty-one percent of the Black Crappies were 10.0 inches or greater in length.  Crappies attain an average length of 11.5 inches at five years of age.  <br> \n     Walleye abundance has remained at a low to moderate level in recent surveys.  Walleyes ranged in length from 9.6 to 24.8 inches with an average length and weight of 20.6 inches and 3.2 pounds.  Walleyes attain an average length of 15.8 inches at four years of age.   <br> \n     Anglers can maintain the quality of fishing in Swan Lake by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large-size fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future. <br> \n     Swan Lake is not listed as an infested water.  Aquatic invasive species are threatening Minnesota waters.  The non-native species can potentially harm water quality, water recreation, aquatic habitat, native species, and fish populations.  Anglers can help prevent the introduction and spread of invasive species by following watercraft transportation laws.  Anglers are required to remove all visible plants, mud, and other prohibited invasive species and drain all water from their boat prior to leaving the water access.     <br> \n   </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Swan Lake is a 689-acre mesotrophic lake located in southwestern Otter Tail County approximately three miles southeast of Fergus Falls, MN.  Swan Lake is part of the Pomme de Terre River Watershed; the Pomme de Terre River outlet is located along the south shoreline of the lake.  The outlet is unnavigable.  The immediate watershed of Swan Lake is composed primarily of agricultural land interspersed with hardwood woodlots.  The maximum depth of Swan Lake is 44 feet; however, 54% of the lake is less than 15 feet in depth.  The secchi disk reading during the 2001 lake survey was 11.5 feet, indicating excellent water clarity.  Previous secchi disk readings have ranged from 6.5 to 17.2 feet.  Periodic plankton/algae blooms during the summer months can influence secchi disk readings.  Swan Lake is included in lake class 25 of the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources' (DNR) lake classification scheme.       A majority of the shoreline of Swan Lake has been developed.  The development consists primarily of homes and cottages.  The 1994 lake survey referenced 125 homes/cottages and one resort.  A DNR owned public water access is located along the east shoreline of the lake.  The shoal water substrates consist primarily of sand, gravel, and rubble.  Hardstem bulrush and common cattail are prevalent along the shoreline of the southern portion of Swan Lake.  Emergent aquatic plants such as hardstem bulrush and cattail provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat, and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms, and can actually absorb and break down polluting chemicals.  Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish such as northern pike, largemouth bass, and panfish.  They also serve as an important nursery area for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit.     Because of its proximity to Fergus Falls, Swan Lake is a popular angling lake.  Swan Lake can be ecologically classified as a bass-panfish type of lake and this is reflected in the assemblage of the fish community.  Northern pike, largemouth bass, black crappie, and bluegill are the dominant fish species in Swan Lake.  The prolificacy of these species can be attributed to the abundance of suitable spawning habitat that is available.       A high-density northern pike population exists.  The northern pike test-net catch rate has exceeded the upper limit of the normal range for class 25 lakes in every survey conducted.  Age data indicate that pike reproduction is consistently good.  Northern pike ranged in length from 10.6 to 30.7 inches with an average length and weight of 18.1 inches and 1.1 pounds.  Northern pike attain an average length of 23.2 inches at five years of age.      Data collected from a spring electrofishing assessment indicated that Swan Lake has a high-density largemouth bass population.  Largemouth bass reproduction is also consistently good.  Bass ranged in length from 6.2 to 18.2 inches with an average length and weight of 10.7 inches and 0.7 pound.  Largemouth bass attain an average length of 13.0 inches at four years of age.       Catch data from a spring trapnetting assessment indicated that black crappie are abundant in Swan Lake.  Crappies ranged in length from 8.1 to 12.9 inches with an average length and weight of 10.5 inches and 0.7 pound.  Seventy-six percent of the crappies were at least 9.0 inches in length.  Black crappie attain an average length of 10.6 inches at four years of age.     The bluegill test-net catch rate was lower than the recent series of lake surveys but was within the normal range for class 25 lakes.  The 1995 year class is strong and should provide good bluegill angling for several years.  Fifty-three percent of the bluegill were at least 7.0 inches in length.  Bluegill attain an average length of 6.5 inches at six years of age.       The walleye test-net catch rate was within the normal range for class 25 lakes.  The DNR stocks 371,000 walleye fry on a biennial basis and natural reproduction also contributes to the walleye population.  Walleye ranged in length from 7.8 to 27.4 inches with an average length and weight of 16.4 inches and 1.6 pounds.  Walleye exhibit good growth with an average length of 13.9 inches at three years of age.     Anglers can maintain the quality of fishing in Swan Lake by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large-size fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future. </p>",
