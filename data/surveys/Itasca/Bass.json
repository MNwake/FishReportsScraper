BLUEGILL ABUNDANCE, AS INDICATED BY THE GILL NET CATCH, IS MORE THAN 3 TIMES THE THIRD QUARTILE LEVELS IN THIS LAKE CLASSIFICATION.  A BLUEGILL PSD OF 27 WAS CALCULATED FROM THE 1982 NETTING WHILE THE 1990 NETTING CALCULATED TO A PSD OF 70, WITH A RSD-P (8)  OF 22 OR 22% OF THE POPULATION WAS OVER THE 8 BLUEGILL CAPTURED IN THE GILL NETS HAS BEEN 0.2 LBS. OR LESS BEFORE 1990 BUT HAS RISEN TO 0.4 LBS. IN THIS ASSESSMENT, WITH SLOW GROWTH RATES ESPECIALLY FOR YOUNG FISH.  PUMPKINSEED AND BLACK CRAPPIE WERE NOT CAPTURED IN ASSESSMENTS BEFORE 1982 AND MAY HAVE BEEN INTRODUCED BY LOCALS.  THE CRAPPIE POPULATION HAS NORMAL GROWTH RATES AND IS WITHIN NORMAL ABUNDANCE RANGES.  THE LARGEMOUTH BASS GILL NET CPUE OF 2.2 IS NOW ABOVE THE THIRD QUARTILE OF 1.8 FOR THIS LAKE CLASS WITH NEAR NORMAL GROWTH RATES.  YELLOW PERCH ABUNDANCE HAS DECLINED STEADILY FROM GILL NET CPUE OF 9.0 IN 1971, WHICH IS NEAR LAKE CLASS MEDIANS, TO CPUE OF 0.2 IN 1982, WHILE NET CATCHES IN 1990 WERE ABSENT OF ANY PERCH.  THE 1971 SURVEY REPORTED WALLEYE AS BEING INTRODUCED BY LOCALS ALTHOUGH WALLEYE FINGERLINGS HAD BEEN STOCKED IN 1953, 1960, AND 1963 BY THE DNR.  THE CPUE IN 1971 WAS 2.0/GILLNET WITH A LAKE CLASS MEDIAN OF 1.5/GILLNET, BUT ABUNDANCE DECLINED TO 1.5/GILL/NET IN 1976, 0.4/ GILLNET IN 1982 AND NO WALLEYE WERE CAPTURED IN THIS ASSESSMENT.  THIS LAKE HAS FAIR WALLEYE SPAWNING HABITAT WITH SCATTERED ROCK AREAS ALONG THE SHORELINE.  THE NORTHERN PIKE ABUNDANCE AND AVERAGE WEIGHT  HAS BEEN RELATIVELY CONSTANT OVER THE YEARS WITH NEAR NORMAL GROWTH RATES.</p>",
