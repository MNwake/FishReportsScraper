                "narrative": "<p>     Paul Lake is a 319-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located in north-central Otter Tail County approximately six miles west of Perham, MN.  Paul Lake is located within the Otter Tail River Watershed.  The immediate watershed is composed of hardwood forest interspersed with agricultural land and marshes.  The maximum depth is 81 feet; however, 34% of the lake is 15 feet or less in depth.  The secchi disk reading, a standard measure of water clarity, during the 2008 lake survey was 22.1 feet, indicating excellent water clarity.  Secchi disk readings have ranged from 16.0 to 23.0 feet in previous surveys.   <br> \n     Development is located around the entire lake with the exception of the north shoreline. There are approximately 70 homes and one resort located along the lakeshore. The shoreline length is 3.0 miles and shoal water substrates consist primarily of sand and gravel.  A DNR owned concrete public water access is located off of County Highway 34 along the north shoreline.  Water levels have risen significantly in recent years.  Because of this, shoreline erosion has become an increasing concern for lakeshore owners.  By using shoreline best management practices (BMP's) and  \"lakescaping\" concepts, impacts of development and shoreline erosion can be minimized.  Contact any County Extension <br> \nOffice for information on BMP's and the local DNR Fisheries Office for information on lakescaping techniques. <br> \n     Walleye is a primary management specie in Paul Lake.  The walleye test-net catch rate was lower than the previous two surveys, but within the normal range for this class of lake.  Walleye ranged in length from 11.9 to 29.7 inches with an average length and weight of 18.5 inches and 2.6 pounds.  Walleye attain an average length of 15.8 inches at four years of age. <br> \n     The northern pike test-net catch rate was comparable to recent surveys and within the normal range for this class of lake. Northern pike abundance increased when water levels rose in the 1990's, which allowed pike access to adjacent marshes for spawning.  Northern pike ranged in length from 12.5 to 33.9 inches with an average length and weight of 18.0 inches and 1.4 pounds.  Northern pike attain an average length of 21.6 inches at five years of age. <br> \n     Test-net catch data indicate that largemouth bass are abundant.  Age data suggest that reproduction is consistently good.  Largemouth bass ranged in length from 4.7 to 14.2 inches with an average length and weight of 11.3 inches and 0.8 pounds.  Largemouth bass attain an average length of 10.4 inches at four years of age. <br> \n     Bluegill abundance appears to have stabilized after considerable fluctuation in surveys prior to 2002.  Bluegill size structure is good with 21% of the sample measuring 7.0 inches or greater in length.  Bluegills attain an average length of 7.2 inches at seven years of age. <br> \n     Anglers can maintain the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large-size fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Paul Lake is a 319-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located in north-central Otter Tail County, approximately six miles west of Perham, MN.  Paul Lake is located within the Otter Tail River Watershed.  An unnavigable inlet is located along the southeast shoreline.  The immediate watershed is composed of hardwood forest interspersed with agricultural land and marshes.  The maximum depth is 81 feet and 34% of the lake is 15 feet or less in depth.  The secchi disk reading, a standard measure of water clarity, during the 2002 lake survey was 23.0 feet indicating excellent water clarity.  Secchi disk readings have ranged from 16.0 to 21.5 feet in previous surveys.  Paul Lake is included in lake class 23 of the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) lake classification scheme.      Development is located around the entire lake with the exception of the north shoreline.  There are approximately 70 homes and one resort located along the lakeshore.  The shoreline length is 3.0 miles and shoal water substrates consist primarily of sand and gravel.  A DNR owned concrete public water access is located off of County Highway 34 along the north shoreline.  Water levels have risen significantly in recent years.  Because of this, shoreline erosion has become an increasing concern for lakeshore owners.  By using shoreline best management practices (BMP's) and  \"lakescaping\" concepts, impacts of development and shoreline erosion can be minimized.  Contact any County ExtensionOffice for information on BMP's and the local DNR   Fisheries Office for information on lakescaping techniques.     Walleye is a primary management specie in Paul Lake.  The northern pike, largemouth bass and bluegill populations are also very abundant.  Yellow bullheads are extremely abundant, which, together with a high secchi disk reading is an indicator of very good water quality.      The walleye gill net catch rate was 5.2 per net, which slightly exceeds what would be expected for lakes in class 23.  Walleye catch rates have been stable over the series of surveys, ranging from 4.7 to 7.7 per net.  Walleye in the the gill net sample ranged in length from 10.8 to 26.5 inches with an average length and weight of 18.1 inches and 2.2 pounds.  Walleye fingerlings have been stocked on a triennial basis and age data indicate that limited natural reproduction is occurring.  The strongest year classes have consistently corresponded to years of walleye fingerling stocking.  Walleye attain an average length of 15.2 inches at four years of age.     The northern pike gill net catch rate was 8.7 per net, which is equivalent to the upper limit of the expected range for class 23 lakes.  Northern pike abundance has increased since water levels rose in the 1990's, which allowed access to adjacent marshes for spawning.  Pike ranged in length from 12.2 to 36.1 inches with an average length and weight of 18.0 inches and 1.3 pounds.     Test-net catch data indicate that largemouth bass are abundant and age data suggest that bass reproduction is consistently good.  Bass ranged in length from 5.2 to 15.4 inches.  Bass attain an average length of 11.5 inches at four years of age.     The bluegill trap net catch rate was within the expected range for class 23 lakes.  Bluegill abundance has fluctuated over the recent series of surveys.  Bluegill size structure is good with 31% of the sample 7.0 inches or greater in length.  Bluegill attain an average length of 6.9 inches at seven years of age.     Anglers can maintain the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large-size fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future.         </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>     Paul Lake is a 319-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located in north-central Otter Tail County approximately six miles west of Perham, MN.  Paul Lake is located within the Otter Tail River Watershed.  The immediate watershed is composed of hardwood forest interspersed with agricultural land and marshes.  The maximum depth is 81 feet; however, 34% of the lake is 15 feet or less in depth.  The secchi disk reading was 19.1 feet, indicating excellent water clarity.  Secchi disk readings have ranged from 16.0 to 23.0 feet in previous surveys.   <br> \n     Development is located around the entire lake with the exception of the north shoreline. There are approximately 70 homes and one resort located along the lakeshore. The shoreline length is 3.0 miles and shoal water substrates consist primarily of sand and gravel.  A DNR owned concrete public water access is located off of County Road 34 along the north shoreline.  Areas of emergent aquatic macrophytes are extremely limited. <br> \n     Walleye is primary management specie in Paul Lake.  Walleyes ranged in length from 8.3 to 24.8 inches with an average length and weight of 19.3 inches and 2.7 pounds.  Walleyes attain an average length of 14.8 inches at age four. <br> \n     Northern Pike ranged in length from 11.5 to 37.1 inches with an average length and weight of 19.7 inches and 1.8 pounds.  Northern Pike attain an average length of 23.2 inches at age five. <br> \n      Age data suggest that Largemouth Bass reproduction is consistently good.  Largemouth Bass ranged in length from 6.5 to 19.5 inches with an average length and weight of 11.6 inches and 1.0 pounds.  Largemouth Bass attain an average length of 11.5 inches at age five. <br> \n     Bluegill abundance appears to have stabilized after considerable fluctuation prior to 2002.  Bluegill size structure is good with 20% of the sample measuring 7.0 inches or greater in length.  Bluegills attain an average length of 7.0 inches at age six. <br> \n     Anglers can maintain the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large-size fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future.       <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>     Paul Lake is a 319-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located in north-central Otter Tail County approximately six miles west of Perham, MN.  Paul Lake is located within the Otter Tail River Watershed. The immediate watershed is composed of hardwood forest interspersed with agricultural land and marshes. The maximum depth is 81 feet; however, 34% of the lake is 15 feet or less in depth.  The secchi disk reading during the 2020 lake survey was 9.0 feet. Previous secchi disk readings have ranged from 16.0 to 23.0 feet in previous surveys.   <br> \n     Development is located around the entire lake with the exception of the north shoreline.  A DNR owned concrete public water access is located off of County Highway 34 along the north shoreline. Shoal water substrates consist primarily of sand and gravel. Emergent aquatic plants such as Hardstem Bulrush and Common Cattail are extremely rare in Paul Lake.  <br> \n     A special gillnetting survey was conducted to analyze the Walleye and Northern Pike populations. <br> \n     Walleye abundance has historically been stable and the Walleye numbers in the 2020 survey were the highest of all time. Walleyes ranged in length from 12.2 to 29.5 inches with an average length and weight of 21.2 inches and 3.9 pounds. Walleyes attain an average length of 15.2 inches at four years of age.   <br> \n     Northern Pike abundance has remained stable over the recent series of surveys. Age data indicate that Northern Pike reproduction is consistently good due to increased water levels, which has allowed pike access to adjacent marshes for spawning. Northern Pike ranged in length from 13.5 to 33.8 inches with an average length and weight of 20.9 inches and 2.4 pounds. Northern Pike attain an average length of 21.4 inches at four years of age. <br> \n     Anglers can maintain the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest. Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large size fish while allowing the harvest of the more abundant smaller fish for table fare. Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future.      <br> \n      Paul Lake was listed as infested with zebra mussels in 2013. Aquatic invasive species are threatening Minnesota waters. Aquatic invasive species can potentially harm water quality, water recreation, aquatic habitat, native species, and fish populations. Anglers can help prevent the introduction and spread of invasive species by following watercraft transportation laws.       <br> \n <br> \n</p>",
