Gillnet catches for goldeye, river carpsucker, quillback carpsucker, shorthead redhorse, channel catfish, smallmouth bass, and sauger were above local or state-wide median values.  Trapnet catches for shortnose gar, gizzard shad, river carpsucker, shorthead redhorse, white bass, smallmouth bass, and sauger were above local or state-wide median values.  Smallmouth bass had not been caught in either the 1986 population assessment or the 1981 lake survey netting.  Growth of northern pike, largemouth bass, and walleye was good.  Several year classes of walleye and sauger indicate adequate recruitment to those populations.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Spring Lake was once a fairly small, river-bottom lake which was supplied by many fine springs.  In 1930 at the completion of the Hastings Dam (#2) this lake was greatly expanded and became part of the back waters of the Mississippi River.  The lake though reported to be at least 20 feet deep in places is thought to be about 8 feet on the average.  The lake, though protected from the river's current by a band of low lying islands on the north, still is under the direct influence of the river as to levels controlled by Dam #2 and its water supply interchange.  It has been reported that game fish were very scarce previous to the establishment and operation of the St. Paul - Minneapolis disposal plant in 1938.  Almost immediately after the establishment the appearance of these desirable types was noted and a sport fishery was started.  It is reported that the peak fishing was experienced in 1940 and 1941.  Since then it has declined to approximately its present level.  The sport fishery does supply some northern pike, walleye - sauger and black crappie fishing with few other fish caught also.  Bluegills and largemouth bass are present.  The test netting that was carried on indicates that the desirable fishing species in Spring Lake are at a low level.</p>",

Riverine species such as carp, freshwater drum, mooneye, goldeye, and various redhorse species are abundant. Channel catfish were the most abundant gamefish sampled for the third straight survey. Individuals up to 26 inches were sampled. Sauger and walleye are present, but in below average numbers for this type of lake. Northern pike are also present, but in very low numbers. Bluegills and black crappies were caught in average abundance. Anglers should be aware of consumption advisories for Pool 2 of the Mississsippi River, which includes Spring Lake. PCBs and mercury have been detected in various species. Spring Lake is also included in the special regulation for Pool 2 that requires catch and release fishing for walleye, sauger, smallmouth bass, and largemouth bass, but allows year around fishing.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Spring Lake is a natural backwater lake of the Mississippi River in Pool 2.  Islands direct much of the main channel flow of water away from Spring Lake during low flow periods.  Spring Lake has been changed in original character by the construction of Lock and Dam No. 2 at Hastings.  Precise measurements of this change cannot be documented due to lack of preconstruction data.River trapnet catch data for Spring Lake was compared to similar data from 1964 and also to catches made in Sturgeon and North Lakes, similar downstream backwater lakes, in 1977.  This comparison indicates that Spring Lake is not greatly different in fish population structure than previously found or in the other lakes.  This data indicates a heavy dominance by large roughfish, particularly carp.  Gillnets and lake survey trapnets also indicate this.Although dominated by large roughfish, Spring Lake has rather substantial populations of several gamefish: black/white crappie, white bass, bluegill, walleye, sauger, and channel catfish.  The sauger population indicates good natural reproduction has occurred regularly in the recent past.  Compared to statewide data growth rates were indicated as being fast for all ages I through V annulus.  The walleye population has also indicated relatively good natural reproduction with fast growth at I and II annulus but only average after that.  The 1976 year-class was the most common, followed by the 1979 fish.  White crappie populations seem to be characterized by an occasional strong year-class (in this case 1977) with weaker ones more common.  Black crappie populations appear more stable.  I and II annulus fish exhibited fast growth and older fish average rates.  Northern pike catches were dominated by a very strong 1978 year-class which out-numbered all other age classes combined.  Channel catfish length distributions indicate a wide variety of sizes, indicating that regular reproduction occurs.  The same appears true for white bass.</p>",
