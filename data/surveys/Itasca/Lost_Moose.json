A winterkill of Lost Moose was reported in May of 2023.  The event was investigated using boat electrofishing on May 12th.  A few dead Largemouth Bass, Northern Pike and one potential crappie were observed.  Live Northern Pike (12-20 inches), Yellow Perch, and Pumpkinseed were observed in shallow water indicating that a complete kill had not occurred and sufficient brood fish were present to naturally repopulate the lake.  Masses of perch egggs were observed. The species that survived the winterkill are tolerant of lower winter oxygen and appropriate for the lake.  Given the fact that live fish were observed, brood fish stocking is not needed.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lost Moose Lake is located about 15 miles east southeast of Marcell, MN, within the Chippewa National Forest and the Mississippi River Watershed.  Most of the 2.8 mile shoreline is in public ownership and development is mostly along the west and northwest side of the lake.  The 101 acre lake is 100% littoral with a 16 foot maximum depth and is in Lake Class 37.  There is a state owned access on the west shore with limited parking availability. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike were the most abundant species present in the gill nets and comparable to the previous assessment.  Both exceeded the expected range for lakes similar to Lost Moose.  Size structure was moderate but improvement would be desirable.  Lengths ranged from 9.1 to 32.7 inches in the gill net sample with an average of 19.2 inches.  Trap nets sampled one 36 inch pike, suggesting some big fish potential exists.  Scale and bone analysis identified ages 1 through 8 were present in the sample suggesting relatively consistent recruitment.  Back-calculated length-at-age determined growth was similar to the statewide average.  Northern pike typically averaged 20.4 inches by age 4. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie were sampled at a rate exceeding the expected range in gill nets, while the trap net catch was within the expected range.  Interestingly, no crappie were sampled in the previous assessment, but were present in the initial 1978 survey.  Gill net size structure was moderate while trap net sampled fish had slightly better distribution of size.  Lengths ranged from 4.9 to 10.3 inches with an average length of 8.1 inches in the gill nets, while fish up to 12.8 inches were observed in trap nets.  Scale analysis identified four age classes with fish up to age 8 present.  The 2006 year class comprised 63% of the sample, while 2007 and 2008 year classes were not sampled.  Growth was slow early but near the statewide average by age 3.  Black crappie typically exceeded 10 inches by age 6. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill were sampled at the low end of the expected range in trap nets, which is up slightly from the previous assessment.  Size structure was poor with no fish over eight inches sampled.  Lengths ranged from 3.5 to 7.7 inches with an average length of 6.3 inches.  Scale analysis identified ages 2 and 5-7 present in the sample.  Similar to black crappie, the 2007 and 2008 year-classes were not present in the bluegill sample.  Growth was slow early but near the statewide average by age 4. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch were listed as primary management species and were sampled at a rate below the expected range and below the previous assessment.  Sample size was too small to accurately reflect the population, but fish up to 10.4 inches were sampled. <br> \n <br> \nPumpkinseed were the most abundant species sampled in trap nets and the second most abundant in gill nets.  Other species sampled included hybrid sunfish and largemouth bass.  As part of IBI (Index of Biotic Integrity) near shore sampling, Johnny darter, black crappie, blacknose shiner, bluegill, central mudminnow, largemouth bass, northern pike, pumpkinseed and yellow perch were sampled in nine seine hauls.  Backpack electrofishing sampled bluegill, central mudminnow, largemouth bass, northern pike, and yellow perch in 10 stations. <br> \n</p>",
