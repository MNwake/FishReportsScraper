White sucker and one golden shiner were sampled in the gill nets. Four additional fish species were sampled in the minnow traps. <br> \n <br> \nWhite sucker numbers in 2014 (6.0/gill net) were below average when compared to other area lakes in this class. Sucker sizes averaged 12.8 inches and the largest sucker was 14.3 inches long. <br> \n <br> \nFathead minnows were the most abundant fish sampled in the minnow traps. Finescale dace and northern redbelly dace were sampled in similar relative abundances. Dace are often referred to as \"rainbow chubs\" in the bait industry. Golden shiners and 1 brook stickleback were also sampled. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",
