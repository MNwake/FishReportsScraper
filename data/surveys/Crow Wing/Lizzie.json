Average populations of bowfin, black, yellow and brown bullheads, pumpkinseeds, black crappies and walleyes. Catch rates were compared with lake group 5 medians for the Brainerd area. Northern pike sampled indicated excellent growth rates for this area. Age classes two thru six were represented with two and three year old fish comprising 69% of the sample. Length frequencies ranged from 14 to 30 inches. Individual weights averaged nearly 3 pounds apiece. Bluegills were aged from 2 to 7 years old, and all showed average growth rates. Four year old fish comprised nearly 50% of the sample. Individual lengths ranged from 3-9 inches. Black crappies indicated an average catch rate with most small size fish. Lengths ranged from 5 to 11 inches with 50% in the 5 inch length group. Growth rates were average for all age groups. Yellow perch were abundant when compared to catch rates of similar lakes in the area. Ages 2-7 were sampled and all indicated slow growth rates. Individual lengths ranged from 5 to 9 inches. Five and 6 inch fish comprised 95% of the sample. Walleyes were present in average numbers with length frequencies from 20-25%. Growth rates were not determined. Black bullheads were very abundant in the gill net catches but very few were taken in the trapnets. Individual lengths ranged from 5 to 10 1/2 inches. Seventy-eight percent of the sample were between 8 and 10 inches. Yellow and brown bullheads were also present in average numbers when compared to medians of similar lakes in the Brainerd area. Pumpkinseed sunfish were present in average numbers. Lengths of individual fish ranged from 3 to 7 inches.</p>",
