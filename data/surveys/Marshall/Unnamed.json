Most angling is based from the fishing pier that is located in the park, or from shore by the dam.  There is a boat access on the reservoir.  Gas-powered outboard motor use is not allowed, but boaters may use oars or electric motors. <br> \n <br> \nCatchable-sized sunfish are stocked annually in early June.  The bluegill population consists mainly of fish that are seven inches or longer.  Northern pike are commonly caught by anglers, and fish up to 30 inches long were sampled in 2006.  Largemouth bass abundance is presently low. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Florian Reservoir, in Marshall County, is a 50-acre reservoir located approximately 1.5 miles southwest of the city of Florian in northwestern Minnesota. Florian Reservoir is part of the Tamarac River watershed, and was constructed in 1975 by damming the Tamarac River near Florian. Florian Reservoir is located within Marshall County Park and is the only fishing lake in Marshall County. <br> \n  <br> \nMost angling is based from a handicapped-accessible fishing pier located in the County Park, or from shore by the dam. There is a boat ramp on the river within the County Park.  Gas-powered outboard motor use is not allowed, but boaters may use oars or electric motors. <br> \n <br> \nFlorian Reservoir is prone to fish kills during winter.  Several styles of aeration systems have been used to prevent winterkill, but none have been successful. <br> \n   <br> \nA fisheries survey conducted in 2017 documented the presence of Black Bullhead, Bluegill, Northern Pike, Pumpkinseed, Rock Bass, and White Sucker.  Bluegill and Northern Pike are the two fish species most commonly targeted by anglers fishing at Florian Reservoir. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike are more tolerant of low dissolved oxygen concentrations than most other game fishes, so they continue to be available for anglers each year.   Most Northern Pike are less than 25 inches long, but there have been fish up to 15 pounds sampled in the reservoir. <br> \n <br> \nCatchable-sized Sunfish are stocked in June each year.  Most of the stocked fish are longer than 6 inches. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>\tFlorian Reservoir, in Marshall County, is a 50-acre reservoir located approximately 1.5 miles southwest of the city of Florian in northwestern Minnesota. Florian Reservoir is part of the Tamarac River watershed, and was constructed in 1975 by damming the Tamarac River near Florian. Florian Reservoir is located within Marshall County Park and is the only fishing lake in Marshall County. A fisheries survey conducted in 2014 documented the presence of Black Bullhead, Northern Pike, Pumpkinseed, Rock Bass, and White Sucker. <br> \n <br> \n\tNorthern Pike trap net catch rates in 2014 was 1.3 fish/net and just below the 20-year average of 1.45 fish/net. The average Northern Pike length was 18 inches, with fish ranging from 14 to 34 inches. Ageing analyses revealed most pike were age-0 to age-3 indicating either the population is self-sustaining or is replenished from upstream migrants.  <br> \n <br> \n\tPanfish catch rates in 2014 were low. Pumpkinseed catch rates were 1.3 fish/net and fall below the 20-year average of ~2 fish/net. Average length of Pumpkinseed was 3.5 inches and fish ranging from 3 to 4 inches. Five Rock Bass were sampled that ranged from 5.5 inches to 7.5 inches in length with an average length of 6.2 inches.  To supplement low panfish numbers, stocking will be done in the spring of 2015. <br> \n <br> \n\tBlack Bullhead catch rates were 9.3 fish/net and is well below the 20-year average of 65 fish/net. Black Bullhead length ranged from 4.7 inches to 9.5 inches, with an average length of 6.3 inches in length. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Florian Reservoir located mostly in a county park was created in 1975, and is a small shallow reservoir that is aerated to avoid winter kills.  A diffuser aeration system was installed in 1999, which is a big improvement over the previous pump and baffle system that was used.  It is managed primarily for bluegill and largemouth bass, with fishable populations of northern pike and black crappie.  Adult bluegill are stocked every year at a rate of 80 pounds per acre (400 pounds total).  They were not stocked in 2000 due to budget cuts, so the population was lower in 2001.  The bluegill stocking program will continue.  High populations of bullheads that prey on young-of-year bluegill and other species are making it hard for other them to reproduce successfully.  Most fishing pressure is from the MN DNR fishing pier, or from shore by the dam.  There is also a public access located in the park.</p>",

Florian Reservoir is part of the Tamarac River watershed, and was constructed in 1975 by damming the Tamarac River. Florian Reservoir, the only fishing lake in Marshall County, is located within Marshall County Park. Most angling is occurs at the handicapped-accessible fishing pier located in the county park, or from shore by the dam. There is a boat ramp on the river within the County Park.  Gas-powered outboard motor use is not allowed, but boaters may use oars or electric motors. Florian Reservoir is prone to fish kills during winter.  Several styles of aeration systems have been used to prevent winterkill, but none have been successful. <br> \n A fisheries survey conducted in 2022 documented the presence of Black Bullhead, Black Crappie, Bluegill, Northern Pike, Pumpkinseed, Rock Bass, White Sucker, and various small non-game species.  Northern Pike and panfish provide the primary angling opportunity in Florian Reservoir.  In 2022, two Northern Pike were sampled with the larger being 25.5 inches. Catchable-sized Sunfish are stocked in June each year.  A good number of Bluegills were sample in 2022 with fish exceeding nine inches occurring. Additionally, low densities of Black Crappie up to 11 inches, Pumpkinseed up to 6.5 inches, and Rock Bass up to 6 inches were present.  <br> \n</p>",

The reservoir is accessible through Florian County Park, which is administered by Marshall County.   An aeration system is operated on the lake in the winter.  This system creates open water, so extreme caution is advised. <br> \n <br> \nMost angling is based from a fishing pier within park, or from shore.  There is a boat access on the north side of the reservoir, located within the county park.  Gas-powered outboard motor use is not allowed, but boaters may use oars or electric motors. <br> \n <br> \nCatchable-sized sunfish are stocked annually in early June.  The bluegill population consists mostly of fish that are seven inches or longer.  Northern pike are commonly caught by anglers.  Largemouth bass abundance is presently low. <br> \n</p>",
