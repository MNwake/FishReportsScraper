                "narrative": "<p>Carey Lake is managed primarily for walleye and panfish.  Good populations of northern pike also live in the lake.  Walleye fingerlings were stocked in 1990, 1993, and 1995.     The walleye gill net catch rate (2.0/set) was within the expected range for this type of lake, and similar to previous catch rates on Carey Lake.  The mean length was 16.1 inches, ranging in length from 10.6 to 24.0 inches.  The mean weight was 1.4 pounds.  Most of the walleye sampled were from stocked years, indicating poor natural reproduction.  Growth rates for walleye exceeded the statewide mean for ages 1-3.     Black crappie sampled in gill nets had a catch rate (6.2/set) that exceeded the expected range.  The mean length of gill net sampled crappie was 6.7 inches, ranging in length from 5.3 to 9.0 inches.  Trap nets also sampled crappie at a catch rate (12.1/set) that exceeded the expected range.  The mean length of trap net sampled crappie was 6.9 inches, ranging from 3.8 to 10.8 inches.  Growth rates for all sampled crappie were below the statewide mean.     The northern pike gill net catch rate (4.2/set) was within the expected range and exceeded historical catch rates.  The mean length of sampled northern pike was 23.9 inches, with a maximum length of 40.3 inches.  The mean weight was 3.9 pounds.  Growth rates exceeded (>115%) the statewide mean for ages 1-4.     Bluegill were sampled in trap nets at a catch rate (10.9/set) that exceeded the expected range.  The mean length was  6.4 inches, ranging from 4.0 to 8.4 inches.     White sucker were sampled in gill nets at a catch rate (12.8/set) that exceeded the expected range.  The high abundance of white sucker may explain the fast northern pike growth rates as white sucker is an important prey species for northern pike.     Other species sampled in test nets include:  common and golden shiner, pumpkinseed sunfish, yellow bullhead, and yellow perch.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Carey Lake, also known as DuPont Lake, is located about five miles east of Hibbing, MN and within the St. Louis River Watershed.  The small lake is 139 acres (100% littoral) with a maximum depth of 13.5 feet and 2 miles of shoreline.  All of the shoreline is within the 1,100 acre Carey Lake Park and Recreational Area, controlled by the City of Hibbing.  There is a small boat access on the east side with limited parking availability.  There is a <10 hp outboard restriction on the lake and seaplane base on the southwest side.  There is one seasonal outlet (Carey Creek) to Dempsey creek.  Walleye fingerlings have been stocked five times at a rate of 1 pound/littoral acre (139 pounds) since 2003. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike were the most numerous fish sampled in gill nets, at a rate of 16.0/net, almost double the expected range (3.0-8.3/net) for lakes similar to Carey.  The catch represents a historic high, surpassing the previous high of 4.0/net in 1977.  Size structure appeared favorable with lengths from 16.6 to 37.2 inches and an average of 21.5 inches.  Scale and bone analysis identified ages 2-10 present indicating consistent recruitment.  Averaged back-calculated growth was similar to the statewide average with fish averaging 23.9 inches by age 5.  Neascus (black spot) was observed on 6 of 43 externally examined fish. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye were sampled at a rate of 2.2/gill net, within the expected range and the previous assessment (2.0/net, 1997).  Lengths were typically from 14 to 20 inches with one 7.4 inch fish sampled.  Scale and bone analysis identified three ages of fish, corresponding to the stocked years of 2011, 2007, and 2005.  Average growth was slow, below the statewide average.  Walleye averaged 16.2 inches by age 6 in Carey Lake. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie were sampled at a rate of 13.5/gill net, exceeding the expected range (0.5-5.5/net) and the previous assessment (6.2/net).  Crappie were also sampled at a rate of 1.3/trap net, within the expected range, yet down from the previous assessment (12.1/net).  Size structure was moderate in the gill net sample and also being comparable to the trap net sample and the previous assessment.  Lengths ranged from 4.2 to 9.7 inches with an average length of 6.5 inches.  Scale analysis identified ages 1-8 in the sample indicating consistent recruitment.  The 2010 year class was dominant, comprising 33% of the aged sample, while the other year classes were fairly consistent.  Average back-calculated growth was determined to be slow, below the statewide average for all ages.  Black crappie averaged nine inches by age 8. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill were sampled at a rate of 2.7/trap net, near the low end of the expected range and down from the previous assessment (10.9/net).  Size structure was poor as lengths ranged from 3 to 7.4 inches with an average of 5 inches. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled included brown bullhead, hybrid sunfish, pumpkinseed sunfish, white sucker, yellow bullhead, and yellow perch. <br> \n <br> \nAs part of IBI (Index of Biotic Integrity) near shore sampling, Jonny darter, bluegill, hybrid sunfish, largemouth bass, and yellow perch were sampled in one seine hauls.  Backpack electrofishing sampled Iowa darter, Jonny darter, black bullhead, bluegill, brown bullhead, central mudminnow, fathead minnow, hybrid sunfish, largemouth bass, pumpkinseed sunfish, spottail shiner, and yellow perch in 10 stations. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Carey Lake is located within the Carey Lake Park and Recreation Area in Hibbing, Minnesota.  The public access is located on the west side and there is a 10 hp outboard motor restriction on the lake.  The lake has brown water due to tannins.  The 2013 lake management plan (LMP) indicates Black Crappie, Northern Pike, and Walleye were the primary species of management with Bluegill as a secondary species.  The LMP goals include maintaining the Black Crappie trap-net catch rate at 5.0/net, a Northern Pike gill-net catch rate near 4.0/net, and a Walleye fishery represented by a catch of 2.0/gill net.  Only gill-nets were used to evaluate Walleye stocking in August of 2017. <br> \n <br> \nThe Black Crappie gill-net catch of 5.3 fish/net was high compared to other lakes with similar habitat.  The sampled fish ranged from 5.8 to 11.1 inches and averaged 7.8 inches.  Five age-classes were estimated from scales with fish from age 2 to 7 represented.  Growth was slower than other lakes with similar habitat.  The fish only averaged 8.6 inches after five years of growth.  Black Crappie may provide good fishing at times but the larger fish anglers seek are most likely harvested quickly since the lake is small. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike gill-net catch rates have ranged from 1.4 to 16.0 fish/net since 1971.  The Northern Pike catches in the last two surveys have been the only two distinctly higher than normal for the lake and for other lakes with similar habitat.  The catch of 13.7 fish/net in 2017 was the second highest on record and did not meet the LMP goal.  The goal of 4.0 fish/net reflects a population characterized by moderate density, good growth, and a diverse size structure.  High numbers of Northern Pike generally lead to the opposite population characteristics and can negatively affect the prey base.  The sample fish ranged from 13.9 to 30.4 inches and averaged 19.3 inches.  Seven age-classes were identified with fish from age 1 to 7 represented.  Growth was similar to statewide averages for all ages.  Northern Pike averaged 20.9 inches after four years of growth.  Good action may be found for Northern Pike anglers but large fish are unlikely to be encountered. <br> \n <br> \nCarey Lake does not have the habitat to be a destination fishery for Walleye so management has attempted to provide a bonus fishery.  Walleye have been stocked every other year since 2003.  Net catches have historically been low and were again in 2017.  The catch of 0.7 fish/net was low compared to other lakes with similar habitat and did not meet the LMP goal of 2.0/net.  Three of the Walleye were from the 2015 stocking and averaged 14.6 inches at capture.  The small size of the lake, lake productivity, and low Yellow Perch likely limits Walleye numbers. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch catches have ranged from 0.5 to 7.3 fish/gill net since 1971.  The 2017 catch was the lowest on record at 0.5 fish/gill net.  The two lowest catches have occurred in the last two surveys.  The sampled Yellow Perch ranged from 6.1 to 6.7 inches.  The Yellow Perch are not likely providing fishing opportunities or prey for predators due to their poor size structure and low numbers. <br> \n <br> \nOther species observed during the survey included Golden Shiner, Pumpkinseed Sunfish, White Sucker, and Yellow Bullhead. <br> \n</p>",
