                "narrative": "<p>Fleming Lake is a shallow, very fertile lake located in central Aitkin County five and one-half miles south of Palisade.  The lake has been a popular destination for many anglers in search of northern pike, bluegill and black crappie.  The northern pike are not overly abundant but they have plenty of food and are of nice size.  The average northern pike sampled during the survey was over 25 inches long and weighed about five pounds.  The largest pike observed in this survey was almost 37 inches long and weighed approximately about 12 pounds.  Fleming Lake has a reputation for producing some big bluegill on occasion.  While the average bluegill sampled in this population assessment is relatively young, there are some older, larger fish in the population.  Black crappie have never been large in Fleming Lake but acceptable size fish are abundant.  This species does well in shallow, fertile lakes with a history of occasional winterkill and Fleming Lake is not an exception.  Both summer and winter anglers should find these abundant fish easy to catch.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Fleming Lake is a shallow, very fertile lake located in central Aitkin County, five and one-half miles south of Palisade. Fleming Lake has a history of occasional partial winterkills, although there are no recent reports of such an event. The lake is a popular destination for many anglers in search of northern pike, bluegill and black crappie. The primary management species for Fleming Lake are northern pike, black crappie and bluegill. Yellow perch are considered a secondary management species and offer a great forage base for the lake's healthy northern pike population.  Largemouth bass are also present in the lake and spring electrofishing was conducted for the first time in 2017, to gauge their abundance. A variety of fisheries management surveys have taken place on the lake dating back to 1950. Currently the lake is not stocked and is surveyed on a ten year rotation.  <br> \n <br> \nAt 1.5/gill net lift northern pike were not overly abundant in this survey and showed a decrease from 2008, but they do have plenty of yellow perch as forage and have maintained a nice size structure.  The average size for pike was 26.7 inches and individuals up to 32 inches were sampled.  <br> \n <br> \nBluegill abundance has decreased from the previous survey, but were still within the normal range for this lake type at 20.6/trap net. The size structure of bluegill was favorable with a mean length of 6.5 inches and fish close to 9 inches being sampled.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch are well above average in abundance for this class of lake.  Maintaining a good yellow perch population is important for the health of this fishery. Yellow perch provide an excellent forage base for the northern pike and are likely a big reason for the favorable northern pike size structure.  Healthy perch populations are also known to positively affect other species such as bluegill, which also have respectable size structure in Fleming Lake. It's thought that yellow perch play a role in the dynamics of bluegill sunfish by reducing the densities of young of year bluegills so they do not become stunted. <br> \n <br> \nFleming Lake is a \"numbers\" lake when it comes to black crappie and based on our records, they have never been large sized. The largest sampled this year was 9.6 inches in gill nets, but acceptable size fish, over 8 inches, are quite abundant. In the trap nets there were 6 measured larger than 10 inches with the largest being 10.3 inches. This species does well in shallow, fertile lakes.  <br> \n <br> \nWith the advent of curly-leaf pond weed in Fleming Lake, there may be changes to the water quality and fish community in the not-so-distant future.  It is exceedingly important that lake users and shoreland owners use good practices to prevent the spread to other waters and to prevent other invasive species from becoming established in Fleming Lake.   <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Fleming Lake is a shallow, very fertile lake located in central Aitkin County, five and one-half miles south of Palisade.  Fleming Lake has a history of occasional partial winterkills, although there are no recent reports of such an event.  The lake is a popular destination for many anglers in search of northern pike, bluegill and black crappie.   <br> \n <br> \nThe northern pike are not overly abundant, but they have plenty of food and are of nice size; 76% were over 24 inches.  The average size of northern pike sampled during the survey was over 27 inches long and weighed five pounds.  Although their abundance has increased steadily since we first surveyed the lake in 1978, growth rates do not appear to have been affected. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill have been increasing in recent years and are very abundant. Although growth rates are above average for Aitkin County, they do appear to be decreasing somewhat in comparison with previous assessments.  Fishing pressure may also be a limiting factor in the size structure of the bluegill population.  The number of fish over the angler preferred size (7.5 inches) is very low, although the strong 2002 year class may soon reach that mark. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie have never been large sized in Fleming Lake.  The largest caught this year was 10 inches, but acceptable size fish, over 8 inches, are quite abundant.  This species does well in shallow, fertile lakes with a history of occasional partial winterkills.  Both summer and winter anglers should find these very abundant fish easy to catch. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch are well above average in abundance for this class of lake, which is likely why growth rates for northern pike are so fast.  They may also play a role in the dynamics of bluegill sunfish by reducing the densities of young of year bluegills, thereby increasing first year growth rates.  Maintaining a good yellow perch population is important for the health of this fishery. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Significant changes have occurred in the fish community of Fleming Lake since the last population assessment in 1993.  The black crappie population has exploded to a historically high level of 102 per gill net lift.  There are several very strong year-classes, 1994-1997, which are still small, but should provide some good crappie fishing in the coming years.  The average size of black crappie caught in the gill nets was only 5.3 inches.  Growth was normal relative to black crappie growth elsewhere in the state.  There are still some good sized northern pike with the largest caught over 30 inches.  The mean size of northern pike in the gill net sample was 23.7 inches.  Growth was normal, but appears to have slowed from rates observed in 1993.  One possible reason is that the forage base of golden shiner and yellow perch became less abundant, while the northern abundance remained stable.  The abundance of bluegill declined markedly since the 1993 assessment, but was still in the normal range for this type of lake.  Bluegill averaged 5.8 inches with around 60% six inches or greater in length. Fleming Lake is shallow and productive, a prime candidate for winterkill.  Despite reports from the public of past winterkills, recent winter oxygen testing found that oxygen levels were adequate.  Chlorophyll A and total phosphorus levels were above normal bounds for this area, indicating a water quality problem.  Continued development around the lake and leakage from non-conforming septic systems could result in a buildup of plant nutrients, which leads to algae blooms, increased plant growth, and fish kills.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>This population assessment revealed something that even many lakeshore owners on Fleming Lake didn'tknow; there is a fair number of large northern pike in the lake. Most (77%) of the northern pike in thegill nets were longer than 24.0 inches. And young northern pike grow quickly; the average four year oldfish is already 28 inches long. Yellow perch, golden shiners and black crappies are all more abundantthan normal and are an exceptional food source for the northerns. Abundant prey for northern pike,coupled with low numbers of northern pike, however, has resulted in low northern pike angling success.There are large black crappies from the 1988 year class and small crappies from the 1991 year class,but not much in between. Overall, the crappies are relatively abundant. Anglers reported that winterfishing for large crappies can be quite good. The angling success for crappies fluctuates, as expected,as the year class strength fluctuates. The bluegill population is healthy, and has produced a fairnumber (21%) of 8 inch or longer fish. The bullhead populations are below average and most of thebullheads are large, in the 11 to 13 inch range.Fleming Lake is shallow and productive, a prime candidate for winterkill. Despite reports from thepublic of past winterkills, recent winter oxygen testing has found that oxygen levels have beenadequate. Continued development around the lake and leakage from non-conforming septic systems couldresult in a buildup of plant nutrients, which leads to algae blooms, increased plant growth, and fishkills.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of the nearshore fish community on Fleming Lake was conducted on June 20, 2017. Sampling stations were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at all ten stations with two sites sampled from the boat. A 50-foot seine was used to sample one station, a 15-foot seine was used at six stations, and soft sediments with abundant emergent vegetation in deep water prevented the use of seines at three sampling sites. Nearshore sampling captured 10 different native species of fish. <br> \n <br> \nData from this targeted nearshore survey was combined with data from a standard gill and trap netting survey in August 2017 to calculate a Fish-based Index of Biologic Integrity (FIBI) score that describes the overall health of the lake. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment.  The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. The FIBI score for Fleming Lake based on this survey was above the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes.  Data from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Mississippi River-Brainerd Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.   For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website. <br> \n</p>",

The trap net index for black crappies is above their third regional quartile. Northern pike ranged from two to eight plus years of age with a strong year class in 1983. The growth rate for the sixth growth increment was eighty-five percent faster than normal. The growth rate for the eighth growth increment was forty- three percent slower than normal. All other growth increments had normal growth rates. Bluegill ranged from two to eight plus years of age with strong year classes in 1982, 1983 and 1986. All growth increments indicated slow growth rates. Largemouth bass ranged from two to three years of age. Although the sample was small, all growth increments showed normal growth. Black crappie ranged from two to six years of age with strong year classes in 1983, 1984 and 1986. The 1983 year class looks especially strong considering the fact that it's five years old. The growth rate for the sixth growth increment was fifty percent slower than normal. Growth rates for all other growth increments were normal. Yellow perch ranged from two to seven years of age with strong year classes in 1983, 1984 and 1985. The seventh growth increment was twenty-nine percent slower than normal. All other growth increments showed normal growth rates.</p>",
