                "narrative": "<p>Kawishiwi Lake, sometimes considered the source of the Kawishiwi River, is a 400 acre lake. The maximum depth is 12 feet. The lake lies partially within the roadless and airspace reservation zones of the boundary waters canoe area, and serves as a starting point for some canoe trips. A well-developed National Forest Service access, boat loading area, and campground are present at the lake.     At the time of the survey, water levels were about 1.5 feet low for that time of the year. Water levels appeared to have been 3 feet higher at some time in the past. The shoal water soils were mostly mixtures of gravel, sand, boulder and muck. Vegetation was lightly scattered in shallow areas less than four feet in depth.     White Sucker, Northern Pike, Walleye, Yellow Perch and Rock Bass were the species taken in test netting with gillnets and trapnets. Walleye and White Sucker were taken in numbers greater than state-wide gillnet averages, but less than Kawishiwi watershed averages. Northern Pike and Yellow Perch were taken in numbers equal to the state-wide averages, but lower than the watershed averages for Northern Pike, and higher than the Yellow Perch watershed average. Most Walleye were below 15 inches in length, which is considered a minimum keeping size by many anglers. Northern Pike were also smaller than most anglers desire. Rock Bass were taken in small numbers. Various minnows and young-of-the-year Yellow Perch, Rock Bass and Walleye were taken in shoreline seining.     Spawning conditions were rated \"fair\" for Northern Pike, \"fair to good\" for Walleye, and \"poor\" for centrarchids. There are several inlets and an outlet to the lake, and limited amounts of marsh area available to Northern Pike spawning. Shoal areas of gravel/rubble are present in the lake, and appear to be suitable for Walleye spawning.     Very little information on fishing was obtained, but poor fishing and small Walleye sizes seem to have been characteristic of this lake for recent years.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A fish population assessment was conducted on Kawishiwi Lake in September 2003.  Species sampled during this assessment were: walleye, northern pike, yellow perch, rock bass, white sucker, bluntnose minnow and Johnny darters.Walleye were sampled in average numbers, which is typical for this lake.  The fish averaged 1.1 pounds (14.9 inches) and ranged from 7.4 inches to 20.7 inches (3.1 pounds).  Approximately 43% of the walleye were between 15.0 inches and 17.9 inches.  Kawishiwi Lake is stocked with walleye fingerlings in a two-of-four-year rotation, and it appeared that stocking and natural reproduction contributed to the 2003 catch.In past assessments on Kawishiwi Lake northern pike have consistently been sampled in average numbers with the size being below average.  This was the case again in the 2003 assessment where average numbers of northern pike were sampled, but the average weight was only 1.2 pounds.  The largest northern pike collected in this assessment was only 2.7 pounds (23.9 inches).Yellow perch were present in average numbers, including some larger size fish.  The sample included fish from 5.4 inches to 11.9 inches.  Approximately 33% of the yellow perch collected were larger than 9.0 inches.Kawishiwi Lake is a popular entry point into the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness, where outboard motors are not permitted.  Vehicle traffic is permitted to the shore of the lake, but motor use is not permitted on the lake.  There is a drive-to-campground, with 4 sites, on the lake.  These sites have a picnic table, fire grate and vault toilet.  There is no potable water available at the campground.  Six remote campsites are also scattered around the lake.</p>",

Test nets in 1996 found walleye abundance continues to be about average compared to similar lakes in this Lake Class (12). Walleye ranged in size from 8.2 inches to 20.3 inches (2.7 pounds) and averaged 14.7 inches (1.1 pound).     Northern pike were sampled in average numbers compared to similar lakes in this Lake Class (12). Northern pike from 8.2 inches to 27.7 inches (5.2 pounds) were sampled with the average size rather small averaging about 18 inches (1.0 pound).     Yellow perch are present in average numbers however their size is above average. Yellow perch collected ranged in size from 5.1 inches to 11.9 inches with nearly 75% of the fish between 9 inches and 11.5 inches.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Kawishiwi Lake is a 400 acre body of water located approximately 19 miles northeast of Isabella.  Although on the very edge, Kawishiwi Lake is completely within the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness (BWCAW).  The access is a gravel ramp to the water's edge, from the north end of USFS Rd. #354, watercraft and equipment must be carried into the lake as the water delineates the BWCAW boundary.  Kawishiwi Lake is a major entry point into the BWCAW; the access area also has a large parking lot (20+ vehicles) and a 5 site campground.  There are 6 remote campsites around Kawishiwi Lake.   A self registration box and day-use permits are located at the access for day-trips and off-season camping.  From May 1 through September 30 a quota system is in place for overnight camping in the BWCAW, requiring a reservation (fee) for travel from each entry point.   All BWCAW regulations apply to Kawishiwi Lake; state-wide fishing regulations for inland waters apply to Kawishiwi Lake. <br> \n  <br> \nThe fish sample in 2010 consisted of northern pike, rock bass, walleye, white sucker and yellow perch.  Walleye were sampled in average numbers for northeastern Minnesota lakes with similar characteristics.  The size of walleye sampled was above average at slightly less than 1.6 pounds (16.2 inches); the largest walleye was 21.5 inches.  Fifty-six percent of the total walleye catch in standard sampling gear was greater than 15 inches.  Walleye numbers were about average for Kawishiwi Lake with  the size above average, compared to catches in previous investigations, however,  Walleye growth was slow when compared to walleyes sampled in other Finland area lakes. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike were sampled in above average numbers for the lake class.  The northern pike average size was 1.1 pounds (17.1inches); the largest northern pike was 23.4 inches.  Historically, the northern pike catch has been average numbers of small fish.  Northern pike growth was slow at all ages sampled, compared to northern pike sampled in other Finland area assessments. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch were sampled in average numbers for the lake class in the 2010 population assessment; although, the numbers were lower than historically seen in Kawishiwi Lake.  The average yellow perch weight was about one-quarter pound (7.9 inches); 42% of the yellow perch sampled were greater than 8 inches, the largest nearly 12 inches.  Historically, Kawishiwi Lake has maintained a good population of large yellow perch. <br> \n <br> \nKawishiwi Lake is a popular entry point to the BWCAW and the current fish community structure, fish size and abundance should attract anglers to this lake.  There are many camping options, but the access makes Kawishiwi Lake an easy day trip destination within the BWCAW. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Kawishiwi Lake is 372 acres, has a maximum depth of 12 feet, and is located approximately 20 miles northeast of Isabella, MN.  The lake is entirely within the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness (BWCAW) and the access is located at BWCAW entry point #37.  The access is off USFS Rd. #354 and there is a large parking lot suitable for 20+ vehicles.  There is a five site campground near the access and six remote campsites along the shore of the lake.  A self-registration box and day-use permits are located at the access for day-trips and off-season camping.  From May 1 through September 30, a quota system is in place for overnight camping in the BWCAW, requiring a reservation (fee) for travel from each entry point. <br> \n <br> \nThe 2017 standard survey was conducted to monitor the status of the fish community in Kawishiwi Lake. Walleye catch was average relative to similar lakes in northeastern Minnesota.  The average size was 15.0 inches and 1.1 pounds, with 62% of the catch over 15.0 inches long.  Scale analysis indicated fairly consistent recruitment to the population with nine year classes identified.  Walleye growth was average compared to other lakes in the Finland Area. <br> \n <br> \nThe Northern Pike catch was average compared to similar lakes in the area.  The average size was 17.3 inches (1.0 pounds) with only 7% of the catch over 22.0 inches long.  There was one pike sampled which measured 29.8 inches and 5.1 pounds.  Analysis of scale samples determined year classes are produced regularly and growth is average for Finland Area lakes.   <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch were sampled in above average numbers relative to similar lakes in the area.  The size of Yellow Perch averaged 9.0 inches and close to 0.4 pounds, with 26% of the catch over 10 inches in length.  <br> \n <br> \nNine Smallmouth Bass were caught in the gill nets.  The average size was 14.4 inches and 1.6 pounds.  This was the second consecutive survey that sampled Smallmouth Bass in Kawishiwi Lake.   <br> \n <br> \nWhite Sucker were sampled in average numbers relative to similar lakes and size averaged 17.4 inches and 2.3 pounds.  Rock Bass, Green Sunfish, Johnny Darter, Blacknose Shiner, Golden Shiner, and Tadpole Madtom were also sampled with the survey gear.  <br> \n <br> \nKawishiwi Lake is often the start of many BWCAW trips and the lake offers a quality fishery for \"eater size\" Walleyes.  The Yellow Perch population may also be of interest to anglers on the lake.  There may soon be a quality fishery for the newly established Smallmouth Bass population in the lake.  Angling pressure on the lake is presumed to be moderate to high and all anglers and visitors to Kawishiwi Lake must abide by the BWCAW regulations at all times; the lake is entirely non-motorized. <br> \n</p>",

The decline observed during the last two assessments may be the result of the change in the sampling dates. Sampling is now carried out in the fall, and is probably less effective at catching Walleye. Until a new data base is established using a number of fall netting results, comparison of Walleye densities will be suspect.     Gillnet catches of Northern Pike, White Sucker and Yellow Perch have also declined during this later netting period.</p>",
