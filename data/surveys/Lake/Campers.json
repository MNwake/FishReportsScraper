                "narrative": "<p>Campers Lake is a small lake located 12 miles northwest of Isabella. The lake is very shallow with a maximum depth of 2.5 feet and in 2006 the lake supported a moderate stand of wild rice. The shoreline is undeveloped and in a wild state. The lake is accessed by way of a 0.25 mile channel from the Stony River, which is accessed from a boat launch near State Hwy #1. Because of low water and abundant vegetation fishing pressure is low in this lake and it is believed that most of the use is by duck hunters. <br> \n  <br> \nFish species sampled in Campers Lake in 2006 were northern pike, yellow perch and white suckers. Other species sampled in small mesh trap nets were young of the year walleyes and various minnow species.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike were sampled in average numbers in 2006 and averaged 1.3 pounds/fish. They ranged in size from 12.0 to 24.6 inches (3.4 pounds); however, most of the northern pike were smaller than 20 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch were collected in low numbers and all were smaller than 8.5 inches. <br> \n <br> \nAlthough walleyes are present in adjoining Stony River and can migrate into Campers Lake, no adult walleyes were collected in Campers Lake during this assessment. <br> \n</p>",
