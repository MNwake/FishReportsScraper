                "narrative": "<p>Section 6 Mine Pit Lake (officially Unnamed) is a former open pit iron mine located north of Riverton and west of Trommald, between Crosby and Brainerd that has filled with water.  Section 6 is a Designated stream trout lake.  Designated stream trout lakes have additional angling regulations.  Be sure to consult the current Minnesota Fishing Regulations book for regulations, seasons, and possession limits before fishing trout streams or lakes.  Some of the additional regulations include:  A trout stamp is required of anglers ages 16-64 to possess trout and is required while fishing in a Designated lake or stream.  Fishing for any species in a Designated Trout Water when trout season is closed is prohibited.  Fishing for stream trout is allowed from one hour before sunrise until 11pm.  Using or possessing live minnows is prohibited.  Live leeches and worms are legal to use.  Section 6 and all other Designated stream trout lakes in Crow Wing and Cass counties are closed to winter fishing.   <br> \n <br> \nSection 6 Mine Pit Lake is small at 17 acres, but deep with a maximum depth of 172 ft.  The water is very clear with visibility to a depth of around 30 ft.  All of the shoreline has steep slopes to deep water.  Aquatic vegetation is limited in the narrow area of shallow water close to shore.  Most vegetation was found in the small bays along the south shore.  A boat ramp is located on the south shore of the lake.  Access is via a gravel road west from Township Road 309.  Section 6 had been stocked with approximately 1,500 brown trout fingerlings in the fall since the early 1990s.  In 2009 and 2010, 1,000 brown trout yearlings were stocked in the spring instead of fall fingerlings.  Starting in 2011 Section 6 Mine Pit Lake is scheduled to be stocked with 1,000 yearling rainbow trout each spring.  The best trout fishing opportunities are probably during the first month after the trout season opens in May.  Largemouth bass and pumpkinseed sunfish are also present. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Section 6 Lake (officially Unnamed) is a former open pit iron ore mine pit located two miles southwest of Trommald in Crow Wing County.  Section 6 is quite small at 15 acres but reaches depths of 70'.  A public access is located on the southern shore.  Temperature and oxygen conditions suitable for trout occurred from a depth of about 15' down to about 70' in July 2023.  Water clarity is great with a secchi disk reading of 27'.  Two gill nets were set in this survey to sample the fish community. <br> \n <br> \nRainbow Trout are stocked annually as yearlings (1,000/year) and were sampled at a rate of 10.0/gill net.  Average length was 12.1\", with fish up to 17.5\" sampled.  One 20.7\" Brown Trout was also sampled.  Brown Trout are stocked as surplus adults when available. <br> \n  <br> \nSection 6 is a designated stream trout lake.  Designated stream trout lakes have additional angling regulations.  Be sure to consult the current Minnesota Fishing Regulations book for regulations, seasons, and possession limits before fishing designated trout waters. <br> \n <br> \nNo invasive species have been found in Section 6 but are in the area.  Before and after launching, lake users are required to inspect and remove any aquatic plants and animals from their watercraft and trailers as well as pull the plug and drain all water from the watercraft, including bilges, livewells and baitwells. <br> \n</p>",
