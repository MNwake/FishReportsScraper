Most of the sunfish are bluegill, but hybird sunfish are common.  Crappie are average in abundance, butthe average size is small.  A few larger crappie were sampled.  Northern pike and largemouth bass were both takenin good numbers, with larger fish of both species observed. Yellow perch are present, but all perch observed weretoo small to be of interest to anglers.  Carp are common, but most are small.</p>",

There is a large city park on the lake offering many amenities including a swimming beach and a wharf along part of the shore.  Shorefishing is available from the wharf as well as several informal spots off a paved walking path that runs along a good portion of the shoreline.   <br> \n <br> \nThe 2014 fish assessment found an average Bluegill population dominated by small to mid-sized fish.  Average length was less than five inches. Black Crappie abundance was low, with most fish less than 6 inches (range of 4 to 9 inches).  Northern Pike abundance is average for a lake like Carver, however the population consists of decent fish. At this time large Northern Pike are absent from the population (fish 28 inches and larger). Largemouth Bass abundance is low, but some nice sized fish are present. Low numbers of Black Bullhead, Yellow Bullhead, Pumpkinseed Sunfish, Hybrid Sunfish and Yellow Perch were also sampled. <br> \n</p>",

A few largemouth bass were taken in trapnets.  White sucker, yellow perch, golden shiner, and carp were also sampled.</p>",

There is a large city park on the lake offering many amenities including a swimming beach and a boardwalk along part of the shore.  Shorefishing is available from the boardwalk as well as several informal spots off of a paved walking path that runs along a good portion of the shoreline.   <br> \n <br> \nThe 2009 fish assessment found an abundant bluegill population dominated by small to mid-sized fish.  Average length was just under six inches.  Black crappie abundance was low, with most fish less than 7 inches (range of 5 to 8 inches).  Northern pike and largemouth bass abundance was low to moderate, with some nice sized fish present (Largemouth bass up to 16 inches, and northern pike were up to 30 inches).  Low numbers of yellow perch, black bullhead, green sunfish, pumpkinseed sunfish, and hybrid sunfish were also sampled. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Carver Lake is a scenic little lake in Woodbury that is deep for its size (maximum depth 36 feet) and has clear water. A large city park on the lake offers many amenities including a swimming beach and a fishing wharf with a pier along part of the shore.  Shorefishing is available from the wharf as well as several informal spots off a paved walking path that runs along a good portion of the shoreline. The sportfish community is typical of lakes in the region. <br> \n <br> \nThe 2019 fish assessment revealed above average Bluegill numbers and average size structure of 5.5 inches. Black Crappie abundance was below average, with most fish less than 9 inches (range of 5 to 15 inches).  Although Northern Pike abundance is high for a lake like Carver, the population consists of decent sized fish with none over 28 inches. Based on trap netting, Largemouth Bass abundance appears to be above average but fish sampled were small in size. Several small Walleye were also observed during this survey. Low numbers of Yellow Bullhead, Pumpkinseed Sunfish, Green Sunfish and Yellow Perch were also sampled. <br> \n</p>",
