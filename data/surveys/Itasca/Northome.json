                "narrative": "<p>Island Lake is a 3,088 acre lake located five miles south of Northome, Minnesota in the Big Fork River watershed.  A DNR administered access is located on the northwest shore off State Highway 46 and has a concrete ramp and parking for 12 vehicles with trailers.  Walleye are a primary management species and a special regulation with a 17 to 26-inch protected slot limit with one fish over 26 inches allowed in possession (bag of 6) has been in place since 2005.  The lake has received extensive Walleye stocking since 1943, with fry stocked in 16 of the past 25 years.  Approximately 900,000 Pike River strain Walleye are currently stocked annually.  Since the fall of 1997, a night electrofishing survey has been conducted in 16 of 21 years targeting juvenile Walleye.  Six standardized night electrofishing stations are distributed around the lake.  Objectives of these surveys include determining if relative abundance or average length of Walleye sampled electrofishing can predict how many Walleyes will be available to anglers in future years.  In most instances thus far, electrofishing and gill-net catches were higher for year-classes in which fry stocking occurred and gill-net catches were higher for year-classes that had above average lengths while electrofishing.  These evaluations help guide Walleye management in the future.   <br> \n <br> \nA night electrofishing survey was completed in late-September 2017.  A total of 263 age-0 Walleye were sampled, with 11 age-1 and 15 age-2 fish netted.  The netter attempted to collect all age-0 Walleye observed while age-1 and age-2 fish were subsampled to obtain representative lengths.  The catch rate for age-0 Walleye was above average.  The average lengths for age-0, age-1 and age-2 Walleye sampled in 2017 were 5.8, 8.4, and 12.0 inches.  Previously sampled age-0 Walleye have had an average length of 5.9 inches.   <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Island Lake is a relatively shallow and productive, 3,088 acre lake located in the far northwestern part of Itasca County, two miles south of Northome, MN.  The lake has one main public access on the northwest side and moderate shoreline development.  The 2014 lake management plan (LMP) indicates Walleye and Northern Pike as the primary species of management because they are well suited to the lake and have active management while Yellow Perch were a secondary species because they do not require active management.  The LMP goals were to maintain a catch of 6.0 Walleye/net with 50, 25 and 10 percent of the sample over 15, 20, and 25 inches in length; maintain a quality Northern Pike population represented by a catch of 5.0 fish/net and at least 40 and 20 percent of the sample over 21 and 28 inches in length.  In order to achieve these goals, special regulations to reduce harvest were necessary.  In 2003, a 24 to 36 inch protected slot length limit with only one Northern Pike over 36 inches in possession was implemented.  Two years later a Walleye slot length limit was applied to the lake that required all fish between 17 and 26 inches to be released and only one fish over 26 inches could be in possession. <br> \n <br> \nA targeted survey was conducted to evaluate the special regulations and the Walleye stocking strategy in June of 2021.  The survey only used gill nets to assess select game species for numbers, size, age and growth. <br> \n <br> \nThe Walleye stocking strategy over the last 30 years has went from high-density fry stocking every other year to an incrementally lower-density fry stocking on an annual basis.  Results from fall night electrofishing for young Walleye and summer gill netting on Island Lake found that a good year-class is more dependent on the right environmental conditions (timing of spring, progression of water temperatures, other fish community interactions, etc.) than the number of Walleye fry stocked in that year.  Many other lakes in the Grand Rapids Area and around the state have also experienced this as well.  As a result, our goal is to continually refine the stocking strategy based on new data from Island Lake and around the state to provide the most cost-effective fishery to anglers. <br> \n <br> \nIsland Lake has a history of being a good Walleye fishery.  Walleye catch rates have fluctuated from a low of 0.9/gill net in 1984 to a high of 13.9/gill net in 2021.  The record high catch in 2021 exceeded the management goal of 6 fish/gill net.  The sampled fish ranged from 7.2 to 25.2 inches and averaged 14.4 inches.  The LMP size distribution goals were not achieved in this survey because of one young, strong year-class.  Walleye age and growth information was determined from bony structures like scales or an inner-ear bone called an otolith.  Eleven age-classes were identified with fish from age 1 to 12 represented.  The strong 2018 year-class represented 59 percent of the sample, though several other year-classes were well represented.  Walleye averaged nearly 15.0 inches after four years of growth.  Walleye angling should continue to be good given the results of this survey. <br> \n <br> \nHigh pike populations are undesirable because they typically have slow growth and poor size distributions.  Consequently, management goals and strategies seek to produce populations with low to moderate numbers so more fish attain larger sizes, which also is beneficial for the entire fish community.  Northern Pike gill-net catch rates have ranged from a low of 1.1 fish/net in 1954 to a high of 11.7 fish/net in 1969.  Though the pike catch of 6.8 fish/gill net in 2021 did not attain the LMP goal, it was average for the lake.  The sampled fish ranged from 19.6 to 37.1 inches and averaged 27.2 inches.  The size structure goals were exceeded since 91% of the sample was longer than 21 inches and 44% was longer than 28 inches.  The catch of pike under 22 inches has declined while the catch of fish from 24 to 36 inches has increased dramatically since the regulation was implemented in 2003.  In addition, the age distribution and growth has improved.  Nine age-classes were identified that ranged from age 2 to 10.  Recruitment appeared to be consistent with no dominant year-class.  Northern Pike averaged 27.0 inches after four years of growth, which was fast compared to the statewide average.  Anglers should have good opportunity to catch moderate sized pike in Island. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch are important prey for predators in Island Lake and can occasionally provide fish large enough to attract anglers.  Yellow Perch gill-net catch rates have fluctuated from a low of 15.2 fish/net in 1954 to a high of 151.8 fish/net in 1969.  The 2021 catch of 67.9 fish/net exceeded the lake average of 58.4 fish/net.  The sampled perch ranged from 5.3 to 11.3 and averaged 7.3 inches.  Age and growth information was not collected in this survey. <br> \n <br> \nTullibee are important to fish communities as prey for many predator species, especially Northern Pike and Walleye.  However, monitoring them can be difficult because they frequently live suspended over deep water, an area our standard sampling gear was not designed to sample.  As a result, catch rates can be highly variable and interpretation of the data can be challenging.  In fact, catch rates varied from the highest on record in 2006 (11.8 fish/net) to the lowest on record in 2010 (0.4 fish/net).  In 2021, the catch was again equal to the lowest catch on record (0.4 fish/net).  The five sampled fish ranged from 8.1 to 16.5 inches and averaged 10.8 inches.  Though the fish were not aged, multiple age-classes were likely sampled based on the size distribution.  Minnesota has documented a declining trend in Tullibee catches around the state since the 1970s so the Island Lake population may be vulnerable to extirpation because it has marginal habitat.  The shallow and productive nature of the lake often results in warmer than ideal summer temperatures for species like Tullibee.  <br> \n <br> \nOther species observed during the survey included Bluegill, Hybrid Sunfish, Largemouth Bass, Pumpkinseed Sunfish, Rock Bass, Smallmouth Bass and White Sucker. <br> \n <br> \nIn order to maintain or improve fish and wildlife populations, water quality and habitat must be protected.  People often associate water quality problems with large-scale agricultural, forestry, urban development or industrial practices in the watershed.  In reality, the impact of land use decisions on one lake lot may be relatively small, yet the cumulative impact of those decisions on many lake lots can result in a significant decline in water quality and habitat.  For example, removing shoreline and aquatic vegetation, fertilizing lawns, mowing to the water's edge, installing beach sand blankets, failing septic systems and uncontrolled run-off, all contribute excess nutrients and sediment which degrade water quality and habitat.  Understanding these cumulative impacts and taking steps to avoid or minimize them will help to insure our quality fisheries can be enjoyed by future generations.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Island Lake is primarily managed for walleye,  although good populations of northern pike and panfish are in the lake.  Walleye have been stocked on a bienniel basis since the early 1980's.  Adult bluegill were stocked in 1984.     The catch rate for walleye sampled in gill nets (4.2/set) was within the expected range for lakes of this type (3.3-8.8/set), and near the mean catch rate for the last nine surveys on Island Lake (5.3/set).  The mean weight for gill net sampled walleyes (2.4 pounds) exceeded the expected range (1.1-2.1 pounds), and was twice the mean weight of the last nine surveys for Island Lake.  Sampled walleyes had a mean length of 18.5 inches and ranged from 6.7-27.5 inches.  Walleye growth rates were near the statewide mean.     Northern pike sampled in gill nets had a catch rate (8.7/set) nearly greater than the expected range.  These fish ranged in length from 13.3 to 34.6 inches (mean length= 2.4 inches), and had a mean weight of 2.8 pounds.    The yellow perch catch rate for gill nets (64.0/set) was above the expected range, and length ranged from 4.5 to 12.1 inches (mean length= 6.6 inches).  Yellow perch were also sampled in trap nets, with a catch rate (40.5/set) well above the expected range.  These trap net caught fish had a length ranging from 3.9 to 10.4 inches, and a mean length of 6.3 inches.  The high abundance of yellow perch may be partly responsible for the abundance of walleye and northern pike as they are an important component of their diets.     It appears that the stocking of bluegills in 1984 was successful in creating a naturally reproducing population.  The bluegill catch rate in trap nets (11.5/set) was within the expected range (4.4-49.0/set).  These were smaller fish, ranging in length from 3.4 to 5.7 inches.  This was the first time that bluegill were sampled with trap nets.      Pumpkinseed sunfish were sampled with trap nets, and had a catch rate (39.2/set) well above the expected range.  The length of sampled pumpkinseed ranged from 2.4 to 8.1 inches, with a mean length of 4.2 inches.     Catch rates for gill net caught tullibee, another important fish in northern pike diets, were 8.6/set and exceeded the expected range (0.8-6.2/set).     Other species sampled in test nets include: black, brown, and yellow bullhead, black crappie, hybrid sunfish, rock bass, tadpole madtom, and white sucker.     Water chemistry analyses indicate that Island Lake has high levels of phosphorus.  Lakeshore owners can do their part in preventing the addition of phosphorus to the lake by minimizing  fertilization and by maintaining shoreline vegetation.</p>",

The boat was setup with two spider array droppers, pulsed DC, 4 amps, and 200 volts.  The surface water temperature was 64 degrees F and conductivity was 185 micro mho.  Visibility ranged from poor to moderate depending on the amount of algae.  All six standardized stations were sampled for a total of 100 minutes on-time. <br> \n <br> \nSpring of 2008 was very late and cold due to a 20 to 30 inch snowstorm throughout the region in early April.  As a result, most area lakes experienced generally poor survival of young walleye whether from natural reproduction or fry stocking and the fish that did survive were small compared to other years.  Island Lake was stocked with 1.38 million walleye fry in 2008.  In the 2008 assessment, 85 YOY walleye were sampled for a catch rate of 51.1/hr on-time.  The fish ranged from 4.1 to 5.5 inches and had a mean length of 4.8 inches.  The 2008 catch was similar to the 2007 catch of nearly 70/hr. <br> \n <br> \nStrong year-classes typically do not occur in successive years due to a suppression effect that may be related to competition for prey.  Electrofishing catch rates from the last two years were higher than expected considering the two previous fall assessments had catch rates of 170 and 515 YOY/hr in 2005 and 2006.    Mean length of the 2008 (4.8 inches) and 2007 YOY (5.6 inches) may be an indicator of suppression since the two previous years mean lengths were 6.8 and 6.5 inches in 2005 and 2006. <br> \n <br> \nNight electrofishing has been conducted nearly annually since 1997.  Although natural reproduction has been documented and our current sampling protocol does not allow us to distinguish between natural and stocked fish, it appears stocking is contributing greatly to fall YOY walleye population.  Catch rates in fry-stocked years have exceeded 100/hr in 4 of the 7 assessments.  However, catch rates in non-stocked years have been low ranging from 0 to 14 YOY/hr.  Future population assessments will help determine how effective electrofishing is in predicting year-class strength as it translates into gill net catch rates. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Island Lake is a class 27 lake located in the far northwestern part of Itasca County, two miles south of Northome, MN.  The lake has one main public access on the northwest side and moderate shoreline development.  The 2011 lake management plan indicates walleye and northern pike as the primary species of management with yellow perch as a secondary species.  In 2003, a 24 to 36 inch protected slot length limit with only one northern pike over 36 inches in possession was implemented.  Two years later a walleye slot length limit was applied to the lake that required all fish between 17 and 26 inches to be released and only one fish over 26 inches could be in possession.  Only gill nets were set in this assessment to evaluate the special regulations <br> \n <br> \nWalleye catch rates have fluctuated from a low of 0.9/gill net in 1984 to a high of 12.8/gill net in 2013.  The 2013 catch exceeded the management goal of 6 fish/gill net.  The sampled fish ranged from 9.1 to 26.5 inches and had an average length of 16.7 inches.  The size structure goals of having more than 50% of the sample longer than 15 inches and more than 25% of the sample longer than 20 inches were achieved in this assessment. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye age and growth information was determined from scale, opercle, and otolith analysis.  Twelve year-classes were identified with fish from two to 16 years old present.  The strong 2010 year class represented 36 percent of the sample but the 2006 through 2009 year classes were also well represented.  Walleye averaged nearly 16.0 inches after four years of growth.  Growth was similar to statewide averages through age 10. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike gill-net catch rates have ranged from a low of 1.1 fish/net in 1954 to a high of 11.7 fish/net in 1969.  The northern pike gill-net catch was 10.7 fish/net in 2013; up from 6.3 fish/net in 2010.  The catch exceeded the management goal of 6.0 fish/net and the lake class 3rd quartile value of 9.0 fish/net.  The sampled fish ranged from 18.0 to 32.6 inches and averaged 25.4 inches.  The size structure goals of having more than 40% of the sample longer than 21 inches and more than 15% of the sample longer than 28 inches were exceeded.  Eight year-classes were identified from cliethra and scales ranging from age 2 to age 9.  Recruitment appears to be consistent with nearly 20 fish or more in each age class from age 2 to 7.  There did not appear to be a dominant year class.  Northern pike averaged 24.5 inches after four years of growth, which was above the statewide average of 20.5. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch gill-net catch rates have fluctuated from a low of 15.2 fish/net in 1954 to a high of 151.8 fish/net in 1969.  The 2013 catch of 125.1 fish/net was the second highest on record.  The catches have approached or exceeded the lake class 3rd quartile (46.3 fish/gill net) in most of the assessments.  The sampled yellow perch ranged from 5.4 to 12.0 and averaged 7.6 inches.  Age and growth information was not collected in this assessment. <br> \n <br> \nTullibees are important to fish communities as prey for many predator species, especially northern pike and walleye.  Tullibees are often difficult to catch because they frequently live over deep water, an area our standard sampling gear was not designed to sample.  As a result, catch rates can be highly variable and interpretation of the data can be challenging.  The catch rates from the four prior assessments are an example of the highly variable nature of tullibee catches: the catch was 8.6 fish/net in 1997 (2nd highest for the lake), six years later, the catch was 1.7 fish/net, the catch was 11.8 fish/net in 2006 (highest on record for lake), and in 2010, the catch was 0.4 fish/net (lowest on record).  In 2013, we sampled 1.7 tullibee per gill net.  The fish ranged from 7.1 to 16.7 inches and had a mean length of 13.4 inches.  The population may be vulnerable to extirpation because Island Lake has marginal habitat due to the shallow and productive nature of the lake that can result in warmer than ideal temperatures for tullibee during the summer. <br> \n <br> \nOther species observed during the special assessment included black crappie, rock bass, smallmouth bass, trout perch and white sucker. <br> \n <br> \nIn order to maintain or improve fish and wildlife populations, water quality and habitat must be protected.  People often associate water quality problems with large-scale agricultural, forestry, urban development or industrial practices in the watershed.  In reality, the impact of land use decisions on one lake lot may be relatively small, yet the cumulative impact of those decisions on many lake lots can result in a significant decline in water quality and habitat.  For example, removing shoreline and aquatic vegetation, fertilizing lawns, mowing to the water's edge, installing beach sand blankets, failing septic systems and uncontrolled run-off, all contribute excess nutrients and sediment which degrade water quality and habitat.  Understanding these cumulative impacts and taking steps to avoid or minimize them will help to insure our quality fisheries can be enjoyed by future generations.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Island Lake is a 3,088-acre lake in northwestern Itasca County within the Big Fork River watershed.  Island Lake is located 2 miles south of Northome, MN.  The lake has a maximum depth of 35 ft and 1,195 littoral acres.  There is a public access with a concrete ramp on the northwest shore.  There are four inlets and an outlet draining to Shallow Pond Lake.Walleye gill-net catch was 4.5/net, which was within the expected range for similar lakes.  Catch rates in the last three assessments have been stable only varying from 4.2 to 5.0/net.  Size structure was excellent with fish up to 26 inches sampled and a good portion of the sample between 15 and 19 inches.  Growth was similar to the statewide average for ages 1 to 10.  Strong year classes were present in 1996, 1999, and 2001, which were all stocked years.  Eighty percent of the walleye sampled corresponded to stocked year classes.  Northern pike gill-net catch was 6.8/net, which was within the expected range for similar lakes.  Catch rates in past assessments have varied from 1.1 to 11.7/net.  In recent assessments catch rates have been stable and varied from 5.6 to 8.7/net.  Size structure was poor with few fish over 24 inches.  Growth was similar to the statewide average with fish reaching 24 inches by age 5.  A protected slot limit for northern pike from 24 to 36 inches was implemented in 2003 to improve the population size structure.  Future assessments will evaluate the effectiveness of this regulation.During a public meeting regarding the special regulation for northern pike, several people expressed concern about northern pike preying on walleye.  During this assessment 85 northern pike stomachs were examined to determine what type of prey they had consumed.  Thirty northern pike had something in their stomach and 55 were empty.  Of the thirty fish with prey items in their stomach, 14 had yellow perch, 8 had unidentified fish, and 4 had crayfish.  Other species included bluegill, burbot, bullhead, and only one fish had a walleye in its stomach.  Based on this small sample, northern pike predation on walleye has a limited effect on the walleye population.Yellow perch gill-net catch was 39.1/net, which was within the expected range for similar lakes.  Catch rates in the last three assessments have varied from 38.5 to 64.0/net.  Size structure was moderate with 34% of the population over 9 inches.  Growth was slower than the statewide average for ages 1 and 2 and similar to the average for ages 3 to 9.Bluegill have never been abundant in Island Lake and were stocked at one time in an attempt to increase their abundance.  Trap-net catch rate in 2003 was 0.7/net, which was below the expected range.  Bluegill have only been sampled in one other assessment from 1997 when the catch rate was 11.5/net.  Growth was generally faster than the lake class average with fish reaching 6.7 inches by age 4.  Size structure was good with a few fish up to 8 inches sampled.  Black crappie trap-net catch was 0.3/net, which was at the low end of the expected range for similar lakes.  Catch rates in past assessments have also been low.  All crappie sampled in 2003 were less than 4 inches.  Largemouth bass were not sampled in this survey, however, one 15-inch smallmouth bass was sampled in a gill net.  This represents the first time smallmouth bass have been sampled in Island Lake.  Shoreline seining also sampled many young-of-the-year smallmouth bass.  Other fish sampled include burbot, rock bass, tullibee, white sucker, brown bullhead, common shiner, and pumpkinseed sunfish. In order to maintain or improve fish and wildlife populations, water quality and habitat must be protected.  People often associate water quality problems with large-scale agricultural, forestry, urban development or industrial practices in the watershed.  In reality, the impact of land use decisions on one lake lot may be relatively small, yet, the cumulative impact of those decisions on many lake lots can result in a significant decline in water quality and habitat.  For example, removing shoreline and aquatic vegetation, fertilizing lawns, mowing to the waters edge, installing beach sand blankets, failing septic systems and uncontrolled run-off, all contribute excess nutrients and sediment, which degrade water quality and habitat.  Understanding these cumulative impacts and taking steps to avoid or minimize them will help to insure our quality fisheries can be enjoyed by future generations.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Island Lake is a class 27 lake located in the far northwestern part of Itasca County, two miles south of Northome, MN.  The lake has one main public access on the northwest side of the lake and moderate shoreline development.  The 2004 lake management plan indicates walleye and northern pike as the primary species of management with yellow perch as a secondary species.  Island Lake has special walleye and northern pike length regulations that are in the early stages of being evaluated.  The walleye regulation is a protected 17 to 26-inch slot length limit, with only one fish over 26 inches allowed in possession.  The northern pike regulation is a protected 24 to 36-inch slot length limit, with only one fish over 36 inches allowed in possession. <br> \n <br> \nPrior to the 2006 population assessment, walleye catch rates fluctuated from a low of 0.9/gill net in 1984 to a high of 9.1/gill net in 1949.  In 2006, the walleye gill-net catch rate of 10.1 fish/net exceeded the management goal of 6 fish/net, and was the highest on record.  The sampled fish ranged from 7.3 to 23.3 inches and had a mean length of 17.9 inches.  Size structure had PSD, RSD-P, and RSD-M values of 96, 21, and 0, respectively. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye age and growth information was determined from scale, opercle, and otolith analysis.  Nine year-classes were identified with fish from one to 10 years old present.  Several strong year classes were observed including the natural 2002 year-class.  Walleye fry were stocked in 2003 but very few fish from this year class were sampled.  The two strong year classes prior to 2003 may have suppressed the stocked 2003 year-class.  The 2005 year-class may also turn out to be strong based on the 11 fish sampled in gill nets.  These fish averaged 7.6 inches and were likely underestimated due to gill-net mesh size selectivity.  Growth was similar to statewide averages and walleye averaged nearly 16.0 inches after four years of growth.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike gill-net catch rates have ranged from a low of 1.1 fish/net in 1954 to a high of 11.7 fish/net in 1969.  The northern pike gill-net catch was 9.2 fish/net in 2006.  The fish ranged from 15.8 to 34.1 inches and averaged 23.4 inches.  Nine year-classes were identified from cliethra and scales ranging from one to nine years old.  Northern pike averaged 22.8 inches after four years of growth compared to the statewide average of 20.5 inches. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch gill-net catch rates have fluctuated from a low of 15.2 fish/net in 1954 to a high of 151.8 fish/net in 1969.  In 2006, the catch was 93.7 fish/gill net, more than double the catch from 2003.  The catch also exceeded the lake class 3rd quartile of 46.3 fish/gill net.  The sampled yellow perch ranged from 4.9 to 11.2 inches.  Fish from two to seven years old were sampled with the 2002 and 2003 year classes being the most prevalent.  Growth was similar to the statewide average.\t\t\t\t <br> \n <br> \nTullibee can be difficult to catch because they frequently live over deep water, an area that our standard sampling gear was not designed to sample.  As a result, catch rates can be highly variable.  However, they are important to fish communities as a prey source for many predator species, especially northern pike and walleye.  Tullibee gill-net catch rates have been as low as 0.8 fish/net in 1991 and as high as 11.8 fish/net in 2006.  The 2006 catch was the highest on record for Island Lake.  The fish ranged from 6.6 to 15.6 inches and averaged 9.3 inches.  The length distribution would indicate that at least two good year classes were present. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill had never been sampled with trap nets prior to 1997, when 11.5 fish/net were sampled.  Since 1997, the trap net catch rates have declined to 0.7 fish/net in 2003 but then increased to 4.7 fish/net in 2006.  The most recent catch rate was similar to the lake class 1st quartile of 4.4 fish/net.  The sampled bluegill ranged from 3.5 to 9.6 inches.  Age and growth information was not collected in this assessment. <br> \n  <br> \nOther species observed during the population assessment included black crappie, burbot, common shiner, largemouth bass, pumpkinseed sunfish, rock bass, smallmouth bass, white sucker, and yellow bullhead. <br> \n <br> \nIn order to maintain or improve fish and wildlife populations, water quality and habitat must be protected.  People often associate water quality problems with large-scale agricultural, forestry, urban development or industrial practices in the watershed.  In reality, the impact of land use decisions on one lake lot may be relatively small, yet, the cumulative impact of those decisions on many lake lots can result in a significant decline in water quality and habitat.  For example, removing shoreline and aquatic vegetation, fertilizing lawns, mowing to the water's edge, installing beach sand blankets, failing septic systems and uncontrolled run-off, all contribute excess nutrients and sediment which degrade water quality and habitat.  Understanding these cumulative impacts and taking steps to avoid or minimize them will help to insure our quality fisheries can be enjoyed by future generations. <br> \n</p>",

Yellow perch appear to be the most abundant secondary fish species which also include brown bullheads, pumpkinseeds, black crappie, and burbot.Gill and trap net catch indices (CPUE's) were evaluated with quartile ranges developed for lake class #27.  Those species with CPUE values between the first and third quartile indices would indicate a normal population.  The net catch indices of most species caught in this assessment fell within this range with the exception of the tullibee and rock bass.  The rock bass gill net CPUE (9.3) was approximately twice the quartile value (4.5) indicating a high population while the tullibee CPUE (0.2) was below the first quartile value (0.8).</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Island Lake is a class 27 lake located in the far northwestern part of Itasca County, two miles south of Northome, MN.  The lake has one main public access on the northwest side and moderate shoreline development.  The 2007 lake management plan indicates walleye and northern pike as the primary species of management with yellow perch as a secondary species.  In 2003, a 24 to 36 inch protected slot length limit with only one northern pike over 36 inches in possession was implemented.  Two years later a walleye slot length limit was applied to the lake that required all fish between 17 and 26 inches to be released and only one fish over 26 inches could be in possession. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye catch rates have fluctuated from a low of 0.9/gill net in 1984 to a high of 10.1/gill net in 2006.  In 2010, the walleye gill-net catch rate of 5.8 fish/net was near the management goal of 6 fish/net.  The catch exceeded the lake class median of 5.5 fish/gill net.  The sampled fish ranged from 8.5 to 24.0 inches and averaged 16.9 inches.  The size structure goals were achieved in this assessment. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye age and growth information was determined from scale, opercle, and otolith analysis.  Thirteen year-classes were identified with fish from one to 14 years old present.  All of the strong year classes (2002, 2005, and 2006) would have experienced multiple years of angler harvest by the time of this assessment.  Walleye averaged 15.2 inches after four years of growth.  Growth was similar to statewide averages through age 8.  Slower growth after age 8 appears to be influenced by low sample size and older males. <br> \n <br> \n Northern pike gill-net catch rates have ranged from a low of 1.1 fish/net in 1954 to a high of 11.7 fish/net in 1969.  The northern pike gill-net catch was 9.2 fish/net in 2006 and declined to 6.3 fish/net in 2010, remaining near the management goal of 6.0 fish/net.  The sampled fish ranged from 17.2 to 31.0 inches and had a mean length of 24.2 inches.  The size structure goal of having PSD and RSD-P of 40 and 15 were almost achieved; PSD and RSD-P values were 81 and 10.  Even the smallest northern pike sampled were sexually mature for both males and females.  Seven year-classes were identified from cliethra and scales ranging from age 1 to age 7.  Recruitment appears to be consistent.  Fish estimated to be from the 2005 year class were the most common.  Northern pike averaged 23.3 inches after four years of growth, which was above the statewide average of 20.5. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch gill-net catch rates have fluctuated from a low of 15.2 fish/net in 1954 to a high of 151.8 fish/net in 1969.  In the last three assessments, the gill net catch was 39.1 fish/net in 2003, 93.7 fish/net in 2006, and 39.7 fish/net in 2010.  The catches have approached or exceeded the lake class 3rd quartile of 46.3 fish/gill net.  The sampled yellow perch ranged from 5.2 to 12.0 and had a mean length of 7.4 inches.  Age and growth information was not collected in this assessment.\t\t\t\t <br> \n <br> \nTullibee can be difficult to catch because they frequently live over deep water, an area our standard sampling gear was not designed to sample.  As a result, catch rates can be highly variable.  However, they are important to fish communities as a prey source for many predator species, especially northern pike and walleye.  The catch rates from the last four assessments are an example of the highly variable nature of tullibee catches: the catch was 8.6 fish/net in 1997 (2nd highest for the lake), six years later, the catch was 1.7 fish/net, the catch was 11.8 fish/net in 2006 (highest on record for lake), and in 2010, the catch was 0.4 fish/net (lowest on record).  The fish sampled in 2010 ranged from 8.3 to 12.7 inches and averaged 10.5 inches.  Two distinct size groups in the length distribution would indicate two year classes were present. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill had never been sampled with trap nets prior to 1997, when 11.5 fish/net were sampled.  Since 1997, the trap net catch rates have declined to 0.7 fish/net in 2003, increased to 4.7 fish/net in 2006, and declined to 0.3 fish/net in 2010.  The sampled bluegill ranged from 3.2 to 9.3 inches.  Age and growth information was not collected in this assessment. <br> \n <br> \nOther species observed during the population assessment included black crappie, pumpkinseed sunfish, rock bass, smallmouth bass, and white sucker. <br> \n</p>",

Walleye fry (1.2 million) were stocked in 2007.  The boat was set up with two spider array droppers, pulsed DC, 4 amps, and 200 volts.  The surface water temperature was 57 degrees F and conductivity was 166 umho.  Visibility ranged from poor to good depending on exposure to the wind.  Five of the six standardized stations were sampled for a total of 91 minutes on-time.  Station 1 was not sampled in 2007 due to large waves.  \n\nIn the 2007 assessment, 106 YOY walleye were sampled for a catch rate of 69.9/hr on-time.  The catch was quite high considering the two previous fall electrofishing assessments had catch rates of 170 and 515 YOY/hr in 2005 and 2006.  Strong year-classes typically do not occur in successive years due to a suppression affect that may be related to competition for prey.  Mean length of the 2007 YOY (5.6 inches) may be an indicator of suppression since the two previous years mean lengths were 6.8 and 6.5 inches in 2005 and 2006.\n\nNight electrofishing has been conducted nearly annually since 1997.  Although natural reproduction has been documented and our current sampling protocol does not allow us to distinguish between natural and stocked fish, it appears stocking is contributing greatly to fall YOY walleye population.  Catch rates in fry-stocked years have exceeded 100/hr in 4 of the 6 assessments.  However, catch rates in non-stocked years have been low ranging from 0 to 14 YOY/hr.  Future population assessments will help determine how effective electrofishing is in predicting year-class strength as it translates into gill net catch rates.\n</p>",

Annual fall, night electrofishing has been conducted since 1999, sampling young-of-the-year (YOY) walleye to evaluate natural reproduction and/or survival of stocked fry.  Pike River walleye fry were stocked biennially from 1996 to 2004 and stocked annually from 2005-2011.  A Smith-Root GPP 5.0 electrofishing boat equipped with a spider array anode using pulsed DC current operating at 5 amps and 250 volts was used for the survey.  Sampling occurred on 9/19/2011 with a water conductivity of 219 S/cm and surface temperature of 58 degrees F.  Visibility was variable between stations. <br> \n <br> \nAll six of the established stations were sampled, targeting YOY and yearling walleye.  YOY walleye were sampled at a rate of 165.4/hr on-time in this assessment, exceeding the lake median of 100.7/hr on-time.  Lengths were from 5 to 6.7 inches with a mean length of 5.9 inches.  The 2010 assessment sampled YOY walleye at a rate of 131.5/hr.  Yearling walleye may be a better indicator of year class strength by including first winter mortality.  Yearling walleye have been included in sampling since 2008.  Yearlings were sampled at a rate of 27.3/hr on-time, exceeding the lake median of 11.1/hr.  Lengths were from 8.4 to 11 inches with a mean length of 9.6 inches.  The previous assessment sampled yearling walleye at a rate of 10.8/hr.  These results would suggest reasonable YOY survival in summer 2011, similar to that observed in other lakes in the Grand Rapids area sampling fall YOY walleye. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of nearshore fish species in Island Lake was conducted on July 11-15, 2021 by Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program Staff.  Nearshore sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot seine, where possible.  Backpack electrofishing was completed at all 24 sampling stations, but one station was sampled from the boat due to soft substrate, deep water, and dense vegetation.  Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample eleven stations, a 15-foot seine was used at eleven stations, and site conditions prevented the use of seines at two stations.  Nearshore sampling captured 19 species of fish including six species that are intolerant of disturbance (i.e., Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Burbot, Iowa Darter, Rock Bass, Smallmouth Bass) and 1 species that is tolerant of disturbance (Black Bullhead). <br> \n <br> \nA concurrent summer trap net survey was conducted by IBI Program Staff. Fifteen trap nets were set along the shoreline in locations that encompassed multiple habitat types. Yellow Perch were the most abundant by number and Yellow Perch, Walleye, and Northern Pike comprised the majority of the trap net catch biomass.   <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore and trap net data were combined with gill net data from a June 2021 survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based IBI (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment.  In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g., Blackchin Shiner, Least Darter, and Rock Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g., Black Bullhead and Green Sunfish).  The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake.  For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.   <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey indicates Island Lake is healthy as indicated by a FIBI score well above the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes.  Data from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Big Fork River Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.</p>",

Low water level and a strong algae bloom made sampling difficult in some areas.  Four of six standardized stations were sampled for a total of 1 hour and 8 minutes of on-time.  In this assessment 585 age-0 walleye were sampled for a catch rate of 515.5/hour.  Due to the large number of walleye present, some fish were missed, so this catch rate could be considered a minimum catch rate.  Walleye fry were stocked in the spring and the electrofishing results indicate good initial survival of the 2006 year class.  Night electrofishing has been conducted almost annually since 1997.  Catch rates in fry-stocked years have generally been good with catch rates exceeding 100/hour in 4 of 5 stocked years.  Catch rates in non-stocked years have typically been low ranging from 0 to 14/hour.  Catch rates from electrofishing assessments on other area walleye lakes were generally good this year, suggesting that 2006 was a relatively good year class across the region.  The relatively large average size of the fish (6.5 inches) should contribute to good overwinter survival.  Future population assessments will help determine the accuracy of these preliminary indications about the relative strength of the 2006 year class. </p>",

The boat was set up with two spider array droppers, pulsed DC, 5 amps, and 200 volts.  The surface water temperature was 55 F and conductivity was 218 mhos.  Visibility was good throughout the night.  All six standardized stations were sampled for a total of 90 minutes on-time. <br> \n <br> \nSpring of 2014 was again very late in northern Minnesota.  The resulting Walleye year-class appeared to be fairly good throughout the region.  Island Lake was stocked with 1.2 million Walleye fry in 2014.  In the 2014 assessment, 253 YOY Walleye were sampled for a catch rate of 168.7/hr on-time.  The fish ranged from 4.5 to 6.6 inches and had a mean length of 5.7 inches. <br> \n <br> \nNight electrofishing has been conducted nearly annually since 1997.  Although natural reproduction has been documented in previous assessments and may at times be an important contributor to the population, it appears stocking is a more consistent contributor to the fall YOY Walleye population in Island Lake.  In 2005, we began a stocking strategy to reduce fry numbers but stock annually.  Results from fall electrofishing indicate the YOY Walleye catch rates were similar to the catch rates when higher fry-stocking occurred.  It appears the spring and summer conditions (i.e. timing, water temperatures, or available food) are more important in determining fall year-class strength than the number of fry stocked.  Future population assessments and fall electrofishing samples should allow us to refine our stocking strategy. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Island Lake is a class 27 lake located near Northome, Minnesota.  Fall, night electrofishing (with SR-16S) was conducted to sample young-of-the-year (YOY) Walleye.  The boat was setup with two spider array droppers, pulsed DC, 4.0 amps, and 200 volts.  The surface water temperature was 52 F.  Visibility was good throughout the night.  All six standardized stations were sampled for a total of 83 minutes on-time. <br> \n <br> \nThe timing of the 2015 spring was average for our work area, but the weather was generally cool and wet during the spring.  The resulting Walleye year-classes appeared to be poor throughout the region.  Island Lake was stocked with 900,000 Walleye fry in 2015.  In the 2015 survey, 94 YOY Walleye were sampled for a catch rate of 67.8/hr on-time.  The fish ranged from 5.0 to 7.1 inches and had a mean length of 6.4 inches.  An additional 23 suspected yearling Walleye were captured during electrofishing.  In the future, it may be determined that yearling Walleye catch rates are a better predictor of year-class strength than YOY. <br> \n <br> \nNight electrofishing has been conducted nearly annually since 1997.  Although natural reproduction has been documented in previous assessments and may at times be an important contributor to the population, it appears stocking is a more consistent contributor to the fall YOY walleye population in Island Lake.  In 2005, we began a stocking strategy to reduce fry numbers but stock annually.  Results from fall electrofishing indicate the YOY walleye catch rates were similar to the catch rates when higher fry-stocking occurred.  It appears the spring and summer conditions (i.e. timing, water temperatures, or available food) are more important in determining fall year-class strength than the number of fry stocked.  Future surveys and fall electrofishing samples should allow us to refine our stocking strategy. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers should note that reproduction and recruitment is variable in Walleye populations.  Fall electrofishing can be an effective tool to document Walleye reproduction and/or survival to their first fall when conducted as part of a long-term evaluation, but individual electrofishing events are often a poor indicator of year-class strength or future angling success.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Island Lake is a class 27 lake located about five miles south of Northome, MN.  Walleye are a primary management species and has received extensive Walleye stocking since 1943.  In 2005, a 17 to 26 inch protected slot length limit was established.  Walleye fry have been stocked annually since 2013 except for 2020, due to safety policies pertaining to COVID-19. Island Lake was stocked with 717,000 Walleye fry in 2024 (600/littoral acre). <br> \n <br> \nNumerous fall young-of-the-year (YOY) Walleye electrofishing surveys have been conducted since 1997 that evaluated various stocking strategies, including no stocking so natural reproduction could be evaluated.  Fall electrofishing catches have ranged from 0 to 593 YOY/h with lowesr catches associated with years of no stocking.  As a result, the 2022 lake management plan recommended annual low-density fry stocking to ensure fish were in the lake when conditions were favorable to produce a good year-class. <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nThe 2024 survey had surface water temperatures near 70 F.  Wave action resulted in moderate to poor visibility; however, catchability was not impacted by conditions. A total of 45 YOY Walleye were sampled for a catch rate of 29/hr on-time.  Sampled fish ranged from 4.8 to 6.7 inches and averaged 5.5 inches.  Three additional yearling or older Walleye were captured during electrofishing.  These fish ranged from 8.0 to 13.1 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nSampling results suggest poor Walleye recruitment for Island Lake in 2024 and is likely attributed to the long, drawn-out, cool spring.  These conditions are often associated with poor recruitment for natural and stocked Walleye fry alike.  Less than average catches and growth was also observed on Lake Winnibigoshish and Jessie Lake during the fall of 2024.  <br> \n <br> \nAnglers should note that reproduction and recruitment are variable in Walleye populations, and spring conditions (timing and water temperature fluctuations) can be an important factor in that variability.  Fall electrofishing can be an effective tool to document Walleye reproduction and/or survival to their first fall when conducted as part of a long-term evaluation, but individual electrofishing events are often a poor indicator of year-class strength or future angling success. <br> \n</p>",
