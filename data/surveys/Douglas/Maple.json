                "narrative": "<p>Maple lake is an 815 acre mesotrophic lake located between the cities of Alexandria and Glenwood in south central Douglas County.  The lake is part of a tri-lake chain encompassing lakes Reno and Turtle.  These lakes are connected by unnavigable channels under State Highway 29.  The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources maintains two public access sites with one located on the west end of the lake just southwest of the city of Forada and the other on the north side of the lake, off County Highway 4.  Maple Lake exceeds 70 feet in depth in a few locations, but almost 50% of the lake is less than 15 feet.  Much of this shallow water is dominated by extensive beds of aquatic vegetation that provide important spawning and nursery habitat for a variety of fishes.  In addition, emergent aquatic plants protect shorelines and lake bottoms, and are critical to maintenance of good water quality.  Maple Lake in particular, is blessed with two large shallow vegetated bays in the southwestern part of the lake.  Boaters on Maple lake can enjoy a picturesque scene of a shoreline composed of hardwood forests and marshlands, interspersed by cabins and small lake homes.Maple lake is a popular angling lake and should provide fast action for young anglers.  The lake currently supports an abundance of sunfishes, largemouth bass and northern pike.  Although most northern pike and bluegill are of a modest size, being about 1-2 lbs for northerns and 4-7 inches for bluegills, the bass population maintains an abundance of fish greater than 1 lb.  Most of these species can be found associated with the abundant vegetation.  The shallow bays in the southwest area of the lake would be good places to start fishing.  Black crappie are also moderately abundant and provide good fishing opportunities during winter.  Many ice anglers pursue crappie in a 16 ft hole on the west side of the lake along highway 29.  Crappie anglers should be aware that a 10 inch minimum length limit was established on Maple Lake in 1997.  This regulation was designed to increase the size of crappie caught and harvested.  Maple Lake is also well known for its walleyes and was listed as one of Minnesota's top 100 walleye lakes in 1986.  Walleye were moderately abundant in the 2000 survey, but almost half of these were longer than 15 inches.  Walleye anglers should try fishing the rocky point on the northwest side of the lake.Maple lake is managed primarily for bass, sunfish, and crappie with walleye as a species of secondary management importance.  Walleye fingerlings are stocked on an alternate year basis to supplement natural reproduction.  A roughfish barrier was established between Turtle and Maple lakes to reduce immigration of carp.  A fishing pier is to be installed in 2001 at the boat access on the north side of the lake.  This pier is being developed by the DNR in cooperation with the Forada Rod and Gun Club and the Forada Lions Club.  To maintain the excellent bass and panfish populations, maintenance and protection of existing habitat, especially aquatic vegetation, is essential.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Maple Lake is an 815-acre lake located approximately six miles south of Alexandria in Douglas County.  The basin has a maximum depth of 78 feet and average depth of 16 feet.  Due to Maple Lake's irregular shoreline and large bays, approximately half of the lake area is considered to be a littoral zone, which is that area less than 15 feet in depth.  Water quality is very good.  Water clarity has increased to average approximately 15 feet during summer months due to a small watershed area, comparatively low inputs of total phosphorus from runoff, and presence of zebra mussels.  Algal blooms can occur but are temporary and rarely severe.  Bottom soils are largely sand.  Silt and sediment deposits occur in the back of bays.  The lake supports a diversity of submergent plants. Due to clear water, plants have been found growing to a depth of 17 feet.  Yellow water lilies occur in sheltered areas along the western shoreline.  Highly valued hardstem bulrush is largely confined to undeveloped shoreline.  Two improved public access sites are located on north and east shorelines.  A handicapped accessible, floating fishing pier has been installed near the north boat launch for shore-based fishing opportunities.  An experimental harvest regulation for Black Crappie (10-inch minimum with a 5 fish bag) was implemented on Maple Lake in 1997 as part of the Statewide Experimental Regulations Project. <br> \n   <br> \nMaple Lake supports abundant gamefish populations. Bluegill and Black Crappie comprise most of the panfish harvest. Bluegill captured during the survey averaged 6.7 inches and a number of fish over 8 inches were observed.  The largest Bluegill captured was 9.4 inches.  Bluegill are long-lived in Maple Lake, most of the fish over 8 inches were 8 or 9 years old.  Black Crappie catch rates were near average when compared to past surveys, and fish up to 12 inches were observed.  Black Crappie growth rates in Maple Lake appear to be slightly above the statewide average.  They average 10 inches in length at age 4.  The 2016 year class was the strongest year class represented in the survey and many of these crappies should reach 10 inches during the summer of 2020.  Currently, catch rates and size structure are very similar to pre-regulation levels. <br> \n <br> \nThe fish community is top heavy with predators. Small Northern Pike are too abundant. Gill net catches averaged 19.7 pike/net.  Captures ranged from 9.4-32.8 inches but averaged only 17.3 inches. Largemouth Bass are also abundant, but due to limited fertility of the lake and competition with other predators, bass grow slowly.  However, bass are also long lived; multiple Largemouth Bass up to 17 years old were caught during the survey.  A number of these really old bass approached 20 inches in length.  Smallmouth Bass were also observed for the first time in a survey.  Eleven Smallmouth Bass were caught.  The captures ranged from 7.9 to 16.2 inches. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye are stocked to satisfy demand for this popular fishery.  Stocking performance and survival of young Walleye into the population has proven to be inconsistent.  Catch rates of Walleye have declined in recent surveys. Walleye gill net catch rates averaged 4.4 fish/net in 2019.  This catch rate exceeds expectations from similar lakes in Minnesota.  Most of the Walleye caught in the survey were large enough to harvest.  Average length of Walleye captures was 17.8 inches. The largest Walleye caught was 26.0 inches in length. <br> \n   <br> \nHarvest of the surplus of 22.0-inch and smaller pike is encouraged to improve <br> \npredator/prey balance and productivity of the fishery. Yellow Perch, preferred prey for bass, pike, and Walleye, are in short supply. If faced with limited perch, predators may shift their diet to young of other gamefishes or less energy-efficient food sources. Young Walleye are an acceptable alternative for perch.  <br> \n <br> \nMaple Lake was designated as an infested water after the discovery of zebra mussels in 2013.  Recreational users should take necessary precautions to prevent further spread of invasive species.  Drain all water and remove all aquatic vegetation from your boat and trailer when leaving any body of water. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Walleye abundance, as measured by gillnet catches, remains high.  A catch rate of 11.8 fish/gillnet was recorded in 1991.  Catch rates have ranged from 9.3 to 18.8 fish/gillnet in surveys dating back to 1972.  The present catch rate is well above the third quartile of mean catch rates for lakes within lake classification 25 and exceeded the long range goal of 10 fish/net stated in the 1989 lake management plan.  The mean weight of fish captured was 1.34lbs and PSD and RSD-P were 69% and 1%, respectively.  The limited number of stated goal of 20% in the lake management plan. Walleye growth is similar to the mean growth rate of Walleye in area lakes within lake classification 25. Age v fish average 16.4 inches in total length at time of annulus formation.  Age 3 fish comprised 39% (24/62) of the fish captured.  These fish may be the result of natural reproduction since there was no Walleye stocking in 1988.  The strategy of stocking Walleye fingerlings two of every years implemented in 1989 should further assess the extent of natural recruitment.  Northern Pike are abundant in maple lake; gillnet CPUE averaged 15.2 fish/net.  This catch rate exceeds the third quartile of mean catch rates for area lakes within lake classification 25.  The size distribution of the Northern Pike population is poor.  The mean weight of fish captured was 1.5lbs and PSD was measured at 12%. No fish captured exceeded 24.0 inches in total length.  Northern Pike growth is poor after age 3.  Age 5 fish average 20.8 inches in total length at time of annulus formation.  Yellow Perch CPUE has declined from 11.2 fish/gillnet in 1985 to 2.0 and 0.4 fish/gillnet in 1988 and 1991, respectively.  The mean weight of fish captured was 0.10lbs and PSD was measured at 0%.  The high density of predators and abundance of small Bluegills may be limiting Yellow Perch numbers.  Electrofishing yielded 17.33 stock length Largemouth Bass/hour.  Stock CPUE 14.5 and 22.1 Largemouth Bass/hour in 1988 and 1990.  PSD declined from 56% and 40.5% in 1988 and 1990, respectively, to 12% during the 1991 assessment.  No fish captured during three years of electrofishing exceeded 16.0 inches in total length.  Largemouth Bass growth is similar to the mean growth rate for area lakes within lake classification 25.  Age 4 fish average 12.0 inches in length at time of annulus formation. Bluegill are abundant and show characteristics of stunting.  The catch rate averaged 38.7 fish/trapnet in 1991.  The weight of fish captured was 0.11 lbs.  PSD and RSD-P was 30% and 1%, respectively.  Bluegill growth is slower than the mean growth rate for area lakes with lake classification 25.  Age 6 fish average only 5.5 inches in total length at time of annulus formation.  The electrofishing CPUE recorded in 1991 is well below the stated goal of 50 Largemouth Bass/hour. There may be the potential for increasing Largemouth Bass abundance by implementing a special harvest regulation.  A protected slot limit of 12 to 16 inches may increase the density of Largemouth Bass large enough to effectively prey on small Bluegill, this may improve the size structure of the Bluegill population.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Maple Lake is a moderate-sized (815 acres), clear water lake located approximately six miles south of Alexandria in Douglas County.  The basin has a maximum depth of 78 feet and average depth of 16 feet.  Due to Maple Lake's large bays, approximately half of the lake area is considered to be a littoral zone, which is that area less than 15 feet in depth.  Maple Lake becomes thermally stratified during summer months.  Dissolved oxygen concentration can be low enough to limit sustained occupation by game fishes below the thermocline.  Depth to the thermocline can vary from 45 feet in early summer to 25 feet in August. <br> \n <br> \nWater quality is very good.  Water clarity averages 10 feet during summer months due to a small watershed area and comparatively low inputs of total phosphorus from runoff.  Algal blooms can occur but are temporary and rarely severe.   Bottom soils are largely sand.  Silt and sediment deposits occur in the back of bays.  The lake supports a diversity of submergent plants.  Due to clear water, plants have been found growing to a depth of 17 feet.  Yellow water lilies occur in sheltered areas along the western shoreline.  Highly valued hardstem bulrush is largely confined to undeveloped shoreline. <br> \n   <br> \nMaple Lake supports abundant panfish and northern pike populations.  Bluegill sunfishes and black crappies comprise most of the panfish harvest.  Bluegills captured during the study averaged 6.8 inches.  Only five percent of bluegills captured in trap nets were 8.0-inches or larger.  These proved to be old fish. An 8-inch bluegill is 10-years-old.   Black crappie catches were high during the 2013 survey in response to establishment of a very strong year class in 2009.  These four-year-old fish made up 87% of the total crappie caught in trap nets and averaged 9.4 inches during the June survey.  Elevated crappie abundance is also partially attributable to a crappie harvest regulation limiting daily harvest to five fish over 10 inches in total length. <br> \n <br> \nThe fish community is top heavy with predators.  Northern pike are too abundant.  Gillnet catches averaged 20.5 pike/net.  Captures ranged from 11.0 \u0013 30.0 inches and averaged 18.4 inches.  Largemouth bass are less abundant, but due to limited fertility of the lake and stiff competition with other predators, bass grow slowly.  Poor growth diminishes potential fishing quality in terms of size.  The largest bass caught measured 16.9 inches.  Average length of bass captures was 12.6 inches.  Walleyes are stocked to satisfy demand for this popular fishery.  Stocking performance and annual recruitment of young walleyes into the population has proven to be inconsistent.  Catch statistics from the 2013 survey described a good walleye fishery.  Walleye gillnet catches averaged 9.5 fish/net.  This catch rate exceeds expectations from similar lakes in Minnesota.  Average length of walleye captures was 14.0 inches.  Relatively few 20 inch and larger walleye were measured.  The largest walleye caught was 23.0 inches in length.   This fish was estimated to be thirteen-years-old. <br> \n   <br> \nHarvest of the surplus of 21.0-inch and smaller pike would be beneficial to improve predator/prey balance and productivity of the fishery.  Yellow perch, preferred prey for bass, pike, and walleyes, are in short supply.  If faced with limited perch, predators will shift their diet to young of other gamefishes or less energy-efficient food sources.  Young walleye are an acceptable alternative for perch. <br> \n <br> \nNotes: <br> \n <br> \nMaple Lake's clear water, close proximity to Alexandria, Glenwood, and Forada, and extension of central sewer lines around the lake have stimulated accelerated shoreline development and increased recreational use.  Temporary declines in water quality are evident following weekends of heavy boating activity.  Shoreline development has increasingly encroached into shallow bays and along shoreline supporting hardstem bulrush.  Such habitat provides important spawning, nursery, and feeding sites for gamefishes.  Anglers, recreational boaters, and shoreline property owners should be sensitive to cumulative impacts of aquatic resources and endeavor to minimize water quality degradation and habitat fragmentation. <br> \n <br> \nZebra mussels were found in Maple Lake in 2013.  Property owners indicate this undesired invasive has successfully reproduced.  Please drain boats, bait buckets, and other water containers when leaving the lake to reduce the risk of moving zebra mussels and other non-native organisms to uninfested waters. <br> \n <br> \nTwo improved public access sites are located on north and east shorelines.  A handicapped accessible, floating fishing pier has been installed near the north boat launch for shore-based fishing experiences. <br> \n</p>",

These pulses correspond to a fingerling (1982) and a fry stocking (1980). A 1981 token stocking resulted in a very weak year class, suggesting poor natural reproduction. Northern Pike numbers dropped to 8.3 gillnet from 15.83 in the previous survey. However their size is still small with only a 1.25 lb. Average they seem to have the 3 year old burnout syndrome. Bass, Black Crappies and Bluegills are present in adequate numbers and size to provide a good fishery. The sharp increase in the number of bullheads may be attributed to the surface schooling at the time of the survey.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Maple Lake is an 815-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located between Alexandria and Glenwood in west-central Minnesota.  It is connected to lakes Reno and Turtle by non-navigable culverts under State Hwy 29.  Maximum depth is listed as 78 feet, however about 50% of the lake is 15 feet or less. These shallow areas support a diverse aquatic plant community.  Aquatic plants are especially dense in the shallow bays in the southwest portion of the lake.  Large beds of hardstem bulrush are present in shallow, sandy areas.  These aquatic plants provide critical spawning and cover habitat for many fish species.  Aquatic vegetation also helps to maintain water quality by competing with algae for the available nutrients in the lake.Water quality and clarity are excellent on Maple Lake.  Seechi disk transparency usually exceeds 9 feet during the summer months.    The lake has a relatively small watershed.  Surface water inflows are somewhat limited.  Lakeshore residents can help to maintain water quality by limiting alterations to the shoreline and near shore vegetation.  A buffer strip of native vegetation between your yard and the lakeshore can minimize unwanted sediment and nutrients from entering the lake.Maple Lake supports a quality and diverse fish community.  It is known for abundant, but slow growing northern pike, bluegill, and largemouth bass.  Average sizes of these species tend to be small because of the slow growth.  Most of the northern pike sampled in 2003 were 16 to 22 inches in length and average weight was 1.4 pounds.  The mean weight of largemouth bass sampled was 0.8 pounds and few fish were 14 inches or greater.   The present size structure of the bluegill population should provide some quality angling opportunities.  About 80% of the fish captured in trap nets were 6 inches or greater.  Black crappie are also an important component of the fishery in Maple Lake.  Research studies demonstrated that excessive harvest of larger individuals was having a negative effect on size structure.  A 10-inch experimental minimum length limit was imposed in 1997 to reduce this harvest and increase the size structure of the population.  Evaluations are continuing to determine the effectiveness of the experimental regulation.Walleye are also relatively abundant.  Gill net catches averaged about 10 fish/net, which meets the goal stated in the Lake Management Plan.  Mean weight of fish captured was one pound.  Two and three-year-old fish comprised most of the fish captured.  Two-year olds correspond to a year of no stocking and three-year-old fish correspond to a year of fingerling stocking in 2000.  Fingerlings are stocked in even number years to increase walleye abundance.  The effectiveness of fingerling stocking in Maple Lake is unclear.  Natural reproduction or immigration of fish from Lake Reno have likely produced the largest year classes and resulted in the highest gill net catches in recent years.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Walleye net catches indicate a good population dominated by age 3 and 4 fish (1984 and 1985 year-classes). This corresponds favorably with fingerling stockings in those years. Although no stocking occurred in 1986; seven, age 2 walleye were sampled. This may suggest natural reproduction, immigration from Lake Reno, or unauthorized stocking. The 1986 year-class may be underestimated due to gear bias toward larger fish. Success of the 1983 and 1987 fry stockings could not be determined. Subsequent surveys should provide sufficient time and data to better analyze the 1987 fry stocking. Northern Pike remain abundant but average only 1.41 pounds each. Yellow Perch, Centrarchids and various minnow species provide the forage base for predators. Yellow Perch abundance indices are low suggesting they may be preferred forage. Bluegill abundance is high and the mean size is small, suggesting inadequate predation and harvest to provide a desirable population structure. Dense beds of aquatic vegetation, which provide escape cover, and the relative small size of Largemouth Bass present may limit effective predation on intermediate-size Bluegill. Black Crappie were present but probably not adequately sampled to accurately assess population structure.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Maple Lake is a mesotrophic (moderately fertile) basin located in southern Douglas County between Alexandria and Glenwood.  It is connected to lakes Reno and Turtle via non-navigable culverts under State Highway 29.  Maple Lake is moderate in size and relatively shallow.  Maximum depth is 78.0 feet but almost half the basin is less than 15.0 feet deep.  These shallow areas support a diverse aquatic plant community.  Aquatic vegetation is especially dense in the shallow bays in the southwest portion of the lake.  Water quality and clarity are excellent.  Secchi disk readings taken by the Citizen Lakes Monitoring Program typically exceed 8.0 feet during summer months.  Residential development is considered moderate to heavy.  Two public accesses are present.   A public fishing pier is located along the north shore adjacent to the public access and is a popular destination for shore anglers.  Shore anglers also fish along the west shore by the inlet from Lake Reno.  Anglers should note special crappie harvest regulations have been imposed on this basin.  These regulations include a reduced possession limit of five fish and a 10-inch minimum size limit.  All crappie less than 10.0 inches in length must be immediately released.  Purpose of these regulations is to decrease harvest of smaller crappie and improve size structure of this population. <br> \n   <br> \nThe fish community in Maple Lake is typical of most heavily vegetated bass-panfish lakes found in west-central Minnesota.  Largemouth bass, northern pike, bluegill, and crappie are all common.  Largemouth bass and pike populations are dominated by smaller fish.  Mean length in 2009 was 11.7 inches for bass and 18.9 inches for pike.  Like many Minnesota lakes, small \"hammer handle\" pike are a common problem in Maple Lake due to consistent recruitment, slow growth, and limited harvest.  Anglers are encouraged to harvest small pike to reduce abundance, which hopefully will increase growth rates and improve population size structure.  Bluegill and black crappie can be described as moderately abundant.   Size structure of both populations has improved in recent years.  Mean size in 2009 was 6.7 inches and 0.24 pounds for bluegill and 9.9 inches and 0.9 pounds for crappie.  The crappie population provides a very popular fishery for both open-water and ice anglers.  Special crappie regulations are in effect to help maintain and possibly improve this fishery.  A creel survey conducted in 2002-2003 found angler non-compliance regarding the minimum length limit was relatively high.  Potential benefits of special regulations will be undermined if angler non-compliance continues.  <br> \n <br> \nRecord-high walleye abundance was documented in 2009.  Current abundance is much higher than what is expected for this type of lake.  Elevated catches are attributable to successful fingerling and yearling stockings and decreased northern pike abundance in recent years.  Sampled walleye ranged from 7.3 to 26.8 inches in length, but the majority of the population was comprised of younger, smaller fish.  Size structure should improve in the near future as these young fish recruit to the sport fishery.  Yellow perch are typically not targeted by anglers.  Abundance of this species is low and most fish are small. <br> \n     <br> \nOther species collected in the 2009 survey included black, brown, and yellow bullhead, bowfin (dogfish), common carp, hybrid sunfish, pumpkinseed, shorthead redhorse, and white sucker. The next lake survey is scheduled for 2014.  <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

Backpack electrofishing and/or seining were conducted at 14 stations, representing a variety of habitat types, along the shoreline of Maple Lake.  The survey was conducted during the five-year sampling window for intensive monitoring efforts within the Chippewa River watershed, and will be contributing to a watershed assessment process in coordination with Minnesota Pollution Control Agency.\n\nNineteen species were collected during this survey.  Eight species (Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, Logperch, Pugnose Shiner, Mimic Shiner, and Smallmouth Bass) were considered \"intolerant\" and one species (Green Sunfish) was considered \"tolerant\" based on current tolerance classifications for Minnesota lakes.\n\nNearshore catch data will be used along with gill and trap net catch data to develop an Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) score, which is indicative of the health of Maple Lake.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Maple Lake is an 815-acre lake located approximately six miles south of Alexandria in Douglas County.  The basin has a maximum depth of 78 feet and average depth of 16 feet. Due to Maple Lake's irregular shoreline and large bays, approximately half of the lake area is considered to be a littoral zone, which is an area less than 15 feet in depth. Water quality is very good. Water clarity has increased to average approximately 15 feet during summer months due to a small watershed area, comparatively low inputs of total phosphorus from runoff, and presence of zebra mussels. Algal blooms can occur but are temporary and rarely severe. Bottom soils are largely sand. Silt and sediment deposits occur in the back of bays. The lake supports a diversity of submergent plants. Due to clear water, plants have been found growing to a depth of 17 feet. Yellow water lilies occur in sheltered areas along the western shoreline.  Highly valued hardstem bulrush is largely confined to undeveloped shorelines. Two improved public access sites are located on the north and east shorelines. A handicapped accessible, floating fishing pier has been installed near the north boat launch for shore-based fishing opportunities.\n\nAn experimental harvest regulation for Black Crappie (10-inch minimum with a 5 fish bag) was implemented on Maple Lake in 1997 as part of the Statewide Experimental Regulations Project. It has since been converted to a special regulation and is one of the regulatory options in the crappie toolbox for Minnesota. A targeted panfish assessment was conducted in the fall of 2023 in an effort to update information on Black Crappie and Bluegill population attributes. Fall trap netting has been conducted nine times since the fall of 1991 to monitor the size structure of the Black Crappie population. Bluegill were collected in 2019 and 2023 to evaluate size and age structure.\n\nBlack Crappie catch rates were low when compared to past surveys and only a few fish larger than 10 inches were observed. Black Crappie growth rates in Maple Lake are below average compared to other lakes in the Glenwood area and it takes them almost five years to reach 10 inches. Currently, catch rates and size structure are similar to pre-regulation levels.\n\nMaple Lake supports a quality Bluegill fishery.  Catch rates of Bluegill were moderate and fish over 8 inches were observed.  Bluegill growth is slower than many lakes in the Glenwood area, but longevity of these fish results in larger fish being present.  Several large Bluegill approaching 9 inches long were caught during the survey.  These larger fish were 9 to 12 years old.\n\nMaple Lake was designated as an infested water after the discovery of zebra mussels in 2013.  Recreational users should take necessary precautions to prevent further spread of invasive species.  Drain all water and remove all aquatic vegetation from your boat and trailer when leaving any body of water.\n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Maple Lake is an irregularly shaped basin with several large shallow bays.  Submergent vegetation growsto a depth of 19 feet and is dense in the shallow bays.  Hardstem bulrush and floatingleaf pondweed arealso common.  Ample aquatic vegetation and firm substrate provide quality spawning habitat and coverfor centrarchids.  Northern pike are abundant.  Gillnet catches averaged 11.7 fish/net in 1995.  The normal range of meancatch rates from lakes with similar chemical and physical characteristics is 3.1 - 8.5 fish/gillnet. Gillnet catches have ranged from 8.3 - 19.6 fish/net in previous surveys dating back to 1980.  Sizestructure of the northern pike population is poor.  Approximately 25% of the fish were 21.0 inches inlength or greater.  Walleye abundance has declined.  Gillnet catches averaged 2.8 fish/net in 1995,compared to 11.8 fish/gillnet in 1991.  Gillnet catches ranged between 9.5 and 18.8 fish/net inprevious surveys dating back to 1980.  The normal range of mean catch rates from similar lakes is 1.3-5.5 fish/gillnet.  Mean weight of fish captured was 0.9 pounds.  Bluegill catches averaged 39.7fish/trapnet which is within the normal range of mean catch rates from similar lakes (5.6 - 42.3fish/trapnet).  Trapnet catches have ranged from 18.4 to 57.4 fish/net in previous surveys dating backto 1980.  Size structure of the bluegill population is poor.  Only 34% of the fish captured were 6.0inches in length or greater and no fish exceeded 7.5 inches.  Black crappie are not adequately sampledwith standard survey gear during summer months to evaluate population characteristics. An exploitationstudy of black crappie on Maple Lake conducted by research staff suggests a moderate population densitywith few fish over 12.0 inches in total length.  Largemouth bass were not sampled with electrofishingin 1995.  An electrofishing survey in 1994 indicated an abundant population with a slow growth rate andpoor size structure.  Catch rate averaged 78.0 stock-size largemouth bass per hour.  Yellow perchcatches averaged 2.4 fish/gillnet.  Gillnet catches ranged from 0.6 to 8.0 fish/net in previous surveysdating back to 1980.  Most of the fish captured were 5.0 - 8.0 inches in total length.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Maple Lake is an 815-acre lake located approximately six miles south of Alexandria in Douglas County.  The basin has a maximum depth of 78 feet and average depth of 16 feet.  Due to Maple Lake's irregular shoreline and large bays, approximately half of the lake area is considered to be a littoral zone, which is that area less than 15 feet in depth.  Water quality is very good.  Water clarity has increased to average approximately 15 feet during summer months due to a small watershed area, comparatively low inputs of total phosphorus from runoff, and presence of zebra mussels.  Algal blooms can occur but are temporary and rarely severe.  Bottom soils are largely sand.  Silt and sediment deposits occur in the back of bays.  The lake supports a diversity of submergent plants. Due to clear water, plants have been found growing to a depth of 17 feet.  Yellow water lilies occur in sheltered areas along the western shoreline.  Highly valued hardstem bulrush is largely confined to undeveloped shoreline.  Two improved public access sites are located on north and east shorelines.  A handicapped accessible, floating fishing pier has been installed near the north boat launch for shore-based fishing opportunities. <br> \n <br> \nAn experimental harvest regulation for Black Crappie (10-inch minimum with a 5 fish bag) was implemented on Maple Lake in 1997 as part of the Statewide Experimental Regulations Project.  A targeted panfish assessment was conducted in the fall of 2019 in efforts to increase sample sizes and accuracy of Black Crappie and Bluegill population attributes.  Fall trap netting has been conducted eight times since the fall of 1991 to monitor the size structure of the Black Crappie population.  Bluegill were also collected in 2019 to evaluate size and age structure. <br> \n   <br> \nBlack Crappie catch rates were near average when compared to past surveys, but only a few fish larger than 10 inches were observed.  Black Crappie growth rates in Maple Lake appear to be slightly above the statewide average.  Older captures approached 10 inches at age 4.  The 2016 year class was the strongest year class represented in the survey.   Many of these crappies should reach 10 inches during the summer of 2020.  Currently, catch rates and size structure are very similar to pre-regulation levels. <br> \n <br> \nMaple Lake supports a quality Bluegill fishery.  Catch rates of Bluegill were moderate and many fish over 8 inches were observed.  Bluegill growth is slower than desired, but longevity of these fish resulted in larger fish being present in the system.  Several large Bluegill around 9 inches long were caught during the survey.  These larger fish were 8 to 9 years old. <br> \n <br> \nMaple Lake was designated as an infested water after the discovery of zebra mussels in 2013.  Recreational users should take necessary precautions to prevent further spread of invasive species.  Drain all water and remove all aquatic vegetation from your boat and trailer when leaving any body of water. <br> \n</p>",
