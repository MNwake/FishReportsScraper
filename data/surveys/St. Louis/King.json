Stewart has difficult access from the Rossini Trail across a minimum maintenance road to the south side of the lake.  Maximum depth is 8 feet and 99% of the lake is shallower than 15 feet.     Walleye abundance indexed with assessment nets was 7.5 per lift in 1997.  This index value was above average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Fifty eight percent of the walleye sampled in the 1997 survey were longer than 15 inches and the mean length was 14.8 inches.  Growth rates were fast with walleye reaching 16.3 inches at age IV.     Northern pike abundance index of 12.5 per lift was also high compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Size structure was good with 63% of sampled pike longer than 21 inches and a mean length of 21.9 inches.  Northern pike length at age IV of 20.1 inches was fast compared to other populations sampled in the Duluth Area.     Yellow perch abundance index of 7.5 per lift was average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Size structure was poor with only 18% of sampled perch longer than 8 inches and a mean length of 7.0 inches.     Other fish species sampled during the 1997 survey include largemouth bass, pumpkinseed sunfish, white sucker, rockbass, blacknose shiner, emerald shiner, spottail shiner, common shiner, Iowa darter and johnny darter.</p>",
