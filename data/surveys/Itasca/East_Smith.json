                "narrative": "<p>East Smith Lake is a 145 acre lake located five miles southeast of Marcell, MN in the Big Fork River watershed.  The lake is in ecological lake class 32.  Lakes in this class are small, have moderate clarity and depth, and relatively soft water.  Other area lakes in this class include Big Ole, Black Island and Highland Lakes. <br> \n <br> \nThe northern pike gill-net catch in 2009 was similar to the previous survey and within the expected range at 4.7/net.  Size structure was fairly poor; sampled pike had a mean length of 19.1 inches and a mean weight of 1.9 pounds.  Few pike over 25 inches have been sampled in previous surveys, although one large (36.8 inch) northern pike was captured in this assessment.  Recruitment appeared fairly consistent, with ages 1 - 5 represented in the sample.  Growth was similar to the lake class average for all ages, with individuals reaching 19.8 inches in 4 years. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill were the most abundant species in the trap nets, with a catch rate of 8.0/net.  This is down from the previous survey and below the lake class first quartile.  Bluegill size structure was modest; fish ranged from 3.5 to 9.0 inches with a mean length of 7.0 inches.  Recruitment appeared consistent, with ages 3, 4, and 6 - 11 represented in the sample.  Growth rates were similar to the lake class average for all ages, with individuals reaching 6.4 inches in 7 years. <br> \n <br> \nThe trap-net catch for black crappie was up from the previous assessment and near the lake class third quartile at 3.4/net.  Sampled crappie ranged from 6.2 to 11.6 inches with a mean length of 9.3 inches.  Ages 3 - 10 were represented in the sample and growth was below 85% of the statewide average for all ages, with individuals reaching 8.9 inches in 6 years. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch were sampled at a rate of 1.3/gill net, down from the previous assessment but within the expected range for this lake class.  Largemouth bass were sampled at 0.7/gill net, up from the previous survey and within the expected range.  Angler reports suggest the lake supports a fairly good bass population.  Electrofishing would likely provide better information on this species. <br> \n</p>",
