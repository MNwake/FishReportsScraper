                "narrative": "<p>Portsmouth Mine Pit Lake is a former open pit iron mine located north of Crosby that has filled with water.  Portsmouth is a designated stream trout lake.  Designated stream trout lakes have additional angling regulations.  Be sure to consult the current Minnesota Fishing Regulations book for regulations, seasons, and possession limits before fishing designated trout streams or lakes.   <br> \n <br> \nPortsmouth Mine Pit Lake is one of the larger pit lakes in the Cuyuna Range at 146 acres.  The maximum depth is nearly 400 ft and the water is very clear with visibility to a depth of nearly 30 ft.  A concrete boat launch is located on the west end of the lake, on the east side of County Rd. 30.  Portsmouth is within the Cuyuna Country State Recreation Area and the Cuyuna Lakes State Trail runs along the south shore of the lake.  A DNR campground is located north of the public boat access.   <br> \n <br> \nA survey of the fish community and aquatic habitat in Portsmouth Mine Pit Lake was conducted in July 2010.  The fish community was assessed with 6 gill nets and 9 trap nets.  The total catch in the gill nets was fairly low at 10.5 fish per set, but this was comparable to other Cuyuna mine pit lakes where average gill net catches have ranged from 2 to 63 total fish in recent surveys.  Rock bass were the most common fish in the gill nets with an average catch of 3.7 fish per net.  Three rainbow trout were captured (0.5 per gill net).  The rainbow trout measured 11.9 to 12.5 inches long and were all age-1 fish from the April 8, 2010 stocking of 11,000 yearlings.  The rainbow trout had shown some growth from stocking; the average weight at stocking was 0.3 lbs, while the average weight of the trout caught in the July survey was 0.5 lbs.  The northern pike gill net catch was only 1.3 per set, but they comprised much of the gill net biomass with a mean weight of 8.4 lbs per fish.  Northern pike captured in the gill nets ranged in length from 25.6 to 39.4 inches.  Three of the eight northern pike captured in the gill nets had a rainbow trout in their stomachs.  Growth of northern pike was normal through age three, then growth was above normal with fish achieving 30 inches by age 6.   <br> \n <br> \nBluegills were the most common fish in the trap nets with 44 per set.  Most bluegills were from 4 to 7 inches long.  Growth of bluegills was normal compared to other simlar lakes.  Rock bass were the second most abundant species in the trap nets at 6 per net.  Catch of other species was fewer than 2 fish per trap net.   <br> \n <br> \nTemperature and oxygen conditions suitable for trout occurred from a depth of 21 ft down to at least 66 ft in late July.  The water chemistry had low phosphorus and chlorophyll, but had fairly high ionic strength and alkalinity.   <br> \n <br> \nNear shore substrates were primarily sand with some gravel and cobble.  Aquatic vegetation was found primarily in several small bays and the shallow west end of the lake.  Submerged trees which extend nearly to the surface are common in areas of medium depth - about 10 to 30 ft deep.   <br> \n <br> \nRainbow trout were first stocked in 1972 with various stockings of yearlings and fingerling rainbow trout through the 1980's.  About 11,000 rainbow trout yearlings have been stocked annually since 1990.  Starting in 2011 Portsmouth is scheduled to receive 7,000 rainbow trout yearlings annually.  Brook trout have also been occasionally stocked in Portsmouth, most recently in 2002, 2004, and 2008.   <br> \n</p>",

Temperature and oxygen conditions suitable for trout occurred from a depth of about 20' down to around 70' in July.   Rainbow Trout are stocked annual as yearlings (7,000/year) into Portsmouth.  Rainbow Trout provide for a popular fishery, especially early in the season.  Rainbow Trout were sampled at 0.8/gill net, with an average length of 12.4\". <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike was sampled in low numbers, when compared to similar lakes, at 1.3/gill net.  Average length was 20.6\" with 13% in the protected 22\"-26\" slot; 25% were at least 26.0\" or larger. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass were sampled in high numbers at 2.2/gill net.  Average length was 12.2\", with fish up to 18.7\" sampled.  Bluegills were sampled in low numbers at 7.1/trap net.  Most ran on the small side with an average length of 5.0\", with 13% at least 7.0\" in length. <br> \n <br> \nPortsmouth is a designated stream trout lake.  Designated stream trout lakes have additional angling regulations.  Be sure to consult the current Minnesota Fishing Regulations book for regulations, seasons, and possession limits before fishing designated trout waters. <br> \n   <br> \nNo invasive species have been found in Portsmouth but are in the area.  Before and after launching lake users are required to inspect and remove any aquatic plants and animals from their watercraft and trailers as well as pull the plug and drain all water from the watercraft, including bilges, livewells and baitwells. <br> \n</p>",
