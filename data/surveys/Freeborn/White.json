                "narrative": "<p>White Lake, also known as Lake Chapeau, is a 168 acre lake located in Freeborn County near the town of Albert Lea. It has a maximum depth of 5 feet, with the entire surface area classified as littoral. Very little is known about the lake to this point and it has not been managed by DNR Fisheries due to a lack of public access. However, its connection to downstream lakes and as a potential Common Carp source makes it worth assessing as part of a larger watershed-scale management strategy. Rotenone reclamation was presented in 2010 as a tool to improve water quality and habitat but was met with opposition from public stakeholders. Previous data from White Lake were limited to a Special Assessment in 2010 using one gill net and 4 nonstandard trap nets. Regular dissolved oxygen monitoring has not taken place on White Lake, but winterkill events have likely occurred concurrently with other shallow lakes in the area. White Lake was surveyed the week of July 6, 2015 to establish a fisheries management plan with the hope that a public access will eventually be built on the lake. The fish community was assessed using one gill net and nine trap nets and water quality was recorded using secchi depth, dissolved oxygen, and temperature measurements. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch <br> \nA total of 13 Yellow Perch were sampled with the gill net for a catch rate of 13.0/net. This represents a drastic decline from the 2010 catch rate of 260/net. Lengths ranged from 7.1 to 8.3 inches with an average of 7.7 inches. Another 11 Yellow Perch ranging from 5.5 to 8.0 inches were sampled with trap nets. Fish from both gears were 1 or 2 years old, with 1 year old fish comprising over 91% of the sample. The drastic drop in catch rate from 2010 to 2015 and the young age of fish in the sample suggest that the population has experienced a significant mortality event in the recent past, most likely a winterkill in 2013-2014. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Bullhead <br> \nA total of 638 Black Bullheads ranging from 3.8 to 11.1 inches long were sampled with trap nets for a catch rate of 70.9/net. This represents an increase in abundance since the 2010 assessment that sampled 23.0/net, providing further proof that the lake most likely winterkilled between 2010 and 2015. An additional 10 Black Bullheads were sampled with the gill net. Given the shallow and winterkill-prone nature of White Lake, Black Bullheads are likely to remain a substantial member of a simple fish community. <br> \n <br> \nOther Species <br> \nOther species sampled in 2015 include Fathead Minnow, Goldfish, Green Sunfish, and hybrid sunfish. Green Sunfish were the most commonly sampled fish, with 133 sampled with the gill net and over 94 sampled per trap net. A fish barrier now exists between White Lake and Fountain Lake, which coupled with a likely winterkill in 2013-2014, may explain the absence of species that were sampled in 2010 including Black Crappie, Common Carp, Largemouth Bass, and White Sucker. <br> \n <br> \nWater Quality Parameters <br> \nWater quality parameter measurements included secchi depth, water temperature, and dissolved oxygen readings. At the time of this survey, secchi depth was 3 feet, indicating low water clarity. Water temperatures and dissolved oxygen readings throughout the water column ranged from 72.3 degrees Fahrenheit and 8.1 ppm at the surface to 71.8 degrees Fahrenheit and 7.8 ppm at 5 feet. Water quality in 2010 was described as being in a bright green and hypereutrophic state and aquatic plants were rarely observed. In 2015 however, the water was described as brown in color and aquatic plants, specifically Sago Pondweed and Chara, were noted as being commonly observed throughout the lake. This change can be attributed most likely to the absence of Common Carp due to a recent winterkill. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers can play an important role in maintaining or improving a fish population by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for consumption, while encouraging the release of medium to large fish that may contribute to natural recruitment.  This practice helps maintain balance in the fish community and provides anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future.  Additionally, smaller fish often taste better and have fewer contaminants than larger, older fish from the same water body. <br> \n <br> \nShoreline property owners also play an important role in the overall health of an aquatic ecosystem, including the fish population.  Natural shorelines, including vegetation, woody debris, and bottom substrates, provide valuable habitat for fish and wildlife, help maintain water quality, and reduce bank erosion.  By leaving natural shorelines unaltered or restoring them to natural conditions, shoreline property owners are doing their part to maintain or improve a healthy ecosystem in the lake and protect the resource for future generations. <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n-Sky Wigen, Fisheries Specialist  <br> \n</p>",
