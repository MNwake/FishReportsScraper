A nearshore survey was conducted to assess the populations of both game and non-game fish species.  Ten 100' long sampling stations were evenly spaced around the lakeshore.  Each station was then sampled by backpack electrofishing, and if conditions allowed with a 15' or 50' 1/8th inch seine. <br> \n <br> \nThe survey took place August 2-3, 2023, with all 10 stations sampled by backpack electrofishing.  The 50' 1/8th inch seine was used at 2 stations and the 15' 1/8th inch seine was used at 5 stations.  Eleven species were sampled, including two species that are intolerant of habitat disturbance: Blackchin Shiner and Blacknose Shiner. This nearshore survey was used along with the gill net and trap net survey collected the same week to calculate a Fish-Based Index of Biotic Integrity (FIBI) score.  The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health by the types of fish species present and comparing it to what is expected for this type of lake.   <br> \n</p>",

It is accessible through a man-made, 1,800 foot long, channel on the NE end of Partridge Lake. <br> \n <br> \nThe best fishing option appears to be Northern Pike which were caught in high numbers (13.0/gill net).  While average size wasn't that amazing (21.2\"), the higher numbers as well as 15% of the fish measuring over 30\" could offer some excitement.  Largemouth Bass electrofishing was not done in 2023, but enough fish were caught in nets to suggest that they could offer anglers an opportunity to catch some fish.  Bass up to 15.3\" were captured. <br> \n <br> \nPanfish abundance and size were relatively low.  Black Crappie numbers were average (2.8/gill net) and 44% of the fish were at least 8\".  The largest Crappie was 9.5\".  Bluegill numbers were low for this type of lake (7.7/trap net) and size was very small.  Only one fish was over 7\" and average length was 4.6.\"  <br> \n</p>",
