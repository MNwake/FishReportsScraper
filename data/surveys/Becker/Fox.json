Growth is relatively fast (greater than 120 percent of state avg. for most age groups).  Only age groups III through V were caught.  Are older fish being harvested or dying naturally?  Largemouth bass and black crappie are present in slightly above-average numbers with good growth.  Yellow perch have declined significantly in the 80's and are presently about one fifth of the local median abundance.  Walleye population remains slightly above average in number and is dominated by the 1985 year class-a stocking year.  Growth is normal, but bordering on slow.  White sucker abundance is several times local median.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Fox Lake is a 135 acre, heavily-developed lake.  The number of shoreline homes or cottages nearly doubled from 24 in 1966 to 46 in 1984.  Fishing pressure has undoubtedly increased, as well, even though the \"public access\" is unimproved, unmarked, and unused with no suitable parking area.  It's small size and heavy development would appear to make the fish populations in Fox Lake vulnerable to over exploitation.     Increased fishing pressure is only one of many factors affecting the fish community in Fox Lake.  Weather patterns and water levels affect spawning success for most species.  Vegetation removal can disrupt spawning, feeding, and shelter use for several fish species; crews observed destruction of bulrush beds in front of two relatively new homes.  Fish stocking can impact (sometimes negatively) the entire fish community in a lake, not just the species being stocked.  Shoreline erosion, nutrient input, and hazardous chemical introductions can all detrimentally impact fish habitat, spawning success, and fish abundance.  In spite of all these impacts on a fishery, fish populations attempt to maintain themselves by through reproduction.  Thus, the dominance of small individuals of a particular fish species is often a good indicator of over harvest (or another stressor).     The average and maximum sizes of both northern pike and bluegill are decreasing in Fox Lake.  Since growth rates have not changed significantly in the recent past, it is likely that pike and bluegill are being \"cropped off\" about the same time they become large enough to keep.  While the average walleye is also small (13.9 inches long) and relatively abundant (12.0 per net), Fox Lake walleye are not significantly smaller now than in 1978.  Only the initial sample in 1966, when there were fewer walleye (3.7 per net), contained walleye of significantly larger size.     In general, the abundances of northern pike, yellow perch, bluegill, and largemouth bass in Fox Lake are within the \"normal\" ranges for similar lakes.  Walleye and white sucker are more abundant than normal and black crappie and yellow bullhead are  less abundant than normal.  Other species sampled include black bullhead, hybrid sunfish, pumpkinseed sunfish, and rock bass.     Natural fluctuations in Fox Lake's fish populations are inevitable.  However, there are several things that watershed dwellers and lake users can do to help maintain a viable fishery.  Fish habitat is more than just water; it includes both quantity  and quality of water, bottom substrate, and fish cover such as vegetation.  One can maintain the integrity of the lake and it's fish populations by protecting bullrush and cattail stands, preventing erosion, preventing nutrient input caused by lawn fertilization and faulty septic systems, and self regulation of fish harvest by catching and properly releasing a portion of the \"keepers\" one might normally kill and eat.</p>",

There are no inlets, but an outlet to Lake Sallie is present on the south shore.Shoal water soils consist of 60% rubble, 20% gravel, 15% clay and 5% sand.Submerged and emergent aquatic vegetation was abundant in the bays and scattered elsewhere.Test net catches indicated the presence of high populations of small sized largemouth bass and bluegills, good populations of white suckers, bullheads and rock bass, and fair to good populations of northern pike and walleyes.  Although few crappies were taken in the test nets, local residents reported some occasional good fishing for them.  Fishing in general reportedly has been fair in past years.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Fox Lake is a small, heavily-developed lake.  The number of shoreline homes or cottages more than double from 24 in 1966 to 55 in 1999.  Fishing pressure has likely increased, as well, and the fish community is showing signs of over fishing.With a few exceptions, fish numbers remain much as they were forty years ago.  Northern pike, bluegills, and largemouth bass test net catches remained high in Fox Lake.  With fingerling stocking, walleye catches are actually three times as high as they were in 1966 and much above average compared to other similar lakes.Average sizes of the more popular fish species in the community were down.  Bluegills and walleyes, especially, showed evidence that larger fish are being harvested by anglers as soon as they reach \"keeper\" sizes.  Since it takes bluegills in Fox Lake about seven years to reach seven inches in length, these fish are not quickly replaced and few (less than 1%) survive to reach eight inches.  In the 1960s and 1970s, about 10% of sampled bluegills were 8.0 inches or longer.  The good news is that a few larger bluegills and northern pike are still present.This phenomenon is not unique to Fox Lake but will soon require some tough choices (bigger or more fish?, more or fewer regulations?) for Minnesota's anglers.  It is a testament to nature's resilience that fish populations have maintained themselves as well as they have despite increasing demand and decreasing habitat.Even though several indicators of water quality show that Fox Lake's is relatively good, there are things riparian owners and other watershed dwellers can do to help sustain quality water, fish populations, and property values.  Some of these include: (1) exceeding shoreline setbacks for buildings and septic systems, (2) not fertilizing lawns or using phosphorus free fertilizers, (3) leaving wide shoreline buffer zones of unmowed, natural vegetation, (4) leaving as much aquatic vegetation (especially bulrushes and cattails) intact as possible when obtaining access to open water, (5) actively participating in the lake association, (6) following practices illustrated in the DNR document \"Lakescaping for Wildlife and Water Quality\" when landscaping shoreline property, and (7) voluntarily releasing larger fish and keeping smaller ones for eating.</p>",
