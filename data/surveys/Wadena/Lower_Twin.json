                "narrative": "<p>Lower (South) Twin is located in northern Wadena County, just south of the Hubbard County line.  Lower Twin has a surface area of 391 acres and a maximum depth of 26 feet.  A public access is located on the channel (Shell River) connecting Upper and Lower Twin Lakes.  The Shell River flows thru Upper Twin and Lower Twin Lakes and eventually into the Crow Wing River.  Lower Twin is a popular fishing lake and receives moderate to heavy fishing pressure for northern pike, walleye, and panfish.  Lower Twin receives some of the heaviest winter ice fishing pressure for this area.The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical and chemical characteristics.  Lower Twin is in lake class 31.  Other area lakes in this same classification include: Boulder, 2nd-5th-6ht-7th and 8th Crow Wing Lakes, Duck, Evergreen, Hattie, Hinds, Shingobee, and Tripp.Walleye abundance was up, with the gillnet catch rate of 5.8 walleye/net the highest recorded for all surveys on Lower Twin.  Walleye abundance in past surveys has been very stable, generally around the current management goal of 2.2 walleye/gillnet.  Lower Twin has a reputation as more of a numbers than size lake when it comes to walleye fishing.  Average size of walleye was 15.8 inches and 1.5 pounds, with fish measured up to 25.2 inches.  Yellow perch are abundant in lower Twin and provide a plentiful forage base for the walleye population.  The walleye population in Upper and Lower Twin Lakes has benefited from an aggressive walleye fingerling stocking program by the DNR.  Upper and Lower Twin are heavily stocked with walleye fingerlings during even numbered years.  The walleye population in Lower Twin is being maintained by a combination of fingerling stocking and natural reproduction.  Upstream and downstream migration of walleye is possible as well as natural reproduction in the river areas.Anglers can expect to find lots of small, \"hammer handle\" northern pike in Lower Twin.  Abundant northern pike spawning habitat of shallow, submerged and emergent aquatic vegetation results in excellent reproduction and recruitment of northern pike in Lower Twin.  Sampled northern pike had an average length and weight of 19.7 inches and 1.6 pounds, with fish measured up to 31.1 inches.  Lower Twin is capable of producing some larger pike, as there is an abundant forage base of white sucker and shorthead redhorse in the lake. Panfish are a popular choice year-around on Lower Twin.  Anglers will find good numbers of bluegill in the 6-8 inch size range.  Black crappie are present in low to moderate numbers in Lower Twin.Lower Twin has both a largemouth bass and smallmouth bass population.  Largemouth bass are found in low to moderate numbers when compared to other area lakes.  Smallmouth bass are found in low numbers and seem to concentrated in the inlet and outlet areas.White sucker and shorthead redhorse are abundant in Lower Twin, and anglers looking to pursue these species will find high numbers of these species in the inlet and outlet areas.</p>",

Lower Twin is separated from Upper Twin by a small segment of the Shell River, which runs through both lakes and is navigable by boat.  Lower Twin has a surface area of 252 acres with a maximum depth of 26 feet. A DNR public access is located on the Shell River, off of County Road 21 which runs between Upper and Lower Twin.  Upper and Lower Twin Lakes provides multi species opportunities to the angler, with good populations of walleye, northern pike, perch and panfish. <br> \n <br> \nThe Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics. Lower Twin is in Lake Class 31. Class 31 lakes generally have very hard water, with regularly shaped shoreline. Other class 31 lakes in the Park Rapids area include: Second, Fifth, Sixth, Seventh and Eighth Crow Wing, Boulder, Duck, Evergreen, Hattie, Hinds, Shingobee and Trip. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye populations were very good with most walleyes sampled in the 12 to 20 inch range and a few larger fish.  Lower Twin is currently stocked with walleye fry every spring to sustain its walleye populations.  Yellow perch are an important forage species for walleyes and northern pike in Lower Twin.  Yellow perch were sampled in very high numbers but were generally small in size, with very few perch of an acceptable size for angling.  Anglers can expect to find an abundant population of northern pike in Lower Twin. Sampled northern pike had an average length and weight of 21 inches and 2.1 pounds with northern pike up to 34 inches sampled.  Angling opportunities for bluegill and black crappie appears to be good. Anglers can expect to find a fair number of bluegill, and a good number of black crappies.  Bluegills are typically in the 5.5-9 inch range, while most black crappies are in the 8.5-13 inch range.  Over the years, several smallmouth bass and muskellunge have been observed, both with good size.   <br> \n <br> \nCurrently faucet snails and curly leaf pondweed, both aquatic invasive species (AIS), have been identified in Lower Twin. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lower Twin Lake is located in northern Wadena County, just south of the Hubbard County Line.   Lower Twin has a surface area of 252 acres and a maximum depth of 26 feet.  A state-owned public access is located on the channel (Shell River) connecting Upper and Lower Twin Lakes.  The Shell River flows through Upper and Lower Twin Lakes and eventually into the Crow Wing River.  Lower Twin is a popular fishing lake and receives moderate to heavy fishing pressure year around.  Lower Twin provides multi-species opportunities for anglers, with good populations of Walleye, Northern Pike, and panfish. <br> \n <br> \nThe Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics.  Class 31 lakes generally have very hard water and a regularly shaped shoreline.  Other class 31 lakes in the Park Rapids management area include: Second, Fifth, Sixth, Seventh, and Eighth Crow Wing Lakes, Boulder, Duck, Evergreen, Hattie, Hinds, and Tripp. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance has remained steady the past several surveys on Lower Twin.  Eleven year classes of Walleye were sampled and ranged in size from 7.9 to 30.0 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch, an important forage species for Walleye, were sampled in high numbers, similar to past surveys.  Yellow Perch were small in size and generally not an acceptable size for angling.  Yellow Perch up to 8.6 inches were sampled. <br> \n <br> \nPast surveys have shown the Northern Pike population to fluctuate from moderate to high numbers.  Northern Pike abundance was lower this survey, but quality sized fish were sampled.   Northern Pike had an average length of 24.3 inches and weighed 3.7 pounds with fish measured up to 40.9 inches. <br> \n <br> \nPanfish are a popular choice year-round on Lower Twin.   Anglers will find Bluegill and Pumpkinseed in the 7-8 inch size range and Black Crappie in the 9-10 inch size range.  Past surveys have shown Black Crappie to fluctuate from low to moderate numbers. <br> \n <br> \nLower Twin has both Largemouth and Smallmouth Bass populations.  Present and past surveys have shown low to moderate Largemouth Bass populations compared to other area lakes.  Smallmouth Bass were not sampled in 2023, but have been sampled in low numbers in past surveys. <br> \n <br> \nLower Twin has an abundant White Sucker and Redhorse population.  Anglers pursuing these species will find high numbers in the inlet and outlet areas. <br> \n <br> \nCurrently faucet snails and curly leaf pondweed, both aquatic invasive species (AIS), have been identified in Lower Twin.  To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lower (South) Twin Lake is located in northern Wadena County, just south of the Hubbard County line.  Lower Twin has a surface area of 391 acres and a maximum depth of 26 feet.  A public access is located on the channel (Shell River) connecting Upper and Lower Twin Lakes.  The Shell River flows through Upper and Lower Twin Lakes and eventually into the Crow Wing River.  Lower Twin is a popular fishing lake and receives moderate to heavy fishing pressure year around for this area.  Lower Twin provides angling opportunities for northern pike, walleye, panfish, and bass. <br> \n <br> \nThe Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics.  Lower Twin is in lake class 31.  Other area lakes in this same classification include: Boulder, 2nd-5th-6th-7th and 8th Crow Wing Lakes, Duck, Evergreen, Hattie, Hinds, Shingobee, and Tripp. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance (2.8 walleye/gillnet) was near the current management goal of 2.2 walleye/gillnet.  Walleye abundance was higher in 2003 (5.8 walleye/gillnet), while earlier surveys had walleye gillnet catch rates near the management goal.  Sampled walleye had an average length and weight of 17.2 inches and 2.1 pounds with fish measured up to 27.0 inches.  Yellow perch are abundant in Lower Twin and provide a plentiful forage base for the walleye population.  Lower Twin is stocked annually with walleye fry in the spring. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike abundance (4.3 pike/gillnet) was down from previous surveys, but still within the range \"typical\" for this lake class.  Historical surveys have shown that the northern pike population in Lower Twin fluctuates from moderate to high numbers.  Abundant northern pike spawning habitat of shallow, submerged and emergent vegetation results in excellent reproduction and recruitment of northern pike in Lower Twin.  Sampled northern pike had an average length and weight of 21.0 inches and 2.1 pounds, with pike measured up to 34.7 inches.  Lower Twin is capable of producing some larger pike, as there is and abundant supply of white sucker and shorthead redhorse in the lake.  Anglers might find an occasional muskellunge as two muskies were sampled in the survey. <br> \n <br> \nPanfish are a popular choice year-around on Lower Twin.  Anglers will find bluegill in the 6-8 inch size range.  Black crappie are present in low to moderate numbers in Lower Twin. <br> \n <br> \nLower Twin has both a largemouth bass and smallmouth bass population.  Present and past surveys have shown low to moderate largemouth bass numbers when compared to other area lakes.  Smallmouth bass are found in lower numbers and seem to be concentrated in the inlet and outlet areas. <br> \n <br> \nLower Twin supports an abundant white sucker and shorthead redhorse population.  Anglers pursuing these species will find high numbers in the inlet and outlet areas.  Lower Twin is one of the few lakes in this area that supports a carp population and provides limited opportunities for angling and bow fishing.  Carp are found in very low numbers in Lower Twin. <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of nearshore fish species in Lower Twin Lake was conducted on July 19-21, 2021, by Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program staff. Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake, and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at all 10 sampling stations, but three stations were sampled from the boat due to site conditions. Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample three stations, a 15-foot seine was used to sample four stations, and site conditions prevented the use of a seine at three stations. Nearshore sampling captured 17 species of fish including seven species that are intolerant of disturbance (i.e., Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Iowa Darter, Logperch, Mimic Shiner, Rock Bass, and Smallmouth Bass) and none that are tolerant of disturbance. <br> \n <br> \nA concurrent summer trap net survey was also conducted by IBI Program staff. Nine trap nets were set along the shoreline in locations that encompassed multiple habitat types. Trap net sampling captured 17 species of fish, including two that are intolerant of disturbance (i.e., Greater Redhorse and Rock Bass). Bluegill and Pumpkinseed comprised a majority of the catch by number, whereas Bowfin, Northern Pike, Silver Redhorse, and River Redhorse comprised a majority by biomass. <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore and trap net data were combined with gill net data from July 2018 survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based IBI (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment. In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g., Blackchin Shiner, Iowa Darter, and Rock Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g., Green Sunfish). The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.  <br> \n <br> \nResults from this survey indicate that the fish community in Lower Twin Lake is healthy as indicated by an FIBI score that exceeds the exceptional use threshold determined for similar lakes. These results will be considered when the biological health of the lake is assessed during the Crow Wing River Watershed assessment process, which will be completed in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lower (South) Twin Lake is located in northern Wadena County, just south of the Hubbard County Line.  Lower Twin has a surface area of 391 acres and a maximum depth of 26 feet.  A public access is located on the channel (Shell River) connecting Upper and Lower Twin Lakes.  The Shell River flows thru Upper Twin and Lower Twin Lakes, and eventually into the Crow Wing River.  The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical and chemical characteristics.  Lower Twin is in lake class 31.  Other area lakes in this same classification include: Duck, Hinds, and Crow Wing Lakes (2nd, and 5th thru 8th).  Lower Twin is a very popular fishing lake and receives moderate to heavy fishing pressure for northern pike, walleye and panfish.  Lower Twin receives some of the heaviest winter ice fishing pressure for this area.  Walleye were sampled in moderate numbers (2.3/gillnet), similar to past surveys and within the \"normal range\" for this lake class.  The management goal for walleye on Lower Twin is 3.0/gillnet.  Lower Twin has a reputation as more of a numbers than size lake when it comes to walleye fishing.  Average size of walleye was 14.9 inches and 1.5 pounds.  Larger fish are present, however, with walleye sampled up to 27.0 inches.  Walleye growth rates were similar to other area lakes in this class.  Yellow perch are abundant in Lower Twin and provide a plentiful forage base for walleye and northern pike.  The walleye population in Lower Twin is maintained through fingerling stockings in even years.  While natural reproduction and migration of walleye from the Shell River is occurring, 91% of the walleye sample (21 fish) were from stocked years.   Northern pike were abundant (11.5/gillnet), above the \"normal range\" for this lake class. Northern pike abundance in past surveys has fluctuated from low to high numbers.  While northern pike were abundant, average size of fish was small (18.4 inches & 1.3 pounds).  The largest northern pike sampled was 23.2 inches.  Growth of northern pike was slow when compared to other lakes in this class.  Past surveys have shown that average size of northern pike is larger when abundance is low.With the Shell River flowing through Lower Twin, some interesting catches have occurred in the gillnets.  One 23.4 inch muskellunge was sampled as well as two brown trout measuring 24.4 and 25.0 inches.  This was the first confirmed muskellunge sampled on Lower Twin.  The muskellunge was probably an escapee from the Park Rapids rearing ponds located upstream on the Fish Hook River.  Brown trout are likely migrants from the Straight River located upstream. Three brown trout were also sampled in the 1993 survey, as well as reports of visual sightings of brown trout from dark house anglers. Both the Straight and Fish Hook River flow into the Shell River. Panfishing is popular on Lower Twin.  Bluegill abundance (7.0/net) was down from the 1993 survey, but still within the \"normal range\" for this lake class.  Bluegill up to 8.7 inches were sampled, however, average size was small (3.6 inches).  Only 6% of the bluegill sampled  were over 6.0 inches long.  A strong year class of 4.0 inch bluegill were sampled, and in two to three years should provide some good fishing.  Black crappie and largemouth bass were sampled in low numbers, similar to past surveys.  No special sampling has been conducted to adequately assess abundance or size distribution of black crappie or largemouth bass.Lower Twin Lake has an abundant white sucker and shorthead redhorse population.  Both species had catch rates above other class 31 lakes.Other species sampled include rock bass and pumpkinseed at moderate abundance, and yellow bullhead, brown bullhead, and tullibee (cisco) at low abundance.Anglers can help maintain or improve the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for table fare, but encourages release of medium to large-size fish.  Releasing these fish will help maintain the fish population in Lower Twin and provides anglers with opportunities to catch more and larger fish in the future. </p>",

Northern pike are above average in numbers and growth; good spawning area is available.  Yellow perch are above average but small in size.  Black crappie, bluegill, rock bass, pumpkinseed and the bullhead species are present, but low in numbers.  Three brown trout and three tullibee were caught.  A large population of adult suckers and red horse are present.  No carp were caught but were taken in 1979 testnets.Management Recommendations:To maintain a fishable walleye population, it will be necessary to stock fingerlings annually.  The recommended stocking rate is 1/2 pound of 50/lb. fingerlings (approximately 120 pounds) annually.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lower Twin is located in northern Wadena County, just south of the Hubbard County line.  Lower Twin has a surface area of 252 acres and a maximum depth of 26 feet.  A DNR public access is located on the channel (Shell River) connecting Upper and Lower Twin Lakes.  The Shell River flows thru Upper and Lower Twin lakes and eventually into the Crow Wing River.  Lower Twin is a popular fishing lake and receives moderate to heavy fishing pressure year around.  Lower Twin provides multi-species opportunities to the angler, with good populations of Northern Pike, Walleye, and panfish. <br> \n <br> \nThe Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics.  Lower Twin is in lake class 31.  Class 31 lakes generally have very hard water and a regularly shaped shoreline.  Other class 31 lakes in the Park Rapids management area include: Second, Fifth, Sixth, Seventh, and Eighth Crow Wing Lakes, and Boulder, Duck, Evergreen, Hattie, Hinds, and Tripp. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance has remained steady the past several surveys on Lower Twin.  Several year-classes of Walleye were sampled and ranged in size from 10 to 27 inches.  Yellow Perch, an important forage species for Walleye, were sampled in high numbers, similar to past surveys.  Yellow Perch were small in size and generally not an acceptable size for angling, but Perch up to 9 inches were sampled. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers will find an abundant Northern Pike population in Lower Twin.  Lower Twin has large shallow areas of submerged and emergent aquatic vegetation that results in excellent reproduction and recruitment of Northern Pike.  Sampled Northern Pike had an average length and weight of 23.8 inches and 3.2 pounds, with fish measured up to 38.3 inches. <br> \n <br> \nPanfish are a popular choice year-around on Lower Twin.  Anglers will find Bluegill and Pumpkinseed in the 6-8 inch size range.  Black Crappie are present in low to moderate numbers in Lower Twin. <br> \n   <br> \nLower Twin has both Largemouth Bass and Smallmouth Bass populations.  Present and past surveys have shown low to moderate Largemouth Bass populations compared to other area lakes.  Smallmouth Bass are found in lower numbers and seem to be concentrated in the inlet and outlet areas. <br> \n   <br> \nLower Twin supports abundant White Sucker and Redhorse populations.  Anglers pursuing these species will find high numbers in the inlet and outlet areas. <br> \n <br> \nCurrently faucet snails and curly leaf pondweed, both aquatic invasive species (AIS), have been identified in Lower Twin.  To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access. <br> \n</p>",

A survey targeting near shore fish species was conducted by Park Rapids Fisheries Staff on July 25, 2018 to assess populations of non-game and small sport fish.  Ten 100-foot sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake shore, sampling a variety of habitat types.  Each site was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot 1/8th-inch mesh seine, depending on habitat conditions.   <br> \n <br> \nDuring this assessment, one sites was sampled with a 50-foot seine and three sites were sampled with a 15-foot seine. Site conditions prevented the use of seines at six sites.  Backpack electrofishing was done at all 10 sites, several of which were conducted from the side of the boat.  Nearshore sampling captured eleven species of fish including two species intolerant of disturbance; Banded Killifish, and Blackchin Shiner.  Other species sampled during the nearshore effort included Bluegill, Common Shiner, Iowa Darter, Johnny Darter, Largemouth Bass, Logperch, Smallmouth Bass, Tadpole Madtom and Yellow Perch.  Nearshore catches will be used along with gill net and trap net catch data from a standard fisheries survey conducted on July 9, 2018, to calculate a fish-based Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) score which is indicative of the health of Lower Twin Lake.   <br> \n <br> \nThis survey is contributing to a watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.  Lower Twin Lake is located in the Crow Wing River Watershed.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>South Twin Lake (391 acres) is a very popular winter fishing lake averaging 67 fish houses per year for the past 10 years.  The brown trout sampled during 1993 are not unusual as brown trout have been sampled during previous surveys.  Their origin is most likely from the Straight River which flows into the Fish Hook River which joins the Shell River just above the Twin Lakes.  The present walleye abundance is less than similar lakes in the Park Rapids area (Duck, Crow Wing 6, Crow Wing 5, Crow Wing 7).  The average weight of walleyes sampled was 2.2 pounds with a mean length of 17.6 inches with 73% of the samples exceeding 15 inches.  Northern pike abundance is comparable to similar lakes.  Their average size in 1993 was 21.6 inches and 2.3 pounds.  Sufficient samples of largemouth bass and black crappies were not obtained to assess their abundance and size structure.  The bluegill population is at a low density for lake class 31.  The bluegill size structure, although slow growing, has good average size with 94% of the bluegills sampled being more than 6.0 inches.The yellow perch in South Twin Lake are very abundant and provide an excellent forage base for the predator population.  The yellow perch size structure is small with a mere 4% of the yellow perch sampled that are more than 8.0 inches.</p>",
