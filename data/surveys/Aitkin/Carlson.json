Bluegill sampled (17 of 17 aged) ranged from three to six years of age with a strong year class in 1987. The growth rates were normal.  Black crappie sampled (17 of 17 aged) ranged from one to seven years of age with strong year classes indicated for 1986 and 1987 with no fish sampled from 1984 or 1985.  The growth rates were normal.  Yellow perch sampled (1 of 1 aged) was three years of age.  Growth rate was normal.</p>",
