Black, brown, and yellow bullheads, yellow perch, and bluegill were found at below local median levels.  Shorthead redhorse probably entered Charley Lake with water pumped from the Mississippi River.  The numbers of carp and black bullhead are significantly lower than in 1979.  Walleye are the result of stockings in Pleasant Lake. </p>",
