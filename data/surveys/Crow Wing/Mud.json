                "narrative": "<p>Mud lake is an 84 acre lake located  5 miles southeast of Emily.  Maximum depth is 28 feet with 42% less than 15 feet deep.  Water clarity is limited due to bog stain.  The shoreline is a mixed forest with numerous red pine present on sandy soil.  Development is light with a total of 11 cottages and homes present.  Bottom substrate is sand or gravel next to the shoreline and often changes to muck shortly.  Aquatic vegetation is very abundant around the entire lake.  Numerous species of submered vegetation are present, along with waterlilies and wild rice which is very abundant.  Public access is adequate via mud brook from Island lake for up to medium size boats.  The lake is primarily a northern pike and panfish lake.  Northern pike catch rate of 5.0 fish/net is normal for this lake class type.  The majority of the northern pike were small with the average size 20.0 inches.   A few fish are present over 30 inches and because of the small size of the lake it would be best to practice catch and release on these fish since they are so few.  Black crappie abundance is very good with size ranging from 4.9 to 9.7 inches.  Anglers should expect the average size to be around 7.5 inches.  Bluegill abundnace was good with a few fish reaching 8.0 inches and the average 6.2 inches.  Yellow perch, largemouth bass, and pumpkinseed were present in low numbers.</p>",
