                "narrative": "<p>Peltier Lake is a 465-acre natural environment lake located approximately 15 miles north of St. Paul in the Cities of Centerville and Lino Lakes.  Peltier is the sixth lake downstream (from the headwater) of the fourteen-lake Rice Creek lake chain.  Maximum depth is 18 feet and the lake is over 88% littoral.   Water quality in this lake is generally poor as a result of high populations of carp and bullheads and suspected nutrient loading from Rice, Hardwood and Clearwater Creeks.  Peltier Lake has been included as part of the statewide Sentinel Lakes Project and will be intensively studied in future years. <br> \n <br> \nManagement of Peltier Lake has consisted of winter oxygen monitoring until the installation of a winter aeration device in 1988.  The aeration system has been monitored since its installation to confirm its effectiveness.  Walleye fry stocking was initiated in 1988, with additional annual stockings from 1989 to 1995.  Currently walleye management calls for the stocking of 2,500 fry/littoral acre, on a biennial schedule, on odd numbered years.  Stocking of surplus yearling channel catfish began in 2001 and was also performed in 2004-2007.  <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass were sampled by night electrofishing on one effort lasting from May 27 to May 28, 2008.  Four 30-minute sampling stations were completed.  A total of 19 largemouth bass were captured.  This represents an electrofishing catch rate of 9.5/hour.  Largemouth bass ranged in length from 8.7 to 18.9 inches, with an average length of nearly 12 inches.   <br> \nIce-out netting activities targeting northern pike were conducted between 4/18/08 and 4/24/2008.  Thirty trap net sets produced 35 northern pike (1.17/set).  The size of northern pike sampled ranged from 8.78 inches to 35.43 inches total length.  No fish larger than 36 inches were captured during this assessment.  Mean length of the northern pike was 21.26\".  Previous gill net assessments indicated that northern pike are at or below median levels, except for the 2002 and 2007 efforts which were above 10/set.  <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nBluegill (BLG) were sampled in the highest abundance of all species captured during this and previous population assessments.  Catch rates, however, are commonly below the median level for abundance in lake class 38.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie, yellow perch, bowfin, white sucker, and carp are traditionally sampled in high abundance.  <br> \n <br> \nSeveral tolerant species, including black bullhead, were historically sampled in high abundance until the installation of the lake aeration system.   <br> \n <br> \nYellow bullhead, black bullhead, hybrid sunfish, and green sunfish are typically found in very low abundance.  <br> \n <br> \nTwo species, walleye and channel catfish, while being stocked regularly, were not sampled in this year's assessments. <br> \n   <br> \nVadnais Lake is a very popular fishing destination.  Numerous shore anglers line the public land near the dam on the west side of the lake in the spring of the year to fish above and below the dam.  A fish pier on the south and west corner of the lake also provides a popular site for anglers.   <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Peltier Lake is part of the Rice Creek watershed.  A dam was constructed at the outlet of Peltier Lake to control the water level of Peltier and Centerville Lakes. A pumping station exists in Centerville Lake for the St. Paul Water Utility.  During high water events, the dam does not function as a fish barrier.  Winter aeration via pump and baffle system has been operated as needed since 1988.  Peltier Lake has also been included in a study called the Sentinel Lakes Project, which includes increased fish, habitat and water quality sampling.  <br> \n <br> \nA near shore Index of Biotic Integrity survey (IBI) was conducted on July 16th, 2013 to assess populations of non-game species and young-of-the-year (YOY) sport fish using backpack electrofishing and seining. Electrofishing with a backpack unit was conducted at 12 stations around the perimeter of Peltier Lake. Sampling took place from the boat at sites where depth and CWD prevented wading.   <br> \n <br> \nNear shore IBI sampling captured several species of fish including (in alphabetical order): Black Crappie, Bluegill, Central Mudminnow, Fathead Minnow, Golden Shiner, Green Sunfish, Largemouth Bass, Northern Pike and Yellow Perch. The near shore survey of Peltier Lake captured two species that are tolerant of poor water quality:  Central Mudminnow and Green Sunfish. All other species captured are classified as having a neutral tolerance.  No intolerant species were sampled.  A lack of indicator species and presence of multiple tolerant species suggests Peltier Lake water quality is poor.   <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Peltier Lake is part of the Rice Creek watershed.  A dam was constructed at the outlet of Peltier Lake to control the water level of Peltier and Centerville Lakes. A pumping station exists in Centerville Lake for the St. Paul Water Utility.  During high water events, the dam does not function as a fish barrier.  Winter aeration via pump and baffle system has been operated as needed since 1988.  Peltier Lake has also been included in a study called the Sentinel Lakes Project, which includes increased fish, habitat and water quality sampling.  <br> \n <br> \nA near shore Index of Biotic Integrity survey (IBI) was conducted on July 16th, 2013 and a repeat of this survey was conducted on September 11th, 2013 to assess populations of non-game species and young-of-the-year (YOY) sport fish using backpack electrofishing and seining. Electrofishing with a backpack unit was conducted at 12 stations around the perimeter of Peltier Lake. Sampling took place from the boat at sites where depth and CWD prevented wading.   <br> \n <br> \nNear shore IBI sampling captured several species of fish including (in alphabetical order): Black Bullhead, Black Crappie, Bluegill, Common Carp, Golden Shiner, Green Sunfish, hybrid sunfish, Largemouth Bass, Pumpkinseed Sunfish, Northern Pike and Yellow Perch. The near shore survey of Peltier Lake captured several species that are tolerant of poor water quality:  Black Bullhead, Common Carp and Green Sunfish. All other species captured are classified as having a neutral tolerance.  No intolerant species were sampled.  A lack of indicator species and presence of multiple tolerant species suggests Peltier Lake water quality is poor.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Peltier Lake is a 465-acre natural environment lake located approximately 15 miles north of St. Paul in the Cities of Centerville and Lino Lakes.  Peltier is the sixth lake downstream (from the headwater) of the fourteen-lake Rice Creek lake chain.  Maximum depth is 18 feet and the lake is over 88% littoral.   Water quality in this lake is generally poor as a result of high populations of carp and bullheads and suspected nutrient loading from Rice, Hardwood and Clearwater Creeks.  Peltier Lake has been included as part of the statewide Sentinel Lakes Project and will be intensively studied in future years. <br> \n <br> \nManagement of Peltier Lake has consisted of winter oxygen monitoring until the installation of a winter aeration device in 1988.  The aeration system has been monitored since its installation to confirm its effectiveness.  Walleye fry stocking was initiated in 1988, with additional annual stockings from 1989 to 1995.  Currently walleye fry management calls for the stocking of 2,500 fry/littoral acre, on a biennial schedule, on odd numbered years.  Stocking of surplus yearling channel catfish began in 2001 and was also performed in 2004-2009.  <br> \n <br> \nBluegill (BLG) were sampled in the highest abundance of all species captured during this and previous population assessments.  Catch rates, however, are commonly below the median level for abundance in lake class 38.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie, yellow perch, bowfin, white sucker, and carp are traditionally sampled in high abundance.  <br> \n <br> \nSeveral tolerant species, including black bullhead, were historically sampled in high abundance until the installation of the lake aeration system.   <br> \n <br> \nHybrid sunfish, and green sunfish are typically found in very low abundance.  <br> \n <br> \nTwo species, walleye and channel catfish, while being stocked regularly, were not sampled in this year's assessments. <br> \n   <br> \nPeltier Lake is a very popular fishing destination.  Numerous shore anglers line the public land near the dam on the west side of the lake in the spring of the year to fish above and below the dam.  A fishing pier on the south and west corner of the lake also provides a popular site for anglers.   <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Peltier Lake is a 465-acre natural environment lake located approximately 15 miles north of St. Paul in the Cities of Centerville and Lino Lakes.  Peltier is the sixth lake downstream (from the headwater) of the fourteen-lake Rice Creek lake chain.  Maximum depth is 18 feet and the lake is over 88% littoral.   Water quality in this lake is generally poor as a result of high populations of carp and bullheads and suspected nutrient loading from Rice, Hardwood and Clearwater Creeks.  Peltier Lake has been included as part of the statewide Sentinel Lakes Project and will be intensively studied in future years. <br> \n <br> \nManagement of Peltier Lake has consisted of winter oxygen monitoring until the installation of a winter aeration device in 1988.  The aeration system has been monitored since its installation to confirm its effectiveness.  Walleye fry stocking was initiated in 1988, with additional annual stockings from 1989 to 1995.  Currently walleye fry management calls for the stocking of 2,500 fry/littoral acre, on a biennial schedule, on odd numbered years.  Stocking of surplus yearling channel catfish began in 2001 and was also performed in 2004-2009.  <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass were sampled by night electrofishing on one effort lasting from May 26 to May 27, 2010.  A total of 58 largemouth bass were captured.  This represents an electrofishing catch rate of 29.0/hour.  Largemouth bass ranged in length from 3.58 to 17.4 inches, with an average length of 11.1 inches.   <br> \n  <br> \nPeltier Lake is a very popular fishing destination.  Numerous shore anglers line the public land near the dam on the west side of the lake in the spring of the year to fish above and below the dam.  A fishing pier on the south and west corner of the lake also provides a popular site for anglers.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Peltier Lake is a 551 acre, class 38 lake, located in eastern Anoka County.  Peltier Lake is part of the Rice Creek watershed. A dam was constructed at the outlet of Peltier Lake to control the water level of Peltier and Centerville Lakes. Winter aeration via pump and baffle system has been operated as needed since 1988. Peltier Lake has also been included in a study called the Sentinel Lakes Project, which includes increased fish, habitat and water quality sampling.  A water level drawdown was conducted in the fall of 2017 in an attempt to control non-native curly-leaf pondweed. Walleye are the primary management species and are stocked at a rate of 1,000 fry per littoral acre annually. This survey was conducted using trap nets, gill nets, and night-time electrofishing in June 2021. The previous survey occurred in 2016.  <br> \n <br> \nOnly two Walleye were sampled in the survey resulting in a catch rate of 0.3 fish per gill net. This is well below the first quartile for the lake class but only one survey in history has exceeded 2.5 fish per gill net which was 4.7 fish per net in 1997. The fish measured 18 and 21 inches long and were 3 and 10 years old.  <br> \nNorthern Pike were sampled at a rate of 12.5 fish per gillnet. This rate is much higher than similar lakes but it is typical relative to recent previous surveys. Fish size was also typical with a mean length of 23.4 inches. Sizes ranged from 13.3 to 30.9 inches and fish were well distributed across that range.  <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie were sampled by trap nets at a rate of 6.1 fish per net which is typical. Gill nets sampled them at a rate of 48.5 fish per net which is several times more than average on similar lakes but fairly typical relative to the lakes history. This discrepancy between the gears can likely be at least partially explained by the exceptionally thick vegetation and shallow water where the trap nets are set as this difference manifests in most surveys in the lakes recent history. Fish size was average with a mean length in gill nets of 7.5 inches and a maximum of 11 inches. One 14.5 inch fish was captured in trap nets which was the largest fish sampled. <br> \n <br> \nTrap nets sampled Bluegill at a rate of 9.6 fish per net. This is lower than average for the similar lakes but equivalent to recent surveys. This consistently low catch rate is again likely due to the vegetation and shallow water where the trap nets are set. Fish size was lower than average with a mean length of 5.4 inches. Bluegill sampled by gill nets were slightly larger with a mean length of 6.4 inches and a maximum of 8.7 inches. Fish ranged in age from 1 to 9 years with the majority of them being 3 years old.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch were sampled at a rate of 2.8 fish per gill net. This is well below average and catch rates have been consistently declining from an all-time high catch rate of 85 fish per net in 2009. Fish size was typical with a mean length of 6.8 inches and a maximum length of 7.4 inches. All fish aged were 3 years old which likely indicates that recruitment has been inconsistent in recent years. <br> \n  <br> \nElectrofishing sampled Largemouth Bass at a rate of 10.8 fish per hour. This is the lowest rate since the 2008 survey and is low relative to other lakes in the area. Excessively thick vegetation and poor visibility likely reduced sampling effectiveness. Size ranged widely from 3.7 to 17.8 inches with a mean length of 9 inches. Fish ages ranged from 1 to 7 years old.  <br> \n <br> \nOther fish sampled included: Black Bullhead, Bowfin (Dogfish), Common Carp, Golden Shiner, Green Sunfish, Hybrid Sunfish, Pumpkinseed, Redhorse species, White Sucker, and Yellow Bullhead.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Peltier Lake is a 551 acre class 38 lake located in eastern Anoka County.  The fish community is dominated by Bluegill, Black Crappie, and Northern Pike.  Walleye are currently stocked at a rate of 1,000 fry per littoral acre annually.  Peltier Lake is part of the Rice Creek watershed. A dam was constructed at the outlet of Peltier Lake to control the water level of Peltier and Centerville Lakes. A pumping station exists in Centerville Lake for the St. Paul Water Utility.  During high water events, the dam does not function as a fish barrier. Winter aeration via pump and baffle system has been operated as needed since 1988. Peltier Lake has also been included in a study called the Sentinel Lakes Project, which includes increased fish, habitat and water quality sampling.  . <br> \n <br> \nNo Walleye were sampled during this survey, a decrease from 5 sampled in the last survey in 2013.  Northern Pike catch rate was 10.5 fish per gill net, above average for class 38 lakes.  The average length of sampled pike was 22.5 inches, and the largest was 33.6 inches.  Over 57% of sampled pike were greater than 21 inches in length, and 19% were greater than 26 inches. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill catch rate was 13 fish per trap net, below average for class 38 lakes.  Bluegill catch rate is up significantly from 3.89 fish per trap net sampled in 2013.  The average length of Bluegills sampled in the trap nets was 5.87 inches.  Over 58% of Bluegills sampled were greater than 6 inches in length and 23% were greater than 7 inches.  Age-2 and age-3 fish were the most abundant.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie catch rate was 2.67 fish per trap net and 39.5 fish per gill net, above average for class 38 lakes.  Over 50% of sampled crappie were greater than 8 inches in length, and 8% were greater than 9 inches.  The vast majority of fish were from the 2014 year class (age-2), which appears to be strong and may provide good angling opportunities during the next few years.   <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch catch rate was 17.5 fish per gill net, down slightly from 20 fish per gill net sampled in 2013.  Sampled perch ranged from 5.4 to 7.9 inches in length with an average length of 6.3 inches.  The majority of fish belonged to the 2014(age-2) and 2013(age-3) year classes. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>The present fish population in Peltier Lake consists of a mixed bag of opportunities for above average size fish from a variety of species. Northern Pike were sampled in good abundance with the average size fish being 21.2\" and 2.26 pounds. Several fish over 30.0 inches were sampled. Walleye were sampled below 1997 levels, but at the second highest level for gill net abundance ever observed. The average walleye captured measured 18.3\" and was 2.37 pounds. Current management for this species consists of stocking 1,000,000 fry on odd numbered years. Yellow perch were sampled in good abundance with the average fish being 6.2 inches. Growth rates for all 3 species are good. Surplus production Channel Catfish yearlings were stocked in 2001 and have grown to almost one-half pound. These fish have provided a bonus for shore based anglers.Bluegill and Black Crappie were sampled in above average numbers with some quality size fish present in the catch. The largest Bluegill captured was 8.27\", but the average size fish sampled was 5.65\" and 0.15 pounds (6.5/lb.). Almost 30 percent of the Bluegills captured measured 7.0 inches or longer. The average Black Crappie sampled was 5.92\" and 0.12 pounds (8.11/lb.). Over 11.0 percent of the Black Crappie captured were 8.0\" or larger, with the largest individual captured being 10.9\". A few Largemouth Bass were captured that were of above average size.  Black Bullheads have dominated the fish population here in past surveys. The 2002 catch showed a significant reduction from catch levels observed in 1997. The average Black Bullhead was 10.8\" and 0.77 pounds. Above average numbers of White Suckers, Bowfin, Bigmouth Buffalo and Carp were also captured.</p>",

THIS EXCELLENT GROWTH RATE CONTINUED THROUGH AGE III.  BETWEEN AGE III AND VII GROWTH TAPERED OFF TO ABOUT AVERAGE. WAES WERE SEEN IN NUMBERS NEAR THE REGIONAL MEDIAN.  THE FISH WERE ABOVE AVERAGE SIZE.  ONE WAE SAMPLED MAY HAVE BEEN FROM THE 1991 FRY STOCKING.  THE OTHERS WERE FROM CEN LAKE.  GROWTH OF WAE WAS 20-30% ABOVE AVERAGE OVER THE BACK- CALCULATED PERIOD (FOUR ANNULI).  ONE LMB WAS TAKEN IN A GILL NET; GROWTH OF THIS FISH WAS AVERAGE.  THE CATCH OF WHC WAS LOW (3 FISH); HOW EVER, THESE FISH WERE OF LARGE SIZE.  BLC WERE SEEN IN HIGH NUMBERS IN GILL NET CATCHES BUT BELOW AVERAGE NUMBERS IN THE TRAP NETS; SIZE OF THESE FISH WAS ABOUT AVERAGE.  CARP AND BLH WERE PRESENT IN HIGH NUMBERS BUT WTS AND BIB WERE SEEN IN AVERAGE AND LOW NUMBERS, RESPECTIVELY.  SHORELINE SEINING PRODUCED A FAIR NUMBER OF YOY YEP, BLG, AND OTHER SPECIES.</p>",

Black crappies were found in high abundance but smaller sizes. Less than 1% were longer than 10 inches. Two species, walleye and channel catfish , while being stocked regularly, were not sampled in this assessment. Northern pike were found in high abundance and average size. Largemouth bass were captured in low numbers. The black bullhead population, after years of being over abundant, has dropped to moderate levels. Brown bullhead and yellow bullhead were also sampled in low numbers. White suckers, carp, bowfin (dogfish), yellow perch, and golden shiner were also captured.     </p>",

Peltier is the sixth lake downstream (from the headwater) of the fourteen-lake Rice Creek lake chain.  Maximum depth is 18 feet and the lake is over 88% littoral.   Water quality in this lake is generally poor as a result of high populations of carp and bullheads and suspected nutrient loading from Rice, Hardwood and Clearwater Creeks.  Peltier Lake has been included as part of the statewide Sentinel Lakes Project and will be intensively studied in future years. <br> \n <br> \nManagement of Peltier Lake has consisted of winter oxygen monitoring until the installation of a winter aeration device in 1988.  The aeration system has been monitored since its installation to confirm its effectiveness.  Walleye fry stocking was initiated in 1988, with additional annual stockings from 1989 to 1995.  Currently walleye management calls for the stocking of 2,500 fry/littoral acre, on a biennial schedule, on odd numbered years.  Stocking of surplus yearling channel catfish began in 2001 and was also performed in 2004-2007.  <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass were sampled by night electrofishing on one effort lasting from May 27 to May 28, 2008.  Four 30-minute sampling stations were completed.  A total of 19 largemouth bass were captured.  This represents an electrofishing catch rate of 9.5/hour.  Largemouth bass ranged in length from 8.7 to 18.9 inches, with an average length of nearly 12 inches.   <br> \nIce-out netting activities targeting northern pike were conducted between 4/18/08 and 4/24/2008.  Thirty trap net sets produced 35 northern pike (1.17/set).  The size of northern pike sampled ranged from 8.78 inches to 35.43 inches total length.  No fish larger than 36 inches were captured during this assessment.  Mean length of the northern pike was 21.26\".  Previous gill net assessments indicated that northern pike are at or below median levels, except for the 2002 and 2007 efforts which were above 10/set.  <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nBluegill (BLG) were sampled in the highest abundance of all species captured during this and previous population assessments.  Catch rates, however, are commonly below the median level for abundance in lake class 38.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie, yellow perch, bowfin, white sucker, and carp are traditionally sampled in high abundance.  <br> \n <br> \nSeveral tolerant species, including black bullhead, were historically sampled in high abundance until the installation of the lake aeration system.   <br> \n <br> \nYellow bullhead, black bullhead, hybrid sunfish, and green sunfish are typically found in very low abundance.  <br> \n <br> \nTwo species, walleye and channel catfish, while being stocked regularly, were not sampled in this year's assessments. <br> \n   <br> \nVadnais Lake is a very popular fishing destination.  Numerous shore anglers line the public land near the dam on the west side of the lake in the spring of the year to fish above and below the dam.  A fishing pier on the south and west corner of the lake also provides a popular site for anglers.   <br> \n</p>",

Black crappie were the next most abundant fish present, with most fish of small size.  Bluegill were less abundant with nearly half of the fish over 7 inches long.  Northern pike numbers were good, with most fish three years old.  Walleye numbers were high for this lake class with some fish over 20 inches.  Carp numbers were above average for this lake class.  Other species present in the lake include bowfin, golden shiner, largemouth bass (2 fish), muskellunge (1 fish), white sucker, yellow bullhead, and yellow perch.  Several minnow species were sampled in seine hauls.</p>",
