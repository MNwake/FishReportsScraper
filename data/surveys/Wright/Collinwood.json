                "narrative": "<p>A population assessment was conducted at Collinwood Lake, Meeker county, during the week of July 19, 1999.  Collinwood is a 584-acre lake that is primarily managed for walleye and northern pike.  Standard gill nets, trap nets, and spring night-time electrofishing techniques were used to assess the fishery.  Gill nets captured 202 walleye, for a catch rate of 25.3 fish per net.  Fish ranged in length from 9.1 to 28.9 inches and had an average length of 16.7 inches.  Most fish were between 13 and 20 inches.Gill nets sampled 85 northern pike, for a catch rate of 10.6 per net.  Fish ranged in length from 17.0 to 27.8 inches and had an average length at 21.1 inches.Trap nets sampled 254 bluegill, for a catch rate of 28.2 per net.  Bluegill ranged in length from 2.7 to 9.1 inches.  The average length was 5.0 inches.  Although there were several large individuals the bulk of the catch was between 3 and 6.5 inches.Trap nets sampled 241 black crappie, for a catch rate of 26.8 per net.  Fish ranged in length from 3.9 to 11.1 inches and approximately 18% were 8 inches or larger.  The average length was 6.2 inches.Electrofishing for largemouth bass in the spring produced 47 fish, for a catch rate of 35.3 fish per hour of electrofisher on-time.  A wide range of fish were sampled ranging from 3.7 to 19.6 inches.  Approximately 51% of the fish sampled were 12 inches or longer.  The average length was 12.6 inches.     </p>",

Black bullhead are abundant at 68/gillnet, and of excellent size: 9.5-11.0 inch range.  Walleyes are present at a rate of 5.0/set and range from 20.0-24.0 inches in length.  Gillnet catches of yellow perch were low (8.5/net), but this appears to be a sampling anomaly.  Trapnet catches for most species increased, though not significantly.  Catches of carp exceed the local median at 4.6/set, and the majority range from 20-26 inches in length.  Black crappies are numerous and catches indicate a population increase since 1973.  Most of the crappies are 6.5-8.4 inches long, these being age groups III and IV, reflecting about average growth rate.  Bluegills are not as numerous, averaging 3.4/trapnet set, compared with local catch averages of 15.61/set.  A number of largemouth bass were taken in shoreline seining and excellent fishing for this species is reported.</p>",

A total of 3 YOY were sampled for a catch rate of 3.0/hr, which was below Collinwood's historical average (64.5 fish/hr). This indicated that some natural reproduction occurred. In 2023, no yearlings were sampled. The low YOY and yearling Walleye catches were likely due to the 2023 partial winterkill at Collinwood Lake. Walleye fry will be stocked in 2024 as scheduled.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A population assessment was conducted at Collinwood Lake in 2012 to monitor the fish population.  The lake was originally scheduled for sampling in 2011, but was not completed due to a government shutdown.  In 2012, a total of 14 species were sampled in the gill nets and trap nets.  Collinwood Lake is primarily managed for northern pike and walleye, while black crappie, bluegill, and largemouth bass are listed as secondary species in the Fisheries Lake Management Plan.  The (n=11) notation refers to the number of times a lake was sampled over the specified time period and catch rates were subsequently calculated.    <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled high numbers (170) of northern pike for a catch rate of 18.9/net, which was above the normal range for this type of lake and the highest ever recorded at Collinwood.  The 2006 catch rate was 2.9/net.  Catch rates from 1958 to 2012 (n=11) were highly variable, ranging from 0.0 to 18.9/net with an average of 6.1.  Over time, recruitment could be classified as moderate at Collinwood Lake.  Gill netted northern pike were 16.5 to 31.7 inches long with an average of 21.4.  Approximately 56% of the gill net catch was less than 21 inches in length.  Trap nets sampled 21 northern pike and five of them were 30 inches or longer.  The maximum length for northern pike that were sampled in the trap nets was 37.6 inches.  Good numbers and quality sized fish should appeal to many anglers.  Local water levels were exceptionally high in 2011, which may have allowed northern pike to access quality spawning habitat and produce a strong year-class.     <br> \n <br> \nTrap nets sampled low numbers (36) of black crappie for a catch rate of 4.0/net, which was within the normal range for this type of lake.  The 2006 catch rate was also low (1.7/net).  Catch rates from 1958 to 2012 (n=11) were variable, ranging from 1.0 to 35.8/net with an average of 12.3.  Trap netted black crappie were 4.8 to 11.9 inches long with an average of 6.3.  Gill nets sampled low numbers (51) of black crappie for a catch rate of 5.7/net, which was within the normal range for this type of lake.  The 2006 gill net catch rate was 10.4/net.  Catch rates from 1958 to 2012 (n=11) were highly variable, ranging from 1.2 to 75.0/net with an average of 26.6.  Gill netted black crappie were 5.0 to 6.5 inches long with an average of 5.6.  Size distributions, from both gears, indicated a poor size structure.  These smaller fish should be of a more acceptable size to anglers within a couple of years. <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled moderate numbers (79) of walleye for a catch rate of 8.8/net, which was above the normal range for this type of lake.  The 2006 catch rate was similar at 7.6/net.  Catch rates from 1958 to 2012 (n=11), under various stocking regimes, were highly variable ranging from 2.1 to 25.3/net with an average of 11.2.  Gill netted walleye were 7.7 to 23.5 inches long with an average of 17.3.  The size distribution indicated a quality size structure.  Walleye were age-1 to age-9 with 8 year-classes present.  The 2009 and 2010 year-classes were ranked as moderate and strong, accounting for 28% and 34% of the catch, respectively.  Non-stocked year-classes accounted for 47% of the aged walleye, indicating that there was significant natural reproduction.  It was unknown what portion of the catch, during the stocked years, resulted from natural reproduction, stocking, or some combination from both.  The strongest year-class (2010) occurred during a non-stocked year.  In 2012, growth was exceptionally fast.  The average length at capture, for age 2 fish, was 16.6 inches.  The current stocking regime (1 pound of fingerlings/littoral acre every-other-year) was initiated in 1991.  Catch rates from 1995 to 2012 (n=5) ranged from 7.6 to 25.3/net with an average of 15.2 and a median (middle most data point) of 12.0.  The latest five catch rates were all above the normal range for this type of lake.  High numbers of northern pike may be limiting the survival of stocked walleye fingerlings at Collinwood Lake.      <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled low numbers (8) of channel catfish for a catch rate of 0.9/net, but a lake-class normal range was not available for this species.  The 2012 catch rate tied the all time high catch rate from 2002.  The 2006 catch was also low (0.3/net).  Historic catch rates (n=11) ranged from 0.0 to 0.9/net with an average of 0.2.  Channel catfish were last stocked in 1989.  In 2012, gill netted channel catfish were 10.1 to 23.4 inches long with an average of 17.2.  The trap net catch rate was also low (0.2/net).   <br> \n   <br> \nTrap nets sampled moderate numbers (139) of bluegill for a catch rate of 15.4/net which was within the normal range for this type of lake.  Bluegill were the most abundant fish sampled with trap nets in 2012.  The 2006 catch rate was similar at 19.8/net.  Catch rates from 1958 to 2012 (n=11) were variable, ranging from 2.5 to 28.2/net, with an average of 11.7.  Catch rates were higher in the 1990's and 2000's compared to the 1970's and 1980's, possibly showing some type of an ecological shift.  In 2012, trap netted bluegill were 2.8 to 9.1 inches long with an average of 5.2.  Approximately 5% of the trap net sample was 8 inches or longer, indicating that quality sized fish were present.   <br> \n    <br> \nGill nets sampled low numbers (1) of largemouth bass for a catch rate of 0.1/net, which was below the normal range for this type of lake.  The largemouth bass was 14.7 inches long.  Trap nets did not sample any largemouth bass in 2012.  Spring night-time electrofishing (EF) for largemouth bass was not conducted in 2012, because it was completed in 2011.  The 2011 EF catch rate was 2.7/hr and the lowest ever measured at Collinwood.  Historic EF catch rates (n=7) from 1991 to 2012 ranged from 2.7 to 41.3/hr with an average of 18.8.  Fair numbers of young-of-the-year largemouth bass (109) were seined in 2012, indicating successful natural reproduction.   <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled low numbers (41) of yellow perch for a catch rate of 4.6/net, which was within the normal range for this type of lake.  The 2006 catch rate was 16.3/net.  Catch rates from 1958 to 2012 (n=11) were highly variable ranging from 0.3 to 81.7/net with an average of 29.8.  Yellow perch were 4.7 to 6.9 inches long with an average of 6.1.  Yellow perch were likely an important forage item at Collinwood Lake.   <br> \n <br> \nTrap nets sampled high numbers (93) of carp for a catch rate of 10.3/net, which was above the normal range for this type of lake.  Historic catch rates (n=11) from 1958 to 2012 were mostly high, ranging from 2.0 to 26.7/net with an average of 7.9.  Trap netted carp were 12.7 to 30.1 inches long with an average of 17.2.  Gill nets also sampled high numbers (70) of carp for a catch rate of 7.8/net, which was above the normal range for this lake type.  Historic catch rates were mostly high, ranging from 0.4 to 11.5/net with an average of 6.4.  Gill netted carp were 13.2 to 25.2 inches long with an average of 17.2.  High numbers of carp, over the last 50+ years, have likely had significant negative impacts on submergent plant abundance and water quality in Collinwood Lake.  A large watershed and connections to many different wetlands, used for spawning, makes carp control difficult at Collinwood Lake. <br> \n  <br> \nGill nets sampled moderate numbers (325) of black bullhead for a catch rate of 36.1/net, which was  within the normal range for this type of lake.  Black bullhead were the most abundant fish sampled with the gill nets in 2012.  Historic catch rates from 1958 to 2012 (n=11) were highly variable, ranging from 1.6 to 281.2/net with an average of 72.9.  Trap nets only sampled five fish.  The trap net catch rate (0.6/net) was below the normal range for this type of lake.  Gill netted black bullhead were 4.9 to 13.2 inches long with an average of 8.8.  Approximately 14% of the gill net catch was 10 inches or longer and these should appeal to bullhead anglers.     <br> \n <br> \nAdditional species sampled in the standard gear included; white sucker, yellow bullhead, golden shiner, green sunfish, and pumpkinseed sunfish. <br> \n <br> \nMost of the net catches from 2012 were within the ranges of all of the historic (1958 to 2012) catches conducted at Collinwood Lake.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A standard survey was conducted at Collinwood Lake, beginning on July 16, 2018, to monitor the lake's fish population and evaluate the 2013 Walleye fry stocking regime.  Collinwood is a class 24 lake and net catches were compared to other similarly classified lakes around the state.  A near-shore Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) survey also occurred during netting week, seeking to document the variety and abundance of smaller minnow sized fishes present in Collinwood Lake to determine habitat quality as derived from fish species richness and diversity of both pollution tolerant and intolerant species.  The 2017 lake management plan (LMP) listed Walleye as the only primary management species at Collinwood Lake, while Black Crappie, Bluegill, Largemouth Bass, and Northern Pike were listed as secondary species.  In 2018, a total of 13 species, plus Hybrid Sunfish, were sampled in the gill nets (GN) and trap nets (TN).  The dissolved oxygen concentration fell below 2.0 mg/l at 15 feet, indicating a lack of suitable oxygenated habitat below this depth on this date.  Water clarity was poor with a secchi disk reading of 4.0 feet, due to an algae bloom.  In 2018, the steel culverts at the outlet structure were replaced with cement box culverts following erosion and corrosion issues.  A fishing pier and numerous camping sites are available at the Wright County Park on the east side of the lake. <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled high numbers of Walleye (134) for a catch rate of 26.8/net, which was well above the lake's normal range and the highest catch ever recorded at Collinwood.  The 2017 LMP's long range goal for Walleye (>6.3/net) was met.  Walleye were the most abundant fish sampled by GN in 2018.  The 2016 catch rate was also high (9.8/net).  The latest eight GN catch rates (1995 to 2018) were all above the lake's normal range.  Catch rates from 1958 to 2018 (n=14), under various stocking regimes, were variable ranging from 2.1 to 26.8/net with an average of 12.4.  In 2018, GN Walleye were 9.1 to 27.9 inches long with an average of 14.7.  Approximately 60% of the GN catch was 14 inches or longer indicating a quality size structure.  Gill netted Walleye were estimated to be age-1 to age-11 with eight year classes present.  Both the 2014 year class and the 2016 year class were ranked as strong, accounting for 45% and 40% of the catch, respectively.  Walleye growth was slow for age-2 and age-4 fish when compared to past assessments at Collinwood.  Growth for age-1 Walleye was fast.  In 2018, non-stocked years accounted for 8% of the GN aged walleye, which was very similar to the 2016 survey's proportion of 9% from non-stocked years.  The contribution from natural reproduction during stocked years (fry or fingerling) was unknown.  Gill net catch rates from 1995 to 2014 (n=6) during the old stocking regime (1991 to 2011; 351 pounds of fingerlings every other year) ranged from 7.6 to 25.3/net with an average of 14.9, indicating a successful, but expensive and labor intensive stocking strategy.  The stocking regime changed in 2013 to annual fry stocking (351,000) until a strong year class was produced.  After two strong year classes were produced in a row (2013 and 2014) the fry stocking regime switched to every other year officially in the 2017 LMP, due to concerns with slow growth and not wanting to deplete the forage base.  Gill net catch rates during the fry stocking regime (n=2) ranged from 9.8 to 26.8/net with an average of 18.3, indicating a successful strategy.  More time will be needed to properly evaluate Walleye fry stocking at Collinwood, but at this point the strategy seems to working well.  In 2018, IBI seining sampled 85 young-of-year (YOY) Walleye.    <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled moderate numbers of Northern Pike (30) for a catch rate of 6.0/net, which was within the normal range for this type of lake.  The 2017 LMP's Northern Pike long range goal (maintain presence) was met.  The 2016 catch rate was similar at 4.1/net.  Catch rates from 1958 to 2018 (n=14) were highly variable, ranging from 0.0 to 18.9/net with an average of 5.9.  Historically, recruitment would be classified as moderate.  A large and highly connected watershed to the southwest allows Northern Pike to move into many different lakes (Maple, Big Wolf, Jennie, Todd, Hook, Pigeon, and Jewitt) and shallow wetlands (possibly high quality spawning habitat) when water levels are high enough.  Several of those mentioned lakes have had high numbers of Northern Pike in recent years.  In 2018, gill netted Northern Pike were 19.1 to 30.3 inches long with an average of 23.2.  Only 2 GN Northern Pike were over 28 inches in length, indicating a population comprised of many young fish.  Trap nets however, sampled Northern Pike up to 38.6 inches in length (age-7), indicating that larger sized fish were present.  Northern Pike were last stocked in 1992 and natural reproduction has provided a sufficient fishery for many years.  Northern Pike were age-2 to age-7, with five year classes being present.  Age-2 and age-3 fish were the most abundant, accounting for 83% of the gill net aged fish.  Growth was slow when compared to past assessments at Collinwood.  Growth would still be considered moderate or fast when compared to lakes on a statewide basis.  New Northern Pike zone regulations went into effect in the spring of 2018.  Collinwood is in the north central regulation zone, which has a 10 fish bag limit, where all fish from 22 to 26 inches in length have to be immediately released and only two harvested fish can be over 26 inches long.  Spearers are allowed to have one fish in the protected slot limit.  Collinwood is typically too turbid for darkhouse spearing.   IBI seining and electrofishing failed to sample any YOY Northern Pike, possibly indicating that there was little in-lake spawning occurring.  <br> \n <br> \nTrap nets sampled low numbers (3) of Black Crappie in 2018 for a catch rate of 0.4/net, which was below the lake's normal range and was the second lowest catch rate ever observed at Collinwood Lake.  The 2017 LMP's long range goal (maintain presence) was met.  The 2016 trap net catch rate was 0.0/net.  Catch rates from 1958 to 2018 (n=14) were variable, ranging from 0.0 to 35.8/net with an average of 9.8.  Trap netted Black Crappie were 8.9 to 11.9 inches long with an average of 10.8.  The latest three TN catch rates (2014, 2016, and 2018) all indicated low Black Crappie abundance at Collinwood.  Gill nets sampled low numbers of Black Crappie (5) for a catch rate of 1.0/net, which was below the lake's normal range and the second lowest catch rate ever recorded at Collinwood.  The 2016 GN catch rate (0.6/net) was also low.  Catch rates from 1958 to 2018 (n=14) were highly variable, ranging from 0.6 to 75.0/net with an average of 21.1.  The three latest GN catch rates (2014, 2016, and 2018) all indicated low abundance for Collinwood Lake.  Gill netted Black Crappie were 5.5 to 9.0 inches long with an average of 7.3.  Black Crappie were age-1 to age-4, with three year classes present.  Recruitment from 2012 to 2018 appeared to be very poor, with the last significant year class being produced around 2011.  In 2018, growth was moderate.  The apparent decline in Black Crappie relative abundance, since 1999, was of concern and the trend was likely related to competition, forage, and/or predation.  IBI Seining and backpack electrofishing failed to sample any Black Crappie.  Habitat favorable for the survival of young crappie may be lacking at Collinwood Lake.  From 1995 to 2018 the relative abundance of Walleye, a known predator on small Black Crappie, has been high, averaging 15.7/GN.  Spawning habitat was believed to be sufficient for Black Crappie in Collinwood.  Since Black Crappie have such high reproductive potential they are rarely limited by reproduction.  Black Crappie were last stocked in 1992.   <br> \n <br> \nTrap nets sampled moderate numbers of Bluegill (155) for a catch rate of 19.4/net which was within the normal range for this type of lake.  The 2018 TN catch rate was the fourth highest on record for Collinwood Lake.  The 2017 LMP's Bluegill long range goal (maintain presence) was met.  The 2016 catch rate was much lower at 1.3/net.  Catch rates from 1958 to 2018 (n=16) were variable, ranging from 1.3 to 28.2/net, with an average of 10.8.  Bluegill were last stocked in 1990.  In 2018, trap netted Bluegill were 3.3 to 8.7 inches long with an average of 5.6.  Approximately 6% of the TN sample was 7 inches or longer.  Gill nets sampled moderate numbers (42) of Bluegill for a catch rate of 8.4/net.  A total of eight of those GN fish were 8 inches or longer and the longest was 9.3 inches, indicating that quality sized fish were present.  Near shore IBI seining (50 foot seine) captured 393 Bluegill.  Bluegill were age-1 to age-6 with five year classes being present.  Overall, growth was moderate.  The 2016 year class was moderate to strong, accounting for 81% of the TN aged fish and was responsible for the dramatic increase in the 2018 TN catch rate.  All other year classes appeared to be weak.  Data indicated that recruitment was inconsistent.  Suitable spawning substrates were believed to be sufficient at Collinwood.  Although a formal plant survey was not done in 2018, anecdotal observations indicated an increase in submergent vegetation in certain areas of the lake.  Collinwood's marginal aquatic plant community could be a major limiting factor on Bluegill.  Lake shore owners should be encouraged to preserve the aquatic vegetation that is present.    <br> \n    <br> \nTrap nets sampled 7 Largemouth Bass for a catch rate of 0.9/net, which was above the normal range for this lake type.  The 2017 LMP's long range goal (maintain presence) was met.  Largemouth Bass were 6.1 to 19.7 inches long with an average of 9.6.  Largemouth Bass were age-1 and age-2.  The 19 inch fish could not be aged accurately from scales.  Age analysis indicated that three year classes were present.  Growth was moderate.  Data indicated inconsistent recruitment for this species.  Largemouth Bass were likely not flourishing at Collinwood due to the lake's marginal and sporadic submergent vegetation habitat.  Anecdotal observations in 2018 indicated an increase in the abundance of submergent vegetation in some areas of the lake, but no formal plant survey was conducted.  Largemouth Bass spawning substrates were believed to be sufficient at Collinwood.  IBI seine catches indicated successful Largemouth Bass reproduction (83 young of the year) in 2018.  <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled low numbers of Channel Catfish (3) for a catch rate of 0.6/net.  The 2016 catch rate (0.9/net) was also low.  Historic catch rates from 1958 to 2018 (n=14) were mostly low, ranging from 0.0 to 5.4/net with an average of 0.7.  Channel Catfish were last stocked in 1989 and were first gill netted in 1986.  In 2018, Channel Catfish were 24.4 to 24.8 inches long with an average of 24.6.  Trap nets sampled 1 Channel Catfish that was 21.1 inches long.  Channel Catfish were not aged.  The gill and trap net size distributions indicated that recruitment was inconsistent.  Unlike Betty, Big Swan, Swan, and Hanska Lakes in the Hutchinson DNR Fisheries Management Area, Channel Catfish do not seem to be increasing in abundance at Collinwood Lake.   <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled low numbers of Yellow Perch (19) for a catch rate of 3.8/net, which was within the normal range for this type of lake and the third lowest catch ever measured at Collinwood.  The 2012, 2014, and 2016 catch rates were also fairly low (4.6, 5.4, and 1.3/net, respectively).  Catch rates from 1958 to 2018 (n=14) were highly variable ranging from 0.3 to 81.7/net with an average of 24.2.  Gill netted Yellow Perch were 5.6 to 10.1 inches long with an average of 8.4.  Yellow Perch were not aged.   <br> \n <br> \nTrap nets sampled high numbers of Common Carp (42) for a catch rate of 5.3/net, which was well above the lake's normal range.  Historic TN catch rates (n=14) from 1958 to 2018 were mostly high, ranging from 2.0 to 26.7/net with an average of 7.4.  Trap netted Common Carp were 15.0 to 31.1 inches long with an average of 21.5.  Gill nets sampled high numbers of Common Carp (41) for a catch rate of 8.2/net, which was above the lake's normal range.  Historic GN catch rates were mostly high, ranging from 0.4 to 11.5/net with an average of 6.2.  Gill netted Common Carp were 15.7 to 27.7 inches long with an average of 21.2.  Size frequency data indicated that multiple year classes were present.  In 2018, Common Carp made up the most pounds/set for both GN and TN's.  High numbers of Common Carp, over the last 60 years, have likely had significant negative impacts on submergent plant abundance and water quality in Collinwood Lake.  Common Carp would be difficult to control due to the highly connected watershed to the southwest, via Maple and Silver Creeks.  Common Carp young of the year were not sampled during the IBI sampling. <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled low numbers (1) of Black Bullhead for a catch rate of 0.2/net, which was below the lake's normal range and the second lowest on record.  The 2016 catch rate was 0.0/net.  Historic catch rates from 1958 to 2018 (n=14) were highly variable, ranging from 0.0 to 281.2/net with an average of 57.4.  In 2018, TN's sampled 5 Black Bullhead for a catch rate of 0.6/net which was below the lake's normal range and tied for the third lowest catch on record at Collinwood.  Trap netted Black Bullhead were 8.3 to 12.1 inches long with an average of 10.5.  In recent years, some area lakes have experienced declines in Black Bullhead abundance and a similar shift seems to have occurred at Collinwood (1995 to 2018 time period).  Since 1995, the average GN catch rate (11.4/net) was much lower than the average from the 1958 to 1991 time period (118.8/net).  Higher numbers of predatory Walleye, during the latter time period, could be partially responsible for the decline.  IBI sampling failed to sample any young of the year Black Bullhead.   <br> \nAdditional species sampled in the standard gear included; Brown Bullhead, Green Sunfish, White Sucker, and Yellow Bullhead. <br> \n <br> \nA survey of the nearshore fish community was conducted at Collinwood Lake in 2018 by Hutchinson Area Fisheries staff.  Sampling stations were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by electrofishing and seining, where possible.  Sampling captured 13 species of native fish, 1 non-native species (Common Carp), and 1 Hybrid (Hybrid Sunfish).  Bluegill, Largemouth Bass, and Walleye were the three most abundant fish sampled in the 50 foot seine. <br> \nData from this survey was combined with summer gill net and trap net data to calculate a fish based Index of Biotic Integrity (FIBI) that described the overall health of the lake.  The FIBI used fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present could help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment.  The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicated the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake.  The 2018 Collinwood FIBI score was 7, which was below the impairment threshold (45) for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes.  <br> \n  <br> \nData from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the North Fork of the Crow River Watershed assessment process, in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.  For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Collinwood is a moderate sized Lake (639 acres) located near Dassel, in Wright County.  Two state owned cement boat ramps are present.  The larger access is on the north side and a smaller access is on the southwest shore.  The Wright County Park also has a cement boat ramp, which is available on the east shore for a small fee.  A fishing pier is present at the County Park.  Collinwood has 4.92 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 28 feet.  The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has divided Minnesota's lakes into 44 different classes based on physical and chemical characteristics.  Collinwood is a class 24 lake and other similar lakes in the Hutchinson Fisheries Management Area include Belle and Big Swan, both in Meeker County.   <br> \n <br> \nAnglers seeking Walleye often mention Collinwood as being one of the top lakes in the Dassel area.  Past netting assessments indicated average to high numbers of Walleye being present many years at Collinwood.  This was again the case in 2020, with good numbers of 17 to 19 inch Walleye being sampled. Historic Northern Pike gill net catch rates have been variable at Collinwood, but numbers were high in 2020, with many fish ranging from 21 to 27 inches in length.  Pike anglers typically find some action at Collinwood. From 2014 through 2018, Black Crappie net catches have been low at Collinwood and this trend continued in 2020.  Crappie anglers may want to try nearby Long or Richardson Lakes.  Past trap net catches showed low to average numbers of Bluegill typically being present at Collinwood, but large fish (up to 8.7 inches in length), were gill netted in 2020.  Big Bluegill can be had, but you will likely have to put your time in finding them.  The Largemouth Bass population has fluctuated widely over the years at Collinwood, based on the lake's changing aquatic plant abundances, leading to generally mediocre fishing.  However, a lunker bass is not out of the question.  Shore anglers may have some luck fishing the Maple Creek inlet at the southwest public access. <br> \n <br> \nOther species that anglers may encounter include Black Bullhead, Brown Bullhead, Common Carp, Channel Catfish, Green Sunfish, Pumpkinseed, White Sucker, Yellow Bullhead, and Yellow Perch. <br> \n <br> \nPeople can have significant impacts on lakes and the fish populations they support. Over harvest, lakeshore development, removal of shoreline vegetation, and introductions of invasive species can all adversely affect fish populations. Aquatic invasive species (AIS) are moved from infested to non-infested waters by anglers, boaters, and lakeshore owners and can adversely impact lakes and fish populations. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access. If you suspect an infestation of an invasive species in this lake, save a specimen and report it to a local DNR office. Additional information on all of these topics can be found on the DNR website (www.dnr.state.mn.us) or by contacting the Hutchinson Area Fisheries office. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Collinwood is a moderate-sized lake (639 acres) located southeast of the City of Dassel on the Meeker/Wright County border. A state-owned access with a single cement boat ramp is present on the north shore. An access with a cement boat ramp is present at the Collinwood County Park on the east side of the lake. A state-owned access with a cement plank ramp and limited parking is present on the southwest side of the lake. A fishing pier is available at the county park, along with camping facilities and hiking trails. Collinwood has five miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 28 feet. The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MNDNR) has divided Minnesota's lakes into 44 different classes based on physical and chemical characteristics. Collinwood is a class 24 lake and other similar lakes in the Hutchinson Fisheries Management Area are Erie and Manuella in Meeker County. Submergent vegetation densities can vary from year to year at Collinwood, but Curlyleaf pondweed is often abundant in the shallows during May and June. A Walleye exploitation study was conducted at Collinwood Lake in 2022 and was designed to estimate how many fish are being harvested by anglers. Walleye captured during ice-out trap netting were given a jaw tag with a unique number identifying the individual fish, and anglers who catch a tagged Walleye are encouraged to send in their fish information (see MNDNR Hutchinson Area Fisheries Office webpage for more details). Tag reporting data is very useful in managing this popular species. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye were sampled in high numbers in 2022, with fish averaging 15 inches in length. The longest Walleye sampled was just over 25 inches. Walleye were age-1 to age-8 with seven year classes being present. Natural reproduction was substantial in the 2022 assessment.  <br> \n <br> \nHigh numbers of Northern Pike were gill netted this year with fish averaging 22 inches in length. Approximately 8% of pike netted were 26 inches or longer. The longest Northern Pike sampled was 33 inches. Northern pike regulations were revised at a statewide level beginning in 2018 to better accommodate regional differences in pike habitats and population abundance and size structuring. Three zones were established for northern pike with their own bag and length limit restrictions. In the north-central zone where Collinwood Lake is found, anglers can keep up to 10 northern pike, but no more than two pike larger than 26 inches; and all pike from 22 to 26 inches must be released. This zone regulation is meant to reduce small pike abundance by shifting population size structure back to more medium to large pike. <br> \n <br> \nHigh numbers of Black Crappie were netted in 2022. Most of the crappie sampled were small; only 21% of the gill net catch was 8 inches or longer. The longest Black Crappie sampled was just over 10 inches. High numbers of Yellow Perch were netted and most were small, but a few surpassed 8 inches in length. Low numbers of Channel Catfish were captured with fish averaging 15 inches in length and maxing out at almost 24 inches. <br> \n <br> \nOther fishes that anglers may encounter include Black Bullhead, Bluegill, Brown Bullhead, Common Carp, Largemouth Bass, White Sucker and Yellow Bullhead.    <br> \n <br> \nPeople can have significant impacts on lakes and the fish populations they support. Overharvest, lakeshore development, removal of shoreline vegetation, and introductions of invasive species can all adversely affect fish populations. Aquatic invasive species (AIS) are typically moved from infested to non-infested waters by anglers, boaters and lakeshore owners, and can adversely impact lakes and fish populations. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants and animals from their watercraft and drain all lake water from their boat and bait buckets before leaving the lake. If you suspect an infestation of an invasive species in this lake, save a specimen and report it to a local MNDNR office. Additional information on all of these topics can be found on the MNDNR website (www.dnr.state.mn.us) or by contacting the Hutchinson Area Fisheries office.</p>",

A total of 147 YOY were sampled for a catch rate of 147.0/hour, which was the fourth highest catch rate ever recorded at Collinwood and was within the lake's historical fourth quartile (> 56.5). The 2022 year class appears strong in abundance. In 2022, the mean length for YOY was 6.1 inches, which was within Collinwood's historical first quartile (<= 6.3), indicating slow growth (within the first quartile) for this lake. In 2022, 4 yearlings were sampled, for a catch rate of 4.0/hour, which was within Collinwood's historical third quartile (3.3 to 22.0). The mean length for the 2022 yearlings was 13.3 inches, which was within Collinwood's historic fourth quartile (> 12.4), indicating fast age-1 growth for this lake. The 2022 year class appeared abundant at the end of the first growing season but may not recruit to adulthood if the small average size compromises their ability to survive their first winter. Followup assessments will shed light on the fate of the 2022 year class.</p>",

Gill nets, trap nets, shoreline seining, vegetation sampling, and spring night-time electrofishing were all conducted to monitor the lakes physical, chemical and biological charecteristics.  Intense algal blooms are common at Collinwood Lake and water clarity was 2.5 feet during mid-July. <br> \n <br> \nCatch rates for walleye and northern pike were down when compared to the 2002 gill netting.  Moderate numbers of walleye were gill netted in 2006 (7.6/net).  Walleye were 6.9-26.1 inches long, averaging 14.2 inches.  Walleye fingerlings continue to be stocked every-other-year at Collinwood Lake, supplementing natural reproduction.  Fair numbers of northern pike were gill netted.  Pike were 20.1-30.7 inches long, averaging 24.3 inches.  Moderate numbers of yellow perch were gill netted.  Perch were 5.6-10.4 inches long, averaging 7.8 inches.  Approximately 23% of the gill netted perch were 9 inches or longer.  Fair numbers of bluegill were trap netted, but most were small, averaging 4.7 inches.  Approximately 11% of the trap net sample was 6 inches or longer.  However, large bluegill were present.  The longest bluegill sampled in the survey was 9.7 inches.  Fair to moderate numbers of black crappie were netted, but size was small.  Gill netted black crappie were 4.4-8.2 inches long, averaging 6.0 inches.  Fair to moderate numbers of largemouth bass were electrofished ranging in length from 2.8-17.6 inches and averaging 5.8 inches.  Only 9% of the bass sampled were 10 inches or longer.  Summer trap nets sampled largemouth bass up to 19.9 inches.  Gil nets and trap nets both sampled low numbers of black bullhead.  Carp numbers were high in both gill and trap nets, but this is not unusual at Collinwood Lake. <br> \n <br> \nMost aquatic plant species were ranked as rare, except for coontail and canada waterweed which were classified as common.  The maximum depth at which aquatic vegetation was sampled was 7.5 feet.  Row crop agriculture was the dominant land use in Collinwood's watershed and sediment inputs from Silver Creek, on the west shore, continue to degrade the lake.    </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A population assessment was conducted at Collinwood Lake in 2014 to monitor the fish population.  A total of 11 species were sampled in the gill nets and trap nets.  The lake was not stratified, on 7/21/14, with the dissolved oxygen concentration being 8.0 mg/l just off the bottom in 25.0 feet of water.  Water clarity was poor with a secchi disk reading of 3.2 feet, due to an algae bloom.  <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled moderate numbers of Northern Pike (46) for a catch rate of 5.8/net, which was within the normal range for this type of lake.  The 2012 catch rate was much higher at 18.9/net.  Catch rates from 1958 to 2014 (n=12) were highly variable, ranging from 0.0 to 18.9/net with an average of 6.0.  Historically, recruitment could be classified as moderate at Collinwood.  Gill netted Northern Pike were 16.5 to 27.8 inches long with an average of 22.2.  Trap nets sampled 4 northern pike with the maximum length being 32.5 inches.  Approximately 24% of the gill net catch was 24 inches or longer.  Length frequency data indicated a population of a moderate quality.  Northern pike were last stocked in 1992.  Northern Pike were age-1 to age-8 with 5 year-classes being present.  Age-3 fish were the most abundant, accounting for 43% of the gill net aged fish.  The 2011 year-class was also strong in the 2012 assessment.  Growth was fast and Northern Pike anglers should do well at Collinwood Lake. <br> \n      <br> \nTrap nets sampled low numbers of Black Crappie (7) for a catch rate of 0.8/net.  This catch rate was below the normal range for this type of lake and the lowest ever recorded at Collinwood.  The 2012 catch rate was also low (4.0/net).  Catch rates from 1958 to 2014 (n=12) were variable, ranging from 1.0 to 35.8/net with an average of 11.4.  The last three catch rates have been well below the historical average.  Trap netted Black Crappie were 4.5 to 10.2 inches long with an average of 7.1.  Gill nets also sampled low numbers of Black Crappie (14) for a catch rate of 1.8/net, which was below the normal range for this type of lake.  The 2012 gill net catch rate was 5.7/net.  Catch rates from 1958 to 2014 (n=12) were highly variable, ranging from 1.2 to 75.0/net with an average of 24.5.  The last four catch rates (2002 to 2014) have been below the historical average.  Gill netted black crappie were 4.1 to 11.7 inches long with an average of 8.4.      <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled high numbers of Walleye (108) for a catch rate of 13.5/net, which was above the normal range for this type of lake.  Walleye were the most abundant fish sampled in the gill nets in 2014.  The 2012 catch rate was 8.8/net.  Catch rates from 1958 to 2014 (n=12), under various stocking regimes, were highly variable ranging from 2.1 to 25.3/net with an average of 11.4.  The latest six catch rates were all above the normal range for this type of lake.  Gill netted walleye were 8.4 to 24.5 inches long with an average of 17.2.  Approximately 85% of the gill net catch was 16 inches or longer, indicating a quality size structure.  Walleye were estimated to be age-1 to age-6 with 6 year-classes present.  The 2011 year-class was strong, accounting for 77% of the catch.  Of that 77%, the portions from stocking (fingerlings) and/or natural reproduction were unknown, due to documented natural reproduction in past years.  Non-stocked year-classes (naturally produced) accounted for 8% of the gill net aged walleye.  In 2014, growth was fast.  The current stocking regime of 1,000 fry/littoral acre (acres less than 15 feet in depth) annually was initiated in 2013, with hopes of developing multiple strong year-classes in each assessment.  Fall electrofishing assessments in 2013 and 2014 indicated that strong Walleye year-classes were produced both years.   <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled high numbers of Channel Catfish (43) for a catch rate of 5.4/net.  The 2014 catch rate was the highest ever recorded at Collinwood and was five times higher than the 2012 catch (0.9/net).  Historic catch rates (n=12) ranged from 0.0 to 5.4/net with an average of 0.7.   After being present in the lake at low levels for almost 30 years the catch rate jumped dramatically in 2014.  Channel Catfish were last stocked in 1989.  In 2012, channel catfish were 15.9 to 25.4 inches long with an average of 18.3.   Channel Catfish fight hard and are a highly desired table fare in many parts of the United States.      <br> \n  <br> \nTrap nets sampled low numbers of Bluegill (13) for a catch rate of 1.4/net which was below the normal range and the lowest ever recorded at Collinwood.  The 2012 catch rate was much higher at 15.4/net.  Catch rates from 1958 to 2014 (n=14) were variable, ranging from 1.4 to 28.2/net, with an average of 10.8.  Catch rates were higher in the 1990's and 2000's (except for 2014) compared to the 1970's and 1980's, possibly showing some type of an ecological shift.  Bluegill were last stocked in 1990.  In 2014, trap netted bluegill were 5.5 to 8.2 inches long with an average of 7.3.         <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled low numbers of Yellow Perch (43) for a catch rate of 5.4/net, but this was within the normal range for this type of lake.  The 2012 catch rate was similar at 4.6/net.  Catch rates from 1958 to 2014 (n=12) were highly variable ranging from 0.3 to 81.7/net with an average of 27.8.  Yellow perch were 4.7 to 8.1 inches long with an average of 6.6.  Yellow Perch were too small to interest most anglers, but were likely an important forage item for predator fish at Collinwood Lake.    <br> \n <br> \nTrap nets sampled high numbers of Common Carp (38) for a catch rate of 4.2/net, which was above the normal range for this type of lake.  Common Carp were the most abundant fish sampled in the trap nets, in 2014.  Historic catch rates (n=12) from 1958 to 2014 were mostly high, ranging from 2.0 to 26.7/net with an average of 7.6.  Trap netted Common Carp were 18.9 to 31.9 inches long with an average of 22.5.  Gill nets also sampled high numbers of Common Carp (36) for a catch rate of 4.5/net, which was above the normal range for this type of lake.  Historic catch rates were mostly high, ranging from 0.4 to 11.5/net with an average of 6.3.  Gill netted Common Carp were 18.5 to 27.9 with an average of 21.9.  High numbers of Common Carp, over the last 50+ years, have likely had significant negative impacts on submergent plant abundance and water quality in Collinwood Lake.  Multiple connections to other lakes and wetlands makes the management of Common Carp quite difficult at Collinwood Lake. <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled low numbers of Black Bullhead (7) for a catch rate of 0.9/net, which was below the normal range for this type of lake and the lowest ever recorded at Collinwood.  The 2012 catch rate was much higher at 36.1/net.  Historic catch rates from 1958 to 2014 (n=12) were highly variable, ranging from 0.9 to 281.2/net with an average of 67.0.  Trap nets sampled 1 Black Bullhead for a catch rate of 0.1/net which was below the normal range for this type of lake and the lowest ever recorded at Collinwood.  Gill netted Black Bullhead were 5.3 to 10.9 inches long with an average of 9.6.  In recent years, many area lakes have experienced declines in Black Bullhead abundance and a shift also seems to have occurred at Collinwood (1995 to 2014).  From 1995 to 2014 the average gill net catch rate was 15.2/net.  The average from the 1958 to 1991 time period was much higher at 118.8/net.      <br> \n</p>",

Walleye were a primary management species at Collinwood.  Electrofishing sampled 28 YWAE for a catch rate of 10.2/hour, which likely indicated a weak year class.  Since fry were not stocked in 2017, those fish resulted from natural reproduction.  The average length of YWAE was 7.7 inches in 2017, and indicated fast growth for Collinwood Lake Walleye.  The latest stocking regime (351,000 fry 1 in 2 years) was initiated in 2016, with a goal of producing strong year classes and leaving blank years to promote continued strong growth and for evaluation of natural reproduction.  Fry will be stocked in 2018 and 2020.  Fall electrofishing catch rates from 1993 to 2017 (n=23) ranged from 1.5 to 541.5/hour with an average of 67.1.  Catch rates from fry stocked years (n=3) ranged from 69.0 to 324.8/hour with an average of 205.3.  Catch rates from non-fry stocked years (n=20) ranged from 1.5 to 541.5/hour with an average of 46.4.  The median natural reproduction catch rate (15.4/hour) was over fourteen times lower than the median fry stocked years catch rate (222.0/hour), indicating that the fry stockings were extremely successful.  A definitive answer could not be reached because of the inability to differentiate stocked fish from naturally reproduced fish during fry stocked years.  Walleye natural reproduction has been documented in 20 out of 20 (100%) of the non-fry stocked assessment years at Collinwood Lake, but only the 2001 YWAE year class was considered to be exceptionally strong (541.5/hour).  The 2017 YRLWAE catch rate was 30.9/hour, suggesting a moderate to strong sized 2016 year class.  The YRLWAE had an average length of 11.5 inches.  The 2016 year class should be of a more acceptable size to anglers by the end of 2018. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of the nearshore fish community on Collinwood Lake was conducted on August 7, 2018 by Fisheries Lake IBI program staff. Sampling stations were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot beach seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at all 14 stations with one site sampled from the boat.  Soft sediments with abundant emergent vegetation in deep water prevented the use of seines at one sampling site. Nearshore sampling captured 14 native species of fish with Bluegill, Green Sunfish Largemouth Bass, and Yellow Perch most commonly sampled. <br> \n <br> \nData from this targeted nearshore survey is combined with data from a standard gill and trap netting survey to calculate a Fish-based Index of Biologic Integrity (FIBI) score that describes the overall health of the lake. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment.  In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g. Tadpole Madtom and Iowa Darter), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g. Green Sunfish, Black Bullhead).  The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. The FIBI score for Collinwood Lake based on this survey is well below the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes, indicating poor water quality and habitat conditions exist for aquatic life.  Potential contributors to degraded habitat and water quality include land use practices and development in the watershed and around the lakeshore.  Invasive species such as Common Carp can also contribute to degraded water quality and habitat by uprooting aquatic vegetation.  Data from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the North Fork Crow River Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.   For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website. <br> \n</p>",

The same is true of walleye, which were quite abundant, especially age 3 and 4.  Their growth rate was average.  Northern pike were found in average numbers and showed excellent growth.  The sample of largemouth bass was very small, indicating a lack of this species. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A standard survey was conducted at Collinwood in 2016 to monitor the lake's fish population.  A total of 12 species were sampled in the gill nets, trap nets, and by spring night-time electrofishing.  The lake was not stratified on 7/11/16, with the dissolved oxygen concentration being 2.8 mg/l just off the bottom in 26.0 feet of water, allowing fish to use all parts of the lake.  Water clarity was poor with a secchi disk reading of 4.0 feet, due to an algae bloom.  A fishing pier was available to anglers at the Wright County Park on the east side of the lake.    <br> \n <br> \nIn 2016, gill nets sampled lower numbers of Northern Pike (4.1/net), which was within the normal range for lakes similar to Collinwood.  The 2014 catch rate was similar at 5.8/net.  Catch rates from 1958 to 2016 (n=13) were highly variable, ranging from 0.0 to 18.9/net with an average of 5.9.  Historically, recruitment could be classified as moderate at Collinwood Lake.  A large and highly connected watershed, to the southwest, allows Northern Pike to move into many different lakes (Maple, Big Wolf, Jennie, Todd, Hook, Pigeon, and Jewitt) and shallow wetlands (possibly high quality spawning habitat), freely when water levels are high enough.  Several of those mentioned lakes have had high numbers of Northern Pike in recent years.  In 2016, gill netted Northern Pike were 17.4 to 30.8 inches long with an average of 21.1.  Approximately 51% of the gill net sample was 21 inches or longer, but only three fish were 25 inches or longer.  Northern Pike were last stocked in 1992 and natural reproduction has provided a sufficient fishery for many years.  Northern Pike were age-1 to age-4, with four year classes being present.  Age-2 fish were the most abundant, accounting for 59% of the gill net aged fish.  Growth was moderate to fast, with age-2 fish reaching 19.0 inches after two summers of growth.    <br> \n    <br> \nTrap nets did not sample any Black Crappie in 2016.  This was the lowest catch rate on record at Collinwood Lake.  The 2012 catch rate was also low (4.0/net).  Catch rates from 1958 to 2016 (n=13) were variable, ranging from 0.0 to 35.8/net with an average of 10.5.  Gill nets sampled low numbers of Black Crappie (5) for a catch rate of 0.6/net, which was below the normal range for this type of lake and the lowest ever recorded at Collinwood.  Catch rates from 1958 to 2016 (n=13) were highly variable, ranging from 0.6 to 75.0/net with an average of 22.7.  The last six gill net catch rates (1999 to 2016) have been decreasing, possibly indicating a downward trend in relative abundance.  Gill netted black crappie were 7.8 to 10.8 inches long with an average of 9.2. Black crappie were age-2 and age-3, indicating very poor recruitment.  Growth was fast.  The decline in Black Crappie relative abundance since 1999 was of concern and the trend was likely related to competition, forage, and/or predation.  From 1995 to 2016 the relative abundance of Walleye, a known predator on small Black Crappie, has been on the high side, averaging 14.2/gill net.  Spawning habitat was believed to be sufficient for Black Crappie at Collinwood Lake.  Since Black Crappie have such high reproductive potential they were rarely limited by reproduction. <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled high numbers of Walleye (88) for a catch rate of 9.8/net, which was above the normal range for lakes similar to Collinwood.  Walleye were the most abundant fish sampled by gill nets in 2016.  The 2014 catch rate was also high (13.5/net).  The latest seven gill net catch rates were all above the normal range.  Catch rates from 1958 to 2016 (n=13), under various stocking regimes, were highly variable ranging from 2.1 to 25.3/net with an average of 11.3.  In 2016, gill netted walleye were 10.2 to 26.0 inches long with an average of 15.0.  Approximately 44% of the gill net catch was 14 inches or longer, while 18% were 20 inches or longer, indicating a quality size structure.  Walleye were estimated to be age-2 to age-9 with seven year classes present.  Only the 2014 year class was ranked as strong, accounting for 55% of the catch.  The contribution from natural reproduction during stocked years (fry and fingerling) was unknown.  Skip years (non-stocked) in the stocking regimes accounted for 9% of gill net aged walleye.  In 2016, growth was fast for older year classes, but slow for age-2 fish.  It was likely that after two strong year classes were produced in a row (2013 and 2014) the lake's forage base was greatly suppressed, explaining the slow growth of the 2014 year class.  Gill net catch rates from 1995 to 2014 (n=6) during the old stocking regime (1991 through 2011 - 351 pounds of fingerlings every other year) ranged from 7.6 to 25.3/net with an average of 14.9.  The current stocking regime (351,000 fry every year) was initiated in 2013, with hopes of developing stronger year classes at Collinwood.  Gill netting in 2016 (fry regime) produced a catch rate of 9.8/net.  Fall electrofishing assessments, targeting young of the year Walleye, in 2013, 2014, and 2016 (fry stocked years) produced three out of four of the highest catch rates on record.  The average fall electrofishing catch rate from fingerling stocked and skip years was 48.3/hr., while the average from fry stocked years was 205.3/hr., indicating that fry stocking was capable of producing large young of the year Walleye catches.  Fry were not stocked in 2015 in order to slow the predation demand of young walleyes on the lake's forage base.        <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled low numbers of Channel Catfish (8) for a catch rate of 0.9/net.  The 2014 catch rate was six times higher (5.4/net).  Historic catch rates (n=13) were generally low, ranging from 0.0 to 5.4/net with an average of 0.7.  Channel Catfish were last stocked in 1989 and were first gill netted in 1986.  In 2016, Channel Catfish were 20.4 to 24.4 inches long with an average of 22.7.  The gill and trap net size distributions indicated that reproduction was inconsistent.   <br> \n <br> \nTrap nets sampled low numbers of Bluegill (12) for a catch rate of 1.3/net which was below the normal range for lakes similar to Collinwood and the lowest ever recorded at Collinwood.  The 2014 catch rate was similar at 1.4/net and the second lowest on record.  The last five catch rates (1999 to 2016) all were decreasing, showing a possible negative trend in relative abundance.  Catch rates from 1958 to 2016 (n=15) were variable, ranging from 1.3 to 28.2/net, with an average of 10.1.  In 2016, trap netted bluegill were 3.5 to 9.3 inches long with an average of 5.9.  Bluegill were age-1 to age-6 with five year classes being present.  Data indicated that recruitment was inconsistent.  Inadequate natural reproduction was seldom a problem for Bluegill and quality spawning substrates are common at Collinwood.  Aquatic vegetation (submergent and emergent) provides cover and feeding grounds for young Bluegill.  Collinwood's marginal aquatic plant community is likely a major limiting factor on this species.  Lake shore owners are encouraged to preserve what little aquatic vegetation is present.  Curlyleaf Pondweed can provide some cover during May and June, but when it senesces in July, young fish likely become more vulnerable to predation.   <br> \n <br> \nSpring night-time electrofishing sampled 7 Largemouth Bass for a catch rate of 6.2/hr., which was the second lowest on record for Collinwood Lake.  The 2011 catch rate was the lowest on record (2.7/hr.).  Catch rates (n=8) from 1991 to 2016 were variable, ranging from 2.7 to 41.3/hr. with an average of 17.2.  Largemouth Bass were 9.1 to 16.2 inches long with an average of 12.2.  Largemouth Bass (electrofished and trap netted) were age-2 to age-7 with five year classes present.  Growth was moderate.  Data indicated inconsistent recruitment for this species.  Largemouth Bass were likely not doing well for the same reasons that the Bluegill were not flourishing; there is marginal submergent vegetation which provides cover and feeding grounds for young fish.   <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled low numbers of Yellow Perch (12) for a catch rate of 1.3/net, which was below the normal range for lakes similar to Collinwood and the second lowest ever measured at Collinwood.  The 2012 and 2014 catch rates were also low, 4.6 and 5.4/net, respectively.  Data indicated a decline in relative abundance in recent years.  Catch rates from 1958 to 2016 (n=13) were highly variable ranging from 0.3 to 81.7/net with an average of 25.7.  Yellow Perch were 7.5 to 9.8 inches long with an average of 8.5.  Yellow Perch were age-3 to age-5 with three year classes present.  Approximately 82% of the fish were from the 2013 year-class.  Recruitment appeared to have been very poor in 2014.  Strong Walleye year classes in 2013 and 2014 were likely at least partially responsible for the declining Yellow Perch population at Collinwood. <br> \n <br> \nTrap nets sampled high numbers of Common Carp (60) for a catch rate of 6.7/net, which was well above the normal range for lakes similar to Collinwood.  Common Carp were the most abundant fish sampled in the trap nets.  Historic catch rates (n=13) from 1958 to 2016 were mostly high, ranging from 2.0 to 26.7/net with an average of 7.5.  Trap netted Common Carp were 11.3 to 32.4 inches long with an average of 21.7.  Gill nets sampled moderate numbers of Common Carp (25) for a catch rate of 2.8/net, which was within the normal range for this type of lake.  Historic gill net catch rates were mostly high, ranging from 0.4 to 11.5/net with an average of 6.0.  Gill netted Common Carp were 7.8 to 27.9 with an average of 22.3.  Size distribution data indicated that multiple year classes were present.  High numbers of Common Carp, over the last 50+ years, have likely had significant negative impacts on submergent plant abundance and water quality in Collinwood Lake.  Common Carp would be extremely difficult to control due to the highly connected watershed to the southwest, via Maple and Silver Creeks. <br> \nGill nets failed to sample Black Bullhead in 2016 and this was the lowest catch rate (0.0/net) ever recorded at Collinwood.  The 2014 catch rate (0.9/net) was the second lowest on record.  Historic catch rates from 1958 to 2016 (n=13) were highly variable, ranging from 0.0 to 281.2/net with an average of 61.8.  Trap nets sampled 3 Black Bullhead for a catch rate of 0.3/net which was below the normal range for lakes similar to Collinwood and the second lowest on record at Collinwood.  Trap netted Black Bullhead were 13.3 to 13.5 inches long with an average of 13.4.  In recent years, some area lakes have experienced declines in Black Bullhead abundance and a similar shift seems to have occurred at Collinwood (1995 to 2016 time period).  Since 1995, the average gill net catch rate (13.0/net) was much lower than the average from the 1958 to 1991 time period (118.8/net).  Higher numbers of predatory Walleye, during the latter time period, could be partially responsible for the decline.     <br> \n <br> \nAdditional species sampled in the standard gear included; Bowfin, White Sucker, and Yellow Bullhead.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Fall electrofishing was conducted at Collinwood Lake on September 10, 2018 to evaluate young of the year Walleye (YWAE) and yearling Walleye (YRLWAE) abundance.  Electrofishing sampled 284 YWAE for a catch rate of 142.0/hour, indicating a strong year class.  Since walleye fry were stocked in 2018, it was unknown if fall young-of-year walleye catch resulted from the stocking, natural reproduction, or some combination of both.  In 2018, the average length of YWAE was 6.1 inches, indicating slow growth for Collinwood Lake YWAE. Likely reasons could include high YWAE abundance and competition as well as a shorter growing season due to late ice-out.  The latest stocking regime (638,000 fry every other year) was initiated in 2016 with a goal of producing stronger year classes while not depleting the lake's forage base.  Fall electrofishing YWAE catch rates from 1993 to 2018 (n=24) ranged from 1.5 to 541.5/hour with an average of 70.2.  Fry stocked years (2013, 2014, 216, and 2018) accounted for four out of five of the highest YWAE catch rates at Collinwood.  Catch rates (YWAE) from fry stocked years (n=4) ranged from 69.0 to 324.8/hour with an average of 189.5.  Young of the year Walleye catch rates from non-fry stocked years (n=20) ranged from 1.5 to 541.5/hour with an average of 46.4.  The average natural reproduction catch rate (46.4/hour) was over four times lower than the average fry stocked years YWAE catch rate (189.5/hour).  Determining contribution of natural reproduction during stocked years has not occurred because of the inability to differentiate between stocked and non-stocked YWAE.  Walleye natural reproduction has been documented in 20 out of 20 of the non-fry stocked assessment years (100%) at Collinwood Lake, but only the 2001 YWAE year class was considered to be exceptionally strong (541.5/hour).  In 2018, the YRLWAE catch rate was 1.5/hour, likely indicating a weak 2017 year class.  In 2018, the YRLWAE (2017 year class) had an average length of 12.5 inches, indicating fast growth.  Historic YRLWAE catch rates (n=2) ranged from 1.5 to 30.9/hour.  In 2018, YWAE ranged in length from 5.2 to 7.1 inches; YRLWAE ranged in length from 12.3 to 12.7 inches; age-2 Walleye ranged in length from 12.8 to 14.6 inches; and the one age-3 Walleye collected was 14.7 inches in length.</p>",

Northern pike are more abundant at just over sever per gillnet lift with all sizes and ages well represented.  Yellow perch were also abundant at nearly 45/gillnet.  Trapnet catches show the black crappie to be abundant at 35.8/lift.  Growth is average and the sample was composed of age I-III fish.  Fishing has been good for crappies throughout 1981.  Local residents say the bluegill was formerly more abundant, but during the assessment, only 2.5 were taken per trapnet.  My observation is that carp were more abundant than in past surveys, and the average size being 16 inches in length.   <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Collinwood Lake is a 636 acre lake with a maximum depth of 28 feet.  It is located on the border of Wright and Meeker counties, south of Dassel.  Collinwood suffers from degraded water quality, algal blooms and sparse submerged aquatic plant growth.  These factors may combine to limit the fishery potential.  There is a Wright County Park on the east side that offers camping and a boat ramp.  There are also two state-owned access ramps.  As with many area lakes, fish populations fluctuate widely but angling for panfish can be good at times.  The black crappie trapnet catch was near the lake class median.  Black crappie sampled in trapnets ranged in length from 4 to 9 inches and average length was 6.6 inches.  The bluegill trapnet catch rate of 13.3 per net was below the lake class median, but within the normal range.  Bluegill sampled in trapnets ranged in length from 3 to 8 inches and average length was 4.5 inches.  Similar to black crappie, the present age structure was dominated by young fish and resulted in the small average size.  These two species should provide good angling in the next several years.  The black bullhead net catches were near the lake class medians and many were nice size.  The average length sampled in gillnets was 9.8 inches.  Black bullhead this size should be desirable to anglers.  Yellow perch were abundant.  The gillnet catch rate of 81.7 per net was above the normal range for this lake class.  Yellow perch sampled in gillnets ranged in length from 5 to 10 inches and average length was 7 inches.  Most were age 1 and 2 and should provide good angling in the next several years.     Largemouth bass are present and nice sized fish are caught every year.  The average length of bass sampled in spring electrofishing was 12.9 inches.  The northern pike gillnet catch rate of 3.8 per net was at the lake class median.  Northern pike sampled in gillnets ranged in length from 17 to 35 inches and average length was 23.9 inches.  The walleye gillnet catch rate of 12.0 per net was above the normal range for this lake class.  Walleye sampled in gillnets ranged in length from 11 to 25 inches and average length was 16.4 inches.  Reports indicate that Collinwood usually provides good angling for walleye.</p>",
