                "narrative": "<p>Wilson Lake is a 170 acre lake on the edge of the city of Lake Wilson in Murray County.  Past management of the lake included black crappie, yellow perch, and black bullhead.  Rising water levels and better oxygen levels over the past few years prompted us to stock walleye fingerlings in 1999.  The lake did suffer a partial winterkill during the winter of 2000-2001.The yellow perch catch rate was good compared to lakes like Wilson.  The majority of the fish were from 7 to 8 inches in length.  The largest yellow perch sampled was just over 13 inches.  Yellow perch should provide good fishing opportunities in the near future.The black crappie catch rate was low compared to similar lakes.  Only two black crappie were sampled during the survey and they were both close to 12 inches.  We may need to stock additional adults if we choose to continue black crappie management.The walleye catch rate was fairly low compared to other lakes like Wilson.  This may be in part because of the partial winterkill.  The walleye population originated from the stocking in 1999 and averaged about 15 inches in length.Black bullheads have typically been a popular fish for local anglers.  The present population is high for lakes like Wilson.  Lengths of black bullhead averaged about 9 inches.To promote and maintain healthy fish populations, pollution and other inputs need to be controlled.  Fish habitats are directly affected by water quality.  Nutrient, sediment and other waste inputs can drastically alter the biological, chemical, and physical components of a lake.  It is paramount to maintain if not improve the current water qaulity of Wilson Lake through watershed management to preserve this fishery for future generations to enjoy.</p>",

The lake is divided into a north lake and a south lake by Minnesota State Highway 30 with no observable direct connection between the lakes.  However, it is believed that there is a culvert under Hwy 30 but possibly buried in rock and likely preventing fish movement but allows water equalization between the basins.  Both basins are aerated by PowerHouse Ice Eaters by the Lake Wilson Sportsman's Club.  Despite aeration, the south basin of Lake Wilson experienced a fish kill during the winter of 2018-2019.  Dead fish were present in the aeration hole and at ice-off in the spring of that year.  Again, during the winter of 2022-2023, southern Minnesota experienced a harsh winter and 75 lakes had verified winterkill at varying levels (light, moderate, major). However, Lake Wilson did not experience another winterkill that year and was spared. Walleye fry (N=90,000 Lower Mississippi Strain) were stocked during the spring of 2023.  An electrofishing survey was conducted on September 21, 2023 to determine the success of the Walleye fry stocking. Other southern Minnesota lakes were very successful.  <br> \n <br> \nEleven minutes of daytime electrofishing was conducted near the public access of North Wilson Lake. Only age-0 Walleye were dipped and measured (N=134), however many (estimated more than 30) adult Walleye of sizes ranging from 15 to 25 inches were observed. Age-0 Walleye ranged from 6.0 to 7.7 inches with an average length of 7.2 inches. If the number of fish caught in 11 minutes of on-time was extrapolated to 1 hour of daytime electrofishing, then it would have been possible that the catch rate could have exceeded 700 per hour. The fry stocking appeared to be very successful. A full standard survey will be conducted during the summer of 2025 at which point the relative abundance of the Walleye population will be evaluated.     <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

It appears that Lake Wilson experienced a partial winterkill that affected species such as Crappie and Yellow Perch.  Walleye fry were stocked in the spring of 2019 to get some predators back in the lake for rough fish control.  During fall electrofishing, age-0 Walleye were sampled at a rate of 25 per hour, which had potential to produce a decent year class.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Wilson is a 170-acre lake located in the southwest corner of Murray County.  The water level of Lake Wilson has fluctuated over the years, but has stabilized within the last 10 years.  The lake is bisected by highway 30 with a culvert under the road, which allows free flow of water between the two basins.  Although water moves between the basins, it is believed that the riprap prevents fish movement.  Because of the water fluctuations over the years, no defined outlet, and a state highway bisecting the lake, most of the shoreline has riprap to prevent erosion.  Most of the active fish management and all of the survey work occur in the north basin.  The long-term data from fish sampling on Lake Wilson is not as robust compared to many other lakes in the Windom Area.  The initial survey was conducted in 1989, which documented exceptional water clarity (Secchi disk > 7.0 feet) and good abundance of macrophytes.  Since 1997, a helixor aeration system has been able to maintain higher winter dissolved oxygen and the lake has not been open to liberalized fishing since the change in aeration.  Because there was local interest in managing the lake for walleye and in an effort to control black bullhead abundance, walleye was added as a species of secondary management.  Lake Wilson is managed primarily for yellow perch and secondarily for black bullhead, black crappie, and walleye.  A resurvey was conducted during the week of June 6, 2007 using two gill nets, six trap nets, and two seine hauls. <br> \n <br> \nLake Wilson has never had higher catch rates of yellow perch.  The yellow perch catch rate (58.5/set) in gill nets was twice the expected range.  Total lengths ranged from 5 to 12 inches with an average of 8.5 inches.  Not only are the fish abundant, but also 68% of the fish were eight inches or greater.  The condition indices allude to very plump fish with good growth rates.  Most of the fish were 2, 3, and 5 years old.  There is no question that this lake is a \"sleeper\" for a quality day of perch fishing.   <br> \n <br> \nNot only are the perch abundant, but also the walleye catch rate (24.5/set) in 2007 was the highest ever recorded and 8 times higher than any of the previous surveys.  Lake Wilson has only been stocked with walleyes 3 times, with the initial stocking of fingerlings in 1999.  Total lengths ranged from 13 to 26 inches with a mean of 15 inches.  Good growth rates, good condition indices, and highest abundance ever sampled, suggest this would be a great lake for fishing.  A majority of the fish sampled (74%) were 2 years old and likely from the fingerling stocking in 2005.  An angler could make a day out of fishing Lake Wilson by fishing the yellow perch in the afternoon and staying through sunset for the walleye bite.  There is a good chance the walleye that are caught could be \"eaters\".   <br> \n <br> \nThe black crappie catch rate in trap nets was 13.5/set, which equal the highest catch rate ever documented.  Total lengths range from 8.0 to 12 inches with a mean of 10 inches.  Sixty-six percent of the fish were 10 inches or greater.  As with the walleye and yellow perch population, good abundance, condition, and size structure could provide some good action and a real possibility of taking some fillets home for a meal.   <br> \n <br> \nThe catch rate of black bullheads in trap nets was 68.0/set, compared to the 1995 and 2001 assessments, which documented over 300/trap.  Although the population was dominated by smaller-sized fish (average length=7.7 inches), it is likely black bullheads would provide some fishing action for kids and adults alike.   <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled were brown bullhead, fathead minnow, green sunfish, orangespotted sunfish, and white sucker.  This is one of few lakes in the Windom Fish Management Area that has never documented the presence of common carp.  The absence of common carp may be a contributing factor to the 80% frequency of occurrence of sago pondweed. <br> \n <br> \nEfforts to improve the health of the lake should focus on best management practices within the watershed.  Improvements and education in land stewardship will often have secondary benefits to the lake in the way of quality and quantity of habitat.  Generally, improvements in the quality and quantity of lake habitat will mean direct improvements of the fishery. <br> \n <br> \nPrepared by <br> \nRyan Doorenbos <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>INTRODUCTION <br> \nLake Wilson is a 170-acre lake located near the City of Lake Wilson in southwest Murray County. Lake Wilson is relatively shallow, having a maximum depth of 8.0 feet. At the time of the assessment, water clarity was 2.5 feet. Lake Wilson is highly productive, likely a result of excessive nutrient runoff from the agriculture dominated watershed and from the impervious surfaces in the City of Lake Wilson. Low dissolve oxygen readings have been documented during several years in Lake Wilson, with the last suspected winterkill occurring during the winter of 2000 and 2001. Because of the likeliness to winterkill, management species were switched from largemouth bass and bluegill to yellow perch and walleye. Lake Wilson is aerated, which has aided in stabilizing the fish community. Currently, yellow perch is the primary management species in Lake Wilson, with black crappie and walleye being managed secondarily. The yellow perch population has been self-sustaining, as they have not been stocked since 1993. Black crappies are also mostly self-sustaining, with the last stocking occurring in 2003 and 2005. Extensive walleye stocking has occurred in Lake Wilson as fingerlings have been stocked in 2005, 2008, and 2011. A population assessment was conducted during the week of June 10, 2013 to monitor fish populations using two gill nets and six trap nets.  <br> \n <br> \nYELLOW PERCH  <br> \nYellow perch catch rates had been on the upswing since 2001 when they were captured at a rate of 25.0 per gill net. Similarly, in 2007, yellow perch abundance was the highest ever documented in Lake Wilson at 58.5 per gill net. In 2013, zero yellow perch were sampled in gill nets or trap nets. Yellow perch populations tend to be highly variable, which is reflected in the catches of yellow perch in Lake Wilson. Yellow perch populations can follow a pattern where a strong year class is produced and then followed by one to two years of little to no reproduction, resulting in a boom or bust fishery.  Boom and bust fish populations can be put under more stress if they are overharvested, or if they are utilized as prey, things that yellow perch could experience in Lake Wilson.  <br> \n <br> \nBLACK CRAPPIE <br> \nBlack crappie trap net catch rates have varied greatly in Lake Wilson, ranging from 0.2 per trap net in 2013 to 13.6 per trap net in 1989 and averaging 6.9 per trap net over that same time frame. Three black crappies were sampled in 2013 gill nets and trap nets, which is the lowest number sampled since surveys began. The 2013 catch rate of 0.2 per trap net is well below the expected range of catch rates (1.2 to 20.5 per trap net) for similar lakes.  <br> \n <br> \nWALLEYE <br> \nWalleyes were first stocked in Lake Wilson in 1999, as management practices switched from a largemouth bass and bluegill fishery to species that are slightly more tolerant of low oxygen conditions. Since the initial stocking of walleyes, catch rates have varied from 0.0 per gill net in 2001 to 24.5 per gill net in 2007. Since the record high catch rate observed in 2007, catch rates have come back down to more realistic levels. In 2013, walleyes were captured at a rate of 3.5 per gill net, which is in the expected range of catch rates (2.3 to 18.1 per gill net) for similar lakes. Trap net catch rates, also indicated a decent population of walleyes, as they were captured at a rate of 2.3 per trap net which is high when compared to similar lakes. Walleyes were large, ranging in length from 14.2 to 28.7 inches and averaging 20.1 inches. Two ages of walleyes were sampled (age-2 and age-5) and corresponded to years in which stocking occurred (2008 and 2011). Walleyes appear to grow fast in Lake Wilson, as lengths averaged 10.2 inches at age-1, 13.5 inches at age-2, 16.0 inches at age-3, 18.6 inches at age-4, and 20.2 inches at age-5. Walleyes were plump, indicating that sufficient prey is available in Lake Wilson. Although the catch rate is down from 2007, the walleye population in Lake Wilson appears to be relatively stable, as multiple year classes and multiple sizes of walleyes were present.       <br> \n <br> \nBLACK BULLHEAD <br> \nThe 2013 black bullhead catch rate (89.0 per gill net) was within the expected range (30.3 to 150.6 per gill net) of catch rates for similar lakes. Black bullheads ranged in size from 5.0 to 15.6 inches and averaged 9.0 inches. Since the last survey in 2007, size structure of black bullheads has increased. Both gill net and trap net catch rates of black bullhead were down from the 2007 survey, which could be the result of the abundant walleye population documented in 2007, or the result of a partial winterkill that may have occurred since the last survey.  <br> \n <br> \nCOMMON CARP <br> \nCommon carp have been absent in Lake Wilson since surveys began in 1989. In 2013, common carp were relatively abundant at 13.5 per gill net, which is high when compared to similar lakes, and 18.8 per trap net, which is very high compared to similar lakes. Common carp ranged from 12.8 to 18.5 inches and averaged 15.8 inches in length. Common carp likely got into Lake Wilson during a high water event in the spring of 2012, when they were documented coming through an agricultural drainage (tiling) near the baseball fields by the northwest end of the lake. <br> \n <br> \nOTHER SPECIES <br> \nTwo channel catfish were captured in gill nets, which is the first time that channel catfish have been sampled in Lake Wilson. The channel catfish were 18.9 and 19.2 inches in length. Channel catfish can be effective at controlling bullhead populations, so it will be interesting to see how the channel catfish population in Lake Wilson affects the black bullhead population. Channel catfish also likely entered the lake during the high water event in the spring of 2012. <br> \n <br> \nWhite suckers were captured at rates of 15.5 per gill net and 2.3 per trap net, both record high catch rates for Lake Wilson. White suckers ranged in length from 10.4 to 19.3 inches and averaged 15.0 inches. <br> \n  <br> \nOther species sampled included one 27.2 inch northern pike, and one yellow bullhead.  <br> \n <br> \nShoreline areas on the land and into the shallow water provide essential habitat for fish and wildlife that live in or near Minnesota's lakes.  Overdeveloped shorelines cannot support the fish, wildlife, and clean water that are associated with natural undeveloped lakes.  Shoreline habitat consists of aquatic plants, woody plants, and natural lake bottom soils.  <br> \n <br> \nPlants in the water and at the water's edge provide habitat, prevent erosion, and absorb excess nutrients.  Shrubs, trees, and woody debris such as fallen trees or limbs provide good habitat both above and below the water and should be left in place.  By leaving a buffer strip of natural vegetation along the shoreline, property owners can reduce erosion, help maintain or improve water quality, and provide habitat and travel corridors for wildlife. <br> \n <br> \nBest management practices within the watershed (no-till farming, cover crops, buffer strips, targeted fertilizer application, reduced or metered tiling) would help reduce nutrients entering the lake. High nutrient and sediment input can cause algae blooms and reduce overall water quality.

                "narrative": "<p>THE BLACK CRAPPIE CPUE OF 13.60 FISH PER TRAP NET IS APPROXIMATELY TWICE THE LOCAL MEDIAN.  THE STOCK, HOWEVER, IS DOMINATED BY AGE ONE FISH (95% OF STOCK).  THE MEAN WEIGHT (0.05 POUNDS) AND MODAL LENGHT (4.2 INCHES) OF THE BLACK CRAPPIE CAPTURED DURING THE SURVEY REFLECT THE YOUNG AGE OF THE FISH PRESENT.  THE REMAINDER OF THE BLACK CRAPPIE CAPTURED WERE AGE TWO (5% OF STOCK).  IT APPEARS THAT ALL THE AGE ONE FISH WERE FROM NATURAL REPRODUCTION.  THE AGE TWO FISH MAY HAVE BEEN FROM A 1988 STOCKING OF 328 ADULT BLACK CRAPPIE.  HOWEVER, THE RATE ON THE FISH STOCKED TWO PER POUND, WOULD SUGGEST THAT THE AGE TWO BLACK CRAPPIE RECRUITED FROM REPRODUCTION THAT OCCURRED IN LAKE WILSON IN 1987.  GROWTH RATES FOR BLACK CRAPPIE EXCEEDED THE STATE AVERAGE FOR ALL LENGTHS SAMPLED. ALTHOUGH 340 ADULT WHITE CRAPPIE WERE STOCKED IN 1986, ONLY ONE WAS CAPTURED DURING THE SURVEY. THIS FISH AROSE FROM REPRODUCTION OCCURRING IN 1987. THE BLUEGILL CPUE OF 6.80 FALLS WITHIN THE FOURTH QUARTILE (TOP 25%) OF ALL WINDOM AREA LAKES CONTAINING BLUEGILL.  THE STOCK APPEARS TO BE PRIMARILY MADE UP OF AGE ONE FISH.  THE MEAN WEIGHT WAS 0.06 POUNDS AND THE MODAL LENGTH WAS 4.2 INCHES.  THE SECTION OF FISHERIES HAS NOT STOCKED BLUEGILL IN LAKE WILSON SINCE 1947 AND THEREFORE, SINCE SEVERAL WINTERKILLS HAVE OCCURED SINCE THEN, THE ORGIN OF THE BLUEGILL REPRODUCTIVE STOCK IS UNKNOWN.  GROWTH FOR THESE AGE ONE BLUE- GILL EXCEEDS THE STATE AVERAGE. THE BLACK BULLHEAD CPUE OF 45.80 FISH PER TRAP NET IS 59% OF THE LOCAL MEDIAN.  THE BLACK BULLHEAD STOCK EXHIBITS A TRIMODAL LENGTH-FREQUENCY DISTRIBUTION WITH MODES OCCURRING AT 5.2, 7.2 AND 10.2 INCHES.  THE MEAN WEIGHT OF THE BLACK BULL- HEAD CAUGHT IN THE TRAP NETS DURING THE SURVEY WAS 0.19 POUNDS.</p>",
