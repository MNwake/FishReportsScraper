While there is diversity in the kinds of fish present, individual species numbers tend to be low.     Panfish were the best represented in the 1995 investigation.  The bluegills sampled had an average length of 7.4 inches and ranged between 6.1 and 9.1 inches.  Black crappie numbers were lower, although they showed a nice average length of 10.7 inches and ranged between 9.7 and 12.2 inches.  Other species sampled at low abundance included:  northern pike, white sucker, walleye, shorthead redhorse, yellow perch and pumpkinseed.</p>",
