Other area lakes included in this class are:  East Silent, Paul, Six, and West McDonald. <br> \n     Northern pike abundance, as indexed with gill net catch rates, was above the normal range for this lake class at 9.3 per net lift.  The average weight of individual pike was 2.6 pounds and size structure appears good with 64% of the sample exceeding 18.0 inches in length.  Consistent reproduction of pike is evident from the presence of five consecutive year classes.   <br> \n     Yellow bullhead abundance is extremely high (61.5 per gill net lift), which is 13 times greater than the upper limit of the normal range.   <br> \n     Bluegills are very abundant, with a trap net catch rate of 225.6 per net lift, which is five times greater than the upper limit of the normal range.  Despite the high abundance, bluegill size structure is good with 62% of the sample exceeding 7.0 inches in length. The quality of the size structure is related to a strong 1986 (age-IV) year class which composed 55% of the sample.  Bluegill growth rates approximate statewide averages.   <br> \n     Two walleyes were captured during the survey and are the result of private stockings through an arrangement between the owners of the lake and a private fish hatchery operator. <br> \n</p>",
