                "narrative": "<p>Little Wolf Status - 1997               Little Wolf Lake is in fisheries lake class 31.  This classifies it with 141 other similarlakes for comparison purposes.  Class 31 lakes are located primarily in north-central Minnesotaand typically have a regular shoreline and very hardwater.  Other nearby class 31 lakes includeUpper LaSalle, Deer and Julia.  There are two resorts on the lake and a township public access onthe northwest corner.  The access has no improved ramp, and launching is in the outlet creekwhich may cause problems for large boats.  The access is closed during night time hours andparking space is limited.       Little Wolf is currently stocked every other year with walleye fingerlings (245 lbs.) andMississippi strain muskellunge (245 fish).  Past stocking has included walleye, muskellunge,northern pike, largemouth bass and black crappie.  The lake is managed as a brood stockmuskellunge lake and has a minimum length limit of 48\" to protect mature spawners. Muskellunge were first stocked in 1982 to establish an alternate egg source for Mississippi strainfish.  Muskellunge are abundant with an occasional fish over 50\" being caught by anglers.  Oneresort recorded 150 released muskellunge in 1997 with more than half the fish caught between36\" and 41\" and an average length of 38\".       Walleye are one of the most popular fish caught and are also abundant.  At 8.1 fish pergill net, the catch in the 1997 assessment was higher than most comparable lakes.  Half of thefish caught in gill nets were between 11\" and 14\" long and weighed close to a pound.  There wasalso a good number of 20\" to 22\" walleye with weights averaging approximately two and a halfpounds.     Northern pike numbers have always been low and remained the same in the currentassessment at less than one pike per gill net.  Average weight of 2.2 lbs. is about the same ascomparable lakes.  Most pike were in the ranges of 17\" to 20\" or 28\" to 33\" long.     Bluegill abundance is low with a maximum length of 5.6\" and an average weight of .10lb.  Most bluegill are probably too small to be acceptable to most anglers.  Pumpkinseed aremore abundant than bluegill at 2.1 fish per trap net but are lower in number than mostcomparable lakes.  The maximum length of 5 inches is similar to bluegill .     Yellow perch numbers are on the increase and at 182 per gill net abundance is four timeshigher than comparable lakes.  Twenty percent of the gill netted perch were over 8\" long.  Thelargest perch captured was 10.2\".  Three-fourths of the perch had either neascus, yellow grub orboth.  These parasites do not harm people but are aesthetically unappealing.     No black crappie or largemouth bass were captured in the current assessment althoughthey have been sampled in most previous surveys.  Rock bass were sampled at a rate higher thanmost comparable lakes averaging nearly two fish per trap net.  The average weight was about ahalf pound.  Lake whitefish have not been noted in any assessment since 1969.  Other minorspecies sampled  included bowfin (dogfish), white sucker, and yellow bullhead.  Brown bullheadhave been captured previously but were not seen in this assessment.     Little Wolf's abundant muskellunge population makes catching or sighting a muskie afairly common occurrence among anglers.  Most catches will be below the 48\" minimum sizeand must be released.  Catch and release is also strongly encouraged on legal fish above 48inches.  Walleye are also quite abundant and quality sizes are available.  However, since perchare the primary prey species for walleye, exceptionally high numbers of perch may make walleyedifficult to catch at times.  Perch are the major panfish species available to anglers in this lake.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Little Wolf Lake is a 528-acre lake with a maximum depth of 24 feet located near the town of Cass Lake in northwestern Cass County.  The lakeshore is moderately developed with a number of homes, cabins and one resort.  There is an unimproved, township-owned access on the north end of the lake.  The access is difficult for larger boats, offers little parking and is often locked after dark.  The lake is managed primarily for Walleye and Muskellunge, with Bluegill, Black Crappie, and Largemouth Bass managed as secondary species.  Little Wolf Lake offers a diversity of fishing opportunities, and the 2014 population assessment showed good numbers and sizes of all managed species present in the lake.   <br> \n  <br> \nThe Minnesota Department of Natural Resources has classified Minnesota lakes into 43 different lake classes based on physical characteristics and the fish community present in the lake.   Little Wolf is in lake class 31.  The following discussion makes comparisons between Little Wolf Lake and other class 31 lakes in the state.  Other Bemidji area lakes in this class include Julia, Deer, and Upper LaSalle.   <br> \n <br> \nLittle Wolf Lake is stocked with Walleye fingerlings on alternate years.  These stockings have been successful in producing consistent walleye fishing.  The 2014 Walleye catch rate of 8.67/gill net was above the normal range (1.33/gill net to 5/gill net) for class 31 lakes.   Age analysis of the Walleye catch showed very good survival of fish from the 2011 and 2009 stockings (age-3 and age-5), which translates into plenty of \"eater\" size Walleye and good numbers of younger fish that should provide quality fishing opportunities in the near future.  Walleye up to 22.4 inches in length were captured in the assessment, with an average size of 14.46 inches and 1.07 lbs/fish.    <br> \n <br> \nMuskellunge are not captured effectively in standard population assessments.  However, the first phase of a special Muskellunge population estimate was started in 2014, and this study will provide detailed information to anglers on the lake's Musky population once complete (reported in 2016).  Preliminary results from work completed in 2014 indicated a low density Musky population with an average size of 40.1 inches and fish up to 52 inches in length present in the lake.   <br> \n <br> \nThe 2014 Bluegill catch rate of 20.78/trap net was within the normal range for class 31 lakes (6.14/trap net to 46.60/trap net).  Bluegill captured had an average size of 6.31 inches in length and 0.21 lbs/fish.  Thirty percent of the Bluegill catch was larger than 7.5 inches, with fish up to 9.13 inches in length captured.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie numbers were at an all-time high in 2014, with a trap net catch rate (3.56/trap net) that exceeded the normal range for similar lakes.  Average size was also very good at 10.55 inches in length and 0.70 lbs/fish.   <br> \n <br> \nLittle Wolf Lake has maintained a quality Northern Pike population with good size structure throughout its assessment history.  The 2014 catch rate of 2/gill net was below the normal range (3.5/gill net to 10.5/gill net) for class 31 lakes but within the range of previous assessment catch rates.  Northern Pike had an impressive average size of 26.31 inches in length and 4.65 lbs/fish.  Seventy eight percent of Pike captured were greater than 24 inches in length.   <br> \n <br> \nAn electrofishing survey targeting Largemouth Bass was conducted as a part of the 2014 assessment.  The catch rate of 46.45 fish/hour indicates an abundant population for the Bemidji area.  Bass captured ranged in length from 6.46 inches to 17.72 inches.  The small average size of 9.79 inches in length was strongly influenced by a large proportion of young fish from a recent strong year class.  Fifteen percent of Bass captured were greater than 12 inches in length.    <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species captured in the 2014 assessment were Pumpkinseed, Hybrid Sunfish, Rock Bass, Yellow Perch, Bowfin, Yellow Perch and Yellow Bullhead. <br> \n</p>",

YEP ARE ABOUT HALF THE CATCH OF THE 1985 SURVEY THOUGH THEY ARE STILL ABOUT DOUBLE THE 3RD QUARTILE.  MOST PERCH WERE LESS THAN 6 INCHES. SHORELINE SEINING INDICATES VERY HIGH PERCH RECRUITMENT.

                "narrative": "<p>Little Wolf Lake is located approximately two miles west of the City of Cass Lake in the northwest corner of Cass County.  The lake is 490 acres in size, has a maximum depth of 24 feet, and supports a moderate amount of residential development along its shoreline, including one resort.  There is a small, township-owned public access located at the outlet on the northwest corner of the lake.  The access does not have an improved ramp, and launching is in the creek channel which may cause problems for large boats.  The access is closed during night time hours and parking space is limited.  Although the outlet creek connects to Big Wolf Lake, the waterway is not navigable by motor boat.  Little Wolf is within the boundary of the Leech Lake Indian Reservation. <br> \n <br> \nLittle Wolf Lake is managed primarily for walleye and muskellunge and secondarily for black crappie, bluegill, and largemouth bass.  A long-range management goal is to maintain a stable muskellunge population of pure Leech Lake genetic strain to ensure a stable source of eggs for statewide production needs.  Other primary management goals are to maintain a quality walleye fishery and an abundant yellow perch forage base. <br> \n <br> \nLeech Lake strain muskellunge were first introduced into Little Wolf in 1982.  Maintenance stocking has continued since then, currently conducted in alternating years.  Little Wolf is locally regarded as more of a \"numbers\" lake by muskellunge anglers, with a reasonable chance of seeing or catching a fish, but with a low probability of catching a trophy fish larger than 48 inches in length.  Little Wolf has always had a 48 inch minimum length requirement for muskellunge, and anglers should remember that it is now the statewide default regulation. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance has been very consistent over the past 20 years, with densities better than average for this type of lake.  Walleye captured in 2009 ranged in length from 12 to 26 inches and were represented by eight different year classes.  The 2005 year class (age 4) comprised 58% of the sample.  Alternate year fingerling stocking appears to be maintaining the walleye fishery very well. <br> \n <br> \nAlthough Little Wolf Lake is managed primarily for walleye and muskellunge, it has a variety of other species that may interest anglers including northern pike, largemouth bass, bluegill, and black crappie.  Northern pike abundance has been increasing gradually over the past twenty years, although the population is still considered to be low-density.  In 2009, northern pike ranged in length from 16 to 33 inches and were represented by six different year classes; approximately one third of the northern pike captured were greater than 25 inches long.  Also in 2009, largemouth bass were moderately abundant and were captured at a variety of sizes up to a maximum size of 18 inches.  Bluegill were also abundant in 2009 and present at a wide range of sizes, although the average size was small due to an abundant 2007 (age 2) year class.  Yellow perch is the main forage species for larger predators like walleye, northern pike, and muskellunge.  They were also very abundant in 2009, but small.  Only 13% of perch captured in 2009 were greater than 8 inches long. <br> \n <br> \nDevelopment pressure is increasing around the shorelines and within the watersheds of many Minnesota lakes.  This development can degrade water quality and impact valuable shoreline habitat.  Native shoreline vegetation provides habitat for fish and wildlife, filters harmful nutrients, and protects against shoreline erosion.  Lakeshore owners can minimize their impact on the shoreline and maintain a more natural setting while actually decreasing annual maintenance.

                "narrative": "<p>Little Wolf Lake is a 490-acre lake with a maximum depth of 24 feet.  The lake is located two miles west of the city of Cass Lake in upper Cass County.  There is a small township public access at the outlet in the northwest corner of the lake.  There is room for three vehicles.  The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 lake classes based on physical and chemical characteristics.  Little Wolf Lake is in lake class 31.  Other lakes in the same lake class include Black, Deer, Julia, Sand, Whitefish and Upper LaSalle Lakes.  Typically lakes in this class have very hard water and have regular shaped shorelines.  Little Wolf Lake is within the Leech Lake Indian Reservation.Little Wolf Lake is managed primarily for walleye and muskellunge, but it has a variety of species of fish for anglers to try their skills at.  Because of its small size, anglers can get out of the wind on windy days on Little Wolf Lake.Muskellunge are stocked in the lake since 1982, and fish over 50 inches have been caught.  Little Wolf Lake was originally established as a brood lake to provide a source of Mississippi strain muskellunge eggs for the statewide production program.There are good numbers of walleye present that range in length from 10 to 23 inches with an average lenght and weight of 15.6 inches and 1.6 pounds.  Expect to catch numbers of walleye in the 12 to 14 inch range.  Frequent fingerling stocking is supporting the walleye fishery.  Bluegill abundance has increased dramatically since the last assessment in 1997.  Abundance is typical of other class 31 lakes.  The recent surge in bluegill production has resulted in a relatively young population with a variety of lengths from 3 to 8 inches.  Only 15% of bluegill sampled in 2004 were over 7 inches long, but since growth is excellent, an excellent fishery may be developing in the next few years.Other members of the sunfish family sampled in 2004 are pumpkinseed sunfish, rock bass, black crappie and largemouth bass.Yellow perch is the main forage for predators like walleye, northern pike and muskellunge.  They are quite abundant but small.  Only 7% of the sampled perch were greater than 8 inches long.Other fish sampled include white sucker, bowfin (dog fish) and redhorse.Development pressure is increasing around the shorelines and within the watershed on Minnesota lakes.  This degrades water quality and impacts valuable shoreline habitat.  Native shoreline vegetation provides habitat for fish and wildlife, filters harmful nutrients and protects against shoreline erosion.  Lakeshore owners can minimize their impact on shoreline and maintain a more natural setting while actually decreasing annual maintenance.

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of the nearshore fish community in Little Wolf Lake was conducted by Fisheries Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program Staff starting on July 8, 2019. Fourteen sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 15-foot or 50-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at all 14 sites with one site sampled from the boat due to site conditions. Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample nine sites, a 15-foot seine was used at three sites, and deep, soft sediments prevented the use of seines at two sampling sites. Nearshore sampling captured 16 native species of fish including five species that are intolerant of disturbance (Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Iowa Darter, Muskellunge, and Rock Bass) and no species that are tolerant of disturbance.  <br> \n <br> \nA summer trap net survey was conducted on July 8, 2019 by Fisheries Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program Staff in conjunction with the targeted survey of the nearshore fish community. Nine trap nets were set along the shoreline in locations that encompassed multiple habitat types. Bluegill, Pumpkinseed, Rock Bass and Yellow Perch comprised the majority of the trap net catch by number. Bluegill dominated the trap net catch; 77% by numbers and 50% by biomass. The number of Bluegill sampled per net was similar to the 75% quartile for similar Lake Class 31 lakes. Conversely, the numbers of Black Crappie and Largemouth Bass per net were below the 25% quartile for Lake Class 31 lakes. Of the Bluegills sampled, 32% were between 5 and 7 inches, 48% were over 7 inches and 8% were over 8 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nThese trap net and nearshore survey data are combined with data from an August 2019 gill net survey to describe the fish community and provide a fish-based Index of Biotic Integrity (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment. In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g., Blackchin Shiner, Iowa Darter, and Rock Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g., Black Bullhead). The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website. <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey indicates Little Wolf Lake is healthy as indicated by an exceptionally high FIBI score, well above the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes. Data from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Mississippi River - Headwaters Watershed assessment of surface waters process completed in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Little Wolf Lake is a 528-acre lake with a maximum depth of 24 feet located near the town of Cass Lake in northwestern Cass County. The public access is township-owned and located on the northwest side of the lake. The unimproved access provides very limited access for larger boats due to landing design and water levels. The lake has a moderately developed shoreline with one active resort. Little Wolf Lake is primarily managed for Walleye and Muskellunge with Bluegill, Black Crappie and Largemouth Bass managed as secondary species.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye are stocked every other year (2015, 2017, etc.) and these stockings have been successful at providing consistent Walleye fishing. The 2019 walleye catch rate of 5 fish/gillnet decreased some from the last survey completed in 2014 but still remains above average when compared to similar lakes. Walleye captured ranged in length from 11 inches to 22 inches with an average length of 16 inches. Little Wolf should provide good Walleye fishing in the near future with good numbers of \"eaters\" present in the population. <br> \n <br> \nLittle Wolf Lake historically has had low Northern Pike numbers compared to similar lakes. A total of 32 Pike were captured in this survey and ranged in length from 20 inches to 37 inches with a good average size of about 25 inches in length.  Fifty three percent of the Pike captured were above or below the North-Central Pike Zone regulation protected slot limit of 22 to 26 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nThe 2019 Bluegill catch rate of 10.3/trap net was within the range typically found in similar lakes. Bluegill captured had an average size of 6 inches.  The Black Crappie catch rate was below average for Little Wolf Lake and below catches found in similar area Lakes. Black Crappie ranged in length from almost 10 inches to over 13 inches in length.   <br> \n <br> \nAn electrofishing survey for Largemouth Bass was conducted as part of the 2019 standard survey. A total of 40 bass were captured and ranged in length from 7 inches to over 17 inches with an average length of nearly 13 inches. <br> \n <br> \nOther species captured during the survey were Yellow Perch, Pumpkinseed, Hybrid Sunfish, Rock Bass, White Sucker, Yellow Bullhead and Muskellunge. <br> \n</p>",

This electrofishing assessment in 2015 is phase 2 of a two year population estimate.  A targeted assessment for muskies using large-frame trap nets was conducted in 2014 and all 29 captured adults were marked with a fin clip.  The intent was to electrofish the following spring and derive a population estimate from the proportion of recaptures. <br> \n <br> \nNear the end of April, 2015, electrofishing was conducted on six nights to capture adult muskies during the spawning season.  During fifteen total hours of electrofishing, 22 fish were captured.  Of those 22 fish, 11 were males, 8 were females, and 3 were immature.  Lengths ranged from 16.7 to 51.0 inches and averaged 40.0 inches.  Weights ranged from 0.7 to 36.1 lbs. and averaged 16.7 lbs. <br> \n <br> \nSeven of the 19 mature fish captured in 2015 had a fin clip from 2014.  Utilizing a simple model to estimate population size, approximately 76 adult Muskellunge inhabited the 490 acre lake in 2014 at a density of 0.16 muskies per surface-acre.  This estimate is less than half the 164 adult muskies estimated in 1997; however, the population appears to have matured considerably since then as indicated by an increase in average fish size.   <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Little Wolf is a 528-acre lake, located 4 miles northwest of Cass Lake, MN within the Chippewa National Forest.  A targeted re-survey was completed by Bemidji Area Fisheries staff on Little Wolf Lake during late July of 2019 to assess the nearshore fish community and overall health of the lake.  The initial survey was completed in early July of 2019 by the Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) program staff. <br> \n <br> \nIn this survey, 14 nearshore sites (100-foot) were evenly spaced along the lakeshore to sample a variety of aquatic habitat types and collect a representative sample of the nearshore fish community.  Depending on the habitat conditions at each site, backpack electrofishing and shoreline seining were attempted.  A total of eight sites were sampled with a seine, while backpack electrofishing was completed at all 14 sites.  A total of 15 species of fish were sampled, which included four species (Banded Killifish, Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, and Rock Bass) that are intolerant to disturbance or poor water quality. <br> \n <br> \nNearshore fish community data was analyzed with information collected from the standard survey completed in 2019 to calculate a Fish-based Index of Biologic Integrity (FIBI) score to measure the biological condition and overall health of Little Wolf Lake.  In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and healthy habitat (e.g. Blackchin Shiner, Least Darter, and Rock Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g. Black Bullhead, Fathead Minnow, and Green Sunfish).  The combination of fish species present may identify stressors negatively affecting the lake environment.  The FIBI score is composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics to indicate the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake.  For additional information on FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources website (www.mndnr.gov). <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey indicated Little Wolf Lake is in good health with a FIBI score above the impairment and exceptional thresholds for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes.  In coordination with the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency, data from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Mississippi River (Headwaters) Watershed assessment. <br> \n</p>",
