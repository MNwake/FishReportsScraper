                "narrative": "<p>Chub Lake is a 311 acre lake located near Carlton, Minnesota with 54% (169 acres) littoral area and a maximum depth of 28 feet. A state owned, concrete back-in access is located on the north end of the lake, near Chub Lake Park.  Chub Lake was last surveyed in 2009.  Chub Lake was assessed during the summer of 2014 to update information about fish populations and to evaluate the success of the walleye stocking program.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye fingerlings have been stocked into Chub Lake during even years since 1992.  Walleye abundance of 1.7 per gillnet lift was down from 2009 (9.2) but still considered average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Walleye average length was impressive at 21.0 inches and growth was slow when compared to other Duluth Area lakes.  Only four year-classes from 2000 through 2010 were represented.  Fifty percent of the walleyes aged were from the 2004 year-class.  One-hundred percent of the walleyes aged corresponded to stocked year-classes suggesting limited, if any natural reproduction.   <br> \n <br> \nA total of 188 largemouth bass were sampled with electrofishing equipment.  The catch rate of largemouth bass was 149.0 fish per hour of electrofishing on-time.  Largemouth bass catch rates have been high on Chub, ranging from 125.9 in 2009 to 158.8 in 1999 over the last four investigations.  Largemouth bass average length was 13.2 inches and growth was slow compared to other Duluth Area lakes.  Largemouth bass growth rates have been decreasing over the last several assessments in Chub Lake.  All year-classes from 2004 through 2012 were represented with strong 2007 and 2010 year-classes.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie abundance of 12.9 per trapnet lift was up from 2009 (5.0) and was above average when compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Black crappie mean length was 5.7 inches and growth was slow compared to other Duluth Area lakes.  All year-classes from 2007 to 2012 were represented with a strong 2010 year-class. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike abundance of 11.0 per gillnet lift was down from 2009 (15.2) and average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Average length was 20.2 inches. Northern pike were not aged for this assessment.   <br> \n <br> \nBluegill abundance of 8.0 per trapnet lift was down from 2009 (9.3) and below average when compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Average length of sampled bluegills was 4.3 inches.  Bluegill were not aged for this assessment.   <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch abundance of 0.3 per gillnet lift was down from 2009 (1.0) and was below average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Average length of perch was 6.3 inches, but not enough individuals were sampled to evaluate stock density or growth. <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species sampled included black bullhead, golden shiner, pumpkinseed sunfish, rock bass and white sucker.    <br> \n <br> \nWater levels were up approximately two feet from the 2009 survey.  Other lakes in the Nemadji River watershed (such as nearby Hay Lake) have also seen increases in water levels the last couple years. <br> \n <br> \nEurasion water milfoil was discovered growing near the boat launch by field staff during the 2009 survey.  It appears as though the plant has expanded in the last several years as Eurasion milfoil stands were noted near several net locations.  The DNR has designated the lake as infested waters and posted signs to notify those using the public water access.  Designation of the lake as an infested water prohibits the transport of water and harvest of bait. <br> \n <br> \nThe regulation that prohibited fishing and recreational boating in the southeast bay from the opening of the general fishing season to June 30 was permanently removed in 2014.  The regulation was intended to protect spawning largemouth bass.  Recent assessments have shown that Chub Lake's largemouth bass population has become over abundant and is dominated by excessive stock sized fish and growth rates are at historic lows.  With increasing population density, food availability per fish declines, leading to slower growth and poorer condition of the surviving fish.  The removal of the regulation may allow increased harvest (or induced nest failure by catch-and-release angling) leading to a lower population density which may allow remaining fish to experience more rapid growth, eventually leading to an improved size structure for largemouth bass in Chub Lake.     <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Chub Lake is a 311 acre lake located near Carlton, Minnesota with 54% (169 acres) littoral area and a maximum depth of 28 feet.  A state owned, concrete back-in access is located on the north end of the lake, near Chub Lake park.  Walleye and largemouth bass are the primary fish species.  Nearly 25,000 fingerling and 6,000 yearling walleyes have been stocked since 1990.       Although walleye abundance has decreased some since the investigation in 1999, a walleye abundance of 3.3 fish/gillnet in 2004 was still above average compared to Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Mean length was 21.6 inches with 95% of walleyes 15 inches or greater.  Growth was slow compared to other Duluth Area populations.  Correlation of fish to stocked years was 95% in 2004 and 65% of walleyes were correlated to the 1996 fingerling stocking.     Largemouth bass electrofishing catch rates of 133 per hour were well above the average (32.6 per hour) for Duluth Area bass populations.  Mean length was 12.6 inches with 68% percent of largemouth bass 12 inches or larger.  Largemouth bass in Chub Lake successfully reproduced in all years between 1991 and 2002, but growth was slow compared to other Duluth Area populations.       Bluegill abundance was slightly below average for Minnesota lakes with an average of 8.0 fish per trapnet.  Mean length was 5.5 inches with 41% of bluegills 6 inches or greater and a maximum size of 6.9 inches.  Bluegill reproduction was consistent; however, growth was slow compared to other Duluth Area populations.         Northern pike abundance was average for Minnesota lakes with a value of 7.2 fish/gillnet.  Mean length was 22.7 inches, with most (70%) northern pike larger than 20 inches.  Growth was slow for Duluth Area populations.  Based on age distribution, northern pike successfully reproduced from 1996 to 2001.      Black crappie abundance was 0.9 fish/trapnet and was average for Minnesota lakes of this type.  The mean length of black crappie was 7.4 inches, and growth was average for Duluth Area populations.  Only three year classes were represented in 2004.     Yellow perch abundance was average for Minnesota lakes with a value of 4.0 fish/gillnet.  Mean length of yellow perch captured was 6.4 inches with a maximum length of 6.9 inches.       Other fish species sampled included brown bullhead, pumpkinseed, rock bass, and white sucker.     Largemouth bass catch rates in 2004 were among the highest observed in the Duluth Area.  In order to protect spawning largemouth bass, fishing and boating in the southeast bay will continue to be prohibited from the opening of the general fishing season to June 30.  Walleye catch rates in Chub Lake have dropped from a historic high of 24.0 fish/gillnet in 1989 to 3.3 fish/gillnet in 2004, despite the increased amount and frequency of walleye stocking between 1989 and 2002.  The relatively high predator density (i.e., northern pike and largemouth bass) may limit the success of fingerling walleye stocking.     </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Results of 1994 lake survey and electrofishing assessment of Chub Lake indicate high quality walleye and largemouth bass populations.  Walleye gillnet catch rate was well above average when compared to other lakes of similar type, while largemouth bass electrofishing catch rate was the highest of any lake sampled in Duluth Area.  Quality of size structure was excellent, with 98% of sampled walleye longer than 15 inches and 74% of sampled largemouth bass longer than 12 inches.  Walleye from Chub Lake exhibited average growth rates compared to other populations from Duluth Area, reaching 15.0 inches at age IV.  Largemouth bass were 10.3 inches long at age IV.  Walleye stocking in Chub Lake appears to have contributed to their abundance.  Of 58 walleye aged from the 1994 survey, 81% were born in years that fingerlings were stocked.  Similarly, in 1989, 93% of 55 walleye were aged to stocking years.  Despite the abundant walleye population documented by testnetting, anglers have reported difficulties catching them.  The cause of this is unclear, although dense aquatic vegetation may be a factor.     A largemouth bass spawning sanctuary, which prohibits fishing and boating from May 12 to June 30, was established within the southest bay of Chub Lake sometime prior to 1988.  This bay and additional undeveloped shoreline along the south shore are very important to largemouth bass reproduction.  Removal of willow trees and other woody debris from the water along these stretches of shoreline would have negative impacts on quality of this population.</p>",

A county owned, concrete back-in access is located on the north end of the lake, near Chub Lake Park.  Walleye and Largemouth Bass are the primary management species and Black Crappie is the secondary management species.  Chub was last surveyed in 2014.  Chub Lake was assessed during the summer of 2020 to update information about fish populations and to evaluate the success of the Walleye stocking program.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye fingerlings have been stocked into Chub Lake during even years since 1992.  Walleye abundance of 0.7 per gillnet lift was down from 2014 (1.7) but still considered average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Walleye average length was large at 21.5 inches.  One-hundred percent of the Walleyes aged corresponded to stocked year-classes suggesting limited, if any natural reproduction.   <br> \n <br> \nSpring Largemouth Bass sampling was suspended during the spring of 2020 due to the pandemic.  Previous spring Largemouth Bass electrofishing assessments have shown a robust bass population in Chub Lake. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie abundance of 4.6 per trapnet lift was down from 2014 (12.9) but was still above average when compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Black Crappie average length was 5.7 inches and growth was slow compared to other Duluth Area lakes.  All year-classes from 2010 to 2019 were represented indicating consistent reproduction. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike were abundant but trend small with an average length of 20.2 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nBluegill abundance was average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Average length was 4.3 inches.  Yellow Perch were scarce and small.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Chub Lake is a 311 acre lake located near Carlton, Minnesota with 54% (169 acres) littoral area and a maximum depth of 28 feet. A state owned, concrete back-in access is located on the north end of the lake, near Chub Lake Park.  Walleye fry have been stocked in even years from 1982 through 2008. Chub Lake was last assessed in 2004.  Chub Lake was surveyed during the summer of 2009 to update information about fish populations and to evaluate the success of the walleye stocking program.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye fingerlings have been stocked into Chub Lake during even years since 1992.  Walleye abundance of 9.2 per gillnet lift was up from 2004 (3.3) and was above average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Walleye average length was impressive at 19.5 inches and growth was average when compared to other Duluth Area lakes.  All year-classes from 2000 to 2008 were represented except 2006.  Fifty-two percent of the walleyes aged were from the 2004 year-class.  Eighty-five percent of the walleyes aged corresponded to stocked year-classes.   <br> \n <br> \nA total of 90 largemouth bass were sampled with electrofishing equipment.  The catch rate of largemouth bass was 125.9 fish per hour of electrofishing on-time.  Largemouth bass average length was 13.0 inches and growth was slow compared to other Duluth Area lakes.  All year-classes from 1997 through 2008 were represented in the sample.  Shoreline seining captured 36 young-of-the-year (YOY) largemouth bass with an average length of 1.8 inches. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike abundance of 15.2 per gillnet lift was up from 2004 (7.2) and average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Historically, the northern pike CPUE has been increasing in Chub and has ranged from 5.5 (1976) to 15.2 (2009).  Average length was 21.7 inches and growth was average compared to other Duluth Area lakes.  All year-classes from 2001 to 2008 were represented. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie abundance of 5.0 per trapnet lift was down from 2004 (0.9) and was above average when compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Black crappie mean length was 7.0 inches and growth was average compared to other Duluth Area lakes.  All year-classes from 2003 to 2007 were represented. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill abundance of 9.3 per trapnet lift was up from 2004 (8.0) and average when compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Average length of sampled bluegills was 4.6 inches and growth was slow compared to other Duluth Area lakes.  All year-classes from 1997 to 2007 were represented.  Shoreline seining captured 3 YOY bluegill with an average length of 1.8 inches. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch abundance of 1.0 per gillnet lift was down from 2004 (4.0) and was below average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Average length of perch was 6.6 inches, but not enough individuals were sampled to evaluate stock density or growth. <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species sampled included black and brown bullhead, golden shiner, Johnny darter, brook stickleback, spottail shiner, pumpkinseed sunfish, rock bass and white sucker.    <br> \n <br> \nInformation was collected on aquatic vegetation, substrate and water quality.  Twenty-six aquatic plant species or species groups were identified along 20 transects.  Flat-stem pondweed was the most frequently found plant (90% of transects) followed by variable-leaf pondweed, bushy pondweed and Robbins\u0019 pondweed (85%, 80% and 80% of transects, respectively).  The most common substrate types were sand, gravel and rubble which were identified along 95%, 65% and 35% of the transects, respectively.  Results of laboratory water analysis indicate Chub is an alkaline, moderately hard water lake with moderate fertility.   <br> \n <br> \nA substantial percentage (74%) of lakeshore homeowners on Chub Lake have open yards extending to the shoreline.  Lakeshore owners can prevent excessive nutrient loading by avoiding lawn fertilization, limiting aquatic vegetation removal, and implementing riparian best management practices.  The shoreline restoration near the public access located in Chub Lake Park provides a good demonstration of riparian best management practices.  This project restored a portion of the Chub Lake Park shoreline that was previously high maintenance turf grass to native vegetation and provides a buffer to filter nutrients for the lake.   <br> \n <br> \nEurasion water milfoil was discovered growing near the boat launch by field staff during this assessment.  It appears as though the plant has been in Chub Lake for a couple of growing seasons as plants were rooted and \"topped out\" in some stands.  MN DNR Ecological Resources staff conducted a more detailed assessment of the extent of the infestation and found the plant limited to areas around the boat launch and one small patch near the point on the western shoreline.  The DNR has designated the lake as infested waters and posted signs to notify those using the public water access.  Designation of the lake as an infested water prohibits the transport of water and harvest of bait. <br> \n</p>",

Chub Lakes fishery is in excellent shape with good numbers and sizes of walleye and largemouth bass.  Fingerling stocking has been a very effective tool for establishing a walleye fishery, and good spawning substrate and cover, along with a good forage base, help sustain the largemouth bass.  Northern pike are common, but many fish are on the small side.  Bluegill are less abundant than in the past, however, good 1995 and 1996 year classes should be \"keeper\" sized in a few years.</p>",
