                "narrative": "<p>Lake Hiawatha is a 53-acre, class 30 lake located north of the Minneapolis/St. Paul International Airport in the city of Minneapolis.  A park and golf course, operated by Minneapolis Park and Recreation, completely surround the lake.  Hiawatha Lake has a diverse fish community consisting of black bullhead, black crappie, bluegill, bowfin (dogfish), common carp, green sunfish, hybrid sunfish, northern pike, pumpkinseed sunfish, walleye, white sucker, and yellow perch.  Walleye and northern pike are the top predators in Lake Hiawatha.  Although walleyes are not stocked into Lake Hiawatha, four age-4 walleyes, averaging 19.2 inches and 2.5 pounds, were sampled during this assessment.  Because the ages of these fish match up with the 2001 Lake Nokomis fingerling stocking, migration via Minnehaha Creek is likely occurring.  Similar to the 2001 assessment, northern pike exhibited low abundance during this assessment.  Sampled pike (including two trap net caught pike) averaged 22.2 inches and 2.4 pounds.    Lake Hiawatha has a panfish community consisting of bluegill, black crappie, pumpkinseeds, hybrid sunfish, green sunfish and yellow perch.  Of the 181 bluegills captured in both gill and trap nets, approximately 73% of the fish sampled were below 6.0 inches, with none exceeding 7.5 inches.  Approximately 19% of the 21 crappies sampled were above 8.0 inches, with the largest fish measuring 9.7 inches.  Additionally, four yellow perch averaging 6.7 inches were sampled.  Pumpkinseed, green, and hybrid sunfish were sampled in relatively low numbers.  Pumpkinseed and hybrid sunfish both averaged approximately 5.0 inches while green sunfish averaged a mere 3.4 inches.    Black bullheads, bowfin, common carp, and white suckers were sampled in varying numbers.  Displaying high numbers (155.0/gill net), black bullheads comprised nearly 92% of all fish caught in gill nets.  Bowfin and common carp displayed moderate abundance while white suckers were abundant when compared to similar lakes.  </p>",

Lake Hiawatha is surrounded by the Hiawatha Golf Course and is subject to periodic winterkill.  Northern pike were less abundant than in 1996 but averaged 2.8 pounds.  Black crappie numbers considerably increased from 1996.  Mean length is 6.8 inches and 24% of crappie are larger than 7 inches.  Bluegills are present but are small in average size (5.0 inches).  Yellow perch are abundant but mean length is only 5.8 inches.  Black bullheads were abundant and largemouth bass, white sucker, bowfin, pumpkinseed, golden shiner, and carp were present.  </p>",

Bluegill, pumpkinseed, and black crappie are also present but average relatively small in size. Black bullhead are very abundant and average less than 7.0 inches in length. White suckers were also sampled in relatively high numbers for waters of this classification (30). Other species present include yellow bullhead, carp, golden and spottail shiners. Two largemouth bass and one rock bass were also captured.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Hiawatha is a 53-acre lake located north of the Minneapolis/St. Paul International Airport in the city of Minneapolis.  A park and golf course, operated by Minneapolis Park and Recreation, completely surround the lake.  Lake Hiawatha has a diverse fish community consisting of black bullhead, black crappie, bluegill, bowfin (dogfish), common carp, golden shiner, green sunfish, hybrid sunfish, northern pike, pumpkinseed sunfish, walleye, white sucker, yellow perch, and yellow bullhead.  The lake is primarily managed for northern pike and secondarily for black crappie. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike is the top predator in Lake Hiawatha and has greatly increased in numbers in the last two years.  Forty-seven pike were collected in gill nets in the 2007 assessment compared to 4 in 2005.  Ages ranged from 1 to 8, with most fish in the 2002, 2003, and 2005 year classes.  Mean length of captured northern pike was 21.1 inches and 2.3 pounds and the largest was 31.0 inches and 8.1 pounds. Although walleye are not stocked into Lake Hiawatha, 2 were collected during this assessment.  Both fish were 20 inches in length and were approximately 3 pounds apiece.  It appears that walleye from Lake Nokomis migrated via Minnehaha Creek into Lake Hiawatha.  This was also the case in 2005 when four adult walleye were sampled in Lake Hiawatha. <br> \n   <br> \nBluegill, black crappie, and yellow perch are the most abundant panfish.  In 2007, black crappie catch (8.8/trap net) was higher than in 2005 (2.1/trap net).  In the current survey, black crappie mean length in trap nets was 6.9 inches inches and mean weight was 0.18 pounds with the largest measuring 11.3 inches and 0.8 pounds.  The 2004 and 2005 year classes dominated the population and growth was normal for the area.  Bluegill abundance is moderately low and has remained relatively stable over the last 12 years.  In 2007, 114 bluegill were captured in 9 trap nets (12.7/trap net).  Mean length and weight was 6.0 inches and 0.2 pounds and the largest collected was 7.4 inches and 0.3 pounds. Approximately 77% of the bluegill sampled were 6 inches or larger.  The size structure of this population has improved as mean length and weight was 5.5 inches and 0.1 pounds in 2005 and approximately 73% of the bluegill were smaller than six inches.  Five age-classes (2 - 6) of bluegill were fairly evenly represented in the sample and growth was below average for all age classes based on similar lakes in the West Metro Area.  The relative abundance of yellow perch has increased in the past two years (from 1.5/gill net in 2005 to 6.7/gill net in 2007).  Mean length for all perch was 6.9 inches and lengths ranged from 5.5 to 10.3 inches.  Approximately 12% of the sampled population was 8 inches or greater than in length.  Ages 2 through 7 were represented in the sample and growth was slower than average for all age classes based on similar lakes in the West Metro Area.  Hybrid sunfish and green sunfish were sampled in low abundance (n = 4 and 2, respectively).  Hybrid sunfish averaged 4.9 inches and green sunfish averaged 6.1 inches.  Pumpkinseed (n = 73) averaged 4.7 inches and weighed, on average, 0.1 pounds. <br> \n <br> \nBlack bullhead are abundant in Lake Hiawatha.  Catch averaged 44.3 per gill net and 31.0 per trap net.  Gill net catch was down from 2005 (155.0/net), but trap net catch was up (7.7/net).  Black bullhead averaged 6.3 inches in length and average weight was 0.1 pounds (range = 0.1 - 0.3 pounds).  Other species sampled in low abundance were bowfin (dogfish) (n = 4), common carp (n = 5), golden shiner (n = 2), largemouth bass (n = 1), white sucker (n = 7), and yellow bullhead (n = 12). <br> \n</p>",
