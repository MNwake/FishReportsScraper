Length frequency ranged from 14.0 to 29.9 inches with a median length figure of 20.0 inches.  Mean weight for all fish taken was 1.96 pounds.  The northern pike sampled (10) showed average growth at I, V and VI annulus and slow growth at II, III and IV annuluses.  The bluegill sunfish was low at 12.25 per set when compared to the local median figure of 25.67.  Length ranged from 3.0 to 7.9 inches with a median figure of 5.0 to 5.4 inches.  The black crappie and the pumpkinseed sunfish exhibited very low population figures at 1.00 and 0.25 respectively.  The carp was slightly low at 1.00 per set.  The largemouth bass and the yellow perch were absent in the gill and trapnet catches but young-of-the-year were taken in the shoreline seining to indicate their presence in the lake.</p>",
