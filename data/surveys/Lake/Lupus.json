There is no developed public access; however, the lake can be reached by a 0.5 mile foot trail from Hogback Lake.The test nets in 1998 sampled northern pike, yellow perch, white sucker and minnows.  Northern pike were taken in above average numbers compared to other lakes of this type.  Northern pike ranged from 13.6 inches to 24.4 inches (3.5 pounds) and averaged about 2.2 pounds.Yellow perch are present in below average numbers and size.  The yellow perch sampled in this survey ranged from 5.7 inches to 8.1 inches.Lupus Lake probably would provide anglers with plenty of action for small northern pike in a wild, uncrowded, setting.</p>",
