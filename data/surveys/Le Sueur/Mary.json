PERCH TWO TIMES GREATER THAN THE STATE AVERAGE. LM BASS SEEM TO BE DOING FAIR FROM FISHING REPORTS. ROUGHFISH ARE ABUNDANT CARP, BUFFALO, BULLHEADS, SHEEPHEAD, AND SUCKER HAVE BEEN REMOVED IN GREAT NUMBERS OVER THE YEARS. THE 1974 NET CATCHES WERE ABOUT THE SAME AS NOW FOR NORTHERN PIKE, LM BASS AND BULLHEADS. SIGNIFI- CANTLY INCREASES WERE MADE IN BLUEGILL AND CARP CATCHES. THE WALLEYE CATCH HAS DROPPED SINCE 1974 FROM 4.6 PER NET TO .90 IN 1982, PERCH HAVE DE- CREASED FROM 59.5 PER NET TO 16.45 PER NET. CRAPPIE HAVE FALLEN FROM 24.00 TO 10.62 FISH PER NET. BUFFALO AND SHEEPSHEAD HAVE SHOWN DECREASED CATCHES SINCE 1974. TRY TO INCREASED THE WALLEYE POPULATION TO ACCEPTABLE LEVELS BY STOCKING FINGER LINGS AT 2 LB./ACRE ANNUALLY AND EVALUATE IN 1986 WITH TEST NETTING. IN THE PAST STOCKING RATES HAVE BEEN 1 LB./ACRE SIX OUT OF THE LAST SEVEN YEARS. IF THE WALLEYE POPULATION DOESN'T IMPROVE, CONSID- ERATION SHOULD BE GIVEN TO STOCKING RESCUED NORTHERN PIKE INSTEAD OF WALLEYES. NO OTHER STOCKING IS NECCESSARY AT THIS TIME. ROUGHFISH REMOVAL MAY CONTINUE BY COMMERCIAL OPERATORS.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>East Jefferson Lake is a 700 acre lake located approximately 4.5 miles southeast of the town of Cleveland in Le Sueur County. A DNR-maintained public access is located on the east side of the lake off Beaver Dam Road. The maximum depth is 37 feet with 48% of the area less than 15 feet deep. The lake is considered eutrophic with generally poor water clarity and frequent algae blooms caused by elevated nutrient levels. It is designated as an infested water body due to the establishment of Eurasian Watermilfoil. The lake is primarily managed for Black Crappie and Bluegill and secondarily for Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, and Walleye. The management plan calls for stocking 338,000 Walleye fry in odd years. Recent stocking events include Walleye fry in 2013, 2015, and 2017. Northern Pike fry are also stocked annually in Swede's Bay Lake which is openly connected to East Jefferson Lake. East Jefferson Lake is managed along with Middle and West Jefferson Lakes and German Lake as part of a chain of lakes known collectively as the Jefferson Chain. Since these lakes are openly connected to one another, fish migration must be considered and management is coordinated as such.  <br> \n <br> \nA standard survey was performed the week of July 30, 2018 as part of a regularly scheduled monitoring program conducted by the Minnesota DNR. A standard survey is used for sampling a wide range of fish species during the summer months using standard methods (i.e. standard time of year, set sampling stations, taking water clarity readings and oxygen/temperature profiles, etc.) and gears (i.e. lake survey gillnets, trap nets, and spring electrofishing for Largemouth Bass). The survey was completed to assess the fish community using 9 gill nets, 9 trap nets, and 95 minutes of boat electrofishing. Water quality parameters were also measured. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie was the most abundant fish species in the gill nets in 2018. A total of 212 were sampled for a catch rate of 23.6/net, indicating high numbers were present. This was by far the highest catch rate since 1994 when the average catch rate was just 8.5/net. Lengths ranged from 4.4 to 11.9 inches with an average of 6.7 inches. Approximately 31% of the catchable population was larger than 8 inches. An additional 163 fish ranging from 5.0 to 11.6 inches were sampled with trap nets. Fish from both gears ranged from 1 to 7 years old with 7 year classes present. The 1 year old and 4 year old fish were the most abundant. Growth was good with fish reaching 10 inches in their 4th year. The results of the 2018 survey show an abundant Black Crappie population with many year classes and strong growth.  <br> \n <br> \nA total of 234 Bluegills were sampled with trap nets for a catch rate of 26.0/net, indicating moderate to high numbers were present. Catch rates have varied from 3.9/net to 44.8/net with an average of 19.8/net since 1994. Lengths ranged from 2.9 to 8.5 inches with an average of 6.3 inches. Approximately 67% of the catchable population exceeded 6 inches. Few fish larger than 8 inches were seen. Bluegills were also well represented in the gill net sample with a total of 198 ranging from 3.9 to 8.9 inches caught. Fish from both gears ranged from 1 to 9 years old with 9 year classes present. Most Bluegill were 3 to 5 years old. Growth was moderate with fish reaching 6 inches in their 3rd year of growth and 8 inches during their 6th year of growth. Bluegills continue to support a healthy fishery in East Jefferson Lake yet efforts to improve size structure should be pursued. <br> \n <br> \nA total of 37 Northern Pike were sampled with gill nets for a catch rate of 4.1/net, indicating moderate numbers were present. Since 1994, catch rates have varied from 0.4/net to 9.1/net with an average of 3.9/net. Only twice during that time has the catch rate exceeded 5.0/net. Lengths ranged from 19.7 to 35.9 inches with an average of 25.9 inches. Approximately 68% of the sample exceeded the legal minimum length limit of 24 inches. An additional 11 fish ranging from 20.4 to 31.5 inches were sampled with the trap nets. Fish from both gears were 2 to 9 years old with 7 year classes present. Most of the fish were 2 to 4 years old. On average fish grew fast, exceeding 24 inches by their 4th year. Despite historically inconsistent catch rates, East Jefferson Lake offers a good opportunity for anglers targeting Northern Pike. Southern Zone Northern Pike regulations are in effect for East Jefferson Lake. Anglers are allowed two fish per day. All fish under 24 inches must be immediately released. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass were sampled with boat electrofishing for the first time at East Jefferson Lake in 2018. A total of 67 fish were sampled for a catch rate of 42.0/hour. Lengths ranged from 3.1 to 18.5 inches with an average of 10.2 inches. Of catchable size fish, approximately 74% were larger than 12 inches and 61% were larger than 15 inches. Five more Largemouth Bass ranging from 6.4 to 16.7 inches were sampled with net gears. Largemouth Bass were not aged however; the length frequency distribution suggests consistent recruitment with multiple year classes present. Largemouth Bass are a popular target on the Jefferson Chain and should be sampled with spring boat electrofishing in all future surveys to continue monitoring size structure. <br> \n <br> \nA total of 12 Walleyes ranging from 18.4 to 27.4 inches were sampled with gill nets for a catch rate of 1.3/net, indicating low numbers were present. Walleyes have been scarce since 1994 with a mean of just 1.6/net and a high of 2.6/net. An additional 16.2 inch fish was sampled with trap nets. Age of Walleye from both gears ranged from 4 to 17 years old with 5 year classes present. Approximately 54% of the sample were 4 years old which aligned with other Jefferson Chain surveys in 2018. This year class originated in 2014 when no fry were stocked in the Jefferson Chain but a number of fingerlings were stocked into West Jefferson Lake. The prominence of this year class throughout the chain in 2018 suggests a strong possibility that they came from that fingerling stocking. <br> \n <br> \nA total of 139 Yellow Perch were sampled with gill nets for a catch rate of 15.4/net, indicating moderate to high numbers were present. Yellow Perch have, at times, been rather abundant in East Jefferson Lake with catch rates of 87.0/net in 1997 and 99.1/net in 2002. Catch rates have averaged 41.1/net since 1994. Lengths ranged from 5.6 to 9.2 inches with an average of 7.7 inches. Few fish exceed the quality length of 8 inches. In managing the predator species such as Northern Pike and Walleye, it is important to monitor Yellow Perch numbers as an important prey species. At times they likely find their way into the East Jefferson Lake panfish angler's creel as well. <br> \n <br> \nFreshwater Drum remained a sizable member of the fish community in 2018. A total of 73 were sampled with the gill nets for a catch rate of 8.1/net. The average catch rate is 9.7/net since 1994. Lengths ranged from 11.5 to 19.4 inches with an average of 16.3 inches. Few anglers target Freshwater Drum yet they are a surprisingly good food fish that are abundant and willing to bite. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Bullhead numbers plummeted to an all-time low in 2018 with a gill net catch rate of just 1.9/net. Prior catch rates from 1994 to 2013 ranged from 29.7/net to 188.0/net with an average of 101.1/net. The decline follows a similar area-wide trend of declining Black Bullhead numbers. Yellow Bullhead increased in 2018 with a gill net catch rate of 11.4/net, which is an all-time high for East Jefferson Lake. This inverse trend in bullhead numbers can be explained by a recent change in lake habitat and stability that now favors Yellow Bullheads. <br> \n <br> \nJust 9 Common Carp were sampled with gill nets for a catch rate of 1.0/net, indicating low numbers were present. From 1994 to 2018, catch rates varied from 0.0/net to 5.3/net with an average of 1.9/net. Lengths ranged from 21.1 to 31.9 inches with an average of 26.1 inches. The Jefferson Chain offers plenty of opportunities for Common Carp to spawn and persist yet they largely remain at sub-nuisance levels in East Jefferson Lake. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled in 2018 include Bigmouth Buffalo, Bowfin, Pumpkinseed, White Bass, and hybrid sunfish (Lepomis spp.). <br> \n <br> \nWater quality measurements included water temperature, dissolved oxygen, and secchi depth. Water clarity was poor with a secchi depth of 2.0 feet. Dissolved oxygen and water temperature readings ranged from 12.6 ppm and 77.0 degrees Fahrenheit at the surface to 0.0 ppm and 52.7 degrees Fahrenheit at 34 feet. A thermocline was detected around 22 feet. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers can play an important role in maintaining or improving a fish population by practicing selective harvest. Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for consumption, while encouraging the release of medium to large fish that may contribute to natural reproduction. This practice helps maintain balance in the fish populations and provides anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future. Additionally, smaller fish often taste better and have fewer contaminants than larger, older fish from the same water body. <br> \nShoreline property owners also play an important role in the overall health of an aquatic ecosystem, including the fish population. Natural shorelines, including vegetation, woody debris, and bottom substrates, provide valuable habitat for fish and wildlife, help maintain water quality, and reduce bank erosion. Cattails and bulrushes are particularly beneficial for fish spawning, rearing, and feeding. By leaving natural shorelines unaltered or restoring them to natural conditions, shoreline property owners are doing their part to maintain or improve a healthy ecosystem in the lake and protect the resource for future generations. <br> \n <br> \n-Sky Wigen, specialist <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>East Jefferson Lake is a 700-acre lake located approximately 4.5 miles southeast of the town of Cleveland in Le Sueur County. A DNR-maintained public access is located on the east side of the lake off Beaver Dam Road. The maximum depth is 37 feet with 48% less than 15 feet deep. East Jefferson Lake is considered eutrophic with generally poor water clarity and frequent algae blooms caused by elevated nutrient levels. East Jefferson Lake is designated as an infested water body due to the establishment of Eurasian Watermilfoil. East Jefferson Lake is primarily managed for Black Crappie and Bluegill and secondarily for Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, and Walleye. The management plan calls for stocking 338,000 Walleye fry in odd years. Recent stocking events include Walleye fry in 2015, 2017, and 2019. Northern Pike fry are also stocked periodically in West Jefferson Lake and Middle Jefferson Lake, most recently in 2017. East Jefferson Lake is managed along with Middle Jefferson Lake, West Jefferson Lake, and German Lake as part of a chain of lakes known collectively as the Jefferson Chain. Since these lakes are openly connected to one another, fish migration must be considered, and management is coordinated as such. East Jefferson Lake was surveyed the week of July 26, 2021, as part of a regularly scheduled monitoring program conducted by the Minnesota DNR. The survey was completed to assess the fish community using 8 gill nets, 9 trap nets, and 90 minutes of boat electrofishing. Water quality parameters were also measured. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappies dominated the catch in 2021 with a gill net catch rate of 90.0/net and a trap net catch rate of 30.9/net, indicating high numbers were present and easily surpassing the previous high-water marks for both gears. Since 1994, trap net catch rates of Black Crappies have increased in each subsequent survey, most recently from 6.6/net in 2013 to 18.1/net in 2018, to 30.9/net in 2021. Black Crappies from the gill net sample varied from 4.3 to 11.1 inches with an average of 7.0 inches. Black Crappies from the trap net sample ranged from 5.9 inches to 12.2 inches with an average of 8.3 inches. Approximately 45% of Black Crappies exceeded 8 inches long and 15% exceeded 10 inches. Black Crappies from both gears ranged from 1 to 7 years old with 7 year classes present. Approximately 74% of Black Crappies were 2 years old. On average, Black Crappies exceeded 8 inches by their third year. The increasing abundance, good growth and consistent natural reproduction should lead to excellent angling opportunities for Black Crappies in East Jefferson Lake for years to come.  <br> \n <br> \nBluegills were the most abundant species sampled with trap nets in 2021. A total of 393 Bluegills was sampled for a catch rate of 43.7/net, indicating moderate to high numbers were present. Since 1994, Bluegill catch rates have ranged from 3.9/net in 1997 to 44.8/net in 2002 with an average of 23.2/net. The three most recent surveys yielded Bluegill catch rates of 16.6/net in 2013, 26.0/net in 2018, and 43.7/net in 2021. Bluegills ranged from 2.9 to 8.7 inches with an average of 6.0 inches. Approximately 61% of Bluegills were larger than 6 inches but only 4% were larger than 8 inches. An additional 154 Bluegills ranging from 4.1 to 8.7 inches were sampled with the gill nets. Bluegills from both gears ranged from 1 to 8 years old with 8 year classes present. Two and three year old Bluegills accounted for approximately 50% of the sample. Bluegill growth rates were modest, with an average length of 6.3 inches at year four.  <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nA total of 37 Northern Pike were sampled with gill nets for a catch rate of 4.6/net, which was near the long-term average of 4.0/net. Northern Pike ranged from 19.0 to 34.4 inches with an average of 25.6 inches. Approximately 68% of the Northern Pike sample exceeded the legal minimum length limit of 24 inches. Four more Northern Pike ranging from 18.2 to 28.5 inches were sampled with trap nets. Most Northern Pike were 3 years old or younger and correspond to years when no Northern Pike were stocked in the Jefferson Chain. Growth rates were good, with an average length of 20.3 inches at 2 years old. East Jefferson Lake is included in the Southern Zone Northern Pike regulations. Anglers are limited to 2 Northern Pike daily which must be at least 24 inches in length. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass were sampled using spring boat electrofishing, yielding 34 fish and a catch rate of 22.4/hour. The 2018 Largemouth Bass catch rate was 42.0/hour. Largemouth Bass ranged from 4.7 to 19.4 inches with an average of 13.9 inches and size structure was good with over half the sample exceeding 15 inches. An additional 3 Largemouth Bass were sampled with the trap nets and ranged from 15.6 to 19.8 inches. Largemouth Bass were 1 to 13 years old with 13 year classes present. Largemouth Bass growth was moderate with fish exceeding 10 inches in year 3. Overall, the 2021 Largemouth Bass population appears stable and of good quality. <br> \n <br> \nA total of 21 Walleyes were sampled with the gill nets for a catch rate of 2.6/net, indicating low numbers were present. Since 1994, Walleyes have been sampled in low numbers with a peak of just 2.6/net in 1997 and 2021 during that time and an average of 1.7/net. Walleyes ranged from 12.2 to 26.9 inches with an average of 21.3 inches. Almost all Walleyes were over 15 inches and approximately 67% were over 20 inches. An additional 22.1 inch Walleye was sampled with the trap nets. Walleyes from both gears were 1 to 13 years old with 5 year classes present. Walleye growth was fast with fish exceeding 17 inches in year 3. Approximately 68% of Walleyes sampled were 7 years old and came from the non-stocked 2014 year class. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch were sampled in moderate abundance in 2021. A total of 73 Yellow Perch were caught for a rate of 9.3/net, indicating low to moderate numbers were present. The 2018 Yellow Perch catch rate was 15.4/net and since 1994 catch rates have been highly variable with a range of 3.9/net to 99.1/net and an average of 36.5/net. Yellow Perch ranged from 5.5 to 10.8 inches and averaged 7.5 inches. Most Yellow Perch were young with 2 to 4 year old fish accounting for 88% of the sample. Yellow Perch are an important prey species for Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, and Walleye and hopefully numbers trend toward the higher end of the historical catch range in future surveys. <br> \n <br> \nWhite Bass offer an additional angling target in East Jefferson Lake and have slowly increased in numbers since the mid 1990's. A total of 17 White Bass were sampled in 2021 with the gill nets for a catch rate of 2.1/net. This was highest White Bass catch rate since 1994. White Bass ranged from 14.5 to 18.0 inches with an average of 16.5 inches. Although rarely targeted, the White Bass population in East Jefferson Lake offers trophy-sized fish for anglers. <br> \n <br> \nFreshwater Drum were common in the gill net sample with a total of 85 fish caught for a rate of 10.6/net. Since 1994, Freshwater Drum catch rates have ranged from 2.7/net to 17.5/net with an average of 9.8/net. With an average length of 15.3 inches, catchable size Freshwater Drum were abundant for interested anglers. <br> \n <br> \nJust 5 Black Bullheads were sampled in 2021 for a catch rate of 0.6/net, which falls below the previous all-time low in 2018 of 1.9/net. The decline follows a similar area-wide trend of declining Black Bullhead numbers. Conversely, Yellow Bullheads were common with a catch rate of 9.3/net. This inverse trend in bullhead numbers can be explained by a shift in lake habitat and increased stability that now favor Yellow Bullheads. <br> \n <br> \nCommon Carp numbers were low with just 7 fish sampled for a gill net catch rate of 0.9/net, indicating low numbers were present and fell below the long term average of 1.8/net. The Jefferson Chain offers plenty of opportunities for Common Carp to spawn and persist, yet they largely remain at sub-nuisance levels in East Jefferson Lake. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled in 2021 include Bigmouth Buffalo, Bowfin (dogfish), Golden Shiner, Pumpkinseed, White Crappie, and hybrid sunfish (Lepomis spp.). <br> \n <br> \nAnglers can play an important role in maintaining or improving a fish population by practicing selective harvest. Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for consumption, while encouraging the release of medium to large fish that may contribute to natural reproduction. This practice helps maintain balance in the fish populations and provides anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future. Additionally, smaller fish often taste better and have fewer contaminants than larger, older fish from the same water body. <br> \n <br> \nShoreline property owners also play an important role in the overall health of an aquatic ecosystem, including the fish population. Natural shorelines, including vegetation, woody debris, and bottom substrates, provide valuable habitat for fish and wildlife, help maintain water quality, and reduce bank erosion. Cattails and bulrushes are particularly beneficial for fish spawning, rearing, and feeding. By leaving natural shorelines unaltered or restoring them to natural conditions, shoreline property owners are doing their part to maintain or improve a healthy ecosystem in the lake and protect the resource for future generations. <br> \n <br> \n-Sky Wigen, Fisheries Specialist <br> \n</p>",

Walleye catch per net has not changed over the last three surveys (1994, 1997, 2002).  Walleye ranged from 7 to 23 inches long.  Yellow perch and bluegill abundance are at all time high levels.  Most yellow perch were around 5 to 6 inches long, although fish over 9 inches are present.  Bluegill ranged up to 7.8 inches long.  Other species that provide good fishing opportunity include black crappie, northern pike, and largemouth bass.Eurasian milfoil was found along the east shore of East Jefferson Lake in 2002.  This is the first occurrence (along with adjacent German Lake) of this exotic plant in Le Sueur Co.  Anglers should make sure to remove all aquatic vegetation from boats and trailers when leaving East Jefferson Lake to prevent the spread of Eurasian milfoil to other lakes.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>\tEast Jefferson lake is a 700 acre lake in LeSueur county located northwest of Elysian. East Jefferson is the largest of the Jefferson lakes chain; it is known locally as Big Jefferson. A DNR owned public access is located on the east side of the lake, off LeSueur county road 13.  <br> \n\tEast Jefferson was surveyed the week of August 4th, 2008 to monitor the fish community. Black bullhead were netted at a rate of 63 per gill net, less than half the value (142/gillnet) observed in 2002.   <br> \n\tYellow perch gill netted at a rate of 30 per net, an decrease from 99 per net during the last survey. Yellow perch ranged in size from 5.4 to 8.9 inches. Walleye abundance remained stable, averaging 2.2 fish per gill net in this and 1.9 in the last survey. Northern pike also remained stable, averaging 0.5 fish per gill net in this and 0.4 in the last survey.  <br> \n\tFour largemouth bass were caught in trap and gill nets. Largemouth bass are not well sampled by nets. The Jefferson chain remains a popular largemouth bass destination and location of bass angling tournaments.  <br> \n\tEight white bass were sampled. All white bass sampled were from the 2004 year class and ranged from 13.3 to 15.2 inches. White bass occasionally spawn strong year classes, and an active connection to the Cannon River (County Ditch 59) ensures that white bass will always be in the Jefferson Chain system. <br> \n\tBlack crappie abundance decreased since the last assessment, but average size increased. Crappie gill net and trap net fish per net numbers dropped from 7.1 and 4.5 to 2.3 and 6.2 respectively. Average weight rose from 0.15 to 0.22 pounds in gill nets and 0.26 to 0.34 pounds in trap nets.  <br> \n\tAt the time of the assessment, bluegills may have been roaming deeper water. Gill nets outfished trap nets, very atypical for this specie. Bluegill gill net catch increased from 29.4 in 2002 to 34.6 in 2008. Trap net catches fell from 44.8 in 2002 to 15.6 in 2008. Bluegill length ranged from 3 to 8 inches, and the across gears average (mean) size increased from 4.96 inches in 2002 to 5.96 inches in 2008. <br> \n\tOther fish surveyed include white sucker, yellow bullhead, golden shiner, white crappie, bowfin (dogfish), common carp, freshwater drum (sheephead), hybrid sunfish, and pumpkinseed. Bigmouth buffalo are present in the lake, but were not sampled. <br> \n\tAnglers can help maintain or improve the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest. Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for table fare, but encourages release of medium- to large-sized fish. Releasing these fish can help maintain balance in the fish community in East Jefferson Lake and provide anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future.  <br> \n\tShoreline areas on the land and into the shallow water provide essential habitat for fish and wildlife that live in or near Minnesota s lakes. Overdeveloped shorelines cannot support the fish, wildlife, and clean water that are associated with natural undeveloped lakes. <br> \n\tShoreline habitat consists of aquatic plants, woody plants, and natural lake bottom soils. Plants in the water and at the water\u0019s edge provide habitat, prevent erosion, and absorb excess nutrients. Shrubs, trees, and woody debris such as fallen trees or limbs provide good habitat both above and below the water and should be left in place. By leaving a buffer strip of natural vegetation along the shoreline, property owners can reduce erosion, help maintain water quality, and provide habitat and travel corridors for wildlife.</p>",

THE 84 NORTHERN POPULATION WAS REPRE- SENTED BY I - III AGE CLASSES. THE WALLEYE POPULATION HAS INCREASED OVER RECENT YEARS, NOW AVERAGING 2.36/GILLNET COMPARED TO 0.90 AND 1.00/GILLNET IN 82 AND 84 RESPECTIVELY. THE PRESENT WALLEYE POPULATION IS WELL REPRESENTED BY II - VII AGE CLASSES COMPARED TO THE WEAKER II, IV, V, AND VII AGE CLASSES PRESENT IN 84. FINGER- LINGS STOCKED DURING THIS PERIOD WERE COMPRISED OF 79, 80, 82, 83 AND 85 YEAR CLASSES. WALLEYES SAMPLED APPEAR TO BE 80 - 85 YEAR CLASS FISH. THE TWO YEAR CLASSES PRESENT THAT DO NOT CORRESPOND TO STOCKING RECORDS MAY BE EXPLAINED BY THE DIFFICULTY IN AGING FISH THAT HAVE SPENT A PERIOD OF YEARS IN REARING PONDS AND THE POSSIBILITY OF NATURAL REPRODUCTION. PERCH REMAIN STABLE IN NUMBERS AVERAGING 18.54/ GILLNET COMPARED TO 11.25/GILLNET IN 84. PERCH CONTINUE TO BE REPRESENTED BY I - IV AGE CLASSES AS THEY WERE IN 84. ONLY TWO LARGEMOUTH BASS WERE SAMPLED IN THE SURVEY. REPORTS FROM ANGLERS AND INFORMATION FROM THE MINNESOTA BASS OPEN FISHING TOURNAMENT HELD IN 87 INDICATE A FAIR - GOOD BASS POPULATION PRESENT AND MADE UP OF ABOVE AVERAGE SIZED FISH. BLACK BULLHEADS HAVE INCREASED FROM 53.75/GILLNET IN 84 TO 152.73/GILLNET IN 87. THE PRESENT POPULATION IS DOMINATED BY SMALLER FISH, 5.0 - 6.0 IN LENGTH. CARP HAVE DECLINED FROM 6.67/TRAP- NET IN 84 TO 0.75/TRAPNET IN 87. OTHER NON-GAME FISH POPULATIONS WERE SAMPLED IN RELATIVELY LOW NUMBERS AND INCLUDE FRESHWATER DRUM, YELLOW BULLHEAD, BIGMOUTH BUFFALO, BOWFIN, AND WHITE SUCKER.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>THE SIMILARITY OF 1992 GAME FISH LENGTHS AND AGE DISTRIBUTIONS WITH THOSE OF PREVIOUS SURVEYS ILLUSTRATES THE STABILITY OF THE EAST JEFFERSON FISH POPULATION.  ONLY 3.50 BLG/TRAP NET WERE CAPTURED.  THIS IS FEWER THAN THE 21.75/TRAP NET IN 1987, NEAR THE 1984 CATCH OF 5.83, AND IN THE LOWER QUARTILE FOR CLASS 24 LAKES.  AGE 1,2, AND 4 WERE CAUGHT, AND AS IN THE 1987 SURVEY, AGE 1 BLG DOMINATE.  AS IN THE 1987 SURVEY, MORE BLG FROM 4.0-5.4 INCH LENGTH CLASSES WERE CAUGHT THAN FROM OTHER LENGTH CLASSES.  GROWTH IS SIMILAR TO THAT MEASURED IN THE 1987 SURVEY, AND IS SOMEWHAT FASTER THAN THE STATE AVERAGE.  BLC CATCH RATE, AT 15.17/GILL NET AND 9.50/TRAP NET, HAS CHANGED LITTLE SINCE THE 11.54/GILL NET CATCH OF 1987. 1992 GILL NET CATCH WAS IN THE UPPER QUARTILE AND TRAP NET CATCH WAS WITHIN THE IQR FOR CLASS 24 LAKES.  BLC AGED 1-6 WERE CAUGHT, WITH, AS IN THE 1987 SURVEY, AGE 1 FISH DOMINATING.  FOR THE TWO COMPARABLE AGE CLASSES (1 AND 3), GROWTH WAS SIMILAR TO THAT MEASURED IN 1987.  GROWTH WAS ABOVE AVERAGE FOR AGES 1 AND 2, AND LEVELED OFF FOR OLDER FISH.   WHC GILL NET CATCH, AT 6.83/NET, WAS WELL BELOW THE 1987 CATCH OF 45.36/GILL NET, BUT IS WITHIN THE IQR FOR CLASS 24 LAKES.  ONLY ONE WHC WAS AGED OTHER THAN AGE 1.  1-YEAR OLDS DOMINATED THE 1987 SURVEY TOO, BUT FIVE AGE CLASSES WERE SAMPLED THEN.  ONCE AGAIN, WHC FROM 5.5-6.9 INCHES WERE MOST COMMONLY SAMPLED. GROWTH TO AGE 1 WAS SIMILAR TO THAT MEASURED IN THE 1987 SURVEY.  THE 1992 WAE GILL NET CATCH OF 2.17/NET IS SIMILAR TO THE 2.36/NET CAPTURED IN 1987, AND IS WITHIN THE IQR FOR CLASS 24 LAKES. WAE AGED 4, 5, AND 6 WERE CAPTURED, WITH ONLY THE AGE 5 FISH (1987 YEAR CLASS) MATCHING A DISTINCT STOCKING.  THE LARGE 1988 YEAR CLASS INDICATES THAT NATURAL REPRODUCTION MAY HAVE OCCURRED, BUT THE STOCKING OF ADULTS IN 1988-1990 MAKES SEPARATION OF STOCKED AND NATURAL YEAR CLASSES IMPOSSIBLE.  1990 FALL ELECTORFISHING FOR WAE FINGERLING SAMPLED 16 FGL.  AND 4 YRL./HR.  HOW- EVER THE ABSENCE OF 2 AND 3 YEAR OLD WAE IN THIS SURVEY INDICATES FAILURE OF THE 1990 AND 1989 FRY STOCKING TO RECRUIT TO THE FISHERY.  THE 6.31 LENGTH AT AGE 1 MEASURED IN THE 1992 SURVEY IS CONSISTENT WITH THE 4.5-6.9 FINGERLINGS SAMPLED IN 1990 FALL ELECTROFISHING. GROWTH IS ABOVE AVERAGE TO AGE 1 AND SLOWER THAN AVERAGE FROM AGE 3.  NOP GILL NET CATCH ROSE FROM 1.18/NET IN 1987 TO 5.5/NET IN 1992, A CATCH RATE WITHIN THE IQR FOR CLASS-24 LAKES FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE SURVEYS BEGAN IN 1951.  AGES 1 THROUGH 4 WERE ASSIGNED TO THIS SAMPLE BUT IT APPEARS LIKELY THAT MOST OF THE FISH WERE BORN IN 1991. SMALL NOP WERE CAPTURED IN UNPRECEDENTED NUMBERS IN ALL FIVE OF THESE BASINS IN 1992 AND IT APPEARS THAT THE FISH WERE ABLE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF AN EXTRAORDINARY SPAWNING OPPORTUNITY THE PREVIOUS YEAR.  WATER LEVELS ROSE SEVERAL FEET PRIOR TO THE 1991 SPAWNING SEASON, INUNDATING A LARGE AMOUNT OF PREVIOUSLY-DRY SHORE LINE.  YEP GILL NET CATCH, AT 21.50/NET, HAS CHANGED LITTLE FROM THE 18.54/NET IN 1987.  THIS IS WITHIN THE IQR FOR CLASS 24 LAKES.  YEP AGED 1 AND 2 WERE MOST ABUNDANT, AND AGE 3 AND 5 FISH WERE ALSO CAPTURED.  THIS AGE DISTRIBUTION IS VERY SIMILAR TO THAT SEEN IN 1987. THE 1992 LENGTH FREQUENCY DISTRIBUTION IS ALSO SIMILAR TO THE 1987 LENGTH FREQUENCY DISTRIBUTION, WITH ONLY ONE FISH OUTSIDE A RANGE OF 5.0-8.9 MOST YEP FROM 5.5-6.4 STATE AVERAGE FOR ALL AGES OF YEP.  OTHER GAME FISH CAPTURED IN SMALL NUMBERS WERE LMB, PMK, AND WHB.  BLB GILL NET CATCH DECLINED TO 100.17/NET, FROM 152.73/NET IN 1987, STILL WELL ABOVE THE IQR FOR CLASS 24 LAKES.  THE FISH RANGED FROM 4.5- WERE CAPTURED AT LEVELS WITHIN OR SLIGHTLY ABOVE THEIR RESPECTIVE CLASS 24 IQRS.  LNG AND BIB WERE ALSO CAPTURED.</p>",

SLIGHTLY LARGER FISH NOW DOMINATE THE PRESENT BLACK CRAPPIE POPU- LATION AND MAY BE ATTRIBUTED TO AN IMPROVED GROWTH RATE. THE MEAN TOTAL LENGTH OF III AGE FISH HAVE INCREASED FROM 5.60 CRAPPIES ARE NOW DOMINATED BY II YEAR OLDS WITH A GOOD III AGE CLASS ALSO PRESENT. CRAPPIES IN '82. HAD A DOMINATE III AGE GROUP THAT WAS FOLLOWED BY A MODERATELY STRONG IV AGE GROUP. WHITE CRAPPIES HAVE REMAINED STABLE WITH A FAIR NUMBER PRESENT. WHITE CRAPPIES NOW AVERAGE 4.00/GILLNET COMPARED TO 0.36/GILLNET IN 82. BLUEGILLS APPEAR TO HAVE DECLINED FROM 11.62/TRAPNET IN '82 TO 5.83/TRAPNET IN '85. THE AGE CLASS DISTRIBUTION IN '85 IS SIMILAR TO WHAT EXISTED IN '82, WITH A DOMINATE II AGE CLASS, FOLLOWED BY A FAIR III AGE CLASS. A LOW NORTHERN PIKE POPULATION REMAINS UNCHANGED SINCE THE '82 SURVEY, NOW AVERAGING 1.00/GILLNET COMPARED TO 1.72/GILLNET IN '82. THE PRESENT NORTHERN POPULATION IS YOUNGER AND DOMINATED BY II AND III AGE CLASS FISH COMPARED TO A DOMINATE V AGE CLASS IN 82. WALLEYES STILL REMAIN AT A LOW LEVEL OF ABUNDANCE AS THEY DID IN THE '82 SURVEY. INCREASED STOCKING EFFORTS HAVE FAILED TO INCREASE WALLEYE NUMBERS SINCE THE '82 SURVEY. WALLEYES NOW AVERAGE 1.00/GILLNET COMPARED TO 0.90/GILLNET IN '82 NETTING. CARP AND BLACK BULLHEADS HAVE EXPERI- ENCED SIZABLE DECLINES SINCE '82. CARP AVERAGED 38.25/TRAPNET IN '82 AND WERE DOMINATED BY A STRONG YEAR CLASS OF SMALL CARP. CARP NOW AVERAGE 6.67/TRAPNET, AND IT IS BELIEVED TO BE THE SAME DOMINATE YEAR CLASS PRESENT AS IN '82. BLACK BULL- HEAD WERE ABUNDANT IN 82, AVERAGING 172.81/GILLNET AND NOW HAVE DECLINED TO 53.75/GILLNET. OTHER FISH POPULATIONS HAVE EXPERIENCED LITTLE CHANGE AND ARE FOUND IN LOW TO FAIR NUMBERS; THEY INCLUDE YELLOW PERCH, WHITE SUCKER, PUMPKINSEED, YELLOW BULLHEAD, BIGMOUTH BUFFALO, AND LARGEMOUTH BASS.</p>",
