                "narrative": "<p>McKinney Lake is a small, moderately fertile lake located in Grand Rapids, Minnesota.  McKinney Lake has a surface area of 115 acres, a littoral area of 99 acres, and a maximum depth of 34 feet. The water was bog stained with a Secchi disk transparency of 6 feet.  McKinney Lake is within the Mississippi River Watershed, receiving water from a bog on the northwest shore with an outlet to Ice Lake.   <br> \n <br> \nThe Fisheries Lake Management Plan (LMP) was last revised in 2002.  Northern Pike and Black Crappie were the primary management species and Largemouth Bass and Bluegill were secondary species.  A population assessment was conducted in July of 2014 to assess the status of the fish community.  This assessment consisted of 4 gill nets and 8 trap nets. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie were the most common fish captured in gill nets.  The catch was the highest recorded for McKinney Lake, and was high compared to lakes with similar habitats.  Size structure was poor as crappie length ranged from 5.8 to 10.8 inches and averaged 7.2 inches.  Black Crappie populations often exhibit irregular recruitment resulting in dominant year classes, shifting age and size structures, and inconsistent angler success.  Size structure is expected to vary with recruitment.  Six year classes were present (age 2-8) and the 2011 and 2010 year classes comprised 45% and 27% of the catch.  Growth was somewhat slow as crappie averaged 8.2 inches by age 5.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike populations typically exhibit density dependent growth.  Average size and growth are typically poor when pike occur at high densities so lower densities are often desirable.  The 2014 catch was the highest observed for McKinney Lake and was high compared to similar lakes.   Despite the high density, size structure was good, as pike ranged from 18.5 to 31.5 inches and averaged 24.5 inches.  PSD (21 inches) was 84 and RSD-P was 14, meeting the goals outlined in 2002.  Many pike populations are dominated by younger fish, with few fish exceeding age 5.  In contrast, 30% of the sampled pike from McKinney were age-7 or older, suggesting low adult mortality.  Growth was near the statewide average as pike averaged 23.7 inches by age 6.  Low adult harvest has probably contributed to the good size structure.  Angler can help maintain pike quality by releasing pike over 22 inches. <br> \n <br> \nMcKinney Lake has a long history of poor perch catches.  The Yellow Perch catch was low compared to similar lakes, but typical for McKinney Lake.  Yellow Perch appear to occur at too low of a density and are too small to interest anglers but may provide an important prey item for predatory fish.  High pike numbers likely contribute to the low catch of Yellow Perch. <br> \n <br> \nBluegills were captured at a rate typical for the lake type, but below average for McKinney Lake. McKinney Lake has a long history of producing small Bluegill.  In 2014, size structure was similar to past assessments as Bluegill ranged from 3.1 to 8.4 inches with an average of 5.3 inches.  Seven year classes were present and recruitment appeared inconsistent.  Growth was near the lake class average with Bluegill averaging 6.5 inches by age 7.   <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled included Bowfin, Green Sunfish, Hybrid Sunfish, Pumpkinseed, and Yellow Bullhead. <br> \n <br> \nMcKinney Lake is infested with Eurasian Milfoil.  The City owned boat launch has been closed for summer use but anglers can carry in small boats or canoes. The access is open for winter use.  Anglers and boaters are reminded to help stop the spread of invasive species by removing all aquatic plants from boats, trailers, and equipment.  All drain plugs must be removed and live and bait wells must be drained before leaving the access.  Anglers and boaters are encouraged to power wash and thoroughly dry all equipment prior to use in another water body.    <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Eurasian milfoil was discovered in McKinney Lake this year.  This species formed dense mats and was widespread, therefore an aggressive whole lake treatment with fluridone herbicide was conducted this summer.  It is expected that Eurasian milfoil will be reduced below detection levels for 3-4 years, however, it is likely that Eurasian milfoil will return.  One reason for this population assessment is to document any possible changes in the fish community since the Eurasian milfoil invasion.McKinney Lake is relatively shallow with abundant vegetation.  With a shallow basin and abundant vegetation, the lake is managed primarily for largemouth bass and panfish.  Seven largemouth bass were sampled during electrofishing which resulted in a catch rate of  20.5/h.  The largemouth bass were generally small and varied in length from 4 to 13 inches.  Catch rates in gill nets and trap nets were 0.3/set for each gear which is lower than expected for similar lakes.  Largemouth bass up to 18 inches were sampled in trap nets and gill nets.  Mckinney Lake is popular with ice anglers looking for black crappie.  Black crappie are abundant with a gill net catch of 11.8/set, which is higher than expected for similar lakes.  Although black crappie are abundant, they are generally small with very few fish exceeding 9 inches.  Natural reproduction is consistent with fish from the 94 through 97 year classes present.  Smaller black crappie are likely present, however, their small size allows them to avoid capture in our nets.  Bluegill abundance in trap nets was 15/set and is within the expected range for similar lakes.  Bluegill were generally small with no fish exceeding 7.5 inches in trap nets.  Only two yellow perch were sampled in this assessment. Northern pike abundance was 13.8/gill net and is above the expected range for similar lakes.  Northern pike varied in length from 14 to 29 inches.  </p>",
