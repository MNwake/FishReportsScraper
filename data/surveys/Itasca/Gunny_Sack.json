                "narrative": "<p>Gunny Sack Lake is a 78 acre lake located 15 miles southeast of Bigfork in central Itasca County.  The lake is part of the Mississippi River Watershed, has a maximum depth of 13 feet with moderate water quality, and is in lake class 37.  Gunny Sack Lake has one public access on the north shore and the entire shoreline is county owned    Northern pike were the primary predator in Gunny Sack Lake.  The catch rate of 8.7 per gillnet was within the expected range and is normal for this lake type.  Although growth was similar to the statewide average, northern pike size structure was poor with no pike larger than 25 inches sampled.   Pike reached a mean length of 22 inches at age 6, however, no pike were sampled that exceeded age six.Black crappie were of average abundance with relatively small size structure.  However, the present size structure may be due to irregular recruitment since most crappie sampled were age-2, 3, or 4, and only 2 crappie exceeded age-5.  Growth was relatively slow for age-2, 3, and 4 crappie, and similar to statewide average for age 1, 5, and 6.  As the present population matures the size structure should improve.The trap-net catch rate of 13.8 bluegill per net was similar to the median catch rate for lake class 37 of 10.3 per net.  Although bluegill grew at relatively fast rates the size structure was poor and the majority of bluegill were smaller than 6.0 inches total length.Yellow perch were abundant and small with a maximum length of 6.6 inches.  Perch provide an important prey base for northern pike</p>",
