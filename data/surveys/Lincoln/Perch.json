Although public access can be gained through a small tract of MN DNR property, no public boat ramp exists.  The road to the access has been closed during recent years due to high water; lake levels have risen from 9 to 18.5 feet since 1979.     Perch Lake is managed primarily for walleye and their catch in 1994 was more than 10 times the normal range for similar lakes.  A substantial number of walleye were present from 16-20 inches and these fish had grown well.  The majority of the walleye caught were from stocked years.  A strong natural year class was also noted for the first time out of four investigations (1968, 1987, 1990, and 1994), indicating walleye can reproduce naturally in this lake given the proper conditions.  However, walleye stocking will be continued to help insure a more consistent fishery.     A high population of northern pike was also present in 1994.  The majority of these fish were naturally produced in 1993.  These fish will be around 20 inches during 1995, and along with the high walleye population should provide good fishing.     Although a very abundant bullhead population was present historically, only a few, large bullhead were sampled in 1994.  It appears this species is being controlled through predation by walleye, and possibly northern pike.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Perch is a small, productive lake located north of Ivanhoe in Lincoln County.  The fishery is managed primarily for walleye, northern pike and yellow perch.      Black bullhead dominated the 2000 Perch Lake fishery.  They averaged 9.6 inches and offered a quality angling opportunity.  However, it appears the population has been underutilized and is likely limiting game fish populations.  Therefore, commercial fishing will be encourged to reduce the black bullhead numbers.          The walleye catch rate was within management plan goals, but was the lowest recorded since 1987.  Walleye ranged from 11.4-28.6 inches, although the majority were 13.0-14.0 inches.  Growth rates were slow, with age 4 walleye averaging 14.9 inches compared to the southern Minnesota average of 17.5 inches.  An abundant forage fish population recorded in 2000 will likely increase growth rates.       Approximately 84,000 walleye fry are stocked into Perch Lake two of every three years (2000 was not a stocked year).  Fall electrofishing conducted to assess young-of-year walleye (YWAE) abundance indicated a very weak 2000 year class.  Data suggests that fry stocking is primarily responsible for maintaining the walleye population.  Fall electrofishing conducted 1998 and 1999 suggested abundant YWAE were present in those years.  However, those year classes failed to add substantially to the fishery, due most likely to competition/predation by the abundant bullhead population.  To compensate for missing year classes, carry-over walleye (0.8 fish/pound) were stocked in 2000.  Carry-over stocking may be utilized in the future if the bullhead population remains high and assessments continue to show missing year classes.          Northern pike were found in low abundance in 2000.  Poor spring spawning conditions during the past few years have limited reproductive success.  An abundant northern pike population was recorded in 1994.  The majority of these fish came from 1993, a year with good spring runoff.  Reported high angler success reduced the population considerably by 1997, as indicated by the 1997 population assessment.  Normal to above normal spring runoff is likely in 2001 and could increase the reproductive success of northern pike.       Yellow perch were moderately abundant.  Perch up to 11.7 inches were caught, but the majority ranged from 5.0-7.0 inches.  Yellow perch growth rates were good with age 4 fish averaging 10.7 inches compared to a southern Minnesota average of 7.7 inches.  Quarter-inch trap nets and fall electrofishing indicated an abundant 2000 year class was present.  If this year class experiences moderate survival, a quality yellow perch fishery will develop in Perch Lake over the next few years.     Adult bluegill were stocked in 1989.  Adults have been sampled in low abundance in the assessments following the stocking.  However, young-of-year have not been sampled and only a limited population has developed.     Other species documented during the 2000 population assessment include abundant fathead minnows and low numbers of black crappie, green sunfish, Iowa darter, largemouth bass and white sucker.      The Perch Lake fishery is in fair condition.  The walleye and yellow perch populations are within the expected range for similar lakes.  Although northern pike populations are currently low, good spawning conditions in the spring of 2001 will likely enhance reproductive success.  The black bullhead population is abundant and would offer a quality angling opportunity.  Management plans for Perch Lake include stocking 84,000 walleye fry in two of three years, annual fall electrofishing to assess YWAE abundance, annual winter dissolved oxygen monitoring and fish house counts and a population assessment every third year to evaluate management practices.   </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>     Perch Lake is located in western Minnesota approximately 4 miles northwest of Ivanhoe in Lincoln County.  It is a productive prairie lake with a surface area of 224 acres and a maximum depth of 16 feet.  An unimproved gravel access is present along the lake's east border.  Parking is restricted and anglers are required to park along the road some distance from the access location. <br> \n     Perch Lake has a diverse game fish population including walleye, northern pike, yellow perch, bluegill, largemouth bass, and black bullhead.  Nine fisheries assessments have been conducted since 1987 and all these species have occasionally existed at high numbers.  Recently the lake has experienced an increase in submerged vegetation, and increases in bluegill and largemouth bass numbers.  Adult bluegill and largemouth bass were moderately abundant during 2012, however most of them were smaller than what anglers would prefer.  Their growth rates were good and they should eventually provide better quality fishing.  Young-of-year bluegill and largemouth bass were very abundant, indicating good natural reproduction by both species. <br> \n     Walleye were moderately abundant and most fish were around 18 inches.  Although walleye have experienced some natural reproduction, success has generally been poor and the population has been maintained by stocking.  Walleye are stocked as needed based on the existing walleye population, walleye condition, and available forage. <br> \n     Northern pike were moderately abundant and they measured 16-27 inches.  Almost all the pike were three years old or less.  Pike grow fast in southern Minnesota and typically do not live to be very old.   <br> \n     Moderate numbers of adult yellow perch were also present and with most fish 5-8 inches.  Young-of-year yellow perch were very abundant. <br> \n     Although moderate populations of larger walleye and northern pike were present, fishing for them was likely slow due to the high number of young-of-year game fish available as forage.</p>",

Walleye is the primary management species, with secondary emphasis being placed on the yellow perch and northern pike fisheries.  The special assessment conducted was aimed at evaluating the young-of-year (YOY) walleye population using nighttime electrofishing.  In the spring of 2008, 83,526 walleye fry were stocked into Perch Lake.  Prior to stocking the fry were marked with oxytetracycline (OTC).  No YOY walleye were sampled, indicating minimal survival of the stocked walleye fry.  Despite the absence of YOY walleye, numerous largemouth bass, sunfish, and yellow perch were observed.  Perch Lake is scheduled for a population assessment in 2009. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Perch Lake is located in western Minnesota approximately four miles northwest of Ivanhoe in Lincoln County.  It is a productive prairie lake with a surface area of 224 acres and a maximum depth of 16 feet.  An unimproved gravel access is present along the lake's east border.  Parking is restricted and anglers are required to park along the road some distance from the access location. <br> \n <br> \nPerch Lake has a diverse game fish community including Walleye, Northern Pike, Yellow Perch, Bluegill, Largemouth Bass, and Black Bullhead.  Ten fisheries assessments have been conducted since 1987 and all these species have been abundant at times.  Recently the lake has experienced an increase in submerged vegetation, and increases in Bluegill and Largemouth Bass numbers.  Adult Bluegill and Largemouth Bass have yet to reach high abundance and most were smaller than what anglers would prefer.  They should eventually provide better quality fishing.  Young-of-year Largemouth Bass were abundant in 2015, indicating good natural reproduction, however, few young Bluegill were observed. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye were abundant and most fish were greater than 20 inches.  Although Walleye have experienced some natural reproduction, spawning success has generally been poor and the population has been maintained by stocking.  Walleye are stocked as needed based on existing Walleye numbers, condition, and suitable forage. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike numbers were low.  Pike grow fast in southern Minnesota and typically do not live to be very old.  All pike were between 1 and 4 years old.   Fishing for Walleye and Northern Pike may be slow due to abundant available forage. <br> \n <br> \nHigh numbers of adult Yellow Perch were present in the 2015 survey.  These fish ranged from 5 to 9 inches and averaged 8 inches.  Young-of-year Yellow Perch were very abundant.  Anglers reported good catches of Yellow Perch during winter of 2016. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Perch Lake is located in western Minnesota approximately four miles northwest of Ivanhoe in Lincoln County.  It is a productive prairie lake with a surface area of 224 acres and a maximum depth of 18 feet.  An unimproved gravel access is present along the lake's east border.  Parking is restricted and anglers must park along the road some distance from the access location.   <br> \n <br> \nA targeted survey of the nearshore fish community in Perch Lake was conducted July 12-13 and August 4, 2021 by Ortonville Area Fisheries staff.  Ten stations were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 15-foot seine.  Nearshore sampling captured 8 native species of fish including Iowa Darter, which was the only intolerant species observed.  Other species were Fathead Minnow, Green Sunfish, Hybrid Sunfish, Largemouth Bass, Northern Pike, Yellow Perch and Black Bullhead. <br> \n <br> \nData from this targeted nearshore survey is combined with data from a standard gill and trap netting survey (June 2021) to calculate a Fish-based Index of Biologic Integrity (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment.  The FIBI score is composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics and indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. The 2021 FIBI score for Perch Lake is near the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes.  Data from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Minnesota River (Yellow Medicine) Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.   For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

It is a productive lake that measures 224 acres with a maximum depth of 16 feet.  A gravel access is present along the lake\u0019s east border.  Perch\u0019s fish population is diverse and anglers can expect to catch walleye, largemouth bass, bluegill, yellow perch, northern pike, and black bullhead.  Although some walleye natural reproduction occurs, the population has generally been maintained by fry stocking.  Commercial fisherman have at times harvested bullheads when they were abundant.  Future DNR Fisheries management activities will include fish stocking, monitoring of winter oxygen levels, and fish assessments.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Perch Lake is located in western Minnesota approximately four miles northwest of Ivanhoe in Lincoln County.  It is a productive prairie lake with a surface area of 224 acres and a maximum depth of 18 feet.  An unimproved gravel access is present along the lake's east border.  Parking is restricted and anglers must park along the road some distance from the access location.  This 2021 survey was conducted to collect routine fish data using gill nets, standard survey trap nets and quarter-inch trap nets.  These data can be compared to historical standard and targeted survey data from Perch Lake.   <br> \n <br> \nPerch Lake has a diverse game fish community including Walleyes, Northern Pike, Yellow Perch, Bluegills, Largemouth Bass and Black Bullheads.  The abundances of these species have substantially fluctuated over time, likely due to changes in habitat, namely increases in water clarity and vegetation abundance.   <br> \n <br> \nWalleyes were relatively low in abundance during 2021 but had a large average size.  They ranged from 20 to 28 inches, averaging 23 inches.  Although Walleyes have experienced some natural reproduction, spawning success has generally been poor and the population has been maintained by stocking.  Walleye fry are routinely stocked and advanced life stages are also stocked on occasion when necessary to supplement the population.   <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch numbers were high but size was small as only 3% were 8 inches or larger.  Northern Pike numbers were higher than they had been in several years.  Pike averaged 23 inches and the largest was 28 inches.  Pike grow fast in southern Minnesota and typically do not live beyond five years.  Bluegills were caught in relatively high numbers, but average size was only 4 inches.  Many yearling Largemouth bass were present but few adults were found in the survey.  Although, reports from anglers indicate fishing for larger bass can be good at times.  Black Bullhead and Black Crappie numbers were low in the 2021 survey. <br> \n <br> \nBeginning May 2018, new regulations for Northern Pike are in effect. Perch Lake is in the Southern management zone meaning anglers/spearers are allowed to possess 2 pike with a minimum size of 24 inches. See the regulations booklet for more details. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>THE DOMINANT FISH SPECIES IN THE LAKE IS BLACK BULLHEAD.  TRAPNET CATCHES HAVE DECREASED SLIGHTLY SINCE THE INITIAL SURVEY IN 1987, FROM 658 TO 613 PER SET.  HOWEVER, TRAPNET CATCHES ARE STILL 64 TIMES GREATER THAN THE LOCAL MEDIAN.  MEAN LENGTH OF BULLHEADS COLLECTED IN TRAPS INCREASED FROM 5.0 INCHES TO 5.9 INCHES SINCE 1987.  WALLEYE IS THE PRIMARY SPECIES MANAGED IN THE LAKE.  THE POP- ULATION HAS BEEN SUSTAINED BY FRY STOCKING.  HOW- EVER, FINGERLING STOCKING WAS INITIATED IN 1989. IT WAS FELT THAT THERE WAS HEAVY PREDATION OF WALLEYE FRY BY BULLHEADS AND STOCKING FINGERLINGS WOULD IMPROVE SURVIVAL.  WALLEYE NUMBERS HAVE INCREASED IN BOTH GILLNET AND TRAPNET CATCHES SINCE THE INITIAL SURVEY.  GILLNET CATCHES HAVE INCREASED FROM 3.0 TO 5.3 PER LIFT.  TRAPNET CATCHES INCREASED FROM 0.3 PER SET IN 1987 TO 3.7 PER SET IN 1990.  THE AVERAGE LENGTH OF WALLEYE HAS DECREASED FROM 18.9 TO 12.9 INCHES AND AVERAGE WEIGHT HAS DECREASED FROM 2.6 TO 1.8 POUNDS SINCE 1987.  THIS DECREASE CAN BE ATTRIBUTED TO THE COLLECTION OF PROPORTIONALLY MORE SMALL YOUNG FISH IN THE PRESENT SURVEY.  IN THIS ASSESSMENT ALL AGE CLASSES OF WALLEYE FROM 1+TO 10+ WERE REPRESENTED EXCEPT FOR 5 YEAR OLDS.  THE STRONGEST YEAR CLASSES CORRESPOND TO STOCKED YEARS BUT NATURAL REPRODUCTION IS OCCURRING.  OVERALL, GROWTH OF THE WALLEYES APPEARED NORMAL FOR THIS AREA.  GILLNET NUMBERS AND POUNDS PER SET WERE 1.9 AND 6.3 TIMES THE LOCAL MEDIAN, RESPECTIVELY.  BLUEGILL WERE STOCKED IN PERCH LAKE THE FIRST TIME IN 1989. THESE FISH WERE ADULTS FROM A STUNTED BLUEGILL POPULATION IN A GLENWOOD AREA LAKE.  THE BLUEGILLS AVERAGED 6 PER POUN WHEN STOCKED.  WHEN CAPTURED DURING THIS SURVEY THEY HAD INCREASED IN SIZE TO 1.9 FISH PER POUND.  INITIAL GROWTH OF THE BLUE- GILLS WAS SLOW, BUT THEY EXHIBITED FAST GROWTH IN THE YEAR SINCE THEY WERE STOCKED.  THE IS PROBABLY DUE TO THE LACK IF INTRASPECIFIC COMPETITION FOR FOOD AND SPACE.  BLUEGILL ADULTS WERE STOCKED WITH THE HOPE THAT THEY WOULD REPRODUCE AND ESTABLISH A POPULATION.  NO BLUEGILL OFFSPRING WERE OBSERVED IN SEINING.  YELLOW PERCH WERE SAMPLED FOR THE FIRST TIME IN THIS ASSESSMENT.  ACCORDING TO A LOCAL LANDOWNER, PERCH WERE PRIVATELY STOCKED BY LOCAL INDIVIDUALS.  THESE FISH WERE COMPRISED OF THREE AND FOUR YEAR OLDS THAT EXHIBIT FAST GROWTH. MEAN LENGTH OF THE PERCH WAS 8.2 INCHES.  THE GILLNET NUMBER PER SET WAS 3.7 TIMES LESS THAN THE LOCAL MEDIAN.  NORTHERN PIKE WERE NOT SAMPLED IN 1987 BUT 10 FISH WERE NETTED IN THIS SURVEY.  THEY HAD A MEAN LENGTH OF 26.1 INCHES AND A MEAN WEIGHT OF 3.6 POUNDS.  THE FISH REPRESENTED THREE YEAR CLASSES, 2+TO 4+ AND WERE FAST GROWING.  NINE OF THE TEN NORTHER PIKE WERE CAUGHT IN TRAPNETS.  THE TRAPNET NUMBER PER SET WAS 3.5 TIMES THE LOCAL MEDIAN.  POUNDS PER SET WAS 4.4 TIMES THE LOAL MEDIAN.  OTHER FISH CAUGHT FOR THE FIRST TIME WERE WHITE SUCKER AND A LARGE NUMBER OF HYBRID SUNFISH. THE NUMBER OF HYBRID SUNFISH PER TRAPNET SET WAS 21 TIMES THE STATE MEDIAN.  SHORELINE SEINING HAS BEEN USED TO SAMPLE YOUNG OF THE YEAR (YOY) WALLEYE WITH LITTLE SUCCESS.  ONLY ONE YOY WALLEYE HAS BEEN CAPTURED IN THREE YEARS OF SEINING.  THE USUAL FISH SAMPLED IN SEINING HAVE BEEN BLACK BULLHEAD AND FATHEAD MINNOW.  IN THIS ASSESSMENT 1/4 INCH TRAPNETS WERE ALSO SET TO DETERMINE WHETHER YOY WALLEYES COULD BE SAMPLED IN THIS WAY. NO YOY WERE CAPTURED, BUT TEN WALLEYES RANGING IN LENGTH FROM 6.8 INCHES (YEARLING) TO 24.9 INCHES WERE CAPTURED.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Perch Lake is located in western Minnesota approximately four miles northwest of Ivanhoe in Lincoln County.  It is a productive prairie lake with a surface area of 224 acres and a maximum depth of 18 feet.  An unimproved gravel access is present along the lake's east border.  Parking is restricted and anglers are required to park along the road some distance from the access location. <br> \n <br> \nTwelve fish surveys have occurred since 1968.   This 2018 survey was conducted to collect routine fish data using gill nets, 0.75-inch trap nets and 0.25-inch trap nets.  These data can be compared to historical standard and targeted survey data from Perch Lake.  Beginning May 2018, new regulations for Northern Pike are in effect.  Perch Lake is in the Southern management zone meaning anglers/spearers are allowed to possess 2 pike with a minimum size of 24 inches.  See the regulations booklet for more details. <br> \n <br> \nPerch Lake has a diverse game fish community including Walleyes, Northern Pike, Yellow Perch, Bluegills, Largemouth Bass and Black Bullheads.  The abundances of these species have substantially fluctuated over time, likely due to changes in habitat.  Walleyes were moderately abundant during 2018 from a wide range of sizes up to 31 inches.  Although Walleyes have experienced some natural reproduction, spawning success has generally been poor and the population has been maintained by stocking.  Walleye fry are routinely stocked and advanced life stages are also stocked on occasion when necessary to supplement the population.  Yellow Perch adults were abundant.  Adults were 5 -11 inches, and they averaged 8 inches.  Young-of-year Yellow Perch were very abundant.  Northern Pike numbers were low.  Pike averaged 24 inches with the largest at 33 inches.  Pike grow fast in southern Minnesota and typically do not live beyond five years.  Adult Bluegills were caught in moderate numbers, where few adult Largemouth Bass were caught.  Young-of-year of both species were abundant.   <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of the nearshore fish community in Perch Lake was conducted July 16-17, 2018 by Ortonville Area Fisheries staff.  Ten stations were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 15-foot seine.  Nearshore sampling captured 7 native species of fish including Iowa Darter which was the only intolerant species observed.  Other species were Fathead Minnow, Green Sunfish, Hybrid Sunfish, Largemouth Bass, Yellow Perch and Black Bullhead. <br> \n <br> \nData from this targeted nearshore survey is combined with data from a standard gill and trap netting survey (June 2018) to calculate a Fish-based Index of Biologic Integrity (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment.  The FIBI score is composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics and indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. The 2018 FIBI score for Perch Lake is near the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes.  Data from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Minnesota River (Yellow Medicine) Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.   For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Perch Lake is a nutrient rich, 224 acre lake located in west-central Minnesota.  Although public access can be gained through a small tract of MN DNR property, no public boat ramp exists.  The township road leading to the access has been closed during recent years due to high water (lake levels have risen from 9 to 18.5 feet since 1979).  The fishery is managed for walleye, northern pike, and yellow perch.     Perch Lake was dominated by large numbers of black bullhead and yellow perch in 1997.  Bullhead were abundant at most sizes up to 11 inches, whereas most yellow perch measured from 7-10 inches.  Although walleye numbers exceeded what is considered normal for lakes like Perch Lake, the population was substantially lower than what it was in 1994.  The majority of the walleye were good sized, generally measuring 18 inches or larger.  Northern pike abundance had also decreased dramatically since 1994.  The substantial decreases in walleye and northern pike populations apparently resulted from high angler harvest during a particularly good 1995 fishing season.     Perch Lake is stocked with walleye fry.  It was recently switched from alternate year stockings to two of three year stockings in an attempt to produce a more consistent walleye population.  Stronger walleye year classes have generally corresponded to stockings, however some natural reproduction has also occurred.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Perch Lake is located in Lincoln County near Ivanhoe, MN.  Walleye is the primary management species, with secondary emphasis being placed on the yellow perch and northern pike fisheries. <br> \n <br> \nThe last survey was conducted in 2003, and walleye abundance was similar in 2006.  Size also remained stable; walleyes in 2003 averaged 15.8 inches long and 1.9 lbs., and walleyes in 2006 averaged 15.9 inches long and 2.2 lbs.  Fish up to 13 years old were sampled, but 81% of the walleyes aged were one (2005 year-class), four (2002 year-class), or five (2001 year-class) years old.  The abundance of these year-classes should provide excellent fishing in the coming years, provided that abundant forage does not reduce angler success.  Walleye fry were not stocked into Perch Lake in 2006, but two young-of-year walleye were sampled with quarter-inch trap nets indicating some natural reproduction occurred.  Fall electrofishing did not sample any young-of-year walleye.  However, a significant algae bloom was present during the sampling and seriously decreased visibility. <br> \n <br> \nBlack bullhead numbers remain high, but were below levels seen in 2003.  Most of the bullheads were small and averaged 7-9 inches and half a pound.  Fish predation and commercial fishing operations will continue to keep bullhead numbers in check.   <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch numbers were increasingly higher in 2006 than in 2000 or 2003.  Most of the perch are young (1 and 2 years old; 2004 and 2005 year-classes), with an average size of 8 inches long and 0.3 lb.  This size is similar to previous surveys.  Young-of-year yellow perch were abundant, indicating a strong year-class for 2006.  Anglers should expect excellent fishing for 9-inch perch in the coming years. <br> \n <br> \nBluegills have never been very abundant in Perch Lake, but abundance was down from 2003 with an average size of only 3.5 inches long and 0.03 lb.  All bluegills aged were one year-old (2005 year class) except one, which was seven years old.  Growth was above average for the age-1 bluegills.  Few young-of-year were sampled, suggesting a weak 2006 year-class exists. <br> \n <br> \nNight electrofishing for largemouth bass was conducted in early June.  Largemouth bass abundance was down from 2003, primarily because of the loss of fish from the 2001 year-class.  Two-year-old bass (2001 year-class) were 92% of the bass aged in 2003, but only four bass from the 2001-year class were sampled during electrofishing in 2006.  Most of the bass sampled in 2006 were one-year-old and four inches long.  However, bass up to almost 15 inches long were also sampled. <br> \n <br> \nOne channel catfish was captured in 1/4-inch trap nets. This is the first time this species has ever been sampled in Perch Lake.  Other fish sampled in low abundance were northern pike, green sunfish, and orangespotted sunfish.   <br> \n <br> \nFuture management activities for Perch Lake include fish stocking as needed, monitoring of winter dissolved oxygen and fishing pressure, and surveys to evaluate young-of-year fish success.</p>",

Access to the lake can be gained though a road right-of-way on the east side of the lake.       Walleye fry, fingerlings and adults have been frequently stocked since 1979.  According to available data, stocking has been primarily responsible for maintaining the walleye population in Perch Lake.  Walleye were moderately abundant in 2003.  Sampled walleye ranged from 6-27 inches with the majority measuring 16-20 inches.  Walleye growth was mixed.  Walleye grew slowly until they were large enough to use small bullhead as food, and then they grew fast.  Recent year classes of walleye have survived poorly due to black bullhead competition/predation.  To offset this, a supplemental stocking of larger, adult walleye is scheduled for 2004.     Bluegill were also moderately abundant in 2003.  Assessments had indicated only a marginal self-sustaining population was created following an adult bluegill stocking in 1989.  Bluegill first appeared in fair numbers in a natural reproduction investigation in 2001.  Improved aquatic vegetation abundance and diversity have likely resulted in increased bluegill reproduction.  All bluegill sampled in 2003 belonged to the 2000 and 2001 year class.  Growth was fast and many of the bluegill sampled measured 6.5-8.0 inches.      Largemouth bass were abundant in 2003.  Although sampled bass measured less than 12.0 inches, larger individuals have been sampled in recent investigations.       Black bullhead were extremely abundant.  The vast majority of bullhead measured less than six inches, although a good number of quality fish measuring 10.0-13.0 inches were also present.  Commercial fishing had harvested over 20,000 pounds of adult bullhead in 2001/2002.  Commercial fishing for black bullhead was conducted again in 2003/2004.     Northern pike and yellow perch were sampled in low abundance in 2003.  Northern pike measured 20.0-26.0 inches and yellow perch measured 5-10 inches.       Future fisheries management activities for Perch Lake include annual monitoring of winter dissolved oxygen and fishing pressure, stocking as needed, annual investigations to assess young-of-year walleye abundance, and assessments every third year to evaluate fisheries populations.</p>",
