Median length was 16\" (range = 13-24\").  Ages II and III each comprised 42% of the sample and showed good growth.Bluegill abundance (35.75/trapnet) was also average.  Average size (.10 lb) was small with median length of 4.5\" (range = 3.0-8.0\").  About 9% of the measured bluegills were at least 7.0 inches long.Largemouth bass was also taken in average numbers (0.75/trapnet).  Too few were caught to provide additional information.Black crappie abundance was also average at 2.25/trapnet.  Four age classes were sampled and growth bordered on slow.  Crappies averged 0.32 lb, average for the lake class.Walleye (1.0/gillnet) was caught in average numbers for the lake class but abundance was below expectations for a fishable population.  Yellow perch were not sampled in 1991 but were caught in good numbers in 1960.Yellow bullhead (6.0/trapnet) was caught in average numbers in trapnets but in high numbers (72.0 gillnet) in the gillnets.  Median length was 10.0\" and some 12\" fish were taken in gillnets.  Average size was 0.50 lb in trapnets and (0.56 lb in gillnets), again, average for the lake class.</p>",
