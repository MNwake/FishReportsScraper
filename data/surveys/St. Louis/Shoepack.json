Musky, white sucker and yellow perch are the primary fish species present.     Musky numbers have increased from the 1970s and 1980s and were more than double the average for lakes like Shoepack.  The majority of the muskies sampled in 1999 were ages 5 and 6.  Average length was 26.0 inches although only one musky (30.1 inches) was legal harvest size (30.0 inches).     White sucker and yellow perch were generally under 10 inches in length and at low to average numbers.  The high musky population has kept these forage species well in check.     Although lacking in trophy potential, the musky's fighting ability and the lake's scenic beauty make Shoepack Lake a desireable destination.</p>",
