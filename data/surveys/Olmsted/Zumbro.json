Bluegills, l.m. bass, s.m. bass, and white bass are present, but in low numbers. Roughfish including suckers, redhorse, carp, carpsuckers, and bullheads are plentiful.Channel catfish are abundant and of a large enough size to be of interest to anglers.The main factors limiting gamefish populations in Lake Zumbro are siltation, roughfish action, excessive water fertility, and damage to spawning areas from passing boats. Unless these problems are solved, there appears to be no chance of developing high gamefish populations. However, channel catfish are able to thrive in L. Zumbro despite the above problems. Natural reproduction has built the catfish population to a high level making further stocking unnecessary at this time. The channel catfish is a desirable fish and angling for them should be encouraged.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Zumbro is a long, narrow impoundment created by a hydro-electric dam on the Zumbro River.  It is characterized by a rocky shoreline that drops off quickly into deep water.  Since submerged aquatic vegetation is almost entirely absent, fish rely on cover such as submerged logs and boulders around the lake's shoreline.  Past surveys of Lake Zumbro consistently reported quality channel catfish and largemouth bass fisheries.  This report is no exception.  The Lake Zumbro channel catfish population is presently in very good condition.  Good numbers of fish from multiple year classes suggests good natural reproduction and favorable living conditions.  Abundance of fish larger than 16 inches is good, and fish approaching 30 inches are not uncommon.  The extent of angling pressure on channel catfish is unknown.  Recent discussions with members of the Zumbro Valley Bass Masters indicate that while there are occasional reports of nice fish being incidentally caught, angler pressure seriously targeting channel catfish may be minimal.    Largemouth and smallmouth bass populations are in very good shape.  Largemouth bass collected with an electrofishing boat averaged 2 pounds each.  Several fish measured between 17 and 20 inches.  Smallmouth bass averaged a little smaller, however fish up to 18 inches were sampled.  Most anglers have good success casting spinner baits or plastic worms into and around submerged logs and trees near the shoreline.Bluegill, black crappie and yellow perch abundance in Lake Zumbro  is considered average to slightly above average when compared to other lakes similar in character.  Because of the lake's shoreline character, panfish angling can be difficult.  Decent sized yellow perch are occasionally caught, especially in the winter.Information from this and past surveys indicates a low abundance of northern pike in Lake Zumbro.  Only four northern pike were collected; three however, ranged from 29 to 36 inches, and were sampled alive near shore.In an attempt to provide a unique fishery for residents of southeastern Minnesota, 300 muskellunge fingerlings were stocked in 1994.  The success of the stocking is uncertain at this time. A spring trapnetting evaluation is planned for 1997.  A stocking of 300 more fingerlings has been proposed for fall 1997.  Section of Fisheries staff will continue to evaluate these stockings to determine its success or failure.  Lake Zumbro has been stocked with walleye and sauger in the past, but for reasons poorly understood, neither species has become established.    </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Zumbro is a 600-acre reservoir created by a hydroelectric dam on the Zumbro River.  Water level and clarity are subject to rapid change due to the river's influence.  It is likely that these fluctuations have a dramatic impact on fish populations.  The reservoir is also affected by habitat change due to sediment loading in the upper reaches.  The fishery is unique in that it has many riverine species available as well as fish species more typical of a lake environment.  It provides good fishing for largemouth and smallmouth bass, bluegill and black crappie.  Northern pike abundance has increased in recent years and fair numbers of northern pike are present with some quality size fish available.  Lake Zumbro also provides a good fishery for channel catfish and many non-game species.  Recent surveys indicated a downward trend in channel catfish abundance but numbers appear to have rebounded at the time of this survey.  Muskellunge were stocked beginning in 1994 and some large fish are present.  A separate management investigation to assess the muskellunge population is currently in progress.  Results of that investigation will determine whether or not muskellunge stocking will continue.  No white bass were sampled in either net type during this survey.  Catches of white bass have fluctuated in past surveys but this is the first survey that none were sampled.  Several fish kills, mainly affecting white bass have been reported in recent years and it appears that white bass numbers have not recovered yet.   </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Status Of The Fishery: <br> \n <br> \nLake Zumbro is a large reservoir on the Zumbro Riverand it is a popular recreation and fishing lake due to its proximity to Rochester, MN. The primary gamefish in the reservoir are Bluegill, Black Crappie, Channel Catfish, Largemouth Bass, Northern Pike, and Smallmouth Bass. A Walleye fingerling stocking program was initiated in 2008. Walleye fingerlings are stocked at a rate of one pound per surface acre (600 pounds total) in even calendar years. <br> \nA major flood in the fall of 2010 made some changes in Lake Zumbro. The public access off of Olmstead County 12 (Sandy Point) is no longer useable due to major sediment deposition. The flood caused the upper end of Lake Zumbro to become shallower at a faster rate than normal deposition.  The large 2010 flood may also have influenced fish populations in the reservoir. There are plans for dredging in the upper end of the reservoir.  <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie populations in Lake Zumbro were excellent in 2015 and good crappie fishing was reported to the Lake City office. Northern Pike and Channel Catfish provide anglers with the opportunity to catch larger gamefish. Channel Catfish numbers have been on the decline and this may be due to sedimentation and habitat changes in the reservoir.  Largemouth and Smallmouth Bass are abundant in the reservoir. <br> \n <br> \nMuskellunge were introduced to Lake Zumbro in 1994 and a substantial number of fingerlings have been stocked periodically since that time.  Assessments of the Muskellunge population have generally shown a very low number of adult fish, but occasional catches and sightings have been reported by anglers.  Muskellunge have established a quality population in the Zumbro River downstream of the Lake Zumbro dam. <br> \n <br> \nAt the time of the 2015 fisheries assessment, four stockings of Walleye fingerlings had taken place since 2008 in even numbered years.  The catch rate of 0.33 Walleye per gill net indicates a low population.  However, night time electrofishing resulted in 31.9 Walleye per hour on-time. Most of these Walleye were likely too small to be sampled in gill nets in early summer and likely were from fingerling stocking in 2014. Anglers have reported catching Walleye in low numbers and it is expected that catch rates will increase as more year classes of are established. <br> \n <br> \nWhite Bass were historically a substantial component of the fishery in Lake Zumbro.  However their numbers have declined drastically and only one was sampled in the 2011 assessment.  Several large die-offs of White Bass have been documented; however a cause was never determined.  It is likely that these die-offs and changes in habitat within the reservoir have limited the potential for White Bass to recover to their former abundance. However, 16 young-of-year sized White Bass were sampled in fall nighttime electrofishing. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Zumbro is a large reservoir on the Zumbro River. It is a popular recreation and fishing lake due to its proximity to Rochester, MN. The primary gamefish in the reservoir are Bluegill, Black Crappie, Channel Catfish, Largemouth Bass, Smallmouth Bass, and Northern Pike.  A walleye stocking program was initiated in 2008 and fingerlings are stocked at a rate of one pound per surface acre (600 pounds total) in even calendar years. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie populations in Lake Zumbro were excellent in the 2018 survey and good crappie fishing was reported to the Lake City office. The Northern Pike and Channel Catfish are present in low numbers and provide anglers with the opportunity to catch larger gamefish. Only one Northern Pike was captured in 2018 and this is the lowest number captured in the survey history of Lake Zumbro. Channel Catfish numbers have been on the decline over time, however catch rates in 2018 (3.0 per gill net) were identical to those observed in 2015.  Largemouth and Smallmouth Bass have historically been abundant in the reservoir, but fall electrofishing could not be completed in 2018 because of weather conditions and lake levels. <br> \n <br> \nMuskellunge were introduced to Lake Zumbro in 1994 and a substantial number of fingerlings have been stocked periodically since that time.  Assessments of the Muskellunge population have generally shown a very low number of adult fish, but occasional catches and sightings have been reported by anglers.  Muskellunge have established a quality population in the Zumbro River downstream of the Lake Zumbro dam. Previous studies have shown that escapement of Muskellunge is common and most fingerlings stocked in Lake Zumbro go over the dam and into the Zumbro River system. Three hundred Muskellunge fingerlings were stocked in Lake Zumbro in 2018. <br> \n   <br> \nAt the time of the 2018 fisheries assessment, five stockings of Walleye fingerlings had taken place since the stocking program was initiated in 2008.  The low catch rate of 0.17 Walleye per gill net suggests that survival and contribution to the fishery are poor.  However, night time electrofishing in 2015 sampled Walleye at a rate of 31.9 per hour on-time.  Anglers have also reported catching Walleye in low numbers and it is expected that catch rates will increase as more year classes of walleye are established.  The morphometry of Lake Zumbro is steep sided in many places and gill nets may not be the best indicator of Walleye abundance in this reservoir.  Two memorable sized walleye were captured in trap nets at the upper end of Lake Zumbro in 2018. This is the portion of the lake that returns into a riverine system and it is possible that many of the stocked walleye use the Zumbro river system upstream of the reservoir. <br> \n  <br> \nWhite Bass were historically a substantial component of the fishery in Lake Zumbro.  However, their numbers have declined drastically over the last 10 to 15 years.  Several large die-offs of White Bass have been documented; however a cause was never determined.  It is likely that these die-offs and changes in habitat within the reservoir have limited the potential for White Bass to recover to their former abundance.  <br> \nNon-game fish species such as Redhorse, Carpsuckers, Common Carp, and Buffalo are abundant in Lake Zumbro. The presence of these species is indicative of the riverine connections above the reservoir. <br> \n <br> \nA dredging project is scheduled to begin in Lake Zumbro in 2019.  Accumulated sediments will be removed from various portions of the reservoir and this will increase the amount of deeper water habitat in the lake.  Post dredging project fisheries surveys are planned for 2020 and 2023 to see how the fish community responds to the habitat changes. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Zumbro is a large reservoir on the Zumbro River.  It is a popular recreation and fishing lake due to its proximity to Rochester, MN.  The primary gamefish species in the reservoir are bluegill, crappie, largemouth and smallmouth bass, northern pike and channel catfish.  A walleye fingerling stocking program was initiated in 2008.  Walleye fingerlings are stocked at a rate of one pound per surface acre (600 pounds total) in even calendar years.  <br> \n <br> \nA major flood in the fall of 2010 made some changes in Lake Zumbro. The public access off of Olmstead County 12 (Sandy Point) is no longer useable due to major sediment deposition. The flood caused the upper end of Lake Zumbro to become shallower at a faster rate than normal deposition.  The large 2010 flood may also have influenced fish populations in the reservoir and results from the 2011 population assessment generally showed population declines for most species compared to the last survey in 2007. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill and crappie populations in Lake Zumbro were lower in 2011, but this reservoir still provides good opportunity for local anglers targeting panfish species.  Northern pike and channel catfish provide anglers with the opportunity to catch larger gamefish.  Largemouth and smallmouth bass are abundant in the reservoir. <br> \n <br> \nMuskellunge were introduced to Lake Zumbro in 1994 and a substantial number of fingerlings have been stocked periodically since that time.  Assessments of the muskellunge population have generally shown a very low number of adult fish, but occasional catches and sightings have been reported by anglers.  Muskellunge have established a quality population in the Zumbro River downstream of the Lake Zumbro dam. <br> \n <br> \nAt the time of the 2011 fisheries assessment, only one year class (2008) of walleye was present in sizes that would have been susceptible to capture in gill nets.  The catch rate of 2.1 walleye per gill net is considered good since it represents only one year class.  Anglers have reported catching walleye in low numbers and it is expected that catch rates will increase as more year classes of walleye are established. <br> \n <br> \nWhite bass were historically a substantial component of the fishery in Lake Zumbro.  However their numbers have declined drastically and only one was sampled in the 2011 assessment.  Several large die-offs of white bass have been documented; however a cause was never determined.  It is likely that these die-offs and changes in habitat within the reservoir have limited the potential for white bass to recover to their former abundance. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Zumbro is a large reservoir on the Zumbro River. It is a popular recreation and fishing lake due to its proximity to Rochester, MN. The primary gamefish in the reservoir are Bluegill, Black Crappie, Channel Catfish, Largemouth Bass, Smallmouth Bass, and Northern Pike. A walleye stocking program was initiated in 2008 and fingerlings are stocked at a rate of one pound per surface acre (600 pounds total) in even numbered years. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie in Lake Zumbro were poorly represented in the trap nets in the 2021 survey, but were sampled in fair numbers in gill nets.  However, most of the Black Crappie were under 8 inches. The Northern Pike numbers were excellent and it was the most Northern Pike sampled in a decade. Channel Catfish are present in low numbers and provide anglers with another opportunity to catch larger gamefish. Channel Catfish numbers have generally been on the decline over time. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth and Smallmouth Bass have historically been abundant in the reservoir, and fall electrofishing confirmed that a good population of both species exists in Lake Zumbro. <br> \n <br> \nMuskellunge were introduced to Lake Zumbro in 1994 and a substantial number of fingerlings have been stocked periodically since that time. Assessments of the Muskellunge population have shown a very low number of adult fish, but occasional catches and sightings have been reported by anglers. Muskellunge have established a quality population in the Zumbro River downstream of the Lake Zumbro dam. Previous studies have shown that escapement of Muskellunge is common and most fingerlings stocked in Lake Zumbro go over the dam and into the Zumbro River system. Lake Zumbro was last stocked Muskellunge in 2018 (150 fingerlings) and 2019 (300 fingerlings). <br> \n <br> \nAt the time of the 2021 fisheries assessment, 6 stockings of Walleye fingerlings had taken place since the stocking program was initiated in 2008. The low catch rate of Walleye per gill net suggests that survival and contribution to the fishery are poor. However, nighttime electrofishing in 2015 sampled Walleye at a rate of 31.9 per hour on-time. Anglers have also reported catching Walleye in low numbers and it is expected that catch rates may increase as more year classes of walleye are established. The morphometry of Lake Zumbro is steep sided in many places and gill nets may not be the best indicator of Walleye abundance in this reservoir. A major dam removal and stream restoration project was completed upstream of Lake Zumbro in recent years. It is hoped that the added riverine habitat will provide spawning area for walleye. <br> \n <br> \nWhite Bass were historically a substantial component of the fishery in Lake Zumbro. However, their numbers have declined drastically over the last 10 to 15 years. Several large die-offs of White Bass have been documented; however, a cause was never determined. It is likely that these die-offs and changes in habitat within the reservoir have limited the potential for White Bass to recover to their former abundance. <br> \n <br> \nNon-game fish species such as redhorse, carpsuckers, Common Carp, and buffalo are abundant in Lake Zumbro. The presence of these species is indicative of the riverine connections above the reservoir. <br> \n <br> \nA dredging project was recently completed in the upper end of Lake Zumbro. The goal was to increase depth along homeowner shorelines, marinas, boat accesses, and navigation channels. Future surveys will be performed to try and observe any effect on the fish communities from the dredging project. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Test netting of the lake indicated a good variety of rough fish (quillback, white sucker, silver redhorse, northern redhorse, carp, black bullhead, and perch). The numbers of silver redhorse, carp, white bass, white crappie, and black crappie caught were above respective state-wide medians (numbers per net set). White sucker, northern redhorse, perch, channel catfish, bluegill, black bullhead, and yellow bullhead numbers were lower than state-wide net catch medians. Although no largemouth or smallmouth bass were caught by gillnets or trapnets, shoreline seining (minnow seine) produced relatively high numbers of young-of-the-year fish of both species.At the present time Lake Zumbro is not producing a desirable amount or variety of gamefish. Crappies and white bass are the most prevalent gamefish. Rough fish, such as carp, carpsucker, and redhorse, are plentiful.Control of rough fish in Lake Zumbro is desirable but this is an immense and difficult task. However, such methods as water level drawdowns (for destroying eggs of rough fish) or use of fish toxicants in specific portions of the lake could be useful management tools. Until such time as deemed feasible, control of rough fish populations will not be considered justifiable.Perhaps conditions for predatory fishes such as walleye and northern pike could be improved if a more suitable forage fish population were present. The experimental stocking of gizzard shad might be a part of the answer for maintaining a better predator population.The gizzard shad is a pelagic species which is prolific and a plankton feeder. It should sustain itself in such habitat as offered by Lake Zumbro where plankton is available but bottom fauna production is curtailed due to the silty and turbid nature of the lake. A direct link is provided by the shad in converting plankton to fish flesh for predatory species. Shad as forage for walleye appears to have been successful in Tennessee. Introduction of gizzard shad is justifiable, and it is expected that as such the stocking of this species would have no more of an adverse effect on the lake and its fish populations than that which has already been experienced through poor land management and rough fish populations. It would be best to wait about two years after introducing shad before stockng walleye and northern pike. This would allow for the establishment of a forage population and subsequent observation and evaluation.      </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Zumbro is a long, narrow impoundment about 600 acres in size created by a hydro-electric dam on the Zumbro River.  It is characterized by a rocky shoreline that drops off quickly into deep water.  Because the lake is technically a river, it provides unique deepwater habitat for native fish such as channel catfish and smallmouth bass.  Other, more traditional \"lake\" species are also present and include largemouth bass, bluegill, black crappie and yellow perch.  In 1994, muskie fingerlings were stocked into Lake Zumbro to provide anglers a new fishing opportunity.  Since then, over 2000 muskie fingerlings have been stocked.  The lake was chosen to receive muskie introductions because of its relatively good size, low abundance of northern pike (a direct competitor) and abundance of forage fish such as sucker and redhorse.  Adult muskie are present in Lake Zumbro with some perhaps >40 inches. A 2002 population assessment generally found gamefish and non-gamefish abundance to be stable.  Large and smallmouth bass are present in good numbers across all size ranges.  Bluegill and black crappie averaged 6.7 and 8.5 inches in length, and are present in good numbers across several size ranges.  Black crappie abundance is above average in Lake Zumbro, providing good fishing during various times throughout the year.  Spring trapnetting to assess muskie stocking success was completed in 2001 and 2002.  Special, large nets were used to target adult muskie near shallow shoreline areas.  A total of 4 muskies have been sampled, ranging in size from 11 to 36 inches.  Probably the two most significant findings from the 2002 assessment is the apparent trends we're seeing with regard to northern pike and channel catfish.  Northern pike abundance has increased from 0/net prior to 1996 to 2.8/net in 2002.  Large northern pike have been collected during spring muskie netting, and it is apparent that successful spawning is occuring somewhere within Lake Zumbro or in one or more of its tributaries.  Because spawning habitat and other water quality characteristics are less than ideal, it is unlikely that northern pike will ever reach densities high enough to negatively impact the muskie fishery.Perhaps of more concern is the downward trend in channel catfish abundance.  From 1977 through 2002, channel catfish have gone from a high of 34.4/net in 1985 to 6.2/net in 2002.  Several reasons for this decline are possible, including changes in spawning habitat.  Property owners around Lake Zumbro often like to clear logs and other woody debris from around their shorelines.  Since channel catfish are cavity nesters, this practice can be destructive to spawning success.  Spawning takes place at water temperatures ranging from 70-75 degrees F.   Rapid changes in water levels as a result of the Rochester Flood Control Project can trigger abrupt changes in water temperature, negatively impacting spawning success.  Anecdotal information from anglers suggest that fishing pressure is light, and harvest is probably minimal, though we do not have creel survey data to verify this.  It is also possible that the population will rebound naturally and that it is simply at the downward end of a cycle.  We will continue to monitor the situation and continue to manage Lake Zumbro primarily for channel catfish and muskellunge, with secondary management priority given to bluegill, black crappie, smallmouth bass and largemouth bass.        </p>",
