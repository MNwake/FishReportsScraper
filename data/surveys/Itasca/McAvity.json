                "narrative": "<p>McAvity Lake is a small, clear lake in south central Itasca County.  A fisheries population assessment was conducted in June of 2007 to assess the status of the fish community.  This assessment included night boat electrofishing to assess the largemouth bass population and test netting with gill and trap nets to assess other species.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie were the most common fish in the gill net and were captured at a high rate when compared to similar lakes.  McAvity Lake has a history of good crappie abundance and the current abundance suggest good angler opportunity for this species.  Size structure was poor, however, as most individuals failed to exceeded 8 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike were also sampled in high abundance.  The gill nets yielded the highest catch of pike observed from McAvity Lake and the catch rate was high compared to similar lakes.  McAvity Lake has historically produced pike in relatively high numbers when compared to similar lakes.  The current size structure suggests moderate angler opportunities for quality-sized individuals, but angler opportunity for large fish is poor as few individuals exceeded 28 inches.  Analysis of bony structures indicated growth near the statewide average.  Most individuals were from the 2003 and 2004 year-classes.  Improved angling opportunities for larger fish may exist in a few years, as younger individuals grow to a more favorable size.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch were captured at an average rate for the lake class.  Size was typically small with a mean length of 6.45 inches.  No individuals exceeding 8 inches were captured.  Yellow perch are an important prey species in McAvity Lake. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill were the most common fish in the trap net and were captured at an average rate when compared to similar lakes.  Previous surveys indicated relatively low bluegill abundance and the current survey resulted in the highest observation of the species in McAvity Lake.  Size structure was poor as growth was slow.   <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass were captured in good numbers during night electrofishing.  Size structure was good as the most individuals exceeded 12 inches.  Five year-classes were identified and growth was relatively slow.  The relatively good abundance and favorable size structure suggests good angling opportunities for this species in McAvity Lake. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye were captured in relatively low numbers.  Lakes with similar characteristics to McAvity do not typically produce large walleye catches and angling potential for this species tends to be very limited.   <br> \n <br> \nThe protection of water quality and habitat is critical in maintaining or improving fish and wildlife populations.  Unfortunately, human activities often negatively impact our lakes.  Fertilized turf-grass lawns and failing septic systems along with the removal of shoreline and aquatic vegetation, mowing to the shore, and installing sand blanket beaches result in destabilized shorelines, uncontrolled erosion, and increased run-off, contributing excess nutrients and sediment to the lake and degrading water quality and habitat.  By understanding the cumulative impacts of our actions and taking steps to avoid or minimize them, we can help insure our quality water resources can be enjoyed well into the future. Anglers can further help insure quality fishing by practicing selective harvest and catch and release.   <br> \n</p>",
