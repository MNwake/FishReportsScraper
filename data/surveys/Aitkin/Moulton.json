                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of nearshore fish species in Moulton Lake was conducted on June 23, 2021, by Aitkin Area Fisheries Staff. Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at all ten sampling stations. Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample three stations, a 15-foot seine was used at four stations, and site conditions prevented the use of seines at three stations. Nearshore sampling captured nine species of fish (i.e., Bluegill, Black Crappie, Central Mudminnow, Hybrid Sunfish, Largemouth Bass, Pumpkinseed, Tadpole Madtom, Yellow Bullhead and Yellow Perch). <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore data were combined with trap net and gill net data from a July 2021 survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based Index of Biotic Integrity (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment. In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g., Rock Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g., Black Bullhead). The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.  <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey indicates the fish community of Moulton Lake is in good health as indicated by an FIBI score above the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes. Data from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Pine River Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A special assessment targeting near shore fish species was conducted on June 30, 2016. The near shore fish survey data is combined with gill net and trap net data from a July 2016 survey to describe the fish community and provide a fish-based Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) score based on expectations for similar lakes. Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake (10 stations) and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible. Species information was gathered as part of a statewide project to evaluate the fish IBI for Minnesota lakes.  <br> \n <br> \nBackpack electrofishing was completed at all 10 stations, but two sites were sampled from the boat due to unstable footing. A 50-foot seine was used to sample 3 stations, a 15-foot seine was used at 4 stations, and site conditions prevented the use of either seines at 3 sites. Nearshore sampling captured several fish species of which none were intolerant. <br> \n <br> \nMoulton lake falls within lake class 35 based on the Schupp lake classification used by MnDNR and within Group 5 lakes for evaluating IBI data. IBI scores range from 0 to 100 and the draft impairment threshold for this group of lakes is 24 (CI 9-39). The IBI score, using standard gill net and trap net data from the 2016 standard assessment, calculated from this survey was 51 and is above the impairment threshold.  <br> \n <br> \nThis survey is contributing to a watershed assessment process in coordination with the MN Pollution Control Agency. Moulton Lake is located in the Pine River Watershed.   <br> \n</p>",

Growth rates were normal.  Yep (13 of 14 aged) ranged from three to eight years of age with a strong year class in 1986.  Growth rates for the first through the fourth annular increments were slower than normal.  Walleye (12 of 12 aged) ranged from two to eight years of age with strong year classes in 1986 and 1989 which correspond to the 1986 and 1989 walleye fingerling stocking.  The growth rate for the second annual increment was slower than normal.

                "narrative": "<p>Moulton Lake is surrounded by relatively infertile forests and bogs in a rather remote area. Cultural development is limited and access to the lake is somewhat difficult. Moulton Lake is therefore a relatively pristine place to fish and may be esthetically pleasing to those who enjoy remote surroundings. The lake is infertile and its waters are heavily bog-stained. Emergent plants grow on most of the shoreline, however submerged plants are relatively sparse. The most abundant plants are sedges, white waterlily, watershield and floatingleaf burreed. The shoalwater substrate is mostly muck, particularly in the bogs and bays. A mixture of sand, gravel and rubble is scattered throughout rest of the lake shoreline area.    Fish productivity is low in Moulton Lake. Several fishes were caught at low or below normal rates compared to other lakes of this type. These fishes included northern pike, bluegills, pumpkinseeds and yellow perch. Only two northerns were caught in this survey, and only 10 were caught in each of the previous two surveys. Black crappies, walleyes and yellow bullheads were, however, sampled at normal rates for this lake type.    Walleyes and crappies likely make up most of the fishery on the lake. Walleyes ranged up to 24.4 inches and average 15.1 inches. Various sizes of walleyes were sampled, mostly from stocked year classes. Walleye natural reproduction is limited; only one fish in the sample came from a non-stocked year class.     Black crappies ranged up to just 10.6 inches and averaged 8.7 inches. Recruitment, or production of new fish, is relatively consistent and includes strong year classes of fish which were 8 to 9 inches long in 1996. The average eight year old crappie is only 9.4 inches long. The fishery benefits from low harvest rates on the bigger fish.    Bluegills, though not abundant, averaged 6.5 inches in this survey. Growth, especially for young fish, is slow; the largest bluegill sampled was only 8.1 inches long. Harvest is restricted enough to allow larger sunfish to survive.    Past survey reports indicated largemouth bass fishing can be desirable, however no largemouth bass were caught in this survey. The methods used in this survey are not effective at sampling largemouth bass, yet the absence of any bass in the sample indicates the population may be low.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Special sampling was conducted in spring of 2011 to estimate walleye abundance.  Population estimates from a modified Peterson formula (M+1)*(C+1)/(R+1) were calculated using spring trap netting (lifted 4/19 - 4/23, 4/25 and 4/26) and one night of electrofishing (4/25) to mark fish and a second night of electrofishing (5/3) as a recapture method.  Fish were measured, sexed, and marked by removing the third dorsal spine (walleye) or lower caudal fin (northern pike).  Aging structures were also collected from a representative sample of walleye. <br> \n <br> \nAll walleye collected during spring trap netting and electrofishing received marks, with the intention of using short-term monofilament gill nets (GST) as a recapture technique.  However, only one walleye was sampled from 23 GST sets fished for 30-45 minutes, so no estimate could be produced.   <br> \n <br> \nTrap nets caught 105 walleye over seven lift days (0.95/net), with 91 individuals marked, 13 recaptured, and one mortality.  An additional 83 fish, including 6 recaptures, were collected during the first night of electrofishing.  Combining both gear types, a total of 168 marked walleye were present in the population prior to the recapture portion of the survey.  The second night of electrofishing resulted in a catch of 83 total fish including 9 recaptures.  The estimate of population size for all walleye over 9 inches was 890 fish (95% CI: 491-1779).   <br> \n <br> \nCombining all gear types, marked fish ranged from 5.9 to 28.7\", with an average size of 14.3\". Small fish (< 12\") made up a large portion of the electrofishing sample (113 of 166 fish).  The population estimate for walleye greater than 12\" was 398 (95% CI: 206-837).  Age analysis provided some explanation for the large number of small individuals.  Growth of fish was slower than observed in previous surveys and was below county averages.  Fish reached just 11.5\" at the fourth annulus, compared to 13.7\" to 14.5\" in the previous three surveys, and the county and statewide average of 15.1\".  Most fish used for growth analysis (93 of 100) came from fingerling-stocked year classes.  The increase in stocking density beginning in 2006 likely led to the decrease in juvenile growth rates. <br> \n <br> \nA mark-recapture estimate for northern pike was calculated using the first five days of trap netting (lifted 4/19 to 4/23) to mark fish and the sixth day of trap netting (set 4/23 and lifted 4/25) as a recapture method.  All fish were marked during spring trap netting with the intention of using short-term monofilament gill nets (GST) as a recapture technique, but catch rates were too low to produce an accurate estimate.   <br> \n <br> \nThe total catch from all trap nets combined was 107 pike (0.97/net).  A total of 70 fish were marked prior to the recapture efforts, which resulted in 4 recaptured fish of the 13 individuals collected.  The estimate of population size for northern pike was 199 fish (95% CI: 98-497).  Marked fish (87 fish total) ranged from 10.8 to 36.6\" (one 9\" fish was lost to net mortality), and averaged 23.5\", with 37% of the catch greater than 24\".  Additional information on northern pike growth can be found in the 8/01/2011 population assessment report for Moulton Lake. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie were captured at a rate of 3.8/lift in spring trap nets.  All fish combined ranged from 6.5 to 11.6\" and averaged 8.8\" with 6.7% greater than 10\".  Additional information on crappie growth can be found in the 8/01/2011 population assessment report for Moulton Lake. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Moulton Lake is a secluded lake located along the Aitkin-Crow Wing county line.  Most of the shoreline is in public ownership.  There is a state-owned public access located in the northwest corner of the lake, accessible off of Aitkin County Road 3.  The water is heavily bog stained with a Secchi disc reading of only 2.5 feet.  Anglers fishing Moulton Lake have several species to target, with walleye, black crappie and northern pike being the most popular, but opportunities to catch largemouth bass and bluegill are also present.  <br> \n <br> \nA survey was conducted in 2011 to assess the fish community.  Walleye gillnet catches were within the normal range for this type of lake.  Size ranged from 7 to 21 inches, but averaged just 11 inches.  Growth was slow compared to county and statewide averages, and historical rates for Moulton Lake.  While some limited natural reproduction may be taking place, most of the walleye are likely the result of fingerling stocking. <br> \n <br> \nHistorically, northern pike have been captured in low numbers in survey nets.  The 2011 assessment showed an increase in pike abundance, but the catch was still below average compared to similar lakes.  Fish ranged from 13.5 to 32.5 inches, with 33% greater than 24 inches.  Growth was good with fish reaching about 25 inches in five growing seasons. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie catches were similar to previous surveys, which have tended to be on the high end of the normal range for this type of lake.  Size averaged about 8 inches, with just a couple of fish over 10 inches observed in the sample.  Growth was slightly below statewide averages, but within the expected range for lakes in Aitkin County.  Bluegill numbers decreased since 2006, and are similar to what was observed in the 1990's, with many fish between 6 and 7.5 inches, but few over 8 inches. <br> \n <br> \nMoulton Lake is not known for its largemouth bass fishery, however anecdotal information from anglers and previous net catches indicated a possible increasing trend.  The 2011 survey suggests abundance appears to have dropped back to more normal levels for the lake.  Largemouth bass up to 17 inches long were observed.   <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Moulton Lake is a secluded lake located along the Aitkin-Crow Wing county line. Most of the shoreline is unaltered and in public ownership. There is a state-owned public access located in the northwest corner of the lake, accessible off of Aitkin County Road 3. The water is very soft and is heavily bog stained with a Secchi disc reading of only 3 feet. Anglers fishing Moulton Lake have several species to target, with Walleye, Black Crappie and Northern Pike being the most popular, but opportunities to catch Largemouth Bass and Bluegill are also present. <br> \n <br> \nA survey was conducted, in 2021, to assess the fish community. The Walleye gillnet catch rate of 1.2 per net was within the normal range for this type of lake, but below the management target goal of 2-4 per net. Sizes ranged from 8 to 21.5 inches and averaged 14.5 inches. Growth was slightly slower compared to county and statewide averages, but comparable to historical rates for Moulton Lake. While some limited natural reproduction may be taking place, most of the Walleye are likely the result of fingerling stocking. <br> \n <br> \nHistorically, Northern Pike have been captured in low numbers in survey nets. The 2011 assessment showed an increase in abundance, however the catch was lower in both the 2016 and 2021 surveys falling back to near median level for Moulton Lake. Fish in the gill nets ranged from 23 to 33 inches, with an average length of 26.75 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie catches have significantly increased in consecutive surveys and are now more abundant than the normal range for this type of lake. Size averaged about 8 inches, with just a couple fish over 10 inches observed in the trap net sample. Growth was slightly below statewide averages, but within the expected range for lakes in Aitkin County.  <br> \n <br> \nBluegill numbers were similar to the 2016 survey and average for this lake type. Size structure was good, with most fish between 6 and 8.5 inches. <br> \n <br> \nMoulton Lake is not known for its Largemouth Bass fishery, however anecdotal information from anglers and previous net catches indicated a possible increasing trend. The 2021 survey suggests abundance is increasing compared to the lower levels observed in 2011 and 2016. Electrofishing showed an increase in catch rates from 3/hr in 2016 to 17.5/hr in 2021. Largemouth Bass up to 19.7 inches long were observed. <br> \n <br> \nIn addition to the standard summer field work, nearshore sampling for the Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) was also conducted in 2021, and the results are available in the June 23, 2021 Targeted Assessment. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Moulton Lake is a secluded lake located along the Aitkin-Crow Wing county line.  Most of the shoreline is in public ownership.  The public access, which is located on the northwest corner of the lake, is state owned. The water is bog stained with a Secchi disc reading of only 4.5 feet. Anglers fishing Moulton Lake have several species to target.  Black crappie, largemouth bass and walleye were caught in abundant numbers for this lake type.  Black crappie averaged about 8 ? inches in length but several fish over 11 inches were sampled.  Growth rates appear to be good and there are some strong year classes coming up that should provide some good fishing in a few years.  Catch rates of largemouth bass were above average for both gill nets and trap nets.  Largemouth bass up to 15 inches long were observed.  Walleye gillnet catches were above average with five year classes represented in the sample.  Walleye ranged in size from 13 to 20 inches in length. While there is some evidence of natural reproduction taking place, most of the walleye were from stocked year classes. Other species of interest to anglers include northern pike and bluegill. Low numbers of northern pike contributes to the high survival rate of stocked walleye fingerlings.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Moulton Lake is a secluded lake located along the Aitkin-Crow Wing county line. Most of the shoreline is unaltered and in public ownership. There is a state-owned public access located in the northwest corner of the lake, accessible off of Aitkin County Road 3. The water is very soft and is heavily bog stained with a Secchi disc reading of only 2.5 feet. Anglers fishing Moulton Lake have several species to target, with walleye, black crappie and northern pike being the most popular, but opportunities to catch largemouth bass and bluegill are also present. <br> \nA survey was conducted in 2016 to assess the fish community. Walleye gillnet catches were within the normal range for this type of lake. Size ranged from 9.5 to 21 inches, and averaged 14.5 inches. Growth was normal compared to county and statewide averages, and historical rates for Moulton Lake. While some limited natural reproduction may be taking place, most of the walleye are likely the result of fingerling stocking. <br> \nHistorically, northern pike have been captured in low numbers in survey nets. The 2011 assessment showed an increase in pike abundance, but the catch was still below average compared to similar lakes.  The 2016 survey has shown a decrease in catch rates to a number similar to past years. Fish in the gill nets ranged from 21 to 26.5 inches, with an average length of 24 inches.  <br> \nBlack crappie catches have significantly increased from previous surveys, which had tended to be on the high end of the normal range for this type of lake. Size averaged about 8 inches, with just a couple of fish over 10 inches observed in the trap net sample. Growth was slightly below statewide averages, but within the expected range for lakes in Aitkin County.  <br> \nBluegill numbers were similar to the 2011 survey and average for this lake type.  Size structure was good, with most fish between 6 and 8.5 inches. <br> \nMoulton Lake is not known for its largemouth bass fishery, however anecdotal information from anglers and previous net catches indicated a possible increasing trend. The 2016 survey suggests abundance appears to have remained at the lower levels observed in 2011. Electrofishing confirmed a low density population with only about 3 per hour captured.  Largemouth bass up to 17 inches long were observed. <br> \nIn addition to the standard summer field work, IBI (Index of Biotic Integrity) sampling was also conducted in 2016, and the results are available in the June 30, 2016 Targeted Assessment.  <br> \n</p>",
