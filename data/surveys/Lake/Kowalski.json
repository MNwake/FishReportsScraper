This 12.8-acre lake has a maximum depth of 32 feet and littoral area of 8.7 acres.  Access to the lake is via a 0.7 mile unmarked walk-in trail from Lake County Road. #7.  There has been no maintenance on this trail for many years and it is difficult to follow. The initial lake survey (1987) sampled northern pike, pumpkinseed sunfish and yellow perch, the same species sampled in the 2007 re-survey. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike numbers were higher in the 1987 initial lake survey than the re-survey in 2007 although the mean weight was larger in 2007 (2.0 lbs) than in 1987 (1.4 lbs). Growth for northern pike sampled in 2007 was average for the Finland area.  The mean length of age-4 northern pike was 20.7  inches.  Reproduction was sufficient to maintain a self-sustaining northern pike population. <br> \n <br> \nThe 2007 yellow perch catch was down from 1987 and generally small, less than 8 inches, in both surveys.  The average size of yellow perch in Kowalski Lake would not interest most anglers.  Pumpkinseed sunfish, ranging in size from 3.5 to 4.5 inches, were sampled in both surveys in low numbers.  Four minnow traps sampled one pumpkinseed sunfish. <br> \n</p>",
