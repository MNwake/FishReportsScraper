                "narrative": "<p>Green Wing Lake has an area of 34 acres with a maximum depth of two feet.  The water brown from bog-stain and clarity was below average.  The shoreline around the lake is covered by wetland marsh with a mix of deciduous and coniferous trees away from the shore.  The entire shore is under public ownership with majority being under federal ownership.  One inlet, Greenwing Creek, enters the lake on the southeast shore and exits the lake on the western shore just before converging with Folly Creek.  Thirty-one types of aquatic and riparian plant were noted during the survey.  The lake bottom consists of muck, detritus, and silt.  Northern Pike and Yellow Perch compose the game fish community in the lake. <br> \n <br> \nGreen Wing Lake is located 10 miles north of Isabella, MN off of USFS Rd 369 (Trappers Lake Rd).  A canoe can be put in Folly Creek just upstream of the culvert at the road crossing.  The lake can then be accessed by paddling 0.41 miles up Folly Creek and Greenwing Creek.  In periods of low water, carrying over rapids may be required and there is a possibility of having to carry over a beaver dam.  Fishing pressure on the lake is presumed to be light.   <br> \n <br> \nThe 2016 survey found the catch rate of Northern Pike to be above average compared to similar lakes in northeastern Minnesota.  The average length for Northern Pike was 17.5 inches with an average weight of 1.4 pounds.  The largest Northern Pike measured 27.0 inches long and weighed 4.4 pounds.  Five year classes were represented in the 2016 survey.  Growth of Northern Pike was average when compared to other lakes in the Finland area. <br> \n <br> \nThe Yellow Perch catch in 2016 was above average relative to similar lakes in the area.  The average length was 7.7 inches with an average weight was 0.3 pounds.  The largest Yellow Perch measured was 11.1 inches long and had a weight of 0.6 pounds.  Six year classes were represented in the sample.  Growth of Yellow Perch was fast for the Finland area.  White Sucker and Northern Pearl Dace were also sampled in Green Wing Lake during the 2016 survey.  <br> \n</p>",
