Seven year-classes were present and age ranged from 1-7 years.  Half of the fish captured were age-3 or younger.  Length for all northern pike ranged from 11.1-28.0 inches and the mean was 17.9.  Growth was well below the area mean.  The mean weight was 1.37 pounds, which was essentially the same as what is found in 25% of class 19 lakes.   <br> \n  <br> \nYellow perch gill-net abundance was 34.25 fish/set, which was well above average compared to other class 19 lakes.  Nine year-classes were present and age ranged from 2-11 years.  Total length in gill nets ranged from 5.3-11.9 inches and the mean was 7.9.
