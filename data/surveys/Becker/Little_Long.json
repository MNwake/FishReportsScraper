                "narrative": "<p>The water of Little Long Lake is hard (total alkalinity) and covers an area of 10.6 acres.  Approximately 52 percent (5.5 acres) of the area is less than 15 feet deep.  A maximum depth of 28 feet is attained and the median depth is 14 feet.  A Secchi disc lowered into the lake could not be seen in water deeper than 11.5 feet.  Various submerged aquatic plants are present but are judged to be of scattered to sparse density.  Muskgrass was the most abundant and its density was estimated to be moderate.  Emergent plant life on the floating sedge mat or bog which surrounds the lake is quite good although little of the present lake water surface area is covered by standing emergent vegetation.  Soils of the lake bed in the more shallow water are estimated to be entirely a mixture of hard sand and gravel.  There are no inlets to the lake, nor is there an outlet.  Shoreline marsh areas exist on the east and west ends of the lake.Prior to the lake reclamation project crappies, bass, and northern pike are said to have received most of the fishing pressure.  Sunfish were quite small and were not utilized.  Overall, it is reported that the lake received little fishing pressure.  There are no resorts, cottages, or homes at the lake.  Only 1 boat was observed during the survey.  There is an access to the lake on the southwest shore, and it is owned by Becker County.Fish StockingThe only stocking on record occurred in 1962 when 500 rainbow trout (yearlings) were released after a lake reclamation project.Fish RemovalThere is no fish removal on record.  However, in September of 1962, the lake was reclaimed through use of a fish toxicant (rotenone) on the existing fish population.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Little Long Lake is an 11-acre lake located eight miles east of the town of Wolf Lake in Becker County. It has a maximum depth of 28 feet. There is a county owned access on the southwest shore. This lake was formerly managed for trout (rainbow and brown) and was reclaimed with rotenone in 1962 and 1971 to eliminate species such as northern pike, largemouth bass, and sunfish. However, these species reappeared in the lake, causing problems with trout survival. Management for trout was discontinued in 1989. Since then the lake has developed a warmwater fish community. The lake's small size and relatively deep basin limit the numbers of fish the lake can support. As a result there is intense competition for food among individuals, and species such as bass and panfish tend to be small and slow-growing. Fish species present in Little Long Lake in the 2000 assessment included black crappie, bluegill, largemouth bass, northern pike, pumpkinseed sunfish, walleye, white sucker, yellow bullhead, and yellow perch. Only one northern pike was seen in test nets, with a length of 29 inches. There was one walleye sampled with a length of 13.4 inches. Bluegill numbers were above the normal range for this lake class, but sizes were small, with a maximum length of 6.5 inches. Good numbers of largemouth bass were seen in trap nets, but none exceeded 10 inches. Three black crappie were sampled in trap nets; all were around 8 inches in length. Black crappie, bluegill, and yellow bullhead were sampled for the first time since the lake reclamation in 1962.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Little Long is an 11-acre lake located eight miles east of the town of Wolf Lake in eastern Becker County.  Little Long has a maximum depth of 28 feet.  There is a county owned public access located on the southwest shore.  Long Lake was formerly managed for trout (rainbow and brown) and was reclaimed with rotenone in 1962 and 1971 to eliminate species such as northern pike, largemouth bass, and sunfish.  However, these species reappeared in the lake, causing problems with trout survival.  Management for trout was discontinued in 1989.  Since then the lake has developed into a warmwater fish community.  The lake's small size and low productivity limits the number and sizes of fish the lake can support.  Species such as panfish and largemouth bass tend to be small in size and slow-growing. <br> \n  <br> \nFish species present in Little Long in the 2010 assessment included northern pike, black crappie, largemouth bass, yellow perch, white sucker, yellow bullhead, and green sunfish.  One 22.6 inch northern pike was sampled in the trapnets.  Past surveys have sampled low numbers of northern pike with an occasional larger pike sampled.  Black crappie and yellow perch abundance was very high compared to past surveys.  Black crappie up to 10.9 inches were sampled, however, very few crappie were over 8.0 inches in length.  Black crappie growth was very slow when compared to other area lakes.  Yellow perch had an average length of 7.6 inches with fish measured up to 10.6 inches.  One largemouth bass was sampled (14.2 inches).  Past surveys have shown good numbers of bass, but very few fish over 12.0 inches in length have been sampled.  <br> \n</p>",
