The lake has a maximum depth of 43 feet and a littoral area of 29 acres.  The water is relatively clear.  A Secchi disk reading of 10.5 feet was recorded in this assessment.  No public access is available on the lake other than the channel from North Star Lake.  A public access is located on North Star Lake.     The northern pike gill net catch was 4.7/gill net in this assessment, below the lake class median.  Six year classes were represented in the catch.  The northern pike sampled varied from 15.6 inches to 30.5 inches. They had a mean length of 22.6 inches.  Growth exceeded the statewide averages (>115%).     Yellow perch exceeded the lake class 3rd quartile at 23.7/gill net.  Most of the perch were small, ranging in length from 5.3 to 8.7 inches with a mean length of 6.1 inches.       The bluegill trap net catch of 12.4/set was just below the lake class median.  Most of the bluegill sampled were small.  The bluegill ranged in length from 3.4 to 7.5 inches and had a mean length of 5.4 inches.  Similar size range was observed in the gill nets.       Only two black crappie were captured in this assessment.  One was captured in the gill net (0.3/set) and one in the trap nets (0.1/set).        Two muskellunge were also captured in this assessment.  They were 28.0 and 42.3 inches in length.     Other species sampled in this assessment were: golden shiner, rock bass, bowfin, pumpkinseed, green and hybrid sunfish.         </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Little North Star Lake is a class 33 lake located near Marcell, MN.  The lake has no inlets and one unnamed outlet to North Star Lake.  There is no public access except throughout the outlet from North Star Lake.  The initial lake management plan established in 2006 indicates Northern Pike as the primary species of management with Black Crappie, Bluegill, and Largemouth Bass as a secondary species. <br> \n <br> \nThe Black Crappie catch of 0.9 fish/trap net was above the lake class 1st quartile value of 0.7/net.  The sampled fish ranged from 5.8 to 11.4 inches and had a mean length of 8.6 inches.  Four age-classes from 2 to 7 years old were identified from scales.  Growth was similar to other class 33 lakes with fish averaging 8.8 inches after four years of growth. <br> \n <br> \nTrap-net catch rates for Bluegill were 9.8 fish/net.  Bluegill lengths ranged from 2.7 to 7.4 inches and had a mean length of 4.0 inches.  Six age-classes were identified from scales ranging from age 3 to age 10.  Growth rates were slower than other class 33 lakes as reflected by fish averaging 5.1 inches after six years of growth.  Due to the poor growth and size structure of the Bluegill, anglers would likely have limited interest. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass were sampled by spring night electrofishing for the first time in 2014.  The catch rate was 42.4/hr on-time.  Largemouth Bass ranged from 5.7 to 17.0 inches with a mean length of 9.9 inches.  Seven age-classes were identified from scales ranging from age 2 to age 10.  Growth was similar to the statewide averages for all ages. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike gill-net catch rates have ranged from 0.7 to 8.6 fish/net since 1971.  The 2014 catch was the lowest on record and was below the lake class 1st quartile value for the first time.  Only two fish were sampled and they were 25.5 and 26.2 inches.  The fish were four and five years old based on cliethra and scale analysis. <br> \n <br> \nOther species observed during the population assessment included Golden Shiner, Pumpkinseed Sunfish, Rock Bass, and Yellow Perch. <br> \n <br> \nIn order to maintain or improve fish and wildlife populations, water quality and habitat must be protected.  People often associate water quality problems with large-scale agricultural, forestry, urban development or industrial practices in the watershed.  In reality, the impact of land use decisions on one lake lot may be relatively small, yet the cumulative impact of those decisions on many lake lots can result in a significant decline in water quality and habitat.  For example, removing shoreline and aquatic vegetation, fertilizing lawns, mowing to the water's edge, installing beach sand blankets, failing septic systems and uncontrolled run-off, all contribute excess nutrients and sediment which degrade water quality and habitat.  Understanding these cumulative impacts and taking steps to avoid or minimize them will help to insure our quality fisheries can be enjoyed by future generations.</p>",
