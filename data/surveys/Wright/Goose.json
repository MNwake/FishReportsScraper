                "narrative": "<p>Goose Lake is a 42 acre lake located southwest of the city of Buffalo in Wright County. The maximum depth is 14 feet and water clarity in 2013 was poor. The lake has a small watershed of mostly pasture and cropland. Goose Lake outlets to Deer Lake, which has a public access. The lake was last surveyed in 1988. Aquatic vegetation was limited and shallow due to low water clarity. Sago pondweed was the most common species found. Curly leaf pondweed and Eurasian watermilfoil are invasive species which were present but rare. Goose Lake has a history of partial winterkills, but the last recorded event was in 1989. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike gill net catches were in the expected range for lakes similar to Goose in both 2013 and 1988. Northern Pike lengths in 2013 ranged from 18.9 to 29.6 inches with an average length and weight of 23.8 inches and 2.7 pounds. Twenty five percent of Northern Pike caught were longer than 24 inches and growth was fast, reaching 23 inches at age three. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass were sampled by daytime boat electrofishing and the catch rate was below average for the Montrose area. Largemouth Bass lengths ranged from 8.1 to 16.5 inches with an average length and weight of 11.9 inches and 1.1 pounds. Eighteen percent of Largemouth Bass sampled were longer than 15 inches. Only two large Walleye were caught in the survey and past survey catches have also been low. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie net catches were within the expected range for lakes similar to Goose Lake and were similar to the last survey. Black Crappie lengths ranged from 4.3 to 9.8 inches with an average length and weight of 7.3 inches and 0.24 pounds. Growth was average and Black Crappie reached 7.5 inches in three years. Bluegill catches were low in 2013 and 1988. Bluegill lengths ranged from 3.6 to 7.8 inches with an average length and weight of 6.4 inches and 0.23 pounds.  <br> \n <br> \nVery few Yellow Perch have been caught in the past two surveys. Other species caught in 2013 include: Black Bullhead, Bowfin, Channel Catfish, Common Carp, Golden Shiner, Shorthead Redhorse, White Sucker, and Yellow Bullhead. Black Bullhead were the most numerous fish caught, but were much more abundant in previous surveys. As in Deer Lake, the arrival of Channel Catfish from the Crow River may be reducing the abundance of bullheads. <br> \n</p>",

Black Crappie, Black and Yellow Bullhead, Bluegill, and Yellow Perch were the most important species caught in the trap nets. Black Crappie were caught at a rate of 39.0/lift, which is almost eight times the local average. Fish ranged in size from 5-7.2 inches in length with the average length group of 6.0-6.4 inches. Growth was good for Black Crappies. Bluegill were not abundant with a catch rate of 2.8/trap net. This is about 1/10 of the local average. Black Bullhead were plentiful with the average length group of 5.5-5.9 inches. Only three Largemouth Bass were caught. Only one Common Carp was caught, even though they are known to be abundant in the lake.</p>",
