                "narrative": "<p>With a maximum depth of 39', moderate chemical fertility, average water clarity, and about half of the lake area less than 15' in depth, Frying Pan Lake is typical of the 49 northeast Minnesota lakes in Ecological Lake Class 11.  Frying Pan Lake differs from these lakes, however, in that it is smaller (69 acres) than the lake class average size of 161 acres. Sand is the dominate bottom type in shallow areas of the lake, with muck areas concentrated in bays in the southwest end of the lake.  Aquatic plants are found around the entire shoreline at depths of 5' or less.  Although numerous aquatic plant types were identified in 1995, the most common were water moss, filamentous algae, various pondweeds, horsetail, and yellow waterlilies.The total catch of fish in the trapnets and gillnets in 1995 (all species combined) was below average for this lake class, but similar to previous catches on this lake except that crappie numbers have declined.  Lake Class 11 is one of the less productive lake classes in terms of fish production, but it is not known why Frying Pan Lake appears to have lower fish populations than average for this lake class.Fish populations in 1995 were dominated by northern pike, white sucker, black crappie, bluegill sunfish, yellow perch, and bullhead.  Northern pike numbers in 1995 were lower than average for this lake class, but were similar to previous catches in this lake.  Pike averaged 1.0 lb each, which is smaller than average for this lake class.  The largest pike captured in 1995 was 25\" (3 lb); the largest pike ever caught by DNR crews in this lake was 38\".  Pike aged one through five were caught in 1995.  Pike growth, 21\" at age four, was average for the area.  Most pike were infested with Neascus.  Neascus, also known as \"black spot\" is a small parasite in or under the skin of fish; it cannot infect people, and is killed by cooking.Black crappie numbers in 1995 were average for this lake class, but were lower than in previous surveys.  The reason for this decline is not known.  The average crappie size, 8\", was unexceptional.  The largest crappie caught in this survey was 10.6\", similar to previous assessments.  Crappie growth, 7\" at age four, was average.  Most crappie were from the 1989 and 1993 year classes.Bluegill sunfish numbers in 1995 were below average for this lake class, but were similar to previous catches in this lake.  Bluegill sizes averaged 6\", with nine percent over 8\".  The largest bluegill ever caught was 9.2\".  Bluegill growth, 5\" at age four, was average for the area.  Yellow perch numbers in 1995 were average for this lake class; catches in previous surveys have been quite variable.  The average perch size was 6\"; the largest ever caught was 10\".  Perch growth, 5\" at age four, was slow.  About 45 percent of perch had Neascus and/or Clinostomum (also known as yellow grub).  Neither of these parasites can infect people and both are killed by cooking.  </p>",

Dissolved oxygen levels were diminished below the 16 foot level at the time of the assessment. Water clarity is poor wth brown bog stained water.\n\nThere is a gravel boat ramp present for public access. The parking area is small and is limited to a maximum of 3 vehicles with trailers. \n\nFish sampling during the 2014 population assessment consisted of 4 gill nets and 9 trap nets. Nine species of fish were sampled with northern pike, black crappie and bluegill most common. Other species sampled in low numbers included pumpkinseed, hybrid sunfish, yellow perch, white sucker, golden shiner and brown bullhead.\n\nNorthern pike numbers in 2014 (2.5/gill net) were similar to the long term average for all assessments on this lake. Pike sizes averaged 23.2 inches long which is larger than the  average of 18.6 inches for past assessments. The largest pike sampled was 35.3 inches long from a trap net.\n\nBlack crappie numbers in 2014 (5.2/trap net) were lower than average compared to past assessments on this lake. Crappie sizes averaged 7.2 inches long which is similar to past assessments. The largest crappie sampled was 11.3 inches long.\n\nBluegill numbers in 2014 (3.9/trap net) were slightly lower than in past assessments. The average bluegill sampled was 6.3 inches long and about five or six years old. The largest bluegill sampled was 7.8 inches long.</p>",
