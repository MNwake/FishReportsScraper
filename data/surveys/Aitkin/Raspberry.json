A judgement of the population based on this netting would be northern pike, black and yellow bullhead, pumpkinseed, and probably yellow perch (taken only in trap nets) exhibit average size populations for lakes in this region; bowfin numbers are high and bluegills low. Bluegill and pumpkinseed captured were large.</p>",
