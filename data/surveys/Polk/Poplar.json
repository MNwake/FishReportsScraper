                "narrative": "<p>Poplar Lake experiences low dissolved oxygen levels during severe winters and has suffered winterkills of varying degree on a number of occasions.  The most recent significant winterkill occurred in 1993.  Poplar Lake has a fishery that is dominated by low oxygen tolerant fish species including black bullhead, northern pike, and yellow perch, which survive better in lakes like this one than walleyes, bluegills, and largemouth bass.  After a winterkill, fish can re-enter the lake via the Poplar River.  The current lake management plan calls for restocking the lake with walleye and black crappie in the event of a winterkill.Walleyes were few in number during the 2005 survey, but an occasional large fish may be caught.  Biennial fry stocking offers additional fishing opportunities that would not otherwise exist in this lake.  Northern pike sampled during the survey were typically young and small but growth rates were good.  Like walleyes, bluegills were rare but relatively large.  Black crappies were also good-sized and catch rates were up slightly from previous surveys but they are not abundant.  Bullhead numbers were the lowest in netting history since 1978 but black bullheads were still relatively abundant compared to similar lakes.Public access is of concern due to the lack of parking, but the fishery in this small lake may not be able to tolerate heavier fishing pressure.  The steep, gravel approach off the township road on the east end of the lake can also be difficult to maneuver and launch a boat without four-wheel drive.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Poplar Lake experiences low oxygen levels during severe winters and has suffered winterkills of varying degree on a number of occasions.  The most recent significant winterkill occurred in 1993.  Most of the winterkill sensitive species such as bluegill and walleye succumbed to that event.  Walleye fry were stocked in the spring of 1993 following the winterkill.  Adult bluegill and largemouth bass were stocked in the spring of 1995 to serve as broodstock for reestablishing these species.  Immigration via the Poplar River also provides an avenue for some species to repopulate the lake.The current survey finds a fish community dominated by the more winterkill resistant species; black bullhead, northern pike, and yellow perch.  The bulk of the northern pike are two and three years old, none were found over five years old.  Their mean length is 18.6 inches.  No walleyes or largemouth bass were taken in the current survey's test nets.  A small number of bluegills and black crappies were sampled.  The bluegills are likely the broodstock fish stocked in 1995.  Crappies are more winterkill resistant than most other sunfishes and some have apparently survived.    If winterkill does not occur for a number of successive years,  Poplar Lake has the potential to produce an excellent angling opportunity in an area of the state that does not have a wealth of good fishing lakes.</p>",
