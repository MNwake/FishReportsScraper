                "narrative": "<p>Pearl Lake is primarily noted for its northern pike, bass, and panfish angling with occasional catches of walleye as well.  Of these, only walleye are stocked in Pearl Lake since suitable spawning habitat is lacking for this species.  Walleyes otherwise do well in this lake showing good growth and providing a moderate fishery with fast growing fish.  The average weight of walleyes sampled in 2004 was 2.2 pounds.Northern pike were also larger in 2004 than in past studies.  The average pike weight was 3.1 pounds.  Northern pike also grow relatively fast in Pearl Lake.This lake has a history of also producing large (over eight inches) bluegills.  The 2004 survey was the first in which no bluegills over eight inches were sampled in test nets.  It appears that bluegills are being harvested by anglers as soon as they reach acceptable sizes.  Very vew apparently survive to grow past 7.5 inches.  If there was angler support, special harvest regulations might help provide large bluegills in Pearl Lake, once again.Largemouth bass and black crappie are also popular angling targets in this lake.  Both are found in good numbers and average sizes.Bullhead catches have declined greatly since the 1970's and 1980's.  Lake association netting of young-of-the-year bullheads, commercial bullhead fishing, and the strong predator populations probably each played a role in the recent bullhead decreases.  Decreased numbers have also resulted in large sizes of bullheads in Pearl Lake.  Average lengths for both black and brown bullhead were over 12 inches in 2004.Pearl Lake is a small (237 acre), productive lake with water quality subject to development related pressures.  Watershed landowners are encouraged to practice good land stewardship to slow the decline of water quality, fish habitat, and property values in Pearl Lake.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Pearl Lake is primarily noted for its Northern Pike, bass, and panfish angling with occasional catches of Walleye, as well.  Of these, only Walleye are stocked in Pearl Lake since suitable spawning habitat is lacking for this species.  Walleye stocking has been somewhat successful in this lake, with fish showing good growth and providing a modest fishery with fast-growing fish.  The average weight of Walleyes sampled in 2014 was 2.3 pounds. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike were slightly smaller than the average reported from past studies.  The average pike weight was 1.7 pounds.  Northern Pike also grow relatively fast in Pearl Lake. <br> \n <br> \nThis lake has a history of also producing large (over eight inches) Bluegills.  The 2004 survey was the first in which no Bluegills over eight inches were sampled in test nets and very few of that size were found in 2009.  However, approximately 10% of Bluegills sampled in 2014 were 8.0 inches or longer.  It appears that more Bluegills have survived angler harvest during the past five or six years to grow to larger sizes.  However, the portions of Bluegills over eight inches were much larger during the 1960's and 1970's. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass and Black Crappie are also popular angling targets in this lake.  Both are found in average numbers and sizes.  A strong age group of four-year-old crappies should provide good angling in the near future. <br> \n <br> \nBullhead catches have declined greatly since the 1970's and 1980's.  Lake association netting of young-of-the-year bullheads, commercial bullhead fishing, and the strong predator populations probably each played a role in the recent bullhead decreases.  Decreased numbers have also resulted in large sizes of bullheads in Pearl Lake.  Average lengths for both Black and Brown Bullhead were over 12 inches in 2014. <br> \n <br> \nPearl Lake is a small (280-acre), productive lake with water quality subject to development-related pressures.  Watershed landowners are encouraged to practice good land stewardship to slow the decline of water quality, fish habitat, and property values in Pearl Lake.  In addition, anglers can help provide higher quality fish by releasing larger ones and harvesting smaller ones, especially Northern Pike.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Pearl Lake has historically been a good northern pike and panfish lake, although northerns are generally small. Occasionally, walleye fishing has been good and, more recently, largemouth bass have seemed to thrive.  Thelargemouth bass population is apparently the product of fingerling stocking in 1980.  Standard lake survey testnets do not capture largemouth bass effectively and special spring sampling needs to be conducted to thoroughlyevaluate this species.  Historical netting data shows that northern pike have experienced large fluctuations inabundance over time, from modest levels to very high levels and back again.  They are currently at a low ebb,although still within the normal range for this lake class.  Bluegill have always been abundant with a good sizestructure (numerous 7 - 8 inch fish).  Current test net data shows a significant increase in abundance from theprevious survey in 1988.  Their numbers now appear to be abnormally high for this lake class.  Size structure hassuffered somewhat with the increased abundance.  A combination of slower growth and increased fishing pressure\"cropping off\" the larger fish is likely responsible for the decline in size. Growth rate is presently belowaverage.   Although seven inch fish are still plentiful, the eight inchers are getting harder to find.  Yellowperch have been able to maintain a moderate and relatively stable population despite large shifts in the abundanceof predators like northern pike that utilize yellow perch for a food source.  Current test net data indicates asignificant decline in the walleye population since the previous survey in 1988, although still within the normalrange for this lake class.  The 1988 population consisted largely of a strong 1984 year class of walleye.  Thatyear class coincides with the stocking of large walleye fingerlings.  Subsequent walleye fingerling stockings havemet with only marginal success, thus leading to the decline in abundance.  Walleye natural reproduction is alsomarginal and fails to sustain the population.  Attempts will be made to bolster the walleye population by stockinglarge fingerlings again.  If this shows repeated failures then walleye stocking may need to be discontinued infavor of bass-panfish management.  Walleye, however marginally, have shown the ability to reproduce naturally inthis lake.  We need to protect the water quality and aquatic habitats present by advising and encouraginglandowners to use shoreland best management practices, for the benefit of all species.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Pearl Lake is primarily noted for its northern pike, bass, and panfish angling with occasional catches of walleye as well.  Of these, only walleye are stocked in Pearl Lake since suitable spawning habitat is lacking for this species.  Walleyes otherwise do well in this lake showing good growth and providing a moderate fishery with fast-growing fish.  The average weight of walleyes sampled in 2009 was 1.8 pounds. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike were also larger in 2009 than the average reported from past studies.  The average pike weight was 2.3 pounds.  Northern pike also grow relatively fast in Pearl Lake. <br> \n <br> \nThis lake has a history of also producing large (over eight inches) bluegills.  The 2004 survey was the first in which no bluegills over eight inches were sampled in test nets and very few of that size were found in 2009.  It appears that bluegills are being harvested by anglers as soon as they reach acceptable sizes.  Very vew apparently survive to grow past 7.5 inches.  If there was angler support, special harvest regulations might help provide large bluegills in Pearl Lake, once again. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass and black crappie are also popular angling targets in this lake.  Both are found in average numbers and sizes. <br> \n <br> \nBullhead catches have declined greatly since the 1970's and 1980's.  Lake association netting of young-of-the-year bullheads, commercial bullhead fishing, and the strong predator populations probably each played a role in the recent bullhead decreases.  Decreased numbers have also resulted in large sizes of bullheads in Pearl Lake.  Average lengths for both black and brown bullhead were near or over 12 inches in 2009. <br> \n <br> \nPearl Lake is a small (237-acre), productive lake with water quality subject to development-related pressures.  Watershed landowners are encouraged to practice good land stewardship to slow the decline of water quality, fish habitat, and property values in Pearl Lake.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Pearl Lake is primarily noted for its northern pike, bass, and panfish angling with occasional catches of walleyes as well.  Of these, only walleye are stocked in Pearl Lake since suitable spawning habitat is lacking for this species.In 1998, populations of all the top predator fish (northern pike, walleye, and largemouth bass) were above the normal range compared to other similar lakes.  Average sizes of pike and walleye were acceptable to most anglers at 2.1 and 1.5 pounds, respectively.Yellow perch (preferred forage for the predators) numbers were lower than at any time previously recorded.  This is likely a result of heavy recent walleye stocking and high numbers of northern pike and largemouth bass.  Fortunately, growth rates of the predators did not seem to have been affected.  Bluegills and black crappie were also relatively abundant, but small and young.  Growth rates appeared near normal so it is likely that these species are being heavily \"cropped off\" as soon as they reach \"keeper\" size.Bullhead numbers have definitely decreased from levels during the 1970s and 1980s.  Lake association netting of young-of-the-year bullheads, commercial bullhead fishing, and the strong predator populations probably each played a role in the recent bullhead decreases.  Decreased numbers have also resulted in large size of the bullheads remaining in Pearl Lake.Pearl Lake, like many other Minnesota lakes, has been subjected to drastically increasing shoreline development in recent years.  Although the lake is considered productive, its small size still makes it vulnerable to overfishing and water quality degradation.Lakeshore owners, watershed dwellers, and anglers can help to maintain Pearl Lake's fish community, water quality, and property values in several ways.  Implementing best management practices by (1) planting buffer strips of native vegetation along shorelines, (2) exceeding setback distances for buildings and septic systems, (3) protecting stands of aquatic vegetation (especially bulrushes and cattails), (4) making the smallest impact possible while obtaining access to open water, (5) returning a portion of medium-sized fish when fishing is \"hot\", and (6) seeking advice when doing work in the shoreline impact zone can help maintain the quality of the lake, its fishery, and lives of its human users.</p>",

A standard survey was completed in August 2019 to evaluate the status of the fish population in Pearl Lake.  <br> \n <br> \nIn the 2019 survey, Northern Pike catch rates were 12.2 per net, similar to the lake's historical average.  Pike sampled ranged from 10.8 to 38.6 inches, with a mean length of 21.2 inches.  The general size structure of the population has improved since 2009, as 26% of all pike sampled were longer than 24 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nBluegill abundance was within the normal range for Pearl Lake, yet slightly below the lake's historical average.  Bluegills up to 8.0 inches were sampled, yet the average length was 5.6 inches.  Largemouth Bass and Black Crappie were common during sampling.  Bass up to 20 inches long and crappie up to 12 inches long were captured. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch were not abundant, with only 11 fish total sampled.  The average length of Yellow Perch sampled was only 6 inches.  Walleyes are stocked in Pearl Lake, yet the population is not abundant.  Walleyes Sampled ranged from 15.4 inches to 20.4 inches, and the abundance was near a historic low. <br> \n   <br> \nPearl Lake is a small, productive lake with water quality impacted by development-related pressures.  Watershed landowners are encouraged to practice good land stewardship to slow the decline of water quality, fish habitat, and property values in Pearl Lake.  In addition, anglers can help provide higher quality fish by practicing selective harvest, especially for Northern Pike and sunfish.</p>",
