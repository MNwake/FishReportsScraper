There had been some natural reproduction, but it did not appear that any strong year classes had been produced recently.The walleye catch was within the normal range for lakes of this class, but it was the highest yet observed in this lake.  The population was sustained entirely through natural reproduction, with strong year classes produced in 1994 and 1995.  Walleye growth had been fast by area standards, probably due to an excellent northern cisco forage base.Smallmouth bass were present, although probably not in high numbers.  Smallmouth bass were first collected by the DNR in this lake in 1993.</p>",

Based on the profile, the top of the thermocline (i.e., the location in the water column with the sharpest transition from warm to cold water) occurred at approximately 20 feet. The dissolved oxygen did not reach 3.0 mg/L or less throughout the profile, and therefore there was sufficient oxygen from the surface to the bottom of the lake at the time of sampling. Since no TDO3 value can be calculated, the lowest dissolved oxygen level recorded was 3.7 ppm at 4.9?C (40.8?F) which was found at the deepest depth of the profile (167.3 feet). <br> \n <br> \nTDO3 values cooler than 8.8?C for Lake Trout, 17.2?C for Lake Whitefish, or 21.5?C for Cisco indicate that oxythermal conditions are favorable for these species. Dissolved oxygen concentrations below the thermocline indicate that suitable oxythermal habitat for Lake Trout was available across a range of depths at the time of sampling. When adequate oxythermal habitat is available, Lake Trout, Lake Whitefish, or Cisco are not squeezed into unfavorable, warmer water conditions and therefore do not experience higher levels of stress.</p>",
