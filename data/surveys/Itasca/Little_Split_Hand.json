                "narrative": "<p>Little Splithand Lake is best suited for bass, panfish and northern pike, and has also been stocked regularily with walleye.  Walleye were sampled at a rate within the expected range for this type of lake.  The four that were sampled ranged from 20.5 to 25.5 inches in length.     Only one largemouth bass was sampled in both the gill and trap nets combined.  Additionally, only one was sampled while electrofishing.  However, bass are difficult to catch in nets and the number caught electrofishing varies greatly with the time of year sampled, so it is difficult to say just how abundant bass are in this lake.      Northern pike have historically been fairly abundant in Little Splithand Lake and they remain so.  They were sampled in gill nets at a rate within the expected range.  Gill net sampled pike ranged from 14.3 to 35.6 inches in length.  They had a mean length of 20.3 inches and a mean weight of 2.1 pounds.     Black crappie catch rates with both types of nets are fairly low compared to historical rates, yet both are within the expected ranges.  Mean length of crappie sampled in gill nets was 10.0 inches and in trap nets was 6.8 inches.     Bluegill have always been sampled at low rates and they were sampled in trap nets at a rate well below the expected rate in this assessment as well.  They ranged from 4.1 to 8.9 inches in length and had a mean length of 7.5 inches.     Yellow perch were sampled in gill nets at a rate above the expected range.  They ranged from 5.0 to 9.6 inches in length.       Other species sampled include: bowfin (dogfish), white sucker, shorthead redhorse, yellow and brown bullhead, pumpkinseed sunfish and rock bass.     Lakeshore owners and users have the ability to insure that Little Splithand Lake will continue to produce a quality fishery by practicing wise use of the land and water to preserve water quality and fish habitat.  Anglers might also consider practicing catch and release or selective harvest in order to keep the fishery healthy. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Past sampling indicated quality sunfish populations in Little Split Hand Lake that were characterized by low to moderate population densities and quality size structures.  To protect this resource, a special sunfish regulation was implemented on Little Split Hand Lake in 2012, reducing the sunfish bag limit to 5.  The lake was sampled with targeted trap nets in the spring of 2012 to collect data on the panfish populations and provide a benchmark for future evaluations.   <br> \n <br> \nA total of 235 bluegills and 203 black crappies were captured in 33 net sets resulting in catches of 7.1 and 6.2 per net.  Caution should be used when interpreting catch rate data, however, as targeted sampling is designed to maximize catches and provide sufficient sample sizes for length and age structure determination but does not use standardized protocols to produce reliable catch rate data.   <br> \n <br> \nPast sampling indicated moderate sunfish densities with size structures dominated by large sunfish.  The 2012 bluegill catch was lower than in the 2010 spring assessment when 350 bluegills were sampled (11.3/trap net).  The 2012 special assessment suggests that bluegill sunfish are present in catchable numbers and that the size structure included quality sized individuals, as bluegill ranged from 3.0 to 10.1 inches in length with a mean length of 7.0 inches.  The size structure remained favorable and was similar to the past assessment, as the proportional stock density (PSD) of bluegill exceeding the quality size of 6 inches was 82, the relative stock density of angler preferred bluegill (RSD-P, >8 inches) was 28, and the relative stock density of memorable -sized bluegill (RSD-M, >10 inches) was less than 1.  Growth rates were similar to past samples and fast compared to the lake class average as individuals generally exceeded 6 inches by age 4 and 8 inches by age 7.  Recruitment appeared inconsistent as the 2007 and 2008 year classes comprised 68% of the sample.  The age distribution was good as bluegill averaged 5.1 years old suggesting good survival of adult fish.  Bluegills in Little Split Hand generally were sexually mature at age 4.  <br> \n <br> \nLittle Split Hand Lake has a history of producing high black crappie catches with poor size structures and slow growth rates.  Black crappies were captured in lower numbers in 2012 than in the 2010 assessment when 669 were captured (21.6/trap net).  The 2010 assessment resulted in a poor size structure, as only 24% of the sample exceeded 8.0 inches.  The size structure was moderate in 2012, as crappie ranged from 4.7 to 11.2 inches, with a mean of 8.5 inches.  The PSD of quality-sized crappie (>8 inches) was 66 and RSD-P (>10 inches) was 6. Past samples indicate slow growth.  Growth remained slow in 2012 as crappie generally exceeded 8 inches by age 5 and 10 inches by age 8.  Strong 2007 and 2008 year classes comprised 85% of the sample.  Crappies averaged 4.8 years of age.  Crappies in Little Split Hand generally were sexually mature at age 5.  <br> \n <br> \nLittle Split Hand Lake continues to provide good angling opportunities for high catches of small crappies but the lack of angler preferred crappie may limit the popularity of the fishery.  The lake also supports a quality sunfish population with angler opportunities to catch large sunfish.   <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Background <br> \n <br> \nLittle Splithand Lake is located about 16 miles southeast of Grand Rapids, MN.  It is in ecological lake class #29 and the Mississippi River watershed.  It is connected to the Mississippi River and to Split Hand Lake by Split Hand Creek.  Little Split Hand has a total surface area of 223 acres, a littoral area of 140 acres (63%) and a maximum depth of 25 feet.  Little Split Hand is a shallow, fertile lake that frequently experiences algae blooms, although the Secchi disk reading of 8 feet in June of 2012 indicated good water clarity at the time.  The lake is moderately developed with homes along the north and east shorelines.  There is a public access on the north shore but launching boats can be difficult during low water.  The lake is ringed with emergent and floating leaf vegetation and supports a diverse aquatic plant community.  A diverse plant community is an important attribute as it provides valuable cover for fish and wildlife.  <br> \n <br> \n A population assessment was conducted in 2012 to determine the status of the fish community.  The assessment consisted of electrofishing for bass in May and test netting in June.  The test netting consisted of 6 gill nets and 9 trap nets.  Bony structures were collected from bass, walleye, northern pike, black crappie, and yellow perch.  Structures were not collected from bluegill, as a recent spring assessment described age diversity.   <br> \n <br> \nResults <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch were the most common fish in the gill nets and have typically been abundant in Little Split Hand.  The catch was high compared lakes with similar habitats and above average for Little Split Hand Lake.  The size structure was poor, as most perch were less than 8 inches in length.  Five year classes were present (ages 2-6) and growth was poor with individuals typically exceeding 6 inches by age 4.  Poor size structure likely limits the popularity of the fishery, but perch provide a good prey base for other gamefish.   <br> \n <br> \nPast sampling suggests an abundant crappie population with poor size structure.  Black crappies were the second most common fish in the gill nets and the catch was high compared to similar lakes.  Crappie ranged from 4.8 to 11.0 inches in length with a mean of 7.9 inches.  The size structure remained poor, as few crappies exceeded 10 inches.  Past assessments indicate poor growth rates compared to the statewide average.  The growth rate remained poor in 2012 as crappie did not achieve 8 inches until age 5 and 10 inches until age 8.  Recruitment appeared inconsistent in recent years, as the 2008 year class comprised 53% of the catch.  Little Split Hand Lake should provide good angling opportunities for high catches of small crappie, given the population density and size structure. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike have historically been captured in high numbers from Little Split Hand Lake.  The catch in 2012 was high compared to similar lakes.  When northern pike occur at high density, average size is typically small and growth is poor.  The size structure was poor in 2012 as 42% exceeded 21 inches and 10% exceeded the angler preferred size of 28 inches.  Some larger pike were present, however, as pike ranged from 10.2 inches to 36.5 inches and averaged 21.2 inches in length.  Growth rates were near the statewide average, as pike typically exceeded 21 inches by age 4 and 28 inches by age 7.  Age distribution was poor, as only 16% of the sample exceeded age 5 and captured pike averaged 3.6 year of age.  Poor age distributions may indicate high adult mortality, high angler harvest of adult fish, and/or poor recruitment in the recent past.  Anglers are encouraged to help improve the pike size structure by harvesting small pike and releasing pike over 22 inches. <br> \n <br> \nLakes with habitats similar to Little Split Hand typically produce low walleye catches.  The 2012 catch was average compared to similar lakes and average for Little Split Hand.  Size structure was favorable for anglers as walleye ranged from 10.4 to 25.5 inches with an average length of 18.4 inches.  Too few walleye were captured to provide meaningful age and growth data, but growth rates appeared to be good with walleye exceeding 15 inches by age 4.   Low abundance likely limits the popularity of the walleye fishery.   <br> \n <br> \nThe electrofishing catch of largemouth bass was below average for area lakes and suggest a low density population.  Size structure was favorable, as bass ranged from 7.6 to 19.8 inches with a mean of 16.5 inches.  Growth rates were near the statewide average, as individuals typically exceeded 12 inches by age 4 and 15 inches by age 6.  Recruitment appeared inconsistent and poor in recent years, as 95% of sampled bass exceeded age 5 and captured bass averaged 7 years of age.   Good opportunities to catch large bass appear to exist given the favorable size structure. <br> \n <br> \nLittle Split Hand Lake supports a quality bluegill population.  A reduced bag limit (5 fish) was implemented in March of 2012 to help protect quality of the resource. Little Split Hand has a history of relatively low bluegill catches compared to similar lakes.  The 2012 catch was near the average for Little Split Hand Lake.  A spring assessment in May of 2012 described a favorable size structure, as 28% of the sampled bluegill exceeded 8 inches.  The summer netting suggested a poor size structure, however, as most fish failed to exceed 6 inches.  The discrepancies in the test netting suggest that the timing of assessments is important to describe the bluegill population and that targeted spring assessments are needed to document changes in size and age structure. <br> \n <br> \nLittle Split Hand Lake has a very diverse fish community.  Other captured species included brown bullhead, bowfin, pumpkinseed sunfish, rock bass, short head redhorse, white sucker, and yellow bullhead. <br> \n <br> \nMystery snails have been documented in Split Hand Lake. The Chinese mystery snail is native to Asia. It was brought to California in 1892 as a food source and found in Massachusetts in 1915, likely an aquarium release. The historic range of the banded mystery snail is the southeastern U.S., primarily in the Mississippi River system up to Illinois. It is a popular aquarium snail that's been released in Minnesota.  Both snails can form dense aggregations and disrupt native populations.  Snail die off are often considered a nuisance by landowners as dead snails litter the lakeshore.  Anglers and boaters are reminded to help stop the spread of invasive species by removing all aquatic plants from boats, trailers, and equipment.  All drain plugs must be removed and live and bait wells must be drained before leaving the access.  Anglers and boaters are encouraged to power wash and thoroughly dry all equipment prior to use in another water body.    <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Bluegill are a primary management species in Little Split Hand and are actively managed through a special regulation with a five fish limit implemented in 2012.  The 2013 management plan goal was to maintain quality Bluegill angling opportunities with 60% greater than 6 inches and 25% greater than 8 inches in spring surveys.  The intent of the survey was to compare relative abundance and size structure with spring night electrofishing. <br> \n <br> \nFour special electrofishing stations established in the spring were used again in the fall to compare seasonal catches.  Water temperature was 65F.  Bluegill were sampled at a rate of 180.7 hr/on-time, nearly four times greater than in the spring (45.7 hr/on-time).  The catch could actually have been higher but fish were lost in vegetation not typically observed in the spring.  It was difficult for one netter keeping up with the fish present.  The relationship between spring and fall electrofishing catches is unclear and any comparison should be viewed cautiously.  Bluegill shoreline movement in the spring is heavily influenced by reproductive drive, while fall shoreline movement is likely influenced by a foraging instinct in preparation for winter. <br> \n <br> \nThere was a significant difference in size structure between spring and fall sampling.  Spring size structure was satisfactory, and attained management goals.  Fall size structure was poor.  Spring lengths ranged from 3.1 to 9.7 inches and an average length of 6.3 inches, compared to lengths ranging from 1.7 to 8.2 inches with an average length of 5.7 inches.  Large fish were under-represented in fall electrofishing as only one fish over 8 inches was sampled.   It is unclear if small fish are under-represented in spring electrofishing.  Only one fish under 4.5 inches was sampled in the spring while 27 were sampled in the fall.  Bluegill tend to grow fast and it's possible fish grew to a size over summer to make them more vulnerable in the fall. <br> \n <br> \nThe high catch with poor size structure may be explained by habitat and prey preferences of different size.  All Bluegill likely have a biological urge to feed in preparation for a winter.  Larger Bluegill probably have different dietary needs than smaller ones.  They may be spending more time in deeper water where preferred prey is or they started migrating to wintering areas before the smaller fish.  Regardless, they were likely under represented in this survey and gear type.  Conversely, smaller fish were utilizing the shallow areas in the fall and possibly at a higher proportion than in the spring, which suggests small fish are under-represented in spring electrofishing, although the extent remains unclear. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Little Split Hand Lake is located about 10 miles southeast of Grand Rapids, MN with one access on the North side. The lake has a history of producing quality Bluegill and abundant Black Crappie. The management plan describes catch rate and size structure goals from spring surveys for both species that intend to maintain or improve the quality fishery. To attain the Bluegill management goal, a five sunfish daily bag limit regulation was implemented in spring 2012. The 2023 targeted survey was one of five targeting Bluegill and Black Crappie since 2010 and the second assessing the ten-year evaluation period. <br> \n <br> \nThe Bluegill catch was high compared to past spring surveys. Fish ranged from 3.2 to 9.0 inches and averaged 6.5 inches. Several quality sized fish were sampled, but the number and proportion was lower than previous surveys and below management goals. The slight reduction in larger fish is likely a combination of a pulse in recruitment and the duration of time to replace larger individuals. However, quality angling opportunities exist. Ages 3 to 10 were identified and growth was slightly faster than expected. Bluegill averaged around 7 inches (by age 6) and started to achieve a size harvested by anglers. <br> \n <br> \nThe Black Crappie catch was modest by spring survey standards and comparable to the 2022 survey. Fish ranged from 5.9 to 12.1 inches and averaged 9.0 inches. Size structure was satisfactory and resembled previous surveys, indicating favorable angling opportunities. Ages 2 to 9 were represented and age 6 comprised 41% of the sample. Growth was comparable to the statewide average with crappie averaging nearly 10 inches by age 6. <br> \n <br> \nBigmouth Buffalo are a unique species found in Little Split Hand Lake. They were considered rough fish and only minimal data was ever collected despite being occasionally caught during surveys. There is little known about them and their function in Little Split Hand Lake. Night bowfishing was authorized statewide in 2009 and has increased in popularity since. Buffalo were last observed in 2018 with one captured. It is unknown how decreased numbers of the Buffalo may affect the fish community. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled included Black, Brown and Yellow Bullhead, Bowfin, Hybrid Sunfish, Largemouth Bass, Northern Pike, Pumkinseed Sunfish, Shorthead Redhorse and White Sucker. Painted Turtles and Snapping Turtles were also observed. <br> \n</p>",

Median abundance for walleye in a lake of this ecological classification is 1.5 with a first and third quartile range from 0.67 to 3.33 respectively.  Walleye in this assessment had a gill net CPUE of 0.8.  The sample was too small to measure growth.Yellow perch have shown a decrease since the 1961 assessment when the gill net CPUE was 62.0.  Today the CPUE was at 18.4, in the upper range for lakes in this class.Northern pike have historically been abundant and remain so at 9.4 per gill net lift.  The median for this lake is 7.50.  Numbers have declined somewhat since a high in the 1980 assessment of 16.3.Black crappie were captured in the gill net at numbers well above the lake class median of 2.0 at 11.6.  Trap nets, however, sampled numbers that were at lake class medians.  Growth rates for this species is average.Bluegill and pumpkinseed were also present at levels below the lake class medians.No largemouth bass were sampled in the test nets but shoreline seining conducted yielded many young-of-the-year fish.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Little Split Hand Lake is known to produce quality Bluegill and abundant Black Crappie.  Bluegill are actively managed through a special regulation with a five fish daily limit implemented in 2012.  The 2022 targeted survey was one of four targeting Bluegill and Black Crappie since 2010 and the second since the regulation was implemented.   <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nSpring trap netting sampled 322 Bluegill at a rate of 11.5/net, which resembled previous spring targeted surveys.  Size structure remained favorable with 21% of the Bluegill exceeding 8 inches.  Lengths ranged from 2.9 to 10.2 inches with an average length of 6.6 inches.  Average length was slightly lower than previous surveys but this was likely influenced by strong recruitment in recent years.  Ice out in 2022 was exceptionally late and spring temperatures were cool which may have affected the presence of larger fish in shallow water areas.  Growth rate resembled past surveys and was fast compared to similar lakes with Bluegill nearing 8 inches by age-6.  Recruitment was frequent with fish identified from eight cohorts between ages 2 and 10.  Year-class strength varied, and the 2016 year-class comprised 33% of the sample.  Given the apparent abundance and size quality, good angling opportunities for sunfish continue to exist.   <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie were caught at a rate of 10.5/net and spawning activity was observed in shallow area with favorable habitats.  Size structure was good and resembled previous surveys.  Lengths ranged from 4.3 to 11.4 inches with an average length of 8.7 inches.  Growth resembled past surveys and was slower than the statewide average with crappie averaging 8.7 inches by age-5.  Recruitment was frequent with ages 2-10 present and appeared relatively consistent.  Given the apparent abundance and size quality, good angling opportunities for crappie continue to exist.   <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>The test net catches indicate that Little Splithand Lake contains a fish population similar to other lakes of this region which have good river connections.  Suckers, bullheads, northern pike, yellow perch, and black crappies usually make up the bulk of the fish populations in these lakes.According to local residents, northern pike and black crappies have provided most of the fishing success in recent past years.  The sizes of the black crappies caught reportedly have been good and the sizes of the northern pike caught have been small.  The length-frequency distribution of the fish taken in the test nets also indicates that the crappies are predominantly good-sized and the northern pike are predominantly small-sized.Spawning conditions for northern pike, largemouth bass, and panfish appeared to be good and spawning conditions for walleyes appeared to be only fair due to the absence of good bottom types in the lake and in the two connecting streams.  Some walleye spawning area habitat improvement in the outlet of Little Splithand Lake would increase the spawning success of walleyes from both the lake and the Mississippi River.Shoal water seining during the survey indicated that some natural reproduction of northern pike had occurred in 1961, and that largemouth bass, sunfish, and crappie spawning success was quite good.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Little Split Hand Lake is located about 16 miles southeast of Grand Rapids, MN.  Little Split Hand is a shallow, fertile lake that frequently experiences algae blooms.  The lake is moderately developed with homes along the north and east shorelines.  There is a public access on the north shore but launching boats can be difficult during low water.  The lake is surrounded by emergent and floating leaf vegetation and supports a diverse aquatic plant community.  A diverse plant community is an important attribute as it provides valuable cover for fish and wildlife.  <br> \n <br> \nThe fisheries lake management plan (LMP) was last revised in 2013.  Bluegill, Black Crappie, and Northern Pike were considered primary management species because they are well suited to the lake.  Walleye and Largemouth Bass were considered secondary species due to angler interest.  Management goals were to maintain a quality Bluegill fishery, high crappie catches compared to similar lakes, and a pike population that includes fish over 34 inches.  The lake has been managed with a 5 fish bag limit for sunfish since 2012 in an effort to protect size quality.  A Standard Survey was conducted in 2018 to evaluate the status of the fish community and help evaluate the special sunfish regulation.  This survey consisted of 6 gill nets and 9 trap nets.   <br> \n <br> \nLike many Minnesota lakes, Northern Pike have increased in number since the 1970s.  The 2018 catch was high compared to lakes with similar habitats and was the highest observed on Little Split Hand.  High pike numbers are often undesirable, however.  Growth is slow and size quality is typically poor when pike occur in high numbers.  High pike numbers may also limit production of other gamefish, including Walleye.  Pike lengths ranged from 12.6 to 34 inches and averaged 20.2 inches in 2018.  Size structure was generally poor, as only 3% of the sampled pike exceeded 28 inches.  Pike management changed in 2018 when the north central pike zone regulation was implemented.  This regulation requires anglers to release pike from 22-26 inches, but allows increased harvest of small pike by allowing a 10 fish bag limit.  Only two pike exceeding 26 inches may be in possession (note-regulations for spearing differ, please consult the fishing regulations synopsis for more information).  It is hoped that this regulation will result in improved size quality of pike on Little Split Hand Lake.  Good opportunities exist for high catches of small pike and anglers are encouraged to harvest pike under 22 inches from Little Split Hand. <br> \n <br> \nLittle Split Hand has a history of producing high numbers of Black Crappie.  The 2018 catch remained high compared to similar lakes and was above average for Little Split Hand.  Size structure was moderate as crappie lengths ranged from 4.1 to 10.9 inches and averaged around 7 inches.  Given the high numbers, good angling opportunities appear to exist for crappie.   <br> \n <br> \nBluegill have occurred in low to moderate numbers and the population produces good size quality.  Like many Minnesota lakes, Bluegill numbers have increased since the 1970s.  The 2018 catch was the highest observed for Little Split Hand, but was typical compared to similar lakes.  Size structure remained favorable for anglers, as 19% of the trap net sampled fish exceeded 8 inches.  Lengths ranged from 3.1 to 9.6 inches and averaged 6.4 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nLittle Split Hand often produces high catches of small Yellow Perch.  The 2018 catch remained high compared to similar lakes.  Perch were generally too small to interest anglers but provide an important prey species for predatory game fish.      <br> \n <br> \nPast surveys have resulted in low catches of Largemouth Bass, as bass tend to avoid test nets.  However, boat electrofishing was conducted in 2018 to better characterize the population.  The catch rate confirmed the population is low to moderate in number and has a quality size structure.  Largemouth Bass ranged from 16.3 to 19.3 inches and averaged 17.6 inches.  Given the apparent numbers and quality size, good angling opportunities exist for low catches of large bass. <br> \n <br> \nLakes with similar habitats rarely produce large numbers of Walleye.  Walleye have been present in low numbers on Little Split Hand in every survey.  The 2018 catch rate was average for the lake.  Walleye lengths ranged from 12.4 to 20.1 inches and averaged 17.5 inches.  It appears that the lake continues to support a \"bonus\" Walleye fishery but low numbers likely limit its popularity.   <br> \n <br> \nAnglers and boaters are reminded to help stop the spread of invasive species by removing all aquatic plants from boats, trailers, and equipment.  All drain plugs must be removed and live and bait wells must be drained before leaving the access.  Anglers and boaters are encouraged to power wash and thoroughly dry all equipment prior to use in another water body.    <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Little Splithand Lake is a centrarchid lake that has historically supported a modest walleye fishery.  The lake lies about 11 miles southeast of Grand Rapids, MN.  It has 223 acres, a littoral area of 140 acres, a maximum depth of 25 feet and a Secchi disk reading of 11 feet.  Little Splithand is in ecological lake class #29.     In this survey, walleye were sampled at 1.7/gill net just above the lake class median and at the highest level observed since the 1975 survey.  No walleye stocking has taken place since 1996 except for a stocking of 700 fingerling walleyes in 2002 by the Splithand Lake Association.  No walleye were sampled from this stocking and only 1 (10%) was sampled from a stocked year.  The walleye in this assessment ranged in length from 17.3 to 26.4 inches and had a mean length of 21.7 inches.  They had a mean weight of 3.4 pounds.  Six year classes were represented in the test netting.       The northern pike population is characterized by high numbers (13.8/gill net) of small fish.  The mean weight of those sampled in the gill net was 2.3 pounds.  A few individuals in the catch, however, were large (37.0 and 38.5 inches). A PSD of 48 and a RSD-P of 6 was calculated from the gill net data.  Age 3-5 fish made up 88% of the catch.  Growth was within 15% of the statewide averages.     No largemouth bass were sampled in the test netting portion of the assessment.  However, 14 largemouth or 10.4/hour were sampled during the electrofishing assessment on June 14.  These bass ranged in length from 12.4 to 20.6 inches and had mean length of 17.0 inches.  The mean weight of those sampled was 3.1 pounds.  Growth exceeded the statewide averages for all age groups.        Black crappie were sampled in the gill net at 17.3/set and in the trap net at 6.6/set.  The gill net sampled crappie ranged in length from 4.3 to 11.0 inches and had a mean length of 7.6 inches.  In the trap nets, they ranged in length from 6.5 to 10.4 inches and had a mean length of 8.7 inches.  A combined PSD value of 59 and RSD-P of 6 was calculated from the gill net and trap net data.  Growth was <85% of the statewide averages for crappies in their 4th to 7th year.             Bluegills have never been abundant in Little Splithand.  A trap net catch of 9.0/set was observed in this assessment while none were sampled in the gill net.  The trap net catch was well below the median and just above the 1st quartile for this lake class. The bluegill sampled in the trap net ranged in length from 3.6 to 9.5 inches and had a mean length of 6.8 inches. A PSD value of 74 and an RSD-P of 43 were calculated from the trap net data.         Yellow perch were sampled at the highest level ever recorded at 68.5/gill net. Well above the lake class 3rd quartile of 21.5.  They ranged in length from 4.9 to 9.2 inches and had a mean length of 6.5 inches.             Other species sampled were rock bass, bowfin, shorthead redhorse, white sucker, pumpkinseed and hybrid sunfish and brown and yellow bullhead.    </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Little Split Hand Lake is located about 16 miles southeast of Grand Rapids, MN.  Little Split Hand is a shallow, fertile lake that frequently experiences algae blooms.  The lake is moderately developed with homes along the north and east shorelines.  There is a public access on the north shore but launching boats can be difficult during low water.  The lake is surrounded by emergent and floating leaf vegetation and supports a diverse aquatic plant community.  A diverse plant community is an important attribute as it provides valuable cover for fish and wildlife.  <br> \n <br> \nPast surveys of Little Split Hand Lake indicate a quality sunfish population that was characterized by low to moderate numbers and quality size structure.  To protect this resource, a special sunfish regulation was implemented in 2012, reducing the sunfish bag limit to 5.  The lake was sampled with trap nets and boat electrofishing in the spring of 2018 to collect data on the panfish populations and help evaluate the special regulation. <br> \n <br> \nThe 2018 survey captured 169 Bluegill and continued to illustrate a Bluegill population characterized by moderate numbers and quality size structure.  Size structure was similar to past spring surveys, as trap net caught Bluegill ranged from 3 to 10.2 inches in length with an average length of 7.3 inches.  Approximately 50% of the sampled Bluegill exceeded 8 inches and 15% exceeded 9 inches.  Good angling opportunities exist for catching quality sized Bluegill. <br> \n <br> \nNight time boat electrofishing was conducted in late May to evaluate electrofishing as an alternative sampling method to trap netting for Bluegill.  Sixty-eight Bluegill were sampled by electrofishing.  The electrofishing survey also illustrated a quality size structure, as Bluegill ranged from 4.3 to 9.6 inches with an average length of 6.9 inches.  Approximately 40% of the sample exceeded 8 inches and 6% exceeded 9 inches.  The subtle differences in size distribution are to be expected, because electrofishing is known to sample a broader length distribution of Bluegill than spring trap netting.  Both gears resulted in higher catches of 5-6 inch Bluegill and 8-9 inch Bluegill, and lower catches of 6-8 inch Bluegill, likely reflecting variations in year class production.   Given the similarities between the two gears, it appears that electrofishing may be a viable method to describe size structure of Bluegill on Little Split Hand during the spring sampling period. <br> \n <br> \nLittle Split Hand Lake has a history of producing high Black Crappie catches with relatively poor size structures and slow growth rates.  The 2018 survey resulted in an improved size distribution, as 61% of the sample exceeded 8.0 inches and 23% exceeded 10 inches.  Crappie ranged from 4.2 to 11.9 inches, with an average of 8.6 inches.  Given the size quality and apparent abundance, good angling opportunities exist for crappie.   <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Little Splithand Lake has a surface area of 223 acres, of which 63% is littoral, a max depth of 25 feet, and is primarily managed for bluegill and black crappie.  An experimental conservation regulation allowing a \"sunfish\" bag limit of 5 has been proposed to be implemented in March, 2012.  The intent is to maintain quality sunfish angling opportunities measured by a PSD-6 greater than 60 and increasing RSD-8 greater than 25.  This was the first special assessment, collecting baseline data, specifically targeting bluegill and black crappie when they are both most susceptible.  Catch rates from standard summer lake surveys are not directly comparable to spring special assessments, but may be a supplemental measure of management goals.  Trap nets were set and lifted over four days for a total effort of 30 net nights.  Bluegill and black crappie were measured for length and weight.  Scales were collected from bluegill and black crappie and bluegill sex was determined when possible. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill were sampled at a rate of 11.7/trap net.  The highest summer catch rate was 9.0/trap net (2004), similar to the lake class first quartile.  Lengths were from 3.8 to 10 inches with a mean length of 7.1 inches.  Size structure was good exceeding the regulation PSD goal while the proportion of preferred length fish were less than the goal (PSD-6=96, RSD-8=14, RSD-10=<1).  Scale analysis identified six consecutive age classes from age 3 to 8 present.  Back-calculated length-at-age suggests growth was near average at age 1 and exceed Lake Class 29 averages for all others.  Bluegill typically exceeded eight inches by age 6. <br> \n <br> \nFemales were most abundant, comprising 56% of the sample.  This trend is similar to that observed in other spring sampled bluegill sex distributions in area lakes.  Growth was similar, but proportional size distributions were slightly different when differentiated by sex.  There were no fish measured less than stock size, males and females had the same PSD-6 value (96), while females appeared to have a slightly more favorable size distribution (RSD-8=20, RSD-10=1) compared to males (RSD-8=6, RSD-10=0). <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie appeared to be highly susceptible to spring sampling, being sampled at a rate of 22.3/trap net.  The highest summer catch rate was 6.6/trap net (2004).  Lengths were from 4.1 to 11.3 inches with a mean length of 7.3 inches.  Scale analysis identified seven consecutive age classes present from ages 2-8.  It appears the fishery is not limited by inconsistent recruitment.  Back-calculated length-at-age suggests growth is relatively slow being less than the statewide median for all ages.  Black crappie averaged ten inches by age 7. <br> \n</p>",
