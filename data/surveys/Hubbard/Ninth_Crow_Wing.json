                "narrative": "<p>Ninth Crow Wing Lake is located three miles east of Nevis in southeastern Hubbard County.  Ninth Crow Wing Lake is part of a larger chain of lakes running from Eleventh Crow Wing Lake at the headwaters, down to First Crow Wing Lake.  Ninth Crow Wing Lake has a surface area of 232 acres and a maximum depth of 65 feet.  There is no public access on Ninth Crow Wing Lake, but there are public accesses located on both Eighth and Tenth Crow Wing Lakes, and the river between can be navigated with most boats. <br> \n <br> \nThe Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics.  Ninth Crow Wing Lake is in Lake Class 23.  Class 23 lakes are generally very deep, with hard and clear water, and have a low littoral area.  Other class 23 lakes in the Park Rapids area include: Benedict, Blue, Boot, East Crooked, Eleventh Crow Wing, Lower LaSalle and Spearhead. <br> \n <br> \nA special 40-inch minimum length limit on Northern Pike was implemented in the spring of 2003 at Eighth, Ninth and Tenth Crow Wing Lakes and is still in place.  In the 2018 sampling of Ninth Crow Wing Lake, Northern Pike had an average length and weight of 27.4 inches and 5.2 pounds, with fish measured up to 40 inches.  The lake also has a population of Largemouth Bass, showing similar numbers and size as other recent samples.  Largemouth Bass were an average length of 12 inches with fish sampled up to 18 inches. <br> \n <br> \nNinth Crow Wing Lake can provide good fishing for Bluegill and Black Crappie.  Bluegills were sampled in lower numbers compared to past surveys.  Anglers will find most Bluegills in the 6.5 - 8 inch size range.  Black Crappie were sampled in similar numbers to past years, with fish up to 10.5 inches.  Yellow Perch were sampled in low numbers.  Most  Perch were too small for angling, but they provide a good forage base for Northern Pike. <br> \n <br> \nCurrently no aquatic invasive species (AIS) have been identified in Ninth Crow Wing Lake.  To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Ninth Crow Wing Lake is located in southern Hubbard County, four miles southwest of Akeley.  Ninth Crow Wing has a surface area of 227 acres and a maximum depth of 65 feet.  There is no public access on Ninth Crow Wing.  However, boating access is obtained from Eighth and Tenth Crow Wing lakes by the Crow Wing River which flows through this chain of lakes.  Ninth Crow Wing provides angling opportunities for northern pike, largemouth bass, panfish, and an occasional walleye. <br> \n <br> \nThe Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics.  Ninth Crow Wing is in lake class 23.  Other area lakes in this same classification include: Benedict, Blue, Boot, East Crooked, Eleventh Crow Wing, and Spearhead. <br> \n <br> \nPresent and past surveys have shown that Ninth Crow Wing, as well as other lakes in this chain, have been able to maintain a low to moderate northern pike population composed of moderate to quality-sized fish.  Starting in 2003 a special 40 inch minimum size length limit for northern pike was implemented on Fifth, Sixth, Eighth, Ninth and Tenth Crow Wing Lakes.  The intent of this regulation is to increase the size strucute of northern pike in this chain of lakes.  Northern pike abundance was up from past surveys, with the gillnet catch rate of 5.0 pike/net within the range \"typical\" for this lake class.  Northern pike numbers in past surveys have been lower (1-2 pike/gillnet), below the range \"typical\" for this lake class.  Sampled northern pike had an average length and weight of 29.9 inches and 6.4 lbs, with pike measured up to 40.4 inches.  The northern pike in Ninth Crow Wing are fast growing when compared to other area lakes.  Low northern pike numbers and an abundant forage base of tullibee (cisco), white sucker, and yellow perch provide the right conditions to produce large pike. <br> \n <br> \nNinth Crow Wing supports an abundant largemouth bass population.  Largemouth bass were sampled in high numbers during spring electrofishing (85 bass/hour).  Anglers will find good numbers of bass in the 14-16 inch size range.  Largemouth bass up to 19.0 inches were sampled during the survey.  Good water quality, emergent and submergent aquatic vegetation, and spawning substrate provide excellent habitat for largemouth bass in Ninth Crow Wing. <br> \n <br> \nNinth Crow Wing supports an abundant panfish population and can provide good fishing for bluegill, pumpkinseed, and black crappie.  The panfish population in Ninth Crow Wing is known more for numbers than size of fish.  Anglers will find lots of bluegill and pumpkinseed in the 6-inch size range.  Good numbers of black crappie were sampled with catch rates above the range \"typical\" for this lake class. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers will find a low to moderate walleye population in Ninth Crow Wing.  Much of the walleye population in Ninth Crow Wing is likely the result of migration of walleye from Eighth Crow Wing Lake.  Eighth Crow Wing Lake is stocked with walleye fingerlings by the DNR.  Spawning areas for walleye on Ninth Crow Wing are limited primarily to the inlet and outlet areas. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled included moderate numbers of yellow bullhead, rock bass, hybrid sunfish, and bowfin (dogfish) and low numbers of brown bullhead, green sunfish and golden shiner. <br> \n <br> \n. <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

It has a maximum depth of 65 feet with 42 percent of the lake being littoral area.  Shoal water soils are 90 percent silt with 10 percent sand present.Fish taken in gillnets in numbers greater than the statewide median catch per set were: northern cisco (tullibee), golden shiner, northern pike, and yellow perch.  Trapnets took bowfin, black bullhead, yellow bullhead, largemouth bass, pumpkinseed, bluegill, and rock bass in numbers greater than the statewide median catch per set.This lake has very light shoreline development at this time with only four cabins and two boats present.  During the winter of 1962-63 there were 3 fish houses present on this lake.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of nearshore fish species in Ninth Crow Wing Lake was conducted on August 2-4, 2021 by Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program Staff.  Nearshore sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot seine, where possible.  There was difficult sampling at nearly every site due to soft substrates and vegetation, primarily water lilies. Backpack electrofishing was completed at all ten sampling stations, but two stations were sampled from the boat due to site conditions.  Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample two stations, a 15-foot seine was used at five stations, and site conditions (soft sediments and dense water lilies in deep water) prevented the use of seines at three stations.  Nearshore sampling captured 19 species of fish including eight species that are intolerant of disturbance (i.e., Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, Least Darter, Mimic Shiner, Mottled Sculpin, Rock Bass) and one species that is tolerant of disturbance (Green Sunfish). <br> \n <br> \nA concurrent summer trap net survey was conducted by IBI Program Staff. Nine trap nets were set along the shoreline in locations that encompassed multiple habitat types. Bluegill were the most abundant and comprised a majority of the trap net catch by biomass.  The number of Bluegill sampled per net was just the 50% quartile for similar Lake Class 23 lakes and the average length was 6.1 inches, with 21% over 7 inches. <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore and trap net data were combined with gill net data from an August 2018 survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based IBI (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment.  In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g., Blackchin Shiner, Least Darter, and Rock Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g.,  Common Carp and Green Sunfish).  The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake.  For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.   <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey indicates Ninth Crow Wing Lake is healthy as indicated by an exceptionally high FIBI score, well above the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes.  Data from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Crow Wing River Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Walleye gillnet catch rates (3.80 fish/set and 5.38 lbs/set in 1992) have increased since 1962 to settle within the normal range for lake class 25.  Mean weight of individual walleye in 1992 was 1.42 lbs.  The size structure (PSD=71, RSD-P=24) indicates high numbers of quality-length fish and an adequate proportion of preferred-length fish in the population.  However, no walleye sampled were >23 inches.  Growth rates are varialble among year classes, but are generally fast.  Mean length at age 4 is 14.90 inches.  Walleye are not stocked into 9th Crow Wing Lake, however, migration may occur from other lakes in the Crow Wing chain.  Thirty-three percent of the sampled walleye were age 4.Number of northern pike sampled (1.40 fish/gillnet) was below the first quartile, whereas 6.78 lbs/gillnet was within the normal range for lakes in class 25.  These numbers result in a high mean weight of 4.84 lbs.  Northern pike abundance has decreased since 1962, but along with this decrease in number has been an increase in mean weight.  Age and growth analysis suggests low annual recruitment is the cause of declining density.  The size structure (PSD=100, RSD-P=29) is dominated by quality-length fish.  Northern pike exhibit fast growth through age 3, averaging 22.28 inches at age 3.  These fast growth rates contribute to the large proportion of quality-length northern pike in the population.Rock bass, bluegill and black crappie catch rates were all within the normal ranges for this class of lakes.  Black crappie and rock bass densities have remained relatively stable the past 30 years; however, bluegill abundance has dropped from 152.40 fish/trapnet in 1962 to 37.80 fish/trapnet in 1992.  A large decrease also occurred in pumpkinseed abundance, which fell from 54.40 fish/trapnet in 1962 to 11.10 fish/trapnet in 1992.  Sampling time of year is probably influencing the large differences in catch rates.  The 1962 sampling was done in late June, when trapnet catch rates tend to be higher than in late summer.  The 1992 sampling was done in August.  Pumpkinseed catch rates remain above the third quartile, however, along with catches of largemouth bass and yellow perch.  Largemouth bass density has gradually increased since 1962.  Almost half (44%) of the largemouth bass sampled were below stock length; however, small proportions of the population reached quality and preferred lengths (PSD=22, RSD-P=11).  Largemouth bass exhibit good growth rates, averaging 11.23 inches at age 4.  Pumpkinseed (PSD=22) and yellow perch (PSD=1) also have small size structures.  A higher proportion of bluegill attain quality-length (PSD=60), but none sampled were >8 inches.  The poor size structure may be the result of slow bluegill growth rates.  Mean length at age 4 = 4.49 inches.  Black crappie are the only panfish with a large size structure (PSD=67, RSD-P=33).Yellow bullhead are the only non-game species which may be causing problems in 9th Crow Wing Lake.  Gillnet catches of yellow bullhead have been increasing since 1962 and were above the third quartile in 1992.  Bowfin catch rates were below the first quartile.  Number of white sucker was within the normal range, whereas pounds per set was above the third quartile.  Neither of thes two species have experienced notable population fluctuations.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Ninth Crow Wing Lake is located in southern Hubbard County, four miles southwest of Akeley.  Ninth Crow Wing has a surface area of 227 acres and a maximum depth of 65 feet.  There is no public access on Ninth Crow Wing, however, boating access is obtained from Eighth and Tenth Crow Wing lakes by the Crow Wing River which flows through these chain of lakes.  Ninth Crow Wing provides angling opportunities for largemouth bass, northern pike, panfish, and a bonus walleye population.The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical and chemical characteristics.  Ninth Crow Wing is in lake class 23.  Other area lakes in this same classification include: Benedict, Blue, Boot, East Crooked, Eleventh Crow Wing, and Spearhead.Ninth Crow Wing supports an abundant largemouth bass population.  Spring electrofishing was conducted for the first time and good numbers of largemouth bass were sampled when compared to other area lakes (113 bass/hour).  Anglers will find lots of bass up to 14.0 inches, however, the number of bass sampled over 15.0 inches was low when compared to other area lakes.  Anglers have reported catching largemouth bass up to 20 inches.  Good water quality, emergent and submergent aquatic vegetation, and spawning substrate provide excellent habitat for largemouth bass in Ninth Crow Wing.Present and past surveys have shown that Ninth Crow Wing has been able to maintain a low to moderate northern pike population composed of moderate to quality-sized fish.  The northern pike gillnet catch rate of 2.0 pike/net is below the range \"typical\" for this lake class.  Northern pike abundance in past surveys has been similar.  Sampled northern pike had a mean weight of 4.2 pounds with fish measured up to 31.6 inches.  The northern pike in Ninth Crow Wing are fast growing when compared to other area lakes.  Starting in the spring of 2003 a special 40 inch minimum size limit on northern pike was implemented on Eighth, Ninth, and Tenth Crow Wing Lakes.  The intent of this regulation is to increase and protect large northern pike in this chain of lakes.  The regulation was initially intended just for Eighth Crow Wing Lake, but Ninth and Tenth Crow Wing Lakes were added due to boat travel between theses lakes.Ninth Crow Wing has an abundant panfish population and can provide good fishing for bluegill, pumpkinseed, and black crappie.  The panfish population in Ninth Crow Wing is known more for numbers than size of fish.  Anglers will find lots of bluegill and pumpkinseed in the 6.0 inch range, however, enough larger fish are present that you can sort through the small ones and still get a few \"eaters\".  Good numbers of black crappie were sampled with catch rates just above the range \"typical\" for this lake class.  Good numbers of 6-8 inch black crappie were sampled with fish measured up to 11.6 inches. Anglers will find a low to moderate walleye population in Ninth Crow Wing.  The walleye population in Ninth Crow Wing is likely the result of migration of stocked walleye from Eighth and Tenth Crow Wing Lakes.  Eighth and Tenth Crow Wing lakes are heavily stocked with walleye fingerlings by the DNR.  Spawning areas for walleye on Ninth Crow Wing are limited to the inlet and outlet areas.Other species sampled included moderate numbers of yellow perch, rock bass, yellow bullhead, bowfin (dogfish), and golden shiner.  Brown bullhead, hybrid sunfish, and green sunfish were sampled in low numbers.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Ninth Crow Wing Lake is located in southern Hubbard County, 3.5 miles southwest of Akeley.  Ninth Crow Wing has a surface area of 227 acres and a maximum depth of 65 feet.  There is no public access on Ninth Crow Wing, however, boating access is obtained from the channels (Crow Wing River) connecting to Eighth and Tenth Crow Wing Lakes.  Ninth Crow Wing is best noted for its largemouth bass, northern pike, and panfish fishery.  The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical and chemical characteristics.  Ninth Crow Wing is in lake class 23.  Other area lakes in this same classification include: Benedict (1.5 miles southwest of the town of Benedict), East Crooked (5 miles north of Nevis), and Eleventh Crow Wing (north of Akeley).  Twenty largemouth bass were sampled using standard survey gear (gillnets and trapnets), with catch rates typical for lake class 23.  Historical surveys have had similar catches.  Largemouth bass up to 19.1 inches were sampled, with growth rates similar to other class 23 lakes.  Standard survey gear is not an effective method to assess largemouth bass abundance or size distribution.  To adequately assess a bass population, special sampling such as spring electrofishing needs to be conducted.  No electrofishing has been conducted on Ninth Crow Wing.  Ninth Crow Wing has good water quality, bottom substrate, and aquatic vegetation that will help insure a healthy largemouth bass population.Present and past surveys have shown that Ninth Crow Wing has been able to maintain a low to moderate density northern pike population composed of moderate to quality-sized fish.  The northern pike gillnet catch rate of 1.7/net is below the range typical for lake class 23.  Past surveys (1979, 87, and 92) had similar northern pike gillnet catch rates, while the 1962 catch rate was higher (4.7/net).  Sampled northern pike were an average weight of 3.1 pounds, with fish measured up to 34.0 inches.  Age three and older northern pike exhibited fast growth rates when compared to other class 23 lakes.Walleye were sampled in low numbers (1.7/net), but within the typical range for lake class 23.  Historical walleye gillnet catch rates have been similar ranging from 0.2/net (1979) to 3.8/net (1992).  Sampled walleye ranged in length from 13.0 to 27.1 inches.  Walleye growth rates were slow when compared to other class 23 lakes.  No walleye are stocked into Ninth Crow Wing due to the fact that there is no public access on the lake and Ninth Crow Wing is managed for largemouth bass and northern pike.  The walleye population in Ninth Crow Wing is likely the result of migration of stocked walleye from Eighth and Tenth Crow Wing Lakes due to barrier dams above Tenth Crow Wing and below Eighth Crow Wing.  Spawning areas for walleye are limited on Ninth Crow Wing and any contribution from natural reproduction to the walleye population is likely to occur in Eighth and Tenth Crow Wing Lakes.  All of the walleye ages sampled corresponded to years of walleye fingerling stocking in either Eighth or Tenth Crow Wing Lakes.  However, there have not been any simultaneous non-stocked years in these lakes to allow for evaluation of natural reproduction. The bluegill trapnet catch rate of 30.3/net is within the range typical for lake class 23.  Historical bluegill trapnet catch rates have been higher: 37.8/net (1992), 89.1/net (1987), 56.3/net (1979), and 152.4/net (1962).  Bluegill were fair in size averaging 6.5 inches long, with fish measured up to 8.1 inches.  Bluegill growth rates were above other class 23 lakes.Black crappie were sampled in moderate numbers (2.0/gillnet and 1.2/trapnet).  Previous surveys have had similar black crappie catch rates for both gear types.  Black crappie up to 10.3 inches were sampled.The yellow perch gillnet catch rate of 13.3/net is within the range typical for lake class 23.  Historical yellow perch gillnet catch rates have been higher, ranging from 14.3/net (1987) to 80.8/net (1979).  Sampled yellow perch were an average length of 6.3 inches with fish measured up to 10.3 inches.  The yellow perch population in Ninth Crow Wing is primarily a forage base for the northern pike and walleye and are generally too small to be acceptable to anglers.Pumpkinseed were sampled in moderate numbers (5.4/net).  Historical pumpkinseed trapnet catch rates have been higher, ranging from 9.4/net (1987) to 54.4/net (1962).  Size of pumpkinseed was fair with an average length of 5.9 inches and with fish measured up to 7.7 inches.Yellow and brown bullhead were sampled in Ninth Crow Wing with yellow bullhead the more abundant of the two species.  Yellow bullhead were sampled at 1.8/gillnet, lower than previous surveys.  Brown bullhead were sampled in low numbers (0.2/gillnet), similar to past surveys.Other fish sampled in the 1997 survey in low numbers included: white sucker, rock bass, hybrid sunfish, and bowfin (dogfish).  Golden shiner were sampled in moderate numbers (1.5/gillnet). Anglers can help maintain or improve the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for table fare, but encourages release of medium to large-size fish.  Releasing these fish will help maintain the fish population in Ninth Crow Wing and provides anglers with opportunities to catch more and larger fish in the future.</p>",

A survey targeting near shore fish species was conducted by Park Rapids Fisheries Staff on July 18, 2018 to assess populations of non-game and small sport fish.  Ten 100-foot sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake shore, sampling a variety of habitat types.  Each site was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot 1/8th-inch mesh seine, depending on habitat conditions.   <br> \n <br> \nDuring this assessment, none of the sites were sampled with a 50-foot seine and three sites were sampled with a 15-foot seine. Site conditions prevented the use of seines at seven sites.  Backpack electrofishing was done at all 10 sites, several of which were conducted from the side of the boat.  Nearshore sampling captured eight species of fish.  No species were sampled that are intolerant of disturbance.  Other species sampled during the nearshore effort included Bluegill, Bluntnose Minnow, Central Mudminnow, Iowa Darter, Green Sunfish, Largemouth Bass, Mottled Sculpin, and Yellow Perch.  Nearshore catches will be used along with gill net and trap net catch data from a standard fisheries survey conducted on August 13, 2018, to calculate a fish-based Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) score which is indicative of the health of Ninth Crow Wing Lake.   <br> \n <br> \nThis survey is contributing to a watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.  Ninth Crow Wing Lake is located in the Crow Wing River Watershed.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Ninth Crow Wing is located four miles east of Nevis in southeastern Hubbard County.  Ninth Crow Wing is part of a larger chain of lakes running from Eleventh Crow Wing Lake at the headwaters, down to First Crow Wing Lake.  Ninth Crow Wing has a surface area of 232 acres and a maximum depth of 65 feet.  There is no public access on Ninth Crow Wing, but there are public accesses located on both Eighth and Tenth Crow Wing Lakes and can be navigated to with most boats.  Ninth Crow Wing provides fishing opportunities for Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, and panfish. <br> \n <br> \nThe Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics.  Ninth Crow Wing is in lake class 23.  Class 23 lakes are generally very deep, with hard and clear water, and have a low littoral area (lake area less than 15 feet deep).  Other class 23 lakes in the Park Rapids management area include: Benedict, Blue, Boot, East Crooked, Eleventh Crow Wing, Lower LaSalle, and Spearhead. <br> \n <br> \nA special 24-36 inch protected slot length limit for Northern Pike was implemented in the spring of 2020 on Eighth, Ninth, and Tenth Crow Wing Lakes.  The objective of this regulation was to maintain or increase Northern Pike sizes.  From 2003 to 2019 these lakes had a 40 inch minimum size limit on Northern Pike.   Northern Pike abundance in recent surveys has fluctuated in moderate numbers for this lake class with good average size.  Sampled pike had an average length and weight of 23.8 inches and 3.0 pounds with fish measured up to 32.8 inches. <br> \n <br> \nPresent and past surveys have shown that Ninth Crow Wing supports an abundant Largemouth Bass population.  Anglers will find good numbers of bass in the 14-16 inch size range.  Largemouth Bass up to 18.2 inches were sampled during the survey.  Good water quality, emergent and submergent aquatic vegetation, and spawning substrate provides excellent habitat for Largemouth Bass in Ninth Crow Wing. <br> \n <br> \nNinth Crow Wing supports an abundant panfish population and can provide good fishing for Bluegill, Pumpkinseed, and Black Crappie.  Anglers will find Bluegill and Pumpkinseed in the 6-8 inch size range and Black Crappie in the 9-11 inch size range.   <br> \n <br> \nThe Yellow Perch population in Ninth Crow Wing typically run smaller in size and generally not an acceptable size for angling with most fish under 8.0 inches. <br> \nAnglers will find a low to moderate Walleye population in Ninth Crow Wing.  Walleye up to 26.6 inches were sampled during the survey. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled included moderate numbers of Rock Bass and Golden Shiner.  Green Sunfish, Hybrid Sunfish, Bowfin, and Yellow Bullhead were sampled in low numbers. <br> \n <br> \nCurrently no aquatic invasive species (AIS) have been identified in Eighth Crow Wing.  To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all plants and animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boats before leaving the access. <br> \n</p>",

Ninth Crow Wing Lake is part of a larger chain of lakes running from Eleventh Crow Wing Lake at the headwaters, down to First Crow Wing Lake.  Ninth Crow Wing has a surface area of 223 acres and a maximum depth of 65 feet.  There is no public access on Ninth Crow Wing, but there is are public accesses located on both Eighth and Tenth Crow Wing Lakes, and can be navigated to with a boat. <br> \n <br> \nThe Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics. Ninth Crow Wing is in Lake Class 23. Class 23 lakes are generally very deep, with hard and clear water, and have a low littoral area. Other class 23 lakes in the Park Rapids area include: Benedict, Blue, Boot, East Crooked, Eleventh Crow Wing, Lower LaSalle and Spearhead. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers can expect to find an abundant population of northern pike in Ninth Crow Wing. Sampled northern pike had an average length and weight of 27.1 inches and 4.6 pounds, with pike measured up to 42 inches in 2013.  A special 40-inch minimum length limit on northern pike was implemented in the spring of 2003 and is still in place.  The lake also has a healthy population of largemouth bass, showing similar numbers and size to recent years.  Largemouth bass had an average length of 12 inches with fish sampled up to 18 inches.  Ninth Crow Wing supports a healthy panfish population and can provide good fishing for bluegill and black crappie. Bluegills were sampled in lower numbers compared to past surveys. Anglers will find most bluegills in the 6 - 7.5 inch size range. Black crappie abundance was also similar to past years.  The size was good for anglers, with fish sampled up to 12 inches.  Yellow perch were seen in low numbers and most fish were too small for angling, but the yellow perch provide a good forage base for northern pike. <br> \n <br> \nCurrently no aquatic invasive species (AIS) have been identified in Ninth Crow Wing. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access.</p>",
