A total of ten 100-foot sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake shore, sampling a variety of habitat types.  Each site was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot 1/8th-inch mesh seine, depending on habitat conditions.  Sites where habitat conditions did not allow for seining were backpack electrofished unless conditions proved difficult for walking. These sites were backpack shocked from the boat. Nearshore sampling captured 20 species of fish including 10 species that are intolerant of disturbance (Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, Least Darter, Mimic Shiner, Mottled Sculpin, Pugnose Shiner, Rock Bass, and Smallmouth Bass).  <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore data was combined with data collected during a gill net and trap net survey conducted the week of August 26, 2019 to calculate a FIBI score for the lake. The FIBI Tool-2 was used for scoring and resulted in an FIBI score of 77, which is above both the impairment threshold (45) and the exceptional threshold (64) for this tool.  <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Leech Lake River Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Upper Trelipe Lake is a 421-acre lake located east of Longville, MN that has 4.16 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 69 feet.  There is a Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) public access on the southwest shore that may be reached from Cass County Road 7 and Beaver Drive NE.  The DNR has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different classes based on physical, chemical and other characteristics.  Upper Trelipe Lake is in Lake Class 23; lakes in this class are very deep, have a very low percentage of area less than 15 feet deep, are hard-water lakes, and are very clear. Other local waters in this class include Baby, Mule, and Ponto Lakes.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike abundance in Upper Trelipe Lake is similar to other lakes in this class.  The average length of Northern Pike sampled in this lake by DNR in 2014 was 22 inches, and fish up to 30 inches were present.  Largemouth Bass were commonly sampled and fish up 17 inches were found.  Walleye were abundant compared to other lakes in this class.  Sampled walleye ranged from 9 to 27 inches, with an average length of 15 inches.  Bluegill abundance was lower than in most lakes in this class, and Bluegill up to 9 inches were sampled.  Black Crappie numbers compared favorably to other waters in Lake Class 23, however most were in the 5 to 6 inch categories.  Other fish species collected during the 2014 sampling include Bowfin (Dogfish), Brown Bullhead, Tullibee (Cisco), Green Sunfish, Hybrid Sunfish, Pumpkinseed, Rock Bass, Smallmouth Bass, White Sucker, Yellow Bullhead, and Yellow Perch.        <br> \n <br> \nPeople can have significant impacts on lakes and the fish populations they support.  Harvest, lakeshore development, removal of shoreline vegetation, and introductions of invasive species can all adversely affect fish populations. Currently there are no aquatic invasive species (AIS) that have been identified in Upper Trelipe Lake. AIS are moved from infested to non-infested waters by anglers, boaters, and lake shore owners and can adversely impact lakes and fish populations. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access. If you suspect an infestation of an invasive species in this lake, save a specimen and report it to a local natural resource office. Additional information on all of these topics can be found on the DNR website (www.dnr.state.mn.us) or by contacting the Walker Area Fisheries office.  <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Upper Trelipe Lake is a 409 acre lake that is located 8 miles east of Longville MN. Upper Trelipe has a maximum depth of 69 feet, and approximately 35% of the lake is 15 feet deep or less. The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different classes based on physical and chemical characteristics. Upper Trelipe is in lake class 23. There is a public access at the northwest corner of the lake.Walleye abundance was near average levels for this lake in 1998. However, walleye abundance was nearly double the median level observed for lakes of this type. Walleye sampled ranged from 16.9 to 24.1 inches, with a average length of 19.5 inches. Northern pike abundance in 1998 was at the second highest level observed since 1960. This level of abundance was within the expected range for lakes of this type. Northern pike sampled ranged from 8.9 to 28.3 inches with a average length of 19.3 inches.Black crappie abundance was near historic high levels in 1998, and was near the lake class median. Crappie sampled ranged from 4.4 to 12.8 inches with a average length of 6.4 inches. Growth rates for crappie were similar to statewide averages for all age classes. Bluegill were captured at historic high levels in 1998, however, bluegill have historically been sampled at relativey low levels when compared to similar lakes. The size structure for bluegill has been decreasing over time. This may be due to overharvest of the largest individuals in the population. Selective harvest (releasing fish larger than 7.0 inches) may benefit the bluegill population in Upper Trelipe Lake. Bluegill sampled ranged from 3.3 to 7.8 inches, with a mean length of 5.1 inches.Upper Trelipe lake has relatively low phosphorous fertility and high water quality.  Shoreline best management practices should be used to maintain the relatively pristine water quality that is present in Upper Trelipe Lake.     </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Upper Trelipe Lake is a 421-acre lake with 4.16 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 69 feet located southwest of Remer, MN. A Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MNDNR) owned public access is located on the west shore. The DNR has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different classes based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics. Upper Trelipe Lake is in Lake Class 23; lakes in this class are generally deep and clear. Other Lake class 23 lakes in the Walker Area include Baby, Mule, Man, and Stony. The lake is primarily managed for Largemouth Bass, Walleye, Black Crappie and secondarily for Northern Pike, Bluegill, Tullibee (Cisco), and Yellow Perch. A daily limit of five Sunfish was implemented in 2022 on Upper Trelipe.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance did not meet the long-range management goal of at least six fish per net. Walleye lengths ranged from 12 to 25 inches with an average length of 18 inches. Northern Pike numbers are moderate and have remained within management goals since 1960. Sampled pike ranged in length from 16 to 36 inches with an average length of 21 inches. Black Crappie abundance was high, and lengths ranged from 4 to 12 inches with an average length of 9 inches. Bluegill abundance was similar to recent surveys but below management goals. Bluegill lengths ranged from 3 to 8 inches and fish averaged 5 inches long. Largemouth Bass ranged in length from 6 to 16 inches. Yellow Perch abundance remained low, well below management goals. A total of six Smallmouth Bass were sampled ranging in length from 13 to 16 inches. The first year Smallmouth Bass were captured in any MNDNR gear was 2019. <br> \n <br> \nOther fish sampled in Upper Trelipe Lake included Bowfin, Green Sunfish, Hybrid Sunfish, Pumpkinseed, Rock Bass, White Sucker, and Yellow Bullhead. <br> \n <br> \nPeople can have significant impacts on lakes and the fish populations they support. Harvest, lakeshore development, removal of shoreline vegetation, and introductions of invasive species can all adversely affect fish populations. Currently, no aquatic invasive species (AIS) have been identified in Upper Trelipe Lake. AIS are moved from infested to non-infested waters by anglers, boaters, and lake shore owners and can adversely impact lakes and fish populations. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access. If you suspect an infestation of an invasive species in this lake, save a specimen and report it to a local natural resource office. Additional information on all of these topics can be found on the DNR website (www.dnr.state.mn.us) or by contacting the Walker Area Fisheries office. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Upper Trelipe Lake is a 421-acre lake located near Longville, MN that has 4.16 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 69 feet.  There is a Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) public access on the southwest shore that may be reached from Cass County Road 7 and Beaver Drive NE.  The DNR has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different classes based on physical, chemical and other characteristics.  Upper Trelipe Lake is in Lake Class 23; lakes in this class are very deep, have a very low percentage of area less than 15 ft deep, are hard-water lakes, and are very clear. Other local waters in this class include Baby, Mule, and Ponto Lakes.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike are not abundant in Upper Trelipe Lake but a quality size structure exists with fish up to 35 inches being sampled.  The average length of northern pike sampled was 25.4 inches.  Largemouth bass were commonly sampled in this lake and fish up to 19 inches were found.  Fish in the 14-inch category comprised almost 40% of the largemouth sampled in 2011.  Walleye are very abundant in Upper Trelipe Lake, with an average fish size of 14.6 inches and a maximum size of 24 inches.  Bluegill abundance was lower than in most lakes in this class, however almost half of the bluegill sampled in 2011 were 6 inches or larger.    <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species that are available to anglers to catch are black crappie, pumpkinseed sunfish, rock bass, and yellow bullhead, and yellow perch.        <br> \n <br> \nPeople can have significant impacts on lakes and the fish populations they support.  Selective harvest by anglers (harvest of smaller to medium-sized fish) promotes balanced fish communities and sustainable fishing quality.  Removal of shoreline vegetation on private lake lots and mowing grass to the water's edge can reduce water quality, which in turn can adversely affect fish populations.  Similarly, removal of woody debris and aquatic plants from near-shore areas reduces critical habitat needed to support quality fish populations.   <br> \n <br> \nCurrently no aquatic invasive species (AIS) have been identified in Upper Trelipe Lake.  These species are moved from infested to non-infested waters by anglers, boaters, and lake-shore owners and can adversely impact lakes and fish populations.  To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat away before leaving the access.  If you suspect an infestation of an invasive species in this lake, save a specimen and report it to a local natural resource office.  Additional information on all of these topics can be found on the DNR website (www.dnr.state.mn.us/). <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Upper Trelipe Lake (DOW # 110105) is a 409-acre lake about seven miles east of Longville in Cass County.  There is a state-owned public access with concrete ramp on the west shore of the lake.  The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MNDNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different classes based on physical, chemical and other characteristics.   Upper Trelipe Lake is in Lake Class 23; waters in this class are generally clear, deep, hard-water lakes in which most of the lake area is greater than 15 feet deep.  Upper Trelipe Lake is managed primarily for walleye and secondarily for northern pike, black crappie, largemouth bass, and bluegill. Walleye abundance in the 2005 sampling in Upper Trelipe Lake was above average compared to other lakes in Lake Class 23.  Average length of sampled walleye was about 15 inches, and fish up to 24 inches were found.  There is natural reproduction of walleye Upper Trelipe Lake during most years.  However, it is inconclusive whether natural reproduction could sustain the current walleye population.  Abundance of northern pike in Upper Trelipe Lake is similar to other lakes of this type.  The average length of northern pike in the 2005 survey was 21 inches, however the largest individual sampled was 32 inches.  Other species present include bluegill, black crappie, bowfin (dogfish), brown bullhead, cisco (tullibee), hybrid sunfish, largemouth bass, pumpkinseed sunfish, rock bass, white sucker, yellow bullhead, and yellow perch.   Anglers can help maintain or improve the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for table fare, but encourages release of medium- to large-sized fish.  Releasing these fish can help maintain balance in the fish community in Upper Trelipe Lake and provide anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future.  Shoreline areas on the land and into the shallow water provide essential habitat for fish and wildlife that live in or near Minnesota's lakes.  Overdeveloped shorelines can't support the fish, wildlife, and clean water that are associated with natural undeveloped lakes. The combined effects of all lakeshore owners \"fixing up\" their property can destroy a lake's valuable natural shorelines.Shoreline habitat consists of aquatic plants, woody plants and natural lake bottom soils.Plants in the water and at the water's edge provide habitat, prevent erosion and absorb excess nutrients. Shrubs, trees, and woody debris such as fallen trees or limbs provide good habitat both above and below the water and should be left in place.  Natural lake bottom materials like silt or gravel are more ecologically productive than pure sand trucked in for a swimming beach.  A tidy lawn and a sandy beach make great spots for sunbathing and swimming but do little to provide habitat for fish and wildlife. By leaving a buffer strip of natural vegetation along the shoreline, property owners can reduce erosion, help maintain water quality, and provide habitat and travel corridors for wildlife.Only if more lakeshore owners manage their shoreline in a natural condition can fish and wildlife populations on Minnesota lakes remain healthy and abundant.  More specific information on protecting or restoring shorelines and watersheds is available through the local DNR Fisheries office.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Upper Trelipe Lake (DOW# 11-0105) is a 421 acre lake with 143 littoral acres, 4.16 miles of shoreline, and a maximum depth of 69 feet located 12 miles east of Longville, MN. The DNR has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different classes based on physical, chemical and other characteristics. Upper Trelipe Lake is in Lake Class 23; lakes in this class are generally deep and very clear lakes. Other area lakes in this class include Jack, Ponto, Mule, Stony, and Baby. A DNR owned public access is located on the north western shore.  The lake is primarily managed for Largemouth Bass, Walleye and Black Crappie and secondarily for Northern Pike, Bluegill and Yellow Perch.  <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass are moderately abundant ranging in length from 8 to 17 inches with an average length of 13 inches. Smallmouth Bass were sampled for the first time with fish up to 18 inches long present.  Walleye are moderately abundant although the 2019 sample did not meet the management goal of six fish per gillnet despite even-year fingerling stocking since the early 2000's. Walleye ranged in length from 9 to nearly 20 inches, with an average length of 15 inches. Black crappie abundance is moderate and has been increasing since the 2011 survey. Crappie ranged in length from 4 to 13 inches with an average length of 10 inches. Bluegill abundance is low but size quality is high with fish up to 9 inches present, and 48 percent of the spring trap net sample measuring 7 inches or longer. Northern Pike are also moderately abundant with good sizes present; pike ranged in length from 18 to 39 inches with an average length of 25 inches. Tullibee (Cisco) are also present with fish up to 16 inches long sampled; these fish are an indicator of good water quality and provide high-quality forage for predators such as Northern Pike. <br> \n <br> \nOther fish sampled in survey were Rock Bass, Pumpkinseed Sunfish, Hybrid Sunfish, Bowfin (Dogfish) and Yellow Bullhead.   <br> \n <br> \nPeople can have significant impacts on lakes and the fish populations they support. Harvest, lakeshore development, removal of shoreline vegetation, and introductions of invasive species can all adversely affect fish populations. Currently, no aquatic invasive species (AIS) have been identified in Upper Trelipe Lake. AIS are moved from infested to non-infested waters by anglers, boaters, and lake shore owners and can adversely impact lakes and fish populations. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access. If you suspect an infestation of an invasive species in this lake, save a specimen and report it to a local natural resource office. Additional information on all of these topics can be found on the DNR website (www.dnr.state.mn.us) or by contacting the Walker Area Fisheries office. <br> \n</p>",
