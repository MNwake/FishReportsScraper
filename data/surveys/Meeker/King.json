The bluegill population is declining.  In 1977, bluegills were sampled at 56.25/trapnet lift; in 1982 they were taken at 20.2/trapnet lift, and in this survey went to 9.5/trapnet lift.  Average size of the bluegills sampled this year were 6-7\" in length.  Crappie numbers have increased significantly.  In 1977, no crappies were sampled.  In 1982 survey, black crappies were present at 2.2/trapnet lift.  In the 1984 survey, black crappies were present at 32.75/trapnet lift and white crappies at 5.75/trapnet lift.  Fishing for bluegills and crappies this past year was good.  Though not evident from data collected in this survey, populations of walleye and largemouth bass have also contributed to the fishery.  Reports of walleyes being taken up to 4 lbs. and largemouth bass up to 3.5 pounds were noted.  There are few carp but a large population of bullheads present, most of which are over 7 inches in length.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A standard survey was conducted at Arvilla Lake beginning on 7/09/18 to monitor the lake's fish population and evaluate the Walleye fry stocking regime.  Arvilla is a class 43 lake and net catches were compared to similar lakes around the state.  The 2014 lake management plan (LMP) lists Black Crappie, Northern Pike, and Walleye as primary management species, while Bluegill and White Crappie were ranked as secondary species at Arvilla.  In 2018, a total of 16 species, plus Hybrid Sunfish, were sampled in the gill nets (GN) and trap nets (TN).  The dissolved oxygen concentration fell below 2.0 mg/l at 9 feet.  The maximum depth recorded for this survey was 10.0 feet.  Water clarity was poor with a secchi disk reading of 1.8 feet, due to an algae bloom.  Arvilla has a long history of experiencing partial winterkills with the latest events occurring in 2001, 2008, 2010, 2011, 2013, and 2014.  In the past, development of a stable fishery was not possible due to winterkill frequency but this could be changing as winterkill frequency and winter severity diminish.  Fish presently have had four years to grow in the absence of winterkill and anecdotal reports indicated good fishing for Bluegill, Black Crappie, Northern Pike, and Yellow Perch in that timespan.  Fish that survived the 2014 partial winterkill likely grew fast and reached a large size quickly due to reduced competition.  Frequency and severity of winterkill can greatly influence fish abundance at Arvilla Lake.  Only Walleye were stocked following the 2014 winterkill as other species had the opportunity to repopulate via immigration from the river or from spawning events from surviving broodstock.  Curlyleaf pondweed, a non-native invasive aquatic plant, can be abundant (forming surface mats) in May and June at Arvilla Lake.  Anglers should be extra careful to drain all the water from their boats when leaving Arvilla Lake because upstream Washington Lake has been designated as being infested with the zebra mussel, an aquatic invasive species. <br> \n <br> \nGill nets (GN) sampled low numbers of Walleye (8) for a catch rate of 1.3/net, which was below the normal range for this lake type.  The 2014 LMP's long range goal for Walleye (>2.3/GN) was not met.  The 2009 catch rate was moderate (6.0/net), and was the only historical catch rate that was within the lake's normal range.  Catch rates from 1977 to 2018 (n=8), under various stocking regimes, were mostly low ranging from 0.0 to 6.0/net with an average of 1.3.  In 2018, gill netted Walleye were 16.1 to 22.2 inches long with an average of 19.0.  Trap nets sampled Walleye up to 26.3 inches in length.  Gill netted Walleye were estimated to be age-2 to age-5 with four year classes present.  All year classes were considered to be weak.  Walleye growth was fast.  In 2018, non-stocked year classes (2015) accounted for 38% of the GN aged walleye.  The contribution from natural reproduction during fry stocked years (2013, 2014, and 2016) was unknown.  Connections to Washington Creek, the North Fork of the Crow River, and winterkill confounds Walleye stocking evaluation efforts.  The low catch rate in 2018 indicated that there was not a significant contribution to Arvilla's Walleye population from Washington Creek.  The latest fry stocking regime (138,000 every other year) began in 2007.  The regime was immediately restarted following winterkills in 2010 and 2014.  Gill net catch rates from 2009 to 2018 (n=2) ranged from 1.3 to 6.0/net with an average of 3.7, indicating an inexpensive and moderately successful stocking strategy.  The previous stocking regime (69,000 fry two of three years, initiated in 1998) produced a catch rate of 1.8/net in 2004.   <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled high numbers of Northern Pike (81) for a catch rate of 13.5/net, which was above the lake's normal range and the second highest ever recorded at Arvilla.  The 2014 LMP's long range goal (> 1.1/net) was met.  The 2009 catch rate was 6.0/net.  Gill net catch rates from 1977 to 2018 (n=8) were highly variable, ranging from 0.0 to 16.0/net with an average of 6.4.  Historically, Northern Pike recruitment would be classified as variable likely due to the lakes winterkill frequency.  In 2018, gill netted Northern Pike were 16.3 to 34.7 inches long with an average of 23.2.  Trap nets sampled Northern Pike up to 38.0 inches in length, indicating that memorable sized fish were present.  Northern Pike have never been stocked into Arvilla Lake and natural reproduction has provided a sufficient fishery for many years.  Northern Pike were not aged, but size distribution data indicated that multiple year classes were present.  New Northern Pike zone regulations went into effect in the spring of 2018.  Arvilla is in the north central regulation zone which has a 10 fish bag limit, where all fish from 22 to 26 inches in length have to be immediately released and only two harvested fish could be over 26 inches long.  Spearers are allowed to have one fish in the protected slot limit.  The regulation was designed to improve the size structure in lakes across the state with \"stunted\" Northern Pike populations.  Arvilla was occasionally clear enough for spearing in recent years but most years it was too turbid.  High numbers of Northern Pike (>6/GN) could be having negative effects on Walleye stocking efforts at Arvilla Lake.   <br> \n <br> \nTrap nets sampled moderate numbers (102) of Black Crappie in 2018 for a catch rate of 11.3/net, which was within the normal range for this type of lake.  The 2014 LMP's long range goal (>1.2/TN) was met.  The 2009 TN catch rate was similar at 13.1/net.  Catch rates from 1977 to 2018 (n=8) were variable, ranging from 0.0 to 37.8/net with an average of 13.5.  In 2018, trap netted Black Crappie were 2.4 to 11.8 inches long with an average of 8.2.  Approximately 25% of the TN catch was 10 inches or longer, indicating some quality fish are available.  Gill nets sampled moderate numbers of Black Crappie (44) for a catch rate of 7.3/net, which was within the normal range for this type of lake.  The 2009 GN catch rate was 23.5/net.  Catch rates from 1977 to 2018 (n=8) were variable, ranging from 0.0 to 23.5/net with an average of 6.7.  In 2018, gill netted Black Crappie were 4.1 to 9.9 inches long with an average of 6.3.  Black Crappie were not aged, but size distributions indicated that multiple year classes were present.  Higher catch rates for Black Crappie during the last two surveys could be having negative impacts on Walleye fry stocking efforts at Arvilla Lake.   <br> \n <br> \nTrap nets and gill nets failed to sample any White Crappie in 2018.  The 2014 LMP's long range goal for White Crappie (maintain presence) was not met.  The 2009 TN catch rate was 6.2/net.  Historical TN catch rates from 1977 to 2018 (n=8) ranged from 0.0 to 7.2/net with an average of 2.4.  The 2009 GN catch rate was 8.0/net.  Historic GN catch rates from 1977 to 2018 (n=8) ranged from 0.0 to 8.0/net with an average of 1.2.  Historic catch data indicated that White Crappie were rarely abundant at Arvilla Lake.      <br> \n <br> \nTrap nets sampled high numbers of Bluegill (251) for a catch rate of 27.9/net, which was above the lake's normal range and the second highest ever recorded at Arvilla.  The 2014 LMP's long range goal for Bluegill (maintain presence) was met.  The 2009 catch rate was 12.0/net.  Catch rates from 1977 to 2018 (n=8) were variable, ranging from 0.0 to 56.3/net, with an average of 18.2.  In 2018, trap netted Bluegill were 3.4 to 8.5 inches long with an average of 6.1.  Approximately 14% of the trap net catch was 7 inches or longer, indicating a decent population.  Gill nets sampled high numbers (162) of Bluegill for a catch rate of 27.0/net with fish averaging 6.0 inches in length.  Bluegill were not aged, but size distributions indicated that multiple year classes were present.   <br> \n <br> \nSpring night-time electrofishing, the preferred method for measuring Largemouth Bass abundance, was not conducted in 2018.  Gill nets sampled 1 Largemouth Bass for a catch rate of 0.2/net and that fish was 15.0 inches long.  Trap nets sampled 2 Largemouth Bass for a catch rate of 0.2/net.  Trap netted Largemouth Bass were 15.0 to 15.1 inches in length.  Net catches indicated that Largemouth Bass were present, but not overly abundant.      <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled low numbers of Channel Catfish (5) for a catch rate of 0.8/net.  The 2009 catch rate was also low (0.8/net).  Historic catch rates from 1977 to 2018 (n=8) were all low, ranging from 0.0 to 2.4/net with an average of 0.5.  In 2018, GN Channel Catfish were 10.2 to 23.3 inches long with an average of 15.6.  Trap nets sampled 4 Channel Catfish that were 17.4 to 21.4 inches long.  Channel Catfish were not aged.  These fish likely immigrated into Arvilla via Washington Creek and came from the North Fork of the Crow River.    <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled low numbers of Yellow Perch (2) for a catch rate of 0.3/net, which was below the lake's normal range.  The 2009 catch rate was similar (0.2/net).  Catch rates from 1977 to 2018 (n=8) were mostly low, ranging from 0.0 to 10.2/net with an average of 1.6.  Yellow Perch have not been sampled in high numbers since 1984 (10.5/net).  The one measured Yellow Perch, from the GN, was 6.1 inches long.  Trap nets also captured low numbers (5) of Yellow Perch, ranging in length from 5.1 to 9.0 inches. Yellow Perch were not aged.   <br> \n <br> \nTrap nets sampled high numbers of Common Carp (45) for a catch rate of 5.0/net, which was within the normal range for this type of lake.  Historic catch rates (n=8) from 1977 to 2018 were variable, ranging from 0.0 to 24.8/net with an average of 5.5.  Trap netted Common Carp were 15.0 to 33.1 inches long with an average of 21.4.  Gill nets sampled low numbers of Common Carp (2) for a catch rate of 0.3/net, which was below the lake's normal range.  Historic GN catch rates (n=8) were variable, ranging from 0.0 to 6.2/net with an average of 2.9.  Gill netted Common Carp were 25.2 to 32.7 inches long with an average of 28.9.  Size distribution data indicated that multiple year classes were present.  High numbers of Common Carp over the last 60 years have likely had significant negative impacts on submergent plant abundance and water quality in Arvilla Lake.  Common Carp are difficult to control due to the highly connected watershed along Washington Creek and the North Fork of the Crow River.     <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled moderate numbers (192) of Black Bullhead for a catch rate of 32.0/net, which was just above the lake's normal range.  The 2009 catch rate was 6.3/net.  Historic GN catch rates from 1977 to 2018 (n=8) were mostly high, ranging from 6.3 to 907.0/net with an average of 245.3, as might be expected in a lake that winterkills frequently.  Gill netted Black Bullhead were 6.0 to 12.4 inches long with an average of 9.9.  Trap nets sampled low numbers (29) of Black Bullhead for a catch rate of 3.2/net which was below the lake's normal range.  Trap netted Black Bullhead were 6.1 to 11.6 inches long with an average of 10.2.   <br> \n <br> \nAdditional species sampled in the standard gear included; Bigmouth Buffalo, Bowfin, Brown Bullhead, Golden Shiner, Shorthead Redhorse, White Sucker, and Yellow Bullhead.  Presence of Bigmouth Buffalo and Shorthead Redhorse indicated that there was a good connection between Arvilla and the North Fork of the Crow River.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A population assessemnt (gill and trap netting) was conducted at Arville Lake to monitor the fish population.  Arville experiences occasional winterkills, with the last partial kill taking place during the 2000-2001 winter.  Anglers can expect highly variable catch rates from year-to-year on Arville, depending on the severity of the last winterkill. Moderate numbers of northern pike were sampled in 2004, with the 2001 year class dominating the catch.  In 1989, 0 pike were sampled displaying the highly variable catch rates that can occurr following a winterkill.  Pike were 16.7-29.1 inches long averaging 22.2 inches.  Moderate numbers of black crappie were sampled, ranging in size from 4.1-9.5 inches.  Approximately 35% of the catch was 8 inches or greater.  Walleye were sampled in low numbers, with fish ranging from 13.4-19.2 inches.  Walleye fry are stocked on a two-out-of-three year rotation at Arville Lake.  All of the walleye that were aged corresponded to stocked years and were probably the result of the fry stocking.  Connections, via Washington Creek, to Washington Lake and the North Fork of the Crow River complicate stocking evaluations.  Moderate numbers of bluegill were sampled, but average size was small.  Bluegill averaged 5.7 inches.  Approximately 50% of the catch was 6 inches or greater, but only 2% of the sample reached 7 inches.  Black bullhead were abundant and averaged 5.9 inches.  Black bullhead have dominated net catches since sampling began in 1977.  Moderate numbers of carp were netted, averging 16.5 inches.  A variety of species (shorthead redhorse, greater redhorse, golden redhorse, channel catfish, white sucker and bigmouth buffalo) commonly found in rivers may suprise anglers fishing Arville.  The Washington Creek connection to the North Fork of the Crow River allows fish to migrate into and out of Arville Lake.       </p>",

Arville sustained a winterkill during 1988-1989, and was open to liberalized fishing.  Low water levels may have also contributed to low catch rates by reducing natural reproduction habitat, and by preventing migration into or out of Arville via Washington Creek.  I believe the major reason for low fish population is the winterkill in 1988-1989.  We did not sample enough fish of major species during the assessment, to determine growth rates or age-class strength.</p>",

Fish populations depend largely on what fish migrate upstream from the North Fork of the Crow River in spring or on fish stocked.  At present, there are good numbers of bluegill, carp, and bullheads.  Sunfish, largemouth bass, and crappies have been stocked periodically since 1941.  Lake Arville should be managed as a regular winter-kill type lake.  Stock periodically with gamefish especially bluegills after winter-kill and periods of low flow.  A watershed management approach is recommended to reduce agricultural run-off and silt load from Washington Creek thereby improving spawning conditions for gamefish. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A population assessment was conducted at Arvilla Lake in 2009 to evaluate the lake's fish population.  A total of 16 different species of fish were sampled, plus hybrid sunfish.  Arvilla has a history of partial winterkills, with the latest documented kill occurring during the 2007-2008 winter.  The lake was not stratified on 6/29/09 and dissolved oxygen was 7 mg/l from top to bottom.  Clarity was poor, due to an algae bloom, with a secchi disk reading of 1.5 feet.  <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled 36 northern pike for a catch rate of 6.0/net, which was within the normal range for this type of lake.  The 2004 catch rate was almost identicle at 6.4/net.  Northern pike were 10.2 to 30.7 inches long averaging 20.5 inches.  Trap nets sampled fish up to 35.1 inches in length.  Northern pike were 1 to 5 years old with 5 year-classes present.  Growth was moderate. <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled 36 walleye for a catch rate of 6.0/net, which was within the normal range for this type of lake and the highest ever measured at Arvilla.  The 2004 catch rate was 1.8/net.  Walleye were 9.5 to 26.2 inches long averaging 14.7 inches.  Trap nets sampled walleye up to 27.6 inches in length.  Walleye were 2 to 12 years old with 6 year-classes present.  Approximately 78% of the gill net catch was from the strong 2007 year-class.  Growth was fast.  The old stocking regime (500 fry/littoral acre two-out-of-three years), which started in 1998 and ended in 2005, produced a unsatisfactory catch rate in 2004.  A new regime (1,000 fry/littoral acre every-other-year) was initiated in 2007 and this first evaluation indicated favorable results.       <br> \n <br> \nSpring night-time electrofishing sampled 13 largemouth bass for a catch rate of 13.5/hr.  This was the first time that electrofishing was used on Arvilla to sample largemouth bass.  Largemouth bass were 4.6 to 13.5 inches long averaging 8.9 inches.  Largemouth bass were 1 to 5 years old with 4 year-classes present.  Growth was moderate.  Dead largemouth bass were found on shore following the 2007-2008 winter.    <br> \n <br> \nGill nets sampled 5 channel catfish for a catch rate of 0.8/net.  The catch rate in 2004 was 2.4/net.  Gill netted fish were 20.2 to 23.5 inches long averaging 21.4 inches.  Several dead channel catfish were found on the shoreline following the 2007-2008 winter.  Channel catfish could be partially responsible for the apparent drop in black bullhead numbers at Arvilla.  <br> \n <br> \nTrap nets sampled 118 black crappie for a catch rate of 13.1/net, which was within the normal range for this type of lake.  The 2004 catch rate was 10.4/net.  The 2009 gill net catch was 23.5/net, which was well above the normal range and the highest ever observed at Arvilla.  The 2004 gill net catch was 7.6/net.  Gill netted black crappie were 3.8 to 10.8 inches long averaging 7.1 inches.  Trap nets sampled fish up 13.98 inches in length.  Black crappie were 1 to 8 years old with 8 year-classes present.  Growth was moderate. <br> \n <br> \nTrap nets sampled 56 white crappie for a catch rate of 6.2/net which was above the normal range for this type of lake.  Only 1 white crappie was sampled during the 2004 population assessment.  Gill nets sampled 48 white crappie in 2009, for a catch rate of 8.0/net which was within the normal range and the highest ever recorded at Arvilla.  Gill netted white crappie averaged 5.2 inches in length.  Trap netted white crappie were 4.5 to 13.9 inches long averaging 8.1 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nTrap nets sampled 108 bluegill for a catch rate of 12.0/net, which was within the normal ranged for this type of lake.  The 2004 catch rate was 19.9/net.  Bluegill were 2.8 to 7.95 inches long averaging 5.8 inches.  Approximately 17% of the trap net catch was 7 inches or longer.  Bluegill were 1 to 7 years old with 7 year-classes present.  Growth was moderate.  Dead bluegill were found on shore following the 2007-2008 winter. <br> \n</p>",
