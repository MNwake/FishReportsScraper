                "narrative": "<p>Lake Louisa is a 194 acre lake located along the border of Wright and Stearns Counties, 2 miles northwest of South Haven.  No public access is located on  Lake Louisa, but the lake can be accessed through Marie Lake.  In 2005, all the lakes along the Clearwater River were sampled including: Louisa, Marie, Caroline, Augusta, Clearwater, and Grass lakes.  Anglers can expect good fishing for largemouth bass, northern pike and sunfish based on the survey results.Largemouth bass electrofishing on Lake Louisa was combined with Marie Lake.  A total of 95 largemouth bass were sampled in 1.05 hours of electrofishing.  Largemouth bass ranged in length from 3.5 to 20.5 inches with a mean length of 12.3 inches.  Largemouth bass catch was 90.3 fish/hour, over one and a half times the mean catch rate for Montrose area lakes (52/hr).  The northern pike gill net catch rate (8.3 fish/net) significantly increased over that of 1997 (2.8 fish/net).  Fifty northern pike were sampled which ranged in length from 13.6 to 36.4 inches.  Mean length and weight of northern pike were 25.5 inches and 4.1 pounds.  Few lakes in the area could be considered this good.  Two walleye were sampled but the low catch of walleye is not surprising since Lake Louisa is not stocked.  The walleye in the lake have probably migrated from upstream lakes.Channel catfish were sampled in Lake Louisa for the first time.  These fish probably migrated downstream from Betsy Lake which was first stocked with channel catfish in 1983.The bluegill trap net catch rate (26.3 fish/net) was similar to that observed in 1997 (26.2 fish/net).  Bluegill ranged in length from 4.4 inches to 8.5 inches with a mean length of 7.0 inches, which was above average.The black crappie trap net catch rate (3.6 fish/net) appeared lower than that of 1997 (12.8 fish/net).  A total of 25 black crappie were sampled by trap net. Fish ranged in length from 3.8 to 10.2 inches with a mean length of 8.4 inches, considered average.Other fish species sampled during the trap net survey included bowfin, black and yellow bullhead, hybrid and pumpkinseed sunfish and white sucker.</p>",

Ten sampling sites were evenly spaced around the shoreline and each site was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining. <br> \n <br> \nNear shore sampling captured 15 species of fish, including one species that is intolerant of poor water quality or habitat disturbance (Iowa Darter). The near shore fish survey data were combined with gill net and trap net data from a June 2019 standard survey to describe the fish community and provide a fish based Index of Biotic Integrity (FIBI) score based on expectations for similar lakes. A FIBI uses fish community data as a measurement of lake health. The FIBI score for Louisa Lake was 47, which was above the impairment threshold (FIBI > 45) using Tool 2. <br> \n <br> \nThis survey is contributing to a watershed assessment process in coordination with the MN Pollution Control Agency. Louisa Lake is located in the Mississippi River - St. Cloud Watershed. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Louisa is a 194 acre lake located along the border of Wright and Stearns Counties, two miles northwest of South Haven.  No public access is located on Lake Louisa, but the lake can be accessed through Lake Marie which has a public access within Fairhaven Mill County Park.  The Lake Louisa watershed is 53,918 acres with land use consisting of 52% agriculture, 23% hay/pasture, 6% marsh/open water, 6% residential, and 13% forest. Water clarity ranges from 3 to 11 feet in mid to late summer.  Adequate dissolved oxygen was sampled to a depth of 14 feet.  Lake Louisa also has a moderate diversity of aquatic plants growing in sparse beds around the lake and curly-leaf pondweed was abundant in mid-June and covered 13% of lake surface area. <br> \n <br> \nBased on survey results, anglers can expect good fishing for Largemouth Bass, Northern Pike and sunfish. <br> \n <br> \nResults of Largemouth Bass electrofishing on Lake Louisa were combined with Lake Marie.  A total of 122 Largemouth Bass were sampled in 1.5 hours of electrofishing.  This was over twice the daytime average catch for Montrose Area lakes.  Largemouth Bass ranged in length from 8.1 to 19.7 inches with an average length and weight of 13.9 inches and 1.7 pounds. <br> \n <br> \nThe catch of Northern Pike was similar to 2005 and within the range expected values for lakes similar to Louisa.  Forty one Northern Pike were sampled, ranging in length from 19.1 to 36.7 inches.  The average size of Northern Pike was 24.5 inches and 3.5 pounds.  Forty nine percent of Northern Pike sampled were longer than 24 inches Few lakes in the area could be considered this good for pike fishing opportunities. <br> \n <br> \nLake Louisa is not stocked with Walleye, but several were sampled during the survey.  It is likely that fish migrate from upstream portions of the Clearwater River where they reproduce naturally.  Walleye ranged in length from 17.5 to 30.0 inches with an average size of 22.6 inches and 3.9 pounds.  Based on the observed catch rates, anglers have a chance to catch an incidental Walleye in Lake Louisa. <br> \n <br> \nThe Bluegill trap net catch was lower than observed in 2005 but remained within the expected range for lakes similar to Louisa.  Bluegill ranged in length from 2.1 to 9.1 inches and averaged 6.8 inches and 0.3 pounds.  Anglers can experience good fishing for Bluegill in Lake Louisa as 55% of the fish sampled were greater than 7 inches in length. <br> \n <br> \nOnly 16 Black Crappie were sampled in 2014.  This catch is the lowest observed since surveys were initiated in 1958.  Black Crappie ranged in length from 7.1 to 12.0 inches with a mean length and weight of 9.1 inches and 0.4 pounds.  Black Crappies are known to have highly variable recruitment and crappie populations tend to go through \"boom and bust\" cycles dependent largely on environmental conditions at the time of spawning.  Once a large year class is established, they may dominate the fishery for several years.  Large numbers of adult spawning crappie were observed in early May while electrofishing for Largemouth Bass, which should ensure that Black Crappie numbers will improve in the years to come. <br> \n <br> \nChannel Catfish were again sampled in low numbers with little change from 2005 when they were first sampled in Lake Louisa.  Channel Catfish ranged in length from 18.9 to 21.7 inches with an average size of 20.2 inches and 3.0 pounds.  These fish probably migrated downstream from Betsy Lake, which was stocked with Channel Catfish in 1983. <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species sampled during the survey included: Black Bullhead, Bowfin (Dogfish), Hybrid Sunfish, Pumpkinseed, White Sucker, and Yellow Bullhead.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of nearshore fish species in Louisa Lake was conducted beginning on July 20th, 2020 by Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program Staff. Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at 10 sampling stations, but three stations were sampled from the boat due to site conditions. Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample six stations, and site conditions prevented the use of seines at four stations. Nearshore sampling captured 16 species of fish including one species that is intolerant of disturbance (Banded Killifish and Iowa Darter) and two that are tolerant of disturbance (Common Carp and Green Sunfish). <br> \n <br> \nA concurrent summer trap net survey was conducted July 20th-22nd, 2020 by IBI Program Staff. Nine trap nets were set along the shoreline and in shallow offshore locations that encompassed multiple habitat types.  Bluegill and Black Crappie comprised a majority of the trap net catch by number, and White Sucker and Northern Pike comprised a majority of the catch by biomass. The number of Bluegill and Black Crappie sampled per net was above the between the 25th and 50th quartile for similar Lake Class 24 lakes. The number of Common Carp sampled per net was below the 25% quartile for Lake Class 24 lakes. The mean weight of White Suckers caught were all above the 75% quartile for Lake Class 24 lakes. <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore and trap net data were combined with gill net data from a June 2019 survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based IBI (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment. In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g. Banded Killifish, Iowa Darters, Mimic Shiners), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g. Green Sunfish, Fathead Minnows, and Common Carp). The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.  <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey provides evidence that the fish community in Louisa Lake is adversely impacted by stressors as indicated by an FIBI score below the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes. Data from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Mississippi River - St. Cloud Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.</p>",

Their abundance is similar to 1981 and remains several times the local average. White Crappie abundance continues to increase to 7 times the local average. Common Carp abundance has fallen below the range of expected values for area lakes. Fewer immature fish were sampled this year than in 1981. Northern Pike abundance also dropped below the range of expected values. Only large fish were caught. Walleye abundance is similar to 1981 and remains at the low end of the expected range. \n\nLargemouth Bass abundance is lower than 1981 but remains at the local average. Green Sunfish abundance remains low. Pumpkinseed abundance remains at the local average. Bluegill abundance remains well above the range of expected values for area lakes. Average size has increased about one inch since 1981 and a high percentage of Bluegill were at least 7.0 inches. There were increases in total length and the number of year classes. Gamefish populations continue to be dominated by Largemouth Bass, crappies, and sunfish and the lake continues to recover from past winterkill and waste water problems. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Louisa is a 194-acre lake located along the border of Wright and Stearns counties, two miles northwest of South Haven. There is no public access on Lake Louisa, but the lake can be accessed through Lake Marie. The Lake Louisa watershed is 53,918 acres with land use consisting of 62% agriculture, 12% hay/pasture, 10% marsh/open water, 10% forest and 6% residential. Water clarity was eight feet in mid-June and MPCA data shows water clarity averages six feet during the summer. Adequate dissolved oxygen was sampled to a depth of 14 feet. Lake Louisa also has a moderate diversity of aquatic plants growing in sparse beds around the lake with floating leaf and emergent vegetation covering about 38 percent of the lakes surface.  <br> \n <br> \nThis was the first survey since 2014, and based on survey results, anglers can expect good fishing for Largemouth Bass, Northern Pike and panfish. <br> \n <br> \nA total of 119 Largemouth Bass were sampled in 1.4 hours of electrofishing. This was almost twice the daytime average catch for Sauk Rapids Area lakes. Largemouth Bass ranged in length from 6 to 21 inches with an average length of 14 inches, and 37% of the catchable sized bass were longer than 15 inches in length. <br> \n <br> \nThe catch of Northern Pike was similar to 2014 and within the range expected values for lakes similar to Louisa. Forty one Northern Pike were sampled, ranging in length from 17 to 38 inches. The average size of Northern Pike was 27 inches and 5 pounds. Fifty-six percent of Northern Pike sampled were longer than 26 inches and 20 percent were longer than 30 inches in length. Few lakes in the area could be considered this good for pike fishing opportunities. <br> \n <br> \nThe Walleye catch was low, which is not surprising since Walleye had not been stocked since 1986. However, in 2019 the Lake Association purchased and stocked 200,000 Walleye fry. It is likely that fish migrate from upstream portions of the Clearwater River where they reproduce naturally. Walleye ranged in length from 16 to 28 inches with an average size of 21 inches and 3 pounds. Based on the observed catch rates, anglers have a chance to catch an incidental Walleye in Lake Louisa. <br> \n <br> \nThe Bluegill trap net catch was higher than observed in 2014 and within the expected range for lakes similar to Louisa. Bluegill ranged in length from 3 to 9 inches and averaged 6.4 inches. Anglers can experience good fishing for small Bluegill in Lake Louisa however only 3% of the fish sampled were greater than 8 inches in length. <br> \n <br> \nThe Black Crappie catch increased from the previous survey in 2014 and was the highest catch reported since 1997. Black Crappie ranged in length from 4 to 10 inches with an average length of 8 inches. Black Crappies are known to have highly variable recruitment and crappie populations tend to go through \"boom and bust\" cycles dependent largely on environmental conditions at the time of spawning. Once a large year class is established, they may dominate the fishery for several years.   <br> \n <br> \nChannel Catfish were again sampled in low numbers with little change from 2005 when they were first sampled in Lake Louisa. These fish probably migrated downstream from Betty Lake, which was stocked with Channel Catfish in 1983. <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species sampled during the survey included: Black Bullhead, Bowfin (Dogfish), Golden Shiner, Hybrid Sunfish, Pumpkinseed, and White Sucker, and Yellow Bullhead. <br> \n</p>",

The status of Northern Pike has improved slightly to 2.5/gill net or about half the area average. Walleye were not captured and Yellow Perch remain at a low level (2.0/gill net). Despite the removal of 20,000 pounds of Black Bullhead during fall 1982 and spring 1983 from Louisa and Marie Lakes, bullhead catches equal 30/trap net, similar to 1982.</p>",

This was a significant decrease from the last survey.  Ages 2, 4, and 5 were present.  Growth rates for female Northern Pike were average.  Walleye were present in low numbers (0.6/gill net).  Two 14-inch, age 3 males were caught, and one 17-inch, age 5 female.  Walleye were not caught in the 1985 survey.  Yellow Perch significantly increased by a factor of 48 from low numbers in 1985 (0.8/gill net) to high numbers in 1991 (39.4/gill net).  Lengths ranged from 4.5-9.9 inches, with an average of 5.5-5.9 inches.  The White Sucker population was high (6.0/gill net) and average size was large (2.4 pounds).  \n\nImportant species in trap nets were: Black Bullhead, Yellow Bullhead, Common Carp, several panfish species, and Largemouth Bass.  Both bullhead species had average numbers and size.  Carp numbers were average.  Pumpkinseed, Bluegill (136/trap net), and Black Crappie (42.3/trap net) all had high catch rates similar to historic catches.  The average size of Bluegill was within the range of expected values for likes similar to Louisa, but Pumpkinseed and Black Crappie average sizes were small.  Largemouth Bass catch rates from spring electrofishing were low (4.0 per hour).  Of catchable size Largemouth Bass (>8 inches), 50% were over 12 inches and the average length was 12.0-12.9 inches.\n</p>",

Black Bullhead, taken at a rate of 25.7/trap net (similar to recent years) also remain very abundant. Common Carp were captured at a much lower rate (1.8/trap net) than in the 1984 assessment (23.0). However, this is primarily due to the trap shyness of the older fish. \n\nThe Common Carp population remains extremely high. The Northern Pike population remains consistent at 3.8/gill net, higher than the catch rate of 1983, but still lower than the local average. Age classes 2-6 were represented in the catch. Only one Walleye was captured and Yellow Perch numbers remain very low at 0.8/gill net. Pumpkinseed, Largemouth Bass, Black Bullhead, and Brown Bullhead numbers remain near local averages.\n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Louisa Lake is a 179 acre lake located four miles northeast of Annandale.  The lake is part of the Clearwater River system, has 4.1 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 44 feet.  During early June 1997, there was adequate dissolved oxygen for fish to a depth of 13 feet.  The lakeshore is developed with 81 homes and cabins.  Twenty-five aquatic plant species were identified in the 1997 survey.  Public access to the lake is available via a navigable channel from Lake Marie.Black Crappie, Bluegill, Largemouth Bass, Northern Pike, Walleye, and Yellow Perch are all present in the lake.  In a lake survey conducted in the summer of 1997, netting revealed the following information about the fish population.Northern Pike catch rate in gill nets was 2.8/net, which was in the expected range for lakes similar to Louisa.  This catch rate was higher than the 1991 survey catch of 1.2/gill net.  The average Northern Pike weighed 4.5 pounds and was 26.7 inches long, which was larger than expected for the lakes similar to Louisa.  Pike growth was above average compared to other populations in the state.  The gill net catch of Walleye (1.0/gill net) was lower than expected for this lake type.  Walleye averaged 2.0 pounds and 17.4 inches long, which is within the expected range for similar lakes.  Growth rates were average compared to other populations in the state.  The Yellow Perch gill net catch was 16.4/gill net, within the expected range, but lower than the 1991 rate of 39.4/gill net.  The average size was smaller than average at 0.1 pounds and 5.9 inches long.  Growth rates were average.The Trap net catch of Black Crappie (12.8/net) was within the expected range for similar lakes, but was lower than in previous surveys.  The average size crappie stayed constant at 0.2 pounds and 7.4 inches.  Growth rates were below the statewide average with a typical Black Crappie reaching 8 inches long at age 6.  Bluegill catch rate (26.2/trap net) also was lower than in previous surveys, but was still in the expected range.  Bluegill averaged 5.5 inches long.  Reproduction was good and growth rates were above normal, with a typical Bluegill reaching 6 inches at age 3.Largemouth Bass are difficult to sample in trap nets; however, the Largemouth Bass population is good throughout the Clearwater Lakes.  Reproduction was good and young Largemouth Bass were common in shoreline seine hauls.</p>",
