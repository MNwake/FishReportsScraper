                "narrative": "<p>Badger Lake is a 272 acre lake with a maximum depth of 19 feet.  Most of the lake is shallower than five feet.  It was a regular winterkill lake before aeration was begun in early 1990.  If continued aeration is successful, it will greatly affect the fish cummunity in the future.The lake was initially surveyed in 1989.  Lack of depth precludes setting more than two gillnets in a survey or fish population assessment.  Consequently, gillnet catch fluctuations must be regarded with skepticism because true changes in population abundance are difficult to judge with only two nets.  Nevertheless, important information about species composition, length frequencies, age composition, and growth rates can still be gleaned from gillnet-caught fish.Northern pike abundance appears to have increased (not statistically significant) since the pre-aeration survey in 1989.  The gill net catch increased from 4.5/GN in '89 to 16.5/GN in '92 and is presently higher than the third quartile for class 39 lakes.  The average growth rate is considered to be faster than normal.  The sample consisted of 75% age three fish with the remainder age four or younger.  Average weight of pike sampled has increased during the past three years from 1.2 lb. to 1.6 lb.  Than mean size change is also reflected in length frequencies.  The current PSD is 40.  In 1989, however, no quality length fish (>= 21 in.) were captured.  Northern pike have not been stocked in Badger Lake since 1952.  Spring spawning migration through J.D. #73 accounts for population replenishment following winterkill.  Pike were removed (\"rescued\" for stocking elsewhere) almost annually from 1956 through the early eighties due to imminent winterkill.On carp was caught during the 1992 test-netting, none were captured in 1989.  Carp are probably recent migrants from either Maple Lake or the Clearwater River.Black bullhead numbers (56/TN) have increased significantly since 1989 and are more abundant than normal (1.20-22.56 per TN) in similar lakes.  Brown bullheads are less abundant (1.1/TN) than the normal range and tend to grow larger than blacks.  Bullheads captured in conjunction with northern pike rescue were also routinely removed from the lake through the early eighties.  The bluegill sample (4.3/TN) is within the inter-quartile range for class 39 lakes although abundance may have decreased since 1989.  Mean weight of bluegills has increased from less than 0.2 lb. to 0.33 lb.  Relative stock density (8 in. preferred size) is currently 18% compared to 0% three years ago.Both largemouth bass and black crappie are present in below-average numbers.  Aeration (winterkill prevention) may affect their abundance, as well as the abundance of all fish species present,  in future years.The gillnet catch of yellow perch is on the low end of the normal inter-quartile range (6.0/GN) for similar lakes.  Fish as long as 11 in. were sampled and there is evidence than the size structure may be increasing for this species.  The largest yellow perch captured in 1989 were 8.5-8.9 in. long.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Badger Lake is a marginal fish lake on the northern edge of Erskine, MN.  The lake has a history of winter kills and abundant populations of Northern Pike and Black Bullhead.  Following winterkills, the lake re-populates with Northern Pike and other fish species by immigration via County Ditch 73 or other channels.  Pump and baffle aeration, begun in 1990, was discontinued in 2006 due to the lack of access to locations with good lake depth and electrical power. Since then, the City of Erskine annually operates two surface agitator units in Badger Lake, reducing the potential for winterkill.  The City incurs all costs associated with the operation.  DNR Fisheries crews monitor dissolved oxygen occasionally (usually in late winter) to evaluate the likelyhood of winterkill. <br> \n <br> \nAlthough bullheads remained present in 2016, net catches have certainly declined in the past decade.  Northern Pike abundance in 2016 was similar to the 2010 survey at 12 pike per gill net.  The average size of Northern Pike was up slightly from the 2010 survey and above the historical average.  Pike averaged 2.1 pounds, with the largest Northern Pike sampled being 29.3 inches. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill numbers in Badger Lake have increased to a historic high in 2016.  Although the average size of 5.1 inches was at an all time low, the largest Bluegill sampled was 9.5 inches. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye numbers have historically been low in Badger Lake and sustained by fry stocking. Three Walleye were sampled in 2016 which is a historic high.  Yellow Perch numbers remained at the long term average of 3.5 fish per net and had an average size of 7 inches.</p>",

The lake has a history of winter kills and abundant populations of northern pike and black bullhead.  Following winterkills, the lake re-populates with northern pike and other fish species by immigration via County Ditch 73 or other channels.  Pump and baffle aeration, begun in 1990, was discontinued in 2006 due to the lack of access to locations with good lake depth and electrical power. Since then, the City of Erskine annually operates two surface agitator units in Badger Lake, reducing the potential for winterkill.  The City incures all costs associated with the operation.  DNR Fisheries crews monitor dissolved oxygen occasionally (usually in late winter) to evaluate the likelyhood of winterkill. <br> \n <br> \nAlthough bullheads remained present in 2010, net catches have certainly declined in the past decade.  The northern pike population has also declined, but larger pike were found in 2010 than in any previous study.  Catch rates averaged 11.5 pike per set and those pike averaged 2.2 pounds each, though a couple of fish over thirty inches were also sampled.  Growth rates of northern pike are good in this lake. <br> \n <br> \nSmall numbers of largemouth bass, yellow perch, and bluegill were also found in Badger Lake. White suckers and brown bullheads were common. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Badger Lake is a marginal fish lake on the northern edge of Erskine, MN.  The lake has a history of winter kills and abundant populations of northern pike and black bullhead.  Following winterkills, the lake re-populates with northern pike and other fish species by immigration via County Ditch 73 or other inlets.  Pump and baffle aeration, begun in 1990, has apparently helped to change the fish community structure somewhat in recent years.Through Minnesota's CORE (Cooperative Opportunity for Resource Enhancement) project, the Erskine Lion's Club and Erskine city employees operate and maintain a state-owned pump and baffle aeration system during most winters.  DNR Fisheries crews monitorBadger Lake's dissolved oxygen and alert city workers when levels are nearing a critical point for sustaining fish life.Although bullheads remain abundant, the northern pike population has improved over the past 13 years.  Of three test net studies during that time period, only the most recent (2002) found pike over thirty inches in length present.  Not only were pike larger in the 2002 study, but also, net catches of northern pike were higher than in either of the other two surveys.  Catch rates averaged 20.5 pike per set and those pike averaged 2.5 pounds each.  Growth of northern pike is good on this lake.Small numbers of largemouth bass, walleye, black crappie, yellow perch, and bluegill were also found in Badger Lake.  White suckers and brown bullheads were common while black bullheads (more resistant to winter kill) were extremely abundant.  Bullhead catch rates in 2002 were over 90 fish per trap net which was the highest ever recorded.</p>",
