However, the Yellow Perch population appears to be relatively low with (0) Yellow Perch caught in gill nets.  This would easily be explained by the abundant Northern Pike population.  The younger Norther Pike (Age III and under) reflect an 18+% negative deviation from the mean length which would suggest the population is experiencing competition, i.e., space and/or forage.</p>",

Backpack electrofishing and/or seining were conducted at 10 stations, representing a variety of habitat types, along the shoreline of Brophy Lake.  The survey was conducted during the five-year sampling window for intensive monitoring efforts within the Long Prairie River watershed, and will be contributing to a watershed assessment process in coordination with Minnesota Pollution Control Agency.\n\nFifteen species were collected during this survey.  Four species (Banded Killifish, Iowa Darter, Least Darter, and Rock Bass) were considered \"intolerant\" and only one species (Green Sunfish) was considered \"tolerant\" based on current tolerance classifications for Minnesota lakes. \n\nNearshore catch data will be used along with gill and trap net catch data to develop an Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) score, which is indicative of the health of Brophy Lake.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of nearshore fish species in Brophy Lake was conducted on July 10, 2023, by Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program staff. Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake, and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at ten sampling stations, but one station was sampled from the boat due soft sediments and dense vegetation. Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample nine stations and site conditions prevented the use of a seine at one station. Nearshore sampling captured twenty species of fish including seven species that are intolerant of disturbance (i.e., Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, Least Darter, Pugnose Shiner, and Rock Bass) and one that is tolerant of disturbance (i.e., Green Sunfish). <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore data were combined with gill net and trap net data from a July 2022 survey to describe the fish community and provide a fish-based IBI (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment. In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g., Blackchin Shiner, Least Darter, and Rock Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g., Common Carp and Green Sunfish). The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.  <br> \n <br> \nResults from this survey will be considered when the biological health of Brophy Lake is assessed during the Long Prairie River Watershed assessment process, which will be completed in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Brophy is a 289-acre lake located five miles west of Alexandria. A DNR public access is located on the northwest shoreline. Lake Brophy County Park is located near the public access and features a swimming beach, fishing pier, mountain bike trails and an accessible playground. Water clarity was 13 feet during the survey. Clear water and abundant vegetation make Lake Brophy most suitable for bass and panfish.\n \nBluegill relative abundance (10.1/trap net) is slightly lower when compared to similar lakes, or recent surveys. Even though most Bluegill were small, 28% of Bluegill sampled exceeded 7 inches, with the largest being just over 8 inches. Average length between trap nets and gill nets was 6 inches. Few Black Crappie have been sampled in past surveys, likely because of timing of the survey and therefore is not truly indicative of the population. Even though few crappies were sampled, Black Crappie abundance (2.8/gill net) was the highest since 1979. Most fish were young and therefore small, averaging almost 7 inches. The largest crappie sampled was just under 11 inches.\n \nLargemouth Bass numbers (38.2/hour of electrofishing) have significantly increased from the 2016 survey when very few bass were sampled. Bass ranged in length from 6 to 19 inches, with an average of 13 inches. Size structure has improved from previous surveys but many small bass are still present.\n \nThe Northern Pike population (6.5/gill net) is similar to recent surveys in Lake Brophy but has been quite variable in the past. The size structure is poor, with 76% of pike under 22 inches. The largest pike sampled was almost 29 inches. Anglers are encouraged to harvest small Northern Pike. New Northern Pike regulations were implemented in 2018 to increase size structure. Lake Brophy is in the North-central Zone, where all pike from 22 to 26 inches must be released. Anglers can keep 10 pike, but not more than two can be longer than 26 inches. Northern Pike taken by spearing follow the same rules except one pike may be between 22 and 26 inches, or two larger than 26 inches. For more information see: https://www.dnr.state.mn.us/pike/index.html.\n\nWalleye are stocked as a ?bonus' fishery and persist at a low abundance (0.5/gill net). Of the few Walleye sampled, they ranged in length from 18 to 23 inches. Too few Yellow Perch were sampled for any meaningful analysis. Other species sampled include Black Bullhead, Bowfin, Common Carp, Green Sunfish, Hybrid Sunfish, Pumpkinseed, Rock Bass and Yellow Bullhead.\n</p>",

Northern Pike are very abundant and small in size. 64% of the Northern Pike were under 18.0 inches, probably due to the high northern pike population. Walleye numbers are low, but they are able to sustain themselves through natural reproduction or fish runs into the lake. Bluegills are abundant and provide an adequate fishery. Largemouth Bass are present and, according to previous creel census, contribute to the angler's creel. Yellow Bullheads are also abundant and could provide an excellent fishery.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Brophy is a 289-acre lake located five miles west of Alexandria.  A DNR public access is located on the northwest shoreline.  Lake Brophy's outlet is located in the northeast area of the lake.  The outlet channel affords anglers with small boats navigable access to a chain of smaller lakes.  Those connected basins include North Union, Stoney, and Lottie lakes and eventually, Lake Cowdry.  Quiet fishing experiences on lightly developed, natural environment lakes can be found here, especially during the week.   <br> \n <br> \nWater clarity measures average 10 feet during summer months.  With extensive shallows, bluffs along the south shore and an island offering protection from wind and waves, and good water transparency, Lake Brophy supports a healthy mix of submerged, floating-leaf and emergent plant communities.   Habitat conditions are optimal for sunfishes such as Largemouth Bass, Bluegill and Black Crappie, and ambush feeders such as Northern Pike.   Walleye are stocked, but recruitment of stocked fish has been modest.  Walleye catch rates may not be great, but average size of captures tends to be greater. <br> \n <br> \nThe most recent standardized fisheries survey was completed in late July, 2016.  The netting portion of the survey was preceded by an electrofishing survey conducted on June 2, to estimate Largemouth Bass abundance and population size structure.  Largemouth bass captures during the 2016 spring electrofishing survey were greatly reduced from that of prior assessments.  Some of this reduction can be attributed to a change in survey methodology.  The electrofishing boat traversed the entire perimeter of the shoreline rather than sampling select areas supporting high quality habitat.  Catch success was also influenced by atypically high water transparency and avoidance of the boat by bass at time of the survey.  It would appear that some net reduction in population density has also occurred in response to poor nesting success and recruitment of young bass into the population from approximately 2005 through 2009.   Bass captures ranged from 2.1 to 16.9 inches in length.   <br> \n <br> \nThe netting component of the standardized survey described a substantial increase in Northern Pike population density.  Most pike captures were young fish, but length distribution of captures extended to 35.2 inches.  Average length of pike captures was 20.6 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nSimilar to abundance estimates gained from Largemouth Bass, Bluegill catches were lower than recorded over the past three surveys.  Age distribution of Bluegill catches extended to age 10, but annual recruitment proved to be relatively modest.  No strong year classes were evident.  Length of Bluegill captures ranged from 3.1 to 8.4 inches.  Most of the larger Bluegills were caught in gill net sets set well off shore rather than trap nets. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie catches were also limited in near shore trap net sets.  The catch was represented by cohorts of three age classes.  Most captures were five- and six-year-old crappies that exceeded 10.0 inches in length. <br> \n <br> \nSixteen Walleyes were captured in gill net sets.  These captures averaged 2.3 lbs and 18.1 inches in length.  The largest Walleye recorded during the survey measured 27.6 inches. <br> \n <br> \nOther gamefishes captured during the survey included Pumpkinseed Sunfish, sunfish hybrids, and Rock Bass. <br> \n <br> \nLake Brophy is designated as infested with Zebra Mussels so extreme care must be taken when removing watercraft from the lake.  Make sure all water is drained and all vegetation or mud is removed, especially from anchors. <br> \n    <br> \nLake Brophy adjoins Douglas County's newest park facility.  Lake Brophy County Park is located atop hills on the lake's north side.  Park plans include development of a swimming beach on Lake Brophy's northwest shore.  The park and lake are bisected by the Central Lakes Trail, a 14-foot wide bituminous recreational trail that runs 55 miles from Dalton to Osakis where it joins the Lake Wobegon Regional Trail. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Brophy Lake support diverse and abundant communities of submergent and emergent vegetation. The plant and fish communities present in Brophy Lake are similar to the other lakes within a chain west of Alexandria.  The lakes within the chain include Lottie, Stoney, and North Union.  Norther Pike catch rates have declined steadily since 1979.  A mean catch rate of 2.0 fish/gillnet was recorded in 1992, which is below the 25th percentile (3.5 fish/net) of mean catch rates from lakes within lake classification 31.  Catch rates during the ice out trapnetting assessment averaged 2.9 fish/trapnet.  There is no historic data to compare with this catch rate.  The mean weight of Northern Pike captured during the summer population assessment was 1.9 pounds.  PSD was calculated at 27%.  Northern Pike growth in Brophy Lake exceeds the mean growth rate of Northern Pike in other area lakes within lake class 31.  Age 2 fish averaged 18.1 inches in total length at time of annulus formation. Only fish ages 1-3 were represented in the catch. The reason for the decline in Northern Pike catch rates is unclear.  Many of the area lakes have experienced a recent decline in Northern Pike abundance which is attributed to drought conditions experienced in the late 1980's and 1990.  However the other lakes in the chain; Lottie, Stoney, and North Union, did not experience a similar decline in Northern Pike catch rates.  The carp trap structure located between lakes Brophy and Mina may be preventing Northern Pike from reaching spawning areas.  The carp trap was installed in the early 1970's.  Recent introductions of Walleye may be suppressing Northern Pike abundance given the very limited yep population. Daytime ac electrofishing yielded 37.6 stock-size Largemouth Bass per hour.  CPUE averaged 18.0 stock size Largemouth Bass per hour during a similar electrofishing survey in 1988.  PSD and RSD-P were calculated at 28.0 and 5%, respectively.  A similar size structure was recorded in 1987 when PSD was calculated at 33.3%. There is ample spawning habitat for Largemouth Bass which results in consistent natural reproduction.  This is documented by the age class distribution of fish captured and a substock (total length <8.0 inches) CPUE of 9.0 fish per hour.  Growth of Largemouth Bass in Brophy Lake is similar to the mean growth rate of Largemouth Bass in other area lakes within lake class 31. Age 5 fish averaged 13.0 inches in total length at time of annulus formation.  Bluegill catches declined from 45.8 fish/trapnet in 1988 to 15.3 fish/trap- net in 1992.  The normal range of mean catch rates from lakes within lake class 31 is 11.7 to 55.0 fish/trapnet.  Gillnet catch rate increased from 2.5 fish/net in 1988 to 18.5 fish/net in 1992. Similar declines in trapnet CPUE and increases in gillnet CPUE were observed on lakes Lottie and Stoney.  Age 3 fish or the 1989 year-class of Bluegill were not well represented in the survey.  The high density of submergent vegetation in the littoral zone of these lakes may have reduced capture efficiency of trapnets.  The population appears to be dominated by three and four-year old fish.  The mean weight of fish captured was 0.1 pounds.  PSD was calculated at 16%.  The PSD of fish captured in gillnets was calculated at 68%. Bluegill growth in Lake Brophy is poor and less than the mean growth rate of Bluegill in other area lakes within lakes class 31.  Age 5 fish averaged 5.0 inches in total length at time of annulus formation.  An experimental stocking of Walleye fingerlings occurred in 1971.  The recent fingerling stocking strategy included stocking in 1985 and 1986 and in even numbered years following 1986.  Walleye catch rate decreased from 6.5 fish/gillnet in 1988 to 2.0 fish/gillnet in 1992.  The normal range of mean catch rates for lakes within lake classification 31 is 1.3 to 5.3 fish/gillnet.  The Walleye captured in 1988 were mostly cohorts of the 1985 and 1986 year classes, suggesting that fingerling stocking in those years was successful.  The size of the Walleye fingerlings stocked in 1988 and 1990 were larger than the fingerlings stocked in 1985 and 1986 which resulted in fewer fish being stocked.  This may be responsible for recent decrease in catch rates. Presence of Walleye in nets set in n.  Union lake would suggest potential for some movement of Walleye among these connected lakes.  Mean weight of fish captured in 1992 was 2.1 pounds and PSD was calculated at 75%.  Walleye growth in Lake Brophy is similar to the mean growth rate of Walleye in other area lakes within lake class 31.  Age 5 fish average 17.1 inches in total length at time of annulus formation.  The yep population has not responded to the decrease in Northern Pike abundance. Gillnet catches averaged 2.0 fish/net in 1992. Gillnet catches have never exceeded 3.5 fish/net in surveys dating back to 1975.  Future stocking plans involving either Walleye or Northern Pike should be very conservative and evaluated closely given the extremely low densities of preferred forage.  Yellow Bullhead catch rate increased from 33.7 fish/gillnet in 1988 to 77.0 fish/gillnet in 1992.  The normal range of mean catch rates for lake class 31 is 1.0 -8.5 fish/gillnet.  Black Bullhead CPUE fell from 18.0 fish/ gillnet to 6.5 fish/gillnet during the same time period.  Other species captured during the population assessment included; Black Crappie, Pumpkinseed, Cisco, White Sucker, Bowfin, Common Carp, Green sunfish, and Hybrid sunfish. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Brophy is a 289-acre basin located five miles west of Alexandria.  An improved DNR public access is located on the northwest shoreline.  The outlet located at the northeast shoreline flows through a chain of small lakes and into Lake Cowdry.  These channels are navigable by small boats and afford quality fishing experiences on lightly developed, natural environment lakes. <br> \n <br> \nWater clarity and quality are relatively good during summer months.  Clarity typically exceeds 9.0 ft.  Fifty-two percent of the basin area is less the 15.0 ft. in depth.  In response to extensive shallows and good water quality, Brophy Lake holds an abundant and diverse aquatic plant community.  Stands of emergent vegetation, particularly hardstem bulrush, are scattered around the lake, especially around the island and outlet.  <br> \n <br> \nPhysical and biological attributes of the lake are typical of a \"bass-panfish\" lake.  Gamefish are abundant, but grow slow due to competition and ample vegetation for young fish to escape from predators.  Average size of gamefish in the lake tends to be on the small side, but catches rates are exceptional.  Lake Brophy is an excellent choice for anglers seeking fast action and quality family-fishing experiences. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass and bluegill sunfish are abundant.  Average sizes of largemouth bass and bluegill captured in the 2006 survey were 9.1 and 5.3 inches, respectively.  There are proportionally, few bass and bluegill in the lake.  They don't grow very fast.  When faced with high natural mortality and harvest once reaching a harvestable-size, few live long enough to grow big.  A bluegill doesn't reach 8.0 inches in length until age-9.  These population characteristics hold true for black crappie.  Population abundance is much more variable than other members of the sunfish family due to inconsistent reproductive success, but crappie support a popular fishery.  In contrast to other sunfishes, growth rate of black crappie is near average, but again, there are relatively few large individuals in the population.  Black crappie are short-lived, thus few exceed 10.0 inches in length.  Average length of crappie caught in trapnets during the 2006 survey was 7.8 inches. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike catches were lower during the 2006 survey than in previous surveys, but continue to be abundant and occasionally, overly abundant.  Reproductive successes through the wet 90's were great.  Eleven consecutive age groups were represented in the 2006 survey.   Preferred prey, yellow perch, are scarce due to a top-heavy predator community and excessive predation, thus pike grow slow.  Northern pike live to a ripe old age in Lake Brophy, but relatively few fish exceed 28.0 inches in length. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye fingerlings are stocked in even numbered years to diversify and maintain a viable fishery.  Age distribution of population samples indicates fingerling stocking is supplemental to some modest and inconsistent natural reproduction or immigration from connected lakes.  In general, population abundance has been disappointing given indications of natural recruitment and a long stocking history.  Occasional strong year classes develop to bolster population density, but during most surveys walleye gillnet catch rates have been at the lower end of the range of expected catches.  Mortality of young walleye is high before growing to a size they are less subject to predation.  Despite limited population density, fishing is reasonably good.  Thirty-seven percent of walleye captured in the 2006 survey exceeded 20.0 inches in length. <br> \n <br> \nThe fish community in Lake Brophy is unbalanced.  Predator densities exceed the capacity of the lake to optimize gamefish growth.  Yellow perch numbers are low.  Most bluegill are too large to be eaten by small northern pike and largemouth bass.  Anglers can do wonders in restoring predator-prey relationships by focusing harvest on small northern pike and largemouth bass.  There is also a surplus of medium-size slow growing bluegill that should be harvested.  They are not likely to grow much bigger.  Harvest  5 - 6.5 inch sunfish.   <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Northern pike catches averaged 14.2 fish/gillnet in 1997, compared to 2.0 fish/gillnet in 1992.  Thelow catch rate in 1992 was likely due to poor natural reproduction during low water levels thatprevailed during the late 1980's.  Gillnet catches averaged 8.5, 14.0, and 28.0 fish/net in 1988, 1984,and 1979, respectively.  The normal range of mean catch rates from lakes with similar chemical andphysical characteristics is 3.5 - 10.5 fish/gillnet.   Mean weight of fish captured in 1997 was 1.7pounds.  Night, DC electrofishing yielded 27.3 stock-size largemouth bass per hour.  Mean weight offish captured was 0.8 pounds.  Approximately 40% of the fish captured were 12 inches in length orgreater and 17% exceeded 15 inches.  Bluegill catches averaged 7.0 fish/trapnet.  Trapnet catches werehigher in previous surveys, ranging from 15.3 to 46.0 fish/net.  Dense beds of chara made trapnettingdifficult and may have reduced capture efficiency.  However, gillnet catches decreased from 18.5fish/net in 1992 to 0.2 fish/net in 1997, suggesting an actual decline in bluegill abundance.  Meanweight of fish captured in 1997 was 0.2 pounds.  More than one-half of the fish were 6 inches in lengthor greater, however few exceeded 8 inches.  Walleye catches averaged 3.0 fish/gillnet which is within the normal range of mean catch rates fromsimilar lakes (1.3 - 5.0 fish/gillnet).  Gillnet catches have ranged from 1.8 to 6.5 fish/net inprevious surveys dating back to 1979.  Mean weight of fish captured was 1.5 pounds.  Recent fingerlingstockings appear to have little impact on walleye abundance.  In fact, the largest year class in theage class distribution (age-2) corresponds to a year of no stocking (1995).  Yellow perch abundance islimited.  Gillnet catches averaged 0.7 fish/net which is below the normal range of mean catch rates forsimilar lakes (3.4 - 43.6 fish/gillnet).  Gillnet catches have not exceeded 2.0 fish/net in previoussurveys dating back to 1979.  Black crappie are not effectively sampled during summer months toaccurately evaluate relative density and size structure.  Trapnet catches averaged 1.0 fish/net.  Fishranged from 4.3 to 8.9 inches in total length.      </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Brophy is a small, 289-acre lake located five miles west of Alexandria.  A DNR public access is located on the northwest shoreline. The outlet on the northeast shoreline flows through a chain of smaller lakes and eventually into Lake Cowdry. These channels are navigable by small boats and afford quality fishing experiences on lightly developed, natural environment lakes.  <br> \n <br> \nWater clarity and quality on Lake Brophy are relatively good during summer months. Clarity typically exceeds 9.0 ft.  Fifty-two percent of the basin area is less the 15.0 feet deep.  There is an abundant and diverse aquatic plant community that provides excellent fish and wildlife habitat.  Hardstem bulrush, an important emergent plant, is common and scattered around the lake's island and along north-northeast shorelines.  The gamefish community is mainly comprised of largemouth bass, bluegill, northern pike and walleye.   Largemouth bass captured in 2010 averaged 9.7 inches in total length.  Approximately 40% of 8.0 inch and larger bass caught exceeded 12.0 inches in length.  Bluegills are abundant and average about 5.7 inches.  Good habitat and therefore, good fishing spots can be found for panfish throughout the lake.  <br> \n  <br> \nNorthern pike and walleye are present in Lake Brophy, but you're not likely to catch many big fish.  Northern pike collected during this assessment ranged from 17.6 to 29.6 inches in length and averaged 22.4 inches.  Walleye catches averaged 4.8 fish/gillnet.  The largest walleye captured was 21.0 inches in length.  Average size was only 12.5 inches due to a high proportion of two-year olds making up the population sample.  Lake Brophy's fish community is top-heavy with predators and prey such as yellow perch are in limited supply.  Consequently, northern pike, walleye and largemouth bass grow slowly and do not reach their full growth potential.    <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Walleye fingerlings were stocked in 1985 and 1986 and two strong corresponding year-classes have been established. Eighty-five percent of walleye netted came from those two years. Gillnet CPUE values in previous surveys (1975, 1979, and 1984) ranged from 1.80 walleye/net night to 3.50 walleye net night. Catch rates averaged 6.50 walleye/gillnet night in the 1988 survey. Northern Pike relative abundance continued a steady decline from 28.0 fish/gillnet night in 1979 to 8.5 fish/gillnet night in 1988. Mean weight of captured northern pike was 1.73 lbs. Yellow perch were not sampled during the assessment. Bluegill abundance was high with an average catch of 46.00 bluegill/trap net night. Mean size was small (0.12 lb/bluegill). High abundance indices and small mean size imply a stunted population. Electrofishing produced a CPUE of 20.0 largemouth bass/hour. Largemouth Bass growth rates are average. No quality size fish were captured. Although Black Crappie were not adequately sampled, previous creel census suggests an adequate fishery. The Black Bullhead population may have sport or commercial value. Placement of fads may be desirable towards increasing angling success and harvest of sunfishes.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Brophy is a 289-acre basin located about five miles west of Alexandria.  It lies within the Long Prairie River watershed.  The inlet on the west shore connects Lake Brophy to Lake Mina and the outlet in the northeast corner flows through a chain of small lakes into Lake Cowdry.  Fish are known to move throughout this system.  Water clarity and quality are relatively good on Lake Brophy.  Seechi disk measurements average about 9 feet during summer months.  Lake Brophy supports an abundant and diverse aquatic plant community.  Most shallow areas along the shoreline are covered with dense beds of submerged vegetation.  Stands of emergent vegetation are scattered around the lake, especially around the island and near the outlet.  Beds of yellow waterlily are also present.  Aquatic plants are critical parts of a healthy lake ecosystem.  They provide spawning habitat and cover for many fish species.  Aquatic plants also maintain water quality by filtering runoff, protecting shorelines from erosion, and competing with nuisance algae for the available nutrients in the lake.  The fish community in Lake Brophy is typical for a small, heavily vegetated lake in west-central Minnesota.  Northern pike, largemouth bass, and sunfish are abundant and should provide good fishing opportunities.  Lake Brophy is a good choice for families seeking high catch rates.  Walleye are considered a bonus fish.  Fish captured in the recent survey ranged from 16-26 inches in length and averaged almost three pounds in weight.  Walleye fingerling stocking in alternate years since 1985 has been unsuccessful in increasing walleye abundance.  High northern pike numbers and low yellow perch abundance is likely responsible for the poor stocking success.    </p>",
