                "narrative": "<p>Roy Lake is part of the Gull Lake Chain and is located about one mile west of Nisswa.  Public access is via navigable channels from either Nisswa Lake, upstream, or Spider Lake, downstream in the chain.  The lake is 271 acres in size and has a maximum depth of 25 feet.  About 41% of the lake is less than 15 feet deep.  It is a hardwater lake with moderate phosphorous fertility.  Water clarity is typical for area lakes.  Shallow water soils are predominantly sand and gravel, with significant amounts of muck and silt in marshy areas.  The aquatic plant community is fairly diverse.  Emergent species like bulrushes are important because they help control shore erosion caused by wave action, help control nutrients and improve the quality of spawning habitat for bass and panfish species.  Submergent species are important because they provide vital food and cover for a wide variety of aquatic species.Northern pike was the most abundant gamefish in the 2001 netting.  The catch was in the high category when compared to similar type lakes but was similar to the catches in 1991 and 1996.  Seven age classes were sampled.  Growth was average.  The strongest year class was 1996, at 46% of the total catch.  Pike size averaged 22 inches and 2.6 pounds, similar to past nettings.Walleye were sampled in low numbers when compared to simlar type lakes but the 2001 catch was typical for this lake.  Largemouth bass were also caught in low, but typical, numbers in 2001.  Young bass were sampled by shoreline seine and appeared to have satisfactory growth.Black crappie were netted in low numbers in 2001 and had average growth rates.  They were taken in average numbers in 1996 and in high numbers in earlier nettings.  Bluegill catches have historically been high.  In 2001, eight year classes were sampled and growth was slow.  About 4% of measured bluegills were at least 7 inches long.  This compares with 6% in 1996 and 9% in 1991.Yellow perch, white sucker and tullibee are generally important food sources for gamefish.  The perch catch was in the average category.  Only two year classes were sampled and growth was good.  White suckers were taken in average numbers, as well.  Tullibees were not sampled in 2001 but were present in average numbers in past nettings.</p>",

Length ranged from 18-30 inches (median = 21 inches).  Six age classes were present, with 38% of the sample from the 1989 year class and 35% from the 1988 year class.  Growth appeared to be good for all age classes sampled.  Bluegill remained abundant (57.8/trapnet), and of small average size (0.12 lb).  About 9% of the measured bluegills were at least 7.0 inches long.  Largemouth bass was not sampled in 1985, but was present in average numbers (0.6/trap- net) in 1991.  The three sampled bass were from the 1989 year class.  Black crappie abundance (5.8/trapnet) and size (0.23 lb) were both similar to 1985 values, and average for the lake class.  The walleye catch (1.0/gillnet) again equaled the first quartile value for the lake class.  At 1.90 lbs average, size remained in the fish sampled represented four age classes (4-7).  Cisco abundance (1.8/gillnet) rose.  Yellow perch abundance (2.6/gillnet) dropped 73% (statistically significant) and became low. Median length was 5.0 inches.  White sucker (3.20/gillnet) size remained average and nearly unchanged at 2.03 lbs.  The bullhead catch was lower in 1991 than in 1985. Black bullhead dropped from 5.0 to 0.8/lift in gillnets (low abundance) and were not sampled in trapnets. Size remained large at 0.85 lb.  Yellow bullheads fell from 27.4 to 7.2/trapnet, which was equal to the third quartile value for the lake class.  Average size rose to 0.51 lb (at the first quartile value). Brown bullhead dropped from 2.8 (average) to 0.4/trapnet (low), and size dropped slightly to 0.55 lb.</p>",

Roy Lake is located in the Crow Wing River watershed.  A nearshore survey was conducted to assess the populations of both game and non-game fish species.  Ten 100' long sampling stations were evenly spaced around the lakeshore.  Each station was then sampled by backpack electrofishing, and if conditions allowed with a 15' or 50' 1/8th inch seine. <br> \n <br> \nThe survey took place on June 28, 2019, with all 10 stations sampled by backpack electrofishing.  The 50' 1/8th inch seine was used at 1 station and the 15' 1/8th inch seine was used at an additional 4 stations.  Soft bottom and heavy vegetation prevented the use of seines at the other 5 sampling sites.  Fourteen species were sampled.  Rock bass was the only species sampled that is intolerant of habitat disturbance.  This nearshore survey will be used along with the gill net and trap net survey conducted on June 10-13, 2019 to calculate a Fish-Based Index of Biotic Integrity (FIBI) score.  The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health by the types of fish species present and comparing it to what is expected for this type of lake. <br> \n</p>",

Only one walleye was caught in the 2013 survey and northern pike had an average length of 19.1\", with only 7% measuring 24\" or larger.  However, some decent panfishing opportunities exist if you navigate there through the channels from Gull. <br> \n <br> \nWhile neither species had many large fish, both black crappie and bluegill had average net catches and plenty large enough to keep.  Black crappie were caught at the rate of 2.3/net and the average size was 8.9\", with 90% of the fish measuring 8\" or larger.  The largest was 10.8\".  Bluegill numbers were the lowest to date at 14.6/net, but still average for this type of lake.  Average length was 7\" and 51% were 7\" or larger.   <br> \n <br> \nRoy Lake is designated as AIS (aquatic invasive species) infested waters because of zebra mussels in Gull Lake.  Lake users should inspect and remove any aquatic plants and animals from their watercraft and trailers as well as pull the plug and drain all water from the watercraft, including bilges, livewells and baitwells. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Roy Lake is a 320 acre lake located near the city of Nisswa in Crow Wing County.   Roy is part of the Gull Chain of Lakes.  The maximum depth is 26', and 40% of the lake 15' deep or less.   Water clarity was good, with a secchi depth reading of 24'.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike were sampled in high numbers at 12.2/gill net, when compared to similar lakes.  Average length was 21.0\", with fish up to 37.9\" sampled.  Northern pike in the protected 22\"-26\" slot made up 16% of the catch, with 15% measuring at least 26.0\" in length.  Lakes in this part of the state have a new northern pike regulation enacted in 2018: possession limit of 10 with not more than 2 over 26\".  All from 22\"-26\" must be immediately released.  Please refer to the current Minnesota Fishing Regulations for additional information.  <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappies were captured in average numbers in both gill nets (1.3/net) and trap nets (1.1/net).  Average length was 7.2\" in gill nets and 9.1\" in trap nets.  For both gears combined 61% measured at least 8.0\" in length.  Bluegills were also sampled in average numbers at 9.0/trap net.  Average length was 5.4\", with 19% at least 7.0\" in length. <br> \n <br> \nEven though walleyes are not stocked directly into Roy Lake, they are present due to the connection to Gull Lake where walleye fry are stocked annually.  Only three walleye were sampled in gill nets.  Average length was nice at 21.3\". <br> \n <br> \nRoy Lake is designated as AIS (aquatic invasive species) infested water because of zebra mussels.  Lake users are required to inspect and remove any aquatic plants and animals from their watercraft and trailers as well as pull the plug and drain all water from the watercraft, including bilges, livewells and baitwells. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Roy Lake is part of the Gull Lake chain and is located about one mile west of Nisswa.  Public access is via navigable channels from either Nisswa Lake, upstream, or Spider Lake, downstream in the chain.  The lake is 271 acres in size and has a maximum depth of 26 feet.  About 41% of the lake is less than 15 feet deep.  It is a hardwater lake with moderate phosphorus fertility.  Water clarity is typical for area lakes.  Shallow water soils are predominantly sand and gravel, with significant areas of muck and silt in marshy areas.  The aquatic plant community is fairly diverse.  Emergent species like bulrushes are important because they help control shore erosion caused by wave action, help control nutrients and improve the quality of spawning habitat for bass and panfish species.  Submergent species are important because they provide vital food and cover for a wide variety of aquatic species.Northern pike was the most abundant gamefish in the 1996 test netting.  Bluegill was the commonest panfish found.The northern pike catch was in the \"high\" category when compared to similar type lakes but was similar to the catch in the 1991 netting.  Seven age classes were sampled.  Growth was fast for younger fish and remained \"good\" for older fish.  The strongest year classes were from 1994 and 1993.  Pike ages 2-3 were most frequently caught in both the '91 and '96 nettings.  Average size of pike was 21 inches and 2.4 lbs. in both nettings, as well.Walleyes were sampled in \"low\" numbers compared to similar type lakes.  Previous catches have also been in the \"low\" category.Largemouth bass is another species which has been typically caught in low numbers.  The '96 catch was in the \"low\" category, but young bass were reasonably common in late summer seine hauls done to check natural reproduction.Black crappies were found in \"high\" numbers in previous nettings and were taken in \"average\" numbers in '96.  Several year classes were sampled and growth was good.Bluegill catches have been in the \"high\" category in each of the four nettings done on the lake.  In '96, seven year classes were sampled and growth varied between good and slow for individual year classes.  About 50% of the bluegills were from the 1991 year class.  About 6% of the bluegills measured from trapnets were at least 7.0 inches long, compared to 9% in '91.Yellow perch, white sucker and tullibee are generally important food sources for gamefish.  The perch catch was in the \"average\" category in '96 and was similar to the '91 catch, which was in the \"low\" category.  Several year classes were sampled and growth was good.  Suckers were taken in \"average\" numbers, as well.  The catch was lower than in '91 but was similar to earlier netting results.  Tullibees were also caught in numbers which were in the \"average\" category and similar to previous catches.Other species which were sampled in the '96 netting included rock bass and pumpkinseed, both caught in \"high\" numbers; bowfin (dogfish), brown bullhead, yellow bullhead and hybrid sunfish, found in \"average\" numbers; and green sunfish, present in \"low\" numbers.</p>",
