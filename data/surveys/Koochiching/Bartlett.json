                "narrative": "<p>Bartlett Lake is located near the town of Northome in southwestern Koochiching County.  Bartlett is generally shallow, with a maximum depth of 16 feet and an average depth of about 9 feet.  The lake has experienced several winterkill events in the past; thus, the fish community has been commonly dominated by species that can tolerate low oxygen levels such as bullhead and yellow perch.  However, recent stocking events have been successful in reshaping the fish community with several species of sport-fish. <br> \n <br> \nBlack bullhead were by far the most abundant species in the sample and greatly exceeded the range for this lake type.  Size in gill nets ranged from 4.5 to 12.0 inches and the mean was 8.6.  Sixty percent were less than 9.0 inches.    <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie abundance was high during the 2012 investigation and in the previous investigation (2007).  High black crappie abundance is the result of the introduction of black crappie in 2004 and 2005, and the successful reproduction of that brood stock.  In 2012, abundance was much greater than the expected range for this lake type.  Size in trap nets ranged from 4.6 to 12.0 inches with an exceptional mean of 10.5 inches.  Eighty-eight percent of the trap-net catch were fish greater than ten inches.  Six year-classes were present and age ranged from 1 to 7 years.  However, very few young fish were captured; only 7% were age-4 or younger.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike abundance was above the expected range for this lake type.  Based on previous investigations, northern pike have rarely dominated the fish community of Bartlett Lake.  However, adult northern pike were stocked in 2004, 2005, and 2008.  A reproducing population has been established.  In 2012, four year-classes were present and age ranged from 1 to 4 years.  Ages 1 and 2 represented 81% of the sample.  Size ranged from 15.4 to 32.6 inches and the mean was 20.3.  Northern pike in Bartlett Lake grew fast; length at age 3 was 24.4 inches, which was well above the area average of 21.2 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch gill-net abundance was well above the expected range for this lake type.  Although abundance was high, the 2012 level remains well below observations in the two previous investigations.  In 2012, seven year-classes were present and age ranged from 2 to 8 years.  Age-6 fish represented 65% of the sample.  Total length in the gill-net sample ranged from 5.4 to 10.0 inches and the mean was 7.7.  Mean weight was near the upper end of the expected range.     </p>",

Bartlett is a highly productive lake that has a history of frequent winterkill events. Between winterkill events, Bartlett is capable of quickly rebounding to provide fish that are of interest to anglers. A winterkill event occurred in 2014, and in response to that event adult Black Crappie and Northern Pike have been stocked in the lake. A full population assessment was completed in July of 2021. Northern Pike, Bluegill, and Yellow Perch were the only game species sampled in the survey. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike were represented by all year classes from 2014 to 2019 with the exception of 2017. The 2019 year class was most abundant in the survey. The Northern Pike catch rate was extremely high at 19.3/net. Northern Pike ranged in length from 18 to 24.8 inches, with a mean of 20.4 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie were not captured during the survey. Four Bluegill were captured in trap nets, ranging in length from 6 to 8.3 inches. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch were very abundant (107.3/net), with some preferred length fish in the catch. The mean length of Yellow Perch was 7 inches, ranging in length from 5.7 to 11.9 inches.  <br> \n</p>",

At the time of the survey, yellow perch were extremely abundant, over 30 times more than average for this lake type.  Mean length of age-4 yellow perch was above the area and statewide averages.  Several year-classes were present, which included some large fish.     Above average numbers of brown and black bullheads were captured in the survey gear.  Also, one northern pike and one golden shiner were captured, indicating they were scarce.  Bartlett Lake offers wildlife viewing opportunities and occasionaly provides good fishing for short periods of time.   </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Bartlett is a shallow, eutrophic, 292-acre lake located in the southwest corner of Koochiching County near the town of Northome.  Bartlett Lake is heavily vegetated with several species of submerged plants growing to the surface in shallow water.  Winterkills occur frequently on Bartlett Lake and the composition of the fishery can change rapidly.  There is a small unimproved earthen boat ramp located on the south side of the lake within a municipal campground.  A DNR fishing pier is also located at this campground.  The Bartlett Lake fishery is presently managed for northern pike and black crappie. <br> \n <br> \nAt the time of this investigation, northern pike gillnet abundance (5.83/net) was the highest recorded for Bartlett Lake since 1946 and was greater than the median for lakes in the same classification.  The pike sampled appeared to be either brood fish stocked in 2004 or 2005 or progeny that hatched following the introduction.  Pike lengths ranged from 18.1 to 28.4 inches with an average length of 24.7 inches.  The average weight of 3.56 pounds was exceptional for this lake class. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie adults were introduced in 2004 and 2005 and appear to have successfully reproduced.  The black crappie trapnet abundance (29.44/net) was extraordinary for this lake class.  Most crappie sampled were relatively small and were either two or three year-olds.  Growth rates of crappie were the second highest on record for the International Falls Management Area.  Lengths of crappie sampled ranged from 4.5 to 10.2 inches, however, 19% of the catch were over nine inches in length. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch also were present in Bartlett Lake in high numbers (65.00/net).  Perch lengths ranged from 5.4 to 11.7 inches and averaged 7.3 inches.  Approximately 26% of the catch were greater than eight inches in length and 10% were greater than nine inches in length. <br> \n <br> \nOther species observed during this investigation included black bullhead, brown bullhead, bluegill and white sucker.  The sportfishery of Bartlett Lake is currently the most attractive it has been in many years.  <br> \n <br> \n   </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Bartlett Lake is a 304 acre lake located on the northeastern edge of the town of Northome, MN. Bartlett is a highly productive lake that has a history of frequent winterkill events. Between winterkill events, Bartlett is capable of quickly rebounding to provide fish that are of interest to anglers. A winterkill event occurred in 2014, and in response to that event adult Black Crappie and Northern Pike have been stocked in the lake. A full population assessment was completed in July of 2016. <br> \n <br> \nAll but a few fish that were caught during the 2016 survey came from the 2014 or 2015 year class. This is due to the winterkill that occurred in 2014. As is typical for winterkill lakes, the growth of these young fish is rapid. Black Crappies are very abundant, and they are showing good growth with more than 11% of the fish already being over 8 inches. Northern Pike were less abundant than expected, but are also showing incredible growth with the 2 year old fish already averaging 4 pounds. Yellow Perch are also abundant, but the bulk of these will take longer to reach sizes that are of interest to anglers. However, a few perch were sampled that survived the winterkill of 2014, including one that was over 12 inches. Bartlett should provide a quality fishery for Black Crappie and Northern Pike if another winterkill doesn't occur. <br> \n</p>",
