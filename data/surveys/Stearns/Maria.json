Bluegill numbers have risen to average for area lakes from the low numbers found in 1961. Growth is generally below average for most of the five age classes sampled. Pumpkinseed and hybrid sunfish numbers are generally low White and Black Crappies have similar abundance and age profiles, and growth is good. White Crappies abundance has risen since, while that of Black Crappie appears unchanged. Yellow Perch numbers are below average for this area. Bullhead abundance levels are at or below area medians at 5.0/trap net for blacks, 1.8/trap net for browns, and 0.5/trap net for yellows. No major changes are apparent since 1961. Other rough fish populations appear to about normal for area lakes. These include Bowfin, White Sucker, and Common Carp. Golden Redhorse were caught only in this lake within the Plum Creek watershed.</p>",
