PSD WAS CALCULATED AT 62.7%, AND RSD=3.5%.  YEB WERE SAMPLED IN NUMBERS 19.2 TIMES THE LOCAL MEDIAN AND 11.3 TIMES THE STATE MEDIAN FOR GILLNETS; 1/2 THE STATE MEDIAN AND EQUAL TO THE LOCAL MEDIAN FOR TRAPNETS.  YEB WERE RATED AT 1.5 FISH PER POUND.  YEP WERE ONLY CAPTURED IN GILLNETS, IN NUMBERS 3.1 TIMES THE LOCAL MEDIAN AND TWICE THE STATE MEDIAN.  FISH RANGED IN SIZE FROM 5.5-8.4 INCHES TOTAL LENGTH. NOP WERE ALSO ONLY CAPTURED BY GILLNETS, IN NUMBERS 2.5 AND 2.2 TIMES THE LOCAL AND STATE MEDIANS.  POUNDS PER GILLNET SET EXCEEDED LOCAL AND STATE MEDIANS BY 3.9 AND 4.2 TIMES, RESPECTIVELY.  AGE 3 NOP MADE UP HALF THE CATCH, WITH AGES 4,5,7, AND 9 ALSO REPRESENTED.  GROWTH DURING THE FIRST AND SECOND YEAR OF LIFE WAS WELL ABOVE AVERAGE.  FOR YEARS 3 THROUGH 6, GROWTH WAS AVERAGE, DROPPING BELOW AVERAGE FOR YEAR 7.  RSD WAS CALCULATED AT 41.7%.  ONLY 2 WAE WERE CAPTURED IN THE GILLNETS AND NONE IN THE TRAPNETS.  SEVEN WAE WERE CAPTURED DURING ELECTROFISHING.  ANALYSIS OF SCALE SAMPLES SHOWED FOUR AGE 1 FISH, FOUR AGE 7, AND ONE AGE 9. GROWTH WAS ABOVE AVERAGE FOR THE FIRST YEAR OF LIFE AND BELOW AVERAGE FOR ALL SUCCEEDING YEARS.  ELEVEN LMB WERE CAPTURED BY ELECTROFISHING AND SEINING, REPRESENTING AGES 0,1, 2,3,5, AND 7.  GROWTH WAS ABOVE AVERAGE FOR THE FIRST SIX YEARS AND BELOW AVERAGE FOR THE SEVENTH. ELEVEN HSF AND SIX PMK WERE SAMPLED IN THE GILLNETS AND TRAPNETS.  BLC WERE CAPTURED IN NUMBERS SLIGHTLY ABOVE THE LOCAL MEDIAN FOR GILLNETS, BUT ONLY 0.3 TIMES THE LOCAL MEDIAN FOR TRAPNETS.  ONE BLB AND TWO GOS WERE SAMPLED IN TRAPNETS.  SEINING ALSO CAPTURED SPO AND GSF.</p>",

There is a DNR Parks and Trails-operated concrete boat launch on the north shore of the lake.  The lake is primarily managed as a Walleye fishery.  In 2014, a population assessment was conducted to determine the composition and abundance of game fish present.   <br> \n <br> \nWalleye and Northern Pike were sampled in low abundance; both species were caught at a rate of 0.67 fish per gill net, both below the 25th percentiles for this lake type.  Most of the sampled Walleye originated from the 2011 fingerling stocking; the average size of Walleye was 13.9 inches and 0.88 pounds.  Northern Pike, on the other hand, tended to be large-sized.  The average size of Northern Pike was 28.5 inches and 4.89 pounds.  The largest sampled Pike was 34.7 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nBluegill are abundant in the lake.  In 2014, they were caught at a rate of 67.4 fish per trap net (above the 75th percentile for this Lake Class).  Forty-three percent of sampled fish exceeded 7 inches, and the largest Bluegill measured 8.2 inches.  The average size of Bluegill in Fish Lake is 6.8 inches and 0.23 pounds.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie and Yellow Perch were sampled at below-median levels for this type of lake.  Black Crappie were sampled at a rate of 4.3 per gill net (between 25th percentile and median), and the average size was 8.4 inches and 0.31 pounds.  Yellow Perch were sampled at a rate of 2.2 per gill net (just above 25th percentile), with an average size of 7.2 inches and 0.15 pounds.   <br> \n <br> \nYellow Bullhead were sampled near median levels (2.3 fish/ gill net, 1.1 fish/ trap net), and displayed good size.  Seventy-eight percent of the gill net sample exceeded 9 inches, and the largest fish measured 13.2 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nOther fish sampled in low abundance were Common Carp, Golden Shiners, Green Sunfish, Hybrid Sunfish, Largemouth Bass, Pumpkinseed, White Crappie, and White Sucker.   <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Fish Lake is 176-acres, with a maximum depth of 28 feet. Fish is located southwest of the City of Prior Lake, in central Scott County. Public access is provided by a DNR-owned boat ramp located on the northwest side of the lake. Fish is primarily managed for Walleye, but includes catchable populations of Largemouth Bass, Bluegill, and Black Crappie. Management includes scheduled Walleye fingerling stocking in odd-numbered years at a rate of 1 pounds per littoral acre (74 pounds), with other sizes/ages/amounts substituted if insufficient fingerlings are available. A Standard Survey (gill nets, trap nets, and spring electrofishing) was conducted on Fish Lake during the week of 6/24/2019 to assess the fishery. During the survey, water clarity was poor with 2.75 feet of visibility, with low oxygen below 16 feet. Fish Lake in Scott County is one of the few lakes in the metro area free of aquatic invasive species. <br> \n <br> \nGood numbers of Walleye were sampled in 2019, with a gill net catch of 4.3/net. There were 26 Walleye sampled in gill nets, with an average size of 14.2 inches and the largest measured at 22.2 inches. Walleye growth in Fish was modest compared to the statewide average, indicated by an average length of 9.5 inches by age 2, and 19.8 inches by age 5. Due to above average catch rates and sizes, Fish Lake provides decent Walleye angling potential. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass were sampled during spring 2019 with nighttime boat electrofishing, the first time such a survey was conducted here. Catch rates were high, with 75.3 fish/hour. Largemouth Bass averaged 13.0 inches, with the largest measured at 20.8 inches. Greater than 50% of the 113 bass sampled were larger than 13 inches. Despite high numbers, bass continue to reach large sizes desirable to anglers.  <br> \n <br> \nBluegill were sampled at above average numbers (47.8/net), compared to similar lakes in the area. There were 430 Bluegill sampled in trap nets during the 2019 survey, with an average length of 6.9 and the largest measured at 8.5 inches. Despite few fish (2%) greater than 8 inches, the majority of sampled Bluegill (59%) were greater than 7 inches, providing excellent angling opportunity. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie were sampled at high rates (10.0/net) in gill nets and very low rates (0.2/net) in trap nets, suggesting crappie may be using more off-shore habitat in Fish Lake. There were 62 Black Crappie sampled during the 2019 survey, with an average length of 7.8 inches, and the largest measured at 9.9 inches. <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species sampled in low abundances were Golden Shiner, Green Sunfish, Northern Pike, Pumpkinseed, White Crappie, White Sucker, Yellow Bullhead, and Yellow Perch. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Fish Lake contains a quality walleye fishery, especially for a small metropolitan lake. The population exceeds the average level when comparing similar lakes. The average size walleye sampled was 16.7 inches long and weighed 2.0 pounds. Walleyes up to 27.0 inches in length were measured. The northern pike population is currently at the lowest point recorded since 1975. However the size of the pike remaining is very respectable. The average size fish sampled was 28.7 inches long and weighed 5.5 pounds. The largest northern pike measured was approximately 32.0 inches in length.Bluegill were very abundant. Their population exceeds the range that is considered average for this type of lake. The average length measured during the survey was 6.0 inches. Over 20% of all the bluegills measured were longer than 7 inches.Both black and white crappies were of average abundance in Fish Lake. A larger sample was obtained in the trapnets. The average size of both species was 7.8 inches in length. One black crappie measured 14.4 inches.Largemouth bass were not targeted during the summer portion of the survey and as a result only one was sampled in the trapnets. Shoreline seining was somewhat effective at sampling the bass population with 20 being captured during the fall portion of the survey.Pumpkinseed sunfish were sampled within their normal range for this lake. Their average length was only 5.5 inches. The largest pumpkinseed sampled was 6.6 inches in length.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Fish lake is a productive 171 acre lake in Scott County.  It feeds, via a creek on the north end, into Spring Lake.  A fish barrier constructed in 1988 has eliminated carp migration from Spring Lake.  Fish Lake offers a quality multispecies fishery with points and bars to fish by boat, however, shorefishing opportunites are somewhat limited. Walleye is the primary management species in Fish Lake.  Walleye are less abundant, larger, and older than they were in the 1997 survey, at which time abundance was at historical highs.  The catch of 3.6 per gillnet is between 50th and 75th percentile levels for this lake type.  The population is strongly represented by the 1999 and 1997 year-classes stocked as fingerlings/adults.  Average length and weight is 22.0 inches and 4.1 pounds.  Seventy-two percent of walleye were longer than 20 inches.  The largest individual was 27.4 inches and 7.9 pounds.  The average walleye is 6.6 years old.  Growth rates are above average this lake type.Bluegill abundance is at its highest level since the 1949 survey.  The trapnet catch was 115 per net, which is nearly twice the 75th percentile level.  Average size has increased since 1997 to 6.6 inches and 0.37 pounds.  One in three is longer than 7 inches.  The largest bluegill captured was 7.7 inches and 0.3 pounds.  Growth rates are below average for this lake type.  Shoreline seine hauls yielded 204 young-of-the year indicating successful reproduction.  Hybrid, pumpkinseed, and green sunfish were also sampled in trapnets.Largemouth bass are not well sampled in survey nets, only 1 was caught in a gillnet.  Five young-of-the-year were caught in seine hauls.  Anglers report a quality fishery with catches good in both numbers and size.Northern pike are Fish's most abundant predator species sampled in survey nets.  Pike are slightly more abundant and smaller than they were in the 1997 survey.  The catch of 4.6 per gillnet is between 50th and 75th percentile levels for this lake type.  Average length and weight is 27.9 inches and 5.6 pounds.  Over 75% are longer than 28 inches.  The largest individual sampled was 37.7 inches and 12.7 pounds.  The average age was 6.5 years.  Growth rates are about average for pike in this lake type.Black and white crappie size structure is excellent for a metro-area lake.  Crappie abundance decreased from 1997 while average size increased.  The 2003 catch of 4.1 black crappie per trapnet is between 50th and 75th percentile levels.  The 2003 trapnet sample average length and weight were 8.5 inches and 0.3 pounds while 6 in 10 were longer than 8 inches.  The largest individual sampled was 15.3 inches and 1.3 pounds.  Growth rates are above average.  White crappie abundance decreased to 0.7 per net, which is below 25th percentile levels.  The average length and weight were 8.6 inches and 0.3 pounds while 100% sampled were longer than 8 inches.  The largest individual white crappie sampled was 12.6 inches and 1.1 pounds (in a gillnet).  Growth rates are about average.  Yellow perch abundance has decreased since the 1997 survey while average size has increased.  The 2003 gillnet catch of 13 per net is between the 50th and 75th percentile levels.  Average length and weight is 7.7 inches and 0.2 pounds.  Growth rates are about average until age 4 then slow below average.Yellow bullhead exist in considerable number and size.  Yellow bullhead were sampled above 75th percentile levels at 9.6 per gillnet averaging 1.1 pounds.  Black bullhead, common carp and golden shiners also reside in Fish Lake.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Fish Lake is a 171 acre class 24 lake located south of Prior Lake, MN.  Water quality is poor.  Dissolved oxygen levels reflect this.  By mid-summer most species of fish cannot inhabit water deeper than 10 feet for extended periods of time.  Anglers should keep this in mind when pursuing walleye and crappie.  Fishing in water deeper than 10 feet in mid to late summer could yield few fish.  Much of the shoreline surrounding Fish Lake is undeveloped.  As a result, good near shore habitat is plentiful.   <br> \n <br> \nThe predator community in Fish Lake is similar to most west metro lakes.  Walleye, largemouth bass and northern pike are present.  Walleye average length was 13.5 inches.  Two young year classes are present and should reach desirable harvest size in 2011.  Stocking of walleye fingerlings occurred in both 2006 and 2007.  Northern pike numbers were average for this class of lake.  Weight of Fish Lake northern pike was above average.  Pike averaged 27 inches in length.  Individuals up 36 inches were sampled.  In the 2009 survey, largemouth bass abundance was high.  Largemouth bass averaged 7.5 inches.  Keep in mind standard lake survey gear does not consistently provide an accurate estimate of LMB abundance.    <br> \n <br> \nSix species of panfish are present in Fish Lake.  Black crappie abundance is below average.  Few large individuals were sampled, but the size structure is above average for a metro area lake.  Over 70% of sampled fish were larger than 8 inches, but only one individual was larger than 10 inches.  Bluegill abundance remains high.  Average weight increased slightly.  Over 80% of sampled bluegill were greater than 6 inches in length.  Nearly 35% of sampled bluegill were greater than 7 inches.  No fish larger than 8 inches were sampled.  Yellow perch abundance in Fish Lake is within the average range for a class 24 lake.  Mean weight of yellow perch was average.  White crappie are present in low numbers, but individuals sampled were large.  Pumpkinseed were sampled at an average abundance.  Hybrid sunfish were also sampled.   <br> \n <br> \nRough fish are present in above average numbers.  Overall common carp abundance is average.  Yellow bullhead numbers were also average.  Green sunfish abundance was high.    <br> \n</p>",
