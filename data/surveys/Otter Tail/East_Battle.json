The average weight of northern pike was 1.0 lbs. compared to 0.9 lbs. in 1986.  Northern pike aged I+ through VI+ were represented in the sample, indicating consistent reproduction.  <br> \n     Abundances of black bullheads, brown bullheads, and carp remain low.  <br> \n     Bluegill abundance has increased from approximately 35.0 per trap net lift in the 1976, 1983, and 1986 surveys to 50.4 per net.  Ten percent of the bluegills measured were greater than 7.0 inches, which is similar to previous surveys.        <br> \n      Largemouth bass abundance was 2.0 per gill net lift, a slight decrease from 2.6 per net in 1986, but over three times the area median. Reproduction appears excellent as ages I+ through III+ were represented in the sample and young of the year were captured in every seine haul.  <br> \n     Yellow perch abundance was 3.1 per gill net lift and continues to decline from previous surveys.  <br> \n     Walleye abundance has declined from 15.0 per gill net lift in 1986 to 6.9 per net, but remains above the area median. Average weight of walleye has decreased from 1.7 lbs. in 1986 to 1.4 lbs.  Age data for walleye indicates good reproduction, although no young-of-the-year were sampled in the seine hauls. The 1983 and 1985 year classes were present, which correspond to years of no stocking. Using expanded age data, it is estimated that approximately 30% of the walleyes sampled in this survey correspond to the 1985 year class. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>     East Battle Lake is a 1,949 acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located in south central Otter Tail County approximately two miles north of Vining, MN.  East Battle Lake is connected to West Battle Lake via Battle Lake Creek.  The immediate watershed is composed of agricultural land interspersed with hardwood woodlots.  The maximum depth is 87 feet; however, 35% of the lake is 15 feet or less in depth.  The shoreline length is 14.2 miles.  A public access is located off of County Highway 55 along the northwest shoreline.  The secchi disk reading, a standard measure of water clarity, was 8.5 feet.  Previous secchi disk readings have ranged from 4.5 to 12.3 feet.    <br> \n     A majority of the shoreline is developed with homes, cabins, and resorts. Sand and gravel compose a majority of the shoreline substrates.  The most abundant types of submerged aquatic plants are chara and variable pondweed.  The most common emergent aquatic plants are common cattail and hardstem bulrush. These emergent plants provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat and are critical in maintaining good water quality.  Emergent plants also provide critical spawning habitat for several fish species including northern pike, largemouth bass, and panfish.  They also serve as important nursery areas for many species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants cannot be removed without a DNR permit. <br> \n     East Battle Lake is a popular angling lake.  Northern pike, largemouth bass, walleye, and bluegill are the dominant gamefish species in the fish community of East Battle Lake.  The prolificacy of these species can be attributed to the abundance of suitable spawning habitat that is available.   <br> \n     A high density northern pike population exists.  The northern pike population has increased to historic highs in recent surveys.  Northern pike ranged in length from 10.0 to 33.9 inches with a mean length and weight of 17.4 inches and 1.2 pounds.  Northern pike size structure continues to be poor with only six percent of the pike measuring 24.0 inches or greater in length. Pike attain an average length of 18.6 inches at four years of age.       <br> \n     The bluegill test-net catch rate was within the normal range for this class of lake.  Age data from recent surveys indicate that bluegill reproduction is consistently good.  Bluegill size structure is also good as 37% of the bluegills were 7.0 inches or greater in length.  Bluegills attain an average length of 6.7 inches at seven years of age.  <br> \n     Catch data indicate that a high density largemouth bass population exists.  Largemouth bass ranged in length from 8.1 to 15.5 inches with a mean length and weight of 11.2 inches and 0.8 pounds.  Age data indicate that the 2005 year class is very strong.  Bass attain an average length of 12.3 inches at four years of age.   <br> \n     The walleye test-net catch rate was within the normal range for this class of lake.  Walleye ranged in length from 8.1 to 31.1 inches with a mean length and weight of 17.7 inches and 2.0 pounds.  Walleye attain an average length of 15.5 inches at four years of age. <br> \n     Anglers can help maintain the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large size fish while allowing the harvest of the more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future.      <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

IBI data was collected in conjunction with Minnesota Pollution Control Agency watershed sampling. Eight-teen 100-foot sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake shore, sampling a variety of habitat types.  Each site is sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot 1/8th-inch mesh seine, depending on habitat conditions.  Sites where habitat conditions did not allow for seining were backpack electrofished unless conditions proved difficult for walking. These sites were backpack shocked from the boat. Fifteen fish species were represented, including young of the year gamefish species such as Largemouth Bass. Non-game species sampled included Banded Killifish, Iowa Darter, and Johnny Darter. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>     East Battle Lake is a 1,949 acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located in south-central Otter Tail County approximately two miles north of Vining, MN.  East Battle Lake is connected to West Battle Lake via Battle Lake Creek.  The immediate watershed is composed of agricultural land interspersed with hardwood woodlots.  The maximum depth is 87 feet; however, 35% of the lake is 15 feet or less in depth.  The shoreline length is 14.2 miles.   The secchi disk reading during the 2021 survey was 12.3 feet.  Previous secchi disk readings have ranged from 4.5 to 12.3 feet.    <br> \n     A majority of the shoreline is developed with homes, cabins, and resorts. A DNR owned public access is located off of County Highway 55 along the northwest shoreline. Sand and gravel compose a majority of the shoreline substrates.  Large stands of hardstem bulrush and common cattail are scattered around the shoreline of the entire lake.  These emergent plants provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat and are critical in maintaining good water quality.  Emergent plants also provide critical spawning habitat for several fish species including Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, and Panfish.  They also serve as important nursery areas for many species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants cannot be removed without a DNR permit. <br> \n     East Battle Lake can be ecologically classified as a bass-panfish-Walleye type of lake and this is reflected in the assemblage of the fish community.  Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, Bluegill, and Walleye are the dominant gamefish species in the fish community.  The prolificacy of these species can be attributed to the abundance of suitable spawning habitat that is available.   <br> \n     A high density Northern Pike population exists.  Age data indicate that Northern Pike reproduction rates are consistently high.  As a result, Northern Pike size structure continues to be poor.  Pike ranged in length from 9.9 to 28.4 inches with a mean length and weight of 17.3 inches and 1.1 pounds.  Pike attain an average length of 18.3 inches at four years of age.       <br> \n      A high density Largemouth Bass population also exists.  Age data indicate that Largemouth Bass reproduction is consistently good.  Largemouth Bass ranged in length from 6.5 to 15.3 inches with an average length and weight of 11.9 inches and 1.1 pounds.  Bass attain an average length of 11.4 inches at four years of age.   <br> \n     The Bluegill population is moderately abundant with consistently good reproduction.  Twenty-four percent of the Bluegills were 7.0 inches or greater in length, while 4% were 8.0 inches or greater in length.  Bluegills attain an average length of 7.0 inches at seven years of age. <br> \n     Walleye abundance has remained stable.  Walleyes ranged in length from 8.4 to 26.9 inches with an average length and weight of 17.1 inches and 1.9 pounds.  Walleyes attain an average length of 16.3 inches at four years of age. <br> \n     Anglers can help maintain the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large size fish while allowing the harvest of the more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future.      <br> \n     East Battle Lake was listed as infested with zebra mussels in 2019.   Aquatic invasive species are threatening Minnesota waters.  The non-native species can potentially harm water quality, water recreation, aquatic habitat, native species, and fish populations.  Anglers can help prevent the introduction and spread of invasive species by following watercraft transportation laws.    <br> \n</p>",

The average size of walleye remained the same at 1.8 lbs.  Aging data indicates a moderately strong 1981 year class, which was a skip year in the stocking sequence.  Strong 1982 and 1980 year classes may provide evidence that fingerlings stocking supplements natural reproduction in some years.  \n     The abundance of northern pike declined slightly from the 1979 survey with a gill net catch rate of 10.0 per net.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>East Battle Lake is a 2,360-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located in south-central Otter Tail County, approximately two miles north of Vining, MN.  East Battle Lake is connected to West Battle Lake via Battle Lake Creek.  The immediate watershed is composed of agricultural land interspersed with hardwood woodlots.  The maximum depth is 87 feet; however, 35% of the lake is 15 feet or less in depth.  The shoreline length is 14.2 miles.  The secchi disk reading, a standard measure of water clarity, was 7.7 feet.  Previous secchi disk readings have ranged from 4.5 to 12.3 feet.  East Battle Lake is included in lake class 22 of the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources' (DNR) lake classification scheme.      A majority of the shoreline is developed with homes, cabins, and resorts.  Development is distributed around the entire lake and has been shown to negatively impact water quality by increasing nutrient inputs and shoreline erosion. A public access is located off of County Highway 55 along the northwest shoreline.  Lakeshore owners can minimize their impacts on the lake by following best management practices (BMP's) and \"lakescaping\" guidelines.  Information on BMP's is available from the County Extension Office, and the local DNR Area Fisheries Office can provide assistance on lakescaping techniques.     Sand and gravel compose a majority of the shoreline substrates.  The most abundant types of submerged aquatic plants are chara (also called sand grass) and variable pondweed.  The most common emergent aquatic plants are common cattail and hardstem bulrush. These emergent plants provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat and are critical in maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms from wave erosion and help absorb excess nutrients.  Emergent plants also provide critical spawning habitat for several fish species including northern pike, largemouth bass and panfish.  They also serve as important nursery areas for many species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants cannot be removed without a DNR permit.     East Battle Lake is a popular angling lake.  Northern pike, largemouth bass, walleye, and bluegill are the dominant gamefish species in the fish community of East Battle Lake.  The prolificacy of these species can be attributed to the abundance of suitable spawning habitat that is available.       An experimental regulation for northern pike was implemented in 1997 and will remain in effect until 2007.  The regulation stipulates that all pike 22.0 inches or greater in length must be released.  The objective of the regulation is to improve the size structure of the northern pike population.     The northern pike test-net catch rate was equivalent to the upper limit of the expected range for class 22 lakes.  Age data from recent surveys indicate that northern pike reproduction is consistently good.  Despite the experimental regulation, northern pike size structure continues to be poor.  Northern pike ranged in length from 8.5 to 28.5 inches with a mean length and weight of 16.6 inches and 1.0 pounds.  Only four percent of the pike were 24.0 inches or greater in length.  Northern pike growth is slow.  Pike attain an average length of 15.9 inches at five years of age.  The low abundance of yellow perch, a preferred forage fish, may be limiting northern pike growth.     Test-net catch data from recent surveys indicate that a high-density largemouth bass population exists.  The test-net catch rates for largemouth bass have consistently exceeded the expected range.  Bass ranged in length from 8.3 to 15.4 inches with a mean length of 11.1 inches.  Largemouth bass attain an average length of 12.7 inches at four years of age.     The bluegill test-net catch rate was within the expected range.  Age data from recent surveys indicate that bluegill reproduction is consistently good.  Twenty-six percent of the bluegill were 7.0 inches or greater in length.  Bluegill attain an average length of 7.0 inches at seven years of age.     East Battle Lake is stocked with 825,000 walleye fry on a biennial basis.  The walleye gill net catch rate was 6.3 per net, which is within the expected range for lake class 22.  Walleye from the gill net sample ranged in length from 8.9 to 27.3 inches with an average length and weight of 16.9 inches and 1.9 pounds.  Age data from recent surveys indicate that walleye stocking is supplementing natural reproduction.  The 1996, 1998, and 1999 year classes appear to be strong and should provide good walleye fishing for several years.  Walleye attain an average length of 15.4 inches at four years of age.     Data from recent test-netting assessments indicate that the success of walleye natural reproduction can be substantial in some years; however, it does not occur consistently.  Besides walleye, the DNR does not stock any other fish species in East Battle Lake.  The other species present are able to sustain their levels at or above management goals without stocking.  This is an indication of the excellent fish habitat and water quality that is available.      Anglers can also maintain the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large-size fish while allowing the harvest of the more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future.     </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>     East Battle Lake is a 1,949 acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located in south-central Otter Tail County approximately two miles north of Vining, MN.  East Battle Lake is connected to West Battle Lake via Battle Lake Creek.  The immediate watershed is composed of agricultural land interspersed with hardwood woodlots.  The maximum depth is 87 feet; however, 35% of the lake is 15 feet or less in depth.  The shoreline length is 14.2 miles.   The secchi disk reading was 9.5 feet.  Previous secchi disk readings have ranged from 4.5 to 12.3 feet.    <br> \n     A majority of the shoreline is developed with homes, cabins, and resorts. A DNR owned public access is located off of County Highway 55 along the northwest shoreline. Sand and gravel compose a majority of the shoreline substrates.  The most abundant types of submerged aquatic plants are chara and variable pondweed.  The most common emergent aquatic plants are common cattail and hardstem bulrush. These emergent plants provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat and are critical in maintaining good water quality.  Emergent plants also provide critical spawning habitat for several fish species including Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, and Panfish.  They also serve as important nursery areas for many species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants cannot be removed without a DNR permit. <br> \n     East Battle Lake is a popular angling lake.  Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, Walleye, and Bluegill are the dominant gamefish species in the fish community of East Battle Lake.  The prolificacy of these species can be attributed to the abundance of suitable spawning habitat that is available.   <br> \n     A high density Northern Pike population exists.  The Northern Pike population has increased to historic highs in recent surveys.  Northern Pike ranged in length from 12.6 to 25.8 inches with a mean length and weight of 18.0 inches and 1.2 pounds.   Northern Pike size structure continues to be poor.  No Northern Pike over 26.0 inches were sampled.  Pike attain an average length of 18.8 inches at four years of age.       <br> \n     A moderate density Bluegill population exists.  Twenty-seven percent of the Bluegills were 7.0 inches or greater in length.  Bluegills attain an average length of 7.0 inches at five years of age.   <br> \n    Catch data indicate that a moderate to high density Largemouth Bass population exists.  Largemouth Bass ranged in length from 8.6 to 15.6 inches with an average length and weight of 11.9 inches and 1.0 pounds.  Age data indicate that the 2014 and 2015 year classes are very strong.  Bass attain an average length of 13.9 inches at four years of age.   <br> \n     The Walleye test-net catch rate was slightly below the normal range for this class of lake.  Walleye ranged in length from 9.3 to 26.1 inches with an average length and weight of 18.9 inches and 2.4 pounds.  Walleye attain an average length of 17.0 inches at four years of age. <br> \n     Anglers can help maintain the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large size fish while allowing the harvest of the more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future.      <br> \n      East Battle Lake is not listed as an infested water.  Aquatic invasive species are threatening Minnesota waters.  The non-native species can potentially harm water quality, water recreation, aquatic habitat, native species, and fish populations.  Anglers can help prevent the introduction and spread of invasive species by following watercraft transportation laws.  Anglers are required to remove all visible plants, mud, and other prohibited invasive species and drain all water from their boat prior to leaving the water access.     <br> \n   </p>",

The yellow perch catch rate is above the state median but below the local median. A high predator population may have some influence on this downward trend of the perch population.  <br> \n     Northern pike catch rates have remained relatively stable since the 1976 survey with only a slight increase in numbers and average weight.   The bluegill population has remained stable since 1976, with a slight increase in average weight.  The walleye catch rate indicates a substantial increase in abundance since the 1983 survey, while still maintaining the same average weight. Walleye year classes are well represented even in the non-stocked years.  The age II+, IV+, and VII+ classes are very strong year classes. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>East Battle Lake is a moderately fertile, 2,360 acre lake in central Otter Tail County.  The lake has a north and a south basin that are separated by a narrow straight.  The  maximum depth of the lake is 87 feet, and occurs in the south basin.  The secchi depth measured 10 ft. during the 1999 survey, indicating good water clarity.  Residents on the lake can help to protect water quality by properly maintaining septic systems, by using lawn fertilizers that do not contain phosphorous, and by maintaining a buffer of shoreline vegetation.  Several streams feed into the lake, including a stream that flows from Stuart Lake to the south.  The lake outlets to Battle Lake Creek, which in turn connects to West Battle Lake.  There is a public access on the north side of the lake off of Ottertail County Road 55.     There is considerable development of the shoreline of the lake by cabins and resorts.  There are remnant stands of hardstem bullrush and wild rice on the lake that are protected by law from removal along with all other aquatic plants due to their importance as habitat for many fish and wildlife species.  Landowners must obtain a permit from the DNR before removing any emergent aquatic vegetation.  Only by protecting  habitats that are important to fish for spawning and nurseries can a quality fishery exist.  This lake has also been colonized by an invasive and non-native aquatic plant called purple loosestrife.  Although its flowers are attractive, this plant is very harmful in the shoreline habitats where it grows.  Purple loosestrife crowds out native plants that are important sources of food for waterfowl, but has no food value of its own.  The DNR has instituted an experimental biological control method on East Battle Lake by releasing beetles that prefer to feed on purple loosestrife.  Landowners can help protect native plants and prevent the spread of loosestrife to other areas by pulling any of the plants that they find.  Contact the DNR for help with identification.     East Battle Lake supports good numbers of walleye, northern pike, and largemouth bass.  Panfish present include bluegill, black crappie, pumpkinseed, and rock bass.  Tullibee and yellow perch are also present, along with several species of non-game fish.     Walleye averaged 7.4 per gill net lift in 1999, which is above average for lakes of its type.  This is consistent with the 1996 survey that averaged 5.5 walleye per net lift, but down from 11.1 per net in 1992.  Walleye from this survey averaged 16.7 inches and 1.69 pounds, with the largest individual measuring 28.4 inches.  Walleye growth is good, with fish averaging 13.3 inches at age 3, and 15.6 inches at age 4.  Natural reproduction consistently contributes to the population, and 825,000 walleye fry are stocked every other year by the DNR to help maintain the fishery.     Northern pike averaged 8.6 per gill net lift, which is well above average for lakes similar to East Battle.  Pike numbers have basically remained unchanged from previous surveys.  The typical size of pike is small, averaging about 1 pound.  Growth is slow for this type of lake; pike averaged 16 inches at age 3, and 21.3 inches at age 5.  The largest individual was 31.7 inches in length.  Northern pike natural reproduction is consistently good in the lake.     An experimental regulation was put in  place on East Battle Lake beginning in 1997 to improve northern pike size.  All pike 22 in. and greater must be released. The goal of the regulation is to provide a northern pike population with 35% 22 inches or greater using spring trap net assessments as the indexing gear. Pike size structure and growth rates will continue to be monitored with spring trap net assessments in 2000 and 2002.     Largemouth bass averaged 3.9 per gill net lift, which is significantly higher than average for lakes of this type.  Largemouth bass are not readily captured by gill nets, and so they tend to underestimate bass populations.  A high catch suggests good numbers of bass are present.  Larger bass are also under-represented in gill nets, so it is possible that there are larger bass present than were seen in the survey.  Bass averaged 10.9 inches and 0.8 lbs., with the largest individual measuring 15.2 inches.  Natural reproduction appears consistently good.     Bluegills averaged 17.4 per trap net, which is average when compared to similar lakes.  This is also consistent with catches from previous surveys.  Average size is not large, with a mean length of 5.4 inches, and only 9% of the fish were over 7 inches.  Bluegills reach an average of 6.5 inches at age 7, which is slower than most lakes of this type.  Reproduction is somewhat inconsistent.     Black crappie catches averaged 0.7 in gill nets and 0.5 in trap nets.  These are average values for lakes of this type, and typical of previous catches from the lake.  Growth is good; crappie average 8.3 inches at age 3, and 10.1 inches at age 4.  Reproduction appears consistently good.     Yellow perch numbers are lower than in previous surveys, averaging 1.5 per gill net lift.  This is lower than expected for this type of lake.  Average size was 7 inches, with 23% of the fish over 8 inches, and 5% over 10 inches.     Tullibee numbers are up from previous surveys, averaging 1.2 per gill net lift.  This is about average for lakes of this type.  Tullibee averaged 14.3 inches, 89% were greater than 12 inches, and 44% were greater than 15 inches.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>East Battle Lake is a 1,949-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located in south-central Otter Tail County, approximately two miles north of Vining, MN.  East Battle Lake is connected to West Battle Lake via Battle Lake Creek.  The immediate watershed is composed of agricultural land interspersed with hardwood woodlots.  The maximum depth is 87 feet; however, 35% of the lake is 15 feet or less in depth.  The shoreline length is 14.2 miles.  The secchi disk reading, a standard measure of water clarity, was 8.2 feet in 2005.  Previous secchi disk readings have ranged from 4.5 to 12.3 feet.  East Battle Lake is included in class 22 of the MN DNR lake classification scheme.      A majority of the shoreline is developed with homes, cabins, and resorts.  Development is distributed around the entire lake and has been shown to negatively impact water quality by increasing nutrient inputs and shoreline erosion. A public access is located off of County Highway 55 along the northwest shoreline.  Lakeshore owners can minimize their impacts on the lake by following best management practices (BMP's) and \"lakescaping\" guidelines.  Information on BMP's is available from the County Extension Office, and the local DNR Area Fisheries Office can provide assistance on lakescaping techniques.     Sand and gravel compose a majority of the shoreline substrates.  The most abundant types of submerged aquatic plants are chara (also called sand grass) and variable pondweed.  The most common emergent aquatic plants are common cattail and hardstem bulrush. These emergent plants provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat and are critical in maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms from wave erosion and help absorb excess nutrients.  Emergent plants also provide critical spawning habitat for several fish species including northern pike, largemouth bass and panfish.  They also serve as important nursery areas for many species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants cannot be removed without a DNR permit. East Battle Lake contains areas of Purple Loosestrife, an exotic, invasive shoreline plant that can out compete native species like cattail and bulrush.     East Battle Lake is a popular angling lake.  Northern pike, largemouth bass, walleye, and bluegill are the dominant gamefish species in the fish community of East Battle Lake.  The prolificacy of these species can be attributed to the abundance of suitable spawning habitat that is available.       An experimental regulation for northern pike was implemented in 1997 and will remain in effect until 2008.  The regulation stipulates that all pike 22.0 inches or greater in length must be released.  The objective of the regulation is to improve the size structure of the northern pike population.     The northern pike test-net catch rate increased from the previous survey and now exceeds the upper limit of the expected range for class 22 lakes.  Age data from recent surveys indicate that northern pike reproduction is consistently good.  Despite the experimental regulation, northern pike size structure continues to be poor.  Northern pike ranged in length from 10.3 to 33.9 inches with a mean length and weight of 17.4 inches and 1.2 pounds.  Only four percent of the pike were 24.0 inches or greater in length in 2005.  Northern pike growth is slow.  The low abundance of yellow perch, a preferred forage fish, may be limiting northern pike growth.     Data from a spring electrofishing assessment indicate that a high-density largemouth bass population exists.  Bass ranged in length from 8.1 to 17.8 inches with an average length of 10.5 inches.  Bass attain an average length of 11.9 inches at four years of age.     The bluegill test-net catch rate was within the expected range.  Age data from recent surveys indicate that bluegill reproduction is consistently good.  Eleven percent of the bluegill were 7.0 inches or greater in length.  Bluegill attain an average length of 6.7 inches at seven years of age.     East Battle Lake is stocked with 825,000 walleye fry on a biennial basis.  The walleye test-net catch rate was within the expected range for lake class 22.  Walleye ranged in length from 11.2 to 24.2 inches with an average length and weight of 17.7 inches and 1.9 pounds.  Age data from recent surveys indicate that walleye stocking is supplementing natural reproduction.  The 1998, 1999, and 2002 year classes appear to be strong and should provide good walleye fishing for several years.  Walleye attain an average length of  15.6 inches at four years of age.        Data from recent test-netting assessments indicate that the success of walleye natural reproduction can be substantial in some years; however, it does not occur consistently.  In addition to DNR stocking, the East Battle Lake Association has purchased and stocked fingerling and yearling walleye and adult yellow perch in East Battle Lake.  Besides walleye, the DNR does not stock any other fish species in East Battle Lake.  The other species present are able to sustain their levels at or above management goals without stocking.  This is an indication of the excellent fish habitat and water quality that is available.      Anglers can also maintain the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large-size fish while allowing the harvest of the more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future.     </p>",
