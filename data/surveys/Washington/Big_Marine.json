                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of the nearshore fish community on Big Marine Lake was conducted the week of August 20th, 2018 by East Metro Fisheries staff. Sampling stations were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at all 18 stations and seining occurred at 11 of the 18 stations. Nearshore sampling captured 18 native species of fish. Bluntnose Minnows were the most abundant species sampled by both gear types in the 2018 IBI.  <br> \n <br> \nData from this targeted nearshore survey is combined with data from a standard gill and trap netting survey in early August 2018 to calculate a Fish-based Index of Biologic Integrity (FIBI) score that describes the overall health of the lake. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment.  The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. The FIBI score of 40 for Big Marine Lake based on this survey is below the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes.  Data from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Lower Saint Croix Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency. For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website. <br> \n</p>",

The focus of management of the lake has been walleye, with the population maintained by stocking on an every other year basis.  Walleye were sampled at their highest level, nearly 7/gillnet.  Fish from the last seven stocking years were present.  Sizes ranged from 10 to 28 inches.  Northern pike were present in high numbers, more than 3 times as abundant as walleye.  No fish were older than 5.  Few fish were over 25 inches long.  Largemouth bass were captured in nets in high numbers with a few older, larger fish sampled.  Although no electrofishing was done in order to properly sample the bass population, the net catch indicates that largemouth bass are abundant, with a variety of ages present.  Bluegill numbers were near historic highs.  Bluegill were long-lived and slow growing, with some fish 11 years old and a maximum size of 7.40 inches.  Black crappie were present in moderate numbers with 10% of the fish at least 10 inches long.  Growth was slower than average.  Pumpkinseed and hybrid sunfish were present in moderate numbers with some hybrid sunfish nearly 8 inches.  Yellow perch were present in low numbers with most fish small in size.  Yellow bullhead were present in moderate numbers with some individuals over 14 inches long.  White sucker, brown bullhead, and black bullhead were captured in low numbers.</p>",

Currently, the MN PCA lists Big Marine Lake on the Impaired Waters List.  Concentrations of mercury in fish tissue exceed the water quality standard.  One bay on Big Marine Lake is listed as impaired for aquatic recreation.  Jellums Bay is not always suitable for swimming and wading due to low clarity or excessive algae caused by the presence of nutrients such as phosphorus in the water (MN PCA).     <br> \n <br> \n Development is evident along much of the shoreline surrounding Big Marine Lake. Despite houses and docks around most of the lake, both emergent and floating leaf vegetation and coarse woody debris are still present near shore in areas.  These natural habitats are critical to maintaining a diverse, native fish community.  The land use immediately surrounding Big Marine Lake is a mix of light residential development, agriculture, wetland and patches of forest.   <br> \n <br> \nA fish IBI survey was conducted from 8/25-8/26/2014 to assess populations of non-game species and young-of-the-year sport fish using a backpack electrofisher at 18 sites and bag seines at 9 sites. This sampling protocol is part of a watershed assessment tool that is being developed in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency. <br> \n <br> \nNear shore sampling collected the following species of fish: blackchin shiner, banded killifish, black crappie, bluegill, bluntnose minnow, blacknose shiner, golden shiner, green sunfish, hybrid sunfish, Iowa darter, Johnny darter, largemouth bass, northern pike, pumpkinseed, spotfin shiner, spottail shiner, walleye, yellow bullhead and yellow perch. <br> \n <br> \nThis survey was conducted by IBI Program Staff. <br> \n</p>",

The goal of this regulation on Big Marine Lake is to protect the quality size structure of Bluegill in the lake. Nine trap nets were set on May 11, 2021 and lifted on May 12, 2021 catching a total of 242 Bluegill. Bluegill ranged in size from 3.2 inches up to 9.8 inches in length, with an average size of 8.0 inches. Aging structures (otoliths) were collected from 95 Bluegill. The largest number of fish were found to be from 2012 (9 years old). The oldest Bluegill sampled in 2021 was determined to be from the 2007 year-class, making it 14 years old. The size structure of Bluegill in Big Marine Lake is quite good compared to many other Metro-area lakes with 90% of the fish sampled measuring 7 inches or larger. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Big Marine Lake is a 1,799 acre moderately fertile, class 24 lake located in northern Washington County. Water quality is considered suitable for swimming and wading, with good clarity and low algae levels throughout the open water season. Big Marine Regional Park Reserve, operated by Washington County, was opened in 2008 and provides a swimming beach, a boat launch with parking for 33 vehicle/trailer units, and a fishing pier. This is a popular park and attracted around 138,000 visitors in 2016. The DNR has two boat access sites, one of which is suitable only for small craft. There is also a Veterans Campground on Big Marine Lake that has a family campground that provides facilities and opportunities for recreation, rest, and well-being for all who have served in the Armed Forces of the United States, whether still serving or have served in the past, their families, and sponsored friends. This facility includes a boat access, campground, swimming area and support facilities. Big Marine Lake is primarily managed for Walleye and Largemouth Bass, with Black Crappie and Bluegill as secondary management species. Beginning in 2017 Walleye fingerlings were stocked annually at a rate of either 1.0 or 0.65 pounds per littoral-acre (1,152 and 749 pounds respectively).  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye in this survey ranged from 11 to 23 inches long with most in the 14-17 inch size range. Aged Walleye were found to be from seven different years with the oldest fish being eleven years old (2009 year class). The largest number of fish in the gill nets were age three and four (2016 and 2017 year classes) and should provide quality fishing opportunities in the years ahead. The Northern Pike numbers were abnormally high and typical of Big Marine Lake. The average size pike measured 15.5 inches which is nearly identical to the past two surveys. The largest individual Pike sampled measured 28 inches. Surveys conducted in the last 10 years continue to show a problematic and overabundant Northern Pike population and are indicative of an unbalanced Northern Pike population in terms of numbers and of size structure, and are well below generally accepted range for a balanced Northern Pike population in terms of size structure. The new Northern Pike zone regulations which went into effect in 2018 allow a harvest on Big Marine Lake of 10 pike, with two over 26 inches in length, and a protected slot between 22 and 26 inches. This new regulation may be able to help shift this poor size structure if anglers begin to harvest higher numbers of the fish under 22 inches long.  Yellow Perch numbers were low in 2020 and similar to past surveys. Black Crappie were moderately abundant and averaged approximately eight inches long. Bluegill are moderately abundant and the size structure was better than past surveys with the average size over seven inches long in the gill net catch. Past Bluegill aging revealed that it takes between five and seven years to grow a seven inch Bluegill in Big Marine Lake. An underutilized fish, the Yellow Bullhead population is above average in numbers and size with many memorable sized fish present in the population. The Largest Yellow Bullhead sampled was over 14 inches. Large Black and Brown Bullheads are also present in Big Marine with 14 to 15 inch fish available but at lower abundances than Yellow Bullhead. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Bluegills were the most abundant species sampled during the assessment. Their numbers were within the normal range for this type of lake. Lengths ranged from 2.5 to 8.0 inches. Walleyes were sampled in numbers below average. The walleyes sampled averaged over 20 inches and 3 pounds. Northern pike abundance is high. Their numbers are well above average for this type of lake. Conditions for high pike reproduction have been common recently. The average size pike in the lake is  over 21 inches in length and weighs over 2 pounds. Northern pike exceeding 37 inches were sampled. Black crappie numbers remain variable. This species has frequent boom and bust cycles. This assessment found black crappies in low abundance. The size structure was skewed to the small side. The average length was only 5.5 inches from the gill nets. Individuals up to 13.3 inches were captured. Largemouth bass, while normally not sampled effectively in nets, were found to be abundant. Anglers have reported good catches of largemouth bass from this lake. More intensive sampling is planned for Big Marine Lake to gain a better understanding of the fish populations.   </p>",

The gill net catch of 2.38/set is an increase over the 2006 walleye catch. The walleyes sampled averaged 18.24 inches in length and 2.55 pounds. A total of 1152 lbs of walleye are stocked biennially. Northern pike were sampled at 16.38/set, which is the fourth highest gill net catch rate. This species continues to have a high population in Big Marine Lake. Conditions for high northern pike reproduction have been common recently. The average size pike in the lake is 19.92 inches and 1.72 pounds. Largemouth bass, while normally not sampled effectively in nets, were found in high abundance. Anglers have reported good catches of largemouth bass from this lake. Forage species such as yellow perch and white sucker continue to be found in low abundance. Bluegills were sampled in good abundance. They averaged 5.87 inches in length. Black crappies were also found in good numbers. They averaged 9.28 inches in the spring sample. Individuals over 12 inches were caught. Black and brown bullheads were found in low numbers, while yellow bullhead were found in average numbers. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of nearshore fish species in Big Marine Lake was conducted on July 22nd, 2019 by Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program Staff.  Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible.  Backpack electrofishing was completed at 18 sampling stations, but six stations were sampled from the boat due to site conditions.  Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample seven stations, a 15-foot seine was used at four stations, and site conditions prevented the use of seines at seven stations.  Nearshore sampling captured 19 species of fish including four species that are intolerant of disturbance (Blackchin Shiner, Banded Killifish, Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter) and one that is tolerant of disturbance (Green Sunfish). <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore data were combined with trap net and gill net data from the week of August 8th, 2018 survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based IBI (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment.  In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g. Blackchin Shiners, Banded Killifish, Blacknose Shiners), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g. Green Sunfish, Common Carp, Fathead Minnows).  The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake.  For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.   <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Lower St. Croix River Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.</p>",

White sucker, yellow bullhead, northern pike, walleye, and hybrid sunfish were sampled at above local median numbers.  Largemouth bass were also sampled and natural reproduction determined by shoreline seining.  Big Marine is locally known as a good bass fishing lake.  Northern pike numbers are down only slightly from 1979 netting and the size distribution is somewhat improved.  The very high water levels since 1968 have created ideal conditions for northern pike spawning.  Walleyes sampled are the result of stocking, with the largest group representing the 1982 fingerling stocking.  The low yellow perch numbers are probably due to the high number of predators, especially northern pike.From 1951 to 1979 (four nettings), bluegill, pumpkinseed, and black crappie had shown lower trapnet catches during each successive netting.  Bluegill numbers in this netting show a significant increase to near local median levels, while pumpkinseed and black crappie show slight increases over the 1979 low numbers.  The percentage of bluegills over 6.0 inches in length is higher than for 1979.  The average size of black crappies has improved since 1979 as well.Yellow bullhead have increased dramatically since 1979, but the average size is good and should be acceptable to anglers.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Big Marine Lake is 1,756 acres in size with 1,152 acres of littoral area and a maximum depth of 60 feet. This Washington County lake has been assigned to lake class 24 and provides anglers a solid option for targeting panfish, Walleye, Largemouth Bass and Northern Pike. Walleye and Largemouth Bass are the primary species of management with Northern Pike and Bluegill being the secondary species managed. Current stocking of Walleyes is at a rate of 1.0 pound/littoral acre in even numbered years. Walleyes were sampled above the median level for abundance and averaged 20.3 inches and 3.2 pounds. Approximately 56% of the Walleye sampled were at or above 20\" in total length. Due to the lake's clarity, targeting Walleye at night or in low-light conditions could produce more success for anglers. Northern Pike were sampled at a high abundance and averaged 17.5 inches and 1.1 pounds. Largemouth Bass abundance has increased from previous years and averaged just over 13 inches in length for bass sampled in gill nets. Electrofishing abundance has also increased to approximately 35 bass per hour captured. Bluegill were sampled at an abundance lower than the median level for trap nets and averaged 5.4 inches in total length. Approximately 16% of Bluegill sampled were at or above 7 inches. Black Crappie were also sampled at an abundance lower than the median level for trap nets and gill nets. The largest Black Crappie sampled was 11.8 inches in total length. Black Crappie growth is slow compared to statewide averages with 10-11 inch fish ranging in age from 7 years up to 12 years old. Black Bullheads, Brown Bullheads and Yellow Bullheads were sampled in both gears, as were Golden Shiners and Yellow Perch.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Big Marine Lake is a 1,799 acre, class 24 lake located in northern Washington County. Big Marine Lake is primarily managed for Walleye and Largemouth Bass, with Bluegill and Black Crappie as secondary management species.  Big Marine Lake had been stocked with Walleye fingerlings at a rate of 1.0 pounds/littoral acre (1,152 pounds) in even numbered years until 2016. However, the stocking plan has been altered to allow a better assessment of the effects of stocking rate and frequency on the Walleye population in Big Marine Lake. Beginning in 2017 Walleye fingerlings will be stocked annually at a rate of either 1.0 or 0.65 pounds per littoral-acre (1,152 and 749 pounds respectively). Big Marine was surveyed with gill nets in August and with night time electrofishing in May for Largemouth Bass. The previous survey was conducted in 2020.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye were sampled by gill nets at a rate of 1.3 fish per net. This is below the mean for the lake class and the lowest catch since the 2004 survey. The mid-range management goal of 2 fish per net is not being met. Mean size was typical for the lake class but slightly low relative to the history of the lake with an average length of 16.7 inches. Fish lengths ranged from 11.8 to 19.6 inches. Ages of those fish ranged from 2 to 8 years old and were fairly well distributed through that range.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike were sampled at a rate of 13.3 fish per gill net. This far exceeds the 75th percentile for the lake class but was the lowest catch since the 2012 survey. The Northern Pike catch rate in Big Marine has exceeded the 75th percentile for the lake class continuously since the 1969 survey. Fish size was particularly small with a mean length of only 16.2 inches and the longest fish measuring 29.2 inches. Only 13 percent of fish exceeded 20 inches in length.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch were sampled at a rate of 1 fish per gill net. This is well below the 25th percentile for the lake class but typical for the lake. Catch rates have not exceed the 25th percentile for the lake class since the 1999 survey. Fish size was relatively large with a mean length of 9.1 inches and a range of 7.5 to 11.1 inches. The low number fish and the absence of any smaller fish in the survey likely indicates a consistent lack of recruitment in the system. <br> \n  <br> \nLargemouth Bass were sampled by electrofishing at a rate of 103.6 fish per hour. This is a high catch rate relative to similar lakes and this lakes history. It is more than double any of the previous surveys since 1994. Mean size has been pretty consistent with an average length of 11 inches. Lengths ranged from 4.2 to 17.9 inches. <br> \n <br> \nWhile other game fish species were sampled, summer gill netting does not produce data that is reliable for making inferences as to their abundance or size structure. As a note for anglers, Black Crappie up to 11.1 inches and Bluegill up to 9.4 inches were sampled. Other fish species sampled included: Black Bullhead, Black Crappie, Bluegill, Brown Bullhead, Hybrid Sunfish, Pumpkinseed, and Yellow Bullhead.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Northern pike, yellow perch, and hybrid sunfish were each taken in numbers per set for the respective gears significantly above the statewide median.  White sucker, walleye, carp, black bullhead, brown bullhead, and yellow bullhead along with bluegill and black crappie were found in numbers per set significantly below the statewide catch figures for the appropriate gear.Northern pike catch rates in gill nets have been consistently higher than either statewide or local catch rates since the first survey conducted on Big Marine Lake in 1951,  The catch rate found on this survey was some 4 times the local median.  Both the length-frequency distribution and the ages of fish from scale samples indicate regular natural reproduction has occurred over the past several years.  Higher lake water levels recently have enhanced the natural spawning sites available.  Growth rates for fish with I_IV annuli have been average.Largemouth bass have been taken in gill nets during each netting since 1951 and have always been above the local and statewide medians.  During the last two nettings (1975, 1979) they have also been taken in the trap nets at numbers approximately one half the statewide median and nearly the same as the local median.  Largemouth bass aged in the present work were from I to VI annulus fish.  Fish with I and III annuli present were the most common, each being represented by 7 fish with a total of 20 fish aged.  Both I and III annulus fish showed average growth.Since 1951 bluegill, pumpkinseed, and black crappie have each shown lower trap net catch rates during each successive netting.  In the present survey, each was found in the trap nets in numbers lower (significantly) than the lower median.  It should be noted that the catch rates for bluegills and black crappies in gill nets during the 1979 survey were significantly higher than the expected catch.  Comparison of length-frequency distributions of these two species between gill nets and trap nets showed outstanding differences.  Bluegills were aged from II to VII+ annulus fish.  II, IV, and VII annulus fish were nearly equally abundant and each exhibited slow growth rates.  Black crappie scales read were from II to VII annuli, those showing III and IV annuli being most common.  Both III and IV annulus fish exhibited slow growth.All three bullhead species were found in low numbers in the trapnets with high numbers present in the gill nets.  The yellow bullhead, followed by black bullheads, were the most abundant.  Length-frequency distributions of all three species indicated a high number of large fish present.  This coupled with trap net catches would not indicate an overabundance of these fish at present.  Carp were taken in low numbers, with the fish being fairly large.  No excessive numbers appear present especially when the aquatic vegetation abundance is also taken into account.</p>",

Most of the bluegill were infested with Neascus (black spot).  Panfish species were generally of small size, with pumpkinseed present in moderate numbers; black crappie and hybrid sunfish in low numbers.  Northern pike and largemouth bass were abundant.  Northern pike were small, with a few fish up to 7 pounds.  Largemouth bass were present in a variety of sizes up to 4 pounds, with many 12-14 inch fish.  Walleye numbers were good, with a number of year-classes present.  Fish in the 17-19 inch sizes were most abundant.  Low numbers of white sucker, yellow perch, black, brown, and yellow bullheads were also present.</p>",

Over 30% of the bluegills sampled exceeded 7 inches The average length sampled was 6.25 inches  Pumpkinseed sunfish were also sampled.    <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie were sampled at 1.73 per trap net set. This is also fewer than was caprured in 2008. The average length sampled was 8.4 inches and 19% of the crappies sampled were 10 inches or larger. </p>",

Northern pike continued to be abundant, but the catch rate of northern was lower than recent surveys.  The size of northern sampled remained small \u0013 very similar to earlier studies.  Yellow perch were (as in the previous assessment) conspicuously absent.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Big Marine Lake is a 1,799 Acre, class 24 lake located in Northern Washington County.  Big Marine Lake is primarily managed for Walleye and Largemouth Bass, with Northern Pike and Bluegill as secondary management species.  Big Marine Lake has been stocked with Walleye fingerlings at a rate of 1lb/littoral acre (1152lbs) on even numbered years.  In 2016 2,304 lb of fingerlings were stocked (2lb/littoral acre).  A targeted gill net survey was conducted during the summer of 2016 to assess the Walleye population of Big Marine Lake, as well as the Northern Pike and Yellow Perch populations, two species that often interact closely with Walleye.  Additionally, night time electrofishing was conducted on June 1, 2016 to assess Largemouth Bass. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye were sampled at a catch rate of 1.92 fish per gill net, below average for class 24 lakes, and below the mid-range goal of 3 per gill net.  Walleye catch rate decreased from 3.42 per gill net observed in the 2014 survey.  The average size of Walleyes sampled in gill nets was 20.42 inches, and fish from 11 to 25 inches were sampled.  Average size was similar to that observed in 2014.  More than 96% of Walleyes sampled were greater than 15 inches in length, and 70% were greater than 20 inches.  Otolith aging revealed 6 year classes ranging from age 4 to age 10, most aligning with stocking years.  Walleye growth was above average to age-4, but slowed considerably afterwards.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike catch rate was 18 fish per gill net, a slight reduction from the 20.83 fish per gill net seen in 2014.  However, pike catch rate in this survey was well above average for class 24 lakes and extremely high even in the East Metro where high pike density is the norm.  The average size Northern Pike sampled in 2016 was 17.8 inches in length, similar to 2014 when average size was 17.4 inches.  Only 13% of sampled pike were greater than 21 inches in length, 3% were greater than 25 inches, and 1% were greater than 30 inches.  Size structure of Northern Pike in Big Marine is extremely poor.   <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch catch rate was 0.5 fish per gill net, below average for class 24 lakes.  This is a slight increase from 0.25 perch per gillnet in 2014.  Yellow Perch abundance has historically been low in Big Marine Lake. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass catch rate during night time electrofishing was 51.4 bass per hour of on time, an increase from the 34.46 per hour of on time recorded during day time electrofishing in 2014.  This catch rate is indicative of a moderate to high abundance of Largemouth Bass compared to other lakes in the East Metro.  The average Largemouth Bass sampled in this survey was 11 inches in length, and bass from 4.5 to 15.5 inches were sampled.  Only 35% of sampled bass were greater than 12 inches, and no bass longer than 16 inches were sampled.  The Largemouth Bass population in Big Marine Lake is comprised of mostly small individuals, and growth in past surveys has been determined to be slow after age-6.  <br> \n</p>",

The gill net catch of 2.25/set is an increase over the 2004 walleye catch. The walleyes sampled averaged 19.22 inches in length and 2.78 pounds. A total of 1152 lbs of walleye are stocked biennially. Northern pike were sampled at 18.75/set, which is the second highest gill net catch rate. This species continues to show an overall increase in population. Conditions for high northern pike reproduction have been common recently. The average size pike in the lake is 20.57 inches and 1.94 pounds. Largemouth bass, while normally not sampled effectively in nets, were found in high abundance. Anglers have reported good catches of largemouth bass from this lake. Forage species such as yellow perch and white sucker continue to be found in low abundance.         <br> \n</p>",

The gill net catch of 3.17/set is an increase over the 2006 and 2008 walleye catches. The walleyes sampled averaged 19.79 inches in length and 2.91 pounds. A total of 1152 lbs of walleye are stocked biennially. Northern pike were sampled at 18.5/set, which is the third highest gill net catch rate. This species continues to have a high population in Big Marine Lake. Conditions for high northern pike reproduction have been common recently. The average size pike in the lake is 19.81 inches and 1.75 pounds. Largemouth bass, while normally not sampled effectively in nets, were found in above average abundance. Anglers have reported good catches of largemouth bass from this lake. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Walleye in this survey ranged from 13 to 24 inches long with most in the 14-16 inch size range. When the Walleyes were aged they were found to be from eight different years with the oldest fish being nine years old (2009 year class). The largest number of fish were age two (2016 year class) and should provide quality fishing opportunities in the years ahead. <br> \n <br> \nThe Northern Pike numbers were high, typical of Big Marine Lake. The average size pike measured 17.8 inches which is nearly identical to the past two surveys. The largest individual sampled measured 27 inches. The new Northern Pike zone regulations which went into effect in 2018 allow a harvest on Big Marine Lake of 10 pike, with two over 26 inches in length, and a protected slot between 22 and 26 inches. This new regulation may be able to help shift this poor size structure if anglers begin to harvest higher numbers of the fish under 22 inches long.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch numbers were low in 2018, similar to past surveys. Age data revealed that the Yellow Perch were between four and 11 years old. Black Crappie were moderately abundant and averaged approximately seven inches long with only four fish exceeding 10 inches. Bluegill numbers were low but the size structure was better than past surveys with the average size over seven inches long in the gill net catch. Bluegill aging revealed that it takes between five and seven years to grow a seven inch Bluegill in Big Marine Lake.  <br> \n</p>",
