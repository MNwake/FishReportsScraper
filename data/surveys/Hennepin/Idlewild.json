ELECTROFISHING CAPTURED 26 LMB. AGE AND GROWTH ANALYSIS INDICATED THE PRESENCE OF FISH IN AGE-CLASSES 1-5 AND 8, WITH GROWTH SLOWER THAN AVERAGE FOR ALL YEARS OF LIFE EXCEPT THE FOURTH AND FIFTH YEAR, WHICH WERE ABOVE AVERAGE. BLG WERE SAMPLED IN GILLNETS AT 49.2 TIMES THE LOCAL MEDIAN AND 55.9 TIMES THE STATE MEDIAN.  IN TRAPNETS, BLG WERE CAPTURED IN NUMBERS 3.3 TIMES THE LOCAL MEDIAN AND 3.9 TIMES THE STATE MEDIAN. PSD=70.7%, BUT RSD WAS ONLY 1.7%.  HSF WERE ALSO ABUNDANT, CAPTURED IN NUMBERS 20.5 TIMES THE LOCAL MEDIAN AND 26.9 TIMES THE STATE MEDIAN FOR GILLNETS; 43.5 TIMES THE LOCAL MEDIAN AND 87 TIMES THE STATE MEDIAN FOR TRAPNETS.  RSD WAS CALCULATED AT 7.3% WITH ONE FISH MEASURING OVER 8 INCHES.

ONE FISH MEASURED OVER 12 INCHES WITH THE REST HAVING A BIMODAL DISTRIBUTION MOST IN THE 4.0-5.4 INCH RANGE AND A SMALLER GROUP IN THE 7.5-9.4 INCH RANGE.
