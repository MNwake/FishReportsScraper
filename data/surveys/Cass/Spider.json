                "narrative": "<p>Spider is an eighty-five acre lake located about twelve miles west of Pine River.  A public access is present on the northwest side.  The lake is in the Foothills State Forest and has an undeveloped shoreline.  It is a softwater lake with low phosphorus fertility.  Water clarity is below average for the area, possibly because about 88% of the lake is less than 15 feet deep and maximum depth is about 17 feet.  Shallow water soils are predominately sand.  Emergent aquatic plants, especially bulrush provide preferred spawning sites for panfish and bass.  Marshy areas are important for northern pike spawning.  Submerged plants grow to a depth of about 15 feet and provide protection and feeding areas for a variety of fish species.Gamefish found in the 1994 netting included northern pike, walleyes and largemouth bass.  Pumpkinseeds were the only sunfish found.  Black crappies were present as well.Northern pike were found in \"low\" numbers compared to similar type lakes.  Ages 2-3 were caught and growth was good.  Average size was 2.0 lbs..  Walleyes were found in \"high\" numbers compared to similar type lakes.  Ages 3-5 were sampled and growth was good.  Average size was 2.1 lbs..  Walleye fry have been stocked annually since 1980.  Largemouth bass were present in \"average\" numbers in '94.Pumpkinseeds were caught in \"high\" numbers in '94.  About 33% were 7.0 inches or more in length.  Black crappies were found in \"average\" numbers.  Ages 2-3 were sampled and growth was good.Yellow perch were caught in \"high\" numbers in '94.  This species is an important food resource for the lake's gamefish.  White suckers were caught in \"average\" numbers, while brown bullheads were found in \"low\" numbers compared to similar type lakes.  Brown bullhead catch rates have been quite variable over the past several nettings.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Spider Lake is an 85 acre lake located in the Foothills State Forest nine miles north of Leader in Cass County.  Spider is fairly shallow, with 88% being 15' deep or less.  A small public access is located on the west shore.  Several campsites are located on the northern and eastern shore and are frequently used by ATV riders utilizing the area trails.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye fry are stocked annually (75,000/year) into Spider.  The walleye gillnet catch of 1.8 was average when compared to similar lakes.  Average length was 18.3\", with 91% measuring at least 12\" in length. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass were sampled by a spring electrofishing survey at a rate of 94.3/hr run time indicating a good bass density.  Average length was 11.8\", with 24% measuring at least 12\" in length.  Largemouth up to 22.1\" were sampled.  Largemouth bass were sampled in high numbers in gillnets at 4.3/net.  Average length was 13.5\", with 72% at least 12\" in length. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike were sampled in average numbers at 5.0/gillnet.   Average length was 21.2\", with 20% measuring at least 24\" in length.  New northern pike regulations effective March 1st, 2018 include a possession limit of 10 fish.  Only 2 may be over 26\" and all fish between 22\"-26\" must be immediately released.  The intent of the regulation is to improve the harvest opportunity for pike and improve the fish community composition. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappies were sampled in average numbers in gillnets at 3.3/net.  Average length was 9.1\".  The trapnet catch at 7.0/net was high when compared to similar lakes.  Average length was 8.2\".  For both gears combined 70% were at least 8\" in length. <br> \n <br> \nNo bluegills have ever been documented in Spider Lake, although pumpkinseed sunfish are present.  They were sampled by trapnets in average numbers at 2.6/net.  Average length was 6.6\", with 65% at least 7\" in length. <br> \n <br> \nNo invasive species have been discovered in Spider Lake.  Before and after launching lake users are required to inspect and remove any aquatic plants and animals from their watercraft and trailers as well as pull the plug and drain all water from the watercraft, including bilges, livewells and baitwells. <br> \n</p>",

The lake is in the Foothills State Forest and has an undeveloped shoreline.  It is a softwater lake with low phosphorus fertility.  The maximum depth is normally 17 feet, but extremely high water levels in 1999 have increased the water level by 4 feet.  Water clarity is good for the area.  Shallow water soils are predominantly sand.  Emergent aquatic plants, especially bulrushes provide preferred spawning sites for panfish and bass.  Marshy areas are important for northern pike spawning.  Submerged plants grow to a depth of 8 feet and provide protection and feeding areas for a variety of fish species.Gamefish found in 1999 netting included northern pike, walleye and largemouth bass.  Pumpkinseeds were the only sunfish found in the lake.  Black crappies were present as well.  Northern pike were found in average numbers compared to similar lake types.  Ages 3,4 and 6 were sampled and growth was good.  Average size was 1.7 pounds.  Walleye fry have been stocked annually since 1980.  Average size was 1.7 pounds.  Walleye fry have been stocked annually since 1980.  Largemouth bass were present in average numbers in 1999.Pumpkinseeds were caught in average numbers in 1999. About 62%were 7.0 inches or more in length.  Black crappies were found in average numbers.  Ages 3 and 4 were sampled and growth was good.  Yellow perch were caught in very high numbers again in 1999.  This species is an important food resource for the lake's gamefish.  White suckers were caught in average numbers compared to similar lake types.  Brown bullhead catch rates have been quite variable over the past several nettings.</p>",

The lake has a maximum depth of 17'.  A nearshore survey was conducted to assess the populations of both game and non-game fish species.  Ten 100' long sampling stations were evenly spaced around the lakeshore.  Each station was then sampled by backpack electrofishing, and if conditions allowed with a 15' or 50' 1/8th inch seine. <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore survey took place on 28 July 2017, with all ten stations sampled by backpack electrofishing.  The 15' 1/8th inch seine was used at five stations, with the 50' 1/8th inch used at one additional site.  Four stations had heavy vegetation, which would not allow for seining.  In total four species were sampled including black crappie, largemouth bass, yellow perch, and pumpkinseed.  This nearshore survey will be used along with the gillnet and trapnet survey conducted on 7-10 August 2017 to calculate an Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) score.  This score will be an indicator of the health of Spider Lake.  <br> \n</p>",
