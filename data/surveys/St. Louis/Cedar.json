                "narrative": "<p>Cedar Lake is in Ecological Lake Class 13, which consists of 84 lakes in northeast Minnesota that are small, shallow, and have very soft (unmineralized) water.  Cedar Lake is smaller, deeper, and has clearer water than most of the lakes in this lake class.Cedar Lake stratifies thermally in midsummer and has good oxygen for trout (more than 5 ppm) to a depth of about 15 ft, where the temperature is about 60 F.  There are no inlets.  The outlet (to the St. Louis River) flows through marshes and gradients which prevent upstream fish movement.  In addition, there is a grate at the outlet culvert to prevent downstream movement of trout.  The lake bottom along the shorelines is muck (53 percent), sand (22 percent), and silt (25 percent).  There is marsh and bog around the entire shoreline.  Aquatic plants grow to a depth of about 10 ft; the most common plants are yellow waterlilies, water milfoil, and filamentous algae.Cedar Lake has been poisoned to remove the fish populations four times, in 1961, 1966, 1979, and 1989, and has been stocked with rainbow trout since 1961.  Twelve trout population assessments have been conducted since 1965, using gillnets and trapnets.The total catch of trout in the gillnets in 1998 of 3.0 trout/net was lower than the long term average catch of 7.3 trout/net in all assessments in Cedar Lake.  Previous trout catches have been quite variable (range: 0-20 trout/net) depending on the number of stocked fall fingerlings surviving their first winter.  The total catch of trout by weight has been more stable over time, and the 1998 catch of 5.8 lb/net is similar to the long term average catch in Cedar Lake of 6.3 lb/net and is also similar to the median catch of 6.0 lb/net for recent assessments on 24 stream trout lakes in the Ely Fisheries Management Area.Six trout were caught in the gillnets in 1998 and only two were small enough to be fingerlings stocked the previous fall.  The largest was a 20.1\" brown trout, which was the only trout other than rainbow trout caught in Cedar Lake in any assessment.  Since only rainbow trout have been stocked, something apparently happened at the hatchery that one or more brown trout got mixed in with the rainbows.  The trout examined in 1998 had been eating sticklebacks, fathead minnows, and midge larvae.Only one trout was caught in the trapnets in 1998.  Previous trout catches in trapnets have been inconsistent, with no or few trout the rule, but occasionally with higher catches (5 trout/trapnet).  Most of the trout caught in trapnets have been small, from the previous fall's fingerling stocking.A sucker and a yellow perch were also caught in 1998.  Sucker were previously observed in the 1995 assessment, but this was the first appearance of perch since the lake was poisoned in 1989.  High numbers of minnows (fatheads, redbelly dace, and sticklebacks) were also caught in the trapnets in 1998.  The numbers of these species has increased in recent assessments.</p>",

Several of those fish were mature and able to spawn that spring.  This survey was done to target largemouth bass only by electrofishing.  In one hour of electrofishing, 63 largemouth were collected which is a fairly high catch rate.  Of the 63 fish sampled, 52 were 2 years old meaning they were born in 2014 and were the spawn of the fish originally stocked that spring.  The other 11 fish ranged in age from 4 to 7.

Cedar Lake is one of 77 lakes in Lake Class 13, but it is smaller, deeper, and less chemically fertile than most of these lakes.Small mesh trapnets captured high numbers of native minnows: fatheads, dace, and sticklebacks.A gillnet and nine trapnets captured 30 rainbow trout and 13 white sucker.  All but two of the trout had been stocked the previous fall as fingerlings and were 7\" to 9\" when captured.  One large trout was 21\".  The stomach of a 11\" trout contained stickleback minnows.  The sucker were large, ranging in size from 16\" to 20\".  These sucker were probably introduced by anglers using them for bait.  They are the first non-minnow species (other than stocked trout) to invade the lake since it was poisoned out in 1989.  These suckers will compete with trout for food.  No angling was observed during six days of survey fieldwork spread throughout the summer, however several local residents reported good rainbow trout fishing to the survey crew.  Winter angling pressure is believed to be moderate.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Cedar Lake is in Ecological Lake Class 13, which consists of 84 lakes in northeast Minnesota that are small, shallow, and have very soft (unmineralized) water.  Cedar Lake is smaller and deeper than most of the lakes in this lake class.  <br> \n <br> \nCedar Lake was thermally stratified on 5/22/2007 with a surface temperature of 57 F and a bottom temperature of 39 F.  Adequate oxygen for trout (more than 5 ppm) was present to a depth of 21 ft, where the temperature was 41 F.  Previous investigations have shown that in midsummer, 5 ppm oxygen is retained to a depth of about 16 ft, where the temperature is about 62 F.   <br> \n <br> \nCedar Lake has no inlets, and the outlet to the St. Louis River flows through marshes and has steep gradients that prevent upstream fish movement.  There is a grate to prevent downstream fish movement where the outlet leaves the lake and crosses under Co. Rd. 341.  Lake bottom substrates along the shoreline are muck (53 percent), sand (22 percent), and silt (25 percent).  There is marsh and bog along the entire shoreline.  Aquatic plants grow to a depth of 10 ft; the most common plants are yellow waterlily, water milfoil, and filamentous algae. <br> \n <br> \nCedar Lake has been poisoned four times to remove non-trout fish species, in 1961, 1966, 1979, and 1989.  Rainbow trout have been stocked annually since 1961, except for years in which the lake was poisoned.  Trout population assessments have been conducted 15 times with 1-2 gillnet sets, with 2-9 standard trapnet sets (during 13 of the assessments) and with small mesh trapnets (during 12 of the assessments).  The first three assessments, through 1977, were done in mid-to-late summer.  All subsequent assessments were done in late May or early June. <br> \n <br> \nThe  catch of trout in 2007 of 2.0/gillnet was lower than the median catch of 3.2/gillnet in all investigations on this lake.  The  catch of trout on this lake in past assessments has been quite variable, ranging from 0/gillnet to 20/gillnet depending on the number of stocked fall fingerlings that survived their first winter.  Two of the four trout caught in the 2007 gillnets were from the previous fall's stocking.  The remaining trout were 12\"-14\".   <br> \n <br> \nBy weight, the 2007 trout catch of 1.1 lb/gillnet was lower than the median catch of 4.0 lb/gillnet in all investigations on this lake and was lower than the median catch of trout (all species combined) of 3.7 lb/gillnet in recent investigations of 25 stream trout lakes in the Tower Fisheries Management Area. <br> \n <br> \nTwo of the trout captured in 2007 had insect remains in their stomachs; one trout stomach was empty, and one contained fish remains.  <br> \n <br> \nSunfish were eradicated from Cedar Lake during the 1989 poisoning and were absent in assessments through 2001.  Fair numbers of bluegill sunfish (10.8/standard trapnet) were captured in the 2004 assessment, and very high numbers of bluegill sunfish (130/standard trapnet and 424/small mesh trapnet) were captured in the 2007 assessment.  Sunfish sizes in the standard trapnets averaged 6.8\" and the largest was 8.0\".   <br> \n <br> \nAlso captured in the small mesh trapnets in 2007 were fairly high numbers of fathead minnows (110/net) and redbelly dace (60/net).  A few golden shiner were captured in 2007.  A few white sucker had been captured in the 1995, 2001, and 2004 assessments, but were not observed in 2007.</p>",

There is a grate to prevent downstream fish movement where the outlet leaves the lake and crosses under Co. Rd. 341. Lake bottom substrates along the shoreline are muck (53 percent), sand (22 percent), and silt (25 percent). There is marsh and bog along the entire shoreline. Aquatic plants grow to a depth of 10 ft; the most common plants are yellow waterlily, water milfoil, and filamentous algae.  <br> \n <br> \nIn 2013, Cedar was still designated as a stream trout lake although no longer being managed for trout.  Repeated lake treatments to kill non-trout species over the years were ineffective as northern pike and bluegill were illegally introduced following the poisonings. After a statewide review of stream trout stocking, the Cedar Lake stocking was discontinued in 2007.  Cedar Lake may be removed from the list of designated trout lakes once the public review process is completed. <br> \n <br> \nOnly two species of fish were sampled during the 2012 population assessment. Bluegill are very abundant and 3 northern pike were sampled in the gill nets. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill numbers in 2012 (151.6/trap net) were higher than the long term average for all assessments on this lake. The average bluegill sampled was just over 4 inches long and about 5 years old. The largest bluegill sampled was 9.1 inches long. Many of the bluegill sampled were heavily infested with the parasite neascus, commonly referred to as black spot. Neascus can be killed by properly cooking the fish.  <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

Cedar Lake is smaller and deeper than most of the lakes in this lake class.Cedar Lake was thermally stratified on 06/04/2001 and retained more than 5 ppm oxygen to a depth of 14 ft, where the temperature was 50 F.  In midsummer, Cedar Lake typically retains more than 5 ppm oxygen to about 15 ft, where the temperature is about 60 F.  There are no inlets, and the outlet (to the St. Louis River) flows through marshes and gradients which prevent upstream fish movement.  In addition, there is a grate at the outlet to prevent downstream fish movement.  Bottom substrates are muck (53 percent), sand (22 percent), and silt (25 percent).  There is a marsh and bog around the entire shoreline.  Aquatic plants grow to a depth of 10 ft; the most common plants are yellow waterlilies, water milfoil, and filamentous algae.Cedar Lake has been reclaimed (poisoned) four times, in 1961, 1966, 1979, and 1989, and has been stocked with rainbow trout since the initial reclamation.  Trout population assessments have been conducted 13 times with 1-2 gillnet sets, 2-9 standard trapnet sets (during 11 of the assessments), and 2-6 small mesh trapnet sets (during 10 of the assessments).  The first three assessments, through 1977, were done in mid-to-late summer.  All subsequent assessments were done in late May or early June.The total catch of trout in the gillnets in 2001 of 2.5/net was lower than the long term median catch of 4.0/net in all investigations on this lake.  However, the catch of trout has been quite variable (range: 0-20/net) depending on the number of stocked fall fingerlings surviving their first winter.  The total trout catch by weight has been more stable over time, and the 2001 catch of 3.7 lb/net is similar to the long term median catch for this lake of 4.2 lb/gillnet, but is lower than the median catch of 5.0 lb/gillnet in recent assessments on 25 stream trout lakes (excluding mine pit lakes) in the Tower Fisheries Management Area.Rainbow sizes in 2001 ranged from 7.2\" to 18.7\" and were from several year classes.  Many rainbows in the trapnets were in the 7-10\" range and were from previous fall's fingerling stocking.  Four trout stomachs were examined in 2001 and contained insects, snails, and fish remains.Two white sucker were caught in the trapnets in 2001, along with some creek chubs, many fathead minnows and sticklebacks, and some dace.  Low numbers of white sucker have been present since 1995.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Cedar Lake is a 32 acre lake located three miles southwest of Aurora. The lake has a maximum depth of 51 feet, but over 80 percent of the lake is less than 15 feet deep. The access is a small earthen ramp off Co Rd 341. Cedar had been a designated trout lake, but that designation was removed in 2019 and the lake is now being managed as a bass-panfish lake. Trout management was ceased due to numerous illegal introductions of warmwater gamefish over the years. The lake had last been reclaimed in 1989. <br> \n <br> \nOn August 25, 2020 Cedar Lake was thermally stratified with a surface temperature of 75 F and a bottom temperature of 41 F. Oxygen levels were adequate for gamefish to a depth of 14 feet. Cedar Lake has no inlets and the outlet, which flows through several marshes to the St. Louis River, has steep gradients that prevent upstream fish movement. Lake bottom substrates along the shoreline are mostly muck with areas of sand and silt.  Much of the shoreline is rimmed by marsh and aquatic plants grow to a depth of 10 feet. <br> \n <br> \nElectrofishing was used on Cedar Lake for largemouth bass sampling.  Twenty-eight largemouth were captured in the 50 minutes of fishing for a catch rate of 33.6 fish/hour. This was lower than the 2016 survey catch rate of 61.0 fish/hour but above average compared to other largemouth lakes in the area. Lengths ranged from 4 to 17.5 inches with an average of 10 inches. Growth rates were quite slow with the average fish taking 7 years to reach 12 inches.     <br> \n <br> \nBluegill were absent after the 1989 reclamation until they were first sampled in 2007. The 2007, 2012, and 2020 surveys had trapnet catch rates of 129.8, 151.6, and 40.9 fish/net respectively. The 2020 catch rate was still very good compared to other similar lakes. Sizes ranged from 1 to 8.5 inches with an average of just over 6 inches. Over 27 percent of the catch was 7 inches or larger. Fish were sampled up to 9 years old with strong representation from the 2016 year class. Growth was slow compared to other bluegill populations in the area.       <br> \n <br> \nThe northern pike gillnet catch in 2020 was 7.5 fish/net and the trapnet catch was 0.9 fish/net. Lengths from all pike caught ranged from 11 to 31 inches with an average of 22 inches. These sizes were on par with previous surveys. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Cedar Lake is in Ecological Lake Class 13, which consists of 84 lakes in northeast Minnesota that are small, shallow, and have very soft (unmineralized) water.  Cedar Lake is smaller and deeper than most of the lakes in this lake class.Cedar Lake was thermally stratified on 5/24/2004 with a surface temperature of 54 F and a bottom temperature of 41 F.  Adequate oxygen for trout (more than 5 ppm) was retained to a depth of 20 ft, where the temperature was 45 F.  Previous investigations have showed that in midsummer 5 ppm oxygen is retained to a depth of about 16 ft, where the temperature is about 62 F.  Cedar Lake has no inlets, and the outlet to the St. Louis River flows through marshes and steep gradients that prevent upstream fish movement.  There is a grate to prevent downstream fish movement where the outlet leaves the lake and crosses under Co. Rd. 341.  Lake bottom substrates along the shoreline are muck (53 percent), sand (22 percent), and silt (25 percent).  There is marsh and bog along the entire shoreline.  Aquatic plants grow to a depth of 10 ft; the most common plants are yellow waterlilies, water milfoil, and filamentous algae.Cedar Lake has been poisoned four times to remove non-trout fish species, in 1961, 1966, 1979, and 1989.  Rainbow trout have been stocked annually since 1961, except for years in which the lake was poisoned.  Trout population assessments have been conducted 14 times with 1-2 gillnet sets, with 2-9 standard trapnet sets (during 12 of the assessments) and with small mesh trapnets (during 11 of the assessments).  The first three assessments, through 1977, were done in mid-to-late summer.  All subsequent assessments were done in late May or early June.The total catch of trout in the gillnets in 2004 of 5.5/net was higher than the long term median catch of 4.2/net in all investigations on this lake.  The total catch of trout on this lake in past assessments has been quite variable, ranging from 0/net to 20/net depending on the number of stocked fall fingerlings that survived their first winter.  Five of the 11 trout caught in the 2004 gillnets were from the previous fall's stocking.  Most of the remaining trout were age three (one was age four) and ranged in size from 13\" to 16\".  Notably absent were age two trout from the October, 2002 stocking.By weight, the 2004 trout catch of 4.5 lb/gillnet was higher than the median catch of trout (all species combined) of 2.5 lb/gillnet in recent investigations of 25 stream trout lakes in the Tower Fisheries Management Area.Trout captured in the 2004 gillnets contained snails (found in four stomachs), minnows including sticklebacks (five stomachs), and dragonfly nymphs (three stomachs).  Eight rainbow trout were caught in the standard and small mesh trapnets in 2004.   All were from the previous fall's stocking except for one age four trout that was 16\" long.Six white sucker were captured in the trapnets in 2004.  Since the most recent poisoning of fish in 1989, white sucker were first observed in 1995 and a few were captured in each subsequent assessment.  The sucker caught in 2004 were quite large, ranging from 19\" to 23\".  No young-of-year sucker were captured in the ?\" trapnets in 2004.One hybrid sunfish was caught in the standard trapnets in 2004, and 43 small bluegill were caught in the ?\" trapnets.  This is the first appearance of bluegill in Cedar Lake since the 1989 poisoning.  Based on previous experience with bluegill and pumpkinseed sunfish in this lake, they are likely to become quite abundant.Many fathead minnows and redbelly dace were captured in the ?\" trapnets in 2004, along with lower numbers of brook sticklebacks.</p>",
