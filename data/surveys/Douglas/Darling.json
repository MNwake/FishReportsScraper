                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of the nearshore fish community in Darling Lake was conducted by Fisheries Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program Staff from 19-22 July 2021.  Fourteen sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 15-foot or 50-foot seine, where possible.  Backpack electrofishing was completed at all 14 sites with one site sampled from the boat.  A 50-foot seine was used to sample eleven sites, a 15-foot seine was used at two sites, and soft sediments with abundant vegetation and deep water prevented the use of seines at one sampling site.  Nearshore sampling captured 30 native species of fish including eight species that are intolerant of disturbance (Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, Mimic Shiner, Pugnose Shiner, Rock Bass, and Smallmouth Bass) and three species (Black Bullhead, Fathead Minnow, and Green Sunfish) that are tolerant of disturbance. <br> \n <br> \nA concurrent summer trap net survey was conducted on 19-22 July 2021 by IBI Program Staff.  Twelve trap nets were set along the shoreline that encompassed multiple habitat types.  Bluegill and Pumpkinseed comprised a majority of the trap net catch by number and Common Carp, Bluegill and Northern Pike comprised a majority of the catch by biomass.  The number of Bluegill sampled per net was very near the 50% quartile for similar Lake Class 27 lakes and the average length was 6.5 inches, with 23% over 7 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore and trap net data were combined with gill net data from a July 2020 survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based IBI (FIBI) score.  The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment.  In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g., Blackchin Shiner, Iowa Darter, and Rock Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g., Black Bullhead, Fathead Minnow, and Green Sunfish).  The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake.  For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.   <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey indicates Darling Lake is in good health as indicated by an FIBI score above the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes.  Data from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Long Prairie River Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency. <br> \n</p>",

This decline may be a sampling error, or it may have resulted from a discontinuation of walleye stocking in Lake Darling (due to a lack of a public access). Walleyes still can run into Darling from Carlos and Cowdry. Yellow perch population is low. Northern pike population is high with an average mean size (2.08 lbs/nop). Northern cisco population is very high and should provide excellent forage for walleyes and northern pike. Bluegill population is extremely high (86/trapnet) and the size is small (0.12 lbs/sunfish). Black crappies and largemouth bass are also abundant and should provide good fishing opportunities.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Darling Lake is a moderately sized, mesotrophic lake located in west-central Minnesota near Alexandria.  This lake supports a diverse fishery that would be especially appealing to young anglers.  Darling Lake is part of the Alexandria chain-of-lakes system which includes lakes Carlos, Le Homme Dieu, and Cowdry.  There is no public access on Lake Darling proper, but Darling can be easily accessed via navigable channels from the three prior mentioned adjoining lakes.  Maximum depth is 62 ft, but most of the shoreline is composed of moderately shallow sand flats less than 10 ft.  Aquatic vegetation is moderately abundant around the lake.  Protection of this habitat is important as it provides spawning and nursery habitat for a variety of fish species.  Aquatic vegetation also reduces shoreline erosion and promotes good water quality.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit.  An abundance of sunfishes, bass, and northern pike should provide fast action for novice anglers as well as more experienced fishermen.  Bluegill, black crappie, pumpkinseed sunfish, and rock bass are very abundant.  The average size of black crappie captured in a recent survey was 8.0 inches.  Rock bass averaged 7.0 inches.  The average weight of largemouth bass sampled was about 1 lb., but 6% of captured bass exceeded 15 inches in length and weighed between one and three lbs.  An abundance of smaller sized sunfishes, bass, and northern pike indicates good natural reproduction in Darling Lake.  Anglers seeking panfish action should try fishing the shorelines where both emergent and submergent vegetation exists.  Small vegetated bays should also produce good numbers of panfish in the spring.  Anglers often fish for crappie in a large bay on the northwest side of the lake in spring.  Largemouth bass frequent the vegetated shoreline along the southeastern side of the lake and this area should provide good fishing during spring and summer.Walleye are not as abundant as they are in other west-central lakes, but they average a larger size in Lake Darling.  The average size of walleye sampled with gill nets was almost 20 inches and their weight averaged 2 ? lbs.  The largest walleye sampled was 27 inches long and weighed about 5 lbs.  Lake Darling received no walleye stocking between 1981 and 1999 and most walleye were the result of natural reproduction.  Naturally reproducing walleye populations are indicators of good habitat and water quality.  Walleye stocking was initiated in 2000 to increase walleye abundance.  Early season anglers may want to try fishing walleye over a gravel bar located in the northeast corner of the lake in the narrows between Darling and the large bay called Little Darling.Darling Lake is managed primarily for panfish and bass, and secondarily for northern pike and walleye.  The DNR helps maintain panfish and bass recruitment by posting a spawning area along the southeast side of the lake.  A posted spawning area prohibits fishing and boating traffic in the posted area between ice-out and June 30.  However, persons with adjoining shoreline property are allowed ingress and egress rights through the posted area for purposes of gaining access to the main lake.  Other management activities include routine surveys to monitor the health of fish populations, some limited walleye stocking to supplement naturally produced walleye populations, and habitat protection through review of proposed shoreline developments and permits regulating removal of emergent vegetation.           </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Darling is a 945-acre basin located on the northwest edge of the city of Alexandria and is part of the Alexandria Chain of Lakes.  There is no public access on Lake Darling; however, boaters can gain access via a navigable channel from Lake Carlos.  The lake is popular for both angling and other water-based recreation.  The 450-acre Arrowwood Resort and Conference Center is located along the west shore. Most of the shoreline is heavily developed with residential housing.  Water quality and clarity are good. Mid-summer water transparency was recorded at 14.5 feet.  The lake supports an abundant and diverse aquatic plant community.  Aquatic plants help maintain water quality and clarity by competing with algae for available nutrients in the lake.  Aquatic plants also provide spawning habitat and cover for many fish species, especially bass and panfishes.  Turtle Bay on the west end of the lake is posted as a no-wake zone to protect aquatic vegetation.  <br> \n <br> \nLake Darling sustains a modest Walleye fishery.  Some natural recruitment or immigration from connected basins is supplemented with combined fingerling and yearling stockings by the DNR, Lake Darling Association, and Viking Sportsmen Club, Inc.  Gill net catches declined in 2016 to 3.1 Walleye/net.  A majority of Walleyes caught during the survey were young, two- or three-year-old fish.  Average size of Walleye measured during the survey was 14.8 inches.  Few 20.0-inch and larger captures were recorded during the survey. <br> \n   <br> \nLake Darling supports abundant populations of Largemouth Bass, Northern Pike, and Bluegills.  Due to moderate fertility of the lake and high abundance of these fishes, growth rates are slow.  Fortunately, gamefishes in Lake Darling live to be quite old, thus it does support some larger fish.  An 8.0-inch Bluegill may be 10 years old.  Largemouth Bass also grow slow but have been shown to live up to 19 years old in the Alexandria Chain of Lakes.  Few Black Crappies are captured during summer surveys since larger fish move off-shore and are less vulnerable to capture in trap nets.  Low catch rates recorded in surveys does not accurately reflect abundance and size distribution.  Lake Darling does support good crappie fishing, particularly during spring months.  Adult Yellow Perch numbers have consistently been low. Yellow Perch are preferred prey of Walleye, Northern Pike, and Largemouth Bass. <br> \n <br> \nQuality fishing opportunities exist for many species in Lake Darling.  Even modest harvest of slow-growing, older fish can degrade fishing quality.  Anglers are encouraged to practice selective harvest to help maintain and improve the quality of the Lake Darling fishery. Selective harvest encourages release of larger fish while promoting harvest of more abundant smaller fish.  Releasing medium to large fish will help restore and maintain fish community balance, as well as increase opportunities to catch large fish in the future. <br> \n <br> \nLake Darling was designated as an infested water after discovery of zebra mussels in 2009.  Minnesota statutes require all equipment be free of invasive species prior to leaving any access.  Recreational users should take necessary precautions to prevent further spread of invasive species. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Darling is a 945-acre basin located on the northwest edge of the city of Alexandria.  It is part of the Alexandria Chain of Lakes. There is no public access on Lake Darling; however, boaters can gain access via a navigable channel from Lake Carlos. The lake is popular for both angling and other water-based recreation. The 450-acre Arrowwood Resort and Conference Center is located along the west shore.  Most of the shoreline is heavily developed with residential housing.  Water quality and clarity are considered good.  Mid-summer water transparency was recorded at 10.0 feet.  The lake supports an abundant and diverse aquatic plant community.  Aquatic plants help maintain water quality and clarity by competing with algae for available nutrients in the lake.  Aquatic plants also provide spawning habitat and cover for many fish species, especially bass and panfish.   <br> \n <br> \nTurtle Bay is posted as a no-wake zone to protect aquatic vegetation. It is also posted as a fish spawning area, which prohibits fishing from April 1 to June 30. <br> \n <br> \nLake Darling supports abundant populations of largemouth bass, northern pike, and bluegill sunfish.  Due to moderate fertility of the lake and abundance of most gamefishes, growth rates are slow.  An 8.0-inch bluegill may be 12 years old.  Fortunately, gamefishes live to be quite old thus Lake Darling does support modest some large fish.   Even modest harvest of these old fish can quickly erode fishing quality.  In general, anglers can expect high catch rates of small- and medium-size fish.  Harvest of surplus small fish is encouraged. <br> \n <br> \nHarvest pressure directed at largemouth bass is light so Lake Darling and other lakes making up the Alexandria Chain of Lakes support a relatively high proportion of 12.0 to 16.0-inch bass.  This fishery attribute make these lakes popular with bass anglers.  The Alexandria Chain hosts several largemouth bass tournaments during summer months. <br> \n <br> \nFew black crappies are captured during summer surveys since larger fish move off-shore and are less vulnerable to capture in trap nets.  Low catches recorded in surveys does not accurately reflect abundance and size distribution.  Lake Darling does support good crappie fishing, particularly during spring months. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye fishing is sustained by annual stockings.  The population is moderately abundant at present due to combined fingerling stockings of the DNR and equivalent rates of walleye fingerlings purchased and stocked by the Viking Sportsmen, Inc. and the Lake Darling Association.  Gillnet catches during the 2012 survey averaged 7.4 walleyes/net which is an above average catch rate for similar lakes.  Current catch statistics reflect increased numbers of young walleyes making up the population.  Average size of walleye captures was 14.0 inches. Growth rate of young fish has slowed with increased competition for food.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch are preferred prey of walleye, northern pike, and largemouth bass.  Adult perch numbers are very low due to excessive predation.  Perch have compensated for heavy predation by maturing and reproducing at a young age and small size.  Early onset of sexual maturity reduces growth potential, thus few perch grow large enough to reach a harvestable size. <br> \n  <br> \nThe Minnesota Department of Natural Resources designated Lake Darling as infested water after the discovery of zebra mussels in 2009. Minnesota statutes require all equipment be free of invasive species prior to leaving any access. Consult your current fishing regulations handbook for rules and regulations pertaining to the cleaning of equipment.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Darling is part of the Alexandria chain of lakes and has a fish community similar to other lakes in the chain.  Lake Darling is not stocked with Walleye like the other lakes within the alexandria chain because of the lack of public access.  Management has focused on centrachid species and Northern Pike which are well suited for the habitat found in the lake.  The lake supports a diverse and abundant submergent vegetation community which provides ample habitat for these species. However, a comparison of the aquatic vegetation surveys conducted in 1981 and 1992 indicates a loss of emergent vegetation, especially hardstem bulrush.  The Northern Pike catches averaged 7.3 fish/gillnet which is within the inter-quartile range (3.1 - 8.4) of mean catch rates for lake class 27. The mean weight of fish captured was 1.9 pounds. PSD was calculated at 32.7%.  Catch rates and size structure of the Northern Pike population have been consistent in surveys dating back to 1974.  Growth of Northern Pike in Lake Darling is similar to the mean growth rate of Northern Pike in other area lakes within lake class 27.  Age 3 fish average 19.2 inches in total length at time of annulus formation. Daytime ac electrofishing yielded 50.6 total Largemouth Bass per hour.  Catches of stock-sized fish (8 inches and greater) averaged 40.4 fish per hour.  PSD and RSD-P were measured at 54.7% and 6.3%, respectively.  This catch rate and size structure is indicative of a quality Largemouth Bass fishery.  Growth of Largemouth Bass in Lake Darling is poor compared to other area lakes within lake class 27.  Age 5 fish average only 12.4 inches in total length at time of annulus formation.  Bluegill catches averaged 24.3 fish/trapnet which is within the normal range for lake class 27, however it is considerably less than the 86.1 fish/trapnet captured in 1986. Gillnet catch rate increased from 4.9 fish/net in 1986 to 11.3 fish/net in 1992.  Mean weight of fish captured in both gear types was 0.2 pounds.  PSD was calculated at 32.9% in 1992, compared to a PSD of 14% recorded in 1986.  Despite the apparent decrease in Bluegill abundance and increase in PSD, the Bluegill population exhibits signs of severe stunting.  The mean growth rate of Bluegill is extremely slow.  Age 6 fish averaged only 5.8 inches in total length at time of capture.  The catch rate for Walleye averaged 3.1 fish/gillnet. This catch rate is below the first quartile (3.7 fish/gillnet) of mean catch rates from lake class 27, however lake darling is not managed for Walleye. Walleye stocking was discontinued after a state statute was established preventing stocking in lakes without a public access.  Walleye present in Lake Darling could be the result of natural reproduction or immigration from other lakes in the Alexandria chain which are stocked and managed for Walleye.  The size distribution of Walleye present in Lake Darling appears to be skewed towards larger fish.  The mean weight of fish captured was 2.6 pounds.  PSD and RSD-P were measured at 80% and 28%, respectively.  Yellow Perch abundance is low.  Gillnet catches averaged only 0.3 fish/net in 1992, which is below the first quartile of mean catch rates from lake class 27.  The highest catch rate recorded in surveys dating back to 1974 was 1.4 fish/gillnet.  Angling reports would suggest a viable Black Crappie population, however it is difficult to evaluate the population because of the poor efficiency in capturing them with standard survey gear during mid-summer months.  Trapnet catches averaged 0.1 fish/net in 1992.  The highest catch rate was recorded in 1986 when trapnet catches averaged 3.4 fish/net.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Darling is a 1,050-acre basin located on the northwest edge of the city of Alexandria and is part of the Alexandria Chain of Lakes.  There is no public access on Lake Darling.  However, boaters can gain access via a navigable channel from Lake Carlos.  The lake is popular for both angling and other water-based recreation.  The 450-acre Arrowwood Resort and Conference Center is located along the west shore.  Most of the shoreline is heavily developed with residential housing.  Water quality and clarity are good.  Mid-summer water transparency was recorded at 20 feet.  The lake supports an abundant and diverse aquatic plant community.  Aquatic plants help maintain water quality and clarity by competing with algae for available nutrients in the lake.  Aquatic plants also provide spawning habitat and cover for many fish species, especially bass and panfishes.  Turtle Bay on the west end of the lake is posted as a no-wake zone to protect aquatic vegetation. \n\nA standard fisheries survey was completed during summer 2020 to provide updated information on the fish community of Lake Darling.  Standard survey components typically include spring electrofishing, gill nets, and trap nets.  However, due to safety concerns during the COVID-19 pandemic, gill nets were the only component used in 2020.\n\nLake Darling sustains a modest Walleye fishery.  Some natural recruitment or immigration from connected basins is supplemented with combined fingerling and yearling stockings by the DNR and private user groups.  Despite high stocking levels, gill net catch rates for Walleye declined in 2020 to 1.3 Walleye/net.  A majority of Walleye caught during the survey were age 6 and older.  Average length was 18.7 inches.\n  \nLake Darling supports abundant populations of Largemouth Bass, Northern Pike, and Bluegills.  Due to moderate fertility of the lake and high abundance of these fishes, growth rates are slow.  Fortunately, gamefishes in Lake Darling live to be quite old, thus it does support some larger fish.  An 8.0-inch Bluegill may be 9 or 10 years old and several fish that large and old were observed during the survey.  Largemouth Bass also grow slow but have been shown to live up to 19 years old in the Alexandria Chain of Lakes.  Northern Pike are overly abundant and anglers are encouraged to take advantage of the new pike regulations and harvest fish less than 22 inches long.  Few Black Crappies are captured during summer surveys since larger fish move off-shore and are less vulnerable to capture.  Low catch rates recorded in surveys does not accurately reflect abundance and size distribution.  Lake Darling does support good crappie fishing, particularly during spring months.  Adult Yellow Perch numbers have consistently been low.  Yellow Perch are preferred prey of Walleye, Northern Pike, and Largemouth Bass.\n\nAdditional species sampled include hybrid sunfish, Pumpkinseed, Rock Bass, Tullibee (Cisco), White Sucker, and Black, Brown, and Yellow Bullhead.  The next standard fisheries survey is tentatively scheduled for 2024.\n\nQuality fishing opportunities exist for many species in Lake Darling.  Even modest harvest of slow-growing, older fish can degrade fishing quality.  Anglers are encouraged to practice selective harvest to help maintain and improve the quality of the Lake Darling fishery.  Selective harvest encourages release of larger fish while promoting harvest of more abundant smaller fish.  Releasing medium to large fish will help restore and maintain fish community balance, as well as increase opportunities to catch large fish in the future.\n\nLake Darling was designated as an infested water after discovery of zebra mussels in 2009.  Minnesota statutes require all equipment be free of invasive species prior to leaving any access.  Recreational users should take necessary precautions to prevent further spread of invasive species.\n</p>",

Walleye catches averaged 7.9 fish/gillnet whichis within the normal range of mean catch rates from lakes with similar chemical and physicalcharacteristics (3.3 - 8.8 fish/net).  Gillnet catches ranged from 2.1 to 7.8 fish/net in previoussurveys dating back to 1974.  Mean weight of fish captured was 2.0 pounds.  Approximately 80% of thefish captured were 15 inches in length or greater and 30% exceeded 20 inches.  Northern pike catchesaveraged 8.3 fish/gillnet.  Gillnet catches have been consistent in previous surveys, ranging from 7.3to 11.7 fish/net.  The expected range of mean catch rates is 2.8 - 9.0 fish/gillnet.  Mean weight offish captured was 2.2 pounds.  Approximately one-half of the fish were 21 inches in length or greater,however few exceeded 28 inches.  Largemouth bass are abundant and provide quality anglingopportunities.  Night, DC electrofishing yielded 104.0 stock-size fish per hour.  Mean weight of fishcaptured was 1.1 pounds.  Seventy five percent of the fish captured were 12 inches in length or greaterand 13% exceeded 15 inches.  Bluegill catches averaged 22.7 fish/trapnet in 1996, nearly identical tothe catch rate of 24.3 fish/trapnet recorded in 1992.  Trapnet catches ranged from the low of 24.3 in1992 to 104.7 fish/net in previous surveys dating back to 1974.   Size structure of the bluegillpopulation is also unchanged.  Approximately one of three fish were 6 inches or greater.  Yellow perchabundance is limited.  Gillnet catches averaged 1.1 fish/net.  Gillnet catches never exceeded 1.4fish/net in previous surveys dating back to 1974.         </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Darling is a 954-acre basin located on the northwest edge of the city of Alexandria.  It is part of the Alexandria Chain of Lakes.  There is no public access site located on Lake Darling, however boaters can gain access via a navigable channel from Lake Carlos.  The lake is popular for both angling and other water-based recreation.  The 450-acre Arrowwood Resort and Conference Center is located along the west shore.  Most of the shoreline is heavily developed with residential housing.  Water quality and clarity are considered good.  Secchi disk transparency averaged about 11 feet during summer months in 2004.  The lake supports an abundant and diverse aquatic plant community.  These aquatic plants help to maintain water quality and clarity by competing with algae for the available nutrients in the lake.  Aquatic plants also provide spawning habitat and cover for many fish species, especially bass and panfish.   Lake Darling supports a stable, well-balanced fish community.  Largemouth bass, bluegill, black crappie, and northern pike are abundant and provide ample fishing opportunities.  Anglers can expect high catch rates for all of these species.  The lake is well known to bass anglers.  The Alex chain hosts several largemouth bass tournaments throughout the year.  Most have been based out of the Arrowwood Resort.   Walleye are present in low to moderate numbers.  Gill net catches averaged 3.4 fish/net in 2004.  Walleye stocking was initiated in 2000.  Various sizes of fingerlings, yearlings, and adults were stocked in 2000, 2001, 2002, and 2003, however these initial stockings did not appear to increase walleye abundance.      </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Darling is a 945-acre basin located on the northwest edge of the city of Alexandria.  It is part of the Alexandria Chain of Lakes.  There is no public access on Lake Darling; however, boaters can gain access via a navigable channel from Lake Carlos.  The lake is popular for both angling and other water-based recreation.  The 450-acre Arrowwood Resort and Conference Center is located along the west shore.  Most of the shoreline is heavily developed with residential housing.  Water quality and clarity are considered good.  Mid-summer Secchi disk transparency was recorded at 9.0 feet.  The lake supports an abundant and diverse aquatic plant community.  Aquatic plants help to maintain water quality and clarity by competing with algae for the available nutrients in the lake.  Aquatic plants also provide spawning habitat and cover for many fish species, especially bass and panfish.  Turtle Bay is posted as a no-wake zone to protect the aquatic vegetation.  It is also posted as a fish spawning area, which prohibits fishing from April 1 to June 30.  <br> \n <br> \nLake Darling supports a stable, well-balanced fish community.  Largemouth bass, northern pike and bluegill are abundant and provide good fishing opportunities.  Anglers can expect high catch rates for all of these species.  The lake is well known to bass anglers.  The Alexandria Chain hosts several largemouth bass tournaments throughout the year.  Walleye are present in low numbers.  Various sizes of walleye have been stocked annually since 2000.  These stockings have yet to signficantly increase walleye abundance.  Anglers may be able to enhance success of walleye fingerling stocking and improve fish community balance by harvesting from the surplus of small northern pike and largemouth bass. <br> \n</p>",
