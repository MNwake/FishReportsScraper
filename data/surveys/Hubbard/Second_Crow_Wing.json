Park Rapids staff conducted a survey targeting near shore fish species on July 18, 2019 to assess populations of non-game and small sport fish.  Ten 100-foot sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake shore, sampling a variety of habitat types.  Each site was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot 1/8th-inch mesh seine, depending on habitat conditions.   <br> \n <br> \nDuring this assessment, three sites were sampled with a 50-foot seine and four sites were sampled with a 15-foot seine. Site conditions prevented the use of seines at three sites.  Backpack electrofishing was done at all 10 sites, several of which were conducted from the side of the boat.  Nearshore sampling captured ten species of fish including two species intolerant of disturbance; Banded Killifish and Blackchin Shiner.  Other species sampled during the nearshore effort included Bluegill, Common Shiner, Johnny Darter, Largemouth Bass, Pumpkinseed, Rock Bass, Yellow Bullhead, and Yellow Perch.  Nearshore catches will be used along with gill net and trap net catch data from a standard fisheries survey conducted on June 24, 2019, to calculate a fish-based Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) score, which is indicative of the health of Second Crow Wing Lake.   <br> \n <br> \nThis survey is contributing to a watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.  Second Crow Wing Lake is located in the Crow Wing River Watershed.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Second Crow Wing Lake is located twelve miles southeast of Park Rapids in southeastern Hubbard County.  Second Crow Wing has a surface area of 294 acres and a maximum depth of 36 feet.  There is no public boat ramp located on Second Crow Wing; however, boating access is possible by going downstream from Third Crow Wing or upstream from First Crow Wing with smaller craft.  There is state-owned land on the southeast shore of the lake that allows access for carry-in or small craft.  Second Crow Wing supports a popular fishery for northern pike, panfish, and walleye. <br> \n <br> \nThe Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics.  Second Crow Wing is in class 31.  Other area lakes in this same classification include: Fifth through Eighth Crow Wing Lakes, Duck, Hinds, and Lower Twin. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance (3.5 walleye/gillnet) was near the current management goal of 4.0 walleye/gillnet.  Second Crow Wing is stocked with walleye fingerlings during odd numbered years.  Northern pike were sampled in high numbers (11.6 pike/gillnet), above the range \"typical\" for this lake class.  Northern pike abundance in past surveys has fluctuated from moderate to high numbers.  Sampled northern pike had an average length and weight of 21.1 inches and 2.3 pounds with pike measured up to 34.2 inches.  Yellow perch and tullibee (cisco) populations provide a good forage base for walleye and northern pike. <br> \n <br> \nPanfish are a popular choice for anglers on Second Crow Wing.  Anglers will find good numbers of bluegill and pumpkinseed in the 6-8 inch size range and black crappie in the 8-10 inch size range.  Largemouth bass are fond in low to moderate numbers in Second Crow Wing when compared to other lakes in Crow Wing chain.  Smallmouth bass are also present in Second Crow Wing and have been sampled in low numbers in past surveys. <br> \nSecond Crow Wing supports good populations of white sucker and shorthead redhorse, and anglers pursuing these species will find high numbers in the inlet and outlet areas. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled included moderate numbers of bowfin (dogfish), yellow bullhead, and rock bass.  Green sunfish were sampled in low numbers. <br> \n</p>",

Below average on carp, bowfin, red horse, and black bullhead.Management Recommendations:It is recommended that walleye fingerlings be stocked each year.  The rate of stocking to be 1.0 pound per littoral acre, rate of fingerlings to be 50 fish per pound or larger.  The spawning facilities are adequate to maintain the other species.  Rough fish populations are no problem at this time, although carp are present and may have to be controlled in the future.</p>",

Second Crow Wing has a surface area of 294 acres and a maximum depth of 36 feet.  There is no public boat ramp located on Second Crow Wing, however, boating access is possible by going downstream from Third Crow Wing or upstream from First Crow Wing.  Second Crow Wing supports a popular fishery for northern pike, panfish, and walleye.The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical and chemical characteristics.  Second Crow Wing is in class 31.  Other area lakes in this same classification include: Fifth through Eighth Crow Wing Lakes, Duck, Hinds, and Lower Twin.Walleye were sampled in good numbers with the gillnet catch rate of 5.1 walleye/net above the current management goal of 4.0 walleye/net.  An aggressive DNR stocking program is maintaining the walleye population in Second Crow Wing.  Age analysis showed heavy contribution of walleye from stocked years with limited contribution from natural reproduction.  Second Crow Wing is stocked with walleye fingerlings during odd numbered years.  Important walleye and northern pike forage species such as yellow perch and tullibee (cisco) were sampled in good numbers.  Northern pike were sampled in moderate numbers (5.5 pike/gillnet), within the range \"typical\" for this lake class.  Northern pike abundance in past surveys has been higher.  Sampled northern pike had an average length and weight of 22.7 inches and 2.8 pounds, with pike measured up to 31.9 inches.Panfish are a popular choice for anglers on Second Crow Wing.  Anglers will find good numbers of bluegill and pumpkinseed in the 6-8 inch size range.  Black crappie abundance was up from past surveys.  Good numbers of 7-8 inch crappie were sampled and should provide good fishing in a few years.  Bluegill and black crappie displayed good growth rates when compared to other class 31 lakes.Largemouth bass are found in low to moderate numbers in Second Crow Wing.  Spring electrofishing was conducted and largemouth bass were sampled in low numbers (24 bass/hour) when compared to other lakes within the Crow Wing chain, such as Fifth and Sixth Crow Wing.  The number of largemouth bass sampled over 15 inches was low when compared to other area lakes.  Smallmouth bass are present in Second Crow Wing and have been sampled in low numbers in past surveys.White sucker and shorthead redhorse are abundant in Second Crow Wing, and anglers looking to pursue these species will find high numbers in the inlet and outlet areas.Other species sampled included moderate numbers of brown bullhead, yellow bullhead, rock bass, and bowfin.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>In comparison with the statewide averages, the preceding tables indicate: (1) Good populations of suckers, walleye, dogfish, bullhead, pumpkinseed, and rock bass, (2) about average populations of northern pike, yellow perch, and bluegill, (3) below average populations or absence from the nets of all other species, (4) rapid growth rates for northern pike, pumpkinseed and bluegill, and (5) adequate growth rates for walleye.Discussion and Summary:Second Crow Wing is a hard-water lake of good chemical fertility.  This lake appears to have good spawning areas and other suitable ecological conditions to maintain satisfactory populations of walleye, northern pike, and centrarchids.  Growth rates are rapid for northern pike, and sunfish; walleye are growing at an adequate rate.Fish Stocking:Natural reproduction does not appear to be a limiting factor.  It is unlikely that stocking will significantly improve fishing.Fish Stocking Record:Stocking records show that the lake was first planted with fish in 1909.  Between that date and 1945 walleye, northern pike, crappie and bass were planted.  The stocking record for the past ten years is as follows:Year\t\tSpecies\t\tSize\t\tNumber1946\t\tWAE\t\tFry\t\t120,0001947\t\tWAE\t\tFgl\t\t  1,0081948\t\tWAE\t\tFgl\t\t 12,2401955\t\tBLC\t\tYrl\t\t  2,2041955\t\tWAE\t\tFry\t\t600,000Fish Removal1944-45\t\tBullheads\t\t2,261 lbsFishing Report:The methods of fishing most commonly used on this lake are still fishing for panfish and trolling for walleyes.The angling success for the current season has been fair for walleye and fair to good for sunfish.According to local reports sunfish fishing was at a peak between 1949 and 1953.Aquatic Plants:Aquatic plants are common to a depth of about 10 feet and are found to be very abundant along most of the shoreline.</p>",

The average weight of walleyes sampled was 2.0 pounds with 51% in the 15 to 22 inch range.  Northern pike abundance is near the upper end of the range expected for this lake class.  The average size of northern pike sampled in 1994 was 19.6 inches and 2.0 pounds.  Largemouth bass were taken in good numbers but the size was small; 90% of the fish were between 4.8 and 6.4 inches.  Black crappie abundance was at the low end of the range for lakes in this class.  Their abundance has been variable historically.  Largemouth bass and black crappie should have extra sampling with specialized gear to better evaluate their population parameters.    Bluegills were sampled in fairly low numbers, but still within the range expected for this lake class.  They had a small size structure with none over 7.7 inches.  Yellow perch abundance is above the third quartile for lakes in this class and should provide an excellent forage base for the predator species.  Yellow perch sampled had a small size structure with only one yellow perch exceeding 8.0 inches.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Second Crow Wing Lake is located twelve miles southeast of Park Rapids in southeastern Hubbard County.  Second Crow Wing has a surface area of 294 acres and a maximum depth of 36 feet.  There is no public boat ramp located on Second Crow Wing, however, boating access is possible by going downstream from Third Crow Wing or upstream from First Crow Wing.  Second Crow Wing supports a popular fishery for northern pike, panfish, and walleye.The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical and chemical characteristics.  Second Crow Wing is in class 31.  Other area lakes in this same classification include: Fifth thru Eighth Crow Wing Lakes, Duck, Hinds, and Lower Twin.Northern pike numbers were high (12.5/gillnet), similar to the previous surveys in 1986, 1989, and 1994.  While northern pike were abundant, size was small with an average length and weight of 19.4 inches and 1.6 pounds.  Largest northern pike sampled was 35.0 inches. Walleye were sampled in moderate numbers (3.0 walleye/gillnet), but below the management goal of 4.0 walleye/gillnet.  Walleye numbers were higher in the previous survey in 1994 (8.2 walleye/gillnet), while other surveys had walleye catch rates similar to 1999.  Average size of walleye was large, 19.5 inches and 2.8 pounds.  Walleye up to 27.1 inches were sampled.  Assessing walleye natural reproduction in Second Crow Wing is difficult due to the fact that walleye stocking has occurred in ten of the past twelve years.  In the 1999 survey 10 of 35 walleye sampled corresponded to non-stocked years.  Since 1995 Second Crow Wing has been stocked with walleye fingerlings in odd years.  Prior to 1995, walleye were stocked in three out of four years.  Changing the walleye stocking schedule to every other year will allow for better assessment of walleye natural reproduction.  Yellow perch, an important forage specie for walleye were sampled in low to moderate numbers.  Yellow perch are small in size and are not an acceptable size for angling. Panfish are a popular choice for anglers on Second Crow Wing.  Moderate numbers of bluegill and pumpkinseed  were sampled.  While average size of bluegill was small (5.2 inches), larger fish are present with fish sampled up to 9.3 inches.  Low to moderate numbers of black crappie were sampled, similar to past surveys.  Sampled black crappie had a average length of 8.5 inches.  Both bluegill and black crappie displayed good growth rates when compared to other class 31 lakes. Spring electrofishing was conducted for the first time on Second Crow Wing to assess the largemouth bass population.  While catch rates were moderate (34 largemouth bass/hour), largemouth bass numbers were lower when compared to other lakes within the Crow Wing chain, such as Fifth and Sixth Crow Wing.  The inlet and outlet areas have good beds of submerged aquatic vegetation, and these areas are where the majority of the largemouth bass were sampled.  Sampled largemouth bass were small, with a mean length of 8.5 inches but with fish measured up to 16.3 inches.  Four smallmouth bass were sampled while electrofishing ranging from 7.3 to 14.3 inches.  No smallmouth bass have been sampled in past surveys using gillnets or trapnets. Other species in moderate to abundant numbers include: white sucker, shorthead redhorse, tullibee (cisco), rock bass, and bowfin (dogfish).  Species sampled in low numbers include yellow bullhead, brown bullhead, and black bullhead.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Second Crow Wing Lake is located twelve miles southeast of Park Rapids in southeastern Hubbard County.  Second Crow Wing has a surface area of 221 acres and a maximum depth of 36 feet.  There is no public boat ramp located on Second Crow Wing; however, boating access is available by going downstream from Third Crow Wing or upstream from First Crow Wing Lake with smaller craft.  There is state-owned land on the southeast shore of the lake that allows access for carry-in craft.  The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical and chemical characteristics.  Second Crow Wing is in lake class 31.  Other area lakes in this same classification include: Fifth thru Eighth Crow Wing Lakes, Duck, Hinds, and Lower Twin. <br> \n <br> \nSecond Crow Wing supports a popular fishery for Northern Pike, panfish, and Walleye.  Walleye abundance (3.8 walleye/gill net) was similar to recent surveys.  Present and past surveys have shown walleye stocking by the DNR is contributing heavily to the walleye population in Second Crow Wing.  Northern pike abundance (5.0 pike/gill net) was within the range typical for this lake class.  Northern Pike numbers in past surveys has fluctuated from moderate to high numbers.  Sampled Northern Pike had an average length and weight of 21.2 inches and 2.7 pounds, with the largest measuring 42.7 inches.  Yellow Perch and Tullibee (Cisco) populations in Second Crow Wing provide a good forage base for Walleye and Northern Pike.  Yellow Perch are small in size, with few fish of an acceptable size for angling. <br> \n <br> \nPanfish are a popular choice for anglers on Second Crow Wing.  Present and past surveys have shown good populations of Bluegill, Pumpkinseed, and Black Crappie in Second Crow Wing.  Anglers will find decent numbers of Bluegill and Pumpkinseed in the 6 to 8 inch size range and Black Crappie in the 9 to 12 inch size range.  Largemouth Bass are found in low to moderate numbers in Second Crow Wing when compared to other lakes in the Crow Wing chain.  Smallmouth Bass are also present and have been sampled in low numbers in past surveys.  Good water quality, aquatic vegetation cover, and spawning substrate provide excellent habitat for panfish and bass in Second Crow Wing.  Second Crow Wing supports good populations of White Sucker and Redhorse, and anglers pursuing these species will find high numbers in the inlet and outlet areas. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled included moderate numbers of Rock Bass, Bowfin (Dogfish), and Yellow Bullhead.  Brown Bullhead were sampled in low numbers. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers should be aware that faucet snails, and aquatic invasive species (AIS) are present in Second Crow Wing.  To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Second Crow Wing Lake is located six miles east of Hubbard in southern Hubbard County.  Second Crow Wing is part of a chain of lakes running from Eleventh Crow Wing Lake at the headwaters, down to First Crow Wing Lake.  Second Crow Wing Lake has a surface area of 221 acres and a maximum depth of 35 feet.  A public access is located within the Crow Wing Chain Wildlife Management Area (WMA) on the southeast shore of Second Crow Wing Lake.  The access is earthen, steep, tight, with limited parking area and generally used for carry in or small boats. <br> \n <br> \nThe Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics.  Second Crow Wing Lake is in Lake Class 31.  Class 31 lakes generally have very hard water, and regularly shaped shorelines.  Other class 31 lakes in the Park Rapids area include: Fifth, Sixth and Seventh Crow Wings, Boulder, Duck, Evergreen, Hattie, Hinds, Shingobee, Tripp and Lower Twin.  <br> \nWalleyes were sampled in moderate numbers, with a good size for anglers.  Walleyes ranged from 11.5 to 25.5 inches with an average length of 15.5 inches.  Yellow Perch, an important forage species for both Walleye and Northern Pike were sampled in very low numbers.  Most perch were too small for angers, at 5 - 7.5 inches. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers can expect to find good numbers of Northern Pike in Second Crow Wing Lake.  Northern Pike had an average length and weight of 20.5 inches and 2 pounds, with fish measured up to 37 inches. <br> \n <br> \nSecond Crow Wing Lake supports a healthy panfish population and can provide good fishing for Bluegill and Black Crappie.  Bluegills were sampled in good numbers, similar to past surveys. The majority sampled were 3-7 inches, but anglers will find larger Bluegills up to 9 inches.  Black Crappie were sampled in low numbers with an average size of 7 inches.   <br> \nSpring sampling showed good numbers of Largemouth Bass.  Size was generally small, with an average length of 10 inches.  Most bass were under 16 inches, but fish up to 18 inches were sampled. <br> \n <br> \nSecond Crow Wing Lake was listed in 2011 as infested with faucet snails, an aquatic invasive species (AIS).  To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access.</p>",
