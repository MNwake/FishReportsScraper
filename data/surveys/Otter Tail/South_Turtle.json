The average weight of northern pike increased from 1.6 lbs. to 2.1 lbs.  Pike reproduction appears to be consistent as ages I+ to VI+ were represented in the age sample.  <br> \n     Bluegill abundance has been increasing since the 1970 survey, from 36.6 per trap net lift to 132.3 per trap net lift.  Bluegill size distribution is very similar to that found in previous surveys.   <br> \n     Largemouth bass abundance continues to increase.  Age classes I+ to VI+ were represented in the sample.  <br> \n     Yellow perch numbers remain very low. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>South Turtle Lake is located in central Otter Tail County approximately four miles east of Underwood, MN.  South Turtle Lake is a 630-acre moderately fertile lake that is located within the Otter Tail River Watershed.  The immediate watershed is composed primarily of agricultural land interspersed with hardwood woodlots.  The maximum depth is 35 feet; however, 63 percent of the lake is less than 15 feet deep.  The secchi disk reading during the 2000 lake survey was 15.8 feet which indicates excellent water clarity.  Previous secchi disk readings have ranged from 5.5 to 12.7 feet.  Periodic plankton/algae blooms throughout the summer months can influence secchi disk readings.  South Turtle Lake is included in lake class 25 of the Minnesota DNR's lake classification scheme.     The north and west shorelines have been extensively developed.  Homes, cottages, and resorts compose the majority of the development.  The 1996 lake resurvey referenced 112 homes/cabins and two resorts/campgrounds.  A state owned public access is located 0.5 miles south of County Road 122 along the north shoreline of the lake.  The shoal water substrates consist primarily of sand, gravel, and rubble.  South Turtle Lake is composed of two distinct basins.  The west basin is deeper and more developed.  A large stand of hardstem bulrush is located along the east and south shorelines.  The east basin is shallower (less than 15 feet) and less developed.  Hardstem bulrush and common cattail are prevalent along the shoreline of this basin.  Emergent aquatic plants such as bulrush and cattail provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat, and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms, and can actually absorb and break down polluting chemicals.  Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish such as northern pike, largemouth bass, and panfish.  They also serve as important nursery areas for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit.  To maintain the excellent water quality and angling that this lake has to offer, it is imperative to preserve the quality of the aquatic habitat.       South Turtle Lake can be ecologically classified as a bass-panfish type of lake and this is reflected in the assemblage of the fish community.  Northern pike, largemouth bass, walleye, black crappie, and bluegill are the dominant species in the fish community.  The prolificacy of these species can be attributed to the abundance of suitable spawning habitat that is available.      The northern pike test-net catch rate has remained stable in recent surveys and is within the normal range for lake class 25.  Pike ranged in length from 14.7 to 29.3 inches with an average length and weight of 17.9 inches and 1.2 pounds.  Pike grow slow in comparison to pike in other lake class 25 lakes; pike attain an average length of 18.8 inches at four years of age.  The slow growth rates may be attributed to the low abundance of yellow perch, a preferred forage fish.     Test-net catch data indicate that largemouth bass are abundant.  Bass ranged in length from 9.1 to inches with an average length and weight of 12.5 inches and 1.1 pounds.  Age data indicate that largemouth bass reproduction is consistently good.  Bass exhibit good growth rates with an average length of 12.0 inches at four years of age.     The test-net catch rate for walleye was equivalent to the upper limit of the normal range for lake class 25.  Walleye abundance has typically exceeded the normal range in test-net surveys.   Walleye ranged in length from 9.8 to 24.2 inches with an average length and weight of 16.9 inches and 1.8 pounds.  Data indicate that natural reproduction supplemented with fingerling stocking is maintaining the walleye population at management goals.  Walleye growth rates are excellent with an average length of 14.7 inches at three years of age.     Catch data indicate that black crappie and bluegill are abundant.  Crappies ranged in length from 5.4 to 13.8 inches with an average length of 10.2 inches.  Seventy percent of the crappies in a special spring trapnetting assessment were 10.0 inches or greater in length.  Black crappies reach an average length of 10.3 inches at four years of age.  Bluegills also exhibit a good size structure; thirty-one percent of the bluegills sampled in the survey were at least 7.0 inches in length.  Bluegill reach an average length of 7.2 inches at six years of age.     Anglers can maintain the quality of angling by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large-size fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>   South Turtle Lake is a 630-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located in central Otter Tail County approximately four miles east of Underwood, MN.  South Turtle Lake is located within the Pomme De Terre River Watershed.  The immediate watershed is composed primarily of agricultural land interspersed with hardwood woodlots.  The maximum depth is 35 feet; however, 63% of the lake is less than 15 feet in depth.  The secchi disk reading was 17.5 feet.  Previous secchi disk readings ranged from 5.5 to 15.8 feet.   <br> \n     The north and west shorelines have been extensively developed.  Homes, cottages, and resorts compose the majority of the development.  A state owned concrete public access is located off of County Road 122 along the north shoreline of the lake.  Shoal water substrates consist primarily of sand, gravel, and rubble.  South Turtle Lake is composed of two distinct basins.  The west basin is deeper and more developed.  A large stand of hardstem bulrush is located along the southeast shoreline of this basin.  The east basin is shallower (less than 15 feet) and less developed.  Hardstem bulrush and cattails are prevalent along the shoreline of this basin.  Emergent plants provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat, and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They provide critical spawning and nursery habitat for fish species such as Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, and sunfish.  They protect shorelines from erosion and can actually absorb and break down pollutants.  Because of their ecological importance, bulrush and cattails may not be removed without a DNR permit. <br> \n     South Turtle Lake can be ecologically classified as a bass-panfish type of lake and this is reflected in the assemblage of the fish community. The dominant gamefish species are Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, Bluegill, and Black Crappie.  The prolificacy of these species can be attributed to the abundance of suitable spawning habitat that is available. <br> \n     A moderate-density Northern Pike population exists.  Northern Pike ranged in length from 13.0 to 30.9 inches with an average length and weight of 20.4 inches and 2.0 pounds.  Pike attain an average length of 22.9 inches at four years of age. <br> \n     Age and length data indicate that a balanced Largemouth Bass population exists.  Age data indicate that bass reproduction is consistently good.  Bass ranged in length from 7.3 to 18.7 inches with an average length and weight of 13.0 inches and 1.3 pounds.  Bass attain an average length of 13.3 inches at five years of age.       <br> \n     Black Crappies have remained consistently abundant over the recent series of surveys.  Black crappies ranged in length from 7.9 to 13.1 inches.  Thirty percent of the crappies were 10.0 inches or greater in length.  Black crappies attain an average length of 9.5 inches at six years of age.   <br> \n     Bluegills have also remained abundant.  Bluegill reproduction has been consistently good.  Twenty-eight percent of the Bluegills were 7.0 inches or greater in length.  Bluegills attain an average length of 6.7 inches at five years of age. <br> \n     Walleye abundance is low.  Walleyes ranged in length from 16.6 to 24.8 inches with an average length and weight of 20.6 inches and 3.4 pounds.   <br> \n     Anglers can help maintain the quality of angling by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large size fish while allowing the harvest of the more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future. <br> \n     South Turtle Lake is not listed as an infested water.  Aquatic invasive species are threatening Minnesota waters.  The non-native species can potentially harm water quality, water recreation, aquatic habitat, native species, and fish populations.  Anglers can help prevent the introduction and spread of invasive species by following watercraft transportation laws.  Anglers are required to remove all visible plants, mud, and other prohibited invasive species and drain all water from their boat prior to leaving the water access.    <br> \n    <br> \n</p>",

IBI data was collected in conjunction with Minnesota Pollution Control Agency watershed sampling. Fourteen 100-foot sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake shore, sampling a variety of habitat types.  Each site is sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot 1/8th-inch mesh seine, depending on habitat conditions.  Sites where habitat conditions did not allow for seining were backpack electrofished unless conditions proved difficult for walking. These sites were backpack shocked from the boat. Fourteen fish species were represented, including young of the year gamefish species such as Northern Pike, and Largemouth Bass. Non-game species sampled included Banded Killifish, Iowa Darter, and Pugnose Shiner. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of the nearshore fish community in South Turtle Lake was conducted by Fisheries Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program Staff starting July 24, 2018 on South Turtle Lake. Fourteen sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 15-foot or 50-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at all 14 sites with five sites sampled from the boat. Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample six sites, a 15-foot seine was used at three sites, and soft sediments with abundant vegetation and deep water prevented the use of seines at five sampling site. Nearshore sampling captured 17 native species of fish including five species that are intolerant of disturbance (Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, and Pugnose Shiner) and 1 species that is tolerant of disturbance (Green Sunfish). <br> \n <br> \nData from this targeted nearshore survey is combined with trap net and gill net data from an August 2017 standard survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based Index of Biological Integrity (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment. The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. The FIBI score for South Turtle Lake from this survey is just below an impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes. For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website. <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Pomme de Terre River Watershed assessment of surface waters process completed in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>     South Turtle Lake is a 630-acre moderately fertile lake located in central Otter Tail County, approximately four miles east of Underwood, MN.  South Turtle Lake is located within the Pomme De Terre River Watershed.  The immediate watershed is composed primarily of agricultural land interspersed with hardwood woodlots.  The maximum depth is 35 feet; however, 63% of the lake is less than 15 feet in depth.  The secchi disk reading during the 2011 survey was 11.7 feet.  Previous secchi disk readings have ranged from 5.5 to 15.8 feet.   <br> \n     The north and west shorelines have been extensively developed.  Homes, cottages, and resorts compose the majority of the development.  The 1996 lake resurvey referenced 112 homes/cabins and two resorts/campgrounds.  A state owned concrete public access is located 0.5 miles south of County Road 122 along the north shoreline of the lake.  Shoal water substrates consist primarily of sand, gravel, and rubble.  South Turtle Lake is composed of two distinct basins.  The west basin is deeper and more developed.  A large stand of hardstem bulrush is located along the southeast shoreline of this basin.  The east basin is shallower (less than 15 feet) and less developed.  Hardstem bulrush and cattails are prevalent along the shoreline of this basin.  Emergent plants provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat, and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They provide critical spawning and nursery habitat for fish species such as northern pike, largemouth bass, and sunfish.  They protect shorelines from erosion and can actually absorb and break down pollutants.  Because of their ecological importance, bulrush and cattails may not be removed without a DNR permit. <br> \n     South Turtle Lake can be ecologically classified as a bass-panfish type of lake and this is reflected in the assemblage of the fish community. The dominant gamefish species are northern pike, largemouth bass, bluegill, and black crappie.  The prolificacy of these species can be attributed to the abundance of suitable spawning habitat that is available. <br> \n     A moderate-density northern pike population exists.  Northern pike ranged in length from 13.6 to 31.1 inches with an average length and weight of 18.9 inches and 1.5 pounds.  Pike attain an average length of 19.1 inches at four years of age. <br> \n     Data from a spring electrofishing assessment indicated that a balanced largemouth bass population exists.  Age data indicate that bass reproduction is consistently good.  Bass ranged in length from 7.0 to 17.6 inches with an average length of 11.9 inches.  Bass attain an average length of 12.0 inches at four years of age.       <br> \n     Black crappies have remained consistently abundant over the recent series of surveys.  Black crappies ranged in length from 4.4 to 11.3 inches.  Thirteen percent were 10.0 inches or greater in length.  Age data indicates that reproduction has been consistently good in recent years.  Black crappies attain an average length of 8.2 inches at five years of age.   <br> \n     Bluegills have also remained consistently abundant.  Twenty-two percent of the bluegills were 7.0 inches or greater in length.  Bluegills attain an average length of 6.7 inches at six years of age. <br> \n     Walleyes ranged in length from 12.6 to 25.6 inches with an average length and weight of 19.3 inches and 2.5 pounds.   <br> \n     Anglers can help maintain the quality of angling by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large size fish while allowing the harvest of the more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future. <br> \n</p>",
