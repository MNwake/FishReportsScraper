It has a good population of young northerns and a large population of bluegills, which appear to be growing normally.  The walleye population is low and traceable in origin to artificial stocking.Although the northern pike and panfish provide adequate fishing it is probable that better walleye fishing could be provided with a stocking program to bolster the walleye population.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Maud Lake is known primarily as a northern pike, largemouth bass, and panfish lake which also has a modest population of relatively large walleyes.  Suitable spawning habitat is present for all fish species except walleye in Maud Lake and the walleye fishery is maintained by regular stocking.  High density walleye stocking (3-4 times normal rates) during the 1980's was not successful at producing higher catch rates.  Walleye catches have remained relatively stable throughout history in Maud Lake regardless of stocking rates.  There is a current evaluation of walleye fry vs walleye fingerling stocking ongoing. <br> \n <br> \nWalleyes captured during the 2010 survey averaged 3.8 pounds each.  No exceptionally strong year classes were found, although age five fish were most common.  Rather, age groups from eight year classes ranging from five years to at least 13 years were sampled.  Despite low catches of yellow perch (a main forage species), walleye growth rates were nearly as fast as statewide averages. <br> \n <br> \nNet catches of northern pike and largemouth bass were near the top ends of normal ranges for class 31 lakes.  The catch rate for each of these was slightly higher than Maud Lake's historic average.  Pike averaged 19.7 inches and 1.9 pounds, although some over 30 inches were caught.  Largemouth bass averaged about 12 inches in length. <br> \n <br> \nHistorically, tullibee (cisco) were found in Maud Lake and are likely still present although none were captured in 2004 or 2010.  These fish are an indicator of relatively good water quality.  They require areas of cool, well-oxygenated water during the heat of summer to survive.  They are also an indicator of the potential for the lake to grow large pike, but only if pike can escape harvest long enough to grow to trophy size. <br> \n <br> \nBluegills are considered abundant in this lake, although catch rates were down in 2010.  Unfortunately, large bluegills are rare.  Although bluegills over eight inches were common in 1955, none have been sampled since 1981 and growth rates have slowed considerably.  It appears that most bluegills are harvested by the time they reach seven inches in Maud Lake.  Since, on average, it takes seven or eight years for a bluegill to reach eight inches in this lake, few bluegills survive past that size. <br> \n <br> \nIn effort to provide some opportunities to catch larger fish in Maud Lake, special regulations went into effect in 2008 for bass (12\" - 20\" protected slot with one allowed over 20\"), crappie (10\" minimum length and bag limit of five), northern pike (24\" - 36\" protected slot with one allowed over 36\"), and sunfish (bag limit of five).  Although it is far too early to tell, the next scheduled lake assessment (~2014) should begin to indicate whether these regulations are having the desired effect. <br> \n <br> \nIn general, anglers are encouraged to release medium to large fish (especially pike and bluegills) while keeping smaller fish for eating to balance the populations, sustain spawning age fish, and provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish.  Lakeshore owners are encouraged to practice good shoreline and land management stewardship.  Aquatic vegetation (especially bulrushes) provides spawning, rearing, and feeding cover for many fish species and is important for maintaining good water quality and protecting shorelines from erosion. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Maud Lake is known primarily as a Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, and panfish lake, while also containing a small number of Walleyes.  Suitable spawning habitat is present for all fish species except Walleye in Maud Lake and the Walleye fishery is maintained by stocking.  Special regulations have existed for Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, Bluegill, and Black Crappie since 2008.   <br> \n <br> \nAttempts to improve Walleye fishing by manipulating stocking rates have not resulted in increased Walleye abundance and the number of Walleye captured in 2016 was similar to past surveys.  Walleye captured averaged 2.6 pounds each and 19 inches long. <br> \n <br> \nCatch rates of Northern Pike in 2016 was at the lake's historical average around 8 per gill net, and much lower than the lake's historical high catch rate in 1985 of 16 per net.  Pike had an average size of 17 inches long.  A special regulation for Northern Pike requires anglers to release all pike from 24 to 36 inches, with the overall goal of the regulation to increase the size of Northern Pike in the population.  Although this is only the second survey since this regulation went into effect, the number of pike over 24 inches was not found to have increased in 2016 compared to previous surveys. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill abundance was found to be similar to past surveys.  The mean length of sampled Bluegills was 6.8 inches and lengths ranged from 3.7 to 8.5 inches.  Bluegill larger than 8.0 inches were sampled in Maud Lake in 2016, the first time since 1981.  Bluegill required 9 years to reach a length of 8 inches.  Historical evidence and information from anecdotal fishing pressure suggests the Bluegill population in Maud Lake was relatively unexploited in the 1950's.  The potential for Maud Lake to produce quality-sized Bluegills led to a special regulation that limited the bag limit to five Bluegills.  Theoretically, this should increase Bluegill size by allowing harvestable size Bluegills to remain in the population for continued growth.  Preliminary evidence suggests this regulation is having some success at increasing the overall size of Bluegill in Maud Lake. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie have never been sampled well in Maud Lake by trap net, but night electrofishing in the spring did produce a catch rate of 35.3 fish per hour.  Black crappie sampled by electrofishing had a mean length of 9.4 inches, with lengths ranging from 7.8 to 11.5 inches.  Black Crappie required just over 6 years to reach 10 inches long.  The special regulation for Black Crappie consists of a bag limit of 5 fish and a minimum length limit of 10 inches.  Goals of this regulation are to increase the abundance of Black Crappie and their size.  Black Crappie abundance continues to be evaluated after implementation of the regulation, but fish over 11 inches were sampled by electrofishing in 2016.      <br> \n <br> \nThe Largemouth Bass catch rate in trap nets in 2016 set a historical high at 3.6 fish per net.  Average size for Largemouth Bass was found to be around 12 inches.  Largemouth Bass up to age 16 were sampled, with a 14 inch Largemouth Bass being seven years old.  A special regulation exists for Largemouth Bass on Maud Lake since 2008.  It consists of a protected slot of 12-20 inches with only one over 20 inches allowed in possession.  The goal of this regulation is to increase the size of bass in the population.  The survey in 2016 found that the regulation was achieving this goal. <br> \n <br> \nHistorically, tullibee (cisco) were found in Maud Lake and are likely still present although none were captured in 2004, 2010, or 2016.  These fish are an indicator of relatively good water quality.  They require areas of cool, well-oxygenated water during the heat of summer to survive.  They are also an indicator of the potential for the lake to grow large pike, but only if pike can escape harvest long enough to grow to trophy size.  In general, anglers are encouraged to release medium to large fish (especially pike and bluegills) while keeping smaller fish for eating to balance the populations, sustain spawning age fish, and provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish.  Lakeshore owners are encouraged to practice good shoreline and land management stewardship.  Aquatic vegetation (especially bulrushes) provides spawning, rearing, and feeding cover for many fish species and is important for maintaining good water quality and protecting shorelines from erosion.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>The fish community in Maud Lake is subject to many of the same pressures as other central Minnesota lakes.  These influences, including angling, habitat degradation, weather patterns, and stocking, result in fluctuations in fish populations over time.  The initial lake survey report in 1954, for example, listed only 27 homes or cottages on the lake, compared to 139 in 1999.  Coupled with the five-fold increase in shoreline development was a loss of fish spawning and cover habitat.  In particular, bulrush beds have essentially been destroyed near areas of heavy shoreline development.  Yet, Maud Lake's fish community remains largely the same as it was in 1954, ecologically best suited for northern pike, bass, and panfish.  Good spawning habitat for walleye is lacking in the lake, but, stocking provides a small, stable walleye population that is noted for its large average size.  Test net sampled walleyes averaged over four pounds each in 1999.Some notable exceptions to the lake's stability included decreases in cisco (tullibee) numbers and in average size of bluegills.  Eight inch bluegills, common in 1955, have not been sampled in test nets since 1981.  It appears that most bluegills are harvested about the time they reach seven inches in length.  Since it takes seven or eight years to grow that big in Maud Lake, few bluegills make it past that size.Net catches of northern pike, bluegill, largemouth bass, and black crappie were each within normal ranges for similar lakes.  Sampled pike averaged 1.3 pounds each.  Largemouth bass were more abundant than they were in the 1950s.  Black crappie appeared to be rebounding in 1999 following 26 years of very low net catches.  The mean length of mature crappies sampled by electrofishing during early June was 9.42 inches.  Those fish would weigh approximately 1/2 pound each.In view of increasing shoreline development pressures on this lake as well as most other area lakes, it would behoove lakeshore owners to implement good stewardship practices in all land and vegetation alterations.  Owners can help to sustain water quality, fish populations, and property values by: (1) leaving or establishing buffer strips of natural vegetation along the shores, (2) leaving aquatic vegetation stands intact, especially bulrush and cattail beds, (3) not fertilizing lawns or using phosphorus free fertilizers, (4) ensuring compliance of septic systems, (5) continuing active participation in the lake association and in the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency's Citizen Lake-Monitoring Program, and (6) utilizing practices illustrated in the DNR document \"Lakescaping for Wildlife and Water Quality\" when landscaping shoreline property.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Maud Lake is known primarily as a northern pike, largemouth bass, and panfish lake which also has a modest population of relatively large walleyes.  Suitable spawning habitat is present for all fish species except walley in Maud Lake and the walleye fishery is maintained by regular fingerling stocking.  High density walleye stocking (3-4 times normal rates) during the 1980's was not successful at producing higher catch rates.  Walleye catches have remained relatively stable throughout history in Maud Lake regardless of stocking rates.Walleyes captured during the 2004 survey averaged 3.2 pounds each.  No exceptionally strong year classes were found.  Rather, age groups from six year classes ranging from three years to at least 14 years were sampled.  Despite low catches of yellow perch (a main forage species), walleye growth rates were somewhat faster than statewide averages.Net catches of northern pike and largemouth bass were within the normal ranges for class 31 lakes.  Catch rates for each of these were slightly higher than Maud Lake's historic average.  Pike averaged 18.3 inches and 1.4 pounds, although some over 30 inches were caught.  Largemouth bass averaged about 12 inches in length.Historically, tullibee (cisco) were found in Maud Lake and are likely still present although none were captured in 2004.  These fish are an indicator of relatively good water quality.  They require areas of cool, well-oxygenated water during the heat of summer to survive.  They are also an indicator of the potential for the lake to grow large pike, but only if pike can escape harvest long enough to grow to trophy size.Bluegills are considered abundant in this lake.  Unfortunately, large bluegills are rare.  Although bluegills over eight inches were common in 1955, none have been sampled since 1981 and growth rates have slowed considerably.  It appears that most bluegills are harvested by the time they reach seven inches in Maud Lake.  Since, on average, it takes seven or eight years for a bluegill to reach eight inches in this lake, few bluegills survive past that size.Anglers are encouraged to release medium to large fish (especially pike and bluegills) while keeping smaller fish for eating to balance the populations, sustain spawning age fish, and provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish.  Lakeshore owners are encouraged to practice good shoreline and land management stewardship.  Aquatic vegetation (especially bulrushes) provides spawning, rearing, and feeding cover for many fish species and is important for maintaining good water quality and protecting shorelines from erosion.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Maud Lake is a 517-acre lake located in southwestern Becker County eleven miles southwest of Detroit Lakes.  Maud Lake is considered moderately productive and possesses 300 littoral acres. The lake's shoreline is highly developed along its southern and northern shores. Special regulations exist for sunfish, Black Crappie, and Largemouth Bass. Zebra mussels were discovered in the lake in 2016. <br> \n <br> \nCatch rates of Walleye in Maud Lake have remained low, despite stocking. The average catch rate of Walleye was about two per gill net in 2021, equivalent to the lake's historical average. Sampled Walleye ranged in length from 18.7 to 25.3 inches, averaging 21.5 inches long.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike catch rates have remained relatively stable in Maud Lake. The average catch rate of Northern Pike in 2021 was about five pike per gill net. Sampled Northern Pike ranged in length from 9.7 to 36.0 inches, averaging 18.6 inches long.  Of the sampled pike, 16% were 24 inches or longer. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill abundance was below average in 2021. Trap nets caught an average of 21 Bluegill per net. Sampled Bluegill ranged in length from 3.3 to 8.3 inches, averaging 6.3 inches long. On average, Bluegill reached a length of 4.5 inches by age five. The last two lake surveys (2016 and 2021) show evidence of improved Bluegill size, based on increased numbers of Bluegill 8 inches or longer being caught.  <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie catch rates have stayed low (less than 2 crappie per trap net) in Maud Lake. In 2021, a total of 18 crappie were caught. Sampled Black Crappie ranged in length from 8.0 to 11.2 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass abundance in 2021 was similar to 2016. Sampled Largemouth Bass in 2021 ranged in length from 8.2 to 19.8 inches, averaging 12.7 inches long. Aging indicated it takes four years for Largemouth Bass reach a length of eight inches.   <br> \n <br> \nAdditional species sampled in 2021 included Yellow Perch, Yellow Bullhead, Brown Bullhead, Bowfin, hybrid sunfish, Pumpkinseed, Rock Bass, Common Carp, and White Sucker. Yellow Bullhead were abundant in catch but only one Common Carp was caught. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers can help maintain and improve Maud Lake's fishery by harvesting small-moderately sized fish for eating and releasing larger fish, as well as taking precautions to prevent the spread of aquatic invasive species. Shoreline owners can help to improve water quality and fish habit in the lake by maintaining shoreline buffer zones and leaving native aquatic vegetation stands intact.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Fish populations are dynamic in all Minnesota lakes and Maud is no exception.  Even under the most stable conditions, fish community makeup will fluctuate over time and conditions on Maud Lake have not been particularly stable.  For instance, the initial lake survey report in 1954 listed only 27 homes or cottages on the lake, compared to 134 lake homes in 1989.  Coupled with the five-fold increase in shoreline development was a loss of fish spawning and cover habitat.  In particular, bulrush beds have essentially been destroyed near areas of heavy shoreline development.  Other factors that can magnify fluctuations in fish populations include fish stocking and increased fishing pressure, both of which have occurred in Maud Lake.  Yet, with a few notable exceptions, the lake's fish community is largely the same as it was in 1954, ecologically best suited for northern pike, bass, and panfish.     Northern pike, bluegill, walleye, largemouth bass, rock bass, and yellow perch populations in Maud Lake are all within the \"normal\" range for similar lakes.  Black crappie and tullibee (cisco) have all but disappeared from recent samples.  High density walleye fingerling stockings in 1981, 1985, and 1987 failed to significantly increase walleye numbers.  Northern pike are both predator and competitor to walleye.  Although small pike currently dominate the catch, approximately 15% of northern pike sampled in Maud Lake were longer than thirty inches.  Maud Lake is not known for giving up large numbers of walleye, but, those that are caught are generally large in size.  About 40% of the walleye sampled in test nets in 1994 were longer than 20 inches.     The bluegill population contains significantly fewer large fish (over eight inches) than in 1954, when fishing pressure was less of a factor.  No large bluegill, in fact, have been sampled in test nets during recent years.  While there may be some stunting of bluegill due to competition, it also appears that bluegill are being \"cropped off\" as soon as they reach a length of about six and a half or seven inches.  It is unclear what specifically caused the decline in black crappie abundance.  Increased fishing pressure, stocking of northern pike and walleye, and spawning habitat (bulrush bed) destruction may have all been contributing factors, although significant stands of bulrush remain along the west shore.     Bulrushes are valuable not only for fish habitat (spawning, rearing, feeding, and cover), but also for erosion protection, water quality improvement, and waterfowl habitat.  Remaining stands deserve utmost protection for the good of the lake.  Additionally, where native aquatic plants have been removed, conditions are favorable for invasion of exotic species.  Where new plant species have been introduced to a lake, for instance, the initial tendency is for that plant to occupy disturbed areas where native vegetation has already been removed rather than to invade healthy stands of native plants.     To summarize, fish populations in Maud Lake, and most other lakes, are in a constant state of change and are affected by many factors.  Watershed land and water management practices, shoreline alterations, riparian land use, vegetation removal, weather patterns, fish stocking, fish removal, fishing pressure, and other factors act together to impact the fish community in the lake.  Though shifts in fish populations have occurred during recent history, the basic ecological type of the lake has remained the same.  Maud Lake's fish community continues to be dominated by the species for which it is best suited, pike, bass, and panfish.</p>",
