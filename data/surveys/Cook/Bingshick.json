Bingshick Lake shows promise as a good place to try for trophy brook trout.As expected, no other game fish were captured.  The catch of white sucker was within the normal range for lakes of this class.</p>",

The average size of brook trout was large for the lake and the area.  These results can be partially explained by the fact that the lake was not stocked in 2009, so no one-year-old brook trout were present.  Growth rates of brook trout had been good.  The five age-2 fish averaged 14.2 inches long, and the single age-3 fish was 19.5 inches long. <br> \n <br> \nBeginning in 2010, the lake will be stocked only in even years.  As a result, beginning 2011, the summer population will consist of age-1 and age-3 fish in odd years, and age-2 and age-4 fish in even years.  Age-4 brook trout are never abundant, and the species usually dies of natural causes before age 5.</p>",

Three year classes were represented in the catch, and growth was average for brook trout in lakes in this area.The white sucker catch was below the normal range for lakes of this ecological class, but was about average for this lake historically.  The high white sucker abundance in this lake does not appear to have limited brook trout growth.</p>",
