The yellow perch was low at 8.00 per set and all of the fish measured but 1 ranged in size from 8.0 to 12.9 inches with a median length of 9.5 to 9.9 inches and a mean weight of 0.60 pounds.  The bluegill was very low at 2.50 per set and had a median length of 7.5 to 7.9 inches.  The bluegill showed average growth at all annulus.  The black crappie showed an extremely low population at 0.50 per set while the pumpkinseed and the black bullhead had low population at 0.50 and 3.50 per set respectively.  Note:  There is very little fishing pressure on Headquarters Lake.  The one cabin owner owns all the lakeshore around the lake.  Present populations of northern pike, bluegill, black crappie, and pumpkinseed most likely results of previous stocking (illegal) by only owner on the lake.</p>",
