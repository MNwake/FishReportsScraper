                "narrative": "<p>Town Lake is a relatively shallow, eutrophic lake that is subject to partial winterkills of some fish species.  Even though dissolved oxygen levels dropped to critical levels throughout much of the lake during harsh winters in 1993, 1994, and 1996, the fish community structure did not reflect any severe, recent winterkill.  It is likely that year round inflow from Acorn Lake provided a refuge area for some fish during the stressful periods. <br> \n <br> \nTest netting during June, 2007, continued to show abundant populations of bluegill, pumpkinseed, northern pike, and yellow bullhead.  Bluegills were more abundant than in the 1997 study but smaller and slower-growing.  The average bluegill was under six inches, but several over seven inches were found.  Northern pike averaged 21.1 inches and 2.24 pounds each.  Pike up to 28.5 inches long were caught.  Northern pike grow fairly rapidly in Town Lake, but not as fast as in 1997 when there were higher numbers of their preferred forage, yellow perch.  Perch catches declined since ten years ago and the average length was 6.6 inches. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie were also sampled in test nets but most were relatively small and young.  Since black crappies are difficult to sample in standard mid summer test net gear, it is not known whether larger, older crappies are suspended over deeper water or are simply harvested as soon as they reach \"keeper\" size.  Walleyes were not sampled but anglers reported occasional catches, especially several years ago. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled in test nets included bowfin (dogfish), largemouth bass, hybrid sunfish, pumpkinseed sunfish, all three species of bullhead, and white sucker.  In eutrophic, winterkill-susceptible lakes, black bullheads commonly outnumber yellow bullheads because black bullheads are more tolerant of low dissolved oxygen and poor water quality.  Town Lake is an exception in that few black bullheads were found compared to the abundant yellow bullheads. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike and panfish populations appear to be in ample supply for a productive fishery in Town Lake.  While some winterkill is nearly inevitable in this shallow, fertile lake, fishing can be good \"in between\" winterkills.  Landowners can help keep not only fish populations, but also property values and water quality high by using the best land management practices available.  Voluntarily exceeding shoreline setbacks for buildings and septic systems, not fertilizing lawns (or using phosphorus free fertilizers), leaving wide shoreline zones of unmown natural vegetation, limiting the amount of shoreline exposed to cattle activity, and leaving as much aquatic vegetation (especially emergents like bulrushes and cattails) intact as possible when obtaining access to open water can help to slow eutrophication (aging) of the lake. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Town Lake is a relatively shallow, eutrophic lake that is subject to partial winterkills of some fish species.  A standard survey was conducted in June 2017 using four gill nets and eight trap nets.   <br> \n <br> \nDespite annual Walley fry stocking since 2010, only one Walleye was sampled during the 2017 assessment.  No Walleyes have been caught in the previous assessments, although anglers may find them occasionally, as they are present in the Otter Tail River and may migrate into Town Lake.  The captured Walleye was 14.6 inches long.   <br> \n  <br> \nBluegills sampled during the 2017 assessment were of decent size, with an average length of nearly seven inches, and a maximum length of 9.3 inches.  During the assessment, many large Bluegills were observed on nests.  Spawning conditions are ideal in Town Lake.  Bluegill catch rates are similar to those observed in 2007, and above average for lakes of similar biological characteristics. <br> \n <br> \nOnly seven Black Crappies were sampled during the 2017 assessment.  Crappies ranged from 5.6 inches to 7.8 inches (trap net data), with an average length of 8.9 inches.  Crappie populations are more accurately sampled with electrofishing, which was not part of the 2017 assessment. <br> \n <br> \nThe population of Northern Pike in Town Lake has remained relatively stable over the three assessments that have been completed.  Over 13 pike were sampled in each gill net.  The average length of pike sampled was 21.8 inches, and the maximum length sampled was 31.3.  The natural characteristics of Town Lake make it ideal for Northern Pike, with abundant spawning habitat. <br> \n   <br> \nYellow Perch sampled during the 2017 were between 5.2 and 9.3 inches, with an average length of 6.9 inches.  The population is within normal range for lakes of similar conditions, and surprisingly stable, given the high Northern Pike population. <br> \n <br> \nBlack, Yellow, and Brown Bullheads are all present in Town Lake, while only Brown and Yellow Bullheads were sampled in 2017.  Average bullhead size was 10.0 inches (Yellow) and 13.1 inches (Brown). <br> \n   <br> \nOther fish sampled during the 2017 assessment include Bowfin, Hybrid Sunfish, Largemouth Bass, Pumpkinseed, and White Sucker. <br> \n <br> \nDissolved oxygen in Town Lake during the winter months of 2017-2018 reached critical levels, and winterkill is expected.  Detroit Lakes Area Fisheries will check Town Lake in spring, 2018 to determine if reestablishment of the fishery is necessary.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Town Lake is a relatively shallow, eutrophic lake that is subject to partial winterkills of some fish species.  Even though dissolved oxygen levels dropped to critical levels throughout much of the lake during harsh winters in 1993, 1994, and 1996, the fish community structure did not reflect any severe, recent winterkill.  It is likely that year round inflow from Acorn Lake provided a refuge area for some fish during the stressful periods.Test netting during June, 1997, showed abundant populations of bluegill, northern pike, and yellow perch.  Bluegills averaged nearly seven inches in length and some as long as 10.0 inches were sampled.  Town Lake bluegills are not stunted and the majority of those sampled were either seven or eight years old, providing a good fishery for panfish anglers.  Northern pike averaged 21.2 inches and 2.8 pounds each.  Pike up to 32.9 inches long were caught.  Northern pike grow rapidly in Town Lake, probably because of the abundance of preferred forage, yellow perch.  Perch up to 11.5 inches were captured but the average was just under eight inches.Black crappie were also sampled in test nets but most were relatively small and young.  Since black crappies are difficult to sample in standard mid summer test net gear, it is not known whether larger, older crappies are suspended over deeper water or are simply harvested as soon as they reach \"keeper\" size.  Walleyes were not sampled but anglers reported occasional catches, especially three or four years ago.Other species sampled in test nets included bowfin (dogfish), carp, hybrid sunfish, pumpkinseed sunfish, tadpole madtom, yellow bullhead, and white sucker.  In eutrophic, winterkill-susceptible lakes, black bullheads commonly outnumber yellow bullheads because black bullheads are more tolerant of low dissolved oxygen and poor water quality.  Town Lake is an exception in that no black bullheads were found even though they exist throughout the watershed.Northern pike and panfish populations appear to be in ample supply for a productive fishery in Town Lake.  While some winterkill is nearly inevitable in this shallow, fertile lake, fishing can be good \"in between\" winterkills.  Landowners can help keep not only fish populations, but also property values and water quality high by using the best land management practices available.  Voluntarily exceeding shoreline setbacks for buildings and septic systems, not fertilizing lawns (or using phosphorus free fertilizers), leaving wide shoreline zones of unmown natural vegetation, limiting the amount of shoreline exposed to cattle activity, and leaving as much aquatic vegetation (especially emergents like bulrushes and cattails) intact as possible when obtaining access to open water can help to slow eutrophication (aging) of the lake.</p>",
