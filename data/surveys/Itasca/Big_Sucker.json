                "narrative": "<p>Sucker Lake is 230 acres located four miles northwest of Nashwauk, MN.  The lake has a state administered access and moderate shoreline development. Black crappie catch rates for gill nets and trap nets were record highs for the lake in 2003.  The gill-net (9.2 fish/net) and trap net catch rates (7.8 fish/net) were higher than most lakes similar to Sucker Lake.  Although catch rates were high, most of the fish were small and the result of one strong year-class.  Fish sampled in gill nets ranged from 4.3 to 9.0 inches and averaged 6.1 inches.  Trap-net captured fish had a similar size distribution.  Five year-classes from one to five years old were sampled.  The strong 2001 year-class represented 71% of the sample.  Growth was slower than statewide averages for most ages.  Despite bluegill not being sampled in the initial assessment of 1972, they now represent a substantial part of the fish community.  In 2003, trap-net catch rates (27.8 fish/net) were above average for lakes similar to Sucker.  The fish ranged from 3.5 to 8.1 inches and averaged 5.4 inches.  Age and growth information was not collected in this assessment.Largemouth bass are difficult to sample with our standard summer netting gears and methods.  As a result, the gill-net catch was 1.0/net while the trap-net catch was 0.7/net.  These fish ranged from 5.3 to 14.0 inches.  Age and growth information was not collected in this assessment.Northern pike gill-net catch rates have increased from 5.0/net in 1972 to 11.2/net in 1988 and back to 5.0/net in 2003.  Lower northern pike catch rates often are associated with better size distributions.  The sampled fish ranged from 18.7 and 35.8 inches and averaged 25.6 inches.  Six year-classes from two to eight years old were determined from scale analysis.  Two and four year old fish represented 33 and 30% of the sample.  Growth was similar to statewide averages.  After four years of growth, northern pike averaged 26 inches.  Anglers concerned about protecting the quality of the northern pike population should consider releasing medium to large fish (>24.0 inches).  These fish help maintain balance within the pike population which ultimately provides stability for the fish community.  Yellow perch were sampled at a gill-net catch rate of 4.3 fish/net, which was below average for this lake type.  The fish ranged from 5.4 to 7.3 inches and had a mean length of 6.0 inches.  Age and growth information were not collected in this assessment.Other species sampled during the population assessment included brown bullhead, pumpkinseed sunfish, walleye (only one sampled), and white sucker.In order to maintain or improve fish and wildlife populations, water quality and habitat must be protected.  People often associate water quality problems with large-scale agricultural, forestry, urban development or industrial practices in the watershed.  In reality, the impact of land use decisions on one lake lot may be relatively small, yet, the cumulative impact of those decisions on many lake lots can result in a significant decline in water quality and habitat.  For example, removing shoreline and aquatic vegetation, fertilizing lawns, mowing to the water's edge, installing beach sand blankets, failing septic systems and uncontrolled run-off, all contribute excess nutrients and sediment which degrade water quality and habitat.  Understanding these cumulative impacts and taking steps to avoid or minimize them will help to insure our quality fisheries can be enjoyed by future generations.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Big Sucker Lake is a 230 acre lake located 4 miles west of Nashwauk, MN in the Mississippi River watershed.  Big Sucker Lake has somewhat stained water and a maximum depth of 36 feet.  There is a DNR-owned public access at the south end of the lake. <br> \n <br> \nThe lake management plan (LMP) was last updated in 2004.  Black Crappie and Northern Pike were considered primary management species, and Largemouth Bass was considered a secondary management species.  A standard lake survey was conducted in August 2019 to assess the status of the fish community.  <br> \n <br> \nNet catches of Black Crappie have varied considerably over the years.  Inconsistent recruitment is a common trait of crappie populations, leading to variable catch rates and boom and bust angling cycles.  The 2019 trap-net catch was average for the lake and lakes with similar habitat.  The gill-net catch rate was above the typical range and the highest on record.  Size structure was poor with most fish ranging from 4 to 8 inches.  Few crappie exceeded 10 inches.  Age analysis indicated a high proportion of younger-aged fish.  Ages 2 through 6 were represented, but age 3 and 4 fish made up 75% of the sample.  Growth was considered slow, with crappie averaging 7.7 inches at age 5.  <br> \n <br> \nGill-net catches for Northern Pike in previous surveys have been within the typical range for similar lakes.  The 2019 catch rate was below the typical range and the lowest recorded for the lake.  Northern Pike size structure was moderate.  Pike ranged from 17.2 to 29.9 inches with an average length of 23.4 inches.  Six year classes from age 2 to age 7 were sampled.  Growth was considered average; pike exceeded 22 inches after four years.  The north central pike zone regulation implemented in 2018 requires anglers to release pike from 22-26 inches, while allowing for more harvest of small pike.  It is hoped that this regulation will improve size quality on Big Sucker Lake. <br> \n <br> \nStandard summer netting typically does not provide a good assessment of a lake's Largemouth Bass population, so night electrofishing is the preferred method to evaluate this species.  Electrofishing has not been conducted on Big Sucker Lake, but anecdotal reports suggest Largemouth Bass are present in fishable numbers.  Low numbers of bass were sampled in gill nets and trap nets.  Catch rates were typical for lakes with similar habitat.  Sampled fish ranged from 6.3 to 17.3 inches.  Big Sucker Lake likely provides fair angling opportunities for bass. <br> \n <br> \nThe trap-net catch for Bluegill was average for the lake and within the typical range for similar lakes.  Size structure has generally been poor with few fish exceeding 8 inches sampled in any survey.  Bluegill from the 2019 trap-net sample ranged from 3.0 to 8.4 inches with an average length of 5.3 inches.  Age and growth information was not collected. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch have been sampled in numbers typical for the lake class in all surveys.  The 2019 gill-net catch was the lowest catch recorded for the lake.  Gill-net sampled perch averaged 5.9 inches.  Perch have generally been too small to be of interest to anglers, but are an important prey item for other gamefish. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye gill-net catches have generally been low, but within the typical range for this type of lake.  The 2019 catch rate was about average for the lake and lakes with similar habitat.  Sampled Walleye were relatively large, ranging from 20.6 to 25.8 inches.  Age analysis showed all Walleye were from the 2009 or 2011 year classes.  These year classes correspond to years of fingerling stocking.  Fish were purchased and stocked by private citizens under a DNR permit.  Growth was average; Walleye exceeded 17 inches after 5 years.  <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled in the latest survey included Brown Bullhead, Yellow Bullhead, Pumpkinseed Sunfish and White Sucker. <br> \n</p>",
