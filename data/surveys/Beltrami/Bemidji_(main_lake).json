                "narrative": "<p>Lake Bemidji is located adjacent to the city of Bemidji, Minnesota.  It is in fisheries lake class 22, a group of large, deep lakes with clear water.  Other Bemidji area lakes in this class include Cass, Pike Bay, Plantaganette, and Kabekona.  Because of its proximity to Bemidji, it is very popular for angling and other recreational activities including sailing, personal watercraft, swimming, and pleasure boating.  Primary fish management is for walleye.  Northern pike, muskellunge and yellow perch are listed as secondary species on the management plan.      Consecutive years of excellent natural walleye reproduction have produced a population higher than most lakes in class 22.  Because of the abundance of young fish in the population, the average size of walleyes is only 12.3 inches.  The largest walleye sampled in 1998 was 29.2 inches long and weighed 7.8 pounds.  Eleven percent of the walleye sampled were more than sixteen inches long.    Northern pike have never been extremely abundant, but Bemidji has been known for producing quality size pike.  Northern pike abundance and average size have declined since 1989 but may not indicate a long-term trend.  Some assessments prior to 1989 also recorded similar levels of abundance and size.  Half the pike measured in the assessment were between 20\" and 25\" and a few large pike are still available for some lucky fishermen.  The largest pike sampled was 29.5 inches long.  With increasing fishing pressure, voluntary release of larger pike will be important for maintaining or restoring the quality of the northern pike fishery.    A muskellunge fingerling stocking program has been in effect since 1982.  Angling for this species has gradually increased as larger fish have become available.  Recent reports of catches exceeding 50 inches have stimulated considerable interest.  Though muskellunge were not sampled during the summer assessment, a spring assessment that specifically targeted mature muskellungecaptured fish up to 57 inches in length.    Yellow perch are abundant with sizes large enough to be acceptable to anglers.  Perch fishing through the ice is popular on Lake Bemidji.  Only 9 percent of the perch measured exceeded nine inches long which may reflect the increasing harvest of the quality size fish.  Neascus (black spot) and yellow grubs are parasites of fish and especially common in perch.  They are not harmful to people who eat them but general recommendations are that all fish should be throughly cooked before being eaten.    Panfish and bass species are present in Lake Bemidji, but the populations are low and very little fishing pressure is expended on them.  Bullheads, whitefish, tullibee, burbot, redhorse and white sucker are other fish species present and provide fishing opportunities for those interested in pursuing them.  There seems to be some interest developing in the late winter burbot fishery.    Aquatic plant management activities are monitored to protect the remaining emergent vegetation especially bulrushes.  These stands of vegetation are valuable as fish spawning and nursery areas, wildlife cover, and as buffering zones to protect shoreline areas from erosion.  They are also beneficial in that they tie up nutrients in the water allowing for greater water clarity and quality.    There are a few resorts on the lake offering boat rentals and several good public accesses for those with their own boats.  Shore fishing opportunities are limited, but there is a public fishing pier near the Mississippi River inlet.  Its location near the inlet provides some excellent early season walleye action.  Lake Bemidji State Park, found on the north end of the lake, offers camping, swimming, interpretive activities, boat rental, and a boat landing.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Bemidji is a 6,596-acre lake with a maximum depth of 76 feet located adjacent to the city of Bemidji in southern Beltrami County. There are a total of six public boat landings located around the lake. Accessible fishing piers are located at the inlet of the lake near downtown Bemidji and at Lake Bemidji State Park. Lake Bemidji is part of a connected system of lakes which includes Lake Irving upstream and Stump Lake downstream on the Mississippi River. Both of these lakes are readily accessible by boat from Lake Bemidji and provide additional angling opportunities. The lake is managed primarily for Walleye, Yellow Perch, Northern Pike and Muskellunge.  <br> \n <br> \nThe 2022 catch rate for Walleye was just under 14 fish/gill net which is well above the average for most area lakes. Lengths averaged just over 13 inches and the largest captured during the 2022 survey was over 24 inches. Multiple strong year classes were observed indicating a robust population which continues to keep up despite being one of the most popular Walleye lakes in the area. Night electrofishing for juvenile Walleyes revealed an abundance of smaller fish that will reach catchable sizes in two to three years. <br> \n <br> \nLake Bemidji is well known for its quality Muskellunge population. Muskies were targeted specifically in the spring of 2022 via night electrofishing. A total of 46 adult muskies were measured with the largest just under 55 inches in length. Impressively, the overall average length was just under 48 inches. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike continue to maintain a quality population in Bemidji. Pike averaged almost 4 pounds and the largest captured in the 2022 assessment was over 38 inches long. The pike population is thriving with many fish larger than the 22-26 inch north-central zone protected slot which can provide great open water action or a memorable encounter from the surface of the ice. <br> \n <br> \nThe Yellow Perch catch rate was over 30 fish/gill net which is comparable to most area lakes. Yellow Perch averaged over 7 inches in length and fish over 10 inches were captured in the survey, though anglers have reported catching larger fish at times. Perch are one of the most important forage species for Walleye, muskies, and pike. <br> \n <br> \nOther species captured in this survey were Rock Bass, Tullibee (Cisco), White Sucker, Bullhead species, redhorse, and a variety of sunfish species. <br> \n <br> \nLake Bemidji is infested with zebra mussels and the aquatic plant, starry stonewort. Both are aquatic invasive species (AIS). AIS can be transferred by anglers and boats from infested to non-infested waterbodies. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants and animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access. Please follow the current AIS regulations to avoid spreading to other lakes. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Bemidji is a 6,420 acre lake with a maximum depth of 76 feet located adjacent to the city of Bemidji in southern Beltrami County.  There are a total of six public boat landings located primarily on the north and west shores of the lake.  Accessible fishing piers are located at the inlet of the lake near downtown Bemidji and at Lake Bemidji State Park.   Lake Bemidji is part of a connected system of lakes which includes Lake Irving upstream and Stump Lake downstream on the Mississippi River.  Both of these lakes are readily accessible from Lake Bemidji and provide additional varied angling opportunities. <br> \n <br> \nLake Bemidji is managed primarily as a walleye lake.  Consistent natural reproduction and decent growth rates make Lake Bemidji one of the most consistent walleye fisheries in the Bemidji area.  The 2012 population assessment documented a robust walleye population with twelve year classes present.  The gill net catch rate of 15.3 fish/gill net was well above the statewide normal range for class 22 lakes.  Sixty percent of the walleye captured in the 2012 population assessment were between 12 and 17 inches in length, which translates to plenty of \"keeper\" size walleye in the population.  Good recruitment of young walleye from the 2009 through 2011 year classes also bodes well for the fishery in the near term.  The largest walleye captured in the 2012 assessment measured 26.8 inches in length, although larger walleye are likely present in the population.  Lake Bemidji has abundant and diverse in-lake habitat, with no shortage of areas for walleye anglers to ply their favorite tactics in open-water or through the ice. <br> \n <br> \nLake Bemidji has earned a reputation as a trophy muskellunge fishery, with fish exceeding 50 inches in length caught by anglers annually.  Muskellunge are not sampled effectively in standard population assessments, so little biological information on the Lake Bemidji musky population has been collected recently.  Fishing pressure directed toward Lake Bemidji's musky population is considerable during certain times of the year. <br> \n <br> \nLake Bemidji is also known as a reliable yellow perch fishery.  In 2012, 12% of the yellow perch captured were greater than 9 inches in length with fish approaching 12 inches also present in the sample. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike are also a popular species in Lake Bemidji.  The 2012 catch rate of 2.07 fish/gill net is less than the statewide normal range for class 22 lakes; however, this low density is typical of the lake's pike population which has maintained a good size structure, unlike many Minnesota lakes that are characterized by an overabundance of small fish.  The average length and weight of northern pike in the 2012 assessment was 23.6 inches and 3.09 pounds. <br> \n <br> \nAlthough panfish species (sunfish, black crappie) are present in Lake Bemidji, their population levels have remained at \"background\" levels in the fish community, and typically do not attract much angling effort.  Anglers interested in panfish opportunities can venture to the connected waters of Stump Lake and Lake Irving, which have habitats that are better suited to these species. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Bemidji Lake is a 6420-acre lake with a maximum depth of 76 feet.  Over 396,000 acres of the Upper Mississippi watershed drain into Lake Bemidji. The lake is located in southern Beltrami County adjacent to the city of Bemidji.  There are six public accesses found around the lake.  The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different lake classes based on physical and chemical characteristics.  Lake Bemidji  is in lake class 22.   Lakes in this lake class are typically large in size, deep and  clear.  Other area lakes in the same lake class include Cass, Pike Bay, Plantangenette and Kabekona.  Lake Bemidji is managed  for walleye, northern pike, yellow perch and muskellunge.     Anglers have a variety of fish to angle for.  Best known for it's walleye, abundance in 2001 was the highest ever recorded.  This abundant population is being supported entirely by natural reproduction with no maintenance stocking necessary.  Eleven different age classes were represented in the sample.  Walleye sampled ranged in length from 6.1 - 29.2 inches with an average length of 13.8 inches.  A special study utilizing radio telemetry has been initiated to track spawning walleye and identify critical spawning habitat for future protection.     Northern pike abundance has never been high in Lake Bemidji, but the lake has a reputation for producing quality-sized fish.  There appears to be some decline in average size of pike in recent years.  With increasing fishing pressure, voluntary release of larger pike will be important for maintaining or restoring the quality of the northern pike.      Muskellunge are native to Lake Bemidji but occurrence has been very low.  A stocking program was initiated in 1982 to enhance this fishery.  There has been increasing popularity of in angling for this fish and reports of muskellunge over 50 inches are becoming more common each year.       Yellow perch have always been abundant but are starting to show the affect of increasing angling pressure.  Even though the average length of perch sampled is laregely unchanged.  There has been notable declines in larger perch over eight inches.      Other panfish sampled include bluegill, black crappie, rock bass and pumpkinseed sunfish, but their abundance is very low.     There has been much development around the entire lake and has likely impacted fish habitat and water quality.  Shoreline areas are critical areas for fish production and water quality.  Overdeveloped shorelines can't support the fish, wildlife, and clean water that are associated with natural undeveloped lakes. The combined effects of all lakeshore owners fixing up their property can greatly affect a lakes ability to produce fish and protect water quality.            </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Bemidji is a 6420-acre lake with a maximum depth of 76 feet in southern Beltrami County.  It is adjacent to the city of Bemidji.  There are numerous public access locations around the lake.  There are fishing piers near the Mississippi River inlet on the Southwest side and in Lake Bemidji State Park on the Northeast side of the lake.   <br> \n <br> \nThe Minnesota Department of Natural Resources has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different lake classes based on physical and chemical characteristics.  Lake Bemidji is in lake class 22.  Lakes in this lake class are typically large in size, deep and clear.  Other area lakes in the same lake class include Cass, Pike Bay, Plantaganette and Kabekona.  The Lake Bemidji fishery will be compared to lakes in the same lake class.  Lake Bemidji is managed for walleye, northern pike, yellow perch and muskellunge. <br> \n <br> \nLake Bemidji is well known for its excellent walleye fishery.  Abundance in 2006 was exceptional at nearly 18 walleye per gill net set, exceeding what you would typically find in a class 22 lake.  This abundant population is being supported entirely by natural reproduction with no maintenance stocking necessary.  Twelve different year classes were identified indicating consistently good reproduction.  Walleye sampled ranged from 7 to 27 inches with many in the 14-18 inch range.  With a naturally reproducing population, it is important to protect the spawning-sized walleye in the fishery.  This is where the anglers can make a difference.  By practicing selective harvest, anglers can harvest the smaller more abundant walleye for eating, and releasing more of the medium to large walleye.  These medium to large walleye make up the bulk of the spawning walleye that produces the young upcoming year classes that maintains the quality walleye fishery. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike abundance has never been high in Lake Bemidji, but the lake has the reputation for producing quality-sized pike.  Pike sampled in 2006 ranged in length from 16 to 36 inches with a mean length and weight of 25 inches and 3.75 pounds. This average weight is the highest since 1989. <br> \n <br> \nMuskellunge are native to Lake Bemidji but were thought to be nearly extirpated at one time. Regular fingerling stocking since 1982 has restored to a quality muskellunge fishery with reports of fish greater than 50 inches becoming quite common.  Recently the minimum size limit has been raised to 48 inches for muskellunge on Bemidji and connected waters. Voluntary catch and release is practiced almost exclusively by avid muskie anglers and is credited for much of the improvement in quality angling for this species.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch continue to be abundant in Lake Bemidji and are important both as a recreational fish for anglers and as forage for predator fish.  Perch over nine inches in length have increased over the past three assessments.  Nineteen percent of the perch sampled in 2006 were longer than nine inches.  <br> \n <br> \nOther fish sampled include bluegill, black crappie, pumpkinseed, rock bass and largemouth bass.  All were sampled at low abundance. <br> \n <br> \nThere has been considerable shoreline development around Lake Bemidji due to the close proximity to the City of Bemidji.  Efforts are in progress between MNDNR and City Planners to make wise development decisions for the few remaining properties yet to be developed. Native shoreline vegetation provides habitat for fish and wildlife, filters harmful nutrients, and protects against shoreline erosion.  Wise development considers these effects and includes measures to minimize impacts to shoreline habitat and water quality.  Private property owners can also practice important shoreline protection and in some cases restoration. For more information on how to accomplish this, contact your nearest Area Fisheries office or go to the following website: <br> \n <br> \nwww.dnr.state.mn.us/shorelandmgmt. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Bemidji is a Class 22 lake and is compared with other Bemidji area lakes including Plantaganette, Cass and PikeBay.  There are about 70 lakes statewide used for comparison of this lake class.  During the 1994 survey 25 different species of fish and minnows were sampled though others are known to be present.  Walleye were captured at rates exceeding 75% of the lakes by class and had an average weight of 1.5 pounds which isabout average for this class.  About 58% of the walleye sampled were greater than 15 inches in length and the largestwalleye captured was 27 inches.  Shoreline seining at 7 sites showed an above normal catch of fingerling walleye whichmay provide better walleye fishing starting about 1997.  Most 15 inch walleye are 4-5 years old.  Walleye fry were laststocked in 1989.  Northern pike captures were down from the 1989 survey to slightly below 3.0 per net and less than 75% of the lakes inClass 22.  Pike in Lake Bemidji averaged 3.4 pounds which is somewhat larger than 75% of the compared lakes.  Eighty-three percent of the pike were greater than 21 inches in length with the largest pike sampled at 35 inches.  Growth isprobably stimulated by the large population of tullibee in the lake.  Most pike were 3-4 years old.  Yellow perch were sampled at rates greater than 75% of the lakes of Class 22 but is less than half that sampled duringthe 1989 assessment.  Perch are of average size but five per pound.  About 10% of the perch are greater than 10 inchesin length.  Yellow grub and Neascus were found in about 5% of the perch though some areas of the lake have higherinfestations than others.  Only one muskellunge was sampled though anglers are reporting a good number of sightings (follows) or releases.  Thelargest muskie harvested during the 1994 season was 52 inches in length.  The lake is stocked with Leech Lake strain ofmuskies in alternate years.  Largemouth bass are captured as fingerlings by shoreline seining and some yearlings in trapnets but few mature fish aresampled.  Bass may be moving to select sites of the lake or moving to adjacent Stump and Irving Lakes as they mature.  Panfish, which include black crappie, bluegill, pumpkinseed, and sunfish hybrids, are found in very low numbers and injust a few areas of the lake.  Yellow bullheads were sampled this year though previous assessments have sampled yellow, black and brown bullheads andsometimes in significant numbers.  Bullhead catches are generally in the southeast part of the lake.  Burbot aredifficult to sample and only one fish was captured though anglers often seek these fish during late winter and have fairsuccess.  Only one whitefish was sampled though tullibee are abundant.  These species of fish play a significant roll in thegrowth and quality of the pike, muskellunge and walleye fishery of the lake.  Some tullibee are caught by winter anglersand a few whitefish are speared each winter but these numbers are very low.  There is no whitefish/tullibee nettingauthorized on Lake Bemidji. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Bemidji is a 6,596-acre lake with a maximum depth of 76 feet located adjacent to the city of Bemidji in southern Beltrami County.  There are a total of six public boat landings located primarily on the north and west shores of the lake.  Accessible fishing piers are located at the inlet of the lake near downtown Bemidji and at Lake Bemidji State Park.   Lake Bemidji is part of a connected system of lakes which includes Lake Irving upstream and Stump Lake downstream on the Mississippi River.  Both of these lakes are readily accessible by boat from Lake Bemidji and provide additional angling opportunities.  The lake is managed primarily for Walleye, Yellow Perch, Northern Pike and Muskellunge.  <br> \n  <br> \nConsistent natural reproduction, fast growth and good angler catch rates make Lake Bemidji one of the most popular Walleye fisheries in the area.  The 2017 survey documented a healthy population with 13 year classes present.  The catch rate of 19.86 fish/gill net was well above the normal range found in similar lakes (4.01 to 9.63 fish/gill net) and among the highest Walleye catch rates recorded in the assessment history.  Walleye captured had an average size of 14.99 inches in length and 1.10 lbs/fish.  A large proportion of the catch (59%) were between 13.0 inches and 17.0 inches in length, which translates to good numbers of \"eater\" size Walleye in the population.  The largest Walleye captured in 2017 was 28.07 inches in length.  Lake Bemidji contains excellent Walleye habitat with no shortage of areas for Walleye anglers to ply their favorite tactics in open water or through the ice.   <br> \n <br> \nLake Bemidji is also a dependable Yellow Perch lake.  The catch rate of 50 fish/gill net was above the normal range found in similar lakes.  Perch averaged just under 7 inches in length, and 22% of the catch were over 8 inches in length.  The largest Yellow Perch captured measured 10.94 inches.  <br> \n  <br> \nIn contrast to many lakes in Northern Minnesota, which have high numbers of small Northern Pike, Bemidji has maintained an exceptional pike population through the years with low to moderate numbers and a good average size.  The 2017 catch rate of 3.5 fish/gill net was on the low side of the normal range found in similar lakes (3.0 to 7.89 fish/gill net).  The average size was an impressive 25.55 inches in length and 3.78 lbs/fish and the largest pike captured in 2017 measured 34.84 inches in length.   <br> \n <br> \nLake Bemidji has been stocked with Muskellunge fingerlings since 1982 and has become a destination musky fishery in the upper Midwest in recent years.  Muskellunge are not sampled effectively in standard surveys.  The most recent musky special assessment was completed in 2014 and documented a robust population with mature female fish averaging 49 inches in length with fish up to 55 inches in length captured in the assessment.   <br> \n <br> \nOther species of fish captured in the 2017 survey were Redhorse species, Rock Bass, Tullibee (Cisco), White Sucker, Largemouth Bass, Black Crappie and Bowfin.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Bemidji is a 6,596-acre lake, located adjacent to the city of Bemidji in southern Beltrami County. A targeted survey was completed on Lake Bemidji by Bemidji Area Fisheries staff during July of 2022 to assess the nearshore fish community and overall health of the lake. <br> \n <br> \nIn this survey, 24 nearshore sites (100-foot) were evenly spaced along the lakeshore to sample a variety of aquatic habitat types and collect a representative sample of the nearshore fish community. Depending on the habitat conditions at each site, backpack electrofishing, and shoreline seining were attempted where possible. Seining and backpack electrofishing were completed at all 24 sites. A total of 26 species were sampled, which included 10 species (Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Burbot, Iowa Darter, Logperch, Longnose Dace, Mimic Shiner, Muskellunge, and Rock Bass) that are intolerant to disturbance or poor water quality. <br> \n <br> \nNearshore fish community data was analyzed with information collected from the standard survey in 2022 to calculate a Fish-based Index of Biotic Integrity (FIBI) score to measure the biological condition and overall health of Lake Bemidji. In Minnesota, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and healthy habitat (e.g. Blacknose Shiner, Mimic Shiner, Tullibee (cisco), and Mottled Sculpin), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g. Black Bullhead, Fathead Minnow, and Green Sunfish). The combination of fish species present may identify stressors negatively affecting the lake environment. The FIBI score is composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics to indicate the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. For additional information on FIBI search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources website (www.mndnr.gov). <br> \n <br> \nResults of this survey indicate Lake Bemidji is in great health with a FIBI score above the exceptional threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes. In coordination with the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency, data from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Mississippi River (Headwaters) Watershed assessment. <br> \n</p>",
