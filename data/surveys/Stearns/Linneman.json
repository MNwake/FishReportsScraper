                "narrative": "<p>Linneman is a 109-acre lake located just southeast of the City of Avon in Stearns County.  It is relatively shallow with a maximum depth of 15 feet.  The west half of the lake is less than three feet deep and covered in emergent and floating leaf vegetation. No public access exists.  Access for this assessment was obtained from private property on the south side of the lake.  <br> \n <br> \nThe purpose of the assessment was to update DNR records regarding the species composition  and obtain a depth map of the lake.  Very few fish were sampled at the time of the assessment. Two of the five trap nets sampled no fish at all due to muskrat holes.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike were sampled at a rate of 1.7/ trap net. Northern pike ranged in length from 15.5- 31.1 inches. Based on the abundance of emergent vegetation and wetland areas in Linneman Lake, northern pike reproduction is expected to be good. <br> \n <br> \nBluegills were sampled at a rate of 2.0/ trap net. Bluegills ranged in size from 2.5 to 8.3 inches in length. Much of the bottom substrate in Linneman is soft mud but some areas of firmer sandy substrate was observed.  Based on the presence of small bluegill it appears that bluegill are reproducing naturally and frequently enough to sustain a catchable population. <br> \n <br> \nThe catch rate of black crappie was 1.0/ trap net.  Black crappie ranged in length from 7.9 to 10.8 inches in length.  <br> \n <br> \nOther species observed in low abundance were pumpkinseed sunfish, and bowfin. <br> \n <br> \nAlthough no largemouth or smallmouth bass were sampled in this assessment, a conversation with a local property owner revealed that he has caught smallmouth bass in Linneman Lake. Smallmouth bass are known to be present in the Spunk Lakes and there is an intermittent stream that connects Linneman, Minnie and the Spunk Lakes during periods of high water.   <br> \n <br> \nLinneman Lake has experienced partial winterkills in the past.  Low dissolved oxygen levels were observed throughout the 1960's and 1970's as well as in 1986.  From 1967-1972, 770 northern pike were removed from Linneman Lake and stocked in the Spunk Lakes as part of  winter northern pike rescue.  Historical stocking records indicate that northern pike, bluegill, black crappie, and largemouth bass were stocked into Linneman lake over a period of time from 1909 to 1933.  No stocking would be considered now due to the lack of public access.   <br> \n <br> \nLinneman Lake may provide good opportunities for angling to local residents that have access to the lake especially if winterkill does not occur for period of several years. <br> \n</p>",
