No stocking occurred in 2020 due to state shutdown of spring egg taking and hatchery operations due to the Covid-19 pandemic.  Results from the 2020 electrofishing suggest limited Walleye recruitment in the past two years.  Only three Walleye were captured during sampling, none of which was young of year (YOY).  Fingerling Walleye were stocked in the fall of 2019 due to the high availability of fish statewide.  Only a single yearling Walleye was observed in 2020 fall electrofishing.  Walleye natural reproduction checks conducted in 1997 and 1999 also failed to capture YWAE.  The catch rate in the 1995 fall reproduction check was 13.0/hour.  Historically, electrofishing catch rates have not corresponded well with gill net catches, suggesting they may be an imprecise indicator of future recruitment to the fishery.  In addition, gillnet catches have regularly documented year classes from non-stocked years indicating that some natural reproduction may still occur. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

Walleye, black crappies and bluegill are probablythe most sought after species, receiving moderate to heavy fishing pressure attimes of the year.  Walleye up to 30 inches were sampled during investigations,although the majority were 13 to 14 inches.  Success has been good for walleye inrecent years.  Little Birch has been stocked with walleye fingerlings and naturalreproduction has also been documented.  Northern pike abundance has increased withthe average size about 22 inches.  Largemouth and smallmouth bass both provideangling opportunities for large fish (over 17 inches), with the smallmouth bassbeing more abundant.  Black crappies averaged 11 inches and bluegills six inchesin the summer investigation.  Yellow perch, an important prey species for gamefish,were found in low abundance.  Tullibee were abundant and measured up to 17 inches,although many were under 9 inches, a size utilized by northern pike and largewalleye.  Carp are still abundant, however the population appears to havestabilized.  Other roughfish present include white suckers, yellow, brown and blackbullheads, and bowfin.     Little Birch has many diverse habitats that support the variety of fishpresent.  Proper watershed and residential land use practices need to be stressedto improve water quality and protect fish habitats.  Selective harvest isencouraged for both angling and spearing to sustain a balanced fish community.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Little Birch Lake is an 840-acre waterbody located three miles southwest of Grey Eagle. The lake is impaired by the presence of zebra mussels and Eurasian Watermilfoil, however it retains its reputation as one of the nicer lakes in the area and is a popular fishing and recreational-boating lake with good water quality and clarity. Aquatic plants are abundant and highly diverse including extensive areas of submerged, emergent, and floating-leaf plants. Much of the lake however is characterized by a steep drop-off from which densely vegetated areas disappear quickly to deep water. The shoreline is mostly wooded and residential development is well established. Shallow-water bottom substrates range from sand and gravel to muck. The lake is managed primarily for Walleye and secondarily for Northern Pike, Smallmouth Bass and Largemouth Bass.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance appears to have declined since the last survey in 2015. Fry are stocked annually but survival and recruitment of young Walleyes to catchable size is unsatisfactory. The combination of increasing water clarity, sustained abundance of hungry, 18-23 inch Northern Pike, and inadequate prey-abundance (perch) are likely reasons for the apparent downfall of the Walleye population. Strategies to remedy this situation are currently being discussed.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike are present in moderate to high numbers. Fishing success should be high however the likelihood of catching a trophy is low. Most pike sampled in survey nets are less than 24 inches in length. Pike however are excellent eating and anglers are encouraged to harvest as many pike (less than 22 inches) as is currently allowed under law, which is ten.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch as mentioned, are very low in abundance. Because they are the preferred prey fish for pike and Walleye, they can dwindle badly if predator abundance in a lake gets too out of balance. This appears to be the case in Little Birch Lake. Unfortunately, stocking perch as a way to feed predatory fish and maintain community balance is expensive and research has shown it to be ineffective.  <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth and Smallmouth Bass are species which currently provide quality fishing. Both populations contain healthy numbers and size structure is good. Surveys regularly sample individual fish of both species in the 18-19 inch range.  <br> \n <br> \nPanfish including Bluegill and Black Crappie can provide decent fishing. Bluegill are more abundant than crappie, the former offering better size as well, with good numbers of fish 8 inches or larger found during surveys. Very few crappies have been sampled over the years however, effective sampling can be a challenge as they are difficult to target due to the lake's narrow shallow-water zone and seasonal weather variations.  <br> \n <br> \nDue to the presence of aquatic invasive species including zebra mussels and Eurasian Watermilfoil, anglers are reminded to drain all water from boats, livewells and trailers and be sure all aquatic plants are removed before leaving the access. <br> \n</p>",

A Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MNDNR) owned concrete boat ramp is located on the northwest shore. Little Birch Lake has 8.61 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 89 feet. The lake is primarily managed for Walleye and secondarily for Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, and Smallmouth Bass. The lake was initially surveyed in 1981 and 35 fish sampling surveys or investigations have occurred since then with the most recent prior sampling in 2019 (Fall YWAE Assessment). Fall night electrofishing has been completed on an annual or biennial basis since 1995 in Little Birch Lake. <br> \n <br> \nAn hour of fall night electrofishing was conducted on Little Birch to evaluate young of year Walleye (YWAE) abundance from spring fry stocking. Four YWAE were captured during sampling for a catch rate (CPE) of 4.0/hour. This CPE was near the low end of the interquartile range (4.2-32.5 fish/hour).  YWAE captured ranged from 6.89 to 7.24 inches and averaged 7.03 inches in total length.  Four yearling Walleye averaging 10.9 inches were also captured during sampling for a CPE of 4.0/hour.  Historically, electrofishing catch rates have not corresponded well with gill net catches, suggesting they may be an imprecise indicator of future recruitment to the fishery.  In addition, gillnet catches have regularly documented year classes from non-stocked years <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>   Little Birch Lake is a deep (89 feet) lake located between Big Birch Lake and Sylvia Lake on the Todd/Stearns County line.  The lake has an abundance of deep water structure and habitat as only 33% of the lake is 15 feet deep or less.   Agriculture is more apparent around the main basin of the lake which has most of the shallow water habitats.  Mixed forest hillsides and fast drop-offs are characteristic of the long arm of the lake.  The majority of the development on the lake is also located along both sides of the arm.  Water clarity was average for lakes in this area of the state with a secchi disk reading of 6.7 feet in mid-July.  Aquatic vegetation was found to grow to a depth of 16 feet with chara or muskgrass being the most common submergent species.  Hardstem bulrush was the most common emergent vegetation species with most beds being found in the shallower main basin.  Sand and gravel were the most common shoal or shallow water substrates.   Both curly leaf pondweed and eurasian milfoil were documented while doing transects but the abundance rating was rare for both.  Anglers and lakeshore owners should be especially diligent about cleaning their boats and trailers when leaving the lake to prevent the spread of the exotics to other lakes in the area.\n   Fishing is a popular pastime on the lake and Little Birch supports a diverse fish community which can provide plenty of angling opportunities.  Little Birch is a popular walleye lake year round and a wide range of sizes were observed in the summer survey although most were between 12 to 14 inches.  Numbers were down from the last survey and below management goals but remained within the normal range when compared to similar type lakes.  Although natural reproduction does contribute some fish to the population, it does not appear enough to meet the desired population goals.  Walleye stocking occurs with either fry or fingerlings being stocked every year.  We are currently evaluating whether fry or fingerling stocking works better.\n    More northern pike were caught in the 2007 survey than in the last survey which is an undesirable development.  Most of the pike caught in the survey were between 19 and 23 inches with some up to 34 inches seen.  Anglers are encouraged to harvest the smaller northern pike under 24 inches and release the larger ones to help maintain a balanced fish community and promote good growth rates.  Lower northern pike numbers may also increase small walleye survival and allow the low yellow perch and tullibee populations to increase.  Higher perch and tullibee populations are desirable as they can be  important prey species for both walleye and northern pike.\n    Little Birch Lake supports both smallmouth and largemouth bass populations with the smallmouth bass being much more common.  Smallmouth abundance was almost 4 times more than what is normally seen in these types of lakes.  Despite the abundant population, fish in the 15 - 16 inch range were common and trophy-size smallmouth bass up to 20 inches were documented in the survey.  Largemouth bass numbers appear to normal for this type of lake.  Average size seen in the summer survey was about  ten inches, however, bass up to 18 inches were observed in a spring assessment done on the lake.  An abundance of bulrush and waterlily along the shoreline provides excellent habitat for both species.\n    Black crappies and bluegills are both much sought after species in the lake.  Neither of the species appears to be over abundant and some nice size fish of both species can be found.  Anglers have reported good winter fishing in the past.  The 2007 summer survey used only gillnets to assess the fish community in Little Birch Lake which would not sample the shallow water areas where bluegill typically hang out.  A spring assessment was also conducted in 2007 to evaluate the crappies and bluegills.  The assessment was not very effective at catching crappies but did provide a good sample of bluegills.  Little Birch Lake appears to have  a bluegill population that would attract most anglers.  Bluegills over 6.5 inches were common in the spring assessment with fish up to nine inches measured.  A variety of sizes was found in the black crappie catches between the spring and summer surveys with fish up to 12 inches being observed.\n    One fish that may surprise most anglers on the lake could be the presence of channel catfish.  The fish was first documented in the 1999 survey and likely came up the Sauk River system and entered the Little Birch Lake from Sylvia Lake.  While fewer catfish were caught in the 2007 survey than in 2003, the fish were in excellent condition and could put up a fight.  All of the catfish seen in the summer surveys have been between 19 and 27 inches in length.  Anglers have also reported catching catfish.  Some other species of fish from the same family found in the lake are bullheads. While yellow bullheads were the only species to be caught in the summer survey some black and brown bullheads were sampled in the spring assessment.  The average size of the yellow bullheads was about 12 inches.  The presence of yellow bullheads can be an indicator of good water quality as they are more abundant in lakes with clear water as opposed to black bullheads which are more abundant in lakes with turbid water.\n     Carp abundance appears to have decreased since the last survey and numbers do not appear to be at levels detrimental to the lake.  Carp have a reputation for rooting up aquatic vegetation and increasing water turbidity.  Tullibee or cisco abundance was also down which could mean fewer desirable-sized prey for larger northern pike and walleye which tend to suspend in cooler water which tullibee usually inhabit.  Tullibee are a cold water species that sometime has difficulty locating adequate habitat in summer months when the cooler, deeper water becomes depleted of oxygen and the upper layers of water become too warm.\n     Other species sampled in the summer survey that make up part of the fish community include pumpkinseeds, rock bass, shorthead redhorse, and white sucker.  Some additional species caught in the spring assessment were bowfin or dogfish, great redhorse, green sunfish, and hybrid sunfish.\n    </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>   A panfish assessment was conducted in mid-June to evaluate the bluegill and black crappie populations in Little Birch Lake.  The timing of the assessment appears to be too late for crappies as only 5 were caught.  Additional trapnets at a different time may be needed to properly assess the crappie population.  An ice-out assessment in 1999 was much more effective, catching 121 crappies while a similar assessment in 1995 sampled 35 crappies.  The crappies in the 2007 panfish assessment measured from 6 to 11 inches in length with a mean length of 7.8 inches and 20% (n=1) of the fish exceeding 9 inches.  In the 1999 ice-out assessment, the crappies were between 2 and 11.5 inches with a mean length of 6.3 inches.  Only 6% (n=7) of the fish were over 9 inches in length.  The 1995 ice-out sampled fish from 3 to 11.6 inches in length with a mean length of 6.6 inches and 11% (n=3) of the measured fish exceeding 9 inches.  All of the spring assessments fell short of the management goal of at least 25% of the crappies in the spring trapnets exceeding 9 inches in length.  The summer survey in 2007 captured 11 black crappies in the gillnets for a catch rate of 0.9/set which was within the normal range for lake class 22 (interquartile range = 0.2 - 1.1).  Crappies in the gillnet catch ranged from 5 to 12 inches in length with a mean length of 8.8 inches and 54% (n=6) of the fish more than 9 inches.  Ages 2 thru 4 were represented in the 2007 spring assessment and ages 3, 5, and 6 in the summer survey.  Ages 2 and 6 displayed fast growth while the other age groups showed normal growth.   <br> \n    The 2007 June trapnet effort displayed a better sample size structure for bluegill than that seen in the earlier ice-out assessments.  The 2007 assessment caught 509 bluegills between 3 and 9 inches in length with a mean length of 6.5 inches.  The same length distribution was displayed in the 1999 ice-out which sampled 462 bluegills but the mean length was shorter at 6 inches.  In the 2007 assessment, 39% (n=198) of the bluegills exceeded 7 inches with 10% (n=51) of the fish more than 8 inches in length.  Fish exceeding 7 inches comprised 18% (n=81) of the 1999 ice-out sample with 2% (n=9) over 8 inches in length.   A ice-out assessment in 1995 provided a catch of 1,932 bluegills from 3 to 8 inches in length.  Measurement of a subsample of the catch (14%; n=262) produced a mean length of 5.5 inches with only 9% (n=23) of the  fish more than 7 inches in length and 0.4 (n=1) over 8 inches.  Some nice bluegills were also observed in the 2007 summer gillnet catch.  The gillnets caught 34 bluegills between 4 and 8.5 inches in length with a mean length of 6.0 inches.  Fish over 7 inches comprised 23% (n=8) of the catch with 6% (n=2) more than 8 inches in length.  Ages 3 thru 8 were represented in the 2007 spring assessment with ages 3, 4, and 8 exhibiting normal growth while the other age groups displayed fast growth.  Two strong year classes from 2002 and 2003 accounted for 28% and 21% of the catch, respectively. <br> \n     More largemouth bass were caught in the 2007 panfish assessment than in the summer lake survey.  The spring assessment netted 9 largemouth bass ranging from 6 to 18 inches in length with the majority of the bass (78%; n=7) being between 6 and 7.5 inches in length.  The six bass caught in the summer survey were from 8 to 14 inches in length.  The summer gillnets, however, were more effective at sampling smallmouth bass than the spring trapnets.  Forty (40) bass were sampled in the summer nets and only 15 in the spring nets.  Bass in the summer catch ranged from 8 to 20 inches while those in the spring catch were from 6 to 16 inches in length.  Spring night electrofishing has also proven to be a very efficienct method for evaluating the bass populations in Little Birch Lake. <br> \n     Also sampled during the 2007 panfish assessment were 5 walleye between 12 and 24 inches and 4 northern pike from 20 to 27 inches in length.  Other species that were identified and counted were black bullheads, bowfin, common carp, greater redhorse, green sunfish, hybrid sunfish, pumpkinseeds, rock bass, shorthead redhorse, white sucker, and yellow perch. <br> \n     An area mean back-calculated length table was used to compare growth rates.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>     A spring panfish assessment was conducted on Little Birch Lake to evaluate the black crappie and bluegill populations.  Summer trap nets typically do not sample many of the larger individuals in a population.   Eight standard lake survey trap nets were set and lifted twice for a total of sixteen lifts.  Two of the nets were moved to different locations.  Scales were taken from both black crappie and bluegill for age and growth data.   All fish species were measured.   <br> \n     Black crappie have proven to be a difficult species to sample in Little Birch Lake.  Results from the various special assessments and summer surveys have varied greatly and suggest that no one method has proven to be reliable for sampling the species.  The spring ice-out assessments so far have provided the largest samples of crappie.  Summer gill nets have captured the largest individuals and greatest percent over nine inches in length.  Summer trap nets have also shown they can provide good catches of crappie over nine inches.  The 1999 summer survey was the only time that a substantial number of crappie were sampled by summer trap nets.   A total of 49 crappie were caught that measured from 6.5 to 11 inches with 63% (n=31) more than nine inches in length.  <br> \n     The 2011 spring panfish assessment caught six black crappie ranging from 4.4 to 10 inches in length.  Two (33%) of the fish exceeded nine inches.  A similar assessment was conducted in June of 2007 that sampled five crappie.  The fish measured from 6.2 to 10.8 inches in length with only one (20%) more than nine inches.  Ice-out assessments in 1999 and 1995 netted 121 and 35 black crappie, respectively.   The lengths ranged between 2 and 11.6 inches in both assessments.  Crappie exceeding nine inches comprised only 6% (n=7) of the 1999 catch and 11% (n=3) of the 1995 catch.  The 2011 summer gill nets sampled eight crappie that were all over nine inches (10.5 - 13.2 inches).   In 2007, eleven crappie were caught by gill nets.  The fish ranged from 4.7 - 11.8 inches in length with 54% (n=6) more than nine inches in length.  The 2003 summer gill nets caught 27 crappie with 18% (n=5) over nine inches with the largest being 12.2 inches in length.    <br> \n     Ages 2, 5, and 6 were represented in the 2011 black crappie catch.  All of the age groups showed normal growth when compared to an area mean back-calculated length table. <br> \n      Panfish and ice-out assessment have produced higher bluegill catches in Little Birch Lake when compared to summer trap nets.  The spring trap nets also produced the greatest number and proportion of fish over seven inches.   Summer gill nets have also caught some of the largest bluegill and had significant portions that exceeded seven inches.  The 2011 panfish assessment netted 271 bluegill between 3.4 and 8.9 inches in length with 23% (n=63) of the fish more than 7 inches.  In 2007, 509 bluegill ranging from 3.5 to 9 inches in length were caught in the panfish assessment.  Fish exceeding seven inches comprised 39% (n=197) of the sample.  Ice-out assessments in 1999 and 1995 produced catches of 462 and 1,932 bluegill, respectively.   Fish ranged from 3.2 to 8.9 inches in the two assessments with 18% of the 1999 assessment catch and 9% of the measured fish in 1995 exceeding seven inches.  Only 14% (n=262) of the 1995 bluegill catch was measured.   <br> \n     Ages 2 through 7 were represented in the 2011 bluegill catch.  All of the age groups displayed fast growth when compared to an area mean back-calculated length table.  Two year classes, 2005 and 2006, accounted for 42% and 35% of the sample, respectively. <br> \n     The 2011 summer gill nets caught 75 bluegill between 4.7 and 8.5 inches in length.  Bluegill exceeding seven inches accounted for 32% (n=24) of the sample.  Thirty-four  bluegill were caught in the 2007 summer gill nets, 112 in 2003 gill nets, and 2 in 1999 gill nets.  Bluegill up to nine inches were measured in 2003 but only 3% (n=3) of the fish were more than 7 inches in length.  Twenty-four percent of the fish (n=8) were more than seven inches in 2007 while the longest bluegill in 1999 was 6.2 inches.  Summer trap nets were used in 1999 and 1995 during the lake surveys and sampled 280 and 190 bluegill, respectively.  Although bluegill up to 8.3 inches were caught (1999), both samples were dominated by smaller fish as fish over seven inches accounted for only 6% (n=16) and 7% (n=11) of the catches, respectively.    <br> \n      The 2011 panfish assessment was the first to document bigmouth buffalo in Little Birch Lake.  Other roughfish species sampled included common carp, bowfin or dogfish, brown bullhead, white sucker, and yellow bullhead. <br> \n      Weather, time of year, and target species all have impacts on species composition of the survey catches.  It has been difficult to successfully time black crappie spawning or movement to provide adequate spring samples.  The weather in June of 2011 was unseasonably cloudy and cool and panfish did not appear to be in spawning.  Ice-out assessment net sets tend to target gamefish and not as much data is collected on panfish species.  Presence and strengths of year classes also influence the size structures of the populations. </p>",

From 2006 to 2011, fry were stocked in Little Birch Lake in even-numbered years and fingerlings in odd-numbered years.   Annual fry stocking was initiated in 2012 after a Study IV involving Oxytetracycline marked fry showed that fry and fingerling stockings appeared to contribute about equally to the population.  A change to fry only resulted from fry stocking as a more cost effective method than fingerlings.  Three electrofishing runs were done around the lake for a total of just over one hour of effort.  A total of 79 young-of-year walleye were netted along with 20 older walleye for a catch rate of 76 young of year walleye per hour. <br> \n     Catch rates for walleye young-of-year have varied in the fall electrofishing efforts.  While more fingerlings were caught in the 2012 electrofishing effort, the highest catch rate was 78/hour in 2008 when 68 young-of-year were captured.  Catch rates in 2006 and 2005 were similar at 18/hour and 20/hour, respectively.  The 2010 catch rate was 5/hour and 2001 catch rate 7.5/hour, while no young-of-year were sampled in 2000 and 1997.  The 1995 fall electrofishing catch rate was 13/hour.  A new electrofishing boat purchased in 2007 has increased species diversity in the electrofishing runs and the presence of two netters along with the new boat has also contributed to higher catch rates overall.   <br> \n     The non- young of year walleye netted in the 2012 electrofishing runs measured from 8.7 to 14.8 inches in length.  Scales were taken from some of the fish (11) to determine age groups.  Most of the aged fish were from the 2011 year class which was a fingerling stocked year.  There were also fish from the 2010 and 2009 year classes which corresponded to fry stocked and fingerling stocked years, respectively.   The 2009 year class accounted for a significant portion (57%) of the 2011 gill net catch.   <br> \n     Other fish species observed during the electrofishing runs included smallmouth bass, brook silverside, yellow perch, bluegills, white sucker, shiners, bowfin, rock bass, northern pike, largemouth bass, common carp, and black crappie.</p>",

Annual fry stocking was initiated in 2012 after a previous regime of even-year fry stocking and odd-year fingerling stocking.  A Study IV project involving Oxytetracline marking compared the contribution of fry and fingerling stocking to the fishery from 2005 to 2009.  Both fry and fingerlings were marked with Oxytetracline during that time period.  Results from the study showed that both methods of stocking appeared to contribute about equally to the population.  Those study results were used to justify changing to annual fry stocking which is a more cost effective method of providing a Walleye fishery. <br> \n     Forty-six fingerlings were netted in the 2013 fall electrofishing effort for a catch rate of 36.7/hour indicating a \"moderate\" year class.  Catch rates for young of the year Walleye have varied in the fall electrofishing efforts.  Between 2005 and 2012, from five to seventy-eight young of the Walleye have been sampled producing catch rates of 5 to 78/hour in five fall electrofishing efforts.   <br> \n     When looking at the summer Walleye gill net catch in 2011, 64% of the fish caught corresponded to fingerling stocked year classes.  A fry stocked year from 2008 accounted from 26% of the sample.  In the fall of 2008, night electrofishing was conducted to assess the spring fry stocking which produced a catch rate of 78/hour. The dominant year class in the 2007 summer gill nets was from 2005 (67%), which was both a fry and fingerling stocked year.  Fall electrofishing was again conducted producing a catch rate of 20 Walleye per hour.   <br> \n       Scales were collected from the sixteen \"other\" or adult Walleye caught to verify year classes.  The fish ranged from 9.6 to 17.8 inches in length and ages 1 through 3 were represented.   <br> \n      In some electrofishing efforts yearling Walleye have comprised a significant portion of the \"other\" Walleye catches.   In the 2013 electrofishing assessment, 69% (n=11) of the \"other\" fish were yearlings.  Yearlings were also a major component of the \"other\" Walleye catch in 2012 (16 of 24), 2010 (51 of 59), 2008 (15 of 18), and 2006 (27 of 27).  In four of the electrofishing efforts, the yearling year classes corresponded with fingerling stocking years. <br> \n       Catch rates of young of year Walleye in fall electrofishing have corresponded to year class strengths observed in subsequent gill net surveys.  However, some observations have been complicated by contingency fingerling stocking.   An attached table shows the year Walleye fry were stocked, the fall electrofishing catch rate, and the number of fish from that year class in summer gill net catches. <br> \n      Other fish species observed during the 2013 fall electrofishing effort were Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, Smallmouth Bass, Bluegill, White Sucker, Rock Bass, Bowfin, Common Carp, and Shorthead Redhorse.   No Channel Catfish were observed.  Three runs were conducted for a total of 1.25 hours of on-time.   Water clarity was moderate.    <br> \n     Annual fry stocking has produced a Walleye population at desired levels and that method of stocking will continue to be used.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>     A spring panfish trap net assessment was conducted in early June of 2015 on Little Birch Lake to evaluate the Bluegill and Black Crappie populations.  Three spring panfish assessments have been completed on Little Birch as summer trap nets typically do not sample many of the larger individuals in a population.    <br> \n      Panfish and ice-out assessment have produced higher Bluegill catches in Little Birch Lake when compared to summer trap nets.   The 2015 spring panfish assessment was effective at sampling Bluegill, catching 829 fish between 3 and 8.9 inches in length.   Smaller Bluegill dominated the catch though as only 7% (n=58) of the fish were more than seven inches in length with 0.8% (n=7) exceeding eight inches.  Mean length for the sample was 5.6 inches.   Bluegill show stable recruitment with all age groups 3-11 represented in the catch.  Age classes III and IV were strong and accounted for 79% of the sample.   <br> \n      Black Crappie have been difficult to capture in spring panfish assessments.   Two of the spring assessments (2015 and 2007) netted five crappie while six were caught in 2011.  The 2015 ice-out assessment was more effective, sampling twenty-eight Black Crappie.  The most effective method in 2015 proved to the daytime spring electrofishing effort for Largemouth Bass.  A total of thirty-four crappie were netted. <br> \n      The largest crappie caught in the 2015 spring panfish trap nets measured 10.7 inches.  The 2015 ice-out assessment caught crappie up to 12.4 inches in length with 36% (n=10) of the fish exceeding ten inches and 7% (n=2) more than eleven inches.  Most of the crappie (56%) in the 2015 ice-out, however, were from five to six inches in length.   <br> \n      The 2015 spring electrofishing assessment demonstrated the Little Birch Lake was capable of producing memorable Black Crappie with fish up to 14.1 inches netted.  Mean length of the fish caught was 10.5 inches with 97% (n=33) of the sample exceeding nine inches.   Crappie over ten inches accounted for 70% (n=21) of the sample with 24% (n=8) more than eleven inches and 9% (n=3) over twelve inches in length.  <br> \n      Game fish species caught in the 2015 spring panfish trap net assessment included seven Largemouth Bass between six and seventeen inches along with four Northern Pike ranging from twenty to twenty-four inches in length and one eighteen-inch Smallmouth Bass.  Additional panfish species sampled were Green Sunfish, hybrid sunfish, Pumpkinseed, and Rock Bass.  Rough fish species included Bowfin, Brown Bullhead, Shorthead Redhorse, White Sucker, and Yellow Bullhead.   <br> \n       <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Little Birch Lake is an 838-acre lake located about two miles southwest of Grey Eagle. Maximum depth is 89 feet making it the deepest lake in the Little Falls Management Area. Deep water structure such as sharp weed-line breaks and sunken bars are common. Shallower water habitat includes expansive areas of emergent vegetation such as hardstem bulrush, floating-leaf plants such as white and yellow water lily and a diverse submerged plant community. Water clarity is good throughout the year, averaging 10 feet or more during summer months. Recreational boating and fishing is popular especially during weekends and holidays. A DNR-owned public access is located on the northwest end of the lake. <br> \n <br> \nThis particular survey was completed to assess current abundance and size structure of Bluegill, Black Crappie, Largemouth Bass, Smallmouth Bass and young-of-year (YOY) Walleye. Gill netting was not completed during this survey and is proposed for 2019.  <br> \n <br> \nFall electrofishing catch rate for YOY Walleye was considerably higher than catch rates in 2016 and 2017, indicating good survival of fish that were stocked as fry in the spring. Walleye fry have been stocked annually since 2005. Fingerling stocking was also completed in odd-numbered years during 2003-2011.  <br> \n <br> \nSpring trap netting indicates the Bluegill population consists mostly of small to medium-sized fish. About 30 percent of the sample was greater than 7.5 inches.  Black Crappie sample size was too small to make accurate inferences regarding population characteristics. Fish that were sampled measured 4.5 to 11.1 inches. Electrofishing sampled Smallmouth Bass ranging from 10.5 to 18.5 inches (mean 14.7 inches). The majority of Largemouth Bass sampled were 15 inches or less. Overall, Little Birch is regarded as a good lake to catch Smallmouth and Largemouth Bass. <br> \n <br> \nAt this time, habitat supporting Cisco is still present in Little Birch Lake. Oxythermal conditions however are strained during late summer, effectively squeezing mid-lake depths to a very narrow band of water in which sufficient oxygen and cold water are maintained.  As climate change continues to warm our waters, species such as Cisco are beginning to decline.      <br> \n</p>",

A Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MNDNR) owned concrete boat ramp is located on the northwest shore. Little Birch Lake has 8.61 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 89 feet. The lake is primarily managed for Walleye and secondarily for Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, and Smallmouth Bass. The lake was initially surveyed in 1981 and 36 fish sampling surveys or investigations have occurred since, then with the most recent prior sampling in 2020 (Fall Young of Year Walleye Assessment). Fall night electrofishing has been completed on an annual or biennial basis since 1995 on Little Birch Lake. <br> \n <br> \nAn hour of fall night electrofishing was conducted on Little Birch to evaluate young of year Walleye abundance from fry stocking. Walleye fry (800,000 fry, 3,000/littoral acre) were stocked in spring 2021. The catch rate observed for young of year Walleye was 11.0/hour, which was slightly above the median (10.3/hour) calculated from previous fall assessments. Walleye fingerlings captured averaged 7.5 inches and ranged from 7.1 to 8.0 inches in total length, which was above average compared to mean lengths from previous fall surveys (mean 6.7 inches, range 5.6 to 8.0 inches). No yearling or older Walleye were encountered during sampling. While Walleye natural reproduction occurs with some regularity on Little Birch Lake, none was observed in 2020 when no stocking occurred on the lake. <br> \n <br> \nHistorically, electrofishing catch rates have not corresponded well with gill net catches, suggesting they may be an imprecise indicator of future recruitment to the fishery. In other words, if the fall electrofishing survey documents the presence of young of the year Walleye, a year class of unknown strength has been produced. However, if fall electrofishing fails to capture young Walleye, it does not necessarily indicate that no year class was produced. In the past, gill net surveys have identified good year classes from years when no young Walleyes were caught in fall electrofishing surveys. It is also important to note that summer gillnet catches have regularly documented year classes from non-stocked years indicating that significant natural reproduction also occurs. <br> \n</p>",

The sampling crew noted high amounts of submerged vegetation in normally barren shallow sampling stations, which may have impacted young of the year Walleye catches. No young of the year Walleye were captured during the survey. Typically, around 10, but as many as 76, Walleye averaging 6.0-7.0 inches in length are captured in an hour of fall electrofishing on Little Birch Lake. In addition, no yearling or older Walleye were encountered during sampling. While Walleye natural reproduction occurs with some regularity on Little Birch Lake, none was observed in 2020 when no stocking occurred on the lake. In response to the lack of Walleye captured during this fall assessment and continued declines in summer gillnet surveys, a total of 5,540 Walleye fingerlings were stocked in October 2022. A similar stocking occurred in 2019 (9,505 fingerlings) following poor fall juvenile Walleye catch rates and low summer gillnet catch rates. Fall fingerling stockings have contributed significantly to the fishery in the past, although current high Northern Pike populations may limit survival of these fish. Anglers are encouraged to harvest pike on Little Birch Lake according to statewide regulations, especially those under 22 inches. Doing so may help with future Walleye management. <br> \n <br> \nHistorically, fall young of the year Walleye electrofishing catch rates have not corresponded well with future gill net catches, suggesting they may be an imprecise indicator of recruitment to the fishery. In other words, if a fall electrofishing survey documents the presence of young of the year Walleye, a year class of unknown strength has been produced. However, if fall electrofishing fails to capture young Walleye, it does not necessarily indicate that no year class was produced. In the past, gill net surveys have identified good year classes from years when no young Walleyes were caught in fall electrofishing surveys. It is also important to note that summer gillnet catches have regularly documented year classes from non-stocked years indicating that significant natural reproduction or immigration from other lakes occurs. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Little Birch Lake (DOW# 77-0089; Lake Class 22) is an 839 acre lake located near Grey Eagle, Minnesota. A Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MNDNR) owned concrete boat ramp is located on the northwest shore. Little Birch Lake has 8.61 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 89 feet. The lake is primarily managed for Walleye and secondarily for Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, and Smallmouth Bass. The lake was initially surveyed in 1981 and 30 fish sampling surveys or investigations have occurred since then with the most recent prior sampling in 2016 (standard survey). Fall night electrofishing has been completed on an annual or biennial basis since 1995 in Little Birch Lake. <br> \n <br> \nAn hour of fall night electrofishing was conducted on Little Birch to evaluate success of annual fry stocking. The young of year (YOY) Walleye catch rate was 9.53 fish per hour. This was lower than in 2016 (19.00 fish per hour), and was nearer the lower end of historic catch rates (0.0-78.2 fish per hour). Historically, electrofishing catch rates have not corresponded well with gill net catches, suggesting they may be an imprecise indicator of future recruitment to the fishery. Mean length of YOY Walleye was 7.39 inches. This was smaller than in 2016 (7.96 inches), but was the second largest YOY Walleye mean length observed.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>This standard survey is part of the regular survey schedule for Little Birch Lake which is every four years. Twelve gill nets, eight spring trap nets (fished two nights) and one hour of electrofishing was used to assess the relative abundance of targeted species including Walleye, Northern Pike, Yellow Perch, Bluegill, Black Crappie and Black Bass from May through early August 2023. Little Birch is primarily managed for Walleye through artificial stocking however it has a very good Smallmouth Bass fishery.    <br> \n <br> \nThe 2023 Walleye catch rate has improved since 2017 but is still not satisfactory from a management or angling perspective. Since 1999, catch rates suggest a declining trend in abundance despite a modest improvement from 2019 to 2023. Data summaries from all surveys indicate an increasing trend in the proportion of larger fish while smaller Walleyes are comprising less of the sample. On a positive note, it appears that the 2021 year class survived well and comprised the majority of the 2023 sample (14-16 inches). Also noted from aged fish was that growth rates are fast, suggesting Walleyes are finding adequate prey, possibly small perch (2-3 inch fish). Yellow Perch have been all but absent in our standard gill nets for years on Little Birch Lake which has led us to believe their status as essentially eliminated from the fish community. However, special small-mesh gill nets were employed in 2022 which found high numbers of small perch. All of this suggests these small perch are being utilized by larger predator fish.  <br> \n <br> \nHistorical stocking analysis indicates fingerling stockings prior to 2012 succeeded in producing decent Walleye fisheries however, fingerling production efficiencies have plummeted and become much more expensive than they used to be. A switch to fry stocking after 2012 showed early promise but has since proven ineffective at achieving Walleye management goals. Fingerling stockings have therefore been restarted (2019, 2022) and are planned to continue as a priority during even numbered years. Walleye fry will be stocked during odd numbered years.    <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike abundance has been trending upward since 2000. Population size structure has remained similar but may be improving in recent years. Number of pike exceeding 28 inches in gill nets is the highest it's been since 1999. At this time however, there are too many small pike in the fish community, and it is hoped that anglers will continue to harvest up to 10 fish less than 22 inches as much as legally possible. Lower Walleye gill catches have coincided with higher pike numbers. <br> \n <br> \nThe Smallmouth Bass fishery in Little Birch Lake is considered high-quality and draws considerable interest from anglers, perhaps more so than Largemouth Bass. Smallmouth bass sampled are usually large, averaging about 17 inches. A small, aged sample found that mean length at time of capture for age 5 fish was 15.7 inches. Two, 18 inch fish were aged to be 13 and 20 years old. Largemouth Bass captured ranged from 3.4 to 17.8 inches and averaged 12.4 inches. Data from 2019 and 2023 suggest that between Largemouth and Smallmouth Bass, Smallmouth Bass offer the higher quality fishery.  <br> \n <br> \nPanfish populations were mainly assessed using spring trap nets, but data from gill nets and electrofishing were also examined. Bluegill were much more abundant in samples than were Black Crappie. The 2019 year class of crappies was most common in our sampling. These fish averaged 10.1 inches in length. Our largest crappie was 12.1 inches. Trap net catch rates for Bluegill 8 inches and larger were less in 2023 than they were in 2017, however this may be due to sampling variability. <br> \n <br> \nAt the time of this survey, water clarity was measured down to 19.0 feet. Habitat for Cisco was determined to be marginal, and this species has not been seen in summer gill nets since 2011. Special sampling with vertical gill nets in 2017 captured 2 adult Cisco. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>       Fall electrofishing was conducted on Little Birch Lake to evaluate the success of spring fry stocking.  Annual fry stocking was initiated in 2012 after a previous regime of even-year fry stocking and odd-year fingerling stocking.  A Study IV project involving Oxytetracycline marking compared the contribution of fry and fingerling stocking to the fishery from 2005 to 2009. Both fry and fingerlings were marked with Oxytetracycline during that time period.  Results from the study showed that both methods of stocking appeared to contribute about equally to the population.  Those study results were used to justify changing to annual fry stocking which is a more cost effective method of providing a walleye fishery. <br> \n       Only nine fingerling walleye were netted in the 2014 fall electrofishing effort for a catch rate of 9.3/hour which was well below the catches of 77/hour in 2012 and 78/hour in 2008.  Other catches have varied from 37/hour in 2013, 5/hour in 2010, 18/hour in 2006, 20/hour in 2005, to 7.5/hour in 2001.  No young of year walleye were caught in 2000 and 1997.  A new electrofishing boat purchased in 2007 along with two netters seemed to improve catch rates as well as species diversity in the electrofishing runs. <br> \n        Due to the low fingerling catch in the fall of 2010, spring electrofishing was tried to see if the 2010 year class might show up better as yearlings.   The spring electrofishing effort proved to be a more effective method for sampling that year class.  A total of 86 yearling Walleye were netted for a catch rate of 126/hour.   <br> \n        Past gill net catches have demonstrated that both fry and fingerling stocking have contributed to the Walleye population.  In the 2011 summer survey, 57% of the Walleye caught were from the 2009 year class which corresponded to a fingerling stocked year class.  A fry stocked year from 2008 accounted for 26% of the sample.  The dominant year class in the 2007 summer gill nets was from 2005 (67%), which was both a fry and fingerling stocked year. <br> \n        In some fall electrofishing efforts, yearling Walleye have comprised a significant portion of the \"other\" Walleye catches.  In the 2013 fall electrofishing assessment 69% (11 of 16) of the \"other\" fish were yearlings.  Yearlings were also a major component of the \"other\" Walleye catch in 2012 (16 of 24), 2010 (51 of 59), 2008 (15 of 18), and 2006 (27 of 27).  In four of the electrofishing efforts, the yearling year classes corresponded with fingerling stocked years. <br> \n       Other fish species observed during the 2014 fall electrofishing effort were small Bluegill, adult Channel Catfish, bullheads, Largemouth Bass, small Northern Pike, Smallmouth Bass, a young of year Tullibee, White Sucker, and Yellow Perch.  Three runs were conducted for a total of almost an hour of on-time.  Water clarity was good.  Chara or muskgrass was quite common in the runs but most of the young of year Walleye were found on barren sand. <br> \n       Annual fry stocking has produced a Walleye population at desired levels and that method of Walleye management will continue to be used.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>      A spring ice-out assessment was conducted on Little Birch Lake which targeted spawning adult Walleye.  The capture methods included up to nine lake survey trap nets as well as night time electrofishing during the netting period.  Six standard lake survey trap nets were set the first week, lifted four times, and laid down over the weekend.  An additional three trap nets were added the following Monday when the first six nets were reset.  There was a total of forty-nine trap net lifts with two nets not being counted during the assessment.  This was the first assessment to target spawning adult Walleye.  A summer gill net survey was also conducted in late July of 2015. <br> \n     The 2015 spring ice-out trap net assessment sampled fifty-six Walleye between 15.3 and 28.4 inches in length.   Mean length for the catch was 22.3 inches or four pounds with a modal length of 20 \u0013 21 inches.  Fish exceeding twenty inches comprised 73% (n=41) of the sample.  The 2015 electrofishing effort netted thirty Walleye ranging from 15.6 \u0013 28.6 inches in length.  Mean length for the sample was not as long as in the trap nets at twenty-one inches but the modal length was the same.  A lower percentage of the catch exceeded twenty inches (63%; n= 19) when compared to the trap net sample. <br> \n      Ten year classes (2002 through 2011) were represented in the 2015 spring ice-out trap net assessment and nine (2002, 2003, 2005, 2006, and 2008 through 2012) in the spring electrofishing Walleye catch.  The strongest year class represented in both samples was from 2008, 25% (n=22) of the combined catches which was from a fry stocked year.   Walleye in the 2015 spring assessments were aged with dorsal spines and there was not a high confidence in aging especially for fish over seven years old.  Many of the fish appeared to be ten to thirteen years of ages.   Average length in female Walleye age groups was from 2.3 to 6.7 inches longer than average length of males of the same age. <br> \n      The summer gill nets in 2015 sampled forty Walleye between 10 and 28.4 inches in length.  The 3.3/GN catch was a significant decrease from the 5.2/GN catch in 2011 and below the 25% quartile of 4/GN for lake class 22.  The 2015 gill net catch was also a record low for Little Birch Lake.   Mean length was shorter at 18.3 inches when compared to the two spring sampling methods, however, the gill net modal length was the same as in the spring efforts.  Smaller Walleye comprised a larger portion of the summer sample as only 38% (n=15) of the fish exceeded twenty inches.   <br> \n      Fall electrofishing was also conducted in 2015 to evaluate the survival of Walleye fry stocked in the spring.  Results from the effort (54/hour) suggest good survival.   Since the practice of annual fry stocking began in 2012, young of year Walleye catches have varied from 9 (2014) to 75 (2012) fish per hour in fall electrofishing assessments.   <br> \n      A spring ice-out assessment was conducted in Little Birch Lake in 1999, but the goal of that assessment was an evaluation of the fish community.  Net locations were different than those in 2015 to sample all species.  The 1999 assessment caught 114 Walleye between 15.1 and 30.3 inches in length with a mean length of 20.1 inches.   Modal length for the sample was 18 \u0013 19 inches with 41% (n=47) of the fish exceeding twenty inches.   <br> \n      Results from the 2015 assessments suggest that despite annual fry stocking since 2012, the Walleye population in Little Birch does not appear to be at desired levels.   A record low Walleye catch was observed in the 2015 summer gill nets and spring catches were also lower than expected.  The fall young of year electrofishing catch, however, was the second highest since 2012.  Northern Pike and Channel Catfish numbers appear to be at record highs when looking at the 2015 summer gill net catches.  The Northern Pike gill catch of 13.3/set was highest catch rate to date for Little Birch Lake and well above the 75% quartile of 7.9/GN for lake class 22.  The 6.5/GN catch for Channel Catfish in 2015 was a significant increase from the 1.8/GN catch in 2011.  The high pike and catfish numbers could be having a detrimental effect on the Walleye population. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Little Birch Lake is an 838 acre basin with a maximum depth of 89 feet.    The lake is characterized by moderate fertility with summer water clarity in the 7-9 foot range.  Over 200 homes/cabins are found along the lake's shore but extensive undeveloped areas are still present.  The lake contains a diversity of habitat features including rocky points and shoals, cattail lined bays, submerged vegetation beds, overhanging trees and most notably, extensive bulrush flats.  This abundance of habitat features results in the existence of a great variety of both gamefish and non- gamefish species.  Little Birch receives considerable recreational use including boating, water skiing, swimming and fishing.  <br> \n     Walleye are the primary management species on Little Birch.  Walleye fry are stocked each spring, and some natural reproduction occurs.  Despite regular stocking efforts,   DNR nets sampled a record low number of Walleye in 2015.  Anglers continue to report decent Walleye fishing and a wide range of sizes and year classes are still present.  Northern Pike abundance has been increasing steadily over the past 15 years and is at an all-time high, which may be a factor in the lower Walleye numbers.  Management goals call for a much lower pike population due to their predation on small Walleye.  As pike abundance has increased their average size has declined and is now below 2 pounds.  A few pike attain 30 inches or longer but in lower numbers than in the past.   A reduction in the population of small pike through angler harvest would potentially benefit the lake's fish community. <br> \n     Little Birch supports favorable populations of both Largemouth and Smallmouth Bass.  Smallmouth Bass seem to be more popular with anglers.  Smallies in the 14-17 inch range are most common and some exceed 20 inches.  Largemouth Bass in the 15-17 inch range are readily available with the average size a little over 1 pound.  Bluegills are relatively abundant and fish over 8 inches will comprise a fair proportion of the angler's catch.  Sunfish exceeding 9 inches are not uncommon.    Black Crappie populations are often difficult to assess using netting data, however spring electrofishing and ice-out trap netting produced a significant sample.  Small crappies in the 4-6 inch range were most prevalent in the ice-out gear while 10-12 inch fish dominated the electrofishing catch, which included a specimen just over 14 inches long.   Crappie recruitment seems to be pretty consistent.   <br> \n     Channel Catfish numbers have risen dramatically since they were first observed in 1999.  Catfish now outnumber Walleye and Smallmouth Bass in gill net samples.   A majority of these fish are in the 20-23 inch range with an average weight of over 3.5 pounds.  The catfish population does not appear to be heavily exploited by anglers.  Average size is about 1 pound.  Yellow Bullheads are found in modest numbers with the largest exceeding 14 inches long.  Common Carp catches are relatively low and show no increasing trend.  White Sucker catches are within the normal range. <br> \n     Northern Cisco (Tullibee) were not sampled in any DNR gear in 2015 but are still believed to reside in the lake.  Cisco can be difficult to encounter in the types of sampling conducted by the DNR.  A continued absence of cisco during subsequent DNR sampling efforts would be a cause for concern.   Cisco are sensitive to warming and degradation of water quality so their presence is a positive indicator of lake health.  Little Birch sustains at least 9 additional sensitive species classified as \"intolerant\" by the MPCA.  This list includes:   Rock Bass, Smallmouth Bass, Blacknose Shiner, Mimic Shiner, Tadpole Madtom , Logperch, Banded Killifish, Iowa Darter, and Least Darter (Special Concern).   The presence of these intolerant species is further evidence that the lake provides desirable water quality and habitat conditions.   Several other small fish species are found in the lake providing an abundant and diverse prey base for larger species.   Growth rates of predatory fish such as Walleye, Northern Pike, and bass are relatively fast.  Proper land use practices in the watershed and along the shoreline are encouraged to maintain the lake's water quality.  Minimizing vegetation removal and other habitat disruption will help ensure Little Birch Lake continues to provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>      Little Birch Lake is a deep (89 feet) lake located between Big Birch Lake and Sylvia Lake on the Todd/Stearns County line.  The lake has an abundance of deep water structure and habitat along with weed lines and sunken points for anglers to try.  Agriculture is more apparent around the main basin of the lake which has most of the shallow water habitats.  Water clarity was average for lakes in this area of the State with a secchi disk reading of 7.3 feet in mid-July.   <br> \n     Fishing is a popular pastime on the lake and Little Birch supports a diverse fish community providing ample  angling opportunities.   Little Birch is a popular walleye lake year round and a wide range of sizes were observed in the summer survey, although most fish were between 12 and 17 inches.  While the gill net catch rate was below management goals, it was within the normal range when compared to similar type lakes.   Management strategies for Little Birch Lake include annual walleye fry stocking.  Fry stocking has shown to produce year classes which have contributed significantly to the walleye population. <br> \n     Northern pike abundance continues to increase which is an undesirable development.  High reproductive success in recent years appears responsible for the increased numbers.  Most of the pike caught in the survey were between 19 and 22 inches in length.  Anglers are encouraged to harvest the smaller northern pike under 24 inches and release the larger ones to help achieve a more balanced fish community and promote good growth rates.  Lower pike numbers may also increase small walleye survival and allow both yellow perch and tullibee numbers, which continue to be low, to increase.   Higher perch and tullibee populations are desirable as they can be important prey species for both walleye and northern pike.   <br> \n     Tullibee are a species that needs well oxygenated, cooler water for survival and so are not present in many lakes in the south half of Minnesota.  Tullibee are frequent victims of summer kill when the cooler, deeper water becomes depleted of oxygen and the upper layers of water become too warm.  Several tullibee were found floating during the survey having succumb to summer kill.      <br> \n     Little Birch Lake supports both smallmouth and largemouth bass.  Both appear to be abundant and quality size fish of both species were observed.  Black crappie and bluegill are both much sought after species in the lake.  Neither of the species appear to be overly abundant and some nice size fish of both species can be found.  Six to seven inch bluegill were common in a spring assessment conducted in 2011, with some eight to nine inch fish observed.  A variety of sizes were found in the black crappie catches from the spring and summer surveys, with fish up to thirteen inches documented.   <br> \n    Channel catfish numbers have increased since the last survey and fish between 14 and 19 inches were common in the summer survey.  Catfish are a recent addition to the fish community and were first documented in 1999.  They likely came up the Sauk River system and entered Little Birch Lake from Sylvia Lake.  Some other species of fish from the same family found in the lake include bullheads.  Although yellow bullhead was the only species caught in the summer survey, a brown bullhead had been  caught in the spring assessment.  The presence of yellow bullhead can be an indicator of good water quality as they are more abundant in lakes with clear water as opposed to black bullhead which are more common in turbid water. <br> \n     Carp abundance appears to be within the normal range when compared to similar type lakes.  No obvious habitat impacts from carp have been observed.  A new species documented in Little Birch Lake that can be confused with carp, but is actually related to suckers, was bigmouth buffalo.  This species, like the catfish, likely came from the Sauk River system and entered through Sylvia Lake.   <br> \n     Two aquatic invasive species, curly leaf pondweed and eurasian watermilfoil are present in Little Birch Lake.  Anglers and lakeshore owners should be especially diligent about cleaning their boats and trailers when leaving the lake to prevent the spread of the exotics to other lakes in the area. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>NORTHERN PIKE, ROCK BASS, GREEN SUNFISH, PUMPKIN- SEED, BLUEGILL, YELLOW BULLHEAD AND LARGEMOUTH BASS EXHIBITED AVG  POPULATIONS AS NET CATCHES WERE BETWEEN THE FIRST AND THIRD QUARTILES. ADDI- TIONAL ASSESSMENT METHODS ARE NEEDED TO MORE ACCURATELY DETERMINE THE LARGEMOUTH BASS POPULA- TION. WALLEYE BOWFIN AND WHITE SUCKER CATCHES REFL ECTED HIGH POPULATIONS. BLACK BULLHEADS WERE QUITE HIGH IN GILLNETS BUT AVERAGE IN TRAPNETS. DATA IMPLIES A RELATIVELY HIGH POPULATION OF SMALL BULLHEADS. HYBRID SUNFISH CATCH (9.82/TRAPNET) WAS ABOVE THE STATEWIDE MEDIAN. BROWN BULLHEAD, YELLOW PERCH AND BLACK CRAPPIE CATCHES WERE BELOW THE FIRST QUARTILE. BLACK CRAPPIE NET CATCHES WERE LOW BUT LARGE NUMBERS OF ABOVE AVERAGE SIZE FISH HAVE BEEN CONSISTANTLY TAKEN OVER THE PAST 2-3 YEARS BY ANGLERS. THIS MAY INDICATE UNAVAILABILITY OF SUSPENDED FISH TO NETTING METHODS USED. NORTHERN CISCO CATCHES (0.50/GILLNET) WERE BELOW THE STATEWIDE MEDIAN, BUT A 1985 FALL NETTING CATCH RATE OF 52/GILLNET SUGGESTS A RELATIVELY HIGH POPULATION PRESENT. TWELVE (12) GILLNETS WERE SET IN JULY 1981 AND 1986. BASED ON THESE NET CATCHES, THE NORTHERN PIKE POPULATION HAS DECREASED. THE WALLEYE AND YELLOW PERCH POPULATIONS HAVE IN- CREASED. NORTHERN PIKE SCALES AGED (18 OF 18) SHOWED AGES II THROUGH IV. AGES II AND III WERE MORE ABUNDANT THAN AGE IV. GROWTH RATES WERE ABOVE THE STATEWIDE MEDIAN FOR ALL AGES. MEAN WEIGHT IN 1981 WAS 2.7 PDS AND 2.6 PDS IN 1986. LENGTHS RANGED FROM 14.0 TO 36.9 INCHES WITH A MEDIAN GROUP OF 22.0 TI 22.9 INCHES IN 1981. THE 1986 LENGTHS RANGED FROM 18.0 TO 22.9 INCHES. THE 1986 GILLNET CATCH SHOWED A 44% DECREASE FROM THE 1981 GILLNET CATCH. LITTLE BIRCH LAKE HISTORICALLY HAS A LOW NORTHERN PIKE POPULATION EVEN WHEN TWO NORTHERN PIKE SPAWNING AREAS WERE OPERATED. WALLEYE RANGED FROM 10.0 TO 28.9 INCHES IN LENGTH WITH YEAR CLASSES II THROUGH V PRESENT. AGE CLASSES PRESENT COINCIDE WITH ALL YEARS FINGERLING WERE STOCKED, EXCEPT 1985 WHICH WAS A BLANK YEAR. THE POPULATION HAS INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY WITH 76% CONSISTING OF AGE II FISH FROM THE 1984 STOCKING. THE STOCKING TOOK PLACE WITH 1984 FIN- GERLINGS AND 1984 YEARLINGS THAT WERE STOCKED IN THE SPRING OF 1985. MEAN WEIGHT OF 1981 FISH WAS 1.1 PDS FOR 1986. THE SLIGHT DECREASE CAN BE DIRECTLY ATTRIBITED TO THE PREPONDERANCE OF AGE II FISH CAUGHT. ALL AGES REFLECTED AVG GROWTH RATES. SMALLMOUTH BASS AGES II THROUGH IV WERE PRESENT IN NET CATCHES. LENGTHS RANGED FROM 5.5- 17.9 INCHES (1981) AND 6.5 - 15.9 INCHES (1986). MEAN WEIGHTS HAVEREMAINED CONSTANT (1.2 PDS). AVG GROWTH RATES WERE INDICATED FOR ALL AGE CLASSES. LARGEMOUTH BASS AGE CLASSES II AND III WERE PRESENT. GROWTH RATES APPEARED AVG FOR BOTH AGES. LENGTH GROUPS IN 1981 RANGED FROM 5.0 - 9.4 AND FROM 7.5 - 13.9 INCHES IN 1986. A SMALL NUMBER OF CISCO WERE TAKEN IN 1986 (6 FISH). SIZES WERE 7.5- 8.4 INCHES (2 FISH) AND 15.0 - 15.9 INCHES (4 FISH). A 1985 FALL GILLNET CATCH OF 52.0/GILL- NET SUGGESTED A RELATIVELY HIGH POPULATION. SIZES RANGED  FROM 13.0 - 16.9 INCHES. TRIAENOPHORUS WAS PRESENT IN 60% OF TULLIBEES SAMPLES IN 1985. ONLY 1 CISCO WAS TAKEN IN 1981. YELLOW PERCH APPEAR TO HAVE INCREASED IN NUMBERS. THE 1986 GILLNET CATCH SHOWED A 99% INCREASE FROM 1981. THE 1986 GILLNET CATCH WAS LOW (7.5/GILLNET) BUT INCREASED SIGNI- FICANTLY FROM 0.16/GILLNET IN 1981. MEAN WEIGHT HAS DECREASED SLIGHTLY FROM 0.1 TO 0.08 PDS. LENGTHS RANGE FROM 4.5 - 7.9 INCHES. BLACK CRAPPIE LENGTHS RANGED FROM 5.5 - 12.9 INCHES. WEIGHTS AVERAGED 0.4 PDS AND 34% WERE 9.0 INCHES OR GREATER IN LENGTH. LENGTH FREQUENCY DISTRIBUTION OF BLUEGILLS WAS FROM 3.0 - 7.9 INCHES. MEAN WEIGHT WAS0.13 PDS AND ONLY 5% OF FISH MEASURED WERE 7.0 INCHES OR GREATER. BLACK BULLHEAD NUMBERS APPEAR TO BE HIGH WITH MOSTLY SMALL FISH PRESENT. LENGTHS RANGED FROM 5.5 - 11.4 INCHES AND A MEAN WEIGHT OF 0.2 PDS. EIGHTY-PERCENT (88%) OF FISH MEASURED WERE 8.0 INCHES OR LESS IN LENGTH. ROCK BASS AND PUMPKINSEED EXHIBITED SIZE RANGES OF 3.5 - 9.4 AND 4.0- 6.9 INCHES RESPECTIVELY. ROCK BASS 7.0 INCHES AND GREATER MADE UP 33% OF THE CATCH.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Little Birch Lake is a deep (89 feet), moderately clear lake located on the Todd/Stearns County border.  Little Birch contains an abundance of deep water structure and habitat as only 33% of the lake is 15 feet deep or less.  Because it's watershed is agricultural, shoreland development is high, and carp are present, algae blooms sometimes occur and can cause the water to have a greenish tint.  Bottom types present in shallow water include sand, gravel, rubble, boulder, and marl.  Aquatic vegetation grows to a depth of 14 feet in most areas.  Prominent underwater plants include muskgrass, flatstem pondweed, sago pondweed, claspingleaf pondweed, Canada waterweed, bushy pondweed, northern water milfoil, and coontail.  Commonly seen emergent plants include white and yellow waterlily, hardstem bulrush, and common cattail.  The Big Birch Lake outlet flows into the east side of the upper basin of Little Birch Lake where a fish barrier exists.  The outlet from Little Birch Lake flows to Sylvia Lake which eventually flows to the Sauk River via Adley Creek.     Little Birch Lake is a popular fishing lake with desirable and diverse populations of fish.  Little Birch has a reputation for producing good catches of walleye, especially during spring and early summer.  Walleye numbers were average when compared to lakes similar to Little Birch but were on the low end of the historical range for this lake.  This population has been the result of good natural reproduction and supplemental stocking of walleye fingerlings in odd years (ie. 1995, 1997, 1999).  Walleye grow fast in Little Birch Lake when compared to other lakes in the area and reach \"keeper\" size in three years.  Good year classes in 1996 and 1997 should provide excellent fishing for 15 to 17 inch walleyes and there are trophies to ten pounds present.  Releasing medium and large walleyes would help sustain a quality walleye population.  The future of walleye angling on Little Birch may be even brighter with the construction of two spawning reefs by the Little Birch Property Owners Association.     The northern pike population displayed two desirable characteristics, low numbers and fast growth.  While pike numbers were in the low end of the \"normal\" range for this lake type, nearly half of the pike captured were greater than 24 inches in length which was near our management goals.  Pike in excess of 10 pounds have been caught in past fish surveys on Little Birch Lake and angler reports of even larger northerns have been documented.  High northern pike populations typically have a negative impact on other important game and preyfish species, especially walleyes and yellow perch.  We recommend that anglers release large northern pike over 24 inches and keep smaller individuals for meals.  This will help maintain a healthy, balanced fish community.     Anglers seeking bass may be surprised to catch more smallmouth bass than largemouth bass.  Smallmouth abundance is more than three times what is normally seen on these types of lakes and fish in the 15 to 16 inch range are common.  Trophies are also present as smallmouth bass in excess of 19 inches have been caught in past surveys.  Largemouth bass are present in low to moderate numbers.  An abundance of bulrush and waterlily along shorelines provides excellent habitat for both species of bass. It is recommended that smallmouth over 10 inches and largemouth over 12 inches be released to ensure that these quality fisheries are maintained.     Good panfishing opportunities exist on Little Birch Lake with bluegill numbers within the normal range for this type of lake.  Over half of the bluegill in our nets were over six inches in length and quality fish in the eight inch range were present.  Little Birch has an above average black crappie population and is known for producing good fishing at times.  Net catches in 1999 indicated an increase in crappie abundance since the last survey and most were greater than 9 inches in length.  Black crappiesto near 13 inches were sampled during this survey.     Little Birch Lake has a diverse prey base that includes yellow perch, tullibee (cisco), white suckers and an assortment of different shiner species.  Yellow perch numbers are typically low on Little Birch for unknown reasons but were seen in both northern pike and walleye stomachs.  The fact that most shallow areas have steep drops to deep water may cause our gillnets to be ineffective in capturing perch.  Tullibee and white suckers are average in abundance in Little Birch Lake and offer excellent food sources for trophy walleye and northern pike.     Other species present in the lake include (black, brown, and yellow) bullhead, bowfin (dogfish), common carp, hybrid sunfish, pumpkinseed sunfish, channel catfish, rock bass, and shorthead redhorse.  </p>",

The walleye fry that were stocked in the spring of 2008 were marked with oxytetracycline as part of a Study IV project.   The object of the study is to determine the relative contribution of fingerling stocking, fry stocking, and natural reproduction to the walleye population. No marked fingerlings were available in 2007 so no yearling walleye were collected during the electrofishing effort.   A total of 68 young-of-year walleye were netted for a catch rate of 78/hour, which was the highest catch rate ever recorded for Little Birch Lake.  Catch rates in 2006 and 2005 were similar at 18.2/hour and 19.9/hour with a catch rate of 7.5/hour in 2001.   A new electrofishing boat along with an additional netter was used in the 2008 electrofishing effort, which likely improved the catch rate.  New catch rates will be developed from results with the new boat.   <br> \n    The 2008 young-of-year walleye ranged from 4.4 to 7.6 inches in length with a mean length of 5.6 inches.  An additional eighteen 1+ walleye were also netted during the electrofishing effort.  Those walleye measured from 8 to 20.7 inches in length with a mean length of 11.3 inches.  Ages 1, 3, and 8 were represented in the 1+ walleye catch.  The majority (85%) of the aged fish came from the 2007 year class.  The Age 1 walleye exhibited normal growth while growth in the older fish varied when compared to an Area Mean Back-calculated Length Table.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Little Birch Lake is a deep (89 feet) lake downstream from Big Birch Lake on the Todd/Stearns County line.  The lake has an abundance of deep water structure and habitat as only 33% of the lake is 15 feet deep or less.  The watershed is primarily agricultural and much of the lake shoreline heavily developed which leads to the presence of algae in the summer time.  Little Birch Lake Association has been proactive at promoting watershed and shoreline management practices which could help improve water quality in the lake.  Gillnets and electrofishing were the only methods used in this survey to sample the fish community as gamefish were the primary targets.  One development which occured this summer was the discovery of Eurasian Milfoil in the lake.  Anglers should be especially diligent about cleaning their boats and trailers when leaving the lake to prevent the spread of the exotic to other lakes in the area.    Fishing is a popular pastime on the lake and Little Birch Lake supports a diverse fish community which can provide plenty of angling opportunities.  Anglers have reported an excellent year for catching walleye and the 2001 year class seemed to be providing most of the fish which were between 12 and 15 inches.  Numbers were up from the last survey but they remain within the normal range when compared to similar type lakes.  While natural reproduction does provide some fish to the population, it does not appear to be enough to withstand the fishing pressure and meet the desired population levels.  Walleye fry stocking occurs in odd years followed by fall fingerling stocking when necessary.    Northern pike also appeared to have increase in abundance which is an undesirable development.  With the increased abundance came a decrease in average size of the pike from 3 pounds in 1999 to 2.5 pounds in 2003.  Despite a large 2001 year class, growth rates continue to be good for the pike.    Little Birch Lake supports both smallmouth and largemouth bass populations with the smallmouth being more common.  Smallmouth abundance is more than 5 times what is normally seen on these types of lakes and fish in the 15 to 16 inch range are common.  Trophies are also present as fish up to 19 inches have been caught.  Largemouth bass are present in low to moderate numbers with the average size being about 10 inches.  An abundance of bulrush and waterlily along the shoreline provides excellent habitat for both species of bass.  It is recommended that smallmouth over 10 inches and largemouth over 12 inches be released to ensure that these quality fisheries are maintained.    One fish that may surprise most anglers on Little Birch Lake could be the presence of channel catfish.  Channel catfish likely came up from the Sauk River system and entered Little Birch Lake from Sylvia Lake over 4 years ago.  The catfish have really made Little Birch their home and done well.  All of the cats seen were between 19 and 27 inches in length and in excellent shape.  Anglers have also reported an increase in the number of catfish being caught.    Anglers reported good winter fishing for both black crappies and bluegills last year.  The lake supports an abundant crappie population.  Most of the crappies netted during the survey were been less than 9 inches in length, however, crappies just over 12 were observed.  While the average size of the bluegills seen in the summer survey was only about 5 inches, larger bluegills up to 9 inches are present.    Carp are one of the species that has shown an increase in abundance since the last survey.  Most of the carp appear to be from one year class as the majority were between 20 and 23 inches.  A similar phenomon was also seen in the 1991 survey when a record high gillnet catch was recorded and most of the fish were from 15 to 16 inches in length.  High numbers of carp can be hard on rooted lake vegetation and a cause of elevated water turbidity.    Little Birch Lake has a diverse prey base that includes yellow perch, tullibee or cisco, white suckers, and a variety of shiners.  Yellow perch numbers have typically been low in the lake but examinations of northern pike and walleye stomachs show they still provide a source of food for the gamefish.  Tullibee and sucker abundance appear at normal levels when compared to similar type lakes and they offer excellent food sources for trophy pike and walleye.    The only bullhead species to be netted during the survey was the yellow bullhead, but the other two species, black and brown, are also present in the lake.  Yellow bullheads over 12 inches were common in the survey with some up to 14 inches being observed.  Other fish species sampled included bowfin or dogfish, hybrid sunfish, pumpkinseeds, rock bass, and shorthead redhorse.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Fall electrofishing was performed on Little Birch Lake to provide a sample of young-of-year and yearling walleye for OTC mark detection.  Walleye fingerlings stocked in the fall of 2005 carried OTC (oxytetracycline) marks in their otoliths as did the walleye fry stocked in the spring of 2006.  These fish were marked with OTC as part of a Study IV project designed to determine the relative contributions of fingerlings stocking, fry stocking and natural reproduction to the walleye population.  Additional juvenile walleye were collected in the winter of 2006-07 through cooperation with local anglers who provided ice-angled fish thereby increasing our sample size.  Mark detection was conducted using fluorescence microscopy. <br> \n <br> \nResults:  A total of 42 otoliths from young-of-year walleye were examined for marks with 41 of the 42 fish carrying readable marks.  This data suggests strongly that fry stocking was the overwhelming contributor to the 2006 year class of walleye in Little Birch Lake.  It also indicates little contribution from natural reproduction. <br> \n    A sample size of 50 yearling walleye were also examined for marks.  Roughly 1/3 of the fish (16 fish) showed readable marks indicating the 2005 fingerling stocking contributed to the sample but was likely not the primary source of Age I fish.  Fry stocking, which also occurred in 2005, and natural production accounted for 2/3 of the sample.  An additional sample of 20 fingerling walleye was collected from Schreiers Pond, which was the pond of origin for the walleye fingerlings stocked in Little Birch in 2005.  All 20 fish displayed readable marks demonstrating that the 2005 marking was effective and fish from the 2005 fingerling stocking should have provided readable marks. <br> \n <br> \nFuture Evaluation:  Similar sampling efforts will take place in 2008 to examine for marks placed on fingerling stocked walleye in 2007 and fry stocked walleye in 2008.  Results of these additional evaluations are expected to provide sufficient data to determine the most cost effective strategy for walleye management on Little Birch Lake.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>      Fall night electrofishing was conducted on Little Birch Lake to evaluate the success of spring fry stocking.   Since 2006, fry have been stocked in Little Birch Lake in even-numbered years and fingerlings in odd-numbered years.   Three electrofishing runs were done around the lake for a total of one hour of effort.  A total of five young-of-year walleye were netted along with 58 other walleye, many which were yearlings.   <br> \n     Catch rates for walleye young-of-year have varied in the fall electrofishing efforts.  The highest catch was in 2008 when 68 young-of-year were netted (78/hour).  Catch rates in 2006 and 2005 were similar at 18/hour and 20/hour, respectively.  The 2001 catch rate was 7.5/hour while no young-of-year were sampled in 2000 and 1997.  The 1995 fall electrofishing catch rate was 13/hour. <br> \n      A Study IV project was conducted on Little Birch Lake to evaluate the relative contribution of fry and fingerlings to the walleye population.  Fry marked with Oxytetracycline were stocking in both 2006 and 2008.  Fingerlings marked with Oxytetracycline were stocked in 2005 and 2009.  No marked fingerlings were available in 2007.  Results from the study suggested that the fry stocking in 2006 and 2008 overwhelmingly contributed to those year classes of walleye while natural reproduction added little.  The OTC marked fingerlings stocked in 2005 on the other hand comprised about 1/3 of the 2006 sample, indicating that natural reproduction and fry stocking were also major contributors to the 2005 year class. <br> \nScales were taken from 42 walleye between 6.8 and 16.7 inches in length during the 2010 electrofishing effort.  The majority of fish (86%) appeared to be from the 2009 year class, a fingerling stocked year.   <br> \n      Spring night electrofishing was also conducted in 2010 to collect yearling walleye, which may have come from the fall fingerling stocking, to check for OTC marks.  A total of 86 walleye were netted in less than an hour of effort during the 2010 spring electrofishing effort.   Eighty percent (80%) of the fish (n=69) were yearlings with some additional fish from the 2006 through 2008 year classes along with some from 2004 and one from 2000.  Sixty-five to 70 yearlings were saved for OTC inspection.   <br> \n       The fish from both electrofishing efforts will be checked for the mark later this year.</p>",
