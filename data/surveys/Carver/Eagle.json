                "narrative": "<p> Eagle Lake is a 233-acre, class 43 Lake located in western Carver County near the city of Young America.  Eagle Lake is shallow (maximum depth: 14 feet) and highly eutrophic.  Eagle Lake is similar to the other nearby lakes and is best characterized as a boom-bust lake.  Angler attention is primarily focused towards the cyclic black crappie population, particularly during the winter months.  Winter angling effort can be very high when the black crappie population is high, and very low when the black crappie population is down.  In recent years black crappie size has remained small and angler effort has been low.  Walleye and tiger muskellunge are stocked into Eagle Lake, although they receive proportionately less attention.  Prolific algal blooms and high water temperatures can hamper summer angling.  Summer water clarity averages 1 foot, and dissolved oxygen levels at depths greater than 9 feet were insufficient to support fish at the time of this survey.  Two public accesses are found on the south and east shorelines.   <br> \n <br> \nTrapnets and gillnets were used to sample the fish population of Eagle Lake during the third week of July 2008.  Twelve species were sampled with black crappie and bluegill dominating trapnet catches and black crappie dominating gillnet catches.  The black crappie trapnet (45.29 fish/net) and gillnet (209.75 fish/net) catches were the highest recorded since 1996 and exceeded the 75th percentile two-fold.  Black crappies were small, averaging 6.99 inches and 0.19 pounds.  Only twelve percent of sampled black crappie exceeded 8 inches while 1 percent exceeded 10 inches.  The largest black crappie sampled measured 12.24 inches.  Black crappie mean weight was just below and above the 25th percentile for trapnets and gillnets respectively.  Condition indices indicate black crappie were in fair condition, however condition declined significantly with length indicating a resource bottleneck affected larger individuals.  This relationship was evident during sampling, as smaller fish appeared to be in normal condition while larger fish appeared emaciated.  Black crappie recruitment in Eagle Lake appears to be inconsistent, a common phenomena in black crappie populations.  Five age classes (3-7) were represented in the black crappie catch, however an astonishing 97 percent (883) originated from the 2005 year-class.  Angling for black crappie has the potential to be excellent in 2-3 years if this large year class is able to overcome the resource bottleneck that affected larger fish at the time of this survey.  Black crappie growth was similar to other area class 43 lakes. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill trapnet catch (45.86 fish/net) was half that found in 2002, but was still more than double the 75th percentile.  Sampled bluegill averaged 5.6 inches, and 26 percent exceeded 6 inches.  The largest bluegill sampled was 7.5 inches.  Bluegill mean weight (0.2 pounds) was below the 25th percentile.  Condition indices indicate bluegills were in fair condition.  Similar to black crappie, bluegill condition decreased significantly with length indicating a resource bottleneck affected larger individuals.  Five age classes (2-6) were represented in the bluegill catch.  Bluegill growth was slower than other class 43 lakes in the area. <br> \n <br> \nPrevious assessments have sampled walleye in average to excellent abundance in Eagle Lake.  In 1996, the walleye catch exceed the 75th percentile at 26.5 fish/net.  This high catch was the result of excellent survival of stocked fry in 1994.  These fish averaged 11.1 inches at the time of the 1996 assessment.  This large year-class also contributed to the 2002 catch.  However, in 2008 the walleye catch was 1.75 fish/net.  Six walleyes from the 2001 year-class and 1 walleye from the 1994 year-class were sampled.  This indicates inconsistent survival of annually stocked walleye fry.  The large crappie population found in Eagle Lake is likely contributing to the inconsistent walleye fry survival.  However, when fry stocking is successful an excellent fishery can be created as evidenced by the 1996 assessment.  Sampled walleye grew fast, and growth was higher than other similar lakes. <br> \n <br> \nEight tiger muskellunge were sampled with an average length and weight of 37.4 inches and 13.51 pounds.  Tiger muskellunge grew fast and were in good condition.  Tiger muskellunge are stocked every three years. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Eagle Lake is a 183-acre lake with a maximum depth of 14 feet. The lake is located north of the City of Norwood Young America in western Carver County. Due to shallow water depths, an aerator is operated during winter months to prevent winter kill. Eagle is actively managed for Walleye, with secondary emphasis on Bluegill. Eagle also supports catchable populations of Northern Pike and Black Crappie. The Walleye population is maintained through odd numbered year fall fingerling (4-6 inches) stocking. Public water access is provided by DNR Parks and Trails on the southeast side of the lake off County Road 135 (up to 12 vehicle/trailer parking spaces). <br> \n <br> \nA standard survey (9 trap nets/4 gill nets) was completed on Eagle Lake during the week of 7/17/2023 to monitor water quality and fish populations. Water color was green, with low water clarity, measured at 1.0 foot during the time of this survey. Despite low water clarity, oxygen was 5.9 parts per million (ppm) at a bottom depth of 12 feet, meaning fish were able to use the entire water column during our mid-summer survey. <br> \n <br> \nModerate numbers of Walleye were sampled with gill nets (5.5/net), near the expected catch rate of similar metro lakes. Average length of Walleye sampled in gill nets was 18.2 inches with the largest measured at 20.3 inches. Despite zero large (>21\") Walleye measured, 100% of Walleye caught were of quality size (>16\"). Walleye growth in Eagle Lake was fast compared to similar lakes across the metro, indicated by an average length of 18.2 inches by age 4. A strong year class of Walleye (16-20\") should provide excellent angling opportunity currently and into the future. <br> \n <br> \nHigh numbers of Bluegill were sampled with trap nets (29.8/net) above the expected catch rate of similar metro lakes. There were 268 Bluegill sampled in trap nets during the 2023 survey, with an average length of 5.7 inches, and the largest measured at 8.1 inches. Half of all Bluegill sampled were less than 6 inches with less than 1% greater than 8 inches. Although Bluegill are abundant, relatively few large fish can be found. <br> \n  <br> \nHigh numbers of Northern Pike were sampled with gill nets (10.5/net), above the expected catch rate of similar metro lakes. There were 42 Northern Pike sampled in gill nets during the 2023 survey, the highest catch in the previous 25 years. Average size of Northern Pike in the 2023 survey was 24.6 inches with the largest measured at 29.3 inches. Despite the lack of pike greater than 30 inches, high numbers of moderate sized individuals should provide decent angling opportunity. <br> \n <br> \nExtremely high numbers of Black Crappie were sampled with gill nets (188/net) and trap nets (18.4/net) well above the expected catch rate of similar metro lakes. There were 918 Black Crappie sampled during the 2023 survey, with an average length of 7.3 inches, and the largest measured at 11.7 inches. The presence of 11-inch crappie suggests angling could be worthwhile, however anglers should be prepared to sort through many small fish along the way. <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species sampled in were Black Bullhead, Golden Shiner, Pumpkinseed, and Yellow Perch. <br> \n <br> \nEurasian Watermilfoil, a submersed invasive aquatic plant has been found in Eagle Lake and remains present. Eurasian watermilfoil can limit recreational activities on water bodies by forming mats on the water surface and alter aquatic ecosystems by displacing native plants. The most important action that you can take to limit the spread of milfoil and other aquatic invasive plants is to remove all vegetation from your watercraft before you move it from one body of water to another.</p>",

ALL FOUR FISH COLLECTED WERE FROM THE 1990 STOCKING OF YEARLINGS (1989 YEAR CLASS).  THE SAMPLED TME AVERAGED 29.5 INCHES TOTAL LENGTH (TL), 6.25 POUNDS EACH, AND EXHIBITED A GOOD RATE OF GROWTH.  BLG WERE SAMPLED BELOW STATE AND LOCAL TRAP NET MEDIANS FOR NUMBER AND POUNDS PER SET.  SAMPLED BLG, WHILE FEW IN NUMBER, EXHIBITED ABOVE AVERAGE GROWTH RATE.  BLG AVERAGED 7.29 INCHES TL AND 2.76 FISH PER POUND. BLG PSD AND RSD WERE CALCULATED AT 88.24 AND 82.35 PERCENT, RESPECTIVELY, LMB WERE SAMPLED ABOVE ALL MEDIAN LEVEL FOR TRAPNETS.  LMB GROWTH WAS FOUND TO BE AVERAGE THROUGH AGE II+, BUT SLIGHTLY BELOW AVERAGE FOR AGE III+ INDIVIDUALS.  WAE WERE SAMPLED ABOVE STATE AND LOCAL TRAPNET MEDIANS FOR NUMBER PER SET, BUT BELOW STATE AND LOCAL TRAPNET MEDIANS FOR POUNDS PER SET.  GROWTH WAS FOUND TO BE SLIGHTLY BELOW AVERAGE FOR WAE.  ALL SAMPLED INDIVIDUALS RECRUITED INTO THE WAE POPULATION FROM SPRING FRY STOCKING.  THE NUMBER OF YOY WAE IN THE SHORELINE SEINE SAMPLE INDICATES THAT A POTENTIALLY STRONG YEAR CLASS MAY BE ABOUT TO RECRUIT INTO THE OVERALL POPULATION.  GSF, PMK, AND FHM WERE ALSO PRESENT IN THE CATCH, BUT IN LOW NUMBERS.</p>",

Two year old walleyes from the 1994 fry stocking were captured in abundance during the 1996 survey. The average size walleye was 11.1\" and 0.43 pounds per fish, with individuals up to 20.5\" long also present in the sample. Largemouth bass averaging 8.4 inches long were also sampled in above average numbers. The largest bass captured measured 15.4 inches in length. Northern Pike and Hybrid Muskie are also present, but in relatively low abundance at the time of this survey. Bluegill and pumpkinseed sunfish, while sampled in relatively high numbers, averaged small in size at this time. Only one-third of the bluegill and one-sixth of the pumpkinseeds measured were 6.0 inches or longer. Black crappie averaged only 6.0 inches in length, however individuals up to 11.3 inches were captured during this survey. Growth rates for all three species are above average at the time of the 1996 survey. Black bullhead were found to be less abundant and of a larger average size than those scmpled during the two previous assessments.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Eagle Lake is a 183-acre, shallow lake near Young America, in Carver County.  MN DNR Parks and Trails owns a boat access on the lake's eastern shore.  With a maximum depth of 14 feet, Eagle Lake is prone to temperature- and oxygen-related stresses at certain times of year; an aeration system is operated in winters.  Walleye are stocked in Eagle regularly, and populations of Northern Pike, Black Crappie, Bluegill, and Yellow Perch were also present in the summer survey of 2018.  During the writing of this report, there was winterkill evidence in winter 2018-19.   <br> \n <br> \nAlthough not highly abundant, Walleye and Northern Pike were present in 2018 and many good-sized fish were sampled.  Walleye ranged in length from 16.4 to 21.7 inches, with an average size of 18.3 inches and 2.11 pounds.  Ninety-six percent of sampled Northern Pike exceeded 22 inches, and 76% exceeded 26 inches.  A new regulation for Northern Pike took effect in 2018; as part of the North-Central zone, there is a possession limit of ten Northern Pike under 22 inches, and 2 over 26 inches, with a protected slot of 22 to 26 inches on Eagle Lake.  <br> \n  <br> \nMost apparent in 2018's survey was a highly abundant Black Crappie population.  Ninety percent of the catch measured between 6.5 and 8.0 inches in length.  With winterkill occurring in 2018-2019, the potential impact could mean better-sized crappie in the near future.   <br> \n <br> \nBluegill were caught at an average rate, and larger fish were present in 2018.  Bluegill lengths ranged between 2.6 and 9.9 inches, with an average size of 5.7 inches and 0.19 lbs.  Yellow Perch were also caught at an average rate, however the fish were not very large.   <br> \n <br> \nThis lake's fish community is dynamic from the fertile, sometimes-marginal environmental conditions, and fishing potential for all species continues to fluctuate regularly.   <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Eagle Lake is a shallow, productive lake of 233 acres.  With a maximum depth of only 14 feet, the lake is entirely littoral in nature.  Historically the lake experienced boom and bust fishing that coincided with frequent winterkill events.  Installation of an aeration system in 1978 reduced the frequency of winterkill, but partial events have occurred in subsequent years. Gill nets captured 5.8 walleye per net, which is below the catch typical of this type of lake.  The 1996 survey found 26.5 per net.  This wide fluctuation in walleye numbers is due to variable success of annual fry stockings.  Fry stocking in Eagle Lake appears to have the potential to occasionally create excellent walleye fishing, but will likely maintain a moderate population in between large year-classes.  The average size of sampled fish was 18.23 inches and 3.1 pounds, and 45% of walleye exceeded 20 inches.  Northern pike averaged 4.6 per gill net, the highest catch since 1978.  Mean length was 19.6 inches.  The largest individual sampled was 34.2 inches.  All but 3 of the 24 fish sampled were hatched in 2000, suggesting that average size will improve as these fish mature.Hybrid (\"Tiger\") muskellunge are stocked every third year.  Seven hybrids were sampled between the 2 gears in the 2002 survey.  Six fish stocked in 2001 averaged 16.8 inches, and 1 fish from the 1998 stocking measured 35.8 inches.Black crappie were abundant in gill and trap nets, averaging 98.6 and 31.33 per net, respectively.  Mean length was 6.1 inches in gill nets and 7.8 inches in trap nets.  Six percent sampled in gill nets exceeded 10 inches, while 9 % from trap nets were over 10 inches. Bluegill averaged 102.8 per trap net, higher than any previous survey on this lake.  Mean length was 5.4 inches, and 12% exceeded 7 inches.Pumpkinseed mean trap net catch was 17.7.  Mean length was 4.9 inches, and only 3% exceeded 7 inches.Although gill and trap nets are generally not highly effective at sampling largemouth bass, 3.0 per gill net and 1.1 per trap net were captured.  Mean length was 10.3 inches.  Seventy-nine percent were from the 2000 year-class.  As these fish mature, bass fishing should improve in Eagle Lake.Black bullhead, hybrid sunfish, and yellow perch were also sampled in this survey.</p>",
