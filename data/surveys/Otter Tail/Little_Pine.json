                "narrative": "<p>     Little Pine Lake is a 1,969-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located in northeastern Otter Tail County approximately two miles north of Perham, MN.  Little Pine Lake is a part of the Otter Tail River Watershed and is connected to Big Pine Lake via the Otter Tail River.  The Otter Tail River inlet is located along the west shoreline of the lake while the outlet is located along the southeast shoreline.  The Otter Tail River is navigable by boat upstream of Little Pine Lake.  The immediate watershed is composed primarily of agricultural land interspersed with hardwood woodlots; however, there has recently been an increase in residential development.  The maximum depth of Little Pine Lake is 63 feet; however, thirty-five percent of the lake is less than 15 feet in depth.  The secchi disk reading during the 2023 survey was 10.5 feet.  Previous secchi disk readings ranged from 5.5 to 18.5 feet.      <br> \n     The shoreline of Little Pine Lake has been extensively developed.  Homes, cottages, and resorts compose the majority of the development.  A DNR owned concrete public access is located off of County Road 8 along the southeast shoreline of the lake.  A city owned (Perham) concrete public access is located off of County Road 51 along the west shoreline of the lake.   Remnant stands of hardstem bulrush and common cattail are located in the area near the Otter Tail River inlet.  Emergent aquatic plants such as bulrush and cattail provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat, and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish such as Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, and panfish.  They also serve as important nursery areas for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit.  To maintain the excellent water quality and angling that this lake has to offer, it is imperative to preserve the quality of the aquatic habitat.  <br> \n     Little Pine Lake is a popular angling lake during both the open water and ice fishing seasons.  The lake has a reputation as one of the premier Walleye fishing lakes in Otter Tail County.  Northern Pike are also abundant and have an excellent size distribution as well.  The prolificacy of these species can be attributed to the abundance of suitable spawning habitat that is available.  <br> \n     A special gillnetting survey was conducted to analyze the Walleye and Northern Pike populations.   <br> \n     Walleye abundance has historically been high in Little Pine Lake.  Walleyes ranged in length from 7.5 to 21.9 inches with an average length and weight of 14.6 inches and 1.1 pounds.  Age and catch data indicate that the 2020 year class is very strong and should provide excellent Walleye angling for several years.  Age and catch data from recent lake surveys also indicate that Walleye natural reproduction is substantial enough to consistently sustain the Walleye population at or above DNR management objectives. Walleyes attain an average length of 14.9 inches at four years of age.   <br> \n     An experimental Walleye regulation was implemented on May 10, 2003.  The regulation is an 18.0 to 26.0 protected slot limit with one Walleye over 26.0 inches allowed in possession.  The intent of this regulation is to improve the size structure of the Walleye population in Little Pine Lake.   <br> \n     Northern Pike ranged in length from 17.5 to 35.0 inches with an average length and weight of 22.4 inches and 2.5 pounds. Pike exhibit fast growth rates with an average length of 25.0 inches at four years of age.   <br> \n     Lake Sturgeon were sampled for the first time in Little Pine Lake during the 2023 survey.  A Lake Sturgeon restoration plan for the Otter Tail River system began in 2002.  Data from various surveys throughout the river system indicate that the restoration plan has been successful thus far. <br> \n     The DNR controlled Otter Tail River outlet dam was removed in 2023 and replaced with a rock-rapids structure.  This will allow water levels to be maintained at historical levels and will also allow for the passage of fish species both upstream and downstream of Little Pine Lake. <br> \n     Anglers can maintain the quality of angling in Little Pine Lake by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large-size fish while allowing the harvest of the more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future.          <br> \n     Little Pine Lake was listed as infested with zebra mussels in 2020.  Aquatic invasive species are threatening Minnesota waters.  The non-native fish species can potentially harm water quality, water recreation, aquatic habitat, native species, and fish populations.  Anglers can help prevent the introduction and spread of invasive species by following watercraft transportation laws.      <br> \n</p>",

The abundance of yellow perch appears to be quite adequate for the predatoray species sampled.  <br> \n     The abundance of walleye, as measured by gill net CPUE, has declined considerably since 1986, but is very similar to the CPUE observed in 1979 and 1983.  Evidence of natural reproduction is indicated by the presence of the 1985 and 1987 year classes, which were skip years in the stocking sequence. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>     Little Pine Lake is a 1,969-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located in northeastern Otter Tail County approximately two miles north of Perham, MN.  Little Pine Lake is a part of the Otter Tail River Watershed and is connected to Big Pine Lake via the Otter Tail River.  The Otter Tail River inlet is located along the west shoreline of the lake while the outlet is located along the southeast shoreline.  The Otter Tail River is navigable by boat upstream of Little Pine Lake.  A Minnesota DNR controlled dam at the outlet impedes navigability downstream to Big Pine Lake.  The immediate watershed is composed primarily of agricultural land interspersed with hardwood woodlots; however, there has recently been an increase in residential development.  The maximum depth of Little Pine Lake is 63 feet; however, thirty-five percent of the lake is less than 15 feet in depth.  The secchi disk reading during the 2011 lake survey was 9.0 feet.  Previous secchi disk readings ranged from 5.5 to 18.5 feet.      <br> \n     The shoreline of Little Pine Lake has been extensively developed.  Homes, cottages, and resorts compose the majority of the development.  A DNR owned concrete public access is located off of County Road 8 along the southeast shoreline of the lake.  A city owned (Perham) concrete public access is located off of County Road 51 along the west shoreline of the lake.   Remnant stands of hardstem bulrush and common cattail are located in the area near the Otter Tail River inlet.  Emergent aquatic plants such as bulrush and cattail provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat, and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish such as northern pike, largemouth bass, and panfish.  They also serve as important nursery areas for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit.  To maintain the excellent water quality and angling that this lake has to offer, it is imperative to preserve the quality of the aquatic habitat.  <br> \n     Little Pine Lake is a popular angling lake during both the open water and ice fishing seasons.  The lake has a reputation as one of the premier walleye fishing lakes in Otter Tail County.  Northern pike and yellow perch are also abundant and have good size distributions as well.  The prolificacy of these species can be attributed to the abundance of suitable spawning habitat that is available.   <br> \n     Walleye is a primary management specie in Little Pine Lake.  Walleyes ranged in length from 7.1 to 25.6 inches with an average length and weight of 15.0 inches and 1.4 pounds.  Age and catch data from recent lake surveys indicate that walleye natural reproduction is substantial enough to consistently sustain the walleye population at or above DNR long range management goals.  Walleye exhibit moderate growth rates with an average length of 14.9 inches at four years of age.     <br> \n     An experimental walleye regulation was implemented on May 10, 2003.  The regulation is an 18.0 to 26.0 protected slot limit with one walleye over 26.0 inches allowed in possession.  The intent of the regulation is to improve the size structure of the walleye population in Little Pine Lake.  The regulation will be in effect for ten years during which time its effectiveness will be evaluated.  <br> \n     Northern pike abundance is the highest recorded for this lake.  The northern pike population exhibits good size distribution and above average growth rates.  Pike ranged in length from 10.7 to 33.5 inches with an average length and weight of 20.2 inches and 1.9 pounds.  Fourteen percent of the pike were at least 24.0 inches in length.  Pike attain an average length of 24.6 inches at four years of age.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Little Pine Lake is a 1,969-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located in northeastern Otter Tail County approximately two miles north of Perham, MN.  Little Pine Lake is a part of the Otter Tail River Watershed and is connected to Big Pine Lake via the Otter Tail River.  The Otter Tail River inlet is located along the west shoreline of the lake while the outlet is located along the southeast shoreline.  The Otter Tail River is navigable by boat upstream of Little Pine Lake.  A Minnesota Department of Natural Resources' (DNR) controlled dam at the outlet impedes navigability downstream to Big Pine Lake.  The immediate watershed is composed primarily of agricultural land interspersed with hardwood woodlots; however, there has recently been an increase in residential development.  The maximum depth of Little Pine Lake is 63 feet; however, thirty-five percent of the lake is less than 15 feet in depth.  The secchi disk reading during the 2002 lake survey was 18.5 feet which indicates excellent water clarity.  Previous secchi disk readings ranged from 5.5 to 9.0 feet.  Little Pine Lake is included in class 27 of the Minnesota DNR  lake classification scheme.        The shoreline of Little Pine Lake has been extensively developed.  Homes, cottages, and resorts compose the majority of the development.  The 1992 lake resurvey referenced four resorts and approximately 250 homes/cottages.  A DNR owned concrete public access is located off of County Road 8 along the southeast shoreline of the lake.  A city owned (Perham) concrete public access is located off of County Road 51 along the west shoreline of the lake.  The shoal water substrates consist primarily of sand and gravel.  Remnant stands of hardstem bulrush and common cattail are located in the area near the Otter Tail River inlet.  Emergent aquatic plants such as bulrush and cattail provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat, and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms, and can actually absorb and break down polluting chemicals.  Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish such as northern pike, largemouth bass, and panfish.  They also serve as important nursery areas for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit.  To maintain the excellent water quality and angling that this lake has to offer, it is imperative to preserve the quality of the aquatic habitat.      Little Pine Lake is a popular angling lake during both the open water and ice fishing seasons.  The lake has a reputation as one of the premier walleye fishing lakes in Otter Tail County.  Northern pike and yellow perch are also abundant and have good size distributions as well.  The prolificacy of these species can be attributed to the abundance of suitable spawning habitat that is available.       Walleye is a primary management specie in Little Pine Lake.  The test-net catch rate for walleye was the third highest recorded since the 1958 initial survey and was well in excess of the normal range for class 27 lakes and the DNR long range management goal.  Walleye ranged in length from 7.2 to 25.2 inches with an average length and weight of 16.8 inches and 1.7 pounds.  Age and catch data from recent lake surveys indicate that walleye natural reproduction and recruitment is substantial enough to consistently sustain the walleye population at or above DNR long range management goals.  Walleye exhibit average growth rates with an average length of 15.0 inches at four years of age.         An experimental walleye regulation will be implemented on May 10, 2003.  The regulation is an 18.0 to 26.0 protected slot limit with one walleye over 26.0 inches allowed in possession.  The intent of the regulation is to improve the size structure of the walleye population in Big Pine Lake.  The regulation will be in effect for ten years during which time its effectiveness will be evaluated.      The test-net catch rate for northern pike was the highest recorded in any lake survey conducted on Little Pine Lake; however, the pike population would be considered to be of moderate density.  The northern pike population exhibits an excellent size distribution and average growth rates.  Pike ranged in length from 11.8 to 31.4 inches with an averagelength and weight of 22.3 inches and 2.6 pounds.  Thirty-six percent of the pike were at least 24.0 inches in length.  Pike attain an average length of 22.7 inches at five years of age.       The yellow perch test-net catch rate indicates that perch are very abundant in Little Pine Lake.  Historical test-net catch rates have documented large fluctuations in yellow perch abundance.  Perch ranged in length from 4.5 to 11.6 inches with a mean length of 7.7 inches.  Thirty-five percent of the yellow perch were at least 8.0 inches in length.     The DNR does not stock any fish in Little Pine Lake.  The fish species present are able to sustain their levels at or above  DNR management goals.  This is an indication of the quality of fish habitat that is present.  To maintain the excellent fishing this lake has to offer, it is imperative to preserve the quality of the aquatic habitat.  The DNR will continue an intensive assessment program to monitor the walleye population and the extent of natural reproduction.     Anglers can also maintain the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large-size fish while allowing the harvest of the more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future.      </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>     Little Pine Lake is a 1,969-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located in northeastern Otter Tail County approximately two miles north of Perham, MN.  Little Pine Lake is a part of the Otter Tail River Watershed and is connected to Big Pine Lake via the Otter Tail River.  The Otter Tail River inlet is located along the west shoreline of the lake while the outlet is located along the southeast shoreline.  The Otter Tail River is navigable by boat upstream of Little Pine Lake.  A Minnesota DNR controlled dam at the outlet impedes navigability downstream to Big Pine Lake.  The immediate watershed is composed primarily of agricultural land interspersed with hardwood woodlots; however, there has recently been an increase in residential development.  The maximum depth of Little Pine Lake is 63 feet; however, thirty-five percent of the lake is less than 15 feet in depth.  The secchi disk reading was 7.0 feet.  Previous secchi disk readings ranged from 5.5 to 18.5 feet.      <br> \n     The shoreline of Little Pine Lake has been extensively developed.  Homes, cottages, and resorts compose the majority of the development.  A DNR owned concrete public access is located off of County Road 8 along the southeast shoreline of the lake.  A city owned (Perham) concrete public access is located off of County Road 51 along the west shoreline of the lake.   Remnant stands of hardstem bulrush and common cattail are located in the area near the Otter Tail River inlet.  Emergent aquatic plants such as bulrush and cattail provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat, and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish such as Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, and panfish.  They also serve as important nursery areas for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit.  To maintain the excellent water quality and angling that this lake has to offer, it is imperative to preserve the quality of the aquatic habitat.  <br> \n     Little Pine Lake is a popular angling lake during both the open water and ice fishing seasons.  The lake has a reputation as one of the premier Walleye fishing lakes in Otter Tail County.  Northern Pike are also abundant and have a good size distribution as well.  The prolificacy of these species can be attributed to the abundance of suitable spawning habitat that is available.   <br> \n     Walleyes ranged in length from 9.1 to 25.4 inches with an average length and weight of 15.5 inches and 1.5 pounds.  Age and catch data from recent lake surveys indicate that Walleye natural reproduction is substantial enough to consistently sustain the Walleye population at or above DNR long range management goals.  Walleye exhibit moderate growth rates with an average length of 15.1 inches at four years of age.     <br> \n     An experimental Walleye regulation was implemented on May 10, 2003.  The regulation is an 18.0 to 26.0 protected slot limit with one Walleye over 26.0 inches allowed in possession.  The intent of the regulation is to improve the size structure of the Walleye population in Little Pine Lake.   <br> \n     The Northern Pike population exhibits good size distribution and above average growth rates.  Pike ranged in length from 11.9 to 33.9 inches with an average length and weight of 23.2 inches and 2.9 pounds.  Forty-one percent of the pike were at least 24.0 inches in length.  Pike attain an average length of 25.4 inches at four years of age.  <br> \n     Anglers can maintain the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large-size fish while allowing the harvest of the more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future.    <br> \n     Little Pine Lake is not listed as an infested water.  Aquatic invasive species are threatening Minnesota waters.  The non-native species can potentially harm water quality, water recreation, aquatic habitat, native species, and fish populations.  Anglers can help prevent the introduction and spread of invasive species by following watercraft transportation laws.  Anglers are required to remove all visible plants, mud, and other prohibited invasive species and drain all water from their boat prior to leaving the water access.     <br> \n    <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>     Little Pine Lake is a 1,969-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located in northeastern Otter Tail County approximately two miles north of Perham, MN.  Little Pine Lake is a part of the Otter Tail River Watershed and is connected to Big Pine Lake via the Otter Tail River.  The Otter Tail River inlet is located along the west shoreline of the lake while the outlet is located along the southeast shoreline.  The Otter Tail River is navigable by boat upstream of Little Pine Lake.  A Minnesota DNR controlled dam at the outlet impedes navigability downstream to Big Pine Lake.  The immediate watershed is composed primarily of agricultural land interspersed with hardwood woodlots; however, there has recently been an increase in residential development.  The maximum depth of Little Pine Lake is 63 feet; however, thirty-five percent of the lake is less than 15 feet in depth.  The secchi disk reading during the 2021 survey was 9.5 feet.  Previous secchi disk readings ranged from 5.5 to 18.5 feet.      <br> \n     The shoreline of Little Pine Lake has been extensively developed.  Homes, cottages, and resorts compose the majority of the development.  A DNR owned concrete public access is located off of County Road 8 along the southeast shoreline of the lake.  A city owned (Perham) concrete public access is located off of County Road 51 along the west shoreline of the lake.   Remnant stands of hardstem bulrush and common cattail are located in the area near the Otter Tail River inlet.  Emergent aquatic plants such as bulrush and cattail provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat, and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish such as Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, and panfish.  They also serve as important nursery areas for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit.  To maintain the excellent water quality and angling that this lake has to offer, it is imperative to preserve the quality of the aquatic habitat.  <br> \n     Little Pine Lake is a popular angling lake during both the open water and ice fishing seasons.  The lake has a reputation as one of the premier Walleye fishing lakes in Otter Tail County.  Northern Pike are also abundant and have an excellent size distribution as well.  The prolificacy of these species can be attributed to the abundance of suitable spawning habitat that is available.  <br> \n     A special gillnetting survey was conducted to analyze the Walleye, Northern Pike, and Yellow Perch populations.   <br> \n     Walleye abundance has historically been high in Little Pine Lake.  Walleyes ranged in length from 7.4 to 28.7 inches with an average length and weight of 15.0 inches and 1.3 pounds.  Age and catch data indicate that the 2018 year class is very strong and should provide excellent Walleye angling for several years.  Age and catch data from recent lake surveys also indicate that Walleye natural reproduction is substantial enough to consistently sustain the Walleye population at or above DNR management objectives. Walleyes attain an average length of 14.1 inches at four years of age.   <br> \n     An experimental Walleye regulation was implemented on May 10, 2003.  The regulation is an 18.0 to 26.0 protected slot limit with one Walleye over 26.0 inches allowed in possession.  The intent of this regulation is to improve the size structure of the Walleye population in Little Pine Lake.   <br> \n     Northern Pike ranged in length from 14.8 to 37.2 inches with an average length and weight of 23.2 inches and 2.9 pounds. Pike exhibit fast growth rates with an average length of 26.4 inches at five years of age.   <br> \n     Historical catch and length data indicate that Yellow Perch abundance and size structure fluctuates.  Six percent of the perch in this survey were 8.0 inches or greater in length. <br> \n     Anglers can maintain the quality of angling in Little Pine Lake by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large-size fish while allowing the harvest of the more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future.          <br> \n     Little Pine Lake was listed as infested with zebra mussels in 2020.  Aquatic invasive species are threatening Minnesota waters.  The non-native fish species can potentially harm water quality, water recreation, aquatic habitat, native species, and fish populations.  Anglers can help prevent the introduction and spread of invasive species by following watercraft transportation laws.      <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Little Pine Lake is a 1,969-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located in northeastern Otter Tail County approximately two miles north of Perham, MN.  Little Pine Lake is a part of the Otter Tail River Watershed and is connected to Big Pine Lake via the Otter Tail River.  The Otter Tail River inlet is located along the west shoreline of the lake while the outlet is located along the southeast shoreline.  The Otter Tail River is navigable by boat upstream of Little Pine Lake.  A Minnesota Department of Natural Resources' (DNR) controlled dam at the outlet impedes navigability downstream to Big Pine Lake.  The immediate watershed is composed primarily of agricultural land interspersed with hardwood woodlots; however, there has recently been an increase in residential development.  The maximum depth of Little Pine Lake is 63 feet; however, thirty-five percent of the lake is less than 15 feet in depth.  The secchi disk reading during the 2005 lake survey was 6.7 feet.  Previous secchi disk readings ranged from 5.5 to 18.5 feet.  Little Pine Lake is included in class 27 of the Minnesota DNR  lake classification scheme.        The shoreline of Little Pine Lake has been extensively developed.  Homes, cottages, and resorts compose the majority of the development.  The 1992 lake resurvey referenced four resorts and approximately 250 homes/cottages.  A DNR owned concrete public access is located off of County Road 8 along the southeast shoreline of the lake.  A city owned (Perham) concrete public access is located off of County Road 51 along the west shoreline of the lake.  The shoal water substrates consist primarily of sand and gravel.  Remnant stands of hardstem bulrush and common cattail are located in the area near the Otter Tail River inlet.  Emergent aquatic plants such as bulrush and cattail provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat, and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms, and can actually absorb and break down polluting chemicals.  Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish such as northern pike, largemouth bass, and panfish.  They also serve as important nursery areas for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit.  To maintain the excellent water quality and angling that this lake has to offer, it is imperative to preserve the quality of the aquatic habitat.      Little Pine Lake is a popular angling lake during both the open water and ice fishing seasons.  The lake has a reputation as one of the premier walleye fishing lakes in Otter Tail County.  Northern pike and yellow perch are also abundant and have good size distributions as well.  The prolificacy of these species can be attributed to the abundance of suitable spawning habitat that is available.       Walleye is a primary management specie in Little Pine Lake.  The test-net catch rate for walleye exceeded the normal range for class 27 lakes and the DNR long range management goal.  Walleye ranged in length from 7.4 to 24.8 inches with an average length and weight of 15.1 inches and 1.3 pounds.  Age and catch data from recent lake surveys indicate that walleye natural reproduction and recruitment is substantial enough to consistently sustain the walleye population at or above DNR long range management goals.  Walleye exhibit moderate growth rates with an average length of 14.0 inches at four years of age.         An experimental walleye regulation was implemented on May 10, 2003.  The regulation is an 18.0 to 26.0 protected slot limit with one walleye over 26.0 inches allowed in possession.  The intent of the regulation is to improve the size structure of the walleye population in Little Pine Lake.  The regulation will be in effect for ten years during which time its effectiveness will be evaluated.      The test-net catch rate for northern pike was equivalent to the lower limit of the normal range for class 27 lakes.  The northern pike population exhibits an excellent size distribution and above average growth rates.  Pike ranged in length from 19.7 to 36.6 inches with an average length and weight of 26.6 inches and 4.6 pounds.  Thirty-six percent of the pike were at least 24.0 inches in length.  Pike attain an average length of 24.8 inches at five years of age.       The yellow perch test-net catch rate indicates that perch are very abundant in Little Pine Lake.  Historical test-net catch rates have documented large fluctuations in yellow perch abundance.  Perch ranged in length from 4.8 to 11.6 inches with an average length of 7.1 inches.  Twenty-one percent of the yellow perch were at least 8.0 inches in length.     The DNR does not stock any fish in Little Pine Lake.  The fish species present are able to sustain their levels at or above  DNR management goals.  This is an indication of the quality of fish habitat that is present.  To maintain the excellent fishing this lake has to offer, it is imperative to preserve the quality of the aquatic habitat.  The DNR will continue an intensive assessment program to monitor the walleye population and the extent of natural reproduction.     Anglers can also maintain the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large-size fish while allowing the harvest of the more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future.      </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>     Little Pine Lake is a 1,969-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located in northeastern Otter Tail County approximately two miles north of Perham, MN.  Little Pine Lake is a part of the Otter Tail River Watershed and is connected to Big Pine Lake via the Otter Tail River.  The Otter Tail River inlet is located along the west shoreline of the lake while the outlet is located along the southeast shoreline.  The Otter Tail River is navigable by boat upstream of Little Pine Lake.  A Minnesota DNR controlled dam at the outlet impedes navigability downstream to Big Pine Lake.  The immediate watershed is composed primarily of agricultural land interspersed with hardwood woodlots; however, there has recently been an increase in residential development.  The maximum depth of Little Pine Lake is 63 feet; however, thirty-five percent of the lake is less than 15 feet in depth.  The secchi disk reading during the 2008 lake survey was 9.2 feet.  Previous secchi disk readings ranged from 5.5 to 18.5 feet.      <br> \n     The shoreline of Little Pine Lake has been extensively developed.  Homes, cottages, and resorts compose the majority of the development.  The 1992 lake resurvey referenced four resorts and approximately 250 homes/cottages.  A DNR owned concrete public access is located off of County Road 8 along the southeast shoreline of the lake.  A city owned (Perham) concrete public access is located off of County Road 51 along the west shoreline of the lake.   Remnant stands of hardstem bulrush and common cattail are located in the area near the Otter Tail River inlet.  Emergent aquatic plants such as bulrush and cattail provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat, and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish such as northern pike, largemouth bass, and panfish.  They also serve as important nursery areas for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit.  To maintain the excellent water quality and angling that this lake has to offer, it is imperative to preserve the quality of the aquatic habitat.  <br> \n     Little Pine Lake is a popular angling lake during both the open water and ice fishing seasons.  The lake has a reputation as one of the premier walleye fishing lakes in Otter Tail County.  Northern pike and yellow perch are also abundant and have good size distributions as well.  The prolificacy of these species can be attributed to the abundance of suitable spawning habitat that is available.   <br> \n     Walleye is a primary management specie in Little Pine Lake.  The test-net catch rate for walleye was within the normal range for this class of lake.  Walleye ranged in length from 7.2 to 26.1 inches with an average length and weight of 16.4 inches and 1.8 pounds.  Age and catch data from recent lake surveys indicate that walleye natural reproduction and recruitment is substantial enough to consistently sustain the walleye population at or above DNR long range management goals.  Walleye exhibit moderate growth rates with an average length of 15.3 inches at four years of age.     <br> \n     An experimental walleye regulation was implemented on May 10, 2003.  The regulation is an 18.0 to 26.0 protected slot limit with one walleye over 26.0 inches allowed in possession.  The intent of the regulation is to improve the size structure of the walleye population in Little Pine Lake.  The regulation will be in effect for ten years during which time its effectiveness will be evaluated.  <br> \n     The test-net catch rate for northern pike was within the normal range.  The northern pike population exhibits an excellent size distribution and above average growth rates.  Pike ranged in length from 13.0 to 33.1 inches with an average length and weight of 23.6 inches and 3.0 pounds.  Forty-one percent of the pike were at least 24.0 inches in length.  Pike attain an average length of 26.0 inches at four years of age.  <br> \n      The yellow perch test-net catch rate indicates that perch are very abundant in Little Pine Lake.  Historical test-net catch rates have documented large fluctuations in yellow perch abundance.  Perch ranged in length from 5.2 to 11.0 inches with a mean length of 7.2 inches.  Twenty-two percent of the yellow perch were at least 8.0 inches in length. <br> \n     The DNR does not stock any fish in Little Pine Lake.  The fish species present are able to sustain their levels at or above  DNR management goals.  <br> \n     Anglers can also maintain the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large-size fish while allowing the harvest of the more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future.       <br> \n</p>",

IBI data was collected in conjunction with Minnesota Pollution Control Agency watershed sampling. Twenty-four 100-foot sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake shore, sampling a variety of habitat types.  Each site is sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot 1/8th-inch mesh seine, depending on habitat conditions.  Sites where habitat conditions did not allow for seining were backpack electrofished unless conditions proved difficult for walking. These sites were backpack shocked from the boat. Twenty-six fish species were represented, including young of the year gamefish species such as Walleye, Northern Pike, largemouth and smallmouth bass. Non-game species sampled included Logperch, Mottled Sculpin, Burbot, Trout Perch, Hornyhead Chub, and Spottail Shiner. Sample catches were dominated by young of the year Yellow Perch and Logperch.</p>",

Northern pike gillnet catches are similar to the previous surveys with a slight increase in the average weight.  The walleye gillnet catch has increased considerably since the previous two assessments. The average weight of walleye was 1.0 lbs.  The 1984 year class is strong.  Aging data, seining and fall electrofishing all indicate that there appeared to be substantial natural reproduction in 1983, 1984, and 1985.  Fall 1986 electrofishing produced substantial young-of-year walleyes which were the result of natural reproduction.  All recent walleye stockings have been with fingerlings. Due to high cost, fingerling stocking should be discontinued and any future walleye stocking should be done with fry since natural reproduction is substantial.  The development and enhancement of walleye spawning sites on Little Pine should be investigated.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Little Pine Lake is located in northeastern Otter Tail County approximately two miles north of Perham, MN.  Little Pine Lake is a 1,969-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake that is located within the Otter Tail River Watershed.  Little Pine Lake is connected to Big Pine Lake via the Otter Tail River.  The Otter Tail River inlet is located along the west shoreline of the lake while the outlet is located along the southeast shoreline.  The Otter Tail River is navigable by boat upstream of Little Pine Lake.  A Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) controlled dam at the outlet impedes navigability downstream to Big Pine Lake.  The immediate watershed is composed primarily of agricultural land interspersed with hardwood woodlots; however, there has recently been an increase in residential development.  The maximum depth of Little Pine Lake is 63 feet; however, thirty-five percent of the lake is less than 15 feet in depth.  The secchi disk reading during the 1999 lake survey was 6.0 feet.  Previous secchi disk readings have ranged from 5.5 to 9.0 feet.  The DNR has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different lake classes based on physical and chemical characteristics of the lakes.  Little Pine Lake is included in lake class 27 of this classification scheme.  Little Pine Lake is located within the DNR's Fergus Falls Management Area.            The shoreline of Little Pine Lake has been extensively developed.  Homes, cottages, and resorts compose the majority of the development.  As referenced in the 1992 lake survey, there are four resorts and approximately 250 homes located on Little Pine Lake.  A DNR owned concrete public access is located off of County Road 8 along the southeast shoreline of the lake.  A city owned (Perham) concrete public access if located off of County Road 51 along the west shoreline of the lake.  The shoal water substrates consist primarily of sand and gravel.  Remnant stands of hardstem bulrush and common cattail are located in the area near the Otter Tail River inlet.  Emergent aquatic plants such as bulrush and cattail provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat, and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms, and can actually absorb and break down polluting chemicals.  Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish such as northern pike, largemouth bass, and panfish.  They also serve as important nursery areas for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit.  To maintain the excellent water quality and angling that this lake has to offer, it is imperative to preserve the quality of the aquatic habitat.      Little Pine Lake is a popular angling lake during both the open water and ice fishing seasons.  The lake has a reputation as one of the premier walleye fishing lakes in Otter Tail County.  Data from the population assessment indicate that the walleye population is abundant and has a good size structure.  The test-net catch rate for walleye was the second highest recorded in any survey on this lake (1958 to 1999).  Walleye ranged in length from 7.1 to 26.9 inches with an average length and weight of 13.5 inches and 1.0 pound.  Age and catch data indicate that the 1996 and 1997 year classes are strong.  These year classes should provide consistently good walleye angling for several years.  Walleye attain an average length of 14.5 inches at four years of age.  Walleye growth rate estimates are equivalent to mean growth rates for walleye in lake class 27 lakes in the Fergus Falls Management Area.       The test-net catch rate for northern pike increased from the previous two lake surveys (1992 and 1996) and was within the normal range for lake class 27 lakes.  Pike ranged in length from 12.4 to 41.5 inches with an average length and weight of 21.7 inches and 2.6 pounds.  Pike attain an average length of 21.7 inches at three years of age.   Pike exhibit excellent growth rates in comparison to other lake class 27 lakes in the Fergus Falls Management Area.     The DNR does not stock any fish in Little Pine Lake.  The fish species present are able to sustain their levels at or above  DNR management goals.  This is an indication of the quality of fish habitat that is present.  To maintain the excellent fishing this lake has to offer, it is imperative to preserve the quality of the fish habitat.  The DNR will continue an intensive assessment program to monitor the walleye population and the extent of natural reproduction.     Anglers can also maintain the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large-size fish while allowing the harvest of the more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future.      </p>",
