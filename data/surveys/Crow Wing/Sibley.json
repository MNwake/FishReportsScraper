Northern pike, carp, brown bullhead, rock bass, largemouth bass and walleye appear to be in low numbers.  Yellow bullhead are the only species that are indicated to be in above average numbers.  Below average growth rates are noted for bluegill, black crappie and yellow perch. Northern pike appear to have average growth rates.  The fish population levels in numbers and average size of fish as determined from the range of median values for appropriate types of gear are indicated by catch rates above the third quartile, and low populations levels by catch rates below the first quartile.  Catch rates falling between the first and third quartiles are indicative of average, or normal numbers for a particular species. Average size of fish for a particular species or mean weight per individual fish are listed as small, average and large.  Average size is indicated by mean weight falling between the first and third quartile.  Small size is indicated by mean weight below the first quartile and large size by mean weight above the third quartile.</p>",

A fair number of smaller fish, with an average length of 10.4\", were captured while spring electrofishing for largemouth bass.  That is an encouraging sign for the future and it appears that the 2012 stocking may have survived fairly well.  Sibley is stocked every third year with 255 pounds of fingerlings. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike numbers were average (3.8/gillnet) and size was good, with an average length of 25.4\" and 65% of the fish measuring 24\" or larger.  Voluntary catch and release of northern pike larger than 24\" will help preserve this fishing opportunity and maintain a balanced fish community.   <br> \n <br> \nNot many bass were caught while electrofishing (20.5/hr) and the size was unremarkable.  Average length was 12\" and 47% of the fish were 12\" or larger.  The largest fish measured 17.5\". <br> \n <br> \nPanfish numbers were good, with 6.4/trapnet for crappie and 29.6/trapnet for bluegill.  Finding larger fish might be difficult at this time.  The average black crappie length was only 6.7\", with 14% of the fish measuring 8\" or larger.  Bluegill average length was 5.9\", with 25% measuring 7\" or larger. <br> \n</p>",

Average size was good at 19.8\", with fish up to 28.9\" captured. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike numbers were average (5.3/gill net) and size was good, with an average length of 25.3\". Fish above the 22-26\" slot made up 38% of the catch.  Anglers are encouraged to use restraint when harvesting Northern Pike on Sibley in order to preserve this unique opportunity.  Please consider releasing the largest fish and preferably only keep those under 22\" in accordance with a new Northern Pike regulation enacted in 2018 for lakes in this part of the state: possession limit of 10 with not more than 2 over 26\".  All from 22-26\" must be immediately released.  Please refer to the current Minnesota Fishing Regulations for additional information. <br> \n <br> \nBass electrofishing was not completed in 2020 due to Covid-19 protocols.  Fish up to 18.2\" were sampled in nets during the survey. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie numbers were good at 5.2/gill net.  The average Black Crappie length was only 6.5\", with 24% of the fish measuring 8\" or larger.  Bluegill numbers were average (16.2/trap net).  Finding fish of harvestable size might be an issue however.  Bluegill average length was 5.3\", with only 2% measuring 7\" or larger. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of nearshore fish species in Sibley Lake was conducted on July 2, 2020 by Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program Staff.  Ten sampling stations were evenly spaced around the lake and each station was sampled by backpack electrofishing.  A 50-foot seine was used to sample three stations, a 15-foot seine was used to sample five stations with steep shorelines, and two sites were not seined due to soft substrates, abundant vegetation, and deep water that prevented wading.  Nearshore sampling captured 20 species of fish including three species that are intolerant of disturbance (i.e., 102 Blacknose Shiners, one Iowa Darter, and one Rock Bass) and one species that is tolerant of disturbance (i.e., 19 Green Sunfish).  Note that the trap net and gill net surveys later in July captured 2 additional tolerant species (Black Bullhead and Common Carp). <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore data are combined with trap net and gill net data from a July 2020 survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based IBI (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment.  In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and healthy habitat (e.g., Banded Killifish, Blacknose Shiner, and Least Darter), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g., Black Bullhead, Common Carp, and Green Sunfish).  The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake.  For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.   <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community in Sibley Lake to the Crow Wing River Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Sibley is a 418 acre lake located at Pequot Lakes in Crow Wing County.  A city owned public access is present on the northeast shore of the lake.  In 1997, there were 152 homes/cabins and one resort located along the 8.1 miles of shoreline.  The lake has a maximum depth of 40 feet and about 61% of the surface area is less than fifteen feet deep.  It is classified as a hardwater lake with moderate phosphorus fertility.  Water clarity was somewhat below average for lakes in the area.  Soils in water less than four feet deep were primarily sandy, with varying amounts of muck, gravel and rubble sized (3-10\") rock present, as well.The aquatic plant community was fairly diverse.  Emergent species help control nutrients in the lake.  Plants like bulrush provide shorelines with some protection from wave caused erosion.  They also enhance the quality of spawning habitat for bass and panfish species.  Wild rice can also enhance spawning habitat for northern pike.  Submerged and floating leafed species provide important cover and food sources for a wide variety of aquatic life.A fisheries lake survey was conducted in 1997.  A variety of sampling gear was used to sample fish populations.  When compared to similar type lakes, the catch rate for black crappie was in the \"high\" category.  Catches of rock bass, brown bullhead, yellow bullhead and bowfin (dogfish) were in the \"low\" category.  Species present in \"average numbers included northern pike, largemouth bass, bluegill, pumpkinseed, yellow perch and white sucker.Past northern pike catch rates generally have ranged from \"low\" to \"average,\" where the 1997 catch fell.  Pike were 16-35 inches long, averaging 23 inches and 3.7 lbs. in size.  Growth was \"good.\"  The 1993 year class was most abundant of the six year classes sampled.  Walleye fingerlings were stocked by the lake association in 1991 and 1993.  Walleyes were sampled in \"low\" numbers 1980, '85 and '90, but were not sampled in the '97 netting.Largemouth bass were caught in \"average\" numbers in '97.  Spring electrofishing was also done to sample bass.  Spring sampled bass ranged from 5-17 inches long, averaged eleven inches long and represented five age classes.  Growth was \"good.\"  Young bass were common in shoreline seine hauls done in early August.Bluegills were caught in \"average\" numbers, similar to the '90 catch.  Five age classes were sampled, the most abundant being from 1994.  Young bluegills were abundant in shoreline seine hauls.  Bluegills grew slowly, but about 7%, measured from trap nets, were at least 7.0 inches long; similar to a value of 8% in the 1990 netting.Black crappies were in the \"high\" abundance category in 1997.  Past catches ranged from \"average\" to \"high.\"  The '94 year class was the most abundant of the three age classes sampled.  Young crappies were common in shoreline seine hauls.  Crappie growth bordered on \"slow.\"Yellow perch and white suckers are important forage species for gamefish.  Both were caught in \"average\" numbers in '97.  Bullheads have typically been caught in \"average\" numbers in past nettings.  Both brown and yellow bullheads were caught in \"low\" numbers in '97.  Common carp are present in the Gull Chain.  They were sampled in \"low\" numbers in Sibley Lake in 1990, but were not sampled in the 1997 netting.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of nearshore fish species in Sibley Lake was conducted on August 5, 2021, by Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program staff. Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake, and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at all 10 sampling stations, but two stations were sampled from the boat due to site conditions. Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample six stations, a 15-foot seine was used to sample two stations, and site conditions prevented the use of a seine at two stations. Nearshore sampling captured 16 species of fish including one species that is intolerant of disturbance (i.e., Blacknose Shiner) and two that are tolerant of disturbance (i.e., Common Carp and Green Sunfish). <br> \n <br> \nA summer trap net survey was also conducted by IBI Program staff on August 11-12, 2021. Nine trap nets were set along the shoreline in locations that encompassed multiple habitat types. Trap net sampling captured 12 species of fish, including one that is tolerant of disturbance (i.e., Common Carp). Bluegill comprised a majority of the catch by number, whereas Common Carp, Bluegill, Yellow Bullhead, and Walleye comprised a majority by biomass. <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore and trap net data were combined with gill net data from a July 2020 survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based IBI (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment. In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g., Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, and Rock Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g., Green Sunfish and Common Carp). The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.  <br> \n <br> \nResults from this survey provide evidence that the fish community in Sibley Lake is adversely impacted by stressors, as indicated by an FIBI score below the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes. These results will be considered when the biological health of the lake is assessed during the Crow Wing River Watershed assessment process, which will be completed in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.</p>",
