A dense crop of small bullheads (mostly age II) was present.  Carp and yellow perch were also very abundant but consisted mainly of younger fish.  Small numbers of bluegill, crappie, white suckers, and northern pike were present but they probably were quite recent migrants from Fountain Lake as Pickerel Lake dam is not always a good fish barrier.  Large yellow perch were providing some angling.</p>",

A city owned earthen public access is located on the southeast corner of the lake off highway 69.  <br> \n\tPickeral Lake was surveyed the week of July 7th, 2008 to monitor the fish community and aquatic habitat. MNDNR Fisheries last surveyed the lake in 1993. Gillnet catches included black bullhead, common carp, black crappie, and yellow perch. Trapnets contained the aforementioned species and orange-spotted sunfish, white sucker, green sunfish, and channel catfish.  <br> \n\tPickeral lake is one of many shallow satellite lakes around the city of Albert Lea and maintains an intermittent connection to the Shell Rock River just north of the lake. Pickeral lake\u0019s fish community is heavily influenced by this connection. Shallow and hypereutrophic, the lake has sparse submergent vegetation occurring in only a few areas and supports mostly underutilized fish species. Current management efforts include installation of an electric fish barrier and potential plans for lake reclamation. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Pickeral Lake is a shallow, 620 acre lake in Freeborn County.  Mean depth is 3.5 feet and maximum depth is 6 feet.  The city of Albert Lea is immediately northeast of Pickeral Lake.  A city-owned earthen public access is located on the southeast corner of the lake off highway 69.  The lake was reclaimed in fall of 2009 and experienced a partial winterkill during winter 2010-2011.  The shallow water column of Pickeral Lake makes it prone to frequent winterkill events.  Thus it is managed as a boom and bust northern pike and yellow perch fishery, where northern pike fry, pre-spawn yellow perch, and sometimes adult bluegills are stocked after reclamations or winterkill events.  These fish then exhibit rapid growth due to the abundance of forage coupled with lack of predation, creating a quality fishery within two or three years following the reclamation or winterkill event.   <br> \n <br> \nPickeral Lake was surveyed the week of July 15th, 2013 as part of a regular monitoring program conducted by Minnesota DNR.  This survey consisted of deploying trap and gill nets to monitor the fish community.   The partial winterkill during 2010-2011 likely contributed to black bullhead being the most abundant fish sampled in the 2013 assessment.  Black bullhead averaged 282.0 fish/gill net, which is above average compared to similar lakes in Minnesota.  Average total length of black bullhead was 7.0 inches for both gear types, which was below an acceptable size to most anglers.  The second-most abundant species sampled in 2013 was bluegill, which averaged 46.0 fish/trap net and had a mean length of about 7.0 inches.  The abundances and weights of bluegill were both above what was considered a normal range for similar lakes in Minnesota.  The size and number of bluegills present in Pickeral Lake should provide quality opportunities for angling.  <br> \n <br> \nPickeral Lake features a high abundance of northern pike.  Northern pike averaged 14.5 fish/gill net, which was above average for this lake type.  Northern pike captured in gill nets ranged in total length from 15.0 to 33.0 inches, with the average total length of 24.0 inches.  The average pike weight was 3.7 pounds, which was above normal for similar lakes in Minnesota.  Most of the northern pike sampled during 2013 were from the 2010-2011 year classes.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch were also prevalent in the 2013 survey with a gill net catch rate of 63.0 fish/net.  The abundance of yellow perch during 2013 was well above average compared to similar Minnesota lakes.   Yellow perch ranged from 5.0 to 12.0 inches with the majority categorized as an acceptable size to most anglers.  Mean weight was 0.4 pounds, which is above average compared to similar lakes in Minnesota.   The yellow perch population looks to provide sufficient opportunity for anglers.   Black crappie, however, were observed in low numbers; mean length was 8.9 inches.  Other fish observed during the 2013 survey included green sunfish, and hybrid sunfish.       <br> \n <br> \nPickeral lake is shallow and hypereutrophic with sparse submergent vegetation.  It is one of many shallow satellite lakes around the city of Albert Lea and maintains an intermittent connection to the Shell Rock River just north of the lake.  Pickeral Lake's fish community is heavily influenced by this connection.  Shoreline areas on the land and into the shallow water provide essential habitat for fish and wildlife that live in or near Minnesota's lakes.  Shoreline habitat consists of aquatic plants, woody plants, and natural lake bottom soils.  Plants in the water and at the water's edge provide habitat, prevent erosion, and absorb excess nutrients.  By leaving a buffer strip of natural vegetation along the shoreline, property owners can reduce erosion, help maintain water quality, and provide habitat and travel corridors for wildlife. <br> \n <br> \n-Prepared by:  Matt Mork (Fisheries Specialist) and Craig Soupir (Area Fisheries Supervisor). <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Populations of black crappie and yellow perch have increased since the last survey in 1984.  Populations are dominated by small fish due to frequent winterkill.  Fish simply do not live long enough to grow large.  Average length of black crappie caught in trapnets was 6.8 inches.  Catch in trapnets averaged 14.4/net and was average for this lake type.  Only age 2 and 3 black crappie were collected indicating poor reproductive success and survival beyond 3 years.  The yellow perch population exhibited similar traits.  Fish were small, averaging 6.3 inches. Abundance was above average (9.5/net) for this lake class.  Catch was dominated by 2 and 3 year-old yellow perch with just one age 4 fish collected.  No fish younger than age 2 occurred indicating a lack of recent reproductive success.     Bluegill have historically occurred in low numbers in Pickerel Lake.  None were collected in 1984 (6 nets).  Just 13 were caught in 1993.  Ages 2-4 were present with an average length of 5.7 inches.     Northern pike were not collected in 1993.  Populations have never been abundant in Pickerel Lake.  In 1984, 7 were caught in trapnets (1.4/net) with an average weight of 2.1 lbs.     Carp and black bullheads have historically dominated the fish population of Pickerel Lake.  An extensive winterkill occurred in February 1993.  This kill may be responsible for a large reduction in trapnet catch rates of both species.  In 1984, an average of 1,524 black bullheads were caught per net (106.5 lbs/net).  Catch in 1993 declined to 45/net (13.9 lbs/net).  Carp abundance also declined from 85/net in 1984 to 44/net in 1993.  Declines in abundance of these species is encouraging.  Conditions for gamefish may improve but populations will still be limited by frequent winterkill.</p>",
