                "narrative": "<p>Holy Water Lake is located in the northwestern corner of Aitkin County approximately 7 miles west of Hill City. The lake is 77 acres in size and has a maximum depth of 56 feet. The lake is completely surrounded by county land and although there is no designated public access on the lake, access can be gained through an unimproved county trail on the east side of the lake.  Because of the lakes unique location it receives little fishing pressure and is surveyed only about once every 15 years. There were ten different fish species documented in the 2005 population assessment.  Game fish sampled included northern pike, yellow perch and sunfish.Since the initial survey in 1973 pike catch rates have varied from 8 to 15 fish per gill net. In 2005 northern pike were caught at a rate of 9.3 fish per gill net lift, which is above the normal range for this type of lake.  The largest northern pike sampled in the survey was 22.5 inches long and the mean length of all pike sampled was 19.7 inches. The 2001 year class of northern pike was the most abundant in the survey. Approximately two thirds of all the pike sampled were 4 years old in 2005.  Nearly 2000 bluegill were caught in eight trap net sets in 2005, which was significant because bluegill were not documented here in two previous surveys.  The average number of bluegill per trap net was 180, which is 9 times what is considered normal for this lake type.  Bluegill up to nine inches were sampled however only 13% were six inches or larger and the average size was only 4.8 inches.  It is suspected that adult spawners were maliciously introduced here in the 1990's and eventually established a population.   Yellow perch, white sucker, pumpkinseed sunfish and brown bullhead are also present in low numbers. Hybrid sunfish are also present.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Holy Water Lake is located in the northwestern corner of Aitkin County approximately 7 miles west of Hill City.  The lake is 77 acres in size and has a maximum depth of 56 feet.  The lake is completely surrounded by county land and although there is no designated public access on the lake, access for small boats or canoes can be gained through a county forest road on the east side of the lake.  Because of the lakes unique location, it receives little fishing pressure and has been surveyed periodically since the initial investigation in1973.  There were 9 different fish species documented in the 2015 standard survey.  Game fish sampled included walleye, northern pike, yellow perch and sunfish.  <br> \n <br> \nIt is thought that adult bluegill sunfish were introduced to the lake by anglers sometime in the mid 1990's and eventually established a population.  No bluegill were observed in the first two surveys conducted on the lake in 1973 and 1988.  The species was first documented in the lake in 2005 during a routine population assessment.  At this point the bluegill population was already suffering from over population as growth rates were found to be below normal and average size was a mere 4.8 inches.  A subsequent survey in 2010 showed similar results and in 2015, bluegill catch rates doubled again to 238/trap net. <br> \n <br> \nBeginning in 2014, walleye fingerlings were stocked in the lake with hopes that they will survive and help offset the overabundance of bluegill and increase the size structure of that population.  It is possibly they may create a fishery as well.  The lake will continue to be stocked with walleye fingerlings in alternate years and an evaluation of the fishery will be conducted again in 2020.  Three juvenile walleye were caught in trap nets in 2015, indicating some survival. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike have been captured in high numbers compared to similar lakes in all of the previous surveys, but the size structure has always been poor.  In 2015, however, (3 of 22) pike sampled were longer than 24\".   This marks the first time in survey history that any pike longer than 24\" have been observed.  The presence of a large-bodied prey item like white suckers suggests there should be potential to produce quality sized predators. Anglers are encouraged to release the larger pike as they often have a positive benefit on the fish community. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch, white sucker, pumpkinseed sunfish, hybrid sunfish, golden shiner and brown bullhead were also present in Holy Water Lake. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Holy Water Lake is located in the northwestern corner of Aitkin County, approximately 7 miles west of Hill City. The lake is 77 acres in size and has a maximum depth of 56 feet. The lake is completely surrounded by county land and although there is no designated public access on the lake, access for small boats or canoes can be gained through a county forest road on the east side of the lake. Because of the lakes unique location, it receives little fishing pressure and has been surveyed periodically since the initial investigation in 1973. There were 8 fish species documented in the 2020 standard survey. Game fish sampled included Walleye, Northern Pike, Yellow Perch, Bluegill and Pumpkinseed Sunfish and their hybrid.  <br> \n <br> \nWhile no Bluegill were observed in the first two surveys conducted on the lake in 1973 and 1988, it is thought that adult Bluegill were introduced to the lake by anglers sometime in the mid-1990's and eventually established a population. The species was first documented in the lake in 2005, during a routine population assessment. At that point, the Bluegill population was already suffering from over-abundance, with growth rates below normal and average size a mere 4.8 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nAs an attempt to reduce the abundance of Bluegill and subsequently improve the size structure, an experimental Walleye fingerling stocking study began in 2014, to see if Walleye predation could be used to decrease the abundance and improve the size structure of Bluegill, and possibly create a Walleye fishery at this unique and out-of-the-way lake. Walleye fingerlings were stocked every other year and surplus fry were also stocked in 2019. The catch rate for Walleye in this survey was 3.7/net (above normal ranges for this lake class) and they ranged in size from 12 to 23.9 inches, with a mean length of 18.7 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nWhile the Walleye introduction appears to have been quite successful, so far, improvements in the Bluegill population appear to have been more subtle. Bluegill abundance decreased significantly from an average of 174/trap net in the previous three surveys, to 50/net in 2020; however, this is still above the expected range for this type of lake. Growth rates for Bluegill were unchanged, however, size structure has improved somewhat. The improvement in size structure stems from the decrease in abundance of small fish, from a 3 year average of 128/trap net for fish under 5 inches to just 31/trap net in 2020. Further improvements may yet be forthcoming and will be monitored with future surveys. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike also decreased in abundance to 5.7/net in 2020, which now falls within the normal range for this type of lake. Pike abundance has been steadily declining since peaking at an excessive 15/net in 1988. The size structure is still not too great, but it has shown some signs of improvement over the last 2 surveys, which were the only surveys to sample fish over 24 inches. In 2020, the average length was 22.8 inches, with 11 of 17 pike within the 22-26 inch protected slot, plus one fish larger than 26 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch, White Sucker, Pumpkinseed Sunfish, Hybrid Sunfish, and Brown Bullhead were also present in Holy Water Lake.  <br> \n <br> \nWith some noticeable improvements in this fishery, anglers are asked to practice selective harvest by releasing larger pike, smaller Walleye, and larger Bluegills. Holy Water Lake is on a path to a substantially improved fishery and assistance from anglers greatly improves the chances for success. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Holy Water Lake is located in the northwestern corner of Aitkin County approximately 7 miles west of Hill City. The lake is 77 acres in size and has a maximum depth of 56 feet. The lake is completely surrounded by county land and although there is no designated public access on the lake, access can be gained through a county forest road on the east side of the lake.  Because of the lakes unique location it receives little fishing pressure and has been surveyed about once every 15 years since 1973. There were ten different fish species documented in the 2005 population assessment.  Game fish sampled included northern pike, yellow perch and sunfish.  <br> \nThe 2005 assessment documented a species that had not previously been found in the lake. Bluegill sunfish were caught in high numbers averaging over 180 individuals per net.  It is suspected that adult spawners were introduced by anglers in the 1990's and eventually established a population. At this point the bluegill population was already suffering from over population as growth rates were found to be below normal and average size was a mere 4.8 inches.  To monitor the status of this new fishery we conducted a special trap net assessment toward the end of May in 2010. Again we found high numbers of slow growing fish (appeared to be even slower than in 2005) at a catch rate of over 100 per net with a mean size of 5 inches.  Twenty percent of the sample was longer than 6 inches in 2010 but it is important to note that the sample was collected 1 month earlier than usual. Thirteen fish out of a sample of 834 measured between 8 and 10 inches in length. Future management activities could include introduction of other predatory species to feed on the now overabundant bluegills. <br> \nNorthern pike, yellow perch, white sucker, pumpkinseed sunfish, hybrid sunfish and brown bullhead are also present in lake. <br> \n</p>",
