                "narrative": "<p>Hanson Lake is a 32-acre lake that lies entirely within the boundaries of the Hubbel Pond Wildlife Management Area in central Becker County.  The lake is surrounded by hardwood forest and grassland.  Submerged and emergent vegetation grows in the nearshore area.  There are no inlets or outlets on the one mile of undeveloped shoreline.  It has been managed as a designated trout lake since 1962.  A standard fisheries survey was completed on Hanson Lake in August 2023 to assess the fish populations. <br> \n <br> \nHanson Lake was chemically treated in 1989 to kill all fish and restart the trout fishery without the presence of undesirable fish.  Rainbow Trout have been stocked annually since 1990, and it is the only species stocked in Hanson Lake by the Department of Natural Resources.  However, unauthorized, illegal fish stocking activity has occurred in Hanson Lake in recent years.  Surveys since 2003 have found White Sucker, Golden Shiner, Largemouth Bass, and Black Crappie to be present in the lake.  In 2023, the Rainbow Trout gill net catch rate was eight per net, just above the historical average (seven trout per net).  Rainbow Trout captured in gill nets ranged in length from ten to 13 inches and averaged 12 inches.  Since their discovery in the lake in 2003, the Golden Shiner abundance has fluctuated.  In 2023, Golden Shiners were abundant in trap nets and gill nets.  The only other species surveyed in 2023 was Black Crappie.  Black Crappie ranged in length from four to ten inches and averaged six inches.</p>",

The boat ramp is located on the south shore.  It has been managed for trout for 50 years.  Lakes with water quality good enough to support trout are not common in western Minnesota and this one is somewhat unique to the area with its scenic, undeveloped shoreline. <br> \n <br> \nThe lake is stocked every fall with 2,500 fingerling-size Rainbow Trout.  With relatively heavy fishing pressure, few survive past age two.  Most of the trout sampled in 2013 were yearlings with an average length of 10.5 inches. <br> \n <br> \nAnother fish species was illegally introduced in Hanson Lake in recent years.  Small Black Crappies were extremely abundant in the 2013 summer study.  While crappies are a desirable species in most other area lakes, they are not in Hanson Lake.  History gives evidence that Hanson Lake functioned very poorly as a bass/panfish lake in the past.  Prior to trout stocking, this lake was rarely fished because panfish populations did not sustain themselves and growth rates were reportedly very poor for these species.  It is not yet known what effect the illegal crappie introduction will have on the trout fishery. <br> \n <br> \nDespite regulations that prohibit the use of live minnows in designated trout lakes, various fish species other than trout have \"found their way\" into Hanson Lake following each of the two previous chemical reclamations-one in 1962 and the other in 1989.  These chemical treatments were necessary to sustain a productive fishery in this lake after it reverted to a stunted bullhead lake.  Anglers are urged to keep minnows and other fish out of Hanson Lake since they may destroy the excellent trout fishery and additional chemical treatments are very expensive.  In addition, anglers need to be aware that taking of any species, including catch and release angling, in designated Trout lakes during the closed stream trout season is prohibited.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Hanson is a 32-acre, designated trout lake located in central Becker County within the boundaries of Hubbel Pond Wildlife Management Area (WMA).  Because Hanson Lake is a designated trout lake, anglers wishing to fish the Lake must possess a trout stamp, in addition to their standard fishing license.  The lake is mesotrophic, undeveloped, and surrounded by hardwood forest and grassland.  The lake has an average water clarity of 13.0 feet and a maximum depth of 29.0 feet.  The lake has no inlets or outlets and has water quality capable of supporting trout, which is unique for western Minnesota.  Hanson Lake has been managed for Rainbow Trout since 1962.  There is a public boat access on the south shore.  <br> \n  <br> \nA standard survey was completed on Hanson Lake in early August 2018 to assess the fish community.  The survey was completed using two gill nets and 10 trap nets.  Rainbow Trout are the primary gamefish species targeted by anglers in this lake. <br> \n <br> \nRainbow Trout abundance in Hanson Lake continues to be low.  The two Rainbow Trout captured in 2018 ranged in length from 11.7 to 12.3 inches and were two years old.  With relatively heavy fishing pressure, few trout survive past age two.  Historically, Rainbow Trout fingerlings were stocked annually every fall since 1963.  Beginning in 2019, it is planned that larger yearling Rainbow Trout will be stocked annually, to potentially increase abundance and angler opportunity. <br> \n <br> \nThe low abundance of Rainbow Trout in Hanson Lake may be attributed to other fish species that have been illegally introduced into the lake.  Black Crappie were first introduced in the early 2000s and are likely negatively affecting the fishery.  Small Black Crappie continue to be abundant in 2018 and averaged 5.8 inches in length.  While Black Crappie are a desirable species in most other area lakes, they are not in Hanson Lake.  Historical evidence indicated Hanson Lake functioned very poorly as a Largemouth Bass and panfish lake.  Prior to Rainbow Trout stocking, this lake was rarely fished because panfish populations could not sustain themselves and growth rates were slow. <br> \n   <br> \nOther fish species that have the potential impact the trout fishery are Golden Shiners and Largemouth Bass.  Golden Shiners were abundant in the 2018 survey and ranged in length from 4.8 to 8.4 inches.  One Largemouth Bass was captured during a survey in 2013, but none were captured in 2018. <br> \n <br> \nDespite the regulations which prohibit the use of live minnows in designated trout lakes, various fish species other than trout have appeared in Hanson Lake following each of the two previous chemical reclamations in 1962 and 1989.  These chemical treatments were necessary to sustain a productive fishery in this lake after it reverted to a stunted bullhead lake.  Anglers are urged to keep minnows and other fish out of Hanson Lake since they may destroy the trout fishery and the potential for additional chemical treatments is unlikely.  In addition, anglers need to be aware that taking of any species, including catch and release angling, in designated trout lakes during the closed stream trout season is prohibited.</p>",

Early documentation suggests that the lake was not only a poor warmwater fish producer, but also was rarelyfished before initial reclamation in 1962.  Rainbow trout were subsequently stocked in 1963 and the lake was given\"designated trout lake\" status at that time.  By the mid-eighties, Hanson Lake had become infested with blackbullheads, white suckers, and various minnow species.       A second chemical rehabilitation was performed in October 1989.  That effort was judged to be successful(100% fish kill) following bio-assay in early 1990 and rainbow trout were again stocked in the lake. Consequently, this fish community assessment is based upon fish stocked in the lake since 1990, three years ago.     The 1993 test netting sample contained mostly yearling fish about 13 inches long and weighing a pound.  Nofish other than rainbow trout were captured, good news considering damage they can do to the trout fishery andthe cost of chemical rehabilitation.     Although Hanson Lake is not considered a \"high pressure\" fishing lake, anglers were witnessed by survey crewsevery day of the study.  Several other anglers reported that they were pleased with the presence of a trout lakein the area and with the quality of fish they were catching.  Some told of catching four or five pound trout,quite possible since some of the post-rehab fish stocked were adults.     The gillnet catch combined with periodic angler reports indicate that Hanson Lake has a successful rainbowtrout fishery maintained by annual fingerling stocking.  The fact that the lake is surrounded by public land,trees, and has no shoreline development also pleases many anglers.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Hanson Lake is a 33 acre designated rainbow trout lake that lies entirely within the boundaries of the Hubbel Pond Wildlife Management Area.  Early documentation suggests that the lake was not only a poor warmwater fish producer, but also was rarely fished before initial reclamation in 1962.  Rainbow trout were subsequently stocked in 1963 and the lake was \"designated\" as a trout lake at that time.  By the mid-1980s, Hanson Lake had become infested with black bullheads, white suckers, and various minnow species.A second chemical rehabilitation was performed in October 1989.  Rainbow trout were stocked the following year and have been stocked annually since then.Anglers reported that fishing has been very good at times and the 1998 test netting data may suggest just how much fishing pressure this small lake has received.  While the numbers of trout in test nets was double that of five years ago, all the fish were yearlings.  The average length of these yearlings was 11.6 inches and the average weight was 0.65 pounds.  Since no trout older than yearlings were captured, it is likely that most trout that reach \"keeper\" size in Hanson Lake are taken home.  It is possible, however, that larger trout simply were not as vulnerable to test nets.It is clear that this small lake has become popular with trout anglers.  In addition to not fishing with or introducing minnows in Hanson Lake, anglers can help maintain or improve fishing quality by releasing a portion of the medium-sized fish they might otherwise have kept.</p>",
