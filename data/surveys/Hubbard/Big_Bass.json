                "narrative": "<p>Big Bass is located three miles northeast of Akeley in Hubbard County.   Big Bass has a surface area of 132 acres and a maximum depth of 60 feet.  There is a state-owned public access located on the south shore of the lake.  Big Bass provides fishing opportunities for Largemouth Bass, Smallmouth Bass, panfish, Northern Pike, and a bonus Walleye population.  Big Bass is known for its exceptional water clarity. <br> \n <br> \nThe Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics.  Big Bass is in lake class 28.  Class 28 lakes have the characteristics of being small bodies of water with a regular shaped shoreline, hard water, and high water clarity.  Other class 28 lakes in the Park Rapids management area include: Emma, Dinner, Gilmore, Indian, Nagel, Thomas, and Williams. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers will find good populations of Largemouth Bass, Smallmouth Bass, and panfish present in Big Bass.  While sampled in low numbers in the 2023 survey, past surveys conducted in the spring with electrofishing gear specifically targeting bass, showed good numbers of Largemouth and Smallmouth Bass in the 12-16 inch size range.  Good water quality, aquatic vegetation, and spawning substrate provides excellent habitat for bass populations in Big Bass.   <br> \n <br> \nAnglers will find good numbers of Bluegill in the 6-8 inch size range.  Black Crappie abundance was up from past surveys with fish in the 9-11 inch size range. Black Crappie populations have fluctuated from low to moderate numbers in past surveys.    <br> \n <br> \nPast and present surveys have shown the Northern Pike population to fluctuate from low to moderate numbers with moderate to quality-sized pike.   <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance was down from past surveys and at the low end of the range typical for this lake class.  Walleye up to 21.8 inches were sampled.   <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch, an important Walleye forage species, were sampled in moderate numbers with fish measured up to 9.0 inches.  Yellow Perch abundance has been low in recent surveys. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled in moderate numbers included Rock Bass and White Sucker.  Yellow Bullhead, Hybrid Sunfish, and Green Sunfish were sampled in low numbers. <br> \n <br> \nCurrently no Aquatic Invasive Species (AIS) have been identified in Big Bass.  To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boats before leaving the access. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Big Bass Lake is a 124 acre lake located northeast of Akeley.  It is noted for having exceptional water clarity, as reflected by the secchi disc reading of 35.0 feet on 6/5/95.Walleye were sampled in high numbers with a gillnet catch of 6.7/net.  Average size of walleye was 15.0 inches and 1.1 lbs, with walleye up to 21.7 inches sampled.  The previous survey in 1990 had a similar gillnet catch of 5.0/net.  However, gillnet catches were much higher in the 1980's: 19.5/gillnet in 1987 and 10.0/gillnet in 1983.  Big Bass Lake is stocked with walleye fingerlings during even calendar years.  The walleye population in Big Bass Lake is maintained through stocking, as evidenced by the fact that all walleye ages sampled correspond to stocked years.Big Bass Lake has a history of having a low northern pike population composed of large-sized fish, and the 1995 survey showed no difference.  Northern pike were sampled in low numbers with a gillnet catch of 1.5/net, while average size was large (25.8 inches and 3.9 lbs).  Northern pike up to 34.7 inches were sampled.  Historical catches and sizes of northern pike have been similar.  Northern pike numbers are low on Big Bass Lake due to limited preferred spawning areas; however, low numbers of pike typically indicate that large-sized fish will be present.Bluegill were sampled in high numbers (100.8/trapnet), and are similar to past survey catches.  Size of bluegills was good, with and average length of 6.5 inches and with 34% of the sample 7.0 inches or larger.  Bluegill up to 8.7 inches were sampled.Evaluation of black crappie and largemouth bass populations is difficult with standard survey gear, usually requiring special sampling gear or sampling times.  However, survey results did show that black crappie were sampled in low numbers 0.2/trapnets, while largemouth bass were sampled in moderate numbers (3.7/trapnet).  Yellow perch were sampled in moderate numbers (9.7/gillnet).  Historical gillnet catches have fluctuated, but are similar to the 1995 catch.  Size was small, with an average length of 7.7 inches and with fish measured up to 10.6 inches.  The yellow perch population provides a forage base for the walleye with a limited fishery to the angler.  Twelve percent of the sample was 9.0 inches or larger.Hybrid sunfish were abundant with a catch of 17.0/trapnet and averaged 6.7 inches in length.  The two previous surveys in 1990 and 1987 had similar trapnet catches.Yellow bullhead were sampled in moderate numbers and were large in size with an average length of 11.2 inches.  Historical catches of yellow bullhead have been higher.Rock bass and white sucker were sampled in moderate numbers.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Big Bass Lake is located three miles northeast of Akeley in Hubbard County.  Big Bass has a surface area of 124 acres and a maximum depth of 60 feet.  Big Bass is a beautiful lake that is known for its exceptional water clarity.  There is a public access located on the south shore of the lake.  Big Bass provides fishing opportunities for walleye, northern pike, largemouth bass, and  panfish.  Due to its small size, Big Bass is susceptible to over-harvest.  Anglers must practice selective harvest if they want to maintain or improve the fishery in Big Bass. The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical and chemical characteristics.  Big Bass is in lake class 28.  Other area lakes in this same classification include Emma, Gilmore, Indian, Nagel, Thomas, and Williams.Walleye abundance (3.0 walleye/gillnet) was down from past surveys, but still at the upper range \"typical\" for this lake class.  The current management goal is 3.0 walleye/gillnet.  Anglers can expect to find all sizes of walleye.  Good numbers of 18-20 inch walleye were sampled as well as fish up to 29 inches.  A successful DNR walleye stocking program is maintaining the walleye population in Big Bass.  Age analysis showed walleye corresponding to stocked years with no or minimal contriution from natural reproduction.  Big Bass is stocked with walleye fingerlings in even numbered years.Northern pike numbers were up (6.6 pike/gillnet) from past surveys.  Past surveys have shown Big Bass to have a low northern pike population, generally below or at the low end of the range \"typical\" for this lake class.  Low numbers of pike typically indicate that large-sized fish will be present.  Big Bass, as well as surrounding lakes, have seen an increase in northern pike numbers in recent years.  Higher than normal lake water levels in Hubbard County in the late 1990's and early 2000's have provided excellent spawning conditions for northern pike.  Northern pike in the 2-3 pound range were common, with a fair number of larger pike (>28.0 inches) present.  Northern pike had good growth rates when compared to other area lakes.Good populations of panfish and largemouth bass are found in Big Bass.  Bluegill in the 7-8 inch range and bass in the 12-15 inch size range are common.  Black cappie are present in low numbers in Big Bass.  Other species sampled inlcude moderate numbers of yellow perch, rock bass, and yellow bullhead.  White sucker, green sunfish, and hybrid sunfish were sampled in low numbers.</p>",

There is a state-owned public access located on the south shore of the lake.  Big Bass provides fishing opportunities for walleye, northern pike, largemouth bass, and panfish.  Big Bass is known for its exceptional water clarity. <br> \n <br> \nThe Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 types based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics.  Big Bass is in lake class 28.  Other area lakes in this same classification include Emma, Gilmore, Indian, Nagel, Thomas, and Williams. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance (3.1 walleye/gillnet) was within the range \"typical\" for this lake class.  Anglers can expect to find walleye in the 14-16 inch size range.  Big Bass is stocked with walleye fingerlings during even numbered years.  Yellow perch, an important forage species for walleye, were sampled at their lowest abundance (1.1/gillnet) for all surveys on Big Bass.  A few perch were an acceptable size for angling.  Northern pike were sampled in moderate numbers (3.6 pike/gillnet), within the range \"typical\" for this lake class.  Past surveys have shown the pike population in Big Bass to fluctuate from low to moderate numbers.  Northern pike in the 2-3 pound range were common, with a fair number of larger pike (> 28.0 inches) present.  Northern pike had good growth rates when compared to other area lakes.  Good populations of panfish and largemouth bass are found in Big Bass.  Bluegill in the 6-8 inch size range and bass in the 12-15 inch size range are common.  Black crappie are present in low numbers, similar to past surveys on Big Bass.  One 15.3 inch smallmouth bass was sampled.  This is the first recorded smallmouth bass sampled on Big Bass. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled include moderate numbers of rock bass, yellow bullhead, and white sucker. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Big Bass Lake is located three miles northeast of Akeley in Hubbard County.  Big Bass has a surface area of 132.5 acres and a maximum depth of 60 feet.  There is a state-owned public access located on the south shore of the lake.  Big Bass provides fishing opportunities for Walleye, Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, Smallmouth Bass, and panfish.  Big Bass is known for its exceptional water clarity. <br> \n <br> \nThe Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 types based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics.  Big Bass is in lake class 28.  Class 28 lakes have the characteristics of being small bodies of water with a regular shaped shoreline, hard water, and high water clarity. Other class 28 lakes in the Park Rapids area include: Dinner, Emma, Gilmore, Indian, Nagel, Newman, Thomas, and Williams. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance (2.6 Walleye/gill net) was within the normal range for this lake class and similar to recent surveys. Decent numbers of Walleye in the 18-20 inch size range were sampled with fish measured up to 24.4 inches.  Yellow Perch, an important Walleye forage species, were not sampled in 2016 and were sampled in very low numbers in the 2009 survey.  Past surveys have shown the Northern Pike population in Big Bass to fluctuate from low to moderate numbers with moderate to quality sized pike.  Northern Pike were sampled in low numbers in 2016, with fish measured up to 31.5 inches.  Good populations of Largemouth Bass, Smallmouth Bass, and panfish are found in Big Bass.  Anglers will find good numbers of bass in the 12-15 inch size.  Largemouth Bass up to 19.1 inches and Smallmouth Bass up to 18.5 inches were sampled.  Bluegill were sampled in moderate numbers, similar to recent surveys.  Anglers will find Bluegill in the 6-7 inch size range.  Black Crappie were not sampled in 2016, but have been sampled in low to moderate numbers in past surveys. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled include Rock Bass, White Sucker, Yellow Bullhead, Hybrid Sunfish, and Green Sunfish. <br> \n <br> \nCurrently, no Aquatic Invasive Species (AIS) have been identified in Big Bass.  To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boats before leaving the access. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Big Bass Lake (29-0032-00) is a 132-acre lake with a maximum depth of 60 feet located northwest of Akeley, MN.  A survey targeting near shore fish species was conducted by Park Rapids Fisheries Staff on 30 June 2017 to assess populations of non-game species and small sport fish.  Ten 100-foot sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake shore, sampling a variety of habitat types. Each site was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot 1/8th-inch mesh seine, depending on habitat condition.   <br> \n <br> \nDuring this assessment, zero sites were sampled with a 50-foot seine and nine were sampled with a 15-foot seine. Site conditions prevented the use of seines at one site. Backpack electrofishing was done at all ten sites, several of which were conducted from the side of the boat.  Nearshore sampling captured several species of fish including two species intolerant of disturbance such as Banded Killifish, and Blacknose Shiner.  Other species sampled during the nearshore effort included Bluegill, Bluntnose Minnow, Green Sunfish, Hybrid sunfish, Iowa Darter, Largemouth Bass, Smallmouth Bass, and Yellow Bullhead. Nearshore catches will be used along with gillnet and trapnet catch data from a survey on 13 June 2017, to calculate a fish-based Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) score which is indicative of the health of Big Bass Lake.   <br> \n <br> \nThis survey is contributing to a watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.  Big Bass Lake is located in the Crow Wing River Watershed.</p>",
