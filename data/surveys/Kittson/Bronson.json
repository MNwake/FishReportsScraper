                "narrative": "<p>The number of walleye in the sample was slightly above average for lakes similar to Lake Bronson.  Even though walleye fingerlings are presently stocked two out of every three years, most of the walleye sampled were the result of natural reproduction.  Walleye in the sample were from five different year classes, and ranged from 7.5 inches to 24.2 inches in length (6.1 pounds). <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike abundance is higher than average for lakes of this type.  Even though the catch rate was twice as high as was documented in 2001, the average size was almost identical (19.9 inches).  The largest pike sampled was 28.4 inches long. <br> \n <br> \nThere is a high quality largemouth bass population, although numbers of adult fish appeared to be low.  We sampled fish up to 18.3 inches in length in the electrofishing assessment, with a mean size of 15.8 inches. <br> \n <br> \nThere is an abundant population of yellow perch in Lake Bronson, with a high-quality size structure.  Almost 75 percent of the yellow perch sampled in gill nets were eight inches or longer.  Twelve percent were over ten inches, and one percent were over 12 inches. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill are present, but at a low abundance.  We sampled a total of two bluegill, both of which were about nine inches long.  As with bluegill, black crappie are present, but in low numbers.  We did sample several young-of-the-year crappie, so they are successfully spawning in the lake.  High yellow perch and black bullhead abundance are likely among the factors limiting recruitment of these species. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Bronson is a 335 acre lake that is located in Lake Bronson State Park, in northwestern Minnesota.  The lake was created when a dam was constructed on the South Branch Two Rivers in 1938.  There is a concrete boat ramp, and a canoe access, along with two fishing piers available within the state park.  Good shore fishing areas are also available to anglers fishing in the state park. <br> \n <br> \nPrimary fisheries management for Lake Bronson is for walleye.  Walleye fingerlings are stocked two out of every three years.   Also, during the last three fisheries surveys, natural reproduction of walleyes was noted to be occurring.  The walleye gill net catch rate was 2.7 per net, with a mean length of 14.7 inches.  Although this is down from the catch rate in 2006, it is within the normal range for lakes similar to Lake Bronson.  Walleye caught in gillnets ranged from 8 inches to 26 inches in length.  Sixty-eight percent of the aged subsample were from the 2008 year class.  Fish from this year class averaged 12 inches in length. <br> \n   <br> \nThe largemouth bass population offers a high-quality fishery.  Largemouth bass sampled during this assessment ranged from 15 to 18 inches in length, and averaged almost 17 inches. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike are one of the most sought-after fish in Lake Bronson.  The catch rate in gill nets for northern pike was 2.1 per net, which is low for lakes similar to Lake Bronson.  The size of fish in the sample ranged from 15 inches to 36 inches, with a mean length of 21 inches. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch numbers continue to be higher than average for lakes similar to Lake Bronson.  Perch up to 11.5 inches were sampled during the 2010 assessment.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Bronson is a 335-acre lake with a maximum depth of 29 feet, an average depth of 12 feet, and two-thirds of it is littoral (shallow weedy areas).  The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical and chemical characteristics.  Lake Bronson belongs to lake class 34.  It is located in lake Bronson State Park, which is in Kittson County, and is in the Two Rivers watershed.  There is a concrete boat ramp and a canoe access on Lake Bronson that are both in the state park.  Lake Bronson was reclamated in the fall of 1992.  The lake was treated with a chemical (rotenone) to kill the existing fish population, which was mostly bullheads, carp, and suckers at the time.  The fish populations are doing well after the initial stocking of walleye, bluegill, yellow perch, and largemouth bass in the spring of 1993.  The survey that this report is based on was done during the summer of 1998.Primary management is for walleye.  Fingerling stocking is done 2 out of every 3 years.  Walleye year classes were produced in 1996 and 1997 through stocking.  Natural reproduction is poor, based on aged fish captured in this assessment.  The walleye population is doing well with higher catch rates than other lakes in the same lake class.  Most walleye are in the 13 to 18 inch range.The northern pike population is also doing very well, with catch rates similar to other lakes in lake class 34.  Average size was approximately 2 pounds, with the largest approaching 10 pounds.  Northern pike have reestablished themselves to the lake from within the watershed, and have good natural reproduction.Yellow perch populations are high, and provide two benefits to the angler.  First, there are good numbers of 7.5 to 10 inch perch that will provide good fishing.  Second, yellow perch are an important food source for walleye and northern pike, and have contributed to the excellent growth rates of walleye.  Yellow perch have good natural reproduction in Lake Bronson.Bluegills haven't reached the numbers that we would have liked, but the average weight (approximately 1/3 pound) of the fish sampled are a quality population.  The seining catch showed good numbers of young of the year bluegill, so the population could still increase in time.  The bluegill population is the only one that has suffered because of the abundant perch population.  Bluegill and yellow perch compete with each other, and the low bluegill population reflects this.Young of the year largemouth bass were abundant in the seining catch.  It looks like they have been naturally reproducing after the initial stocking, and are doing well.Overall, Lake Bronson is doing quite well after the reclamation in 1992.  Future plans are to continue stocking walleye, and to monitor the progression of all the fish populations present. Black crappie stocking is on hold until it can be determined what effects it would have on the fish community.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Bronson is a 335-acre lake with a maximum depth of 29 feet, an average depth of 12 feet, and two-thirds of it is littoral (shallow weedy areas).  The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical and chemical characteristics.  Lake Bronson belongs to lake class 34.  It is located in lake Bronson State Park, which is in Kittson County, and is in the Two Rivers watershed.  There are a concrete boat ramp and a canoe access on Lake Bronson that are both located in the state park.  Lake Bronson was reclaimed in the fall of 1992.  The lake was treated with a chemical (rotenone) to kill the existing fish population, which was mostly bullheads, carp, and suckers.  The fish populations are doing well after the initial stocking of walleye, bluegill, yellow perch, and largemouth bass in the spring of 1993.  The survey that this report is based on was done during the summer of 2001, and is the second assessment done since the reclamation.     Primary management is for walleye.  Catch rates were low, and the majority of the fish caught were young of the year.  Fingerling stocking is done two out of every three years.  In the fall of 2001 there were 23,500 fingerlings stocked.  Natural reproduction was documented for the first time, so along with the stocking there should be a strong year class in 2001.     The northern pike population is doing well, with catch rates similar to other lakes in lake class 34.  Average size was approximately 2 pounds, with the largest one more than 12 pounds.  Northern pike have reestablished themselves to the lake from within the watershed, and have good natural reproduction.     Yellow perch populations are high, and provide two benefits to the angler.  First, there are good numbers of 8 to 12 inch perch that will provide good fishing.  Second, yellow perch are an important food source for walleye and northern pike, and have contributed to the excellent growth rates of walleye.  Yellow perch have good natural reproduction in Lake Bronson.     Bluegills haven't reached the numbers that we would have liked, but the average weight (1/2 pound) of the fish sampled are a quality population.   The bluegill population is the only one that has suffered because of the abundant perch population.  Bluegill and yellow perch compete with each other, and the low bluegill population reflects this.  Also the high numbers of bullheads preying on young of the year bluegill and other species, making it hard for them to reproduce successfully.      Overall, Lake Bronson is still doing well after the reclamation in 1992.  Fishing pressure is high in the summer, and there were 140 fish houses on on the lake this year.  Future plans are to continue stocking walleye, and to monitor the progress of all the fish populations present.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Walleye <br> \n <br> \n\tWalleye is listed as the primary management species for Lake Bronson and have been stocked regularly since 1945. The most recent population assessment indicates a healthy naturally-reproducing population inhabits Lake Bronson with over five year-classes present. Walleye gill net catch rates were 3.0 per net and are within the normal range for lakes similar to Lake Bronson. The average length of walleye sampled in 2013 was 17 inches weighing 1.9lbs Walleye length ranges from 12 inches to 22 inches. Good growth rates of walleye in Lake Bronson will provide anglers an opportunity to catch quality-sized fish. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie <br> \n <br> \n\tThe 2013 population assessment indicates that black crappie abundance is above average for lakes of similar characteristics. Average length of black crappie sampled in 2013 was over 9 inches, and ranged from 7 inches up to 13 inches. Age analysis indicates a strong year-class was produced in 2010. Black crappie abundance tends to fluctuate often having one year-class dominating the population. Fall electrofishing in 2013 noted a high abundance of YOY black crappie. When conditions are suitable strong year-classes should continue and contribute to a fishable population in the future. <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike <br> \n <br> \n\tNorthern pike is one of the most sought after fish in Lake Bronson and of management concern. Catch rates of northern pike appear to be on a decline; however, average size of fish appears to be increasing. Northern pike length ranged from 14 inches to fish up to 34 inches with an average size of 21 inches. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch <br> \n <br> \n\tAs found historically, there is a high abundance of yellow perch in Lake Bronson. Average length of yellow perch sampled in 2013 was 7.5 inches and length ranged from 5 inches up to 10.5 inches. A good size structure of yellow perch should produce quality perch fishing, with perch attaining lengths of 11 inches. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass <br> \n <br> \n\tHistorically, largemouth bass have been present in Lake Bronson at low abundance. From the 2013 electrofishing survey, only five largemouth bass were sampled. Average length was 16.5 inches and ranged from 15 inches to 18 inches. Anglers should continue to expect low numbers of quality-sized largemouth bass in Lake Bronson.  <br> \n <br> \n\tOverall, Lake Bronson provides park visitors a unique angling opportunity in a landscape devoid of fishable lakes. Lake surveys suggest healthy populations of desirable games species exist in Lake Bronson and of quality size. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Bronson, in Kittson County, is a 335-acre reservoir located approximately 1.5 miles southwest of the city of Lake Bronson in northwestern Minnesota. Lake Bronson is part of the Two Rivers watershed, and was created in 1936 by damming the South Branch of the Two Rivers. Lake Bronson is located within Lake Bronson State Park and is the only fishing lake in Kittson County. There is a concrete boat ramp, canoe access, and two fishing piers available within the state park. <br> \n\tWalleye is the primary species of management interest for Lake Bronson and have been stocked regularly since 1945. A population assessment in 2019 indicates a healthy population of Walleye inhabits Lake Bronson with a range of ages and sizes present. The Walleye gill net catch rate of 5.33 fish per net was higher than average for lakes similar to Lake Bronson. Walleyes sampled from ten age-classes ranged in age from 1 to 15 years old.   The average Walleye sampled in 2019 was approximately 13 inches long and weighed slightly over one pound. The largest Walleye sampled in 2019 was 26.5 inches long. The variety of sizes and good catch rates indicate a healthy population that will provide anglers opportunities to catch numbers and quality size Walleyes. <br> \n\tThe Black Crappie trap net catch rate was 0.9 fish per net in 2019 and is down from both 2016 and 2013 (1.7 and 8.4 fish per net respectively) and is on the low end of the normal range for lakes similar to Lake Bronson. Average length of Black Crappie was slightly over five inches with the largest individual being approximately 13 inches. Age analysis indicated that over 50% of the sampled were from the 2018 year-class. Black Crappie abundance often fluctuates, and is commonly dominated by one or two year-classes. In Lake Bronson, a self-sustaining population exists and when environmental conditions are optimal, strong year-classes contribute to a fishable population. Currently the majority of Black Crappie are small, but there are larger individuals in the population. These smaller individuals should begin to contribute to the fishery in the next year or two. <br> \n\tNorthern Pike gillnet catch rate is up compared to the 2013 and 2016 surveys and are on the high end of normal for similar lakes. Catch rates in 2019 were 5.4 fish per net, with an average length of approximately 22 inches. The largest Northern Pike sampled was almost 29 inches long. <br> \n\tYellow Perch gillnet catch rate was 59 fish per net; an increase from 2016 (24 fish per net). Average Yellow Perch length was approximately seven inches and ranged from 4 inches to 10.5 inches. Approximately 17% of the Yellow Perch sampled in gillnets were eight inches or greater which is down from previous surveys. Though the proportion of Yellow Perch over eight inches is down, there are still catchable size Yellow Perch which should continue to provide additional action for anglers. Smaller yellow perch were also observed in other gear and are an important food source for other fishes such as Walleye and Northern Pike. <br> \nOther species are also present and provide some angling opportunity. Low numbers of Bluegills up to 9.5 inches and Pumpkinseed Sunfish up to seven inches were observed during the survey. Largemouth Bass were also present with an average weight of 2.8 pounds.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Bronson, in Kittson County, is a 335-acre reservoir located approximately 1.5 miles southwest of the city of Lake Bronson in northwestern Minnesota. Lake Bronson is part of the Two Rivers watershed, and was created in 1936 by damming the South Branch of the Two Rivers. Lake Bronson is located within Lake Bronson State Park and is the only fishing lake in Kittson County. There is a concrete boat ramp, canoe access, and two fishing piers available within the state park. <br> \n\tWalleye is the primary species of management interest for Lake Bronson and have been stocked regularly since 1945. A population assessment in 2022 indicates a healthy population of Walleye inhabits Lake Bronson with a range of ages and sizes present. The Walleye gill net catch rate of 4.78 fish per net was down slightly from 2019 and better than average for lakes similar to Lake Bronson. Walleyes sampled from nine age-classes ranged in age from 1 to 14 years old.   The average Walleye sampled in 2022 was approximately 15 inches long and weighed just under two pounds. The largest Walleye sampled in 2022 was just over 24 inches long. The variety of sizes and good catch rates indicate a healthy population that will provide anglers opportunities to catch numbers and quality size Walleyes. <br> \n\tThe Black Crappie trap net catch rate was 2.22 fish per net in 2022 which is up from 2016 and 2019 and is about a fish per net less than average for lakes similar to Lake Bronson. Average length of Black Crappie was slightly under 12 inches with the largest individual being approximately 15 inches. Four year old crappies from the 2018 year class dominate the fishable population and are of excellent size for anglers to target right now. Additionally, a very strong 2021 year class appears to be coming, which would only serve to enhance the Black Crappie fishery at Lake Bronson in the near future. <br> \n\tNorthern Pike gillnet catch rate is up slightly from 2019 and is on the high end of normal for similar lakes. Catch rates in 2019 were 5.9 fish per net, with an average length of approximately 20 inches. This is down slightly from recent surveys, although catch rates of protected slot fish and fish above the slot were similar to previous years. The largest Northern Pike sampled was just over 30 inches long. <br> \n\tYellow Perch gillnet catch rate was 27 fish per net, which is a decrease from 2019. Average Yellow Perch length was approximately seven and a half inches and ranged from four to eleven inches. Approximately 44% of the Yellow Perch sampled in gillnets were eight inches or greater which is within the normal ranger for Lake Bronson and higher than 2019. There are plenty of catchable size Yellow Perch which should continue to provide additional action for anglers. Smaller yellow perch were also observed in other gear and are an important food source for other fishes such as Walleye and Northern Pike. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>\tLake Bronson, in Kittson County, is a 335-acre reservoir located approximately 1.5 miles SW of the city of Lake Bronson in northwestern Minnesota. Lake Bronson is part of the Two Rivers watershed, and was created in 1936 by damming the South Branch of the Two Rivers. Lake Bronson is located within Lake Bronson state park and is the only fishing lake in Kittson County. There is a concrete boat ramp, canoe access, and two fishing piers available within the state park. <br> \n\tWalleye is the primary species of management interest for Lake Bronson and have been stocked regularly since 1945. A population assessment in 2016 indicates a healthy population of Walleye inhabits Lake Bronson with eight year-classes present. Walleye gill net catch rates were 2.78 per lift and are within the normal range for lakes similar to Lake Bronson. The average length of Walleye sampled in 2016 was 16.4 inches, weighing 1.8 pounds on average. The largest Walleye sampled in 2016 was 24.7 inches long. Walleye have good growth rates in Lake Bronson and will provide anglers the opportunity to catch quality-sized fish. <br> \n\tBlack Crappie trap net catch rates were 1.6 fish per lift in 2016 and are down from 2013 (8.4 fish per lift) but within the normal range for lakes similar to Lake Bronson. Average length of Black Crappie was 9.8 inches, with the largest individual being 12.6 inches. Age analysis indicated that over 50% of the sampled were of the 2013 year-class. Black Crappie abundance often fluctuates, and is common to be dominated by one or two year-classes. In Lake Bronson, a self-sustaining population is in place and when environmental conditions are optimal, strong year-classes will contribute to a fishable population. <br> \n\tSince 2006, Northern Pike gill net catch rates have remained below 3.0 fish per lift, while the overall size structure continues to improve. Catch rates in 2016 were 2.3 fish per lift, with an average length of 21 inches. The largest Northern Pike sampled was 26.8 inches in length. <br> \n\tYellow Perch catch rates were 24.0 fish per lift; a decrease from 2013 (50.8 fish per lift). Average Yellow Perch length was 7.7 inches and ranged from 5.1 inches to 10.4 inches. Over 40% of the Yellow Perch sampled were 8 inches or greater and should provide plenty of action for perch anglers. Lastly, numerous Yellow Perch were sampled ranging from 2.5 to 3 inches that should contribute to the fishery as prey for Walleye and Northern Pike. <br> \n</p>",
