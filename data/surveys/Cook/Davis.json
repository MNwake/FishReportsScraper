                "narrative": "<p>A temperature-dissolved oxygen profile was collected in the deepest basin on Davis Lake on August 24th, 2023 to evaluate the amount of cold, oxygenated water (i.e., oxythermal habitat) available to Lake Trout. Based on the profile, the top of the thermocline (i.e., the location in the water column with the sharpest transition from warm to cold water) occurred at approximately 13 feet. Dissolved oxygen decreased to below 3.0 mg/L at 71.1 feet, which was below the thermocline, at the time of sampling. The temperature at which dissolved oxygen decreased to below 3.0 mg/L (i.e., TDO3, a single variable to characterize oxythermal habitat) was 4.9?C (10.8?F). <br> \n <br> \nTDO3 values cooler than 8.8?C indicate that oxythermal conditions are favorable for Lake Trout. Dissolved oxygen concentrations below the thermocline indicate that suitable oxythermal habitat for these species was available across a range of depths at the time of sampling. Data collected in 1982 further indicates suitable oxythermal habitat across years. When adequate oxythermal habitat is available, Lake Trout are not squeezed into unfavorable, warmer water conditions and therefore do not experience higher levels of stress. <br> \n</p>",
