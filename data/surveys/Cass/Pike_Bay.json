                "narrative": "<p>Pike Bay Lake is located just southeast of the City of Cass Lake in northwestern Cass County.  It is a 4,760 acre lake with a 95 foot maximum depth.  There is a U.S. Forest Service (USFS) public access on the south side of the lake at the South Shore Campground, just off of Pike Bay Loop Road.  A second USFS boat ramp on the northeast side of the lake is adequate for smaller rigs, but it tends to be very shallow at most lake levels.  Pike Bay is also frequently accessed from Cass Lake by boat through the creek channel that connects the two lakes.  Pike Bay supports a very limited amount of residential development along its lakeshore, including one resort and a campground.  A large, beautiful lake, Pike Bay lies within the boundaries of both the Chippewa National Forest and the Leech Lake Indian Reservation.  Leech Lake tribal code allows band members to harvest fish through subsistence netting or by other means of harvest.  The DNR manages the lake for walleye, northern pike, muskellunge, and yellow perch. <br> \n <br> \nThe outlet of Pike Bay flows north under U.S. Highway 2 and into Cass Lake through a short section of stream channel.  Water levels in the Cass Lake system are influenced by the operation of Knutson Dam, located on the Mississippi River at the outlet of Cass Lake.  Typical of reservoir operations, water levels are drawn down through the fall and winter in anticipation of annual run-off.  As water levels rise in spring, lake basins of both Pike Bay and Cass Lake fill simultaneously, temporarily altering flow patterns between the two lakes.  This unusual flow pattern could affect the normal interchange of fish between lakes.  It is unknown how this phenomenon affects the walleye population in Pike Bay, but that population does appear to function separately from the rest of the Cass Lake Chain.   <br> \n <br> \nThe Pike Bay walleye population has a long history of poor natural recruitment and has been maintained by both fry and fingerling stocking.  Stocking has been done cooperatively by the Leech Lake Band of Ojibwe and MNDNR.  Fingerling stocking intensity was increased recently, and an evaluation is currently in progress. <br> \n <br> \nThe 2009 assessment showed no measurable difference in walleye abundance from the previous assessment in 2004.  With the exception of a single assessment in 1999, gill net catch has never been greater than in the past two assessments.  Walleye captured in 2009 ranged from 7 to 27 inches in length and were represented by ten different year classes.  Growth rates are above average.  At age-3, an average Pike Bay walleye is 12.6 inches long which is greater than the Bemidji area lake class mean value of 11.6 inches. <br> \n <br> \nThe northern pike population appears to be very stable in Pike Bay, as indicated by the 2009 gill net catch rate which was similar to that of the previous nine assessments.  Northern pike from the 2009 sample ranged from 12 to 36 inches in length.  Seven different year classes were identified, with age-2 and age-3 fish comprising 72% of the sample. <br> \n <br> \nA single muskellunge was captured in the 2009 assessment, and only seven muskellunge have been captured in all population assessments combined.  Standard population assessments are a poor indicator of muskellunge abundance, but Pike Bay is known to be an excellent muskellunge fishery.  Angler reports and tournament information confirm that anglers do target muskellunge in Pike Bay with success.  Anglers should remember that muskellunge harvest restrictions on Pike Bay now fall under the statewide 48 inch minimum length regulation. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch abundance over the past nine assessments has been better than what is considered typical for this type of lake.  Recruitment appears to be consistently good, indicated by the 2009 yellow perch sample which exhibited a wide range of lengths, with twenty-five percent greater than eight inches.  Other common prey species captured at above average abundance levels were white sucker and tullibee (cisco). It does not appear that forage availability is limiting predator populations in Pike Bay. <br> \n <br> \nIn 2009, standard lake survey trap nets were utilized for the first time since 1994.  Bluegill abundance was fairly low, and fish ranged from 4.5 to 9.5 inches in length.  Bluegill recruitment appears to be inconsistent, as 89% of the trap net sample was represented by a single year class produced in 2006.  Rock bass was the most abundant sunfish species in the 2009 assessment; fish up to nearly 11 inches in length were captured. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers and other lake users should be aware of their role in preventing the spread of invasive species.  Invasive species are plants and animals that have been introduced through human activities to a location where they do not naturally occur.  Non-native species are not necessarily harmful, but when they cause ecological or economic problems, they are categorized as \"invasive.\"  Minnesota's aquatic resources are threatened by a variety of aquatic invasive species. These species have a high risk of continued spread, as they are easily established and can be unknowingly transported from lake to lake by human activity. The movement of any type of equipment (boats, boat trailers, boat lifts, docks, personal watercraft, bait containers, etc.) between lakes risks potential invasive species transfer if precautions are not taken. To avoid being an accomplice to the spread of these unwanted species, people should make sure all equipment is thoroughly cleaned and dried before entering new waters. Items that are difficult to dry (livewells, baitwells, bilge areas, etc.) should be treated with scalding water or a small amount of iodine or chlorine bleach solution to kill any organisms that may be hiding there.

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of the nearshore fish community was conducted on August 5, 2019 by Fisheries Lake IBI program staff.  Nearshore sampling stations were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at 24   stations, with one station being sampled backpack electrofished from boat due to site conditions. A 50-foot seine was used to sample 20 stations, a 15-foot seine was used at three stations, and one station's conditions prevented the use of a seine. The nearshore sampling captured 29 native fish species including 11 species (Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Burbot, Iowa Darter, Logperch, Longnose Dace, Mimic Shiner, Mottled Sculpin, Muskellunge, and Rock Bass) intolerant of habitat disturbance and three species (Black Bullhead, Fathead Minnow, and Green Sunfish) that are tolerant of disturbance.  <br> \n <br> \nData from this targeted nearshore survey and trap net survey is combined with data from a standard trap net and gill netting survey to calculate a Fish-based Index of Biological Integrity (FIBI) score that describes the overall health of the lake. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment. The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. The FIBI score for Pike Bay Lake based on this survey is exceptionally high, and well above the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes.   <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Mississippi River - Headwaters Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Pike Bay is a Class 22 lake and is compared with Cass (Pike Bay and Cass Lake are connected by a short channel), Bemidji and Plantaganette lakes in the Bemidji area.  Lakes of this class are generally large, deep,and have a regular shoreline.  There are 70 lakes of this class disbursed around the state.  Primarymanagement is for walleye with secondary management of northern pike, yellow perch and muskellunge.Walleye were sampled at near average abundance for this lake class.  About 70 percent of the walleye sampled were greater than 15 inches in length with the largest at over 25 inches in length.  Most walleye sampled have come from year classes when walleye fingerlings have been stocked.  Walleye have been stocked by joint effort of the MN DNR and Leech Lake reservation fisheries.Northern pike were sampled in below average numbers but the size is well over average.  The largest pike sampled was 36 inches in length and the average length was about 24 inches. There is good size distribution. Northern pike spawning areas around the lake have not been used since 1988 but recruitment has remained constant.Yellow perch are abundant and have produced an avid winter fishery.  The average length is 7.1 inches and about a fourth of the perch are greater than 8\" in length.  Rock bass are also found in higher than average numbers with an average weight of about 0.5 pounds.Bluegill, pumpkinseed, black crappie, and largemouth bass are all found in the lake but the population of each is low.Whitefish and tullibee are netted by reservation members and may provide a limited angling opportunity.  No whitefish were sampled but tullibee are found in average numbers.  About half the tullibees had the parasite Triaenophorus.Muskellunge are found in the lake and a good fishable population exists, but most fishing for them is probably in adjacent Cass Lake. Black, brown and yellow bullhead are present but uncommon.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Pike Bay is a 4760-acre lake with a maximum depth of 95 feet located adjacent to the community of Cass Lake in northern Cass County.  There are two public accesses maintained by the United States Forest Service.  On the south end of the lake is the South Pike Bay Campground which has a concrete access.  On the east side of the lake at the Ojibway Beach Campground, there is a steel ramp.  Pike Bay is also frequently accessed by boat from Cass Lake via the channel connecting both lakes.The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different lake classes based on physical and chemical characteristics.  Pike Bay is in lake class 22.  Other Bemidji area lakes in the same lake class include Bemidji, Cass and Plantaganette Lakes.  Typically lakes in this class are very large, very deep, clear and are harwater lakes.Pike Bay is within both the Chippewa National Forest and the Leech Lake Indian Reservation.  Leech Lake tribal code allows band members to harvest fish through subsistence netting or by other means of harvest.  The DNR manages the lake for walleye, northern pike, muskellunge and yellow perch.Walleye fingerling have been stocked on alternating years.  Fish are stocked cooperatively between the MN DNR and Leech Lake Division of Resource Management and have exceeded 1,000 pounds of fingerlings each stocking since 1989.  The 2004 walleye abundance rating declined from the 1999 findings but is still comparable to other class 22 lakes.  The 2004 average length of walleye sampled was 16.6 inches and was up from 1999 (14.4 inches).  Anglers can expect to catch numbers of walleye that are 13-15 and 19-21 inches long.The 2004 northern pike abundance rating was the highest of any survey conducted on Pike Bay and was comparable to the upper limit for class 22 lakes.  Both mean length and weight were down slightly from 1999.  Age data indicates that there is consistent natural reproduction with pike from ages 1-5 sampled.  Anglers can expect to catch numbers of pike in the 20-25 inch range.Standard population assessments are a poor indicator of muskellunge abundance, but Pike Bay is known to be an excellent muskellunge fishery.  It is a popular destination for muskie anglers and is known to produce very large fish.  No special sampling has been conducted specifically for this species.Yellow perch abundance in 2004 was the lowest recorded since 1971 but is still more than twice what you would normally find in a class 22 lake.  Yellow perch are valuable both as food for predator fish such as northern pike and walleye and as a recreational fish for anglers.  The mean weight in 2004 (0.22 pound) was the highest recorded since 1971 (0.23).  In 2004 almost 15% of yellow perch were nine inches or greater in length compared to only 2% in 1999.White sucker are present and provide an abundant forage fish for the larger predators like muskellunge and northern pike.  Cisco (tullibee) were also sampled in low numbers but is also an important forage species.Sampling gear that would be used to sample panfish such as bluegill and black crappie were not employed in 2004 because of historically low catch rates for these species.  However, anglers often report high catch rates of rock bass.  Bluegill and largemouth bass are also caught by anglers on occasion.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Pike Bay is very popular destination fishery for anglers in the upper Midwest.  With a surface area around 4,800 acres, there is plenty of area and structure to fish away from the regular crowds.  Pike Bay has a maximum depth around 95 feet with oxygenated water down to over 30 feet, even in late summer, creating a refuge for cool water species such as Cisco (tullibee), Lake Whitefish, and Burbot (eelpout).  While Walleye is the most popular species sought on the lake, large northerns, perch, and muskies are also popular gamefish.   <br> \n <br> \nPike Bay is stocked with Walleye fry every spring and annual fall electrofishing assessments are performed in the fall to monitor stocking success.  Though muskies are not stocked in Pike Bay, a resident population exists from the connectivity with Cass Lake through a navigable channel about half a mile in length on the northwest side of the lake.  Anglers can access Pike Bay from Cass Lake through the channel, or two public accesses maintained by the U.S. Forest Service.  The main access is located on the south shore, next to the South Pike Bay Campground.  The access has room for 5 trucks with trailers and the campground has 23 sites, some with direct lake access.  The second public access on the east side at Ojibway Beach is rarely maintained.  A winter access from the city park in Cass Lake is available intermittently based on snow and ice conditions. <br> \n <br> \nA gillnet assessment was conducted on Pike Bay at the end of August, 2015 to evaluate a recent change from fingerling stocking to fry stocking in 2011.  A total of 15 nets were set over four nights for 24 hours each.   <br> \n <br> \nThe Walleye population is doing well and some of the initial fry stockings appear to be successful.  Gillnet catch rates were a little above the long term average at 6.1 fish/net.  Fish up to 27.7 inches in length were captured, with an average size of just over 15 inches per fish.  Multiple strong year classes are present, most notably the 2013 and 2014 fry stocked year classes which should grow to catchable sizes in a few years.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike in Pike Bay are at lower densities (4.9 fish/gillnet) than most lakes in the area enabling them to reach larger sizes.  The largest pike captured during the assessment was 35.4 inches long but much larger pike have been reported.   <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch are very abundant in Pike Bay.  Perch with lengths up to 10.6 inches were observed. The high density (106.9 fish/gillnet) is beneficial to Pike Bay because perch are a primary food source for the majority of predator fish.  Abundant perch also means less predation on young Walleyes. <br> \n <br> \nCisco (tullibee), Lake Whitefish, and Burbot (eelpout) were also captured but in very small numbers.  However, low catch rates for these particular species are not necessarily an indication of a small population.  Just being present in the catch is an indicator that those species are doing well.  Like perch, tullibee and whitefish are an important food source for larger species like Northern Pike, Walleye, and Muskellunge (not observed in this assessment) and allow growth to trophy sizes. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Pike Bay Lake is a 4,751-acre lake located in northwestern Cass County, within the Chippewa National Forest and the Leech Lake Indian Reservation.  The lake has a maximum depth of 95 feet and a mean water clarity reading of 12 feet.  The surrounding watershed is conifer and mixed hardwood forest.  Pike Bay has two inlets and an outlet that flows north into Cass Lake.  Pike Bay is connected to the Cass Lake chain of lakes (Andrusia, Big Rice, Big Wolf, Cass, Kitchi, and Little Rice) by the Mississippi and Turtle rivers and influence water levels on Pike Bay.  The outlet from Pike Bay into Cass Lake is a short section of stream channel, which allows for boat and fish passage between both lakes.  There is a U.S. Forest Service (USFS) public access at the South Shore Campground, just off of Pike Bay Loop Road.  A second USFS boat ramp on the northeast side of the lake is adequate for smaller rigs, but it tends to be very shallow at most lake levels. <br> \n <br> \nThe primary gamefish species targeted by anglers include Walleye, Northern Pike, Muskellunge, and Yellow Perch.  A standard survey was completed on Pike Bay in 2019 to assess the fish community. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance increased in 2019 and was above average for the lake.  Walleye sizes ranged from about 10 inches to over 26 inches in length, and averaged around 15 inches.  The Walleye population is healthy with multiple year classes of fish.  Due to inconsistent natural reproduction for Walleye, Pike Bay is stocked each year with Walleye fry. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike abundance has remained consistent in recent surveys.  Northern Pike lengths ranged from 13 to 33 inches and averaged 24 inches.  Northern Pike averaged just over 3 pounds with 64% of the Northern Pike being greater than 22 inches in length.  Age and catch data indicate that the 2015 and 2016 year classes are abundant and should provide good fishing. <br> \n <br> \nOne Muskellunge with a length of 27 inches was caught in a gill net.  Muskellunge have been captured in previous population assessments; however, these standard surveys are not good indicators of population abundance.  Pike Bay has a low density, naturally reproducing Muskellunge population.  The Cass Lake chain of lakes is known for its naturally reproducing Muskellunge and good musky fishing in general. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch abundance was below average for the lake but is still considered high compared to similar lakes in the area.  Yellow Perch total lengths ranged from 4 to 12 inches with 24% of the population larger than 9 inches.  Pike Bay is a known Yellow Perch fishery in the Bemidji area and should continue to provide anglers the opportunity to catch harvestable sized fish. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill were low in abundance, which is typical for the lake.  Bluegill total lengths ranged from less than 4 to nearly 10 inches.  Bluegill were fast growing and averaged just over 7 inches in length.  Multiple year classes were sampled, indicating consistent reproduction. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled during the survey included Black Crappie, Bowfin (dogfish), Brown Bullhead, Burbot, Common Shiner, hybrid sunfish, Largemouth Bass, Pumpkinseed, Rock Bass, Tullibee (Cisco), White Sucker, and Yellow Bullhead. <br> \n <br> \nPike Bay is infested with Zebra Mussel and Rusty Crayfish and caution should be used when you enter and leave the lake.  Aquatic invasive species (AIS) can be transferred from infested to non-infested waterbodies by anglers, boats, and lake shore owners.  Please follow current AIS regulations to avoid spreading these unwanted species to other lakes, which could negatively impact their aquatic communities. <br> \n</p>",

This survey was the first conducted on an expedited 3-year rotation since Pike Bay was selected for inclusion in a statewide study of zebra mussel effects on Walleye populations (2021).   Pike Bay was listed as infested with zebra mussels in 2014 and with the exception of 2020 (Covid year) Pike Bay has been stocked annually with Walleye fry at the rate of 1,000 fry per littoral acre (2,238,000 fry).  This was the third gill net survey conducted on Pike Bay since the switch to fry stocking in 2013.   <br> \n <br> \nA total of 78 Walleye were captured resulting in a CPUE of 5.2/GN which was down considerably from 9.4/GN in the previous survey (2019).  Despite the decline in abundance, the 2022 CPUE is still higher than all but two of eleven surveys conducted during the years of fingerling and mixed-life stage stockings.   <br> \n <br> \nWalleye captured ranged in length from 11.2 inches to 26.0 inches with a mean length of 17.4 inches and mean weight of 1.9 lbs/fish.  Otoliths were used to assign ages to all gill net-caught Walleye.  A total of ten year classes were identified with seven consecutive from age-3 (2019) to age-9 (2013).  The 2019 year class was the most abundant cohort identified, comprising 39% of the catch.   <br> \n <br> \nBack-calculated lengths for Walleye ages 1 through 8 and mean annual increments of back-calculated lengths were derived using scale samples.  Mean back calculated lengths were considerably greater for Walleye ages 1 through 5 compared to 2019, with a mean length of 16.5 inches compared to 15.6 inches at age-5 in 2019.   <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Pike Bay is connected to Cass Lake by a narrow, slow flowing channel.  Depending on water conditions, water movement can go either way between the lakes.  The railroad bridge over the creek is low so larger boats may not be able to traverse between the lakes.  There are two improved public accesses on the lake, both maintained by the USFS.  A campground and swimming beach are adjacent to the south access.  Leech Lake tribal code allows band members to harvest fish through subsistence netting or by other means of harvest.Primary fish management for Pike Bay is walleye with secondary species listed as northern pike, yellow perch and muskellunge.  Walleye fingerlings are stocked during alternate years with a minimal quota of 1,000 pounds.  Fish are stocked cooperatively between the MN DNR and Leech Lake Natural Resources and have exceeded the 1,000 pounds each stocking since 1989.  An addendum in 2000 increased the quota to 2,000 pounds of fingerlings during alternate years.The 1999 assessment captured walleye at 11.1/GN which is more than double any previous catch rate and well above the average of similar lakes.  The average weight is 1.1 pounds which was the lowest average weight recorded over six assessments since 1957.  The average length sampled was 15.4 inches with the largest at 20.9 inches.  The parasite Neascus (black spot) was found on some walleye but does not pose a problem for human consumption.Northern pike were sampled at 4.1/GN which is slightly above the 1994 rate of 3.1/GN but still similar to other lakes in class 22.  The average length of pike sampled was 22.9 inches and the largest was 30.6 inches.Yellow perch have provided a good fishery especially during the winter months.  However, the average length and weight have declined over the assessment history.  The average length in 1999 was 7.1 inches, and only 11% of the perch were more than 8 inches long.  In the 1994 assessment, 21% were greater than 8 inches.Panfish, including bluegill, pumpkinseed sunfish and crappie, are present but their abundance is low.  Rock bass are common, and a few largemouth bass have been sampled.  Lake whitefish, tullibee, and white suckers are common but are primarily forage for the walleye, northern pike and muskellunge populations.Though muskellunge were not sampled during this assessment, they are present and provide another angling opportunity.</p>",
