                "narrative": "<p>Largemouth bass and black crappie net catches indicate above average populations. Net catches were above the third quartile of the Brainerd area lakes that are smaller than 230 acres and have a total alkalinity of less than 47.6 ppm. Northern pike, pumpkinseed, bluegill and yellow perch net catches indicate a normal or average population, since net catches fell between the first and third quartile of the Brainerd area median for this lake type. Yellow bullhead abundance is low with net catches below the first quartile of the Brainerd area median. The northern pike population has shown a drastic decline (3.5/gillnet in 1987) when compared to the average of 17.5/gillnet during the past two surveys. The population is still in good shape and is represented by year classes 1-4 with annulus 2 and 3 showing a fast growth rate, and 1 and 4 an average growth rate when compared to the statewide averages. A length-frequency of 20.0 to 27.9 inches exists with a median size of 24.5 inches long and 3.5 lbs in weight. The yellow bullhead net catch was moderate in the trapnet, but an all-time high in the gillnets (65.0/net) having a mean weight of 0.32 lbs. The bluegill population had a significant decline from 1984 to 1987. The mean weight has changed little since the 1984 survey. In 1987 year classes 2 thru 5 showed a normal growth rate in comparison to statewide averages. The largemouth bass net catches (gillnet and trapnet) indicate a tremendous increase in bass abundance for 3 year old and younger fish. Year classes 1 thru 3 were present in the nets. Three year classes exhibited a normal growth rate. Black crappie in 1987 upheld its record of usually indicating an extremely high population (20.2/trapnet in 1987). Length frequency was 4.0 to 9.4 inches long with a median size of 8.2 in. long and a median weight of 0.3 lbs. Yellow perch abundance was moderate, but net catch rates were below the catch rates of the past two surveys.</p>",
