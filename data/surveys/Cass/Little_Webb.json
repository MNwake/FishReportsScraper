                "narrative": "<p>Minnesota DNR Fisheries IBI program staff conducted an assessment of lakeshore habitat on Little Webb Lake on June 22 2020, following the Score the Shore survey protocols. The assessment consisted of 35 survey sites evenly spaced 150 meters around the lake. Assessments were made in three habitat zones: Shoreline Zone (the shore-water interface to the top of the natural bank), Shoreland Zone (land-ward from shoreline to development structure or 100 feet), and Aquatic Zone (lake-ward 50 feet of shoreline). The average lakewide habitat score was 79.7 (?3.2) out of 100 possible. Approximately 42 percent of the sites were developed with a mean score of 65.8 (?4.7), while undeveloped sites had a mean score of 90.1 (?2.6).</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of nearshore fish species in Little Webb Lake was conducted on August 21-22, 2023, by Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program staff. Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake, and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at nine sampling stations, but two stations were sampled from the boat due soft sediments and vegetation. Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample five stations, a 15-foot seine was used at two stations, and site conditions prevented the use of seines at two stations. Nearshore sampling captured seventeen species of fish including five species that are intolerant of disturbance (i.e., Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, and Rock Bass) and zero that are tolerant of disturbance. <br> \n <br> \nA concurrent summer trap net survey was also conducted by IBI Program staff. Nine trap nets were set along the shoreline in locations that encompassed multiple habitat types. Trap net sampling captured nine species of fish, including one that is intolerant of disturbance (i.e., Rock Bass). Bluegill comprised a majority of the biomass. <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore and trap net data were combined with gill net data from a June 2022 survey to describe the fish community and provide a fish-based IBI (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment. In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g., Blackchin Shiner, Least Darter, and Rock Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g., Black Bullhead and Green Sunfish). The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.  <br> \n <br> \nResults from this survey indicate that the fish community in Little Webb Lake is healthy as indicated by an FIBI score that exceeds the exceptional use threshold determined for similar lakes. These results will be considered when the biological health of the lake is assessed during the Leech Lake River Watershed assessment process, which will be completed in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.</p>",

Historically, walleye gillnet catch rates have ranged from 0.5 to 1.5.  All of the walleye except one catured in 1991 were greater than 19 inches long.  The walleye sampled in previous asessments were all large fish.  Most of the walleye present in Little Webb are likely fish that have immigrated from Webb Lake.  Ageing of walleye and the length frequency of sample collected shows that the walleye stocking done by lake residents has contributed little, if any, to the population in Little Webb.Northern pike gillnet indices have been relatively stable over the last three assessments.  The 1991 rate (10.8/gillnet lift) was slightly above the third quartile (10.50/lift).  Northern pike ranged from 9 to 37 inches in length, with a modal length group of 19.0-19.9 inches.  The growth was good, with an age 5 fish being 22.2 inches long.Yellow perch were not sampled in the gillnets in 1991, but have been sampled in 1985 (4.8/lift) and in 1969 (13.5/lift).Bluegill abundance of 25.0/trapnet lift falls between the first quartile and the median.  They ranged in length from 3 to 8 inches, with a modal length group of 6.5-6.9 inches.  The PSD for 1991 was 77, compared to 55 in 1985 and 81 in 1969.  Growth was slow, with an age 5 fish being 4.50 inches long.Only three black crappie were sampled in the trapnets, but ten were captured in the gillnets, for a rate of 2.5/gillnet lift.  This rate falls between the median and the third quartile.  The black crappie showed a wide range of lengths (5-12 inches) and showed good growth, with an age 5 fish being 9.9 inches long.Largemouth bass were also caught at a greater rate in the gillnets (2.5/lift) than in the trapnets (0.7/lift).  The growth was good, with an age 4 fish being 10.5 inches long.Yellow bullhead were the only species of bullhead caught and were captured at a rate (26.8/gillnet lift) well above the third quartile (8.50/lift).</p>",

                "narrative": "<p> <br> \nLittle Webb Lake (DOW# 11-0387; Lake Class 31) is a 226-acre lake located near Hackensack, MN. There is a DNR owned public access on the east shore. Little Webb Lake has 3.20 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 37 feet. The lake is primarily managed for Black Crappie, Bluegill, Largemouth Bass, and Northern Pike, and secondarily for Walleye and Yellow Perch. The DNR has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different classes based on physical, chemical and other characteristics. Little Webb Lake is in Lake Class 31; lakes in this class are generally clear and productive with a moderate depth. <br> \n <br> \nA full population assessment was done on Little Webb Lake in 2014.  In 2015, only spring trap netting was used in an effort to target Bluegill and Black Crappie.  Most Bluegill sampled in 2015 were between 6 and 8 inches, but a good number of larger Bluegills were observed. Black Crappie numbers were lower than previous spring trap netting in 2014, likely due to timing of the netting relative to spawning.  Black Crappie ranged in length from 5.4 to 12.7 inches, with an average length of 9.4 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nPeople can have significant impacts on lakes and the fish populations they support. Harvest, lakeshore development, removal of shoreline vegetation, and introductions of invasive species can all adversely affect fish populations. Currently no aquatic invasive species (AIS) have been identified in Little Webb Lake. AIS are moved from infested to non-infested waters by anglers, boaters, and lake shore owners and can adversely impact lakes and fish populations. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access. If you suspect an infestation of an invasive species in this lake, save a specimen and report it to a local natural resource office. Additional information on all of these topics can be found on the DNR website (www.dnr.state.mn.us) or by contacting the Walker Area Fisheries office. <br> \n</p>",

There is a Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MNDNR) owned public access on the east shore. The DNR has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different classes based on physical, chemical and other characteristics. Little Webb Lake is in lake class 31; lakes in this class are generally clear, moderately productive, and moderately deep. Other area lakes in lake class 31 include Child, Widow, and Five Point Lakes. <br> \n <br> \nA total of 12 Largemouth Bass were sampled during the first spring bass electrofishing survey of Little Webb Lake. Lengths ranged from 11 to 18 inches with a mean length of 14 inches. Additional surveys are needed to develop long-term management goals.  <br> \n <br> \nPeople can have significant impacts on lakes and the fish populations they support. Harvest, lakeshore development, removal of shoreline vegetation, and introductions of invasive species can all adversely affect fish populations. Currently, no aquatic invasive species (AIS) have been identified in Little Webb Lake. AIS are moved from infested to non-infested waters by anglers, boaters, and lake shore owners and can adversely impact lakes and fish populations. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access. If you suspect an infestation of an invasive species in this lake, save a specimen and report it to a local natural resource office. Additional information on all of these topics can be found on the DNR website (www.dnr.state.mn.us) or by contacting the Walker Area Fisheries office. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Little Webb Lake has an area of 168 acres and a shoreline length of 2.5 miles.  Access to The lake is primarily managed for northern pike, largemouth bass, bluegill and black crappie and secondarily for walleye and yellow perch. Walleye yearlings and fingerlings have been stocked privately by DNR permit in previous years (i.e., in 2000, 1999, 1996, 1994, 1990, 1987 and 1985).     The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MN DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different lake classes based on physical, chemical and other characteristics.  Little Webb Lake is in Lake Class 31.  Lakes in this class are generally bowl shaped and home to numerous fish species.       The northern pike in Little Webb Lake are abundant.  The average size of northern pike sampled in 2001 was 19.0 inches, with the largest pike sampled measuring 30.9 inches.  Largemouth bass are present in numbers similar to other lakes in this lake class.  Sampled largemouth bass averaged 11.4 inches, ranging in length from 6.1 inches to 16.1 inches.     Walleye are present in low numbers in Little Webb Lake.  The average length of sampled walleye was 19.7 inches, ranging from 10.1 inches to 24.2 inches.  Four year classes were sampled.     Few black crappie were sampled.  Sampled black crappie had an average length of 8.7 inches and a maximum length of 12.0 inches.  Bluegill are abundant with few fish over 7 inches long.  Other species sampled in low abundance include white sucker, yellow perch, and yellow bullhead.  Pumpkinseed and rock bass are abundant.  Although normally present in this type of lake, no bowfin, brown bullhead or black bullhead were sampled.  This may be due to low abundance or simply the lack of their presence.     Anglers can negatively impact the size structure of game-fish populations by harvesting large fish.  By practicing catch and release or selectively harvesting smaller fish and releasing larger ones, anglers can help increase the abundance of these highly desired larger fish.  Such efforts certainly will be rewarded not only in the future but also at the moment of release when the angler provides another with the opportunity to catch the fish again.     Shoreline areas on the land and into the shallow water provide essential habitat for fish and wildlife that live in or near Minnesota's lakes.  Overdeveloped shorelines can't support the fish, wildlife, and clean water that are associated with natural undeveloped lakes. The combined effects of all lakeshore owners \"fixing up\" their property can destroy a lake's valuable natural shorelines.     Shoreline habitat consists of aquatic plants, woody plants and natural lake bottom soils.     Plants in the water and at the water's edge provide habitat, prevent erosion and absorb excess nutrients. Shrubs, trees, and woody debris such as fallen trees or limbs provide good habitat both above and below the water and should be left in place.  Natural lake bottom materials like silt or gravel are more ecologically productive than pure sand trucked in for a swimming beach.  A tidy lawn and a sandy beach make great spots for sunbathing and swimming but do little to provide habitat for fish and wildlife. By leaving a buffer strip of natural vegetation along the shoreline, property owners can reduce erosion, help maintain water quality, and provide habitat and travel corridors for wildlife.     Only if more lakeshore owners manage their shoreline in a natural condition can fish and wildlife populations on Minnesota lakes remain healthy and abundant.  More specific information on protecting or restoring shorelines and watersheds is available through the local DNR Fisheries office.    </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Little Webb Lake is a 168-acre lake located near Hackensack, Minnesota with 2.5 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 37 feet.  Most of the shoreline is undeveloped forest, while the remaining 10% is bog.  There is a state-owned public access on the southeast shore.  The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MN DNR) has classified Minnesota s lakes into 43 different lake classes based on physical, chemical and other characteristics.  Little Webb Lake is in Lake Class 31.  Lakes in this class are generally bowl shaped, clear, and productive with diverse fish communities. <br> \n <br> \nLittle Webb offers good opportunities for anglers seeking a variety of species. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike in Little Webb Lake are abundant with quality fish present.  Historically, northern pike have been abundant in Little Webb Lake.  The average size of northern pike sampled in 2006 was 19.6 inches, with the largest pike sampled measuring 35.6 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nQuality largemouth bass are present with fish up to 18.8 inches in length sampled in the 2006 survey.  Little is known about the abundance or size distribution of largemouth bass in this lake.  Special sampling is needed to assess the abundance and population size structure of this species. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill are abundant with few fish over 7 inches long.  Average length was 5.9 inches with a length range of 1.9 to 8.9 inches.  Size structure has been consistent with previous surveys. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie numbers are near average for this lake class with an average length of 9.4 inches and a range of 4.9 to 13.7 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye are present in low numbers in Little Webb Lake.  The average length of sampled walleye was 21.8 inches, ranging from 18.8 inches to 25.5 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled in low abundance include white sucker, yellow perch, black bullhead, brown bullhead, and yellow bullhead.  Pumpkinseed and rock bass are abundant.  Although normally present in this type of lake, no bowfin were sampled.  This may be due to low abundance or simply the lack of their presence. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers can help maintain or improve the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for table fare, but encourages release of medium- to large-sized fish.  Releasing these fish can help maintain balance in the fish community in Little Webb Lake and provide anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future.   <br> \n <br> \nShoreline areas on the land and into the shallow water provide essential habitat for fish and wildlife that live in or near Minnesota s lakes.  Overdeveloped shorelines can t support the fish, wildlife, and clean water that are associated with natural undeveloped lakes. <br> \n <br> \nShoreline habitat consists of aquatic plants, woody plants and natural lake bottom soils. <br> \nPlants in the water and at the water s edge provide habitat, prevent erosion and absorb excess nutrients.  Shrubs, trees, and woody debris such as fallen trees or limbs provide good habitat both above and below the water and should be left in place.  By leaving a buffer strip of natural vegetation along the shoreline, property owners can reduce erosion, help maintain water quality, and provide habitat and travel corridors for wildlife. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of nearshore fish species in Little Webb Lake was conducted on July 6, 2022, by Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program staff. Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake, and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible. Backpack electrofishing was completed at 9 sampling stations. Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample two stations, a 15-foot seine was used at four sites, and site conditions prevented the use of seines at three stations. Nearshore sampling captured 13 species of fish including four species that are intolerant of disturbance (i.e., Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Iowa Darter, and Rock Bass) and one species tolerant of disturbance (i.e., Black Bullhead). <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore data were combined with trap net and gill net data from a June 2022 survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based IBI (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment. In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g., Blackchin Shiner, and Iowa Darter), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g., Green Sunfish). The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake. For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.   <br> \n <br> \nResults from this survey indicate that the fish community in Little Webb Lake is healthy as indicated by an exceptionally high FIBI score, well above the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes. These results will be considered when the biological health of the lake is assessed during the Leech Lake River Watershed assessment process, which will be completed in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Little Webb Lake is a 168-acre lake located near Hackensack, Minnesota with 2.5 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 37 feet. There is a state-owned public access on the southeast shore. The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MN DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different lake classes based on physical, chemical and other characteristics.  Little Webb Lake is in Lake Class 31.  Lakes in this class are generally bowl shaped, clear, and productive with diverse fish communities. <br> \n <br> \nLittle Webb offers good opportunities for anglers seeking a variety of species.  Northern pike in Little Webb Lake are abundant with quality fish present.  The average size of northern pike sampled in 2011 was 17.8 inches, with the largest pike sampled measuring 34.3 inches.  Quality largemouth bass are present with fish up to 17.5 inches in length sampled in the 2011 survey.  To date, the largemouth bass population has not been effectively surveyed, and special sampling is recommended to more accurately describe the population.  Bluegill are abundant with few fish over 8 inches long. Average length was 6.3 inches with a length range of 2.6 to 9.3 inches.  Black crappie numbers are near average for this lake class with an average length of 7.7 inches and a range of 4.3 to 12.2 inches.  Walleye are present in low numbers in Little Webb Lake.  The average length of sampled walleye was 25.3 inches, ranging from 19.7 inches to 27.7 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nPeople can have significant impacts on lakes and the fish populations they support.  Selective harvest by anglers (harvest of smaller to medium-sized fish) promotes balanced fish communities and sustainable fishing quality.  Removal of shoreline vegetation on private lake lots and mowing grass to the water's edge can reduce water quality, which in turn can adversely affect fish populations.  Similarly, removal of woody debris and aquatic plants from near-shore areas reduces critical habitat needed to support quality fish populations.   <br> \n <br> \nCurrently no aquatic invasive species (AIS) have been identified in Little Webb Lake.  These species are moved from infested to non-infested waters by anglers, boaters, and lake-shore owners and can adversely impact lakes and fish populations.  To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat away before leaving the access.  If you suspect an infestation of an invasive <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Little Webb Lake (DOW# 11-0387; Lake Class 31) is a 226-acre lake located near Hackensack, MN. There is a DNR owned public access on the west shore. Little Webb Lake has 3.20 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 37 feet. The lake is primarily managed for Northern Pike Bluegill, Largemouth Bass, and Black Crappie and secondarily for Walleye and Yellow Perch. The DNR has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different classes based on physical, chemical and other characteristics. Little Webb Lake is in Lake Class 31; lakes in this class are generally clear and productive with a moderate depth. <br> \n <br> \nThe Largemouth Bass in the 2014 summer sample averaged 11 inches with bass up to 17 inches caught. Most Bluegills were between 6 to 8 inches, but a good number of larger Bluegills were observed. Black Crappie numbers were up slightly from the previous sample with the largest fish being 13 inches. Northern Pike numbers are above management goals in Little Webb Lake with Pike up to 32 inches in the nets. Other fish species that anglers can expect to encounter include Black Bullhead, Brown Bullhead, Hybrid Sunfish, Pumpkinseed, Rock Bass, Walleye, Yellow Bullhead, and Yellow Perch. <br> \n <br> \nPeople can have significant impacts on lakes and the fish populations they support. Harvest, lakeshore development, removal of shoreline vegetation, and introductions of invasive species can all adversely affect fish populations. Currently no aquatic invasive species (AIS) have been identified in Little Webb Lake. AIS are moved from infested to non-infested waters by anglers, boaters, and lake shore owners and can adversely impact lakes and fish populations. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access. If you suspect an infestation of an invasive species in this lake, save a specimen and report it to a local natural resource office. Additional information on all of these topics can be found on the DNR website (www.dnr.state.mn.us) or by contacting the Walker Area Fisheries office. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Little Webb Lake is a 226-acre lake with 68 littoral acres, 3.20 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 37 feet located northeast of Hackensack, MN. There is a Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MNDNR) owned public access on the east shore. The DNR has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different classes based on physical, chemical and other characteristics. Little Webb Lake is in lake class 31; lakes in this class are generally clear, moderately productive, and moderately deep. Other area lakes in lake class 31 include Child, Widow, and Five Point Lakes. <br> \nBoth Black Crappie and Bluegill abundances were within management goals and provide quality angling opportunities. Black Crappie ranged in length from 4 to 11 inches with an average length and weight of 6 inches and 0.18 pounds. Bluegill ranged in length from 3 to 9 inches with and average length and weight of 7 inches and 0.3 pounds. A special regulation (daily possession limit of five fish) was implemented in 2017 for both Black Crappie and Bluegill and average lengths for both species have steadily increased since, including historical highs observed for both in 2021. <br> \nPeople can have significant impacts on lakes and the fish populations they support. Harvest, lakeshore development, removal of shoreline vegetation, and introductions of invasive species can all adversely affect fish populations. Currently no aquatic invasive species (AIS) have been identified in Little Webb Lake. AIS are moved from infested to non-infested waters by anglers, boaters, and lake shore owners and can adversely impact lakes and fish populations. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access. If you suspect an infestation of an invasive species in this lake, save a specimen and report it to a local natural resource office. Additional information on all of these topics can be found on the DNR website (www.dnr.state.mn.us) or by contacting the Walker Area Fisheries office. <br> \n</p>",
