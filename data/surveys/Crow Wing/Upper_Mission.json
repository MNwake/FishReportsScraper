                "narrative": "<p>Upper Mission is an 817-acre lake located 8.6 miles from Merrifield in Crow Wing County. Upper Mission is connected to 698-acre lower Mission via a navigable channel.  A public access is located on the north side of the lake.  Maximum depth is 36 feet and 31 % is less than 15 feet. A diverse aquatic plant community exists, with large beds of hardstem bulrush present.  Shallow water substrate is mainly sand. Both lakes have the exotic species curly-leaf pondweed so fishermen should be extra careful to remove all plants from the boat and trailer, which is already required by law on all lakes.  Special regulations were placed on northern pike in 2003 on Upper and lower Mission Lake to increase the number of larger pike.  This called for the release of northern pike 24.0 to 36.0 inches.  Anglers must also follow the statewide regulation, thus on these lakes only one over 36.0 inches may be kept. <br> \n <br> \nThe northern pike catch rate of 10.0/gill net is within the range of the eight previous surveys of 1.33/gill net (1994) to 12.34 gill net (1971). Size ranged from 19.0 to 37.8 inches, with an average of 26.2 inches. A total of 62 % of the fish were 24.0 inches or greater. Three fish were greater than 36.0 inches in 2007.   Age classes two thru eight were present. Growth rate was good.  Previous surveys also had a high percentage over 24.0 inches.  To determine if the regulation is having a positive affect on increasing the average size will take more time.  Northern pike recruitment with strong year class strength can influence short-term results. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye stocking has occurred on a regular basis since 1991.  The current management plans calls for 2.0 pounds littoral acre (water 15.0 feet deep or less) every other year.  The walleye catch rate of 2.75/gill net was about average for this lake.  Past surveys have ranged from 1.67/gill net (1984) to 5.33/gill net (1971).  Sizes ranged from10.9 to 27.6 inches and averaged 18.8 inches. Growth rate was good. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie were caught in good numbers in gill nets.  Average size was 7.8 inches, and 18 % were 8.0 inches or greater. Low numbers were observed in trap nets.   The bluegill catch rate of 46.01/trap net is very good and average size was 6.4 inches.  A total of 14 % of the catch was 7.0 inches or greater. Yellow perch were found in moderate numbers of 18.4/gill net.  Largemouth bass were sampled in the spring of 2007 by electro fishing.  Results were excellent, with 120.5 fish/hour run time.  Sizes ranged from 4.4 to 16.8 inches and averaged 9.3 inches. A total of 12.5 % were 12.0 inches or greater.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Walleye fingerlings have been stocked on a regular basis into Upper Mission since 1999.  The current rate is 512 pounds in odd numbered years.  The 2014 gill net catch was low for this type of lake (2.6/net), but on par with past catches.  Average length was 16.4\" and 93% of the fish were 12\" or larger.  The 2011 year class accounted for 73% of the catch.  A fair number of these fish also showed up in our spring bass electrofishing catch (33.3/hr).  Walleyes sampled by electrofishing had an average length of 14.7\". <br> \n <br> \nThe northern pike catch was the highest to date at 14.7/net, although our goal is to maintain this below 5/net.  Average length was decent at 24.1\" and 41% of the fish were 24\" or larger.  The largest fish measured 37.9\".  A special regulation on Upper and Lower Mission requires all northern pike from 24-36\" to be immediately released.  One over 36\" is allowed in possession. <br> \n <br> \nPanfish size was small, with average lengths for black crappie at 8.2\" and bluegill at 5.3\".  Numbers were also low in our nets for crappies at 0.8/trap net.  Bluegill numbers were a little better at 24.5/trap net. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Upper Mission is an 817 acre lake located 7.5 miles northeast of Merrifield in Crow Wing County.  Upper Mission is connected to 698 acre Lower Mission via a navigable channel.  A public access is located on the north side of the lake.  Upper Mission has a maximum depth of 36 feet and 31% of the lake is 15 feet deep or less.  During the 1994 survey, 99 homes/cabins and 2 resorts were counted on the lake.  The aquatic plant community consisted of 36 species of which muskgrass was the most abundant.  Aquatic plants are important in providing food, cover, and spawning habitat for fish and other aquatic species.  Shallow water substrate soils are predominately sand.Regular walleye stocking has occurred in Upper Mission Lake since 1991, including private stocking from 1991 through 1997.  The current rate of stocking is 1.5 lbs. of fingerlings per littoral acre (384 lbs.) in odd numbered years.  The walleye catch rate was below average in 2004 (2.8/gill net) when compared to similar lakes.  Average size was 20.3\" and 3.2 lbs.  Walleyes were also caught during spring electrofishing at the rate of 10.5/hr.  Average length of these fish was 12.0\".  Growth was normal and 73% of the fish were 12\" or larger.The northern pike catch rate was average (6.0/gill net).  Average length and weight were 26.1\" and 4.3 lbs.  These fish had fast growth and 62% were 24\" or larger.  Special regulations on Upper and Lower Mission call for the immediate release of all northern pike measuring 24\" through 36\" and only 1 over 36\" is allowed in possession.Largemouth bass were caught in average numbers in gill nets (1.3/gill net).  Average size was 11.8\" and 1.1 lbs.  They were caught in above average numbers in trap nets (1.9/trap net).  Size averaged  9.3\" and 0.6 lbs.  Spring electrofishing resulted in a catch rate of 116.0/hr.  Average length was 9.8\" and 20% were 12\" or larger.  Growth was normal.The black crappie catch rate was above average in gill nets (5.1/gill net), the highest to date.  Average length was 8.7\" and 59% of the fish were 8\" or larger.  The 2001 year class represented 64% of the fish.  No black crappies were caught in trap nets.  Growth was normal.The bluegill catch rate was average (25.4/trap net), however, this was the lowest catch to date.  Average length was 5.5\" and only 2% were 7\" or larger.  Bluegill were also caught in gill nets at the rate of 13.7/gill net.  Average length of these fish was 6.5\" and 37% were 7\" or larger.  The 1999 year class represented 32% of the fish and growth was normal.The yellow perch catch rate was average (14.6/gill net), however, this was the lowest catch to date.  Average length was 6.5\" and only 5% were 8\" or larger.  Growth was normal, with 73% of the fish coming from the 2001 year class.Other fish species captured included black bullhead, bowfin (dogfish), golden shiner, green sunfish, hybrid sunfish, pumpkinseed, rock bass, white sucker, and yellow bullhead.</p>",

The 2022 gill net catch was average for this type of lake (3.3/gill net).  Average length was 19.4\" and 97% of the fish were 12\" or larger.   <br> \n <br> \nThe northern pike catch was the highest to date at 15.8/gill net, although our goal is to get this below 5/gill net.  Average length was 22.2\" and 19% of the fish were 24\" or larger.  A special regulation on Upper and Lower Mission requires all northern pike from 24-36\" to be immediately released.  One over 36\" is allowed in possession. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie numbers were relatively low at 0.3/trap net and 0.5/gill net with 67% measuring 8\" or larger.  Bluegill numbers were good at 24.5/trap net, with an average length of 5.8\" and 27% measuring 7\" or larger. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Upper Mission is 817 acres in size and is located about ten miles north of Merrifield.  It is the larger, and upstream, lake in a two-lake chain which connects to the Mississippi River via Mission Creek.  There is a public access on the north shore.  About 100 homes/cabins and two resorts were present in 1994.  About 31% of the lake is shallower than 15 feet.  Shallow water soils are primarily sandy.  It is classified as a hardwater lake with low phosphorus fertility.  Water clarity is above average for the area.  The aquatic plant community is diverse and contributes to the general health of the aquatic ecosystem.  Emergent plants like bulrush often provide preferred spawning habitat for bass and panfish species.  Wild rice beds can provide important spawning habitat for northern pike.  Submerged plants grew to a depth of about 15 feet in '94.  These species provide important cover and feeding areas for a wide variety of fish species.Largemouth bass, walleyes and northern pike were the most abundant gamefish found in the 1994 netting.  Largemouth bass were taken in \"average\" numbers when compared to similar type lakes.  The best bass sample was from spring electrofishing.  Bass up to 17.3 inches long were sampled.  Of the bass that were at least 8.0 inches long, 33% were 12.0 inches or more in length.  Seven year classes were sampled, growth was good and fish from the 1990 and '91 year classes were most abundant.Walleye fingerlings were stocked in 1991-'93.  Fish from those year classes were well represented in summer net catches.  However, when compared to similar type lakes, the catch rate bordered or \"low\" and was not much different than results of previous nettings done on the lake.The northern pike catch was \"low\" in comparison to similar type lakes.  Although the catch was lower than in '89, size range, average length and average weight were all very similar between the two nettings.  Six age classes were sampled and growth appeared to be fast.The bluegill catch was \"average\" in 1994.  Bluegills to 8.5 inches long were present in the catch.  Hybrid sunfish, green sunfish, pumpkinseeds and rock bass also were present.  Black crappies were also caught in \"average\" numbers.  Most crappies were from the 1991 year class and had good growth.Forage species were abundant in '94.  The yellow perch catch was \"high\" and perch to 11.5 inches long were present.  Tullibees were also taken in \"high\" numbers.  White suckers were caught in \"average\" numbers.  Other species sampled in '94 included \"low\" numbers of black and brown bullheads and \"average\" numbers of yellow bullheads and dogfish.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Upper Mission lake is a 817 acre lake located about ten miles north of Merrifield.  It is connected via a navigatable channel to Lower Mission.  Maximum depth is 36 feet with 31% shallower than 15 feet.  The majority of the shallow water soil type is sand.  The lake has numerous bulrush beds which maintain water quality and are utilized for fish spawning and home for many aquatic insects.  These beds should be protected from increasing shoreline development.  Water clarity is good when compared to other area lakes.  A public access exists on the north side or access is available thru the channel from Lower Mission where a public access is on the west shore.Walleye have been stocked in the majority of years since 1991.  In 1999 walleye were observed in normal numbers for this lake class type with a catch rate of 5.0 fish/gill net and sizes ranged form 11.0 to 31.4 inches with an average size of 19.8 inches.  Growth rates were normal with seven age classes present.  Northern pike number of 5.4 fish/gill net is considered a normal catch for this lake type.  Previous catch rates have ranged from a low of 1.3 fish/gill net in 1956 and 1994 to a high of 6.8 fish/gill net in 1979.  Sizes in 1999 ranged from 18.2 to 35.8 inches with an average size of 25.2 inches.  Seven age classes were observed with growth rate above average.  The practice of catch and release is very important to maintain the quality nothern pike fishery that exists here.  Black crappie were present in the regular survey in low to moderate numbers with all fish observed under 8.0 inches.  A special 1999 spring trapnetting for black crappies producted crappies from 3.5 to 10.1 inches with 11.8% eight inches or larger.  Seven age classes were observed with growth rates slower than normal.  This lake in past years was known as a premier crappie lake and recently fishing has been slower and smaller size.  Concern about maintaining a quality black crappie population prompted this special netting.  Bluegill were represented in above average numbers and sizes ranged from 3.0 to 7.4 inches with 6.4% 7.0 inches or greater.  Five age classes were observed with ages 2-6 present of which 88% younger than age 5.  Growth rates were considered normal.  Largemouth bass were present in moderate numbers with sizes ranging from 4.9 to 16.9 inches in the regular survey.  Yellow perch and tullibee were present in substantial numbers and will provide a great forage food base for many species.  Yellow bullhead were present in average numbers with sizes up to 14.6 inches and an average size of about 10.8 inches. </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Upper Mission Lake is an 882 acre lake, with a maximum depth of 36', located just northeast of the town of Ossipee, MN.  Upper Mission is in the Mississippi River-Brainerd Watershed.  A nearshore survey was conducted to assess the populations of both game and non-game fish species.  Fourteen 100' long sampling stations were evenly spaced around the lakeshore.  Each station was then sampled by backpack electrofishing, and if conditions allowed with a 15' or 50' 1/8th inch seine. <br> \n <br> \nThe survey took place July 27, 2022, with all 14 stations sampled by backpack electrofishing.  The 50' 1/8th inch seine was used at 7 stations and the 15' 1/8th inch seine was used at 1 station.  Sixteen species were sampled, including four species that are intolerant of habitat disturbance: Blackchin Shiner, Iowa Darter, Banded Killifish, and Rock Bass. This nearshore survey will be used along with the gill net and trap net survey conducted the week of June 13th, 2022, to calculate a Fish-Based Index of Biotic Integrity (FIBI) score.  The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health by the types of fish species present and comparing it to what is expected for this type of lake.</p>",
