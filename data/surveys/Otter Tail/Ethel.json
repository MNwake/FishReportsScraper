                "narrative": "<p>     Ethel Lake is a 194-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located in central Otter Tail County approximately seven miles northeast of Battle Lake, MN. The maximum depth of the lake is 64 feet; however, 35% of the lake is 15 feet or less in depth.  The shoreline length is 3.2 miles.  The immediate watershed is composed primarily of agricultural land interspersed with hardwood woodlots.  The secchi disk reading during the 2014 survey was 22.1 feet.  The secchi disk reading has ranged from 8.0 to 23.0 feet in previous surveys. <br> \n     A DNR owned public access is located at the northeast end of the lake off of County Road 5.  Parking at the access is very limited.  Shoal water substrates consist primarily of sand and gravel.  Shoreline development has increased substantially in recent years.  Emergent aquatic plants, mainly hardstem bulrush and common cattails, are located in scattered stands around the lake.  Emergent aquatic plants such as bulrush and cattail provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish species such as Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, and panfish.  They also serve as an important nursery area for all species of fish.  Because of their important ecological value, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit.   <br> \n     Ethel Lake can be ecologically classified as a bass-panfish type of lake and this is reflected in the assemblage of the fish community.  Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, and Bluegill are the dominant gamefish species present.  Suitable spawning habitat for these species exists throughout the lake. \t <br> \n     A moderately high density Northern Pike population exists.  Northern Pike size structure has consistently been poor.  Northern Pike ranged in length from 12.2 to 28.5 inches with a mean length and weight of 17.6 inches and 1.5 pounds. Northern Pike growth rates continue to be slow.  Pike attain an average length of 18.5 inches at four years of age. <br> \n      Largemouth bass ranged in length from 6.4 to 14.8 inches.  Age data from recent assessments indicate that bass reproduction is consistently good.  Bass attain an average length of 13.4 inches at five years of age. <br> \n     Bluegill abundance has historically been high; however, size structure remains good.  Sixty percent of the bluegills were 7.0 inches or greater in length.  Bluegills attain an average length of 6.9 inches five years of age. <br> \n     Anglers can maintain the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large-size fish while allowing the harvest of the more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with opportunities to catch more large fish in the future. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Ethel Lake is a 194-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located in central Otter Tail County.  The maximum depth of the lake is 64 feet; 35% of the surface acreage is fifteen feet or less in depth.  The shoreline length is 3.2 miles and the secchi disk reading at the time of this survey was 14.0.  The secchi disk reading, which is a standard measure of water quality, has ranged from 8.0 to 23.0 feet in previous surveys.      A concrete public access is located at the northeast end of the lake.  Parking at the access is limited.  Shoreline development currently is light but it is increasing.  The development is primarily restricted to the northwest shoreline of the lake at this time.  Increased lakeshore development has been demonstrated to negatively impact water quality by increasing nutrient levels and shoreline erosion.  This can result in increased plankton/algae blooms, aquatic plant growth, and suspended sediments, all of which lead to decreased water clarity.  The impacts of shoreline development on water quality can be minimized if the best management practices (BMP's) are followed.  Information concerning shoreline BMP's can be obtained by contacting any county extension office.       Emergent aquatic plants, mainly hardstem bulrush and some cattail, are located in scattered stands around the lake. Emergent aquatic plants such as bulrush and common cattail provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat, and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms from erosion, and can actually absorb and breakdown polluting chemicals.  Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish species such as northern pike, largemouth bass and panfish.  They also serve as an important nursery area for all species of fish.  Because of their important ecological value, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit.  The most common types of submerged aquatic plants present in the lake are chara, flatstem pondweed and largeleaf pondweed.  Shoal water substrates are primarily sand and gravel.       Ethel Lake is a good example of a central Minnesota bass-panfish type lake, but because of recent high water levels has experienced an increase in northern pike abundance.  The high water levels have made suitable northern pike spawning habitat available.  Walleye natural reproduction is limited, and the population is maintained at a level expected for this type of lake by stocking.  Electrofishing data indicates that the largemouth bass population is fairly balanced.  Largemouth bass ranged in length from 6.9 inches to 19.7 inches.  Bluegills are extremely abundant and slow growing but the size structure appears to be in balance with 60% of the bluegills > 7.0 inches.  The recent increase in water levels appears to have also improved suitable spawning habitat for black crappies.  Four year classes of crappies were sampled with lengths ranging from 5.5 inches to 11.7 inches.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>     Ethel Lake is a 194-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located in central Otter Tail County, approximately seven miles northeast Battle Lake, MN. The maximum depth of the lake is 64 feet and 35% of the lake is fifteen feet or less in depth.  The shoreline length is 3.2 miles.  The immediate watershed is composed primarily of agricultural land interspersed with hardwood woodlots.  The secchi disk reading at the time of this survey was 14.5 feet.  The secchi disk reading, which is a standard measure of water clarity, has ranged from 8.0 to 23.0 feet in previous surveys. <br> \n     A public access is located at the northeast end of the lake off of County Road 5.  Parking at the access is very limited.  Shoreline development has increased substantially in recent years.  Increased lakeshore development has been demonstrated to negatively impact water quality by increasing nutrient levels and shoreline erosion.  This can result in increased plankton/algae blooms, aquatic plant growth, and suspended sediments, all of which lead to decreased water clarity.  The impacts of shoreline development on water quality can be minimized if the best management practices (BMP's) are followed.  Information concerning shoreline BMP's can be obtained by contacting any county extension office. <br> \n     Emergent aquatic plants, mainly hardstem bulrush and cattails, are located in scattered stands around the lake.  Emergent aquatic plants such as bulrush and common cattail provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat, and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish species such as northern pike, largemouth bass, and panfish.  They also serve as an important nursery area for all species of fish.  Because of their important ecological value, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit.   <br> \n     Ethel Lake can be ecologically classified as a bass-panfish type of lake and this is reflected in the assemblage of the fish community.  Northern pike, largemouth bass, and bluegill are the dominant gamefish species present.  Suitable spawning habitat for these species exists throughout the lake. \t <br> \n     Walleye fingerlings are stocked by the DNR on a biennial basis.  Age data indicate that recruitment of walleye in both stocked and non-stocked years is limited.  Predation by the high density northern pike and largemouth bass populations is most likely limiting survival of walleye fingerlings.   <br> \n     Northern pike abundance increased dramatically in the late 1990's in response to high water levels in the lake. The high water levels have increased the amount of suitable spawning habitat available to northern pike.  Northern pike size structure has consistently been poor.  Northern pike ranged in length from 9.7 to 28.7 inches with a mean length and weight of 16.8 inches and 1.1 pounds. Northern pike growth rates continue to be slow; pike attain an average length of 19.2 inches at four years of age. <br> \n     An abundant largemouth bass population exists.  Largemouth bass ranged in length from 8.4 to 16.2 inches. Age data from recent assessments indicate that bass reproduction is consistently good.  Bass attain an average length of 10.1 inches at four years of age. <br> \n     Bluegill abundance has historically been high; however, size structure remains good.  Sixty-one percent of the bluegills were 7.0 inches or greater in length.  Bluegills attain an average length of 6.1 inches six years of age. <br> \n     Anglers can maintain the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large-size fish while allowing the harvest of the more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with opportunities to catch more large fish in the future. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of nearshore fish species in Ethel Lake was conducted beginning on June 28, 2017 by Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program Staff.  Ten sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot seine.  Nearshore sampling captured 20 species of fish including five species that are intolerant of disturbance (Banded Killifish, Blackchin Shiner, Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, and Mimic Shiner) and one that is tolerant of disturbance (Green Sunfish). <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore data were combined with trap net and gill net data from a June 2014 survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based IBI (FIBI) score.  The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment.  In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g. Blacknose Shiner, Iowa Darter, and Rock Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g. Black Bullhead, Common Carp, and Green Sunfish).  The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake.  For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.   <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey indicates Ethel Lake is in good health as indicated by an FIBI score above the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes.  Data from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Otter Tail River Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.</p>",
