Hizer Lake has no public access and lies on an unnamed tributary to the Blackhoof River.  An initial survey was conducted on Hizer Lake to gather information on physical characteristics and the fish population.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike abundance was 3.4 per trapnet lift.  Average size of 16.9 inches was considered small and growth was typical.  Age analysis revealed consistent recruitment with all year-classes represented from 1999 through 2007. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch abundance of 0.7 per trapnet lift was average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Average size of 6.9 inches was considered small but growth was fast.  Only two year-classes were present (2005 and 2006).  <br> \n  <br> \nBlack crappie abundance of 10.7 per trapnet lift was well above average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Average size of 6.1 inches was considered small and growth was fast.  All black crappie originated from the 2007 year-class. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill abundance of 1.2 per trapnet lift was slightly below average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Average size of 5.3 considered typical and growth was fast.  Only two year-classes were present (2006 and 2007). <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species sampled from Hizer Lake in 2009 include black bullhead, golden shiner, pumpkinseed sunfish, tadpole madtom and white sucker. <br> \n   <br> \nInformation was collected on aquatic vegetation, substrate and water quality.  Diversity of aquatic plants was low with 20 species or species groups identified along 10 transects.  Floating-leaf burred was the most frequently identified plant (100% of transects).  Sedges, spikerush, stonewort, swamp fivefinger and yellow waterlily were all identified at greater than 50% of the transects.   The most common substrate type was detritus, which was identified at 90% of the transects.  Gravel, rubble, sand and muck had frequencies of occurrence between 40 and 60%.  Results of laboratory water analysis indicate Hizer is a slightly alkaline (pH 7.2), soft water lake (alkalinity 22 ppm) with good fertility (total phosphorus 0.067 ppm). <br> \n</p>",
