                "narrative": "<p>Shallow Pond Lake is a small, shallow, walleye-centrarchid lake located just north of Alvwood, MN.  The lake has 176 acres, all of which are less than 15 feet.  The maximum depth is 14 feet with a Secchi disk reading of 5.5 feet (light bog stain). Shallow Pond is managed for walleye and northern pike and is currently stocked with walleye fry every four years.     Shallow Pond has a northern pike population that remains at very high levels.  This species was sampled at 23.8/gill net in this assessment, well above the 3rd quartile for this lake class.  Most of the northern pike sampled were small with 80% aged between age 2 and 4.  The fish ranged in length from 12.6 to 25.4 inches and had a mean length of 19.0 inches.  They had a mean weight of 1.5 pounds.  Growth was comparable to the statewide averages.  An age 3 northern pike in Shallow Pond Lake is 17.0 inches.      Walleye have always been sampled and natural reproduction is known to occur.  In this assessment they were sampled at 4.3/gill net, above the lake class median.  Five of the sixteen (31%) walleye sampled were from stocked years.  They ranged in length from 15.0 to 22.4 inches and had a mean length of 19.5 inches.  The mean weight of those sampled was 2.8 pounds.  Growth was faster than the statewide averages for age 1-4 but still within 15% of those averages.  Growth was closer to the mean for age 5-9 walleye.     The yellow perch gill net catch rate (28.3/set) was the lowest observed but still well above the lake class median. Perch sampled in the gill nets ranged in length from 5.1-11.4 inches and had a mean length of 7.8 inches.             The bullhead species have historically been abundant in Shallow Pond.  In this assessment, brown bullhead were sampled at 21.8/gill net and black bullheads at 3.3/gill net.  The brown bullhead ranged in length from 6.2 to 14.6 inches.  The black bullheads ranged in length from 5.1 to 9.8 inches       The black crappie trap net catch of 1.7/trap net was just below the lake class median but the highest recorded.  They ranged in length from 4.5 to 12.4 inches and had a mean length of 6.0 inches.  Growth exceeded the statewide averages by 15% for age 1 and 5 but similar to the averages for age 2-4.     Other species sampled were bluegill (0.2/trap net), bowfin, white sucker, and pumpkinseed sunfish.       </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Shallow Pond Lake is managed for walleye and northern pike and is currently being stocked with walleye fry.  Walleye were captured in gill nets at the highest rate yet.  This rate is within the expected range for this type of lake.  They had a mean length of 19.5 inches and a mean weight of 2.7 pounds.  Natural reproduction is apparently occurring as some of the walleye that were sampled were from nonstocked years.  Growth appears to be good.     Northern pike were sampled in gill nets at a lower rate than in the previous two assessments but within the expected range.  Pike sampled in gill nets ranged from 14.1 to 30.8 inches in length.  They had a mean length of 22.3 inches and a mean weight of 2.7 pounds.  Growth for young fish appears to be above average while growth of older fish slows, yet remains good.     Yellow perch were sampled in gill nets at the lowest rate yet, but this rate still exceeds the expected range.  Perch ranged from 5.8 to 11.6 inches in length.  Growth appears to be good.     Bluegill were sampled in trap nets at the highest rate yet observed.  This rate is within the expected range.  However, all of them were only one year old, and therefore very small (maximum length = 4.2 inches).     Black crappie were sampled in trap nets at the highest rate yet observed.  They were of good size also (mean length = 11.1 inches).  They appear to be growing at an above average rate.     Other fish sampled in gill and trap nets include:  white sucker, black, brown and yellow bullhead, rock bass and pumpkinseed sunfish.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Shallow Pond is located approximately eight miles south of Northhome, MN and within the Big Fork River watershed.  The 176 acre lake has a maximum depth of 14 feet and the lightly developed shoreline is 3.9 miles in length.  There is a public access located on the north shore which is owned by the U.S. Forest Service.  Secchi disk transparency has averaged 5.8 feet over seven surveys and has ranged from 2.0 - 9.0 feet.  Water quality analysis has indicated the lake to be extremely fertile and filamentous algae blooms occur regularly.  Because the lake is both fertile and shallow, it is prone to partial winterkills.  However, due to the connection with the Popple River, fish are easily able to repopulate.  Shallow Pond is included in ecological lake class 39.  Other area lakes in this class include Battle, Bear and Dora.   <br> \n <br> \nThe 2011 lake management plan (LMP) lists Walleye and Northern Pike as primary species for management and Black Crappie as a secondary species.  The LMP goals were to 1) maintain a Walleye gill net catch rate exceeding 5.0/net, and 2) maintain a Northern Pike gill net catch near 11.6/net.   <br> \n <br> \nA standard survey was conducted in June 2017 to assess the characteristics of the fish community using four gill nets and six trap nets.  Trap net catch rates were not representative as dense mats of filamentous algae around the entire shoreline did not allow for proper placement.  <br> \n <br> \nThe Walleye gill net catch rate decreased from 5.5/net in 2010 to 2.8/net, remained within the typical  range for lakes with similar habitats but did not meet the management goal.  Walleye gill net catch rates have been within this range in six of seven surveys.  A total of 11 Walleye were captured in gill nets ranging in length from 13.2 - 23.5 inches with a mean length of 18.2 inches.  Analysis of aging structures indicated that only one Walleye corresponded to a year in which the lake was stocked.  Walleye attained a length of 15.2 inches at age-3, well above the statewide average.   <br> \n <br> \nThe Northern Pike gill net catch rate increased from 12.0/net in 2010 to 17.5/net, which is above the range of what would be expected in lakes with similar habitats.  The management goal was not met, and the gill net catch rate has been above this range in five of seven assessments.  Northern Pike from gill nets ranged in length from 12.9 - 29.9 inches with a mean length of 20.3 inches.  Size structure was  poor as the average length was 20.3 inches and only 1% of the fish sampled exceeded 28 inches.  No ageing structures were collected in this survey, but previous surveys have shown growth rates near the statewide average.   <br> \n <br> \nA total of ten Black Crappie were sampled in gill and trap nets ranging in length from 8.7 - 12.2 inches.  Three age classes were represented in the sample, ages 4, 5 and 7.   Growth rates remained near the statewide average with an average length of 8.6 inches at age-4.   <br> \n <br> \nShallow Pond has a history of high Yellow Perch gill net catches.  The gill net catch rate decreased from 82.8/net in 2010 to 62.0/net, but remained well above the range of what would be expected in lakes with similar habitats.  Yellow Perch gill net catches have been above this range in six of seven surveys.  Yellow Perch ranged in length from 5.0 - 12.3 inches with an average length of 7.9 inches.  Six Yellow Perch were captured that exceeded 12.0 inches.  Yellow grub, an internal parasite, was observed in 33% of the Yellow Perch examined.  <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled in this and previous surveys include: Black Bullhead, Blackchin Shiner, Bluegill, Bluntnose Minnow, Bowfin, Brown Bullhead, Burbot, Iowa Darter, Johnny Darter, Largemouth Bass, Pumpkinseed Sunfish, Tadpole Madtom, Tullibee, Whitefish, White Sucker and Yellow Bullhead. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Background <br> \n <br> \nShallow Pond Lake is located in the Chippewa National Forest and the Big Fork River watershed south of Northome, Minnesota.  It is in ecological lake class #39.  Lakes in this classification are moderate in size, relatively shallow, and have moderately clear, hard water.  Shallow Pond Lake is 176 acres and has a maximum depth of 14 feet.  Water quality analysis in 1989 showed that the lake was very fertile with high phosphorous levels and a Secchi disk reading of only 2 feet.  The Secchi disk reading in June of 2010 was 9 feet, indicating that the lake can be relatively clear for at least part of the year. Shallow Pond Lake receives water from Island Lake and outlets to the Popple River.  The Popple River forms a relatively open system with broad connections to other water bodies and Shallow Pond is believed to benefit from fish moving into and out of the lake.  There is a public access on the north end of the lake owned by the U.S. Forest Service.  A few dwellings exist near the lakeshore, but much of the shoreline is in a natural state.  The lake supports a diverse aquatic plant community which includes abundant emergent and floating leaved plants.  A diverse plant community is an important attribute in keeping a desirable fish community in Shallow Pond Lake.   <br> \n <br> \nThe lake management plan for Shallow Pond Lake was last revised in 2004.  Walleye and northern pike were identified as the primary management species and black crappie were listed as a secondary species.  The long range goals of the lake management plan were to increase walleye gill net abundance to 5.8/gill net.  To accomplish this goal, Pike River strain walleye fry were stocked biennially at the rate of 1000/acre starting in 2004.  No experimental of special regulations exist for Shallow Pond Lake but statewide seasons and limits apply. <br> \n <br> \nAssessment Results <br> \n <br> \nTest netting was conducted on Shallow Pond Lake in early June of 2010.  Shallow Pond Lake was also included in near shore index of biological integrity (IBI) sampling in mid-July of 2010.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch were the most common fish captured in the gill net sample.  The catch was high compared to lakes with similar habitats and was somewhat above average for Shallow Pond.  Shallow Pond Lake has a long history of high perch catches.  Most perch were relatively small, averaging 7.9 inches.  Some quality sized perch were capture as 44% exceeded 8 inches.  The largest perch captured was nearly 12 inches in length.  Sixty-four percent of the sampled perch had parasitic yellow grub, which may limit angler popularity of the fishery.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike were the second most common fish in the gill net sample.  The catch was high compared to similar lakes but below average for Shallow Pond Lake.  Shallow Pond has excellent northern pike spawning habitat and has historically supported high pike catch rates.  When northern pike occur at high density, average size is typically small and growth is often poor.  The 2010 sample indicated a moderate size distribution.  Northern pike lengths ranged from 14.1 to 29.1 inches and averaged 21.5 inches.  Many pike exceeded 21 inches, but few angler-preferred pike were present as only 5% exceeded 28 inches.  Age analysis identified 7 year classes. Most pike were relatively young, averaging 3.4 years of age, and only 17% of the sampled pike were 5 years old or older.  The lack of older pike may indicate high mortality of older pike or high emmigration rates of adult pike from Shallow Pond Lake.  Growth was near the statewide average with individuals typically exceeding 21 inches by age 4. The lake appears to be an important rearing area for young pike in the Popple River system and it is doubtful that meaningful improvements in pike size distribution could be achieved given the amount and quality of the spawning habitat.   <br> \n <br> \nWalleye were captured at a comparable rate to catches from similar lakes, and above average for Shallow Pond Lake.  The catch rate was just below the goal of the lake management plan.  Captured walleye were generally large, as length ranged from 11.3 to 26.5 inches and averaged 20 inches.  Most walleye exceeded 15 inches and many exceeded 20 inches.  Age analysis identified 7 year classes.  Fewer than half of the captured walleye corresponded to a stocked year.  Walleye were generally older individuals, averaging 7 years of age.  Eighty five percent of the sampled walleye exceeded age-5.  Growth was near the statewide average with individuals typically exceeding 16 inches by age 5.  The lack of young walleye in Shallow Pond Lake may suggest that the lake does not function as a walleye rearing area, but does provide important habitat for transient adult walleyes as they move through the system.  Shallow Pond Lake may be an important feeding area for adult walleye, given the history of high perch catches.  The lake appears to support excellent angler opportunities for large walleye, given the relative abundance and favorable size distribution of this species.  <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie were captured at a relatively low rate but about average for Shallow Pond Lake.  The lake has a history of low crappie catches, which likely limits the popularity of the fishery.  Captured crappies were large, ranging from 11.5 to 12.7 inches, and the size distribution suggests that modest angling opportunities may exist for large individuals.   <br> \n <br> \nShallow Pond Lake supports a relatively diverse fish community.  Other species captured include bluegill, black bullhead, black chin shiner, bowfin, brown bullhead, largemouth bass, pumpkinseed sunfish, and white sucker.  <br> \n <br> \nThe protection of water quality and habitat is critical in maintaining or improving fish and wildlife populations.  Unfortunately, human activities often negatively impact our lakes.  Fertilized turf-grass lawns and failing septic systems along with the removal of shoreline and aquatic vegetation, mowing to the shore, and installing sand blanket beaches result in destabilized shorelines, uncontrolled erosion, and increased run-off, contributing excess nutrients and sediment to the lake and degrading water quality and habitat.  By understanding the cumulative impacts of our actions and taking steps to avoid or minimize them, we can help insure our quality water resources can be enjoyed well into the future. Anglers can further help insure quality fishing by practicing selective harvest and catch and release.   <br> \n</p>",

The walleye gill net catch was significantly decreased due to the winterkill last winter (1988-89).  Walleye fry were stocked last spring (1989) and appear to have survived well, as 23 young-of-year were captured in 4,700 square feet of shoal water seined.  Yellow perch abundance is also much higher than local and state medians despite last winter's low oxygen levels.  Black bullhead species abundance has dropped significantly from previous studies.  It is suspected that after a winterkill the lake is repopulated with many fish species from spring spawning migrations up the Popple River from lakes downstream such as Round and Squaw Lakes.</p>",
