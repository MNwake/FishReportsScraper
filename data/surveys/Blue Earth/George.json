                "narrative": "<p>George Lake in Blue Earth County is an 80 acre lake located near the town of Madison Lake. A DNR-owned public access is located on the south end of the lake in the Lake George county park. George Lake was surveyed the week of June 20, 2010 to monitor the fish community.\n\nBluegills were the most abundant fish in trap nets at 92 fish per net lift. Bluegills averaged 6.2 inches in length and just fewer than five to the pound in weight. Bluegill were very small; less than two percent of all fish sampled exceeded 7 inches in length.\n\t\t\nBlack crappie averaged 18 fish per gill net lift and 75 fish per trap net lift. Crappies were small, with an all gears average weight fewer than four to the pound and an average length of 7.7 inches. Like bluegill, black crappie were very small with less than two percent of all fish sampled exceeding 9 inches in length.\n\nNorthern pike were sampled in low abundance. Pike averaged 2.7 fish per gill net lift, which registers near the bottom quartile for similarly classified lakes. Average pike length was 23.8 inches and weight was three pounds. \n\nYellow perch were found in trace numbers by all gear used in the survey. Largemouth bass, despite not being well sampled by passive gears (gill nets and trap nets), did show up in low abundance. Young of the year bass were sampled in 1/4 inch seines and with backpack electrofishers. Much of George Lake's shoreline is undeveloped, which means a great deal of fish habitat has yet been undisturbed.\n\nOther fish seen in the survey include black bullhead, common carp, golden shiner, Johnny darter, pumpkinseed, and yellow bullhead.\n\nAnglers can help maintain or improve the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest. Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for table fare, but encourages release of medium- to large-sized fish. Releasing these fish can help maintain balance in the fish community in George Lake and provide anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future. \n\nShoreline areas on the land and into the shallow water provide essential habitat for fish and wildlife that live in or near Minnesota's lakes. Overdeveloped shorelines cannot support the fish, wildlife, and clean water that are associated with natural undeveloped lakes. Shoreline habitat consists of aquatic plants, woody plants, and natural lake bottom soils. \n\nPlants in the water and at the water's edge provide habitat, prevent erosion, and absorb excess nutrients. Shrubs, trees, and woody debris such as fallen trees or limbs provide good habitat both above and below the water and should be left in place. By leaving a buffer strip of natural vegetation along the shoreline, property owners can reduce erosion, help maintain water quality, and provide habitat and travel corridors for wildlife.\n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>George Lake is an 80 acre lake located in Blue Earth County near the town of Marysburg. <br> \nA DNR-owned public access is located on the southern end of the lake off Blue Earth County Highway 27. George Lake has a maximum depth of 28 feet and is placed in Lake Class 30, which includes other Waterville Area lakes such as Kelly & Dudley Lake (Rice County), Roemhildts Lake (Le Sueur County), Steele Lake (Le Sueur County), and Sunfish Lake (Le Sueur County). George Lake is managed primarily for Largemouth Bass, Bluegill, and Black Crappie and secondarily for Northern Pike. The management plan calls for stocking Northern Pike adults annually at a rate of 3 pounds per acre (240 total) and Largemouth Bass, Bluegill, Black Crappie, and Northern Pike adults following evidence of a winterkill. Low dissolved oxygen levels were documented during the winter of 2013-2014 and trap nets set the following spring suggest the lake experienced a strong winterkill event. Bluegill, Black Crappie, Largemouth Bass, and Northern Pike adults were stocked in 2014 and 2015 to repopulate the lake. George Lake was surveyed the week of June 22, 2015 as part of a regular monitoring program conducted by the Minnesota DNR. This survey was intended to assess the fish community by deploying two gill nets and four trap nets and conducting spring nighttime boat electrofishing to target Largemouth Bass that are typically difficult to sample with net gears. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass <br> \nA 56 minute boat electrofishing sample was completed at night on May 20, 2015 and no Largemouth Bass were sampled. Since 1994, electrofishing catch rates have varied from 0/hour in 1994 and 2015 to 97.5/hour in 1995 with an average of 27.4/hour. No Largemouth Bass were sampled with gill or trap nets. It appears the Largemouth Bass population in George Lake was decimated by the winterkill in 2013-2014 and the stocked adults have yet to produce offspring to repopulate the lake. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill <br> \nA total of 136 Bluegills were sampled with trap nets for a catch rate of 34.0/net, indicating moderate to high numbers were present. Since 1970, catch rates have varied from 6.8/net in 1970 to 104.4/net in 1995 with an average of 59.2/net. Lengths ranged from 2.8 to 7.6 inches with an average of 3.7 inches. Only two fish were larger than 4.5 inches. An additional four Bluegills ranging from 3.7 to 3.9 inches were sampled with gill nets. Bluegills from both gears ranged from 1 to 5 years old with three year-classes present. One year old fish accounted for 99% of the sample. The Bluegill population in George Lake is in a state of recovery and dominated by small, young fish that are likely descendants of adults stocked following the 2013-2014 winterkill. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie <br> \nA total of 585 Black Crappies were sampled with trap nets for a catch rate of 146.3/net, which was an all-time high and indicated high numbers were present. Since 1970, catch rates have varied from 6.8/net in 1970 to 146.3/net in 2015 with an average of 36.0/net. Lengths ranged from 3.3 to 4.4 inches with an average of 3.9 inches. An additional six fish ranging from 4.1 to 4.5 inches were sampled with gill nets. Much like the Bluegill population, the Black Crappie population is in a state of recovery and is dominated by young fish produced after the 2013-2014 winterkill. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike <br> \nNorthern Pike were sampled at a high rate in 2015. A total of 39 fish were sampled with gill nets for a catch rate of 19.5/net, indicating high numbers were present and was the highest ever sampled in George Lake. Since 1970, catch rates varied from 1.0/net in 1995, 1997, and 2005 to 19.5/net in 2015 with an average of 4.1/net. Lengths ranged from 16.0 to 23.7 with an average of 18.5 inches. Three additional Northern Pike ranging from 18.9 to 20.1 inches were sampled with trap nets. Fish from both gears ranged from 1 to 3 years old with three year-classes present. One year old fish accounted for over 71% of the sample. The Northern Pike population in George Lake has responded well to stocking efforts following the 2013-2014 winterkill. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch <br> \nA total of 9 Yellow Perch were sampled with gill nets for a catch rate of 4.5/net, indicating moderate to high numbers were present. Since 1970, catch rates have varied from 0/net in 1970 and 2005 to 9.0/net in 1997 with an average of 4.2/net. Lengths ranged from 6.6 to 8.8 inches with an average of 7.7 inches. A single 8.4 inch Yellow Perch was also sampled with trap nets. Fish from both gears ranged from 2 to 4 years old with three year-classes present. Despite the strong winterkill of 2013-2014, Yellow Perch continue to persist in moderate numbers in George Lake. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Bullhead <br> \nA total of 43 Black Bullheads were sampled with gill nets for a catch rate of 21.5/net, indicating moderate to high numbers were present. Since 1970, catch rates have varied from 0.5/net in 1994 to 134.5/net in 2005 with an average of 29.5/net. Most of the fish sampled were less than 5.0 inches long and likely produced following the 2013-2014 winterkill. Black Bullhead numbers remain highly volatile in George Lake and likely benefited from the recent strong winterkill. <br> \n <br> \nOther Species <br> \nOther species sampled in 2015 include Pumpkinseed and hybrid sunfish. <br> \n <br> \nWater Quality Parameters <br> \nWater quality parameter measurements including secchi depth, water temperature, and dissolved oxygen readings were taken during the survey. At the time of this survey, secchi depth was 6.5 feet, indicating moderately clear water. Water temperatures and dissolved oxygen readings throughout the water column ranged from 72.5 degrees Fahrenheit and 8.8 ppm at the surface to 55.4 degrees Fahrenheit and 0.0 ppm at 25 feet. A thermocline appeared to be established around 13 feet. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers can play an important role in maintaining or improving a fish population by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for consumption, while encouraging the release of medium to large fish that may contribute to natural recruitment.  This practice helps maintain balance in the fish community and provides anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future.  Additionally, smaller fish often taste better and have fewer contaminants than larger, older fish from the same water body. <br> \n <br> \nShoreline property owners also play an important role in the overall health of an aquatic ecosystem, including the fish population.  Natural shorelines, including vegetation, woody debris, and bottom substrates, provide valuable habitat for fish and wildlife, help maintain water quality, and reduce bank erosion.  By leaving natural shorelines unaltered or restoring them to natural conditions, shoreline property owners are doing their part to maintain or improve a healthy ecosystem in the lake and protect the resource for future generations. <br> \n <br> \n-Sky Wigen, Fisheries Specialist  <br> \n</p>",

OLDS SAMPLED IN 1985.  BLG GROWTH IS CLOSE TO THE STATE AVERAGE AND SLOWS AFTER AGE 5. BLC WERE THE MOST ABUNDANT SPECIES IN GILL NETS IN 1985 AND 1990, AVERAGING 34.25/GILL NET BOTH YEARS.  BLC GROWTH WAS FAST IN 1985 COMPARED TO NOW, WITH AVERAGE GROWTH FOLLOWED BY SLOW GROWTH AFTER AGE 3.

PMK ABUNDANCE REMAINS STABLE, AVERAGING 5.00/TRAP NET (3.50/TRAP NET IN 1985).  PMK CONTINUE TO SHOW GOOD GROWTH.  WAE HAVE DECLINED FROM 25.67/GILL NET IN 1985 TO 1.50/GILL NET.  WAE ARE FROM THE 1979 YEAR CLASS, WHICH DID WELL FOLLOWING A WINTERKILL VACANCY.  WAE MANAGEMENT HAS BEEN DIS- CONTINUED IN FAVOR OF NOP AND LMB MANAGEMENT.  NOP ABUNDANCE REMAINS STABLE AVERAGING 2.00/GILL NET COMPARED TO 2.33/GILL NET IN 1985.  NOP CONTINUE TO EXHIBIT FAST GROWTH.  AGES 2,4, AND 5 SAMPLED COMPARED TO THE 1 AND 2 YR.

                "narrative": "<p>George Lake is an 80-acre lake located in Blue Earth County near the town of Marysburg. A DNR-owned public access is located on the southern end of the lake off Blue Earth County Highway 27. George Lake has a maximum depth of 28 feet with over 75% of the area less than 15 feet deep. George Lake is managed primarily for Black Crappies, Bluegills, and Largemouth Bass and secondarily for Northern Pike. The management plan calls for stocking Black Crappie, Bluegill, Northern Pike, and Largemouth Bass adults following winterkill events. Low dissolved oxygen levels were documented during the winter of 2013-2014 and spring trap netting revealed evidence of a strong winterkill. Adult fish of the four management species were stocked in 2014 and 2015 to repopulate the lake. George Lake is a Tier-2 Lake and surveyed as part of a regularly scheduled monitoring program every 6 years. The 2021 standard survey was conducted the week of 6 July 2021 using 3 gill nets, 6 trap nets, and 45 minutes of boat electrofishing.  <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappies were extremely abundant in 2021 with  304 sampled in gill nets for a rate of 101.3/net. Since 1994, Black Crappie catch rates have varied from 3.0/net to 101.3/net with an average of 37.1/net. The 2015 survey sampled few Black Crappies in the gill nets but 146.3/net in the trap nets. Black Crappies in 2021 ranged from 5.2 to 6.9 inches with an average of 6.0 inches. Another 158 Black Crappies, up to 7.2 inches, were sampled with the trap nets. Almost all Black Crappies were 7 years old from the 2014 year class. Growth was very poor with an average length of 5.2 inches at 5 years old. The adult Black Crappies stocked in 2014 created an abundant year class that unfortunately grew slowly and now offer little to the angling public. <br> \n <br> \nBluegills dominated the trap net catch in 2021. A total of 975 Bluegills were sampled for a catch rate of 162.5/net. Hyper-abundant Bluegill numbers were common from 1994-2021 with an average catch rate of 69.2/net during that period. Bluegill lengths in 2021 varied from 3.3 to 7.0 inches with an average of 6.0 inches. Approximately 45% of Bluegills sampled were 6 inches or longer. Bluegills from both gears ranged from 1 to 7 years old with 6 year classes present. The 2014 year class (7 years old) accounted for almost half the sample. Bluegill growth was slow with an average length of 4.4 inches at 3 years old. Like the Black Crappie population, the Bluegills produced in 2014 were abundant and slow growing in 2021. Hopefully they will reach a harvestable size in the coming years and a more balanced population will result. <br> \n <br> \nA total of 40 Largemouth Bass were sampled with boat electrofishing for a catch rate of 52.4/hour. No Largemouth Bass were sampled in 2015 because of the recent winterkill. Largemouth Bass lengths in 2021 ranged from 5.4 to 17.6 inches with an average of 12.1 inches. An additional fifteen Largemouth Bass up to 16.1 inches were sampled with the net gears. Largemouth Bass from both gears ranged from 1 to 11 years old with 10 year classes present. Multiple year classes were well represented, indicating consistent reproduction and recruitment. Largemouth Bass growth rate was moderate with an average length of 10.3 inches at 4 years old. The George Lake Largemouth Bass population should continue to offer a quality angling opportunity in the absence of winterkill and with an overabundant panfish population. <br> \n <br> \nJust 7 Northern Pike ranging from 18.4 to 34.8 inches were sampled with gill nets in 2021. The Northern Pike catch rate of 2.3/net was well below the 2015 catch rate of 19.5/net. Northern Pike ranged from 3 to 7 years old with 5 year classes present. Overall, Northern Pike numbers have regressed since the initial 2018 spike produced after the 2013-2014 winterkill and may be limited by suitable in-lake habitat for spawning. Duck Lake is in the Southern Northern Pike management zone. In order to harvest a Northern Pike, the fish must be over 24.0 inches in length.  The daily bag limit in this zone is 2 Northern Pike per day. <br> \nBlack Bullheads were also common in 2021 with a gill net catch rate of 31.7/net. Due to periodic winterkill events, Black Bullhead numbers have historically been erratic with as a many as 134.5/net sampled. Yellow Bullheads were also well represented in the 2021 sample with 20.0/gill net. As the lake moves further from the last winterkill, Black Bullhead numbers should wane while Yellow Bullheads should remain common. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled in 2021 include Pumpkinseed, Yellow Perch, and hybrid sunfish (Lepomis spp.). <br> \n <br> \nAnglers can play an important role in maintaining or improving a fish population by practicing selective harvest. Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for consumption, while encouraging the release of medium to large fish that may contribute to natural reproduction. This practice helps maintain balance in the fish populations and provides anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future. Additionally, smaller fish often taste better and have fewer contaminants than larger, older fish from the same water body. <br> \n <br> \nShoreline property owners also play an important role in the overall health of an aquatic ecosystem, including the fish population. Natural shorelines, including vegetation, woody debris, and bottom substrates, provide valuable habitat for fish and wildlife, help maintain water quality, and reduce bank erosion. Cattails and bulrushes are particularly beneficial for fish spawning, rearing, and feeding. By leaving natural shorelines unaltered or restoring them to natural conditions, shoreline property owners are doing their part to maintain or improve a healthy ecosystem in the lake and protect the resource for future generations. <br> \n <br> \n- Sky Wigen, Fisheries Specialist <br> \n</p>",

IT APPEARS A STRONG BLACK CRAPPIE POPULA- TION IS EMERGING IN GEORGE LAKE. FEW BLACK CRAPPIE WERE SAMPLED IN '81, 0.66/TRAPNET. IN '85, 6.50/ TRAPNET WERE CAPTURED ALONG WITH A STRONG I+ AGE CLASS IS PRESENT AND SHOULD HELP FILL IN THE VOID AS THE WALLEYE POPULATION DECLINES. NORTHERN PIKE HAVE REMAINED STABLE SINCE THE LAST SURVEY WITH A FAIR POPULATION PRESENT AVGING 2.33/NET. THE NORTHERN POPULATION IS NOW DOMINATED BY YOUNGER FISH, I AND II AGE CLASS FISH, COMPARED TO AN EVEN DISTRIBUTION OF I, II, AND III YR OLDS IN '81. WALLEYES ARE REPRESENTED BY A HIGH RELATIVE ABUN- BANCE OF LARGE WALLEYES AS INDICATED BY 25.67/GIL- LNET. WALLEYES SAMPLED ARE OF ONE YEAR CLASS ('79) AND ARE FROM FRY, FGL., AND YRL. STOCKINGS HARVES- TED FROM THE EAGLE LAKE REARING POND. APPARENTLY NO NATURAL RECRUITMENT HAS TAKEN PLACE AND WITH DISCONTINUED WALLEYE STOCKING, THE WALLEYE POPU- LATION IS EXPECTED TO DECLINE. FEW LARGEMOUTH BASS WERE CAPTURED, BUT YY BASS WERE WELL REPRESENTED IN SHORELINE SEINING. ALGLING REPORTS INDICATE FAIR LARGEMOUTH BASS FISHING. BLACK BULLHEADS HAVE SHOWN A SHARP DECLINE FROM 277.00/NET IN '81 TO 26.33/NET IN '85. OTHER FISH POPULATIONS YELLOW BULLHEAD, YELLOW PERCH, PUMPKINSEED, AND GOLDEN SHINER WERE SAMPLED IN RELATIVELY LOW NUMBERS AND REMAIN UNCHANGED SINCE THE LAST SURVEY.</p>",
