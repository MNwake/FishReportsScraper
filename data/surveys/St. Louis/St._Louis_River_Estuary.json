                "narrative": "<p>A muskellunge assessment was conducted on the upper portion of the St. Louis River Estuary from 04/28/97 through 05/02/97.  The assessment was a cooperative effort between the Minnesota and Wisconsin Departments of Natural Resources.  Muskellunge were sampled with standard Wisconsin trapnets (4x6 foot frame, 1 inch mesh and 75 foot lead) fished from shore and staked at both ends.  Water depth at the frame ranged from 2 to 4 feet and water temperature ranged from 49 to 56 degrees fahrenheit.  Trapnets were set at 14 locations between Mud Lake and the bay just upstream from Perch Lake, and were monitored every 24 hours.  Muskellunge were marked near the dorsal fin with numbered floy tags.  Tag numbers ranged from 07000 to 07056.     A total of 74 muskellunge were sampled during the assessment.  Trapnet catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) for muskellunge was 2.6 per lift and pounds per lift was 45.4.  The minimum, maximum and mean length of sampled muskellunge was 28.6, 45.5 and 38.2 inches.  Mean length of female muskellunge was 39.6 inches and mean length of male muskellunge was 34.5 inches.  Forty six sampled muskellunge were females, of which 15 were gravid, 27 were ripe, 3 were spent and 2 were unknown.  Twenty seven sampled muskellunge were males.  Eight year classes were identified from 73 aged muskellunge.  Muskellunge exceeded 30 inches at age V, 35 inches at age VII and 40 inches at age IX.     A total of 253 northern pike were sampled during the assessment.  Trapnet CPUE was 9.0 per lift and pounds per lift was 26.5.  The minimum, maximum and mean length of sampled northern pike was 13.2, 37.7 and 32.2 inches.  Mean length of female northern pike was 25.8 inches and mean length of male northern pike was 22.2 inches.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>The St. Louis River estuary has a surface area of 11,500 acres and extends from the Fond du Lac Dam to the Wisconsin Entry on Minnesota Point.  The estuary, which is entirely interstate water between Minnesota and Wisconsin, has 11,385 (99%) acres of littoral area and a maximum depth of approximately 35 feet.  The estuary is a heavily used water body due to its proximity to the cities of Duluth and Superior, and status as an international shipping port.  Impacts of international shipping have included the introduction of exotic species such as Eurasian ruffe, round goby, tubenose goby, white perch, spiny water flea, zebra mussel and New Zealand mud snail.  The fish pathogen viral hemorrhagic septicemia was identified in the estuary from fish collected in 2009.  Water quality improved dramatically after Western Lake Superior Sanitary District began treating point sources of domestic and commercial effluent from Cloquet and Duluth in 1979.  The fishery has changed substantially since treatment began. <br> \n <br> \nThe St. Louis River estuary has been actively managed with stocking of walleye, northern pike, muskellunge, lake sturgeon and black crappie since 1980.  Walleye, northern pike and muskellunge were stocked at a high rate from 1989 through 1993 in an effort to control Eurasian ruffe.  Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources has stocked muskellunge and lake sturgeon.  Walleye are managed with a minimum length for harvest of 15 inches and a bag limit of two.  Northern pike are managed with a bag limit of two.  Smallmouth bass are managed with a bag limit of five and a minimum length for harvest of 14 inches.  There is not a season for lake sturgeon and targeted angling is prohibited.  No commercial minnow harvest is allowed on the St. Louis River estuary and possession of alewife, Eurasian ruffe, round goby, tubenose goby and white perch is prohibited.  Use of smelt and whitefish collected from Lake Superior or the St. Louis River estuary as bait on inland waters is also prohibited. <br> \n <br> \nStocking of lake sturgeon has established 14 year-classes from 1983 through 2000.  A total of 3,185,700 fry and 136,405 fingerlings have been stocked.  Lake sturgeon abundance of 1.0 per gillnet lift was near the lower end of the range of catch rates since the early phase of the rehabilitation project in the mid 1980's.  Although the gillnet catch rate documented during the 2009 assessment was low, anglers are still reporting high catch rates.  Mean length of 32.1 inches for sampled lake sturgeon was the longest since sampling began. <br> \n <br> \nAnnual stocking of walleye fry, at a rate of at least 10% of the total number of eggs taken at the St. Louis River spawning station, was discontinued after 2007 when the station was eliminated due to the threat of viral hemorrhagic septicemia.  Walleye abundance of 6.4 per gillnet lift was average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type and at the upper end of the range from the previous 13 investigations.  Average size was 15.5 inches and growth was slow.  Age analysis revealed that age 3 and 4 walleye comprised 74% of the fish captured.  Average length at capture of age 4 walleye was 13.7 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike abundance of 1.3 per gillnet lift was below average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type and at the lower end of the range from the previous 13 investigations.  Average size of 21.1 inches was considered small but growth was fast.  Analysis of age distribution revealed a strong 2008 year-class and all year-classes from 2001 through 2008 represented. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch abundance of 2.8 per gillnet lift was below average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Average size of 7.7 was considered good and growth was fast.  Age analysis revealed strong 2005 and 2006 year-classes and all year-classes from 2003 through 2007 represented. <br> \n <br> \nChannel catfish abundance of 1.8 per lift was average compared to 15 previous investigations on the estuary.  Average size of 17.6 inches has remained relatively constant over the last six investigations after an initial increase in size starting in the early 1990's. <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species sampled include black crappie, bluegill, common carp, common shiner, freshwater drum, golden shiner, muskellunge, pumpkinseed, rock bass, shorthead redhorse, silver redhorse, smallmouth bass, white perch, white sucker and yellow bullhead. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>The St Louis River Estuary (SLRE) is 10,255-acres with 10,242 acres (99%) of littoral area and a maximum depth of 55 feet.  The SLRE forms the state boundary between Duluth, Minnesota and Superior, Wisconsin.  The SLRE was assessed during the spring of 2018 to evaluate the current Muskellunge fishery, contributions of natural reproduction to the SLRE population, and to complete a population estimate of Muskellunge.  The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MNDNR) and Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources (WIDNR) stocked a total of 103,610 Muskellunge in the SLRE from 1983 to 2005.  Year-classes became established for all years except 1996 and 1998.  The MNDNR stocked Leech Lake-strain Muskellunge except when Tiger Muskellunge were stocked in 1988, 1989 and 1990.  The WIDNR stocked only Chippewa Flowage-strain Muskellunge.  Stocking was suspended after 2005 to provide a baseline of natural reproduction and recruitment of Muskellunge in the SLRE.  If the SLRE can sustain an adequately sized Muskellunge population through natural reproduction, resource managers and local stakeholders can allocate resources elsewhere to help maintain, sustain, or improve the fishery (e.g., habitat protection and identification). Two thousand one hundred and eighty-nine Leech Lake-strain Muskellunge were stocked in 2015, with the knowledge that they would not impact assessments of natural recruitment, due to surplus Muskellunge in the MNDNR hatchery system. Catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) calculations reported should not be compared across years due to changes in the length of assessments and in the number of nets set.   <br> \n <br> \nThe MNDNR and WIDNR conducted a cooperative special assessment of Muskellunge on the St. Louis River Estuary from April 30 through May 17, 2018 using standard large-frame (5 x 6 ft.) trapnets.   In total, 229 Muskellunge were sampled from the St. Louis River Estuary with 312 net nights of effort for a catch rate of 0.7 per trapnet set.  This was a much higher effort than in most past surveys.   Nets that did not sample fish properly were removed from analysis, so reported numbers may not match the numbers in the tables.  One additional Muskellunge was captured while doing exploratory electrofishing and is also reported here.  Each Muskellunge was examined for a PIT tag.  If none was found, a PIT tag was implanted by the dorsal fin.  In addition to Muskellunge, biological data were also collected on Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, and Lake Sturgeon. <br> \n <br> \nAverage length of Muskellunge collected in 2018 was 40.4 inches.  Maximum length observed was 52.5 inches. <br> \n <br> \nSeveral adult (greater than 30 inches) Muskellunge population estimates were calculated using data collected during this assessment.  Estimates ranged from 805 to 1,139 adult Muskellunge which equates to 0.08 to 0.11 adult Muskellunge per St. Louis River Estuary acre.   <br> \n <br> \nGenetic samples were analyzed for 159 individuals to date. Approximately 30% (53) of the analyzed individuals were of Leech Lake genetic origin and 33% (53) were of Chippewa Flowage origin.   Thirty-seven percent (59) were hybrids with a mix of Leech Lake and Chippewa Flowage origin. <br> \n <br> \nSixty Muskellunge captured during the 2017 assessment were surgically implanted with hydro-acoustic tracking tags to monitor their movement in the SLRE as well as into Lake Superior.  Methods and full results of the first year and a half of this movement study can found in Erin Schaeffer's graduate thesis from the University of Minnesota-St. Paul (in prep.), though some details are discussed here. <br> \n <br> \nA total of 24 of 60 (40%) individual Muskellunge spent time in Lake Superior between April and September 2018 with most of these individuals being Leech Lake-strain.  Approximated 25% of all tagged Muskellunge spent a month or more in Lake Superior.  The vast majority of Muskellunge that spent a month or more in Lake Superior were of Leech Lake-strain.  All except one were in or near the SLRE at the end of September when the data was collected (Schaeffer, in prep). <br> \n <br> \nThis population appears to be biologically self-sustaining as documented by the number of Muskellunge that are from naturally produced year classes, determined during the 2017 assessment, and the number of Muskellunge of hybrid genetic origin that were not stocked documented in the 2017 and 2018 assessments.  However, with the relatively low abundance of Muskellunge, especially of those that stay in the SLRE, a supplemental stocking program is planned to begin in 2019. <br> \n <br> \nOther Species <br> \n <br> \nA total of 2,758 Northern Pike were captured during the 2018 assessment.  Mean length was 22.7 and maximum length was 41.0 inches.  Over ten percent of the sampled population was over 30 inches long, providing an opportunity to catch large Northern Pike in the SLRE. <br> \n <br> \nA total of 26 Lake Sturgeon were captured during the 2018 assessment.  Lake Sturgeon mean length was 40.4 inches and the maximum length was 53.2 inches. One additional Lake Sturgeon was captured while doing exploratory electrofishing and is also reported here.  All captured Lake Sturgeon were checked for PIT tags and a PIT tag was applied if none were detected.   <br> \n <br> \nThree Largemouth Bass were captured during the 2018 assessment.  Mean length was 16.6 inches and ranged from 14.8 to 17.8 inches. <br> \n <br> \nMany other species were captured during this survey, but were immediately released and are not reported here. <br> \n</p>",

Water quality in the estuary began improving in the 1980's paving the way for reintroduction.  Reintroduction and evaluation of Lake Sturgeon began in 1983 and has been a cooperative effort between Minnesota and Wisconsin Departments of Natural Resources.  A total of 13 year-classes were stocked from 1983 through 2000.  During the mid-2000's, biologists began observing small numbers of Lake Sturgeon congregating at available spawning habitat in the upper reaches of the SLRE, signaling that some stocked year-classes were beginning to mature.  In 2011, Fond du Lac Natural Resources biologists captured the first Lake Sturgeon fry below the Fond du Lac dam confirming natural reproduction had occurred.     <br> \n <br> \nA total of 267 individual Lake Sturgeon were sampled in 2019.   Minimum and maximum length of sampled Lake Sturgeon was 35.6 and 63.4 inches, and average length was 47.5 inches.  Catch-and-release angling (open mid-June through mid-April annually) for Lake Sturgeon in the SLRE should be good in 2019 and beyond as the population continues to recover.  <br> \n  <br> \nFrom 2016-2018, 139 Lake Sturgeon were surgically implanted with acoustic transmitters as part of a cooperative project with the University of Wisconsin Stevens Point and the WI DNR.  This research enables the tracking of individual fish and is helping refine uncertainties related to spawning movements and timing. In 2019, three additional females were surgically implanted with acoustic tags.  An array of acoustic receivers that log data about tagged fish movements is managed throughout the estuary and the near-shore waters of Lake Superior to monitor movement through the estuary and into Lake Superior.  Fish that migrate to other regions of Lake Superior and are detected on other jurisdictions' acoustic arrays are reported back to MN DNR enabling a broad-scale interpretation of Lake Sturgeon migratory behavior.  Movement patterns have demonstrated both resident and migratory life history strategies.  The movement patterns of resident sturgeon suggest that they frequently select for the complex upriver habitat with access to large shallow flats.  Migratory individuals are frequently detected along the south shore of Lake Superior extending to the Keweenaw Peninsula of Michigan and northward to Black Bay, Ontario.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>The St. Louis River Estuary (SLRE) is 10,255-acres with 10,242 acres (99%) of littoral area and a maximum depth of 55 feet.  The SLRE forms the state boundary between Duluth, Minnesota and Superior, Wisconsin.  The SLRE was assessed during the spring of 2023 to evaluate the current Muskellunge fishery, contributions of natural reproduction and stocked individuals to the SLRE population, and to complete a population estimate of adult Muskellunge.   <br> \n <br> \nMuskellunge are indigenous to the SLRE, but were extirpated due to poor water quality and habitat destruction in the mid-19th century.  Water quality began to improve after the Western Lake Superior Sanitation District began treating industrial and municipal effluent from Cloquet and Duluth in 1979.  Long-range goals were cooperatively agreed to by the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MN DNR) and Wisconsin Departments of Natural Resources (WI DNR) to re-establish and maintain Muskellunge populations in the SLRE.  Re-introductory stocking efforts of Muskellunge into the SLRE were initiated in 1983.  Stocking was suspended in 2006 to provide a baseline of natural reproduction and to assess natural recruitment of Muskellunge in the SLRE.  This research demonstrated consistent natural reproduction and recruitment of Muskellunge in the SLRE, but supplementary stocking efforts are occurring to provide enhanced angling opportunities.  Recently, the Muskellunge stocking has shifted to utilizing genetic strains that are native to the Great Lakes, though surplus Leech Lake strain fingerlings may be stocked occasionally.    <br> \n <br> \nThe MN DNR and WI DNR conducted a cooperative special assessment of Muskellunge on the SLRE from May 1st through May 18, 2023 using standard large-frame (5 x 6 ft.) trapnets.   In total, 322 Muskellunge were sampled from the St. Louis River Estuary with 359 net nights of effort.  Muskellunge recaptured multiple times during the survey were excluded from subsequent analyses.  Each Muskellunge was examined for a PIT tag.  If none was found, a PIT tag was implanted by the dorsal fin.  In addition to Muskellunge, biological data were also collected on Largemouth and Smallmouth Bass, Lake Sturgeon, Black Crappie, Bluegill and some Pumpkinseed Sunfish.   <br> \n <br> \nAverage length of Muskellunge collected was 41.4 inches.  Maximum length of 53.0 inches was a historic high for the SLRE, which had previously ranged from 48.0 inches in 1997 to 52.8 inches in 2017. The percentage of adult Muskellunge that exceeded memorable size (42 inches) was 46%, while the proportion that exceeded trophy size (50 inches) was 6%. <br> \n <br> \nSeveral adult (greater than 30 inches) Muskellunge population estimates were calculated using data collected during this assessment.  Estimates ranged from 747 to 960 adult Muskellunge which equates to 0.07 to 0.09 adult Muskellunge per SLRE acre.  Five fish from the 2015 stocked year-class were recaptured during the 2023 spawning assessment, indicating some fish did recruit to the fishery from that event.  The more recent stocked year-classes (2019 and 2021) were too young to be assessed for recruitment to the spawning population in 2023.   <br> \n <br> \nOther Species <br> \nA total of 4,262 Black Crappie were also captured during the 2023 spring Muskellunge trap net survey.  The trap net catch rate of Black Crappie was 11.9 per lift.  Black Crappie mean length was 9.5 inches and maximum length was 14.1 inches. <br> \n <br> \nA total of 346 Smallmouth Bass were captured resulting in a trap net catch rate of about 1.0 per lift.  Smallmouth Bass mean length was 16.7 inches and ranged from 7.2 to 20.2 inches.  Eleven Largemouth Bass were also captured.  Mean length was 16.6 inches and ranged from 14.8 to 17.8 inches. <br> \n <br> \nA total of 209 Bluegill were captured during the 2023 assessment resulting in a trap net catch rate of 0.7 per lift.  Bluegill mean length was 6.6 inches and ranged from 3.4 to 9.8 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nA total of 79 Lake Sturgeon were also captured.  Lake Sturgeon mean length was 45.3 inches and the maximum length was 59.8 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nA subsample of Pumpkinseed Sunfish were also captured and measured during this assessment.  All other species were identified to species and recorded as unmeasured catch by net.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Stocking of fingerling walleye and adult northern pike was discontinued in 1994.  A total of 179,756 fingerling walleye and 77,641 adult northern pike were stocked into the St. Louis Bay from 1989 through 1993.  It does not appear that stocking of walleye and northern pike has significantly increased their catch rates in assessment netting.  Walleye and northern pike gillnet catch rates remained between 1.5 and 5.0 per lift from 1989 through 1998.  The open nature of the St. Louis Bay system may have confounded efforts to artificially increase predator biomass.     Eurasian ruffe gillnet abundance indices continued to decline from a high of 16.3 per lift in 1992 to 0.6 per lift in 1998.  Mean length was 5.4 inches and length at the beginning of the third year was 5.0 inches.       Although abundance of yellow perch and bullhead has declined dramatically since 1986, species diversity and percent distribution of catch within the St. Louis Bay has improved.  In 1986, 68% of gillnet catch by number was comprised of yellow perch and black bullhead.  In 1998, walleye, northern pike, lake sturgeon and white sucker all comprised at least 10% of the gillnet catch by number.  Channel catfish, rock bass and yellow perch were also well represented.  Despite recent invasion of exotic species species such as Eurasian ruffe, zebra mussel, white perch, round goby and spiney waterflea, total catch has become more evenly distributed between species.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Sturgeon were extirpated from the St. Louis River Estuary and Western Lake Superior in the early to mid 1900's due to overharvest and habitat and water quality degradation.  Water quality in the estuary began improving in the 1980's paving the way for reintroduction.  Reintroduction and evaluation of Lake Sturgeon began in 1983 and has been a cooperative effort between Minnesota and Wisconsin Departments of Natural Resources.  A total of 13 year-classes were established by stocking from 1983 through 2000.  In 2011, Fond du Lac Natural Resources biologists captured the first Lake Sturgeon fry below the Fond du Lac dam confirming natural reproduction. <br> \n <br> \nA total of 325 individual Lake Sturgeon were sampled in 2018.   Minimum and maximum length of sampled Lake Sturgeon was 35.8 and 66.3 inches, and average length was 48.1 inches.  Catch-and-release angling (open mid-June through mid-April annually) for Lake Sturgeon in the St. Louis River should be good in 2019 and beyond as the population continues to recover.   <br> \n <br> \nThis was the third year that acoustic tags were implanted into Lake Sturgeon in the St. Louis River Estuary as part of a cooperative project with the University of Wisconsin Stevens Point.  A total of 34 sturgeon were surgically implanted with acoustic tags with battery lives of 10 years.  In 2016 and 2017, 105 other Lake Sturgeon were surgically implanted with acoustic transmitters bringing the total number of acoustically tagged fish to 139.  This will enable tracking of individual fish and spawning movements and timing.  An array of acoustic receivers is managed throughout the estuary and the near-shore waters of Lake Superior to monitor movement through the estuary and into Lake Superior.  Movement patterns have demonstrated both resident and migratory life history strategies.  The movement patterns of resident sturgeon suggest that they frequently select for the complex upriver habitat with access to large shallow flats.  Migratory individuals are frequently detected along the south shore of Lake Superior extending to the Keweenaw Peninsula of Michigan.    <br> \n</p>",

A total 178,468 fingerling walleye and 68,500 adult northern pike were stocked into the St. Louis Bay from 1989 to 1993.  It does not appear that walleye and northern pike stocking has increased their catch rates in assessment netting.  Walleye and northern pike gillnet catch rates remained between 1.5 and 5.0 from 1987 to 1994.  The open nature of the St. Louis Bay system may have confounded efforts to artificially increase predator biomass.     A population assessment will be conducted in 1995.  This assessment will help to further evaluate the affects of top-down management strategy used to control the European ruffe within the St. Louis Bay.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>The St. Louis River estuary has a surface area of 11,500 acres and extends from the Fond du Lac Dam to the Wisconsin Entry on Minnesota Point.  The estuary, which is entirely interstate water between Minnesota and Wisconsin, has 11,385 (99%) acres of littoral area and a maximum depth of approximately 35 feet.  The estuary is a heavily used water body due to its proximity to the cities of Duluth and Superior, and status as an international shipping port.  Impacts of international shipping have included the introduction of exotic species such as Eurasian ruffe, round goby, tubenose goby, white perch, spiney water flea, zebra mussel and New Zealand mud snail.  The fish pathogen viral hemorrhagic septicemia was identified in the estuary from fish collected in 2009.  Water quality improved dramatically after Western Lake Superior Sanitary District began treating point sources of domestic and commercial effluent from Cloquet and Duluth in 1979.  The fishery has changed substantially since treatment began.  Although the 2012 investigation was scheduled as a population assessment, with inclusion of historical gill and trapnets, only the trapnets were completed.  Trapnet index nets, which have been set seven times between 1983 and 1992, have only been set once since then (2006).  The flooding of late June caused very poor conditions on the estuary, which resulted in a decision to not complete the index gillnets.  Due to technical difficulties related to the downloading of data from the field computer to the lake survey module, data from nets 16 through 22 were lost.  Nets 16 through 22 correlate to the area from just above Spirit Lake to Rask Bay (uppermost set).  Because these locations represent some of the best panfish habitat in the estuary, the results contained in this report are not representative of previous investigations.\n\nSixteen fish species were sampled in a total of 15 trapnets, which was the same species diversity documented from trapnets set during the 2006 population assessment.  The most abundant species sampled were silver redhorese, black crappie and pumpkinseed sunfish, which had a trapnet catch rate of 3.9, 3.3 and 2.1 per lift, respectively.  Other relatively abundant species were shorthead redhorse, rock bass, black bullhead, yellow perch and northern pike, which had a trapnet catch rate of 1.7, 1.6, 1.5, 1.4 and 1.1 per lift, respectively.  All other sampled species had catch rates below 1.0 per lift.  Mean length of black crappie, northern pike and yellow perch was 7.6, 22.2 and 8.0 inches, respectively.  Scale samples were collected but not aged for this investigation due to low sample size and aging information scheduled to be analyzed for these species from the 2013 spawning muskellunge assessment.</p>",

River flow ranged from 723 to 1900 cfs, which are some of the lowest flows seen historically during the spawning run.  Water temperatures ranged from 39 to 57oF during the spawning run.  A report summarizing creel data and population estimates for 2015 will be available in spring 2017. <br> \n <br> \nMale Walleye averaged about 19 inches long with females larger at 24.5 inches on average.  High numbers of males present at the beginning and end of sampling indicate that males show up to the spawning area before females and leave after females.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>The St. Louis River Estuary (SLRE) has a surface area of 10,255 acres and extends from the Fond du Lac Dam to the Wisconsin Entry from Lake Superior on Minnesota Point.  The Estuary, which is entirely interstate water between Minnesota and Wisconsin, has 10,242 (99%) acres of littoral area and a maximum depth of approximately 34 feet.   <br> \n <br> \nTwenty-one stations were sampled with overnight gillnet sets between June 22 and July 2, 2015 to monitor gamefish populations, evaluate the Lake Sturgeon rehabilitation program, and gather information for other fish species.  Twenty-one fish species were collected in this assessment. The most abundant species collected were Walleye, Yellow Perch, Shorthead Redhorse, Channel Catfish, and White Perch. <br> \n <br> \nOne-hundred ninety-seven Walleye were collected during the 2015 assessment.  Walleye abundance of 9.38 per net night was above average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type and was the highest recorded on the SLRE during the previous 18 assessments.  Average size was 12.9 inches which was lower than 2014 (13.9 inches).  Age analysis revealed strong 2012 and 2013 year-classes which contributed to the smaller average Walleye length.  The proportional stock density (PSD) for Walleye during this assessment was 23 which is below our goal of 50.  This is likely due to the strong 2012 and 2013 year-classes and PSD should increase as the fish in these young age-classes continue to grow.  Also, tags from the 2015 Walleye population estimate study were found in seven captured individuals.  Results of this study can be found in the St. Louis River Estuary Walleye population estimate report.   <br> \n <br> \nThree Lake Sturgeon were collected during the 2015 assessment.   No Lake Sturgeon had a PIT tag indicating they were not collected in a previous assessment.  The Lake Sturgeon catch rate (0.14 per net night) was the lowest (tied with 2014) since the early phase of the rehabilitation project in the mid 1980's (historic range: 0.3 to 6.5 per net night).  Although this is below the long range goal listed in the management plan, this was expected because most Lake Sturgeon collected by gill net are juveniles and no stocking has occurred for 14 years. Gill net CPUE during this assessment is not likely a good indicator of the SLRE Lake Sturgeon population.  The estimated ages of these three Lake Sturgeon are likely to be between 6 and 12 years old and from naturally reproduced year classes.  <br> \n <br> \nFifty-eight Channel Catfish were collected in 2015.  Channel catfish abundance of 2.8 per net night was average compared to previous investigations on the SLRE.  Average size has remained relatively constant after an initial increase in size starting in the early 1990's.   <br> \n <br> \nForty-nine Northern Pike were collected during the 2015 assessment.  Northern pike abundance of 2.3 per net night was average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type and average compared to previous investigations (0.8-3.8).  Average size was 18.8 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nThirty-six Black Crappie were collected in 2015.  Black Crappie abundance of 1.7 per net night was average compared when compared with previous investigations.  <br> \n <br> \nSeventy Yellow Perch were collected during the 2015 assessment.  Yellow perch abundance of 3.3 per net night was below average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type, and at the lower end of the range (1.1-7.6) from previous investigations.  <br> \n <br> \nThe other fish species sampled were Black Bullhead, Black Crappie, Brook Trout, Common Carp, Eurasian Ruffe, Freshwater Drum, Golden Shiner, Lake Sturgeon, Longnose Sucker, Muskellunge, Northern Pike, Rainbow Smelt, Rock Bass, Silver Redhorse, Smallmouth Bass, and White Sucker. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>The St. Louis River Estuary (SLRE) has a surface area of 10,255 acres and extends from the Fond du Lac Dam to the Wisconsin Entry from Lake Superior on Minnesota Point.  The Estuary, which is entirely interstate water between Minnesota and Wisconsin, has 10,242 (99%) acres of littoral area and a maximum depth of approximately 55 feet.   <br> \n <br> \nTwenty-one stations were sampled with overnight gillnet sets between June 25 and July 2, 2018 to monitor gamefish populations, evaluate the Lake Sturgeon rehabilitation program, and gather information for other fish species.  Twenty fish species were collected in this assessment. The most abundant species collected were Walleye, Channel Catfish, Yellow Perch, Shorthead Redhorse, River Ruffe, and Black Crappie. <br> \n <br> \nOne hundred thirty-five Walleye were collected during the 2018 assessment.  Walleye abundance of 6.4 per net night was slightly below average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type and was above average on the SLRE when compared to the previous 20 assessments.  Average length was 14.5 inches.  Age analysis revealed a strong 2013 year-class is the significant driver of this average length.   <br> \n <br> \nOne Lake Sturgeon was collected during the 2018 assessment, and it did not contain a tag from previous assessments.  The Lake Sturgeon catch rate (0.05 per net night) was the lowest since the early phase of the rehabilitation project in the mid 1980's (historic range: 0.1 to 6.5 per net night).  Although this is below the long range goal listed in the management plan, this was expected because most Lake Sturgeon collected by gill net are juveniles and no stocking has occurred for 17 years.  Increases in future natural reproduction and additional planned introductory stocking should result in increased gillnet catch.  The estimated age was less than five years old and was a product of natural reproduction.   <br> \n <br> \nSixty-six Channel Catfish were collected in 2018.  Channel Catfish abundance of 3.1 per net night was the fifth highest catch rate recorded when compared to previous investigations on the SLRE.  Average size was 13.5 inches. <br> \n <br> \nTwenty-two Northern Pike were collected during the 2018 assessment.  Northern Pike abundance of 1.1 per net night was below average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type and average compared to previous investigations on the SLRE (0.8-3.8).  Average size was 21.8 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nTwenty-four Black Crappie were collected in 2018.  Black Crappie abundance of 1.1 per net night was above average compared with previous investigations. Average size was 8.1 inches <br> \n <br> \nSixty-two Yellow Perch were collected during the 2018 assessment.  Yellow Perch abundance of 3.0 per net night was below average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type, and average compared to previous investigations on the SLRE (1.1-7.6).   Length-at-age analysis suggests above average growth of Yellow Perch in the SLRE when compared to other Duluth area lakes.  Average size was 7.9 inches. <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species sampled were Burbot, Common Carp, Freshwater Drum, Muskellunge, River Ruffe, Rock Bass, Shorthead Redhorse, Silver Redhorse, Smallmouth Bass, Tadpole Madtom, White Bass, White Perch, White Sucker, and Yellow Bullhead. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

The average length of Walleye was 21 inches and the largest Walleye was 30 inches in length. <br> \nDorsal spines were collected and aged by the Wisconsin DNR.  The oldest Walleye was a 25 year old female.  As seen in previous years during the summer gill net surveys the 2012 and 2013 year-classes are still strong. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>The St. Louis River Estuary (SLRE) has a surface area of 10,255 acres and extends from the Fond du Lac Dam to the Wisconsin Entry from Lake Superior on Minnesota Point.  The Estuary, which is entirely interstate water between Minnesota and Wisconsin, has 10,242 (99%) acres of littoral area and a maximum depth of approximately 55 feet.   <br> \n <br> \nTwenty-one stations were sampled with overnight gillnet sets between June 24 and July 1, 2019 to monitor gamefish populations, evaluate the Lake Sturgeon rehabilitation program, and gather information for other fish species.  Twenty fish species were collected in this assessment. The most abundant species collected were Walleye, Shorthead Redhorse, River Ruffe, Yellow Perch, Channel Catfish and Northern Pike. <br> \n <br> \nOne hundred ninety Walleye were collected during the 2019 assessment.  Walleye abundance of 9.1 per net night was average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type and was above average on the SLRE when compared to the previous 20 assessments.  Average length was 15.5 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nTwo Lake Sturgeon were collected during the 2019 assessment, and they did not contain a tag from previous assessments.  The Lake Sturgeon catch rate (0.1 per net night) was near the lowest since the early phase of the rehabilitation project in the mid 1980's (historic range: 0.05 to 6.5 per net night).  Although this is below the long range goal listed in the management plan, this was expected because most Lake Sturgeon collected by gill net are juveniles and no stocking has occurred for 17 years.  Increases in future natural reproduction and additional planned introductory stocking should result in increased gillnet catch.  The estimated age of one Lake Sturgeon was less than five years old and was a product of natural reproduction. The other Lake Sturgeon was likely the product of a stocked year-class.  <br> \n <br> \nForty Channel Catfish were collected in 2019.  Channel Catfish abundance of 1.9 per net night was slightly below average when compared to the previous 20 investigations on the SLRE.  Average size was 14.7 inches. <br> \n <br> \nThirty-six Northern Pike were collected during the 2019 assessment.  Northern Pike abundance of 1.7 per net night was below average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type and average compared to previous investigations on the SLRE (0.8-3.8).  Average size was 19.4 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nTwenty-five Black Crappie were collected in 2019.  Black Crappie abundance of 1.2 per net night was above average compared with previous investigations. Length-at-age analysis suggests average growth of Black Crappie in the SLRE when compared to other Duluth area lakes.  Average size was 8.4 inches. <br> \n <br> \nFifty-nine Yellow Perch were collected during the 2019 assessment.  Yellow Perch abundance of 2.8 per net night was below average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type, and average compared to previous investigations on the SLRE (1.1-7.6).  Average size was 7.8 inches. <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species sampled were Alewife, Black Bullhead, Burbot, Freshwater Drum, Muskellunge, Rock Bass, Silver Redhorse, Smallmouth Bass, Stonecat, White Perch, White Sucker, and Yellow Bullhead. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>The St. Louis Bay is a 11,500 acre estuary that extends from the Fond du Lac dam to the Wisconsin Entry on Minnesota Point.  The St. Louis Bay, which is entirely interstate water between Wisconsin and Minnesota, has 11,385 (99%) acres of littoral area and a maximum depth of approximately 35 feet.  The Bay is a heavily used water body due to its proximity to the cities of Duluth and Superior, and status as an international shipping port.  Impacts of international shipping have included the introduction of exotic species such as Eurasian ruffe, round goby, tubenose goby, white perch, spiny water flea and zebra mussel.  Water quality improved dramatically after Western Lake Superior Sanitary District began treating point sources for domestic and commercial effluent from Cloquet and Duluth in 1979.  The fishery has changed significantly since treatment began.     The St. Louis Bay has been actively managed with stocking of walleye, northern pike, muskellunge, lake sturgeon and black crappie since 1980.  Walleye, northern pike and muskellunge were stocked at a high rate from 1989 through 1993 in an effort to control Eurasian ruffe.  Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources has also stocked muskellunge and lake sturgeon.  Walleye are managed with a minimum length for harvest of 15 inches and a bag limit of two.  Northern pike are managed with a bag limit of two.  Smallmouth bass are managed with a bag limit of five and a minimum length for harvest of 14 inches.  There is a no kill regulation for lake sturgeon.  No commercial minnow harvest is allowed on the St. Louis Bay and possession of alewife, Eurasian ruffe, round goby, tubenose goby and white perch is prohibited.     Filamentous algae was very abundant during the 2003 investigation.  Gillnet efficiency was reduced due to fouling of nets by algae.  Conclusions drawn from the 2003 assessment should be applied with caution.     Lake sturgeon stocking has established 14 year classes from 1983 through 2000.  A total of 3,185,700 fry and 136,405 fingerlings have been stocked.  Lake sturgeon abundance of 1.5 per gillnet lift was near the bottom of the range for 13 previous investigations.  Mean length of 22.6 inches was the largest compared to 13 previous investigations.       Walleye fry are stocked annually at a rate of at least 10% of the total number of eggs taken at the St. Louis River spawning station.  Walleye abundance of 4.2 per gillnet lift was average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Mean length of 14.3 inches was average.  Growth was slow with length at age four of 13.6 inches.  Age analysis revealed strong 1999 and 2001 year-classes and all year classes from 1994 through 2002 represented.     A total of 38,324 Leech Lake strain muskellunge fingerlings have been stocked from 1988 through 2002.  A total of three muskellunge were captured during the 2003 investigation.  Mean length was 20.3 inches.     Northern pike abundance of 1.7 was slightly below average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Mean length of 20.9 inches was averge.  Growth was also average with a length at age four of 24.0 inches.  Age analysis revealed a strong 2001 year-class and seven year-classes represented from 1995 through 2002.     Yellow perch abundance of 1.3 per gillnet lift was below average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Mean length of 7.3 inches was average.  Growth was fast with length at age IV of 9.2 inches.  Age analysis revealed a strong 2001 year-class and five year-classes represented from 1997 through 2002.     Eurasian ruffe abundance of 1.3 per gillnet lift was near the low end of the range for 10 investigations since they became established.  Mean length was 5.4 inches.  Length at age four was 5.3 inches.  Age analysis revealed a strong 2000 year-class and no fish older than age four.     Channel catfish abundance of 0.5 per gillnet lift was below average compared to 13 previous investigations.  Mean length of 17.5 inches was large compared to previous investigations.     Other fish species sampled included black crappie, freshwater drum, rock bass, shorthead redhorse, silver redhorse, smallmouth bass, tadpole madtom, white perch, white sucker and yellow bullhead.  Only rock bass and white sucker were sampled at a rate greater than 1.0 per gillnet lift.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>The St. Louis River Estuary (SLRE) has a surface area of 10,255 acres and extends from the Fond du Lac Dam to the Wisconsin Entry from Lake Superior on Minnesota Point.  The Estuary, which is entirely interstate water between Minnesota and Wisconsin, has 10,242 (99%) acres of littoral area and a maximum depth of approximately 34 feet.   <br> \n <br> \nTwenty-one stations were sampled with overnight gillnet sets between June 27 and July 8, 2016 to monitor the gamefish populations, evaluate the Lake Sturgeon rehabilitation program, and gather information for other fish species.  Eighteen fish species were collected in this assessment. The most abundant species collected were Walleye, Channel Catfish, River Ruffe, Yellow Perch, and Shorthead Redhorse. <br> \n <br> \nTwo hundred thirty Walleye were collected during the 2016 assessment.  Walleye abundance of 10.95 per net night was above average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type and was the highest recorded on the SLRE during the previous 18 assessments.  Average size was 13.19 inches which was smaller than average (15.1 inches).  Age analysis revealed strong 2012 and 2013 year-classes which contributed to the smaller average Walleye length.  Tags from the 2015 Walleye population estimate study were found in five captured individuals.  Results of this study can be found in the St. Louis River Estuary 2015 Creel Study 4 Report (Varian, 2017 in review).   <br> \n <br> \nThree Lake Sturgeon were collected during the 2016 assessment, and none contained tags from previous assessments.  The Lake Sturgeon catch rate (0.14 per net night) was the lowest (tied with 2014 and 2015) since the early phase of the rehabilitation project in the mid 1980's (historic range: 0.3 to 6.5 per net night).  Although this is below the long range goal listed in the management plan, this was expected because most Lake Sturgeon collected by gill net are juveniles and no stocking has occurred for 14 years.  Increases in future natural reproduction should result in increased gillnet catch.  The estimated ages were between 6 and 12 years old for two larger sturgeon and less than five for the smallest individual. All three Lake Sturgeon captured were likely from naturally reproduced year classes.  <br> \n <br> \nOne hundred forty-two Channel Catfish were collected in 2016.  Channel catfish abundance of 6.8 per net night was then highest catch rate recorded when compared to previous investigations on the SLRE.    Seventy-four percent of all Channel Catfish captured were from the 2012 year class.  Average size has remained relatively constant after an initial increase in size starting in the early 1990's.   <br> \n <br> \nForty-three Northern Pike were collected during the 2016 assessment.  Northern pike abundance of 2.0 per net night was average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type and average compared to previous investigations (0.8-3.8).  Average size was 19.8 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nNine Black Crappie were collected in 2016.  Black Crappie abundance of 0.43 per net night was average compared with previous investigations.  <br> \n <br> \nFifty-three Yellow Perch were collected during the 2016 assessment.  Yellow perch abundance of 2.5 per net night was below average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type, and at the lower end of the range (1.1-7.6) of previous investigations.  <br> \n <br> \nThe other fish species sampled were Alewife, Black Crappie, Freshwater Drum, Lake Sturgeon, Longnose Sucker, Northern Pike, Pumpkinseed, Rainbow Smelt, Rock Bass, Silver Redhorse, Smallmouth Bass, White Perch, and White Sucker. <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nLiterature Cited: <br> \n <br> \nVarian, A. 2017.

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Sturgeon were extirpated from the St. Louis River Estuary and Western Lake Superior in the early to mid 1900's due to overharvest and habitat and water quality degradation.  Water quality in the estuary began improving in the 1980's paving the way for reintroduction.  Reintroduction and evaluation of Lake Sturgeon began in 1983 and has been a cooperative effort between Minnesota and Wisconsin Departments of Natural Resources.  A total of 13 year-classes were established by stocking from 1983 through 2000.  Lake Sturgeon introductions prior to 1995 were Wolf River strain, which is a tributary to Lake Michigan.  After 1995 Sturgeon River strain, which is a tributary to Lake Superior, were stocked.  Additionally 290 Bad River, a Lake Superior tributary, sturgeon were stocked in 1988.  In 2011 Fond du Lac Natural Resources biologists captured the first Lake Sturgeon fry below the Fond du Lac dam confirming natural reproduction. <br> \n <br> \nA total of 231 individual Lake Sturgeon were sampled in 2016, of which 223 received new PIT tags.   Minimum and maximum length of sampled Lake Sturgeon was 32 and 65 inches, and mean length was 47 inches.  The sturgeon measuring 65 inches is the largest sturgeon we've sampled to date (by 6 inches), and likely from one of the first stocking events.   <br> \n <br> \nA total of 8 fish were recaptured from previous tagging years.  Of the recaptured fish six were previously tagged by the MN DNR in the St. Louis River, one was tagged by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in Lake Superior, and one was tagged by WI DNR.  The Lake Sturgeon tagged by the USFWS in Lake Superior was tagged just outside the WI entry to the estuary during a lake-wide juvenile Lake Sturgeon survey in 2011.  The other previously tagged fish has been caught four times by WI DNR, all captures were in Lake Superior in the vicinity of the Brule River. <br> \n <br> \nThis was the first year that acoustic tags were implanted into Lake Sturgeon in the St. Louis River Estuary.  A total of 45 sturgeon were surgically implanted with acoustic tags with battery lives of 10 years. <br> \n</p>",

Originally intended to monitor stocked Lake Sturgeon fingerlings in the late 1980's, the assessment now targets naturally reproduced Lake Sturgeon.  Lake Sturgeon stocking was discontinued in 2000, following the stocking of 14 different year-classes from 1983 through 2000.  A total of 923,580 fry or fingerling Lake Sturgeon were stocked into the St. Louis River by the MN and WI DNR during this period.   <br> \n <br> \nTwelve 150 foot experimental gillnets, each containing 50 foot panels of 1.25, 1.5, and 2.0 inch bar mesh were set in the St. Louis River between 9/26/16 and 9/30/16.  A total of 3 Lake Sturgeon were captured in twelve gillnets for an average catch of 0.3 per lift.  Previous assessments ranged from 1.3 to 7.2 Lake Sturgeon per lift.  Lake Sturgeon mean length was 30.8 inches with a range of 27.9 to 32.4 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled included Black Crappie, Channel Catfish, Freshwater Drum, Northern Pike, Pumpkinseed Sunfish, River Ruffe, Rock Bass, Shorthead Redhorse, Smallmouth Bass, Walleye, White Perch, White Sucker and Yellow Perch.    <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>The St. Louis River Estuary (SLRE) has a surface area of 10,255 acres and extends from the Fond du Lac Dam to the Wisconsin Entry from Lake Superior on Minnesota Point.  The Estuary, which is entirely interstate water between Minnesota and Wisconsin, has 10,242 (99%) acres of littoral area and a maximum depth of approximately 34 feet.   <br> \n <br> \nTwenty-one stations were sampled with overnight gillnet sets between June 26 and July 7, 2017 to monitor gamefish populations, evaluate the Lake Sturgeon rehabilitation program, and gather information for other fish species.  Nineteen fish species were collected in this assessment. The most abundant species collected were Walleye, Channel Catfish, Northern Pike, Yellow Perch, and Shorthead Redhorse.  <br> \n <br> \nTwo hundred three Walleye were collected during the 2017 assessment.  Walleye abundance of 9.7 per net night was slightly above average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type and was the third highest recorded on the SLRE during the previous 19 assessments.  Average length was 13.9 inches.  Age analysis revealed strong 2012 and 2013 year-classes which contributed to the relatively small average size.  No tags from the 2015 Walleye population estimate study were found.  Results of this study can be found in the St. Louis River Estuary 2015 Creel Study 4 Report (Varian, 2017).   <br> \n <br> \nThree Lake Sturgeon were collected during the 2017 assessment, and none contained tags from previous assessments.  The Lake Sturgeon catch rate (0.1 per net night) was the lowest since the early phase of the rehabilitation project in the mid 1980's (historic range: 0.1 to 6.5 per net night).  Although this is below the long range goal listed in the management plan, this was expected because most Lake Sturgeon collected by gill net are juveniles and no stocking has occurred for 17 years.  Increases in future natural reproduction should result in increased gillnet catch.  The estimated ages were between 6 and 12 years old for the smallest Lake Sturgeon and above 12 for the two largest individuals.  The smallest fish was likely from a naturally reproduced year-class, while the others may be from stocked or naturally produced year-classes.  .  <br> \n <br> \nNinety-nine Channel Catfish were collected in 2017.  Channel catfish abundance of 4.7 per net night was the fourth highest catch rate recorded when compared to previous investigations on the SLRE.  <br> \n <br> \nThirty-five Northern Pike were collected during the 2017 assessment.  Northern pike abundance of 1.7 per net night was below average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type and average compared to previous investigations (0.8-3.8).  Average size was 20.9 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nFourteen Black Crappie were collected in 2017.  Black Crappie abundance of 0.67 per net night was average compared with previous investigations.  <br> \n <br> \nFifty-one Yellow Perch were collected during the 2017 assessment.  Yellow perch abundance of 2.4 per net night was below average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type, and at the lower end of the range (1.1-7.6) of previous investigations.  <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species sampled were Alewife, Black Crappie, Bluegill, Lake Sturgeon, Muskellunge, Pumpkinseed, River Ruffe, Rock Bass, Silver Redhorse, Smallmouth Bass, White Bass, White Perch, White Sucker, and Yellow Bullhead. <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nLiterature Cited: <br> \n <br> \nVarian, A. 2017.

Gillnet catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) declined for all species, compared to 1992.  It is probable that these declines relate more to 1993 summer water temperatures and weather conditions than an actual decrease in abundance.  Walleye gillnet CPUE, which was 2.3 in 1993, has remained between 2.0 and 5.0 per lift since 1990.  Mean length of walleye from the 1993 sample was 16.8 inches while growth rates remained average compared to other Duluth Area lakes.  Northern pike gillnet CPUE remained between 2.0 and 3.5 per lift from 1990 to 1993, with a mean length of 20.0 inches for northerns sampled in 1993.  Black bullhead CPUE has steadily declined from 15.9 in 1990, to 0.1 per gillnet lift in 1993.  European ruffe gillnet CPUE, which had increased to 16.3 per lift in 1992, declined to 9.5 per lift in 1993.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>The St. Louis River estuary has a surface area of 11,500 acres and extends from the Fond du Lac Dam to the Wisconsin Entry on Minnesota Point.  The estuary, which is entirely interstate water between Minnesota and Wisconsin, has 11,385 (99%) acres of littoral area and a maximum depth of approximately 35 feet.  The estuary is a heavily used water body due to its proximity to the cities of Duluth and Superior, and status as an international shipping port.  Impacts of international shipping have included the introduction of exotic species such as Eurasian ruffe, round goby, tubenose goby, white perch, spiney water flea, zebra mussel and New Zealand mud snail.  The fish pathogen viral hemorrhagic septicemia was identified in the estuary from fish collected in 2009.  Water quality improved dramatically after Western Lake Superior Sanitary District began treating point sources of domestic and commercial effluent from Cloquet and Duluth in 1979.  The fishery has changed substantially since treatment began. <br> \n <br> \nThe St. Louis River estuary has been actively managed with stocking of walleye, northern pike, muskellunge, lake sturgeon and black crappie since 1980.  Walleye, northern pike and muskellunge were stocked at a high rate from 1989 through 1993 in an effort to control Eurasian ruffe.  Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources has stocked muskellunge and lake sturgeon.  Walleye are managed with a minimum length for harvest of 15 inches and a bag limit of two.  Northern pike are managed with a bag limit of two.  Smallmouth bass are managed with a bag limit of five and a minimum length for harvest of 14 inches.  There is not a season for lake sturgeon and targeted angling is prohibited.  No commercial minnow harvest is allowed on the St. Louis River estuary and possession of alewife, Eurasian ruffe, round goby, tubenose goby and white perch is prohibited.  Use of smelt and whitefish collected from Lake Superior or the St. Louis River estuary as bait on inland waters is also prohibited. <br> \n <br> \nStocking of lake sturgeon has established 14 year-classes from 1983 through 2000.  A total of 3,185,700 fry and 136,405 fingerlings have been stocked.  Stocking was discontinued after 2000 and management has shifted to the evaluation of natural reproduction and recruitment.  All fingerlings stocked by Minnesota DNR were injected with Northwest Marine Technologies coded-wire tags.  Since 2006, all sturgeon captured have been implanted with a passive integrated transponder (PIT) tag under the third dorsal scute from the head.  Lake sturgeon abundance of 0.5 per gillnet lift in 2010 was near the lower end of the range of catch rates since the early phase of the rehabilitation project in the mid 1980's.  Although the gillnet catch rate documented during the 2010 assessment was low, angler catch rates are still anecdotally reported as high.  Mean length of sampled sturgeon was 31.0 inches.  Two of the 11 sampled lake sturgeon possessed coded wire tags only in their snouts indicating they were tagged prior to 1991.  Two sturgeon had coded wire tags in their snout and under the 5th dorsal scute from the head, indicating that they had been tagged and stocked in 2000.  Mean length of the two 10 year old sturgeon was 24.7 inches.  One sturgeon had a coded wire tag under the 2nd dorsal scute from the head, indicating that it had been tagged and stocked in 1998 (snout tag was either lost or too deep to be detected).  Length of the 12 year old sturgeon was 27.2 inches.  No sturgeon were captured that would have recruited from years after stocking was discontinued in 2001. <br> \n <br> \nAnnual stocking of walleye fry, at a rate of at least 10% of the total number of eggs taken at the St. Louis River spawning station, was discontinued after 2007 when eff take was eliminated due to the threat of viral hemorrhagic septicemia.  Walleye abundance of 4.7 per gillnet lift was average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type and in the middle of the range (2.3 to 8.4) from the previous 14 investigations.  Average size was 15.5 inches and growth was slow.  Age analysis revealed that age 4 and 5 walleye comprised 64% of the total age distribution.  Average length at capture of age 4 walleye was 14.0 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike abundance of 0.8 per gillnet lift was below average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type and the lowest compared to the range of the 14 previous investigations (1.3 to 3.8).  Average size of 22.9 inches was considered to be large.  Northern pike were not aged from the 2010 assessment.   <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch abundance of 1.7 per gillnet lift was below average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type and at the lower end of the range (1.1 to 7.6) from the previous 14 investigations.  Average size of 7.8 was considered large.  Yellow perch were not aged from the 2010 assessment. <br> \n <br> \nChannel catfish abundance of 2.3 per lift was average compared to 14 previous investigations on the estuary.  Average size of 15.1 was slightly smaller in 2010 than in previous seven investigations, but has remained relatively constant after an initial increase in size starting in the early 1990's. <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species sampled include black crappie, bluegill, common carp, common shiner, freshwater drum, golden shiner, muskellunge, pumpkinseed, rock bass, shorthead redhorse, silver redhorse, smallmouth bass, white perch, white sucker and yellow bullhead. <br> \n</p>",

Muskellunge size in 2016 was above average when compared to previous assessments. <br> \n <br> \nNatural reproduction has been documented in every YOY assessment since 2006.  Naturally reproduced Muskellunge year-classes should reach a size large enough to spawn and be captured in standard Muskellunge large-frame trap nets set in future spawning adult population assessments. <br> \n</p>",

The estuary is an interstate waterway between Minnesota and Wisconsin and has 8,606 (85%) acres of littoral area and a maximum depth of approximately 55 feet.   <br> \n <br> \nStandardized stations were sampled with overnight gillnet sets between June 21 and July 1, 2021 to monitor gamefish populations, evaluate the Lake Sturgeon rehabilitation program and gather information on other fish species.  Nineteen fish species were collected in this assessment. The most abundant species collected were Walleye, Channel Catfish, Yellow Perch and Northern Pike. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance of 8.6 per gillnet was average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type and was above average compared to previous SLRE assessments.  Average length was 13.2 inches.  The 2018 year-class appears strong and should provide quality angling opportunities in the SLRE in 2022 and beyond. <br> \n <br> \nOne 44 inch long Lake Sturgeon was captured during the 2021 assessment.  Lake Sturgeon abundance (0.05 per gillnet) was near the lowest since the early phase of the rehabilitation project in the mid 1980's.  Although this is below the long range goal listed in the management plan, this was expected because most Lake Sturgeon captured by gillnet are juveniles and no stocking has occurred for 17 years.  Natural reproduction is expected to increase as more mature females return to the SLRE and supplemental stocking scheduled to begin in 2022 should result in increased gillnet catch rates.   <br> \n <br> \nChannel Catfish abundance of 4.5 per gillnet was near double the average of the previous investigations. Average size was 15.0 inches. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike abundance of 2.6 per gillnet lift was average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type. Average size was 19.1 inches, but Northern Pike over 30 inches long are present.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie abundance of 0.8 per gillnet lift was below average compared with previous investigations. Black Crappie growth was fast when compared to other Duluth area lakes.  Average size was 8.1 inches, but memorable sized fish over 12 inches long are present.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch abundance of 3.9 per gillnet lift was below average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type, but similar to previous SLRE investigations.  Average size was 7.1 inches.</p>",

Salmon and trout are present during certain parts of the year but are not captured during assessment netting.  I suspect that stocking of walleye, crappie and smallmouth bass (Wisc.) serves no purpose other than public relations.  However, in keeping with DNR policy, I recommend stocking walleye fry from the St. Louis River egg take in numbers equal to or more than 10 percent of the production from that operation.  Effortws to obtain sturgeon for stocking should continue.  Lake sturgeon were indigenous to this waterway and should be reestablished if possible.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>The St. Louis Bay is a 11,500 acre estuary that extends from the Fond du Lac Dam to the Wisconsin Entry on Minnesota Point.  St. Louis Bay, which is entirely interstate water between Wisconsin and Minnesota, has 11,385 (99%) acres of littoral area and a maximum depth of approximately 35 feet.  However, dredged channels are nearer to 25 feet deep.  The Bay is a heavily used water body due to its proximity to the cities of Duluth and Superior, and status as an international shipping port.  Impacts of international shipping have included the introduction of exotic species such as Eurasian ruffe, round goby, white perch, spiney water flea and zebra mussel.  Water quality improved dramatically after Western Lake Superior Sanitary District began treating point sources for domestic and commercial effluent from Cloquet to Duluth in 1979.  St. Louis Bay fishery changed significantly after treatment of effluent began.  The estuary has been sampled 15 times from 1980 through 2000.  St. Louis Bay is a lake class 16 with a priority rating of 10.     St. Louis Bay has been actively managed with stocking of walleye, northern pike, muskellunge, lake sturgeon and black crappie since 1980, soon after WLSSD began treating effluent water entering the Bay.  Walleye, northern pike and muskellunge were stocked at a high rate from 1989 through 1993 in an effort to control Eurasian ruffe.  Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources has stocked muskellunge and lake sturgeon.  Active management of walleye also includes a minimum length for harvest of 15 inches and a bag limit of two.  Active management of northern pike also includes a bag limit of two.  There is a catch-and-release only regulation for lake sturgeon.  Smallmouth bass are managed with a bag limit of five and minimum length for harvest of 14 inches.     Walleye abundance indexed with assessment nets was 8.4 per lift.  This index value was average when compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type, but was the highest catch rate documented by the DNR since regular assessments began in 1980.  Size structure of walleye was average and growth was slow.  Mean length of sampled walleye was 15.3 inches and length at the beginning of their fifth year of life was 13.5 inches.  It appears that many walleye within the St. Louis Bay are very near to exceeding the 15 inch minimum length for harvest.  From a sample of aged walleye it was determined that the 1996 year class was very strong and the 1994, 1995 and 1997 year classess were also very well represented.     Northern pike abundance indexed with assessment nets was 2.7 per lift.  This index value was average when compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Size structure and growth rates for northern pike were both typical.  Mean length of sampled northern pike was 22.1 inches and length at the beginning of their fifth year of life was 22.7 inches.  From a sample of aged northern pike it was determined that the 1997 year class was strong and every year class from 1992 through 1999 was represented.     Yellow perch abundance indexed with assessment nets was 2.0 per lift.  This index value was much below average when compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Size of yellow perch was poor and growth was fast.  Mean length of sampled yellow perch was 6.6 inches and length at the beginning of their fifth year of life was 7.7 inches.  From a sample of aged yellow perch it was determined that five year classes were present and no yellow perch were older than age VI.     Eurasian ruffe abundance indexed with assessment nets was 1.3 per lift.  This index value was low compared to samples collected from the St. Louis Bay in previous years.  Size of Eurasian ruffe was typical compared to previous samples, and length at the beginning of their fifth year of life of 5.2 inches was slow compared to previous samples.  From a sample of aged Eurasian ruffe it was determined that four year classes were present and no ruffe were older than age VI.     Lake sturgeon abundance indexed with assessment nets was 3.1 per lift.  This index value was near average when compared to samples collected from the St. Louis Bay since lake sturgeon reintroduction began in 1983.  Mean length of 19.5 inches was the longest value recorded compared to previous samples collected from the St. Louis Bay.  Mean length of three double micro-tagged 1991 year class lake sturgeon was 24.5 inches.  Mean length of nine double micro-tagged 1998 year class lake sturgeon was 12.4 inches.     Channel catfish abundance indexed with assessment nets was 2.4 per lift.  Catfish catch rates have fluctuated from 0.4 per lift in 1987 to 6.4 per lift in 1992.  Mean length of channel catfish sampled in 2000 was 15.7 inches.     Other fish species sampled during the 2000 investigation include alewife, black crappie, bluegill, freshwater drum, muskellunge, pumpkinseed sunfish, rock bass, shorthead and silver redhorse, smallmouth bass, white perch, white sucker and yellow bullhead.  Alewife were sampled at a higher rate than any previous investigation.  Only one yellow bullhead was sampled.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>The St. Louis River Estuary has a surface area of 11,500 acres and extends from the Fond du Lac Dam to the Wisconsin Entry on Minnesota Point.  The Estuary, which is entirely interstate water between Minnesota and Wisconsin, has 11,385 (99%) acres of littoral area and a maximum depth of approximately 35 feet.  The Estuary is a heavily used water body due to its proximity to the cities of Duluth and Superior, and status as an international shipping port.  Impacts of international shipping have included the introduction of exotic species such as Eurasian ruffe, round goby, tubenose goby, white perch, spiny water flea and zebra mussel.  water quality improved dramatically after Western Lake Superior Sanitary District began treating point sources of domestic and commercial effluent from Cloquet and Duluth in 1979.  The fishery has changed substantially since treatment began. <br> \n <br> \nThe St. Louis River Estuary has been actively managed with stocking of walleye, northern pike, muskellunge, lake sturgeon and black crappie since 1980.  Walleye, northern pike and muskellunge were stocked at a high rate from 1989 through 1993 in an effort to control Eurasian ruffe.  Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources has stocked muskellunge and lake sturgeon.  Walleye are managed with a minimum length for harvest of 15 inches and a bag limit of two.  Northern pike are managed with a bag limit of two.  Smallmouth bass are managed with a bag limit of five and a minimum length for harvest of 14 inches.  There is not a season for lake sturgeon and targeted angling is prohibited.  No commercial minnow harvest is allowed on the St. Louis River estuary and possession of alewife, Eurasian ruffe, round goby, tubenose goby and white perch is prohibited. <br> \n <br> \nStocking of lake sturgeon has established 14 year-classes from 1983 through 2000.  A total of 3,185,700 fry and 136,405 fingerlings have been stocked.  Lake sturgeon abundance of 1.6 per gillnet lift was near the bottom of the range for 15 previous investigations.  Lake sturgeon migrate to Lake Superior at approximately age five, which makes them less available to sampling gear set in the Estuary.  Lake sturgeon will return to the St. Louis River Estuary as spawning adults.  Average size of 26.7 inches was the largest compared to 15 previous investigations. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye fry are stocked anually at a rate of at least 10% of the total number of eggs taken at the St. Louis River spawning station.  Walleye abundance of 6.3 per gillnet lift was average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Average size of 14.5 inches was moderate and growth was slow.  All year-classes from 1996 through 2004 were represented, with a strong 2001 year-class. <br> \n <br> \nA total of 45,525 Leech Lake strain muskellunge fingerlings have been stocked from 1998 through 2005.  One muskellunge was sampled by gillnet during the investigation.  Muskellunge are not effectively sampled by summer assessment gear.  A spring trapnet assessment of spawning muskellunge is scheduled for 2007.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike abundance of 2.4 per gillnet lift was average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Average size of 23.4 inches was large and growth was fast.  Aging revealed fish from all year-classes from 1999 through 2005, with strong year-classes in 2002, 2003 and 2004. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch abundance of 3.0 per gillnet lift was average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Average size of 7.4 inches was small and growth was fast.  Aging revealed a strong 2003 year-class and no fish older than age five. <br> \n <br> \nChannel catfish abundance of 2.5 per lift was average compared to 14 previous investigations on the estuary.  Mean length of 18.7 inches was average. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill abundance of 0.6 per trapnet lift was below average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Bluegill were not sampled in 1995 when trapnets were last set in the St. Louis River Estuary.  Average size of 5.2 inches was small and growth was fast.  Aging revealed four year-classes present from 2001 through 2005 and no fish older than age five.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie abundance of 0.3 per lift was below average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Results of the creel survey conducted in 2003 suggest that both black crappie and bluegill are more abundant than this investigation suggests.  Average size was 5.6 inches and growth was average.  <br> \n <br> \nDaytime electrofishing for young-of-the-year muskellunge was conducted during three days from 10/9 through 10/25/2007.  A total of 5 YOY muskellunge with an average size of 9.7 inches were captured.  Fall electrofishing, coupled with small-mesh trapnetting will be conducted annually to assess natural recruitment. <br> \n  <br> \n <br> \n </p>",

Water quality in the estuary began improving in the 1980's paving the way for reintroduction.  Reintroduction and evaluation of Lake Sturgeon began in 1983 and has been a cooperative effort between Minnesota and Wisconsin Departments of Natural Resources.  A total of 13 year-classes were established by stocking from 1983 through 2000.  Lake Sturgeon introductions prior to 1995 were Wolf River strain, which is a tributary to Lake Michigan.  Lake Sturgeon stocked after 1995 were Sturgeon River strain, which is a tributary to Lake Superior.  In 2011 Fond du Lac biologists captured the first Lake Sturgeon fry below the Fond du Lac dam confirming natural reproduction. <br> \n <br> \nThe 2015 assessment was a record year for spring Lake Sturgeon sampling, with a total of 198 Lake Sturgeon captured during eight days.  Minimum and maximum length of sampled Lake Sturgeon was 30 inches and 57 inches, and mean length was 46 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nA total of 13 fish (7%) were previously tagged.  Of the recaptured fish, seven were previously tagged by the MN DNR in the St. Louis River; six were tagged by other agencies outside the St. Louis River.  One fish captured had a MI DNR floy tag and was found to have been originally tagged near Sleeping Bay, MI.   <br> \n</p>",

Nighttime electrofishing occurred on the nights of May 26 and May 27, 2016.  In an attempt to augment this sampling open-water angling for bass was conducted on October 10, 2016.  No Largemouth Bass were collected during this survey, however two were collected during a fall young-of-year Muskellunge assessment. <br> \n <br> \nTen Smallmouth Bass were collected with both sampling events combined.   Smallmouth Bass caught by electrofishing average 13.3 inches and fish caught by angling averaged 11.2 inches.  Smallmouth Bass from five year-classes (2007, 2010-2013) were captured during this survey indicating fairly consistent natural reproduction in the SLRE. <br> \n <br> \nSpring electrofishing is not an effective way of sampling Largemouth Bass or Smallmouth Bass in the SLRE.  Angling conducted in the spring of 2011 was more effective than the fall angling conducted in 2016. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass and Smallmouth Bass caught during the spring of 2017 adult Muskellunge survey will be sampled to supplement this survey. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>The St. Louis River Estuary (SLRE) has a surface area of 10,255 acres and extends from the Fond du Lac Dam to the Wisconsin Entry from Lake Superior on Minnesota Point.  The estuary is an interstate waterway between Minnesota and Wisconsin and has 8,606 (85%) acres of littoral area and a maximum depth of approximately 55 feet.  Standardized stations were sampled with overnight gill net sets to monitor gamefish populations, evaluate the Lake Sturgeon rehabilitation program and gather information on other fish species. Nineteen different fish species were collected during the survey. The most abundant species collected were Walleye, Channel Catfish and Yellow Perch. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance of 7.5 per gill net was average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type and was above average compared to previous SLRE assessments.  Average length was 14.6 inches.  The proportion of adult Walleye that exceeded quality size (greater than 15 inches) was 46%, while the proportion that exceeded preferred size (greater than 20 inches) was 3%.  The 2018 year-class is strong and should provide quality harvest opportunities in the SLRE as most fish from this year-class now exceed 15 inches in length. <br> \n <br> \nLake Sturgeon populations were extirpated from the SLRE and western Lake Superior in the early 1900's.  A collaborative effort between the States of Minnesota and Wisconsin resulted in 12 different year-classes stocked from 1983 through 2000.  One Lake Sturgeon was captured during the survey, but Lake Sturgeon abundance (0.05 per gill net) was near the lowest observed since re-introductory stocking commenced in the early 1980's.  Despite evidence of successful early life stage Lake Sturgeon natural reproduction in the SLRE since 2011, abundance of naturally reproduced juveniles captured by gill nets has been low.  Natural reproduction is expected to increase as more mature females return to the SLRE to spawn.  Gear types used during gill net surveys do not represent adult Lake Sturgeon populations well and they are evaluated separately during spring targeted surveys.     <br> \n <br> \nChannel Catfish abundance of 4.1 per gill net was near double the average of previous investigations. Average size was 15.8 inches. The proportion of adult Channel Catfish that exceeded quality size (greater than 16 inches) was 64%, while the proportion that exceeded preferred size (greater than 24 inches) was 0%.  <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie abundance of 1.2 per gill net lift was average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type. Average size was 7.9 inches.  The proportion of adult Black Crappie that exceeded quality size (greater than 8 inches) was 46%, while the proportion that exceeded preferred size (greater than 10 inches) was 17%.    <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch abundance of 4.9 per gill net lift was average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Average size was 7.4 inches. The proportion of adult Yellow Perch that exceeded quality size (greater than 8 inches) was 27%, while the proportion that exceeded preferred size (greater than 10 inches) was 7%.    <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike abundance of 1.7 per gill net lift was below average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Average size was 22.1 inches.  The proportion of adult Northern Pike that exceeded quality size (greater than 21 inches) was 63%, while the proportion that exceeded preferred size (greater than 28 inches) was 9%. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

Increased ruffe abundance may cause shifts in the fish community as documented in Europe.  Gamefish species whose abundance increased since 1991 in our gillnet catch include walleye, yellow perch and lake sturgeon.  Walleye abundance has continued in a downward trend since 1984 although CPUE did increase from 1991 to 1992.  Although northern pike catch rates have been up during the last two assessments, CPUE is still below values seen prior to 1986.  It is uncertian whether stocking on northern pike adults contributed to the 1991 and 1992 increases.  Black crappie trapnet catch rate increased in 1992.  Shoal-water seining results continue to show low abundance of young-of-the-year gamefish and forage species.</p>",

Gamefish with decreased abundance indices include lake sturgeon, yellow perch, walleye and black crappie.

                "narrative": "<p>The St Louis River Estuary (SLRE) is 10,255-acres with 10,242 acres (99%) of littoral area and a maximum depth of 55 feet.  The SLRE forms the state boundary between Duluth, Minnesota and Superior, Wisconsin.  The SLRE was assessed during the spring of 2017 to evaluate the current Muskellunge fishery, contributions of natural reproduction to the SLRE population, and to complete a population estimate of Muskellunge.  This assessment also provided an opportunity to surgically implant hydro-acoustic tags in the abdomen of 60 Muskellunge to learn more about their movements in the SLRE and Lake Superior.  Muskellunge assessments are currently conducted every three years on the SLRE though the last assessment was completed in 2013. The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MNDNR) and Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources (WIDNR) stocked a total of 103,610 Muskellunge in the SLRE from 1983 to 2005 (4,207 per year).  Year-classes became established for all years except 1996 and 1998.  The MNDNR stocked Leech Lake-strain Muskellunge except when Tiger Muskellunge were stocked in 1988, 1989 and 1990.  The WIDNR stocked only Chippewa Flowage-strain Muskellunge.  Stocking was suspended in 2005 to provide a baseline of natural reproduction and recruitment of Muskellunge in the SLRE.  If the SLRE can sustain an adequately sized Muskellunge population through natural reproduction, resource managers and local stakeholders can allocate resources elsewhere to help maintain, sustain or improve the fishery (e.g., habitat protection and identification). Two thousand one hundred and eighty-nine Leech Lake-strain Muskellunge were stocked in 2015 due to surplus Muskellunge in the hatchery system. Catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) calculations reported for other species should be interpreted with caution since the duration of this assessment and locations targeted are intended to capture Muskellunge.  In addition, net size selectivity and fish spawning behavior may bias size structure for other species. <br> \n <br> \nThe MNDNR and WIDNR conducted a cooperative special assessment of Muskellunge on the St. Louis River Estuary from April 14 through May 12, 2017 using standard large-frame (5 x 6 ft.) trap nets.   In total, 257 Muskellunge were sampled from the St. Louis River Estuary with 629 net nights of effort for a catch rate of 0.4 per trap net set.  This was a much higher effort than in past surveys.   Twelve additional Muskellunge were incidentally captured while electrofishing and are also reported here.  Each Muskellunge was examined for a PIT tag.  If none was found, a PIT tag was implanted by the dorsal fin. <br> \n <br> \nAverage length of Muskellunge collected in 2017 was 40.6 inches, which was higher than 1997 (38.0 inches), 2007 (38.7 inches), 2010 (38.2 inches), and 2013 (39.5 inches).  Maximum length observed was 52.8 inches, which was much higher than 1997 (48.0 inches), and higher than 2013 (50.7 inches), 2010 (51.8 inches), and 2007 (50.3 inches). <br> \n <br> \nMuskellunge under 40 inches long were aged in an effort to identify contributions from naturally produced year-classes.  Ages from individuals over 40 inches were not considered reliable due to the difficulty in aging scales from larger fish.  Eighty-nine percent of all aged Muskellunge were from natural year-classes.  Forty-two percent of the Muskellunge that were aged were from the strong 2008 and 2009 year-classes.  All year classes from 2001 to 2015 were represented. <br> \n <br> \nTwo different methods were used to derive population estimates for Muskellunge spawning stock (>30 inches in length).  Each estimate is reported with a corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI).  The population estimates provided are approximations of the number of adult muskellunge present, and provide for comparisons of past and future population estimates on the SLRE.  Only Muskellunge 30 inches or longer were used to calculate population estimates.  With trapnetting as the recapture method, a multiple census population estimate utilizing the modified Schnabel method was used.  This method estimated 1,494 adult Muskellunge (95% CI - 1,012 - 2,206).  However, this is a closed estimate meaning that fish cannot enter or leave the waterbody being sampled.  The SLRE population is known to use Lake Superior, so Muskellunge leave the SLRE.  With trapnetting as the recapture method, a multiple census open population run in program MARK estimated a population of 1,703 adult Muskellunge (95% CI - 935 - 2,469).  The 2017 open population estimate translates into one adult Muskellunge for every 6.0 surface acres (0.17 fish/acre) in the SLRE.  Previous estimates on the SLRE made using the Chapman modification of the Peterson method have estimated one adult Muskellunge for every 3.2 to 6.8 surface acres (0.15-0.32 fish/acre).  These estimates were likely biased due to this being an open system and low tag returns from angling. <br> \n <br> \nGenetic samples were analyzed for 259 individuals. Approximately 41% (106) of the analyzed individuals were of Leech Lake genetic origin and 22% (57) were of Chippewa Flowage origin.   Thirty-six percent (94) were hybrids with Leech Lake and Chippewa Flowage origin.  Less than 1% (2) of the individuals analyzed were Tiger Muskellunge. <br> \n <br> \nSixty Muskellunge captured during this survey were surgically implanted with hydro-acoustic tracking tags to monitor their movement in the SLRE as well as into Lake Superior.  This is the first six months of a five year project.  Methods and full results of the first year and a half of this movement study can found in Erin Schaeffer's graduate thesis from the University of Minnesota-St. Paul (in prep.), though some details are discussed here. <br> \n <br> \nA total of 23 of 60 (38%) individual Muskellunge spent time in Lake Superior between April and September 2017 with 19 (83%) of these individuals being Leech Lake-strain.  Fifteen of those 23 (25% of the tagged individuals) spent a month or more in Lake Superior.  Eighty-six percent of the Muskellunge that spent a month or more in Lake Superior were of Leech Lake-strain.  All except one were in or near the SLRE at the end of September when the data was collected. <br> \n <br> \nThe population estimate can be contextualized using genetic data and movement data.  Taking these factors into account, approximated 385 Muskellunge spent a month or more of time in Lake Superior, meaning that approximately 1,318 were river residents and were available to anglers during the vast majority of the angling season.  This equates to one adult Muskellunge for every 7.8 surface acres (0.13 fish/acre).  These estimates will continue to be refined as more movement data is collected. <br> \n <br> \nThis population appears to be biologically self-sustaining as documented by the number of Muskellunge that are from naturally produced year classes and the number of Muskellunge of hybrid genetic origin that were not stocked.  However, with the relatively low abundance of Muskellunge that stay in the SLRE, a supplemental stocking program will be pursued to likely start in 2019. <br> \n <br> \nOther Species <br> \n <br> \nA total of 6,962 Black Crappie were captured during the 2017 LTN assessment.  This resulted in a trap net catch rate of 11.0 per lift.  Black Crappie mean length was 10.1 inches and the maximum size sampled was 14.1 inches.  Average length at age-4 of 8.0 inches is average growth when compared to other Duluth Area lakes.   All year-classes from 2006 to 2015 were represented in the sample. <br> \n <br> \nA total of 209 Bluegill were captured during the 2017 assessment resulting in a trap net catch rate of 0.3 per lift.  Bluegill mean length was 7.0 inches with a maximum length of 9.6 inches. All year-classes from 2009 to 2015 were represented in the sample.  Mean length at age-4 of 7.5 inches is above average growth when compared to other Duluth Area lakes.   <br> \n <br> \nA total of 15 Lake Sturgeon were captured during the 2017 assessment resulting in a trap net catch rate of less than 0.1 per lift.  Lake Sturgeon mean length was 42.5 inches and the maximum length was 53.5 inches. All captured Lake Sturgeon were checked for PIT tags and a PIT tag was applied if none were detected.   <br> \n <br> \nA total of 15 Largemouth Bass were captured during the 2017 assessment resulting in a trap net catch rate of less than 0.1 per lift.  Largemouth Bass mean length was 15.5 inches and the maximum length was 18.2 inches.  Mean length at age-4 of 13.6 inches is above average growth when compared to other Duluth Area lakes.  All year-classes from 2009 to 2015 were represented in the sample except 2011.   <br> \n <br> \nA total of 124 Smallmouth Bass were captured during the 2017 assessment resulting in a trap net catch rate of less than 0.2 per lift.  Smallmouth Bass mean length of 16.7 inches and the maximum length was 21.7 inches. Mean length at age-4 of 14.0 inches is above average growth when compared to other Duluth Area lakes.  All year-classes from 2006 to 2013 were represented in the sample. <br> \n <br> \nLow numbers of Brook Trout (2), Brown Trout (2), and Rainbow Trout (4) were also captured and measured during this assessment. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>The St. Louis River Estuary (SLRE) has a surface area of 10,255 acres and extends from the Fond du Lac Dam to the Wisconsin Entry from Lake Superior on Minnesota Point.  The Estuary, which is interstate water between Minnesota and Wisconsin, has 8,606 (85%) acres of littoral area and a maximum depth of approximately 55 feet.   <br> \n <br> \nTwenty-one stations were sampled with overnight gillnet sets between June 29 and July 10, 2020 to monitor gamefish populations, evaluate the Lake Sturgeon rehabilitation program and gather information for other fish species.  Sixteen fish species were collected in this assessment. The most abundant species collected were Walleye, Channel Catfish, Shorthead Redhorse and Northern Pike. <br> \n <br> \nOne hundred fifty-three Walleye were collected at an abundance of 7.3 per gillnet lift which was average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type and was above average on the SLRE when compared to the previous 20 assessments.  Average length was 13.5 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nFour Lake Sturgeon were captured during the 2020 assessment, and none of them contained a tag from previous assessments.  Lake Sturgeon abundance (0.2 per gillnet left) was near the lowest since the early phase of the rehabilitation project in the mid 1980's.  Although this is below the long range goal listed in the management plan, this was expected because most Lake Sturgeon captured by gillnet are juveniles and no stocking has occurred for 17 years.  Increases in future natural reproduction and additional planned introductory stocking should result in increased gillnet catch.  Three of the four Lake Sturgeon were estimated to be less than five years old and all were naturally reproduced.   <br> \n <br> \nOne hundred eleven Channel Catfish were captured at an abundance of 5.3 per gillnet lift which was double the average of the previous 20 investigations. Average size was 15.3 inches. <br> \n <br> \nForty-four Northern Pike were captured at an abundance of 5.3 per gillnet lift which was average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type. Average size was 17.6 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nTwenty-two Black Crappie were captured at an abundance of 1.1 per gillnet lift which was above average compared with previous investigations. Black Crappie growth was average when compared to other Duluth area lakes.  Average size was 9.5 inches. <br> \n <br> \nForty-four Yellow Perch were captured at an abundance of 2.1 per gillnet lift which was below average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type, but similar to previous SLRE investigations.  Average size was 7.6 inches. <br> \n <br> \nOther fish species sampled were Black Crappie, Freshwater Drum, Lake Sturgeon, Muskellunge, Rock Bass, Ruffe, Smallmouth Bass, White Bass, White Perch, White Sucker, Yellow Bullhead and Yellow Perch. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Sturgeon were extirpated from the St. Louis River Estuary (SLRE) and Western Lake Superior in the early to mid-1900's due to overharvest and habitat and water quality degradation.  Water quality in the estuary began improving in the 1980's paving the way for reintroduction.  Reintroduction and evaluation of Lake Sturgeon began in 1983 and has been a cooperative effort between Minnesota and Wisconsin Departments of Natural Resources.  A total of 13 year-classes were stocked from 1983 through 2000.  During the mid-2000's, biologists began observing small numbers of Lake Sturgeon congregating at available spawning habitat in the upper reaches of the SLRE, signaling that some stocked year-classes were beginning to mature.  In 2011, Fond du Lac Natural Resources biologists captured the first Lake Sturgeon fry below the Fond du Lac dam confirming natural reproduction had occurred.     <br> \n <br> \nA total of 295 individual Lake Sturgeon were sampled in 2021.   Minimum and maximum length of sampled Lake Sturgeon was 37.6 and 63.0 inches, and average length was 48.3 inches.  Catch-and-release angling (open mid-June through mid-April annually) for Lake Sturgeon in the SLRE should be good in 2021 and beyond as the population continues to recover.   <br> \n <br> \nFrom 2016-2018, 146 Lake Sturgeon were surgically implanted with acoustic transmitters as part of a cooperative project with the University of Wisconsin Stevens Point and the WI DNR.  This research enables the tracking of individual fish and is helping refine uncertainties related to spawning movements and timing.  An array of acoustic receivers that log data about tagged fish movements is managed throughout the estuary and the near-shore waters of Lake Superior to monitor movement through the estuary and into Lake Superior.  Fish that migrate to other regions of Lake Superior and are detected on other jurisdictions' acoustic arrays are reported back to MN DNR enabling a broad-scale interpretation of Lake Sturgeon migratory behavior.  Movement patterns have demonstrated both resident and migratory life history strategies.  The movement patterns of resident sturgeon suggest that they frequently select for complex habitat with access to large shallow flats.  Migratory individuals are frequently detected along the south shore of Lake Superior extending to the Keweenaw Peninsula of Michigan and northward to Black Bay, Ontario.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>The St. Louis River Estuary (SLRE) has a surface area of 10,255 acres and extends from the Fond du Lac Dam to the Wisconsin Entry from Lake Superior on Minnesota Point.  The estuary is an interstate waterway between Minnesota and Wisconsin and has 8,606 (85%) acres of littoral area and a maximum depth of approximately 55 feet.   <br> \n <br> \nStandardized stations were sampled with overnight gillnet sets to monitor gamefish populations, evaluate the Lake Sturgeon rehabilitation program and gather information on other fish species.  Twenty-one fish species were collected in this assessment. The most abundant species collected were Walleye, Channel Catfish and Yellow Perch. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance of 6.9 per gillnet was average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type and was above average compared to previous SLRE assessments.  Average length was 14.4 inches.  The proportion of adult Walleye that exceeded quality size (greater than 15 inches) was 50%, while the proportion that exceeded preferred size (greater than 20 inches) was 5%.  The 2018 year-class is strong and will begin providing harvest opportunities in the SLRE in 2023 as fish from this year-class begin to exceed 15 inches in length. <br> \n <br> \nLake Sturgeon populations were extirpated from the SLRE and western Lake Superior in the early 1900's.  A collaborative effort between the States of Minnesota and Wisconsin resulted in 12 different year-classes stocked from 1998 through 2000.  Two Lake Sturgeon were captured during the survey, but Lake Sturgeon abundance (0.1 per gillnet) was near the lowest observed since re-introductory stocking commenced in the early 1980's.  Despite evidence of successful early life stage Lake Sturgeon natural reproduction in the SLRE since 2011, abundance of naturally reproduced juveniles captured by gillnets has been low.  Natural reproduction is expected to increase as more mature females return to the SLRE and supplemental stocking is scheduled to begin in 2023.  Gear types used during gillnet surveys do not represent adult Lake Sturgeon populations well and they are evaluated separately during spring targeted surveys.     <br> \n <br> \nChannel Catfish abundance of 5.2 per gillnet was over double the average of previous investigations. Average size was small at 14.6 inches. The proportion of adult Channel Catfish that exceeded quality size (greater than 16 inches) was 41%, while the proportion that exceeded preferred size (greater than 24 inches) was 0%.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike abundance of 2.2 per gillnet lift was average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type. Average size was 21.3 inches, but Northern Pike over 30 inches long were captured.  The proportion of adult Northern Pike that exceeded quality size (greater than 21 inches) was 44%, while the proportion that exceeded preferred size (greater than 28 inches) was 2%. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie abundance of 1.5 per gillnet lift was average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type. Average size was 7.6 inches.  The proportion of adult Black Crappie that exceeded quality size (greater than 8 inches) was 41%, while the proportion that exceeded preferred size (greater than 10 inches) was 24%.    <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch abundance of 3.6 per gillnet lift was below average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type, but similar to previous SLRE investigations.  Average size was 7.2 inches. The proportion of adult Yellow Perch that exceeded quality size (greater than 8 inches) was 23%, while the proportion that exceeded preferred size (greater than 10 inches) was 4%.   </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Sturgeon were extirpated from the St. Louis River Estuary (SLRE) and Western Lake Superior in the early to mid-1900's due to overharvest and habitat and water quality degradation.  Water quality in the estuary began improving in the 1980's paving the way for reintroduction.  Reintroduction and evaluation of Lake Sturgeon began in 1983 and has been a cooperative effort between Minnesota and Wisconsin Departments of Natural Resources.  A total of 13 year-classes were stocked from 1983 through 2000.  During the mid-2000's, biologists began observing small numbers of Lake Sturgeon congregating at available spawning habitat in the upper reaches of the SLRE, signaling that some stocked year-classes were beginning to mature.  In 2011, Fond du Lac Natural Resources biologists captured the first Lake Sturgeon fry below the Fond du Lac dam confirming natural reproduction had occurred.     <br> \n <br> \nA total of 64 individual Lake Sturgeon were sampled in spring 2022.   Minimum and maximum length of sampled Lake Sturgeon was 38.3 and 59.9 inches, and average length was 48.5 inches.  Catch-and-release angling (open mid-June through mid-April annually) for Lake Sturgeon in the SLRE should be good in 2022 and beyond as the population continues to recover.   <br> \n <br> \nFrom 2016-2022, 153 Lake Sturgeon were surgically implanted with acoustic transmitters as part of a cooperative project with the University of Wisconsin Stevens Point, Wisconsin DNR and the National Park Service.  This research enables the tracking of individual fish and is helping refine uncertainties related to spawning movements and timing.  An array of acoustic receivers that log data about tagged fish movements is managed by MN DNR throughout the estuary and the near-shore waters of Lake Superior to monitor movement through the estuary and into Lake Superior.  Fish that migrate to other regions of Lake Superior and are detected on other jurisdictions' acoustic arrays are reported back to MN DNR enabling a broad-scale interpretation of Lake Sturgeon migratory behavior.  Movement patterns have demonstrated both resident and migratory life history strategies.  The movement patterns of resident sturgeon suggest that they are frequently detected in deeper habitats with access to large shallow flats.  Migratory individuals are frequently detected along the south shore of Lake Superior and rarely extending to the Keweenaw Peninsula of Michigan and northward to Black Bay, Ontario.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>The St. Louis Bay is a 11,500 acre estuary that extends from the Fond du Lac Dam to the Wisconsin Entry on Minnesota Point.  The St. Louis Bay, which is entirely interstate water between Wisconsin and Minnesota, has 11,385 (99%) acres of littoral area and a maximum depth of approximately 35 feet.  The Bay is a heavily used water body due to its proximity to the cities of Duluth and Superior, and status as an international shipping port.  Impacts of international shipping have included the introduction of exotic species such as Eurasian ruffe, round goby, tubenose goby, white perch, spiny water flea and zebra mussel.  Water quality improved dramatically after Western Lake Superior Sanitary District began treating point sources for domestic and commercial effluent from Cloquet to Duluth in 1979.  The fishery has changed significantly since treatment began.     The St. Louis Bay has been actively managed with stocking of walleye, northern pike, muskellunge, lake sturgeon and black crappie since 1980.  Walleye, northern pike and muskellunge were stocked at a high rate from 1989 through 1993 in an effort to control Eurasian ruffe.  Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources has also stocked muskellunge and lake sturgeon.  Walleye are managed with a minimum length for harvest of 15 inches and a bag limit of two.  Northern pike are managed with a bag limit of two. Smallmouth bass are managed with a bag limit of five and a minimum length for harvest of 14 inches.  There is a no kill regulation for lake sturgeon.  No commercial minnow harvest is allowed on the St. Louis Bay and possession of alewife, Eurasian ruffe, round goby, tubenose goby and white perch is prohibited.    Lake sturgeon stocking has established 14 year classes from 1983 through 2000.  A total of 3,185,700 fry and 136,405 fingerlings have been stocked.  Lake sturgeon abundance of 3.8 per gillnet lift was near the middle of the range for 12 previous investigations.  Mean length of 21.4 inches was the largest compared to 12 previous investigations.  Mean length of tagged 1998 and 2000 year class sturgeon sampled in 2002 was 18.2 and 13.8 inches.     Walleye fry are stocked annually at a rate of at least 10% of the total number of eggs taken at the St. Louis River spawning station.  Walleye abundance of 7.1 per gillnet lift was average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Mean length of 15.0 inches was average.  Growth was slow with length at age four of 13.7 inches.  Age analysis revealed strong recruitment from 1996 through 1999, and all year-classes from 1994 through 2001 represented.     A total of 38,324 Leech Lake strain muskellunge fingerlings have been stocked from 1988 through 2002.  Muskellunge abundance was 0.2 per gillnet lift and mean length was 20.4 inches.  Larger muskellunge are present but not frequently sampled by the gear used during summer assessments.     Northern pike abundance of 2.1 per gillnet lift was slightly below average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Mean length of 20.6 inches was average.  Growth was also average with length at age four of 22.8 inches.  Age analysis revealed steady recruitment from 1996 through 2001 and no fish older than six.     Yellow perch abundance of 2.2 per gillnet lift was below average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Mean length of 7.6 inches was average.  Growth was fast with length at age four of 8.4 inches.  Age analysis revealed a strong 2000 year-class and all year-classes from 1995 through 2001 represented.     Eurasian ruffe abundance of 0.9 per gillnet lift was near the low end of the range for nine investigations since they became established.  Mean length was 5.3 inches.  Length at age four was 5.3 inches.  Age analysis revealed a strong 1999 year-class and no fish older than four.     Channel catfish abundance of 2.0 was average compared to 11 previous investigations.  Mean length of 17.1 inches was large compared to previous investigations.     Other fish species sampled include alewife, black bullhead, black crappie, common carp, rock bass, shorthead redhorse, silver redhorse, smallmouth bass, white perch and white sucker.  Only rock bass, shorthead redhorse and white sucker were sampled at a rate greater than 1.0 per gillnet lift.      </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Stocking of fingerling walleye and adult northern pike was discontinued in 1994.  A total of 179,756 fingerling walleye and 77,641 adult northern were stocked into the St. Louis Bay from 1989 to 1993.  It does not appear that walleye and northern pike stocking has increased their catch rates in assessment netting.  Walleye and northern pike gillnet catch rates remained between 1.5 and 5.0 per lift from 1987 to 1996.  The open nature of the St. Louis Bay system may have confounded efforts to artificially increase predator biomass.     Yellow perch and Eurasian ruffe gillnet abundance indices continued to decrease since the 1992 assessment.  yellow perch and ruffe gillnet abundance declined from 6.6 and 16.3 per lift in 1992 to 1.0 and 1.2 per lift in 1996.  Length of ruffe at the beginning of their third year has declined from 6.7 inches in 1992 to 4.7 inches in 1996.  It is unclear what is causing this slowing of growth.     Although abundance of yellow perch and bullhead has declined dramatically since 1986, species diversity and percent distribution of catch within the St. Louis Bay has improved.  In 1986, 68% of gillnet catch by number was comprised of yellow perch and black bullhead.  In 1996, walleye, northern pike, lake sturgeon and white sucker all comprised at least 15% of the gillnet catch by number.  Channel catfish, Eurasian ruffe and shorthead redhorse were also well represented.  Despite recent invasion of exotic species such as Eurasian ruffe, zebra mussel, white perch, round goby and spiney water flea, total catch has become more evenly distributed between species.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Stocking of fingerling walleye and adult northern pike was discontinued in 1994.  At total of 178,468 fingerling walleye and 68,500 adult northern pike were stocked into the St. Louis Bay from 1989 to 1993.  It does not appear that walleye and northern pike stocking has increased their catch rates in assessment netting.  Walleye and northern pike gillnet catch rates remained between 1.5 and 5.0 per lift form 1986 to 1995.  The open nature of the St. Louis Bay system may have confounded efforts to artificially increase predator biomass.     Yellow perch and ruffe gillnet abundance indices continued to decrease since the 1992 assessment.  Yellow perch and ruffe gillnet abundance declined from 6.6 and 16.3 per lift in 1992 to 1.5 and 3.9 per lift in 1995.     Although abundance of yellow perch and bullhead has declined dramatically since 1986, species diversity and percent distribution of catch within the St. Louis Bay has improved.  In 1986, 68% of gillnet catch by number was comprised of yellow perch and black bullhead.  In 1995, walleye, northern pike, lake sturgeon, channel catfish, European ruffe and white sucker all comprised at least 10% of the gillnet catch by number.  Despite recent invasion of exotic species such as European ruffe, zebra mussel, white perch and spiney water flea, the fishery of the St. Louis Bay has become more diverse.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>The St. Louis River estuary has a surface area of 11,500 acres and extends from the Fond du Lac Dam to the Wisconsin Entry on Minnesota Point.  The estuary, which is entirely interstate water between Minnesota and Wisconsin, has 11,385 (99%) acres of littoral area and a maximum depth of approximately 35 feet.  The estuary is a heavily used water body due to its proximity to the cities of Duluth and Superior, and status as an international shipping port.  Impacts of international shipping have included the introduction of exotic species such as Eurasian ruffe, round goby, tubenose goby, white perch, spiney water flea, zebra mussel and New Zealand mud snail.  The estuary is also at high risk of receiving the fish pathogen viral hemorrhagic septicemia.  Water quality improved dramatically after Western Lake Superior Sanitary District began treating point sources of domestic and commercial effluent from Cloquet and Duluth in 1979.  The fishery has changed substantially since treatment began. <br> \n <br> \nThe St. Louis River estuary has been actively managed with stocking of walleye, northern pike, muskellunge, lake sturgeon and black crappie since 1980.  Walleye, northern pike and muskellunge were stocked at a high rate from 1989 through 1993 in an effort to control Eurasian ruffe.  Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources has stocked muskellunge and lake sturgeon.  Walleye are managed with a minimum length for harvest of 15 inches and a bag limit of two.  Northern pike are managed with a bag limit of two.  Smallmouth bass are managed with a bag limit of five and a minimum length for harvest of 14 inches.  There is not a season for lake sturgeon and targeted angling is prohibited.  No commercial minnow harvest is allowed on the St. Louis River estuary and possession of alewife, Eurasian ruffe, round goby, tubenose goby and white perch is prohibited. <br> \n <br> \nStocking of lake sturgeon has established 14 year-classes from 1983 through 2000.  A total of 3,185,700 fry and 136,405 fingerlings have been stocked.  Lake sturgeon abundance of 0.3 per gillnet lift was the lowest recorded catch since the early phase of the rehabilitation project in the mid 1980's.  Although the gillnet catch rate documented during the 2008 assessment was low, angler catch rates are still anecdotally reported as very high.  Mean length of 30.5 inches for sampled lake sturgeon was the longest since sampling began. <br> \n <br> \nAnnual stocking of walleye fry, at a rate of at least 10% of the total number of eggs taken at the St. Louis River spawning station, was discontinued after 2007 when the station was eliminated due to the threat of viral hemorrhagic septicemia.  Walleye abundance of 6.7 per gillnet lift was average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type and at the upper end of the range from the previous 12 investigations.  Average size of 14.6 inches was small and growth was slow.  Age analysis revealed that age 2 and 3 walleye comprised 65% of the total age distribution.  Average length at capture of age 3 walleye was 13.4 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nA total of 45,525 Leech Lake strain muskellunge fingerlings have been stocked from 1998 through 2005.  Three muskellunge were sampled by gillnet during the investigation.  Muskellunge are not effectively sampled by summer assessment gear.  A spring trapnet assessment is scheduled for 2010.  Daytime electrofishing for young-of-the-year (YOY) muskellunge was conducted during three days from 10/6 through 10/9/2008.  A total of 17 YOY muskellunge were captured for a catch rate of 4.68 per hour of electrofishing.  Catch rate from the first YOY muskellunge assessment conducted in 2006 was 2.24 per hour.  Mean length of YOY muskellunge was 8.4 inches. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike abundance of 1.5 per gillnet lift was below average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type and at the lower end of the range from the previous 12 investigations.  Average size of 26.5 inches was the largest compared to all investigations since 1992 and growth was fast.  Analysis of age distribution revealed a strong 2005 year-class and no fish older than age six. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch abundance of 7.6 per gillnet lift was average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type and the highest of 12 investigations conducted since 1992.  Although the average size of 7.7 was small compared to other Duluth Area populations, it is the largest value since the 1995 investigation.  Rate of growth was considered fast. Age analysis revealed strong 2005 and 2006 year-classes and all year-classes from 2000 through 2007 represented. <br> \n <br> \nChannel catfish abundance of 1.9 per lift was average compared to 14 previous investigations on the estuary.  Average size of 17.9 inches has remained relatively constant over the last five investigations after an initial increase in size starting in the early 1990's.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Lake Sturgeon were extirpated from the St. Louis River Estuary (SLRE) and Western Lake Superior in the early to mid-1900's due to overharvest and habitat and water quality degradation.  Water quality in the estuary began improving in the 1980's paving the way for reintroduction.  Reintroduction and evaluation of Lake Sturgeon began in 1983 and has been a cooperative effort between Minnesota and Wisconsin Departments of Natural Resources.  A total of 13 year-classes were stocked from 1983 through 2000.  During the mid-2000's, biologists began observing small numbers of Lake Sturgeon congregating at available spawning habitat in the upper reaches of the SLRE, signaling that some stocked year-classes were beginning to mature.  In 2011, Fond du Lac Natural Resources biologists captured the first Lake Sturgeon fry below the Fond du Lac dam confirming natural reproduction had occurred.     <br> \n <br> \nA total of 223 individual Lake Sturgeon were sampled in spring 2023.   Minimum and maximum length of sampled Lake Sturgeon was 38.9 and 63.2 inches, and average length was 49.6 inches.  Catch-and-release angling (open mid-June through mid-April annually) for Lake Sturgeon in the SLRE should be good in 2024 and beyond as the population continues to recover.   <br> \n <br> \nFrom 2016-2023, 164 Lake Sturgeon were surgically implanted with acoustic transmitters as part of a cooperative project with the University of Wisconsin Stevens Point, Wisconsin DNR and the National Park Service.  This research enables the tracking of individual fish and is helping refine uncertainties related to spawning movements and timing.  An array of acoustic receivers that log data about tagged fish movements is managed by MN DNR throughout the estuary and the near-shore waters of Lake Superior to monitor movement through the estuary and into Lake Superior.  Fish that migrate to other regions of Lake Superior and are detected on other jurisdictions' acoustic arrays are reported back to MN DNR enabling a broad-scale interpretation of Lake Sturgeon migratory behavior.  Movement patterns have demonstrated both resident and migratory life history strategies.  The movement patterns of resident sturgeon suggest that they are frequently detected in deeper habitats with access to large shallow flats.  Migratory individuals are frequently detected along the south shore of Lake Superior and rarely extending to the Keweenaw Peninsula of Michigan and northward to Black Bay, Ontario.  <br> \n</p>",
