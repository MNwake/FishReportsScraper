Species with catches above the third quartile are northern pike and brown bullhead. Species caught during the 1968 initial investigation, but not caught during the present resurvey are yellow bullhead, largemouth bass and black crappie. Two pumpkinseed and one bluegill were sampled. Based on catches of these nets both northern pike and yellow perch populations have remained the same. Northern pike aged (31 of 31 fish) showed aged classes 1-3. Age classes 2 and 3 are nearly identical, 13 and 14 fish respectively. Growth of all three year classes is good as well as annual increment back-calculated lengths. The length frequency distribution has expanded from the 15.0-19.9 inch 1968 data to the present 14.0-23.9 inch distribution. The mean weight has also changed. In 1968 the mean weight was 1 pound while at present it is 1.8 lbs.</p>",
