The dissolved oxygen and temperature profile was measured on August 22, 2011 to monitor habitat for trout.  Optimal conditions for rainbow trout (11-19 C, greater than or equal to 5 ppm DO) occurred in about 11 vertical ft from a depth of about 21 ft down to about 31 ft.  The TDO3 value was 4.5 C.  Sufficient oxygen for salmonids (> 5 ppm) occurred down to a depth of about 82 ft where the temperature was 4.4 C.  Water temperatures actually warmed from a depth of 82 ft by 0.4 C to 4.8C at 92 ft.</p>",

Rainbow trout were in the 11 and 12 inch classes and probably represented yearlings stocking in the spring of 1992 and 1991 (based on aging trout from Pennington).  Northern pike (0.85/gillnet) had low abundance and a large average size (5.09/lb).  Length ranged from 14-35 inches.  Four age classes (2-5) were present and growth was good.  Largemouth bass (0.27/trapnet) was average in abundance for this lake class. Largemouth bass from gillnets and trapnets ranged from 8-14 inches long.  Ages 3-6 were present in roughly equal proportions.  Growth appeared to be good.  Walleye (0.15/gillnet) was present in low numbers. The two fish sampled were age 5 and 6, and were 15.8 and 17.6 inches long. Bluegills, at 182.55/trapnet, was the most abundant species sampled.  Measured fish were 3.3-7.7. The percentage of bluegill at least 7.0 inches long was 9% from trapnets and 30% from gillnets.  Six age classes were present (1-6).  Growth was slow. Average size was about six fish per pound (average for the lake class).  Pumpkinseed (1.18/trapnet) and black crappies (0.09/trapnet) were present in low abundance. Yellow perch (4.08/gillnet) was caught in numbers typical for the lake class.  Fish from 5.6-10.5 inches long were sampled.  Four age classes were present (3-6), with the 1989 and '87 year classes being most abundant, at 32% and 45% of the sample respectively.  Size (0.21 lb) was large for this lake class.  Yellow bullhead and brown bullhead were also sampled; in low abundance for yellows (0.27/trapnet) and average abundance for browns (0.27/trapnet).  Size averaged 0.87lbs and 0.83 lbs for yellows and browns, respectively.</p>",

Temperature and oxygen conditions suitable for trout occurred from a depth of about 20' down to around 70'.  Rainbow Trout were first stocked in 1982 and are stocked annual as yearlings (15,000/year) into the Mahnomen complex and connected Pennington.  Rainbow Trout provide for a popular fishery, especially early in the season.  Rainbow Trout were sampled at 4.6/gill net which was the highest catch to date.  Average length was 10.9\".   <br> \n <br> \nLake Trout were first stocked in Mahnomen in 2019 and are stocked biennially as yearlings (1,670/year).  No Lake Trout were sampled in this survey, although there are reports of anglers catching a few.  Tullibee (Cisco) were also stocked in 2019 to provide forage for the Lake Trout.  Tullibee (Cisco) were sampled in low numbers, when compared to similar lakes, at 0.6/gill net.   <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike were sampled in low numbers at 1.0/gill net.  Average length was 21.6\", with 8% in the protected 22\"-26\" slot, and 50% at least 26.0\" in length.  Northern Pike up to 31.7\" were sampled. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass were sampled in average numbers, when compared to similar lakes, at 1.3/gill net.  Average length was 12.0\", with fish up to 20.5\" sampled.  Smallmouth Bass were also sampled in average numbers at 0.3/gill net.  Average length was 17.2\".   <br> \n <br> \nMahnomen is a designated stream trout lake.  Designated stream trout lakes have additional angling regulations.  Be sure to consult the current Minnesota Fishing Regulations book for regulations, seasons, and possession limits before fishing designated trout waters.   <br> \n <br> \nZebra mussels are present in Mahnomen Lake.  Before and after launching lake users are required to inspect and remove any aquatic plants and animals from their watercraft and trailers as well as pull the plug and drain all water from the watercraft, including bilges, livewells and baitwells. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Mahnomen Mine Pit Lake is a complex of former open pit iron mines located north of Ironton that has filled with water.  The Mahnomen complex includes (from east to west) the Mahnomen No. 1, Louise, Mahnomen No. 2 and 3, Arco, and Alstead mines.  Mahnomen Mine Pit Lake is the largest mine pit lake in the Cuyuna Range at 270 acres and the deepest at over 500 ft in Mahnomen No 1.  The water is very clear with visibility to a depth of nearly 30 ft.  A concrete boat launch is located on the west end of Pennington Mine.  A channel on the northeast end of Pennington connects to Mahnomen Mine.  Mahnomen is within the Cuyuna Country State Recreation Area.   <br> \n <br> \nMahnomen is a designated stream trout lake.  Designated stream trout lakes have additional angling regulations.  Be sure to consult the current Minnesota Fishing Regulations book for regulations, seasons, and possession limits before fishing designated trout waters.  <br> \n <br> \nA survey of the fish community and aquatic habitat in Mahnomen Mine Pit Lake was conducted in 2010.  The fish community was assessed with 13 gill net and 11 trap net sets.  The total catch in the gill nets was fairly low at 14.2 fish per set, but this was comparable to other Cuyuna mine pit lakes where average gill net catches have ranged from 2 to 63 total fish in recent surveys (median 9.7).  Yellow perch were the most common fish in the gill nets with a catch of 8.0 fish per net.  The northern pike gill net catch was only 1.7 per set, but they comprised about one-half of the gill net catch biomass with a mean weight of 5 lbs per fish.  Northern pike captured in the gill nets ranged in length from 11 to 41 inches with an average length of 26 inches.  Smallmouth bass were the third most common fish in the gill nets and were fairly large with a mean length of nearly 15 inches; the largest was 18.9 inches long.  A few large walleyes were captured in the gill nets.   <br> \n <br> \nBluegills were the most common fish in the trap nets with average catch of 13 per set.  Most bluegills were from 3 to 7 inches long.  Black crappies were the second most abundant species in the trap nets at 2 per net and about 60% were greater than 8 inches, while in the gill nets most black crappies were around 10 to 13 inches long.  Catch of other species was fewer than 2 fish per trap net.   <br> \n <br> \nTemperature and oxygen conditions suitable for trout occurred from a depth of about 20 ft down to about 85 ft.  The water was extremely clear with visibility over 25 ft.  The water chemistry had low phosphorus and chlorophyll, but had fairly high ionic strength and alkalinity.   <br> \n <br> \nNear shore substrates were primarily sand and gravel.  The aquatic vegetation was fairly diverse compared to other nearby mine pit lakes; 23 species or species groups were identified in the August survey.  Submerged trees which extend nearly to the surface are common in areas of medium depth - about 10 to 30 ft deep.   <br> \n <br> \nStocking plans and stocking histories for the Mahnomen Mine Pit complex are all stored under the records for Pennington Mine Pit Lake (18-0439-00).  See the Pennington Mine 2010 survey report for more stocking and survey information.   <br> \n</p>",
