A fishing pier, available shoreline and other park amenities provides opportunities for fishing and family recreation.  The pond has been managed in the Fishing In the Neighborhood program and stocked each spring with bluegills and black crappies.  The abundance of black crappies was above average for this lake type and fish averaged 9.0 inches in length.  Bluegill abundance is above average and were the most abundant species captured.  The average length of bluegills in Smith Lake was 5 inches with about 25 percent of the fish over 7 inches in length.  </p>",

The entire lake is encompassed in a city park and the shoreline has been restored into wildflower and native prairie.  This restored shoreline helps to protect water quality and improve habitat for fish and wildlife.  Smith Lake has been managed in the Fishing in the Neighborhood (FiN) program since 2001 and is stocked annually with bluegill sunfish and black crappies. The last survey performed on this lake was in 2002. <br> \n <br> \nBluegills abundance was low for this type of lake.  Bluegills ranged in length from 5.0 to 7.4 inches with an average length of 6.5 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nThere were two black crappies captured during this survey.  They were 7.6 and 7.9 inches in length. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled were black bullhead, brooke stickleback and hybrid sunfish.  Black bullhead abundance had increased since the last survey in 2002.  Four painted and one snapping turtle were captured during this survey. <br> \n <br> \nFor more information about the FiN program or to see what FiN has done in your neighborhood, please visit us at:  www.mndnr.gov/fishing/fin. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",
