ONLY NOP YEARLINGS (1989 YEAR CLASS) SAMPLED SEEM TO BE FROM REPRODUCTION. BLG AVERAGED 6.75/TRAP NET WITH AGES 2-5 SAMPLED. BLC WERE RELATIVELY ABUNDANT IN TRAP NETS AVERAGING 22.50 WITH 2 YEAR OLDS MOST NUMEROUS. NOP ABUNDANCE IN GILL NETS WAS LOW (0.67 PER NET) WHILE IN TRAP NETS IT WAS HIGH (2.25 PER NET) WHEN COMPARED TO LOCAL MEDIANS OF 2.12 AND 0.5 PER GILL NET AND TRAP NET, RESPECTIVELY.

                "narrative": "<p>Cody Lake is a 257 acre lake located in Rice County near the town of Wheatland. A DNR-owned public access is located on the south side of the lake off Rice County Highway 59. Cody Lake has a maximum depth of 14 feet and is placed in Lake Class 43, which includes other Waterville Area Lakes such as Circle Lake (Rice County), Crystal Lake (Blue Earth County), Gorman Lake (Le Sueur County), and Pickeral Lake (Freeborn County). It is primarily managed for Northern Pike and Yellow Perch and secondarily for Bluegill. The management plan calls for stocking Northern Pike fry 2 out of 3 years and Yellow Perch and Bluegill adults following evidence of a winterkill. Low dissolved oxygen levels recorded during the winter of 2013-2014 and results of a winterkill assessment the following spring suggest Cody Lake experienced a strong winterkill. Bluegill, Yellow Perch, and Northern Pike adults and Northern Pike fry were stocked in 2014 as a result. Cody Lake was surveyed the week of August 10, 2015 as part of a regular monitoring program conducted by the Minnesota DNR. This survey was intended to assess the fish community by deploying six gill nets and eight trap nets, as well as recording water quality parameters. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike <br> \nA total of 25 Northern Pike were sampled with gill nets for a catch rate of 4.2/net, indicating moderate to high numbers were present. Since 1990, catch rates have varied from 0/net in 1992 to 11.0/net in 2010 with an average of 3.7/net. Lengths ranged from 11.5 to 23.4 inches with an average of 19.6 inches. An additional 3 Northern Pike ranging from 19.8 to 23.9 inches were sampled with trap nets. All fish from both gears were 1 year old with the exception of one \"young of the year\" fish. Overall, the Northern Pike population in Cody Lake consists of young, fast growing fish that were likely a result of the 2014 fry stocking. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch <br> \nA total of 371 Yellow Perch were sampled with gill nets for a catch rate of 61.8/net, indicating high numbers were present. This was easily the highest catch rate ever recorded in Cody Lake. Since 1990, catch rates have varied from 0.2/net in 1990 to 61.8/net in 2015 with an average of 16.2/net. Lengths in 2015 ranged from 7.2 to 11.9 inches with an average of 8.6 inches. Fish from both gears were 0 to 3 years old with three year-classes present. Two year old fish accounted for approximately 72% of the sample. Much of the sample was likely fish that were stocked as adults in 2014 following the winterkill with the hope they would immediately reproduce and repopulate the lake. Although few fish were sampled from the 2014 year-class, it is possible they were not large enough to be captured by the nets at the time of the survey. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill <br> \nA total of 539 Bluegills were sampled with trap nets for a catch rate of 67.4/net, indicating high numbers were present. This was the most ever sampled in Cody Lake. Since 1990, catch rates have varied from 0.2/net in 2010 to 67.4/net in 2015 with an average of 15.5/net. Lengths ranged from 3.0 to 9.1 inches with an average of 4.7. Just one fish was larger than 6.0 inches. Bluegills were sampled in high numbers with gill nets as well with a total of 473 sampled for a catch rate of 78.8/net. All fish were 1 year old except for one 8 year old fish. In 2015, the Bluegill population in Cody Lake was dominated by small fish that were likely offspring of the adults stocked in 2014. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Bullhead <br> \nBlack Bullheads were the most commonly sampled fish with gillnets in 2015. A total of 813 ranging from 4.3 to 11.1 inches were sampled for a catch rate of 135.5/net, indicating moderate to high numbers were present. Since 1990, catch rates have varied from 15.0/net in 2010 to 135.5/net in 2015 with an average of 72.8/net. Black Bullheads continue to thrive due to frequent winterkills in Cody Lake. <br> \n <br> \nCommon Carp <br> \nNo Common Carp were sampled in 2015 for the first time ever. Since 1990, trap net catch rates have varied from 3.5/net in 1990 to 53.8/net in 2010 with an average of 13.4/net. It seems the 2013-2014 winterkill was strong enough to reduce the Common Carp population in Cody Lake to record lows. Unfortunately, one Common Carp was sampled the following week in connected Phelps Lake so a complete extirpation from Cody Lake is highly unlikely and Common Carp numbers will likely rebound in the absence of winterkills. <br> \n <br> \nOther Species <br> \nOther species sampled in 2015 include Yellow Bullhead and hybrid sunfish. <br> \n <br> \nWater Quality Parameters <br> \nWater quality parameter measurements included secchi depth, water temperature, and dissolved oxygen readings. At the time of this survey, absolute secchi depth was 0.6 feet indicating poor water clarity. Water temperatures and dissolved oxygen readings throughout the water column ranged from 77.9 degrees Fahrenheit and 13.6 ppm at the surface to 75.4 degrees Fahrenheit and 0.1 ppm at 10 feet. A thermocline where dissolved oxygen fell to less than 1.0 ppm existed around 6 feet. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers can play an important role in maintaining or improving a fish population by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for consumption, while encouraging the release of medium to large fish that may contribute to natural recruitment.  This practice helps maintain balance in the fish community and provides anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future.  Additionally, smaller fish often taste better and have fewer contaminants than larger, older fish from the same water body. <br> \n <br> \nShoreline property owners also play an important role in the overall health of an aquatic ecosystem, including the fish population.  Natural shorelines, including vegetation, woody debris, and bottom substrates, provide valuable habitat for fish and wildlife, help maintain water quality, and reduce bank erosion.  By leaving natural shorelines unaltered or restoring them to natural conditions, shoreline property owners are doing their part to maintain or improve a healthy ecosystem in the lake and protect the resource for future generations. <br> \n <br> \n-Sky Wigen, Fisheries Specialist  <br> \n</p>",

BLC AND BLG, AGED AT 2 AND 3, WERE STOCKED IN THE FALL OF 1990 AT 19.3 LB./ACRE.  BLC ABUNDANCE IS UNCHANGED, AVERAGING 20.15/TRAP NET COMPARED TO 22.50/TRAP NET IN 1990.  BLC IN 1990 WERE DOMINATED BY 2 AND 3 YEAR OLDS.  BLC GROWTH IS SLOW FOR ALL AGE CLASSES SAMPLED.  LENGTH AT ANNULUS HAS DECLINED SINCE 1990, POSSIBLY REFLECTING SLOWER GROWTH (PRIOR TO STOCKING) OF STOCKED FISH.  BLC ARE NOW WELL REPRESENTED BY 3 AND 4 YEAR OLDS.  AT THIS TIME, THE EXTENT OF THE STOCKED BLC'S CONTRIBUTION IS UNCLEAR.  BLG HAVE INCREASED FROM 6.75/TRAP NET IN 1990 TO 15.25/ TRAP NET.  THE INCREASED NET CATCH OF BLG AND NOT OF BLC MAY BE RELATED TO STOCKING DENSITIES, AS BLG REPRESENTED 16.6 LB/ACRE AND BLC REPRESENTED 2.7 LB/ACRE OF THE 19.3 LB/ACRE STOCKED.  BLG AGES 2-5 WERE SAMPLED IN 1990 COMPARED TO 3-5 AGE CLASSES IN 1991.  BLG GROWTH IS VARIABLE FOR EACH AGE CLASS SAMPLED, WITH AGE 3 FISH LONGER, AGE 5 FISH SHORTER, AND AGE 4 FISH IN THE RANGE OF THE STATE AVERAGE.  WAE AVERAGED 4.00/TRAP NET COMPARED TO 0.25/TRAP NET IN 1990.  IT IS SUSPECTED THAT THE AGE 3 WAES (1988 YEAR CLASS) MIGRATED FROM LAKE PEPIN, WHICH SHARES A COMMON OUTLET WITH CODY, SOON AFTER BEING STOCKED.  THE LENGTH RANGE OF THESE WAE, AS 2 YEAR OLDS, IN THE 1990 SURVEY WAS 12.0-13.9 INCHES, WHILE THE LENGTH RANGE OF THE 3 YEAR OLDS IN 1991 WAS 10.0-12.9 INCHES.  LENGTH AT AGE 2 IN 1990 WAS 9.7 INCHES, AND LENGTH AT AGE 3 IN 1991 WAS 10.8 INCHES. EXPLOITATION MAY EXPLAIN THE DECREASE IN LENGTH RANGE AND THE SMALL INCREASE IN LENGTH AT ANNULUS FROM 1990 TO 1991.  THE AGE 2 FISH IN 1990 WERE THE FAST GROWING FISH OF THE 1988 YEAR CLASS, AND WERE WELL WITHIN THE LENGTH RANGE ACCEPTABLE TO AREA ANGLERS - SO WERE PROBABLY CROPPED OFF.  THE FISH CAPTURED IN 1991 WERE THE SLOWER GROWING FISH OF THE YEAR CLASS; NOT LARGE ENOUGH TO BE ACCEPTABLE IN 1990, BUT ENTERING INTO THE ACCEPTABLE SIZE RANGE IN 1991.  NOP INCREASED FROM 2.25/TRAP NET IN 1990 TO 4.00/TRAP NET.  AGES 2 AND 3 NOP WERE SAMPLED IN EQUAL NUMBERS.  BLB DECREASED FROM 883.75/TRAP NET TO 204.50/TRAP NET. CAP AVERAGED 7.50/TRAP NET COMPARED TO 3.50/TRAP NET IN 1990.  A GROUP OF SMALLER CAP IS NOW PRESENT, RANGING FROM 10.0-13.0 INCHES, COMPARED TO THE 16.0 - 20.0 FISH SAMPLED IN 1990.  OTHER SPECIES PRESENT IN LOW ABUNDANCE INCLUDE PMK AND GSF.</p>",

IN 1990, BLG AND BLC WERE STOCKED AT 19.3 LBS/ACRE INTO CODY AND PHELPS LAKES. SAMPLING IN 1992 YIELDED 33.7 BLC/TRAP NET.  THIS REPRESENTS AN INCREASE FROM THE 20.1 BLC/TRAP NET SAMPLED IN 1991.  THE GROWTH RATE OF BLC IN CODY LAKE IS GOOD, EXCEEDING THE STATE WIDE AVERAGE. THE 1992 BLG CATCH RATE OF 2.5/TRAP NET IS DOWN FROM THE 1991 SAMPLE OF 15.3/TRAP NET.  THE 1992 BLG CATCH RATE FALLS BELOW THE 25TH PERCENTILE RANGE FOR CLASS 43 LAKES.  THIS DECLINE MAY INDICATE MIGRATION, POOR RECRUITMENT AND SURVIVAL, OR HIGH EXPLOITATION.  THE GROWTH RATE OF BLGS IN CODY LAKE IS SLOWER THAN THE STATE WIDE AVERAGE. IN 1992, WAE AVERAGED 85.5/GILL NET.  MOST OF THESE FISH WERE TIGHTLY CLUSTERED BETWEEN 13-16 INCHES AND AGES 3-6.  AGES OF THESE FISH DO NOT COINCIDE WELL WITH PREVIOUS WAE STOCKINGS.  THIS WAS EXPLAINED IN THE 1991 SURVEY AS POSSIBLE IMMIGRATION FROM LAKE PEPIN, AND COULD ALSO BE DUE TO IMPROPER AGING.  THE 1992 WAE CATCH WAS DOMINATED BY 4 YEAR OLD FISH.  IN 1991, THE WAE CATCH WAS DOMINATED BY 3 YEAR OLD FISH.  THE GROWTH RATE OF WAE IN CODY LAKE IS SLOWER THAN THE STATE AVERAGE.  IN 1992, NOP AVERAGED 0/GILL NET AND 1.5/TRAP NET.  IN 1991, NOP AVERAGED 4/TRAP NET.  THE DECLINE IN THE 1992 NOP CATCH RATE MAY INDICATE A LOWER ABUNDANCE OF NOP DUE TO MIGRATION FROM THE LAKE, MORTALITY (ANGLING OR NATURAL), OR LACK OF MOVEMENT DURING THE ASSESSMENT.  THE GROWTH RATE OF NOP IN CODY LAKE EXCEEDS THE STATE AVERAGE.  BLB WERE SAMPLED AT 204/TRAP NET (3.5-8 INCHES) IN 1991 AND 301/TRAP NET (3.5-8 INCHES) IN 1992.  THE AVERAGE WEIGHT PER SET ALSO INCREASED FROM 19 LBS/TRAP NET IN 1991 TO 34.5 LBS/TRAP NET IN 1992.  THE CATCH RATE OF CARP ALSO INCREASED FROM 7.5/TRAP NET IN 1991 TO 9/TRAP NET IN 1992.  OTHER SPECIES PRESENT IN LOW ABUNDANCE INCLUDE YEP, GSF, AND WTS.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Cody Lake is a 257-acre lake located in Rice County near the town of Wheatland. A DNR-owned public access is located on the south side of the lake off Rice County Highway 59. Cody Lake has a maximum depth of 14 feet. Walleye fry were stocked in 2018 and 2019 following a suspected winterkill.  <br> \n <br> \nCody Lake was surveyed the week of 16 August 2021 as part of a regular monitoring program conducted by the Minnesota DNR. This survey was intended to assess the fish community. Originally six gill nets and nine trap nets were planned to be used in 2021, but initial net catches were high and only two gill nets and 3 trap nets were used. Water quality parameters were also measured. <br> \n <br> \nA total of 88 Yellow Perch were sampled with gill nets for a catch rate of 44.0/net, indicating moderate numbers were present. Yellow Perch catch rates have varied from 0.2/net to 61.8/net with an average of 20.8/net since 1990. Yellow Perch ranged from 6.1 to 10.2 inches with an average of 8.3 inches in 2021. Fish from both gears were 2 to 4 years old with three year-classes present. Three year old fish accounted for approximately 66% of the sample.  <br> \n <br> \nBlack Bullheads were the most sampled fish with gillnets in 2021. A total of 1,025 ranging from 3.0 to 14.5 inches were sampled for a catch rate of 512.5/net, indicating extremely high numbers were present. Black Bullhead catch rates have varied from 15.0/net to 512.5/net with an average of 146.1/net since 1990. The Black Bullhead catch rate in 2021 was more than three times the previous historic high catch rate of 135.5 in 2015. Black Bullheads continue to thrive due to frequent, mild winterkills in Cody Lake. <br> \n <br> \nCommon Carp were sampled at 278.5/gill net which is the highest rate on record. Common Carp gill catch rates have varied from 0.0/net to 278.5/net with an average of 56.1/net since 1990. If the high gill net catch from 2021 is removed, the historic average is 11.6/net. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye fry were stocked in Cody Lake in 2018 and 2019 after evidence of a winterkill in 2018. Anecdotally, the Walleye fishing was good during the fall and winter of 2020-2021. Unfortunately, a low number of Walleye were sampled in 2021. This could have been due to a partial winterkill as low, but not critically low, dissolved oxygen levels were found in the winter of 2021. An average of 3.5 Walleye were sampled per gill net in the 2021 survey. These fish ranged from 5.7 to 15.3 inches in length.  <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled in low numbers included Black Crappie, Bluegill, and Green Sunfish. Although Northern pike are a primary management species, no Northern Pike have been stocked since the 2018 winterkill. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers can play an important role in maintaining or improving a fish population by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for consumption, while encouraging the release of medium to large fish that may contribute to natural recruitment.  This practice helps maintain balance in the fish community and provides anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future.  Additionally, smaller fish often taste better and have fewer contaminants than larger, older fish from the same water body. <br> \n <br> \nShoreline property owners also play an important role in the overall health of an aquatic ecosystem, including the fish population.  Natural shorelines, including vegetation, woody debris, and bottom substrates, provide valuable habitat for fish and wildlife, help maintain water quality, and reduce bank erosion.  By leaving natural shorelines unaltered or restoring them to natural conditions, shoreline property owners are doing their part to maintain or improve a healthy ecosystem in the lake and protect the resource for future generations. <br> \n <br> \n-Tyler Fellows, fisheries specialist <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Cody Lake in Rice County is a 257 acre lake located east of Montgomery. A DNR-owned public access is located on the south side of the lake, across from the access to Phelps Lake near the channel that connects Cody and Phelps. Cody Lake was surveyed the week of August 11, 2010 to monitor the fish community.  <br> \n <br> \nCommon carp were the most abundant fish in the assessment. Carp averaged 42 fish per gill net lift and 54 carp per trap net lift. 94 percent were under 10 inches in length. Carp ageing structures were not collected but presumably the majority of fish were young of the year and yearling carp responding to the winterkill vacancy.  <br> \n <br> \nBlack bullhead were the next most abundant fish in the assessment. Bullheads averaged 15 fish per gill net lift and 52 carp per trap net lift. Bullheads were variable in size with presumably several year classes represented. Black bullheads ranged in size from 3.1 to 13.2 inches in length. Average size was 8 inches. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch seemed to come through the partial winterkill of 2009-2010 fairly well. Perch averaged 17 fish per gill net lift. Perch ranged between 7.1 and 10.6 inches, with an average of 8.9 inches. Reproduction appears successful as young of the year perch were observed in seine hauls during the IBI survey. <br> \n <br> \nThe northern pike population was made up of young individuals. Pike averaged 11 fish per gill net lift. 62 percent of fish were under 15 inches in length, likely all young of the year fish. No fish were larger than 24 inches. Pike have been stocked in Cody Lake in 2007, 2008, 2009, and 2010.  <br> \n <br> \nBluegill and black crappie were observed at trace levels. With time and an absence of winterkill, bluegills and crappies should become more abundant. Also observed in the survey were brook stickleback, fathead minnow, green sunfish, and tadpole madtom. <br> \n <br> \nAnglers can help maintain or improve the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest. Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for table fare, but encourages release of medium to large-sized fish. Releasing these fish can help maintain balance in the fish community in Cody Lake and provide anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future.  <br> \n <br> \nShoreline areas on the land and into the shallow water provide essential habitat for fish and wildlife that live in or near Minnesota's lakes. Overdeveloped shorelines cannot support the fish, wildlife, and clean water that are associated with natural undeveloped lakes. Shoreline habitat consists of aquatic plants, woody plants, and natural lake bottom soils.  <br> \n <br> \nPlants in the water and at the water's edge provide habitat, prevent erosion, and absorb excess nutrients. Shrubs, trees, and woody debris such as fallen trees or limbs provide good habitat both above and below the water and should be left in place. By leaving a buffer strip of natural vegetation along the shoreline, property owners can reduce erosion, help maintain water quality, and provide habitat and travel corridors for wildlife.</p>",
