                "narrative": "<p>Big Elbow has traditionally been regarded as a good walleye, northern pike, crappie lake.  Walleye fishing was considered slow during the 1957 and 1971 surveys.  Later surveys report improved walleye angling in recent years.  Bluegills were rare enough that they were not sought by most anglers before the mid-seventies.  Examination of historical netting records supports those angler perceptions.     Test netting records show sizable increases in abundances of walleye, northern pike, and bluegill since the initial survey in 1957.  Given the fact that the increases continue even after stocking of both walleye and northern pike was discontinued in the eighties, they are difficult to explain.  Fortunately, unlike many lakes, the yellow perch population has survived (so far) the increased predation.  Often, significant increases in a lake's predator population (walleye, northern pike) will cause their primary forage (yellow perch) population to crash.  Walleye, northern pike, and bluegill populations cannot continue to increase indefinitely.  Undoubtedly, abundances of each will peak in the near future.     For the present, though, anglers can enjoy high numbers of walleye averaging about a pound and a quarter, good numbers of small pike with the chance at a large one, and large numbers of bluegill of mixed sizes up to nine inches.  Black crappie, largemouth bass, cisco (tullibee), and abundant rock bass are also caught by anglers.  An additional target of some anglers are the abundant and relatively large crayfish.     For those who capture crayfish from Elbow Lake, it is requested that they transport none of them to another body of water.  First, because it's against the law.  Last, because the lake contains a high portion of the non-native rusty crayfish.  Rusty crayfish are thought to have been imported in bait buckets from other states where they are common.  They are known to have caused problems with fish and vegetation when introduced in some Wisconsin lakes and should not be spread in Minnesota.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Elbow Lake supports a diverse fishery with several species including walleye, northern pike, black crappie, largemouth bass, and bluegill.  Natural reproduction of walleye was especially successful from the mid 1980s to the mid 1990s, as was walleye angling success.  Walleye numbers have since declined from all-time highs in 1994.  In 2000, the mean test net catch was 6.4 walleyes per set while the lake's historical average was 11.1 walleyes per set.  These walleyes averaged just under a pound and a half each.Northern pike averaged just under two pounds each but a good range of sizes were present.  Net catches of this species continued to be near the lake's highest recorded catch from 1994.Bluegills continued to be much more abundant than they were in the 1950s and 1970s.  Although they averaged only about five inches long, fish over eight inches were found.  There appeared to be good natural reproduction in recent years (especially 1997).  Bluegill growth rates were about normal and few older fish were sampled.  These are indicators that most bluegills are probably being harvested as soon as they reach \"keeper\" size.Black crappie and largemouth bass were present in modest numbers.  Tullibee (cisco) net catches remained relatively abundant, indicating that water quality in Elbow Lake is still good enough to support this cool water species.  Water quality is important to lakeshore owners and lake users as well as fish populations.  Several studies have shown that water quality and property values are directly correlated.  Decreasing water quality results in decreasing lakeshore property values.Some ways in which landowners and anglers can help maintain property values, water quality, and fish populations include: (1) exceeding shoreline setbacks for buildings and septic systems, (2) not fertilizing lawns or using phosphorus free fertilizers, (3) leaving shoreline buffer zones of unmown, natural vegetation, (4) leaving aquatic vegetation (especially emergents like bulrushes and cattails) mostly intact when obtaining access to open water, (5) releasing medium to large fish and (6) acquiring DNR permits for aquatic plant removal and shoreline alterations.  Guides are available for riparian owners who desire to alter shoreline areas while minimizing harm to the lake.To summarize the fish community in Elbow Lake, there were good numbers of walleye, bluegill, northern pike, and tullibee.  Large pike (those over 30 inches) were present as were nice sized bluegills.  There were no black bullheads found since 1979, one sign of good water quality.  Yellow perch, which are forage for walleye and northern pike, were beginning to increase following extremely low numbers in 1997.  Black crappie and largemouth bass were also present but difficult to assess with standard mid-summer test netting gear since bass are relatively \"net-shy\" and crappies are typically suspended over deep water where they are not vulnerable to nets.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Elbow Lake continues to support a diverse fishery containing several popular gamefish and panfish species including walleye, northern pike, black crappie, largemouth bass, bluegill, and tullibee (cisco).  Poor natural reproduction of walleyes during the early 1990's led to slightly below normal test net catches in 1997 and 2000.  Natural reproduction of this species picked up in the late 1990's and test net catches rebounded to Elbow Lake's historical average in 2003.  These walleyes averaged 1.7 pounds.Northern pike catches continued to be higher than normal for Elbow Lake.  These fish also averaged about 1.7 pounds each.  Sampled pike were generally young and somewhat slower growing than in the past.  The overabundance of small pike and the decrease in yellow perch abundance are probably responsible for slowed growth rates of northern pike.Test net catches of bluegill remained at least twice as high in 2003 as they were in years before 1988.  Bluegills averaged 5.6 inches and a few over eight inches were caught.Shoreline owners are encouraged to use good land stewardship practices to protect the water quality, the fishery, and property values on Elbow Lake.  Shoreline buffer zones of native vegetation are especially helpful for reducing erosion.  Aquatic vegetation should be left intact as much as possible.  Emergent plants like bulrush and cattail are particularly valuable as fish spawning, rearing, and feeding areas, along with reducing shoreline erosion and absorbing nutrients and pollutants.  Anglers are encouraged to release medium and larger fish and keep smaller ones for eating to sustain balanced fish populations.  Northern pike 24 inches and larger should be released to control the overabundance of smaller pike and improve the overall health of the fish community.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Elbow Lake continues to support a diverse fishery containing several popular gamefish and panfish species including walleye, northern pike, black crappie, largemouth bass, bluegill, and tullibee (cisco).  Although this lake is regularly stocked with walleye fingerlings, the walleye population seems to be driven by natural reproduction.  Recruitment from stocking or natural reproduction has not been especially good during the past few years and catch rates of walleye in Elbow Lake reflect this.  Stocking strategies may be altered in the near future in attempt to bolster the walleye fishery toward the long range management goal.  Although walleye abundance appears to be lower than normal for this lake, the average walleye size has increased.  Walleyes sampled in 2006 averaged 19.7 inches and 2.9 pounds. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike catches continued to be higher than normal for Elbow Lake.  Catch rates have been higher since the mid 1980's than they were prior to that time.  These fish averaged about 2.3 pounds each.  Sampled pike were generally young with good growth rates. <br> \n <br> \nTest net catches of bluegill remained several times as high in 2006 as they were in years before 1988.  Bluegills averaged 4.6 inches and only two over eight inches were caught in the sample of 560 fish.   Higher abundances of bluegills were accompanied by slower growth rates in 2006. <br> \n <br> \nShoreline owners are encouraged to use good land stewardship practices to protect the water quality, the fishery, and property values on Elbow Lake.  Shoreline buffer zones of native vegetation are especially helpful for reducing erosion.  Aquatic vegetation should be left intact as much as possible.  Emergent plants like bulrush and cattail are particularly valuable as fish spawning, rearing, and feeding areas, along with reducing shoreline erosion and absorbing nutrients and pollutants.  Anglers are encouraged to release medium and larger fish and keep smaller ones for eating to sustain balanced fish populations.  Northern pike under 24 inches should be harvested and larger ones should be released to control the overabundance of smaller pike and improve the overall health of the fish community. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Elbow Lake continues to support a diverse fishery containing several popular gamefish and panfish species including walleye, northern pike, black crappie, largemouth bass, bluegill, and tullibee (cisco).  Although this lake is regularly stocked with walleye fingerlings, the walleye population seems to be driven by natural reproduction.  Recruitment from stocking or natural reproduction has not been good during the past few years and catch rates of walleye in Elbow Lake reflect this.  Although walleye abundance is currently low for this lake, the average walleye size continues to increase.  Walleyes sampled in 2012 averaged 20.2 inches and 3.0 pounds.  Walleye fingerling stocking rates were doubled beginning in 2011.  Hopefully, this will help to move future walleye catches upward toward the goal of 10 walleyes per net.  The next two evaluations should be good indicators whether the fingerling stocking increases are successful. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike catches in 2012 continued to be higher than normal for Elbow Lake.  For reasons that are not clear, catch rates have been higher since the mid 1980's than they were prior to that time.  These fish averaged about 2.4 pounds each.  Sampled pike were generally young with good growth rates. <br> \n <br> \nTest net catches of bluegill were near the lake's historical average of 24 per net.  Bluegill catch rates have been consistently higher since the late 1980's than in prior years.  In 2012, bluegills averaged 5.1 inches and none over eight inches were caught in the sample of 262 fish.   Bluegill growth rates remained slower than normal in 2012.  It takes about eight years to grow a seven-inch bluegill in Elbow Lake. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie catch rates were up in 2012.  In fact, the trap net catch rate reached a historical high for Elbow Lake, but was within the normal range for class 25 lakes.  Sampled crappies averaged just under nine inches in length and some were as large as 13 inches. <br> \n <br> \nShoreline owners are encouraged to use good land stewardship practices to protect the water quality, the fishery, and property values on Elbow Lake.  Shoreline buffer zones of native vegetation are especially helpful for reducing erosion.  Aquatic vegetation should be left intact as much as possible.  Emergent plants like bulrush and cattail are particularly valuable as fish spawning, rearing, and feeding areas, along with reducing shoreline erosion and absorbing nutrients and pollutants.  Anglers are encouraged to release medium and larger fish and keep smaller ones for eating to sustain balanced fish populations.  Northern pike under 24 inches should be harvested and larger ones should be released to control the overabundance of smaller pike and improve the overall health of the fish community.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Elbow (Big Elbow) is a 986-acre, class 25 lake located in north-central Becker County, within the White Earth Indian Reservation.  The lake has a max depth of 76.0 feet and a mean water clarity reading of 11.0 feet.  The surrounding watershed is mixed hardwood and conifer forest.  Of the six small inlets, Elbow Lake Creek (designated trout stream) and Bear Creek (surrounded by an Aquatic Management Area (AMA)) have the most continuous flows.  The Otter Tail River outlet exits the southern tip of the lake and flows to Little Bemidji Lake.  Elbow Lake is considered the source of the Otter Tail River.  A resort is located in the northeast portion of the lake and is near a public boat access located in one of the northeastern bays of the lake.  A boat access is also available from Little Bemidji Lake through the Otter Tail River outlet. <br> \n <br> \nA standard survey was completed on Elbow Lake in July 2018 to assess the fish community.  The survey was conducted using nine gill nets and 12 trap nets.  The primary gamefish species targeted by anglers in this lake include Walleye, Bluegill, Black Crappie, Largemouth Bass, Northern Pike, and Yellow Perch. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance continued to be below the historical average for this lake.  Walleyes were sampled with sizes ranging from 11.7 to 28.8 inches and had a respectable average size of 18.0 inches.  Age and catch data indicated six year classes were sampled.  Elbow Lake is stocked with Walleye fry every year, but past studies have suggested that natural reproduction of Walleye also occurs. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike abundance was at a record high in 2018.  Northern Pike lengths ranged from 14.3 to 35.1 inches and averaged 23.1 inches.  Northern Pike averaged 2.8 pounds with 36% of the Northern Pike being greater than 24 inches in length.  One Muskellunge with a length of 40.2 inches was sampled in a trap net.  This was unexpected, but not surprising, since Muskellunge are stocked into Many Point Lake, which is located downstream of Elbow Lake. <br> \n <br> \nThe Bluegill population was high in abundance, slow growing, and small in average size.  Bluegills over 8.0 inches are present, but the majority of the population was between 3.5 to 7.5 inches long. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch abundance was near the historical average, but more abundant in nets than during the last survey that was conducted in 2015.  Yellow Perch lengths ranged from 5.4 to 9.3 inches and averaged 6.7 inches in length. <br> \n <br> \nTullibee (Cisco) lengths ranged from 7.3 to 15.3 inches.  Abundance decreased from 2015 but is still greater than the historical average for the lake.  Tullibee are a high protein food source for large predators such as Walleye, Northern Pike, and Muskellunge. <br> \n <br> \nOther species sampled during this survey included hybrid sunfish, Pumpkinseed, Rock Bass, White Sucker, and Yellow Bullhead. <br> \n <br> \nMinnow traps were set in Elbow Lake for Rusty Crayfish, a known aquatic invasive species (AIS).  The population is believed to be lower than previous years, with a total of 19 Rusty Crayfish captured in the minnow traps in 2018.  AIS can be transferred from infested to non-infested waters by anglers, boaters, and lake shore owners and can negatively impact lakes and aquatic communities.  To avoid the spreading of AIS to other waters, please follow the current AIS regulations. <br> \n <br> \nAquatic habitat in Elbow Lake included areas of dense chara (a native aquatic plant) near the shoreline, submergent vegetation in shallow bays and shoreline breaks, and emergent vegetation present in multiple areas.  The continued protection of vegetation is important for shoreline stabilization and aquatic communities in Elbow Lake.</p>",

The lake lies within the White Earth Indian Reservation and is surrounded by mixed hardwood and conifer forest.  A survey intended to target Walleye was performed on Elbow Lake in July 2021 in an effort to evaluate the Walleye fry stocking regime implemented in 2017 and the abundance of Northern Pike and Yellow Perch. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance in 2021 was similar to past surveys. Sampled Walleye ranged in length between 12 and 30 inches and averaged 20 inches long, comparable to the 2018 survey. Walleye in Elbow Lake reached an average length of 16 inches by age four, exhibiting average growth rates relative to statewide indices. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike abundance continues to remain above average. Sampled pike measured between eight and 36 inches, averaging 23 inches long. Approximately 38% of sampled pike were 24 inches or longer and 11% were 30 inches or longer.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch abundance in Elbow Lake has increased in recent years, but is still below average. Sampled perch averaged seven inches long and ranged in length between 5 and 10 inches.    <br> \n <br> \nCisco abundance was similar to past surveys, with fish averaging 11 inches.  Additional species sampled included hybrid sunfish, Bluegill, Rock Bass, Black Crappie, Bullhead (Brown and Yellow), Green Sunfish, Largemouth Bass, Pumpkinseed, and White Sucker.  </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Elbow Lake supports a diverse fishery with several species including walleye, northern pike, black crappie, largemouth bass, and bluegill.  For unknown reasons, natural reproduction of walleye was especially successful from the mid 1980s to the mid 1990s, as was walleye angling success.  Walleye numbers have recently declined from all-time highs in 1994, yet walleye abundance remains above normal when compared to similar lakes and close to the lakes historical mean.Walleye growth rates were somewhat slow in Elbow Lake.  This may be a reflection of the high walleye population during the past decade.  Yellow perch, the main forage of both walleye and northern pike, have drastically decreased in abundance since the late 1980s.  Crashes in forage fish populations can sometimes result in short term increases in fishing success but longer term decreases in predator (northern pike and walleye) growth rates.The average size of bluegill sunfish has increased significantly in recent years.  A very strong 1991 year class provided an ample supply of seven to nine inch bluegills in Elbow Lake.  There was also some relatively good age groups of younger sunfish coming on.Tullibee (cisco) populations remain relatively abundant, indicating that water quality in Elbow Lake is still good enough to support this cool water species.  Water quality is important to lakeshore owners and lake users as well as fish populations.  Several studies have shown that water quality and property values are directly correlated.  Decreasing water quality results in decreasing lakeshore property values.Some ways in which landowners and anglers can help maintain property values, water quality, and fish populations include (1) exceeding shoreline setbacks for buildings and septic systems, (2) not fertilizing lawns or using phosphorus free fertilizers, (3) leaving shoreline buffer zones of unmown, natural vegetation, (4) leaving aquatic vegetation (especially emergents like bulrushes and cattails) mostly intact when obtaining access to open water, (5) releasing medium to large fish and (6) acquiring DNR permits for aquatic plant removal and shoreline alterations.  Guides are available for riparian owners who desire to alter shoreline areas while minimizing harm to the lake.To summarize the fish community in Elbow Lake, there are good numbers of walleye, bluegill, northern pike, and tullibee.  Large pike (those over 30 inches long) are present as are nice sized bluegills.  There are few black bullheads, a sign of good water quality.  Hopefully, yellow perch numbers will rebound.  Black crappie and largemouth bass are also present but difficult to assess with standard \"mid-summer test netting gear since bass are relatively \"net-shy\" and crappies are typically suspended over deep water where they are not vulnerable to nets.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>This survey was completed in 2015 to assess the current condition of the fish population within Elbow Lake.  During this assessment, gill nets, trap nets, and electrofishing were used.  Aquatic vegetation and non-game fish were also assessed in 2015, although data from those assessments are not included with this report.  Elbow Lake continues to support a diverse fishery containing several popular gamefish and panfish species including Walleye, Northern Pike, Black Crappie, Largemouth Bass, Bluegill, and Tullibee (Cisco).   <br> \n <br> \nAlthough Walleye abundance is currently low for this lake, the average size of Walleyes is respectable.  Walleyes sampled in 2015 averaged 19.3 inches and 2.8 pounds.  Elbow Lake is stocked with Walleye fingerlings in odd-numbered years and stocking rates were doubled beginning in 2011.  Success of this higher level of stocking will be assessed with results of this and future assessments.  Natural reproduction of Walleyes does occur within Elbow Lake, although most Walleyes sampled during the 2015 effort were stocked fish.   <br> \n <br> \nThe Northern Pike catch rate in 2015 decreased slightly from the 2012 assessment.  The catch rate in 2015 was 7.2 per gill net, which is still above the normal rate for Elbow Lake (6.3 per gill net).  Average size of Northern Pike sampled was 23.2 inches, and Pike averaged about 3.1 pounds each.  Sampled pike were generally young (most fish were between three and five years old) with good growth rates. <br> \n <br> \nTest net catches of Bluegill increased from the previous assessment, and are currently above the historical average for Elbow Lake (24.2 per trap net).  The Bluegill catch rate in 2015 was 42.3 per trap net and fish had an average size of 4.7 inches.  The maximum size of Bluegill caught was 8.1 inches, but few fish were found to be this size.   Bluegill growth rates were slower than normal, taking about eight years to grow a seven-inch bluegill in Elbow Lake. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie catch rates decreased in 2015, following a record high peak in the population in 2012, but are still within the normal range for similar lakes.  Sampled crappies ranged between 6.0 inches and 11.8 inches, averaging just over eight inches. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass were also sampled, with fish primarily between 13 inches and 17 inches long.  Other sampled fish species included Bowfin, Brown and Yellow Bullhead, Green, Hybrid and Pumpkinseed Sunfish, Rock Bass, Cisco, and White Sucker.  Of these, only Cisco were more abundant than expected for other similar lakes.  Cisco ranged from 7.3 to 15.0 inches with a mean of 9.8 inches.  Minnow traps were also set in an attempt to sample Rusty Crayfish, a known invasive species within Elbow Lake.  Four Rusty Crayfish were sampled, but the population is believed to be lower than previously observed in Elbow Lake. <br> \n   <br> \nShoreline owners are encouraged to use good land stewardship practices to protect the aquatic habitat within Elbow Lake.  Shoreline buffer zones of native vegetation are especially helpful for reducing erosion.  Aquatic vegetation should be left intact as much as possible, preserving spawning and rearing habitats, and reducing shoreline erosion while absorbing nutrients and pollutants.  Anglers are encouraged to release medium and larger fish and keep smaller ones for eating to sustain balanced fish populations.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Elbow Lake continues to support a diverse fishery containing several popular gamefish and panfish species including walleye, northern pike, black crappie, largemouth bass, bluegill, and tullibee (cisco).  Although this lake is regularly stocked with walleye fingerlings, the walleye population seems to be driven by natural reproduction.  Recruitment from stocking or natural reproduction has not been especially good during the past few years and catch rates of walleye in Elbow Lake reflect this.  Although walleye abundance appears to be lower than normal for this lake, the average walleye size has increased.  Walleyes sampled in 2009 averaged 19.3 inches and 2.7 pounds. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike catches continued to be higher than normal for Elbow Lake.  Catch rates have been higher since the mid 1980's than they were prior to that time.  These fish averaged about 2.8 pounds each.  Sampled pike were generally young with good growth rates. <br> \n <br> \nTest net catches of bluegill declined but were still higher than they were in years before 1988.  Bluegills averaged 5.1 inches and only four over eight inches were caught in the sample of 222 fish.   Bluegill growth rates remained slower than normal in 2009.  It takes nearly nine years to grow a seven-inch bluegill in Elbow Lake. <br> \n <br> \nTest net catches of tullibee were higher in 2009 than during any previous assessment since 1957.  This is an indicator of Elbow Lake's relatively good water quality and reflective of recent, cool summers. <br> \n <br> \nShoreline owners are encouraged to use good land stewardship practices to protect the water quality, the fishery, and property values on Elbow Lake.  Shoreline buffer zones of native vegetation are especially helpful for reducing erosion.  Aquatic vegetation should be left intact as much as possible.  Emergent plants like bulrush and cattail are particularly valuable as fish spawning, rearing, and feeding areas, along with reducing shoreline erosion and absorbing nutrients and pollutants.  Anglers are encouraged to release medium and larger fish and keep smaller ones for eating to sustain balanced fish populations.  Northern pike under 24 inches should be harvested and larger ones should be released to control the overabundance of smaller pike and improve the overall health of the fish community.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>The northern pike gillnet catch has declined slightly, from just above the third quartile in the previous survey (Schupp's lake class #22) to just below the third quartile in the current survey.  Northern pike growth rates are good but no fish over five years old were sampled.  It's possible that the older and larger northern pike are shifting to a tullibee forage base and more pelagic existence, thus escaping our sampling gear.  A small number of tullibees were taken in gillnets as they have been in past surveys.  Bluegills taken in trapnets increased somewhat from the previous survey to a level that is currently over the third quartile for this lake class.  Bluegill growth rates are good and length frequency distribution is average (median length group 6.0-6.4 inches).  Standard lake survey gear generally does not reliably sample largemouth bass and black crappie populations, and only two largemouth bass and three black crappie were taken in test nets.  Although the sample is minimal, growth rates for both species appear to be well above average.  Young-of-the-year of both species were collected during shoreline seining.  The yellow perch gillnet catch declined from 59.87/set in 1988 to 32.38/set in the current survey but is still above the third quartile for this lake class.  Yellow perch length frequency data indicates a potential for angling, 55% are over eight inches in length with some over eleven inches.  The large yellow perch population is rather surprising in view of the abundance of predators, both northern pike and walleyes.  Walleyes, at 19.12/gillnet, are well over double the third quartile value for this lake class.  Three, four, and five-year-olds comprise the bulk of the walleye sampled, but a total of nine year classes were represented.  The largest year class, 1987, coincides with a walleye fingerling stocking year, however, both 1986 and 1988 are very large year classes produced in the absence of stocking.  It's clear that natural reproduction is contributing significantly to the population.  Only one walleye over twenty-one inches was taken in test nets, and, as with northern pike, larger walleyes may be shifting to tullibees as a forage base and escaping lake survey gear.  An alternate forage base of tullibees would help explain the large yellow perch population in the presence of such an abundance of predators.</p>",
