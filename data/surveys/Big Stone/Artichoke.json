                "narrative": "<p>Artichoke Lake is a large (1,946 acre), shallow, productive lake located in eastern Big Stone County.  Walleye and northern pike are the primary management species, but black crappie are also abundant.  Artichoke Lake has been selected for the Sentinel Lakes Project, which is aimed at evaluating which biological factors are the best indicators of disturbance due to changes such as land use and climate.  As part of this project, several types of sampling occurred on Artichoke Lake and will continue to be conducted until 2011. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye abundance appears to have declined from 2007, mostly because of the loss of fish from the 2002 and 2004 year classes.  The loss of these older and larger fish also resulted in a decrease in the average size.  In 2007, walleye averaged 16.9 inches long and 1.8 pounds.  In 2008, walleye only averaged 15 inches long and 1.3 pounds.  Walleye fry (751,000) were stocked in the spring of 2008, and fall electrofishing for young-of-year (YOY) walleye sampled 45.6 per hour of electrofishing.  This is a low catch rate for Artichoke Lake and much lower than the number of YOY sample last year (118 per hour of electrofishing).  Prior to stocking, the fry were marked with oxytetracycline (OTC).  Evaluation of the marks indicated that 100% of the 2008 year-class was the result of the stocking.  In addition to the fry stocking, 572 fingerling walleye were stocked in the fall of 2008. <br> \n  <br> \nNorthern pike abundance in Artichoke Lake continues to be low.  The average size for northern pike was also small at only 15 inches long and less than one pound.  It is likely the decreased pike abundance can be attributed to the lack of submerged vegetation, which northern pike require for spawning habitat.  In an attempt to increase abundance, 1950 adult pike were stocked in the fall and winter of 2008. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie abundance is also lower than previous years.  Average size was around 9 inches and almost half-a-pound.  Three-year-old crappie were the most common, but crappie from one to seven years old were also present.  The number of black crappie should increase, as numerous YOY black crappie were sampled in small-mesh nets in August. <br> \n   <br> \nCommon carp abundance continues to be low compared to the late 1990s and early 2000s.  Similarly, freshwater drum have also appeared to decline from their peak abundance in 2006.  It is believed freshwater drum entered Artichoke Lake in 2001, when high flows allowed drum to enter the lake from the Pomme de Terre River via Drywood Creek and Artichoke Creek.  However, despite this possible drop in the adult drum population, the 2008 year class is abundant, as small-mesh nets captured over 6,000 YOY freshwater drum per net.  Future surveys will continue to monitor the success of this year class, but it is likely predator fish will utilize this abundant prey source, possibly reducing angler catch rates. <br> \n <br> \nA small fishery for largemouth bass does seem to exist in Artichoke.  Anglers should not expect large catch rates, but anglers can expect bass to average 14 inches long and 1.6 lbs.  Bass up to 17 inches long were also present.  Other fish species sampled in low abundance were bigmouth buffalo, black bullhead, and bluegill.  Future management activities include extensive sampling for the Sentinel Lakes Project, fish stocking, and a fish population assessment.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Artichoke Lake had weak walleye year classes in 1988, 89, and 90 which resulted in few smaller walleye in the early 90's.  Although walleye fry are stocked during odd numbered years, the 1989 stocking apparently failed.  This may have been partially due to predation by an abundant black crappie population that existed at that time.  Fishing was good in the early 90's for large walleye.  Presently, a strong 1991 year class will provide numerous walleyes in the 14 to 16 inch size range.  The 1993 year class also appears to be relatively strong; these fish should be \"keeper size\" in 1995.  A recent change in walleye fry stocking from every other year to two of three years should reduce the chance of consecutive weak year classes occurring in the future. Northern pike abundance was down substantially in recent years, probably due to droughty conditions in the late 1980s and early 1990s which prevented northerns from finding suitable wetland spawning areas.  With higher lake levels in the last two seasons, production and abundance of pike is expected to increase. Black crappies were quite abundant in 1990 because of strong 1988 and 1989 year classes.  Weak year classes in 1990 and 1991, and high angler harvest of the older crappies lead to a substantial decline in crappie abundance by 1993.  A stronger 1992 year class should provide better crappie fishing in the future, but these fish were only 4 to 5 inches long during the 1993 survey.  Low numbers of bluegill and yellow perch were present.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Artichoke is a 1,964 acre lake located in eastern Big Stone County.  It is a shallow, productive lake that is managed primarily for walleye and northern pike, with secondary emphasis on black crappie and yellow perch.     Walleye abundance has declined considerably over recent years.  Net catches in 2005 were the lowest recorded for Artichoke Lake.  Poor recruitment of small walleye, angling mortality and partial winterkill have all possibly contributed to the decline in walleye abundance.  Walleye sampled in 2005 ranged from 6-20 inches.       Approximately 750,000 walleye fry were stocked into Artichoke Lake in 2005.  Prior to stocking, fry were chemically marked.  Fall electrofishing sampled moderate numbers of young-of-year walleye (YWAE).  Evaluation of YWAE for chemical marks revealed that fry stocking accounted for 100 percent of the 2005 year class.  Other available data strongly suggests that stocking has been primarily responsible for maintaining the Artichoke Lake walleye population.  Fall electrofishing had indicated potentially strong year classes present in 2002 and 2004.  However, few fish from these classes were sampled in 2005.  Little was available for small walleye to eat in these years and it appears as though few survived.  A supplemental stocking of fingerling and yearling walleye was made in the fall of 2005.  Most fingerling walleye measured 5-7 inches and most yearling 10-12 inches.  The contribution of these stockings will be evaluated with future netting assessments.     Northern pike abundance was also at record lows.  Past data indicates that northern pike in Artichoke Lake grow quickly, but have high mortality rates and few survive to age five.  High mortality is attributed to a lack of a cool water refuge during warm summer months.  Northern pike spawn in flooded vegetation and marsh areas.  Northern pike could not access these areas in recent years due to low water levels and little reproduction occurred.  Limited reproduction and high mortality of adult fish has resulted in decreased northern pike abundance.  A supplemental stocking of adult northern pike will be made in the spring of 2006.     Black crappie were abundant in 2005.  Anglers have reported good crappie fishing in recent years.  Sampled crappie measured 8-11 inches.  High numbers of young-of-year crappie were also sampled in 2005, indicating good reproduction had occurred.  Available data suggests anglers can expect good numbers of crappie to persist for the next few years.     Yellow perch were sampled in low abundance.  The low abundance of predator fish currently found in Artichoke Lake may allow for this specie to increase in abundance.  However, perch reproduction appeared to be poor in 2005.     Bluegill and largemouth bass were sampled in low abundance.  A lack of quality spawning habitat and poor water quality have limited the expansion of these species.     Scheduled fisheries management activities for Artichoke Lake in 2006 include monitoring of winter dissolved oxygen and fishing pressure, stocking adult northern pike, evaluation of the 2005 walleye stocking, and ongoing work within the watershed to improve water quality and habitat.         </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Artichoke Lake is a large (1,946 acre), shallow, productive lake located in eastern Big Stone County.  Walleye and northern pike are the primary management species, but black crappie are also abundant.  This is the first of the annual gill net assessments that will be conducted during the fall on Artichoke Lake to better understand the dynamics of the fish populations. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye were sampled in greater abundance compared to the last survey conducted in 2005.  Three year classes (2002, 2004, and 2005) were abundant, but 43% of the walleyes aged were from the 2004 year class (2 years old).  Walleye averaged 14 inches long and one pound, with the largest walleye sampled being 23.5 inches.  Walleye abundance in Artichoke Lake is primarily maintained through stocking.  Since 2001, stockings have utilized a combination of walleye fry, fingerlings, yearlings, and adults.  Artichoke Lake is scheduled to receive a fry stocking in 2007, and if needed, a fingerling or yearling stocking.  Implementing the annual population assessment using gill nets and other monitoring methods will allow the evaluation of the success of these stockings. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike abundance also increased from the 2005 survey, but is still much below the all-time high abundance in 1999.  The largest pike caught was almost 34 inches long, with the average fish being 27.5 inches and 4.8 pounds.  Pike up to 5 years old were sampled, and were primarily 3 years old and older.  It is likely the decreased abundance in pike can be attributed to the lack of precipitation in recent years resulting in limited flooded spawning habitat.  In an attempt to increase abundance, 300 lbs. of adult pike were stocked in the spring of 2006, with an additional 700 pounds being proposed for stocking in the spring of 2007. <br> \n <br> \nCompared to the 2005 survey, black crappie abundance has increased dramatically.  This is primarily due to a large number of one-year-old crappies that were 6-7 inches long.  Average size was 6.9 inches and 0.2 lb., but crappies up to 12.2 inches were sampled.  Quarter-inch trap nets indicated a weak 2006 year class compared to the 2005 survey, but the current abundance of 6-7 inch crappies should provide excellent fishing in the coming years. <br> \n <br> \nOther game fish species sampled in low abundance were bluegill, largemouth bass, and yellow perch.  Abundant non-game fish species were bigmouth buffalo and freshwater drum, whereas black bullhead and common carp appeared to have moderate to low abundance. <br> \n <br> \nFuture management activities for Artichoke Lake include monitoring winter oxygen levels and fishing pressure, stocking northern pike and walleye, and a population assessment in the fall of 2007.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Artichoke Lake is a large (1,946 acre), shallow, productive lake located in eastern Big Stone County.  Walleye and northern pike are the primary management species, but black crappie are also abundant.  This is the second year of the annual gill net assessments that will be conducted during the fall on Artichoke Lake to better assess fish management activities. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye gill net catches continue to increase from the historic low of 2.1 per set observed in 2005.  Walleye catch rate in 2006 was 15 per gill net and almost 19 walleye per gill net were sampled during this assessment.  This increase in the walleye population is likely due to increased stocking efforts.  The 2004 year-class (3 years old) was the most abundant sampled, making up 53% of the walleye aged.  Growth was slow, with age 3 walleye averaging 13.5 inches compared to the Artichoke Lake average of 16.8 inches.  Walleye averaged 17 inches and 1.7 pounds, with the largest walleye sampled being 28 inches.  Walleye abundance in Artichoke Lake is primarily maintained through stocking.  Walleye fry were stocked in the spring of 2007, and fall electrofishing for young-of-year (YOY) walleye sampled 118 per hour of electrofishing.  Prior to stocking, the walleye fry were marked using oxytetracycline (OTC).  Evaluation of the OTC marks indicated that 100% of the YOY walleye were stocked.  Artichoke Lake is scheduled to be stocked again with walleye fry in the spring of 2008. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike abundance in Artichoke Lake continues to be low.  Gill net catch of northern pike in 2007 (1.2 per net) was similar to the 2006 catch rate (1.4 per net), but is still much below the all-time high catch in 1999 of 16.9 per gill net.  The average size for northern pike was 25 inches long and 4 pounds.  The largest pike caught was almost 30 inches and growth was above average.  It is likely the decreased pike abundance can be attributed to the lack of precipitation in recent years resulting in limited spawning habitat.  In an attempt to increase abundance, 200 adult pike were stocked in the spring of 2006 and 380 adult pike were stocked in the spring of 2007.  If available, adult pike will be stocked again in the spring of 2008. <br> \n <br> \nBlack crappie gill net catch during this survey (25.4 per net) was below the 2006 catch of 82.6 per net, but was still above average for Artichoke Lake.  Although the catch rate has declined, size has increased.  Average size in 2006 was 6.9 inches and 0.2 lb whereas average size during this survey was 9 inches and 0.5 lb.  A majority of the black crappies were from the 2005 year class, but numerous crappies from the 2001 year class were also sampled.  Growth was slightly below average for Artichoke Lake.  Quarter-inch trap nets captured only 5.6 YOY black crappie per net, compared to 10.7 per net in 2006 and 217 per net in 2005. <br> \n <br> \nCommon carp abundance has appeared to decline compared to the late 1990\u0019s and early 2000\u0019s.  During those years, carp catch rates ranged from 14-33 per gill net.  In 2006 and 2007, catch rates have been less than five carp per net.  Since the winter of 1994-1995, over 1 million pounds of carp have been removed by commercial fishing.  In addition, during this survey, a summerkill involving only carp was observed.  It is possible both of these factors have contributed to the decreased abundance of carp in Artichoke Lake.   <br> \n <br> \nUnlike the common carp, freshwater drum have increased in abundance.  It is believed freshwater drum entered Artichoke Lake in 2001, when high flows allowed drum to enter the lake from the Pomme de Terre River via Drywood Creek and Artichoke Creek.  Since their appearance, drum catch rates in gill nets have been 15.4 per net in 2002, 9.5 per net in 2005, 51.8 per net in 2006, and 38.6 per net in 2007.  Although drum are abundant, a majority of the individuals were small.  Drum less than 6 inches long made up 42% of all drum measured in 2006 and 60% in 2007.  Drum have been found to be the primary forage of walleye in Artichoke Lake, and northern pike are likely utilizing them as prey as well.       <br> \n <br> \nOther game fish species sampled in low abundance were bluegill and largemouth bass.  Yellow perch have been sampled in previous years, but no individuals were captured during this assessment.  Bigmouth buffalo were also sampled in low abundance. <br> \n <br> \nArtichoke Lake has been selected for the Sentinel Lakes Project, which is aimed at evaluating which biological factors are the best indicators of disturbance due to changes in land use and climate.  As part of this project, several types of sampling on Artichoke will be conducted over the next four years.  This sampling includes spring electrofishing for largemouth bass, summer trap netting for panfish, aquatic vegetation sampling, water quality monitoring, fall gill netting, and fall electrofishing for YOY walleye.  Other future management activities for Artichoke Lake include monitoring winter oxygen levels and fishing pressure and stocking northern pike and walleye.      <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Artichoke Lake is located in western Minnesota approximately 14 miles northwest of Appleton.  It is a highly productive lake with a maximum depth of 15 feet and a surface area of 1,964 acres.  Artichoke has several shallow reefs and points that are not marked and anglers should study a contour map carefully before boating there.  An aeration system located near the \"narrows\" is usually operated during winter and it creates a substantial area of open water.  <br> \n <br> \nArtichoke Lake's fishery is managed primarily for Walleyes, with secondary emphasis on Black Crappies and Northern Pike.  This 2021 Standard Survey was conducted to collect routine fish population data using gill nets, trap nets, spring daytime electrofishing and fall nighttime electrofishing.  These data can be compared to historical Standard and Targeted Survey data from Artichoke Lake. <br> \n <br> \nThe 2021 netting shows an increase in Walleye numbers compared to previous surveys.  More than half of the Walleye in test nets were young-of-year but moderate numbers of 15 to 19-inch fish were also present.  Fry stocking has been primarily responsible for maintaining the Walleye population.  Even though high numbers of young Walleyes have been present at times, they have not always survived to adulthood.  This has likely been due to extended periods of low oxygen in the summer following decomposition of very dense algae blooms.  Low oxygen levels can result in direct fish mortality and can also severely disrupt the food web that fish rely on.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappies were present in moderate numbers from 6 to 12 inches but some longer than 13 inches can also be found.  Crappies should provide some good fishing during the next several years.  A public fishing pier located along the southeast shoreline is a popular location to catch them.       <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike were low in abundance with the largest measuring 32 inches.  They grow fast and die young in Artichoke Lake, and few pike over four years old have ever been sampled.  Natural reproduction by pike has been good at times during wet springs, but overall it has been poor due to limited spawning habitat.  Supplemental stockings of adult pike have been successful at times, but not consistently.   <br> \n <br> \nBeginning May 2018, new regulations for Northern Pike are in effect. Artichoke Lake is in the North-Central management zone meaning anglers are allowed to possess 10 pike with not more than 2 over 26 inches. All pike from 22 to 26 inches must be immediately released. Regulations differ <br> \nfor spearing. See the regulations booklet for more details <br> \n <br> \nLow numbers of Yellow Perch were present.  Recent perch stockings do not appear to have been successful at creating a fishery. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass were caught in moderate numbers and anglers have reported decent catches of them during recent years.  Bass in Artichoke Lake grow fast and can reach a quality size in only a few years. <br> \n <br> \nFreshwater Drum were moderately abundant and anglers have reported good fishing for them.  Drum are good to eat and anglers are encouraged to harvest them.  Good recipes can be located on the internet.  Their flavor can be improved by keeping the slime from contacting the fillets and trimming off the reddish meat. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>CURRENT CATCH RATES FROM ALL TYPES OF SAMPLING GEAR SHOWED INCREASES OF CARP, BULLHEAD, BLUEGILL AND BLACK CRAPPIE AND DECREASES OF YELLOW PERCH AND WALLEYE. NORTHERN PIKE CATCH RATES REMAINED RELATIVELY UNCHANGED FROM PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS. CURRENT GILLNET CATCHES ARE 2.5 TIMES STATE AND 7.0 TIMES LOCAL CATCH MEDIANS. A TOTAL OF 98 PIKE WEIGHING 411 POUNDS WERE SAMPLED IN THIS SURVEY. MAXIMUM TOTAL LENGTHS RANGED FROM 14.9 TO 36.2 IN. WITH A MEAN LENGTH AT CAPTURE OF 25.8 INCHES. MEAN WEIGHT PER FISH FROM BOTH GILL AND TRAPNETS COM- BINED WAS 4.2 POUNDS. GROWTH RATES FOR ALL YEAR CLASS WERE FAST WHEN COMPARED TO STATE WIDE AVERAGES. YEAR CLASSES FROM 1984 THROUGH 1989 WERE REPRESENTED IN THIS SAMPLING DATA. THE 1989 YEAR CLASS REPRESENTED FISH WHICH WERE NATURALLY REPRODUCED. THIS CORRESPONDS TO SHORELINE SEINING DATA FROM 1989 IN WHICH TEN YOY PIKE PER ACRE WERE SEINED. ONLY THE ORIGIN OF THE 1989 YEAR CLASS CAN BE ACCURATELY IDENTIFIED BECAUSE OF PERIODIC WINTER RESCUE STOCKING OF ADULT FISH OF VARYING AGES SINCE THE WINTER KILL OF 1978-79. BLUEGILL CATCH RATES HAVE CONTINUED IN INCREASE OVER THE PAST FOUR INVESTIGATIONS. THE TRAPNET CATCH RATE WAS 2.2 TIMES THE LOCAL MEDIAN AND NEARING THE STATE WIDE MEDIAN OF 11.7 FISH PER SET. THE GILLNET CATCH RATE WAS 3 TIMES THE STATE AND 4.5 TIMES THE LOCAL CATCH MEDIAN. A TOTAL OF 153 BLUEGILLS WEIGHING 14.2 PDS WERE SAMPLED IN GILL AND TRAPNETS, THIS WAS A 73% INCREASE FROM THE 1988 POPULATION ASSESSMENT. AGE CLASS DISTRI- BUTION WAS ALSO SIMILAR TO 1988 RESULTS WITH 95% OF THE BLUEGILLS SAMPLED REPRESENTING TWO YEAR CLASSES, AGE 1+ AND 2+. THE PRESENCE OF YOY BLUEGILL IN SEINING CATCH DATA DECREASED SIGNIFI- CANTLY FROM 5,470 PER ACRE SEINED IN 1989 TO 1,417 PER ACRE SEINED THIS YEAR. THIS DECREASE MAY AFFECT RECRUITMENT INTO FUTURE NETTING EFFORTS. GROWTH RATES OF AGE 1+ AND 2+ BLUEGILLS WERE AVERAGE. BY AGE 3+ THE GROWTH RATE HAD INCREASED 20% AND COULD BE RATED FAST WHEN COMPARED TO A STATE WIDE AVERAGE. MAXIMUM TOTAL LENGTHS OF ALL BLUEGILLS MEASURED RANGED FROM 2.7 TO 8.2 INCHES WITH A MEAN LENGTH AT CAPTURE OF 4.2 INCHES. ONLY THREE BLUEGILLS OVER 6.4 INCHES WERE SAMPLED IN THIS INVESTIGATION. THE 1988 CREEL SURVEY AND LOCAL REPORTS HAVE CONFIRMED THE PRESENCE OF ADULT BLUEGILL IN CATCHABLE NUMBERS. THESE FISH CONTINUE TO ELUDE STANDARD ASSESSMENT SAMPLING TECHNIQUES CURRENTLY BEING USED. THE BLACK CRAPPIE POPULATION HAS RAPIDLY EXPANDED SINCE THE 1986 POPULATION ASSESSEMENT. CATCH RATES IN GILLNETS HAS INCREASED FROM 4.1 FISH AND 1.5 PDS PER SET IN 1986 TO 35.3 FISH AND 11.2 PDS PER SET IN 1988. IN THE 1990 RESURVEY CATCH RATES WERE 64.5 AND 10.9 PDS PER SET. TRAPNET CATCH RATES MIRRORED THIS INCREASE. NO CRAPPIE WERE SAMPLED IN TRAPNETS IN 1986. IN 1988, 8.9 FISH PER SET WERE SAMPLED. CATCH RATE THEN INCREASED TO 28.1 FISH PER TRAPNET SET IN THE 1990 RESURVEY. CATCH PER EFFORT NUMBERS ARE CURRENTLY 15 TIMES STATE MEDIANS FOR GILLNET CATCHES AND FOUR TIMES LOCAL AND TEN TIMES STATE MEDIANS FOR TRAPNET CATCHES. FIVE YEAR CLASSES OF BLACK CRAPPIE WERE SAMPLED IN THIS SURVEY. THE 1989 THROUGH 1986 YEAR CLASSES WERE STRONGLY REPRESENTED. LIKE BLUEGILLS, THESE FISH ARE THE PRODUCT OF NATURAL REPRODUCTION. GROWTH RATES FOR ALL YEAR CLASSES WERE FAST WHEN COMPARED TO STATE WIDE AVERAGES. TOTAL LENGTHS OF ALL CRAPPIE MEASURED RANGED FROM 3.6 TO 13.2 INCHES WITH A MEAN LENGTH AT CAPTURE OF 8.6 INCHES. WHILE AVERAGE LENGTH AT CAPTURE FOR AGE 1+ TO 3 FISH HAS DECREASED SLIGHTLY FROM THE 1988 ASSESSMENT, GROWTH RATES OF INDIVIDUAL YEAR CLASSES HAVE NOT SIGNIFICANTLY DECLINED. THE NUMBER OF YOY BLACK CRAPPIE SAMPLED BY SEINING DECREASED, DROPPING FROM 225 FISH PER ACRE SEINED IN 1989 TO 13 PER ACRE IN THIS YEARS RESURVEY. ONE 15.1 INCH, 2.0 PD LARGEMOUTH BASS FROM THE 1987 YEAR CLASS WAS SAMPLED BY TRAPNET DURING THIS INVESTIGATION. THIS FISH MAY HAVE BEEN A PRODUCT OF REPRODUCTION FROM A 1984 STOCKING OF 36,014 FINGERLING AND 512 YEARLING LARGEMOUTH BASS. GROWTH RATE FOR THIS FISH WAS FAST, 20% GREATER THAN THE STATE WIDE AVERAGE. AN ADDITIONAL SIX YOY BASS WERE SAMPLED BY SHORELINE SEINING. THEY RANGED IN LENGTH FROM 1.7 TO 3.5 INCHES. THE CURRENT SEINING CATCH PER EFFORT RATE OF 25 FISH PER ACRE IS 2.5 TIMES GREATER THAN THE CATCH RATE IN 1989. WHILE NATURAL REPRODUCTION OF LARGEMOUTH HAS BEEN DOCUMENTED IN 1987, 1988 AND 1989, ONLY ONE ADULT FISH HAS BEEN SAMPLED IN THE FOUR INVESTIGATIONS SINCE 1983. THE TOTAL NUMBER OF YELLOW PERCH SAMPLED IN THIS INVESTIGATION DECREASED BY 76% FROM THE 1988 POPULATION ASSESSMENT AND 93% FROM THE 1986 ASSESSMENT NETTING. CURRENT CATCH RATES OF 3.3 FISH AND 2.6 PDS PER GILLNET SET AND 0.4 FISH AND 0.4 PDS PER TRAPNET SET FALL WELL BELOW BOTH STATE AND LOCAL CATCH MEDIANS. MAXIMUM TOTAL LENGTHS RANGED FROM 5.8 TO 13.7 INCHES, WITH A MEAN LENGTH AT CAPTURE OF 11.1 INCHES. THIS WAS A SUBSTANTIAL INCREASE FROM 1988 WHEN MEAN LENGTH AT CAPTURE WAS 9.7 INCHES. MEAN WEIGHT OF PERCH CAPTURED IN GILL AND TRAPNETS COMBINED WAS 0.8 PDS CURRENT FAST GROWTH RATES OF YELLOW PERCH ARE COMPARABLE TO THOSE OF PERCH SAMPLED IN THE 1988 POPULATION ASSESSMENT. FIVE YEAR CLASSES, 1985 (AGE 5+) THROUGH 1989 (AGE 1+) WERE REPRESENTED IN THE 1990 NETTING RESULTS. THE 1986 (AGE 4+) AND 1987 (AGE 3+) YEAR CLASSES WERE THE MOST STRONGLY REPRESENTED. NO YOY YELLOW PERCH HAVE BEEN SAMPLED BY SHORELINE SEINING IN ARTICHOKE LAKE SINCE 1986. CATCH PER EFFORT NUMBERS OF WALLEYE HAVE DECREASED FROM 21.8 FISH AND 42.4 PDS PER GILLNET SET IN THE 1988 ASSESSMENT TO 13.1 FISH AND 53.9 PDS PER SET DURING THE 1990 RESURVEY. THIS IS A 40 % DECREASE IN TOTAL FISH SAMPLED BUT A 22% INCREASE IN TOTAL PDS. WHILE TRAPNET NUMBER PER SET HAS NOT CHANGED SINCE 1988, PDS PER SET INCREASED BY 59%, FROM 5.4 PDS PER SET. WHEN COMPARED WITH STATE AND LOCAL MEDIANS, WALLEYE CATCH RATES ARE 3.6 TIMES STATE AND 4.7 TIMES LOCAL GILLNET MEDIANS AND 5 TIMES STATE AND LOCAL TRAPNET MEDIANS. ALL YEAR CLASSES FROM 1980 (AGE 10+) THROUGH 1989 (AGE 1+) WERE REPRESENTED IN CURRENT CATCH DATA. THE THREE YEAR WITH THE STRONGEST REPRESENTATION, 1987, 1984 AND 1983 CORRESPOND TO YEARS OF FRY STOCKING. THE NUMBERS OF AGE 1+ WALLEYE IN THE 1990 RESURVEY GILLNETTING DECREASED BY 92% FROM THE 1988 ASSESSMENT NETTING. THIS YEAR CLASS REPRESENTED NATURALLY REPRODUCED AND/OR FRY STOCKED FISH. MORTALITY OF WALLEYE FRY BEING TRANSPORTED FOR STOCKING IN 1989 WAS HIGH. LOSSES AS HIGH AS 50% WERE OBSERVED AT SEVERAL LAKES AND REARING PONDS AS FRY WERE RELEASED FROM OXYGENATED BAGS. PREDATION OF WALLEYE FRY BY THE LARGE BLACK CRAPPIE POPULATION IS PROBABLE. EXTREMELY LOW LAKE LEVELS ON ARTI- CHOKE LAKE MAY ALSO BE IMPACTING NATURAL REPRO- DUCTION. ANY OF THESE FACTORS MAY BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE WEAK REPRESENTATION OF THE 1989 YEAR CLASS. GROWTH RATE OF ALL YEAR CLASSES WERE FAST WHEN COMPARED TO STATE WIDE AVERAGES. MAXIMUM TOTAL LENGTHS OF MEASURED FISH RANGED FROM 11.1 TO 29.0 INCHES WITH A MEAN LENGTH AT CAPTURE OF 21.5 INCHES. MEAN INDIVIDUAL WEIGHT OF FISH FROM GILL AND TRAPNETS COMBINED WAS 4.3 PDS. THIS IS A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN MEAN LENGTH AND WEIGHT OF WALLEYE WHICH WERE 16.0 INCHES AND 2.0 PDS IN THE 1988 POPULATION ASSESSEMENT. YOUNG OF THE YEAR  WALLEYE HAD BEEN SAMPLED CONSISTENTLY BY SEINING FROM 1983 THROUGH 1987 BUT HAVE NOT BEEN PRESENT IN SEINING CATCHES SINCE THEN. CARP AND BLACK BULLHEAD NUMBERS HAVE INCREASED SIGNIFI- CANTLY SINCE THE 1988 POPULATION ASSESSMENT. CARP CATCH RATES INCREASED FROM 1.7 FISH AND 3.9 PDS PER GILLNET SET IN 1988 TO 11.1 FISH AND 28.0 PDS IN THE 1990 RESURVEY NETTING. BLACK BULLHEADS INCREASED IN THE GILLNET CATCH FROM 83.4 FISH AND 25.6 PDS PER SET IN 1988 TO THE CURRENT CATCH RATES OF 116.2 FISH AND 32.4 PDS PER SET. COMMERCIAL SEINING OPERATIONS WERE RESUMED ON ARTICHOKE LAKE DURING THE 1990-1991 WINTER SEASON. NO SEINING HAD BEEN DONE SINCE THE 1970'S. TO DATE, 129,400 PDS OF CARP HAVE BEEN REMOVED FROM ARTICHOKE LAKE. COMMERCIAL HOOP NETTING HAS REMOVED AN ADDITIONAL 1,150 PDS OF CARP AND 775 PDS OF BULLHEADS.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Artichoke Lake is located in western Minnesota approximately 14 miles northwest of Appleton.  It is a highly productive lake with a maximum depth of 15 feet and a surface area of 1,946 acres.  Anglers should study Artichoke's contour map carefully before boating as several shallow, unmarked reef areas exist that are navigation hazards.  Anglers are cautioned that an aeration system located near the \"narrows\" is usually operated during winter and it creates a substantial area of open water.  Artichoke Lake's fishery is managed primarily for Walleye, with secondary emphasis on Black Crappie, Yellow Perch and Northern Pike.   <br> \n <br> \nIn the 2016 survey, Walleyes were abundant for Artichoke's standards.  Most were 17-19 inches.  Walleyes have typically experienced poor natural reproduction and the population has been maintained primarily through stocking.  Walleyes are stocked as appropriate depending on the abundance and condition of existing young Walleyes, and the abundance of suitable forage.  Adults, yearlings, and fry were stocked in 2016.   <br> \n <br> \nGood numbers of Black Crappies were present in 2016.  The strong 2014 and 2015 year classes were abundant and measured 5-7 inches.  These fish are expected to provide some good crappie fishing during the next few years.  Crappies were also present from the 2010-2012 year classes, and some of them were longer than 13 inches.  Anglers reported sporadic success for crappies during 2016, with the best fishing coming from the southern portion of the lake.  A DNR fishing pier located along the southeast shore is a popular location to catch crappies.       <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike numbers were low in 2016.  Pike had experienced good natural reproduction and high population abundance at times during the mid to late 1990s, but lower numbers have been the norm since 2002.  Northern Pike grow fast and die young in Artichoke Lake, and few pike over four years old have ever been sampled.  Adult pike from winter rescue lakes are commonly stocked to supplement the population.  In the absence of natural reproduction or supplemental stocking, the population can decline rapidly as has been the case in recent years.  Adult pike were stocked during December of 2016.  <br> \n <br> \nAlmost 80,000 yearling and adult perch have been stocked since 2014.  The 2015 gill net catch rate was the highest it had been since 1988.  The catch dropped by 50% in the 2016 survey but was still considered above average for Artichoke Lake.  Anglers have reported seeing and catching more perch in recent years.     <br> \n <br> \nBluegill and Largemouth Bass were caught in low numbers during the 2016 assessment, however anglers have decent localized catches of them at times. <br> \n <br> \nFreshwater Drum were abundant and anglers have reported good catches of them.  Anglers are encouraged to harvest and eat drum.  Good recipes can be located on the internet by searching \"drum recipes.\"  When cleaning drum be careful to not get slime on the fillets and trim the red meat from them to improve their flavor. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Artichoke Lake is located in western Minnesota approximately 14 miles northwest of Appleton.  It is a highly productive lake with a maximum depth of 15 feet and a surface area of 1,946 acres.  Anglers should study Artichoke's contour map carefully before boating as several shallow, unmarked reef areas exist that are navigation hazards.  An aeration system located near the \"narrows\" is usually operated during winter and it creates a substantial area of open water.  Artichoke Lake's fishery is managed primarily for Walleye, with secondary emphasis on Black Crappie, Yellow Perch and Northern Pike.  This targeted survey was conducted to collect routine fish population data using gill nets, quarter-inch trap nets and fall night electrofishing.  These data can be compared to historical standard and targeted survey data from Artichoke Lake. <br> \n <br> \nWalleyes were abundant in 2017 from a wide range of sizes and ages.  The catch was dominated by Walleyes from 2013 and they were 18-22 inches.  Walleyes have typically experienced poor natural reproduction and the population is maintained primarily through stocking.  They are stocked depending on the abundance and condition of existing young Walleyes, and the abundance of suitable forage.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie numbers were lower than the previous survey in 2016, but good reproduction and some strong recent year classes should provide better crappie fishing over the next several years.  Anglers reported sporadic success for crappies during 2017, with the best fishing coming from the southern portion of the lake.  A DNR fishing pier located along the southeast shore is a popular location to catch crappies.       <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike numbers were moderate in 2017.  Sizes ranged from 20-34 inches, averaging 24 inches. Pike had experienced good natural reproduction and high population abundance at times during the mid to late 1990s, but lower numbers have been the norm since 2002.  Northern Pike grow fast and die young in Artichoke Lake, and few pike over four years old have ever been sampled.  Adult pike are periodically stocked to supplement the population.  In the absence of natural reproduction or supplemental stocking, the population can decline rapidly as has been the case in recent years.  Adult pike were last stocked during December of 2017.  <br> \n <br> \nAlmost 80,000 yearling and adult Yellow Perch have been stocked since 2014.  Although these stockings appear to have increased the population, gill net catches have remained relatively low.  In 2017, Yellow Perch ranged from 7 to 10 inches, averaging 8 inches.  Anglers have reported seeing and catching more perch in recent years, however angling for them has generally be slow. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill and Largemouth Bass were caught in low numbers during the 2017 survey, however anglers have had decent localized catches of them at times. <br> \n <br> \nFreshwater Drum were abundant and anglers have reported good catches of them.  Anglers are encouraged to harvest and eat drum.  Good recipes can be located on the internet by searching \"drum recipes.\"  When cleaning drum be careful to not get slime on the fillets and trim the red meat from them to improve their flavor. <br> \n</p>",

It is a highly productive lake with a maximum depth of 15 feet and a surface area of 1,964 acres.  Artichoke has several shallow reefs and points that are not marked so anglers should study a contour map carefully before boating.  An aeration system located near the \"narrows\" is usually operated during winter and it creates a substantial area of open water.  <br> \n <br> \nArtichoke Lake's fishery is managed primarily for walleyes, with secondary emphasis on black crappies, northern pike, largemouth bass and yellow perch.  Artichoke experienced a severe winterkill during the 2022-2023 winter.  Walleye fry, spottail shiners and adult black crappies were stocked in spring 2023.  Stocking of other species will occur when available.  This annual fall survey was conducted to collect current fish population data using gill nets, trap nets and nighttime electrofishing.   <br> \n <br> \nYoung-of-year bigmouth buffalo, black bullheads, common carp and walleyes were present in high numbers.  The young-of-year walleyes had a mean length of 5.6 inches.  With good growth, they may be 13 inches by late fall 2024.  Although the fishery is going to take time to rebound, the large number of walleyes from the 2023 year class should provide some good fishing in a year or two.       <br> \n</p>",

BOTH CATCH RATES WERE DISTRIBUTED WITHIN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF THE REGION 4 CATCH DISTRIBUTION. THERE WAS NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN CATCH RATES FOR BOTH NUMBERS AND PDS COMPARED TO THE 1983 POPULATION ASSESSMENT. THE MENA INDIVIDUAL WEIGHT OF WALLEYE SAMPLED WAS 1.56 PDS. THE CATCH WAS DOMINATED IN NUMBERS BY THE 1984 YEAR CLASSES, WITH MEAN LENGTHS AT CAPTURE OF 11.3 AND 14.5 INCHES, RESPECTIVELY. THESE YEAR CLASSES CORRESPOND TO YEARS OF FRY STOCKING. 20% OF THE CATCH IN NUMBERS WERE FISH OF AGE 6+ AND OLDER. NATURAL REPRODUCTION OF WALLEYE WAS DOCUMENTED IN 1986 AND 1985 BY SHORELINE SEINING. YELLOW PERCH DENSITY APPEARS EXCELLENT. CATCH RATE IN GILL NETS WAS 50.20 PER LIFT, A SIGNIFI- CANT INCREASE COMPARED TO THE 1983 CATCH RATE OF 3.20 PER LIFT. CATCH RATE BY WEIGHT WAS 20.37 LBS. PER LIFT, A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE FROM THE 1983 RATE OF 1.27 LBS. PER LIFT. MEAN INDIVIDUAL WEIGHT OF FISH SAMPLED WAS 0.40 PD. CATCH RATES FOR BOTH NUMBERS AND PDS WERE DISTRIBUTED WITHIN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF THE REGION 4 CATCH DISTRI- BUTION. NORTHERN PIKE CATCH WAS 5.00 PER LIFT. THERE WAS NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE FROM THE 1983 CATCH RATE OF 8.80 PER LIFT. CATCH RATES BY WEIGHT WERE NOT SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT BETWEEN 1986 AND 1983. CATCH RATES FOR NORTHERN PIKE, BY NUMBERS AND WEIGHT, WERE BOTH WITHIN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF THE REGION 4 CATCH DISTRIBUTION. MEAN INDIVIDUAL WEIGHT OF FISH SAMPLED WAS 2.5 PDS. YOUNG OF THE YEAR NORTHERN PIKE WERE SAMPLED BY SHORELINE SEINING IN BOTH 1986 AND 1985. BLUEGILL CATCH IN TRAPNETS WAS 1.4 PER LIFT. THERE WAS NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE WHEN COMPARED TO THE CATCH RATE IN 1983 OF 0.80 PER LIFT. CATCH RATE BY WEIGHT INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY FROM 0.16 PER LIFT IN 1983 TO 2.10 LBS. PER LIFT IN 1983. THIS APPEARS TO HAVE OCCURED DUE TO THE INCREASE IN MEAN INDIVIDUAL WEIGHT OF FISH SAMPLED, FROM 0.17 PD IN 1983 TO 0.61 PD IN 1986. CATCH RATES IN TRAPNETS BY NUMBERS AND PDS WERE DISTRIBUTED WITH- IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF THE REGION 4 CATCH DIS- TRIBUTION. BLACK CRAPPIE CATCH IN TRAPNETS WAS 4.1 PER LIFT, WITHIN THE SECOND QUARTER OF THE REGION 4 DISTRI- BUTION. MEAN INDIVIDUAL WEIGHT OF FISH SAMPLED WAS 0.35 PD. BLACK CRAPPIE WERE SAMPLED IN LOW NUMBERS IN GILL NETS IN 1983, SO NO CATCH COMPARISON COULD BE MADE. 37% OF BLACK SAMPLED WERE FROM THE 1983 YEAR CLASS WITH A MEAN LENGTH AT CAPTURE OF 6.7 INCHES. 49% OF THE BLACK CRAPPIE SAMPLED WERE BETWEEN 8.5 AND 11.9 INCHES IN LENGTH. CARP CATCH IN TRAPNETS WAS 2.00 PER LIFT, A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE FROM 0.70 PER LIFT IN 1983. CATCH BY WEIGHT INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY FROM 3.15 LBS. PER LIFT IN 1983 TO 9.43 LBS. IN 1986. THE MEAN INDIVIDUAL WEIGHT OF FISH SAMPLED WAS 4.75 POUNDS IN 1986 AND 2.59 PDS IN 1983. CATCH IN BOTH PDS AND NUMBERS WERE WITHIN THE SECOND QUAR- TER OF THE REGION 4 CATCH DISTRIBUTION. GROWTH RATES, EXPRESSED AS AVERAGE ANNUAL INCRE- MENTS, WERE COMPARED WITH THE STATEWIDE AVERAGE FOR FIVE SPECIES. GROWTH RATES WERE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER THAN THE STATE AVERAGES FOR WALLEYE, YELLOW PERCH, AND NORTHERN PIKE. GROWTH FOR BLACK CRAPPIE WAS NOT SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT FROM THE STATE AVERAGE.

                "narrative": "<p>Artichoke is a 1,964 acre lake located in eastern Big Stone County.  The lake is managed for walleye and northern pike with secondary emphasis on black crappie and yellow perch.     Approximately 1.5 million fry were stocked into Artichoke in 2002.  Prior to stocking, fry were marked using oxytetracycline (OTC).  Fall electrofishing, conducted to evaluate young-of-year walleye (YWAE) abundance, indicated numerous YWAE were present.  Evaluation of YWAE for OTC marks revealed that fry stocking accounted for 100 percent of the 2002 year class.  Other available data strongly suggests that stocking, including fingerling and yearling stocking, has been primarily responsible for the Artichoke Lake walleye population.          Walleye were moderately abundant in 2002.  Although walleye up to 25 inches were caught, most measured 12-18 inches.  A good number of 6-8 inch walleye were also sampled.  Although these fish were growing slowly, many should measure 12-14 inches by the winter of 2004.     Northern pike were also moderately abundant and measured from 14-32 inches.  Their numbers are down considerably from a 1999 assessment.  Poor spawning success in recent years and angling mortality likely explain the decrease in pike abundance.  A project to restore two drained wetlands within the Artichoke Lake watershed should be completed in 2003.  The wetlands may serve as northern pike rearing areas and could enhance northern pike reproduction.     Black crappie were abundant.  Most were nice sized, measuring 9-12 inches.  A good number of 4-6 inch crappie were also sampled.  Anglers should find a quality black crappie population on Artichoke Lake for the next few years.     Few yellow perch were sampled.  Most were small and would not draw much angling interest.  Their numbers have been consistantly low over the past 14 years.     Large-mouth bass were moderately abundant and most measured 12-16 inches.  Anglers pursuing largemouth may want to concentrate around bulrush and cattail areas.  Due to the limited largemouth habitat available on Artichoke Lake, anglers are encouraged to practice catch-and-release.     Black bullhead and carp were abundant.  Most black bullhead were small, measuring less than 7 inches.  However, a sizeable number of 9-12 inch bullhead were also sampled.       Brown bullhead, freshwater drum and shorthead redhorse were all sampled for the first time on Artichoke Lake.  These species migrated in from the Pomme de Terre River, via Drywood Creek, during spring floods in 2001.       Management plans for Artichoke Lake include stocking walleye fry every two of three years, annual fall electrofishing, annual monitoring of winter dissolved oxygen and angling pressure, work within watershed to improve water quality and fisheries habitat, and a fisheries population assessment in 2005.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>     Artichoke Lake is located in western Minnesota approximately 15 miles northeast of Ortonville.  It is a highly productive lake that measures 1,946 acres and has a maximum depth of 15 feet.  Anglers should study the lake's contour map carefully before boating as several shallow, unmarked reef areas exist that are navigation hazards. <br> \n    Artichoke provides a high quality fishery for walleye, black crappie, freshwater drum, and on occasion northern pike.  Walleye measuring 12-20 inches were abundant in 2010, but angling was spotty due to abundant forage.  The walleye population has resulted almost entirely from fry and fingerling stocking.  Walleye are stocked as needed based on their abundance, condition, and available forage. <br> \n     High numbers of black crappie were present in 2010 with fish measuring up to 14 inches.  Crappie frequently experience good natural reproduction in Artichoke Lake. <br> \n     Northern pike abundance increased substantially in 2010 following recent stockings of winter-rescued adults.  Pike experience poor natural reproduction in Artichoke Lake due to limited suitable spawning habitat. <br> \n     Freshwater drum have been abundant in recent years and anglers often report good catches of them.  Night crawlers and leeches have been good bait choices.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>     Artichoke Lake is located in western Minnesota approximately 14 miles northwest of Appleton.  It is a highly productive lake with a maximum depth of 15 feet and a surface area of 1,946 acres.  Anglers should study Artichoke's contour map carefully before boating as several shallow, unmarked reef areas exist that are navigation hazards.  Anglers are cautioned that an aeration system located near the \"narrows\" is usually operated during winter and it creates a substantial area of open water. <br> \n    Artichoke provides a high quality fishery for walleye, black crappie, freshwater drum, and occasionally northern pike.  Walleye were moderately abundant during 2012 with most fish 8-12 or 16-25 inches.  Angling was somewhat slow due to abundant forage.  Walleye have typically experienced poor natural reproduction and the population has been maintained primarily through stocking.  Supplemental walleye are stocked as appropriate depending on the abundance and condition of existing walleye, and the abundance of suitable forage. <br> \n     Moderate numbers of black crappie were present in 2012 with most of them 8-10 inches.  Crappie frequently experience good natural reproduction and strong year classes occurred in 2009 and 2010. <br> \n     During recent years northern pike have experienced poor natural reproduction.  Their population has been supplemented by stocking adults netted from winterkill lakes.  These stockings have helped maintain a moderate population of pike.  They were primarily 20 inches and larger.  Northern pike typically grow fast and die young and no fish older than age four were caught. <br> \n     Freshwater drum have been abundant in recent years and anglers often report good catches of them.  Night crawlers and leeches have been good bait choices.  Drum have a delicate white flesh and provide excellent table fair.  Their flavor can be improved further by trimming the reddish \"mud line\" meat from the fillets when cleaning.  Anglers are encouraged to harvest and consume them.  Excellent drum recipes can be located on the internet by searching \"drum recipes.\"</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Artichoke Lake is located in western Minnesota approximately 14 miles northwest of Appleton.  It is a highly productive lake with a maximum depth of 15 feet and a surface area of 1,946 acres.  Anglers should study Artichoke's contour map carefully before boating as several shallow, unmarked reef areas exist that are navigation hazards.  An aeration system located near the \"narrows\" is usually operated during winter and it creates a substantial area of open water.  Artichoke Lake's fishery is managed primarily for Walleye, with secondary emphasis on Black Crappie, Yellow Perch and Northern Pike.  This targeted survey was conducted to collect routine fish population data using gill nets, quarter-inch trap nets and fall night electrofishing.  These data can be compared to historical standard and targeted survey data from Artichoke Lake. <br> \n <br> \nArtichoke Lake has a long history of providing good fishing for Walleyes, most recently in 2017.  However, the catch of larger Walleyes was very low in 2018, even though decent numbers of the 2016 and 2017 year class had been produced.  A moderate number of young-of-year Walleyes were present in 2018 and they are expected to increase the number of larger fish by 2020.  Walleye fry will be stocked during the spring of 2019 to further supplement the population.  Walleye fry are routinely stocked and they have been primarily responsible for maintaining the population. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie numbers were moderate in the 2018 survey, and crappie up to 13 inches were present.  Good reproduction and some strong recent year classes should provide better crappie fishing over the next several years.  Anglers reported sporadic success for crappies during 2018, with the best fishing coming from the southern portion of the lake.  A DNR fishing pier located along the southeast shore is a popular location to catch crappies.       <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike numbers were low in 2018.  Sizes ranged from 20-23 inches. Pike had experienced good natural reproduction and high population abundance at times during the mid to late 1990s, but lower numbers have been the norm since 2002.  Northern Pike grow fast and die young in Artichoke Lake, and few pike over four years old have ever been sampled.  Adult pike are periodically stocked to supplement the population.  In the absence of natural reproduction or supplemental stocking, the population can decline rapidly as has been the case in recent years.  Adult pike were stocked during December of 2018.  Beginning May 2018, new regulations for Northern Pike are in effect.  Artichoke Lake is in the North-Central management zone meaning anglers are allowed to possess 10 pike with not more than 2 over 26 inches.  All pike from 22 to 26 inches must be immediately released.  Regulations differ for spearing.  See the regulations booklet for more details.   <br> \n <br> \nAlmost 80,000 yearling and adult Yellow Perch have been stocked since 2014.  Although these stockings appear to have increased the population, gill net catches have remained relatively low.  In 2018, few Yellow Perch were observed.  Anglers have reported seeing and catching more perch in recent years, however angling for them has generally be slow. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass were caught in moderate numbers and anglers have reported decent catches of them during recent years. <br> \n <br> \nFreshwater Drum were abundant and anglers have reported good catches of them.  Anglers are encouraged to harvest and eat drum.  Good recipes can be located on the internet by searching \"drum recipes.\"  When cleaning drum be careful to not get slime on the fillets and trim the red meat from them to improve their flavor. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Artichoke is a large, productive lake located on the border of Big Stone and Swift Counties.  The fishery is primarily managed for walleye and northern pike, with secondary emphasis on black crappie, bluegill, largemouth bass and yellow perch.       Walleye were abundant in 1999.  Many of the fish were large, with 40% of the catch greater than 20 inches.  Individuals up to 29 inches and 10 pounds were also caught.  Growth was fast.  Age 5 walleye had a mean length of 22.1 inches, compared to the southern Minnesota mean of 18.8 inches.  Recent high forage abundance likely reduced walleye catchability in recent years, however, low forage abundance was indicated in 1999 and should now make walleye more susceptible to anglers.  Approximately one million walleye fry are stocked in two of three years, including 1999.  Fall electrofishing conducted to assess the abundance of young-of-year walleye indicated a strong 1999 year class was present.  Available data strongly suggests that fry stocking is primarily responsible for maintaining the walleye population.     Northern pike abundance was the highest recorded for this lake.  Recent high water levels have increased available spawning habitat for northern pike and likely explain their elevated abundance.  The pike had a mean length of 23.7 inches and displayed fast growth.  The largest individual captured in the survey was 37 inches long and weighed approximately 13 pounds.       Black crappie abundance was also the highest recorded for this lake.  High water may have also benefited their reproductive success.  Although individuals up to 14.4 inches were caught, the vast majority ranged from 4-6 inches.  Growth was average for their first two years and was fast after that.  Predation may reduce the number of small crappie in Artichoke, but enough may survive to provide a quality fishery in the next few years.     Largemouth bass, bluegill and yellow perch were present in low abundance, although anglers reported moderate success for both largemouth and bluegill in 1999.       Other species present in low to moderate abundance include bigmouth buffalo, black bullhead, carp, fathead minnow and orangespotted sunfish.     The Artichoke Lake fishery appears to be in good shape.  Abundant walleye and northern populations coupled with low forage abundance should create a positive situation for anglers.  Black crappie are also abundant, although the majority are small.  Management plans include annual monitoring of winter dissolved oxygen, stocking one million fry in two of three years, stabilizing areas of eroded shoreline and population assessments every three years to evaluate management practices.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Artichoke Lake is located in western Minnesota approximately 14 miles northwest of Appleton.  It is a highly productive lake with a maximum depth of 15 feet and a surface area of 1,946 acres.  Anglers should study Artichoke's contour map carefully before boating as several shallow, unmarked reef areas exist that are navigation hazards.  Anglers are cautioned that an aeration system located near the \"narrows\" is usually operated during winter and it creates a substantial area of open water.  The Artichoke Lake fishery is managed primarily for walleye and northern pike, with secondary emphasis on black crappie, bluegill, largemouth bass, and yellow perch.   <br> \n <br> \nWalleye were moderately abundant during 2013.   Walleye measured up to 24 inches long, but most ranged from 13-15 inches.  Angling has been somewhat slow due to abundant forage.  Walleye have typically experienced poor natural reproduction and the population has been maintained primarily through stocking.  Supplemental walleye are stocked as appropriate depending on the abundance and condition of existing walleye, and the abundance of suitable forage. <br> \n <br> \nDuring recent years northern pike have experienced poor natural reproduction.  Their population has been supplemented by stocking adults netted from winterkill lakes.  These stockings have helped maintain a low to moderate population of pike.  Fewer pike were sampled in 2013 than in 2012.  Pike measured up to 35 inches long. <br> \n <br> \nGood numbers of black crappie were present in 2013 with most measuring 5-6 inches and 9-11 inches.  Anglers reported phenomenal crappie fishing during late summer and fall of 2013.  The best fishing was reported from the southern part of the lake. The DNR fishing pier located on the southeast shore was a popular location to catch crappie.  Crappie frequently experience good natural reproduction and strong year classes occurred in 2009 and 2010.  Another potentially strong year class was evident in 2013 with over 2,100 young-of-year black crappie caught per trap net.  Considering available information, the black crappie population should remain good for the next several years.       <br> \n <br> \nFreshwater drum have been abundant in recent years and anglers often report good catches of them.  Anglers are encouraged to harvest and consume them.  Excellent drum recipes can be located on the internet by searching \"drum recipes.\" <br> \n <br> \nBluegill, largemouth bass, and yellow perch were also caught in low abundance in the 2013 assessment.  Bluegill and largemouth bass populations may be underrepresented in the 2013 catch as anglers have had decent fishing for both at times.  Largemouth bass over five pounds have been reported.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Artichoke Lake is located in western Minnesota approximately 14 miles northwest of Appleton.  It is a highly productive lake with a maximum depth of 15 feet and a surface area of 1,946 acres.  Anglers should study Artichoke's contour map carefully before boating as several shallow, unmarked reef areas exist that are navigation hazards.  Anglers are cautioned that an aeration system located near the \"narrows\" is usually operated during winter and it creates a substantial area of open water.  Artichoke Lake's fishery is managed primarily for Walleye, with secondary emphasis on Black Crappie, Yellow Perch and Northern Pike.   <br> \n <br> \nIn 2015, Walleye were relatively low in abundance for Artichoke's standards.  Most were 14-16 inches.  Walleye angling during 2015 was slow due to abundant forage.  Walleye have typically experienced poor natural reproduction and the population has been maintained primarily through stocking.  Supplemental Walleye are stocked as appropriate depending on the abundance and condition of existing Walleye, and the abundance of suitable forage.  Adults, yearlings, and fry were stocked into Artichoke Lake in 2015.   <br> \n <br> \nGood numbers of Black Crappie were present in 2015.  The majority were from a strong 2014 year class that measured 5-7 inches.  Few crappie larger than 7 inches were caught.  Good reproduction in 2013 and 2014 should produce some quality fishing in the next few years.   Anglers reported sporadic success for crappie during 2015, with the best fishing coming from the southern portion of the lake.  A DNR fishing pier located along the southeast shore is a popular location to catch crappie.       <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike numbers were low in 2015.  Pike had experienced good natural reproduction and high population abundance at times during the mid to late 1990s, but lower numbers have been the norm since 2002.  Northern Pike grow fast and die young in Artichoke Lake and few pike older than 4 years have ever been sampled.  Adult pike from winter rescue lakes were stocked from 2006-2011 to supplement the population.  In the absence of natural reproduction or supplemental stocking, the population can decline rapidly as has been the case in recent years.   <br> \n <br> \nThe Yellow Perch catch was higher than it had been in recent years.  The 2013 stocking has produced moderate numbers of 7 to 10 inch perch.  <br> \n <br> \nBluegill and Largemouth Bass were caught in low numbers during the 2015 assessment though they may have been underrepresented in the survey considering anglers have reported decent fishing for them at times. <br> \n <br> \nFreshwater Drum have been abundant in recent years and anglers often report good catches of them.  Anglers are encouraged to harvest and consume them.  Excellent drum recipes can be located on the internet by searching \"drum recipes.\"  When cleaning drum do not get the slime on the fillets and carefully trim the red meat from the fillets to improve flavor. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Artichoke Lake is in western Minnesota approximately 14 miles northwest of Appleton.  It is a highly productive lake with a maximum depth of 15 feet and a surface area of 1,964 acres.  Artichoke has several shallow reefs and points that are not marked so anglers should study a contour map carefully before boating.  An aeration system located near the \"narrows\" is usually operated during winter and it creates a substantial area of open water.  <br> \n <br> \nArtichoke Lake's fishery is managed primarily for Walleyes, with secondary emphasis on Black Crappies, Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass and Yellow Perch.  This 2022 Standard Survey was conducted to collect routine fish population data using gill nets, trap nets and fall nighttime electrofishing.  These data can be compared to historical Standard and Targeted Survey data from Artichoke Lake. <br> \n <br> \nWalleyes were abundant in 2022 from a wide range of sizes, especially from 12-14 and 18-26 inches.  Young-of-year Walleyes were also abundant.  Fry stocking has largely maintained the Walleye population.  Even though high numbers of young Walleyes have been present at times, they have not always survived to adulthood.  This has likely been due to extended periods of low oxygen in the summer following decomposition of very dense algae blooms.  Low oxygen levels can result in direct fish mortality and can also severely disrupt the food web that fish rely on.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappies were present in moderate numbers from 6-13 inches.  Numerous young-of-year crappies were also present.  With good survival, some good crappie fishing should occur during the next several years.  A public fishing pier located along the southeast shoreline can be a good location to catch crappies.       <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike numbers were low, and the largest pike caught was 26 inches.  Pike grow fast and die young in Artichoke Lake, and few pike over four years old have ever been sampled.  Natural reproduction has been good at times during wet springs, but overall, it has been poor due to limited spawning habitat.  Supplemental stockings of adult pike have been successful at times, but not consistently.  Artichoke Lake is in the North-Central Northern Pike Management Zone.  The possession and size limits in this zone are 10 fish with no more than 2 over 26 inches.  All from 22 to 26 inches must be released.       <br> \n <br> \nLow numbers of Yellow Perch were found, despite several recent perch stockings. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass were sampled in low numbers.  However, anglers have reported good fishing for them during recent years.  Bass in Artichoke Lake grow fast and can reach a quality size in only a few years. <br> \n <br> \nFreshwater Drum were moderately abundant, and anglers have reported good fishing for them.  Drum are good to eat, and anglers are encouraged to harvest them.  Good recipes can be located on the internet.  Their flavor can be improved by keeping the slime from contacting the fillets and trimming off the reddish meat. <br> \n <br> \nThis report was written in March of 2023.  Oxygen levels had been very low in Artichoke Lake since January 2023, and some level of winterkill is expected.  Fish sampling will be conducted following ice-out and the results will be available shortly after that evaluation. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Artichoke Lake is located in western Minnesota approximately 14 miles northwest of Appleton.  It is a highly productive lake with a maximum depth of 15 feet and a surface area of 1,946 acres.  Anglers should study Artichoke's contour map carefully before boating as several shallow, unmarked reef areas exist that are navigation hazards.  Anglers are cautioned that an aeration system located near the \"narrows\" is usually operated during winter and it creates a substantial area of open water.  Artichoke Lake's fishery is managed primarily for walleye and northern pike, with secondary emphasis on black crappie, bluegill, largemouth bass, and yellow perch.   <br> \n <br> \nWalleye were moderately abundant during 2014.  Most of them were 8-12 or 16-19 inches.  Walleye angling during 2014 was slow due to abundant forage.  Walleye have typically experienced poor natural reproduction and the population has been maintained primarily through stocking.  Supplemental walleye are stocked as appropriate depending on the abundance and condition of existing walleye, and the abundance of suitable forage. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike numbers were low during 2014.  Pike experienced good natural reproduction and high populations at times during the mid to late 1990s, but lower abundances have been the norm since 2002.  Northern pike grow fast and die young in Artichoke Lake and few pike older than 4 years have ever been sampled.  Adult pike from winter rescue lakes were stocked from 2006-2011 to supplement the population.  In the absence of natural reproduction or supplemental stocking, the population can decline rapidly as has been the case in recent years.  Winter rescued northern pike, if available, will be stocked in late 2015 to supplement the population. <br> \n <br> \nGood numbers of black crappie were present in 2014.   The majority were from a strong 2013 year class and measured 5-6 inches.  Substantial numbers of 9-12 inch crappie were also present.   Anglers reported sporadic success for crappie during 2014, with the best fishing coming from the southern portion of the lake.  A DNR fishing pier located along the southeast shore is a popular location to catch crappie.       <br> \n <br> \nFreshwater drum have been abundant in recent years and anglers often report good catches of them.  Anglers are encouraged to harvest and consume them.  Excellent drum recipes can be located on the internet by searching \"drum recipes.\"  When cleaning drum do not get the slime on the fillets and carefully trim the red meat from the fillets to improve flavor. <br> \nBluegill, largemouth bass and yellow perch were caught in low numbers during the 2014 assessment.  Bluegill and largemouth bass may have been underrepresented considering anglers have reported decent fishing for them at times.   <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Artichoke Lake is located in western Minnesota approximately 14 miles northwest of Appleton.  It is a highly productive lake with a maximum depth of 15 feet and a surface area of 1,946 acres.  Anglers should study Artichoke's contour map carefully before boating because shallow, unmarked reefs exist that are navigational hazards.  An aeration system located near the \"narrows\" is usually operated during winter and it creates a substantial area of open water.  <br> \n <br> \nArtichoke Lake's fishery is managed primarily for Walleye, with secondary emphasis on Black Crappie, Yellow Perch and Northern Pike.  This targeted survey was conducted to collect routine fish population data using gill nets, quarter-inch trap nets and fall night electrofishing.  These data can be compared to historical standard and targeted survey data from Artichoke Lake. <br> \n <br> \nArtichoke Lake has a long history of providing good fishing for Walleyes.  However, the catch of adult Walleyes was low in 2018 and 2019, even though a substantial number of Walleyes have been stocked during recent years.  The poor recruitment of Walleyes has likely been due to extended periods of low oxygen in the summer following decomposition of very dense blue-green algae blooms.  Low oxygen levels can result in direct fish mortality and can also severely disrupt the food web that fish rely on.  Walleye fry are routinely stocked and they have been primarily responsible for maintaining the population.  Due to concerns regarding the low Walleye catches in 2018 and 2019, Walleye fingerlings were also stocked in 2019 in an effort to supplement the population.  However, high numbers of young Walleyes in Artichoke Lake have not always resulted in survival to adulthood.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappies were present in high numbers with most measuring 7-10 inches.  Crappies should provide some good fishing during the next several years.  A DNR fishing pier located along the southeast shoreline is a popular location to catch crappies.       <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike numbers were moderate and sizes ranged from 21-27 inches.  Pike experienced good natural reproduction and high numbers at times during the 1990s, but lower numbers have been the norm since 2002.  Northern Pike grow fast and die young in Artichoke Lake, and few pike over four years old have ever been sampled.  Adult pike are periodically stocked to supplement the population.   <br> \n <br> \nModerate numbers of Yellow Perch were present from 5-10 inches.  The perch likely resulted from stockings, however stocking success has been questionable since anglers have reported slow fishing for perch. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass were caught in moderate numbers and anglers have reported decent catches of them.  Bass in Artichoke Lake grow fast and can attain quality size in only a few years. <br> \n <br> \nFreshwater Drum were abundant and anglers have reported good fishing for them.  Anglers are encouraged to harvest and eat drum.  Good recipes can be located on the internet by searching \"drum recipes.\"  Drum are good to eat.  Their flavor can be improved by trimming the reddish meat from the fillets and by keeping them out of the slime when filleting fish. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Artichoke Lake is located in west central Minnesota.  It is rich in nutrients, shallow, windswept, and approximately 2,000 acres in size.  The lake's fishery is managed primarily for walleye and northern pike.  Strong 1993 and 1994 walleye year classes were present in 1996, providing many fish in the 14-19 inch size range.  A fair number of larger walleyes were also present, including trophy-sized fish over 25 inches.  Walleye in Artichoke Lake appear to experience poor spawning success and strong year classes have usually corresponded to years when fry were stocked.     Northern pike were low in abundance during the late 1980s and early 1990s.  This was probably due to droughty conditions which prevented northern pike from finding suitable spawning habitat.  Northern pike abundance has increased dramatically during the past several years and strong 1993-95 year classes were present in 1996.  This increase is most likely the result of higher water levels which provided suitable spawning and nursery habitats.  Most of the northern pike were 18-26 inches long.     Black crappie abundance was high during the late 1980s and early 1990s.  The population then declined dramatically by 1993.  This was probably due to a combination of factors including a decline in suitable nursery habitat, increased predator populations, and high angler harvest.  In 1996 the black crappie population was up, with strong 1995 and 1996 year classes present.  These fish should be of an angler acceptable size in 1997.  However, many of them may not survive due to what will likely be heavy predation by walleye and northern pike.     Few adult yellow perch, bluegill, or largemouth bass were noted during 1996.  However, abundant young largemouth bass were present.</p>",

It is a highly productive lake that measures 1,946 acres with a maximum depth of 15 feet.  Anglers should study the lake\u0019s contour map before boating as several shallow reef areas exist. <br> \n     <br> \nArtichoke provides a high quality sport fishery for walleye, black crappie, freshwater drum, and on occasion northern pike.  Walleye measuring 13-17 inches were abundant in 2009 and anglers reported good fishing for them.  The walleye population is almost entirely maintained by fry and fingerling stocking.  Walleye stocking occurs as needed based on walleye abundance, fish condition, and available forage. <br> \n      <br> \nGood numbers of black crappie were present in 2009 with fish measuring up to 14 inches.  Crappie frequently experience good natural reproduction. <br> \n      <br> \nNorthern pike abundance has remained relatively low during recent years due to limited suitable spawning habitat.  Adult northern pike have been stocked annually since 2006 to supplement the population. <br> \n      <br> \nFreshwater drum were abundant in 2009 and anglers reported high catches of them.  Night crawlers and leeches worked well. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>     Artichoke Lake is located in western Minnesota approximately 14 miles northwest of Appleton.  It is a highly productive lake with a maximum depth of 15 feet and a surface area of 1,946 acres.  Anglers should study Artichoke's contour map carefully before boating as several shallow, unmarked reef areas exist that are navigation hazards.  Anglers are cautioned that an aeration system located near the \"narrows\" is usually operated during winter and it creates a substantial area of open water. <br> \n    Artichoke provides a high quality fishery for walleye, black crappie, freshwater drum, and on occasion northern pike.  Walleye measuring 16-20 inches were abundant in 2011, but angling was slow due to abundant forage.  Walleye typically have experienced poor natural reproduction and the population has been maintained primarily through stocking.  Walleye fry and fingerlings are stocked as needed based on the existing walleye population, walleye condition, and available forage. <br> \n     High numbers of black crappie were present in 2011 with fish measuring up to 14 inches.  Crappie frequently experience good natural reproduction and strong year classes occurred in 2009 and 2010. <br> \n     During recent years northern pike have experienced poor natural reproduction due to limited suitable spawning habitat.  The population has been supplemented by stocking adults netted from winterkill lakes.  These stockings have helped maintain a moderate population of pike. <br> \n     Freshwater drum have been abundant in recent years and anglers often report good catches of them.  Night crawlers and leeches have been good bait choices.  Drum have a delicate white flesh and provide excellent table fair.  Their flavor can be improved further by trimming the reddish \"mud line\" meat from the fillets when cleaning.  Anglers are encouraged to harvest and consume them.  Excellent drum recipes can be located on the internet by searching \"drum recipes\".</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Artichoke Lake is located in western Minnesota approximately 14 miles northwest of Appleton.  It is a highly productive lake with a maximum depth of 15 feet and a surface area of 1,964 acres.  Artichoke Lake has several shallow reefs that are not marked and anglers should study a contour map carefully before boating there.  An aeration system located near the \"narrows\" is usually operated during winter and it creates a substantial area of open water.  <br> \n <br> \nArtichoke Lake's fishery is managed primarily for Walleyes, with secondary emphasis on Black Crappies, Northern Pike and Yellow Perch.  This 2020 Targeted Survey was conducted to collect routine fish population data using gill nets, trap nets and fall night electrofishing.  These data can be compared to historical Standard and Targeted Survey data from Artichoke Lake. <br> \n <br> \nWalleyes were moderately abundant in 2020.  Most Walleyes were 13-15 inches, but a wide range of sizes were present with the largest measuring 27 inches.  Fry stocking has been primarily responsible for maintaining the Walleye population.  However, following low Walleye gill net catches in 2018 and 2019, fingerling and yearling Walleyes were stocked during the fall of 2019 to supplement the population.  At times, even though high numbers of young Walleyes have been present, they have not always survived to adulthood.  This has likely been due to extended periods of low oxygen in the summer following decomposition of very dense algae blooms.  Low oxygen levels can result in direct fish mortality and can also severely disrupt the food web that fish rely on.   <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappies were present in high numbers from 6-11 inches.  Crappies should provide some good fishing during the next several years.  A public fishing pier located along the southeast shoreline is a popular location to catch crappies.       <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike were moderately abundant with some near 30 inches.  Northern Pike grow fast and die young in Artichoke Lake, and few pike over four years old have ever been sampled.  Natural reproduction by pike has been good at times during wet springs, but overall it has been poor due to limited spawning habitat.  Supplemental stockings of adult pike have been successful at times, but not consistently.   <br> \n <br> \nLow numbers of Yellow Perch were present.  Recent perch stockings do not appear to have been successful at creating a fishery. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass were caught in moderate numbers and anglers have reported decent catches of them during recent years.  Bass in Artichoke Lake grow fast and can reach a quality size in only a few years. <br> \n <br> \nFreshwater Drum were moderately abundant and anglers have reported good fishing for them.  Drum are good to eat and anglers are encouraged to harvest them.  Good recipes can be located on the internet.  Their flavor can be improved by keeping the slime from contacting the fillets and trimming off the reddish meat. <br> \n</p>",
