                "narrative": "<p>Island Lake is located in Lyon County 12 miles southwest of the city of Marshall, has a surface area of 163 acres, and maximum depth of 8 feet.  Island Lake is primarily managed for northern pike and secondarily for yellow perch.  Population assessments have been conducted every 4 to 6 years since 1988.  The most recent survey was conducted during the week of July 25th, 2011 with 1 gill net and 7 trap nets.   <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nIsland Lake is characterized by a simple fish community.  During the 2011 population assessment only 4 species were sampled, northern pike, yellow perch, black bullhead, and green sunfish.  Simple fish communities can be easily managed and manipulated to augment catch rates, but in the same way they can be easily devastated with overfishing and habitat degradation.  Island is a relatively isolated lake from large scale disturbances in the watershed and has a small watershed-to-lake ratio of 5.  While this is good from a landuse, erosion, and water pollution standpoint, isolation can lead to issues in low waters years as drought can lead to habitat fragmentation that can interrupt natural reproduction (especially for northern pike).  Additionally, small watershed-to-lake ratio lakes can be primed for winterkill events because influxes of well oxygenated water sources are uncommon in winter months.  So far, Island Lake has been free of these types of issues, although future management must be swift if such conditions do arise if the fish community is expected to remain healthy.    <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nIsland Lake northern pike numbers are impressive when compared to other Windom Area lakes.  The northern pike catch rate in 2011 was 27 fish per gill net which is more than 3 times the upper normal range of 8.0 fish per gill net.  Additionally, the 2011 gill net catch rate was the greatest on record and 3 times the long-term average gill net catch rate of 9.0 fish per net.  The trap net catch rate was 2.6 fish per net which was also greater than the long-term average of 1.8 fish per net.  The average length of northern pike in the gill nets and trap nets was 19.0 and 12.2 inches respectively with a range of 7.4 to 30.8 inches.  Analyzing size structure of the northern pike in the sample indicated a population favoring smaller fish.  While the size of the fish was less than the desired management goal the larger fish in the sample met the goal of maintaining some large fish in the sample and the catch rate was greater than the goal of 5 per gill net.  Additionally, the condition of the northern pike in the sample was good.  The northern pike population in Island Lake appears to be primed to produce a balanced population within the management goals with trophy size fish possible over the next 5 to 10 years as evidenced by the current size structure, abundance, condition, and evidence of very good natural reproduction.  If you have some young anglers looking to catch their first northern pike, Island Lake is a prime lake.  <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike rely on an adequate forage base to be successful in a lake, and Island has a very good forage base for northern pike in the presence of yellow perch.  Yellow perch in Island Lake are at an all time high catch rate of 444 fish per gill net.  The current catch rate is nearly 18 times the upper normal range of 25.0 fish per gill net and 3 times the long-term average catch rate of 151.6 fish per gill net.  From those statistics it is apparent that Island Lake produces many yellow perch.  Usually, an extremely high catch rate of yellow perch indicates a population dominated by a single size group of fish.  That is not the case in Island Lake.  The average length of yellow perch in the gill nets and trap nets was 8.4 and 6.6 inches, respectively, with a range in length of 4.5 to 10.8 inches.  The sample indicated a balanced size structure.  In addition, the overall condition of the population was good indicating a population that is foraging successfully and is not experiencing stress of overpopulation due to competition with other yellow perch.  The yellow perch population in Island Lake is currently exceeding the management goal of maintaining abundance within the normal range.  Fishing for yellow perch should include good sizes of fish the possibility to catch your daily limit each time you go.   <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nThe black bullhead population in Island Lake appears to be suppressed from historical levels.  The 2011 gill net and trap net catch rates were 43.0 and 49.1 fish per net, respectively, but within their respective normal ranges(gill net = 30.3 to 150.6 fish per net; trap net = 0.1 to 0.3 fish per net).  The long-term gill net catch rate is 93.5 fish per gill net, so the current level is less than half of the long-term average.  While the population appears depressed, whether by predation, competition, or other causes, the population size structure was in a balanced state.  The average size of black bullhead was 7.2 inches with a range in length from 4.3 to 16.3 inches.  The black bullhead population currently is displaying low population abundance in relation to historical levels, but given an opportunity to successfully reproduce, the population will expand.  Based on the netting done in Windom Area lakes in 2011, black bullhead fishing on Island Lake is probably one of the best places for numbers of harvestable size fish in the Windom Fisheries Management area and should be a destination for all bullhead anglers. <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nGreen sunfish were observed in the catch on Island Lake and appear to be doing well.  The trap net catch rate was 2.0 fish per net, essentially equal to the upper normal value.  The average size of green sunfish was 4.3 inches with a range in length from 3.3 to 5.8 inches.  Green sunfish are opportunistic fish that when given an opportunity to do well they will increase in number and dominate the sunfish population of a lake as is seen in Island Lake by the lack of other sunfish in the sample.     <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nIsland Lake is a resource worth protecting.  Most of the Windom Area Management lakes are managed for walleye.  Island Lake has no walleye but supports an excellent number of northern pike and yellow perch which is rare in the area.  Best management practices should be utilized in the watershed to maintain the unique and healthy fishery found in Island Lake.   <br> \n <br> \n <br> \nPrepared by Nate Hodgins <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Island Lake is located in Lyon County 12 miles southwest of the city of Marshall, has surface area of 163 acres, and maximum depth of 8 feet. Island Lake is primarily managed for northern pike and secondarily for yellow perch. Island Lake has limited shoreline available to the public for shoreline fishing but does have a state owned access on the west side of the lake for boat launching and winter fishing access. The northern pike catch rate was above average for lakes similar to Island. Lengths of  northern pike ranged from 22.6 to 32.8 inches with an average length of 26.3 inches. The average weight of northern pike swimming in Island is over three pounds. Good pike fishing has been reported in recent years, especially during the winter months. Northern pike adults stocked in 1994 have reproduced well with the high water level of the late 90's and early 2000 providing flooded grasses and aquatic vegetation which is critical pike spawning habitat. Water levels have since receded and it may be necessary to stock northern fingerlings in the future to maintain the pike population in Island Lake.The yellow perch population continues to be above average and the typical perch weighs over half a pound. Lengths of yellow perch sampled ranged from 6.7 to 13.0 inches and averaged nearly 10 inches. Although yellow perch numbers tend to cycle in most lakes, the large number of northern pike may be aiding the perch population by foraging on smaller perch and keeping them from becoming too abundant. It may be wise to practice some catch and release during any \"hot\" pike bites to ensure there are enough predators to maintain this quality yellow perch fishery.The bullhead population is still high. Total lengths of black bullhead ranged between 4.7 and 9.5 inches while brown bullhead had total lengths that ranged between 5.1 and 14.0 inches. The abundance of bullhead in Island provides an excellent opportunity to introduce the beginning angler to some fast action. It is interesting to note that although the bullhead population remains high, brown bullhead numbers are now far greater than the black bullhead numbers and the presence of brown bullheads is sometimes used as an indicator of good water quality.To promote and maintain healthy fish populations, pollution and other inputs need to be controlled. Fish habitats are directly affected by water quality. Nutrient, sediment and other waste inputs can drastically alter the biological, chemical, and physical components of a lake. It is important to maintain if not improve the current water quality of Island Lake through watershed management to preserve this fishery for future generations to enjoy.Prepared by Philip Nasby</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Island Lake is a 163-acre lake located in Lyon County 12 miles southwest of the City of Marshall.  This is a unique lake given its location within the watershed.  Unlike many of the other lakes in our Windom Fish Management Area, Island Lake is nearly isolated with very little connectivity.  Historical photos for the last 30+ years has indicated significant water level changes over that period.  Island Lake is relatively shallow (maximum depth 8.0 ft.) thus the primary management species is Northern Pike, and the secondary management species is Yellow Perch. A survey was conducted the week of July 17, 2023, to monitor fish populations using one gill net and eight trap nets. <br> \n  <br> \nHistorically, Northern Pike catch rates have ranged from 0.0 per trap net in 1988 and 1999 to 4.1 per trap net in 2017.  In 2023 the Northern Pike catch rate was 2.5 per trap net, which is slightly above the long-term average of 2.2 per trap net.  The gill net catch rate of Northern Pike was 3.0 per gill net, which is within the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (1.1 to 8.0 per gill net).  Northern Pike fingerlings were stocked in 2016 and 2022, in addition, Island Lake has favorable habitat for Northern Pike reproduction.  Lengths of Northern Pike ranged from 23.3 to 33.1 inches and averaged 28.4 inches.  Island Lake is within the \"southern zone\" of the Northern Pike zone regulations, so two Pike longer than 24 inches can be harvested.  Northern Pike under 24 inches must be released. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch catch rates have been highly variable in Island Lake, ranging from 8.5 per gill net in 1988 to 444.0 per gill net in 2011, and averaging 118.6 per gill net since 1988.  In 2023 the Yellow Perch catch rate was 35.0 per gill net, similar to the 2017 catch rate of 37.5 per gill net.  The catch rate in 2023 exceeded the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (2.7 to 25.0 per gill net).  Yellow Perch lengths ranged from 4.7 to 6.6 inches and averaged 5.6 inches (PSD=68).  The Yellow Perch need to grow a bit before most anglers would target them.  <br> \n <br> \nThe Black Bullhead catch rate was 70.0 per gill net, which is within the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (30.3 to 150.6 per gill net).  Lengths of Black Bullhead ranged from 4.3 to 14.6 inches and averaged 7.0 inches.  Brown Bullhead were also abundant being captured at a rate of 86.0 per gill net, greater than the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (0.5 to 5.6 per gill net).  Brown Bullhead lengths ranged from 4.7 to 15.3 inches and average 9.1 inches.  The fish community in Island Lake is simple, as the only other species of fish sampled was one 22.6 inch Walleye.  It is highly likely that an angler moved that Walleye in from another lake as DNR has not stocked Walleye.    <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>A targeted survey of nearshore fish species in Island Lake was conducted on June 27-28, 2018 by Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) Program Staff.  Sampling sites were evenly spaced around the lake and each was sampled by backpack electrofishing and seining with a 50-foot or 15-foot seine, where possible.  Backpack electrofishing was completed at ten sampling stations, but two stations were sampled from the boat due to site conditions.  Similarly, a 50-foot seine was used to sample three stations, a 15-foot seine was used at five stations, and site conditions prevented the use of seines at two stations.  Nearshore sampling captured just six species of fish including three that are tolerant of disturbance (Black Bullhead, Fathead Minnow, and Green Sunfish) but none that are intolerant of disturbance. <br> \n <br> \nThe nearshore data were combined with trap net and gill net data from a July 2017 standard survey to describe the fish community and provide a Fish-based IBI (FIBI) score. The FIBI uses fish community data to measure a lake's health, and the types of fish species present can help identify any stressors that may be negatively affecting the lake environment.  In Minnesota lakes, certain fish species cannot survive without clean water and a healthy habitat (e.g. Blackchin Shiner, Iowa Darter, and Rock Bass), while other species are tolerant of degraded conditions (e.g. Black Bullhead, Fathead Minnow, and Green Sunfish).  The FIBI score, composed of several fish community diversity and composition metrics, indicates the overall health of a lake by comparing it to what is expected for a healthy lake.  For additional information on the FIBI, search for \"lake index of biological integrity\" on the mndnr.gov website.   <br> \n <br> \nData from this survey indicates Island Lake is in poor health as indicated by an FIBI score below the impairment threshold for aquatic life use determined for similar lakes.  Data from this survey will contribute biological information about the health of the fish community to the Redwood River Watershed assessment process in coordination with MN Pollution Control Agency.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Island Lake is primarily managed for yellow perch.  During our summer sampling in 1994, we found that theyellow perch population was 10 times as abundant as most other lakes similar to Island Lake.  Although there werea lot of yellow perch, many of them were small (average length was 6.3 inches).  Most of the yellow  perch wereaged as one and two year old fish.  Yellow perch growth was slow due to their high abundance.  Island lake didprovide some fast ice fishing action early in the winter of 1994/1995.  The future of the yellow perch populationlooks good as long as the vegetation and water levels remain where they were in 1994.     Northern pike have just recently been stocked in Island Lake.  With the availability of good spawning habitatand abundant food (fathead minnows, yellow perch, black bullhead), we are optimistic that the northern pike couldprovide a self-sustaining fishery.  However, if water levels change and or the northern pike fishery receivesconsiderable harvest by anglers, the success will be diminished.  Fish populations in small lakes are more likelyto be negatively affected by fishing (harvest) than larger lakes.     Black bullhead are large and abundant in Island Lake.  Black bullhead lengths ranged from 4.3 to 14.3 inches,and averaged nearly 8.5 inches.  If you enjoy bullhead fishing, don't overlook Island Lake.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Northern pike and yellow perch are the primary species of management in Island Lake.  Northern pike has provided some excellent ice fishing for anglers since its first and only stocking in 1994.  During the last few years, high water levels and aquatic vegetation have provided excellent spawning habitat for northern pike which has enabled the population to continue.  Total lengths of northern pike sampled ranged between 20.4 and 26.5 inches.  The average weight of northern pike sampled in our gill nets was almost 3 lbs. which would provide good table fare for most anglers.  Total lengths of yellow perch ranged between 5.9 and 11.7 inches.  By maintaining adequate numbers of northern pike, yellow perch growth should remain adequate to prevent stunting.  Harvest of larger predators in some of these small systems in the pothole prairie region can have significant effects on fish populations.  The yellow perch/northern pike combination can coexist successfully by providing forage for northern pike and at the same time keeping the yellow perch population from becoming too abundant.  The black and brown bullhead populations have become numerous since the last survey in 1994.  Total lengths of black bullhead ranged between 5.0 and 11.1 inches while brown bullhead had total lengths that ranged between 5.8 and 12.0 inches.  Both species of bullhead can provide some excellent fishing if you enjoy catching bullheads.  Brown bullheads have been used in fish management as an indicator of good water quality.  It is possible that water quality in Island Lake is improving. To promote and maintain healthy fish populations, pollution and other inputs need to be controlled.  Fish habitats are directly affected by water quality.  Nutrient, sediment and other waste inputs can drastically alter the biological, chemical, and physical components of a lake.  It is paramount to maintain if not improve the current water quality of Island Lake through watershed management to preserve this fishery for future generations to enjoy.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Island Lake is a 163-acre lake located in Lyon County 12 miles southwest of the City of Marshall.  Island Lake is relatively shallow (maximum depth 8.0 ft.) and can have low winter dissolved oxygen thus the primary management species is Northern Pike, and the secondary management species is Yellow Perch (both tolerate low dissolved oxygen). A survey was conducted the week of July 24, 2017 to monitor fish populations using two gill nets and nine trap nets.  <br> \n <br> \nIn 2017, Northern Pike were captured at a rate of 1.5 per gill net, a decrease from 27.0 per gill net in 2011, but within the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (1.1 to 8.0 per gill net). The trap net catch rate was 4.1 per trap net, which is consistent with historical catch rates and above the long term average of 2.2 per trap net.  Lengths of Northern Pike ranged from 17.2 to 29.3 inches and averaged 23.7 inches.  The Northern Pike population is doing well in Island Lake and should provide a good angling opportunity.  Beginning on the 2018 fishing opener, the Northern Pike daily limit changes to 2, and all Northern Pike less than 24 inches need to be released. <br> \n <br> \nThe 2017 Yellow Perch catch rate was 37.5 per gill net, a decrease from the 2011 catch rate of 444.0 per gill net, but still exceeding the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (2.7 to 25.0 per gill net). Several year classes were present, as lengths of Yellow Perch ranged from 5.4 to 12.4 inches and averaged 8.5 inches.   <br> \n <br> \nThe Black Bullhead catch rate was 94.5 per gill net, which is within the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (30.3 to 150.6 per gill net).  Lengths of Black Bullhead ranged from 5.6 to 8.8 inches and averaged 6.6 inches.  Brown Bullhead were also abundant being captured at a rate of 32.0 per gill net, greater than the interquartile range of catch rates for class 43 lakes (0.5 to 5.6 per gill net).  Brown Bullhead lengths ranged from 6.5 to 9.7 inches and average 8.4 inches.  The fish community in Island Lake is simple, as the only other species of fish sampled was Green Sunfish.  Interestingly, there are only a handful of lakes in the Windom Fish Management area that historically have not had common carp present and Island Lake is one of those. <br> \n</p>",
