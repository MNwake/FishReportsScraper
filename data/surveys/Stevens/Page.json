Walleyes obtain 14 to 15 inches within two years. 34 of the 50 Walleyes sampled were 1 year olds and probably came from a fry stocking in 1985. There were 12, 2 year old Walleyes. Since there was no stocking in 1984, natural reproduction must have created the year class. A 1983 fry stocking appears to be a failure. The few large Walleyes sampled probably came from a 1981 Walleye fingerling or adult stocking. The Northern Pike in Page Lake probably are able to reproduce. In aging, the Northern Pike, there appeared to be two groups of fish. The first, a very fast growing fish, probably a naturally reproduced Page Lake fish. The second group was a slow growing 2 or 3 year old fish from Lake Mary and when stocked into Page Lake grew quite fast. The Yellow Perch population has good size distribution with some perch being 13.0+ long. The Sunfish and Crappie population is poor. Black Bullheads are very abundant.</p>",

Emergent vegetation is rare and submergent vegetation islimited to sago pondweed and claspingleaf pondweed.Walleye are now abundant in Page lake.  Gillnet catches averaged 34.0 fish/net in 1995, compared to 2.0fish/net in 1991.  Mean weight of fish captured was 1.8 pounds.  Age-3 fish (1992 year class) comprised76% of the fish captured in gillnets.  This year class corresponds to a fry stocking in 1992.  Age-2fish comprised 21% of the fish captured in gillnets.  This year class is the result of naturalreproduction.  Natural reproduction of walleye was also evident in previous surveys.  Other gamefishcaptured in survey nets included bluegill and northern pike.  Bluegill catches averaged 0.6fish/trapnet and one eight inch northern pike was captured in a trapnet.  One hour of daytime, DCelectrofishing yielded one largemouth bass which was 16.0 inches in total length and weighed 2.7pounds.  Black bullhead gillnet catches decreased from 227.8 fish/net in 1986 and 97.3 fish/net in1991, to 2.7 fish/net in 1995.  Trapnet catches fell from 40.0 fish/net in 1991 to 2.3 fish/net in1995.  This decrease is likely the result of the natural die off of a dominant year class.  There hasbeen only 75 pounds of bullheads removed from Page Lake by commercial harvest since 1986.  Fatheadminnow and orange-spotted sunfish were very abundant in shoreline seine hauls.  These species accountfor most of the forage available in Page Lake.      </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Page Lake is a shallow, turbid, and seasonally hyper-eutrophic basin. Maximum depth is approximately 17.0 ft. The lake receives extensive nutrient loading from its agricultural watershed via County Ditch 6A.  These added nutrients often result in dense algal blooms during summer months.  In absence of a severe bloom, water clarity averages approximately 5.0 ft.  Seasonally poor water clarity and subsequent lack of submerged vegetation constitute a poorly suited environment for ambush feeding predators such as northern pike and largemouth bass.  Sunfish numbers are similarly low in response to lack of cover, shelter, and feeding areas.  Those gamefishes reasonably tolerant of existing habitat conditions include walleye, yellow perch, and black crappie.  Even these gamefishes have been subject to infrequent winterkill events.  Much of the total fish community biomass in such lakes is made up of adaptable, but less desirable fishes such black bullhead, common carp, and white sucker.  <br> \n <br> \nPage Lake is stocked with walleye fry on an alternate year schedule.  Contributions of stocking have been inconsistent, but the lake does support a viable fishery.  Walleye catches averaged 3.0 fish/gillnet in 2006, which near average for similar lakes.  Fishing quality, expressed as average size caught, is good.  Walleye grow very fast in Page Lake.  Three-year-old walleye averaged 16.4 in. in length.  Mean weight of walleye captured in the 2006 survey was 1.9 lbs.  The year class established from the 2004 fry stocking looks fairly strong. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch catches have been highly variable among surveys.  At present, Page Lake is holding an abundant population of medium-size perch.  Gillnet catches greatly exceed the range of expected or normal catches.  Ninety-three percent of survey captures were between 7.0 and 9.5 inches.  Mean weight was 0.29 lbs.  In absence of winterkill, these fish will provide an exceptional fishery beginning as early as 2007.  <br> \n <br> \nA severe winterkill in 1989 claimed the black crappie population.  No crappie were captured in 1991, 1995, and 2001 surveys.   Adult black crappie were stocked in spring of 2002 in an effort to restore the population and enhance fishing potential.  Restorative stocking was successful in achieving those objectives. A potentially good fishery is developing.   All crappie captured were age-3 and progeny of adults stocked in 2002.  Growth to age-3 was exceptional.  Average length of these young fish captured in a July survey was 8.5 inches. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass, bluegill, and northern pike are present, but population abundances are low due to limiting habitat conditions and excessive mortality of juvenile fish.  With little competition, survivors grow fast.  Average sizes will likely exceed those residing in less fertile lakes with greater densities.    <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Page Lake is a 375-acre, shallow, and fertile prairie lake located a mile north of Hancock in southeast Stevens County.  Maximum depth of the natural basin is 17.0 feet.  Average depth is estimated at 12.0 feet.  The lake has a small watershed area and thus surface water elevations are strongly influenced by volume of snowmelt and stormwater runoff.  Lake elevation readings varied by 8.0 feet from 1982 to 1990 after precipitation cycles shifted from a wet weather period to an extended drought.  The threat of winterkill amplifies at low water levels. <br> \n   <br> \nVery little water quality documentation exists for the lake.  Algal blooms, which are common in mid- and late-summer, can reduce water transparency measurements to 4.0 feet or less.  Aquatic plants are constrained by seasonally poor water clarity.  Such habitat conditions can shape fish community structure.  Vegetation-dependent and sight-feeding predators which include Bluegill, Largemouth Bass, and Northern Pike tend to persist at low densities.  Those gamefishes most tolerant of habitat conditions include Walleye, Black Crappie, and Yellow Perch. <br> \n <br> \nA standard fish survey was completed in 2017 to gain updated documentation of fish community structure, gamefish abundance and size distribution, and assess success of Walleye stockings.  Survey methodology included a spring electrofishing survey completed on May 18 to effectively sample the Largemouth Bass population.  The netting component of the survey was conducted July 17-20.  Gill nets and trap nets were utilized to sample the remaining fish community. <br> \n <br> \nThirty-two Largemouth Bass were captured during the spring electrofishing survey.  The modest catch confirmed expectations of limited abundance; however, catches greatly improved from those of prior surveys.  No bass were captured during 2001 and 2006 electrofishing surveys.  Size of captured bass ranged from 11.1 to 17.9 inches.  Seven age classes were represented in the total catch.  A fishable population has become established where it did not previously exist. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye proved to be abundant.  Gill net catches averaged 14.7 fish/net.  Catches ranged from 8.0 to 27.0 inches.  Average length was 13.5 inches.  The elevated catch rate and modest average size were attributable to success of fry stockings in 2014 and 2016.  Three-year-olds made up 62% of the total catch.  These fish should exceed 16.0 inches in 2018. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie also proved to be abundant in 2017.  Age assignments extended to age 8.  Reproductive success and survival of young crappies was exceptional in 2011.  Six-year-old cohorts of this age class averaged 11.3 inches.  The largest crappie caught measured 12.5 inches. <br> \n <br> \nAs anticipated, Bluegill catches were low.  However, the Bluegill population at time of the 2017 survey offered relatively unique opportunities to catch large fish.  Sixteen of 25 trap net captures exceeded 8.0 inches.  Three 10.0-inch Bluegills were measured. <br> \n <br> \nThe Yellow Perch population also supported an increasingly unique fishery.  Perch proved to be very abundant.  Age assignments extended to age 6.  Over 50% of perch captures were 10.0 inches and larger.  The largest perch measured 12.7 inches in length. <br> \n  <br> \nOnly one Northern Pike was captured during the 2017 survey. <br> \n <br> \nIt is apparent from increased angling activity and fishing reports that anglers are aware of Page Lake's quality fishing opportunities and fishing pressure has increased.  Anglers are urged to exercise self-control and limit harvest to that which is enough for a meal.  Such harvest constraint may extend quality fishing opportunities.  <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Page Lake is a 375-acre shallow and fertile prairie lake located one mile north of Hancock in southeast Stevens County. Maximum depth of the natural basin is 17.0 feet. Average depth is estimated at 12.0 feet. The lake has a small watershed area and thus surface water elevations are strongly influenced by volume of snowmelt and stormwater runoff. Algae blooms and suspended sediments impair water clarity during summer months. Low water clarity limits coverage and diversity of aquatic vegetation within the lake. Due to high fertility of the water fish grow rapidly and Page Lake can provide good fishing opportunities.  <br> \n <br> \nA standard fisheries survey was completed in July of 2023 to evaluate abundance and size distribution of gamefish populations. Page Lake supports a healthy Walleye fishery sustained through supplemental fry stockings. Gill net catch rates have decreased in recent years (5.0 Walleye/gill net), but still exceed management objectives and are well above average for similar lakes in Minnesota. Walleye grow rapidly in this productive basin and typically reach 16.0 inches after three growing seasons. The largest Walleye measured was 24.6 inches. Approximately 97% of Walleyes captured were larger than 15 inches.  <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike were not observed during the 2023 survey. Low numbers of Northern Pike have been observed in past surveys, but limited vegetation combined with low water clarity greatly reduce spawning and foraging success for this species.  <br> \n <br> \nTwenty-four Largemouth Bass were captured during the spring electrofishing survey. The modest catch indicated a decrease in abundance from the record high 2017 survey. No bass were captured during the 2001, 2006, and 2011 electrofishing surveys. Size structure of the electrofishing catch described a quality fishery. One hundred percent of the bass were over 12.0 inches and the largest bass observed was 19.4 inches. A lack of small bass indicates poor recruitment and may result in continued declines in future catch rates.  <br> \n <br> \nBluegill catch rates (17.9 fish/trap net) were the highest observed over the past four decades. Age distribution of Bluegill catches extended to age 5, but 74% of captures were young (ages 1 or 2). Consequently, average size was low (4.1 inches). Growth was rapid and did allow some individuals to reach almost 10 inches. Black Crappie catch rates declined significantly from the previous two surveys. Crappie catches were 0.0 and 0.3 fish/net for gill nets and trap nets, respectively. Although low, the 2023 catch rates resemble the historical averages for Black Crappie in Page Lake.  <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch numbers remained near record highs (119.5/gill net). Multiple Yellow Perch larger than 13.0 inches were observed; however, 93.3% of the fish were less than 8.0 inches in length. Approximately 75% of the Yellow Perch sampled were less than two years old. Fast growth combined with an abundance of young fish in Page Lake may allow for increased angling opportunities in the coming years. <br> \n  <br> \nOther species sampled during the 2023 survey included Black Bullhead and Common Carp. The next standard lake survey is tentatively scheduled for 2029. <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Page Lake is a shallow, hypereutrophic basin located just north of Hancock in Stevens County.  .  The lake receives extensive nutrient loading from its mostly agricultural watershed, particularly County Ditch 6A.  These added nutrients result in dense blue-green algal blooms during summer months.  The lake supports little recreational use because of degraded water quality.The fish community in Page Lake is typical of highly degraded lakes.  Walleye, yellow perch, and black bullhead are the dominant species.  Walleye gill net catches averaged 13.8 fish/net in 2001.  Age-1 and age-2 fish comprised 80% of the fish captured. Age-1 fish correspond to a fry stocking in 2000, and age-2 fish are the result of natural reproduction.  Age-2 fish averaged 14.0 inches in August of 2001.  Yellow perch are abundant.  Gill net catches averaged 136.5 fish/net.  Size structure of the population is exceptional.  Most of the fish were between 10 and 12 inches in length.  An initial stocking of northern pike fry occurred in 2000.  There were quite a few age-1 northern pike captured during the lake survey. These fish may provide an additional angling opportunity in the near future.  Adult black crappie may also be stocked to enhance the fishery.     </p>",

                "narrative": "<p>The fish community in Page Lake is typical of fertile lakes which experience periodic oxygen depletions.  Black Bullheads comprised over 90% of the fish caught in survey nets, both in terms of numbers and weight.  Game fish are limited in terms of species diversity and abundance.  Walleye CPUE averaged 2.0 fish/gill net in 1991.  This is less than the 10.0 fish/gill net captured during the 1986 survey, however, 34 of the 50 Walleyes captured were age 1 fish.  This year class (1985) comprised 50% of the fish captured in 1991.  Fry were stocked in 1985, however, there is evidence of limited natural reproduction occurring in 1984, 1986, 1988 and 1989.  Growth rates are excellent with fish averaging 15.8 inches in total length at the time of annulus formation.  The Northern Pike catch rate fell from 4.5 fish/gill net in 1986 to 0.33 fish/gill net in 1991.  Over 1300 adult Northern Pike were stocked in May of 1985 and an additional 300 fish were stocked in May of 1986.  Northern Pike have not been stocked since 1986.  Bluegill density remains low (0.9 fish/trap net) in spite of adult stockings in 1987 and 1988.  This catch rate is well below the 25% quartile of 11.7 Bluegill/trap net for lakes within lake classification 31.  Physical and biological factors that are limiting Bluegill abundance need to be identified.  Page Lake was identified by local resource managers as being impaired by nonpoint source pollution in the Stevens county comprehensive water plan.  Fishing and swimming suitability was rated as poor by the local resource managers.  Eutrophication, periodic oxygen depletion, and physical habitat degradation is limiting the sport fishery in Page Lake.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Page Lake is a shallow, very fertile lake located immediatley north of Hancock in southeast Stevens County.  Maximum depth is approximately 17.0 ft. The lake receives extensive nutrient loading from its agricultural watershed via County Ditch 6A.  These added nutrients often result in dense algal blooms during summer months.  In absence of a severe bloom, water clarity averages approximately 5.0 ft.  Seasonally poor water clarity and subsequent lack of submerged vegetation constitute a poor environment for cover-dependent and ambush feeding predators such as bluegill, northern pike and largemouth bass.   Those gamefishes reasonably tolerant of existing habitat conditions include walleye, yellow perch, and black crappie.  Even these gamefishes have been subject to infrequent winterkill events. <br> \n   <br> \nPage Lake is stocked with walleye fry on an alternate year schedule.  Contributions of stocking have been inconsistent.  Survey catches in 2011 documented that the 2008 stocking was very successful.  Walleye catches averaged 20.0 fish/gillnet.   All captures were age-3.   Average length of fish captured during the August survey was 16.0 inches.  Mean weight of walleye captured was 1.4 pounds. <br> \n   <br> \nA quality perch fishery currently exists in Page Lake.  Twenty-one percent of survey captures exceeded 10.0 inches in length.  Six percent of perch captures exceeded 12.0 inches.  Growth is exceptional.  Yellow perch in Page Lake approached 10.0 inches after three years.  Average length of sampled perch was 8.8 inches.  Mean weight was 0.36 pounds.  <br> \n  <br> \nA severe winterkill in 1989 claimed the black crappie population.  No crappie were captured during 1991, 1995, and 2001 surveys.   Adult black crappie were stocked in spring of 2002 in an effort to restore the population and enhance fishing potential.  Restorative stocking was successful in achieving those objectives.  Trapnet catches greatly exceeded expected catches for similar lakes.   Ninety-four percent of captures were age-1 fish.  Growth to age-3 was exceptional.  Average length of these young fish was 9.6 inches.  In absence of winterkill, these fish will provide an exceptional fishery beginning as early as 2012. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth bass, northern pike, and bluegill are present, but population densities are low due to limiting habitat conditions.  Young bluegill are observed, but due to lack of escape cover, few survive to catchable size.   With little competition, survivors grow fast.  Age-4 bluegill averaged 8.5 inches in total length.  The largest bluegill captured during the 2011 survey was 9.5 inches. <br> \n</p>",
