Several year classes were identified, and all fish but one (a ten-year old) had been naturally produced.  The growth rate appeared to have been average for the area.Standard trap nets caught few smallmouth bass, but the gill net catch was normal for the lake class and among the higher catches observed for the lake.  Several contiguous year classes were identified, and all were naturally produced.The northern pike catch was low for the lake class but within the usual range for this lake.  Average size was typical for the lake, and growth had been faster than the average for area lakes of the same class.The number of yellow perch in trap nets was within the lower portion of the usual range for the lake class, but was the highest in this lake since 1956.  Average size of perch was larger than for most lakes of the same class.White sucker abundance appeared to be within the usual range for the lake and lake class.  Average size of white suckers remained relatively large for the lake class.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Round Lake is managed primarily for walleye and smallmouth bass.  The current (2014) lake management plan established a long range goal for walleye consisting of a minimum gill net catch of 3.0 fish/set, with some fish over 20 inches present.  That plan established a size-based long range goal for smallmouth bass:  among smallmouth bass large enough to be taken by anglers (larger than eight inches), at least half must be quality-sized fish (over 12 inches in length).  This was the first of three standard surveys scheduled in the 2014 plan to determine the contribution of stocked walleye to the population, and whether the stocking regime used in this lake since 2009 would produce a population meeting the long range goal. <br> \n <br> \nFair numbers of walleye were present in 2015, including some fish larger than 20 inches; however, the long range catch goal for the lake was not met. The 2015 walleye gill net catch was similar to the catch observed in the 2008 survey, prior to the commencement of the current stocking effort.  Although the 2015 catch fell within the normal range for a lake of this class, it was fairly low for this lake historically.  Five year classes contributed to the 2015 catch.  Of the 14 walleye captured, seven came from stocked years, and seven had apparently been produced naturally in years with no stocking.  Because walleye can reproduce successfully in this lake, it was likely that some of the walleye from stocked years had also been produced naturally, so the contribution of stocked walleye to the 2015 catch was probably under 50 percent.  No strong year classes were evident.  Growth of young walleye had been about average, with fish reaching a mean length of 11.0 inches by the end of their third year. <br> \n <br> \nThe smallmouth bass gill net catch was dominated by a strong group of small three-year-old fish from the 2012 year class.  As a result, although the catch was fairly high, the mean weight for fish taken in 2015 was low.  Among fish larger than eight inches (nine fish in all), only two (22%) were larger than 12 inches.    Growth of young smallmouth bass taken in 2015 had been slow; three-year-old fish had reached a mean length of just 6.1 inches by the end of their third year.  Similarly slow growth was observed among the four-year-old fish taken. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern pike numbers were fairly low in Round Lake in 2015, although similarly low numbers have been seen in several past surveys of this lake.  Thanks to the presence of fair numbers of five-year-old fish, and few younger fish, the mean weight for northern pike taken in 2015 was the highest seen to date in this lake. It appeared that reproductive success may have been spotty in recent years; only two- and five-year-old fish were taken, suggesting little or no reproduction in other years.  Growth of young northern pike had been somewhat faster than average; two-year-old fish reached a mean length of 16.3 inches by the end of their second year, compared to an area average of 14.6 inches. <br> \n <br> \nThe yellow perch gill net catch was low for a lake of this type, and for Round Lake historically, although catches have varied considerably in this lake from survey to survey and show no downward trend.  Yellow perch are the only major forage species available to walleye in this lake, and have probably been important to northern pike as well.  Good growth observed for walleye and northern pike taken in this survey suggested that enough yellow perch remained to provide adequate forage.  Round Lake has rarely produced many yellow perch large enough to have been of interest to anglers, and that was again the case in 2015. <br> \n</p>",

Naturally-produced fish had contributed substantially to the walleye population, accounting for at least half of the fish collected in 1996.  Many walleye over 16 inches were present, but few over 20 inches.  Smallmouth bass also appeared to have been relatively abundant, and some larger fish were found.  The northern pike catch was similar to past catches in this lake.  There appeared to have been few older, larger fish present; most northern pike collected were less than 24 inches in length.  Growth of all gamefish collected had been average or faster than average for this area, despite the low number of yellow perch available as forage.</p>",

Although several naturally produced year classes were present, none were strong.  Walleye growth had been slow, despite the presence of good numbers of yellow perch.  Because the walleye catch was low, failing to meet the long range goal established for this lake, walleye stocking will be resumed in 2009.   <br> \n <br> \nThe smallmouth bass catch was also unusually low, with no fish taken in three-quarter-inch trap nets and only two in gill net sets.  Although it can be difficult to sample smallmouth bass in gill nets and trap nets, those gears have usually been quite effective in Round Lake, so the low catch in 2008 may represent a real decline in bass abundance.  The northern pike catch was low for a lake of this class, but not for this lake historically.  Northern pike growth rates had been fairly fast, and their average size was above average.   <br> \n <br> \nAlthough no one gamefish species was abundant in Round Lake in 2008, when taken together the lake still supported enough fish, in large enough sizes, to provide a good mixed-species fishery. <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

SMALLMOUTH BASS ARE PRESENT IN FAIR NUMBERS, BUT NO LARGER FISH WERE TAKEN. GROWTH APPEARS SLOW AT AGES II AND III. YELLOW PERCH ABUNDANCE IS GOOD, POSSIBLY AS A RESULT OF THE 1985 STOCKING.

All fish of ages 1 through 4 (62% of the catch) had been naturally produced.  Stocking last occurred in 1997, and was probably responsible for at least some of the age-5, age-7, and age-9 walleye that were caught.  Growth had been relatively fast for the area.  On average, walleye reached 9.2 inches by age 2, 13.0 inches by age 3, 16.9 inches by age 4, and 19.2 inches by age 5.The smallmouth bass catch was high for the lake historically and for the lake class.  Average size was within the normal range for the lake and the lake class.  Eight year-classes were present, indicating that natural reproduction had occurred in most years.The northern pike catch was low for the lake historically and for the lake class.  The ages of the three fish were 1, 3, and 4.The yellow perch catch was the highest recorded for the lake, but was within the normal range for the lake class.  Average size was typical for the lake, but larger than for most lakes of the same class.  Several year-classes were present.White sucker abundance appeared to be relatively high for the lake, but normal for the lake class.  Average size was typical for the lake, but larger than for most lakes of the same class.  Several year-classes were present.</p>",
