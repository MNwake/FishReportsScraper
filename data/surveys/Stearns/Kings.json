No Walleyes were present from any year in which stocking was not done. The Northern Pike population was composed mainly of age classes 3-5 and was above average in numbers, with good growth rates. Largemouth Bass showing good growth rates were sampled at a rate of 5 times the state median. All Largemouth Bass, except 1, were composed of fish from classes 1 and 2. The Bluegill catch, 106.5/ trap net, and the Yellow Perch catch, 45.8/gill net have increased tremendously from the 1978 catch. Black Crappie have become average in numbers and show good growth rates.\n\nOther species sampled either below or within the expected range included: Black Bullhead, Bowfin (dogfish), Brown Bullhead, Common Carp, Green Sunfish, hybrid sunfish, Pumpkinseed, and Yellow Bullhead.\n\n\n\n\n</p>",

Northern pike caught ranged in size from 13.2-37.0 inches and averaged 24.2 inches in length.  The average weight of pike caught (3.5 pounds) appeared to decline from the 1989 survey (4.4 pounds) but remained large for this lake type.  One to seven year old fish were caught with two to four year old fish dominating the catch.  The growth rate of northern pike was fast when compared to other populations in the state.     The gill net catch rate of walleye did not appear to change from the 1989 fish survey and remained high for this lake class.  The mean weight of walleye sampled (1.8 pounds) appeared to decrease from the 1989 survey (2.6 pounds) but remained within expected levels for this lake type.  Walleye caught ranged in size from 9.5-28.2 inches and averaged 15.3 inches in length.  Two year old fish, from the 1992 fingerling stocking, dominated the catch and little natural reproduction was noted.  The growth rate of walleye was average when compared with other populations in the state.     The catch rate of yellow perch in gill nets did not appear to change from the 1989 survey and remained within expected levels for this lake class.  Yellow perch caught ranged in size from 5.0-8.1 inches and averaged 6.1 inches in length.  The average weight of yellow perch caught (0.1 pounds) was within expected levels for this lake type. One to five year old fish were sampled, with two and four year old fish dominating the catch.  The growth rate of yellow perch was average.      The bluegill catch rate in trap nets did not appear to change from the 1989 fish survey and remained within expected levels for this lake type.  The mean weight of bluegill (0.1 pounds) also did not appear to change from the 1989 survey and remained within expected levels for this lake class.  Bluegill caught ranged in size from 3.7-7.9 inches and averaged 5.4 inches in length.  Two year old fish dominated the catch and the overall growth rate of bluegill was average.     The trap net catch of black crappie did not appear to change from the 1989 survey, and still remained within expected levels for lakes similar to Indian.  Black crappie caught ranged in size from 6.5-8.2 inches and averaged 7.6 inches in length.  Two year old fish dominated the catch and the overall growth rate of black crappie was fast.     The catch rate of largemouth bass in trap nets did not change from the 1989 survey and remained within expected levels for this lake class.  Largemouth bass caught ranged in size from 5.7-6.1 inches and averaged 5.9 inches in length.  The growth rate of largemouth bass was average.     The gill net catch rate of black and yellow bullhead did not significantly change from the 1989 survey.  The mean weight of black and yellow bullhead (1.4 and 1.0 pounds respectively) also did not change and remained large for this lake type.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Kings Lake is located in north-central Stearns County.  The surrounding watershed is primarily used for agriculture, and much of the shoreline is undeveloped.  Kings Lake supports a diverse aquatic vegetation community, and much of the shoreline is protected by emergent plants.  Kings Lake has been actively managed for walleye, with regular stocking of fingerlings.  Historically, gill netting has shown walleye abundance to be high, but a sharp decline was indicated by the 2004 survey.  The catch rate in 2004 was near the median for lakes similar to Kings, but significantly lower than 2001.  Part of the decline may be attributed to the poor survival of smaller sized walleye stocked in 2001 and 2003.The catch rate of northern pike in 2004 was above average, and similar to what was found in 2001 and 1994.  Average size was high (3.2 pounds in 2004).  Yellow perch were relatively abundant (but small), and provide good forage for northern pike.Ninety largemouth bass were sampled by electrofishing, at a rate higher than average for lakes in this part of the state.  The mean length of bass sampled was 10.9 inches, but the catch included several fish less than 5 inches.  Half of the \"catchable\" size bass were larger than 12 inches, and the largest was 16.5 inches.  Growth rates of bass were fast.  Bluegill were abundant but small in 2004.  Mean length was 4.9 inches, and the largest bluegill sampled was only 7.2 inches.  Fewer bluegill were caught in 1994 (23.2/net), while mean length (5.4 inches) was slightly higher than 2004.  Growth rates of bluegill were slow.  The catch rate of black crappie was below average for lakes like Kings, and much lower than in 1994.  Mean weight (0.25 pounds) was also below average.</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Kings Lake is a 194 acre lake located two miles northwest of Freeport in Stearns County. The lake has a maximum depth of 44 feet and a small watershed dominated by row crops and pasture. A public access is located on the south end of the lake. Kings Lake is managed primarily for Largemouth Bass and Northern Pike and was last surveyed in 2004. Anglers can expect good fishing for Largemouth Bass, Northern Pike and Walleye. <br> \n <br> \nCurly leaf pondweed was surveyed in June and covered less than one percent of the lake area. An aquatic vegetation survey was conducted in early July; star duckweed, coontail and sago pondweed were the most common aquatic plant species and plants grew to a maximum depth of 24 feet. Water clarity was good; Secchi depth was 7 feet in early July and MPCA data show average Secchi values of 6 feet over the last ten years. Dissolved oxygen was adequate to support fish down to 14 feet in early July. <br> \n <br> \nLargemouth Bass were caught by daytime electrofishing in late May in low numbers, but with good size. The catch rate of 14.6 per hour was much lower than the Sauk Rapids Area daytime average of 43.3 per hour. Electrofishing during the day in clear water was difficult and likely lowered the catch rate. The catch rate in 2004 at night was much higher. Lengths in 2015 ranged from 8.0 to 19.6 inches with an average length of 15.8 inches. Largemouth Bass were large; of catchable size fish (>8 inches), 68% were 15 inches or longer. <br> \n <br> \nNorthern Pike numbers were lower than most lakes in the area and lower than in past surveys, but within the expected range of values for similar lakes. Lengths in 2015 ranged from 15.6 to 32.0 inches with an average length and weight of 23.3 inches and 2.8 pounds. Northern Pike size was good; 35% were 24 inches or longer. Many lakes in the area have high numbers of pike, which often results in smaller fish, but Kings Lake is an exception. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye were stocked by the DNR until 2003, but are no longer stocked or managed by the DNR. However, the local sportsman's club has stocked fingerlings since 2005 and maintained a viable fishery. Walleye numbers increased since 2004, but are within the expected range of values for similar lakes. Lengths ranged from 8.9 to 22.4 inches with an average length and weight of 14.3 inches and 1.4 pounds. Walleye growth was fast, reaching 18 inches in four years. <br> \n  <br> \nBluegill numbers were higher in 2015 than in 2004 and higher than expected for lakes like Kings. Lengths ranged from 3.6 to 8.6 inches with an average length of 6.2 inches. Bluegill size was larger than in 2004 and larger than many other lakes in the area. Black Crappie numbers were higher than expected compared to similar lakes and much higher than in 2004. Lengths in 2015 ranged from 4.4 inches to 10.6 inches with an average length of 8.1 inches. Mid summer netting can be highly variable for panfish; surveys around spawning time would better assess Bluegill and Black Crappie abundance and size. <br> \n <br> \nThe Yellow Perch catch was similar to 2004 and within the range of expected values. Lengths ranged from 4.8 to 8.5 inches with a mean length of 6.4 inches. Compared to many lakes in the area, the Northern Pike catch is low, likely increasing Yellow Perch survival. Other species captured in low numbers include: Bowfin (Dogfish), Brown Bullhead, Hybrid Sunfish, Pumpkinseed and Yellow Bullhead. <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

                "narrative": "<p>Northern Pike abundance dropped significantly compared to 1984 and was below the expected range. Ages 3-7 were sampled. The most common size at capture were females and overall growth was fast. Walleye abundance was similar to 1984 and more than twice the state average. Most of the Walleye sampled were from 1986 or 1983 year classes, when fingerlings were stocked. The sampled was dominated by females which ranged from 14 to 25 inches in length. Growth for both sexes was good and females showed fast growth at ages 2 and 3. Bluegill abundance dropped from 106.5/trap net in 1984 to 15.2/trap net, a level near the state median and near levels seen in the 1963 and 1978 nettings about 60 percent of Bluegill measured from trap nets were less than four inches in length. Black Crappie appeared to be more abundant than in 1984, however, the catch remained within the expected range. Trap net sampled fish were 3-8 inches and gill net sampled fish were 6-11 inches in length. The modal length for each gear was seven inches. Yellow Perch numbers were similar to 1984 and remained well above the expected range. Median size of fish measured from gill nets was 6.5 to 6.9 inches, larger than in 1984. Spring electrofishing noted the presence of many small perch. Shoreline seining produced moderate numbers of young of the year perch and several other forage species. Bowfin (dogfish) and three species of bullheads were caught in low numbers. White Suckers, Common Carp and Golden Shiners were also sampled in low numbers.</p>",
